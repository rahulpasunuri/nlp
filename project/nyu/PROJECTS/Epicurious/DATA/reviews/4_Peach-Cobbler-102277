The first time I made this I followed the recipe almost to the letter. I can't help but to make small change; a splash of vanilla and sprinkle of this or that. The topping is what is important to my review. The first time I dropped the topping on by the spoonfuls. Perfect! It's fluffy and light. Today, I made it with granny smith apples and it turned out well. I wasn't afraid to serve it to my neighbors. Only, I got the idea that if I spread the topping over the baked apples it might trap some moisture in the dish because the apples were looking a little dry when I pulled them out. It did trap the moisture and it melded it together. It wasn't unpleasant but next time I'm dropping the spoonfuls over the pan so it marks off the servings. That way, it's like getting your own little crunchy cookie top on the fruit. This is a good recipe for someone who isnt a talented baker. Its super easy and recommended for someone who needs a dessert but doesnt really bake. For people like me, who love to bake, it likes to be played with. Enjoy your ovens

I followed the recipe exactly and next time will add a pinch of nutmeg and maybe some cardamom. My peaches were sweet but thought the fruit could use a little more sugar and the biscuit dough a little less. It tasted sweeter than the peaches. Also, I would definitely put in 8 peaches - we were wishing there was a higher peach to batter ratio. That said, it was DELICIOUS!

I love this recipe. You can make it with 4 peaches or with 6 and its easy enough for a week night I play with the sugar depending on how ripe the peaches are and it always comes out great. I also roast the peaches a day or so in advance if I have angel food cake to get rid of after strawberries and dish out some peaches and serve with home made whipped cream.. haven't had complaints yet..

Classic, simple base for any fruit cobbler; with a quick tweak it was perfect. Followed everything to point, except for adding a touch of coconut extract to the biscuit topping right after the water. Secret ingredient. No one tastes coconut, but they will notice the deepening of the flavor.

Delicious! I picked up perfect peaches on way home from beach (everthing incl. produce is better @beach!)& modified Peaches for flavor/Topping for texture: Peaches - N/a lemon juice,+ 1/2tsp of both vanilla & almond extract. Topping - only 3/4 wht sugar + 1/4 Lt Br sugar, 1tsp cinnamon, 1 stick of butter & only 1oz(ish) water to desired texture. A keeper & another reason to go back to beach!

I made this last night for family and everybody loved it. I used some beautiful farmer's market peaches (peeled, for the record! It really is worth the extra step!) and added a handful of blackberries from the garden since they're prime right now, too. It was perfect -- slightly warm from the oven and with homemade honey ice cream.

Make sure you spray the pan with a nonstick spray or the peaches will stick. Also, I found the recipe lacks any vanilla or cinnamon. When added, I find this recipe works.

Great summer dessert with local peaches from the farmer's market and vanilla ice cream. The first time I made it I accidently omitted the water in the topping and it was still great - the topping had more of a struesel type texture. The next time I made it I actually remembered to add the water and it had more of a buttery bicuity topping which was also yummy. I think I actually liked the version w/o water better though!

Rating: 3
Great recipe. If your peaches are very flavorful and juicy, you might omit the lemon juice -- I found the filling a little tart and runny. I also added 2T of butter, in small pieces, to the peaches -- I like a little butter in a pie/cobbler filling. Nice to find a peach cobbler recipe that's NOT insanely sweet --a lot of recipes I found initially call for a total of 2c of sugar!

I loved the simplicity of this recipe. The splash of lemon juice complimented the peaches nicely. Used King Arthur White whole wheat flower and turbinado sugar. Wasnt too sweet for us but I used a bag of frozen peaches from Costco that wasnt quite ripe (crunchy & tart when thawed). If using fully ripe peaches, maybe lighten up on the sugar. I made a second batch with cinnamon (it is supposed to help blood sugar stabilization). I will probably try this recipe with the topping replaced with a ground macadamia nut and date crumble.

My boyfriend made this for my family--found this recipe while he was looking for one like his grandmother used to make. We all loved it, but he said he'd use a deeper dish next time so it was "gummier"--more like dumplings than biscuits. I liked it exactly as it came out--crisp, sweet, yummy.

What an Easy and Delicious dessert! Seriously, you can't mess this up...unless you burn it to a cinder! My advice is...double the biscuit topping, lessen some of the sugar, with the peach mixture, use 8 large ripe peaches, exchange 1/4 cup of sugar to brown sugar..light or dark and add a tsp of cinnamon. I am not even a peach lover and this was a huge hit!

This is really an old fashioned country cobbler topping that reminds me of what my grandmother used to make and brought with her from the farm she grew up on in Jackson Co. WV from the 1920's. She always used brown sugar in her topping and I've done that here but cut back a bit so it's not too sweet. This topping can be used on any fruit. I've used it on peaches, blueberries and tonight I'm using it on a mixture of raspberries, marionberries and blueberries.

I love this recipe. Quick and easy. Not overly sweet. I cook it about 5 min less however so the topping isn't dry.

Rating: 1
Way too sweet for our tastes-- the filling was fine (since basically, it's just fruit-- I used nectarines that were already very sweet, so didn't use as much sugar as the recipe called for). Made extra topping as recommended in the reviews, and added a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon to add some interest/complexity, but in the end, all we could taste was the sugar of the topping. I ended up removing the topping and eating the fruit with yogurt. Our regular cobbler recipe is more like a only slightly sweetened biscuit dough, I will be returning to that next time!

Rating: 3
A good starter recipe. I used white flesh peaches that were quite crisp. I will wait for them to ripen a bit more next time, and maybe slice them thinner. I also added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the topping and it was delicious. Next time, I will double the crust, even though the dough spread, there were still areas uncovered after baking (and I added 7 minutes to the baking time).

Rating: 3
Really easy recipe. I doubled the crust portion as suggested by a few reviews and had enough left to make some braided cookies that I dusted with cinnamon and sugar. Kids loved those! I added cinnamon to the topping as well because I love cinnamon but I'm sure it's tasty without too. I also used salted butter because I like a bit more savory in my dessert. I highly suggest a real vanilla bean ice cream with it. Great fathers day treat!!

I'm eating the peach cobbler right now and it tastes great. I followed everyone's suggestions and added nutmeg and cinnamon to both the peaches and the topping. I would make sure to add topping on the edges FIRST, because if you don't the peaches start boiling and you will have topping-less edges. I think the recipe could use a bit more topping too. Regardless, DELICIOUS!!!

The cooking time was the same as for the peach.

Gosh there were so many conflicting reviews I didn't know what to do in terms of the topping. I found that I did need to spread it out a little. I didn't and it was a little doughy under the crust. That being said, I wouldn't ding the recipe for that. It was delicious and super easy to make. The peaches I had were super sweet so I cut back a little on the sugar.Oh, and I added a 1/4 c of oats to the topping for some texture - but not really necessary. Yummy. Would make again.

Tasty cobbler that doesn't let sugar overwhelm the fruit. I was on the coast on a cool summer night (low 50s), so I added some cinnamon and oats to the biscuit mix for a heartier batter. Oh, I accidentally bought 3 varieties of peaches, and it made the taste and appearance interesting.

I substituted the sugar in the bisquit with about a cup of loosely packed brown sugar, added a teaspoon of powdered ginger, and used 1/3 cup cold milk instead of boiling water. I put butter on the peaches in the pan and did not bake them in advance. The extra sweet in the batter made up for omitting the peach sugar and this is delicious.

It's perplexing that this recipe has such a high rating..... it's bland and nothing special. It's true that baking time should be increased (otherwise it's doughy), and adding berries and sprinkling with cinnamon-sugar would be an improvement. Nevertheless, it wouldn't improve it enough for me to retry. Oh, and contrary to a previous review, the topping DOES spread and you don't have to do it "manually".

Rating: 4
Delicious. I have made this many times and found that the topping does not spread, so I recommend flattening the dough a bit prior to putting it on the peaches.

Great recipe -- but you should really follow and pre-cook peaches for 10 minutes. I actually add cinnamon and raspberries. Also the 25 minutes is NOT accurate -- more like 40 minutes or you have a nice topping with just dough goo under the top. I mix it up 15 minutes into cooking so the top won't burn and all the dough cooks.

My too-ripe peaches were mush after blanching, so I made this recipe with bosc pears and blueberries instead. I'm sure it would be excellent with most any fruit because the biscuit topping is excellent. I thought I should have made more of it before I baked it, but I think now it would have been too doughy. As it was, the crust was crisp and buttery and tender inside (I used half milk and half water). I also gave it a slight dusting of cinnamon before it went in the oven. Just delicious, and it made for a beautiful photo, too.

I really enjoyed this recipe for the most part. The one thing that I would caution is the serving size. I doubled this recipe since I was bringing it to a party and I would say that I made enough for roughly 20 people to have a small serving! I don't know what kind of people would eat a quarter of the regular one but its about a double serving size in my mind.

This cobbler is easy, looks great & tastes yummy. I had 3 pounds of very ripe nectarines, so I used those, plus 1 quart fresh blueberries. The fruit was so ripe & sweet, I used less than 1/8 cup sugar. Per other reviewers, I increased the corn starch to 1 tablespoon & doubled cobbler topping. Perfect! This all fit in my 2-quart baking dish & was plenty for 8 people. Served with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Easy to make - my 7 year old daughter's first foray in to the world of pies, crisps, and cobblers. Simple but good flavors. My personal preference is for a crunchier crust (the kind with oatmeal and maybe nuts); this was a bit doughy and bland for my personal preference. Delicious served warm; ice cream would have been a fine addition.

Syper easy and amazing flavor! I cut the recipe in half, didn't need that much. I'll try some of the tips next time, like adding cinnamon and increasing the topping by 50%. I didn't peel the peaches, didn't know to. I thought it made the peaches a little chewy, not enough to make a difference.

I used a glass pie dish (2qt) and it was so yummy with a little coconut ice cream. I did not bother to peel the peaches and it turned out very delicious (peels don't get in the way at all!) but just be warned the filling comes out a reddish color because of the red from the peach peel. I used 1 Tbs of cornstarch because that's what everyone recommended. The topping was perfect with 1 t cinnamon and pinch of cardamom.

This tastes very good and smells great. I doubled the recipe. I doubled both the peach filling and also the topping. Some of the changes I made were out of necessity. I was out of all purpose flour so I used self rising flour. I omitted the baking powder and salt because the self rising flour contians both of these. I used 2 tablespoons of corn starch in the doubled recipe,due to most reviews I read which suggested upping the amount of cornstarch. I used brown sugar in place of all the white after reading a lot of reviews suggesting brown tastes better. I left the skins on the peaches because I like a more rustic cobbler, I think the skin adds colour, texture and vitamins. My peaches were slightly underipe but this didn't hurt the tasty end results. I used a food processor to incorporate the butter {the way I would to make pastry} and I added powdered buttermilk to some 'skim plus' milk in place of the water into the food processor. {If using a processor be careful not to overprocess or your topping will be tough, not soft and appealing.} The resulting cobbler is fragrent, and the topping is crisp and almost breadcrumb like. I couldn't wait to taste it{I just made it a few minutes ago!} I had some while it was still very warm. I think it tastes very good. I will try making this again in the future useing the exact original unaltered ingredients in the original recipe. I don't think its necessary to add any spices such as cinimmon because the peaches really stand on thier own, but I don't think it would hurt at all if one did add some spice. I'ts just litterally a matter of personal 'taste'. I'll write another review when I made the unaltered recipe in the future and I'll tell which version I like better, the one with my changes, or the original unaltered one.

Having a child that just learned to walk I did not have the time to sit and read through the reviews, just made it. It was lovely but I made the mistake I later learned other cautioned against; I did not spread the dough thinly enough so that the underside remained gooey. I used a 2 qt dish (quoting a size rather than volume might have been better there) as called for but it was deep rather than shallow, a shallow one would have been better as it would have created more surface area for the topping to cover. I had to pull it at 25 minutes or it would have burned. So we ate the edges, which were still phenomenal. I like the crispy- sweet- salty- cakey feeling of this topping. I also like that the flavor is very simple, I would not add the stuff others do because this feels like a recipe Annie Sommerville or Alice Waters would encourage you to try in that it relies on the essential ingredients and is confident that simplicity is the way to most appreciate the true nature of your ingredients. I feel more connected to the season and the the time when things are easy to taste.

I confess, I thought this cobbler topping sounded a bit bland and made it more out of curiousity at why it would get such good reviews. I was a little mystified by the use of hot water, instead of buttermilk or cream, but I found it to be fantastic. The biscuit topping has such a high ratio of sugar, that the top part that browns becomes slightly chewy and cookie-like, yet the underside does taste more like a biscuit. I will certainly be making it again, though I may try to spread it a bit more, since the top grew a little dark while I was waiting for the inderside of the dough to finish baking. All around great recipe I will now try with other fruit.

I've made this time and time again as a base cobbler, with peaches and without. Most recently, used all strawberries, but I've also used raspberries, blueberries and mixtures with rhubarb. As other reviewers have noted, no sugar is necessary in the filling as long as the fruit is ripe and sweet. The crust can be enhanced with cinnamon or cardamom, and def go with brown sugar. I like crystallized sugar on top. Definite yum factor. I am always asked for the recipe.

Super easy! If your peaches are ripe then the sugar is not needed, but if you want to add it in think about using brown sugar. I also used 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white for the topping. This is a great recipe for the summer when you don't want to spend too much time in the kitchen but want a fresh, seasonal end to a meal. Will definitely make again... maybe next week!

This is a delicious recipe. I add strawberries or raspberries. I also normally double the fruit and triple the topping. Last time I brought it to work my boss told me she wanted to stick her face in it! Great for potlucks.

YUMMY! Used very delicious and very ripe white peaches for this recipe so I used 1/8 cup of sugar to mix with the cut fruit. I really liked it but husband prefers crumbly topping, not this doughy biscuit topping. So I'm still looking for a recipe for him. Meanwhile, I'll keep making this!!

This recipe is a classic and a keeper--so easy, and so good. I've used this template to make not only peach but mixed berry cobbler, strawberry-rhubarb cobbler, and tonight it will be nectarine. Add it to your recipe box--you'll reference it often.

Fresh peaches in Michigan in May? No way. I used half frozen peaches and half canned freestone peaches, light brown sugar instead of the white sugar and added 1T. bourbon, a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the peaches for a delicious addition to the Derby Day dessert table.

I've made this dessert a few times using a variety of different fruits (apples, peaches, blueberries) and it's been great each time. I found the crust to be a bit sweet as it states in the recipe, so I reduced the amount of sugar.

I didn't think this recipe was that great. The topping was too bland for me. I prefer a topping with more substance, maybe more of a "crisp" topping. I wouldn't make this recipe again, I would try a new one next time.

On an "easy" scale of 1 to 10, 1 being instant pudding, this is a 3 but it tastes more like a 7. After experimenting, my best cobbler was made with double the crust (half the white sugar made up with brown sugar), half the lemon juice plus a half tablespoon orange juice and a teaspoon cinnamon. My oven is hot so it was ready by 18 minutes.

I've moved and to avoid upacking I thought I'd have a dinner party! Needless to say i could not find my "best of the best' peach cobbler recipe, and used this one. Wow, everyone enjoyed it and it was alot easier. The top was sweeter than I usually make it but wonderful and the texture was crumbly and soft below, just like I like. Really great. (I used a few extra peaches and a little dab of vanilla)

Took suggestions from others. Used cinnamon, used buttermilk instead of hot water. (Powdered buttermilk is a great staple to keep.) Make sure to add some salt to peaches; anything this sweet needs a little salt. Also added 2 tbl. wheat germ to topping to give more depth. Had "vision problem" with hot water, couldn't see using it in pastry. Cold buttermilk much better. Also, this recipe cries out for using a food processor for topping.

One of the easiest and most delicious dishes I've ever made. I baked it for the first time last night, and I've got another one in the oven for today. The most difficult part was slicing the peaches. Truly a 10 minute recipe. Highly recommended!! Great with vanilla ice cream!

I substituted Splenda for the sugar (to better suit my husband's low sugar diet), and it was still delicious.

I give this recipe 4 forks because of how incredibly easy and quick it is. I used very ripe peaches and plums and they came out WAY TO SWEET. If you have good, ripe fruit, you do not need to add the sugar to the peaches. Made a few changes at the suggestions of other readers. I added cinamon to the peaches/plums and also to the topping. Used hot skim milk in place of the water. Used 3/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of oatmeal. It took me 5 minutes to make the topping. It was so good, we ate some of it raw! Can't wait to make with blueberries. Or apples in the fall!!!

I accidentally forgot to add the sugar to the peaches and it came out wonderfully. As long as you have peaches that are in season, you might not need the extra sugar.

I've been making this cobbler for over a year and have learned one thing. If you don't have great peaches, you won't get a great cobbler. I've tried with mediocre and less than mediocre peaches and the quality of the cobbler depends on the quality of the peaches. I've also made this cobbler with apricots and blueberries and they were also very good. The bottom line is great fruit makes a great cobbler!

So sorry to diss this recipe,but I can't understand why it got such rave reviews. I just made this for neighbors and it was such a disappointment. I followed the recipe exactly, and found it very dry and less than inspiring. Most of the 3 and 4 fork recipes I've tried are outstanding, but this one won't be repeated in my kitchen. I'm sure there are better cobbler recipes out there.

Wow! Fabulous dessert, and generally my motto is "If it ain't chocolate, it ain't worth the calories." Definitely worth the calories, especially if you add a few more: I added 1 tbsp powdered buttermilk blend which really made the cobbler POP. I can still taste that buttermilk tang. Yum! I did cut back on the sugar as the others suggested; you won't miss it. Our peaches were only mediocre and this still turned out delicious; although it's possible that their being barely ripe (and less sweet) may have even enhanced the dish.

I made this recipe as directed and a gal in my office (who is from Atlanta) told me it was the best cobbler she's had since her grandmother passed. Pretty big compliment. That said, the peaches I'd used were simply amazing... bought on the side of the road at a reliable fruit stand, and tree ripened in south carolina the second week of June. I think when you've got peaches like that you've just gotta let them speak for themselves. If my peaches were not as amazing as those I probably would have added some cinnamon and a little more sugar. But as was, amazing.

I tried to impress my family with a great cobbler but needless to say, I failed with this recipe. As a southern girl, I expected a thicker dough and slightly syrupy cobbler juice. My mother asked if I used buttermilk that this recipe does not call for. I think there's a lot more missing also.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I added a very little amount of cinnamon to the peaches but it would be very good without as well. The only change I will make next time is to peel the peaches. The topping was so simple to make and melted just enough in baking to spread but also kept it's "clumpy" form which looked very nice at the end.

Excelent desert! I did the same as others cinamon is needed on the fruit. I made it twice in a months time. First with peaches & we were licking our fingers & the plates! Second was with apples, i needed something for fruit that was on its way to perrishing, & it turned out AMAZING! I thought the topping wouldnt be enough but i spread it thin & it was more than ample. I thought there was too much sugar & it was perfect, not overly sweet at all! I served it warm & with french vanilla icecream & I have been told by my family they don't ever want another desert! I am looking forward to trying other fruits but the apples with cinamon will be imposible to beat!

After reading several reviews I decided to add a dash of spices and a little more biscuit topping; however I was quite disappointed in the overall dish. The biscuit topping tasted odd to me and although I added more peaches than the recipe called for, I still felt like it had too few peaches. No one went back for seconds and the leftovers went to waste. Next time I'll try the old standby, the Barefoot Contessa's Peach Raspberry Crisp. Now that is a recipe that you'll make over and over.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe. I doubled it to take to the office for a birthday party, and I was doubtful when I poured the boiling water into the butter-flour mixture, but the crust was perfect. I added about a cup of blueberries, mixed a little cinnamon in with the fruit, and served it with whipped cream. It was excellent with those variations, but would have been equally delicious without the blueberries or cinnamon. A perfect end-of-summer dessert that looks impressive and is a snap to make.

This is yummy and very easy. I do think it needs a bit of added spice, though. Next time I'll add some cinnamon and perhaps cardamom, as other reviewers suggested. I used only half the sugar recommended, and it was fine. I'll probably double the crust portion next time, too.

This was great and easy on the first try. Success is influenced by the quality of peaches.

I was very disappointed in the crust of this recipe. I used a large casarole dish, and there were plenty of peaches, but not nearly enough crust to call it a cobbler. The crust definately lacks cinnamon and maybe even other ingredients that are used in cobblers. This was closer to a pie and it tasted good, but was not very exciting.

Rating: 3
Delicious! But. I took some advice from reviewers before starting. Cut the sugar in half, added a little cinnamon, and instead of all AP flour, used 3/4 of a cup, supplemented with 1/4 cup whole wheat. I was a little disappointed when the topping didn't spread as much as I'd assumed it would, and had to break it up with a fork when it came out of the oven. Even so. Would make this every day of my life.

Excellent cobbler. Just moved to Aiken and with the excellent peaches and cook books in boxes, I went on line and found this recipe. I have made it 3 times so far. I do peel my peaches, and to celebrate the 4th I made it for a cook out with blue berries and raspberries. It was delicious and so easy.

Rating: 3
This recipe is divine. The hot-water approach to the crust is so simple and so irreverent. I have made this cobbler with peaches, peaches and blueberries, and am now trying mixed berries. Seems to work equally well with whatever fruit is in season. I cut the sugar in half in both the filling and the crust and found it plenty sweet for my palate and others'. I also used 1/2 AP flour and 1/2 whole wheat pastry for the crust and found that the whole wheat provides a nutty depth of flavor without being too "health foody." To me, this is the mark of a good, solid recipe: one that stands up to numerous alterations.

I'm giving this recipe a four fork rating not just because it's very good, but also because it's so easy. I was worried about not peeling the peaches. Don't you always have to peel the peaches?

This is an excellent recipe. It is great just as it is and also with variations. I have added cinnamon to both the topping and the peach mixture several times, also nutmeg, ginger, and/or crystallized ginger. When peaches are around during the winter months I have made this recipe, doubling the sugar for the peaches and it is still great. This is a standard at our house.

This is an excellent versatile recipe that was perfect for a quick family treat. I threw in some dried cranberries, 1/2 scraped vanilla bean (seeds only obviously!), and some cinnamon to the fruit mixture. I also added some cinnamon to the biscuit crust. The crust turned out so tender and flaky that we could have enjoyed it all by itself. I need to take a housewarming gift to a friend. This will be the perfect gift...just bake a cobbler in a pretty new casserole dish and give her the whole thing, dish and all.

This was my first cobber making experience, but surely not my last! I thought this was straight forward, and absolutely delicious. As others have suggested, this recipe allows you to experiment. To my 5 peaches, I added 1 large grated apple, and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top right before baking. The biscuit topping added great texture and the fruit was tender, juicy, not too sweet, and oh so enjoyable!

Like many of the others, I made this receipe with apples and it turned out great. I also added a few cranberries which gave it a nice sweet/tart flavor. It also made the cobbler more festive in color. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon on top of the dough before baking. It was yummy!

This cobbler was amazingly easy to make and so good. My teenage daughter had never tried a cobbler before and devoured her helping without a word. I did imporvise a little I used a forzen fruit mix that contained peaches, strawberries, blueberries and grapes and it came out very sweet and tangy. The only thing I would change next time is add a little more cornstarch, as some other reviewers have suggested and make more of the topping, because I like think would be nice just a little cakier on the top.

Made this recipe for a group that enjoys deserts, especially from the south. I improvised a bit- by adding two white peaches one time, and two nectarines the next(seasonal changes) they both added more texture; moreover, sweetness to the mixture. I also used golden brown sugar(instead of refined white sugar) and orange juice to the "peach mixture". Finally, after spooning the "crust" mixture atop the peaches I sprinkled a mixture of white sugar and cinnamon(to give that golden brown "cinnamon toast" appeal. Absolutely fabulous!!

I had to cut down on the peaches because there were just too many to fit in the pan, and I added cinnamon to spice things up a bit. All in all it was very good, especially with some vanilla bean ice-ream on the side. My husband absolutely loved it... he probably would have given four forks.

As a native Midwest gal, I truly impressed our Southern neighbors with this cobbler! I transferred the baked peaches into a pie crust using a slotted spoon for more of a pie feel - it didn't matter either way, the sweet biscuit topping provided all the flavor needed. Sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on the biscuit topping prior to baking for a bit of spice taste. I wouldn't recommend nutmeg - it would probably be too strong for the delicate peach flavor. So good the four of us ate the entire cobbler! And it's quite easy, too!

The result was a delicious dessert, especially served warm with whipped cream.

Want a fast, super-easy version of peach cobbler? Just buy a can of peaches used for pie filling. Throw it in a pot and add a box of yellow cake mix on top. Let it cook slowly; the cake mix will bubble as it cooks throughout. I got this from someone I met camping (thanks, Claudia!)

I doubled the topping and also added cinnamon and nutmeg as suggested by other reviewers. I put the cinnamon/nutmeg in the topping, but next time will probably mix them into the peaches instead. Also, I used half brown sugar/half white, which I prefer to all-white. It was delicious and very nice with ice cream on a summer eve.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. I just used enough peaches to fill the pan about 3/4 full (this in answer to someone's question about # of cups). Squeezed 1/2 lemon. I did substitute 1/2 part raw sugar and 1/2 part brown sugar for the white sugar measurements (and did not increase the sugar amounts). I added cinnamon as some suggested, to both the filling and the crust. And I also dotted with a little butter (from my old peach pie baking days). I didn't double the crust, just because we're watching calories a little, but dropped lots of small spoonfuls, which did the trick with perhaps a bit of a thinner crust than some like. It was spectacular. I love peach pies and typically don't make cobblers, but this was so easy and so delicious that it lasted hardly any time. People raved that it's the best they've ever had. So I'm a convert. Easy and fabulous. What could be better?

Rating: 3
Wow! I NEVER make desserts and even I managed success with this one. Just threw everything together in about 10 minutes, wasn't even too precise about measurements, and it came out great. Took others' advice and added nutmeg and cinnamon. Can reduce sugar on peaches, but I'd keep it in the topping. Lots of lemon juice keeps the peaches bright and tart.

The recipe was very tasty. I took the suggestions from others and added the cinnamon and nutmeg as well as some extra sugar. Some prior reviews suggested doubling the topping, but I just baked it in a smaller (1 quart) round glass dish without incident. I'd certainly make it again. Also, delicious when served with whipped cream or ice cream.

The crust was really. really good. Very different. Not too sweet. I read the reviews before I made it and took the advice to double the crust amount. It worked out great!!!

Made this recipe for an informal cooking competition and it went over very well. I, like many others, added cinnamon and brown sugar to both the peaches and the crust and was very pleased with the results. Served it warm with a homemade vanilla ice cream. I kept reading from others to make more crust so I made the cobbler in a 9x13 pan and more than doubled the peached and tripled the topping. Turned out fine, but next time I will only double the topping. I will also try this recipe with other fruits.

My husband loves peaches and baked peach desserts. This recipe is really easy and very good. As suggested, I added cinnamon (1/2 tsp) and nutmeg (1/4 tsp). This time of year, peaches are usually not so sweet so I added the amount of sugar called for in the recipe. In real peach season, I probably would use a bit less sugar. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Rating: 4
Really, really good. I didn't prebake the peach filling or add the extra sugar, and it was fine (I did blanch and peel fresh, ripe peaches and add a handful of frozen blackberries). A pinch of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice in the topping, and it was perfect with vanilla ice cream. I think it could use more biscuit topping...I used less fruit and it was just right.

Rating: 3
I usually don't like cobbler as much as pie, but this one was wonderful. The topping had just the right amount of sweetness and crispness; the only thing wrong with it was that there just wasn't enough! Next time I'll double the batch. I had three huge peaches on hand so I added fresh raspberries and blackberries, which was not just delicious, but also gave the fruit a beautiful fushia color.

A perfect and simple peach cobbler recipe. Would recommend cutting down on the sugar by about 1/4 to 1/3 unless you have a real sweet tooth.

This recipe was good.I took the advice from the reviewers and added nutmeg and cinnamon(i added that directly to the peaches)the crust was so good and sweet it did not need anything else.Also,i used canned peaches instead(i was to lazy to slice the fresh peaches)they worked just as fine.just remember to drain the heavy syrup.The peaches already have enough moisture in them.

This recipe was outstanding, which really caught me off-guard since it was so easy! I made it on a whim because my husband wanted something sweet and all I had was peaches. All the other ingredients were staples. But this was so good, I'll never go in search of a peach cobbler recipe again!

Rating: 4
This is the best fastest, easiest cobbler ever! Of course I made it with apples because I didn't have peaches and added extra lemon, nutmeg and cinnamon, 1/4 brown sugar and butter to the apples. But the topping was lovely, sweet and tasted almost like a sugar cookie. Thanks epicurious for pointing me in the right direction once again! And thanks all you reviewers out there who let us know what's a must try! Keep up the good work people!

Perfect. I took advice and added cinnamon and nutmeg and about a 1/4 cup of brandy. Also, a little more corn starch to help thicken. I also mixed very ripe sweet peaches with some more tart ones which gave it a nice edge. Oh, and my kids loved it.

This recipe tasted wonderful, but turned out extremely soupy. I made the recipe for 32 ppl, perhaps it does not do well in large quantities. Even though it was really runny the taste was good and the topping was excellent. If I ever make it for a large group again I might make it in more than one pan.

For all those out there adding ginger and cinnamon and cloves to this recipe, think about adding ground cardamom. It really brightened up the flavor of the peaches. I should have baked the crust for another 10 minutes, it turned out a little gooey. Next time

Great,simple old-fashioned recipe; how refreshing not to have sixteen ingredients and a prep time of two hours. It was delicious--I was tempted to add more sugar (I used five cups of peaches) but restrained myself and it was perfect. I followed someone's suggestion and added a little cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg. The biscuit topping was very nice; better than a crumble but not as dry as a shortcake biscuit. In fact I was going to make peach shortcake with my ripe peaches but this was even easier.

We loved it. I made a few changes -- added a cup of blueberries, doubled the sugar & lemon juice (we like a tart/sweet flavour), and added vanilla to the topping. Next time, I might add a 1/4 cup of cornmeal to the topping mixture. The contrast between a slightly gritty topping & the soft fruit might be nice. In any case, this is a keeper!

I made this the other day with some huge, beautiful peaches that were delicious, and I'm going to make it again tomorrow, doubling the top and adding a little cinnamon. Also, why the hot water in the topping? I've never heard of that, and plan to use cold the next time. Maybe it will be a little fluffier. Delicious anyway.

My husband and I just polished off big dishes of this warm cobbler topped with vanilla bean ice cream. I don't see how you can go wrong with this classic recipe. Add cinnamon or more sugar to the peaches if you like or as needed ... The peaches that I used happened to be perfect - in season. I like more fruit with my cake, so next time I'll do this "deep-dish" by doubling the peaches.

One night the fam was in the mood for peach cobbler so I went on the recipe hunt and chose this one b/c it sounded easy. IT WAS GREAT! We made it TWICE in one week! The only thing we did differently was add cinnamon and nutmeg to the peaches, take the skin off the peaches (b/c i'm allergic), and add nutmeg and not so much water to the crust. We also topped the crust with a sprinkle of brown sugar before baking. What a GREAT recipe!

Great recipe. I like this biscuit dough much better than traditional fluffy biscuit dough. It had a nice crust and terrific flavor. I'm a bit of a nut for cinnamon, so I added some cinnamon to the fruit and to the biscuit dough, as well. It was just right.

Very disappointing. I agree, it need cinnamon or something. Call your grandma, I'm sure her recipe is better!

Very easy and delicous, even the pastry part was yummy! I used nectarines, instead of peaches, because my husband's boss gave us a huge bag of nectarines from his tree. I'm sure the peaches would have been tastier, because the necatarines had a bit of an after taste. Either way this recipee was a sucess!

I love peach cobbler, but this was mildly disappointing. It lacked the kick I was hoping for, even though I added ginger, cinammon & vanilla, as suggested by other reviewers. Maybe it needs a dash of nutmeg or cloves. The topping was also not as crumbly as I had hoped. There are plenty of cobbler recipes out there. I will keep looking for the right one . . .

I'm a horrible cook, but I found this recipe to be real simple. My husband even liked it and he never likes my cooking. (He ate half of it last night!) My only complaint is that would have more of a peach taste to it. Next time I'm going to add a little more peaches to the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful and simple. You only need one baking pan to cook the peaches and the topping. The hardest part is cutting up the peaches, the rest is a cinch! I make this cobbler topping with all kind of fruit. I refer to this recipe all the time. Yum!

Eh. It was tasty. Not "slap-your-momma-down" good as a friend would say, but not bad. I used pretty underripe fresh peaches, so I substituted grand marinier for the lemon juice. I added about two teaspoons of cinnamon and a teaspoon of ginger and it still was pretty bland. IF I make this again, it will be for someone who only like bland "home-cookin'" deserts.

This cobbler was wonderful - it won over four confirmed cobbler-haters at a recent dinner for friends. The biscuits were delicious and developed a crispy top in the hot oven. I cubed the peaches instead of thin slices, add cinnamon to the fruit and vanilla to the dough, doubled the recipe, baked it in a 13X9 glass pan. The peaches were fresh and the flavor excellent. Overall - a perfect summer dessert!

I made this recipe with canned peaches and found it was too sweet, Next time I might either use fresh peaches or less sugar. Also I found that it needed some spice, perhaps a touch of nutmeg or cinnimon. I made the topping with out a mixer and just used my hands and I was very happy with it.

This peach cobbler is great. I used white peaches, which are sweeter (I decreased the amount of sugar slightly), and left the skin on, which gave the peaches a rather aesthetically pleasing pale pink color after they were cooked. Also added some cinnamon. Definitely will make this again.

I didn't have a pastry blender and I wasn't exactly satisfied with how the topping's consistency turned out. But the flavor was certainly good and everyone liked it. I used fresh peaches sans skin, but would experiment with leaving the skins on too. I will try it again and attempt improvements. PS. The vanilla is a nice touch.

According to my husband (who is not big on sweets)..this was the best dessert he has ever had :-) I read all of the reviews after slicing 2 mangoes & 4 nectarines then added a sprinkle of cinnamon, (fresh peaches were not ripe yet). One person wrote they had tried mangoes & didn't like it, but this was awsome!

I used firm peaches that were not that sweet. I left the skins on, and made some modifications: added ground ginger and almond extract to the peach mixture and ground ginger to the batter. Next time, I will try fresh grated ginger or use more ground ginger. I read the recipe wrong, and had to adjust the flour-butter ratio but it still turned out wonderfully. My church group loved it.

This was fantastic. I followed the recommendations of a previous commenter and added cinnamon to the peaches, as well as a bit of juice from pressed ginger along with the lemon juice, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. There was enough dough for a 9 x 9 pan, as the recipe calls for. I would definitely make this again.

This was a quick and simple dish. I modified the recipe with one ingredient, vanilla. I added about 1 tsp to the batter ingredients which intensified the creamy batter flavor. This recipe is definitely one to pass on to friends and family!

Very good dessert. I made some more modifications that worked VERY well. First, I sprinkled some cinnamon on top of the peaches before baking, and that added some good flavor to the dessert. For the biscuit topping, I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and 1 teaspoon lemon peel. I agree with the previous reviewer who said that more topping should be made, especially if you're using a large dish where your peaches are more spread out. I also agree that the peach wedges should not be too thin. Some of my pieces just got too mushy. Finally, it's a good idea to find peaches that are not yet too soft. I'd say medium-ripe would be the most appropriate "degree." Top with vanilla ice-cream and you're good to go.

Rating: 4
Peaches are out of season, so I used Granny Smith apples, adding cinnamon and nutmeg. Served with vanilla ice cream. Outstanding! All diners, all ages loved it. My only cavil is that it didn't look as pretty as I would like, to make it suitable for a more formal dinner. Maybe needs more topping for more complete coverage. Glazing with milk and sugar might also add sparkle. (I followed the tip to cut the fruit a bit large, so it doesn't disintergrate or get too mushy, and I think that's important, so that this already somewhat sloppy dish doesn't get too gooey.)

Healthy version: I just made a healthy version of this and have to tell you that the basic directions are very versatile and wonderfully tasty. I substituted maple sugar for the white sugar and added a bit of cinnamon to the peaches. I then skipped the topping (I know its not really cobbler anymore)and added some organic granola instead. The baking times were nearly identical and I wound up with a wonderful peach desert, which was particularly good served with vanilla toffuti.

Used fresh peaches from our backyard & put cinnamon & vanilla in the crust. Fanatastic! I'm interested in adding ginger as mentioned by others & trying cinnamon in the peaches also.

This was delicious and easy. As other reviewers suggested, try adding vanilla and cinnamon to heighten the flavor. I also tossed the fruit with brown sugar instead of the white the recipe calls for, and replaced the lemon juice with the same amount of juice from freshly grated ginger.

Great cobbler recipe. We loved the biscuit topping. I added vanilla and cinnamon to the peaches as suggested in other reviews -- definitely added depth to the flavor. I used a regular 8x8 pan and the recipe was fine - didn't bubble over. I also baked it for 30 min. instead of 25, and the topping wasn't gooey at all. Nice and flaky. Would definitely do this again.

This was very nice. Guests asked for seconds. Topping is not too sweet. I kept the slices thick per previous reviews, which worked out well. As to the pie pan size question, YES, a 9" pan is the same as a two quart pan, but only if the 9" pan is 1.9 inches high, or the 8" pan is 2.4 inches high. Otherwise, use a standard 13 X 9 dish...

This rates better than 3 forks, but isn't perfect, so I can't give it 4 forks. I made this recipe 3 times in a span of 7 days! I love the biscuit-y topping (used the water from blanching the peaches for extra flavor; sprinkled toasted sliced almonds and cinnamon sugar on top). I also added cloves and ginger powder (grated fresh ginger might be better) to the peach mixture. I'll keep playing around with the spices in the peaches. So far, it's my favorite cobbler recipe. Note to those who can't get fresh peaches: use frozen--tastes so much better than canned in a cobbler.

Make sure your peaches are ripe. I bought them from a fruit stand, paid way too much and they ended up having a twang to them. Also, the topping wasn't good. I prefer more of a "doughy" topping rather than a "biscuit" style.

*NUMMY!* I used a pound and a half of fresh peaches, which despite the exhorbitant price I paid, were a little mealy and overripe -- yet it tastes delicious. Added a half-teaspoon of almond essence. Also, sprinkled the topping with toasted slice almonds and a wee bit of sugar.

Great summer dessert. I served it with homemade vanilla ice-cream on 4th of July. Very good recipe. I added cinnamon to both peaches and topping and also sprinkled some sugar on top of the biscuit topping to sweeten a little bit.

I thought this recipe was great. I took the advice of some of the others and added vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the peaches. I also added cinnamon to the dough and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar mixture on top. I didn't have fresh peaches so I used canned ones and it came out just fine. I would definately make this cobbler again.

Something VERY wrong happened when I made this recipe! I followed the directions exactly, but ended up with a topping that sank into the peaches and dissolved into a buttery mess! I'm not sure what happened!

Delicious! And I used 1/4 less butter than the recipe called for. I did take the advice of one of the other reviewers who suggested that it needed more cooking time, I don't like gooey dough either, I baked it for an extra 5 mins.

Perfect! Absolutely perfect just the way its written. I wouldn't change a thing.

My husband raved about this. I did not "love" it, though perhaps I am just not a peach cobbler person. I thought the cobbler topping, while light, was very doughy where it contacted the peaches. Perhaps I'll bake it 5 minutes longer, or more, next time. I think a 1/2 tsp cinnamon with the peaches and a tsp vanilla in the cobbler dough would be welcome additions. this was a quick and easy recipe with a pair of extra hands to peel the peaches while I sliced them :-). The cobbler batter makes up easily during the 10 minutes that the peaches are baking. I used a few pulses with a food processor to cut in the butter. Ver quick and very light texture were the results.

This is such a quick and easy recipe. I didn't have fresh peaches so I substituted a can of peaches and a can of pears. I also added a bit of cinnamon to the fruit and the topping. It was delicious served warm over vanilla ice cream!! Will definitely try this again with fresh fruit!

I made this recipe in Sept. 99 when it was first printed in Gourmet. The peaches were so ripe that time of year (in pacific nw), they were so sweet and juicy. What a delicious dish!! I couldn't believe I made it. Was incredibly dissapointed when I lost the magazine; so happy to find it here again on epicurious. Can't wait to make this again and again!

Fresh peaches are great. However, when not in season I have substituted drained canned sliced peaches and omitting the sugar from the toss. I also add cinnamon and nutmeg to the peaches. This makes the recipe very quick for weeknight dessert. The kids love it with vanilla ice cream.

I've made this twice this past summer. It is very good, everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. You definetly need large peaches, I did make the mistake the second time of using medium sized ones and if I used that size again I would use 8 or 9 of them.

I have made this about 5 times and it's been requested for Thanksgiving dinner. It is so quick and easy and everyone loves it. I am 26 and I made this during the summer for one of my Mom's best friends and her Mother. They are both southern woman who cook and they were asking for the recipe.

This cobbler was super!!! I am not a peach cobbler lover, but my husband is. He was so suprised when he thought I just concocted such a wonderful dish!!!!! It was a big hit, I did however listen to some of the other reviews and added brown sugar, cinnamon and almonds to the biscuit portion. I would recommend this recipe especially to new cooks....an easy dish to knock your guests' socks off......or your husband's!!!!!!

Mmmmmm, Loved this recipe. It was simple to put together and tasted just great! I did add nutmeg to the peaches before baking. Next time, I will add more and bake 3-5 min. longer. I like my biscuits to be golden brown.

I made this cobbler for my Dad's birthday, based solely on the wonderful reviews I read. We had a relative, in from out of town, who called his wife to tell her about the great cobbler! I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers and used brown sugar and cinnamon with the peaches and 1/4 cup yellow cornmeal, 3/4 cup flour, white sugar and cinnamon in the topping. I sprinkled brown Demara sugar that doesn't melt over the top. This is so easy to make and smells heavenly while it's baking. It was a huge hit. We served with good quality, but store-bought vanilla ice cream. It's a keeper!

This is one of my absolute favorite recipies of all-time from Gourmet. I've adapted it a bit and replace one of the peaches with 1c bluberries, increase the biscuit topping by 1/2, and sprinkle with sugar before baking. Tastes like summer...

I'm making it again tonight. Second time this week... need I say more? I used 3 parts flour to 1 part corn meal. I thought it enhanced the texture and gave some additional sweetness to the biscuit portion.

Super easy recipe! My guests are still raving about this dish and begging me to make it again. I added the cinnamon and a dash of grand marnier just for kicks :-)

YUMMY! That is what all of my guests said about this cobbler. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added about a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon to the peaches and sprinkled the top of the cobbler with two tablespoons of sugar mixed with a half teaspoon of cinnamon. This is one of the best cobbler recipes I have tried and it was so simple.

This is an all-time favorite. So easy! The only change I made was to sprinkle cardamom and cinnamon on the biscuit topping before baking. A perfect summer dessert.

Next time I will peel the peaches. I also added cinnamon to the peaches and sprinkled a cinnamon/suger mixture over the batter before baking.

This was a purely delicious recipe. I took the suggestion of other reviwers and added cinnamon, which added a nice touch. I can't say that this recipe swept me off of my feet but then again, I usually go for the chocolate desserts. This was a refreshingly warm and yummy change of pace. Definately a keeper.

I've looked for a long time for a peach cobbler recipe like my grandmother's (hers is a pinch of this and dash of that, so I could never perfect it). This recipe comes closer than any I've ever tried before. It was OUTSTANDING. Everyone at our July 4th BBQ loved it. I served it at room temperature with French vanilla ice cream. The only change I made was to combine 3 Tbl. sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon to sprinkle over the top of the biscuit dough. YUMMMMMY! Will definitely keep this in my repertoire.

This cobbler had all the hallmarks of a keeper: easy, quick to put together, delicious. I made it exactly according to the recipe. For some reason I had to add 15 minutes to the baking time to achieve the right browning. If you are going to make this for the 1st time for company, consider that you might have to allow for some extra baking time. Otherwise, perfect.

This is a spectacular recipe! It is fools proof and taste gourmet-ish. On my first try with tips from other reviewers it turned out delectable! The only adjustments I made was adding sprinkles of cinnamon to both the peaches and flour topping and I added a handful of raspberries (wonderful color) and 2 tsp of the cornstarch. This is a dish I will make over and over again.

I thought this recipe was great even though I'm not a huge fan of peaches. Its was also quite simple to make....and quick to prepare. I served it with a bit of whipped cream...yum!

I made this recipe for my husband for Father's Day, and we loved it! Based on suggestions from other reviewers, I added cinnamon, ground clove & nutmeg to the peach mixture. Instead of white sugar, I substituted with brown sugar and I also added lemon zest along with the lemon juice. I doubled the topping, and served with vanilla ice cream. It was a terrific finish to a great Father's Day meal.

I made it without the cornstartch, lemon, or hot water. You can't use too many peaches!

Rating: 3
Nice recipe, and very simple -- or at least it would be with perfectly ripe peaches. Since I was using peaches that were a little underripe, I doctored them with a sprinkle of cinnamon. I also omitted the lemon juice, and the cobbler was still tart enough. Like other reviewers, I wanted the texture to be a little firmer and used 2 t. cornstarch instead of one, but I found that it made the flavor a little bland. Overall, a good basic recipe, but may benefit from a little tweaking.

Absolutely delicious. I love how easy it is to prepare. Too bad it's not peach season, can't wait to make it again.

This was my first cobbler. It turned out wonderful, no leftovers. I used the fresh peaches that the recipe called for & don't think I'd try it another way. I also used more brown sugar & less white.

My wife had a craving for peach cobbler, but since it's January I was pretty much left with canned peaches as the only option. She loved it, I thought it adequate, but would naturally be better if made with fresh ripe peaches in season. I used two regular sized cans (14 oz?) and drained the syrup. I sprinkled the fruit with cinnoman and nutmeg, a little brown sugar (cut back from the recipe amount as the peaches are sweetened in the can), and 1T of cornstarch. I'm this method is not as good as fresh fruit, but if you have a craving in the middle of winter, it will do!

Like another reviewer, this was the first peach cobbler I'd ever made; I was enormously pleased. I did add a bit of brown sugar and thought the result was wonderful. I used a crate of peaches to make up packages of filling to freeze to use for a mid-winter treat.

I agree with the comments. Add more brown sugar and less white sugar to the recipe. Also, add the cinnamon. It is delicious made with apples also.

This peach cobbler was absolutely scrumptious and also very easy to make. Although I did read the previous reviews and added a little more sugar(1/2-3/4 cups) to the peaches and a little brown sugar to the topping. My husband and I loved it!

Great recipe and fast too. Although I would add brown sugar and a bit more sugar to sweeten it up just a bit. Adding blueberries is the best too. BUT, Watch it carefully, 25 minutes may be too long...mine almost burned. Or was that because I'm at altitude here in Colorado. Take it from this single male who can cook, it's a winner!

Great Recipe! Easy and delicious. I used marj. instead of butter. To serve 9 people, I doubled the peaches and tripled the cobbler. My co-workers were so impressed!

Not the best peach cobbler I've tried. Originally, this recipe was bland. It needed some cinnamon, or SOMETHING. I should've read these reviews before trying this.

I thought the cobber was very good. I did, however, spice it up with cinnamon and nutmeg. I mixed brown sugar with the fruit and sprinkled extra brown sugar on the top of the cobber. The sweetness was just right for my family. I also slightly increased the corn starch for a thicker filling. I'll make this again.

Since I was in a big hurry for a peach dessert recipe, I didn't read any recommendations & made the original recipe - it was a big winner! Next time, I'll add some blueberries to the peaches & the spices & brown sugar - in fact, that will be tonight's dessert! It's an easy dessert to put together - I mixed up all dry ingredients & got everything ready - after having dinner out, it was simple to make up the cobbler & eat it hot with cream. Wonderful!

Very very good! Did this with the brown sugar and cinnamon in the peaches variation. Also went 50/50 sugar/brown sugar in the topping. Came out perfect. Will definitely make this again.

This is a fantastic baseline recipe for cobbler. I made the following modifications: used brown sugar rather than white; added 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1/4 t. cardamom; increased cornstarch to 1T. (I prefer a slighter tighter consistency) and baked the whole thing in a (buttered) 8" cast iron skillet. (Also, I peeled the peaches.) My guests raved and my husband proclaimed it the best cobbler ever! This is definately going to become a standard in our house.

I took Laura advise and added brown sugar and cinamon to the peaches and was wonderful. I really enjoyed the crust.

This was one of the best! I would have to disagree with other reviewers when they said this wasn't great. The only thing I can say is to use fresh peaches in season and you're sure to get great results. The only thing I did differently from the original recipe is that I took the advice from the chef in SD and sprinkled a little cinnamon and brown sugar over the peaches before I baked them and the dish was delicious!

Excellent basic cobbler recipe. I used it with fresh Georgia peaches. I would recommend reducing the number of peaches to five and doubling the amount of cornstarch.

This is a good basic recipe, however, I added blueberries, cinnamon, brown sugar and dots of butter to the fruit mixture. The biscuits are better, too, if you brush with cream and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar before baking.

I thought this recipe was nothing special at all. The topping was kind of heavy, and the peaches were kind of bland even though I spiced them up with cinnamon and nutmeg. Won't try it again.

I added some plums and nectarines to the peaches and it worked out fabulously. You just need to double the ingredients and make sure the fruit is ripe. I have used other recipes for fruit cobblers but this one was the best and adapting it by adding other fruits was a novel idea.
