I've won three chili contests with this basic recipe and my variations! I have used this recipe as a foundation for vegetarian chili since it appeared in Parade magazine in 2000. I adjust the seasonings to our taste adding lots of cumin, oregano and chili powder and some chipotle chili powder, too. I've lived overseas all of these 12 years since the recipe was published and don't always have access to the exact ingredients but have been able to improvise everywhere we've lived and it always turns out great. But isn't that what makes cooking so fun?

What this chili promised, it delivered: it was spicey. Yes, it was spicey, amidst the mush of vegetables and beans, that is. Firstly, the green pepper should not have been added with the chopped onion- it should be added way later with the squash. There is something wrong when your green pepper melts in your mouth. Second, there is no way that this chili should have been cooked for a whole hour. I cooked mine for only half an hour and it was way overdone. Cook it until all of the veggies are crisp-tender. On top of that, this chili badly needed somethng. It was spicey, but not flavourful. Kind of one-note spiceyness. Next time, I will add way more chili powder- like the whole bottle- way more cumin- like half the bottle- a tbsp or so of dried oregano, another can of tomatos- I like mine diced because I like to get chunks of tomato in my chili- and a whole wack of chopped cilantro a few minutes before serving to finish it off. Other changes I made to the recipe were: I omitted the tomato paste because I hate it; I forgot the sugar because it seemed unnecessary; I left out the sour cream and cheddar because I'm lactose intolerant; and I threw in a can of garbanzo beans because it's not veggie chili without some good ol' garbanzos. All of that said, my sister still had three bowls of the chili as it was and declared it delicious. I think it will be even better tomorrow.

I also agree with other reviewers about not adding the tomato paste. Perhaps a few spoonfuls, but the whole 6oz takes away from the fresh taste. Also, I would cut back on the sugar a bit if you are using sweet canned corn liquid as well. Otherwise, this was very filling and delicious- don't take out the squash and courgette! Next time I'm going to try adding hot peppers...

We loved this. I was skeptical at first, but it turned out delicious. I used chili beans and kidney beans, added a package of meatless crumbles to get the right texture, and omitted the squashes. I agree that the amount of tomato paste is too much. I would either cut it in half or omit it entirely next time, but I will make it again. Yummy!

I'm really not that good of a cook, so I know when I love something I made, it wasn't me, but the recipe! This chili was so tasty I was excited to keep eating the leftovers!

Delicious vegetarian chili! I was looking for an old recipe we had made many times but misplaced during a recent kitchen remodel. Thank goodness it was still on-line! I made a double batch and mixed up the beans - black beans, garbanzo beans, cannellini beans and kidney beans. Just spicy enough for those who are afraid of "spicy" chili.

I've made this several times, slightly changing it every time. Have used pulled grilled chicken & ground beef - both turned out great. Have added jalapeno, habanero, roasted pasilla, different levels of chili powder and chipotle powder, all with great results. I always throw in a can of chopped tomatoes too, and have even made it with splenda instead of sugar. Never turns out bad.

This was a really good chili that I made into a really GREAT chili with a few additions. I added three hot peppers that turned it into a "spicy" chili. I also added three fresh tomatoes, a can of black beans and one pack of veggie ground meat to the mix. For toppings, along with slicing up a few scallions and grating some cheese on top, I also sliced up some fresh cilantro and served it on the side, so those who dislike it, didn't have to eat it. All in all, a really yummy veggie dish!

yummy & easy recipe! i used chipotle peppers in adobe sauce instead of green peppers, used maple syrup instead of sugar, one can of black beans instead of one of the red, and half the amount of tomato paste based on other reviewers comments.

Okay, but missing something. I went to a chili cookoff and tasted a vegetarian black bean chili recipe that was spicy and so much better than this recipe. I'll keep searching for it, and probably not make this one again.

I really like this recipe. I've stopped eating red meats, and I found this to be fulfilling and delicious.

I was skeptical about the ingredients, but I truly enjoyed this chili. I left out the sugar though, and added a bit more cumin, and added finely ground chipotle pepper, an extra cup of water and I got many, many compliments. Quite good! An excellent choice the vegetarian cook!

This recipe was very good. I was trying to recreate the Vegetarian Chili from Fresh Direct and it was pretty close. I did omit the chilis and only used one Tbs. of sugar. Also, I used a 10oz. package of frozen corn so had to add about 8 oz. of water. I would definitely make this again!

Delicious...I used my slow cooker for this, didn't bother to pre-cook the veggies, just threw it all in and cooked on high for about 8 hours. Add a little cayenne to make it a bit hotter. Yum!

This recipe is only average on day 1, but on day 2...watch out! The flavors blend together and it becomes an amazing dish.

Rating: 1
I thought this was average. Basically, to me it tasted like a bunch of vegetables with chili powder dumped on them. Has it not been for the sour cream and cheese, it would have been un-edible. This is the last vegetarian chili I am going to try - I think chili is simply meant to have meat in it.

Rating: 3
Very good recipe. I like a lot of veggies so I added more peppers and bigger chunks of zucchini. I used garbanzo beans in addition to the kidney beans (1 can of each). I also added jalapeno peppers instead of the chiles, definitely made it very hot. I think I would double the recipe next time so I have more to save/freeze.

Rating: 4
I've made this numerous times, and it always delights as a savory, filling, and fresh vegetarian meal. My alterations: omit sugar, add 1 Tbs maple syrup instead, if concerned about the heat (and to build another subtle layer of flavor). Instead of peppers which, if not organic, are farmed with the greatest number of pesticides (ugh), I recently read, so I'll use as much chopped baby bok choy as I can fit in my pot. The little white stalks keep their snap while the greens cook down like escarole or spinach would -- a really delish way to give it some additional green!

Rating: 4
This is easy and delicious. I added one can of drained and rinsed black beans to the mix. It seems to need more cooking time for the vegetables. I also added Cayenne!

I thought this recipe was really horrible. I cut the chili powder down to 4 1/2 Tablespoons and still all I can taste is chili powder. It is an overpowering flavor that would have been better if it had been mixed with some red pepper or something else.

Excellent veggie chili! Served to a strict vegetarian friend who said "I'm going home to toss out my pots and pans!" Definiely eliminate the sugar I used about 1/3 to 1/2 that was called for and it was too sweet. Only use enough tomoato paste to thicken as necessary. I too included a dash of cinnamon and a dash of garlic granules. I also started with five tablespoons of chili powder but added the sixth and it was just right! Very good reheated the next day too.

Great chili recipe. I took other cooks' advice and omitted the tomato paste and sugar. I also added pinto beans and decreased the chili powder by one tsp. It still had quite a bite to it and my family company loved it.

the carnivore liked it! he missed the beef, picked out the squash but he ate it and enjoyed it! i loved it. did not add in tomatoe paste and next time no sugar.

I also was surprised that this recipe is so good. I followed previous suggestions and did not add the tomato paste & sugar and left the veggies a little crunchy. I added a dash of cinnamon and a minced garlic clove. My meat loving husband loved it. Definitely a keeper.

I honestly didn't expect this to be as good as it was. Only made a few slight modifications based on other reviews and not having enough chili powder. Used 1 can kidney. 1 can pinto beans. Iran out of chili powder so used approx 2 tbls regular chili powder and the rest was a Chili Powder Blend by Spice Hunter. I added a diced jalapeno and a bit of cayenne. Didn't use any sugar or tomato paste. Added 1/4 cup of beer. Simmered for about 40 minutes so that vegetables were still a little bit crisp. Really good and I'm a big meat eater.

Rating: 4
This is a seriously delicious vegetarian chili. My variations included using one can of pintos & one can of black beans in lieu of kidney beans. I also left out the tomato paste & sugar, as suggested by earlier reviewers. For spices, I used 3 Tbs. of ancho chili powder, and 2 Tbs. of a Vindaloo mix, since I like heat and I'm not a big cumin fan. I garnished w/ cheddar cheese & lime wedges. There were happy campers at my dinner table tonight!

Delicious! Super easy to make, and it is the perfect dish for winter, when it's easy to eat a lot of unhealthy comfort foods. This was comforting, yummy, and healhful! I made the recipe exactly as it was. It freezes well too.

I made this dish last night for a party of 15 or so people (doubled it) and it was such a hit. The things I did differently from the recipe were using assorted beans (1 can kidney, 2 cans black and 1 can chick peas. I couldn't find the small yellow squash, and my husband doesn't like green pepper, so I used 5 small zucchini, 3 red and 3 yellow peppers. Used only one can of tomato paste and no sugar, and threw a little pale ale in. I forgot the garnishes completely, and it didn't seem to matter to the diners. I would make this again in an instant, and we aren't vegetarian.

This is literally the best chili I've ever had. It is the perfect amount of spice and is as healthy as it is hearty. An added bonus is that this dish - unlike what most chili's can be known for - did not cause bloating or gas in my husband and me. Sorry if that sounds crass, but we felt it was a nice bonus!

Very good recipe and easy to make. Definitely needs the garnishes of sour cream and cheese. Next time I'll probably leave out the sugar and the tomato pasto.

Excellent recipe. Following others suggestions, i cut the tomato paste and sugar in half. Next time, I plan to simmer for only 30-40 minutes for firmer vegetables plus double the cumin and add cayenne pepper for even more spice. This recipe will be my new base for chili.

This was a good recipe. I think I would've preferred a more natural flavor and texture: as someone else noted, drop the tomato paste and sugar. (my tomatoes were sweet enough to cover the flavor, and the paste only gave the chili an artificial texture). thanks for the beer tip. i added some to loosen things up!

This is excellent and will replace my usual veggie chili recipe. I added 4 cloves of garlic and used one tablespoon of brown sugar in place of the 2 tablespoons of sugar called for. Cooked the tomato paste with the veggies to carmelize it a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients.

Delicious chili. I took others' suggestions and added a can of black beans and a fresh chopped jalepeno. and cut the sugar to 1 tbs. The tomato taste was too strong for me, so I added a bottle of beer toward the end and that made it perfect. Next time I may omit or reduce the tomato paste. Served with corn muffins, it was a very satisfying dinner.

This was so easy and so good. The only chanages I made were to use pinto beans and an extra can of chopped green chilies. I did not have 6 tablespoons of chili powder, I just emptied the can. The flavors really came together.

This is a wonderful chili dish. It is much better than the usual meat chili. I usually stay away from vegetarian dishes due to lack of flavor but this one proved me wrong. It is definitely a keeper.

I thought this recipe was wonderful, I didn't change anything beyond leaving out the sugar and adding two fresh jalapeno peppers. Definately don't leave out any of the vegetables, they may seem a little strange but come together really well in the end.

I used black beans as other reviewers suggested. I liked the carrots in the chili much more than I thought I would. My only concern was the amount of chili powder. We like hot, but this was a bit over the top, though mine was "hot chili powder" rather than plain "chili powder" and I used two fresh seeded chilis, so this may account for the extra heat.

Rating: 2
Not the best recipe for vegetarian chili I have seen. I thought the vegetables got too mushy, but I was using a gas stove, so I may have overcooked them. One suggestion: make sure that your chili powder is a good one since it provides most of the flavor.

I added a few ingredients to this recipe that you might enjoy. I purchased a meatless substitute from my local supermarket and I used black beans instead of kidney beans. I also added a little chicken broth flavor, but I'm sure a vegetable broth would work just as well.

I prepared this chili yesterday and followed the recipe to the letter. The chili was delicious! My meat-eating boyfriend and myself are looking forward to the yummy left-overs! When I make it again (no question that I will), I will use half or less than half of the 2 Tbsp. sugar and maybe a dash of cayenne pepper or a chopped jalapeno for a little extra spice. By the way, unless you are feeding some VERY hungry people, this recipe will yield much more than 6 servings.

Rating: 3
Good and very easy to make--I made it on a camping trip! I eliminated the tomato paste and cut back a bit on the sugar, and doubled the amount of green chiles called for. It was very flavorful, warmingly spicy, and filling but light for a chili. My meat-eating boyfriend loved it.

I think I read somewhere that official chili organizations - those that sanction and compete in chili cook-offs - say that chili MUST have meat, and CANNOT contain beans, in order to be called chili. Yeah, I don't give a darn what they say either. Chili is chile, to me. Oh, and I say "unfortunately" for a reason. Ever see the show "King of the Hill"? I'm afraid that family is like about half the families on my block!

I prefer meat in my chili, but you can't beat this dish for getting all your veggies in with great taste! Didn't have any squash or carrots so I substituted two boxes of frozen mixed veggies and it still came out good. Served it over fresh baked corn bread.

We really enjoyed this dish (eventhough my husband always wants to know where the meat is. Ran out of chilipowder so added a chopped chipole chili pepper and a fresh jalapeno. The finish was very spicy but none the lees delicious. It was a little sweet for our taste. Will probably leave out l tb at least of sugar next time. Otherwise, we really liked this chili. Like another review said the different ingred. come together nicely even though they seem strange.

All I can say is: NUMMY! This was a fantastic recipe. I started on Weight Watchers recently and was bemoaning the fact that I wouldn't be able to eat half the recipes on this site then I saw this! It's wonderfully filling, albeit a little thick. If you like it a bit thinner, I would recommend adding a bit of chicken broth during the cooking process. I added chopped portabellos to give it a "meaty" quality. (and for all you WW people, w/o the oil and sugar, it's 16 points for the WHOLE pot!!!!!)

Delicus recipe. Didn't change it much. Substituted the green chilis with canned jalepenos and just used Zuccini. Only used 1 tsp. chili powder and still it was very very hot. Maybe it depends on the type of chilipowder how much you have to use?! Definitely going to make that one again

My husband and I made this chili last evening -- a chilly Sacramento day called for a hearty soup! Made a few modifications -- added garlic, jalapeno pepper and a bottle of spiced pumpkin ale!!

Well, I forgot the green chiles and I didn't have any carrots, so I tossed in some extra zucchini. I substituted black beans instead of kidneys, and I added 5 cloves or chopped garlic. It had to simmer for a couple of hours, so I tossed in a can of beer. It may not be the recipe that was listed, but it was TASTY!

I did not add the green chiles to the chili, but rather kept them as a garnish. I also served chopped cilantro as a garnish, along with the sour cream and the shredded cheese. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, and got several requests for the recipe! It was great chili, and the amount of chili powder was not overpowering; it simply makes it tasty, if a bit darker in color. I will definitly make this again.
