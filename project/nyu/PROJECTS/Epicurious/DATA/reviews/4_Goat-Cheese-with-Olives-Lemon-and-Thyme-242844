Easy, delicious, and beautiful to look at -- what more could one ask for?

Yum! I made this for my annual New Year's Eve party and it was a hit. I doubled the olives (chopped), thyme, and olive oil. I made a goat cheese patty and poured the olive mixture over the cheese and had plenty mixture left to go on the dish around the cheese. Before serving, I placed the whole dish in the microwave for 30 seconds. I will definitely be making this again.

Chopped a mix of olives and made this about 12 hours ahead of time so the flavors could blend...warmed up some goat cheese just a bit, warmed up the olive mix and served it with the rosemary flatbread...BIG HIT!

This recipe really is a "secret weapon". It is impossible to screw it up. With great olives and a good goat-cheese...it is really tasty. I serve it amongst a couple of bowls and serve it with store bought flatbread, crackers and bread. Everyone loves it, it looks pretty and the lemon makes the house smell lovely.

This was simple and delicious. Be sure the cheese is room temp (mine was a little cold). I used store-bought flatbread crackers. Next time I'll try the suggested flatbread recipe.

Easy and absolutely delicious! a perfect entertaining appetizer. All my guests have raved about it, but little do they know, it's the easiest thing I could make. Yumm!

So easy and so good. It takes about 10 minutes to make, and elicits raves every time. Definitely a "secret weapon."

Taste was good. I chopped the olives based on the comments that it made for easier spreading on flatbread. Presentation was not incredibly attractive (just looked like an oily, spec covered cheese log) and it was not a hit at the party. Next time I'll only use a mix of fresh olives available in our deli section to make this.

So easy, so delicious! The warm oil is a nice touch, somehow makes the whole thing seem a little fancier even though it's super simple. My guests liked it too (served with sliced baguette, to spread it on).

This is so easy and it's delicious. The lemon zest is what makes this recipe exceptional. I was in a hurry and didn't have time to heat the olive mix, and it was still wonderful. I've served this 4 times in just 2 weeks.

I love this super-easy recipe and have made it many times. It's simple, quick, has few ingreds. and is a great last-minute appetizer.

We've made this several times, it's always a hit! We used twice the oil called for; worked wonderfully. We usually use an assortment of pitted olives and half them to make it easier to get on the flat bread. Try the flat bread, it's fabulous too!

Wonderful. Made the suggested Rosemary Flatbread. It was perfect.

I have served this a couple of times and although it is a labour of love, it is better when the pit is removed and they are roughly chopped...easier to spread. So even though I try to get a good variety without pits, sometimes I have to remove some pits but it is worth it. I have also added some whole garlic cloves to the mixture and cook them a bit longer than the olives, they are a delicious addition.

This is so good and so easy. Even the people who said they don't like goat cheese thought it was wonderful.

Delicious! My "secret" combination is to pair it with the rosemary lemon zest dutch oven bread on the Williams-Sonoma website. The bread turns out like a crusty artisan loaf, but is pretty easy to prepare. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

This was a hit at Thanksgiving. I chopped some of the olives per other suggestions, and also baked the cheese for just a few minutes to warm it through. Delicious!

This didn't wow anyone. Had much of it left over. Definitely need to chop the olives up for ease of serving. Don't think I'll make it again.

Wonderful, tasty and quick hors d'oevre. I'll definitely be repeating this.

Wow! Seems like a "Duh" combination and I am jealous I didn't think of it first! But Wow! This is such a great presentation. I served it with Camembert. However, any similar cheese would work. I used a combination of cured and marinated olives from a fresh market olive bar but did go through the effort of warming the oil, olives, thin lemon slices and herbs. Not sure it was necessary, however, it was nice to have it slightly warm. I served it with artisan style baguette slices drizzled with olive oil and rubbed with garlic. (what can I say?? I had some extra time!) My goal was to provide a tasty, savory appetizer course at an intimate dinner party. The saltiness, full flavors and the cheese really stimulated appetites! Served with a Shiraz from Argentina! Excellent!

Served this to guests and it was a hit. It's so easy and yet such a nice presentation. Will definitley add to my staple list of apps to serve at gatherings and parties!

Agree with everyone -- surprisingly good -- but do cut up olives a bit before heating, for much easier spreading.

This is awesome! I have made this at least a dozen times. It is really great with the flatbread. A quick and easy recipe that looks and tastes fabulous.

Delicious and super easy when paired with a sliced artisan baguette.

A big success the two times I served it. I think it's better to chop up the olives so that they go on the goat cheese and cracker better.

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!

Super easy and really tasty. This is definitely a keeper for company, especially since it's simple and uses ingredients usually on-hand. I, too, made the flatbread (also really easy), and it paired perfectly.

Wonderful layers of flavors. Heating the olives really brings out their flavor. Perfect with the rosemary flatbread recipe. Perfect size for 4 people.

Used just-picked thyme from the garden, high-quality olive oil and loved the results! So easy and tasty!

This is a keeper! It is a snap to prepare and the flavours are delicious. I used pitted kalamata olives and a sprig of rosemary. We snacked on the goat cheese with toasted baguette slices - delicious!

Made this for friends over the weekend. Served it with the rosemary flatbread from the same article. It looked every bit as beautiful as the photo and the flavor was absolutely wonderful. The lemon and thyme add just the right flavor and aromatics. The flatbread was great too.
