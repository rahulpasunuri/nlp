There should be a bent fork for bad recipes. Who cares if the dressing is emulsified if it tastes like hell? I agree whole heartedly with reviewer jennhill.

If you were to make your own veggie stock, you would be able to control the amount of sodium, and end foolishness.

I'll stick with my heart-healthy olive oil, thanks. Know how much sodium is in veggie stock? This recipe isn't healthy, it's foolish.

It is ridiculous to deprive your body of healthy oils. For about 35 calories, have a tsp of olive oil with some vinegar and dijon mustard. You need to consume fat with your salad to absorb the fat-soluble vitamins in the veggies.
