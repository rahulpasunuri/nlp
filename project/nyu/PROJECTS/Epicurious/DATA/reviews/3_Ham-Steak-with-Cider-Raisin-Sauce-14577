Fortunately I had an organaic smoked piece of ham steak.Wonderful! Anyway I browned the steak in a cast iron pan, flipped it over and placed pineapple slices on top and baked for about a half hour. Liked the sauce as it was not icky sweet and balanced the steak. It took awhile for it to cook down so don't expect an instant boil down.

Disappointing sauce--not enough ginger, not enough flavor, not enough body, and not enough promise to experiment with. I wanted a sauce to make leftover ham slices interesting but this wasn't it.

This recipe was okay, but I'm not sure I would make it again

It's a great alternative to other ham sauces.
