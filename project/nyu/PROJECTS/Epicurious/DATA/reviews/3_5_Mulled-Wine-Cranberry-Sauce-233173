Smells delicious while cooking, and is a sophisticated side that is now a tradition with us. The crystalized ginger really makes it!

This recipe seems like it is based on a November 1998 recipe (not online) which calls for "Fruity" merlot wine and lists allspice instead of nutmeg. That version of the recipe is excellent. I have made it many times since then. This one is probably pretty good too, but consider the 1998 variant.

I used less sugar than the recipe called for, but I like a tart sauce. I also used a non alcoholic mulled wine so it was really flavorful. The recipe made a lot of sauce. Using it on sandwiches is a great idea!

We've been making this for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year since we got the magazine with the recipe in it. Best cranberry sauce ever. Fantastic with leftover turkey and melted Manchego sandwiches the next day!

Quite good. A little tangy yet tasty. Like others, I should have added more sugar.

This was fabulous - I added more 1/4 c. sugar as it was a bit too tart (perhaps it was the wine I chose). Slicing the orange was a challenge & I improvised by peeling the orange membrane from each slice and then reserving the juice. (In a pinch, I suppose a high-quality orange juice could serve as a substitute). Used a cinnamon stick but found that I had less control over the spicy-ness. If you have ginger-phobic guests, I'd recommend using powdered, granulated ginger. I will make this again!

Ended up needing to increase the sugar as it was just too tart/tannic without it, but once adjusted (~50% more brown sugar), it was fabulous. Guests raved at Thanksgiving; will definitely make it again.

Finally -- a sophisticated cranberry sauce that's not cloyingly sweet and doesn't come from a can. I used a Chilean Cabernet, and even though I omitted the ginger by mistake, it was fantastic. The sauce might be too tart for those who prefer their cranberry sauce very sweet, but I found it perfect.

This recipe has been requested over and over again. Looking at some of the reviews regarding the orange segments, how you actually get those is: take a sharp knife and cut stem and opposite ends of orange; cut away the rind and pith; cut between the membranes. It's called a "supreme" cut. Much less time consuming and a bit dangerous since you're cutting a slippery orange in the palm of your hand. :)

My family typically hates cranberry sauce and after making this one for Thanksgiving they have all requested it for Christmas!I think it is destined to be a tradition from now on.

I have made this recipe every Thanksgiving since it was published. The family absolutely loves it!

All my guests agreed last year that this cranberry sauce should replace the old family recipe. Cooking tip: forget the fancy wine search. Use a ruby port instead.

If you like the fragrance of mulling spices, you will love this recipe. I definitely will make this again for Thanksgiving dinner next year.

I used tangerines instead of oranges. It was a delicious accompaniment to our holiday meal.

I thought it was too sour. One taste-tester complained of a 'vinegar' taste. The wine was too overpowering. I made a batch of my regular recipe to serve instead.

We thought this was fabulous - but we did make variations on this. First, we cut the orange segments up more - they were almost shredded and we put them in while the sauce was cooking. I substituted Tawney Port for the wine recommended - my husband likes sweet things and this added more sweetness. We also added a cup of walnut pieces for some extra texture. Finally, I softened a packet of unflavored gelatin in a quarter cup more of wine because found the sauce a bit runny. It was a big hit, EVERYONE loved this - it's a definite keeper!

The best cranberry combo I have had. It kept nicely for a week before using.

this is excellent; a bit different and using 'real' oranges makes all the difference; I will definitely make this again.

I, unlike the previous reviewers, had no trouble and made no variations to this recipe. I found a drinkable (quite nice to my taste), inexpensive Cabernet-Shiraz made by Rosemont Estate, available at almost all liquor stores. I also found that the extire cooking time including bringing the sauce to a boil was only 20 minutes. I also found that peeling the membranes off the oranges was a time-taking task, about half an hour. Maybe I'll find canned oranges next time, instead. A guest repeated multiple times how much she liked it. I gave her leftovers and the recipe.

We did make smaller segments and that was good. I also added sugar which I rarely doo but the orange rind was making a very bold statement. Had to cook extra long too get right consistancy, I think I mioght cut back a bit on the liquid next time.

I enjoyed this variation on a tradition... It is pretty spicy, which may turn some people off, but not too overpowering. I would suggest cutting the orange segments into smaller pieces so that it's not such a mouthful.
