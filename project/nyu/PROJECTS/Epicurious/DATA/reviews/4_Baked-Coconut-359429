I made this recipe three times, once for a potluck (made two batches - it was gone in minutes). It's a delicious - albeit rich - dessert. However, I had to make a few changes. Everyone asks for the recipe, so here are my comments: 1) Where I live, it was impossible to find unsweetened coconut. So I used sweetened and cut back on the sugar - 1/3 instead 1/2 cup 2) I didn't have Malibu, so I used Meyer's Rum. It was delicious, albeit next time I'll try the Malibu because I know it will add more coconutty flavor. 3) The butter type DOES make a difference. I had only one stick of unsalted when I made two batches. So one of them was made with salted butter. The taste was fine, but the texture a little curdy. So make sure you use UNsalted. 4) I live at 8,000 ft ASL, so I had to bake mine for 40 minutes. 5) I used a gratin dish and it was perfect. 6) Serving - Although there are suggestions regarding pairings, such as chocolate, I find it is a rich recipe so even on its own it's great. With Meyer lemons coming out, I'll make some lemon sorbetto next time. Enjoy!

I give it 3 to 3.5 forks. I may not have prepared it perfectly-- so it came out very greasy but tasty. I am in Malaysia-- so I wanted to do smthg with fresh coconut. The simple coconut of it was good. But I had to use margarine not butter. To do it again, I think i wld only use butter and try less of it.

It smelled great baking and was even tastier. I served it as suggested with a lemon sorbet, but we all agreed that a little drizzle of chocolate would be fabulous.

I made this recipe for an Indo-Brazilian dinner. I had never made it before, so I was a little nervous about what the outcome would be. It was a total show stealer. Everyone at the dinner asked for the recipe after wards. I served it with chocolate sorbet instead of lemon.
