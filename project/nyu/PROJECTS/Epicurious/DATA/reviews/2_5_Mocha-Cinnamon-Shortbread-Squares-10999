Even after reducing the baking time to about 20 minutes, they came out burnt and dry. They also made the kitchen smell awful. I think that this is just a bad recipe.

Made some modifications to the recipe first time through. Doubled the recipe and made it in a buttered and floured springform pan -- cut into wedges instead of squares. Cooking time of 45 min. at 350 was just about right. Quadrupled (accidentally) the amount of espresso powder (cappucino powder)and cocoa. Tastes (or tasted!) really good.

I agree with the previous reviewer - 20 minutes was all it really needed, it was so flat. Came out tasting all right. I left out the espresso powder and added a dash of coffee instead. My husband liked them, but I'm not sure they're worth making again.

35 minutes was way too long to cook these. They came out very flat and dry. I might try again, but I'll watch the time carefully and will probably omit the espresso powder - overwhelmed the cocoa and cinnamon, even though I used a strong Vietnamese cinnamon.
