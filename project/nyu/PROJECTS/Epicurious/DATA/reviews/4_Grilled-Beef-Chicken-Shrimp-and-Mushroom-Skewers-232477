powerful taste. I added more garlic and marinated the meats over night. There were no leftovers. Everybody loved it, especially the kids. I'm definitely going to make this again.

A nice easy dinner to make on a Sunday night and eat all week. Didn't have to marinate more than 10 minutes, it was still delicious!

Keep coming back to the marinade even after a couple years - easy and very good.

This was a great quick and easy recipe that really delivered on the presentation factor. Like the earlier reviewer, I added 3 additional cloves of garlic. I was suprised how much food I was able to marinate with what seemed like a small amount of oil. I marinated 4 chicken breasts, 1-1/2 pounds of shrimp, a 1 pound steak and a package of mushrooms. By far, the shrimp were flavored the best. They were unbelievable! Try this for your next bbq ~ it was a really good meal.

This is very easy to make and tastes great with anything! I did add a little more garlic about two cloves.

This was ok. I served it for a dinner party and everyone enjoyed it but it was nothing spectacular. I wouldn't make it again, only because there are other, better recipes on this site.

I use this simple, delicious all purpose marinade a lot. How can you argue with something so tasty and easy?

This is quick, tastes great and looks good. Try it, particulary the shrimp, with the cilantro chutney that you can also find on this website. Love this dish and making it again this weekend!
