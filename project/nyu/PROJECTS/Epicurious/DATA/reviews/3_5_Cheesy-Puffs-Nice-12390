Yummy! I used parmesian, just because that is what I had in my fridge, I spiced it up with some pepper flakes. It was a hit! Very simple to make.

I really liked these, and they were easier than I thought they'd be. I used smoked gouda cheese instead. Delicious. Warmed them up again for breakfast the next day in the toaster! Very nice.
