My chops were 2" thick. Followed recipe to a tee and the chops were over cooked. So next time I'll turn the heat down or cut the time or both. The crumb topping is great.

Wonderful soft taste for the lamb. I used purchased breadcrumbs since I didn't have the day old bread but it came out delicious. Enjoy!

Definitely a great way to do lamb chops indoors, when you can't grill them. I used panko and resisted my usual temptation to tamper with the recipe. Excellent as written.

Quick, easy and delicious! This was great with the gorgonzola polenta from this site. Made exactly as written, good for a weeknight but special enough for company.

Certainly an easy way to let lamb cook without being watched. I suspect, that not having been seared, the lamb lost a bit of its own flavour, but what was added in the crust was very tasty.

Try this! It's increditably easy and would make a impression on guests as well.

This recipe was simple and very yummy.My picky 7 year old even ate it! I have never made lamb before, I would definitely make again. However I did cook the lamb chops a bit longer, for medium done about 40 minutes.

I've been broiling lambchops for years and I was skeptical about roasting them but went ahead with the recipe because of the great reviews. I was not disappointed.....what a great dish...I was quite impressed with the results. So delicious, my husband was licking up the crumbs left on the plate. I used loin chops about one and a half inches thick and they were "medium done" in just 20 minutes so watch the timing.If it weren't for the extra fat and calories in the butter I would make this recipe more often.

This recipe was outstanding and so easy. My butcher cut the chops about 2 inches thick, so I increased the roasting time to 45 minutes at 425 which was perfect. We served it with avocado and hearts of palm salad, aspargus and shitake risotto for a perfect dinner menu.

Our friends invited us to dine with them. They fixed this dish and it was so good I wanted the recipe. I asked her where she got it, so I pulled it up on the computer the next morning!!! How easy to get the recipe and what a wonderful dish to serve!!!

I made this for Easter dinner and we're having it again just a few days later! Such an easy, elegant and flavorful way to prepare lamb. Great recipe, no changes.

This was perfect for a weeknight Valentine's Day dinner -- impressive and delicious, yet didn't keep me in the kitchen for hours after a full day at the office! I served with sauteed spinach with pine nuts and raisins, and some roasted new potatoes. Cupid was pleased!

I've made this twice now for friends and everyone loves it. Very easy for a dinner party because it can essentially be premade and then baked during the salad.

this lamb recipe was great. i loved the flavor and texture of the crust. be sure to pat the chops dry before applying the paste. i salted the chops before applying the paste. everyone at easter dinner raved about the lamb. and by the way... the crab salad which was also in this same layout was too spectacular.
