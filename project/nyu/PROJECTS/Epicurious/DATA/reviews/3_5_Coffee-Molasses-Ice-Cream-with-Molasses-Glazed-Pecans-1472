Great ice cream for our brand new ice cream maker. I halved the molasses quantity but otherwise left the recipe alone. Even my parents who are extremely diet conscious (low fat, low sugar, low cholesterol, etc.) asked for seconds. Adding this to my 'recipe box' and making it again.

I had high hopes for this recipe. I love both coffee and molasses - but the flavors didn't blend well in the ice cream. It was much too strong. The pecans were great all on their own.
