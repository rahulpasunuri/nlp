I read through many of the reviews before using this recipe to bake cupcakes for a coworker's birthday. I followed most of the adjustments suggested, so I used espresso instead of water, reduced vanilla extract to 1 Tbsp, doubled the cinnamon, and added about 1/2 tsp of ancho chile powder. I also added a little bit of almond extract, since Mexican chocolate often has just a hint of almond. After baking the cupcakes for about 23 minutes, these little cakes were perfect. The cake definitely wouldn't have had enough of a kick without the extra spices, but all the adjustments definitely turned this recipe into a 4-star recipe - complex taste, not overly sweet, and very delicious. Also, instead of mixing pecans into the glaze, I spread the glaze over the cupcakes and sprinkled the tops with pecans for a prettier finish.

I did as others advised, increasing cinnamon and decreasing vanilla. The cake's texture was great, but I did not like the flavor. It was neither a chocolate nor a spice cake -- kind of bland even with the chocolate icing I added. Hint for easy removal from pan: Mix 1 T cocoa and 1 T melted butter. Use a pastry brush to spread this mixture all over the inside of the pan. Cake comes out easily without leaving any behind.

I have made dozens and dozens of recipes from this website and although most have been excellent, this is my first review. I just had to share how excellent this cake is! If you love chocolate, this is the cake for you. I didn't make one change (except cooking time was 40 mins). It was so incredibly moist. Not sure why one reader's glaze came out lumpy... mine was smooth and oh so good. The recipe does make more glaze than you need, but you can serve it on the side. It is actually more of a ganache than a glaze. Either way it is amazing. This recipe has found a permanent spot in my repertoire!

This cake is really easy to make and is very good. I make it for by bf every year for his birthday because it's such a hit. The frosting is pretty messy and not pretty since it's so chunky, but it's super tasty.

I have given this recipe too many chances. I think I have tried to make it 5 times using different methods and pans and it has stuck in the pan every time. Leaving me with a crumbled cake to try make something into. While the Mexican Chocolate Trifle was tasty I really would have preferred to have it in its intended purpose.

Ah, what to review. The cake tasted great, but tore coming out of the pan... twice! The first time, I replaced half the water with kahlua, and even though my testers came out clean, when I went to invert it, after cooling 20 minutes in the pan, the tore horizontally into irreperable pieces. It looked like a vein of unmixed-in liquid, so I thought that must have been the problem. I re-read the reviews and since no one else had trouble, I tried the recipe again, this time following exactly except for doubling the cinnamon. Same thing happened! This time, I was able to stack the pieces back together enough to glaze and serve, and guests enjoyed the flavors, but it was very frustrating and I will not make it again.

Fabulous cake! We use this recipe at our 2 restaurants and it is one of our best selling desserts. Make cake according to directions (can use plain yogurt in place of buttermilk without any change to outcome). We omit the nuts in the ganache and serve it with fresh berries...also great with fresh pineapple or pineapple gelato.

I suppose I should have given this recipe three forks instead of four, because the cake I made used all the modifications listed in the reviews below (thanks, everyone!). But with the modifications ... good Lord, what a cake! Moist, chocolatey, wonderfully spicy, and absolutely delectable. And so very easy to make! Excellent.

Loved this cake. I followed a few of the modifications from other reviewers: used coffee instead of water, halved the vanilla, doubled the cinnamon. I didn't add the cayenne because I didn't know how the 6 yr olds at the potluck would react. Instead of the glaze, I served it warm with creamy vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and cinnamon.

This is a wonderful cake, especially if you make it a day or two before serving. I am not much for frosting or sweet glaze so I sprinkle some sifted powdered sugar on it instead. It makes a nice presentation especially for the holidays.

One more thing I forgot - I omitted the pecans and sprinkled a handful of raspberries on each slice when I served it. The tart of the berries really complemented the sweet of the cake. YUM.

After reading all the reviews, I made this cake today for the first time for my "girls' night". 8 women who love their chocolate and they loooooved this recipe. I did modify it like the others - used the coffee instead of water, reduced the vanilla, increased the cinnamon and added cayenne. I have to say it was one of the best cakes I have ever eaten. And every single person there wanted me to to email them the recipe TONIGHT.

If you like moist, rich chocolate -- this one's for you! I made this cake today for my husband's birthday and it came out perfectly. I have a Bosch electric oven and 44 minutes (preheated) was exactly right. I followed the suggestions others' made, using two teaspoons of cinnamon, a generous pinch of cayenne and 1/4 c. Half & Half with 1/4 c. of Kahlua. The recipe makes more than enough glaze... which doesn't come out like many glazes -- it's very thick and rich, almost like a fudgy topping. If you use the three suggested alterations, it'll be worth 4 forks!

Rating: 3
Just a side note, I made it again within the week! The first go, I lost a good chunk of cake in the pan so the second time around, I let it cool for a couple hours in the pan (which was suggested in another chocolate bundt recipe on this site) and didn't lose a crumb. Reheated the cake before serving and added the glaze, it didn't lose any moisture! And I found for my oven, 38 minutes was perfect.

Rating: 3
This was SO good, and everyone loved it at my girls night. I used all the modifications, I like spicy but for a cake 1/2 t.(not even 1 t that someone mentioned) cayenne was a little much, I think next time I'll use 1/4 t. for a little "something". I used milk in the glaze because it was what I had, and thought it was still good! One change that I think elevated this cake to absolutely delicious was using the coffee instead of the water, it just brings out an extra chocolatey taste! I wouldn't miss this switch!

I followed the suggestions of the previous reviews, cut vanilla down to 1 tablespoon and increased cinnamon to 2 tsp. I also used strong coffee in place of the water. Because this was going to be served at a buffet I put the sause in a bowl on the side and let people drizzle it on thier slice. delicious!

This recipe is excellent. I made it for our "gourmet" group, and they all raved about how moist and good it was. It's easy to do too! I will definitely make it again. I didn't pour the glaze over the cake but spooned it over each piece just before serving. I think this cake is best warm even if you have to reheat it in the microwave for a few seconds.

This cake was good with amendments to the recipe (coffee instead of water, and double the cinnamon). However, it was a bit dry (baked it for about 45-50 minutes...the cake tester kept coming out with liquid chocolate attached). Next time, will try a metal rather than silicone pan. I made a chocolate ganache with equal parts of cream and bittersweet chocolate which nicely complemented the cake.

I made this cake for a dinner party and it was fantastic. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and substituted coffee for water, doubled the cinnamon, halved the vanilla and added three dashes of cayenne pepper to the mix. It took 40 minutes to bake and turned out great. I didn't have bittersweet chocolate so I used semi-sweet for the glaze. It was a little too sweet for my taste but the kids loved it. Overall, a great dessert and I will be making it again.

Mexican chocolate cakes are kinda my specialty and this one was a huge hit. I added additional cinnamon and a little cayenne, as others suggested. And I sprinkled the pecans on top of the cake instaed of mixing them in. The cake and icing were both delicious and easy to make. Sitting on a cake doily it looked professional. Great!

I think I must have used nearly every modification mentioned in previous reviews. The cake came out spicy, moist, rich, and delicious.Only 3 forks just because it really needed all of these modifications. Here is the comprehensive modification list: For cake: 3/4 cup espresso or coffee instead of water; only 1 tablespoon vanilla; increase cinnamon to 1 heaping teaspoon; add 1 heaping teaspoon cayenne (use less if you don't like a little spice); For glaze: I used a little less than 1.5 cups of pecans and it was plenty; use 1/4 cup half-and-half and 1/4 cup kaluah; add cayenne & cinnamon to taste. Also, I only cooked it for about 36 minutes

This recipe is a keeper!I served it as a finish to a Latin themed dinner party and it was a hit. I only made a couple of slight changes to the original recipe inspired by other user reviews.I used a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and added a few dashes of cayenne pepper. Next time I make this cake I might even venture out to find a stronger spicier cinnamon. The spice and the dark chocolate compliment each other so nicely! Also I substituted some Kahlua in for the half and half for the topping. Delicious!

I don't particularly care for cake, I rarely ever bake them. But my son really wanted cake for his birthday so I chose this one. Took the advice posted here to use coffee, increase cinnamon, and a pinch of cayenne, and it was fabulous. I used a silicone bundt pan, sprayed with Pam and dusted with cocoa powder (instead of flour). This is one really delicious cake, and I will make it again, very soon.

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe, everyone raved! I did use more cinnamon (a bit less than 1 tsp) and I thought it tasted like the perfect amount. I did stick with water not coffee (to let the cinnamon stand out), and after baking it for 45 minutes the tester was clean, so I took it out, but when I tried to pop it out of the bundt pan quite a bit got stuck :( No one could tell because of the glaze, but maybe be very generous greasing the pan. The texture was perfect though, almost fudgy, so I would watch carefully it doesn't get overcooked.

Rating: 4
This cake is fabulous! Quite decadent especially since I used high quality chocolate. Had a dinner party for 8 people and we still had cake leftover as we had really small slices since it was so rich. Everyone was really happy that they got to take some home. A keeper! Head the suggestions in the reviews and double the cinnamon, cook only 38 minutes and decrease the nuts. I used cold coffee in lieu of the water for a little extra kick.

Brought this cake to a Mexican themed dinner party and received raves. The glistening nut encrusted exterior made an intriging presentation and the exceptionally moist interior was rich but not cloyingly sweet. As per pervious reviews I doubled the cinnamon to a heaping teaspoon and used coffee instead of water in the cake. Baked exactly 40 minutes. For the glaze, I replaced about a third of the half and half with Kaluha. Definately toast the nuts and use a good quality bittersweet chocolate - in my case used Merkins. Excellent cake.

Rating: 3
Took the advice of other reviewers and subbed espresso for water, bumped up the cinnamon and added cayenne. Other reviewers mentioned the faint spice flavor, so I added cinnamon and cayenne in the glaze too. Made a big difference. 3 forks because I tweaked the heck out of the original recipe. But with adaptions (more flavor) it's a 4 forker, for sure!

Rating: 4
Fabulous and easy. I took previous suggestions and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and reduced vanilla to 1 T. and used leftover coffee in stead of water. The cake was moist and everyone loved it. Used a springform bundt,well buttered and dusted with cocoa.. no sticking. Satisfying and dense flavor without being too sweet.I will make this cake forever!

I love this recipe. It is easy and relatively inexpensive to make, and always comes out delicious and nicely consistent, even when I botch steps. I spice the cake up with a little cayene pepper (the New Orleans way) in the batter, which completely compliments the chocolate and cinnamon, and add a little rum to the glaze (the New Orleans way), which compliments the chocolate, cayanne and cinnamon. This is a definate crowd please. Everyone always wants seconds, thirds...so I double the recipe and bake it in a lasagna pan. My guests usually hover around the cake until it is gone. When I invite my friends over for a party they always ask me if I am going to make "that chocolate cake" (or the milk chocolate toffee crunch cake).

Rating: 2
Changes: used coffee instead of water, 1 heaping teasp. cinnamon, used milk mixed with oj instead of buttermilk, added about a 1/4 cayenne; in glaze I used sliced almonds instead of pecans. Baked for about an hour. The result was very moist, nice crumb. The glaze was a bit too salty (salted butter) but hung together beautifully and clumped in a delicious fashion on top of the bundt. The mexican element was barely tasted if at all. If I make it again I will kick up the cinnamon and cayenne into the tablespoon and 2 teaspoon realms respectively. I also dashed some serious chili pow into the glaze to no effect.

Rating: 4
This turned out Great!!! I was a little worried that 1/2 tsp cinnamon wouldn't be enough, and it's true that the cake wasn't at all cinnamon-y, but what the cinnamon did add was a sort of subtle warmness to the cake not present in a regular old chocolate cake. I have already promised to make it again!

Taste: like cake brownies w/ cinnamon. Too ordinary. Tried it as a bundt cake first and it stuck to buttered/floured non-stick pan. I may have overcooked, but tried the second time as cupcakes-- just in case. 20 minutes @ 325-350. Made 2 doz. Topped with orange zested cream cheese frosting, sprinkled glassy sugar flakes, and stuck a chocolate star upright on top in attempt to dress-up the lowly cupcake. Yawn.

Just made this cake again this year for my husband's birthday. It was fantastic. Very moist and rich chocolate flavor with a hint of cinnamon. The glaze with the pecas and bitter sweet chocolalte was excellent! I did use a combo of plain homemade yogurt with some organic heavy cream instead of buttermilk. It's also a quick and easy cake!

I would make the cake again, but I'm not sure about the pairing of the glaze with the cake. It made it too sweet and something was missing from the flavor of the glaze. I think that this might make a good layer cake, too -- perhaps with an orange buttercream frosting. Like others, I added more cinnamon, and some cayenne. I used four dashes, I think next time I'd use two or three. I also added espresso powder to the water when I made it -- there's very few chocolate things I make where I don't add some coffee flavors.

Rating: 2
I decided to follow some of the suggestions given by the reviewers, such as, to add espresso, more cinnamon (3/4 tsp.) and less vanilla extract. I thought it tasted too much like cinnamon and I would have preferred the cake to be sweeter than with a mocha flavor. If I was to make the same cake, I would probably do a layered cake with a cream cheese filling and frosting, to give it a sweeter taste. But, I think that next time, I will just follow the recipe as written.

Great recipe. Easy, moist, chocolatey, and delicious! Definitely add more cinnamon. Per other reviews I added to the glaze and it still not even tasteable. This cake would take well to any of your favorite flavorings. I would try with espresso, Grand Marnier, Chambord, or even with Kirsch and cherries for a black forest-like cake.

Just made this cake for the 3rd time this month! Really simple, and a hit with the chocolate lovers. It's nice and moist but not sweet.

This is a great recipe because you can't ruin it. I did almost everything wrong and it still turned out pretty good. I didn't have good chocolate so I used a sweetened cocoa mix with one cup sugar. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2% milk with some vinegar. I added some instant coffee, doubled the cinnamon and while baking I somehow inadvertantly turned off the oven allowing the cake to cool down. When I realized my mistake I turned it back on. I am not sure how long the cake was in there but I think 40 mins. I didn't have pecans so I used pine nuts and no I didn't have powdered sugar, substituted cocoa mix for the glaze. Surprisingly, it was very good. I had to give it three forks for determination to be good despite all.

Though considerably more expensive than baking a cake from a box, this cake is beyond considerably better to eat than a cake from a box! The consistency of the cake is moist and rich, and the chocolate flavor is strong without being too sweet, predictable or overwhelming. The glaze adds a special "umph" that is sure to please everyone! I've made the cake twice now for special occasions at my job, and my coworkers have all raved about it. It's not tough to make, so go for it - and you'll have a cake recipe in your arsenal that will wow the recipient!

Very delicious and not difficult to make. I followed the suggestion to use coffee instead of water and I think that was a good idea. Toasting the nuts is crucial - do not skip that step!I had to bake and freeze the cake (without glaze)for several days and it froze really well. I glazed it before taking it to a dinner party. It got rave reviews, with 2 of the guests claiming it was the best cake they'd ever had! I am making it again for another party.

My husband will not stop raving about this cake. I substituted coffee for the water, used 1 1/2 T of vanilla, 1/4 t of cayenne pepper, 3/4 t of cinnamon. I checked it after 38 minutes and it was definitely done. The cake was very easy to make and I think that the icing adds something. I am planning on making again for my father's birthday.

This cake is delicious and was easy to make - no mixer required. It is rich, moist and dense and makes an impressive presentation when it is glazed. Thanks to the hints from other reviewers, I added about 1 tsp. of expresso powder to the batter and about another 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. Used Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate (that's what I had on hand), added 1 tsp. vanilla and a little expresso powder and about 1 1/4 cups of pecans (more than enough) for the glaze. Goes well with vanilla ice cream and a big glass of milk.

Very good texture. I baked about 5-10 minutes less than suggested and used 1/2 less flour. I also added the cinnamon to the chocolate on the stove-top. Will try adding additional spices per previous reviews next time I make it. For the topping, the pecan pieces should've been chopped more finely but still very good. I made it for my mom's 70th birthday and she loved it, which is all that matters!

This cake only took 40 minutes to bake and possibly could have been taken it out a few minutes earlier. I doubled the cinnamon, but might put a bit more next time. Also added 1/4 tsp of cayenne, used diluted espresso for the water, and added instant espresso and cinnamon to the glaze. Very satisfying and easy; I'll definitely make this one again!

It was incredibly dense. I used 1/2 the vanilla, 2x the cinnamon and added a pinch of cayenne, pinch of ground cloves and chocolate chips. I didn't make the glaze, I just made a simple ganache to pour over. overall, the flavor was great, the texture was ok. I baked it a bit too long. Everyone thought is was good (I thought is was a tiny bit overbaked, but icecream masked that ok.)

I liked the icing, but the cake was a bit dry. I might have baked it too long (make sure you don't do this!), but it was just okay. Perhaps adding cinnamon schnapps or extract would help. It seemed like it needed something more.

This cake was very well received. While making it, I thought the glaze was overkill as did others while eating it, however, there were many, especially the chocolate lovers that thought otherwise.

I have made this recipe twice so far. Once for a baking contest at work...I lost because I baked it for 7 minutes too long and it turned out dry. But, coworkers loved the sauce. I tried it again for a Mother's Day gift to my mom, and it arrived moist and flavorful even after I mailed the cake across the United States. She added whipped cream and fruit garnish when it arrived. My suggestion: add two tablespoons of cinnamon schnapps to both the batter and the sauce along with an extra teaspoon of cinnamon.

Like others, I wish I had read the reviews before I made this. Definitely increase the cinammon - its flavor is unrecognizable as written. I used semi-sweet chocolate in the frosting and felt it was too sweet - would use bittersweet next time. And yes, I would decrease the amount of nuts to 1-1 1/2 cups. But overall, very tasty and relatively quick and easy. My guests loved it.

Very good! I made this to take to a dinner. I didn't have cocoa powder, so I substituted unsweetened chocolate and took out some butter (following a substitution table), and I didn't have buttermilk so I used sour cream. I used coffee for the water, as another poster suggested. Other than that I followed the recipe, and the cake turned out great. The people at the dinner loved it. It was rich and moist.

I tried making this cake twice. Both times, i didn't think it tasted that special. Also, this cake comes out overly moist and half of it stays behind in the cake pan.

This cake was fantastic! I substituted coffee instead of the water, and doubled the cinnamon. Next time, I wouldn't quite double the cinnamon, but I'd still use more than the recipe called for.

It still turned out great, and I got lots of compliments!

This is a wonderfully moist, rich cake! The comments from the cooks questioning the amounts of vanilla & pecans were interesting -- 2 T of vanilla seemed excessive to me, too, but I took the plunge on a friend's advice and was happy with the flavor. Re: pecans, 1 cup probably would have been enough. Possible tweaks: increase cinnamon; decrease vanilla and add a proportional amount of almond extract; substitute strong coffee (i.e. French roast) for some or all of the water. I also added a tiny bit of dark rum to the glaze. Maybe next time I'll try Kahlua!

I made cupcakes (makes ~20) baked for 25 minutes. I should have followed the advice and increased the cinn. Also used only 1 cup of nuts in the frosting and placed one half pecan on the top of each cupcake for garnish. They are good, but not the best chocolate cake.

We found that the cake was on the verge of being overbaked at 45 minutes. Were I to make it again, I'd check it at 40 minutes. Also, I found it hard to believe that the ingredients called for 2 TABLESPOONS of vanilla. Having only put in half of that amount, and finding the cake somewhat overly sweet, I can't help but think that perhaps the correct amount is 2 TEASPOONS. Anyone have any response to this? Also, as others suggest, 1 cup of chopped nuts is more than enough. I guess I'd only make this again, if I could figure out a way to make it less sweet. Ideas from others would be appreciated.

Excellent recipe. Extremely moist.

This cake was excellent for a relatively simple recipe. Baked in a tube pan it was moist, but not dense and the basic glaze was perfect. I made no changes, but would probably add more cinnamon next time. I suspect it would also make stellar cupcakes.
