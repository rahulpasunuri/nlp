Considered very good by two non-vegetarians. Added snap peas and used red cabbage in the veggies. Added 1 tbsp of chili-garlic sauce and a bit of soy. Also mixed in some pan-fried tofu at the end. Served over jasmine rice.

Like other reviewers, I like that this stir-fry does not use the usual soy sauce base. It has a light, clean taste and uses just about any veggies you have in the fridge. I, too, doubled the sauce, used half the salt called for, and then used soba noodles and sliced pork to make it a heartier main, one-dish meal.

i love this recipe. the sauce is so light and so tasty. i use different vegetables every time and it works great. i too double the sauce. and would agree that it's more like 2-3 servings.

This was a really good dish. It ended up being a little salty so next time I will either decrease the salt or double the veggies & other sauce ingredients. Also, it says that it yields 4-6 servings but we felt it was more like 2- 3.

Easy to make and customize! I used just the mushrooms with carrots and green beans - lovely.

I didn't have nappa, so I used red chard; coarsely sliced the leaves and julienned the stems, which I cooked with the carrots; makes a very pretty dish. Lots of prep time, but worth it. Definitely use fresh shiitake mushrooms if you can get them. I'm actually considering buying a mandoline after making this recipe.

surprisingly good as is or embellished. like the last few cooks, i added extra veggies. the only substitution, though, was a packet of splenda instead of the sugar, which worked well.

A bit of work slicing the veggies but definitely worth it. I got a little crazy with the choice of vegetables, adding broccoli, cauliflower, orange and yellow peppers, snap peas, and whole button mushrooms as well as the shiitake. This recipe can handle any vegetable, it seems like. The flavors were fresh (even though I forgot to toss in the garlic and ginger) and the vegetables bright and slightly crisp. Very nice choice to serve with the Chinese Chicken Breast with peanuts,Chinese Fried Rice Deluxe and topped off with Coconut Icemilk with Lime and Ginger.

I added more vegetables - zucchini and broccoli - and doubled the sauce recipe. I was worried it would be bland so added a tablespoon each of teriyaki sauce and chili sauce. It was spicy and delicious!

This stir fry sounds very plain, but it came out SO tasty. We added a bunch of vegetables for variety, so we also doubled the sauce (but not the salt). We added string beans, zucchini, sliced onions, peanuts and sesame seeds, and substituted red cabbage. It was very flavorful, and colorful--because we used red cabbage, the sauce turned a little purple. Yum!

Nice variation from the usual soy sauce-based stir fry. Only had chicken broth, so I substituted that, and stir fried in a little yellow onion with the carrots, as I didn't have any scallions. I added some canned bamboo shoots and sesame seeds during the last minute or so and garnished with peanuts. The additions earn this recipe a fourth fork. It will go on permanent rotation.

This has a tasty light sauce that is a refreshing change from the usual soy stir-fry sauces. I added bean sprouts and sesame seeds. Delicious over Jasmine rice!

I loved this recipe! I added daikon, julienned, but other vegetables could be added or substituted without sacrificing flavor. The shiitake mushrooms gave this stir-fry an exceptional flavor. I have saved this dish to my recipe box.

I've already made this recipe several times. It's easy to prepare and delicious. I served it with the Spicy Peanut Sauce (elsewhere on this site) and it was a wonderful and popular combination.

Great flavor. I used different vegetables than the ones in the recipe. I would try it again.

I made this dish for a friend who is a vegetarian, and although I'm not a big vegetable eater, I fell in love with this recipe. It was fast, easy to make, and absolutely delicious. The blend of flavors and colors was incredible.
