The fritters were tasty, with a nice light texture. However, when mixed as written, batter (no way was this a "dough") was too thin (yes, I used large eggs), so I had to add about 50 percent more flour. Sauce was nice, but not much orange came through the brown sugar and cinnamon flavors

These were great! Just a note for any fritter beginners like myself...make sure you leave them in the oil until they're really quite brown. The first batch or so I removed a little too soon, and they were soggy.

Fun & easy to make and really delicious. My 85 year old grandmother said, "I've had alot of fritters in my life, but these are by far the best." I couldn't agree more. They are so light, they practically float. Save the rest of the syrup - its great over waffles & pancakes. yum!

I don't think the syrup would last much longer than a weekend, because of the orange juice- you know how icky old o.j. is. I spent four years in culinary schools, but never heard of anyone saving pate a choux paste. I think it's worth a try, though... You may want to put it back in the mixer the next day and beat it until it gets back to fresh consistency and temp.

First time I've ever made any sort of fritter and this was close to fool-proof and delicious. Two questions for anyone who might know: I agree the syrup is fabulous--any idea how long it will keep? Also, is it possible to make and refrigerate the batter the night before?

I ran out of pancake syrup and made this syrup recipe. My kids loved it. How long does the syrup keep as I would like to be able to keep some for the next time?

To the cook from Alamagordo: The four eggs create the "puff". Also, I use way less oil with good results. Cheers!

I love all the sweets and savouries that can be made with pate choux, including this one. The syrup is delicious and the leftovers were great on coconut ice cream. A final word to the cook from Alamogordo, the eggs are the leavening and you most likely could get away with less oil if you used a wok.

The fritters are essentially choux pastry which always puffs up. Could you bake them instead of frying?

The Cinnamon Orange Syrup sounds very good. I have a few questions about this recipe. 1) Can one fry the fritters in less oil?; 2)What is going to make the fritters triple in size, as there is no leavening ingredient in this recipe? A response would be appreciated.
