These are by far one of the best brownies I have ever made! They certainly are fudgy, so those looking for a dryer, cake-like brownie should look elsewhere. For those fudgey-chocolate lovers out there, these brownies hit the spot. The icing wasn't as smooth as I expected although it was delicious, any suggestions for a better texture? Thanks :)

that looks 10x more delicious than the original!

Thought that the PB frosting was darn good. I had Trader Joes Truffle brownie mix on hand and used it...good ingredients and perfect combo of fudgey and cakey. Next time I will try this brownie recipe.

I just have write a reveiw because I can't believe the negative comments. I've made these at least a dozen times, my husband is crazy about them and begs me not to try any new! Whenever I make them for a crowd, everyone absolutely raves. The sweet frosting is a great compliment to the semi-sweet chocolate, creates a very sophisticated flavor.

These was some bomb brownies. I was all "heyyyyy" and everyone was lovin them yaaa. I will certainly make these many more times.

Great brownie recipe, though they come out almost like candy. I think maybe add a Tbsp or two more flour. Made them with 3/4 cup flour the second time and they were too cakey. Haven't tried the frosting at all because they are wicked rich as is.

The brownies were great, but the frosting left a lot to be desired. I like my frosting to be more sweet and this just tasted like I spread peanut butter right from the jar onto the brownies.

I have made this several times. It is fudgy-style brownie. It always goes over very well. Use a quality chocolate. My oven needs 2 extra minutes to bake.

Not very good. I know that brownies with icing need to be less sweet, but these were awful. Icing was ok.

Too fudgy. I do not like things overly sweet, but these were bitter. The frosting was ok.

I love this recipie! I made it for a potluck at my church, and the brownies were all gone in less than 5 minutes! This is, without a doubt, one of the best dessert recipies I have ever come across.

I cannot believe I wasted 9oz of good chocolate in this recipe. No one but my son and a friend could eat them (and teenage boys will eat almost anything called dessert!). While I knew they would be fudgy based on the reviews, these tasted like just a blob of chocolate with peanut butter. Had a very odd texture too, very gritty like cocoa powder, disgusting! I've never met a chocolate dessert that I could not eat until this.....

these were so good that my hubby packed them up and took them to work and all his buddies ended up taking them from him. i do prefer fudgy brownies, if i wanted a cake brownie i would make chocolate cake. the frosting is great too and since the whole thing is quite easy to make, you may as well try them.

This is a fast and easy recipe. These brownies were excellent and fudgy, the peanut butter frosting is a nice touch. I made it for Teacher Appreciation day in our school and they were gone fast.I definitely will make it again.

Perhaps this recipe should indicate that it is a fudge type brownie. The negative reviews seem to come from people with a preference for cake type brownies. Baking powder and or soda in the ingredient list and more flour are indications of a cake brownie.

I really enjoyed these brownies. Very easy to make and yummy to boot! I added walnuts to my batch and didn't make the frosting. As it turned out, they were great without it. Will frost them next time as I'm sure that there will definitely be a next time.

Rating: 3
This was so yummy! Everyone enjoyed them. The only thing I would do differently would be to put a little less frosting on the brownies because the frosting flavor is strong and overpowers the yummy brownies if you have too much on it. Just a thin layer of the peanut butter would be sufficient.

I made these for a baby-shower, and the guests gobbled them up! They were really easy to make too. The peanut butter is a nice touch.

I didn't like these brownies at all. They tasted too bitter even though I used semisweet chocolate and not bittersweet. The frosting was good, but didn't complement the flavor of the brownies.

I've made these brownies three times without the frosting and think they are wonderful. I would love to make the frosting but they are so good on their own.

These brownies were excellent!! I love chocolate and peanut butter together. I don't understand the bad reviews either. The brownies are fudgy and good with out the frosting too. The frosting is a nice addition.

These are wonderful! Very rich, and the "browine" has more of a fudge-like texture, but who cares? They are great. Have made them twice in the last week and a half. I would suggest using a slightly smaller pan.

Threw away entire batch. They were terrible. Frosting ws good but so is plain peanut butter.

These are excellent fudgy brownies. I dont understand any of the negative reviews. The frosting is not too sweet, but does make the brownies very rich. I've also added salted peanuts to the batter to add a little extra saltiness and crunch.

Although the brownies were very dense, it was really more like fudge. Didn't look anything like the picture BTW. Peanut Butter frosting way too sweet for my taste. My two teenagers loved them, but I think there are better recipes out there.

This is a brownie? It was so dense - like fudge. Very disappointed after all the rave reviews. I didn't even bring them to work. BTW, I followed the directions to a 'T'.

Thank you for the suggestion of cooling the batter before baking - I'll try that next time! I didn't care for the frosting. May try to tweak it a little to make it work. But the brownies were WONDERFUL! And, Georgia, even our friend Paula Dean would admit that a homemade brownie blows the socks off of any boxed mix.

Rating: 3
great recipe...my tip for brownies: make the batter earlier and stick in the fridge prior to baking (don't use a glass dish) until cold...then place directly into a hot oven...the top will come out glossy, the brownies chewy...yum...=)

We enjoyed these brownies but the peanut butter frosting tasted too much like ordinary Skippy peanut butter spread on top. I added more confectioner's sugar to make the frosting sweeter. These come out very thin and I think that next time I will use a smaller pan for thicker brownies (adjusting baking time of course) and use either no icing or a chocolate icing.

For those who wonder why someone would bother with homemade brownies when a mix is "just as good" (and I don't for a minute believe brownies from a mix are nearly as good as homemade, but we'll assume that for the sake of argument), first homemade brownies take just a few minutes longer than box brownies. They are one of the quickest baked treats to make. Second, have you read the ingredient list on a brownie mix lately? I don't know what half those things even are. I like to know what I'm eating, and when I make homemade brownies (which is at least twice a month) I know they have chocolate, butter, eggs, sugar, flour, and vanilla in them. And they are very quick and very yummy!

Reeeediculously delicious brownies. Luxuriously rich and luscious. These are the best brownies I've ever eaten.

These are the best brownies I have ever tasted. They are fudgy, so look elsewhere if you like cakey brownies. Everybody who tasted them told me they are exactly what they look for when they crave brownies, and that the frosting was simply an added treat. I didn't change a thing from the recipe. This recipe is easy, and beats box brownines any day. By the way, if you need a box brownie, go for Ghirardelli. They beat Duncan Hines or anything else hands down.

These were great. The peanut butter frosting elevates them far above a brownie from a mix. Made them for a large barbecue party, everyone loved them, not one left. Very moist and tasty and lining the pan with foil did make the task far easier.

Rating: 3
These are really tasty. But, they aren't any better, in my opinion, than a box of Duncan Hines brownies. Why take the extra time for "as good as a box."

A little bit of brownie heaven - nice and fudgy. The frosting had a light peanut butter flavor, nothing overwhelming. I didn't alter the recipe in any way.

Delicious! Rich, fudgy brownies with a perfectly sweetened pb frosting. I would definitely recommend this recipe to others.

Loved these - - very rich and fudgy - - and we thought the frosting was perfect as is. I do think, though, that the recipe must be in error only calling for 1/2 cup flour. My end result did not look anything like the picture which showed a more cake-like consistency. All in all, we've put these on our family's "repeat list!"

I make this dessert all the time. Be warned before you make them: these cupcakes are not beautiful. I usually don't frost them, because so many people think the frosting is too rich. It's easy enough to leave the frosting on the side in a pretty bowl and let people butter their cupcakes. When I do this, I substitute 1/2 cup peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips added at the end. Love this substitution.

Like the other reviewers, I also thought the brownies were a bit dense. The frosting was very thick so I thinned it out with some milk. My husband loved them - we are going to try it with vanilla ice cream tonight!

I made these brownies with my 13-year old son. They were quick enough to keep his attention and he loves the frosting. Definitely would do it again.

The brownies by themselves were pretty good - nice and fudgy. Even though my kids liked the frosting, I found it too thick and almost chalky. It actually tasted more like peanut butter fudge than frosting.

I think there was an error in this recipe; there was no mention of baking powder which I thought was odd. Because of that, my brownies came out flat, unlike the picture in the magazine. The peanut butter frosting wasn't all that great either.

Rating: 2
I also agree this was a little fudgey which is not what the picture looked like in the magazine. I am a fudge lover but was hoping for a more cakey outcome. The frosting was very nice. I also used half splenda and half sugar which I thought made it more fudgey but it appears others had the same outcome. Will definately make frosting again, but would use a different brownie batter.

My kids loved this recipe, but it was just a little too rich and fudgey for me, a cake brownie fan. The peanut butter frosting was yummy! I used low-fat, no-salt peanut butter and it came out perfect. Definitely a kid-pleasing recipe!

I love trying new brownie recipes and this one is a winner! They are extremely fudgy with just the right amount of frosting. However, mixing the eggs and sugar at high speed is a potential kitchen cleanup disaster so I recommend covering your mixer with a flour sack towel while it mixes.
