The ingredients make this more similar to panna cotta than to flan. I have never seen a flan recipe that does not have eggs, and this does not really have a "flan" consistency. Which is not to say it's not good, I just would not call in flan!!

I made this for a neighbor who is on a lowfat diet and although I am neither a fan of mango or flan, I had a lot of seasonal oranges and was intrigued by the prospect of using up some of them. I used canned mango (since I do not like buying fresh fruit from overseas), drained and pureed in the blender. I added greek yogurt instead of buttermilk and no sugar at all. After reading the other reviews, I decided to put the flan in individual souffle dishes in case it did not set up. Rather than turn them out, I just served them with sliced oranges on top- no 'salad'. It was awesome and it felt so good to eat a healthy desert that was filling and satisfactory. Can't wait to experiment with other fruit combinations in this recipe.

maybe mine worked well because I didn't use low fat buttermilk, but this recipe was fabulous. I think you could probably get away with using half a vanilla bean if you are stingy with your $5 a bean jar.

Since Mangos are a favorite in my home, I am always looking for ways to use them. This dish is easy to make, tastes great, and is healthy. I have made it several times now and always get compliments. Instead of the oranges and mango salad, I place aroung the flan fresh mango slices with cinnaman or ginger.

I've made this several times. Great every time. I don't strain it. I put it in a 8+8 pan.Didn't use the sauce or salad. Used pureed raspberry sauce or strawberry sauce. Everyone loves it. I used whole fruit and mint leaves for garnish.

I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. I have made this dish several times and each time has been an overwhelming success. You must strain the mixture, I use a china cap or chinois to get the right consistency. Also adjust the syrup to your taste, I didn't use all the mint required but just used to decorate. And last I added raspberries as a garnish which was wonderful for presentation as well as contrast. All in all a great, light dessert.

This recipe was good, just a little too sweet. The flan never did firm up enough too cut into slices, just mushy. Aside from that it tasted good and next time will make modifications.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for not straining the final mixture--I didn't want to lose any of the mango flavor and thickness--and the flan never thickened enough to be called flan. It was only as thick as pudding made from a mix, and certainly could not be unmolded like flan. Still, it had good flavor, and I would make it again, calling it mango puddings and topping each with a sprinkling of toasted coconut just before serving. I would not make the mango "salad" again nor the syrup--the syrup is sickeningly sweet, and way too vanilla-y and mint-y--it just overwhelms the mangoes.
