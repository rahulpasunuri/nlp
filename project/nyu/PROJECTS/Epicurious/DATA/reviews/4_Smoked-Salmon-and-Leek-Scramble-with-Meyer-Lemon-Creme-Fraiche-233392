I had higher hopes for this recipe. Cooking the eggs with the leeks seemed to keep my eggs from getting "fluffy" and they turned out "flat". Might try tweaking the preparation of the recipe if I make it again.

Made this for Mother's Day and it was legendary. Used Fage nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche, and had some leftover broiled King salmon that I fake-smoked by rendering two strips of bacon,cut into 1/4 inch pieces, then sauteeing the salmon in the fat along with the bacon. The bacon added yet another delightful note to the flavors. The lemon yogurt/sour cream is the linchpin of this recipe.

Delicious, and so quick and simple to make.

I really enjoyed this. It was easy and each part made for a better whole. The lemon in the sour cream mixture was a good foil for the richness of the eggs and the smokiness of the salmon. I will definitely make it again!

I made this for breakfast at a girl's weekend and got RAVE reviews. It was just wonderful - an excellent "special something" for that unique breakfast or brunch. Not difficult - especially if you make the fraiche ahead of time. Ingredients are fairly basic.

My husband made this for me for Mother's Day and, WOW, it is the best egg dish I think I've ever eaten!

My husband said, "this isn't good, it's delicious!" Used a dollop of sour cream with a squeeze of lemon juice on top of the salmon. Omitted the whipping cream. Loved the eggs with the sweetness of the leeks with the smokiness of the salmon. A definite keeper.

I think this would have been much tastier and healthier as a leek and salmon scramble. The Creme Fraiche was not particularly delicious, and if we're going to eat that much fat there better be a flavorful pay off! It drowned out the flavor of the leeks and the salmon. Heavy cream in the eggs is also somewhat unnecessary, whole milk could accomplish the same fluffy body in the eggs without risking a heart attack over breakfast.

I made this tonight for us. I used half the amount. We loved it! And even have left overs. Bob loved it the way it is. I would like it better with the creme fraiche recipe on the side. Great flavor!

This dish made a lovely, impressive and very quick Christmas brunch. Everyone raved. I used smoked trout instead of salmon (I like it better).
