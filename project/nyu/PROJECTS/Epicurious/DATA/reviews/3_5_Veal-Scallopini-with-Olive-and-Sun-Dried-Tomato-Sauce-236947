Great recipe. There was more 'stuff' then sauce but the flavor of the olive/tomatoes really penetrates the veal. Simple and quick.

followed recipe exactly. highly recommend using good cutlets of veal, only the bet quality - such as from Whole Foods. very easy and simple, yet makes a very good dish, works well as an entree within a multi course true italian meal

This is good and easy. But it would be better if I could get really good veal. Guess the restaurants get the good stuff, we have to settle for second best. But the flavor is lovely. My only change next time would be to reduce the amount of butter a bit.

Really liked this one ... sun dried tomatoes and olives were excellent with the veal ... we'll do this one again for sure!

My friend made this with Chicken instead of Veal and we used it to top angel hair pasta. Threw in a littl feta for good measure. YUM! I am getting the recipe right now so I can make it.

this was very good and quite simple to make. i cut recipe in half and it turned out fine. i used a bit more chicken broth and boiled sauce down a little longer to make it really tasty. the key is the brown bits so don't use a non-stick pan.

Add some crushed garlic to taste as well as some grated parmesean cheese.

This dish will be good only if you use the best veal you can find. It is an outstanding combination of flavors, easy to prepare, and is sure to please the most jaded palate.

Silly me. I am a batchelor and only cook for myself. I love the recipies but have to reduce them. Besides I find that by placing cooked food in the oven only dries it out.

This was really delicious! I will definitely make this again! A note to "brianrp from Australia"....the oven is pre-heated to 200F to keep the cutlets warm during the entire cooking process....the recipe indicates this part of the way through.......

I eat Scallopini at least once a week. I will keep this recipe but I am confused as to why set the oven on 200f. I cook all my scallopini stove top as you appear to have done

Followed the recipe with no changes and it turned out really good. I thought it was kind of strange that there wasn't any garlic in it, but it really didn't need it. Baked potatoes and asparagus as the sides.
