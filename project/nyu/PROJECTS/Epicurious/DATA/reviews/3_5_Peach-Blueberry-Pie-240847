After returning from NH with fresh picked peaches and blueberries, this was the perfect recipe to utilize all that fruit. The pie was beautiful and delicious!. I followed the recipe and took some hints from other reviewers. I did use 1Tbl. of cornstarch since I was out of tapioca and I used the lemon zest in with the fruit. I have an old commercial oven with fluctuating heat, so I cooked the pie at 375 for 30mins., then lowered the heat to 350 for an hour, then brought the heat back up again for the last 15 min.,having taken the foil off. Since I baked earlier in the day it had plenty of time to settle. Put it in a warm oven for a few mins. just before serving. Sliced perfectly. Crust was like shortbread, sweet and just slightly crumbly. I will definitely make this pie again next peach season. A winner!

Used my own pie crust recipe (20 T. of fat was overkill, in my opinion)but otherwise followed the recipe fairly closely. Used suggestion of others and added 1 T. cornstarch. This was a great combination of fruits and very tasty.

I made this pie with my own (actually, Julia Child's) pie pastry. It was high season for peaches and I used peaches from the local peach farm, with local blueberries. This may have been one of the best fillings we've ever had. Just the right amount of sweetness and tartness - of course, the perfect fruit didn't hurt.

Great piea combination that I had never tried. I, like some of the other reviewers, used a different crust recipe (see Lattice-Topped Strawberry Rhubarb Pie recipe on Epicurious). Thats a great crust! I used twice as many blueberries than what was called for since I didnt have enough peaches still very peachy. Of all who tried (including some very picky family members) no one thought the filling was too sweet but I didnt use super ripe peaches either. I added an extra 1/8 cup of flower to compensate for the extra juiciness others commented on and I spooned the filling out of the bowl with a slotted spoon into the pie plate. There was still at least a cup of juice left in the bowl. I also omitted the butter because the crust has plenty and I was a bit nervous about the pie being too runny. The filling baked up perfect but I did wait for the pie to cool completely (overnight) before slicing. I will make again!

Only 2 forks because I was looking for a peach pie and used this one for something different. Even though it is a very good pie it should not be listed under peach pie

I was skeptical about the other reviewers who said the crust wasn't quite right. Even after making it and before baking the pie, I tasted the crust and thought it would work well. If I was eating crust by itself, it wouldn't be anything special, but it seemed like it would be good with the fruit since it would allow the fruit to take center stage. After baking, though, I did think it came out pretty mediocre, except for the texture, which was exceptional (very flaky) and the appearance (the crust looked great; mouth-watering). Anyway, next time I will substitute another crust recipe. I'll either use another flaky dough recipe or I'll use a cookie crust recipe. The fruit filling was nice. I probably should have added the corn starch as mentioned by other reviewers. It was very liquid-y, however I refrigerated later and it turned out fine.

The filling was delicious and I will definitely make again. However, next time I'll definitely use a different crust recipe. This one was tricky to handle and didn't have quite the texture or taste as I would have liked.

Fantastic pie. Used the Tender Pie Crust instead (and frozen blueberries, partially defrosted). Completely delicious (though the frozen berries probably made the filling wetter -- had a bit of overflow liquid).

I followed the advice of some previous reviewers and cut the amount of sugar in half - 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. My family all agreed that it wasn't sweet enough so I will follow the amounts according to the recipe next time. Perhaps the sweetness depends on the peaches? I did add one tbsp of cornstarch to the peach mixture because I don't like a watery filling that often is found in homemade fruit pies. I do think the cornstarch thickened it up a bit. Finally, I probably would opt for another piecrust recipe. Admittingly, I usually use a store bought crust because I hate making pie crusts, but I felt adventerous this time. I found the crust a bit hard to work with (breaking apart when I tried to transfer it to the plate) and I did not think the it was the flakiest or most tasteful of crusts. Otherwise, I will try this recipe again because I think the filling had potential.

I was pressed for time so I used one store bought crust to place on top of the fruit and made this recipe into a cobbler. I did use local peaches and blueberries and added 1T of cornstarch as suggested by another reviewer. I also skipped the step of boiling the peaches. They were ripe enough and I just peeled them with a sharp knife and cut them into chunks before adding the lemon juice. I had some heavy cream left over so I whipped it up with confectioner's sugar and made homemade whipped cream to serve with the pie. It was fabulous and one of the best desserts I've made! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This a great recipe and so easy to make! It is heavy on the sugar, so next time I will cut back some to let the natural sweetness shine through. All in all, my family loved it and we will definitely make it again...and again!

My friend gave me a bunch of apricots from her tree so I used them instead of peaches and this pie is absolutely outrageous!!! It is so good! I also just covered the whole pie with a second crust, rather than taking the time to prepare the lattace. Yummy!

I made this pie last night (with a different crust - an all butter crust w/less sugar). I tasted the 'raw' filling before baking it and I thought it might be a little sweet, but after baking, cooling and tasting the pie I realized it wasn't a little sweet - it was a LOT sweet. The sugar mixture overwhelmed the fruit and created a syrupy flavor simliar to those cans of fruit filling. If I attempt this one again, I will halve the sugar mixture. As a side note, my boyfriend did like this pie - but what he really loved was the crust.

This is one of the best pies I have ever made! The balance of the ingredients is just right and the brown sugar and vanilla give the combination a wonderful flavor! I did not make the crust from scratch but used a refrigerated Pillsbury Pie Crust instead. It was still an excellent pie.

Very tasty pie that holds up very well. I would add more brown sugar and perhaps a little ginger next time. I'll make it again I'm sure!

This is a FANTASTIC pie. However, the crust is a bit greasy, so I might suggest a different recipe for the crust. I substituted raspberries for blueberries and it was AWESOME. I also used the 1T of corn starch suggested by another reviewer and the filling was a perfect consistency. Great recipe!

A great way to enjoy summer's bounty -- sweet, tart, delicious. I added 1T corn starch per a previous review, and was light on the sugar. Otherwise I made this per the recipe including the crust. It will become a rite of August!

I just pulled this pie from the oven. It looks beautiful but, while baking, the filling poured from the pie and, with it, took one quarter of a side of the pie crust. I have only had a chance to taste the drippings from the sheet the pie baked on. Although the flavor is good, I might cut back on a little of the sugar next time. I am sure the filling problem is my own fault -- I used the 3-1/2 lb measurement of peaches. Next time I will stick with 3#. I tried this recipe as a test thinking, if results were perfect, I would make it again for dinner guests next week. We'll taste it when it cools. I only gave it 3 forks because of my own problem with the filling/running problem. The peaches were large and very juicy - maybe that was part of the problem. The other two reviewers had no problems with their filling - so, obviously, I did something wrong.

I used my own crust recipe, but the filling recipe here is right on. I used fresh, peeled South Carolina peaches. I also added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the mix. The pie holds together very well and was not runny as I thought it might be. Delicious!

I've made this pie twice, with my own crust. The first time for a 4th of July dessert contest (it won), and second, for a backyard BBQ (to rave reviews). It's a perfect summer pie.
