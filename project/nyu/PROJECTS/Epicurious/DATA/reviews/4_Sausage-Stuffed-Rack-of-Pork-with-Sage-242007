Aur electric oven also burst open and flame shot out! I think the alcohol in the wine kind of exploded. Seems pretty dangerous... perhaps if you boil the wine first you might get rid of enough of the alcohol to avoid such excitement? Still, it was delicious. But cook with caution!

Try brining the roast (as per the herb-brined pork roast recipe also on this site). It yields something divine.

I love this recipe! I have made it several times, and it is always a hit with the family. I mix the scallions with the sausage until evenly distributed (I use either a pork salt & pepper sausage, or a pork garlic sausage, not Italian sausage). I then place the sage leaves on either side of the 'flap' and then fill the sage-lined flap with the sausage. I cook at the directed temperatures, but I do add the wine to the pan when I initially put the roast in the oven, using only about 3/4 of the bottle. I also omit the extra oil, as I do not see the need, and omit the olives, as not all in the family are olive lovers. I serve this dish with roasted potatoes, carrots, onion, and fennel. This recipe is a keeper!

I used a boneless pork roast but otherwise followed the directions. This was fantastic. Easy to prepare for guests.

My family loved this recipe. It was fairly easy to make as well. However, bone-in pork loin roast is pretty pricey. This will have to be for special occasions only! My husband said it was the best pork he had ever had!

I used a boneless pork loin and it worked very well. I used half of a 7.5# loin and used 5 sausages for the stuffing. I cut the roast down the middle, but did not cut to the ends, so it made more of a pouch for the sausage. The results were very good. I used kalamata olives and half the wine called for in the bottom of the pan. I also put the roast on a wire rack as there were no bones to hold it out of the juices. As advertised, it has a very rustic taste to it. We like it, and it is an attractive dish, but it did not rate 4 forks for us.

We put the roast in the oven and 10 minutes later our oven door popped open and a flame shot out. We have an electric oven, so I am wondering if this is just because of the huge amount of the large amount of wine in the recipe?

I don't understand how and where to cut to make the "flap" and letting the meat "return to the bone." Any help?

Sorry. Can't read.

I assume the first 20 minutes is at 4oo or 425 degrees? It doesn't say.

The last line of the recipe should read, "registers 155°F. About 1 1/2 to 2 hours more. Let stand 15 minutes. Serve with pan juices.

I haven't yet made this...the cup of olive oil seems excessive. Doesn't it make for very oily "pan juices"?

There is no need for special direction for sauce. Instead of olives you could use "pan juices." Instead of olives use carrots, celery, onions, garlic. Strain and serve.

To "A Cook," the recipe says pan juices. I'm wondering what the "1/2" (in the last line) means.

The last line of the recipe is "Serve with pan juices." So I am assuming you simply strain and serve. You could always finish into a gravy/sauce if you so desire, but don't forget to skim the oil and fat away first.

I am curious if you are to make a sauce after the roast is done. It does not explain this

To "A Cook": the wine is mentioned on the first line of the third paragraph.

The last line of the recipe is incomplete and the Orvieto sauce is not mentioned.
