I was expecting something more. A severe lack of flavours! I loved the idea of mini meatballs though.

We don't get that many cold & rainy days in Tucson and when we do, like today, this recipe hit the spot. It's comfort food with a touch of sweetness. Yum. It's a keeper.

~ Not to take anything from anyone, but I prefer to use chopped Celery AND Zucchini in the recipe , potato is always great, and I know , but I always bake the meatballs very well in the oven, then add them at the last few minutes.I did try ground Elk(baked for a few minutes with ground red chile flakes) And it was Awesome ! But ground round,and a spicy package of pork sausage made and baked before adding to the soup usually stands up very well too .

Great recipe for the kids, they ate it up. made a big pot and they all ate it two meals a day for three says. Adults found it homey but nothing exceptional.

I made several changes based on other reviews. I added 1 T. fresh thyme to the meatballs and used italian sausage instead of the ground pork. The meatballs turned out moist and delicious. The only thing I changed about the soup was the addition of 4 cloves of garlic and a bit of white onion. My father-in-law just finished his first round of chemotherapy, and I wanted to make him a soup that would not upset his stomach but at the same time have a nice, warming flavor. I think he will love this soup. I'm taking the soup there in just a few minutes, so I'll update my review after he's had some.

This was good, but not amazing. I too added an onion and a couple of parsnips to the vegetables. The broth had a rich, full flavor, but the meatballs needed something (maybe to be more like real meatballs, with egg and breadcrumbs?), and the rutabaga to meatball ratio was a little higher on the rutabaga side than I would have liked. If I made this again (but I don't think I will), I'd make real meatballs, doubling the amount of them, and put it only half the rutabaga (and of course keeping the changes of adding the onions and parsnips).

Soup was very good but needed a little something extra. We added onion and garlic to the stock base and added a 1/2 cup red wine & fresh thyme to the soup. We also added a little onion to the meatballs. This is an excellent recipe!!

I thought this was a pretty good soup, but tend to be sparing when it comes to rating 3-4 forks. I added barley and it seemed to be a nice compliment. Would make it again.

This recipe is a staple in my repetoir, warm and comforting, especially on a cold Pittsburgh winter day! I add other root vegetables such as turnips and parsnips, because I love them. I make a huge amount of this soup since it freezes very well, I like to know I have a batch in the freezer when the weather turns!

Great dish. Subsituted italian sausage for the pork, and added 1/2 cup of fresh cilantro to meatballs, along with some spiced breadcrumbs. It's a must to defat the soup. I love this recipe though!
