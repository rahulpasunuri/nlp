I did not follow the exact recipe, but it turned out WONDERFUL! Used half vanilla yogurt, and half plain. I used a little bit more lime zest than it said, but I just love the flavor and color. Furthermore, I didn't have 12 hours to drain the yogurt, only let it sit for 6, still had a good texture. I served it with fresh fruits (pineapple, raspberry...). My family loved it.

Heavenly! Am very fussy about homemade ice cream. This is a keeper. Had to use 1 carton of plain, 1 carton vanilla yogurt and flavor was just fine. Agree vanilla bean is important. Skipped the blender step to save on clean-up, but did stir all ingredients into half the yogurt to start -- just let it set about 5 min to dissolve sugar after whisking. That left the lime zest large enough to catch on the ice cream maker paddle. It was easy to re-distribute and added to the handmade authenticity. Served with a little chopped dark chocolate sprinkled over the top. Divine!

Very good. Made half a batch, and the yogurt drained longer than 12 hours, but otherwise followed the recipe. Yummy flavor, good texture.

I was excited to try this frozen yogurt as I love yogurt and I love lime, but mine did not turn out as expected. I used whole milk organic yogurt and fresh limes. The texture was amazing and looked so yummy, but it only tasted like plain yogurt. I wonder if I might not like it better with vanilla yogurt. My one problem was that I had one vanilla bean and I think that it was a little past it's prime and would not cut in half w/out breaking up, so I did not get many seeds out of it. I added vanilla extract though, but it was just not the same. I may try again w/ vanilla yogurt and or freah vanilla bean, beacause I loved the texture and ease of making it.

This frozen yogurt is delicious. I substituted simple syrup for the corn syrup and it worked very well. Can't wait to experiment with different flavor combinations.

Be still my heart....the texture of this yogurt is out of this world....so smooth, epecially if eaten when first made. I did leave out the corn syrup. It's easy to check before you add the corn syrup and see if it's sweet enough for you. Loved the flavor, loved the texture. Loved it!

Easy to make, delicious to eat. I used non-fat yogurt, and only had 1 lime, so 1/2 the lime juice was out of one of those little plastic limes. Even so, it was fabulous! So pretty with the black flecks from the vanilla bean. It's very intense in flavor, so a little goes a long way. I wouldn't use it in a popsicle mold, for example. It's sweet enough to find favor with people who like lemons but not limes. The vanilla makes it taste somewhere in between the two, for me. I'll be making this a lot, and will try my hand at a lot more frozen yogurts. A great do-ahead no-fat dessert!

A very yogurty frozen yogurt. Fresh and flavorful, with a nice texture. I served it with a strawberry-rhubarb pie and it was perhaps a little too tart for that, although my guests loved it.

Fabulous! Tried with no fat yogurt and a little more lime zest and it was still a big hit.

My mother in law even approved of how tasty this dish was when I served it. That has to say something since she doesn't like things that are too high in fat. It really hits the spot.
