If you like dense, moist, not too sweet cakes, this is perfect. I didn't try the the compote because I am takings cake decorating class and used a rich buttercream frosting. The combination of the tartness of the cranberry cake and sweet frosting was perfect.

This was the perfect offering, in addition to pumpkin pie, at Thanksgiving. I made it exactly as written, except I ran out of sour cream, so used half sour cream and half lemon Greek yogurt. Everyone loved it. It was not too tangy or tart and very moist. Also made the compote which was very good and looked lovely on the plate with the cake. This is a keeper!

This is very easy and incredibly delicious. I kept a few cranberries back to decorate the batter before I placed it in the oven. Lovely and moist, a friend kept raving about it. I made one for my son to take back to NY after Christmas.

I made this recipe twice, I'm not sure what I did wrong but both times the cake did not come out moist. The flavor was good though, very tart and tangy. A nice contrast to most holiday goodies that have been going around the office.

This cake is so good. Not your typical spice cake at all. Very zesty and fruity and so easy to make. I did not make the fruit compote as I did not have enough maple syrup but cake was really good without. Can't wait to have another piece for breakfast!

Got tons of compliments on this at work. Super moist, which helps set off the tartness from the lemon and the cranberry.

Had to omit cardamon but everyone loved the cake. Suggest making ahead to let the flavors meld.

Made this for Thanksgiving table. Lovely and welcomed contrast to the heavy meal. I lowered the sugars to 1/2 cup for each and it was sweet plenty especially if you serve the compote alongside.

My sister made this and brought it over tonight for breakfast tomorrow morning (Thanksgiving day). It may not last til morning, so good!! The cranberry is nicely tart without being sour, and the lemon glaze really sets it off. Excellent in all ways!!

I served this for a ladies' luncheon and it was the hit! Leftovers still moist a week later.

Extremely moist and delicious. The spice is actually quite restrained (just cinnamon and cardamon), so this has a different, much more citrusy flavor than a basic spice cake. The compote is a nice touch.

I just made this tonight! I have celiac disease, but I made it using Thomas Keller's gluten free all-purpose flower blend and the cake came out excellent! I think next time though I'll just make a sweet glaze and back off some of the citrus, because its kind of strong, but the cake itself was airy, moist, and delicious!
