I have made these cookies for the holidays since 1996. Everyone loves them. Use Silpat sheet on pan. Do NOT overbake. Be sure to toast coconut. They are not "same old" Christmas cookie.

Excellent cookies - the children love them. I guess green cherries cut up would make them look Christmassy, but they disappeared quickly just as they were.

These are wonderful cookies that everyone loves. They are very tender and best served fresh. Buttering the cookie sheet before baking is a must! And use real sour cream for maximum flavor. Great alternative to chocolate. I give these as gifts every year and everyone raves it's one of the best cookies they've ever had.

i like these cookies a lot, as do most people i have served them to. i usually make a few minor changes: i cut the apricots smaller than suggested so that the dough can hold together smaller cookies, and i also sometimes leave the coconut out of the dough and just put it on the top before putting them in the oven (the coconut toasts as the cookies bake). i love all the ingredients, but it seems a lot of people object to the coconut, and this way they can just shake off most of it. it's also very nice to be able to just freeze portions of the dough and bake another batch a few weeks later for a different occasion. i think i usually divide the dough into smaller logs than recommended, too.

Didn't have much flavor

I found the cookies to be quite tasty. The toasted coconut gave body and a slightly sweet flavor to the cookies. I modified the recipe by replacing the dried apricots with green maraschino cherries. The red craisins and green cherries made them festive and Christmas-y.

These cookies looked very nice, but they were awful. No flavor, used brand name dried fruits, Sunsweet and Ocean Spray. Perhaps some flavoring in the dough would help.
