Very tasty - even my husband approved! Easy and fast to make!

One minor change: mix in breadcrumbs at the end in the skillet. I used Panko crumbs which are nice and crunchy.

I thought this dish was lacking. The maple syrup and lemon combination was odd and I didn't like the texture of the breadcrumbs with the wilted frisee. Although this is creative, it is not worth the effort.

This is easy and totally delicious. If you didn't know the ingredients, you would be wondering, "what is in this that makes it so delicious and complex?" So I will definitely be serving it to company at some point.
