I love these and they are always a hit when I serve them. I also grate the zucchini and add more garlic. I serve them with a lemon, garlic aioli and that finishes them off beautifully.

This was great! I diced the zucchini finely and had to add oil to the pan each time I fried. They came out perfect!!! Next time I will add more garlic. Squeeze generously with lemon juice. Yum!!!!!!

I loved this. I grated the zucchini in the food processor and alsu used yellow summer squash. I thought they were a nice alternative to a potato dish and made a nice side dish.

Only OK - after reading other review I grated the zucchini, which added a lot of liquid that steamed off but did not brown. It was bland rubbery and oily. Needs a lemon vinaigrette.

I grated the zucchini, used a bit more garlic (and forgot I didn't have baking powder) and these fritters came out great. Definitely use the lemon juice. The combination of the spice from the red peppers, garlic and lemon really did the trick.

Finally a way to get my husband to eat zucchini! This was very good but I'll cut the zucchini up even smaller next time (grated perhaps?) and watch out for how the fritters soak up the oil - I had to add more to prevent burning.

Really enjoy the flavor of the zucchini. This is great appetizer for a crowd.

We were loving this dish til after about the first two...they were a little too rich! So next time I think we will tone down the batter--less overall--and also use less milk and maybe put in a little beer (which always makes batter better!). Otherwise it was pretty decent.

We were looking for vegetarian dishes for a Christmas buffet as some of our kids are vegetarians. This was liked by all!

I loved this recipe! Great with sour cream. Used the batter for japanese eggplant from my garden, too. I didn't cook the eggplant first. I just sliced it, dipped in batter and fried in olive oil. Easy and tasty.

Nice side dish for pasta with red sauce instead of the usual salad...I added thyme (because I add thyme to almost every veggie) and some sliced fresh mushrooms to the saute and next time I would add more pepper...also I will probably make the batter a little thinner so the fritters are thinner and crisper.
