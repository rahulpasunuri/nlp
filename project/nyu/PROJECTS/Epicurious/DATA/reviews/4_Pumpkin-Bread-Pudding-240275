A wonderful and nutritious bread pudding. I make this with any left over bread. For a nutritious breakfast, I cut way down on the sugar, usually adding 2 T of brown sugar and add raisins to give it more sweetness. Sometimes you'll need a bit more butter depending on the amount of bread. I will substitute half+half for the heavy cream depending on what's in the fridge. Excellent.

Wonderful! Absolutely Wonderful. I made the caramel sauce from this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Pumpkin-Bread-Pudding-with-Caramel-Sauce-104182 and topped it with ice cream. The fat and calorie content of this stuff is astonishing; however, it is second to NONE and worth the occasional splurge.

OMG!!! My husband, who is a diehard pumpkin pie lover says that he thinks he likes this pudding BETTER than pumpkin pie. I made a double recipe in a 15x10 pan, keeping in mind that other reviewers said it needed more custard. I used an entire large (29oz) can of pumpkin and mixed it, about one cup (total) more of milk & cream and the spices (adding nutmeg) to taste test my spices before adding the eggs. I used more than the suggested quantities (doubled) of spice based on this method. I also let the bread soak in the egg/milk/spice mixture in the fridge overnight and baked it the next day. I served it with a Rum Sauce recipe found on Epicurious and it was a HUGE Thanksgiving hit.

Modified it a bit - used soy cream and almond milk and I substituted brown sugar instead of regular. Also, I used challah bread. Agree that it needs more liquid, so I increased the cream and milk by 50% and added a few capfuls of rum. After baking for 25 min I brushed a butter/brown sugar blend on top and sprinkled some extra brown sugar on it then broiled it for a minute. It was delicious, wish we had vanilla ice cream to top it with!

Agree it needs more custard. I increased the custard by 1/2 & it was a little dry on the top. I will try using a different bread next time, maybe challah. I used a crusty levain & found that bread to be a little too "sturdy" for a pudding. I also just used pumpkin pie spice instead of this blend, because I had some home-made that was leftover from something I made last week.

This is probably the best bread pudding I have eaten. I used the new Pumpkin Spice Milk from Aldi instead of the milk for a more intense pumpkin flavor. I also doubled the recipe and it was all gone in 2 hours after baking, warm from the oven. Have already made it a second time.

This was like comfort food meets heaven. I made it exactly as specified and let's just say there were no leftovers. The only thing I would do differently would be to double the spices and perhaps add a generous pinch of good quality nutmeg. I did make a bourbon caramel sauce which I offered on the side for guests who wanted to ladle a little over their bread pudding and they all loved that as well. I am really looking forward to making this again - YUM.

Exceptional dessert! Easy and super yummy.

My family's new favorite bread pudding; much better dimension of flavors and able to decrease the sugar because of the pumpkin. I agree that increasing the quantity of the liquid/custard recipe by about 1/4-1/3 makes a better creaminess. Adding rum sauce made it perfect.

I was looking for a quick and easy dessert to serve at a small weeknight birthday gathering in the fall, and landed on this--what a fun surprise! Served with a bit of hot caramel on top, and everyone raved. Someone said if french toast and pumpkin pie made a baby, this is what it would be. I'd have to agree.

I guess I will be the odd man out on this recipe. I thought it was good but not memorable. Very quick and easy though...I think it would be a better dessert with a sauce...maple, caramel, rum, etc.

WOW. Couldn't find pumpkin in the store this time of year so made this with sweet potatoes instead and it was wonderful. Also don't care for raisins so used a baguette and trimmed the crust. Had to soak bread a bit longer as a result but that worked with my schedule better anyway. Didn't do topping but made a rum sauce from another recipe and it was fantastic.

Rating: 3
I would increase the sugar, or use a drizzle of maple sugar on top. It wasn't very sweet. I found soft Italian bread loaf was soft enough to work well, I just ripped it up so it looked rustic. I'd increase pumpkin next time to. I double the recipe and served as a winter dessert for a dinner party and it was a tad dry...perhaps a bit more milk.

This is a delicious and really easy recipe. I made 1" cubes of bread the first time around, but the second time I made it with fresh sliced white bread and it was even better. Also, cook it longer than 35 minutes, maybe 40-45 minutes.

Num num num. I've only made it once and had to make plenty of substitutions based on what I had in my fridge and pantry: used 3/4 c 1% milk with 1/4 c half-half in place of the heavy cream and whole milk, 3/4 cup pumpkin pie mix (picked up by accident in store) in place of the solid pack pumpkin and all spices, old sourdough bagette in place of crusty bread. Remarkably, it still came out edible--actually pretty darn good! Quite a testament to the foolproofness of this recipe! Can't wait until I have actual ingredients on hand to give it another go! =oD

This is a 1 star recipe unless the spices are doubled! in addition I think it needs 1/3+ cup of raisins. I soaked them in rum (then placed in the 350 oven for 10 minutes, drained the rum and added to the pudding/bread mix.) I wish I liked this better, loved the idea.

Rating: 4
As others have mentioned, I doubled the spices and did not use whole milk. I didn't bathe the bread cubes in butter, and the pudding was still flavorful and rich.

This was super easy and delicious. I roasted a pie pumpkin and pureed it, which I like better than canned pumpkin. And a tiny pinch of nutmeg too. Since my baguettes were pretty stale, I let them soak in the custard for an hour before I cooked it, and also added a 1/2 cup of Zante currants for texture. Great with ice cream!

I doubled the spices and the pumpkin custard was delicious! The only problem was that I went with a rustic whole wheat bread and larger cube then suggested by the recipe. Definitly will make again with a rich egg bread and a much smaller cube and I know it will be incredible.

I've made this several times and it is always a big hit. Followed other reiews that doubled the spices and did not use the butter. The last time I made it, I used Thomas' cinnamon raisin breakfast bread and it was a really big favorite. Another nice thing about this recipe...it's easy!!!

I"ve made this several times now--what an easy, tasty recipe. The spices do need to be doubled---triple the cinnamon. I also add a dash of pumpkin pie spice and some orange zest, which really wakes up the flavors. Serve with real whipped cream flavored with Grand Marnier. Yum!!!

Great result and so easy! Doubled the recipe, cut the cream in half, used five eggs instead of four plus the two yolks, tripled the spices and used just a half-cup of melted butter that I added to the mixture rather than mixing it with the bread. A keeper.

super easy to make and totally adaptable. i used brioche buns and had to add an extra 2 cups of bread bc i used the whole can of pumpkin instead of 3/4. i also doubled the spices, used 1/2c heavy cream and 1c of 2% milk, cut down on the butter, and it was still plenty rich. my one indulgence: added semi-sweet chocolate chips... ate 1/4 of the pan in one sitting!

I make a similar pumpkin bread pudding with homemade caramel sauce - delicious! The key is using challah bread - gives it just the right flavor and texture.

I screwed this up a little because of the way I printed it out. Forgot the spices so I sprinkled them on top half-way through the baking. Didn't have a baguette so I dried out my own homemade bread in the oven. It was still grrrreat. Even I couldn't spoil this one.

This was very easy to make and an absolute hit at a family gathering. I did not use ginger but rather freshly ground nutmeg. I also went ahead and used the whole can of pumpkin (what are you going to do with the left-overs?). It was really good and I can't wait to try it with a gathering of friends.

Rating: 4
I was sure to double all the spices as the other reviewers suggested and baked the bread cubes to help dry them a bit more (as I enjoy bread pudding more when the bread soaks up the majority of the custard) and it was divine! We made a vanilla spiced rum glaze to serve with it, as well. Other than doubling the spices, I followed the recipe and thought the richness was perfect for a fall evening.

I will be making this again today. So delish! The last time I made this I served it with maple walnut ice cream. I am not sure I would have rated this recipe as highly without the ice cream - the combination of the tastes, temperature and texture made the dessert.

I made this, following the suggestions of other reviewers, using half and half instead of the milk and cream combo. Also doubled the spices and used Hawaiian sweet bread. After baking, I sprinkled the top with some sugar/cinnamon and then served with the low-fat vanilla custard sauce (on this website) drizzled over each serving -- fantastic!! This is a keeper.

Very good! It was definitely better served warm. I needed to increase the cooking time to about 35 minutes to get the custard to set, but the toasty bread and pumpkin and spices were a great combination. It reminded me of French toast mixed with pumpkin pie. Very rich; I drank a lot of milk with it.

I've made this twice so far, and I'm sure it won't stop there. This recipe is simple and very easy to follow. I substituted the allspice for cardamom and it was very good! I love pumpkin and I absoloutely love bread pudding. This is just delicious! (with some english style custard..mmm)

This is really easy and really delicious. It's not very sweet, which is nice, but I added dried cherries which sweetened it up a little and it was really good. I also did about half brown/half white sugar. Having just watched a cooking show where they made panettone bread pudding, I'd now like to make it with panettone.

Made this with the leftover pumpkin from Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews. The kids gobbled it up and hardly left any for the adults! I baked it in a 9x13 pan, which I wouldn't do again - I'd use the 8X8 in the recipe so that the tops pieces of bread get as much of the sauce as the lower pieces. The top got a little crusty in the larger pan, but it still tasted good.

Rating: 2
This was just okay... I'm not sure why the rating's so high. I should have read the reviews before making. I agree the spices should be doubled, and the recipe as written makes too much custard. I used it all, but baked it twice as long to set. It would be nice served warm with vanilla bean or cinnamon ice cream. As is, it's a little bland. I'll make it again--but with a lot of tweaking.

I've made this recipe twice (first as a test run and second on Thanksgiving), and the most recent time far exceeded the results I had the first time around. For the test run, I subbed whole milk for the heavy cream and used all of the custard... the result was a very mushy (almost muddy) bottom in the pan. The second time on Thanksgiving, I used the heavy cream, some brown sugar instead of fully white sugar, and only 3/4 of the custard. The results were incredible! It was a firmer bread pudding - the inside of each bread cube was soft and pumpkiny, and the outside of each cube was golden brown and firm. Everyone ranted and raved about how fabulous it was (even the much more expensive Balthazar catered pies went uneaten!). Will definitely make again and again... for dessert or as an indulgent brunch dish :-)

I made this for brunch on Thanksgiving, and it was nothing to get excited about. I followed the recipe to the letter, but the pumpkin sank to the bottom of the pudding, where it was kind of gloppy and not particularly attractive. It tasted okay, but nobody wanted seconds, and my reputation as a holiday brunch maestro suffered a bit of a setback.

Rating: 4
I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner and thought it was very good. I forgot to read the reviews before making it, but agree it would be wise to double the spices as it is good on its own but could be even more flavorful with more spice. I accidentally only used 1/2 cup butter and forgot the other egg yolk (so I only used 2 whole eggs), and intentionally used reduced fat milk, but thought this consistency was still perfect. I also added rum-soaked raisins to the top before baking, but it would be good inside as well.

This dessert was fabulous! I served it for dessert at Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the recommendation to double the spices ( I used pumpkin pie spice and allspice) and used brown sugar. I also made it a nondairy dessert by substituting the cream with part soysilk creamer and part hemp milk. I used a baguette that I had purchased on Monday for the purpose of making this recipe and I baked the pudding on Thursday. I plated the pudding on a pool of warm pumpkin butter and topped it with bourbon caramel sauce ( store bought no dairy sauce with bourbon added to taste) and toasted pecans.It was a huge sucess. A dollop of whipped cream would be heavenly for those who can have dairy. The reults were soft,creamy and delicious. Even though I added extras in the plating the pudding could stand on it's own. I will make this dessert again because my friends and family will insist. Very easy to do - the results belie the simplicity and ease of the recipe!

Rating: 2
Far less impressive than I expected, but a good dessert (thanks mainly to the ice cream). Mine came out too dense--less bread and more custard would have been better. But I liked it well enough to try it again. The advice to use brown sugar and double the spices, however, was excellent!

This is a simple, rustic, bread pudding, and has all the flavors one craves in a fall dessert. I made the recipe exactly as described, except I baked it an additional 5 minutes, and didn't have 'day old' bread. I used a rustic Francese bread, cubed it, and baked the cubes in a 300F oven for 5 mins, stirred them around, and then baked 5 minutes more. Just enough to dry the bread out, not toast it. Sogginess was not a problem, but the type of bread you use, and it's moisture content could affect the texture considerably. Not a very elegant dish, but great comfort food, very fast to prepare, and lovely served warm with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I made this as one of two deserts for an Autumnal dinner party for 10 people (the other desert was Carrot Cake with Maple cream cheese frosting found on Epicurious). I made the bread pudding as directed and found it somewhat boring. I served it warm with homemade caramel and vanilla ice cream. I could have saved myself time and trouble and just offered a choice between the carrot cake and ice cream with caramel sauce.

Mine was good, however did not come out as firm as the picture looks. It was a little too mushy. I did not use cloves at all, I used skim milk instead of whole, and 2 eggs and 2 yolks instead of 2 eggs and 1 yolk. Everything else I followed to a tee, cooked at 350 degrees for 30 mins. Any suggestions? Also I think im going to double up on the spices next go round.

This was my first shot at bread pudding and unfortunately it didn't go that well. How "set" is the custard supposed to be? After 40 mins in the oven it was still sort of soupy. Should I have whisked the custard more before adding to the bread cubes? Also, do you think mashed bananas would be a good substitute for the pumpkin as an alternative dish? Thanks in advance for your help!

I made this recipe for the dessert for my parent's 30th anniversary dinner. Before I even put it in the oven, my mum tried to run off with the bowl. This is a fantastic recipe, though it should probably be served with a Lipitor... I followed the recipe more or less, but I made 1 1/2 times the amount. I also added vanilla extract and fresh ground nutmeg as well as a little more pumpkin than was called for. When I serve it again, I may add a whiskey caramel sauce or maybe some spiced whip cream. If you are trying to decide whether or not to make this recipe, DO IT! It's great and SOOO easy!

Until this recipe, I had always hated bread pudding. I cannot quantify how wonderful this recipe is: it's easy, it's fast, it's delicious, it's rich enough to feed a group without leaving anyone feeling wanting and it even reheats well when you're not feeding a group! The first time we made this, the bread sat out for a couple of hours during dinner and it worked perfectly. The second time we didn't think of it until after dinner. We bought the stiffest loaf at the store, but there seemed to be way too much custard and it took 10+ extra minutes of cooking time. Was it necessarily the staleness of the bread? I don't know, but I thought I would mention it. Also, we used Libby's pumpkin the first couple times, and organic most recently (we love this recipe!), and I hate to say it because I'm all for supporting organics, but the Libby's tastes best. The organic was too squashy for this kind of desert item.
