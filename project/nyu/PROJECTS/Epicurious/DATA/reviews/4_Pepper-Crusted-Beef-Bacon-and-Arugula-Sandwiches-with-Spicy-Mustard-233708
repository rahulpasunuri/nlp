Very nice recipe to serve for a crowd. Couldn't find baby arugula, just used butter lettuce. Also, the mushrooms weren't really necessary. The dijon mustard sauce is really what makes it, and of course the bacon.

Great sandwich. The mustard sauce woulde be great on burgers and steak in general. I substituted a thick sirloin due to the expense of tenderloin.

This was really, really good! Could not for the life of me find fresh baby arugula, so used watercress instead. I also sauteed the mushrooms, then squeezed the lemon juice onto them at the end. Served with steamed green beans. Hubby and I both gobbled it up. We'll definitely make this again, especially in the summer on the BBQ.

This sandwich is absolutely delicious and very easy to prepare. The steak and arugula make a great flavor combination and the dijon-horseradish sauce ties it all together perfectly. I also toast the kaiser rolls with a slice of provolone. I would recommend this to anyone.

Yum! My husband made this for us and we gobbled it up. I especially liked the mushrooms. They had a great flavor and texture from resting in the lemon juice. We will make this again for sure.

My significant other is a meat-lover, so this dish was right up his alley!! It's a rather messy sandwich, though. I think next time I'll skip the bread and prepare this as a salad.

As is, this recipe is fantastic, but if you don't want to waste perfectly good tenderloin on worthless roommates, top sirloin is a great substitute. Slicing thinly is the key with this cut of meat, however.

Excellent! I've made so many recipes from this and other sites, and this is the first one that I loved exactly as is. I didn't--and wouldn't-- change a thing.
