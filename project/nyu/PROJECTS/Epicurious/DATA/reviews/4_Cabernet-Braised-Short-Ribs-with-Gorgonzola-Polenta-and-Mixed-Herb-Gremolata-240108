I made this dish quite some time ago as a less experienced and equipped cook. It was amazingly delicious, but I think next time I'll leave it overnight so it's easier to separate the fat from the sauce. The polenta and gremolata are perfect accompaniments.

A bit of a fuss, but worth every second in prep time. I used grits instead of polenta. My guests wanted the delicious 'polenta' recipe. My California friends couldn't believe they had actually eaten grits! But, just follow the recipe, and rake in the complements.

I've made this dish twice now. The first time I lost a lot of the liquid. So the 2nd time I first covered my dutch oven with foil (folding it down around the sides of the pot) and then put the lid on. Retained a lot more the wine. Love this dish!

Really great - I added some homemade veal stock to the wine for the braise and a little more depth, and strained it for the sauce. No need to add a roux. Don't skip the gremolata - it really brightened up this rather rich dish.

Wasn't a fan of polenta until I made this recipe. Loved everything! Going to make for a dinner party this weekend exactly as written (well, except I go a little lighter on the gorgonzola).

THE BEST short ribs EVER... sometimes I make these with 1 bottle of wine and use chicken stock in place of the 2nd bottle. It's fantastic both ways. AND SO EASY! Great to make ahead of time and re-heat for parties!

One of our all time favourite winter recipes. It's absolutely wonderful.

Oh YUM! made this for a Valentine's dinner for my fiance. I didn't read the recipe ahead of time, so I did not have the time to let the meat sit overnight, so I seasoned and let sit for about an hour or two. I just used rosemary as the grocery store was out of thyme. The polenta was fantastic - After cooked, I poured into a round pie plate, let cool, cut into wedges, brushed with olive oil and broiled for crisp texture on the outside. Everything was just as good, if not better left over the next day!

Great dish with rich flavors and textures. The polenta is a perfectly paired with the short ribs and cabernet reduction. Nice texture combination too and the gorgonzola pairs nicely with the wine braised beef. I had to cook the ribs 30 minutes longer, and required a 3rd bottle of wine after removing the fat from the braising liquid as it was mostly gone. I reduced the new mixture for an additional 20 minutes. Otherwise, the recipe is spot on. The gremolata is an essential element lending a fresh and aromatic finish. Ideal winter fare and perfect for a comfortable family dinner or elegant dinner party.

Flawless. Love this recipe. Best short ribs ever AND simple ingredients. My husband loves these so much, we have an agreement that we are not allowed to order them at restaurants because ours are better. I prefer my Polenta with less cheese flavor, which is odd, since I LOVE cheese. But Gorgonzola is a bit strong for me.

Absolutely to die for, 5 star restaurant quality. I'm soooo happy I have leftovers. I made with Caramelized Onion & Gorgonzola Mashed Potatoes. http://www.food.com/recipe/caramelized-onion-gorgonzola-mashed-potatoes-113528 Delish! p.s. this short rib recipe is alot easier than it looks. Try it!

I made this a couple of months back, and used a chuck roast instead of short ribs but followed the recipe faithfully other than that. Amazing flavor, wonderfully tender and a truly gorgeous plate! I'm planning to make this again next weekend. I always use stone-ground yellow corn grits... let's face it, "polenta" sounds fancier but ground corn is ground corn is ground corn.

This dish is absolutely fabulous, I've made it several times for my husband and I and also for our fellow foodies. Once I went to our local market and the butcher recommended using beef shank. I wasn't so sure but I took his advice. It was even better using the beef shank and I now only prepare it using the shank. By using the beef shank, you have to deal with much less fat and the dish yields much more meat. A benefit my husband and I found appealing. Enjoy! It's a wonderful dish and you won't be disappointed!

I used the adaptation at Well-Fed http://wellfed.typepad.com/well_fed/2007/12/cabernet-braise.html which seems to be this recipe with the celery-onion-carrot triumverate added. It was tasty but not quite amazing for me. Also I followed the advice of Lake Tahoe and used grits. Since we're in Alabama there was no mystery there, but I liked the putting the heartiness of the grain in the mix.

This is a family favorite. Costco carries boneless shortribs by us and there is less waste. Gremolate is the key! It tastes better made a day or two ahead and just reheated.

My review is more of a caution than on taste; the ribs taste wonderful. Please be cautious when cooking the ribs in the oven. I used a 6 3/4 le creuset dutch oven and followed the recipe step by step. I checked on the ribs after 25 minutes of cooking. When I opened my oven door (whirlpool electric oven-2 yrs old) a flame shot out and singed my hair and took a layer of skin off of my face. Use extreme caution when cooking. I assume that the fumes from the wine had escaped the lid and come into contact with the heating unit; once I open the door and introduced oxygen a back draft occurred and produced the flame. I am a cautious cook and have never had anything like this happen. After I calmed myself down, I lowered the temp to 225 and cooked for an extra hour. I also carefully open the oven door from that point on. I considered myself lucky...hair will grow back and hopefully my skin will recover; I just don't anyone else to experience the same thing I did!

17 year old son said "Oh my god, this is good!" and then thanked me for making it after dinner. I'll definitely be making it again. I made one substitution. I couldn't bring myself to pour in 2 bottles of wine so I used one bottle and 2 cups of chicken broth. Also served with roasted fingerling potatoes instead of polenta.

What a great do-ahead recipe! Delicious. I used grits instead of polenta...my guests raved about the grits thinking they were polenta. When they left demanding the recipe, I told them they were eating grits. Surprise.

This is amazing. I have made it several times now, just the way it was written. I do get the shortribs from a butcher.. he knows what I want. Don't skip the gremolata. It adds that depth of flavor that you are looking for. My husband begs for this dish. Am making it again this week for a dinner party. Love it.

Made this last night for the first time. I started 2 days ago with rubbing the herbs onto the ribs and letting them sit for 24 hours in a zip lock bag (also added garlic cloves). I cooked them 2 nights ago, and let them sit in the sauce in the fridge overnight. I added shallots, bay leaves and beef broth to the sauce while cooking. Was able to pick the fat right off the top after it hardened in the fridge, and heated them up last night for a wonderful fall dinner with friends. I did not have to reduce the liquid too much for the sauce, as it thickened right up with the roux. Served with the gremolata and gorgonzola polenta and apple caramel tarts for dessert. It was WONDERFUL, fall-off-the-bone meat. I cannot understand the reviews saying it was somewhat flavorless, as it found it to have a wonderful deep rich flavor. Will definitely add it to my regular recipes!

Rating: 2
While the Cab is fine for the sauce, Pinot Noir might be a better wine to serve with the dish. The more subtle nuances of flavor better bridge the savoriness of the meat and the creaminess of the polenta than the ofttimes linearity of Cabernet. The gremolata is superb. I turn to it often to marry with other dishes.

Rating: 2
I first made this meal exactly as written. It tasted very good served with the polenta and gremolata, but the short ribs on their own lacked a depth of flavor. I made the recipe again,adding carrots, onion, celery and diced tomatoes to the braising liquid, and it was 100% better. The wine alone just didn't make a great sauce.

Rating: 4
Great recipe have made it several times, but made some changes. Season meat as suggested, but browned the meat on charcoal grill and added hickory chips for additional smoke flavor. Placed in crock-pot with wine and bay leaf and let it cook 6-8 hr on low and completed grave as directed. I cant say how easy and good the recipe is.

Rating: 4
fantastic! i made this recipe last fall, exactly as written, and it quickly became one of my signature dishes. the gremolata really does add something special, and the polenta is a keeper - even for people who thought they didn't like polenta. fall is in the air and i just received a call from a friend telling me that it meant it's almost short-rib season!

Rating: 4
A+++ Love this recipe! The last time I actually used the 2nd bottle of Cab at the table! One bottle yielded plenty of sauce. I even found the short ribs at the store to be fatty and expensive that day...so substituted Chuck Roast. Fantastic and more economical...still that wonderful texture. Will likely make this a permanent change to this recipe.

My bf and I made the whole thing, polenta and gremolata included, and WOW is it worth it. Though a bit time consuming, it's a really easy recipe and so rewarding. The first time we made it we had some friends over and it blew them away as well. The ribs were so flavorful and tender, and definitely do not forget the gremolata.. this adds a beautiful brightness to the richness of the cabernet. And of course, polenta + gorgonzola = divine. Nothing bad to say about this recipe.. I'd give it five forks if I could!

I made this for a dinner party with gorgonzola mashed potatoes instead of polenta. Everyone loved it! Be sure to use meaty English style short ribs. I actually had the meat dept repackage several packs for me to make sure I didn't get any skinny ribs. Also, I tried a practice run with flanken cut ribs and didn't get great results. That may have been because I purchased them from Sam's though. I browned my ribs in one batch in the oven. Place the ribs in a roasting pan before sprinkling with the herb marinade. The next day, just pop the pan in a hot oven (450-degrees) and bake for about 45 minutes. Drain off fat and continue to cook another 15 minutes or so until ribs are good and brown. Transfer ribs to dutch oven before proceeding. I used 2 bottles of Charles Shaw Cab Sauv (two buck chuck) and 1 qt of low sodium chicken broth to make sure my ribs were submerged while cooking. Ribs were done in about 1.45 hours since I had a long bake time on them to brown. I left them in their liquid overnight, removed fat the next day. Reheated right before serving, then reduced sauce. If your sauce tasted bland, look to your browning technique. The ribs need to be very brown to add the necessary flavor to this recipe.

This is the best meal I've made in a long time. I've been in a slump for months, not being impressed with any new recipe I try. This one broke the streak! I cut the recipe in half. I think next time I will try the suggestion of using part stock for the braising liquid, and will try to start cooking ahead of time so I can chill it to pull the fat off. Don't skip the gremolata even if you're tempted-it really takes the dish to the next level. The lemon and garlic really finish it. I didn't have fresh thyme so I used just a bit of dried, and added a squirt of lemon juice to add moisture when I was grating zest. Really I can't praise this meal enough. My husband and I enjoyed every bite, and my 10 month old ate like it was going out of style. I was so sad when it was over. Thank you, Bon Appetit! A year's subscription was worth this meal tonight!

I have never written a review here, but I have to say, this recipe is terrific. Per some of the other reviewers, I used a combination of wine and beef stock for the braising liquid. Delish! And, as for the gremolata, it was nice but certainly not necessary. Perfect dish for an impromptu dinner party on a cold winter night.

Rating: 4
I have made this dish many times and do not alter the rib recipe (although I sometimes forget to put the herbs on the ribs the night before, in those cases I just put the herbs on before I sear the ribs and they turn out nicely). The piquancy of the gorgonzola polenta (admittedly, I do double the gorgonzola and use a very high quality cheese) along with the savory and tart gremolata cut the unctuousness of the ribs perfectly. The ribs melt in your mouth and the sauce compliments the gorgonzola polenta very nicely. I cant say enough about this recipe. It was probably our favorite new recipe of 2008!

I made these exactly as the recipe stated and they were an outstanding hit. My friends still talk about my ribs. Lucky for me I saved the recipe so I will try them out on a new crowd tomorrow. The fresh herbs and polenta are the perfect accompaniment to this tasty dish.

Can't say enough good things about this recipe. My sister says it's still the best thing she's ever eaten and that says a lot coming from someone who eats out a LOT! Don't skip the gremolata - it adds a nice bright flavor to this rich dish. Served it in large bowls and the polenta is fabulous.

Oh... my... goodness! SO delicious! The gremolata is a perfect enhancement, by the way, so don't skip it! I halved the recipe (only serving 4 people), used bone- in short ribs, and addded 1 cup of beef stock to the bottle of wine as I was concerned about the level of braising liquid. Thank goodness I did, because my Le Creuset 6qt dutch oven allowed all but 1 cup of the liquid to evaporate during the 2 hour oven time! Absolutely divine, velvety, rich sauce (and didn't have to bother with reducing on the stovetop), but keep an eye on the liquid level to avoid burning if you halve the recipe!

I've made this twice. After the braising and before the reducing, I stuck it outside in the cold and allowed the fat to solidify, so I could skim that way. Really helped. I agree this is a real crowd pleaser with better-than-restaurant quality results.

Rating: 4
Exceptional!!!! I made exactly as it called for.. Make sure and skim the fat, or it will be too greasy at the end. I also made the polenta, but had a suspicion I wouldn't like it, so I also made Yukon Gold and Fennel Puree w/Rosemary Butter (get it here...!!!) as a back-up and am so glad I did! I would have liked more sauce, so next time I will add some wine/beef stock to make more sauce.

Rating: 3
Fantastic...like Alain Ducasse takes on comfort food. I only refrigerated the ribs with the herb rub for about six hours, and I used boneless short ribs for two people (about 1.6 lbs, which was more than we could eat anyway). I also skipped the gremolata, which I know would be outstanding but I didn't have citrus on hand and the hub didn't mind. I did add a bit of beef stock to the wine, but mostly b/c I didn't want to use the whole bottle -- wanted us to drink some with dinner! I think the stock rounded out the sauce really nicely. These were absolutely restaurant-worthy. Hub said, "If I'd ordered these for $27 I'd be blown out of the water. Wow." Then we didn't speak for twenty minutes while we chowed down. Served with garlic mashed and steamed green beans (lemon juice on those, but leftover juice -- no fresh lemons to zest, as per above). So yummy. Would make for Thanksgiving if my guests wouldn't be sad at the lack of (much less tasty) turkey.

the end result was greasy and bland. if i were to repeat this recipe, i would definitely not add the butter at the end to "thicken" the sauce. the only deviation from the recipe is that i used dried herbs instead of fresh.

I confess, I always cheat when I make this and use half wine/half beef stock for the sauce. I haven't had good luck in the past with sauces made only from wine. That said, this is super easy cooked in the slow cooker, and works with short ribs, pot roast, or any other tough, fatty cut of beef. This has become a regular in our household, and is always a hit with guests.

This recipe was so amazing on the first try that I went out to buy a Dutch oven to make it again. The first time, the lid on my pot wasn't heavy enough and the wine evaporated too quickly. I made the whole menu as printed, and it was amazing! One word of warning though. If you are at all prone to migraines, the combination of the reduced wine and the gorgonzola cheese will certainly give you problems, so you will need to partake in small quantities.

Made this exactly as the recipe is written and it was sensational! The overnight marinating with the herbs is important, don't skip any steps - this is a truly an amazing dish. I did make gorgonzola mashed potatoes instead of polenta s we are not big fans of polenta. The gremolata is key to the flavors so take make the effort! I used a big robust California cab and it was worth the extra few dollars as it really makes the sauce so rich. Yummy! Making this again next weekend for the same friends I made it for in November as they requested the dish!!! Served it with minted sugar snap peas, the gorgonzola mashed potatoes and a nice red wine - perfect.

I've made them twice now, with bone-in and boneless ribs. Both were excellent. The boneless break apart easier so I will go with these in the future. I baked them in the oven for two hours, refrigerated over night, removed the 1/2 inch of fat, and then cooked in the crock pot for another 4 hours. These were melt-in-your-mouth. The polenta and gremolata are a must. I froze the extra gremolata and it had lost most of it's punch. I won't do that again.

We made this last weekend for a 24 person sit-down dinner and it was excellent and surprisingly easy. We made the ribs the night before per the "do ahead" portion of the recipe and substituted the polenta recipe with "Enrico's Easy Polenta", on the back of the bag of Golden Pheasant Polenta (Safeway/Von's). Just add 3 oz of gorgonzola and 1 tsp of minced rosemary into the recipe and bake as directed.

Rating: 4
This was FAB-U-LOUS. I usually use a combination of regular and boneless short ribs. I also cheated a bit and used one bottle of wine and subbed beef broth for the remainder of the liquid. It was still plenty "wine-y". The sauce with the gorgonzola polenta was to die for.

Rating: 4
This is excellent! A few notes - the gremolata is a must, it wouldn't be the same without it. I used boneless short ribs from Costco and they are perfect for this recipe. The polenta cooks up quick so make this your last item to finish - it's done in less than 10 minutes. Also, I used Charles Shaw based on another review. I browned the meat, put in the crock pot, brought the wine to a simmer and scraped up the brown bits and then added it to the crock pot and cooked on low overnight. In the morning it was a little "zesty" (ie. cheap wine taste) and I was nervous about how it would taste for dinner. However it had the day to rest and for the flavors to meld and it was excellent - I will use Charles Shaw next time I make it. It was also easy because everything was done except for the polenta and I could actually visit with my guests without a lot of last minute prep work and my kitchen was clean! A dream come true recipe.

This was great! I followed the recommendations about skimming off the fat, and the cut of meat is still a bit fatty, but not overly so. Very, very delicious and rich. I would say that I needed almost five cups of chicken broth for polenta for four, so have some extra on hand!

Simply scrumptious for a cold winter's night. OK - so it takes some effort, but the results were sooo worth it! I did add a bunch of sliced shallots to the pot before cooking - highly recommend the extra depth of flavor. Cooled the ribs, removed fat, bone and connective tissue before serving over the polenta. Pot roast, my eye! Also try over fettucini with sage brown butter - divine!

One of the best combinations I've had. Adding the gorgonzola to the polenta seemed to make the polenta foolproof, rich and creamy. I found some of the meatiest ribs I've seen and they were fall-off-the-bone tender with very bold flavors with some interesting complexity.

Unlike most reviewers I wasn't a fan of this recipe. I'm not sure if my short ribs were too fatty but they just weren't that fantastic.

OK......I know it's against the "rules", but I made this with a rump roast cut into 1 1/2" cubes - followed the recipe otherwise, and didn't have the fat to deal with since I trimmed the meat. Used two buck Chuck for the Cab. Absolutely delicious! Served with roasted baby carrots and a green salad. My DH who can be fussy about "new" recipes raved about it - definitely a keeper and will be a company dish since everything but the polenta can be prepared ahead. Will try it with the short ribs and maybe even venture with lamb shanks since the flavors seem harmonious.....

I made this exactly as is, used $9 Concha y Toro CSD cabernet and 7 lbs of meaty ribs to feed 8 people. Be sure to skim the fat as completely as possible and don't make my mistake and get so drunk you forget the gremolata until everyone has eaten as it does make the dish. Even without it though, everyone raved - a big hit.

Fabulous!! Had a difficult time finding polenta. Trader Joe's did not have it as another reviewer commented. I went to 5 stores. I even went to a Mexican Grocery Store. I gave up...it is really corn meal. I bought a medium coasre corn meal as I couldn't find the coarse. Everything else was easy. A keeper.

I've made this a couple of times, both times in the crock pot. I used boneless short ribs the first time, and a pot roast after (since the short ribs seemed identical to pot roast when they were finished cooking). I also halved the meat quantity and the recipe still fed 8 for a dinner party, plus another dinner for 4 (and a couple of lunches!). The only real ingredient change was that I switched out the lemon rind in the gremolata and used orange rind instead. Delicious! This one's a new favorite.

Definitely will do this again! I made this for friends and got rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and the combination of the short ribs, creamy gorgonzola polenta and gremolata made a fabulous meal. Made the ribs the day before to make it easier to skim the fat. So much of the meal can be made ahead of time that it really makes for an easy prep the day of your dinner party.

This is a fantastic recipe. I didn't change any ingredients. However, instead of braising in the oven, after browning the short ribs I put them and the liquid in a crockpot. Cooked it on low for 8 hours, removed the meat and bones, put the liquid through a fat separator and reduced the remaining liquid on the stovetop. In addition to the tender meat, the gremolata is the key to the flavor. I'm recommending this recipe to all my friends!

For the most part do not stray from the recipe.

Frankly I thought these were brilliant. Went to a local McLean butcher for the meat (which I think makes a big diffrence), used 3 bottles of a $10 chilean cab (certainly drinkable), and added garlic and a splash of olive oil to the 'rub'. Served over Gorgonzola mash instead. All 10lbs of meat was consumed. Was a huge hit for the lads night (perhaps we'll get the wives involved next time!). Loads of compliments. Great recipe for the few ingredients. Will def make again.

Everyone really enjoyed these, and the gorgonzola polenta was really good. Definately need to make ahead so you have time to chill and skim off the fat. When it's hot it's too hard to get the fat off the top. After browning the meat, I deglazed the pan, added the liquid to the ribs, then browned some onions and garlic. I liked them, but it was a little fatty for me. Very rich.

My ribs were rpeety greasy, but I got rid of most of it. I cooked them for 3 hours because they wern't tender after 2 hours. I used half wine and half beef broth.

This was delicious and beautiful. It did have a slight similarity to pot roast like another review mentioned but far more gourmet. What I did different; before I browned my short ribs, I infused the olive oil with smashed garlic and rosemary. After I browned is I sauted some onions in the same pot and then deglazed with a red wine and beef broth. Everything was delicious and looked beautiful! It was a nice fancy Saturday night dinner. Oh, the short ribs were on the fatty side which was my only dislike about the meal.

I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. It was very fatty/greasy and I purchased my meat from (high end) Central Market. I thought the polenta was good, my husband thought the gorgonzola was too overpowering. The gremolata did help, but overall not worth the time and calories.

I'm reviewing the recipe exactly as written and presented in the picture. It was fantastic. I used excellent meat from Bristol Farms and had no problems with excess fat (had to add oil while I was browning the meat). I had a little fat after the wine reduction, which I removed with my turkey baster. Use a decent cabernet, as it affects the flavor of the ribs and the sauce. The presentation was beautiful. DON'T SKIP THE GREMOLATA. Judging by the "wow" comments followed by complete silence as the meal was consumed, I would say this recipe will be in my top 10. In the future, I would add a little garlic and some portabello mushrooms just to experiment - not because the recipe needs any changes.

This dish was outstanding--delicious braised ribs and the burst of flavour from the gremolata. The polenta was very rich but went very well with the ribs. A special dish and very comfroting.

This was incredibly easy to make, presented very well, and was quite tasty. We used grass-fed short ribs, and there was no problem with excess fat. Forgot to make the gremolata, and the dish was hearty and satisfying without, but it would be a nice addition, I suspect. Instead we served with very fresh halved cherry tomatoes,which balanced things nicely. By the way, don't use a good cab in this recipe, any robust and cheap red wine will do.

Very bland. Gremolata saved the day. Will not make again

Don't let the lukewarm reviews fool you. This recipe is SO VERY GOOD. The meat is flavorful and very tender. The polenta, red wine sauce and gremolata are the perfect blend. I made this dish for a dinner party of 6 adults and 2 kids. Everyone raved and commented that this is something they would love to find on the menu of their favorite restaurant. A few people invited me to come live with them so I could cook meals like this for them at home! :) As one other reviewer mentioned, it would be easier to skim off the grease if you have time to let the braising liquid cool a bit. I got most of it off while still hot, however, and excess grease was not a problem in the final product. Just a delicious dish with a lovely presentation.

The sauce lacked flavor but the ribs, polenta, and gremolata were all good. I would suggest adding some mirepoix and beef stokck to bump up the flavor of the braising liquid.

We are having a dinner party in a few weeks, and based on some of the lukewarm reviews, decided to do a dry run with these ribs last night. I am surprised that some thought they were not flavorful. Considering the few ingredients, these were extremely flavorful. The meat was tender. Delicious paired with the polenta. Will definitely make this for guests and I don't plan on adding thing because it just doesn't need it.

Great Recipe, I read the review before making it, I added leaks, lemon juice and Fresh Fennel to the braising sauce before putting it into the oven. I did not put any of the juices back in after the initial browning of the meat as the reciped stated, the sauce was flavorful, rich and not the least bit fatty, I will definately make this again.

I made this for my family and...there are parts we liked and parts we could have done without. The gremolata made the meal - really made a huge difference in the flavor of the sauce. I would use a different cut of meat next time...the short rib meat was flavorful, but a bit gristly. I think I would do blue cheese mashers next time...the polenta was good, but not a hit with the kids (who generally are pretty adventuresome eaters). Felt like a gourmet pot roast. Missing something. I would likely use a different cut of meat (maybe a pot roast) and add some mushrooms. I also did it in stages, and has a LOT of grease that I skimmed off. After seeing how much, I can't imagine not having removed it ALL!

I had a dinner party last night and everyone loved it. I personally thought the cab sauce and the polenta was a bit strong. It was easy to make although time consuming. I had no problem with grease.

Some of these reviews are spot on! I made the recipe exactly as written and what I got was bland, braised beef. I made it in stages so I was able to remove AN INCH of grease from the pot after it cooled overnight. But this dish is definitely missing something and not worth the time or two good bottles of Cab!

I agree with Cook from NY, this was missing flavor in a big way. I felt it was very bland even with the gremolata (which I love). The gorgonzola polenta was great. The recipe looked great, but did not deliver on taste.

this recipe ws missing something - flavor! boring braised beef. how about some onions? mushrooms? broth or even a tomato would have been nice.

I really loved the short ribs, easy to make compared with some short rib recipes. I failed miserably, however, with the polenta. It was my first attempt at making, followed directions so not sure where I went wrong.

Four forks from me: Not only is this absolutely delicious but it was exceedingly easy to make, and is a lovely presentation. I had no issues at all with the grease that some have had, (although further readers should take caution and make sure they remove as much grease as possible) and the reduction made a lovely dark rich sauce. The gorgonzola was the perfect amount for the polenta- just a hint to make it interesting and balance the redwine sauce. DO NOT leave out the gremolata- I tasted the dish without it and then with it and it takes the tastebuds to a higher level- from apprentice to master. The hint of citrus and the earthy freshness of the herbs was a much needed balance to the heavier qualities of sauce and polenta. Cheers to you BonAp!!!

Read ciacontra's advice below. My sauce was an absolute greasy mess, and I bought good ribs from a butcher. Next time I'm going to make it ahead, give myself time to let the pan contents cool so I can get rid of the grease before proceeding with the sauce. I had to throw it all out and start over again with some wine to make a quick sauce, and it wasn't very good at all. The rest was good, and I agree that the gremolata is necessary.

Easy to make...cooks itself. Meat was tasty...but the concensus was that it tasted like pot roast. Oh well.

Plate licking good! This was sooooo good, my husband couldn't stop raving that it was better than a 5 star restaurant meal. Try it!

Delicious! A word of caution. I halved the recipe (only feeding 3) and did 50/50 short ribs and spare ribs (bought the last short ribs in the store). Everything went great until it came time to make the sauce. All I can say is that you need to watch the amount of fat rendered out of the ribs and compensate accordingly, say by using a gravy separator. The sauce separated into a delicious thick wine reduction and a clear layer of (admittedly tasty but unappealing) grease. I poured a ladle on top of one of the plates before I realized this, it became mine and I used a tablespoon to drain the excess grease off. The others I was more careful with. The ribs are tender and when you get a good fatty bite with the polenta it's divine. Don't skip the gremolata either, it gives the dish a great little somethin' somethin'.

This is absolutely delicious! Highly recommended, serve with the suggested polenta and it is DIVINE.

This is exceptional! the wine gives the sauce a nice acidity, and the gorgonzola keeps the polenta from being too sweet.!
