This is an excellent pizza with a rich, roasty-smokey flavor. The sauce is so good I plan to use it on other pizzas, though it was a little too moist. Next time I'll just roast all of the tomatoes -- it doesn't need the extra moisture of the raw tomato. I seasoned the eggplant slices and cut them into bite-sized pizzas before assembling the pizza. I also cheated and used a store-bought pizza dough, and a little more cheese than the recipe calls for.

I have a successful pizza dough recipe, so used that with this topping and it was very good. We liked it so much, we made it twice in one month. I'd recommend baking the pizzas without cheese for about 8-10 minutes, then add the cheese at the end. It keeps the base from getting soggy.

What a great idea for pizza sauce! I also roasted a bell pepper and, when I removed the eggplant slices, added two cloves of garlic, sliced. For toppings, I also sliced a bell pepper and a tomato. Yum!

This pizza is really very good. I roasted a few red peppers, sliced, with the eggplant, and added them to the top of the pizza. The crust was crackery, but I see this as decidedly better than soggy! I probably won't make this pizza again, just because there are so many exciting recipes out there, but I do recommend trying it!

Will definitely make this again. Extremely easy. Bought the pizza bases and had to use normal mozzarella as we could not find smoked mozzarella, was still great. The roasted tomato and eggplant sauce is amazing. Added crushed garlic on the bases. Eggplant slices could do with a bit more seasoning.

This pizza has a nice blend of flavors. I chopped the eggplant into large pieces after roasting because the full slices seemed like they would be too much of a good thing. Use lots of fresh basil, it really shines in this recipe. I hadn't tried smoked mozzarella before, and it was really tasty. I probably used a bit more cheese than the recipe called for.

Nice crust. Could use a bit more cheese, but this must have been designed to be low fat.

This pizza received great reviews as a Father's Day hors d'oeuvre. I did cheat (due to lack of time) and purchased prepared pizza dough but it still was wonderful.
