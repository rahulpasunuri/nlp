Usually only a salt and pepper and bone-in ribeye girl but I tried this for change after seeing it in Food Network Magazine. I used sweet paprika, but it still seemed a little bitter and could have benefited from some brown sugar. I will stick to my salt & pepper and bone-in ribeye.

This is very similar to my "house" rub, but I also add some ground coffee and brown sugar--the hint of sweetness is a really nice touch. Great recipe!
