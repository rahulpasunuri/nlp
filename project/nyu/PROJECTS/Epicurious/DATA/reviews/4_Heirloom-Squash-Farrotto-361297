Delicious! The blend of flavors of the veggies, farro, and the yogurt sauce was fantastic. It was also really easy to make. This will definitely become a regular dish.

Four forks is a rare rating for me but this is a very good recipe. I sprinkled barberries on the finished product and would recommend adding them during the last few minutes of cooking.

Served with sauteed chard and mustard greens... absolutely delicious. Will become a winter staple. YUM!

Truly delicious! I loved all the textures and flavors. The yogurt sauce is a must. I couldn't find farro, so I used spelt berries, which were fantastic. To save time, use ground cumin and add it to the pan after sauteing the garlic and onion. A perfect hearty one-dish meal.

This was truly enjoyed by everyone at Christmas dinner. Farro is hard to find and expensive, and pearled barley would be a great substitute with no loss of texture and flavor. Be sure to make the yogurt sauce.

We really enjoyed this cold-weather, week-night dish. The farro was a little hard to find, but worth it. I did make some changes. Used ground cumin and skipped toasting and grinding in the interest of time. Stirred some chopped cilantro into the yogurt sauce. Tossed the uncooked squash with ½ tsp cumin. The squash cooked too quickly; next time I'll roast it at 375. Toasted the farro in the pan in a little olive oil, then added chicken broth, rather than water. Used a serrano chile, and passed the remaining chile at the table to adjust heat to taste. Omitted the garbanzos as we aren't fans. Toasted walnuts and goat cheese would be nice additions. This is fabulous on its own, and would also be good with sausage or rotisserie chicken. Might even try it with lamb and replace the cilantro with mint.

Not only delicious, but very pretty too. I made as written and found this a very appealing complete meal. The combination of textures and flavors is delicious. Even the warm farrotto and cool sauce is a nice contrast. Makes a very generous four servings, enough for my family of five with 2 teenagers. Will certainly make it again, but I might make more so I have leftovers to take to the office, I like it that much.

The combination of flavors and textures and temps is just sublime. Fast and easy and beautiful. I made exactly as written and served with chard sauteed with a little pomegranate molasses. A great, nourishing, exciting meal.

Great flavor combo. Couldn't find farro, so I used barley, which worked well. Garnished with chopped green onions instead of red onion, which I was afraid would be too harsh. Fantastic sauce!

This recipe was really good. I made it as written. The yogurt dressing was tasty and next time I will make extra to drizzle on top. I will make it again.

It was a delicious change. I left out the yogurt/cumin topping and halved the farro & squash amounts (all I had handy at home). Added some browned local andouille sausage and had a great one dish meal. My husband gave the thumbs up & it will be added to our repertoire.

Four forks is "exceptional," and I wouldn't say this is, but it is delicious and hearty. More rustic than refined, so for me, coupled with the raw onions, this is more a family dish than a company one. Served with spanakopita and tzatziki, with amaretti and espresso for dessert.

Lots of great flavors going on here. Made it exactly as instructed. YUM. Nice to see another use for farro.

This was to die for! The yogurt balanced the other flavors quite nicely. I thought that toasting and grinding the cumin seeds added a deep pungency that balanced the richness of the yogurt. In a word: Yum.

This was excellent! Unlike anything we have made before. It came together fairly easily... I had lots of time to chop while the farro and squash were cooking, and the final assembly took about 5 minutes. The yogurt was the perfect thing to tie it all together, very tangy and flavorful. The only change I made was to use pre-ground cumin rather than toasting and grinding it myself. We will definitely make it again!
