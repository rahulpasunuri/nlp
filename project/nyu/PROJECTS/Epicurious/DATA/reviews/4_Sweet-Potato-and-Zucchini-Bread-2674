I add two heaping tablespoons of peeled fresh grated ginger and an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. You can also bag the zucchini and just use two cups of sweet potato. I do cut the sugar to 3/4 cup of brown and half a cup of white. Sometimes I sprinkle pecans on top and forget the walnuts, which I hate. It is a delicious delicious sweet potato ginger bread that I go to when I want people to fawn all over me...

Gah! Usually I read at least some reviews before making a recipe and boy do I regret not doing that this time! Far far far too much sugar in the recipe as written to the point of being almost inedible. I think the basic idea is ok, although much more cakey than muffiny. Don't know, maybe I'll try it again, but probably not.

Because of allergies, I made this recipe dairy-, egg- and nut-free. I also left out the zucchini because of poor grocery store trip planning! For the egg, I substituted 1 Tbsp. unsweetened applesauce and 1 Tbsp. Canola Oil for each egg. For milk, I always substitute an equal amount of water, or Coconut Milk - I buy the beverage kind in a carton vs. the thicker version that comes canned. Because I had no zucchini on hand, I doubled the amount of sweet potato puree (bought canned at Whole Foods Market). Next time I make this delicious bread, I will reduce both the sugar and the oil by about 25%. I expect anything of mine that is baked to come out heavy (although, having been allergic to dairy and eggs since infancy, I have little to compare it to). This bread comes out very moist, very flavorful, and very dense. I am accustomed to that and enjoy the texture, but tinkering with the applesauce substitution (adding a bit more), reducing the overall oil, and reducing the sugar might help the texture a bit. I also found the recipe made not quite two whole 9" loaf pans. If I had just put the batter into one, it would definitely have overflowed all over my oven. When cooled, I sliced one loaf into thick slices, placed them into individual "snack" sized sandwich bags, placed those into a gallon freezer ziploc, and have been having slices one at a time when the urge strikes me. From freezer straight to microwave for 50 seconds, or put into the toaster oven. Great with tea of coffee.

I followed the other reviewer's advice for halving the sugar and oil. Turns out the sugar level was just perfect even with half. The bread however was a little on the dry side. I will definitely try 2/3 of the oil/butter mixture next. I thought the flavors were good but didn't blow me away.

I love this recipe, although I make some changes. I use beets instead of sweet potatoes (because I have an abundance of them in August), but I prefer golden beets to really red ones so the loaf doesn't turn a bright crimson. It works either way, though. And I cut the oil and sugar just slightly. I also skip toasting the walnuts because I'm lazy. It turns out great every time though, no matter what I do. Also, I usually do 1.5 this recipe so that I can have two full loaves ( I give the extra one to my husband's office-mate.)

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe, especially when zucchini is in season. I have found that the zucchini needs to be drained and squeezed free of as much liquid as possible, even though the recipe doesn't say to do this. I halved the sugar and omitted the nuts so everyone in the family could eat the bread. Instead of using 3/4 c of oil, I used 1/2 c of applesauce and 1/4 of oil. As suggested by another reviewer, I doubled this recipe and it made one standard size loaf of bread and 12 muffins. The loaf baked for one hour, the muffins for 23 minutes at 350 degrees.

I followed this recipe fairly closely except for all of the recommendations to reduce the sugar. Epic fail... I must have cooked this bread for over 2 hours and it never baked. At first I thought there was an issue with my oven, but that is not the case. It was a gushy, pudding-like mess. Maybe there was too much liquid released by the zucchini? Not sure, but I will be going back to my other zucchini bread recipe.

I made this recipe without nuts because I didn't have any on hand and it came out spectacular. The outside was a sweet, crispy crust while the inside was moist and delicious.

I made this completely as directed and it was amazing. The next time, I did cut down the sweetness (I ran out of sugar too, so used xylitol... tasted just the same). We stopped putting nuts in, but that is our family's preference. I would recommend cutting down a cup on the sugar. I always double the recipe because it goes so fast. When doubled, the recipe makes two 9x5x3 pans, and 12 muffins. The muffins bake for about 20 minutes, and the pans bake for about 1 hour.

LOVE this recipe! I made a couple of modifications: substituted regular flour with 1 c whole wheat flour, 1 c almond meal; substituted 1/2 of oil with apple sauce; substituted sugar with 1.5 c agave. Added 1/2 c of ground, toasted flax as well. It is a bit heavier, but filled with protein.

Loved this, doubling it successfully. Made one loaf and nearly 3 dozen muffins. I substituted 1/4 of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, and 1/2 of the sweet potato with carrot. Punched it up a bit with pumpkin spice too instead of using all cinnamon.

Excellent recipe. Sweet, but not too sweet. Really yummy. Followed some other reviewers' suggestions and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup. No other mods. So good! Will definitely make again. Next time, muffins!

I made this with some tweaks based on other reader's recommendations: Replaced half the flour with whole wheat; cut oil to 1/4 cup; cut sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. Also added 1/4 cup chocolate chips instead of walnuts. My vegetable-averse toddler gobbled it up. Next time I think I might cut sugar even more and try adding more veg.

Nice taste, but waaaaaaay too much oil. I sometimes like to do the original recipe and tweak it myself the second time since you never know if the difference in recipes is user ability. In this case, I should have listened and cut my oil by half. Used sweet potatoes grown in the garden and slivered nuts I had in the house.

LIke the other reviewers, I tweaked this recipe for delicious results. Substituted 1 cup whole white wheat flour, reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cup, reduced oil to 1/4 cup, added 1/4 cup yogurt, substituted grated carrots for the sweet potato. I would have added raisins, too, but my daughter doesn't like them...

This bread is wonderful and also makes yummy muffins! We had a huge amount of zucchini in our garden this year, so I made many muffins and loaves of bread with this recipe. I shared with family and friends, and they all agreed that this was a moist, flavorful recipe! I cut down on the sugar and oil a bit, and they were still outstanding!

I followed the reviews and cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups. I add mini chocolate chips instead of walnuts. FANTASTIC! After doubling the recipe (I had a lot of zucchini to get rid of), I ended up making 2 small loaves and 6 muffins. Needless to say, even that amount was gone fast.

After reading the other reviews, I made the bread with the following adjustments: 1 cup all purpose flour; 1 cup for whole wheat flour; ¼ cup vegetable oil; ½ cup greek yogurt; 1 ½ cups grated carrots instead of sweet potato. The upside was I slightly overcooked it, but it was still very moist. I cooked them in a muffin pan and it was overdone at 26 minutes. The downside was it tasted too "whole wheaty" and the cinnamon taste was too strong. In an effort to use as much whole wheat flour as possible I'll keep tweaking the flours ratio, but I will definitely cut the cinnamon in half.

Rating: 4
Super tasty! Like other reviewers, I reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups, reduced oil to 1/3 of a cup, and added a 6oz container of plain Greek yogurt. I got a 9 inch loaf and 5 medium muffins out of this. Will be making this one again!

Rating: 4
Like everyone else, I read the reviews and adjusted the recipe accordingly. I cut back on the sugar to 1 1/2, but substituted light brown sugar for the 1/2 cup, substituted 1 cup of all purpose flour with whole wheat flour, applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil (you need to keep a little fat in :- )), and carrots for the sweet potato because I had so many from my CSA share. I grated both the zucchini and carrots rather finely, and split the batter into to two loaves. They baked up perfectly!! Delicious. I brought a piece in a for a coworker and she raved about it!!

Waittttt - a standard loaf pan is WAY too small - it's baking in my oven nwo - no, baking all over my oven - spilled all over - had to open oven and scoop out about 2 cups of batter - what a mess! Make it in 2 loaf pans, or maybe in a ~ 9 x 13 standard sheet cake pan - but not in one loaf pan. I should have forseen this - the batter came almost to the top of the loaf pan when I poured it in.

I have made this recipe twice now and everyone LOVES it! It is moist and flavorful. I have tried it with 100% whole wheat flour, and cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used the 1/2 C non-fat greek yogurt and 1/3 C of oil and it is delicious. I also doubled the recipe and got 3 loaf pans out of it. I will make it again and again.

This is an extremely forgiving recipe. I added 1/2 cup apple sauce and cut down the oil to 1/2 cup, added another 1.5 cups shredded zucchini and used grated carrot instead of sweet potatoe. The batter seemed a bit wet so I added about another 1.5 cups whole wheat flour. This made two small loaves. The bread was very moist and flavourful. Will definitely make again!

Fantastic recipe! Followed the suggestion to drop the sugar to 1.5c. Definitely didn't miss the extra sugar. Also substituted 1c whole wheat flour, added some ground flax seed and added 1 peeled, cooked & smashed large apple in place of 1/2c of oil. I will make this again and again.

So scrumptious and so healthy! My four forks are for the recipe as modified. When I saw the 3/4 cup of oil, I thought, "yuk," and read through the other reviews to see what other cooks had done. Many, many of them substituted something else for the oil. So, (1) I substituted a half-cup of flaxseed meal and a half-cup of plain Greek yogurt for the oil. Because of allergies, I also (2) used maple sugar and reduced it to 1 1/2 cups and (3) substituted the regular flour with 1 cup spelt and 1 cup kamut flour. I also used a fine grate with the vegetables, so that they looked like vermicelli. For me the recipe made 1 9x5 loaf pan and 6 medium muffins, one of which is already gone and the loaf hasn't even finished baking.

Rating: 4
This is a knockout. I only had pecans and I don't think that made a difference, the pecans go very well in this loaf. (I didn't bother toasting them). I could see how it would be as good with a little less sugar, but I didn't find it too sweet as it was. Tip: You only need one medium zucchini and one medium yam to get the 1.5 cu each shredded. I was unsure at the store and overbought.

I've been making this bread for years, and after having tried numerous different zucchini bread recipes, am so happy I was turned onto this one by a friend. The sweetness is huge, and though sweet is not necessarily a bad thing, I did make a couple of changes: increased the flour by a couple of T., decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup (trust me when I say that 1/2 cup decrease is JUST fine), used more vanilla but a bit less oil. Loved (loved, loved) the sweet potato in here, and the loaf ended up moist, sweet and dense. Try this - you'll love it.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner as is, without any changes, it looked great and tasted even better; it disappeared off of the buffet table in no time.

I made several of the changes noted, reduced the sugar, replaced sweet potatoes with carrots made muffins instead of bread. Additionally, I replaced the oil with ricotta and when baked and cooled frosted the muffins with a brown sugar cream cheese frosting. These muffins met with rave reviews.

This is an excellent base recipe, though I made several healthier changes which worked very well. Substituted 1 C whole wheat pastry flour for 1 C of all purpose, reduced sugar to 1 C, reduced oil to 1/2 C, and substituted shredded carrots for the sweet potato. Also, instead of a loaf I made 15 muffins, and cooked it about 35-40 minutes. Very moist and light, and quite beautiful with the shreds of green and orange. Very easy too, and will make again and again.

This was delicious. I made quite a few mods: - I used half King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour, half APF - I halved the sugar - I halved the oil and used applesauce for the rest - I used shredded carrots instead of sweet potato - I successfully doubled the recipe and baked in two small bundt cake pans for a little under an hour

Thank you for your comments about the sugar and oil. Had a lot of leftover shredded zucchini (I was trying to substitute it for pasta). So, following your comments, the changes I made were 1) the grated zucchini was quite dry, 2) used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda and 3) used a can of Trader Joe's sweet potato puree 4) added about 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chips. It all fit in one loaf pan, which I think is because my grated zucchini was dry. No oil, no applesauce. It's quite good, but I don't think I would have dared exclude the fat if not for your reviews. Thank you.

Used a little over 1 cup zucchini and 3/4 C walnuts (that's all I had) and 1 1/2 C sugar as suggested by others. Made one loaf and 6 regular sized muffins. Delicious, moist, flavorful and not too sweet, just right. A great way to end the summer and welcome fall.

A pretty good recipe, indeed...however I was hoping to taste the sweet potatoes a little bit more, I doubled the recipe, cut the sugar in half and only added 1/4 cup of oil, the rest I used apple sauce...it turned out just moist enough :-). I had enough for 2 loaves and 6 muffins...very nice!

Epic fail. I doubled the ingredients and tried to make this recipe as muffins (something I do all the time with good results). First off, these stayed completely wet in the center despite my baking them three times as long as called for. And, yeah, my oven works just fine. Then, a few hours after they'd cooled, they were like petrified hockey pucks. Again, epic fail.

Yummy! I followed the other reviewers modifications and added only one cup of sugar and 2 cups zucchini. I made a loaf and cupcakes. Didn't need to bakes for as long as the recipe indicated. Also, I made it gluten free subbing out rice flour. I forgot the Xanthum gum but it still held together nicely. I'll make again.

If you're swimming in zucchini and tired of plain old zuc bread, this is a nice change of pace. I used half wheat flour, 1/2c of white and brown sugar and reduced the oil to just 1/3c. Used untoasted Pecans and didn't notice a difference. Turned out moist and plenty sweet. Much too much batter for one pan though. But not quite enough for two loaves. I just used a larger loaf pan.

Rating: 4
This is really excellent - but i'd suggest making every alteration suggested: - cut the sugar for sure - use more vegetable - cut oil in half and use applesauce or yogurt in its place also, it makes *way* too much batter for the recommended pan size. next time i'll try muffin tins, but be ready with another pan if you stick with the loaf.

Rating: 3
I made it per the recipe and should have followed the suggestions here: - cut the sugar by a ton - cut the volume or use something larger than recommended, or some combination of pans - my bet is that the replacement of half the flour with whole wheat and applesauce or yogurt for half the oil would be fine too all that said, it was certainly good enough to try again with those modifications.

Rating: 3
Its a good recipe. For the first batch, I followed the recipe word to word. That resulted in a lot of batter. My bread pan (9x5) filled to over 3/4 of its height and this lead to overflow during the baking process. The taste turned out to be fine (a little on the sweeter side though) but the crust wasn't perfectly shaped due to overflow. For the second loaf, I used 3/4 the stated quantity for all ingredients and 1 cup (1/2 the stated quantity) sugar. The second loaf was perfect in texture and taste - there was no overflow and the sweetness was ideal too.

Rating: 3
Good texture, but it was a little too sweet as some reviewers have said. I don't think I'd halve the sugar next time, but will definitely pull back a bit on the proposed 2 cups.. I also added chocolate chips, but I think raisins would work better next time.

Living in Tanzania I had to make a few adjustments to this recipe, but my husband and daughter both love it. First, I cut the sugar in half (and last time used just 3/4 of a cup). I was feeding to my 11 month old and didn't want so much sugar. We also didn't have an vegetable oil, so I mashed 1/4 of an avocado with a Tbs of olive oil. The cake was very moist. Finally, since we only had zucchini, I used 3 cups grated instead of adding sweet potato. No walnuts either, so the bread was nut-free. Finally, we don't have bread pans, so I used a 9x9 square, and adjusted the cooking time (just kept a close eye it). This has become a stable for using the organic zucchini we can get our hands on here.

This is the best way to use zucchini. I have made this a few times and it always came out perfect, moist and tasty. I use half of the sugar and half the oil. This last batch, I added a dense, dark chocolate bar chopped up. It received the best rave reviews from my guests many of whom are chocoholics.

I love this recipe and made it this weekend for the fourth time. A couple of months ago, my kitchen was burgeoning with zucchini and sweet potatoes, so I shredded them using my food processor shredder attachment, and froze them in 1.5 cup portions to see if they could be used later in this recipe. They can. This recipe is great and will be in my repertoire with some regularity. It is excellent toasted with a luxurious portion of butter.

Mmmmm, delicious and simple! Used half whole wheat flour, cut oil to 1/2 cup, adding 1/4C yogurt, half the sugar and also used half brown sugar, and then some freshly grated nutmeg thrown in with it all. You can't make an orange AND green veggie taste better!

Made these as muffins and they turned out great- the bake time was about 15 min. Omitted nuts but would add them next time as the texture was slightly blah. They had a cake-like texture. I used 1 1/2 C sugar but next time I'll try using the whole 2 C (I like my muffins sweet). A great muffin to ring in the Fall season!

I have an egg allergy in our house. I used ENER-Gs egg replacer for the 3 eggs, putting the egg replacer in with the dry ingredients (4.5 tsp) and the wet ingredients with the oil (6 T of milk. water would have been okay too) I also reduced the sugar and used 1c sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar. Worked great!! Will definitely make these again. Will work well as cupcakes too. I may try this recipe with flour substitute for a gluten free variety - will let you know if it's absolutely horrible.

I would make this recipe again! After reading the other reviews, I made the following modifications: Instead of 2 C sugar, I used 1 C sugar plus ½ C brown sugar. Instead of ¾ C of vegetable oil, I used ½ C vegetable oil, ¼ C Greek yogurt (no regular yogurt in my frige). Here's a big change - I used two loaf pans instead of one. I looked at all that batter and didn't think it would fit into one pan. With two pans, I reduced the baking time and took them out of the oven after 57 minutes. I just sliced off one of the ends for a taste test and it tastes great. I really wanted a moist zucchini bread and that is exactly what I got!

Really good - even though I realized that I'd forgotten the oil entirely when the loaf was already in the oven.

Wonderful recipe! I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup and used whole wheat flour. I think it is important to squeeze out the water from the shredded vegetables first by pressing them in a strainer. I have used other vegetables and fruits in this recipe with great results--winter squash and bananas--as long as the veggies are dry and equal 3 cups.

I make this for my two-year-old twins all of the time and they absolutely love it. I reduce the sugar to 1 cup (and can't imagine making it with 2 cups - I think it would taste like cake). To make it more healthy, I also use brown sugar instead of white, and whole wheat flour, and it is really yummy. Depending on what I have on hand, I've also made it with all sweet potato and that is great too.

Great bread. My quick breads aren't usually too good, but this one tasted great despite falling, as usual for me. After reading the other reviews I made the following changes: Instead of 2 C. sugar I used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 C. brown and about 1 T. agave nectar. Instead of the 3/4 C. oil, I used 1/4 C. canola oil and 1/2 C. apple sauce. Instead of 2 t. cinnamon, I used 1 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. ginger. I had pecans instead of walnuts and I added some lemon zest. I may have used a yam instead of a sweet potato, but my 4 year old is devouring it as I write this so I won't complain. The bread is sweet, but definitely not super-sweet. Also, I made a single recipe, but put it in two loaf pans. It didn't stick, and both loaves are pretty good size.

Delicious bread! I followed others' suggestions and made the following changes: substitute 1c whole wheat flour, use 1/4c applesauce and 1/2c oil, use 1c granulated sugar and 1/2c brown sugar. Despite being a bit on the sticky side (it was a little tricky getting out of the pan), this bread turned out wonderfully! My roommate devoured half of it the night I made it.

I used all whole wheat flour, added nutmeg, 1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup pineapple and dried cranberries. I like them, they taste very natural, not sure my 18 month old will like them. If she doesn't, I may follow the recipe the next time I make them.

Yum! Made this with some of the revisions suggested by earlier reviewers - less sugar, less oil, subs of applesauce and yogurt for the oil. Also put some nutmeg in with it all. Used some oat bran, ground flax seed along with whole wheat flour for the all purpose. Worth making again for sure, and some healthy ingredients.

Yum! Added extra 1/2 cup walnuts ('cause I love 'em) and made these in mini-muffin tins instead. 2 batches of 24 each, baked at listed temp, for only 12 minutes. A perfect addition for kindergarten graduation potluck picnic.

I have been making this recipe since my girls were babies (now they are 8&9) and now it is their favorite to make with me. However, like the other reviewers we have made adjustments: 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2-3/4 C white sugar (in place of 2C sugar) 1/2 C canola oil (instead of 3/4 C veg. oil) shred 1 whole large sweet potato and 1 whole large zucchini- whatever that comes to but is always more than what is required by the recipe Enjoy- my girls always tell their friends that they taste as good as they are for you!

Anything that gets my daughter to eat hidden veggies and love it (even though she can see little green flecks from the zucchini peel!)deserves 4 forks. I am really pleased with the quantity of veg in this recipe - there is more veg than flour! I'm not concerned with the fat in the recipe, although I did reduce to 1/2 C based on the reviews - but what bothered me is the amount of sugar, more than called for in my choco-chip cookie recipe!! I did reduce to 1 1/2 C total (1 C white and 1/2 C brown). I didn't want to reduce anymore than that and risk my kids not eating it at all. Also I used 1/2 C whole wheat flour and I left out the nuts. Anyway my daughter ate it warm with a fork and said it tastes just like cake. It was very moist from the oil. I would be interested in trying again with 1/4 C oil and 1/4 C yogurt like some of the reviews said. It smelled amazing in the oven, but honestly the taste didn't blow me away or anything. Would make again for the sole purpose of getting more veg into the kids.

Creative and pleasing spin off of zucchini bread--the yam balances the bitterness of the zucchini and rounds out its flavor. Way too much oil and sugar for my taste, though--I used yogurt for part of the oil and will cut the sugar by 25-50% if I make it again.

Rating: 4
What a great way to eat your vegs! My addition was to add a small can of drained crushed pineapple - really helped balance the sweetness. I would also highly recommend adding the (macerated) dried cranberries. I made one recipe with/without the cranberries -- much better with -- really added a needed punch. I followed others' recommendations: 2 C King Arthur whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup each white sugar and light brown sugar, 3 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp ginger (1 tsp wasn't enough), nutmeg, cardamom, 1/4 C oil, 1/2 C apple butter (more flavor than the applesauce) and smaller loaf pans (I didn't get much "rise/height" as other commenters noted). Enjoy! Morna

Great muffins, modified slightly to include the following: cut down on oil - used 1/2 C oil, 1/4 C yogurt (will cut down on oil even more next time); only 1 tsp cinnamon and added a pinch of nutmeg; reduced sugar by 1/2 C to use only 1 1/2 cups total. My kids love them!

This is a great recipe. Used it before, or one similar. Today I made a weird mistake, but it came out okay. Instead of sweet potato, I used, are you ready?? Butternut squash soup from Trader Joe's, one cup. That was the mistake. Don't know why... but tasting the batter, I realized that I had done something, and tasted the slightly oniony undertaste. I adjusted the recipe, changing to 2.5 c. brown sugar, 4 c. zucchini (I was making a double recipe), 1 c. oil, and 4 tsp. Chinese 5 Spice from Penzey's. Turned out pretty good . . . let's see what company thinks!

I made muffins from this recipe that got raves! The flavors floored me, they were sooooo good! I used a lot of the tips from other reviewers to cut down on sugar & fat. What I did: used white whole- wheat flour. Added 1/2 teaspoon ginger, some fresh nutmeg scrapings. Sugar: used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar. The muffins were pretty sweet, so next time I'll plan to use 1 cup sugar total. I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil and they were very moist. Next time I'll go down to 1/4 cup of oil and use some applesauce as others suggest. Definitely use more zucchini: next time I'll do 2 cups. I used 1 cup of drained canned sweet potatoes, and I baked the muffins for 40 minutes.

Fantastic recipe! Make sure to use a true sweet potato, and not a yam; yams are starchier & dry, thus will affect the quality of the bread. If you are unsure of what's available at your supermarket, get canned sweet potatoes (the skin on a true yam is rough and scaly and the shape is tubular).

Haven't made this for a few years now and it is better than I had remembered. The kids (and dog) couldn't eat it fast enough with my 5 year-old asking if I would make it again at Christmas. Needless to say, it's a huge hit at our house.

I decreased the sugar to 1.75 cups because I used yams instead of sweet potatoes (my local grocer said yams have more sugar than sweet potatoes) and substituted the walnuts for pecans. But even with the changes, I felt like the bread tasted a little flat. It was decent though so next time I'll follow some of the other reviewers' suggestions and add a few more spices.

This is a wonderful recipe. I've been making this for over a year now and just use zucchini when in season. I also substitute white flour for whole wheat and part honey or agave nectar for the sugar and decrease the oil, and add extra spices such as ginger, nutmeg and cloves. The result is a moist, delicious bread.

Used the recommended ratio of half whole wheat and half white. Used 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. Using canned sweet potato puree, just 1 cup. Used mini loaf pans and muffin tin and baked for 20-25 minutes. Help, I can't stop eating!!!!

This bread is absolutly fabulous!

Only baked for one hour and is yummy.

On the advice of my sister, I made them into muffins. I also used 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar, 1/4 cup oil and instead of apple sauce I used 1/2 cup pumpkin butter from Trader Joe's.

WOW! This is the best bread ever! I did as most and doubled the cinnamon, replaced 1/2 cup of oil with applesauce and didn't miss it at all!

I definitely will make this again and soon!!

This is a great recipe. I made muffins rather than bread. I also used 1c white and 1c whole wheat. I cut the sugar to 3/4 c and added 3/4 c of raisins instead of walnuts. And since I already had a roasted sweet potato in the fridge I used that instead of the grated sweet potato. The muffins came out moist and yummy without being too dense.

Loved it. Notes: - I cut the sugar down from 2 cups to 1.5 cups, and it was still plenty sweet. -Also, I made two batches, and put one of the batches into muffin tins. Those took only twenty minutes and came out really well. Next time I'll probably just do it as muffins to cut down on baking time. -I think raisins would be a great addition, next time.

This makes a great, moist, mellow bread. As suggested by another reviewer, I used half white and half brown sugar, but cut the total amount by about 1/2 cup. I also used a smidge less oil too, and I don't feel I lost any texture because I baked it about seven minutes short. My finicky nephew couldn't get enough of this!

I was apprehensive at first on how the flavors would meld together, but so glad I made it. I made a few changes, used wheat bread instead of white, omited theh walnuts and used apple sauce instead of the oil. Since I made these changes and used small bread pans (great for giving as gifts) I only cooked for 60 min. The first batch was so good I made another. These are so moist and flavorful that I can't think of another bread to make.

I baked it for almost 2 hours and the inside is still very pasty and really not cooked. The flavor of the outside is delicious - what did I do wrong?

Made a triple batch and everyone wanted the recipe. Tasty and healthy. Why would anyone bother peeling the sweet potato? Shredded 1 large potato and 2 med zucchini for my batch. Added lots more cinnamon and assorted other spices. Followed the suggestion to decrease to 2/3c oil; could probably decrease further if desired. The 2c sugar made a fairly sweet bread, with great texture, that I liked, but if you don't have a sweet tooth I'm sure that could successfully be reduced as well

Now that I am tasting it, I love the toasted pecans and LLLLLOOOOOVE the double cinnamon. I think it would benefit from some lemon juice, a la banana bread. This bread is MOIST, almost to the point of a steamed pudding! I thought it was undercooked, until it reached a cooler temperature. The cake tester did come out clean, after all. But there are still a few white globs of flour in the finished product. VERY yummy

I made 30 mini-muffins and three 3x5 mini loaves. I doubled the cinnamon, added some freshly grated ginger (1/4 tsp) used half applesauce, half oil, toasted pecans, reduced sugar by one half cup, used dark brown and white sugars (+ a squirt of honey) and bumped up to 2 cups zucchini and 2 cups swt potato. Batter was very runny at first and I was concerned when white dry globs of flour were popping to the top as I was filling the baking containers. Bubbles are good in pancake batter, but zucchini bread? It came out beautifully and pretty yummy. Nice flavor, but lacks complexity. I think it's a mistake to add the dry and wet and only "stir" I think that needs a mixing, however brief. It's hard to have a consistent texture in a batter this runny by only stirring, imo.

This was so awsome!! My family ate it all and now I'm going to have orders for way more loaves to be baked. I took some advise from some of the other reviewers and I reduced the amount of oil to 2/3 and added 1 tsp cardomom and 1/4 tsp ground ginger. I also wound up cooking it for 1 hour and 30 minutes, but I guess that depends on the oven or elevation. I plan to triple wrap these in plastic wrap, put them in freezer bags and then give them out as Christmas gifts. Happy Baking!

This recipe is wonderful. I add fresh ground nutmeg, sliced dates, brown sugar (instead of white or do 1/2 & 1/2), tried almost every kind of peoples' favorite nuts (macadamia, pecans, etc - not usually toasted) and every once in a while I also add chocolate chips. Although the chocolate version is too sweet for my boyfriend, it's the way my coworkers love. I found adding applesauce actually dried this recipe out and was the least favorite of all the batches I have made. Everyone who tries this recipe loves it. I would give it a higher rating if I could. I also bake it in a large low glass pan, 8x8x3 I think. For 1 hr 30 - 40 minutes. I don't have a bread pan. I then slice it into two loaves after it is cool and wrap in foil. It is fine on the counter for a week, but honestly usually doesn't make it past 3 days. I found this recipe when looking for a way to go through ALL the zucchini from our garden, it did the trick great! And I can promise it is just as delicious with either zucchini or sweet potato as it is with both.

Rating: 3
A very nice, almost tea-bread texture. I substituted canned sweets, drained and mashed for the fresh potatoes, mixing them in with the liquid, and used one cup of sugar. Also, since I ran out of all-purpose flour I used King Arthur White Whole Wheat; the results were still delicate. Delicious.

You've heard the term baking is a science, and cooking is an art? I am an artist, not a scientist, so when I bake I can't deviate from the recipe because It's just guesswork and usually flops. Well this bread/cake in my circumstances was an exception to the rule. I decided to make this bread with my two and a half year old son and his two year old friend this afternoon. I shredded the zucchini in advance and had the sweet potato peeled and ready to feed through the food processor. I set the kids up with their big bowels for the dry ingredients, and started measuring it out and letting them dump it in, but when I got to the baking soda realized after searching the cupboard that I had none. If it weren't for the two toddlers busily stirring away at their respective bowls, I would have rushed down the street to buy some, but this was not an option. I made a somewhat educated guess based on a recipe on the back of the baking powder can. I used two and a half teaspoons baking powder and no soda. Also decide to bake them in 9 X 13 greased and floured cake pans (one recipe in each pan) to avoid any doughy middle and burnt outside problems that could have occurred since I changed the scientific workings of the recipe. Guess what? we ended up with a delicious cake, very similar to carrot cake! I'm so glad it worked since the kids worked so hard and had such a good time. I would actually recommend it with this substitution. I will make it again this way too.

I ran out of sweet potatoes yesterday, so it was all zucchini (I finely grated about a cup to a stringy texture with a cheese grater and finely chopped the other 2 cups in a food processor). After reading the reviews, I did reduce the oil to 1/4 cup and put in 1/2 cup apple *butter* (mccutcheon's brand is great for recipes like this). Since I prefer my nuts to be fairly softened in baking, I didn't toast the walnuts. Added a couple handfuls of golden raisins, too. Since the apple butter is pretty sweet, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/3 cups. I also added a little mace and nutmeg and made sure to use my absolute best, strongest cinnamon since some mentioned it being too weak. It is absolutely perfect to me. I will agree with the "what a mess" comment in the sense that there is NO WAY this would have fit in a loaf pan, since it rises about 75%! I ended up using a nonstick springform with an angel food insert, and it only took 50 minutes and was perfect in height and width for 1 inch slices. (I had to hurry up and put foil around the 3/4 of it that are going to my family tomorrow, or else it would be, 1 inch at a time, GONE by now!) Really delicious with the applesauce/apple butter modification. I think it definitely would be too greasy with more than 1/4 cup oil.

Rating: 3
I doubled the recipe,and made a lot of changes based on others' comments, and what I had on hand. Used/added: 1T freshly grated ginger, 3 tsp cinammon, 3/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg, 2 cps toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts, 3/4 cp canola oil, 3/4 cp organic apple butter, 1/2 the sugar the recipe calls for, yam rather than sweet potato. It was not terribly sweet (which I loved), with a strong flavor of pine nuts. If I make it again for others, I'd make it tad sweeter, and cut back on the pine nuts.

This is a fabulous recipe! This is the 2nd summer I've used this for the over abundance of zucchini from our garden. I always make a double batch, one loaf gets frozen, one gets eaten (quickly!) I cut the sugar and oil in half, and add applesauce. Sweet potatoes are not as easy to find here, and they are not always very fresh so I've started using carrot. I change the ratio, using 2/3 zucchini to 1/3 carrot, just because we have so much zucchini. I also add more vanilla and I never toast the walnuts. I plan to try adding dried cranberries soon to a batch, that sounds good!

I also followed the other reviewers' recommendations about applesauce and the type and amount of sugars. The result was good but not great, but only because the sweet potato gave the bread an odd coarse dry texture. I would try substituting pumpkin or carrot next time. I would also use 1 1/4 cup sugar, instead of just 1 cup -- it could be a bit sweeter.

Out of this world. Followed everyone's suggestions and replaced 1/2 the oil with apple sauce, used half the sugar, added 1/4 tsp ginger and nutmeg. Didn't have enough walnuts, so used 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup pecans. Did not toast the nuts Absolutely perfect!

I thought this came out rather bland. I followed the recipe as it was written except for cutting back on the sugar a bit based on the other reviews. 2 cups of sugar seemed like a lot of sugar compared to other zucchini bread recipes.

I've braved baking in the heat to make this recipe! Everyone who has tried it loved it. This is fantastic with blue cheese. My subs (made using what I have on hand): carrots for sweet potatoes, pecans for walnuts, butter for oil. I add a bit less sugar, as well. The recipe makes a good deal more than one loaf, so I add baking cocoa to the remainder and make chocolate muffins/cupcakes.

I made mini loaves (doubled recipe) and gave 2 to my parents for their camping trip one to my boyfriend and one for myself... i should have kept an extra one for me!

This is an excellent bread recipe. My toddler would eat a whole loaf himself if I let him. You can reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and the bread is still delicious. It is a hit with both adults and children!

TERRIFIC!! I followed the directions except I took the advice of a former reviewer and substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the oil and brown sugar for 1/2 of the sugar. Before adding the walnuts I made some mini muffins for my 4 year old and 2 year old. They devoured them. What a great way to get them to eat vegetables. Next time I will have to try 1/2 wheat flour and less sugar as others have recommended. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

All I can say is WOW!! This recipe blew me away... I could not stop eating it!! I replaced half of the white flour with whole wheat, and replaced half of the oil with applesauce, and it was absolutely DIVINE! I believe the substitutions made the bread quite healthy. TRY IT NOW!

A wonderful variation on an old favorite! The sweet potato and wonderful flavor to the zucchini. The bread was actually better the 2nd or 3rd day. I recommend using a little less sugar as it was initially a little sweet for my family's taste.

This recipe tasted wonderful. But for some reason the bread came out too moist (not soggy). I'm not sure what happen. I'm considering letting the zucchini drain a bit before hand and adding a 1/2 cup more of flour. My family ate it up.

This recipe turned out great! My trick to ensuring the bread does not stick is allowing it to stay in the oven for an additional 30-45 minutes after it is done cooking (oven off).

After reading all the reviews, I made a few changes and it turned out great! I used half all-purpose flour/half whole wheat flour, used 1 cup turbinado sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar, substituted 5-spice powder for the cinnamon and wrung out the zucchini in a dish towel. It make two 8 x 4 x 2.5 loaves and only took about an hour in the oven. Next time I think I'll up the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.

Very good! Followed recipe exactly and bread came out perfectly. Excellent way to use up all the zucchini this time of year.

I tried this recipe with the suggestion by a previous reviewer to use half wheat flour. In addition, I was able to make two 8 x 4 x 2.5 inch loaves with this recipe. More to share! It truly was fantastic according to my friends, so much so that they want the recipe.

This is a great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and this came out perfect. Next time, for the sake of experimentation, I might add a couple tsps of lemon zest and use pecans instead of walnuts, but this is really good just the way it is.

I made this today with the following modifications: used half the sugar called for, used half whole wheat flour and added 1 tsp ground ginger. Smelled lovely in the oven tasted pretty good too. Had to cook an hour and a half to set and was still too moist. I think next time I'll squeeze out the zucchini well, cut back the oil to half a cup (it's moist enough already), use brown sugar and add more spices (I could barely taste the cinnamon and ginger). Overall a very good base recipe to work off of.

Not sure what happened to the disaster lady - the proportions are just fine. I encourage everyone to ignore all the posters below and try the recipe as written the first time! I couldn't resist listening to some of the comments and cut the sugar in half - but I wish I hadn't, as I think the bread would have benefited from being a little sweeter. Next time I might try 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. But it definitely needs all the fat. This makes for a great, dense, moist, rich bread. And to all those who substituted carrots for sweet potatoes -- WHY? Why not try sweet potatoes? If you want to make zucchini-carrot bread, I'm sure there are other recipes on the site. Live a little! Expand your horizons! The sweet potatoes and zucchini are a great combination!

This recipe was a disaster. It makes far more than one loaf. I had a substantial amount of batter left over, and despite filling the appropriate sized loaf pan, it ran over and made a mess of my oven. The final product was not worth the effort or the clean-up.

Rating: 3
I heeded the instructions of cooks before me and reduced the amount of oil and egg...I wasn't happy. The flavor was delicious, but the texture needs all of the fat that the original recipe requires. Perhaps I could have gotten away with it if I had only cooked it for an hour (I'm not quite sure it needs to be cooked for more than that), but it turned out a little dry. I would suggest using applesauce for those who are concerned about the fat content, and maybe reducing the sugar.

I made this for my toddler twins in an effort to get them to eat more vegetables. They loved it. I followed the recipe to the letter and was satisfied with the outcome. Today, I made it again using less sugar, applesauce instead of oil, egg substitute and cranberries. I also baked it at a lower temperature and for less time. It turned out beautifully. Now, to find a way to get my picky husband to eat more vegetables!

I followed the suggestions re: less sugar (also used dark brown sugar), 2 eggs, whole wheat flour, added nutmeg, used carrots instead of sweet potatoes, and instead of oil I used apricot sauce. Oh, and I added flax seeds. It was excellent.

Planning to make more this afternoon--I used 1/2 and 1/2 wheat and white flour, 1/2 c. applesauce instead of oil, carrots instead of sweet potatoes, and maybe only added 1 cup of sugar (at most) and 1 egg. And made them as muffins. I thought it was good, but everyone I gave them to exclaimed how excellent this recipe was. It is a great way to sneak zucchini into the diet of small children. This time I am putting ground up flax seed it in. Highly reccommend this one.

Wooooowww!! While this was cooking, the whole family was going crazy from the awesome smell that permeated the house! I also reduced the sugar and oil, used 2 cups of each; sweet potato and zucchini. I almost burned my toungue, I was in such a hurry to try it. I've never tried zucchini bread of any type before and I can't wait to start tweaking this recipe! Recommend this to all!

With the addjustments suggested i give this a 3. I adjusted the amounts of ingrediants used to make 5 mini loafs. 3c white flour 1c wheat, 4tsp cinnimon (and if i had nutmeg i would have added some of that too!) 2tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt a little less than 3c. sugar, 1c. Vegitable oil, 5 eggs, 2tsp Vanilla, 3 1/2 c zucchini, 2 1/2 c carrots, and about a cup of Craisins. And i put some sugar crystals on top. My mom and dad love it, along with the other people i gave the bread to as gifts!

Rating: 4
This is very tasty! I tried it the first time with the sweet potatoes. The second time I substituted the sweet potatoes with carrots and liked that version even better. Like other cooks I reduced the sugar to 1.5 Cups and reduced the oil to one half Cup. I also added 3/4 Cup raisins and 3/4 cups of the toasted walnuts to the carrot version. I used whole wheat flour for one of the cups of flour. Will make this one again and again.

I already have a good zucchini loaf recipe, but I thought the addition of sweet potato looked interesting. Thanks to all the other cooks for the suggestions. I added less sugar and oil, and I also added only one egg and about 1/8 cup of milk. I also added some nutmeg and allspice. The loaf cooked in an hour and was well-shaped with a lovely golden brown colour. Moist and full of flavour.

Rating: 3
Very moist and delicate flavor. I doubled the recipe and used half the sugar and oil as overwhelmingly suggested. I had a leftover baked sweet potato so I mashed it up and used it in place of the grated sweet potato. This was a real hit with the kids. The doubled recipe yielded 12 large muffins and 3 min-loaf pans. Next time I might add a bit more cinnamon, but they're delicious just as they are!

Rating: 3
Really enjoyed the recipe and my fiance absolutely loved it! I did make several changes. I substituted carrots for sweet potato, reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups (and might reduce it further next time) and subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil (and the result was still incredibly moist). I added 3/4 cup pecans and 3/4 cup cranberries and thought they were a good addition. Next time I'd probably add 1.5 cups pecans and 1.5 cups cranberries.

Rating: 4
This recipe is really delicious and I like that it is so healthy for you (I used canola oil). Like others who posted here, I reduced the sugar and have even used a sugar substitute (Splenda) and it came out great. I also substituted whole wheat flour for one of the two cups required. Note that you really have to measure out the zucchini and the sweet potato-- I overdid it one time and the loaf took forever to bake and seemed uncooked even afterwards.

Rating: 4
I am a novice baker and it came out delicious on the first try. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the oil to 1/2 cup and used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar. The top of it burned slightly before the inside was done, but a veteran baker told me not to be concerned and to next time cover it lightly with aluminum foil while in the oven after the top has turned the color you want it to be.

To the cook from Seven Hills, MA - 8/23/03 You say high crowned loaves resulted? How much "pinch" in your "pinch"? I made it - with alterations - and it is delicious; I can't wait to try more of the suggested options. I think this may be the zucc. bread recipe I've been yearnin for if I can get it so that it doesn't yield my typical flat zucc. bread loaf. Is this just a personal problem or is there a chefs' secret?

I had the same problem as a previous reviewer -- monster zucchini that I needed to use. This turned out to be a good recipe, and after 2 batches I pretty much went through a couple of monster zucchini. I used all zucchini but didn't cut down the oil enough, it was a bit heavy and oily for me. Next time less than 1/2c. oil. I also tried the craisin and walnut mix, which was good. I also liked lots of walnuts alone in the batter (toast before adding). A good way to use up that prolific zucchini in the garden.

Rating: 1
What a mess! I wanted to make zucchini bread and I had some left over yams (not sweet potatos, I know, but so very similar, and everyone else had been making so many substitutions, I thought it'd be fine). I also cut the oil to 1/2 cup and sugar to 1 1/2 cups as others recommended. I was worried as soon as I poured the batter into the pan - it almost over filled... maybe if I'd just used 2 loaf pans instead, it could have turned out fine. But as it was, I had to bake it for almost 2 hours! I was too late at night and I needed to go to bed, and I could also tell that the outside, even though I covered it with foil after 1 1/2 hours was getting very very tough and dark. So I just took it out. In the morning, I cut into it to see, and it was still batter-like in the center. Maybe I can toast slices and salvage something, but overall this was a complete disappointment.

This is a great recipe for kids. It uses a lot of vegetables and tastes great! I used half the oil and sugar as was suggested by other reviewers and it turned out perfect! I made it twice in the first week.

This year's garden produced a bonanza of mutant zucchinis -- some as big as a monstrous foot-and-a-half-long eggplant! So I was eager to try this recipe, and I heeded the advice of the previous cooks. I cut the oil to a half cup (and all I had in the house was olive oil), cut the sugar by a half cup, upped the baking soda and baking powder by a pinch, and omitted the sweet potato, substituting all grated zucchini to use up those big green boys from the garden. I also had pure granulated maple sugar in the cupboard, so I threw in a teaspoon of that as well. Instead of one big loaf, I made two smaller loaves, and in half the batter I added chopped hazlenuts and dried Craisins, and left the other half plain. Both loaves came out amazingly beautiful, high-crowned and crusty golden brown, and my taste test slice of the fruit and nut mixture was out of this world. Now I'm anxious to try other variations, and get some sweet potato for the next batch. Thanks, fellow cooks, for all the great suggestions. I'm going to serve these beauts at a family party tomorrow, and I'm sure they'll be a big hit.

Rating: 4
Wow! I followed the advice of many here and only used 1/4 cup oil, and added some sliced apples we had left over from apple pie baking the day before. This is a much healthier recipe than our previous favorite. Next I'll experiment with adding bananas and using carrots instead of sweet potato.

this is a wonderful bread! used half as much cinnamon, a mixture of yellow summer squash and carrot, 1.5 cups sugar, a little less oil, some apple sauce, and dried cherry-flavored cranberries - no nuts. pefectly crusty on the outside, moist and yummerful on the inside. will make it again very soon.

I have made this recipe at least 10 times so far and have been playing around with the ingredients. I made it again today and I have to say it was absolutely perfect: I cut the sugar and the oil in half, added a bit more baking powder (I noticed it needs a bit more when baking in a gas stove), and baked it in a ring pan. Cooked for 50 minutes and came out so good I can't stop eating it! Great food for toddlers.

Rating: 3
This smelled great and tasted good too. The only thing was that it got burned on the outside and wasn't cooked on the inside, although I turned it down to 325. Next time I would cook it even a bit lower for longer. I substituted applesauce for all the oil, spelt flour for the flour, and 9 egg whites instead of 6 whole eggs. I also cut down the sugar, but I substituted some honey in which I think made the bread a bit too moist, next time I'll stick to just sugar, but a lower amount than the recipe calls for.

Rating: 3
What a great bread. I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce (i've used both unsweetened and an organic tropical mango applesauce, too) and 1/4 cup olive oil for the 3/4 cup oil. I also cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, and used 1 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup granulated. The first time I made this I added chocolate chips and it was good, if on the sweet side. I just made it without nuts or chips and I think it's perfect. My toddler and my husband both love this.

Very tasty, moist bread. I made mini-muffins, and a whole party of people snacked on them all weekend. A big hit! I took other reviewers advice and substituted out some of the oil, but I used baby food pears instead of applesauce. Worked great. Bought and grated too much yam and zucchini, but kept them in the freezer and added them to meatloaf, casseroles, etc. (Good way to sneak in veggies!)

This bread is soooooo awesome!!! I've been making it for 2 weeks and can't wait to make more trying out other versions and suggestions from other cooks.

Tomorrow at work, we are having a silent bake auction and I'm sure it will be a hit to whomever wins it.

I've made this for my 15 month-old daughter. Substituted the sweet potatoes with yams (because the grocery store didn't have any), drained the zucchini & yams very well, substituted all the oil with unsweetened apple sauce, omitted the nuts, lined the pan with parchment or foil instead greasing pan, and reduced temperature to 325 degrees to allow the insides to cook longer and prevent bread from browning too quickly. It's a very moist, rich cake-like bread. We love it.

Yes, this was moist and dense, but the flavor was rather boring. I used more cinnamon than stated in the recipe and found that it could have used more. I added dried cherries and that added a little excitement to the flavor. It's not a bad recipe (I'd actually rate it 2.5 forks), but I've made zucchini breads that were better.

I'll try this one more time, but... I made it yesterday, along with my usual zucchini bread (with pineapple and dates), and don't think this one is great. Now, I did double the recipe (I don't like the one loaf thing), but found that the double recipe made not only two overflowing loaves, but also filled four small pans that I gave to my kids! I'll give it one more try, as written, but unless I see a great improvement, it'll not be repeated. The flavor just doesn't pop out in any way.

Late August is always surplus zucchini time so I thought I would put mine to good use. I have made this recipe before but this time I made muffins and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I also used half whole wheat flour and half white flour and added a bit of nutmeg. For some of the muffins, I threw in a handful of chopped peaches. They only needed to bake about 20 to 25 min. in a 350 oven. These turned out soooooooooo good. I ate about 3 before I went to bed (warm out of the oven with a huge glass of cold milk - does it get any better??) and then 2 for breakfast (good cold OR warm!) and I just ate one as a snack (okay - now I just have a problem). They are really moist and so delicious!!! I can't wait to eat more tonight.

Yummy! I took lots of advice from others here and used 1 1/4 cups sugar, and 1/4 cup oil with 1/2 cup applesauce. Also did half dried cranberries and half golden raisin instead of nuts, which I don't like in baked goods. It's delicious and feels kind of healthy at the same time. Nothing beats that first slice while it's still warm. I've made it twice in the past week, so I guess that's a good recommendation!

My husband thinks that butter makes everything better, so when he doesn't spread extra on something that I've baked, its the ultimate compliment. I made this recipe as muffins rather than a loaf, and sprinkled turbinado sugar on top of each for a nice finish. He will eat 4 in one sitting, WITHOUT(!) butter. I'll be grating and freezing measured amounts of zucchini while its in season, so I can continue to make this for my husband throughout the winter.

Agree with everyone, this bread was simply deelish. I also used yams instead of sweet potatoes because they're much easier to find. Very dense, rich and moist. I used half walnuts and half pecans and I think it would be even nicer with a handful of golden raisins, or even a half cup of chopped fresh pear. Also, FYI, I use the 9x3 inch disposable paper baking pans for gift-giving, and the recipe as-is will make 3 loaves of the bread. I doubled the recipe so I could have extra and ended up with six loaves total. And if you use these smaller paper pans, reduce the baking time to about 50 minutes.

Fabulous! A+ ! I did, however, follow the suggestions of so many reviewers and split half oil and half applesauce, plus added dried cranberries.

I substituted dried cranberries for the walnuts and the reviews have been great. The sweet potato makes the bread more moist and dense -just the way I love it.

I will definitely add this recipe to my autumn bread rotation.

I doubled this terrific recipe with no problem. I added 1-1/2 cups fresh cranberries, left whole. The tartness of the cranberries added a nice marriage to the flavors of the zucchini and sweetpotato.
