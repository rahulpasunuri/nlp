If there is an international section where you shop, use Marie Biscuits which are less sweet than graham crackers or vanilla wafers. A sweet filling is overkill.

Everything about the crust was great- ease of preparation, patting it into pan, etc, except that it was way too sweet for our taste! Next time I will cut back on the sugar (if not eliminate it totally.)I did use honey grahams which my daughter thought might have made it too sweet, but I don't think of honey grahams as sweet.

I think this is a good recipe, but I do find that it tends to need more butter than called for--I added in two more tablespoons and it still was a bit dry and crumbly. I also thought there was too much sugar for my taste and omitted some. Having made this crust in the traditional way and with a food processor, I highly recommend using a food processor! If you've not tried it yet you'll be amazed at how fine your crumbs will be ground and how quickly you can mix this all together.

I used graham crackers to make this for the Three Cities of Spain Cheesecake. I processed all the ingredients so I had very fine crumbs. The crust came out fine and held together really well.

I've made this crust several times and it always turns out perfect! My favorite variation is to use cinnamon crisp graham crackers instead of the regular ones. I don't think I'll ever bother looking for another crumb crust recipe.

I used ginger snaps for this crust and it was really yummy but a little heavy on the sugar. Next time I think I'll use a little less sugar, but otherwise great!

This recipe was easy and very very tasty. The sugar is the key to this recipe's success. Everyone that I served this to, commented on how much they loved the flavor.

If you want an INCREDIBLE crust recipe...look at Epicurious' Girlscout Lemon Cheesecake with Shortbread Cookie crust...now THAT'S a crust. Use it with any cheesecake.

Just to let everyone know that the salt amount has been recently corrected and now reads 1/8 tsp. This is the right amount.

I have not made the crust. This site says nothing about baking it, yet some of your reviews suggest cutting the temp or the bake time. I am confused.

Good recipe, but I agree that the amount of salt is a bit much. Next time I'll use half as much. Cookie crust worked well with Chocolate Caramel Cheesecase.

This recipe is a winner every time! I've made it 4 times now, and my guests expect me to make it at every event.

A nice crust! I used vanilla wafer cookies (for a banana cream pie crust) and used about 1/2 the amount of salt called for. My husband like the salty taste, but I will decrease it in the future.

This was the 2nd cheesecake recipe that I have tried to make and it is DELICIOUS. It is easy to make and even I, a novice baker, can make it turn out good. Everyone must try this.

Great crust recipe! I use it for all cheescake recipes.It did, however, burn at 550 degrees for 12 minutes, so I adjusted the temp to 500 and the cook time to 10 minutes. Also, the amount of salt definitely needs to be reduced to 1/8t. Works out great every time!

Great crust and SO easy to make! You just can't go wrong with this one. I used the amount of salt stated.

I made this recipe using my Gourmet magazine and have found an error in the epicurious print. In the actual magazine it calls for 1/8 teaspoon salt not the 3/4 tsp that is printed on this site. So for all those that said the crust was too salty you are right if you used the 3/4 tsp salt. I too agree the filling needs much more than an hour. I cooked mine at 550 and did not have trouble with it browning too much but will try it again at 500 and cook it for 2 hours at 200. A wonderful cheesecake for even those that are not aficionados of cheesecake.

For a lower fat version i used 1/5 of the butter and added some cinnamon for extra flavor...it was delicious

Excellent recipe, I found that by lowering the temp from 550 to 500 for first 10 mins. I was able to keep the top from turning to brown, although it did require more cooking time at 200 degrees it did not spoil the recipe. Loved it!
