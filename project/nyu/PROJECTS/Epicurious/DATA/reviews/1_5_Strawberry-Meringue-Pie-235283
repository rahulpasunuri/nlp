This turned out to be a mess... not only was it unattractive but it was nothing to rave about in taste either... the gelatin made it taste like glue had somehow snuck into the pie

Boy, is this a sloppy recipe! First, it says to use pasteurized egg whites for the meringue. Pasteurized egg whites will not whip, no matter how much cream of tartar you add. (In any case, it's unnecessary, since the meringue is baked for 12 minutes.) Then it says to combine berries, sugar, and salt in a pan and bring to a boil -- with no liquid! It's true, the berries would eventually release juice, but It's hard to believe that it would be adequate, and that the berries wouldn't stick to the pan first. I decided to try the recipe anyway, since it seemed like a good concept. I used 4 egg whites and added 2/3 cup water to the berries (based on another gelatin-based pie recipe). I also reduced the sugar in the filling to 1/2 cup (it was still a bit on the sweet side) and increased the sugar in the meringue to 1/4 cup (about right). The result was tasty, but funny looking: The filling soaked through the crust so that there was one brownish, gelatenous, strawberry flavored graham cracker layer and one layer of meringue. I will probably try it again with less water (maybe 1/4 cup), and I may brush the crust with egg white before baking it to keep the filling from soaking through.
