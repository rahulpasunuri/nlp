I am not a fan of bell peppers but after THIS dish.......I'm still not a fan of bell peppers :( Very weird combination of flavors for me.

What a simple to prepare, colorful and tasty side dish this is. I followed the recipe as written and served it as a side with Tandoori Grilled Chicken and Jeweled Rice. Even though it's not a typical side for an Indian meal, it worked very well. I love bell peppers, and even though I was a little skeptical about this unusual combination of ingreidents, the outcome was delicious. My husband also loved it, and he's not a great fan of bell pepper dishes.

My son and I are big fans of salads and we are always looking for new ideas. This recipe seemed very simple but we decided to give it a try and the result was exellent! I added some toasted almonds and mixed the arrugula with romaine. Thumbs up!

Au contraire! I think this dish cold would make a great vegetarian sandwich filling.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was VERY GOOD, even though I used regular raisins and spinach. However, it needs to accompany a non sweet entree, and NOT "Butternut Squash and Mushroom Lasagna".

I was skeptical about this one. Everyone loved it. I don't recommend it for leftovers though.
