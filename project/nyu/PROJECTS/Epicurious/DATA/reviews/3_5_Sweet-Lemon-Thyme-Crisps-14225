I made these, stepping aside from the recipe a little bit, using basil instead of thyme, upping the zest to finely grated 3 Tbs and using 1 tsp powdered ginger. I thought it was a good cookie, but the ginger was hidden, I should have used more basil, and the lemon zest could also have been increased-I like the zing. The flavor didn't really become more pronounced after a few days, and I think maybe with these adjustments, the cookie might have a more flavorful taste on the first day.

I made these as instructed, using lemon thyme from my garden. This was a good butter cookie. The flavors of the lemon thyme, lemon juice and lemon zest were not pronounced enough. If I were to make these again, I would increase the amounts of these, as others have done.

I made this crisps for a birthday party at work. They were a big hit. Light and refreshing and yet it satisfies the sweet tooth. Will definitely make again.

I made these as the recipe instructed. They were delicious! Follow the cutting instructions; the resulting shape is lovely. These cookies travel very well.

I make these every year as part of my "cookie menagerie" and they are always a hit. Unexpected yet addictive flavor and a nice texture. Plus, the recipe makes a lot of them, so they go a long way. I often cook only one log's worth of dough and freeze the rest to pop into the oven later for unexpected guests or a simple nighttime treat.

Best results are from using fresh lemon thyme - not regular thyme. Lemon thyme is aromatic, delicious herb, and regular thyme is very mild. Lemon thyme is probably very difficult to find at a market -- I bought a plant from my local nursey and added it my garden. What a wonderful herb. Teeny little yellow and green leaves, that pack a delicious punch. Try them!

I love the sweetness and the true lemon and thyme flavor of these tender crisps. I followed bmichlig2's advice and increased the lemon juice to 5 tablespoons and increased the lemon rind to 3-1/2 teaspoons. I cut the baking soda to 1-1/2 teaspoons. I found the dough quite sticky to roll into logs and will chill the dough before rolling. I also recommend rolling narrow logs (3/4") and slicing 1/4 inch rounds to get a nice uniform shape. You may need to dip your knife into water to keep your slices clean and even. These cookies spread so do leave a full inch between rounds. I baked the cookies on parchment for 10 minutes until the first signs of gold were on the edges and they were easy to remove to the cooling rack.

i would add lots more thyme and more lemon. also i would bake them for less time! the confectioner's sugar was a good touch. i dig 'em. use good lemons.

These are exceptional. I've made them quite a few times and always recieve rave reviews. One suggestion to making these would be to add more lemon zest and thyme. They are also more intense a few days later. Let them sit and you won't be sorry! Delicious with a glass of bubbly!

Excellent. Can't stop eating them. Will make every time I have extra thyme. ;)

I didn't think there was anything special about these. They tasted like animal crackers. I made them to take to a picnic along with some salads and opted to leave them at home. There was not enough flavor for me, not worth buying thyme, actually I think I also tasted the baking soda.

Made this for a multi- cultural Labor Day BBQ and everyone loved them, even some of the picky toddlers. I made it to specifications but will probably reduce the sugar a bit for the next go round.

really 3 1/2 they were a big hit at an "herb themed" dinner part and the leftover log in the freezer made my inlaws very happy this weekend. I might have liked more ginger or more lemon which is why I reserve a half fork.

These cookies are very light and delicious! Make sure you add all the lemon and thyme that they suggest in the recipe...and maybe even a little more if you like a real lemony zing to your cookie. In addition to freezing the logs, I also put each tray of cookies in the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes prior to baking. Put these cookies in a clear bag with and tie with a beautiful ribbon and they make a great gift! This recipe will become a regular in my kitchen!

boring boring boring. pretty enough, makes a big batch but --big yawns. Barely nibbled at on a cookie tray thay was emptied of everything else. Major additions of lemon and thyme -something else? needed to give some flavour

I don't know what it is...several times now I have made a recipe that has drawn raves only to be really disappointed. These were pretty ho-hum...like sugar cookies with a tiny hint of more complex flavor...but pretty boring. Nowhere near enough lemon, too sweet, with a sugar cookie undertaste. A waste of time-or should I say "thyme" given I had to make a special trip to obtain fresh thyme in december. I hope the flavor improves over the next few days, though I made them a day ago and notice no improvement yet

Just finished making these, and they are insanely delicious. Omitted the powdered sugar; they are plenty sweet without it. Cooking time was more like 8 minutes than 12; the cookies taste okay a bit darker, but somehow seem more lemony and just look better when they are barely golden around the edges. Also, as per another reviewer's comments that they stuck to the cookies sheets, used Silpats (silicone baking mats placed in the cookies sheets) and there was no stick whatsoever. In fact, was able to lift the entire Silpat and just pour the cooled cookies off. They look cute stacked and rolled in parchment paper and tied at both ends to form cookie "bon bons".

This recipe won me first place in the cookie division of the 2006 Tamarack Time event in Bigfork. I was very surprised, because while I thought it was very good, it didn't wow me. I also figured that the lemon-thyme combo was sort of sophisticated and unusal. Turns out it pleased not only the judges but the public as well - after judging, the booths open to public tasting as a little fundraiser. Anyway, what I would do to improve this cookie to my own taste levels would be to cut back a bit on the baking soda, increas zest significantly. I also upped the lemon juice to aout 5 TBSP instead of 3, because my raw dough just wasn't particularky zingy. Also used a whole wheat flour - turned out great. Variations to consider for the future - adding lemon essential oil to the dough to increase the lemon factor; decrease sugar by 1/3 to 1/2 to create more of a cocktail cookie, which would be awesome served with various cheeses, fruits, white wines and sherries; combine orange zest and fresh tarragon; try lemon and lightly toasted fresh ground fennel or caraway seeds; dip in melted white chocolate or bittersweet chocolate; change lemon zest, thyme and lemon juice for lime zest, garden mint (not peppermint), lime juice and rum extract for a mojito crisp. Endless possibilities, really! All in all, a very successful recipe as written. And I am so NOT a baker!

Very addictive - light and very flavorful. Made recipe exactly, however, sliced the cookies thicker and it made for a soft cookie, instead of crisp. For reviewers that had problems with a) sticky dough - my guess is you skipped the freezing step (with that amount of butter you need to freeze to slice); or b) not good right out of the oven and needing to set a day - my guess is your "fresh" ingredients weren't "fresh". Excellent recipe! (and I bake ALOT)

ooops, I meant to also say that I would definitely make these again. Possibly even freeze a log or two in case of cookie emergencies.

these cookies are amazing! I made the whole recipe (two logs worth) for a bbq, and not one cookie was left over by the end of it. I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer to bake them a day or so before. They tasted just ok when they came out of the oven, but a day later the flavours seemed to have melded all that much more, creating one of the best cookies I've ever had. Light and tasty, perfect with a cup of tea!

This is my first review and coincidentally my first cookie I have ever baked! What an easy treat. My husband said "Thyme? Huh? Those aren't cookies...where's the chocolate chips?" One lemony crisp later and he was sold. A must try.

Believe the recipe when it tells you to transfer the cookies *immediately*. I waited 5 minutes and they stuck firmly to the baking tray. They taste delicious, but how depressing to go through that work and have half of them crumble away.

I made these on Sat. for a large party and they were so bland at the time that I left them in the car. BUT by the next day the flavor had gotten stronger, and by Monday they were delicious. Now 4 days later they're really good. Weird but true. I would recommend making these a day or two before serving. Don't cut down on any of the flavorings, I may add a touch more sugar next time, because the powdered sugar gets knocked off.

To the person who wanted to know when to dust with powdered sugar...wait till they have cooled...or the sugar will melt. These were wonderful!

Am looking forward to trying this recipe. Can anyone tell me if the powdered sugar is sprinkled BEFORE or AFTER the cookie has cooled?

It was a very simple recipe and if you slice the frozen logs thin (less than 1/8"), the cookies will be crisp. The thyme adds an understated yet sophisticated accent to these otherwise simple cookies. My mom who is a very discriminating sweets lover, adores these cookies.

After reading the recipe and all the reviews I was excited about making this cookie. I found that it was disappointing overall. The texture of the baked cookie was chewy, airy not crisp. The dough was difficult to work with. Very sticky. The thyme and ginger didn't come through in the flavor. It does have a lovely lemon aftertaste though.

Loved them! I find many cookies are just too sweet - these are lovely.

easy to make. delicious, not too sweet. was a little difficult working with the dough, easily crumbles and softens, easiest when still frozen. cut the logs into thicker slices and made them into cookies, which worked just fine. would definitely make them again!

I tried this recipe because I had so much fresh lemon thyme in my garden, never expecting that the cookies would be so tasty. It's a real bonus to be able to successfully freeze the dough. This recipe is definitely "a keeper."

This recipe is amazing. I have made it twice, once with fresh thyme and ginger, once with dried. Both were unbelievably good. I'm making them for Christmas this year.

Although this is a tasty recipe, I think it lacked flavor. Next time I will use 6 tsp. thyme. Also, I will add a dash of lemon extract (I used regular thyme and I thought it lacked the kick it needed from the lemon-thyme). I will also add a bit more sugar as the cookies tasted a tad more savory than sweet to me.

Excellent! Light, delicately flavored cookies. I think I didn't chop the lemon thyme well-enough, though, the flavor wasn't evenly distributed. Also, I was a little confused about the cutting directions--mine came out looking kind of like teardrops. Does that sound right?????

These cookies are absolutely fantastic -- easy to make and truly distinctive with the fresh ginger and thyme. Everyone I've made them for expresses amazement at the ingredients -- then asks for the recipe! You could make them with lemon verbena or lemon balm if you don't have thyme, though the thyme is lovely. Don't cut down the ginger -- it gives them a subtle and unique flair.
