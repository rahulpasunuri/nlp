Meh. Americanized borscht at best. Good taste, quick too. Not authentic, but good.

I don't know what's truly "traditional" in Russian or Ukranian cuisine--my family's comes from all over Western Europe and I'm more familiar with German and Italian food traditions. I have a long-lived fascination with Russian culture and have experimented with borsct for 20 years, though I would never use store-bought pickled beets in anything. I used to make it from fresh ingredients, but now I use beets that I pickle naturally (and quite traditionally) at home. Not only is this soup delicious, it is so easy. Beef broth, leftover pot roast, pickled beets and some boiled root vegetables...top with homemade yogurt and it's as good as or even better than any borscht I've made with fresh ingredients and vinegar.

You can make this but don't claim it's borsch. You're doing a disservice to everyone who is looking for the real recipe. One advice: to make borsch, EVERYTHING has to be fresh.

I'm not Ukrainian. I'm Albanian. Is that like the same thing?

Traditional? No. Delicious? Yes. Quick and easy? Definitely. Suspend your pre-conceived notions of what borscht should be; call it something else if you like. My family and I really liked this soup. And it's beautiful to look at.

Being Russian (Ukrainian) myself, I would like to support all comments that were made by fellow Russian cook. The recipe given is NOT A BORSCHT. This recipe is simply a nonsense. Besides, there is no such thing as Russian Borscht. It is an authentic Ukrainian dish. No wonder people would not like Russian cuisine. It's a shame you could not find a decent version of Borscht recipe. P.S. In Ukraine it is a requirement to sauté beets together with fresh tomatoes for a long time before putting the mixture into the stock, potatoes should be added before the tomato mixture, otherwise they will have tough texture.

Due to the mixed reviews, I had reservations about trying this recipe...but I went ahead and proceeded with caution. I was not disappointed. The recipe yielded a wonderfully rich and hearty borscht. Taking hints from a reviewer below, I also put my potatoes directly into the borscht and left the skins on. I simmered the borscht a much longer time than directed, not only to cook the potatoes, but to let all of the flavors blend. I used chicken stock in place of beef, and finely chopped my carrots, celery, and onions in a food processor. I was weary, too, about using the jarred beets. Fresh would no doubt have been better. Though this was a delicious and satisfying soup (almost a stew), it was not a winner in terms of traditional borscht. When I think of my grandmother's borscht I dream of that deep red broth with beets on the bottom of the bowl. If that's the kind of borscht you're after, try another recipe. All that said, the finished product, especially after a day, was absolutely delicious.

I am Russian , was born and raised in Moscow .I also am a pretty good cook as far as russian cusine is concerned. So you all can trust me on that - this is NOT borscht. First - there MUST be beef in it, second - potatoes should be boiled in the soup , not just water , third - there is NO celery in Russia , never was ,so you can't use it in russian cooking , forth - you HAVE to use cabbage and tomatoes in borscht ,fifth - can't use pickled beets , only fresh ones , sixth - must add lemon juice and sugar, seventh - bay leaf is a must as well and last - it takes at least 2 1/2, better yet 3 hours to make a good borscht. Good luck !

I always make a dish according to the recipe once, then add my own flair. This recipe, as is, is a loser in terms of Borscht. But I browned some stew meat (cutting off obvious fat), used homemade beef stock, left the skins on the spuds and microwaved then diced fresh beets, and it turned out wonderfully. A big hit.

Wow! Couldn't believe this soup turned out so spectacular based on the time and ingredients! It's more of a Russian borscht than Ukrainian, with the sweetness. My family loved it with sour cream, but it is also very refresing without. Do cut up the beets though, and use tiny potatoes (serve on in the bottom of each bowl) if you can find.

Those who rated this Borscht highly have certainly never been to the restaurant Russian Tea Time in Chicago. This was very bland and needed more vinegar (or maybe zippier pickled beets). It was however extremely easy to prepare.

Like the last reviewer, I also diced the potatoes & beets. I prefer a chunkier, heartier soup as well. Delicious and easy. Perfect with some whole grain or rye bread and butter for a lite meal. Was concerned about using the jarred beets, however, they worked wonderfully. Used the fresh dill & sour cream too.

My boyfriend, who's part russian, has been asking me to make borscht. It was one of his favorite dish growing up. It was my first time making it and it got rave rewiews from him. He even said it was better than his mom's!!! (All cooks know this is the best compliment you can get...). I used fresh beets instead of pickled ones and added some cider vinegar with a touch of sugar to make up for the brine. I also diced the potatoes and the beets as well and cooked all the vegetables together until tender. I also used my hand blender for a few second to add some texture to it (I like thick soups). It was delicious. But don't wear white when you eat this!

This borscht was fairly easy and doesn't require any fancy ingredients. The servings for four were hearty, and it tasted great! I added about a half tsp. dried dill with the beets, instead of adding fresh dill at the end, and it turned out just fine.

this is really good except i like to add a little red cabbage to the beets.
