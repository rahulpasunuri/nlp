Have been making this for for several years - especially since the roast chickens became available at the grocer! Substitute dried cherries for the apple. Add toasted pecans.

This was fantastic! As suggested by other reviewers, I used apple cider vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar, added 1 tsp of tarragon to the rice as it cooked and another to the salad as I tossed it. I used stevia instead of sugar (not that a "pinch" would add calories) but I felt it did need a bit a sweetness. It was a hit with the entire family! =)

Salad was much better after it sat in the fridge for a few hours. The tarragon vinegar is required!

this is really good but i skipped the chicken, used a nice tart granny smith apple, and added about half a cup of toasted walnuts and liked it much better. i also skipped the sugar which added nothing but calories.

This recipe is extremely adaptable. I used halved grapes, as suggested by a previous reviewer, left out the apples, used brown rice instead of wild and half a cube of bullion instead of the broth I didn't have. I threw dried taragon in with the rice to cook. I added pecans, and they were good, but I think adding the celery would have balanced the dish out perfectly. I'll definitely make this again after Thanksgiving.

Very, very, very, very yummy. This one is definitely a keeper, great for a light summer supper. The tarragon vinegar is essential. You'll miss out if you substitute another vinegar. In a pinch *maybe* go with apple cider, but really, the tarragon vingegar is worth the expense & trip to the grocer if you don't have it in your pantry.

Thanks to all the cooks for their advice, this was wonderful! I used craisins, additional fresh tarragon, yellow pepper, leftover turkey, the alternate dressing recipe w/ lime juice instead of the lemon, which I didn't have and toasted pecans added before serving for the added crunch. Also, the longer the flavor has to develop, the better. Great leftover and a good choice for potlucks.

LOVED this!! Used leftover Thanksgiving turkey, substituted brown rice for wild, and balsamic vinegar for the tarragon. Great combo of sweet and kicky!!

This was a great salad, especially with fresh tarragon from the garden and toasted pecans (thanks to earlier cook). Makes a large quantity.

This is an awesome chicken salad - even my husband, who hates chicken salad, likes it. I add grapes, and poach chicken breasts, and it's just wonderful!

Yum! I was thrilled to find this recipe because I used to make a similar salad, but with pasta. I have been low-carb dieting for the past 10 months (lost 90 lbs), and this is a great, good-carb alternative. I throw in extra celery, cherry tomatoes and some toasted almonds or pecans to really makes it great. Thanks again Epicurious!

If I could give this recipe 3-1/2 forks I would. It was very good and so easy to prepare. The woody flavor of the rice and the distinct flavor of the tarragon worked together beautifully. This dish would be perfect for a picnic.

This recipe is a hit everytime!! SO simple to make & presents beautifully! I have made it for 2 showers so far & people have requested the recipe both times. I usually cook the rice & chicken and chop the scallions & celery the day before so prep time the morning of the party is at a minimum. I agree, the flavor need time to meld - mix this salad up a good 2-3 hours before you're going to serve. Leftovers last in the fridge and taste great.

This was a good salad, but a distant second to a wild rice salad recipe I already have. For the dressing, mix 1/2 c. oil, 1/4 c. lemon juice, 1 tsp. sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper 1/8 tsp. tarragon leaves. For the salad, mix 3 c. cubed chicken, 2 c. cooked wild rice, 1/4 c. chopped green pepper, 1/4 c. c. green onions 1/2 c. almonds. Mix the dressing and salad separately, then toss together. Best after the flavorrs have developed, 2-3 hours.

This is hands down the best recipe I have used from Epicurious. Delicious, easy, versatile. Substitute asparagus or green beens for celery and use fresh herbs. I could eat this every week. At parties, everyone asks for the recipe.

The first batch of wild rice never opened up as it cooked (according to these directions) so I made another batch according to the package, and it came out fine. But the overall combination tasted strange, kind of bitter. Don't know what went wrong. I usually love all of these ingredients.

I made this for a luncheon and it was a big hit! The only thing I added was chopped walnuts.

Absolutely delicious. Especially if you replace the apple with sliced almonds.

Such a nice recipe if you like wild rice and fresh tarragon. Since this is a recipe from 1992, I believe the nouveau way to serve the chicken is par boiled (15 mins. for chicken breast) and then lightly grilled and served warm. A great, simple meal with a bed of spring greens and fresh fruit.

Simple and *very* tasty -- I increased the apple and tarragon, added some chopped pecans, and used sherry vinegar. I'm intrigued by the idea of adding grapes, and will probably try that next time. Aside from the fresh tarragon (a must) -- this is an extraordinarily forgiving recipe, ready to be adapted to the whims of its maker.

A nice change from the ususal rice and chicken salad. The tarragon adds a nice change of pace. Even my kids like this one!!!

great salad for leftover turkey from the holidays. instead of apples which turn brown if there are leftovers, i used dried cranberries and also added pecans.

I made this recipe from a borrowed Bon Appetit magazine a few years ago. I enjoyed it so much, I copied the recipe and added it to my personal collection. Tonight I panicked because, after just moving, I could not find my recipe box. On a whim, I searched the web and I absolutely cannot believe (and am completely grateful) that I actually found the exact recipe! It is fabulous, I would recommend this rice salad to anyone. Enjoy!

This was excellent! It had a really nice blend of flavors--I especially liked the fresh tarragon. Plus, it was very easy to make. I used a turkey tender, instead of chicken, and that worked just fine. I may try adding halved red grapes to this next time, and see how that works. I will definitely be making this again!

I baked boneless, skinless chicken breasts with celery, onion, carrots and garlic salt covered with foil in a 400 degree oven for an hour. I used that broth to cook the rice. The finished salad from your recipe was really excellent and very healthful. Spooned onto a bed of leaf lettuce, I could serve this salad to anyone. Next time, I may use a few shortcuts.

This was wonderful for a late summer luncheon and got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe!

I've made this dish a number of times and it never fails to impress. So much better than the overplayed pasta salad we all see too much of. I sometimes leave the chicken out to use it as a side dish or substitute grilled pork loin for a different taste.
