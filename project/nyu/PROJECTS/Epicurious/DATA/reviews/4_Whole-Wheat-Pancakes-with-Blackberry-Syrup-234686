I made these with 1/3 c Greek yogurt in place of the buttermilk, an extra sprinkle of sugar and olive oil in place of vegetable oil. They were incredible with a little bit of syrup and some leftover roasted duck. You also only needed probably one pancake per person - I served us two each and no one got that far.

From a notoriously poor pancake-maker ... this was fabulous! I can cook about anything else in the world but I have this "thing" about pancakes. Well, I think that I'm finally over it and The Husband agrees!! Hooray! This recipe is about as perfect as it gets. Love it so much that I plan to assemble the dry ingredients, add the instructions for the wet & cooking instructions and am sending it out to the families for Christmas gifts. Off to IKEA to find some cute packaging. I'm hooked! THANKS Epicurious!!

So easy - so good - and all whole wheat. I've used yogurt when out of buttermilk with good results.

I was looking for a recipe for whole wheat pancakes and I was excited to realize that I had all of the ingredients on hand to make them. They came out light and tender with just a hint of texture from the cornmeal. I didn't make the blackberry syrup, instead I made the blueberry syrup from the "Baked Blueberry-Pecan French Toast" recipe and added cinnamon and a pinch of salt to the blueberry syrup recipe. I garnished them with toasted pecan halves. Delicious!

Delicious. I replaced the powdered buttermilk with powdered non fat milk, because that is what I had on hand. I also made the syrup with frozen blueberries rather than blackberries, which I loved, but my swees-loving son thought was too sweet. It was so easy to make, quick and yummy. Will definitely make again.

this is a great recipe!! i was tired of buying frozen whole-wheat waffles, and this recipe makes the perfect substitute. i added a tsp of cinnamon and vanilla to the recipe and 3/4cup of apple sauce, and my kids asked for the 'yummy, crispy' waffles all week. the waffles were cooked on the lowest setting so they would not burn when i reheated them in the toaster. my 3 kids ages 5 and under loved them.

This is my standard recipe and allows for substitutions depending on what's in the cupboard. If I don't have whole wheat on hand, I like to use white + some rye flour. Today I only had one egg and about half the amount of oil called for, and they turned out great.

My kids are pancake aficionados - and give this recipe thumbs up. I agree! Cornmeal gives the pancakes a nice consistency (I used fine ground). Plan to make this again today... and will package up measured/mixed dry ingredients in ziploc bags for future use...

This is my new favorite pancake recipe. It's so easy and the pancakes are fluffy and delicious. I didn't have milk powder but used part water and part goat milk and it worked great.

I didn't make the syrup just the pancake recipe. It was really good - just like most of the reviews, I found the pancakes crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Will keep as a regular.

This is my favorite pancake recipe. They are so light and fluffy, and have a great wheat flavor. Also, they are not too sweet, so you can put on as much maple syrup as you want. Great for breakfast, and also brunch and brinner.

I use this as my standard pancake recipe now. I've never made the syrup, but I do love the cornmeal and whole wheat pancake batter-- and often add some blueberries into it.

Great WW pancake recipe. The basic batter is solid, nice and fluffy inside, a great wheaty/corn taste and a nice slightly crisp crust. This will be my basic pancake batter which I will then alter based on my mood. Today, I wanted banana/almond (or peanut) butter pancakes, so I made a few changes. I followed the recipe with the following additions/substitutions. I added a touch of cinnamon, nutmeg and salt, added a large mashed banana to the wet, instead of sugar, used 1/2 milk and water, added almond butter instead of oil, added a 1/4c oatmeal. I had to thin the batter with an addition 1/3-1/2c after I let it sit for 5min...very important to let it sit! I ate these right off the griddle without anything on them... delicious!

These were nice and light for a whole wheat pancake. I thought there was too much oil, making the pancakes a bit crisp on the outside like a waffle. Next time I will replace the oil with applesauce as suggested by another reviewer. Also, my 4-year-old didn't like the corn meal (she said "I don't like the seeds") so will probably use all whole wheat flour next time. Will also add some vanilla.

Agreed with most folks that these were delicious and light. I'd recommend these again.

These were the most delicious pancakes I've ever eaten. The entire family loved them. The texture was perfect, not at all gummy like so many pancakes, and they had a really nice flavor. I used fresh buttermilk and served them with Stonewall Kitchen raspberry syrup.

These pancakes are pancake nirvana! They are 100% whole grain, fluffy, slightly sweet, thick, tender, and they taste great! I even used hard whole wheat flour, which I generally only use for making bread because of the higher gluten content. I made a full batch of the dry mix, and divided it into 3 (3.25 oz) portions. I added 1/3 cup water, 1 egg, 1 tbsp oil, a few drops of vanilla, and some wild blueberries to the third of the dry mix I made tonight, and I got 5 good sized pancakes. I found it important to flip the pancakes earlier than I flip white ones. Flip them as soon as the edges are a bit set & the top is bubbling- don't wait for the top to look dry. This way the pancakes rise really well. Also, be sure to watch the heat of your skillet- these brown really quickly.

OMG!!! This is the best healthy pancake I've ever eaten! The family scarfed them up. Didn't have powdered milk so substituted skim milk for the water.

A good combination and ratio of milk, ww and cornmeal. No modifications. Did not make the syrup.

These are without a doubt the best pancakes. I have been searching for a long time, and here it is. You must try these if you are a whole-wheat nut, you won't believe it. Measure exactly, and don't overmix!!!

Honestly, I was expecting a little more, based on the other reviews on this site. Though they were fluffy and wholesome, they lacked something . . . something that I can't quite put my finger on. My greatest disappontment was the blackberry maple syrup. It just tasted like blackberries mixed with maple, which is a great combination, but it needed some pizzaz . .. Maybe some lemon juice to give it depth, . . . or maybe some cinnamon? One thing I would like to note is that using dried powdered buttermilk is not necessarily essential. Instead, (because of time constraints) I substituted 1 1/2 C of fresh buttermilk for the water and dried stuff and they turned out just fine. Also, I did need to turn the heat down to medium so that they would not burn, as someone else has mentioned. Overall, this was a solid recipe.

yummy cakes! I used powdered skim milk, and a little bacon grease on the grill - they came out delicious, the whole wheat flavor went really well with the smoky bacon and delicious fruit syrup (I used a cherry/berry combo)

We did not have cornmeal so I put 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. With1 1/2 cup of 2% milk, some vanilla and all the other listed ingredients, this is the best whole wheat pancake recipe I have found to date. Fluffy and light, yet flavourful and wholesome. I get asked to make some on a weekly basis. We recently went home to Quebec and got some of their famous maple syrup. Fabulous.

This recipe (or the variations I made of it) is the one I have been looking for -- optimal in flavor, texture, golden color and most importantly... density! They are fluffy and light and you would NEVER guess that they were whole wheat pancakes. Yum. I made it two mornings in a row. The first morning I didn't have sugar, corn meal or buttermilk powder. So I subsituted blackstrap molasses for the sugar (1 Tbsp, a little funky taste, but good for you!) and I substituted almond flour for the corn meal (added about 1/2 cup). Instead of the buttermilk I used our own homemade (unsweetened) kefir (1/2 cup). Used olive oil because that was all we had on hand. At first I worried it would be too thin with all that water but it came out great! I used frozen blueberries instead of blackberries in the syrup. This morning I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup almond flour and 1/3 cup fine corn meal. I cut down to a cup of water and a 1/2 cup kefir. And I used frozen raspberries in the syrup. This recipe is in the zone!

Great recipe. Didn't have dry buttermilk so skipped dry ingredients and substituted whole milk for water. Jiffy corn muffin mix also worked as a substitute for cornmeal. Kids loved it.

Very good. I did not make the blackberries but imagine the pancakes will be out of this world when I do. I followed the recipe and even used egg replacer once and it was just as good.

This was great! I used soy milk and orange juice as a subsitute for buttermilk powder and water, which worked well. I served them with Greek honey for dessert. Next time I'll serve with apples panfried in butter, sugar and cinnamon.

Really delicious! I used cake flour and 1/4 cup of wheat germ, since I had no WW flour. Also Maseca instead of strict cornmeal. We sliced strawberries and added them to the batter pools while cooking on the first side, totally delicious with the wheaty/corn taste!

I followed the advice of one reviewer and subbed applesauce for the oil. I also split the dry ingredients to save some for another time since there are just two of us. These were really light and the cornmeal added a subtle crunch. We really liked them! I also used blueberry rather than blackberry syrup.

These are great. I subbed applesauce for the oil. For anyone interested: I also added a scoop of whey protein and subbed green tea for water and both worked great. Just added a few extra tablespoons of tea to get the consistency right. I pre-made for weekday breakfasts.

These are great pancakes, and the cornmeal adds a slightly cruncy and hearty texture. But the pancakes are actually very light. I use plain dried milk instead of buttermilk and they taste so good! This is also a great recipe to mix the dry ingredients ahead of time. I usually make 4 batches each time and store the individual batches in ziploc baggies. I don't bother with the blackberry syrup, since my kids like plain old maple.

Whole-grain pancakes can be heavy, but these are light and fluffy. Yum! My 13-year-old had fun making this easy recipe with me and rated them "ultimately delicious." We found that moderately high heat was a little too hot, and turned the heat down to just above medium.

Maybe my tastes are just too jaded for healthy pancakes. I didn't care for these, even though I'm a big fan of whole wheat bread. I used just plain maple syrup, though, and maybe it's the blackberries that make healthy pancakes addicting. My husband would give them 1 fork; he doesn't want me to make them again.

These pancakes are fluffy and not too sweet. The syrup was delicious. I'm not a big pancake eater, but I went back for seconds on these. Added chopped pecans to some of them, and they were even tastier!
