Yummm, deviled eggs! Though I used extra large eggs, I found the mustard to be too much. I like spicy food, but I'll use a little less next time. I also used cayenne i/o hot sauce. I enjoyed (okay, devoured) these at picnics as a child with my Scandanavian-heritage family who immigrated to Nebraska. It seems as though deviled eggs bring us all together!

This recipe is not so different than mine. I use a 1/2 tsp of red wine vinegar with garlic in place of the hot sauce, Best Food's Mayo, about a 1/2 tsp of French's yellow mustard, a pinch of celery salt, some finely chopped chives and finish them off with sprinkling of paprika.

Great & easy receipe. Very similar to mom's but w/o the hot sauce. When bringing a dish for bbq's, I've added smoked salmon and dill.

this is exactly the recipe i use for deviled eggs, minus the hot sauce! yum yum. i don't understand all the haters commenting on this recipe. sometimes the essence of good cooking is a minimal amount of ingredients combined in exactly the right proportions. in trying to recreate the deviled eggs of my childhood i made a lot of mistakes (which included adding a lot more ingredients than this recipe has) before i got the proportions right. also, i have since then tried adding lots of different things to my deviled eggs, per more complicated recipes (tarragon; capers; anchovy paste; curry powder; onion; not all at the same time mind you! :-) and for me, i have found that the simplest still tastes the best.

So many deviled egg snobs! For most of us these are the traditional deviled eggs we grew up with. Just plain old hard-boiled eggs with mayo and a touch of mustard. I've used dry mustard. If these are too boring for you, use your imagination...add something else, this is a great base recipe too! BTW, not everyone knows how to cook the perfect hard boiled egg. My mother always cooked them until the yolks were REALLY hard cooked and VERY green around the edges. I doubt my mother was the only one who had that problem. So thanks to those who give us the basic info on how to make many of the recipes on this site!

This is the recipe I grew up with--and so that makes it a classic for me. Pure comfort food. I close my eyes & I'm back at the lake with my cousins again. However, we have become more sophisticated cooks. And even I add a little something from time to time. Maybe sometime I'll have the nerve to use dijon instead of the ball park mustard. But then it wouldn't be Grandma's recipe. Nah! I need Grandma's recipe!

Fab recipe or instructions or what-have-you. This is such a classic dish! I don't understand the other reviewers who complained about it... one can tell by looking (and reading!) that these are going to be the good 'ole classic deviled eggs that most of us ate at picnics as children. Heck, my Italian grandmother had her own variation of this recipe. Thanks to the writer for sharing this... I never learned how to make these when I was younger and am happy to be able to make these now for my own children. (BTW, I used cayenne in a pinch and thought it was fabulous!)

This deviled egg recipe is delicious and turns out great every time. I always get rave reviews. I follow the recipe exactly. Go easy on the salt - you get plenty of salt from the other ingredients. Also, be sure to mash the eggs really well with a fork before adding the ingredients. This will make them smooth and creamy. I put the egg mixture into a ziploc bag, cut off the bottom corner and squeeze it into the eggs. Very easy and elegant. Also, be sure to put the hard boiled eggs in ice water after they've cooked to make them easier to peel!

I cannot believe the number of people who claim this is a "recipe". They must be related to the "author". No one in their right mind would rate this more than one fork. I would give it zero, but that is not an option. If you are serious, don't bother. This is a joke at best.

Mmmm...yummy. Made these as an appetizer for a holiday meal. Used regular yellow mustard instead of the dijon, though (personal preference)...they were gone in seconds. Will need to make more next time.

I had a craving for deviled eggs so I tried this recipe. The yolk mixture turned out lumpy...not a very nice texture. I don't think I'll make this again...it was gross.

This is a good basic recipe that can be enhanced in many ways. My Southern grandmother always added a little chopped scallion and bacon to the filling.

Terrible. Add cider vinegar (usually equal to the amount of mustard) and a little finely minced onion & dill pickle. The eggs should have a zing to them. By the way, this was the most requested recipe of my mother's for church socials and holidays (especially Easter); and she was a woman from Pennsylvanian German ancestry. We were always told deviled eggs were German - Amish. Maybe they were originally from South Germany.

Loved it. Classic recipe... I put a twist on it by making small devil tails with an exacto knife and seaweed and sticking them from the thick end. Also used red food coloring to spice up the theme. Quite a hit!

This really is a terrific recipe, whether you add relish or not. As for piping the filling in with a pastry bag, it not only looks nicer but it's much faster and less messy!

Rating: 3
Exactly the way me & everyone in my family (probably for generations) has made them, only I've never tried adding the hot sauce. And yes, French's Classic Yellow Mustard (and lots of it, I love mustard) is the best. And who says you can't use store-bought mayo? We only use Best Foods, and they're perfect...and just NOT the same without the paprika (even if you can't taste it). And frankly, if you use an icing bag to fill them, you scare me.

I thought this recipe sounded a lot like the one I have made for years, but once I made the filling, I thought it needed more mayonnaise, which I added to give it a creamier consistency, then it was pretty good, but not great. I prefer using spicy mustard over Dijon. BTW, I have "never" heard of adding relish to deviled eggs, sounds awful!

Rating: 3
This is a great standard recipe. It IS just like your Grandmother used to make. I personally prefer French's Classic Yellow Mustard - as that makes it even more like Grandma, especially if you are from the South.

This recipe is nice and simple. I would add a little less mustard because it was a bit strong. Overall, I was very impressed with this recipe...you don't have to chill for a whole hour though, maybe 1/2 an hour!

This is just the way my mother, aunts and grandmother used to make deviled eggs. I have never had them with relish (one reviwer suggested that they could not be deviled eggs without it-I've never heard of them with it). These were just lovely. So traditional and good. A reminder to all of us we do not always need firworks on the table to impress.

This recipe only works if you do a couple of things-- first of all, never, ever, ever, use store bought mayo in deviled eggs. Make it yourself, and the rewards will be far, far greater. Use a very good quality hot-sauce. Add a dash of salt. Use a pastry bag to pipe in the egg mixture to make it look appetizing.

Just like Mom used to make! I added dried dill weed. Sure did bring back great memories of picnics & fun. Licking the wax paper was almost as much fun as licking the ice cream blades!

These eggs are simply wondeful and didn't last very long. I added just a dash of curry powder which gave it a subtle oriental flavor. Will definitely make this again.

Classic deviled eggs. Mild, creamy, with just a bit of tang. Use a pastry bag with a large star tip to pipe the yolk mixture into the egg white for an elegant touch. Nothing could be easier to make an impressive-looking and great tasting hors d'oeuvre.

This is a joke right? I wanted a true recipe. I know enough about deviled eggs to know that this would make a bland, runny, mess that would be thrown away by anyone with taste buds. Skip this one "story" and try a true recipe.

This is very close to my Mom's recipe that she learned growing up in Northern California in the 30's. The only difference is that her family used a pinch of cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce. And the amount of mayonnaise should be considered negotiable. Depending on the size of the eggs, you might need to add a bit more. Don't try to make deviled eggs low fat or you'll be disappointed. Use real mayonnaise, not low fat, and not "Kraft Dressing"!

I'm rating this before I've tried it because, for me too, this is the exact recipe I use for deviled eggs! My mom (who really couldn't cook at all) used to make them as an appetizer for every fancy dinner she made. When I started to cook this was one of the first things she let me make. She thought I was a regular Julia Child when I had the inspiration to add mustard! Now, I'm going to try the hot sauce, since hubby loves it so. Since I'm an Irish American girl from New York City I guess this really is the All-American Party Dish! Easy, foolproof and delicious.

This is the exact recipe that I use and I definitly love it. Only whe I made it I took the egg yolk paste and put it in a plastic baggie with a hole in the corner and sqeezed it out into the egg. Delicious, highly recommended.

This recipe is like the one my mother used when I was a child. She could not afford to buy a lot of ingredients to put in deviled eggs but this simple recipe worked just fine. For us kids, instead of hot sauce, she added just a little bit of sugar.

This is the all american version of deviled eggs. Except, my mother would have left out the hot sauce, making them blander still! I like to improvise my deviled eggs, adding things I think might make them a bit more interesting. Love 'em, though. They fall into that catagory of food that evokes childhood memories of weiner roasts, church suppers and summer picnics.

Didn't think these were limited to or originated with the African American community. Regardless, the eggs were less than boring. No appeal, no zip. I wouldn't waste my time doing these again.

Very tasty and extremely simple to make - one piece of advice...if you use grey poupon dijon mustard, there is no need to add anymore salt. I made that mistake and yolk mixture was VERY salty. It was especially noticable after they were chilled.
