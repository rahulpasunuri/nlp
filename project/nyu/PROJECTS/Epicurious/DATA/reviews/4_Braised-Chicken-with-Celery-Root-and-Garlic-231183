I guessed (and the reviews corroborated) that it would be bland as written, so added paprika and red chile flakes to the dish. It was still missing acid though, so next time I'd either use a bit of wine to deglaze or drop slices of lemon in the braising liquid.

A winter favorite! I love to add porcini to this recipe.

I read the other reviews and took note. I added onion, carrots, turnips, some white wine, and a small amount of red pepper flakes!!! I cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 6 hours. Yum Yum

This recipe was easy to make and delicious. The chicken came out tender and flavorful. I loved the whole garlic cloves mixed with the celery root. I added carrots in the mix, too.

Easy, fast & tasty!!! Such an impressive yet simple recipe. I love garlic, so I put in 1 1/2 heads...next time I will put even more because it was a great idea to put the garlic on bread. I celery root was a nice change from potatoes. This recipe is a keeper.

Made this recipe last night and it was delicious. I love hot, spicy food but sometimes a dish like this, in winter, "hits the spot". Delicate sauce with a hint of thyme and the use of celeriac was inspired. Used large, organic garlic that looked like shallots when squeezed out of their skins...wonderful. Free range or organic chicken is a must for this dish, I think.

I thought this was very different, low cal but a little bland. It needed something. Sage? Pepper? Cinnamon? I would definitely make this again and the celery root was a nice change from the potato.

REALLY GOOD....the kids loved the celery root, they kept thinking they were eating potato, and ate every bite.

Love this recipe. I'm made it twice so far and will make it again. My husband loves it as well. I use chicken thighs as we prefer dark meat. I had never cooked with celery root prior to making this dish. I now love celery root. I enjoy the simple, comforting, and uncomplicated taste of this dish. Last time I made it, I had some leeks in the house and so I sliced the white and pale green sections thin and sautéed and the garlic together till the leeks were just wilting. The leeks did not take anything away from this dish but they did add another dimension of flavor.

I found this recipe a pain to make and not really worth the effort. I actually like celery root, but the end result was not my taste.

This is really quite good. Very satisfying, nice flavours and good comfort food, without much fat. This helped to cheer up my wife after a hard, demoralising day at work.

Simple, lovely flavor, pretty, comforting on a cold night. A great way to use celery root (heretofore only used for chicken soup stock).

This was very easy to make, but the chicken was too bland for my taste. The celery root was the best part of this meal, but not good enough to entice me to make it again.

Great, hearty winter fare. The celery root has a distinct flavor and the chicken came out juicy and tasty. The only change I made was doubling the amount of celery root (I had two on hand).

The chicken and the garlic were good but the celery root was unimpressive. This is a matter of taste though, others might really enjoy this vegetable.

This was my first time using celery root...I didn't even know what it looked like, but this recipe was so easy and delicious. This will become a standard in our house.

i was a little wary of the celery root just b/c i have never cooked it before, but it turned out perfectly- delicious of a cold night. we bought a loaf of rosemary sourdough and it was great with the garlic.

I cooked the chicken for 8 minutes per side, initially, but other than that, this recipe is foolproof, fast and fabulous! This will definitely be added to my repertoire!

What a wonderful combination of flavors! The celery root/garlic combination was superb. A great winter dish, and easy to prepare.
