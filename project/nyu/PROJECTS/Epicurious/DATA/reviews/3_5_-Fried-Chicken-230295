Based on other reviews, I used half the spices and put the chicken pieces on a wire rack over a looking sheet while baking. Crisp and delicious!

The way I made it tonight was really two forks BUT with modifications I think it could be 3+. As others suggested, I soaked my chicken (just used 5 boneless, skinless breats) in buttermilk. Eyeballed my dry mix which was a combo of seasoned breadcrumbs, panko, smoked paprika, garlic salt, granulated garlic & ground red pepper. Next time I will add just a small amount of smoked paprika and "regular" paprika; would skip the garlic salt and stick to granulated garlic and a bit of sea salt. I like flavor, so I tend to be very heavy handed w/my seasoning. Think I will add less Italian-breadcrumbs next time, more panko for a bit more crunch. Can get the flavor from seasonings (maybe a touch of italian seasoning to the panko). All that being said: HEALTHY & tasty. Adding a bit of grated parmesean cheese to the breed mixture would also be yummy!

This was quick and easy, and pretty tasty. I used half plain bread crumbs and half panko crumbs plus 2 tbsp dried parsley along with the other seasonings and marinated the chicken in buttermilk for about 2 1/2 hours. And I used the convection setting on my oven to ensure a crispier crust. I'd have to say, unlike other reviewers, we found the coating to be flavorful, but not all that spicy. I guess it's just a matter of taste. (Also, I made a vegetarian version for myself with 3/8" tofu slabs marinated in half soy sauce and half rice wine vinegar for atleast 40 minutes, then dip into buttermilk and dip into bread crumb mixture, and flip after cooking about 20 minutes.)

I wouldn't call this recipe fried chicken, though I really enjoyed it. I used chicken breasts, and marinated them in buttermilk for a few hours before breading them. They were yummy chicken tenders, but not like fried chicken.

My husband and I loved this recipe- so easy and tasty! I used the 1c milk w 1 tbs vinegar as another reviewer suggested since I had no buttermilk on handand soaked 8 skinless/boneless chicken thighs in it for about 10 min before dredging in the crumb mixture. I spiced the crumbs to our tastes (easier on the cayenne than the recipe calls for) and added few sprinkles of Parmesan. Placed the thighs on a cookie sheet lined w foil and sprayed w Pam and baked for the full 40 minutes. Clean up was easy breezy, too.

Way too spicy for anyone in our family. We had to scrape all of the coating off in order to stomach the chicken. The recipe calls for too much buttermilk and bread crumbs. You'll end up throwing a lot out. Took more than 40 minutes, even with boneless, skinless thighs.

The 4th fork is for the health factor in this yummy alternative to frying! I made a few changes in that I marinated the chicken in a ziploc bag of buttermilk, a little cayenne, paprika, onion and garlic powder for a few hours before dredging in the flour with a few more herbs added as well. It came out so moist and flavorful. Easily as yummy as my usual fried version!

I just made this recipe, And my family found it to be very flavorful, moist, and delicious. It was very crispy on the outside. I did however change just a few things. Fr instance I didn't have buttermilk so I used a cup of milk with 1 Tbsp of white vinegar. I mixed that together and let it sit for about 10 minutes. I also used crushed red pepper instead of ground. I used boneless chicken breasts, one was more then enough for each person. It paired very well with the cornbread and mixed veggies that i made. I will definitly be making this one again.

Absolutely delicious. I substituted cracker crumbs for the breadcrumbs and left out the red pepper. I baked as directed in the convection oven. Crisp on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. This recipe is a keeper!

i grew up in a southern household eating the best fried chicken ever. i didn't like this. the breading was too heavy for my taste. (my momma used flour :))

I deviated. Lacking the Italian breadcrumbs, I used panko and Italian seasoning. The flavor was very good but the coating came out soggy at the bottom of the pieces. Perhaps using a rack in the baking pan would allow the juices to drip away and the VERY spicy coating to crisp up. I also sprayed the chicken with olive oil instead of Pam.

My husband and 4 year old and I loved this. (My 7 year old didn't, but she wanted bbq chicken so I think it was just disappointment.) I didn't use the cayenne; instead I added a little Old Bay, which was better for the kids. I also didn't use the Pam spray - I drizzled it with a little (1 Tbsp) melted butter for 6 pieces of chicken. I realize that adds a bit more fat, but a lot more flavor. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't stick to a metal pan like I was fearing. The chicken was very moist, just like fried chicken. I would definitely make this again; it assuages my taste for fried chicken without my feeling horribly guilty. I paired it with mashed potatoes mixed with pureed cauliflower and my kids never noticed the addition. Shhhh. Don't tell.

My husband LOVED this chicken; he wants me to make it for company! I made it with unseasoned bread crumbs and regular cooking spray. So easy, very moist, and cooks to a golden brown. Not flashy, but definitely a good, quick after-work meal that's worth repeating.
