My family loves this recipe. I cheat and use pie crust from the market. I use low fat sour cream and smart balance instead of butter. Flavors are still great.

I was shocked when I read the okay (1 fork) review. This is my most requested dessert. Whenever I'm asked to take something to a pot luck or dinner, this is always at the top of the list. As with other readers, I've substituted (usually because I've forgotten to buy pecans) almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts for the pecans, and it always works. I grow my own bluberries and freeze as many as I can while they are coming on. This pie is a delight in the cold winter months, when a touch of early summer is needed, and having the frozen berries is as good as fresh. I make this in a removeable bottom tart pan. It makes a better presentation, and it also makes it easier to get that "first slice" out. There for a while I was making this pie so often I was getting tired of it.

I absolutely loved this pie! So did everyone else at our Easter dinner because it was gone in no time and we had plenty of other desserts. I took another reviews advise and used good quality frozen berries(fresh were so expensive), and I can't imagine that fresh could have been better. For me, this recipe is a keeper!

I actually thought this recipe was a delicious change from plain blueberry pie. The only change I made to make it more coherent was to use sliced almonds in the topping rather than pecans. The combination of almond and blueberry was interesting and tasty.

Loved this pie and so did all my guests. The only change I made was that I added the grated rind on one lemon for an extra boost and it worked out great. Need to cook it for the full time in orer to have it set proeperly and I used a stroe bought crust to save time. Will make it again for sure!

Rating: 1
Eh. This pie was okay. The sour cream added a slight tanginess to the filling, and the custardy filling drowned out a lot of the blueberry flavor. Overall, I would prefer the blueberries to be the highlight of the dessert and will probably stick to a more traditional blueberry pie in the future.

After reading all the suggestions on how they modified the recipe I chose to take a little bit from four other reviewers. I used a store bought crust.I placed it in a tart pan. I made the filling minus one quarter cup sugar,one quarter teaspoon vanilla and one half teaspoon almond extract and a half cup extra blueberries. I made the topping with four tablespoons flour, one half cup rolled oats,one tablespoon cinnamon,one quarter cup sugar and one stick butter.I added five minutes to the bake time and it came out great. I'll make it again soon.

This pie has been a favorite at our house every summer (blueberry season) for years. This year, due to food allergies I had to leave out the almond extract and pecans. I used vanilla and made the topping with oatmeal instead. It browned up nicely and the pie maintains its place as our summertime favorite.

This pie is so delicious! I also like it because it converts very well to a sugar free pie for my diabetic friends. Just use Splenda in place of the sugar!

This is a great filling recipe (I substituted vanilla for almond extract and added a handful of extra blueberries). I used a the Pillsbury roll out pie crust, which is actually very good, for the bottom and top crust and brushed with egg. It takes about 7 minutes to put together and is absolutely delicious.

Neither my boyfriend nor I liked this very much. I didn't have time to make the crust so I used a store-bought graham cracker crust, as suggested. That made the pie cloyingly sweet, but it just wasn't so good in general.

I've been making this pie for a few years, it is always delicious and gobbled up whenever it is served; in addition, people always ask for the recipe. I have made the crust with the recipe and used store bought crust otherwise no changes to receipe, both ways are loved by all!

My sister-in-law made this and I fell in love, so I had to try making it myself. Oh my goodness, this is such a great recipe! I used frozen drained wild blueberries which I think are just as good as fresh. The topping was what really made this pie special. I think almonds would be good instead of, or in addition to, pecans. Four forks all the way - you MUST try this!

Rating: 4
Wow, people could not stop eating this. I made it with a graham cracker crust recipe that i made up, which included some oatmeal and organic sucanat sugar in place of granulated. That part was spectacular, as was the pie itself. The topping was weird, I didn't add nuts to it due to a nut allergy, but the mixture without nuts did not brown at all even when I left it in longer. It could stand alone without the topping as it looks pretty with all the blueberries peaking out. I brought this to a friend's house and her entire family ate it without my noticing--they said they couldn't stop themselves and demanded the recipe. I think that's a good sign!

The best thing about this pie is how easy it is to make! To make it even easier, I simply use a store-boughten graham cracker crust. I top with slivered almonds instead of the pecans.

This is my family's favorite blueberry pie recipe. It works with frozen berries too. If you don't want the frozen berries to turn the pie purple, just thaw and drain them before adding to the batter. I have also used walnuts in the topping and vanilla in the batter. I am not a great maker of pies, but this one always turns out great!

This pie has become my bring-it-to-a-potluck staple. Sometimes I make it with sliced almonds instead of pecans on top. Also, frozen berries works, but it turns the whole inside of the pie purple (Which I kinda like!). I use the frozen organic ones.

Have been baking pies since 16 and this might be the best, ever. Used 3 full pints of berries in a deep-dish pan, leaving rest of ingredients same - plenty sweet, plenty rich and just ever so berry-ish. Added 1t Penzey's baking spice (a great blend) to filling, 1/2 t to topping, also substituted toasted almonds for pecans. Fabulous ...

I don't get. I prepared my guests by telling them about all of the rave reviews this pie received and then, after taking a few bites, we all sort of shrugged our shoulders. It was good. It was fine. It was not superb by any stretch of the imagination.

Rating: 4
Wow! This was fantastic just as written. I do NOT bake, but I will make you a fabulous five course meal, typically - but for some reason this looked like a great thing to make to finish off my labor day BBQ party of eight with. It was fantastic and I will make it again. It was relatively easy too, for someone who doesn't like to bake. And, at the risk of getting pelted with rocks and garbage like the other earlier reviewers, I also used a pre- made pillsbury pie crust for the bottom.

Sorry, since blueberry pie is my all time favorite, I'm just a purist, I guess. This was okay but I was a little dissappointed after reading all the great reviews. Will stick to the plain old-plain old recipe. No improving on the basics here.

This is a spectacular pie - I've been making it for about 3 years now, and boy! What a recipe. Not difficult, tastes like a dream, no matter what crust you use. Guests are mesmerized. It's EVEN MORE WONDERFUL with fresh huckleberries (!). Believe me, this is your Absolute Success Pie. I'm right there with the cook who had to stop making it because of her waistline.

This didn't work for me. Used store bought frozen crust, but otherwise followed recipe as written. Didn't set up well, and that aside, the taste combination didn't appeal to me either..... FOLLOW UP- Despite leaving this review the day I made this pie, I somehow managed to keep eating it, and eating it, and eating it.... Maybe there is something to it.. Still not going to make it again though - my figure can't handle it!

This turned out very nicely- a keeper. And to the cook in Rochester- the only disgraceful thing is your culinary arrogance and lack of tact. If using pre-made pie-crus is such a travesty in your life- it must be a very sad one.

To the Cook from Up, WA. You are right. I didn't mean to preach to others on this website. Having lost people on September 11th I have found myself more sensitive to what may appear to be tones of intolerance. Apologies Rochester... I didn't mean to make a 'big deal' out of pie crust.

This got great reviews from some friends when we took it over for dinner tonight. A fun change from your regular blueberry pie. I was short on time so I used the Pillsbury crust as well and it turned out well, although I did have to watch it carefully for overbrowning as others mentioned.

Fantastic recipe, followed it exactly with one exception...I'm not too fond of almond extract, so I used a generous tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. I covered the crust during the blind baking and the second baking and it came out a beautiful golden brown. The topping could use a little more time in the oven than specified, but it was delicious. Everyone loved it and the leftovers make a superb breakfast!

I am not a pie fan at all but this recipe was absolutely fabulous, and easy to make. I've already made it three times and I only just found it last week. I cut the amount of sugar in half as well and it was just sweet enough. I am a new fan of blueberries.

Rating: 4
I decided to make this in a tart pan, and that prevented any crust burning issues. I love to cook, but am not skilled at baking. I guess it is too precise a science. But, I mastered this dish and my company LOVED it! It is not too sweet, so having some with a glass of port or after dinner wine is a wonder idea.

No problems whatsoever, turned out exactly right, using the times in the recipe. However, unless you're a blueberry grower just dying for a different blueberry pie recipe, I'd opt for a plain old 2-crust, blueberry-only pie. UPDATE: I'll have to admit that I liked it much better the second day, after it had thoroughly chilled. Perhaps I would make it again...

Rating: 3
I made this the day after making the Open-Faced Blueberry Pie which my family all liked much better. It tasted OK but even with foil on the rim of the dish it was hard to get the filling cooked without burning the rim of the pie (which I had to trim off in the end).

With my first bite, I wasn't sure about this pie. But by the time I finished my slice, I was hooked. The crumble topping is essential. A lattice top or top crust will not provide a depth of flavor or the crunch of the pecans. Mine did take a few extra minutes to brown the topping, also, be sure to blind bake the crust. I was too lazy to use the foil and weights/beans and my crust slouched into the pan something fierce, took me longer to push it back up the sides than if I had simply followed the instructions! Oh well, tasty pie, and all my guests loved it. Being all men, they wanted vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream with it!

I made this with a different crust and a lattice top. It was very good, and tasted better to me than regular blueberry pie, but not fabulous. I think it would have been better if I stuck with the crumble topping to provide more flavors.

This was not outstanding by any means but good nonetheless. Interesting mix of flavours. I might make it again.

The almond-flavored sour cream filling was different and ok, but I missed the pure, oozing blueberries that you get w/ a traditional homemade blueberry pie. The one from the Silver Palate cookbook is my standard. I also thought it was too sweet, but this may be b/c I used fresh, in-season, New Jersey blueberries, which were wonderfully sweet already. The crust was good - but it does brown quickly. I won't be making this one again.

Rating: 4
Glad I shielded the crust edge with foil as suggested since the filling needed to bake an extra 10 minutes to set. Wonderful tartness--not too sweet. Best blueberry pie I have ever tasted! Local peaches are coming to market and I'd bet they would adapt well to this recipe---or how 'bout a peach/blueberry combo?

A really different and delicious version of a blueberry pie. The key to success is protecting the crust with a bit of tin foil. As many others have written, the sour cream based filling elevates this above the typical fruit pie.

Took this to a party and everyone loved it. Next time I will make two changes- only because I love blueberries so much. Reduce almond extract to 1/2 tsp, and omit pecans. I love them both, but they detracted from the blueberry flavor. I used a refrigerated crust and it was fine.

One of the best pies I've had. I made it with lite sour cream the 1st time and nonfat sour cream the 2nd time, still was wonderful. The 2nd time I made it with half raspberriers and half blackberries, very yummy. My husband is not a big sweet eater but he ate a 1/4 of the pie at one time, not like him at all. He loved it.

Rating: 3
Loved it! The almond falvored "custard" was not too sweet, and the contrast of the tart berries was perfect! I will be serving this to guests as individual tarts for an upcoming luncheon. But I will use my own crust recipe. This one was flavorless and became tough in the food processor.

I prepared this pie for a dinner party. It got rave reviews ! One person commented that he was comparing it to desserts at a well known restaurant in SF and it beat all he had tasted. I am now officially known as an excellent baker in that circle of friends. I did have to bake the filling about 10 minutes longer and put foil over the top during those last 10 minutes. Amazing pie! Try with creme fraiche.

This pie is absolutely delicious. I made the suggested crust and it worked very well- though I did cover the edged halfway through the baking process because they looked like they were going to burn if I didn't. It has a really interesting taste and texture and I enjoyed it more than a regular blueberry pie. The sour cream adds a really nice sweet tang to the pie. Also, blueberried are not in season right now so I used frozen ones (that I thawed) and they worked perfectly

Rating: 4
This pie was utterly exceptional! I did use an alternate pie crust (also from Epicurious, however) simply because I had already made one for another purpose. Nevertheless this pie was extraordinary. I should note that while I adore blueberries, I am not a great fan of fruit pies in general; this one was good enough to win me over. Mine did take slightly less time to bake than noted in the recipe, but my oven runs hot so that was no particular surprize. The flavor is rather hard to describe adequately: very "berry" but something much more (probably the almond extract is the critical addition). My only regret is that I served the pie at an impromptu barbecue with some Philistine friends of mine. He wouldn't eat it because he is on the Atkins diet (egad); she didn't eat it because by the time dessert arrived she was too drunk to hold a fork. Happily, this simply left more pie for my wife and me! Perhaps I need a new set of friends...Nonetheless, enjoy this recipe, but only serve it to those who appreciate quality. I highly recommend this pie (and I do a fair amount of baking so my instincts are good indeed).

I followed the recipe exactly and my only complaint is The crust was burnt before the filling and toping were done. I had no problems with the filling being thin, you can't tell from looking at the finished product that there is sour cream in it but there is a richness in the filling. I had to excelerate all my steps though and even turn down the oven heat to keep it from turning to ash. Still with the crust off it's very tasty. Not sure what went wrong?

Absolutely yummy! I had some pate brisee in the freezer and used that instead of the suggested crust. The blueberry filling was so easy to make and was the perfect sweetness. I made the topping without the pecans( because my husband doesn't care for nuts) and it was delicious. Amazing how easy this recipe is.

Rating: 4
I made this for a picnic and everyone asked for the recipe! I used blueberries that I had picked and frozen but I did not let them thaw first. This caused the filling to take a longer time to cook so I had to cover the crust to prevent burning. Also, I used brown sugar in the topping.

Good recipe...nice change from old fashion blueberry pie recipes and doesn't call for too many berries. It is berry season now so I'm sure I'll cook this again very soon. Had to bake it longer to have the filling set...about 10 to 15 mins. extra. Thought that the crust was going to get too dark, but it came out flaky and perfect. Also, used my own crust recipe (one from the joy of cooking cook book...I always refridgerate my ingredients before making the crust and it comes out so flaky.)

To make this a really "full" pie, use one large container of sour cream and 1 3/4 containers of blueberries. Add a splash of lemon juice and two shakes of nutmeg. Bake for 30 min. or so, top w/topping (add a bit of cinnamon to the topping) - magnificent and easy, w/the pillsbury pie crust.

Very nice pie with good clear instructions. One thing though: I had trouble putting the topping on the pie as it was in sticky glumps from sitting in a hot kitchen; maybe I should have kept it in the fridge until the last minute, I don't know. I wasn't sure whether to take it out of the oven and work on it or keep it on the rack with all the heat escaping from the oven while I tried to "sprinkle" the glumps (which totally stuck to my fingers!) After 15 minutes it still wasn't brown either, but a little broiler action did the trick. The glumps were crispy and tasted great! Everyone in the family loved the results.

My boyfriend absolutely LOVES this pie. He asks me to make it as soon as blueberry season arrives and all throughout the summer season. I have to admit, I am not a pie fan and I love this pie too. It is so easy to make and the flavors are really rich. The pecans really complement the pie.

Wonderful - changed the topping somewhat, added a little oatmeal, almonds and almond paste, looked and tasted yummy.

SO delicious! I prefer vanilla extract to almond, so I made that change, and I also prefer deep dish pies, so I multiplied both the filling and the top crust by one and a half. I baked it at the same temperature, but for a little longer (covering the crust with aluminum foil so it wouldn't burn), and it was just right. I could've eaten the whole thing myself. Oh--and I used light sour cream and couldn't tell. This is definitely going to be a blueberry season tradition.
