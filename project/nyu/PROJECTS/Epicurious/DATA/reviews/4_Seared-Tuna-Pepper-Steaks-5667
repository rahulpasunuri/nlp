YUM! My husband is a fisherman and I cook tuna a lot. I think tuna is very bland by itself and always needs a kick. The sauce is delicious! I used sherry instead and it was great. A nice change from the asian/soy thing. Decreased the butter to 3tbl. Got out a piece of bread to sop up leftover sauce!

My family made happy noises while they ate, and left the table talking about how much they enjoyed the meal. My husband even mentioned it the next day! The sauce (I used half the butter, and vegetable bouillon since we don't eat chicken) went perfectly with the tuna, and the baby potatoes from my garden. We had roasted brussels sprouts and a mixed salad on the side.

My husband and I loved this! I added shitake mushrooms to the shallot mix and ~ 2 TBLS lemon. we didn't have brandy so used whisky. I also seared the tuna while the liquids were being reduced. well deserving of 4 forks

Classic cooking. Gotta love the mellow pepper flavor. I highly recommend bread to sop up any sauce that drip onto the plate. I paired it with roasted asparagus.

This recipe was perfect. Served the steaks with a light salad for a complete and healthy meal. Still savoring the taste.

I was rushing out of the office last night and peeked at Epicurious.com to get an idea for how to cook the tuna steak I was craving and came across this recipe. I had everything on hand for the sauce (used Knob Creek bourbon instead of the spirit called for in the recipe), threw some baby red potatoes in the microwave for four minutes, sliced up some romaine/radichio/chopped peaches/blue cheese crumbles in the salad bowl with a little olive oil, then whiped up the sauce in two minutes. In fifteen minutes after arriving home I had a meal put together that was worthy of a really nice bottle of wine. I'm a genius! Had never though of the sauce with Tuna but it really worked.

This was my first time cooking ahi tuna and I was a bit nervous. The cooking time for me was much shorter about 2 minutes a side. I loved the reduction, so tasty. I did have to substiture whiskey for brandy and an onion for shallots. It is rich so simple sides pair nicely. Keeper and so easy for dinner parties.

I used frozen yellow fin tuna filets from Publix, which I thawed in a 30 minute cold water bath. This recipe couldn't be simpler or more delicious. This will go into the regular rotation file. Served along with a spring mix, gorgonzola & toasted walnut salad and the maple horseradish beets from this site, which I highly recommend as well.

Very simple, very elegant with a big wow factor. Cannot go wrong with this one.

Really good and quick... even though I overcooked my tuna (I like it rare, and it wound up medium/med well). I used much less butter than called for and used onions, served over rice. It was delicious. Next time, I would cook the tuna for 1.5-2 min per side tops.

Superb dish that the Secretary of War loved also. She's very hard to please, especially with fish dishes. I also cut way back on the butter and did not miss it. I cooked the first side a little over 3 min and about 2.5 min on the flip side for medium rare. Will probably do 3 and 3 next time. An easy dish for a dinner party. I sauteed steamed brocolli with garlic and onion as a side. Rice, cous cous or the potatoes would be fine for a starch.

I've had a hit-or-miss experience on epicurious as a whole, but this one was a hit. I did as other reviewers suggested and cut the butter in half, and used whiskey because I didn't have brandy. I also used coarsely ground mixed peppercorns since I didn't have whole, and applied it liberally. Spaetzle, gnocchi, or noodles on the side with a little of the sauce, and it's a fantastic winter tuna dish. Highly recommended.

Husband said this was the best FISH recipe I ever made. Used half the butter and still turned out great. So easy and delicious. A dish to impress friends or just for a weeknight. Timing for tuna doneness was right on for me. Used individually frozen sushi quality tuna from Costco.

We often make this recipe as it is quick and easy to prepare on a week night. We add soy sauce and wasabi to the sauce which gives it a more asian taste.

Made it with 1/2 the butter (health reasons) and, although you do not get the "proper" sauce consistency, it was outstanding nonetheless.

I really liked this - actually had time to make it after church for lunch on a Sunday - VERY EASY and fast. I overcooked the tuna to my taste so next time I'll sear much less time; also, the butter definitely should be reduced to just a few tablespoons. I only salted the fish, not the sauce - then we also spooned the sauce over a brown rice and mushroom side; the sauce tasted almost sweet over the side dish, but more salty over the fish - a nice contrast with similar tastes.

Because I made a really flavourful side dish for this recipe, I didn't add the 'dressing'. I found (and my company will agree) that just the tuna steaks with the cracked pepper were suburb. A good dish when your appy's and side dishes are packed with flavour.

Rating: 4
A great fall/winter tuna recipe. No changes needed (well maybe I did increase the amount of shallots a bit so that the butter amount was ok)! Sides of sauteed spinach (just a little butter and lots of garlic)and fingerling potatoes roased in a little good olive oil and sea salt were perfect.

I was expecting more from this dish. I was looking for something other than the usual asian flavors we use for tuna, but this was not good. I think it is a personal preference thing, based on the many rave reviews. We did not think it complimented the tuna at all.

Simply delicious! My guests are still raving. I used less butter than called for, with no detrimental effects on the taste.

This was yummy to me... my fiance,on the other hand, thought it was too healthy tasting. I believe it needed to be kicked up a notch, so i'll try again with extra seasoning.

I've made this many times now for friends and family, and it's a big hit. But listen: sashimi-grade ahi tuna, crusted with pepper and salt, doesn't need the accompaniment of shallots, brandy etc. Just stick to the seared ahi. Seriously, the flavor is light but very very nice, and needs nothing else to complete it. This is a dish that literally takes 5 minutes to make but looks and tastes great.

This recipie calls for far more fat than the vegatables can absorb. The olive oil used to saute the tuna steaks would be enough--if you have to use butter for flavor, use 1/8 stick instead of 1/2 stick. (A better version of this recipie appeared in the 8/99 issue of Bon Appetit using only 2 tablespoons of oil.)

My boyfriend made this last night. It was delicious. We used onions instead of shallots and cut down on the butter (we used 3 tbsp., but maybe even less - 1 or 2?). The flavor of the onions and pepper really last long enough to complement the fish all the way through every mouthful!

Man, I don't get it. I cook every night, so I'm a very experienced cook and I thought this to be a waste of good tuna. The sauce was without taste and had a lot of fat.

This was fantastic. I didn't have brandy but used sherry and it was very tasteful. I will try it with brandy. The only thing I would change is using a little less butter. It was a little oily, but very delicious!

This recipe is heavenly! The fish just melts in your mouth. The sauce is very rich and creamy tasting. To the cook who found the sauce bitter, I would suggest letting it cook a bit longer and reduce a bit more. (Sometimes the reducing process takes longer than stated in the recipe given the peculiarities of one's particular stove.) I was out of shallots one evening and substituted onions with no ill effect on the recipe. In fact, my fiance said he liked it even better with the onions.

This was yummy and I love the fact that it's so quick and easy! I too used whiskey instead of brandy and it turned out great. My picky boyfriend even liked it!

I've tried this recipe twice. It was very easy and the fish was delicious; but we found the sauce rather bitter. I expected that more of the alcohol taste would burn off. The moral of the story is: if you don't like brandy, then don't do this sauce! But if you do, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

This recipe is wonderful! I don't particularly care for fish but this was extremely good. The only changes we made to the recipe were using beef broth instead of chicken broth and use 1/2 cup of whiskey rather than brandy. I think we're going to make this again tonight!

Being a huge fan of the restaurant Aqua, I was excited to try this recipe. It was delicious! Easy to prepare and great for a pepper lover. The same prep would also be good on beef or chicken. Personally, I think using Ahi would be a shame to pair with the strong pepper flavor. I used Albacore.

This was a great and easy to make recipe. I was missing Brandy and Shallotsm so substituted onions and whiskey, which worked well.

Great recipe! Easy to make. Served with black pepper fettuccine on the side that complimented the pepper coating on the tuna. Definately do not cook the tuna for as long as the recipe calls for.

Like most tuna recipes I cook the steaks for a maximum of 90 seconds per side. If you like rare tuna that is the only way to go. Disappponited in this sauce. Made recipe taste too much like beefsteak.

Rating: 4
Very good and easy to make. Cooking 3 1/2 minutes per side is definitely too long, though--it was closer to well than medium. Other than that, the sauce was wonderful and everyone liked the dish.

This recipe was so easy. However, be careful not to overcook the fish if you prefer rare tuna. We had steaks that were slightly less than 1 1/2 inch but we only cooked them for 2 minutes on one side and 1 1/2 minutes on the other and we got medium steaks, rather than rare as we were hoping. Nonetheless, we will definitely make this recipe again - it was wonderful.

A friend of ours called to say he just caught a tuna and asked if we would like some - after saying, "Yes please," without hesitation,I went to Epicurious to find a new recipe. The recipe and the many reviews caught my attention. We probably didn't even need a sauce to enjoy a fish that was less than 12 hours out of the Atlantic Ocean, but the sauce made a good piece of fish great! The only thing I did that was a bit different than stated in the recipe was that I heated the oil on high heat in the pan until it smoked so I could get that "thick rich brown crust" on the outside and "medium rare" tuna on the inside. If you like tuna, you might also want to try Seared Fish Steaks with Horseradish Sauce - the sauce is great on swordfish as well. Thanks to our friends the Mayers, Epicurious, and the reviewers, we dined well last night!

Wonderful dish. The sweetness of the shallots and brandy balanced perfectly with the tuna. I tried the same recipe with Mahi-Mahi and was very disapointed. I guess I will have to stick the the format given!

I cooked this recipe as a course for my parents anniversary. I took thin slices of the tuna and lay them on sauteed potatoes with sauteed kurly kale as garnish. The other dinner guests were so impressed with this one dish, I may jack in my job and become a chef!

Gentlemen, I would not recommend serving this dish to your wife. I did so three weeks ago, and she could not stop raving about it. She has since requested that I make it for our friends on two separate occasions. It is absolutely delicious, and best of all it is very easy to prepare.

whenever we want to impress our friends with a "restaurant quality" meal, this is the one we use. Very easy to make. We use course ground black pepper instead of the cracked black pepper. It seems to stick to the tuna better, and gives the fish a very intense pepper flavor.
