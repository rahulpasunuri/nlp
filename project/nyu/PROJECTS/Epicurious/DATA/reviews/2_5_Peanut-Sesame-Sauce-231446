Really tasty on the cold sesame noodle 66! I didn't have enough peanuts and all I had on hand was Thai flavored cashews...but really I think that made it extra delicious!

More work than it's worth. Just ok, but a lot of time and expense.

This is an excellent "stand alone" peanut sauce to make and store. I use it w/chicken or pork. Found it when searching for a peanut sauce after reading a recipe that sounded great, but the peanut sauce that accompanied it was panned. This is an excellent substitute for the sauce in the "coconut-lime shrimp w/peanut sauce" on this site.

I was searching for a peanut sauce after reading another shrimp recipe w/peanut sauce wherein the peanut sauce was considered not good to baddddd. This is a very tasty sauce to use in any recipe that calls for peanut sauce. I use it w/chicken or shrimp.

It's designed to go with Cold Sesame Noodles in the same issue (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/231439)

USE IT FOR WHAT? Odd that this recipe sits out here like this with nothing attached to it. It seems like a satay sauce recipe, but no chicken? No pork on a stick?
