I made this today for a party we threw to accompany hot dogs and hamburgers. It was really easy to put together and I thought it tasted really good. I was going to give it the four-fork rating, but that is "exceptional", and though I thought this was very good, I'm not sure I would describe it as "exceptional". I will definitely make it again, though. I wanted a potato salad that didn't have mayo and this was great. I added some extra Old Bay at the end because I thought it needed more. Otherwise, I didn't change anything.

A great change from mayo-based potato salad. I roasted the red onion instead of soaking in vinegar and cut back on the oil - loved it!

The marinated onions absolutely make this dish - I sub a double mustard dressing (mark Bittman has one that's good) for the Old Bay and it's awesome.

I've been making this since it was published nearly 4 years ago and I absolutely love it. Here's what I've learned... Use all the vinegar to pickle the red onion, then drain the onion and use the vinegar to make the vinaigrette. Use a variety of small new potatoes & fingerlings for the prettiest presentation. Don't peel them (lots of nutritional value in the peel and right under the skin - plus the peel is pretty). Halve them if more than a bite. Toss while quite warm so the potatoes soak up all the vinaigrette. Enjoy! I love this with any variety of BBQ and it's especially nice to bring along as it doesn't need to be refrigerated.

I'm giving it a 4, it was one of the only potato salad variations (from the classic style) that we both loved. It's original, and the marinated red onions really make the dish. Next time I might add something crunchy....(celery maybe) as I thought it could use another texture, but made this "as written" this time and it was great!

Love this potato salad! Thin onion slices instead of wedges and used much less oil (taste as you go). It is a slightly weird coloured salad though - pink & yellow...but so so good.

I love the seasoning on this recipe. And marinating the onions to soften them and take the edge off works beautifully, although I would chop them a bit finer so they distribute better through the potato salad. I would, in addition, make some changes in how to cook the potatoes: For one, the skins have all the nutrition. For another, by the time you wait for the potatoes to cool before peeling them, you lose the advantage of having the the seasoned vinegar seeping into the hot potatoes. And, while waiting for the potatoes to cool with skins on, the potatoes keep cooking and get mushy too easily. Thoroughly wash the potatoes, cleaning out dirt & eyes, etc. Keep skins on (or if you'd prefer, peel the potatoes first). Chop the potatoes into bite sized chunks. Steam the potatoes until just fork tender. As soon as the potatoes are cooked, while hot, place them in a serving bowl and pour the seasoned vinegar over them. Combine the onions in with the potatoes. (BTW, I used Chesapeake Bay Seasoning by Penzeys, just as good as Old Bay).

I made this with the "Peach Laquered Chicken" for 4th of July dinner and it was the perfect meal! I didn't use a full 5 lbs. of potatoes given it was just my husband and I, and I didn't use the full amount of olive oil - after reading a previous review, I tasted as I added the oil, and it turned out perfectly! I didn't back off of any of the other ingredients though and this really was like salt and vinegar chips, and is now one of my husband's and my favorites.

If you love salt and vinegar potato chips, you will love this salad. It is so yummy and satisfies the salty craving!

Very good -- easy to make and unusual. Marinading the onions is a great touch. Great for picnics, parties, etc. because it contains no mayonnaise.

This has been a barbecue staple of mine for the last year or so. No mayo, no eggs, very little chopping. Make the night ahead to make sure the onion mellows and softens. Absolutely addictive.

this was a hit with my husband's family. I cut the recipe in half but added 1 sliced red pepper. Old Bay Seasoning is something I don't think we have in Canada. What is in it?

Don't get me wrong... I love Mom's potato salad, but this makes my heart sing! Warm, cold, whatever. I couldn't get enough!

This salad was tasty. I used 1/2 cup of oil, and I would saute the onions before adding to the salad for a more German Potato taste (with less indigestion).

This potato salad is anything but uninteresting. Magnificent! It turned out I didn't have any cider vinegar so I used seasoned rice vinegar which worked out great. My husband, who ususally isn't a fan of raw onions, loved the onions in this dish. Yukon Gold potatos are a must. This is at the top of my list for mayo-free potato salads.

This dish was very ok. I served it at a BBQ and it just didn't "go". The appearance was rather uninteresting - perhaps the onion slices were too big/long? Taste was a little too oily. On another note, the potatoes took much longer to get tender than 15-20 minutes. I wouldn't make this again

Be careful of your olive oil. Mine wass exra-vergin but had a very heavy flavor which overpowered the vinegar. I had to add some extra vinegar to offset the strong olive oil flavor. Next time I'll add the oil more gradually to check the flavor or buy a more mild olive oil. This is still a great potato salad

I thought this recipe was genius. It invloves NO mayonnaise and no celery. YES! I loved the tangy vinegar and the Old Bay seasoning was the perfect touch. The onion strips were nice and tender after marinating for 45 minutes. YUM!

Great with the potential to be specatular with a little tinkering. Made and then served an hour later. At that time everyone commented that the vinegar was a little strong. However the next day, the salad was a different salad... the vinegar was just right. Reccommend making several hours or day before. Also, I'll consider tinkering with some capers and perhaps a little mustard seed next time.... and also thought the recipe as is with some crispy proscuitto would be GREAT!

Delicious and easy! Great to have a good potato salad without mayonnaise.
