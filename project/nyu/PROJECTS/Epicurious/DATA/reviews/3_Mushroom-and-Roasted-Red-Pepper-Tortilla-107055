This was just ok. I agree it needed more spices so I also added cayenne, paprika and a little lawry's salt. But mostly I was disappointed because the potatoes turn to mush so the whole thing just falls flat. It could probably use some crumbled sausage and maybe leeks but I don't think I care enough to try to re tool it.

This was really good, served cut up in squares as part of a tapas spread for a cocktail party. I doubled the red pepper, otherwise as written. I think the oil could be cut in half for the second stage, though.

This works really well made in advance to allow the flavors to blend and served at room temperature. Agree that spicing it up is good - I added chopped pickled garlic to the veg. But resist the urge to add herbs. Sprinkle with Spanish paprika instead. Turn onto a colorful plate (it's rather plain) and cut into wedges or small squares. For a quick side sauce, I thinned sour cream and added a bit of sherry vinegar and some paprika and cayenne. Not authentic but looked nice atop the tortilla wedges. Very satisfying (and filling) appetizer, starter, or brunch dish (with salad). Perfect for long cocktail hours.

I agree.... The potatoes should be 1/2 in. dice and less oil for the cooking of the tortilla. My additional advice is to make sure that you cook the veggies until they are rather dry before cooling them and adding the egg. Also, I will add extra red pepper and/or spices next time. Despite using a homemade jar of roasted red peppers which I thought were quite spicy (hot peppers and garlic had been added to the jar), the dish was rather bland. I think the potatoes counteract a lot of the spice, so I will remember to be heavy-handed with the spices next time. I think this would work well as a "make ahead" dish. You could make the veggie mixture up to a day in advance, then cook the "egg pie" right before the meal. Besides these comments, I think this is a very tasty, pretty tortilla and I will probably make it again.

I love roasted peppers, used my own and increased the amount to 1/2 cup. I did decrease the amount of oil to 4 TBS.and that worked out just fine. I love spice so I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the dish. My husband loved it! Will be a keeper recipe.

This was very good, but I will make two important changes when I make it again. First, cut the potatoes into slightly smaller dice (1/2" instead of 3/4"). Second, and most importantly, there is no need to use 1/4 cup of olive oil to fry the potato and egg mixture - 2 Tbsps. would be more than sufficient. Other than the excess oil I was draining and blotting off, this was a delicious brunch dish.
