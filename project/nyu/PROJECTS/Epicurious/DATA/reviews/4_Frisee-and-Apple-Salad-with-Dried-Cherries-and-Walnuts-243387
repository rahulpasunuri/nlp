I made this today with endive and it's delicious and will certainly make it again. I didn't have cherrys so I used cranberries and a Washington Delicious apple. I was also out of ACV so I used Raspberry flavored vinegar and it worked just fine. We had the salad with a beef stew from the crock pot. My grandson thought it was great so I know I'll be making it again soon and maybe have some cold roasted chicken on it for a light dinner.

Like other reviewers, I substituted cranberries for the cherries in this recipe, and "spring mix" salad greens for the frisee which I couldn't get. I also allowed the dressing to "sit" for several hours before assembling the salad. It worked out beautifully and we will now be making this salad (or at least the dressing) on a regular basis. Turkey or chicken would be an excellent addition to make it an "entree" salad.

I screwed up EVERYTHING at my dinner party last night--except for this exquisite salad. The trick is to use walnut oil instead of EVOO; it gives it a much more special flavor and really elevates what is a pretty common mix of ingredients to something very lovely.

Tried this when it was first published in the magazine and keep coming back for more. Really delicious and easy, everyone asks for the recipe. I generally make mine with a spring mix and either replace the dried cherries with dried cranberry or omit them. Highly recommended!

This salad was fantastic! It also went really well with the cider glazed lamb chops.

The salad itself is great, but (unless you love apple cider vinagerette) the dressing is somewhat lacking. I would make this recipe again, but use a different dressing next time.

This was delicious and very quick. I cut the recipe in half and used dried cranberries instead of cherries. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty and relatively easy recipe. I felt like it needed just a little something to better balance the tartness of the cherries and sweetness of the honey. Next time, I'll try to add a sprinkle of blue cheese.

This was a very yummy and easy salad. I would definitely make this again.

Possibly the best salad I've ever had. Easy to make, filling, and goes well with regular mixed greens, since frisee is hard to find. I've had this three times in the past two weeks and my boyfriend is asking that we make it again tomorrow night! Twice we've topped the salad with pre-made chicken and cilantro wontons from Costco and the combination is great. I think this salad would go well with many other proteins.

This is a delicious and versatile salad recipe. I have made it as is and also with dried cranberries instead of cherries, a pear instead of an apple as well as tossing some crumbled blue cheese on top.

I only made the vinaigrette from this recipe and it was great. I tossed it with spring mix greens, crumbled gorgonzola, dried cranberries and walnuts. I will definitely make this vinaigrette again.

Love the freshness of this recipe. I used a meculin mix and added endive. I also like to add a little grated orange peel to the dressing.

Really pleasant side to a Thanksgiving feast. Just the right level of sweet.

This is an excellent salad for Thanksgiving. It's so light, fresh and crisp. I did use arugula, as frisee is difficult to find here. It would also work with any sort of mesclun mix.

Excellent. I used red oak leaf lettuce, and quadrupled the recipe - delicious!

Very good. Have had this several times. Had a hard time finding frisee so just used some mixed greens that had some frisee.

Served this salad for a small dinner party and it was proclaimed "uptown." (In my family that means delicious.) I used a prepackaged salad of field greens and the salad was still well balanced.

This is my favorite salad. I like to add goat cheese, and it goes beautifully with chicken milanese. Tonight I'm serving it as the main course with roasted yukon gold potatoes. I can rarely find frisee, so I often use arugula instead. Delightful combination of flavors. Dried cranberries are a nice substitute for the cherries.

I used dried currents (happened to have them on hand) and spinach (couldn't find frisee at my grocery store). Turned out great, dressing is very tasty.

Excellent! Lovely combo -- added blue cheese to make it a meal. Yummy!

This is a super quick great salad that always gets rave reviews. Nice and tart, not too sweet even with the dried fruit.

Endive lettuce was the closest thing I could find to frisee and after tasting it I was worried it would be too bitter. But the sweetness of the apples, cherries and dressing really balance it nicely and the salad was fantastic.

FABULOUS!!!!!!

I made this salad for a Christmas Eve dinner and was very good! I used cherry flavored crasins, which were tasty, but think there was too much dressing. I think spinach would also be good in lieu of frisee. Next time will add blue or goat cheese for a change.

this is a great salad! i use dried cranberries too, i'm not really a cherries fan. real easy and big flavors. would be great as a main dish too with some grilled chicken

This is a great recipe for all salad lovers. I have served it many times at home and at other dinners where I had to bring the ingredients with me. The dressing is excellent with the mix of flavours. I must admit I did not use Frisee alone but added mixed baby greens, etc. This recipe is a keeper.

This is a great salad - I added crumbled blue cheese and it was delicious!

Had to sub leeks for shallots, pine nuts for walnuts, spinach for frisee, and still got an excellent salad! (Good apples are key.)

I made the recipe as stated with the addition of crumbled goat's cheese. It was wonderful... the guests loved it. I'll be making this again for sure. It was so quick and easy too!

Really delicious salad, made as written. Similar to apple, dried cherry, and walnut salad with maple dressing (BA Sep 2002), which is also fantastic.

Rating: 3
The only reason I don't give this 4 stars is I think I've made many other salads that are very similar. It's a formula that works: greens + fruit + dried fruit + nuts but this is a very nice, easy, version and I'm sure I will make it many more times. The dressing is also nice. Love the idea of adding some cheese.

Rating: 4
Marvelous salad - so easy and fresh. I crumbled some goat cheese on top for some more tang. There is enough substance in this salad that I served it as the main course for dinner. This will definitely become part of our repetoire.

Great-loved the dressing. Substituted almonds for the walnuts.

Excellent; even better than I expected. I used baby spring mix instead of frisee and added some cubed White English Coastal Cheddar from Trader Joes to make it a light main course lunch for two.

Great Salad!!! Added a little blue cheese and substituted dried cranberries for cherries. I didn't have any walnuts so I used toasted almonds. Will make this salad again and again!

Lovely salad. I could not find dried cherries so made the dressing without it and then tossed in some blueberries (not dried) in with the apple and it was great. I am also planning to try this using dried cranberries.
