good weeknight recipe, not bland at all like other reviewer said. Maybe the type of canned tomatoes makes a difference. Mine were slightly seasoned.

try adding a bit of sugar to balance out the acidity of canned tomatoes in this dish.

I made a casserole variation of this. I had a lot of roast chicken left over, so picked it off the bones. Used no tomatoes as someone told me unless you're a genius, it is hard to make tomatoes and red peppers good together, and we all love red peppers so didnt want to risk problems there. I put layers of the veggie mix, polenta, and chicken in a casserole, lots of red peppers on top with the parsley and thyme. Poured some thickened chicken broth over it, and put it in the oven for about a half hour so the flavours could all get into the polenta. It turned out quite well.

What is polenta roll???? Is it just cooked polenta? Or is it something else?

This was very bland. I even added red pepper flakes and cooked the polenta from scratch instead of using the pre-made rounds. It just did not have an interesting flavor. I would not make it again.

I thought this was a great recipe. I used a sun dried tomato polenta. It was easy and didn't require a lot of clean up. I will make this again!

I really liked this receipe, but would use more polenta! Of course, I added more garlic and drained and used the entire can of tomatoes.

I used polenta with Italian herbs (my grocery store did not have plain polenta) and the dish was still boring. The canned tomatoes, thrown in the last few minutes of cooking, overwhelmed the entire dish with acidity. Fresh tomatoes would have been better, and made the dish fresher tasting. It was decent, nothing spectacular.

Easy and delicious...a great recipe for those nights when you want something substantial but don't feel like working. And, best of all, there's only one skillet to clean!
