Very good--- mostly very pretty. No problem getting the cookies off of the pan. I let it cool completely and then lifted them right off the foil. I used creme savers-- not too bad, looking for a really nice hard candy in different colors/flavors

I made these cookies with my sons kindergarten class and the kids loved them. I gave each child a piece of parchment paper and a piece of the dough. The parchment paper made it easier to move the cookie to the baking sheet without losing the shape of the cookie or the candy middle. The kids also wrote their names on the parchment paper in pencil in the coner so we could identify the cookies later. I used a toaster oven to bake them and it was really simple.

I followed the recipe exactly but the dough was a little crumbly and difficult to work with. I am new to the cookie scene. Any suggestions?

These cookies are really pretty and my offical taster says they taste great. I cut them in stars and used red, blue and green Jolly Ranchers for the centers. I baked them on tin foil, as suggested by an earlier reviewer. It peeled of easily once the cookies had cooled

These cookies were beautiful to behold. Unfortunately, they tasted like the fruit-flavored candies I crushed to make the centers. They would perhaps have been better to use candies with more interesting flavors like cinnamon or mint.

These cookies came out so well, that I made them twice around the holidays. I used a large star and cut-out a smaller star in the center. I used crushed sour balls, high quality candy flavored as spearmint, lemon, cinnamin, grape and tangerine. The trick seems to be that the cookies must be very thin and you definitely need to use a silpat mat. The dough handles beautifully and I rolled it out on a silpat mat to avoid adding extra flour.

Considering the mixed reviews on this recipe, I was scared to try it at all. Luckily, my cookies came out beautiful! The dough isn't bland per se, it's meant to be mellow so as not to overpower the candy. I like these cookies very much, though my suggestion is to use citrus flavored sour balls or other candy, as it seems to taste the best. I also found that the purple candies I used did not look very pretty after they were baked, the color was a little muddy. My son thinks these cookies are fantastic fun to bake! I used foil and they came off fine once they were cool.

The cookies looked great, but the dough is bland. I used the dough from another recipe for the second batch and like the results better. I used parchment paper and didn't have a problem with the sticking.

fabulous and beautiful. Made them in star shape with smaller star cut out in the middle. My 8 year old loved crushing the candies and sprinkling into the middle. Made them for a few hholiday parties great reviews.

To avoid cookies sticking - put aluminum foil on our cookie sheets and bake, after you pull them out of the oven let them cool down, then just peel the cookies of the aluminum. Works like a charm.

Beautiful cookies. Mine stuck really badly. I did not have a baking mat. It must be essential for this recipe. I tried two different cookie sheets.

hi... I enjoyed making these, though it took a long time..Mainly the crushing of the candies. I used the Jolly Rancher hard candy, and they turned out really well. I used a hammer, tho...maybe that is why I had to go through so many plastic bags? anyway...I did enjoy them!! Thank whomever for including these! Carol

Used Jolly Ranchers of various flavours. Excellent cookie dough, but a little too firm after refrigerating for 2 hours (maybe just me). Used a standard air-insulated baking sheet with no problems whatsoever (the candy residue cleans off with hot soapy water). This basic recipe could easily be used for thumbprint cookies with various jams. Turned out very beautifully.

This sounded so promising. Only three on the cookie tray turned out. Problems with the candy sticking. It was a great dough, and I will use that recipe again. The ones that did turn out were impressive looking, but the kids really didn't like the flavour/texture of the centers (used lifesavers). Because of the lack of "wow" in flavour, I think I'll save this recipe for decorations.

My daughter and I are novice bakers so we had a lot of trouble with the silicone baking sheet. The one I bought was too big for my pans. So instead of cutting it up, which is what I should have done to begin with, I read on the package that you could just use it directly on your oven rack. DON'T DO IT! The filling burns and smokes. Ultimately, when we finally ended up with some pretty cookies, we decided that that was all they were. The hard candy with the wierd flavors like green apple was not a good combination with a cookie crust?!

Very good recipe! I used Jolly Ranchers and used a meat tenderizer mallet to smash them. I didn't use a teardrop cutter. Just used a scalloped round cutter and then smaller shapes for the centers. I used a small square cutter and chopped out four panes and filled the holes with four different colors. Looks like a window! Awesome.

I am not a cookie expert, and these turned out beautifully. They taste great too. I found a cookie cutter that cut both the cookie and a center design at one time. I bought Life Savers in a large bag and found they were individually wrapped--this turned out to be a great benefit, as one whack with a mallet crushed the candy, then you cut open the little bag and poured right into the cookie.

I loved this recipe. First of all, thhe sugar cookie recipe is delicious even without the candy. This will defintely become my staple sugar cookie recipe. Adding the "stained glass" effect is fun and gives it a great look and delish flavor too! Try cherry jolly ranchers! We also crushed a blue "gourmet" lollipop which was great too!

Best sugar cookies I've had so far. I made this with jolly ranchers and it worked pretty well. (Couldn't find sourballs anywhere) The cookie itself is very yummy, but to have candy in the middle makes it superb. I found though that I didn't have to chill it for 2 hours.
