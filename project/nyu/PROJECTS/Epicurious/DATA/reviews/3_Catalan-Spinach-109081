A great side dish to roasted chicken. Made 1/2 the recipe in one skillet - apples sauteed for 10 minutes, then added raisins and shallots until golden, tossed in finely chopped garlic just before the spinach. Very easy, fresh and tasty!

This is a new favorite of mine, with some changes to the recipe. I used 2 Fuji apples and just 2 9-ounce packages of spinach rather than 3. I used Craisins, probably not a whole cup, and followed others' advice for putting in the pine nuts after the shallots and Craisins. Easy, pretty, healthy and delicious.

Everyone loved this ( i was scared given some of the reviews so i only made a small amount). I doubled the apples and left out the raisins because I didn't have any. Just realized i forgot the pine nuts too. It is important to take it off the fire as soon as spinach starts to wilt.

Yum! I thought this was wonderful, and I really liked all of the flavors together. I used fresh organic baby spinach and it was delicious.

This was ok but not great. I used fuji apples instead of golden delicious and omitted the raisins. I wouldn't put the pine nuts so early on in the cooking - they became soft and it was just a waste. I would sprinkle them on right before serving.

Have visited Spain several times, and never seen the apples with the spinach before. The combo didn't work.

I have not made this recipe, but I have family from Spain, and they taught me to make a very similar dish, it has no apples, but It has about 3 to 4 garlic cloves, it is full of garlic flavor

There was nothing wrong with it, but I didn't think it was anything special.

I was so anxious to try this recipe that I tried it out for the first time last night for a dinner party. There is no compelling reason to ever make this again. It was alright (flavor was bland but okay, it looked pretty enough on the plate), but there are so many better vegetable recipes out there that require no last minute effort. I won't make this again.

Mmmm. I've made this recipe 4 times now. The only change I have made is to add the shallots when the apples are about halfway done. It's just personal preference. Other than that, my suggestions are: (1) don't use frozen spinach, (2) don't skip the raisins even if you think you won't like them, (3) let the apples get thoroughly browned before adding the spinach, and (4) just let the spinach barely wilt and serve immediately. I've had the best success with baby spinach.

I was not a big fan of this dish. The tastes didn't mesh together well and thought the apple, raisin, and pine nut part were good, mixed with the spinach, it wasn't.

excellent. i only had golden raisins or craisins, and opting for more color, i used the craisins since there was already so much gold already. my family is not a big spinach fan, but we all thought this was good. the finished product was more cooked than wilted, unfortunately, otherwise this would have been a really big hit. will make again, probably using the craisins because i really liked the flavor, and i'll just be more careful to get the pot off the heat before the leaves get beyond the wilt stage.
