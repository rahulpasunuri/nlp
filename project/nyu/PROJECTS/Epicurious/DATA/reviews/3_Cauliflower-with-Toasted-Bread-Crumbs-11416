Not worth the small effort. The vinegar was the only flavor evident, even overpoweing the carmelized onion. Not even a good does of salt helped.

I sauteed chopped mushrooms (that had to be used) with the onions. This was even better cold the next day.(just ask my husband) The amount of liquid was correct. I did not use any cheese.

I used extra virgin olive oil to toast my crumbs, and to saute the vegetables.Carmelization of the onions, and browning of the cauliflower is important for flavor.I mixed some of the crumbs into the dish with about 3tbs. chopped italian parsley, kosher salt,and freshly ground pepper. delicious.

I found this recipe to be bland (not that cauliflower is that flavorful to begin with). I ended up adding lemon juice and extra garlic and onion powder to try to jazz it up a bit; it also needed quite a bit of salt, which I try to avoid. A light sprinkling of parmesian also helped.

This is just great. Made it twice in as many days. Browning the onions is important. I added 2 large minced garlic cloves when the onions were about 3/4 browned. I used chicken stock instead of water.

I didn't like that the onions totally overpowered the cauliflower, but I tend to prefer seasonings (in this case the onions) that ENHANCE a food rather than seasonings that MASK the food.

Very very good--I used Japanese bread crumbs instead of regular, beef broth instead of water, salt and pepper liberally, and two sliced garlic cloves added with the onions, which I carmelized very well. After the dish was done, I spread in a small gratin dish and baked with another layer of breadcrumbs on top. A mellow, creamy, tasty sidedish I will make again, perhaps for a holiday or family dinner.

This was an easy & interesting twist for cauliflower. I normally steam, add butter and once melted sprinkle with breadcrumbs. The balsamic & onions add the twist. I landed up making a whole head of cauliflower & doubled the recipe. I was concerned about the amount of water that was still in the pan. It finally landed up evaporating towards the end of the cooking time. I cooked it for a bit longer uncovered at the end. I was afraid there was too much liquid for the bread crumbs and they would be soggy. I left a little liquid & this seemed to work perfect. I will make this again.

I thought it was quite good, and easy, I might try a little more balsamic vinager to give it more zip next time. Just not special enough for me to give it 3 forks.

Finished product was absolutely delicious. I made it in the a.m. and wasn't terribly impressed with the looks of the resulting dish. In p.m., reheated in oven and served alongside recipe "Penne with Asparagus". The combo was a hit. Guest who isn't fond of cauliflower raved about this recipe. Combination of balsamic vinegar and onions was wonderful. I'll be making this dish again.
