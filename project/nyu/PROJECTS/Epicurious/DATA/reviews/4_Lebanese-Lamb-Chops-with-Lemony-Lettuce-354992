Love this recipe! I marinated the lamb chops 1st with vinegar,olive oil and chicken bouillon overnight.I'm originally from Lebanon, and I learned to do this as it tenderize the lamb&makes it really tasty. Before cooking, I followed the recipe but I added lemon fresh squeezed with the garlic,oil,salt,and 7 spice and I marinated it for a couple of hrs.

This was delicious! Went great with the cucumber and mint recipe as other reviewers suggested! Will definitely be making both again.

Wasn't such a fan of the individual parts - but it came together beautifully. Amazing range of flavors. Will be making this again and again.......yum!

This is definitely a keeper, it was delicious! Easy & quick to make, too. Didn't have thespecial pepper & it was still amazing. I also made some tzatziki as a side.

Loved this lamb recipe, very easy and quick. I made both the salad from this recipe and the watermelon cucumber recipe as another reviewer recommended, the tzadziki sauce was a great accompaniment to the lamb, as was the watermelon. While I liked the salad, I liked the watermelon better, so if I was short on time and had to pick, I may do just the watermelon next time. We'll definitely be keeping this lamb recipe, though!

fabulous flavor and little effort. i mixed my own spices because i didn't find it pre-mixed and the lemon segements in the salad are really stunning with those spice flavors! served with the watermelon and cucumber salad from the same issue to make a perfect hot summer day's dinner.

Excellent flavour, and the best part is that the kids wanted seconds. Found I didn't have lettuce!! And served it with pan drippings, roasted baby yukon gold potatoes and minted peas.

My kind of recipe, big flavor with little effort. I did find the dressing for the lettuce needed the acidity from the lemon juice created by cutting the segments.
