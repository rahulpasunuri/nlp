Cake is nice but bland and not sweet. Next time I think I'll use a sprinkle of the rum on the cake before rolling. I used Capt. Morgan in the filling. It was easy to make.

This was a terrible recipe. The cake and filling were bland. I even added honey to the whipped cream to flavor it a bit and nothing helped. We tried one slice and threw the rest in the trash. Definitely would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

Very good and pretty. Be careful not to overbake the cake. I think I did very slightly, and it cracked a bit when I unrolled it to put in the filling because it was slightly overbaked. Still gorgeous though (the whipped cream covers a multitude of sins!) and tasted great. Make sure the filling is well cooled or even chilled before you spread it on the cake.
