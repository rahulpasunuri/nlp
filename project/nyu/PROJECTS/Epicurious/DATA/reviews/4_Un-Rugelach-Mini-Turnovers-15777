4 for taste. 2 for difficulty in preparation. 3 fork average. We used the cookie scoop as described. It only made 11 of these. 1/2 T of preserves oozed out of every one. They were really delicious, but my husband, who did most of the work on these was really frustrated with this recipe by the end. If we make them again, I'll try rolling the dough into a single sheet and using a cookie cutter to cut them out. I'd also be game to try mixing the preserves & the nuts as another reviewer did. That sounds like it would be an easier/cleaner way to go with less of a chance of oozing onto the sheet and into the oven.

Fabulous! These got snatched right up at my caroling party. The dough works well for rolling and has cool pastry texture once cooked. Just used a few different varieties of jam for the filling which was easy and still tasty. Also just cooled all the dough at once, rolled it out like sugar cookies and cut in circles with a cup and then filled and folded circle in half. Pressed together with fork and sprinkled with vanilla sugar.

Forgot to mention: I also substituted coarsely chopped dried apricots for raisins, because I'm not that crazy about raisins.

With substantial modifications- I accidentally mixed in the apricot preserves with the nut mixture, but that worked really well & eliminated a step. #2: I added vanilla & about 1/4 c. lemon juice to nut mixture, along w/ a pinch each of fresh-ground cumin & cardamom. #3: Easier than the method described for making the dough discs: Tortilla press. #4: Extra decadent if brush with butter rather than milk. These were SO amazingly good.

It's been a while, but to the cook from Nantucket and anyone else who is confused: These are called "unrolled" because each little piece of cookie dough isn't spread with filling and rolled up like a mini crescent jelly roll, as are traditional rugelach. The rolling isn't referring to using a rolling pin, it's referring to what usually happens to rugelach after the dough is flattened out.

I LOVE this recipe. While a bit labor-intensive, it's worth it. My only extra hint would be to make sure you seal each turnover well, because I had some seams come apart during baking which made the apricot filling ooze out and burn to the cookie sheet. Still tasty though!

The author calls these "UN" because she says that rugelach means "rolled" and these are NOT rolled. However, when you read the recipe, it DOES call for rolling the dough, so I just don't get the whole thing! Actually, this recipe seems even more complicated and time-consuming than the typical rugelach recipe.
