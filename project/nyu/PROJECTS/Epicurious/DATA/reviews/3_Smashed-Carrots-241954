My vegetarian husband loves these carrots. He actually asked that I make them again after the first time -- which is a rarity. My only comment is that I'm not sure what a 1-inch round is -- I mean carrots come in all different diameters so what are you supposed to about that? What is a 1-inch round??? Well, anyway, I cut them up however suited me and let them cook for at least 40 minutes instead of 20.

We made about 2/3 of this recipe, using fresh carrots. They boiled 25+ minutes, and were still hard to smash, and there was a lot of liquid left. The taste was all right, but not good enough to fulfill my carrot cravings. Went all right with the leftover meatloaf & mashed potatoes we had, tho!
