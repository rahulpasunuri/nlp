The shortcakes are amazing: chocolaty and soft. The whipped cream got raves. In fact, someone just e-mailed me to ask for the recipe. I didn't follow the strawberry recipe, so my rating isn't based on that. Any strawberry recipe should work.

I've made this for two dinner parties and loved it. Follow the recipe and all flavors work together perfectly. The slightly dry - think scone - shortcakes soak up the strawberry juices. Just make sure you don't pat the dough too flat. Makes a great presentation when not cut open.

End result was good. Guests loved it. I found the cake to be a bit dry. I am also a big fan of whipped cream so I think I would leave out the sour cream next time.

The whipped cream in this recipe is absolutely amazing--best I have ever had. The strawberry, orange, grand marnier mixture was loved by all. The chocolate biscuit/cake was a real let down--dry, chalky, and nearly tasteless. It wounded the otherwise perfect dessert.

The whipcream here is soooo good. The marinade is also wonderful, but I cut way back on the sugar, using only one tablespoon. The chocolate shortcakes were a disappointment for me, but not for my boyfriend or our guests. I thought they were dry (although they were taken out of the oven before the fork came clean), and didn't crumble like a shortcake biscuit. But they were fudgy and not too sweet. I would use this recipe again, but with another shortcake. They looked beautiful--v. impressive. I split down the middle.

I only made the cake part following the recipe and it was easy and delicious. Served it with ice cream.

The whipcream (using sour cream) is DIVINE in this recipe; and the dish is gorgeous in its presentation. I made this instead of a birthday cake for my boyfriend's birthday--super. Use 1 big basket of strawberries. Make sure dough stays cold. It only took 10 minutes in my oven to bake shortcakes; perhaps even a bit less.

I found this recipe quite good for a quick dessert. This is not your traditional strawberry shortcake, but I found that refreshing. I am really tired of the overly sweetened strawberries, and sticky store bought cake with Cool Whip that is the usual fare. This is more of a mature, adult strawberry shortcake. The chocolate biscuit is very dense and chocolaty- I recommend serving it split in half with the strawberry juice and cream inside. My biscuit was a bit too dense and dry (but that could have been my fault.) Cutting it could remedy that. I did not use the Grand Marnier, but used some lemon zest instead- and it gave it a good kick, I also added a little extra sugar to the strawberries to please the kids eating with us. But the marinade was FANTASTIC. The sour cream whip was great too. It was not overly sweet, and was the perfect tarty compliment to the sweet berries and deep chocolaty biscuit. This was not the perfect dessert, but it was perfect as it took me no longer than 25 minutes- and everyone raved over it! I will make it again for sure.

Awkward results. Not sure if I might have accidentally overkneaded the dough but it was so sticky and I could barely get it into a ball form without dusting on extra flour. The sourcream/whipping cream was pretty gross. Strawberries tasted good. Shortcake came out like a dense cake or brownie-type. Would not make again.

First, I must say that I only made the chocolate shortcakes. (I just cut up some strawberries, mixed with a touch of sugar and a touch of amaretto for the topping) My shortcakes were pretty good - not out of this world but very edible. They ended up looking like big, cakey cookies rather than biscuits. On the plus side, these were very, very easy to make and used very few ingredients. Next time I want something like this I'll probably look around for a different recipe.

I was rather dissapointed. The cake part was good but got hard fast. The sour cream was unecassary as it didnt go well with sauce. A sweetened whip would go better with it. Big presentation but wouldnt make again.

For a strawberry shortcake tradionalist I approached this recipe with caution. A big hit. I made the biscuits the night before before a July 4th sailing trip. Just cut up the strawberries and added sugarand let me sit about 2hours. Served with hand whipped cream. A big hit with the crew

Well, i might have done something wrong, but my shortcakes were very chalky i thing other then that, it was super. I recommend adding a cool stye to this dish like... i cut it in the middle and then put small slivers of strawberries in the middle of the cake.

Delicious! I found some fabulous fresh strawberries from a local grower. The first day I served this with the maranade & sour cream/fresh cream mixture. The flavors overpowered the wonderful strawberries. Next day I served the left over cakes with plain berries and whipped cream - much better. Maybe the maranade would be good with berries that need a little help.

Excellent use for strawberries. Family loved it. Very chocolatey.

I wanted to make a lower-fat shortcake, so I used lowfat buttermilk (3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons) for the whipped cream. The dough was a little wet - I think I would use a tablespoon less of the buttermilk next time - but the biscuits were delicious!! A great summer recipe.

What a great recipe. Fairly simple; can be made one step at a time. I would highly recommend making the chocolate biscuits. They are so delicious a substitute would unlikely be as good. I also shaved some baking chocolate over the finished dish and garnished with mint leaves. It looks and tastes fantastic.

The "marinade" recipe for the strawberries is really good, especially the orange zest. Did not make the shortcakes, just put the strawberries over angel food cake.
