This is such a fresh tasting salad. I use it for dinner parties when I have a mix of vegetarians and meat lovers, and let everybody customize their salad (or taco). I add grilled chicken marinated fajita style as one of the topping options. Makes for a festive evening.

Nix the radishes, add some grilled or baked chicken. Best weekday dinner salad ever created, and you'll find most of the ingredients in the produce section. Very healthy!

A wonderful salad and so adaptable. I feel the black beans are a key ingredient, but have used cucumber, red onion as additions when I didn't have radishes or jicama. The dressing is a keeper!

Very nice and pretty. Only used half of the beans/ replaced mango for tomato and no corn or cheese. For dressing put all ingredients in mini food processor and de-seeded jalapeno + doubled honey

Yikes - never substitute a 'canned' jalapeno for fresh - they are different foods - canned is pickled. For less heat, use less of the fresh jalapeno. End of story . . . I like this dressing on fresh verdolaga or in the American stores and cracks in the sidewalk - purslane or pigweed. Very high in Omega 3.

This salad is fantastic! I omit the radish, tomato and feta but add mango or pineapple. I also added grilled shrimp marinated in EVOO, cumin and jalapeño (taken from another salad recipe from this site) and it was so delicious! My favorite thing is that the presentation is as good as the flavor. The salad is gorgeous with all of the colors.

I did not make the salad, so am not rating the full receipe - but would give a solid 4 forks for the dressing, which I used on an orange/spinach salad from this site and the dressing especially got rave reviews at a potluck barbeque. I followed the dressing receipe to the letter - but might add a bit more fresh jalapeno next time (or perhaps it was a mild jalapeno).

This salad dressing is amazing! We added a bit more cilantro because we love it, plus salt and pepper to balance it...just so fresh and lovely. Had this salad two nights in a row because it was so good. Served it with a roasted chicken for a lovely meal.

I deboned a rotisserie chicken, chopped the meat, and added to the salad. I was unable to find jicama, but the salad was a huge hit. Great summertime main dish salad. Enjoyed the mix of flavors.

This salad is fabulous. It got rave reviews when I served it on Cinco de Mayo. I used fresh white corn cut off the cob and used English cucumber instead of jicama. Other than that, I followed it exactly. I doubled it and also doubled the dressing...would only make 1 1/2 times the dressing next time. Tossed together at the last minute. Great recipe!

Excellent salad, I think this would be a great side dish for a summer barbecue or picnic. I don't do reduced fat cheeses so used my favorite sheeps milk feta from TJ's and I have had bad experiences with raw garlic so I cut it in half. Other than that, made exactly as called for and it turned out great. I also used the canned jalapenos in order to keep the heat down, but think it would be better with a bit more kick, so I'll try fresh next time.

I love this salad! I usually add shredded rotisserie chicken to turn it into a nice summertime meal. I also add mango instead of jicama. I'm not a huge fan of radishes, so I usually omit this too. The dressing is perfect just the way it is!

I thought I could make a phenomenal salad with this recipe and I couldn't. The mixture of textures did nothing for the salad whatsoever. The end result was slimy, with a weird combo of flavors that just didn't work for me or any of my guests. I would recommend leaving out the jicama for sure. It was awful in here. The dressing was so sweet that it really did nothing to enhance an already bad salad. I definitely wouldn't make this again.

Like so many before me, this salad earns 4 forks. Had to tweak it a little bit as I couldn't find jicama and there was a garlic allergy in our group. English cucumbers were a substitute for the jicama along with a little red onion in the salad and grated fresh ginger in the dressing for flavor. The true magic of this recipe is you can modify for your taste buds and still come out with a unique and tasty salad.

I had a mix green salad, but didn't have any dressing. So tried this, since it looked easy. Followed it to the T, as I was listening to Mary J Blige and was already slightly distracted. Delicious, tasty! I added diced Fuji apples and some salt and pepper to taste. Only change I would make is what others suggested: to double the garlic. And this dressing could get away with less honey, especially when adding fruits like apples.

Great salad! Hearty enough to be a dinner salad, since it has both avocado and feta, but i served it with a chile bisque from Mark Bittman.The only change I added was to slightly increase the garlic and jalapeno in the dressing, as well as adding some salt. But otherwise, this is an easy go-to - definitely double the dressing so you can have salad for a few days!

Tasty and easy to make! Went full fat on the feta cheese, of course. And used the whole avocado because it tastes good. Kids would have liked some grilled chicken tossed in. Or some tasty cow.

Fantastic. Would make again. It is even great without the romaine ( we didn't think the romaine added that much)

I make this all the time. You can vary the ingredients somewhat, although the corn and beans are a must. It's the dressing that makes it special! I live in Italy so fresh corn is not available, but one brand of the canned corn contains kidney beans and it is quite crisp. I make the salad, toss it, then as a main course lay a fillet of grilled or broiled salmon or barbecued (dry rub) chicken cutlets on top of each serving.

Rating: 4
I made this to accompany shrimp tacos and it was a big hit. The only changes I would suggest are to increase the amount of jalapeno in the dressing. I used 1 whole fresh jalapeno (seeded) and added a bit of salt and pepper. I would also not make it unless the corn is fresh off the cob- canned or frozen would not do the recipe justice.

My husband is a meat and potato guy but loved this salad, asked for a second helping. Recommend using fresh uncooked corn kernels and prepare the dressing a few hours ahead of time to let the flavors blend.

Of all the things I cook, this may be the most popular. I have never served it without being asked for the recipe. The only changes I make are to omit the radishes and tomatoes because I don't like them, and to crumble some Tostitos multigrain chips on top to act as "croutons." One of the best recipes I've ever found on this Web site.

This was a wonderful salad and I look forward to the next time I make it. I added red onions to this recipe, although the radishes and jicama contributed a zesty bite to the dish. I added extra garlic to the dressing, and will double the dressing ingredients next time because I felt it wasn't quite enough to dress the whole salad. Plus the leftovers are great!

This was a great salad and the dressing was delicious. I don't love cilantro so I used parley instead, and added a pinch of chili powder and cumin to the dressing because I did not have a jalapeno on hand. Good salad with any mexican/latin american/southwest-inspired meal.

This recipe is an excellent summer dish. The flavors are so fresh and crisp. I added orange and yellow peppers because I had them, the colors added a festive look.

I've made this recipe twice with a few adjustments according to ingredients I had on hand: I added shredded carrot and sliced red onion and left out jicama, corn and radishes (didn't have them in the fridge). One time I substituted monterey jack cheese for the feta with great results. The salad was so great and even with the swap was delicious. Will definitely make again for a meatless meal!

Great salad. I didnt have the avocado or jicama to add but it was still awesome.

Rating: 4
This was great! The prior reviewer who said the dressing should have salt and pepper is right, but just a little is fine. I used queso fresco instead of feta and serrano pepper instead of jalapeno, both of which I think are likely improvements if they are easily available to you. There was strangely no cilantro at the Whole Foods (in Los Angeles!), so I put a pinch of dried coriander in the dressing--still great. Increased the cheese a bit, and almost doubled the avocado. It's still perfectly healthy that way if you eat a bigger portion of this as your entire dinner.

I was looking for ways to use everything in my pantry and I found this dressing recipe to put on my bean, quinoa salad (didn't have hardly any of the ingredients for THIS salad). But I love this dressing! It's so fresh and lively. I will definitely make again and try this salad as well!

I have made this salad several times. I just made it for a group of girls tonight. I added some roasted chicken so it could be the main course. I did add some orange and yellow peppers to add more color. The dressing needs some salt and pepper added to it. I may add some mustard and sugar and see what happens. Everytime I make it, everyone asks for the recipe!

This recipe sounds good but the end result is just fantastic. I served it as a main course and it was very satisfying - it really doesn't need meat to make it a main. The dressing is amazing. I had a bit leftover so a few nights later I added a bit of sour cream and mayo to it and this creamy version was great too.

I thought this was a refreshing salad. I loved the combination of vegetables. I roasted the corn on the cob before cutting it off. I served it with some grilled marinated chicken and steak for a main course. I would make 1/3 less dressing next time, as there was way too much, though I guess you could save it for another day.

I made this refreshing salad tonight as a main dish and served it with some blue corn chips on the side. All of the ingredients melded together very well and the dressing was delicious. This has a perfect balance of flavors. The only suggestions I can make are to 1) make sure everything is chopped up pretty small-this will make sure all flavors are evenly distributed and 2) add a bit of extra honey to the dressing if you feel it is too "limey." Overall, this is a fantastic recipe that I will be making again!

This s a kick-ass salad full of flavor and texture. It is not a recipe for those with sheltered palates. The dressing is wonderful on many variations of salad. I use fresh lime from my trees and fresh lettuce and veggies from my garden to hit it out of the park. Also occasionally add olives and use roasted pepper instead of fresh for a deeper, smokey dimension over the bright, raw pepper flavor.

Outstanding recipe! Everyone raved over it and I had leftovers for days that were as light and delicious as the first time it was served. The only small changes I made were substituting carrots for radishes for the crunch without that radish-y taste (that I don't love), and adding a bit of grilled chicken to make it a main dish (which it doesn't necessarily need to be a main dish - it's that hearty and filling). I will make this again and again and again!

I made this to accompany fish tacos, and it was the perfect side dish. We have some picky eaters at my house, so I eliminated the corn and the radishes. Also, I didn't have jalapeno on hand, so I used about a 1/4 tsp Cayenne in the dressing. Otherwise I followed directions. Good flavors in the dressing - but it wanted a little "oomph," I couldn't put my finger on what was missing. Still, I will make this again. It really is a great hearty and healthy side dish for Mexican food - or could stand alone with the addition of grilled chicken, steak or fish.

i was really disappointed in this recipe. i made it exactly as written. i found it too sweet and too limey. also, i generally never use olive oil in salad dressings as it is very heavy and pungent - and it was here, too. for me the dressing was the main problem, but the salad ingredients just didn't seem to jive either. also, i was excited to try jicama - i won't be buying it again!

Wow! Fabulous! I hate radishes, husband and I are bored with jicama, but I decided to make the recipe exactly as written and it was fabulous. I served it with fish tacos. I am going to serve this again and again. It is so complex that it could be served with just grilled skirt or flank steak and it would be plenty of flavors. There would be little lost if you added or eliminated various ingredients. This would be great for a picnic if you add the avocado and pre made dressing at the last minute. Wonderful flavors that would blend well with other dishes or stand on it's own, healthy, low carb, low fat, low calorie - what more could you want.

Warning: I didn't make this salad exactly according to recipe. But, I want to rate and review it, because it's a great salad even in concept. We loved the crunchy and chewy textures and the variety of flavor. We also loved the tangy dressing. I made the dressing to taste rather than measuring ingredients exactly. Next time, I'd probably add some pepitos. We will definitely make this one again.

Made this last night to bring to a dinner party and it was a BIG hit. I followed the recipe as written, but used grape tomatoes cut in half, and left out the radishes. I doubled the dressing, but didn't need it all. Next time I'd add extra jicama and more avocado. I'd also add the olive oil to the lime juice slowly while whisking to emulsify. It makes a big salad, and I thought I'd have some left over for lunch today, but everyone ate it all!

A good weeknight find. We added more garlic for extra health benefits.

There was no jicama in my suermarket so I did without it and it was fine, alhtough next time I will look for jicama again.

Fabulous summer salad! For company, I double the recipe (and add twice the avocado and feta suggested) - and wait until the last minute before tossing half over the chopped romaine. (Otherwise the romaine wilts in the dressing) The remainder I store in the fridge sans romaine for a delicious salad during the week. Everyone raves about it - the honey lime viniagrette is fantastic.

Yum! I left out the feta (not a big feta fan) it was delicious, I have made this several times now. The first time I made it, I made it for our experienced gourmet friends, they loved it so much they took the recipe and made it for themselves the next day. If you have any leftover, which I doubt, remove the avacado, they turn to mush the next day.

Great salad - the dressing really has a nice fresh flavor and a kick. I used queso fresco instead of feta (similar in texture and flavor) and top with fresh pico de gallo instead of just tomato. Great side for cilantro lime fajita s!

Instead of Feta, use pepper jack, it would add some spiceness and be more mexican.

I made this for a mexican themed party as a side to tacos. Everyone raved about it!! I left off the radishes and used mexican white cheese instead of feta. It was incredible!!

Did not make the salad, just the dressing. I was the only one who liked it. It seemed as though the flavors did not blend well and the olive oil in the dressing congealed when in the refrigerator. What did I do wrong? I will try to use it as a marinade for chicken and see if I like it any better.

We made this salad as part of a buffet after my son's christening last summer. People loved and remembered it so much that I am getting requests for this recipe now (a year later). Great summer salad. It tastes great and is healthy ... big bonus!

I made this for a dinner party last night, all of my guests requested the recipe. We had chicken fajitas and some people put the salad in the wrap with the chicken rather than the traditional extras!

Very popular with everyone on Cinco de Mayo. I omitted the radishes and used Mexican queso fresco cheese rather than feta (less salty).

Excellent! I couldn't find a jicama, and avocados were out of season, but the salad was wonderful without them. I made it to go with chicken fajitas, so when I took the leftovers to work the next day, I threw the chicken and grilled peppers on the salad. It made my coworkers green with envy. Yum.

The main salad ingredient were O.K. but a little bland but we did not think the dressing added anything to this salad. There are much better Mexican salads out there.

I made this for guests and it was the only salad I have ever made that was totally gone at the end of the evening. I served it to 5 people and could have used more. I couldnt get jicama so put in slivered water chestnuts and it worked. With or without it is a great combination of textures and flavors.

This was a good pairing with a big pot of Tortilla Soup after a football game on a chilly afternoon. I doubled the recipe as we had 12 guests but there was plenty left over even after almost everyone had a healthy serving. I will definitely serve it again.

This salad is absolutely amazing! Perfect for a no-cook, light summer meal.

First of all the dressing is awesome and so simple I use it all the time now. Second the salad is extremely filling and flavorful, so much that my father and brother had no problem eating a salad for a meal. And finally, the suggestion in another review to use the leftovers for a chip dip was genius. There are so many chopped elements to this salad that there is always some left in the bowl despite my efforts to load up each plate, and it is tasty!!!

I added a 3-1 ration of lime juice (will add the zest nest time) to olive oil, added seasalt and some blk pepper, substituted shrimp for beans (cold/hot contrast), dried garlic (re: garlic/oil and botulism) and probably 3 tbl of honey... very similar to a ginger/lime marinade i make... it was delicious!!!

This was a great dish for a hot day when I didn't feel like cooking much. I added cumin and used a whole avocado instead of half. My boyfriend loved it too. We took it to work for lunch the next day, and it was even better. The only thing I will change next time I make it, is to eliminate the honey. We are not huge honey-dressing fans. I served it with a spicy cheddar cheese quesadilla. The cheese was so spicy that the salad was the perfect complement.

Rating: 4
I love this salad. I make quite often, especially for group events (dinner or lunch). The salad plus the dressing is phenomenal, and I always get raves for bringing something fabulous + outside the normal salad scope. To keep things fresh, I keep the lettuce seperate from the dressing and the toppings until right before serving. The bottom of the salad tends to get pretty drippy. Its fabulous, especially with chips.

Rating the dressing moreso than the salad. The joy of salads is how open they are to interpretation - have used this dressing often on a salad of chopped romaine, grape tomatoes, red onion, diced avocado, pitted Kalamata olives, and crumbled Stilton.

I have made this salad a number of times and I love it. Before tomatoes came in season I used Muir Glen canned diced tomatoes, they are a good sub. I agree with more jalapeño in the dressing.

While I wouldn't call this recipe quick as far as salads go, it was very, very good and we felt virtuous while eating it. The only change we made was to use a whole avocado and to omit the romaine-we needed it to be good for two days and didn't think the romaine would last. Excellent! WIll add more jalapeno next time as it wasn't spicy.

Rating: 3
This is a beautiful salad, especially when mixed w/ the dressing at the last minute (gets soggy if you mix ahead). The ruffly chopped romaine looks so pretty among all the colorful veggies! Make the dressing a few hours ahead to give the flavors time to develop, but dress just before serving. At the picnic I took this to, people scooped it up w/ tortilla chips--very yummy. Also tasty w/ crumbled tortilla chips on top. Didn't have radishes, but added finely chopped purple onion.

Rating: 3
I forgot to add the avacado and couldn't find jicima. I thought the salad was teriffic. I would add more jalapeno's to the dressing next time. I thought that it needed more heat to off set the sweetness from the honey. Next time I will add grilled chicken.

The dressing is delicious and goes surprisingly well with the ingredients of the salad! For picky eaters, set all the ingredients out in separate areas of a nice platter with dressing on the side and serve with grilled chicken. Yum!

This was pretty good, but it was the one dish that had leftovers at the end of the party. There was a little too much feta for my taste.

This was a big hit. I omitted the radishes and used red leaf lettuce and grape tomatoes (unseeded). I also "spiced" up the dressing a bit.

I'm not sure what people are fussing about, in terms of "all that chopping". Call me crazy, but I don't find chopping all that tedious or difficult or time-consuming, especially if it's a dish that I like! I'm crazy for this salad, and think it's the perfect light accompaniment to a burritto or a couple of fish tacos. My grocery rarely stocks jicama, so to get that crunch and hint of sweetness I chop up some Granny Smith apple. I always add a little chopped Vidalia onion and to keep it lighter, I make the choice BETWEEN avocado and cheese, and don't use both unless the salad is my main course. I agree that the dressing needs a bit of zip, so I add some Shichimi Togarashi (a Japanese red pepper spice mix).

Rating: 3
This is really good - a bit time consuming for a casual salad, since it requires a fair amount of washing, rinsing, drying, and chopping, but it's certainly easy. It would be great party fare. I decided to add some broken tortilla chips to the salad and they punched it up nicely - will def. keep that as part of the recipe.

I was suprised to find this rather bland. I might try making it again but adding a few ingredients to jazz up the taste, such as a dash of chili in the dressing.

This is the first time I felt compelled to write a review...what a wonderful summer-y salad- very fresh, crisp and light. We've made it several times now, and once you get used to the ingredients, it really doesn't take all that long to chop and prepare. I liked it without the feta better- this is a light, fresh, crispy salad, and the feta kind of takes it in a different, richer direction. So, unless you love feta, you won't miss it. Definitely don't skip out on the jicama and fresh corn though- they provide a nice crunchy contrast to the softer black beans and avocado. I didn't get around to putting radish in, and didn't miss it. Like other reviewers, my husband also licked the spoon and bowl clean!...FYI, you will need about 2 average-sized limes to yield the 1/4 cup fresh lime juice. Enjoy!

Colorful, crunchy and filling. I kept the salad and dressing separate until serving, and served the feta along side to accommodate kids and less adventuresome eaters. I seeded the jalapeno, but will include some seeds the next time for a little more heat. A tasty, pretty, healthy salad!

Rating: 4
YUM! I made this for a potluck, and a double recipe was gone in no time! My limes must have been strong, because I only needed a little more than half of the lime juice and then I only used about half of the dressing anyway. It would have been sopping otherwise, and I'm firmly against sopping. I forgot the peppers, even though I had them, and didn't use the radish b/c of all you picky anti-radish people. =) This is so fresh, colorful, and wonderful -- you will want seconds or thirds!

This is the best salad recipie ever. Every time I have an office potluck or a church social, I make this salad and it gets massive raves.

I used lemon juice instead of lime juice and it was still very good. I also omitted the jalapeños. I think next time I will use some of the dressing as a marinade for chicken and grill it to put in the salad.

I made this dish for a Friday Fiesta Happy Hour. I made the salad without the romaine the day before. Then tossed the veggies and dressing on party day. This was amazing!Without the romaine, the sald keeps for days in the fridge. I did not have any feta but it was still YUMMY!

I made this for two dinners that had to be eaten away from home: Day 1: chopped all of the veg (except the avacado) + half the lettuce. Put half the dressing and half the veg mix in a container in the fridge. Put the other half with the lettuce for day one's meal. Added some leftover cajun chicken and half the feta and 1/2 avocado. Scrumptious. Day 2: chopped the other half of the lettuce and added the stored vegetables + feta + 1/2 avocado + some defrosted cooked shrimp + a bit of paprika. Even better than the first day. On the second day, the jicama and other veg had absorbed more dressing flavor. When I make this again, I'll make all the vegetables and dressing a day ahead. Served two each night. Also, I thought the jalapenos were absolutely essential to the dressing.

I omitted the romaine and the feta, used canned whole-kernel corn (drained), half a chopped Vidalia onion, and a whole diced avocado along with the other ingredients. I let it all sit overnight in the dressing and wow, what a success!! Delicious and very colorful. I couldn't find Rick Bayless' creamy enchiladas, found that recipe on bhg.com for a great dinner.

Great salad and received well by others! Made no changes to this recipe, prepared it just as written. Perfect summer salad and would be even better with some grilled prawns added to it. Double the salad dressing...you'll want to make this one again the following day. This is a keeper.

I made it as a side dish with Seared Sea Scallops with Jalapeno Cream and Southwestern Stir-Fried Zuchinni Rinehart (meal for 3 people), and it was more work (and cost) than it was worth under the circumstances. It would be worthwhile to make for a larger group of people or if it is the foundation for a main dish (i.e. topped with chicken or shrimp as suggested by some of the other reviewers). I really liked the dressing and would make the dressing again.

Great recipe to have in your collection and one to build on easily. I added a bunch of chopped scallion to the salad and 1/2 tsp of cumin to the dressing with great success. Grilled shrimp or chicken would be wonderful additions as well.

This was a nice change from the "noraml, everyday salad" that we tend to have. We had it for a Mexican themed dinner. We didn't use the jicama or radishes and also forgot to buy feta (but I can't imagine the feta would have tasted good with it). Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

I had to throw together a last minute dinner for 12...and this salad was perfect! It is easy to make, and takes little time. I added a little extra jalepeno & some ground pepper, but it is a great salad! My husband is complaining that there isn't enough left over for today!
