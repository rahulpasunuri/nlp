This is a holiday STAPLE! My mother has been making it every Thanksgiving for as long as I can remember, and now the holidays are not complete without it! The leeks give a nice bite to the sweetness of the currants and sweet sausage. This is an absolute favorite in my house!

This is a fantastic recipe! I will heat a cup of port wine and soak my currants to plump before adding to the stuffing. I will also add a small amount of port to the stuffing if it seems a little dry.

I've been making this recipe every few years since it first appeared in '92. It's always a crowd pleaser. If it seems too dry, add a little turkey or chicken stocken to moisten.Looking forward to another wonderful holiday.

This is a great stuffing recipe. I followed it exactly the first time and have since mande some variations. You can substitute mild Italian pork sausage and use dried cranberries. You can leave out the currants all together and no will miss them. I also prefer to use fresh herbs rather than dried.

I can't believe this has 4 stars all over it. I made it for Easter dinner and it was the one part off the meal that wasn't good. I was super disappointed!!! If you like stuffing really dry and crappy give it a shot.

Love this! I've made it several times. I always bake it seperately from the turkey, so I put in more pear nectar, and sometimes apple juice. Kids love this and it is complex enough for the adults.

This was easy and tasty.

I make this every year. I substitue fennel for the celery, btw. It's much better.

Help! I intend to make this stuffing with the Roast Turkey with Pear and Port wine gravy but I detest celery. Any suggestions for a viable substitute?

This was awesome and I am picky picky. I went to Emeril's in LA and thought it was just so so to give you an idea of how picky I am. The gray complimented it nicely. I loved all the leeks!

Fabulous. Finally a wine-friendly Thanksgiving turkey.

Make this once, and you'll make it again and again. Like the previous reviewer, my family won't allow me to make anything else. The turkey with pear and port gravy is also spectacular. Add the sweet potato casserole (like dessert - big hit with kids)and you'll be in turkey heaven. My family claimed no one else's turkey dinner was as good as mine; so, I've given the recipes to them so I won't have to cook every year.

Wonderful receipe. If you want a stuffing that is great and adds taste to your Turkey, use this. You will have plenty left for a side dish also. Have made for 5 years running, and I am not allowed to cook Christmas dinner without this on the menu.

To the previous reviewer: This recipe in the '92 magazine follows the recipe for Roast Turkey w/ Pear and Port Gravy. In that recipe, the instructions that you should spoon 7 cups of stuffing into turkey and then add 1 egg and 1/4 cup pear nectar to remaining stuffing in bowl. Transfer to a buttered 13x9x2 baking dish; cover with foil and place in oven for last 50 minutes of turkey's cooking time.

Did I miss something? What do you do after you've added the beaten eggs?
