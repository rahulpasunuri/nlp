Have been lookin for a great receipe like this for a long time. Light soft fluffy cupcake with wonderful flavor. Mine made way more than 24, more like 34. Fill only 3/4. This is certainly a keeper.

My birthday is in July, I didn't want to make a lot of cupcakes, so I greased and floured a 9 X 13 pan and baked my cake for 45 minutes. I didn't have cream cheese, so I made a chocolate frosting and decorated with a couple of dark bing cherries. I would make this again, I loved it. I would make this cake again, and again, and again.

I made this recipe from the Gourmet cookbook - in the cookbook they adjusted all the measurements (downwards), and wrote the directions more clearly, no doubt due to the reviews here. The recipe makes 30 cupcakes with the adjustments, and turned out well for me. The cupcakes had a nice light crumb - I filled 2/3 full and they rose perfectly with a flat top as cake batter should (muffins have domes). The chocolate frosting should be used immediately if you're making it; it stiffens up too much in the refrigerator. The lemon frosting needs to be colder though; I'd probably use less lemon juice since it was a bit thin. Delicious!

I was looking for a recipe to use up leftover buttermilk from making pancakes, and came across this one. I used good-quality ingredients, and it was a total waste. I'm glad that I read the reviews to not fill the cups as much as the recipe calls for, but I still ended up with the cakes spreading wide. Worse, though, was that I never ended up with a nice cupcake dome, they're totally flat on top. The cupcakes barely hold together, and come apart the instant that you bite into them. As a result, icing them is a bit fiddly, and requires a lot more attention than icing cupcakes usually takes. The only saving grace of these cupcakes is that they're bland enough that a good icing can make them seem better than they really are. (I used Nigella Lawson's chocolate icing from "How to Be a Domestic Goddess", which is more than these cupcakes deserve.) Never again!

These cupcakes are delicious. However, I am rating it 2 forks because the recipe as written is rubbish. Don't fill the cups! These cupcakes rise A LOT and you will have a mess on your hands. Fill the cups 2/3 full and you will have a beautifully domed cupcake. The flavor is delicate but good and the crumb is excellent. I also recommend alternating adding the buttermilk and flour mixture gradually in 3-4 parts for a nicer crumb. The recipe makes more like 30 cupcakes than 24.

These cupcakes are really very nice! They are easy to make and are light and moist. The recipe definitely makes more than 24. Do not fill the cups to the top as they rise a lot! Of course, don't over bake them. Bake times are always approximations as oven temps may vary. I made both frostings and they were perfect. I did use cocoa powder for the chocolate one instead and it was great. I piped the frostings onto the cakes with a pastry bag and the consistency was very good- work with it slightly chilled. Overall, a very useful recipe for parties!

So moist and delicious! I added chocolate chips and accidentally left out the vanilla extract and they're still wonderful! I did make up for the vanilla extract omission by making a frosting with equal parts butter and creme fraiche, vanilla extract and powdered sugar to taste, and milk until it was a good consistency. They're absolutely amazing.

For some reason, mine were done in only 10 minutes...delicious, light, but don't overcook.

This recipe is amazing! I added some lemon zest to the batter which made them really yummy and for a frosting used the Lemon Cream Cheese one from this site, delicious! Tip: To get the perfect size cupcakes use an ice cream scoop!

Yummy and very moist -- I did not have cake flour on hand, but used a cake flour "recipe" (add 2 tbsp corn starch to cup prior to measuring all purpose flour, then sift as directed). This does make at least 36 cupcakes. None "exploded" (not sure what you mean by that, really, sounds interesting), but don't overfill the cups, that's for sure, as they will rise and overflow -- and not in a good way. Pretty easy and fast, if you have enough pans:-)

I have made these cupcakes for years and years. Tried and true. These deserve more than the 2-1/2 forks! Unfair!

A beach standard. Everyone loved them. But the recipe makes 36, not 24 (and almost overflows pans at that! Worth the mess.

This one's a toughie, due to the high soda content. You have to use the batter quickly, otherwise it gets a little flat and melty in the bowl, thus giving it its tendency to fall in the oven. I didn't bother making the chocolate portion of the icing; I made a half batch of the lemon flavor only and it was plenty (after all, whipped cream cheese doesn't come cheap!). Would I make these again? Probably only if I absolutely had to have a yellow cupcake for an Easter event. Otherwise, I'll be sticking with my tried-and-true chocolate cupcake recipe. By the way, if you can get the whole shebang in your oven at once, I recommend filling large muffin liners to about 5/6's capacity -- you will get that nice doming effect.

I would love to give this recipe 4 forks, because it really is good, but it just doesn't make 24 cupcakes. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the recipe yeilds 36 small cupcakes. I can see where the people who followed the recipe to the letter found that their cupcakes "exploded". The batter is not strong enough to hold big rounded cupcake tops. Fill the paper cupcake liners only 1/2 full, about 1/4 cup of batter. The batter will rise just to the top of the paper, making it easy to frost. The batter does make a nice, fluffy, moist but delicate cupcake. The taste is a perfect, bland foil for a creamy frosting. Pretty much any good frosting would work. I liked the lemon version of the frosting recipe that comes with these cupcakes. A chocolate ganache would be divine. I served these at my son's 4th birthday party. Even the adults liked them and the children had lots of seconds. I would make these again without hesitation.

I pre-made these last night for my daughter's birthday party next week. She wants cupcakes instead of a cake this year. FAB! Taking previous advice, I only filled the muffin cups 2/3 full and they came out great. I also got 30 cupcakes out of the batch. I'm making a buttercream icing that I found on this site instead of the ones with this recipe, because I want to be able to decorate the cupcakes with colored sprinkles and I think the buttercream's color will offset this better. The taste of the cupcakes also goes GREAT with the buttercream -- since I made so many extra, I used my husband and his friend as guinea pigs and they loved it! I'm going to freeze them and pull them out to thaw probably the night before the party.

These cupcakes came out extremely well! With some cake recipes, I'll pull the pans out of the oven and then they sink or pull away from the cupcake liners, but these stayed up with a nice, smooth, firm top - perfect for lots of frosting. I will definitely make these again. Perfect for birthday parties.

Big hit at a party last night with kids and adults alike. I followed the directions to fill them up, but ended up having to separate tops with knife to get them out of the pan. Next time I'll use less batter and make more cupcakes.

These cupcakes are delicious! The cake was light and airy. I made the chocolate frosting only and it was just as good. Any great frosting recipe would be fabulous on these cupcakes. P.S. To anyone who isn't a baker: remember all your ingredients should be room temp! It really helps!

These were absolutely delicious! I made them for my birthday party with the vanilla buttercream icing also on this site. Everyone loved them. The tops were very slightly crisp on the edges and delicious. As far as doming, I've never had a domed cupcake, just a domed muffin. I let the frosting creat the dome! I can't wait to make these again.

i have a couple of notes to previous reviewers: for the problem of the cupcakes not getting a nice dome on top, try mixing it a little longer to develop any gluten that is in the flour (you need a little structure to develop in order for the rising steam to create the attractive dome shape) also, for the reviewers whose cupcakes exploded (i can't believe you made a cupcake explode!), try either cutting back on the baking powder & baking soda, or again mix it for longer. yeah, i'm a bit of a nerd when it comes to food. food science classes tend to do that to you. good luck! these are really tasty cupcakes.

This is a recipe I keep coming back to since someone served it to me at a picnic several years ago. I've never had a problem with the cupcakes overflowing the muffin tins; in fact, I love everything about this recipe, from the moist yet airy cupcakes to the chocolate icing. I usually skip the lemon icing.

I halved this recipe and used up some buttermilk. Like other reviewers, my cupcakes also exploded out the top and some of them just plain exploded. I didn't frost them and although those that didn't explode were very tasty, I still wouldn't repeat the experiment.

I made these cupcakes twice in a row trying to get them right. I used the recipe printed in the new Gourmet cookbook which calls for a little less of every ingredient. Maybe they were trying to correct the quantity problems that are apparent in this recipe. In any case, I had trouble getting the cupcakes to look nice although they tasted great. What makes cupcakes spread out and go flat on top rather than mound up? Must be the amount of batter in the cup but I can't seem to get this right. Crumb is large and very buttery.

Awful texture! Tried these as a way to use up some buttermilk (why don't they sell it in smaller containers?!). The taste is mediocre, the texture is horrible. I was going to bring them to work, but would not want to subject anyone to them.

I LOVE these cupcakes delicious. I have NO problem with them being dry. Be sure to spoon the flour into the measuring cups rather than scoop it out with the cup. I have made them twice - fabulous each time. Esp yummy warm from the oven (without frosting).

These were really nice cupcakes - very light but moist. Using cake flour is a must! I substituted almond extract for 1 tsp. of vanilla. Also put a bit more chocolate than called for in the frosting to get a darker color and deeper taste.

frosting is great, the cupcakes were just mediocre & I am inclined to agree with the reviewers that said they had gotten moister cupcakes from a box.

These were delicious and beautiful. I had prepared myself for potential disaster after reading all the reviews (overflows, enormous volume, dry), and none of that happened. I underfilled the cups slightly, and got only about four extra cupcakes. I made the frostings, too. I really liked the lemon, but the chocolate was the first to disappear at our block party.

I've been making these for special occasions for about two years now. I haven't had a problem with them being dry. They're always a huge hit whenever I serve them to people. I had to speak up for them because I consider them to be a perfect recipe-- light, sweet, and fulfilling.

Rating: 3
I agree that trying to fit all this batter into 24 muffin cups can lead to disaster; there's just too much of it. I think my muffin pans are pretty much the standard and I got 3 dozen cupcakes easily. The cupcakes themselves were fine, though. I made only the chocolate frosting, doubling the amount of chocolate and using a combo of unsweetened, bittersweet, and semisweet. It was excellent.

For those who have dry cupcakes, remember that the recipe calls for cake flour, which can make all the difference. Regular unbleached white flour(high gluten) absorbs tons more moisture than cake flour.

One word for these: AWFUL. Bad texture, too heavy, awful. Box would have been better.

Nothing terribly special about this recipe. I enjoyed it but when it comes to cupcakes, this recipe fell short on texture and the choice of frostings suggested.

A great buttermilk cupcake. Moist and light, and freezes well. Ideal for a child's birthday party. They taste good with either a cream cheese frosting or a butter cream frosting (plain, no chocolate). My only change was reducing the sugar by a 1/4 cup. I felt they were too sweet. Tasted great with the reduced sugar. I also think they taste better refrigerated overnight.

I make this recipe quite often. The cupcakes are delicious, moist and keep well for days. And the chocolate frosting is a snap. However, the other cooks are right, it makes many more than 24 and don't fill the paper cups with as much batter as the recipe indicates -- the always overflow. Last time I made these, I got about 40 cupcakes out of this recipe! Great for parties!

Rating: 3
I too found out the hard way, that these will overflow, if you follow the recipe. I ended up having to slice the tops off the first 18, and then made the rest slightly smaller than normal so the would match. I "covered" my touchup, with lots of buttercream icing! ;) However, I am planning on making them again, as I was pleased witht he flavor and texture.

These cupcakes are moist and delicious and stay that way for several days after baking. The lemon icing is a bit thin - I had to add more sugar to reach a spreadable consistency.

I was irritated by this recipe because the instructions are wrong! You cannot fill the cupcake liners or they will overflow. The recipe makes many more cupcakes than indicated. Does anyone test these???? I wasted time and money on this one.

Wonderful cupcakes. I took them to work & everyone loved them. I wanted Lemon Cupcakes so I added the grated rind of 2 lemons & the juice of 1 lemon to the batter. The batter was thick but the cupcakes turned out light & fluffy. I made one tray of regular sizes cupcakes & several trays of mini cupcakes. Perfect for Spring!

My husband and I made this recipe twice. While I found that it did make the number that it said it would (24) with a very thick batter--it tasted almost like cornbread. What gives? We couldn't figure it out, but I won't bother trying it again.

Both the cake and the chocolate icing were delicious (I doubled the cocoa and didn't do the lemon). The cake was light and buttery, and the icing was rich and decadent. I made 44 cupcakes with this recipe, instead of the 24 it suggested.

I added about 1/4cup cocoa and they were just wonderful... so was the chocolate frosting.
