Quick, easy and delicious. Great way to use Bok choi from my CSA. I used soba noodles.

I followed the recipe this time an was very good and easy. Next time will likely add red pepper flakes and more veggies. Used dried udon from WF and it was a quick yummy dinner.

As udon are wheat noodles, I made this using Tinkyada rice fettucine, which was delish. Also added some crimini mushrooms. I can see trying it with different vegetables and chili flakes and making it a staple.

I suspect frozen udon is key. Cook just long enough to thaw it, really, then rinse it quick to cool it down and get the excess starch off. Awesome. The gummy bears of noodles. Sort of the same idea as the bubbles in bubble tea. Kids love 'em.

We didn't really like this. We used fresh udon and it got mushy, and the sauce was pretty one-dimensional. The best part was the tofu--I baked it at 400 for about 20 minutes before making the stir-fry and that make it just slightly crispy in the finished dish.

I used fresh udon, and it was delicious. I would increase the amount of sauce the next time. We didn't have bok choy, so added other veggies and greens. A quick recipe with a million yummy variations!

I used the baby bok choy our CSA brought and sliced it lenghtwise, retaining the bottom white parts. It was very tasty and I've made it several times. I also tend to use tofu that I've frozen and then thawed. It changes the texture and allows it to absorb more flavor

I modified by using one whole bok choy head rather than two, and I used the whites. I put the whites in with the onion. I also used rice vinegar and marinated the tofu in the sauce beforehand. I attempted to fry the tofu with the onion, but as a tofu novice I think I put it in at the wrong time (it turned out looking like scrambled egg in the end). Added red pepper flakes and used buckwheat soba noodles instead of udon. Very good! Look forward to reheating for lunch tomorrow.

I was really impressed by how delicious this simple recipe was (so impressed that I am writing my first review ever on Epicurious). I did make some modifications and additions: I used rice vinegar instead of balsamic, since it made more sense with the other ingredients in the sauce. I added water chestnuts and snow peas. And I added the tofu to the pan just after adding the garlic, ginger, and green onion, so that it could get a little crispy. I was disappointed that I couldn't find udon noodles, but the linguine worked just fine. This was flavorful and satisfying. My boyfriend went back for thirds, and he is NOT a tofu guy.

Excellent. Made it according to the recipe except added more veggies and followed the other reviews to add red pepper flakes. My kids loved it! The first time they've eaten tofu without a complaint.

I think this is a good building block to something much better. Next time I will add a bit less balsamic and also add some chili to give it some spice. I added more veggies than just the bok choy like (chinese or regular) broccoli, carrots, or what ever else is around in the kitchen. I often use Green Tea Soba Noodles. All in all, a great recipe.

I looked in the pantry/fridge and was missing a few ingredients. So I opted for a thin sliced white onion and spinach linguine (omitting the tofu) and it was delicious. My kid loved it too.

I thought this was excellent! It's great recipe for a weeknight and a great way to use your bok choy if you're in a vegetable share. I made a couple minor changes but I think it's good as it is. I sauteed the tofu in some sesame oil and added some shittake mushrooms when i added the bok choy. I also used rice wine vinegar instead of the balsamic and added red pepper flakes, as others suggested. I also doubled the garlic and ginger. I served this with siracha sauce and my husband was over the moon. I will certainly make this again and again!

My kids who hate tofu LOVED it. Marinated the tofu, added the mushrooms, used rice vinegar, and added chili flakes and some extra soy sauce. Served with sweet chili sauce. I will definitely make it again!

Definitely rice vinegar. I boiled the noodles in mushroom broth which added a nice deep flavor. Also, I added the bok choy last, when I began to thicken the sauce. Adding it too soon can make it soggy. For those who complained about the starchy mess caused by the udon noodles, try cooking them according to the epicurious method from the 'udon noodle' search. My vegan daughter loved this and wants me to make it again this week.

This made a good weeknight meal. I used a regular onion, rice vinegar, and scrambled 2 eggs to substitute for the tofu. I'll probably make it again.

I substituted sesame chili oil for the 1 Tablespoon that was part of the sauce. It added a nice kick. I also used many more veggies - red pepper, zucchini and carrots.

Great basic recipe to modify, as others have noted. My kids like it as is, my husband likes it with a little hot sauce, I like it with broccoli and shallots...

Really fast and tasty weeknight meal. Used frozen udon noodles, not dried, as we prefer them, and also used rice wine instead of balsamic vinegar. Topped with Sriracha for heat. Will certainly make again with various greens and protein.

As a vegetarian, udon noodle soup is hard to come by. This recipe is fairly standard but I did happen to make many modifications. First, definitely used rice wine vinegar, tons of garlic and ginger. Added some red chili peppers as well. I used napa with tofu and shitake mushrooms and cooked it in mushroom broth. It was heaven with udon noodles. Currently making it again with some enoki mushrooms in the mix.

I loved it..I used more of the white part of the bok choy than was called for and I browned the tofu in olive oil first. Also served it on Spegatinni..

I liked this dish fine, though it seemed rather "standard" to me - nothing that would make it stand out from most home-cooked Asian dishes. It is versatile, though - you could use pretty much any green vegetable, or a combination.

I liked this recipe, as did my roommate and friend who aren't huge veggie food fans. Used rice wine vinegar as suggested by others. Also, didn't have any honey so used 2tb of mirin instead and some shredded coconut. Also added fresh cilantro and snow peas that were in my farm share this week. Didn't have any udon, so used rice sticks, which worked pretty well. Would make again.

Tasty. I doubled the sesame oil in the sauce and just used canola oil for the stir frying. I added sliced red bell peppers, which added a nice sweet freshness, and some dried, crushed red pepper flakes, which really enhanced the overall flavor. The sauce tastes very soy-sauce heavy but if you let it rest and thicken for several minutes off heat it is pretty good.

Im gonig to make this right now. Since I dont have sesame oil or ginger today, I'm going to use some black sesame seeds, a spoonful of peanut butter and some fresh herbs. YUM! Also, I recommend wheat-less noodles. In general.

This dish is quick, inexpensive, healthy and cruelty-free. But it's definitely VERY subtle--almost bland. It makes for an okay weeknight dinner, but if you're looking for something with a lot of flavor, this isn't it.

this is an awesome recipe. i leave out the ginger (can't stand it) and add red pepper flakes. the tofu really absorbs the flavor unlike other recipes that use tofu. it's important not to overcook the udon.

Rating: 1
I did what everyone said-- used baby bok choy, including whites, substituted rice wine vinegar, added garlic-chili oil, marinated the tofu, and ended up, as warned, with a bland, sticky, starchy mess. I know there are good tofu and udon dishes out there, and I'm still looking for one.

I thought this recipe was quite nice but made some changes. I used a bit less balsamic vinegar than called for, added more ginger & soy sauce, added mushrooms and some diced fresh red chili. Very nice. It's also a good idea to marinate the tofu in the sauce beforehand.

I used whole baby bok choy. Loved the udon noodles! I don't think the linguini would come close. A bit simple perhaps for American taste but good nevertheless. Crushed red pepper is nice.

Rating: 3
Even without the tofu, this dish is excellent. I do, however, dice about 1/3 of the leftover "whites" (stems) that the recipe says discard. I believe it adds a nice crunch and a mild bitter bite.

I was so unimpressed with this recipe. I made it with the rice wine vinegar substitution. It was quite bland. I think it could be improved upon with some sambal, more ginger, 1/2 the tofu (Even though I'm a big tofu fan, it was too much with the noodles.), and I bet that if you made it a day in advance the flavors would mature. My recommendation is: keep looking.

We make this dish quite often. The good thing about it is that you can easily add different vegetables or shrimp or mushrooms or anything you like without spoiling the whole dish. We also tried it with different noodles, and green bean noodles worked best. I agree though that rice vinegar works better than balsamic in any case.

Rating: 3
very good but needs more zing. Add some peanut sauce or garlic or more ginger or all of these. Also made it with shrimg, not tofu, and it was great.

The rice wine vinegar substitution is key. I also added 1/4 c. fresh chopped cilantro, and the juice of one fresh-squeezed lime. We're talking FABULOUS. This is a great dish you can serve when you have vegetarians or vegans over for dinner. It's very sophisticated and interesting without being overly health-food-store. Fabula!

This is a really tasty and easy recipe. I have made it with half the quantity of bok choy and it still turns out fine. It's a one-dish meal because you get your protein (tofu), veggies (bok choy), and carbohydrates (noodles) all in one. My kids like it too!

I've made this twice now. Once by the book and once with a few twists of my own. Have to say I like my version best, but it provided a good start. I used rice wine vinegar instead of balsamic, mushrooms instead of bok choy, added chili paste and stuck with the linguine. Turned out yummy!!

I might try this one again but with less soya sauce and maybe a little more cornstarch.

use rice vinegar and sugar. use 1tsp cornstarch use Barilla linguine. Kids loved it

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but based on the reviews of those who have, I have a suggestion: thoroughly rinse the udon noodles before incorporating them. Udon is extremely starchy and can create a gooey mess of a sauce if it's not rinsed clean.

I liked this dish! My husband and I love hot and spicy food, so I added a little red chili sauce. I think that made all of the difference. I recommend using baby bok choy if you can find it. It's so tender and sweet.

We did not like this dish at all. I followed the recipe to the T, but the sauce was runny, there was way too much bok choy, and the combination of sauces created a very unappetizing flavor. My husband took one bite and threw out the rest.

This was an interesting dish. I liked the sauce. I made it with snow peas and bean sprouts instead of bok choy in order to get my husband to eat it. He found the udon noodles too strange. I liked them, but they are different. The veggie switch worked out fine. I added the sprouts at the end so they stayed crisp. Although not vegan myself, I am always on the look out for vegan recipes to appease my many vegan relatives, and this was a winner in that respect.
