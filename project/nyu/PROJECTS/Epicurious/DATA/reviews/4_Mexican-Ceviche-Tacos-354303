This recipe is fantastic. I make it at least once a week in the summer. It's a huge hit with friends and family. I serve it with guacamole and Greek yogurt and hard corn tortillas.

LOVE this. Have made several times and serve as an Appy with Tostito Scoops

Easy to make, perfect for hot Arizona summer days. I liked it best either with white corn taco shells, or romaine lettuce. I kept leftovers in the fridge for 3 days with no noticeable decline in ceviche goodness.

I've been making this at least every few weeks this summer. It's an excellent, easy, healthy dinner. I leave out the salsa and lettuce and substitute fresh diced chilis for the canned ones. I also top with fat-free Greek yogurt as a sour cream alternative. Fantastic recipe!

I used fresh striped bass, added sour cream, fish sauce and sesame oil and it was outstanding!

Very good. Made this with Mexican white rice and refried black beans. Yumm!!!

This was a great success. Bright and clean taste with a freshness that just wowed the lunch group I served it at. I used both soft corn and crisp corn tortilla's and everyone agreed the crispy ones, while messier, were a much better contrast with the ceviche. I had used store bought ones which I had heated up some but next time will fry my own as I think they always taste better and won't crack apart when you bite into them. This could also easily be served in a martini glass as a first course along with a chip. Seriously, this was a great success.

Excellent recipe, everything was perfect. I didn't cube the fish small enough so the texture wasn't as good as it could've been. Next time though...

Excellent recipe! Very easy and tasty...family loved it! Of course I spiced it up with two fresh jalapenos along with the juice from jar of same. I chose to wrap in lettuce rather than taco shells for a great low carb lunch!

My family and I loved this, even those who were wary of "raw" fish. I used tuna, and I omitted the avocado, as most of my family are not avocado fans. Adding in some plain Greek yogurt replaced some of the creaminess that was lacking. Everything else I did according to the recipe. It was very easy to put together and delicious, albeit a little messy, to eat.

Perfect, healthy, light dinner for a hot July night. Didn't change anything [very unusual for me] and served native corn on the cob for a side dish. Wow!
