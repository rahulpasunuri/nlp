good recipe. i do have the problem of my noodles sticking together. does that mean i'm putting too many in the pot of water? or does it mean that I need to insert them into the water differently? or does it mean that i shouldn't use a sieve to drain the water? advice please

This recipe made good noodles and it was easy to roll out. I didn't think that it had that fresh Italian pasta taste to it. They were more suited for Asian soup noodles. Udon comes to mind. For Italian dishes, I will continue searching for that perfect recipe.

This recipe makes fresh pasta so easy you could make it every night and it tastes great too! We have made it with the all-purpose flour and with the whole wheat. Both are good but we prefer the whole wheat. Adding some black pepper to the dough gave it another flavor dimension as well. We will be making this again and again.

The pasta is great! I made it with my new kitchenaid mixer, using the dough hook. It was so easy. I didn't have a pasta machine, so I rolled the dough out with a rolling pin. This recipe is so easy and delicious.

This receipe is so easy to make and is great. I used my kitchenaid mixer to do the mixing and the kneading. It was so fast and simple! I like this pasta when rolled out very thin.

Made this yesterday with the new pasta machine Christmas present. The recipe was very easy and tasted very good. Since it was my first time working with the machine I was concerned when the noodles stuck together initially but separated during cooking. I probably will use this recipe for lasagna noodles next.

I have never made homemade pasta and got a pasta machine for Christmas. I found this recipe and by the time my two kids (ages 6 and 2) were done "helping" :o), we only had about half a recipe so I boiled it up just for grins. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! It's like flying first class - you never knew what you were missing, but it was much better than you ever expected.

I have tried for YEARS to make my own pasta - usually ending in tears. I have tried to use semolina flour,etc. This recipe is PERFECT. Easy to make, Easy to roll & cut, tastes light & delicious. LOVE IT!!

My 2 year old loved the pasta. I thought it was ok.

I have never used cake flour in my pasta dough until I tried this recipe, and I may never go back to making fresh pasta without it! I didn't use a food processor, just a regular mixer. The dough was silky, but not sticky; firm, but not overly floury. I made Udon (Japanese noodles) with the dough, and my mother in particular loved it! She kept asking for more... of the noodles! This recipe is a must-have for any cook. I will use it again.

I've played around with the proportions and types of flour in this recipe and have eventually concluded that 1 cup cake flour plus 1/4 cup of wheat flour works best. It is an excellent recipe and really requires very little time - about 10 minutes to make the dough and 10 minutes to roll out and cut the pasta. I really encourage you to try it. You will never go back to packaged pasta.

this was fabulous. some tips: yes on the cuisinart. the cake flour seemed to make a difference as well (i've been shopping around for pasta recipes for a bit now) the mixing took less than a minute, tops. kneading was fine although some extra flour was necessary for the surface. i didn't use plastic wrap but just floured up a little whenever it seemed damp. also -i made it with 3T chopped very dry fresh parsley (as in not damp with water) and it was quite good. also, i made fettucine with puttanesca sauce (an excellent recipe out of silver palate) rather than ravioli. it was pretty fab.

AAAAAAH! The ol' pasta machine. I remember my mom teaching me how to make fresh pasta when I was kid...sticky hands...flour everywhere...pasta strings drying on paper bags. My grandmother taught my mom, and then she taught all of her children. She bought me a machine for my wedding shower and my husband keeps asking, "Why don't you make more pasta?" I say, "Because it's a heck of a lot of work!" But, maybe once a year I'll bring it down from the cupboard and get flour everywhere for memories' sake. My mom always used all-purpose flour and "how ever many eggs it took." That always worked, but, after seeing this recipe, I may just be getting the erge to get rollin' This ones for you Nana Salvaterra!

It was very good. I would make it again if I had company.
