If you follow this recipe exactly, it will become one of your favorite custard pies. It takes a long time to prepare the filling; but if you do this step the day before, the pie will go together quickly when you are ready to serve. This pie reminds me of one a favorite aunt use to make when I was a little girl. She would let me lick the bowl. A real crowd pleaser. A+++++Yum!
