This is a good low-fat recipe with lots of flavor. Mine was not too sweet like a lot of the reviews but I used the brown organic sugar cane instead of white sugar. I completely forgot to put in the cherries, but it's still good. Another reason why it's probably the perfect sweetness. I too had to leave it cook longer but I'm in altitude in Colorado. This is a great easy recipe for a low fat treat without the guilt.

Delicious and healthy. I used lime peel instead of orange peel, and it was amazing.

This is a great, quick and low cal recipe-- I used Splenda. However, the rice didn't get as soft as we would have enjoyed. I guess that I will add more milk so that there is more time before it evaporates for the rice to soften? I was also thinking that tossing a bit of coconut extract and cinnamon would also be winning flavor touches.

Good recipe and easy. I subsituted 2 cups of milk with 2 cups of vanilla soy milk, added a little rum flavor, a pinch of cinnamon, and two packets of Splenda instead of sugar. At the end I added rasins and dried cranberries. I used Jasmine rice. The dessert turned out great!

I found this to be perfect! Instead of sugar I used Splenda and it turned out creamy, rich and delicious. It was the perfect finish for our dinner of Tuna Burgers (also featured on your website!).

Maybe it's the differences between stoves, but I have to cook it for an hour to get the rice to even absorb SOME of the liquid. I used dried apricots, and added only two tablespoons of sugar(all from fellow reviewers), but I still find it too sweet! And I thought I have a sweet tooth!

i used dried Apricots in place of the Dried Cherries and it was a Great hit with my Family.

Although the pudding had good flavor, the rice did not cook through in the time alotted. In fact, I spent an extra half hour, plus more ingredients to try to get the rice to cook. I'm sure with the proper adjusments this recipe turns out pretty good, but I will have to try it again.

I really like this recipe, and have made it several times. I even use rice milk instead of regular milk, and it's just great. You could also use golden raisins, lemon peel, and cardamom for a yummy variation.

There was too much sugar, which overpowered the flavour of the pudding. It could be reduced 2tbsp and then sweetened after if neccessary. Also very little salt is needed-- perhaps a not so generous pinch. And fresh vanilla pod beans would give it more of a vanilla flavour rather than the extract. For a low fat version of a rich pudding (usually make with condensed milk for richness) it is still good. If, in the end it still isn't sweet enough you could add some lowfat vanilla soymilk for an added creamy texture and richer flavour.
