Awesome recipe for pastry. Easy. Wonderful texture and taste. Add enough ice water to allow it to be malleable. I did it just with sour cherries, with two heaping TBSP of corn starch and 1/2 cup of sugar tossed with the cherries.

I used a pre-made crust, because I was short on time and was pleased with the results. The caramel and creme fraiche raise this easy to make dessert to the next level. I would change the yield to 6 servings.

First thing gone from the Thanksgiving dessert table. I wanted something lighter than traditional pie after the holiday meal and this fit the bill. Also made Creme Fraiche for the first time and paired with the caramel sauce, this dessert is delightful. It's got a permanent place on the keeper list!

Well, this has just been requested for the third year in a row ... my husband says it's his favorite pie and we always find some family member in a corner of the kitchen afterwards, eating caramel straight out of the jar with a spoon!

Delicious! The crust (actually, the whole recipe) was so easy and flaky. The caramel sauce gave me trouble, but might take a few tries to master. I like the idea of serving it with dulce de leche ice cream. This is a keeper!

Beautiful and EASY dessert, especially since I love to cook but I have not mastered pasty baking. Great winter dessert that is not too filling or rich.

The crust was delightful. As a whole it was simple to prepare with excellant results. A definite Do-Again!

Rustic and elegant. The crust was flaky and perfect and the cherries a really nice flavor treat within the pastry. I found the light amount of sugar perfect actually, not too sweet or overbearing but the dessert was rich enough with the Creme Fraiche and Caramel. I served it with (CARAMEL SAUCE from The Pie and Pastry Bible, November 1998) from this site which also turned out very well, smooth, rich and better than any caramel sauce I have tried in the past. I will make this again.

This was great! Try using Hagen Daas Dulce de Leche Ice Cream instead of the caramel sauce. It's a keeper.

Wonderful! And though it is "rustic," it is elegant, as well.

Gee, I hate to be the party pooper but I didn't find anything special about this recipe. It's not even as good as my regular apple pie. I thought the small amount of sugar in the recipe didn't compensate for the tartness of the Granny Smith apples and they contrasted TOO much with the very sweet carmel sauce. (My caramel sauce actually came out fine - not too thin like other reviews, because I used about .75 of the called for cream.) If I were to make this again, I'd add a bit of allspice, more sugar and some dots of butter to the apples. I served it to my husband and two teenage boys who LOVE apple pie, and they didn't say a thing: no groans of ecstasy, no demands for second helpings like I usually get with my cooking. Now that's a BAD sign!

Simple to make and delicious. I, too, subbed dried cranberries for cherries as that's what was in the pantry and it turned out great. Didn't use the creme fraiche nor caramel sauce but I'm sure it is fantastic! Maybe next time, as there definitely will be a next time.

This is an amazing dessert, great for all seasons. For spring, I substituted peaches and raspberries for a lighter feel - it was absolutely fabulous. Just watch the carmel, it burns easily.

One of the BEST crusts I've ever made. Very light, very flaky. Pefectly compliments the sweet, soft texture of the filling. This one is definitely a keeper!

I came across this dish a few months ago, and since then I've made it on many occasions due to its deliciousness and ease of preparation. It's so simple to whirl out the dough from the food processor, and then saute the apples, cherries, and cinnamon... roll out the dough, add the filling, and away you go! A very simple, delicious, and elegant dish. Enjoy!

Made the galette for the first time this Thanksgiving, and it was everybody's favorite. Delicious, gorgeous and easy! I used maple sugar in the filling and added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the caramel sauce, also 1/4 cup ground roasted walnuts to the crust. This recipe is a keeper.

WOW! I used a refrigerated pie crust, mixed Granny Smiths & Golden Delicious apples and used dried cranberries instead of cherries and this is by far one of the most delicious apple desserts I've enjoyed in awhile. Did serve vanilla ice cream on the side but it really didn't need it. I think using the Golden Delicous apples made it perfect. A definite keeper.

Delicious! I have never enjoyed or even been very good at baking desserts but this is one that I have had flawless results with every time. It really is simple and the carmel sauce is a must! I made this for a dinner party one night and literally had one guest eating the carmel sauce with a spoon! Please try this, you and your guests/family will enjoy it!

This recipe was easy to prepare and it was great. I added store bought caramel sauce and fresh whipped cream. I would make this recipe again and again. My family loved it.

I made this recipe for my french class and everyone adored it. the crust is done when just golden browned and the sauteing of the apples before hand really makes them tender. It is not very sweet at all so it does really need some caramel or sweet sauce topping. I subsituted dried cranberries for the cherrie: very popping and tasty. The whole thing was soft with the right give and texture in the mouth and very appealing to the eye. It really should look rustic when you make it and not like you used a pan. Excellent!

I made this for a cooking demonstration in Sept. The crust rolled out beautifully. It really needed the caramel sauce, as the apple mixture is very tart. The galette tasted great and everyone raved about it! I will make it again.

Sublime! The galette gets its sweet taste from the divine caramel sauce. The creme fraiche was a lovely subtle touch (two tbsp of sour cream worked well).

Ditto to the other comments. I have made this several times. When I don't have cherries, I use dried cranberries. I have failed miserably making caramel sauce and substitute a low- fat purchased one. We love whipped cream on top, too.

This is very tasty and not that hard to make. The cherries are a nice touch. I would definitely make this again. I served it with the caramel sauce and ice cream rather than the creme fraiche. I may try drizzling some of the sauce on myself - the apples don't caramelize at all themselves, so you need the sauce for that taste.
