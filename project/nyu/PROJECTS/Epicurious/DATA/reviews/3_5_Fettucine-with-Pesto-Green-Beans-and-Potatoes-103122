Yum! Loved this comforting dish. I found it needed a good bit of salt (and a dash of cayenne) and benefited from parm on top at the end. Per other reviewer's concerns, I used another pesto recipe from Simply Recipes - it was smaller and used similar proportions. I ran out of basil (my plants are not faring well this year!) and added a good bit of arugula to make up for it and it still turned out great. Next time I would add a bit more garlic, but I'm just a garlicky kind of person :)

Excellent...would use 1 pound of pasta, or save some of the pesto!

In the May 1995 issue of Bon Appetit and found on this site is the recipe for Trenette (or linguine) with Pesto, potatoes, and green beans. We love this version the best and the proportions are just right. For 4 servings I found cutting everything in half except for the potatoes and green beans worked perfectly for my family. Be sure to save the necessary cooking water as it is needed to keep the pasta moist and hot.

This was a delicious and quick recipe that was a big hit with my family! Both my 4 year old and 20 month old could not stop eating! I even used jarred pesto this time around, but I plan on making this again when basil overflows in my garden.

I love this recipe - easy to make and tastes delicious. I have made it many times and my company always asks for more.

I used the only nuts I had on hand in the pesto which were cashews, they were good but probably not as good as pine nuts. I found the potato chunks a bit large, next time I would cut them smaller. I used lemon pepper fetuccine for the pasta which was an excellent choice. Overall a very good dish that is quick to make, suitable for a quick meal after work or for company. Very good with red wine.

This dish is fantastic! I originally made it from its first publication in Bon Appetit's Mediterranean issue back in 1995. I still have that issue one of the magazines best ever. The dish sounds heavy with pasta and potatoes but it really wasn't due to the richness of the sauce and the crisp of the beans. I highly suggest finding that old Mediterranean issue circa 1995.

I really like this...but I did use store bought pesto because of the negative reviews and to save time. Also I added some diced roma tomatoes. Really good...my BF loved it too. Parmesean cheese and toasted pine nuts on top are a must

To get really authentic, try finding Trofie pasta. It's like shorter, skinnier cavatelli. That's the pasta used in Liguria, birthplace of pesto. The pesto/green bean/potato sauce is the classic dish!

I used about 1/2 cup cheese instead of a full cup.. but the sauce was still pretty creamy. Liked it a lot. Shall try adding additional veggies next time.

My husband was extremely skeptical with the pesto pasta and potato combination, but the recipe turned out fantastic! I did use premade pesto sauce (more to save time and effort), and it turned out wonderful. I will definately make this again.

Based on previous reviews, i bought the pesto sauce. I also replaced the green beans with broccoli and added only a little bit of the cooking water. Altogether, this dish was delicious, but it could have added some more flavor.

REALLY easy and very tasty when made with store-bought pesto. We used leftover new potatoes, and tossed in a can of pasta-seasoned diced tomatoes. Fresh parmesan would make an exellent addition.

Made with a store-bought pesto and substituted red potatoes.

I used my own pesto recipe of fresh basil, toasted pine nuts, garlic, parmesan, salt & pepper, but otherwise followed this recipe to the letter. I thought it was going to be boring, but was surprised when even my "meat & potatoes" husband commented on how much he liked it. I served it with a simple salad, baguette and brie, and a nice merlot. A great summer-time meal...will make again!

This is a great pasta dish. We loved the hearty combination of potatoes and fettucine. I used a prepared pesto sauce and red potatoes with the skins on. I think it would also be good with some diced roma tomatoes added. I have already made this twice and will definitely be making it again!

I didn't know it was possible to have bland pesto. I used fresh basil from my garden and after reading the other reviews I weighed it to make sure I had the proper amount. I think there is a missing ingredient 8 ounces of salt. That was the only thing that made it edible was adding a bunch of salt. I liked the green beans and would use this idea with another pesto in the future.

This is a good combination. I like it.

Try bagging the spuds and adding pine nuts. Also, fresh-grated parmigiano-reggiano mixed in with the pesto, beans and pasta with more to pass is a must. Option: as above, but add diced canned Roma tomatoes for color and sweetness.

I made a number of substitutions. No walnuts in the pesto. Did not peel the red potatoes; cooled them slightly after cooking and then sliced. Used penne instead of fettuccine. Used half-and-half instead of pasta water. Will definitely make this again. May try it with just potatoes, or just pasta instead of both.

My family devoured this recipe. I would definetly make it again. I used frozen long green beans. It was very hearty and filling.

Something is wrong with this pesto recipe. It is very bland. I think the recipe calls for too much basil. Use store bought pesto or another pesto recipe that you like and it would be good.

I used store bought pesto which I usually enjoy. With this recipe it was tasteless. I added the pasta water but still found it dry and blah.

I tried this the first time with store bought pasta, and I thought it was good. I made the homeade pasta this weekend and doubled the recipe for a dinner party, and everyone really,really liked it. The pesto is delicious. Served it with the grapefruit salad in BonApetit April 2000, rosemary foccacia, and lots of red wine. It was an easy vegetarian main dish.

I couldn't find fresh basil, so I used purchased pesto. It was delicious, and I can only imagine it would be divine with fresh pesto.
