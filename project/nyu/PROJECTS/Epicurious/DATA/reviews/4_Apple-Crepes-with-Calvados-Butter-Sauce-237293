Made these crepes gluten-free by substituting gluten-free pancake mix for the flour. The change had absolutely no effect on the results, which were incredibly light, thin, and delicious.

This is a rich dessert. It made 7 crepes, a goodly amount of sauce and a tiny bit of apples. I'd triple the apple quantity if I were to make it again. Yummy, but a lot of work for the small quantity. I'd make a double or triple recipe as all the parts can be made a few days ahead.

These are delicious, and were a hit at a dinner party. 2 crepes per person was enough. I didn't have calvados brandy, but plain brandy was good. It was great being able to make crepes and sauce the day before; stirring up the apples just before the party & rewarming at dessert time worked fine. This is a real keeper.

wow, what a fantastic recipe! using more cornstarch than flour makes these crepes so light and tasty! thank you, thank you, thank you, for posting such a fantastic (but rich, uff ;-)) recipe! on a side note: something in the crepe batter jellied up but then disolved after a while. not sure why...

I admittedly did not make the crepes, my husband used his own recipe, but did make the filling. I substituted rum for the brandy because I did not have any and it turned out fantastic. I also rolled some shredded manchego cheese in with the apples which turned the dish into a wonderful play on sweet and salty. Will defintly make these again!

This was fabulous! I used rum in place of apple brandy and my crepes turned out a little thick, but this was delightful to eat. I will definitely make it again.

Very good. Made all the parts ahead of time for easter brunch then reheated and served....everyone loved it. I wish I made more for leftovers. I used Granny Smith apples which worked well.

I am a fan of new recipes that involve apples so when I read about this one I knew I had to try it and now its a hit when I have the family over for dinner and my friends are always asking for the recipe!

I used Granny Smith Apples and substituted Brandy for the Calvados, as this is what I had on hand. The dish turned out wonderfully and all who tried it enjoyed it. All are anxiously awaiting the next time I make this recipe.

Oh My Gosh!! This was just wonderful. It just melted in your mouth. The only change I made from the original recipe was to use Granny Smith apples that I had on hand. Worked just fine. This will be high on my Must Make Again for Special Occasions short list.

I'm a pretty experienced baker but I've always been intimidated by the prospect of making crepes, and now I know why! They are TRICKY. I used up a lot of batter making failed crepes before I figured out the right temperature for my pan, the right amount of batter, how to get them OUT of the darn pan. Jeez louise. BUT the final result was absolutely delicious. I wouldn't recommend making this unless you have Calvados, it really elevates the dish (the main reason I tried). I sauteed my apples in slices rather than chopped, and I added a little caramel sauce, fleur de sel, and creme fraiche right before serving (the creme fraiche was a revelation, really added a wonderful creaminess). The other good thing is that you can assemble everything ahead of time, and just rewarm the filled crepes and drizzle on the sauce right before serving, so it's a good dinner party dessert. That is, if you can handle making the crepes, which I'm not sure I'll have the guts to tackle again very soon.....
