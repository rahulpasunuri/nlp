Too sweet and syrupy for my taste. I grew up on fruit soups and, although I have tried this twice and like the idea, this recipe somehow misses for me.

Fantastic! I searched multiple sites for a compote and settled on this one and am glad I did. I made it 2 days in advance and the flavors really melded together nicely. I dislike raisins, so used more tart dried cherries, dried blueberries and craisins. Served it as a side dish to a roasted turkey breast, but had left-overs as dessert. Try it-you'll like it!

Made this for a gourmet group and it was highly acclaimed by all. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. I'll definitely be making this for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas this year.

I have made this a couple of times before, and am planning on making it again this Christmas. Deceivingly delicious, rave reviews by those who tried it; My husband loves it. One change is that I always make it with Port though.

Loved this. It so easy to make and fast. HOWEVER: the recipe does not tell you to REMOVE the cinnamon sticks and good luck trying to fish out those whole cloves. I won't want to bite into one. I used ground cloves instead, 1/8 tsp because I find it a very strong spice.

I have made this on several occasions and it was enjoyed by all. I even won a "dessert competition" at a gathering of friends with this recipe.
