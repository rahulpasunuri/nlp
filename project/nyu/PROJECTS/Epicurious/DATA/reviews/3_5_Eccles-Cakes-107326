Everyone I served one of these tasty treats to was very pleased, some were quite enthusiastic. However, there were very few of these people because the recipe yields very little. Sadly, the ingredients are not the cheapest and I'm not sure this is worth the trouble of making again. Also, a tad rich. I'd go a little easier on all the sweet & spice. I'll just have it when I visit Europe one day.

A friend from the north of London gave this a rave review at a recent dinner party, saying these were the best he had ever had.
