I thought this was good, tasty, easy and a bit different. Next time, however, I would add more dill and would add some lemon zest. I would also make the mayo / sour cream proportions a bit more even, as i thought it could do with less mayo. It is good to make a day ahead to let the flavors develop. The cognac was a nice touch. All guests seemed to really like it. 2 lbs serves WAY more than 8. I bought a small 1/2 lb package and that was plenty.

So easy and quite tasty. I added a bit more dill to bring up the flavor. Took it to the party and the hostess saved the sauce to put on her smoked salmon and scrambled eggs the next day.

To the reviewer having trouble with a mortar and pestle on the carraway seeds, follow the other suggestion in the recipe: use a spice grinder. A Krups or other electric coffee mill used exclusively for spices will solve all your problems.

I've made this dish every year since it was published. I still have trouble grinding the caraway seeds though...when I mash them, they just move around the bowl in tact!! Any suggestions?

Not sure what the fuss is all about. The sauce was good, but not fabulous. The salmon was fabulous though. I'll try the cilantro sauce (on this website) next.

This is one of our all-time favorites. We make our own smoked salmon and the sauce is wonderful with it. A four-star recipe!

First I thought I could grind the caraway seeds in the Cuisinart. NO! I acquired a mortar and pestle and did it again. Fabulous! It was also delicious with some leftover beef.

This was good but the mayo sauce had a very odd taste. Maybe because I used fat free sour cream, but I had to add a lot of lemon juice and extra dill. I sprinkled some capers on top of each toast which was a nice touch.

This was outstanding and very easy to prepare. The mayo sauce really made this dish complete. I'll make it again and again, especially since the holidays are coming up.

This was really delicious... I served it at a party and it disappeared quickly, with lots of praise. The mayonnaise is wonderful - I'd love to have some in the fridge all the time.

I inverted the amount of mayonnaise and sour cream to create more of a creme fraiche and added minced shallots.

caraway seeds gave this recipe a unique flavor.
