I couldn't imagine anything better than the standard Caprese salad, but this recipe made me a believer! The addition of grilled tomatoes to the EVOO and white wine vinegar made such a tasty difference! The first time I made the recipe, my eggplant got quite a bit darker than I would have liked. I normally grill eggplant to a golden brown and figure it's ready when the flesh is just tender. This time it was charred, as the recipe instructs, and almost creamy in texture. It tasted out-of-this-world good! The second time I made the recipe, I took the eggplant off the grill before it was charred (almost black) and the salad suffered for it. I used 2 large red heirlooms instead of 1 large plum tomato for the sauce, served the red sauce over sliced yellow heirlooms (naturally lower in acid) and like the recipe best that way. If I could give the recipe 5 stars, I would!

Phenomenal recipe. I served this to a group of six and it was all gone! The vinaigrette was to die for. Even my eggplant hating husband ate this! Very unique and tasty. I'll definitely make it again!

Great alternative to traditional caprese salad! We had purple basil and it looked awesome! Next time we'll double the vinaigrette, because it was such a great compliment. I'll make it for other salads too.

I love this recipe--we use it as a light dinner when we don't have much time to cook in the summer! I especially love the basil vinaigrette.

I would give this five forks if I could. Don't ask me how they took a caprese salad and made it seem so much more specail but they did. It is AMAZING. Period!!!

I loved this! I did make some changes for available ingredients and practicality--took it to a carry-in BBQ. Using red pepper-infused olive oil kicked it up a notch. My version + photo here: http://cloudscudding.livejournal.com/689881.html

Fantastic!!! Fantastic!!! I used red and yellow tomatoes plucked right out of my patio garden, and it was beyond delicious, and such a simple summertime meal. I paired it with the Grilled Oregano shrimp.... really, it was a perfect meal, and I will definitely make it again.

GREAT recipe....but any nice, fresh homegrown tomatoes work swell; the "heirloom" thing can get tiresome.......the "moniker du jour" this summer in the food rags is "heirloom". God willing, it will be replaced shortly with a new fad.

Superb! Easy to make and beautiful presentation. I also used the grilled tomato sauce to flavor some orzo. I have made this recipe twice. Be sure to use good olive oil and enough salt and pepper on the eggplant.

This was an excellent dish. The tomato should be grilled as it imparts such a great flavor into the vinaigrette. I made this recipe exactly as written and would not change a thing. A keeper!!!

Fantastic side; fresh, easy, really flavourfull. I agree with the previous reviewer that one could skip the grilling of the tomato and just blanch the skin off- but I definitely wouldn't omit the tomato as it added a good tang to the dressing.

This was surprisingly filling and the dressing was perfect. I think you could skip broiling the tomato and simply use boiling water to remove the skin.
