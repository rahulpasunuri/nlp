It was very easy and simple to make. I did make some revisions. I substituted 1/4 of the ricotta cheese for firm tofu crumbled and also blended in 2 cups of steamed spinach. I didn't have fresh basil so I substituted 1 tbsp dried and added 1/2 tbsp dried oregano. All and all yummy and tasty.

Wonton wrappers are a must. I like making variations on the filling -- did pine nuts and spinach, and also carmelized shallots and portabello mushrooms, and also olives with whatever you'd like. Your imagination is the limit. These freeze well too - use wax paper to separate each layer of ravioli.

I thought this was quite good. I did add a few additioal herbs to the filling because I thought it would be to bland otherwise. I added oregano, parsley and chives. Also, I used a 15 oz. can crushed tomatoes with mushrooms and green peppers for the sauce instead of just cut peeled tomato, I believe this gave the sauce more substance. I will make this again. Note: Recipe calls a serving 6 ravioli, that's not much. Figure at least 8-10 ravioli per serving.

I really enjoyed this recipe.I used wonton wrappers, and substituted about 2 tabelspoons of parsley for the basil (I didn't have any on hand). I also threw in a little mozarella cheese that had been grated.

I thought this was way too much work for such bland ravioli. The dough called for was much too thin and didn't hold up well - I will not be making this again.

I used wonton wrappers (not sure of the difference) and we thought it was very tasty, and it didn't take very long to make. I would deffinately make it again.

The thin gyoza dough is interesting, but you may prefer a thicker dough.

This was easy and good. If I made it again I would use a bit less garlic and I love garlic!
