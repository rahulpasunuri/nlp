Yummy, plus quick and easy to prepare. Definitely needed more spice, though, so I put out a bottle of hot sauce...

This is a wonderful dish. It's very filling, has an excellent texture owed to the okra, very flavorful, and doesn't taste or feel heavy. It's definitely being added to my repertoire.

As many people have said, this is a whats in the fridge recipe. I added celery, chilis and garlic and then went to the spice cabinet for chili powder, worcester sauce, cumin, and white pepper. Went with shrimp but no scallops. Rice was done faster than recipe. All in a great recipe to add your own touch to.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this easy recipe. The question always is: "Would we serve this to guests?" The answer here is: Absolutely! I made a few tweaks... couldn't get Andouille sausage so I used Linguica, which is easy to find at my local (brazilian-friendly) grocery store. Scallops were expensive so I doubled up on the frozen shrimp -- which I only cooked for maybe 6 minutes. Added carrots and celery; used cubanelle instead of bell peppers. Added some smoked paprika and 2 bay leaves. I thought the rice was done after about 25 minutes, so my recipe was about 10 minutes faster than expected. Looking forward to the leftovers!

One of our favorites. Comforting and delicious. For those that love both Gumbo and Jambalaya

I had to join just to review this recipe! I've made it for my husband since we were dating, and he's always excited when I tell him "Spicy Gumbo-laya for dinner tonite." I use the recipe more as a guideline, so it's different every time, but usually several meats, and lots of veggies over a bowl of rice. So yummy!

I have made this a number of times and each time I tweak it a little depending on what I have available but two things always remain... the andoulie sausage and the shrimp. The flavor combination is amazing! Also if you want to make gumbo or jumbalaya you gotta use okra. It acts as a thickener (so you dont need to make a roux) and it adds a nice sublte flavor. This is a great blend of two classic recipes and is sure to be enjoyed by anyone, except for those pretentious Martha-wannabee food snobs who are too above the rest of us to try something like this. This is a perfect recipe for a cold afternoon when you want to leave a pot of food warming on the stove a stay curled up on the sofa under a blanket in front of the TV or with a good book with a hearty bowl of something delicious! Definitely worth a try!

This wound up being a tasty dish, but it required a little work. I added the flour right after removing the chicken and sausage, then stirred until I achieved a decent roux. Now is the time to add the vegetables! I wasn't thrilled with the sausage links. Next time I will use something like a hot, smoked sausage. I don't crank the heat too much for the "tender of tongue," but I do make sure there is a bottle of Tabasco on the table. Bon appetit, y'all!

Okay, I haven't made this and I won't. Where's the roux? Where's the holy trinity (onion, celery and bell pepper)? Why would you want to make "gumbo-laya" in the first place when there are such good recipes for either gumbo or jambalaya out there? Just pick one. This recipe just sounds too mixed up.

This was great... I found it needed more liquid than the 3 cups of broth. Next time I would use andouille sausage, not Italian Sausage.. great comfort food.

Rating: 4
This is really quite a good "hybrid" recipe. I've made it twice; both times we enjoyed it very much. I've changed only the amount of broth and juices (increased by 1/2 cup) and the amount of spices (added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper to up the heat).

Made this dish tonight. Kinda bland for my taste, but OK. Needs some spices. Also, the recipe makes alot of gumbolaya... I didn't know that at first.

Rating: 4
I made this with no revisions except my market did not have scallops. They were decidely unnecessary. The flavors blended beautifully, the ingredients complemented each other perfectly and I found the consistency just right. I like to experiment and so on, but I would not change a thing about this recipe.

A nice "simplified" gumbo-laya but lacks depth without the browned roux. I did add an additional cup of broth and it was still a little thick. I also "borrowed" from my usual recipe and added 3/4 t. each of dried thyme, marjoram, and basil as well as 1 t. of worcestershire sauce. Didn't use the okra at all. Added 4 cloves of chopped garlic, and 2 large stalks of chopped celery to complete the "trinity" of veggies. Top with chopped scallions before serving.

This was delicious!!! Okay, I made a few revisions. Added 4 pressed cloves of garlic to the onion pepper mixture. Also changed one large green pepper to one medium green and one medium yellow. Just for color purposes. Upped the shrimp to a pound and added extra broth, because hubby likes it soupy. I think it turned out great. Looks to be wonderful left overs!!!

Very easy- it quickly became one of my "what's in the pantry/freezer" dishes!

This recipe is really good - with a few revisions. I have made it three times now. Once as written. Did not like the consistancy. Revised it some the second time and then made the best version the third time. I used cajun sausage in place of hot link. I added an additional bell pepper, a red one. Also added about 6 garlic cloves (big ones, chopped), 1 T dried basil and 1/2 teaspoon grd. cayenne with the peppers. I replaced the flour with gumbo file, added another can of diced tomatoes and an extra 1 1/2 cups of broth. Doubled the shrimp, added two catfish fillets cut in cubes. Cooked the rice seperately to serve in bowl under gumbo. I think this is a really good base recipe to play around with if you are not that familiar with this kind of cuisine. My dinner guest loved it and my family said great but more cayenne next time. We love spicy. Enjoy

Great recipe, very simple and can be altered in a lot of ways. I added celery and garlic and omitted the scallops. I also used pre-grilled chicken because I was running late, but it still tasted great.

So easy to make! I used chorizo and added some crabmeat--was very popular at last night's cajun-themed potluck dinner.

Really good and very easy! I skipped the shrimp and scallops, and used chorizo. I also needed a little extra chicken broth to get the rice fully cooked.

Rating: 3
Simple, filling and good. We omitted the scallops in favor of adding more chicken and used smoked ham instead of sausage. I found that it was not spicy enough for our taste so added ground white pepper and tabasco as well as cayenne. This freezes very well, also.

This is so good!

This has incredible flavor. Like some of the other respondents, I made some substitutions. Used ham instead of sausage, since it was leftover from New Years, also forgot to buy okra, so used celery in it's place (added it with the peppers/onions). Also used half a red pepper with half of a green one for more color. Upon completion, the dish doesn't look wonderful, but it sure does taste good! This will be one of our regular cool weather meals.

This dish was "Fantabulous" as one of our dinner guests said. Serve it with warm crusty french bread to help mop up your bowl!

This was AWESOME!!! I made it with Chorizo sausage, and as another reviewer suggested, I sprinkled Emeril's essence on the Chicken before cooking it. It was just incredible. I brought it to a friends house for an informal gathering, and they all LOVED it so much! Everyone asked for the recipe!

A warm and hearty meal! Easy to make and impossible to mess up. I'm never exact with measurements and occasionally substitute catfish for chicken, but this recipe turns out super every time.

I may have stirred it too much, as it was kind of risotto-like, but nonetheless my husband and I both thought this was delicious. It was also fun to make. I used Adelle's andouille sausage and fresh sea scallops. Next time I would increase the chicken (which was exceptional)and decrease the scallops, and save a buck or two without diminishing the result.

This is a great and easy recipe. I used andouille sausage and substituted shrimp for the scallops (too slimey for my taste). My husband is quite a connoisseur of creole food and he loved it. In the winter I make it at least twice a month!

Yummy!!

This was wonderful. I used a red pepper instead of green, and a can of roasted-garlic seasoned tomatoes. I browned a few cloves of chopped garlic in the oil, and seasoned all the meat and seafood with homemade Emeril's essence. I think it's a must to flavor the shrimp, scallops and chicken with something. This made the dish sufficiently spicy, so I did not add the cayenne at the end. We had Dos Equis with dinner to tame the heat. My husband ate three bowls of this stuff, and we were both very impressed. I'll definitely make this again.

This made a huge hit! Great for guests, you can even make it the night before and spend more time with your guests. They have requested it so much, I'm making it again next week!

I made this dish for my class of international students. We had just finished reading Ernest Gaines' book, "A Lesson Before Dying" and gumbo was featured prominently, but none of them had ever tasted it. They all loved it! They come from Turkey, Laos, Japan, Mexico, Ukraine and many other countries, but all found it delicious, even the okra! I left out the scallops and used andouille sausage. I also used both red and green peppers for a bit more color. I cooked and served the rice separetly so it wouldn't thicken too much. I will definetly make this again.

Liked this a lot!! Didn't have scallops or okra. Substituted red pepper and andouille sausage. Added cajun seasoning with rice, and preseasoned the chicken and shrimp. Also, need some extra water while rice simmering. Oh what a dish! Next time need to add more color, everything was red.

Wonderful dish. My husband and I didn't mind eating this two nights in a row. I didn't have shrimp or okra but we didn't miss them at all! Delicious!

This is one of the best dinners I've made! I used 1lb. of shrimp, and the specified chicken and sausage (we don't care for scallops) and it was perfect. I added quite a bit of cayenne pepper, and didn't add any okra or substitute for it. I will make this again and again - it was absolutely delicious. It would be a great dish to have for guests because all of the work can be done in advance!

I used red pepper instead of green, and next time I'll substitute green pepper for the tasteless okra. I also used Ro-tel chopped tomatoes & chiles to add even more flavor - very good!

We loved this recipe! I substituted peas for orka because the kids don't care for it. The spiciness was just right. You can always make it hotter with hot sauce. It tastes even better the next day.

This was absolutely fabulous! The cost of the ingredients was definitely worth it. I've made this twice and my husband said it's the best thing I've ever made. Leftovers are great, too!

The cost of the scallops and shrimp make this a pricy dish, but it goes so far it's a bargain. I used Emeril's Bayou Blast rather than just cayenne. Definitely a good dish.

Great dish, and good to customize. Try adding a dark beer, or white wine, in partial place of the chicken broth. Red bell pepper is a nice color addition, as are carrot and celery. I prefer sea scallops, and lobster or crab meat is also good. I've even added catfish chunks, goes well with the cayenne sauce.

The first time I made this for my boyfriend, he didn't stop talking about how great it was for several weeks. I have since made it several times. I substitute chicken breasts for the thighs, I don't use scalops but use about 1 lb shrimp and I also throw in cajun seasoning I bought in New Orleans.

Cajun goodness..... I guarantee it!!

I made a few adjustments. Substituted 1 1/2 # andouille for the hot links, and substituted 1/2# tasso for the shrimp. I used a cup of converted rice, next time I'll use about 1 1/2 cups. I browned a few cloves of minced garlic with the oil at the outset, and included Tabasco and Lea & Perrins Worcestershire when the tomatoes were added.

Very good, and there is a lot of room for midifications. I used file instead of okra for thickner, added a few additional spices and used crab meat instead of scallops and it was till great. I like the flexibility and the simplicity. I am likely to make this recipe again.

This is an outstanding recipe that you can take liberties with. In south LA we have such an abundance of different seafood you can substitute most any of them for the clams without fear of ruining the original recipe.

I loved it and my friends loved it. For my first time making it, it came out just perfect. And I'm definitely going to make it again and again and again. I love this website. Everytime I have a gathering I look up recipes to see what I can cook up next.
