The cake is delicious. I didn't make the frosting to put on top of it, and it ended up tasting more like a coffee cake than anything else. As I write, I ate a tester piece with a cold glass of milk and it really hit the spot. The middle of my cake fell, though... have yet to determine whether that's cause I didn't cook it long enough or something else. I put the crumble in as the recipe suggested and it all sunk to the bottom of my cake anyhow.In any case, this was a delicious treat.

I only made the frosting. It was deee-lish. Held up very very well to piping, even on a pretty humid day in NYC.

Give me a break---lots of work? No. The frosting was delicious and the cake had an unusual flavor, but not strange. It was more of a picnic cake or coffee cake, I'll agree with that. It is very rich, so the pieces can be sliced very small...it would serve a crowd. I frosted it when it was just barely warm, which may be why I didn't have any problem with dryness. I also used nonfat milk with good results.

We liked this. It definitely benefits from being made ahead--flavors blend and, as other reviewers observe, seems more moist the next day. The unfrosted cake is only moderately sweet with a rather heavy crumb--more like a coffee cake than a dessert cake. Thanks to the magic of cream cheese, the icing is glossy, easy to work with, and stays firm even when the cake is not refrigerated. Other reviewers are right that half the icing called for is more than enough. To avoid the possibility of "weird" flavor, I eliminated the clove and used only 1/4 tsp. of allspice. I made only half the icing and substituted 2 squares of melted unsweetened bakers chocolate for the semisweet chocolate in the icing recipe with very good results. To make the icing quickly and easily, place all ingredients in the food processor and mix until well blended.

I thought that for all the work, this recipe should have been much better. The cake is rather dry and without much character. However, the frosting is great. As I type, there's a whole pan of cake sitting in my kitchen that I'll probably end up getting rid of. Not a keeper.

I enjoyed this cake, especially the frostin but it wasn't a big hit with my family. I think the flavors were a bit odd together. There are other cakes I would make ahead of this one.

This cake was easy to make and delicious. But, it was a little dry the night we had it - the next day it was much more moist and flavourful. I wouldn't refrigerate it after frosting... there was still a chill on it even after pulling it out an hour before serving. The ingredients for the chocolate frosting could be cut in half.

Although this cake was very tasty and everyone liked it, it was a lot of work. Perhaps it is just that the recipe calls for a lot of unnecessary steps, like adding the flour in stages -- but I did not leave any out, so it took a long time.

I got this cake presented to me on my birthday instead of a typical "cake" along with the recipe, and it was definitely a nice treat! I ate it for breakfast, too!

can this cake be made into 2 round 9" pans instead of a 13x9x2" rectangle pan? I am going to make this for my birthday cake and I am just curious. Thank you

I made this as a birthday cake for a crowd and received rave reviews. It is very portable and serves a lot of people because it is quite rich.

This is a delicious cake! Everyone loved it. One suggestion: cut the glaze recipe in half. I ended up with a tubful of the stuff after glazing the cake.
