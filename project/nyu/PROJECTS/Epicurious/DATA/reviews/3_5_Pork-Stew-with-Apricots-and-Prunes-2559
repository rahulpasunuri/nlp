fantastic smell :) I too used rosemary instead of coriander, beef stock for the chicken, and no apple juice. added a splash of apple cider vinegar at the end. we are currently dieting, but I think it would be amazing with egg noodles. or mashed potatoes.

very solid, very tasty. have done this twice to great reviews both times. made it without prunes and without apple juice, fearing the sweetness that others mentioned, and it was fine. I did use guiness extra stout for the beer. if you use pork shoulder as called for, you can leave some extra fat on the meat when you butcher it up; this cooks so long it renders and makes the dish richer. I served it on top of quinoa, which gave a nice poppiness/crunch to contrast such a soft, mellow dish

I have to say I was expecting more from this given the four fork rating and such glowing feedback from lots of cooks. This was good but not exceptional. I made a few adjustments like replacing half a cup of cider with beer, but generally followed the recipe. Even with it being slightly less sweet, one of my sons said it was like pork in prune juice. I also would have liked some vegetables to add to this. Interestingly, this recipe is from 1991. To my taste I think it is a bit dated. All in all, it is OK but don't think you are going to blow folks away. I think there are better options out there.

We love this dish and prepare it every few months. The darker the beer, the better, and we use prunes only. Better still on the second day.

Lovely tasty dish and very easy to make. Left out the apricots, using just the prunes a handfull of dried cherries for good measure. Substitued dark beer for port and used apple juice instead of cider (on reflection i think the cider would add a little more oomph than the juice itself) I thought the sauce was a little bland when i took the pot from the oven after the first hour and added a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and some star anise - really transformed it. The star anise complimented the asian style flavours of this dish perfectly! Served with Jasmine rice - delish!

Made this for a cold november supper and found it to be delicious. Made a couple of small subs. I used a blackberry porter instead of beer and apple cider and added about 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar and a tbsp dried rosemary instead of coriander (just don't like like coriander!) We served with an Aussie Semillon Chardonnay, crusty bagette and green salad. Loved it!!

This dish was a little on the sweet side but we added fresh grated Parmesan cheese to the top and that cut the sweetness somewhat. I served it over egg noodles with cornbread and cole slaw as sides. Yummy! The next time I make it I think I will reduce the amount of apricots and prunes, hence reducing the sweetness somewhat. Very tasty dish though!

My husband and I loved this dish - I thought it was very easy to prepare and the flavors were perfect as written. I added about 2 cups of cubed butternut squash (steamed ahead of time) during the last 1/2 hour of cooking time which complemented the pork very well.

Rating: 4
This a great recipe that as a culinary student made for a final but found switching the prunes for figs and the beer with and good port red wine is a fablous combination the sweet fruit and the savory pork just make a great combination! Try it this way or mine both are great.

Rating: 3
Too sweet. It was good; the meat was tender, the stew was thick, the flavors good, but it was too sweet. I wouldn't put in the apple juice next time and add apple cider vinegar next time and more beer.

A HUGE disappointment and it took a lot of prep time. Would advise moving on to a different recipe for sure. Very bland.

SOOOOO tasty! And so easy to make too. My husband and I loved this and I will definitely make it again - a completely unique flavour and very different to any other stews I've made before. Some changes I made were to use olive oil instead of the butter and veg oil, also had no apricots or prunes in (duh!) but threw in some dried cherries and golden sultanas instead. On further cupboard rummaging I found and added a sprinkling of crystallized ginger pieces and some left over flaked almonds - yum. Oh, and I don't think it matters if you use dark beer or not (I used Bass, a good old English pale ale).

Rating: 4
Spectacular and easy! My fussy parents loved it and had seconds (something they almost never do!). I did use white wine for the cider as I was out, but I added a little more dark ber (the whole 12 oz bottle) and added 1/4C chopped dried apples along with the prunes and apricots. I used beef broth (homemade) rather than chicken broth. Cooked up in a crock pot it was a welcome meal on a foggy cool day. We served it with the bread, it works great to wipe the bowls clean!

Made this for the rest home where I work. Everyone loved it & all the plates came back empty - thumbs up from all 35 residents.

I made the recipe as written and thought it was great. I was trying to ditch some cider after Christmas and when I saw pork and dried fruit I was sold. I served it to friends with mashed potatoes. Creamy polenta might be nice as well. Make it for friends during the fall or winter. You can sit and chat by the fire while it cooks away unattended. What could be better?

Rating: 3
I liked this & rated it accordingly but my family voted no because of its sweetness. I used scant 3/4 c. of both fruits & it seemed right. No apple juice in pantry so upped dark beer a bit (12 oz). We are on no carbs currently, & I think my family would have enjoyed it more if it was paired w/mashed potatoes w/chives or something similar. Cooking time was right for the 4 lbs pork shoulder I used.

Rating: 3
A terrific winter dish that is lighter than a typical stew. One key is to make sure to use the darkest beer possible - an amber ale won't work. Also, try adding in some dried cherries to the dried fruit in the recipe.

This is a simple, easy-to-make and fun-to-eat dish. Served with home-baked bread and a simple green salad, as suggested, it made a satisfying dinner. I followed the recipe, but cut it in half; I next will make it for guests. I also followed the advice of the previous reviewer by sprinking the cubed pork with spices (see below), but the dish would have been as good without it, I suspect. I did cut back on the proportionate amount of apricots, as many reviewers suggested, and will do so a bit more (to reduce the sweetness) next time around. A very good stew, readily recommended.

Rating: 4
It seems odd somehow to suggest changes in a recipe to which I've just awarded four stars, but I DO suggest cutting back the apricots to 3/4 C. to reduce the sweetness of the stew a tad. And, even more strenuously, I urge cooks to try the marriage of this recipe and elements from another 4-star pork stew (Pork Stew with Fennel and B'nut Squash). Specifically, toss the four pounds of trimmed pork shoulder with a mixture of 2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. dried sage, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg (more???), 1/4 tsp. ginger(more???)--and maybe even a timid pinch of cayenne. Set aside for 10 minutes or so and proceed with browning the pork. I think you'll like the results!

Rating: 3
Great recipe! it does turn out on the sweeter side, though, so keep that in mind if you decide to make it. I did not have a dutch oven, so I made the whole stew on the stove top, and it turned out fine (the pork still came out tender). I cooked it for 1 hr at medium low and then uncovered for about 15-20 minutes - you can vary this based on how thick you'd like it to be. Enjoy!!!

Rating: 3
I had some pork tenderloin left over from a so-so meal the night before, and it worked well in this. I accidentally doubled the cinnamon and coriander. I wouldn't recommend doing that. I also only had apricots-- my advice is, don't make it unless you can have both prunes and apricots, as just apricots was a little monotonous. And...well, the dried fruit...had its common side effects, let's just say. Be warned. But it was very tasty, and easy too!

I made this for my husband and I for dinner last night. My daughter in law stopped in and ended up staying for dinner. We all loved this dish. As recommended by others, I served it over mashed potatoes and had white shoepeg corn on the side. Wow, what a comfort food dish. Because I had all the ingredients on hand but the beer, I too used white wine as another reviewer had done. I made one mistake and instead of Dijon mustard I pulled out a jar of Mailles Horseradish Dijon and didn't notice my mistake until I was done. If it made a difference I don't know because it was soooooooooo YUMMY. I'll definitely use this recipe again - we have a large family and this would be a perfect make ahead for a casual football Sunday when all the gangs here.

This was fabulous and a hit with both husband and 3 year old. I added 1/4 teas ginger. Because others had said it was too sweet, I used 1 cup cider and 1 1/2 cups dark beer. Served it over mashed potatoes one night and rice the next. This is a recipe I will use and share

This dish smelled so good, but tasted only OK. It was too sweet and as another reviewer mentioned, it lacked a depth of flavor. The apricot flavor dominated the stew -- it could have used more spices, and maybe beef broth instead of chicken. Something just seemed missing, like we were just eating a bowl of apricot soup with pork in it. It also is quite drab to look at, if I were to make it again, I would add some peas/carrots for some color. I had high hopes for this dish, but was rather disappointed. I'll keep looking at these reviews though, to see if anyone has ideas to punch it up -- it does seem like there is potential for a really tasty stew, this recipe just doesn't quite get there.

When the first words out of my spouse's mouth are "It's a keeper!", I know I've done something wonderful. This dish is easy to prepare, with wonderful flavour and not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be. Great company dish too, as it's completely do-ahead. The meat was VERY tender, but I wish I'd added more of it. There was, however, a certain lack of depth to the flavour which I think I can correct next time, though. I'll add dark beer rather than light (all I had on hand) and possibly caramelize the onions & garlic rather than just sauteeing. I don't know if sitting in the fridge overnight will help flavours meld - I'll let you all know after I have the leftovers tonight. :)

Delicious. I made it with only two changes: I substituted white wine for the beer, as I don't like cooking with beer, and I left out the prunes to cut down the sweetness. I served it with roasted potatoes.

Last winter, we hosted a wine tasting (Sauvignon Blancs (New Zealand vs. US) and Zinfandels (Ridge vs. Rosenblum) for about 30 guests followed by dinner. We served this pork stew over mashed potatoes -- great with the Zin. A year later, we're hosting the main course of a progressive dinner for a crowd of real "foodies" using this dish. This recipe is easy to prepare, crowd pleasing winter comfort food -- an absolute winner.

This is simply delicious. Served it with rice on the side, but I think it would be wonderful also with roasted root vegetables as another reviewer noted, or with mashed potatoes (even atop the potatoes). My friends all loved it.

This dish is simply superb....easy to prepare and filled with wonderful flavor. Since my family are devout prune haters, I use a combination of apricots, sweetened cranberries and dried apples for the fruit. I now bring copies of the recipe when I make it for friends....since they ALWAYS ask!

Definitely a keeper. Relatively easy to make and the meat ends up so tender and with such a great flavor. Despite some initial hesitation on the recipe I found the prunes and apricots to be a perfect match for the pork.

Rating: 4
This recipe, as written is spectacular. I have made it for company many times and everyone loves it. Most of my friends and family would never eat apricots voluntarily, let alone prunes! The recipe is simple but somewhat time consuming so I'll usually double or triple it to get best value for my time.

I've made this dish many times, it also freezes well, so I make a double batch and have some for a later meal. I usually do a side of roasted root vegetable with this.

I really loved this dish, as did my whole family. I will definitely make it again. Served it over brown rice once, and noodles the second night. Liked it both ways. One thing I changed was that I did not use pork shoulder, and wasn't sure how much meat would come off a 4 lb. pork shoulder. I decided to use 2 lbs. of boneless pork cubed, and the stew came out exactly right.

Loved this recipe, though my husband carefully set aside all the prunes. I may experiment with the spices in future, but the basic idea of broth + cider + beer is a winner.

My search for a great pork stew has ended here! This is so good and easy to make! I used a leaner cut the second time and as always doubled the spices. I serve it over noodles but to soak up the sauce, french bread is a must!

This is absolutely fantastic! I used hard apple cider (6% alcohol) in place of the apple juice and beer, and doubled the amount of coriander and cinnamon - it still needed a little more coriander. I didn't have Dijon so I used regular mustard, it'll be even better with Dijon... The sauce was a little thin after the stated cooking times, and I thought there was an awful lot, but after tasting it, just serve it with a lot of bread because you won't want a drop of the wonderful gravy to go to waste! Beautiful! This is definitely finding it's way into my regular repertoire.

I loved the unusual flavor of this stew. My guests commented on how wonderful dinner smelled the moment they entered my home. I served this over rice but you definitely don't need the rice. I added a bit more apricots and prunes, which I think over did it a bit. Next time I will stick to the amounts called for in the recipe.

Very tasty. Could use a little more coriander. I ended up using more apricots also. Great served over rice.
