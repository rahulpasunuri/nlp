My meat wasn't quite 2 inches thick, so I only cooked it for 16 minutes at 450. It was already medium at that point. So, if you like your meat rare, I would suggest reducing the cooking time.

The rub overpowered the flavour of the meat. Too much coriander for my taste.

I used this recipe with some think tenderloin slices. It was excellent, even with the longer cooking time it was perfect and the spices made the whole house smell fantastic. Even my picky husband LOVED it, so it is a definite keeper.

Excellent way to enjoy a steak and so easy to prepare and impress your guests.

Just used a store prepared rub which worked great. Recommend keeping a close watch on time. I roasted the steaks in convection oven and they were "Medium" in 20 Minutes.

I've made this twice and loved it both times. I served it to guests both times and they both wanted the recipe. I can't wait to try it on pork or chicken.
