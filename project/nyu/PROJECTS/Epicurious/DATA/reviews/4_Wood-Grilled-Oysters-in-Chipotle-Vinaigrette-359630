This exceptional chipotle vinaigrette perfectly complements the grilled oysters. So easy and a hit with our party of 10. After these as appetizers, we made several amazing dishes from Hudson's on the Bend restaurant in Austin (http://www.hudsonsonthebend.com/) ... Hot and Crunchy Trout, and Jicama and Tomatillo Salad in particular. Thumbs up all around.
