I used it over broccoli slaw and added feta cheese to the top of the salad for some creaminess.

Nice twist on slaw. I thought it would be too hot, but I made the dressing exactly as written, and it was not too spicy at all. This is a light & delicious slaw. I served it with grilled chicken & eggplant, and it was good. I'll make it again.

I used the dressing on pre-shredded broccoli slaw; it was a nice summer salad. I did add about 2 tbsps of honey--I think the dressing needs something sweet to offset the heat. Good dish to have with grilled foods.

This sounded so good, but in the end came up a bit lacking.

Nice change from the usual creamy slaws. No need to be precise with ingredients -- any amounts (of the veggies) would work well.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and everyone loves it. I prefer a bit of sweetness in my coleslaw so I add about a half cup of pineapple tidbits.
