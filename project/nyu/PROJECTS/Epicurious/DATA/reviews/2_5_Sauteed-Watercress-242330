Always looking for a way to eat more leafy greens. The flavor was good, but watercress has tough stems that are pretty chewy. (The previous "livestock" comment is really funny!!!). Still worth making it for some variety in the diet...

Worst green I have ever cooked. The stems were tough. Perhaps this would be a wonderful side if you were livestock!

I loved this spin on watercress. It's cheap to make, easy, and has a delicious kick to it. I left out the coriander because I didn't have any, but everything else worked perfectly. My boyfriend could've sworn he hated watercress until I made this recipe.

eh, just ok. I love fresh watercress so much that I didn't really care for it wilted.
