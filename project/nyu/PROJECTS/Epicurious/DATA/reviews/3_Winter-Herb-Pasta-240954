This is just ok. Used whole wheat fettucine. You don't need very much of the pasta water at all - too much will make it soggy and watery. I also used about a third of the breadcrumbs. More would have been overwhelming. Good way to use up extra fresh herbs.

I thought it definitely needed salt (though my wife disagreed) and it was easy enough to add. I did add a pinch or two of crushed red pepper to the oil as it heated before adding the herbs because I like that kind of thing. I'm happy to have this recipe in my collection.

This recipe was disappointing. It was bland, and I felt like someting was missing. I have since decided that salt was missing, and possibly some other spices (maybe chili powder) to give it a little kick. I added lots of vegetables, and that made it better. I would definitely make it again because it could be amazing with a few changes.

Did not like at all...my family loves pasta (all types) but this was not good.

Do yourself a favor and make the fresh breadcrumbs. They make a wonderful difference.

I had very good luck with this dish, but I did some alterations based on some of the comments here. I added slightly more garlic and spices than called for. Also, there is no salt in this recipe, so I added at the end to taste. Bread crumbs did not remain crunchy once I added the reserved pasta water. Overall I am very pleased with this recipe. It is a simple, rich, and hearty dish loaded with savory flavors from the fresh herbs.

This has become my new standby recipe if I get home late from work, since it is so quick to make and I usually have all the ingredients on hand. I have the first 3 herbs growing in my window garden and if I don't happen to have any fresh parsley, it is okay without it. The key is the bread crumbs sauted with the garlic. We eat a lot of fresh french baguettes, which go stale in a day so I save the crumbs for this recipe. I have used panko for substitution and it works okay. Don't leave out the cooking water at the end, it is too dry without it. I always keep a block of good parmesan (I mean GOOD parmesan, not the tasteless mass-produced stuff they sell in most groceries) in the fridge and it adds nice flavor to this dish.

Horrible recipe - breadcrumbs on pasta? A messy and labor-intesive recipe with a completely bland result.

I used really fresh herbs and bread crumbs made from homemade bread, and it was delicious - I think in a dish so simple, the quality of the ingredients matters. Be generous with the garlic, herbs and salt and you'll have no trouble with blandness, but in this case I don't think the flavors are intended to knock you over.

I get most of my recipes from Epicurious and I have never been let down until now. The ingredients smelled delicious while cooking...but when served, it lacked any sort of flavor. The bread crumbs absolutely killed it - no clue why it called for a cup and a half. I made it in the first place because it called for garlic -- but all the garlic got lost in the crumbs...which barely made it into the pasta at the end (because there was so much!). My husband and I were laughing at how awful it was. As a result of the bread crumbs, it tasted like fuzzy pasta. We tossed it and ended up eating pizza and cookies for dinner. It was a waste of time and money.

Bland if you follow the directions exactly, but add red chile flakes and fresh shrimp. Used half the butter, only 4 tbsp of oil, and did not add water from pasta. Topped with asiago cheese. Much better!

This was pretty good. The pasta you use is fun to eat. It's bigger than traditional spaghetti, so that makes it different. I made sure to season it enough. Good in a pinch. Also, I used Ians's Panko instead of breadcrumbs. Yum!

I was disappointed by how bland it tasted.. The herbs lacked any punch, perhaps I should have doubled the amount of herbs or added some fresh rather than cooked in the oil.

I thought the pasta could use less olive oil, due to the amount of pasta water added to the dish. I agree with others that the pasta was too bland, but think grilled chicken would greatly improve this dish.

This was really excellent. The herb flavors give such a nice essence. My husband loved this. It was just the two of us, so we had plenty leftover and we found that this pasta is not half as good reheated - so don't make extra for leftovers!

I was really disappointed in this dish. The texture was unappealing and the flavor or the herbs overwhelmed the dish. I was not pleased.

This wasn't as good as I'd hoped, but easy to make. My sons didn't think it had much flavor. I added some parmesan cheese and that gave it some needed flavor.

I thought this was a little bland, honestly. I used fresh herbs from my garden but 2 teaspoons didn't seem to be enough for the sage, rosemary, thyme. The breadcrumbs are great, however! I would make this again, but add more flavor, maybe even red chili flakes. Adding grilled chicken is a great idea too.

Didn't care for the rosemary other then that it was delicious.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a HUGE hit! Everyone seemed to love and and gave me great compliments! I loved how the four seasonings accented well with each other and the smell while I was cooking got everyones attention! ^_^

This dish is delicious! I also grilled herb-rubbed chicken and added that on top. It turned out really well and tasted amazing.

Wonderful pasta. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added 1/2 tsp. salt to the olive oil before adding the fresh herbs. The key to this recipe is the 1 cup of reserved SALTED pasta water (this is how the dish gets its salt seasoning). I used the entire cupful -- otherwise, the dish would have been unbearably dry. In an effort to keep it healthy, I used Barilla Plus spaghetti (the best, most natural tasting whole wheat pasta I've found on the market, so far).
