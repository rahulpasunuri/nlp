Delicious. Made it twice and second time even better with 1/2 cup of chopped dates, currants and dried bing cherries. 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. Bake at 300F in convection oven in a long and narrow bread pan. Baked for a little less than an hour.

Was surprised to find I had no currants but dried cranberries were a great substitute

Delicious! Next time I'll throw in some linseeds and maybe substitute a bit of the flour for whole wheat for a slightly heartier loaf.

The flavor of this bread is good but not memorable. The slices also tend to break apart, both because of the large amt of nuts (which I don't mind) and because of the "muffin method" of mixing the dry ingred just until moistened.

Nut lovers delight - toasted pecans are great. Bread has a nice rise and texture - not too light or dense. I did add an extra 1/4 cup flour (mixed separately with the nuts so I could sift the dry ingredients) since the dough seemed a little too loose to keep the nuts from settling to the bottom.
