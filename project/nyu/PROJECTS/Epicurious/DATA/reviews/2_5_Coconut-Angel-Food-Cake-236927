the sauce must make this recipe- the cake itself is dry and flavorless

This was my first attempt at an angel food cake and it came out wonderfully. It was requested by my boyfriend's grandmother, who unfortunately doesn't like coconut, so I had to omit the essence of the cake, but it was delicious regardless and simple to whip up. As to not waste the left over egg yolks I cooked them and gave them to my dogs so they had a treat from the cake too. I will certainly make this cake again trying out variations of sauces and extracts. It had a lovely light flavor and soft texture. Fast and yummy!
