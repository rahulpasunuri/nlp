I made this for a brunch and it was delicious! I added sliced mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions. I used a combination of whole and 2% milk. I cut the recipe in half and it worked out great; I think the baking time was 45 minutes to get it nice and brown on top. As a timesaver I also didn't do the layers--just mixed the bread with the spinach mixture and then poured the custard over it.

Delicious and easy! I used sharp cheddar cheese I had on hand instead of gruyere. Seems like a versatile enough recipe for some varations. Definitely a keeper!

This tasted very good, looked impressive and prepping it the night before makes it even better. I used regular grated swiss and it was good but gruyere would probably make it even better.

Fantastic recipe! Used only 7 eggs and Cheddar cheese, as that was all I had at home. Came out great. Also had no time to let it stand around for 8 hours. Can't imagine that this would have made it any better than it was. Even my son liked it

Outstanding strata recipe! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, which resulted in a light, fresh taste. Also used all of the cheese leftovers in my refrigerator instead of only gruyere.

This is a terrific recipe. I made this recipe with leftover challah bread. I thought it would be softer bread than the recipe calls for (french or Italian), so I put trays of cubed bread in the oven on 200 for about 45 minutes to dry them out. This worked beautifully - not a mushy souffle but a hearty, rich, easy to serve treat enjoyed by all. I used Jarlsberg instead of gruyere and fresh spinach instead of frozen. I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and filled one standard souffle dish and one deep dish ceramic pie plate. Superb recipe that I will make again.

GREAT recipe to adapt with what you have in the fridge. I used leftovers, scavenging in the fridge, and it was so tasty our weekend guests went back for seconds! Rapini, a mixture of cheeses and sourdough bread - I just followed the measurements and PRESTO a tasty breakfast treat. This one's a keeper.

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor. The perfect brunch dish. Be sure to leave the crust on the cubed bread! The two cheeses were salty enough--I don't think extra salt is needed. As other reviews commented, I used FRESH spinach (about 12 oz.) and sauteed it with the onions and 1 large clove of chopped garlic. Delicious.

THE WINNING BRUNCH RECIPE! If you're scouring Epicurious for a good egg strata, look no further. This is it. Made this for a "breakfast-for-dinner" party, and everyone raved. I incorporated the reviews below into the recipe, with stellar results. Following were my changes/subs: 1.) Sautee 2 sweet onions, thinly sliced, in 2 Tbsp. veg oil + 1 Tbsp. butter over med. heat until golden. Add 1 thinly sliced red bell pepper and sautee until soft. Add 6 oz. bag baby spinach and stir until wilted. Season with salt, pepper & nutmeg to taste. 2.) Cube bread, prep cheese and make egg mixture as specified in recipe. 3.) Layer in buttered baking dish: 4 c. bread cubes, then half of veggie mixture, half of cheese, then remaining bread cubes, veggies & cheese. Pour egg mixture on top, refrigerate and bake the next day exactly as recipe calls for. 4.) Call me if you have leftovers. Unlikely.

This strata was wonderful for Christmas breakfast. Made as written except doubled spinach and used two cups onion as suggested by other reviewers. Used an artisan Italian bread including crusts; the cubes weighed over 1/2 pound in order to achieve the 8 cups needed. The result was absolutely perfect with a crusty top and lovely custard.

This was fantastic! I also couldn't really layer my bread cubes because my dish was too shallow, but it didn't seem to matter - the strata was delicious and everybody loved it. I used sharp cheddar instead of the gruyere. This seems like a recipe that can handle a lot of tweaking depending on what you have on hand.

I made this recipe for a function and it was a huge hit. I only used regular parmesean cheese and only 1/2cup on top of the Gruyere. Used a glass oblong pirex dish and did not pre-grease with butter. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. No leftovers. Making again for my family this weekend.

This is a great recipe and I'm sure could be adapted in many ways. I added mushrooms after sauteeing the onion and I also used fresh spinach -lightly sauteed til wilted. Next time I may add some roasted red pepper mainly for color - it wasn't lacking in flavor! I also made only 2 layers and it was fine.

Raising the number of forks from previous review. This is such a durable recipe. I didn't have a 3 qt casserole so I split it between a 9x13 pan and an 8x8 pan. We had a change in guest count so only made the 8x8 the first day. It was Christmas morning and I mis-calculated when we'd be ready to eat so it sat for at 1 - 1 1/2 hours after it was cooked. It was great and looks so lovely with the lightly browned top. The remaining guests (delayed by snowstorms) arrived a couple of days later. The 9x13 pan had been sitting (uncooked) the whole time. We baked it and it was still fabulous. I'm about to test freezing another pan uncooked. I'll report how that turns out.

This was delicious and lighter (less rich) than expected. We doubled the spinach and added some duxelles (finely chopped sauteed mushrooms) that were left over from making a different recipe. The mushrooms were a great addition.

As suggested, I browned and added in a one pound roll of breakfast sausage. Delicious.

I just served this to my family. I substituted local cheeses and my homemade sourdough challoh for the bread. It was a tad bland but has promise. Don't stint on the fresh ground nutmeg. I'd use a sharper cheese next time and maybe use more salt and pepper. Looked and smelled amazing. Good way to use up leftover bread. Nice to have something ready to stick in the oven the following day...

Used leftover homemade focaccia, fresh spinach sauteed with the onions and smoked gouda, plus added about 1lb ital sausage. Didn't have enough eggs to make the night before so soaked the bread in the egg mixture while preparing everything else in the morning. Saoked for about 2hrs before baking and it turned out delicous!

Rating: 4
I added sausage to the spinach mix and it was very good. I did the three layers but the cook time wasn't enough - a little runny. So I served the portion around the outside and continued cooking. I took in for lunch the next day at work and it was delicious! I let mine soak a full day (made night before and served as a dinner). I think next time I'll do only two layers so it cooks in the recommended time. But I would make again.

I am the same "Cook from Buffalo" who posted below. I wanted to add that I froze leftover portions of the strata and the texture did improve after "sitting" in my freezer for a while (even though it had already been cooked). The recipe makes a huge amount, so freezing is a great option.

Easy, fast, and quite tasty. When I originally read the recipe, I missed the part about letting it sit for at least 8 hours. Because I was making it for a quick weeknight dinner, I just omitted that step and hoped for the best. It turned out just fine - though I imagine it would've been a little more "custard-y" and less "frittata-y" if I'd followed the directions.

This recipe came out beautifully; everyone at my break fast loved it! I did make a couple of changes, partly based on other people's comments: I added to the spinach quantity by using a pound of frozen, instead of gruyere I used 8 oz. of feta that was in my refrigerator, and I added fresh tomato to the spinach mix. I will definitely make this again!

I'm not sure why the former reviewer would have ended with a soggy dish. I used a country style whole wheat sourdough bread and I think that may have given it a little more body than a softer bread. This is a recipe that lends itself to a little tweaking, so next time I'll add extra spinach, mushrooms, a little more nutmeg and other flavorful cheeses.

At first I thought this recipe was daunting, intimidating. Not sure why. I've made it a handful of times and it's fabulous! I don't even reference the recipe anymore because I know it by heart. I've started to play around with the cheeses, though - anything smokey and nutty works. The suggested Gruyere and PR are great. Smoked gouda and Fontina are super as well. I've also added more to the spinach and onion mixture seeing as how there just didn't seem to be enough to go around for two layers. Compliments from everyone who's tried this at my table. Bravo!

Very, very good recipe. Everything about this is tasty and well balanced. I substituted marbled rye for the Italian bread because I forgot to pick it up at the store, but nonetheless really enjoyed it. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen. My last alteration was using smoked gruyere because it was $5 cheaper than the regular (and also my personal favorite). The smoked was incredible and I completely suggest it. I generally try to stick to the recipe the first time around but this dish is very forgiving. My one addition next time will be a meat of some kind, either bacon or sausage. Maybe bacon and chicken sausage&

I made this and like everyone else--it was a huge hit. i made a couple of adjustments and added a few of my own touches. I added sauteed red bell pepper and sliced baby bell mushrooms and a little garlic to the spinach/onion mixture---i also used fresh organic spinach which i wilted down. I also toasted some pine nuts (about 3/4 cup) and threw those in and they added great flavor. And for cheese, I had some Boursin in the fridge so I crumbled that in as well instead of the parm---that was the biggest hit!

I made this for brunch this weekend. AMAZING!! Everyone raved. Unlike a few other stratas I've tried, the top of this is so nice and crispy, and the bread doesn't taste soggy at all. SOOO DELICIOUS!!! The whole thing was gone by the end of the party. :-)

Fabulous dish! Here are the changes I made: Used 12 eggs, skim milk. Used a bag of fresh spinach, chopped. Added garlic and a chopped red bell pepper. Added 1 lb. sliced mushrooms, which I sauteed with the onion, garlic, and bell pepper--and finally spinach. Used Asiago-Green Onion bread from the artisanal bakery--fabulous flavor! Used the cheeses I had on hand: sharp cheddar, Irish farmer cheese, and fresh parmesan. I served it at a pot luck--so it was in the fridge for 24 hours. Lots of rave reviews--the best strata ever! This recipe is a real keeper.

This was a great 'make ahead' brunch recipe to serve several people - at least 8.

We served with a few strips of bacon and thinly sliced smoked salmon on the side.

This was not as good as I thought it would be. The prep took me a long time, I had to bake it for more than an hour to get the inside cooked, and by then the top was overdone. My fiance and I weren't impressed with the taste or the texture.

This was decent. The basic recipe is definetley a keeper. I didn't have quite enough spinach, nor much else. I was also kind of drunk while assembling ;) However, the spices were VERY understated, and I added more than was called for. Garlic is a must, which I didn't add. I didn't measure the bread crumbs (I defer back to the drunk statement) and I think there might have been too many fir the custard to fully soak. However, I WILL make this again, with more stuff and cheese and spices. I am still working on leftovers. If you are, spread some sour cream on top; delicious!

I served this strata at Easter brunch and it was fantastic! Everyone loved it. I made it in a shallow, 4.8 liter lasagna dish, so I did only 2 layers and added 2 more eggs and a bit more milk. I also used fresh baby spinach. It was excellent and I loved that I could prepare the whole thing the night before and simply bake it Easter morning. I served it with roasted asparagas and followed it with Sour Cream & Lemon Pound Cake, another Epicurious sensation!

Absolutely *delicious*. This will become a regular part of the rotation! I added mushrooms, halved the bread and put the whole thing in a pie plate. Will reduce milk to one cup next time as the strada came out a bit watery (had to pour off some of the liquid). A definite keeper.

One of my favorites. I always sautee some chopped baby bellas with the onions(adds SO much) and this time used fresh chopped baby spinach (wilted it w/ the onions & mushrooms) and 1/2 gryuere, 1/2 fontina (had it in the fridge). The perfect brunch dish.

I'd give it three as written, but it deserves four if you use fresh spinach (about 2 bags fresh baby spinach), and saute a chopped red bell pepper with the onion. I've also added mushrooms in the past, which works well. But talk about your beautiful Christmas colors for a brunch. And this will make your kitchen smell divine, too.

Serves 6-8?? Not unless you are lumberjacks. I made this today for a family Christmas brunch and everyone loved it. I doubled the spinach and increased the onion like noted. I found it plenty salty, but I added about 8 oz Gruyere (we're from Wisconsin, you know). I also used about 10 c bread. I did find the Old Style whole grain dijon mustard seeds sunk to the bottom of the custard mix and came out in one blob at the end when I poured it over the bread mix; next time I'll use different dijon. I will make this again and add other vegetables. Good basic brunch fare.

This was very good, but others were right: there needs to be a bit more of the spinach and cheese added to the recipe. Also, for those of us who are single and put what's leftover in the freezer for later, this doesn't keep particularly well. It's great when fresh and hot, though.

Lovely light dinner. Would be nice for lunch or brunch as well! Not having time to wait for the overnight soak, I simply took the crust off the French bread and threw the cubes straight into the egg and milk mixture.

I have been making this or a variation of this strata for years. I try to substitute healthier ingrediants like half egg substitute, 2T olive oil, 1 or 2% milk, and a little less cheese, and maybe more spinach.

Used a 9x13 cake pan as we were "roughing it" at the cabin...so cool that everything can be done the night before and the morning of you can just wake and bake!

Also, even though the second one was "deflated" when served, I lifted the entire thing out of the glass casserole and warmed it up in a pie pan on the bottom rack. It got a little crusty and it was great.

I used the "mix-it-all-together" method, and substituted one pint of Eggbeaters for 8 of the eggs. I also added mushrooms and doubled the amount of spinach. It received raves at Christmas brunch.

I made this for a 40th birthday brunch. Everyone raved about it -- said it was the best strata they had ever had. They all wanted the recipe. I doubled the recipe and used a large foil roasting pan to accommodate it all. It worked great.

This is a delicious and easy make-ahead dish. I added one 1 lb. of chopped, crisp bacon to the spinach/onion mixture for a more substantial brunch entree. It's great with or without the meat.

AMazing as is, do not change a thing. Use good quality gruyere (worth the $$)!

Outstanding. I made this for a Thanksgiving brunch and it was a definite crowd pleaser. Added 2 cloves of garlic, sauteed with the onion. Also added strips of roasted, marinated red peppers to the mix, as well as in a design on top. Prepped the night before, baked in the morning, then popped under the broiler to brown just before serving.

This is perfect for an easy brunch dish. I made it last summer for a brunch and it recieved RAVE reviews. Four of the guests asked for the recipe. Hint: I doubled the amount of spinach. I loved the cheese, but it was expensive. I think next time I'll substitute plain swiss.

Overall I found this pretty disappointing. Considering the fat content I was hoping it would knock my socks off. Found it was pretty mediocre-decent enough but not delicious. I'm glad I tested it before I prepared it for guests. I will look for another recipe to use. On the positive side, it smelled great in the oven.

Didn't have nutmeg and didn't miss it in the final product. Doubled the spinach mixture and did two layers with the bread in a 13X9X2 casserole. Was PERFECT for a birthday brunch I hosted. People will think you're a genuis. Paired with a fruit salad dressed in Grand Marnier and of course mimosas!

Excellent dish for brunch - loved that I could make it the night before.

I thought the recipe was pretty good -- not knock-your-socks-off good, but decent-enough-for-guests good. I'll probably make it again, and will probably experiment with more spinach, perhaps some mushrooms and/or ham. BTW, with 1% milk and dividing it six ways, the recipe has about 585 calories per serving according to Recipe Calc (I DO wish Epicurious would offer nutritional info!).

I didn't love this the way the other reviewers did. It was very easy to make and convenient to prepare in advance but I think it had too much bread and not enough egg. I would cut the bread down by about 1/3. It could have also used a bit more filling, perhaps more spinach or the addition of some mushrooms and herbs.

This recipe is truly phenomenal! I made it as directed in the recipe, and wouldn't change a thing. It was the hit of my brunch yesterday, and everyone asked for the recipe. For the very minimal amount of work involved in preparing this dish, it is so fantastic!

This was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly as written and would not change a thing. The use of quality cheese definitely is a key to this recipe.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day brunch, and it was a hit! I couldn't find Gruyere, so I used Swiss cheese instead, with good results. I also didn't have a gratin dish, and wound up using a 13x9 pan. This worked well, but if I did this again in a similar pan, I think I'd just do two layers of ingredients instead of three. All in all, though, this was a hit!

Very tasty, easy to make, guests who like non-meat dishes loved it. Was a tad bit bland, so when reheated, we added a little garlic powder and chili pepper flakes and it was fantastic!

I made this for a family get together about a year ago when my older brother was going through a vegetarian phase. I doubled the spinach and onion mixture as suggested--it was phenomenal!! The entire family raved (as has everyone else that I have made it for) and it is now the recipe we use whenever my family gets together for the holidays. YUM!

This is a wonderful dish for everyday or for company. I made this recipe in a crock pot using the method described by the poster below (mixing all ingredients in a bowl, not layering). It came out a bit too moist for our liking, but that was due to my not having reduced the liquid (next time I'll reduce the milk to 1.75 c for crock pot cooking). I made this to use up a variety of partial bags of shredded cheeses leftover in my freezer and it still came out delish.

I've experimented with many stratas over the over years and this has been my least favorite. It's not that it tastes bad - just a little boring for my tastes. If you decide to make this, use the highest quality bread and cheeses you can find.

I made this for a training I held at my house for my team of employees. It was absolutely delicious!! Several of the gang has demanded the recipe and have even used it as a ultimatum for doing their work! Its all in good fun, but truly, this was one of the best recipes I have tried on Epicurious. It is even good heated up as left-overs.

The first time I made this awesome recipe according the the directions, but last week I watched Sara Moutlon (from Gourmet) make it by mixing the spinach, bread etc. in a bowl first and then pouring the mixture into the baking dish - it was so fast!

This was so easy and so pretty and so delicious! I made this for brunch for my in-laws this past weekend and they absolutely loved it. I made the strata and refrigerated overnight. I baked it and then put foil loosely over it and kept it in my over warmer for an hour before serving and it didn't dry out at all! Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe just as it was written except for using ground nutmeg. I wouldn't change a thing. I had no problems fitting three layers into a gratin dish just like the one in the picture and mine turned out even prettier! I don't get why layering is such a chore; this recipe went together very smoothly with very little prep work. I loved making it the night before, getting up in the morning and popping it in the oven. I served it with sausage, fresh fruit and mimosas...a real keeper!

Delicious and easy to make. Let sit overnight and it was perfect Christmas day brunch. Take time and really incorporate the mustard into the egg mixture. I did not wisk the mustard in enough and it was a little clumpy.

Easy and very good. A great do-ahead dish. I made if for a Christmas-time brunch with my family and everyone loved it. I had expected take-home leftovers but there were none! I used a shallow, baking dish as recipe suggested, but there was no way I was going to get three layers of 1" bread cubes in it. So I just mixed the spinach/onion mixture and about 2/3 of the cheese with the bread in a large bowl. Then put into the baking dish and topped w/ remaining cheese. Then added the milk/egg mixture. Let it soak for almost 24 hours and then baked it. So it was more of a savory bread pudding than a "strata", but it was delicious all the same.

Hey Weyburn: You sound like a real food conosieur. Why not substitute cheese whiz for the swiss gruyere? Celery - What were you thinking?

To a 'cook from Calgary' -- the 'concept' of stratas??? What is this, a math problem? It is what it is -- eggs, cheese, bread, etc. What did you think it would be -- a tray of cinnamon buns???? I found it delicious and would make it again. Used celery instead of spinach. (My kids love celery).

Very good indeed. I made half of this recepie with less cheese. Turned out very good, served with lettuce on the side.

Very good brunch recipe, my guests really enjoyed it. I made 2 dishes, added smoked turkey breast to one, and mushrooms and garlic to the other. I also used fresh spinach. Both turned out very well. I love the make-ahead prep (just pop it in the oven day of the brunch), but it did take a while to put together with all the chopping and shredding. Also not a cheap dish to put together, the cheese alone will run you $10-20 if you get the good stuff. Next time I will try with cheaper cheese and see if it still turns out as good.

This recipe has become a must-have when we have people over for brunch. It's delicious, virtually impossible to mess up, and all the preparation can be done the night before.

I don't know what recipe the cook from Atlanta was rating, but it sure wasn't this one. This isn't a soup and doesn't call for olive oil.

Very easy and convenient for day-ahead preparation. Double the spinach if you want (it's better I think). I cheat and use powdered nutmeg. Add Canadian ham slices before the last cheese layer.

This soup is good and typical of the soups served in Florence, except it seemed to be missing something. Next time I will add chopped escarole to make it a little more of a mixture instead of beans on the bottom and broth on top. I made the tomato/onion mixture and cooked the macaroni the night before. This recipe is not as time consuming as it looks since most of the cooking time is unattended. Use the best extra virgin olive oil you have to finish this dish, as the flavor really shines through.

Served this for a brunch attended by vegetarians, omnivores, and children, and it received rave reviews. I loved that it kept me out of the kitchen and with my guests. I stretched it a bit by adding extra bread, and it didn't seem to suffer. The nutmeg added depth and stood up to the spinach flavor. It was quite filling and rich, but I'd be reluctant to use anything but whole milk, for fear of thinning the custard base.

Served this at a brunch including all types of palates from spice lovers to garlic haters with only 2 changes. I added some diced ham and instead of layering (who has time for THAT) I just tossed all the dry ingredients together and then put into a prepared casserole. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. What a treat. The bread I used may have been a little too dense as it turned out just a little on the dry side but I had no complaints! Served it with roasted asparagus and garlic roasted potatoes for the garlic junkies and it made a beautiful presentation. Much tastier than the old yellow cheese stratas that we all loved.

This was so easy a child could make it. I made it for brunch. I love that you could do it ahead and everyone really enjoyed it. I served it with thick sliced bacon and a fruit salad of plums, pitted fresh bing cherries, nectarines, flavored with a little honey, orange blossom water and a smidge of vanilla.... Had the left over strata for dinner this evening...not as much of an experience reheated, but still pretty darn solid. Also, inexpensive and a great way to use up leftover country style bread. T

This is even good for Sunday breakfast if you have an electric oven with a delayed timing function: get up, take out of fridge, place in oven, set oven to go on in 30 minutes and cook for 45 minutes, go back to bed for about an hour. Otherwise, it's good for a later meal, even supper. Leftovers are good too, warm, cold or room temp. I plan to try it with broccoli and cheddar next time.

This tastes very good and feels healthy to eat. I didn't follow the measurements all that closely and used about 2 1/2 cups onion, 2 packages of spinach, a lot more bread and some more milk. It's all our family of 4 had for dinner and there was plenty left over.

Excellent, both delicious and elegant looking. Adults preferred it over the children. I would probably add the liquid in a bowl, mix thoroughly and then pour all in a casserole dish vs. pouring the liquid over the mixture in the casserole dish next time. Made it for Easter Brunch 2003 and would make again and again!

I made this for Easter brunch, and was a little concerned that it wouldn't be substantial enough...was I wrong!! The extra spinach & onion I added plus the richness of the cheese made this an outstanding brunch! I added a little extra milk on top just before baking.

I made this for a brunch at work first and added sauteed mushrooms to the spinach and onions, it was great. I made it again for 50 and added sliced tomatoes to the top and everyone loved it too. It really tasted better in the regular size pan. Not as bready.

Very tasty and easy dish to make! I also used fresh spinach, chopped in the food processor. I agree that the recipe could use a doubling of the spinach/onion mixture. I used French bread. When I was assembling, I forgot to put in the next two layers of the bread so I ended up mixing it all in the casserole dish. However it still looked and tasted great.

This was great, and RICCCHHHH! I took others' suggestions and used more onion and spinach, and added about 1 tsp. dried thyme. I might try to cut down on richness next time -- maybe a little less cheese and some low-fat milk plus regular milk. It also looks great coming out of the oven and serving as is. It's like a savory bread pudding.

Because of the other comments, I made this recipe with double the spinach ( I used fresh, steamed spinach ) and double the onion. I didn't change the recipe in any way other than that and it was great! VERY rich and loaded with fat (27 g) and calories ( 715/serving ) so I think I will save this for company or try to reduce the calories and fat in some way next time.

I have not tried this recipe itself; but I do make a lot of other strata recipes. My question is --why use frozen spinach instead of fresh? It looks like the perfect lunch recipe here at the lake.

I cut the recipe in half, but did not halve the spinach or the onions. It turned out great! Also, I did not chill for 8 hours, just put it in the oven right away...the bread soaked up the egg mixture quickly. I think that for the recipe as is, the spinach needs to AT LEAST be doubled from what is called for. I agree with the idea to try some crumbled sausage in it...will probably try that next time.

I'd make it again and add garlic to the onions. I think it needs more spinach. A great concept, but this recipe needs something else.

Very easy to make. When I make it again, I might add some thyme. Great vegetarian dish as is, but might try adding some cooked and crumbled sausage or bacon for non-veggies.
