This sandwich is delicious. I've been getting recipes off Epicurious for about five years, and I can count on one hand the number of times I have given a review, if that tells you anything. The only problem I have is trying to talk myself into eating only half (it's REALLY filling).

We make this regularly, pretty much as written. I use a garlic press to speed mashing the garlic. My son likes extra garlic mayo. I serve it with thousand island dressing and potato chips on the side.

These were delicious. I made according to recipe using premium components - homemade rustic bread, Swiss gruyere cheese and a homemade sweet/hot mustard. I will certainly be making these again.

made a mini version of these for a cuban dinner - modified to make it a bit more authentic based on reviewers notes and recommendations from friend who has been to cuba - used salami and smoked black forest ham and a soft spanish cheese - did not use turkey and did not do the milk/egg wash - just pan saute like a panini - and I roasted the garlic for mayo - everybody raved about these!

Delicious, easy, and I loved that the recipe was written for one serving. Made it very easy to make my lunch!

This was the best sandwich I ever had. Umm garlic mayo, pickles. It was so good. Who cares what the name is. Just follow the recipe. Don't review it if you made it different and didn't like it. Or, duh, if you don't like the way it sounds don't make it. Because it is just a sandwich.

Just made these sandwiches w/ homemade lemon/limeade -- great combination! Made the recipe with sliced sourdough. Other than that, I made it exactly as written. My husband and I loved them, and they were quick and easy.

Hmmm... I must admit that I was a tad disappointed especially after reading the glowing reviews. Grilled cheese, ham, turkey... what's not to like? Perhaps my bread (the healthy kind) was the problem? I didn't even finish my plate- not like me at all!

this is a very good sandwhich, a little rich and a little salty, but thats the way I like it! It was easy to make, not as messy as I had expected. The garlic mayo really adds to it. I made it for my husband and teenage son for brunch and they loved it.

GREAT sandwich. This would be good with or without the egg soaking. On the first preparation we soaked it. I used half Coleman's hot mustard and half honey mustard and more garlic. I bought black forest ham and a 'country style' thick sliced bread which may have been a little too soft. I could only eat half because this is a hearty sandwich.

Oh my heavens, this sandwich is so good! I made it as written, and I have to say, I wouldn't change a thing. Give it a try, and be sure to use some good, soft, thickly sliced bread - the kind you'd use for French Toast - so it really absorbs the egg mixture and gets browned in the butter. mmmm... possibly the best sandwich ever!

This is a very nice version of a Cuban Sandwich. A Cuban sandwich is a variation of a ham and cheese originally created by Cuban workers, either in Cuba or in the immigrant community of Ybor City in Tampa Florida. Later, Cubans brought it to other communities in southern Florida, particularly Key West and Miami where it is very popular. The sandwich is made with ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and sometimes salami on Cuban bread.

Actually, Dravafox, what is sold around the island nowadays isn't remotelly what the actual Cuban cuisine is due to the lack of ingredients (food!). A ham & cheese sandwich in Cuba is and has always been called just that. A Cuban sandwich, on the other hand, is exactly what Novak described, as it was known in pre-castro Cuba, and by free Cubans all around the world today. This spin-off is absolutely divine, monte and all! I made it for my all-Cuban family and friends the original way and also with the tradditional roasted sliced pork. Both ways were a success. Even my "abuelita" (granny) loved it. This is definetely a repeat!

Actually Novak, a Cuban "Jamon con Queso", sold all around the island, on streets and vendors and restaurants is just that... a fresh white bun with a couple slices of simple ham and just simple soft cheese (there's no Swiss cheese in Cuba!! Duh!) ... no more. So the Cuban name is just 'flash' and no substance... again, fantastic sandwich, don't get me wrong, but misleading name. I would not change ANY of the ingredients either, its a well balanced and rib sticking sandwich!!

This is a great sandwich. And to those who don't know, a cuban sandwich this is...mostly. Where it deviates from a traditional cuban sandwich is the addition of turkey, sliced bread and the monte treatment. A traditional cuban sandwich is made from ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, pickles, yellow mustard on a split loaf that is then grilled under pressure. This is a keeper.

Made this for lunch today. Good Sandwich , Bad Name. Sorry! Not a cuban anything. A good ham and turkey sandwich on egg grilled bread. Cmon show me Havanna.

This is an excellent sandwich! Call it what you like, but don't skip the monte, don't skip the dill pickles, and don't skip the garlic mayo! Obviously, this is subjective, bit give it a try as written!

I too, as others did, dropped the Monte but with a really good homemade Rye Bread, grilled with a little garlic butter, it turned into a pretty good Cuban Reuben. Loved it. Served it to friends who asked for the recipe. Also It's a keeper, with variations.

very good sandwich, but the name is deceptive, there's no swiss cheese, sliced turkey, mayonaise or pickles i've ever found in Cuba and i've backpacked almost the entire country... maybe call it the Monte Gringo? Monte Miami?

What's wrong with either a Monte Christo or a good Cuban sandwich? They are both great sandwiches on their own. I'll stick with one or the other...probably the cuban! I did make this as written.

This is a great sandwich - the garlic really adds something. On the other hand, my husband and I both agreed that the "monte" part of the sandwich was unnecessary and the whole thing would have been better as a regular grilled or toasted sandwich. So, we'll definitely be making this again, but sans monte.

Made this with some homemade brioche...which made it taste like french toast, nothing wrong with that! Delicious.

Made these last night, they were quick, easy, tasty sandwiches. My husband devoured his and declared the recipe a keeper.

Wow, the garlic really ramped up flavor in this sandwich. I used Claussen's pickel strips and low carb bread and it still tasted great.

Delicious sandwich!!! We had it with a simple salad of mixed greens and tomatoes on the side. So good!

This is a fantastic sandwich! My 10 year old has been asking me to make it for her ever since the issue arrived! It is so delicious. We used a local raw-milk cheese and Applegate Farms turkey and ham on a great crusty sour-dough bread and we used Vegenaise for the mayo with some super thin sliced pickles from Zabars! This will be the new house special!

Brilliant! We made this twice in short order - once with the monte cristo batter and once just as a grilled sandwich. Loved it both ways. We don't have a panini press so I weighted it down with a pie plate and a brick (when I did it just as a grilled sandwich) and made it flat. Yum yum yum yum yum!

Wow, I've never tasted a sandwich that tastes quite like this one does! It is full of flavor...what a perfect combination of ingredients! Just one of these filled my husband up, which really surprised the both of us, although, I did serve this with some side dishes and Moscato wine. I'll recommend this to everyone I know. It was fast, easy, and quite delicious! I did use Petridge Farm Garlic Toast slightly toasted instead of regular bread and 4 crushed garlic cloves instead of a 1/2. I only substituted the garlic toast because we love garlic and our supermarket doesn't carry anything but the basics, however, I think any bread used would be delicious.

I love this recipe and couldn't wait to review it on epicurious. It was super easy to make, quick and a major keeper in my kitchen. I followed the recipe and directions exactly and used Boar's Head sweet slice ham and mesquite smoked turkey with some really good quality swiss cheese. My mustard choice was a mix of some sharp dijion and a bit of mild whole grain. The bread was an italian sourdough called pane rustica and is a bit cheweier and moister than a cibbatta. The garlic mayo really made the whole sandwich sing and all the flavors come togehter. I loved this one so much that I made it again last night and used a bit more garlic which I loved. This is my new favorite sandwich and those that love pickles and ham and cheese will LOVE this one.
