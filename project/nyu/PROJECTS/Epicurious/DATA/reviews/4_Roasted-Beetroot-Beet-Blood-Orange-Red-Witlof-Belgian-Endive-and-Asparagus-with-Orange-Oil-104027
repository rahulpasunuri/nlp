One of my favorite salads. Always gets rave reviews though I cheat by using bottled dressing.

a perfect salad for guests. Very tasty and beautiful on the table. I have paired it with wild mushroon risotto to rave reviews. I think it best as written but still worth making if greens substitutions have to happen.

Delicious and large enough to serve as a plated first course. Made it for a holiday dinner party and everyone raved (and ate every bite.) Dressing was a bit blah, but there was so much goign on with this salad that I can see why it needs to be so simple. Orange oil was an excellent touch. My Whole Foods did not have blood oranges, so I used navel oranges and it was still delicious.

This was a lovely salad, and for guests can be laid out for a very elegant presentation. I got some "wows" even before it was tasted. It was very tasty too!

I gave this four forks because I've already made it twice in the last month. It's a well-balanced salad - the earthiness of the beets, crunch of the pine nuts, sweetness of the oranges... Be sure to put the beets in a pan while roasting, not directly on the rack. Despite the foil, they will leak. I used packaged salad greens that were a mixture of green and purplish leaves. Green leaves only might have provided more visual contrast with the beets. Because of a minor kitchen disaster, I had to replace the blood orange juice with regular OJ for drinking. The recipe was still fabulous. I'm not sure how much difference the blood oranges (which seem to be seasonal and hard to find here) make. Next time I will try with regular oranges.

Excellent combination of flavors, and the pine nuts give it a nice crunch. I substituted other mixed greens for the frisee and mache, and safflower oil for the grapeseed oil. This was a lot of effort, but worth it.

Left out the asparagus and endive. Used regular oranges and mache only still outstanding. Can't wait to do full recipe.

This salad required a fair amount of preparation...but it was well worth the effort. The flavours and textures were outstanding. we will look forward to preparing this for a future meal!
