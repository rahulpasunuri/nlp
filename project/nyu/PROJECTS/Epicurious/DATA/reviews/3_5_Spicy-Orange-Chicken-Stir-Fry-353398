over all the recipe was easy to make. It has to be very healthy, but it has a great flavor. I used 2 fresh squeezed oranges. I also boiled fresh snap peas and then added it to the stir fry, rather than frozen. You MUST use Jasmine Rice - it completes the meal. Next time I may double the sauce recipe just so it has a little more sauce for the dishes. Maybe more onion? I can only imagine it tasting better and better the more veggies you add to the stir fry. But this is a good simple start.

i didn't have any oranges or orange juice, so i used the juice & peel of 1 lemon and added a little honey--- delicious!!

I've been making this for 3 years now. It's tasty, healthy, easy - great for an everyday meal. I usually add garlic & ginger, red pepper if I have it, and sometimes just sugar snap peas and sometimes other vegetables - packaged fresh stir fry veggies make this a snap.

Very decent week meal for week days, I add more red pepper to make it spicy and I replace the sugar snap peas by regular peas.

I used snow peas, mushrooms, fresh red pepper, red/yellow onions, fresh grated ginger with the peppercinis, soy sauce and rice vinegar. A couple teaspoons of sugar, Splenda, SweetNLow (2 pink spoons) brings out the flavor in Asian dishes. It turned out wonderful, healthy, colorful on the dinnerware.

The recipe as written is good, but with some added ingredients (as many others have noted) it's ahhh-maaazing! I used a habanero pepper instead of crushed red pepper and added red and yellow bell peppers. Delicious!

I liked the sauce, but the combination of red onion and sugar snap peas wasn't great. I think I will try it again with red bell peppers, yellow onions and broccoli. The suggestion of garlic sounds good. I bet with those adjustments...it would be 3 or 4 forks.

Great...... With a few tweaks that is.. I added ginger and sesame oil as another poster suggested. I also added more veggies, but I only have one question.. Why the heck is there no garlic in this recipe?? I didn't even think of it until the end, so I added some garlic powder. I will make again but I think next time I will put some minced garlic in @ the beginning.

I ask my husband to make this for me once a week. Going on 1.5 years! We add a little orange zest to the top. It has it all...sweet, savory, crunchy, salty. It's love on a plate.

AS WRITTEN this recipe is OK. As I was eating it, I felt like it was just lacking Asian flavor. Yes, it needs some fresh ginger and garlic as well as some sesame oil and more time for the onions to cook and crisp a bit. And granted a "pinch" is an inaccurate measurement, but mine was not nearly spicy enough. Great for how quick it was (although I'll be using store-bought orange juice rather than fresh since that was a time sink) and will definitely try again with some mods.

This recipe will be bland as written. Triple the pepper and add the zest of most of a large orange for a more flavorful result.

Rating: 3
My wife and I weren't crazy about this. I used frozen stir-fry veggies instead of the onion and sugar snap peas to get more veggies in my kids diet. It had a nice orange flavor, but even with added garlic & ginger as others suggested it didn't really do much for the adults. The kids (3 & 5) really liked it though, even ate all the veggies which was the goal!

I made this for dinner tonight and my boyfriend and I loved it! I added a pinch more red pepper flakes, a finely minced clove of garlic, and some thinly sliced bell pepper went in the pan along with the onion. I boiled soba noodles for 3 minutes, and then transferred them to the stir-fry to finish cooking. I served it in shallow bowls with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil, sliced green onions, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds! SO MUCH FLAVOR. I will make this regularly. Fast, simple, delicious!!! An absolute knockout with the soba noodles, too!

Have made this recipe many times just as it is written and have never been disappointed. We usually double the sauce because my husband likes a lot of sauce, but otherwise I don't change a thing. Not sure how people are finding this lacking in taste or too mushy - in the 9 or 10 times I have made it, I have never had either of those issues. Very delicious and will make it again and again.

Rating: 2
It was ok. I expected more flavor. I would add more crushed red pepper or use Tabasco soy. I also think that the textures were too mushy so I added some water chestnuts and that helped. Add garlic, no oriental receipe should be without it!

This dish left a lot to be desired. I even added fresh garlic and ginger to spice it up and was not satisfied.

Yeah, not so bad. Any recipe with zest will pique my interest; citrus fruit zest is known to cure ringworm, tether, jock itch, psoriasis, and the stigmata. Don't be afraid of corn starch, yellow bellies; you need it for a nice thick stir fry sauce. Far from bad, probably undeserving of the 3 fork rating I gave it, but easy enough. And you never need an excuse for a dish with sugar snaps. Doctor it up how you like it; I added some more crushed red pepper and extra soy sauce, though I wish I hadn't; it overpowered the subtle orange flavor. When I get to the leftovers, I'm adding Sriracha.

I changed the recipe based on the previous comments so I'm not going to review the actual recipe (and thus swiftly dodging the posts about that). I added ginger, garlic, cilantro. sliced red bell pepper, chili sauce instead of crushed red pepper and, because I wanted more sauce than I was getting, about 1/4 cup or so of chicken broth. My family really liked it. I'd cut back on the cornstarch next time because there was this vague cornstarchy-thickener-thing about it.

Rating: 4
Okay, not haut cuisine, but great taste for minimal effort! This recipe gets 3 forks for the flavor (delicious) and then one more for how very easy it was to make. I used steamed broccoli instead of the sugar snaps and added some grated ginger to the orange juice (on the theory that no stir fry recipe is so good it can't be improved upon by fresh ginger). Was a huge hit and I will definitely make it next time I break down and eat chicken (confessions of a lapsed vegetarian...).

Was really fast and easy, and really good. I added cashews at the end and they brightened the dish.

I have made this a few times. Definitely NOT like Orange Chicken from my local Chinese Restaurant, but probably a healthier alternative, since I know what is in this. However, a general note on this recipe as one other person noted. You need to cook the chicken separately and put it in a bowl. Then cook the onions (or vice versa). Then put it all back in the pan to warm it up. That will make sure the chicken is cooked and avoid the "sogginess" that can occur when you get too much going in a frying pan. I also added garlic and ginger.

Super easy and yummy just the way it is.

Easy, but certainly not overwhelmingly good. I should have followed recommendations for ginger, garlic, chili paste, and broccoli.

I'm also glad I read the comments before I made this. I added a few splashes of hot sauce to the orange juice/soy sauce mix, used much more crushed red pepper, and substituted broccoli for the peas. I don't think it was boring or bland. I can definitely imagine it being that way if you don't add spice. Great easy dinner.

Pretty Good. Very Easy! In NO WAY reminiscent of orange chicken you may get from your fave american-chinese restaurant. I thought it was a great new way to do a chicken stir fry and a nice use for super fresh oranges. I will consider using blood oranges next time though.

I'm a vegetarian and couldn't eat it, but it wasn't a big hit with my parents. My mother said she would have liked it more if the chicken had been crispy. I think because I cooked it with the onions, the chicken didn't get crispy at all. Next time, I may fry it in the oil separately first, then add it to the rest of the ingredients when they're cooked. My father was also pretty negative about the recipe, but brightened considerably when he added his spicy sauce. Next time, I will fry the chicken a bit first on its own and add a lot of red chile paste.

Bland, mundane, boring- all good words to describe this dish. The only way I made it threw a whole bowl was trying to figure out what was missing from it. I tried this despite the many bad reviews because there were also some good- don't make my mistake.

In my husband's words, MUNDANE. This could be much better..... a few suggestions: I didn't have a wok so I used the suggested nonstick pan. I would use a regular pan next time and make sure the oil was VERY hot..then flash saute the onions and remove them from the pan..then flash saute the chicken but be sure to brown the pieces a bit. I satued chopped ginger and garlic with the chicken. You need to add more red pepper flakes, but also I would suggest adding some Chinese chili garlic sauce to kick up the flavor a notch. Also, use more orange peel. I used Thai Kitchen Lemon Grass and Ginger rice (box) that was the perfect match.

This was great! I used what I had on hand: broccoli instead of peas, garlic instead of onion, and it was still really great and super fast. Good quick weeknight dinner.

This was a good recipe. All of the flavors came together really well. I doubled the sauce as was recommended by another user, but I don't know if it necessarily needed it. I also added sliced almonds which added a nice mellow crunch to balance out the spice, which I made even hotter by adding dried chilis. A lot of people suggested adding ginger to the stir fry- instead of doing this I served it over ginger-scented rice: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Ginger-Scented-Rice-352049 It was awesome with the orange sauce.

I am not a great cook. This was easy to make, economical and tasted very good. We like Basmati rice and it was good with the chicken. My husband doesn't like onions so I left those out. Nexyt time I'm going to saute a bit of garlic with the chicken.

My boyfriend and I made this tonight and we thought it was great. We added 2 cloves of garlic, about 2 tablespoons of ginger and 1 red, 1 yellow pepper.

Was a quick and easy weeknight dinner. Love making chicken in the wok, it cooks quickly and the texture comes out great. Used Naked fresh orange juice and the flavor came out nice. We followed the recipe but could easily be modified with whatever veggies are available. Extra garlic and some ginger would also be nice. Next time will be adding more crushed red pepper, the pinch just didn't come through with the sweetness of the juice and the saltiness of the soy sauce.

Made this for a "work dinner". Used garden peas, red and yellow peppers as the vegetable content. Everyone loved it! Was not very spicy, but this could be due to the type of dried pepper available here in Germany !! Will def. make it again, the orange juice and soya sauce mix was delicious

I increased the sauce by about half, eliminated the red onion and added LOTS of garlic and ginger. Used ground red chili in the sauce and cut snap peas in half, lengthwise. Everyone really liked this quick, easy dish.

Rating: 3
I read all of the other reviews and modified the recipe to our tastes. I used a pound of chicken because I wanted 4 servings. I upped the sauce ingredients by 1/3 so that there would be plenty. I substituted brown rice because we don't eat white rice. My sweet baboo likes spicy food, so the dried peppers became a teaspoon instead of a pinch. We don't have sugar snaps yet, so I subbed fresh asparagus from the garden and added half a red pepper, julienned. We loved it and it had a little spicy burn to contrast with the orange juice.

Okay but disappointing overall. I had hoped for more "orangey" flavor. Perhaps reducing some orange juice or using some juice concentrate would help.

Rating: 2
I thought the dish was pretty average tasting. I added crushed garlic as recommended by other reviewers. I also doubled the sauce mixture which ended up being the perfect amount. A few changes I would make: 1. Prepare the sauce and thicken over heat before adding to chicken. I personally prefer to use flour instead of corn starch. Mix flour with cold water before adding to the sauce to make for better dissolution. 2. Add a few tsp of brown sugar to the sauce mixture to sweeten it up 3. Add thinly sliced carrots

This is a great, quick, easy recipe! I love the mix of sweet from the orange juice and savory from the onions. I do agree with others that it could have used just a bit more "kick" to it and I did add thinly sliced carrots.

Wow! This recipe really surprised me. I was looking for a decent dish to make my family that was healthy, quick, easy, and pretty yummy. I didn't expect it to turn out as tasty as it did. It was fast, easy, healthy, and delicious. I increased the sauce ingredients a little and added broccoli and carrots. The turn out was surprisingly a huge success by all so that made me happy. I also didn't have a red onion so I just used a small yellow onion and I didn't have the peas but the other veggies made it extra special. It's definitely not like the fried restaurant orange chicken but it had a spicy orange flavor that goes great with a little soy sauce.

Awesome dish. I don't have snow peas here in Central America, so I used a red pepper, bean sprouts and added garlic with the onions. Needed a lot more sauce, as I seasoned the chicken in salt, pepper, chili and flour... Quick easy and still allows you drink and enjoy the evening with friends!!

I didn't have snow peas, but I had broccoli, carrots and bell peppers. I cooked the chicken first with a clove of garlic, and quick fried the veg. in hot oil, and then mixed it all together. The sauce was a bit gummy, but smoothed out very nicely with a dash of water. Excellent flavor and very versatile. Some sweet red peppers would be perfect in this dish. I'm looking forward to cooking it again.

This was easy and very, very good. We made the full amount of sauce but only had .85 lbs of chicken (we like sauces) and it tasted delicious. Next time we'll probably use 1 - 1.25 lbs of chicken.
