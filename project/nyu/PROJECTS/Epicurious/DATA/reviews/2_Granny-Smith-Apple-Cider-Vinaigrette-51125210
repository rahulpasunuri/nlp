Can't rate because I haven't made it yet but with such contradictory comments -one saying it's bland and the other saying it's too acidic- I'm definetely going to try! By the looks of the recipe, I'm going to like it.

I'm a big fan of this vinaigrette, I used this vinaigrette on escarole salad with carrots and mushrooms and goat cheese and was a perfect balance of flavors. Maybe the other reviewers used bad apples ?

One should NOT blend/pulverize apple seeds as they contain a poison. There's probably not enough in the apple, here, to worry about, but it's not a good idea, in general. http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/apples.asp

I'm sorry but this recipe couldn't have been tested as printed. As written, it is WAY too acidic. The balance is totally wrong. I didn't want to throw it out so I doubled the oil and added about 1T of honey. I would now give it 3 stars and i will try it on the kale and kumquat salad tonight. I'm sure it will be delicious.

This is really bland. Definitely not worth the trouble to make.
