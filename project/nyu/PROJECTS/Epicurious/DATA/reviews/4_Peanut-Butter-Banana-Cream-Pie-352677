Perhaps it was my fault cause I used store bought crust... i am not a fan of cookie crusts. But overall this dish just was not a winner. Peanut butter layer was definitely too rich and overpowering. My favorite part was the vanilla pudding layer... this was delicious and I used a tsp of vanilla extract since I couldn't find vanilla bean. When this was served it had been sitting at room temperature for a couple of hours and it totally turned into mush... not enough firmness. This recipe was definitely a disappointment.

All I can say is who wouldn't love bananas, cream and peanut butter. I made this for my man's birthday and he loved it. I will make this again. Instead of using peanut brittle I used a light dusting of crushed peanuts. It gave the pie the added texture that it needed.

I just made this for my husband's birthday ... instead of the vanilla wafer crust, he opted for a flaky crust so I took the extra time to make that and it was worth it. Also, I made double the amount of pudding. If I hadn't... the pie would have looked like it was definitely missing something! Overall though, a good pie.

Unbelievable pie. Delish in every way.

This was great! It was very good and also very easy to make. I made exactly as written, except substituted about 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract for the vanilla bean. I am sure it would also be very good with a graham cracker crust, might try that next time. I will definitely make this again!

Amazing! Next time I will try with slightly less of the peanut butter topping, which is very rich. (But delicious.)

Very good. Nice combination of flavors.

really great. probably my fault for not evenly distributing the crust all the way up pie dish sides, but the crust seemed quite thick. also, added bananas as a layer before custard was poured into the crust, in addition to recipe recommendation of banana between custard and cream cheese layer and on top.would have been wanting on banana flavor if i hadn't!

I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and upped all of the ingredients by a third in order to accommodate a deep dish pie plate. In hindsight, I would up the custard and banana layer, but leave the crust and the peanut butter cream topping as is in the recipe (the crust seemed a bit thick, and the peanut butter layer is VERY rich). Otherwise, this was a real treat and the flavor profile is amazing. I know everyone is griping that the vanilla bean is expensive, but the seeds impart just the right note to make the custard special and not your standard "jello pudding" layer.

Unreal. First attempt at "baking" and this turned out really well. My wife is a banana cream pie freak and this scored high with her. Layers of flavour and easy to make, an instant classic.

How do I love the Baked Boys, let me count the ways!! We all enjoyed this pie, but I must say it was exceptional enough to make again. I love all of your recipes, sorry to not LOVE this one, but I am in deep like. The crust is perfection, no one should buy ready-made.

Everyone loves this pie. I agree with Molly--more bananas. In fact, the first time I made it, it tasted great, but didn't look amazing. I solved this by putting it into a deeper pie dish, increasing everything by about 1/3, except for the bananas and topping, which I doubled. Also added chopped peanuts to the crushed peanut brittle, and it made a beautiful, big, diner- worthy pie. Makes several more servings that way too.

Holy crap this is good. I used pre-made crust, whatever. Bring this to a bbq, or somewhere where other people will be eating it - I would imagine it is terribly unhealthy, but that's okay because it's incredibly good. I would add more bananas over the pudding layer...like, overlap the slices quite a bit. It is YUMMY. Oh, and I didn't use a vanilla bean because they cost more than the entire pie.

Made this to the letter except used a premade Nilla crust. Delicious!

My family loved this pie! I made it for Thanksgiving and I'm making it again over Christmas. I used a purchased graham cracker crust because I was short on time. I also almost doubled the peanut butter in the topping and decreased the amount of sugar.With these adjustments, the topping had plenty of peanut butter flavor and wasn't too sweet. The custard part is perfect.

Just made this this weekend. Awesome! I made it as stated and urge you to make the cookie crust, it was an excellent combination! My husband now wants this as his birthday cake in the spring!!

I thought it was very good but I expected more of a peanut butter flavor. I might try adding more peanut butter the next time I make it.

Yummy! The peanut butter and bananas go so very well together with the wafer crust. The only thing I was missing was perhaps a touch of the orange flavor on the bananas. I got none, but that might have been nice. Overall, vaguely reminiscent of banana cream pie - but a wonderful twist!

I Love Loved this version of a Banana Cream Pie Recipe! I took the advice of the previous bakers and chose not to have the pie become "too sweet for my taste". I decided a flaky crust would do the trick (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Flaky-Cream-Cheese-Pie-Crust-101857) instead of the original wafer crust....I also added an extra whole egg yolk to the recipe and a heaping 1/3 cup of peanut butter just so as to even out with the flaky crust...mmmMMMMM! Delicious!!!

This recipe was so rich and so sweet that it was way too much. I was hoping for some classic banana cream pie with a bit of a twist but ended up with heavy on the peanut butter flavor side. It was so rich that no one ever finished the pie, a rarity in my house!

This pie WAS delicious. The layers are creamy and sweet. When I tasted the peanut butter mixture I couldn't believe I had made this. I've been paying $6 for the peanut butter bomb at the local spot. Who knew I could make it myself? The vanilla layer was great and the crust was incredible. A very rich dessert... I do have a few suggestions.... 1. I highly recommend making this ONLY if you are going to have other people around to eat it. It is irresistible and I could not handle that.... 2. We crushed up some peanuts and sprinkled them on top providing a little crunch. This was an excellent addition. (could go in middle layer as well/instead) ....3. I didn't have vanilla bean. Still delicious with a splash of extract.... 4. Overall I do agree with "GingerCostaRica" it was too sweet for me. I will trying cutting some sugar especially in the peanut butter layer next time. (I used sweet peanut butter so that is probably a factor)

This pie was a hit with my boyfriend. I used a pre made chocolate graham cracker crust and stuck to recipe for everything else. Yummy! My mom liked it too....

I made this pie for my husband's birthday. The whole family enjoyed it, young and old. Very rich and creamy. Each individual step was fairly simple, but it did take some time to assemble all the layers, most of a day, including the chilling times. I think this pie would be very good substituting Nutella for the peanut butter, too.

My boyfriend really, really loves peanut butter. He also really, really loves banana cream pie. I like peanut butter, but not near as much as he does, and I never really liked banana cream pie. Both of us found this pie absolutely amazing, and I will be making it many, many times more!

This was great, really different from other desserts I've made and a big hit with everyone. The crust perfectly compliments the layers of the pie. The whole dessert is rich, but not overly sweet. My pudding layer was a bit runny but could've been corrected by chilling longer (maybe overnight?).

I love dessert, as a course, and this pie was one of the best that I've ever eaten. I snuck up to my mom's house at night to finish the leftovers.

This would have been perfect but my pudding portion of the pie turned out really really grainy. What did I do wrong? It was a little bit confusing because it says to whisk together all the the ingredients THEN cook over medium heat. Was I supposed to whisk them together WHILE the pan was on medium heat? That's what I thought I should do but I wanted to follow the instructions exactly. Anyone else have this problem?

This pie was amazing. Everyone cleaned their plates. I didn't use peanut brittle and I used vanilla extract instead of the bean and couldn't tell a difference. Definitely make this-you won't be sorry.

I made tarts instead of a pie. I cut the peanut brittle into strips that I stuck into the tart to make a tree, and then piped chocolate on parchment paper in the shape of monkeys. They were a big hit! As for taste, it was a little too sweet. I'm going to make them again, but cut the sugar out of the crust, and put a little less in the cream cheese mixture.

This was sooooo good! I am not usually a baker, but it turned out perfect and was really delicious. It even seemed to get better the next day. I too didn't use the peanut brittle and didn't feel like anything was missing.

This was just delicious! I chose not to serve it with the peanut brittle on top. It was quite rich and creamy, and I'll definitely make it again.
