I love this dish. I always use fresh limas when I make it, and I feel that makes such a difference. You get such a fresh, lima flavor. What a great way to show off these beans in season.

My dinner guests and I really enjoyed this puree, which we ate with roast rack of lamb with mint sauce. Like other reviewers I used chicken stock and I also used dried white lima beans. This came out looking like the smootheset of mashed potatoes.

I've made this twice - once with frozen lima beans and once with dried. I like the dried lima beans much better, even though it's a little more work. The consistency is more similar to mashed potatoes. I soaked the dried lima beans for 8 hours and then cooked them in with the garlic and rosemary. Also, I used a mixture of 1 T butter and 4 T olive oil, which goes well with the rosemary. This is a keeper in our home!

Good recipe - but agree it needed something. I added a cup of peas. I served it with yoghurt swirled in on the plate and a piece of herbed salmon on top. mmmmm!

Instead of frozen lima beans, I used some fresh local butter beans in this recipe with great results. The only downside was the resulting color - a greyish green! Despite the color, the recipe was great and would likely have a more pleasant hue if frozen light colored limas were used! A must try!

Very good. Even people who don't like lima beans love it. I subsitute 3 cups chicken stock for 3 cups of the water.

Wow! I took advice and cooked 2 packages of beans in a can of Swanson's Chicken Broth to bump up the flavor, which was far more than the sum of its simple parts. I would imagine that if the beans were cooked in more broth and not drained before being pureed, this would make a wonderful soup. I will say that this might be more appropriate as a carbo, rather than a veg.

I thought this was great! I might try adding a little bit of ginger, or maybe a tinge of lemon, to lighten the taste up a bit. Highly recommend... also a good recipe because it doesn't have all that heavy cream in it.

outstanding! cooked the beans in chicken broth for a tad more flavor and no extra salt to add. loved the fact that my lima bean hating husband was begging for more! great with the lamb!

I HATED lima beans up to now; I believe it's the smooth texture of this recipe that makes all of the difference. This is a quick, inexpensive, and healthy recipe (I reduced the butter by more than half). I've served this puree as both a side dish for lamb and as a pita spread when I'm having Mediterranean appetizers. When I'm out of fresh roseamry I put a little dried rosemary in cheese cloth and place it in the boiling water along with the favas. It's really great to have discovered a new taste sensation!

This was very good ... served it with leg of lamb, and even the skeptics at the table tried it and had seconds. Unfortunately, my "reserved cooking liquid" got accidentally dumped, so I used milk to moisten the beans, which thankfully worked. I'll definitely make this dish again.

I made this with a boneless leg of lamb and it was a hit. Not only is it beautiful on the plate, the texture and taste are phenomenal! I used chicken broth instead of water to boil the beans and did not need any salt at all. So YUMMY! It definitely takes the guilt out of comfort food b/c that's what it tastes like. It's also very easy to make, I have made it just for myself for dinner with one pkg of baby lima's and had leftovers for lunch the next day! YUM

I served this to company and would not tell them what it was... they couldn't guess..They all loved it even when I told them it was Lima beans.

Like many of you I'm sure, I grew up hating lima beans, but when I received the monthly recipes from Epicurious in my email, my eye caught this side dish recipe and drew me in. I was determined to keep an open mind and the puree factor intrigued me - DON'T be afraid of this recipe! It was surprisingly outstanding! A far cry from the icky boiled, hard-on-the-outside texture mom used to make.. packed with flavor and rich - almost too rich for the heavy lamb. The only thing I did differently was to use chicken broth instead of water and therefore needed less salt at the end. Great leftovers for our 10 month old baby too.

Fantastic! Easy to make and very tasty. Same effect as mashed potatoes without the guilt.
