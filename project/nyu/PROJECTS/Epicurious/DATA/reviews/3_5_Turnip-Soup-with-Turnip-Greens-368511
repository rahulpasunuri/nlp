For those who don't think this soup has enough flavor, saute fresh garlic, fresh fennel, onion and celery in butter til soft. Add turnip and sweat further. Then add chicken stock and simmer til turnips are done. Puree and add cream. sometimes I stir in crumbled crisp bacon right before serving.

I only had about a half pound of turnips so I made up the difference with an assortment of potatoes from my CSA box, subbed the butter for olive oil and the milk for almond milk, making it dairy-free and it was delicious! Oh, and I didn't have the tops so I sautéed kale with garlic and garnished with that.

A lovely, sustaining fall soup. Beautiful little white turnips from the farmers market didn't need to be peeled or pre-boiled, and the greens were very tender. A stick blender made it so easy. Everyone loved it--kids too. A keeper.

much tastier than anticipated.

Inspired by young fresh white turnips in the market and fresh thyme in my garden --and leeks are key too--this makes a delicate delicious soup. I didn't peel the turnips and I caramelized them slowly in the butter. Yum.

this really lacked flavor, the thyme was actually quite nice, but it wasn't enough for us.

This was, much to my surprise, pretty good. I didn't have 4 cups of milk, so I used 2 cups whole milk, 1 cup 2% milk, 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 1/2 cup water. The soup turned out rich yet light. The fresh thyme is necessary - I can't imagine how flavorless this would be if you tried to use dried. The sauteed greens on top absolutely make the soup. Don't skip that part! Oh, and it only took me about 10 minutes to cook the soup until the turnips were tender.
