This is pretty amazing. Had trouble when the hot pepitas melted my blender gear. But there is something haunting about this recipe. Like a fried Oyster and Bacon sandwich. Love it, and am making it for my mom.

To basil cook from Tulsa, please dear dont ruine a perfect Mayan Rcepie, with basil, I know that basil is an extraordinary herb, I love it, but please make the tomatoe sauce adding 3 or 4 epazote leaves instead basil, because with the basil you are giving an italian touch to a Mexican Prehispanic Plate, don´t miss the oportunity to taste somenting very delicious!!!!

This is a Prehispanic recepie, a Plate reserve it just for the Dzules, the pepita sauce is made it with epazote leaves to get the perfect taste,not oregano pls., and the tomatoe sauce has to be broiled with the full habanero, not cut, just brave people eat habanero. Good recepie, I love Papadzules, but please if you want to eat habanero chili, be sure that you have a big cold beer on hand, with lemon and salt, enjoy!!!!!

To A Cook from Chicago on 11/16/00. You do the same thing when you use eggs!!! Same animal, different form.

This was definitely greater than the sum of its parts. I used most of a jalapeno instead of the habanero and it was perfect. The pumpkin seed sauce is excellent, very subtle and perfect with the egg filling.

for the reviewer from Chicago who had a problem with the chicken stock.... easy fix.... substitute veggie stock or get some veggie chicken stock (they probably have it at your local natural foods store)

when you use chicken stock you leave the realm of vegetarian recipes!!!!!!!!!

A tasty addition to my recipe file. I experimented with substituting 4 large fresh basil leaves (finely chopped) for the oregano because I think basil brings out tomato flavor better. (Will try the oregano next time). I also substituted red chili peppers for the Habaneros for just a little less heat. The corn tortillas were the perfect flavor accompaniment to the sauce.
