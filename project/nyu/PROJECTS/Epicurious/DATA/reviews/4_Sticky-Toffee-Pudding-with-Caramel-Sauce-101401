This is one of the most delicious desserts I have ever made. I'm not a baker, and I found it super easy. The one thing that I did was put half the batter in the pan, then added 1 cup of the sauce and topped it with the remaining batter. Baking time didn't change, but the result...HEAVEN!

Best "Pudding" in the bakery. Beautilful Flavor and color. Great recipe.

I've cooked the sauce for at least half-hour and it still isn't reduced enough but my house smells wonderful. I've made this before and I guess I forgot how long that part took. And as usual, I overboiled the dates so I have a mess on my stove.

I was a little disappointed in the texture: the cake just wasn't as dense and moist as the STPs I've had (and loved) in the UK. I did halve the recipe for a party of four and adjusted baking time accordingly, but it just didn't pack the wallop I was hoping for. Lovely caramel sauce (and, yes, I was glad it made so much, because the cake needed a good soak!). I'll give it another chance, but I'll try poking tiny holes in the cake, pouring more sauce on the top, and letting it sit for several hours.

I really loved this recipe, particularly because it is really, really simple and uses ingredients I typically have in my cupboard. The batter looks pretty gross, but the end result is a different color and looks nice in a bundt. The cake is very moist and the sauce is pretty decadent. I served it with vanilla ice cream. I made a half batch of caramel and unlike other reviewers, I feel i might have needed a little more because I sliced up half the cake and poured most of the sauce on those slices. The only changes I made to the cake were: I added 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tsp vanilla (I can't do without vanilla in cake). To the sauce I added a little Jamesons, vanilla and sea salt. I really think the caramel needs salt to give the flavors the most depth.

I made this twice over the holidays, both times a huge success. I did add 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice. The recipes that I found in the UK all add 'spice mix' which is similar to pumpkin pie spice. BTW a Pudding in the UK is a dessert.

A true hit! It was delicious as written, but I tweaked the sauce the second time (and subsequent) times I made it. It's essentially the same, but I added a bit of salt and a splash of acid (vinegar or lemon juice)--just the thing for caramels to brighten and round out the flavors.

I forgot to mention, I tossed a few cardamon pods into the sauce as it simmered & removed before using. This added a subtle warmth that was outstanding.

The heights of deliciousity of this recipe cannot be underestimated! I 1/2d the recipe & used a 9" springform, and used a bit less sugar than called for & served with creme fraiche. This goes into the rotation! PS also, EASY!!!

The May 1998 version of STP is more labor intensive, but much better tasting. I didn't cook this nearly as long as suggested. The cake was dry, and the sauce wasn't enough to moisten it up. I'm going to try to make bread pudding out of it now.

It is my pleasure to recommend this most excellent STP recipe. I make this dessert a lot and use many different recipes for it but this one makes a prettier final product than most and if you have a heavy hand with the caramel sauce pour during the final segment of baking (at LEAST one cup if not more) it is irresistible.

Very good and pretty easy. Makes way too much caramel sauce - you could probably save money and cut that sauce in half.

The flavors of this pudding are dead-on for the sticky toffee pudding I had in the Lakes District in England. Yum!! I only used/needed half the sauce, though, and would recommend serving with some sort of cream - whipped or not - to cut the sweetness and round out the dish. This is definitely a keeper recipe, though.

Just made the sauce - very sweet and decadent, but excellent with bread pudding. I added 3 tablespoons of bourbon to the mix which spiced up the flavor a bit and cut the sweetness an iota. It was so easy to make - I was impressed by the payoff for the small amount of effort.

Sooo delicious. I made 3/4 of the sauce and it was enough. I also only used 1 cup of brown sugar in the sauce. This is one of my all-time favorite dessert recipes!

This was absolutely delicious and far easier to make than the original steamed pudding, which I always search out during my annual trips home to England. My college-age son ate half the cake without the sauce the day it was made! I would pour more of the caramel sauce over the cake during the cooking process next time and skip serving it with the cake. Of course, to make this truly authentic you have to serve it with custard.

I love sticky toffee pudding. Since having it the first time at the Blue Heron restaurant in Kinsale, Ireland, I've been somewhat addicted and have it whenever It's been on the menu... I'm not much of a cook but I followed the directions carefully and the dessert came out amazingly well. I had to keep checking on the cake to make sure it didn't overcook. The pudding lasted well in the fridge for about a week until my wife and I finished it off. I will definately make this again but hide it to keep it all for myself.

My family is British and we love sticky toffee pudding. I couldn't get the family recipe from anyone (they've all gone health-conscious on me) so when I found this one I thought I'd give it a try. I was thrilled with the result - it's pretty darn good! I made it both this Christmas and last; I'm just an amateur and it's not hard. The dough looks like not much but it bakes up beautifully, and the sauce is incredible. How much sauce you need depends on the group -- some use it all and want more and some don't use much at all, if any.

I halved the recipe. The sauce was incrediable (I boiled it for 2 mins then simmered it for 15 mins, the cake was good but the sauce really made this dessert good. I served it with creamed honey ice- cream that I also got from this website. Good enough.

I've been dying to make this recipe for quite a while. I made 3/4 the sauce recipe and added 3 Tbs. Cognac and subtracted 3 Tbs. cream. The sauce took much longer than 6 minutes to reduce (maybe 15?) and never thickened as much as I expected. It did have wonderful flavor. The cake itself was good; it would've been less interesting w/o the chopped pecans I added. For all the butter in the cake, all the cream in the sauce, all the grams of FAT (!) I really would've expected something much better. My husband really liked it (and liked the caramel sauce on the ice cream served w/ the cake), but I doubt I'll make it again. It's just so much fat & calories for only a decent pay-off. I'll definetly move on to a different dessert recipe.

I served this at a birthday party and everyone loved it. I am a chocaholic and even I loved it. Not so fond of the sauce though, I prefer vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. I added chopped walnuts, and everyone said it would not be as tasty without the nuts.

I made this recipe for my family last Thanksgiving this was the only dessert completely gone by the end of the night. Everyone loved it and even used the sauce on the plain cheesecake! I saved it to be our Christmas dessert this year. Sweet and yummy!

This recipe was so yummy! My 3 children loved it and I have already decided that it will become a holiday tradition! It is much better served warm than at room temp. I served it with homemade whipped cream rather than ice cream and it was a sure hit! Enjoy!

I fell in love with sticky toffee pudding while in England and was delighted to have found this recipe. As I was making this, I was disappointed and a little discouraged with how the date mixture looked and smelled and the consistency of the batter but I kept at it. The end result was fabulous. I served it to my family and they loved it. The cake is bland without the sauce but I don't think you need to make the full amount of caramel sauce.

The consistency of this receipe is really that of a date cake and not a pudding. Comparing to other date cakes, there are better ones. Serves about 15 people. The sauce is too sweet.
