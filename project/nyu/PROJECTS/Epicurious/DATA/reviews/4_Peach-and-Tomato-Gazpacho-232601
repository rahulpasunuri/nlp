I am surprised this has such great reviews. I made it according to the directions...but I wish I had used basil like some of the other reviewers. Mine was very acidic, almost like a salsa. I preferred eating it with chips or bread, in fact, as the acid was too much. Will not try to tweak it to make it again. used very good local, in season fruits to no avail!

Easy to make and very tasty. I made a few changes. Added a cumcumber, a sweet onion, 2 stalks of celery, a serrano pepper and no ice or shallots. Would make again

I made this Saturday morning for a dinner that evening. I used very flavorful peaches and tomatoes and other than adding a little fresh jalapeno pepper, followed the recipe completely. I served it and it was OK. Just OK. I added this to my mental list of over-rated Epicurious recipes. I had some left over and was going to toss it but pulled it out of the refrigerator today (4 days after making it) and had it for lunch. Holy rip! This was the best cold soup and gazpacho I've ever had. The flavors of the peaches, tomatoes and tarragon were superb together and each flavor was very identifiable. In the future, I'll make it 3 or 4 days in advance and let the flavors meld before serving. It just didn't cut it on day 1. It's definitely on my list of keeper recipes.

I have made this several times now, and is a great success each time. Very easy to put together as well. The key is to use peaches at their peak and fresh farm tomaotes with plenty of flavor. I have made some modifications to improve it: replace taragon with loads of fresh basil, no ice or water, use frozen mango and/or orange juice instead,put in freezer for a few minutes just prior to serving, finish with dollop of creme fraiche when serving, accompany with chili lime tostadas.

Excellent recipe. I used some yellow and red onion instead of the shallots. Used the 1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, 2 peaches and 1 mango. Used fresh basil from the garden and added some green pepper Tabasco sauce. Just a wonderful blend of flavors. Next time, I will try tomato, peach and watermelon (had it in a restaurant and it was another great combo).

This recipe has a great flavor profile, and I'm always thrilled to find a gazpacho variant that doesn't rely on bell peppers (allergy). That said, I much prefer not using a blender, instead sending all the referenced ingredients through a food mill and proceeding with the rest of the recipe from there. Blending aerates the ingredients to what I find an unpleasantly light color and overly smooth texture. I either refrigerate afterwards or add ice/water after to modify consistency.

That was delicious! What a treat on a hot day in Hollywood. I'll be making this again FOR SURE! (Neither the peaches nor the tomatoes I used were particularly flavorful and it was delightful nontheless. Next time I might try some frozen peaches and some fancier tomatoes...)

I pureed all the peaches and tomatoes (skipped the salsa), used tarragon vinegar, added the ice/water at the end and added a cruton. Served this at a ladies' luncheon. They loved it!

Delicious soup. Used garden fresh tomatoes and fresh peaches, tarragon white wine vinegar and fresh tarragon. I ate this with a rice cake for dinner and it was superb. I plan on making it again this weekend.

I made this recipe several times this summer and all the variations were delicious. I skipped the sieve and the ice. Instead I used a combination of fresh and frozen peaches. I used basil fresh from the garden in lieu of tarragon. Friends and family voted on their favorite version (the frozen fruit varied) with fresh peaches and frozen mango being the winner.

We made a large batch of this and really enjoyed it. We used small sweet cherry tomatoes with good results and had to substituted purple onion for shallot. I think it would be interesting to add just a touch of piquant flavoring like maybe a slice of jalapeño?

EXCELLENT! Weird combination but it sure works. If you use dried tarragon, let it rest overnight to get full benefit of this tasty herb.

Rating: 4
this was delightful! Used wonderful end of season peaches and tomatos from the farmers market. I used fresh thyme instead of tarragon because that is what I have in my garden. Next time I will try the tarragon. I didn't strain it. I was still able to serve it in wine glasses for a walk around sipping appetizer at a bridal shower.

I just LOVE this, I've been making it once a week this summer. With tomatoes and peaches in season, it is delicious. The fresh tarragon adds a lot to it. I suspect it's not nearly as good with winter tomatoes though-- the roasted tomato and bell pepper soup with mint (another personal favorite) on this site might be better if your tomatoes aren't great.

I saw this and loved the concept - I did tweak it a bit - roasted the tomatoes, shallots and peaches together before blending them. The roasting just intensifies the flavor. I made this for our wine club, pairing it with prosecco - really good!

would it be possible to make this into a sorbet? just freeze in an ice cream maker?

Made this for a picnic & got fantastic reviews. I used frozen peaches which were slightly thawed & therefore needed no ice, plus frozen fruit is at peak of flavor. I also used a little tarragon vinegar instead of totally wine vinegar. I had to add tarragon & tarragon vinegar in the end to get it to taste as I thought it should, but pretty much stuck to the recipe. I have served for nice luncheons & picnics, always gets wonderful reviews. It's a perfect light, summer soup!

haven't done yet, but want to do for a summer dinner party and am worried my tomatoes will ripen before the date arrives! can i make it in advance and freeze, anyone know? concerned about losing freshness of tomato flavor as well as losing texture....

Excellent, even with peaches that were less than flavorful! I've made this soup several times with amazing results. The only time I bothered to strain it was when I used cherry tomatoes that had too many seeds, otherwise I thought that the texture was better without straining. On one occasion I brought it to a large pot-luck dinner and everyone loved it!

This was OK but not worth the work. I used fresh tomatoes and peaches. Only sub was basil for tarragon. Sorry........just not much flavor!

I thought this was very tasty for a quick recipe and a really great way to use summer produce. Like a previous reviewer, I substituted basil for tarragon. Topped it off with a homemade parmesan crouton. Very nice.

Made this last night for a couple of foodie friends-- one of whom is a well-respected sommelier here in Dallas. So I am pleased to say that he thought it was fabulous! Like other reviewers, I did not strain the soup. Oh, and I ended up with some leftover salsa, so next time I might set aside a little less of the chopped tomatoes and peaches to make more puree and less topping. One more thing: I used basil instead of tarragon, and it worked beautifully.

My husband loved this soup, I liked it but would not rave about it. I have made other gazpacho recipes that I thought were as good or better. Might make it again, since it was a hit with my husband. As per some other posts, I did not use sieve, and thought consistancy was fine.

A different approach to gazpacho. The touch of sweetness with the peaches is surprising.

Refreshing and unique. I also used different colors of heirloom tomatoes and didn't put it through a sieve. I'm always looking for new snazzy cold soups that will wow guests, and this definitely makes the grade.

I decided not to seive. I put all ingredients together in one pot to use a hand blender. I substituted 3 tablespoons of chopped onion (which i let sit in a bowl of water for 5 minutes before utilization) instead of shallots and used dry thyme instead of fresh tarragon. The soup turned out very good except for one thing. If you do use dry thyme, you may want to let it sit and soak the moisture as it was a bit hard. Otherwise, the soup was veeeery good! Did a little taste right after completion and couldnt stop myself from having a bowl.

Phenomenal. I think it's worth the (very small) trouble of straining it. It makes the soup much more elegant and refined. Such great flavors!

Rating: 3
This was good even though the idea of peaches and tomatoes blended together was still a slight hang-up for me. Next time I'll use a touch more pepper and vinegar, and use a larger-mesh sieve or dispense with the seive altogether.

Excellent, excellent, excellent. I thought this soup was full of flavors that really complemented each other well. The peach chunks in the salsa blended so nicely with the smooth soup. I also did not bother to sieve the solid ingredients as per the other reviewers.

After reading all the great reviews and being a lover of different food ideas, I was eager to try this. It was okay, but I must say I was disappointed. I don't understand where all the raves came from. So, being disappointed, I played around with it a bit - added more peaches, nectarines, blueberries (for color) and honey (thinking sweeter might be better). None of it really made any improvementsm, and lack of time forced me to quit.

This is incredibly easy and fabulous-- I've made it for a number of summer dinner parties and it's always been a hit. Like others have mentioned, I didn't strain and only added the crushed ice with no additional water. I've used balsamic vinegar when I didn't have white wine and it was fantastic as well.

This was wonderful. I used Palisade Colorado peaches at their prime. I liked the texture without straining the soup - makes it even easier than the original. Would also make a wonderful confit when plating a light fish such as rockfish or tilapia.

The essence of summer. Used locally grown tomatoes and peaches, and tarragon from my garden. Combination looks unlikely, but turns out fabulous.

This soup is addictive. I added minced shallots to the salsa. I think I'll add a little heat to the soup next time - maybe a little fresh jalapeno or cubanelle pepper. It's a lovely summer soup.

Served this soup as a first course to friends with very sophisticated palates...there was silence (I got nervous!). Then the raves came. whew! Only change I made was to use 2T of my own 3-fruit vinegar plus used heirloom tomataoes and ripe local peaches. Easy, quick, and memorable.

The Peach & Tomato Gazpacho is excellent--refreshing and uniquely-flavored. I liked using fresh peaches, tarragon, and tomatoes, which are so abundant this time of year. I did not have white wine vinegar, and substituted with a raspberry-blush vinegar...delicious. Picture a garden party in August featuring Peach & Tomato Gazpacho!
