My friends and I really enjoyed these as appetizers. Based on previous reviews that said the mushrooms got watery, I baked them for 8 minutes, blotted them with a paper towel; baked them for 3 more minutes, and blotted them again. I then assembled the pizzas & refrigerated them for several hours. I took them out of the fridge for about 1/2 hour, then baked them at 350 for 15 minutes. They were really yummy, and not at all watery.

This is a really good and very easy recipe. I used leftover Classico Sauce with Tomatoes and Basil that I added sauteed sweet Italian sausage and chopped mushrooms, green peppers and onions - from my freezer. I filled the mushrooms with the sauce and topped with mozzarella, etc. I served with a salad for a great weeknight dinner.

A nice change. I think with a turkey sausage it would make a good low carb pizza.

These are incredibly easy and tasty. My friend and I love having these with chicken basil sausage from the local market. They can be a little watery so don't let them sit around too long.

The mushroom itself was quite watery and bland, but the toppings were good. Next time, I will salt the mushroom cap to see if this helps with seasoning and water extraction. My husband quite liked it, though.

This got 3 thumbs up from my family. Definitely a keeper - this from my 12 year old who's just learning to like mushrooms.

This has become our family favorite. I use little mushrooms for appetizers and the large ones for dinner. I vary the toppings each time, but our favorite now is to substitute a drop (for the appetizer size) of light boursin cheese for the tomato sauce, a slice of pepporini, mozerella cheese , a round of an already sauted red pepper and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. The result is outstanding!! And it's easy to bake and assemble and then refrigerate, and bake the next day for a simple, simple party appetizer.

Delicious, quick, and lighter than regular pizza. I followed the recipe exactly and actually prefered the portobellos to pizza crust.

I combined this recipe with the Sausage Stuffed Mushrooms recipe, also from Epicurious, filling a couple of large portobellos with each of the stuffings. I skipped the sauteying part of this recipe and just baked them all at 350 degrees (per the other recipe) for a delicious meal which was easier, faster, and used less cookwear than the instructions for this one. I also used hot turkey sausage for a more healthy meal. Very, very good!

This wasn't a drop dead delicious recipe but it was pretty good. I have never had portobella mushrooms before and they are stronger than regular mushrooms but not too strong. I will make this again as something different.

I've made this three times, each with slight variations. I have also used larger portobellas. Simply top this with your favorite pizza toppings. Have used green onion, chopped tomato, chopped garlic, also added a touch of fresh grated parmesan and romano cheeses. Also added chopped basil and chopped sage. So far has received rave reviews from everyone that have tried it. I also never bothered scraping the dark gills. Why bother?

I don't know how this recipe recieved such great ratings. I thought it was mediocre at best and I used a good marinara sauce. Portobellos are so versatile and this website has too many recipes for me to waste my time on this one again.

This is a great recipe. It is simple to be sure and receives rave reviews. I will make again.

This was a great twist on pizza. I used a basil and sun-dried tomato chicken sausage and added the sausage to a jar of Prego. The edges of my mushroom caps fell apart, but they still held the sauce and cheese (fresh buffalo-milk mozzarella). Really good flavor and surprisingly filling.

Really great- better than pizza with a crust. We are on the Sugar Busters diet and this worked out perfectly for us. I used pizza sauce, red onions, bell peppers, pepperoni, black olives and fresh mozzarella. Will definitely make it again. Thanks for your site- I love it.

I am on a very low carbohydrate diet and these "pizzas" fit the bill perfectly! So good that I don't feel the least bit deprived!

This was so easy to make, and feels much healthier. However, portobellos are really expensive in my area. Other than that, I'd make them more often!

This recipe was great! Everyone enjoyed it. You can make it ahead (except for the final cooking), it's quick,and three or four people have asked for the recipe.

This is a very good and easy recipe to prepare. I have added whatever toppings I have available and have served with a caesar salad for a light summer meal. Delicious!

This is a fantastic, quick dish for hard working good eating families. My kids even ask for them. They even like to top their own.

Rave reviews at dinner for 30 where this was one of 4 "pizza" appetizers. This one received the greatest acclaim.

I used pepperoni, black olives and roasted garlic as toppings on two occasions & it was delicious. Quick, easy and very tasty - it makes pizza seem "good" for you.

Have already made it 3 times and love it. Easy, fast, a lot less fattening than using dough
