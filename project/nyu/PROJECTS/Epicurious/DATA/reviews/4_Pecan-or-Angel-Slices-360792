I agree with other reviewers -- this recipe is heavenly. I made the pecan version of it as a Christmas dessert, and my family loved it.

this is an easy, delicious, never-fail recipe. the toasty, buttery crust in combination with the nutty filling is perfect. I have made both with the coconut and without. the coconut seems to melt into the filling and creates an extra flavor layer. i have made for 20 years and will continue to make forever as my go-to holiday cookie.

Although I've never used the coconut (Joy of Cooking gives extra pecans as an alternative), this is one of the best Christmas bars out there. They are easy to make and the travel well.
