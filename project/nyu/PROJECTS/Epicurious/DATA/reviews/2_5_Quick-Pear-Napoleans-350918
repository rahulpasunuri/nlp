I don't think using canned pears is "French elegance". A timesaver isn't worth it if it results in lower quality. I used fresh pairs (2 anjou and 2 bosc), peeled them and sliced them 1/8" thin. I softened them in melted butter then followed the rest of the recipe. Delicious - without the taste of a tin can.
