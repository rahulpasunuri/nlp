Made this again for another dinner party. Everyone practically licked their plates--even the one person who supposedly does not like apricots! Made the caramel sauce from the "Pumpkin Bread Pudding" recipe--very easy and yummy. Also dipped extra dried apricots in melted dark chocolate, chilled them and served with a bit of whipped cream on each slice of bread pudding! Fabulous!!!! Make sure you use the dark orange dried apricots--NOT the plump , very pale ones.

For those looking for the original caramel sauce that was printed with this recipe from The Winchester Country Inn, you can find it by searching for "caramel sauce" with a January 2000 date.... it has no apple cider in it.

I made this recipe with egg bread (challah), extra apricots and half-and- half instead of 1/2 of the whipping cream. It's very tasty.

This is the best dessert - one of my favourites . . . it never dissapoints and my guests can never have enough of it. Heaven in a baking dish.

In a word: Fabulous!! Pay no attention to the review from West Vancouver, BC. We follow this recipe to the "T" and do not change a thing. Inexpensive grand marnier is satisfactory; don't waste the good stuff! Great for a crowd and nice that it can be put together the night before to be baked the next day. (recipe can be halved) The caramel sauce recipe is NOT the orginal recipe attached to his bread pudding.

Cheater recipe. My family and I only had one serving each then it sat in the fridge until we had to throw it out. Makes a huge amount but is uninteresting.

I love this recvipe as do all my guests. I do change thingsthough. I use half and half instead of whip. creacm, I leve out the 1/4 C. of water, I use more than a cup of apricots, I use the caramel sauce recipe for pumpkin bread pudding. I use french bread and don't take off the crusts--I like the crusts!

I made this dish for a family Christmas Party and everyone loved it. I had doubled the recipe so there was enough left over for friends -- everyone raved about it. Easy to make, but very rich and elegant -- I'll be making it again for a visiting friend who had heard about it "through the grapevine" and can't wait to try it. Think I'll include some toasted almonds this time around as well as some fresh whipped cream along with the carmel sauce...

Fabulous!! Made it for 2 dinner parties in a row--everyone raved. Thanks to the reader who said the caramel sauce in the recipe is the wrong one. I went looking for the right one and found it. Just do a search on caramel sauces. Interestingly, it saves in my recipe box as caramel-apple cider sauce, even though it contains no apple cider. Think they've screwed up the link somehow. Other than that, it is truly wonderful, and with the right caramel sauce, divine. By the way, had a little of the custard left over (dish too small) the second time, so just baked it (without bread) in water like a flan. Fabulously smooth and creamy with that Gran Marnier flavor.

I've made this recipe several times, to rave reviews. I modified it a bit by adding dried cherries as well as the apricots--and that was before the other Bon Appetit recipe for apricot bread pudding with dried cherries was published. It looks festive during the holidays with that addition and it adds a bit of tartness to the recipe. One note, the cider caramel sauce that is published with the web version of this recipe is not the same as the one that was in the January 2000 issue of the magazine. A friend of mine tried this one and said it was weird. Cider and carmel are a good combo, obviously, but over apricots and croissants???? I use the caramel sauce that's in the magazine and its wonderful.

The bread pudding haters were WOWED by this....I just used a jar of hot caramel sauce. Made the bread pudding early in the day and stuck it back in the oven (turned off) when I took the dinner out. It was nice and warm by dessert time....microwaved the Kraft caramel and put it on top when serving. To die for.......making it again next week for a Christmas party.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I must admit I am not very fond of bread pudding, but neither was the person who requested the recipe from the restaurant, so I thought I would give it a try. This recipe was too eggy and oily for me. It did not make me change my mind about bread pudding.

You must try this...it really is scrumptious. For a striking presentation I used a glass to cut out circles from the pudding and placed one on each plate. Then took a small container of haagen das vanilla bean, laid it on its side and sliced through the container to create 4 round pieces of ice cream. One round of the ice cream on each pudding circle...with the warm sauce poured over...really nice. All my guests loved it. One extra note...on one occasion I tried melting caramels I had on hand in lieu of making the sauce...big mistake...upon hitting the ice cream the caramel hardened to a crisp...not good, my friend.

I've made this recipe 4 times throughout the year since it came out in Jan. 2000. Everyone raves about it and begs me to make it again. It's a given for New Year's Day dinner. I don't have ready made croissants at our grocery store (I'm in Northern Michigan) so I used the canned variety(3cans)--they were fine. Excellent all the way. This review comes from Florida right now since I leave those terrible, Northern Michigan winters!

I made this and brought it to work. It was so good, the next time I had to make two trays so there would be enough! As soon as everyone smelled it heating in the kitchen they came running. Lots of people said it was better then any other bread pudding they'd ever tasted! I agree.

I thought this was yummy. I didn't have Grand Marnier so I substituted something my neighbor had... Nassau Royale Liqueur. When I make this again, I will use GM but even with the substitution it was still really good and EASY. I used the caramel sauce that goes with the Brownie ice cream sandwiches.

Delicious! I will try it without the water bath next time since I like a little crispier texture. I used Apricot Brandy and thought it was fabulous.

The person who made it cut down on the amount of liqueur she added and it was a little rich. I think the liqueur is necessary to round out the flavors. The achohol cooks out so that it not a problem. This is a marvelous bread pudding recipe even to a transplanted Southerner!

A Cook from Phoenix on 03/24/00 A friend made this for our monthly cooking class. It was the HIT of the day!!! It was sooo good that we're having it as our dessert dish for our end of the yr. picnic!! My friend didn't know whether to use lg. or sm. croissants. She used 4 1/2 lg. ones. Also substituded 3/4 c. Triple Sec and jarred caramel sauce. The results were wonderful! A truly delicious, easy, comfort food dessert!!!!

I work at a restaurant and I made this for one of our desserts. Both the Executive and Sous chefs said that it was impossible to make bread pudding with croissants. Not only did I love proving them wrong, but now they are spoiled and want all bread puddings to have this flavor & texture.

I made this for a dinner party, my husband said it was the best desert I had ever made. I took the left overs to work and my colleagues keep asking when I will make it again.I, myself am not a desert person, and I even loved it.

The recipe itself is very easy and the addition of the apricots gives an otherwise ordinary dessert staple a refreshing twist!

This recipe is one of the easiest I've ever made, and everyone who tasted it thought it was wonderful. My only suggestion is to decrease the Grand Marnier (I used Triple Sec); the apricots fight a losing battle with the strong orange flavor.
