Outstanding dressing. I have given this dressing recipe to at least a dozen people. There is no substitute for sherry wine vinegar! It's tough to find and expensive, but worth it. I usually add crumbled blue cheese, sliced mushrooms and cherry tomatoes to a mixed green salad, with this dressing. Everyone raves.

The dressing was good, but nothing to write home about. It tasted a bit tart despite the olive oil, so I seasoned it very generously with salt and pepper. This still didn't add much to the end result, so I added a bit of chopped basil. The dressing was "fine", but nothing special nor memorable.

Great dressing. Add some fresh basil for added flavor.

We thought this was delicious, and we will be having it again. I prefer recipes to add ounces for the greens instead of just cups, I ended up with a lot of extra dressing.
