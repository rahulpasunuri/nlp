I agree with the other two reviews-- the crust was too soggy! My only suggestion to salvage this recipe would be to partially bake the crust (like a pie) and then finish baking the crust with the fruit mix added on top.

There must be some mistake in this recipe. It is terrible, just like previous reviewer said. I scraped the fruit off the top to use without the gummy "crust".

The "crisp" on the bottom came out thick and doughy and the whole thing was overly sweet. It was pretty yucky.
