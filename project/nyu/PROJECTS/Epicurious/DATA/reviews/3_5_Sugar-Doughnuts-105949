This is almost identical to the Cooks Illustrated recipe and is pretty fantastic. We add an extra egg yolk, nutmeg and vanilla. Sometimes we coat them in cinnamon sugar, although we've also used a simple glaze of 10x sugar, heavy cream, and almond extract. You'll want to fry them a bit more than you expect - ours have a tendency to be undercooked in the middle, even when we made them smaller than called for. Easy, quick and yummy.

Really good recipe for doughnuts w/ the consistency of almos a cake. They have to be cooked 1min/side. I added 1tsp of cinnamon to the dough to make the dough more delicious.

I disagree with rolling them 1/3 inch thick--that was too thin. The few I had that were a bit thicker were more delicious. I would recommend really using a thermometer for the oil. I didn't, and it was probably too hot as they browned up very quickly and some of the fatter ones therefore had underdone centers--though that is also because I used a glass to cut them and didn't put holes in the middle. Overall, though, these are ridiculously easy to roll out, have a nice texture, and could be the base for all kinds of toppings/glazes.

i changed the recipe arount instead of adding buttermilk i added 3/4 cup of yogurt and 1/3 cup of water .they turned out good in the deep fryer.They were filling though but tasty with tea.

Too sweet and you don't need 3 quarts of oil! One quart is more than enough. Pretty bland. We prefer yeast-risen doughnuts, these are like cake. Try a yeasted doughnut recipe and you'll be a convert.

Good basic recipe. I had a craving for a cake donut .... so off to my fridge I went. To my dismay, no buttermilk, no milk period !!! So, I substituted 3/4 non-fat plain yougurt, plus 1/3 cup water. Added 2 tsp nutmeg and 3 tsp. vanilla (one reader said it was blah)..... and TADA !!! ...... pure heaven w/ a cup of coffee on a beautiful afternoon. Life is good ...... :)

This is a wonderful cake doughnut.My kids like them rolled in cinnamon/sugar or dipped in a fine sugar glaze. We love them for breakfast or as a snack with milk and/or coffee.

MY kids (age2-12) love this recipe. However I did make some changes. I cut them with a 1 inch round cookie cutter so when they fry they are like oversized donut holes which is what my kids love. Sometimes we roll them in regular sugar, and sometimes we sprinkle powdered sugar over them like beignets. We are from Louisiana so we love to have a taste of New Orleans whenever we can. Also these donuts are good all day long unlike some fried foods that need to be eaten as soon as they are fried. Also I cook the donuts about 10 degrees less than what the directions say so they don't get too brown. The texture is going to be a cross between and cake donut and a beignet or French donut. Also, my 2 and 4 year old love rolling and cuttin the donuts out. The dough is very kid friendly. Readers who were disappointed were probably expecting a yeast type donut. These are a cross between and a cake donut and a beignet or French donut. Eat these donuts with a cup of cafe au lait, put on some jazz music, and pretend you are in New Orleans. Enjoy!

Nothing special. Good for kids not adults. Very bland.

I made this recipe with a group of 8-10 year old kids in our weekly cooking class. The recipe is simple enough that the kids could handle it, and we had warm doughnuts to snack on. Simple and very yummy!
