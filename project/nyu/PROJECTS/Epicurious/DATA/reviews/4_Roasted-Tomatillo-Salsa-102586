Loved it. This was my first time making salsa and working with tomatillos and it came together quite nicely. Changes: I roasted all the veggies (not just the ones the recipe called instructed to), added 1/2 tsp cumin plus the juice and zest of 1/2 lime. Additionally, we used just 1 jalapeno and 1 poblano to keep it a bit milder. Reallly fantastic and will make it again.

I agree with others on roasting the veggies and cutting down the salt. Recommendations: add half the cilantro and less than half the onion called for, and 1/2 tsp salt. Once all processed, you can always add more salt, and finely chop or purée the onion and cilantro left over if you want more. I squeezed 1/4 of a juicy lime in, too, and used two jalapeños instead of the serranos. Rather mild, could go hotter.

A coworker gave me 1/2 a grocery bag of tomatillos, what to do? I supposed I should have weighed the bag and kept the exact recipe proportions, but I just dove in. Broiled the Tomatillos, peppers and garlic in four batches. Used about 25 serrano peppers, two small heads of garlic a couple large onions, 1-1/2 bunches of cilantro. GGGGOOOODDD stuff, hot like I like it. I will make per the recipe later, but this was great, especially warm out of the blender. Keeper recipe :)

My first time using tomatillos. I had about half the amount, so I halved everything, but I used 2 chiles since it seemed pretty hot. It didn't end up being too hot though. I used 2 garlic cloves, and replaced the cilantro with oregano because I have tons of that in my garden. Also used 1/2 tsp salt (that's half the amount suggested, as all my amounts were halved) since it seemed like too much. I really liked this and served it with some leftover roast chicken and pasta. Although my mother and husband also expressed interest, no-one really ate much and most of it was left in the bowl. I have to figure out how to serve it tomorrow.

Just made my first ever Tomatilla salsa, with ingredients fresh from my garden. YUM! 2 jalapenos and 1 serano provided the perfect heat!

Superb recipe. I'd never made anything with tomatillos before and definitely thought 5 chilis would be too hot. But the broiling mellowed the heat and brought out the flavour. Terrific on barbequed pork!

Rating: 4
This is KILLER. I roasted the onions along with the other veg, and used a mixture of poblano and jalapeno peppers. Just divine. And yes, once you have your salsa you absolutely should make the pork shoulder chile verde mentioned downthread. Simplest, cheapest, most crown-pleasingest recipe imaginable. With pinto beans and warm corn tortillas... YUM.

I reduced the salt to 1 tsp and will probably half it again next time I make it. Other than that, easy, simple, delicious summer snack! Some lime juice makes an excellent addition, too.

I made a couple of substitutions and this is BY FAR the best green salsa I have ever had. Being from Southern California, I definitely know my Mexican food and I'm telling you, follow my instructions...you won't be disappointed. In place of the serranos, use 3 poblanos and 3 jalapenos. The flavor is significantly different, because serranos are all spice and poblanos are full of flavor. I'm eating this with a spoon as we speak. Seriously. Delicious.

Rating: 4
Okay, I take back my review (immediately below). While this was incredibly spicy right when I made it, by the next day it was pretty mellow, and I would actually call it mild by day 3. How odd is that? I usually think things get hotter when they sit. Still think it's probably a 3-forker (delicious, but not exceptional), so I'm balancing my 2 rating with a 4.

Rating: 2
Are people crazy? I think this is a very good recipe, have made it a few times, but serrano peppers are more than twice as spicy as jalapenos. If I'd used all five serranos w/ seeds, it would have burned through any bowl I put it in! As it was, w/ 2 large jalapenos, mostly seeded, it was too hot for several of the people to whom I served it, and even the spice lovers were a little wowed.

Rating: 4
WOW! This is a great recipe. I roasted all as per previous reviews. 2 TSP was a bit overkill on the salt since we're going to use tortilla chips to eat the salsa. I'd suggest halving the salt-- you can always stir in more after tasting it. Like the lime at the end. It really brings the salsa together.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I made a couple simple changes: (1) roasted both a red and yellow onion with the other veggies (I had both); (2) added lime squeeze at the end. Really simple and very tasty!

Fantastic. Roasted on the grill instead of the oven. I can't take a lot of heat, so I was pessimistic, but the heat was perfect.

Very simple to make, and the flavors blend well together. The heat sneaks up on you, but is consistent throughout. Added half of a squeezed lime, which brought the salsa together nicely!

The first time I tried this recipe I forgot to add the 2 tsp salt. Being a salt lover I added a pinch to the final recipe. Have made this several times now and can't imagine that it needs more than a pinch. We prefer the texture of this salsa when a bit of the liquid is squeezed from the roasted tomatillos. The flavor is wonderful!

Mighty tasty stuff. I roasted the onions and next time will add more peppers cause I like more heat. Beautifully sweet.

I've never worked with tomatillos, but saw some at the farmer's market today and proceeded to also grab some jalapenos and cilantro. I came home to look for a recipe and liked the reviews. Other than using jalapenos and removing the seeds I followed the recipe exactly. Great fresh flavor and enough heat without overpowering the other flavors. Hard to believe it was soooo easy. Next time I'm skipping the oven and using the grill.

I've made this recipe a few times, and we love it! The amount of chillies varries each time I make it ...It really depends on the hotness of the chillies used. Recently I added a whole lime quartered, and poured the salsa over some pork shoulder, threw it in the oven at 300 for 4 hrs, as suggested by a previous reviewer...delicious!

Wow, this is excellent. Super spicy! Add one pepper at a time and monitor the hot-ness as you blend!

Very good! I made this entire recipe from what was in my garden except I added an avocado. Be sure to roast the vegetables until they are really charred. I only had 3 chiles and less than 1/4 cup of cilantro, which may explain why it only tasted 3 stars but this was certainly a simpler green salsa recipe than others I've used. I definitely make it again, but with more heat!

This recipe is excellent but the salt needs to be cut in half or even a quarter. I recommend starting with 0.5 t and adding to taste. 2 t is way too much!

The tomatillo is good...and versatile. I've used a touch of lime...sometimes a little Chipotle...Goya seasoning is your friend... Pour this salsa over a pork shoulder then cover with foil...bake at 300 for 4-5 hrs...shred the pork and invite your neighbors. Make sure they bring a "beverage" =)

Incredibly good and nearly effortless. We didn't have cilantro on hand and it was still delicious.

This is the easiest most delicious recipe. I used a variety of dried peppers, Ancho, Anaheim and Adobo and reconstituted them in hot water. I also roasted half the onions and used the rest raw. MMMMmmm, so good.!

Absolutely fantastic. Takes MUCH longer than the 15 minutes noted in order to allow cooling time. I made exactly as written (first time tried grilling the tomatillos, this time broiled). Will make again exactly as written.

this recipe is absolutely perfect, healthy & very easy. i doubled it as previously suggested, a smart idea. i roasted everything except the cilantro, added generous smoky chipotle, roasted serrano & ceballitos instead of raw onion. to the double order, i add 5 ripe avocads & juice of 4 limes. adobo instead of salt. use jicama for dipping instead of chips. absolutely stunning. and lasts awhile becaue of all the acid, the avocado does not get brown. this will be made regularly in my house from now on.

A very nice roasted tomatillo salsa but in the future I would roast or saute the onion. It was awfully stong.

This is yummy and easy. I used canned tomatillos -- not ideal, but all I could find. I used two jalapeno peppers and charred them with the garlic in a frying pan before pureeing everything. Tasted delicious, even with canned tomatillos.

Was really good and easy. Made great use of the tomatillos I got from my CSA. I added a bit too much salt which was easily remedied with a squeeze of lime juice. I also used basil (again from CSA) and added avocado. Got rave reviews from friends at our knitting club!

I LOVE this recipe. If you are going to the trouble to make it, I recommend doubling it. It is a standard in our house. I also roast the onions with everything else, and cut down the serranos (usually 2 + 1 jalapeno). I made it yesterday and added 1/2 of a roasted poblano pepper to the mix. I agree with the reviewer who suggested going light on the cilantro. You can always add more. This stuff in addicting!! Enjoy!

Delicious, beautiful, and easy. A real crowd-pleaser. Added some lime juice as suggested, and substituted 1 jalapeno and 2 serranos instead of 5 (still pretty hot). Roasted the onion along with everything else.

After broiling, I drained the liquid that had oozed out of the tomatillos (nearly a cup!), then blended. In past recipes, retaining the liquid had resulted in runny salsa. I also substituted 3 cayennes and 2 jalapenos for the 5 serranos and added 1/2 lime. It was quite tasty.

This is excellent and fast! I used one large jalapeno instead of the serranos and it had just the right heat.

I added a regular tomato because I ran out of tomatillo. Less chiles for the spicy impaired. Juice from 11/2 limes. Just make sure you char the tomatillos,garlic and peppers. It's fantastic.

Overall, this recipe is quite good. Selecting quality tomatillos is key- I first used the large green tomatillos and it came out sour. The 2nd time I used small purple tomatillos from the farmers market and it was delicious.

I don't understand why the intro to the recipe says use bottled salsa if pressed for time. Between the roasting and a couple pulses in the food processor, this took 10 minutes, tops! So easy and quick that not to use fresh salsa is a crime. Lime juice would have added to the taste, but didn't have any, so just stuck to the recipe as is. Really liked it.

Rating: 4
Forgot to add: because of the collective wimpiness of everyone's palates, I used on whole roasted jalapeno, and that was heat enough. More than that, and they would have run screamin.

Like a few others, added a bit of lime juice. Otherwise, absolutely perfect! My SO went nutty over this, and he is not easily impressed. Lots of flavor, complex, and delicious as is, only adding the lime as finishing touch! Because of scheduling difficulties I served this slightly warm, and it was still a real hit!

Rating: 4
The beauty of this salsa is the flavor from that comes from the roasting of the tomatillos and peppers. It has a kick, but doesn't fall prey to the 'how hot can we make this?' mentality. The range of pepper flavors and heat are the new frontier. Bobby Flay is the guide, but anyone with a respect for Scovill units and cooking techniques can enhance any almost dish with pepper or salsas made from peppers.

If you use 6 Serrano chilis, it would be a good idea to take the seeds out of 3 of them. This is hot enough to raise the top of your head off! But exceptionally good. The roasting is the secret!

Great as a dip or with fajitas. I didn't have serranos so I used two jalepenos instead. We grilled all the vegetables instead of broiling. Great salsa. Everyone enjoyed it and would make it again.

I used tomatillos from my garden and maybe they were too fresh, but they were overcooked before I gave up on their becoming charred. I also used jalapeno chiles from my garden, cut the onion in half and let it char slightly as well. My family liked this very much.

Rating: 3
Beware of exploding garlic! I'll probably just saute the garlic and onion instead next time. I added the cilantro and lime but not the serranos. True Tex-mex salsa verde isn't really very spicy. Tomatillo roasting time depends on size so some took up to 10 minutes. This was so easy that I'll make it more often! Yum!

We grilled everything and then added line juice from one lime (a must). It was great with grilled salmon and Mexican sour cream.

This is amazingly easy, quick, and best of all good. It makes a big batch. I have frozen it with good results. My guacamole has become famous due to this "secret ingredient".

5 serranos were a bit much for most of the crowd when they included seeds. For most, I'd do 3 peppers or 5 with their seeds removed. I also preferred this with a bit more cilantro and 1/4 cup of lime juice.

Thick,with a concentrated,slightly smoky flavor. This is so much better than boiling. Next time I'll also broil the onion,just to compare.

An absolute favorite!!! Add avocado for a great treat. I have also used one or 2 Chipolte peppers (canned)instead of the serranos for a different variation. Also makes a great simmering sauce for chicken or even pork.

I used fresh tomatillos and chilis from my garden to make this salsa and it was amazing! I left out the cilantro b/c I am allergic, added a couple extra cloves of garlic and the juice of half a lime. I mixed this salsa with fresh avocado and boy, it was a hit!

YUM!!! I used more garlic and blended the chopped onion with everything else. Everyone loved it!

Just as good as everyone says. I used vidalia onion instead of white onion. Since the recipe did not say what to do with the white onion, I added it raw after the other ingredients were blended. Also great to add to avocado to make guacamole. Definitely on my keeper list.

Very authentic. Now what to do with it aside from eating it by itself or on chilaquiles? Cook chunks of pork, ribs or farmer-style ribs in it..excellent! It doesn't get any easier than this. Make a double batch and cook your ribs in it a few days later. The vegetables can also be roasted on a gas burner if you don't mind making a mess, or put in a dry frying pan, turning often. We never use the broiler for this salsa. You can also use a gas barbecue.

This salsa is amazing, I found some lovely fresh organic tomatillos at our local co-op that were too beautiful to pass up, and used them in this recipe. I did add a bit of lime juice, my husband and I were eating spoonfulls amazed at the flavor. I know now what to do with tomatillos!!

What a treat!! This is the first time we have tried doing anything with tomatillos and we were not dissapointed. Along with the tomatillos we roasted the red onion we used. We substituted two large jalapeno peppers for the serranos and added two tablespoons of lime. An immediate familly favorite!!

Not for the faint of tongue! The smell of roasted tomatillos, serranos and garlic will transport you to Mexico when pureed. Mixes lusciously with mashed avocado and added to scrambled eggs or as a topping for grilled fish. I make it regularly-ingredients are inexpensive and readily available. I do have Rick Bayless's cookbook-a reference book in my opinion.
