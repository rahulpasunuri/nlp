This is a very good versatile dressing but tarragon vinegar really adds to the flavour. I used 3/4 cup sugar and added a little more oil. Something else to keep in mind--this is a large quantity--halve the recipe unless you plan on using it quickly.

I used about 1/3 cup of sugar, and substituted tarragon vinegar with apple cider vinegar, as I didn't have the former on hand. Delicious dressing, will definitely keep in my recipe box. I served it on top of mixed greens with fresh cilantro and dried tarragon, sauteed chicken, fresh tomatoes, and sliced almonds. What a great recipe--thanks for sharing.

Use 1/2 the sugar and the balance of flavor is better. Champagne vinegar works well as a substitute for tarrogon vinegar.

Unfortunately, I cannot find tarragon vinegar in my little part of Hawaii. But I decided to use some red wine vinegar and add a tsp of dried tarragon. I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I have made this version of the recipe 3 times and it has been a "wow" every time.

HAVE BEEN ON A MISSION TO FIND PAPAYA SEED DRESSING SOLD EAST OF HAWAII WHERE WE FIRST HAD IT!!!! THIS RECIPE IS ABSOLUTELY DELISH!!!! MADE IT TWICE RECENTLY AND EVERYONE LOVED IT...I USED 3/4 C CIDER VINEGAR AND 1/4 C WHITE WINE VINEGAR AS I HATE TARRAGON!!!! SERVED IT OVER ARUGULA, RED ONION, PAPAYA CUBES AND GOAT CHEESE...FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!

Papaya Seed Dressing is great for pasta salad. Yum! Yum!

Surprisingly versatile...I could see myself using this with many things, and it's a good base for variations when you want a tropical dressing. Smells more vinegary than it tastes.

fabulously easy and delicious! I used half rice vinegar and half white vinegar because the tarragon wasn't available. Great on avocado.

Very yummy on any salad. My husband loved it. I also improvised on the vinegar. I did basically the same thing that the Cook in Oakland did.

I didn't have everything on hand to make this recipe, but I did have the papaya seeds... so I improvised. I used 1/2 c rice vinegar, 1/4 c white vinegar, and 1/4 c white balsamic vinegar. I only used 1/2 the mustard called for because I only had hot. And I used Splenda instead of sugar because I'm watching my carbs. All in all, this is a fabulous dressing! Will definitely be keeping this recipe handy. I would have to say that any white vinegar would probably work perfectly well, it doesn't have to be tarragon. I served this over a tossed baby greens salad, with red onions, hard cooked eggs, shaved parmesan and cherry tomatoes. Fabulous!

I've used ths recipe many times for not only fruit but spinach salads as well. It never fails to add a different dimension. I've been known to buy a papaya just to make this dressing! I usually add some of the papaya to the salad as well.

Pretty good, just like poppy seed dressing only with papaya seeds. It would be great on a bibb salad. I made a salad of romaine, papaya, mango, red onion and jalapeno. It was tasty. Great recipe for really picky peope who don't like strong flavors.

The dressing was great on fruit salad, cole slaw, and green salad.
