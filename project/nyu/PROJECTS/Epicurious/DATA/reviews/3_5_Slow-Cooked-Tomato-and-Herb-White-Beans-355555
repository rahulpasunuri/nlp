This was great! I diced up a pork chop instead of bacon. I can't stop eating it

This is very good, I might add a little bit of white wine next time.

Very tasty! The recipe is great as written and was a filling side dish. I liked the combination of herbs and the deep tomato flavor. I will make it again.

I did not like this recipe. The herbs cooked to pieces and I had rosemary needles all over that I had to spend 1/2 hour picking out. The whole dish was quite tasteless. I would not make again.

Made this for an impromptu dinner (it's not an impromptu dish, but I had it already started when we were invited). I thought the beans were a bit bland and we prefered them on the less soupy side, but a wonderful alternative to the too-sweet baked beans that most people are used to. I bet they will be even better the next day. I did add a topping of fresh breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley and lemon zest at the end because I love lemon and tomato together. Even my young daughter ate it!

Delicious. After reading the reviews that said the recipe was too salty, I only added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the whole batch. I used a mixed of black-eyed peas, navy beans, and kidney beans. I used dried rosemary and sage, but fresh thyme (had it lying around). I used 6 slices bacon, tomato paste instead of tomato puree (did the original recipe mean sauce? I just don't know), and I cooked the garlic cloves whole with the onions, then threw the cloves in with the tomatoes into the food processor, and I kept in the carrot. Didn't feel like fishing out it's bits, and why waste a perfectly good veggie?

Great recipe - fantastic flavour, I think having fresh herbs makes the difference. I used canned tomatoes as that was all I had, and will cut the salt down next time if I use canned tomatoes again. Great with flat bread/ naan. Going to post this one to my facebook page for my friends

Wonderful recipe to play with! I used fresh chorizo in place of bacon and tomato paste in place of the puree since I had none. Needed quite a bit more water to keep the beans from getting dry during simmer time. I should wait until this has sat another day to review the recipe, but my guess is it will taste even better. Next time I'll add a parmesan rind to the beans while simmering and use the tomato puree. Yum. The house smells great. Using canned beans is a big mistake. Take the time and start fresh.

This is so good and easy to make, although it takes some time, most of it is while the beans are cooking. Make sure to use plenty of good tomatoes and fresh thyme. The flavors are delicious and it reheats well the next day. Also the aroma that fills the house is wonderful. I've made this three times now and it is a favorite.

This takes some patience but was delicious. I omitted the bacon and added a bit more salt, and served this as a main course with sourdough bread for dipping for a light supper. Will definitely make again throughout the colder months.

Hard to believe that such humble ingredients can yield such a full-flavoured dish, but they do! I used dried herbs instead of fresh, and 1 tablespoon of tomato paste in place of the puree (I couldn't find it at the store). I was worried that using fresh tomatoes (as called for in the recipe) would make this taste too "fresh", but that was not the case. Also - don't use canned beans! By the time the tomato sauce is ready, the beans are already "al dente", so it's not like you're sitting around waiting for them to cook. The recipe is really well planned out in that regard.

Perfect winter meal, but I found it a touch too salty. I made this with tinned beans rather than dried, and may add another can of beans to the leftovers....

These beans take a while to make but the flavor is out of this world. You taste all the herbs and garlic - it is fantastic!
