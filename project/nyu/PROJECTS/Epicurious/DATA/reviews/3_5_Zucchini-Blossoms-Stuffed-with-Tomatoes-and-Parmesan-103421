This recipe is the best! We make it every year when our zucchini are flowering and everyone who has ever tried it raves about it.

The most inexperienced cook in our family made these and they were wonderful! He said he would double the fresh thyme next time, though, and we used a generous squeeze of lemon at the table. We voted them "company worthy" and wondered if a good variation would be to add some crab to the mix. yum.

I made this with just stuffing the blossoms unattached and then cut bigger zucchinis into strips. It was great but I would add more cheese and a little more seasonings in the bread stuff.

This was fabulous and so easy! The blooms I had were approx three inches long -- very easy to fill with the mixture. I used Dare's Cabaret Crackers (in the blue box) instead of bread crumbs and since I was only making four I used just the egg white. Didn't measure ingredients and had a shallot so used that. Squirted Pam (or some equivalent) in my glass baking dish rather than coating with oil and that worked. Even with my substitutions I didn't screw this up, but sounds like some people managed. Don't let them deter you. Try it!

I would use bigger zucchinis next time. The blossoms broke off when I served them. Also, not sure about the directions; Do you put the bread crumb mixture in the bottom of the pan?? I put a little on the bottom and it came out crusty--very good. Love this one too.

It was very good and unique. I had never eaten nor used zucchini blossoms. If I wanted to impress I would make this again. It doesn't save well.

Not a good recipe! The bread crumbs baked with egg were plump and moist almost like a heavy grain. The other flavors/textures were overstated too. How do these ingredients combine well as a stuffing for something as delicate as baby zucchini blossoms? I should have known.

I made this for close friends and they were not too impressed. I have to agree. It just seemed like more work than it was worth. BUT, big but, I will give it another try.

the bread crumb mixture was soggy, maybe i made it incorrectly. you need to let the readers know to inspect the inside of the blossom. if it is brown, do not use it and to check for little bugs. this recipe sounded great but i was not saitsfied with it however i do like your program.

I have made this recipe over and over and have shared it with many of my friends that have tasted this dish. If has been my signature 1st course many times. Delicious.

I found mainly male blossoms in my garden, which didn't have the little baby zucchini attached, and they still worked out deliciously. I threw in a few squash blossoms too, and couldn't tell the difference. Next time I think I'll add a bit more spice.

This was the first time I had worked with zucchini blossoms. They were surprisingly easy to work with since the blossom is very elastic & forgiving. This is a delicious recipe, a simple, yet delectable example of Tuscan fare. The lemon gives it a nice kick. My farmer's market is full of zucchini blossoms in the summer (a dozen for $1.50!) so I will definitely be making these again!
