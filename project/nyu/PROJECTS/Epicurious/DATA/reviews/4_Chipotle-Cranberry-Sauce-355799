I have to admit...my favorite cranberry sauce comes from the can--the smooth kind. But, I decided to grow up a bit and try a real cranberry sauce and this is a great recipe! I will re-think my can choice from now on :-)

Loved this! For me and my Mexican friends, it could have been hotter! Will definitely make again.

The hit of Thanksgiving! Used canned chipotles and some of the sauce plus some orange and orange zest along w the lemon. No cumin as I don't really like it. It's also great w pork.

Everyone loved this! I used one canned chipotle pepper that I chopped up. I also used only 1/3 cup of sugar. It went really well with our smoked turkey and the next day with a stuffed, smothered pork chop.

A really fun alternative to plain cranberries. I will make it for the third year and it is always popular. I used Chipotle chilis in Adobo sauce because this is all I can find.

I have been making this recipe since it came out in the mag. last fall. We have made a few modifications which are always well received. First, to save time, I used canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I remove seeds and usually use about 3-4 then I add more adobo sauce to intesify that distinctive smoky flavor. I add them in the same place in recipe as dried. Also, we prefer a smooth cranberry sauce so I puree the whole thing once it is cool. You can also add about 1/2 t. cardamom, a few cinnamon sticks (remove before pureeing), and I've been known to add 1/2 blueberries as well while it cooks.

This was the single best dish at Thanksgiving last year, and I'm repeating it this year. I had some guests last year(like kids and the old folks) who would have had a problem with a very spicy version, so I didn't add in the minced chipotle--it was smoky and delicious but VERY spicy. The sauce still had a nice kick having just simmered the peppers in the sauce. Also, heed the advice in the recipe about the various kinds of peppers. I tried 2 different dried chipotles. One kind, from an ethnic market, was rock hard and never got soft. The other, from Whole Foods, was expensive but very supple and the flesh softened beautifully. Can't recommend this dish enough!

I used dried chilies as directed. If your guest are sensitive to a "hot" flavor, use caution with the minced pepper addition. If you would like the smokey flavor of the pepper without the spiciness, just cook the peppers in the sauce, remove and do not add them later after mincing. The chili flavor and the addition of the garlic gives this sauce a unique flavor which is much more sophisticated than the usual sweet stuff.

I thought the chipotles were an interesting idea with the cranberries, but the end product seemed forced. I also served it as a side dish to the Adobo Turkey, but I don't think it paired any better than regular cranberries would have.

This is really, really good for something so easy. The chipotles certainly add a novel twist to a cranberry concoction. Everybody loved it and it complemented the meal beautifully. I used canned chipotles in adobo, which I rinsed and seeded like a few other reviewers. Also added them along with the garlic (2 large cloves) towards the end of the cooking time. It was a great accent to roast pork, cornbread stuffing, and a Southwestern-style roast chicken.

Was not great. Couldn't hardly tell the difference compared to the regular cranberry sauce. If I do it again I would double the chipotles or something... --Cynthia www.HealthyKitchenware.com

This is incredible. Everyone loved this one at Thanksgiving and I found myself making it again at Christmas! Tried the leftover sauce with fried chicken a few days after the holidays - really spectacular combination!

Easy, fast and delicious! I served it at a party with pork tenderloin and it was a big hit. Following an earlier reviewer's advice, I used can chipotle chiles in adobo sauce and rinsed them before using. While I don't know the difference the dried chiles would have made, it shortened the prep time considerably.

I put this sauce on the Thanksgiving buffet table with the three other cranberry sauces I usually serve and forgot to tell my guests it was spicy. After the initial unexpected taste, everyone raved and it disappeared quickly. I'm making a second batch just to have on hand. Can't wait to try it with pork!

Unreal! So wonderful... I was worried because I, too, had to use the canned chipotles in adobo, but thanks to the intrepid reviewers before me, I was able to muddle through! And I will have this at every Thanksgiving from now on.

Easy, unusual, great flavor, fast. What else do you want?? I just made this for a smoked turkey - everyone wanted the recipe.

Works great with smoked turkey. I also thinned it with some red wine and a bit of the "broth" left over from rehydrating the chipotles and used as a sauce with duck breast.

Absolutely fantastic! Was a little worried about chipotles with cranberries, but I love chipotles so I have it whirl. The flavors complement each other so well and will perfect with the rest of my Thanksgiving meal.

really good--there is so much sweet stuff at Thanksgiving, the spice is a nice surprise!

This is my new favorite cranberry sauce. Like the first reviewer, I used chipotles in adobo that I already had and just rinsed them. I don't like really sweet cranberry sauce, so I used *only* 1 cup of sugar (still quite a bit). Very tart and savory and easy to make. This is going to delicious with the turkey.

This is the best cranberry sauce I've ever made! I used canned chipotles in adobo sauce, but rinsed and seeded them prior to adding along with the garlic. I'm afraid my husband is going to eat it all before I can get it to the table!

This turned out good in a unique way. Not sure if it would be all that great for Thanksgiving, but would use it with pork like A Cook from LA did.

I cut this reciepe in half, as I did not want to make too much round one. I was making grilled pork chops, and this sauce went REALLY well with the pork.. HOWEVER, this is not the kind of cranberry sauce that you can just eat and enjoy alone.. it is spicy!! Ofcourse, I was serving it warm with the pork.. Cold might offer another flavor as the chili will be calmed down. This is a receipe to keep, but not to always use.
