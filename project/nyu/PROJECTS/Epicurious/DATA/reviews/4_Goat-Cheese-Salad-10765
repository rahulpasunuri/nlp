A very fast & easy recipe. I have made this many times now. Rather than dipping the goat cheese rounds in egg, I use lowfat buttermilk. It adds a little tang and lightness. I've gotten rave reviews whether I vary the coating from Panko & grated Parmesan or Asiago to Trader Joe's almond meal. Both offer wonderful flavor. A fine drizzle of extra virgin olive oil or walnut oil on the pan makes a delectable warm goat cheese.

I have made this twice now and it garnered rave reviews from our guests. I subbed walnut oil for olive oil and walnuts for bread crumbs. I can't imagine the taste with bread crumbs.

This was very good and very simple. I chopped up toasted walnuts and added panko (didn't have any regular bread crumbs) and used very good olive oil for the dressing.

ok but not...harmonious. i thought the dressing was too aggressive; didn't find that crumbing the goat cheese contributed to the effect. i still prefer mesclun with a sherry vinegar/walnut + olive oil dressing picked up with herbs, topped with a grilled "young" crottin.

We made this dish MANY times after our initial try. It is simply amazing!

Fabulous salad. Took some of the suggestions that other reviewers had made - mixed ground walnuts and breadcrumbs together and used hazelnut oil + olive oil. Found that I wanted more than 1 slice of goat cheese per plate - I'd suggest two, although it is very rich then. Have tried this with a variety of lettuces and it's been great each time. I use egg substitute instead of real egg and cook the cheese slices in my toaster over. A delicious treat.

This recipe ends my holy grail search for the perfect salad.

This is such an easy thing to make and I always get raves that it is the best salad! I use whatever lettuce looks best and generally make my vinegrette with mustard, white wine vinegar and oil. Using good flavored dijons can allow you to skip the garlic and shallots. Fantastic!

This is a classic! Now try subbing ground toasted hazelnuts or walnuts for half or all of the bread crumbs and hazelnut or walnut oil for part of the oil in the dressing. Yum... Brings me right back to a wonderful lunch in a what we thought was a mere truckstop in a tiny mountain town in Provence. I asked Madame what was different about her warm goat cheese salad and this was her secret.

My guests loved this one! My only change was to make the goat cheese ahead of time. Just saute in a little olive oil for 30 seconds on each side. Cool, then just micro for 1 minute before serving.

I admit I only made the goat cheese part of this recipe, as I already had greens and was using the delicious dressing from the Artichoke, Romaine and Cherry Tomato Salad on this site, and while the preparation of the goat cheese is a little messy, it is well worth it. Quick and tasty! Definite keeper! KIMBER

I made this salad for a dinner party last night and everyone thought it was terrific. One said it was "the best salad I've ever had." I used one head of Boston lettuce, one of red Boston lettuce, and some mixed organic greens. I used a nice virgin olive oil. Also, I added about 1/2 cup of walnuts that I sauteed in butter.

Enjoyed the salad, I only used the boston lettuce and had to use olive oil but it was still excellent.

Excellent salad! The walnut oil really gives an extra punch and the ease with which the goat cheese is prepared with such great results is fabulous. We substituted red onion (2 TBS) for shallots and have served it over any salad blend (mesclun, arugula, etc) w/great results.

Excellent!!! Everything about this salad was delicious and all flavors complimented one another beautifully. One note: The goat cheese can be tricky to cut for it has a tendency to fall apart quite easily. The situation is soon rectified after it has been dipped in the egg and bread crumbs.

Absolutely delicious! I skipped the garlic because my husband doesn't like it, and it still turned out great. I'll definitely make it again!
