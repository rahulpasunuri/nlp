I love this recipe! It's pretty easy to make and I always get rave reviews when I make it for others. I find the cake is so moist that it tends to stick a little to my hands when I'm cutting it to put in the filling, but I don't mind. It's a little messy, but well-worth it.

Made this for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit! My mom claims she doesn't like desserts but she had 3 helpings! Nice guilt-free alternative to a diet-busting chocolate cake that tastes virtually the same. I was a bit apprehensive with the baby food but it wasn't noticeable. The almond and vanilla extracts are a must. Tastes great with non-fat Coolwhip!

This cake is delicious, just be careful not to overbake. I halved the recipe for Chocolate Glaze (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chocolate-Glaze-5250) instead of non-fat fudge sauce and mixed some seedless raspberry preserves into it. Like a rich raspberry chocolate truffle!

In response to Delaware, I agree - but my reinvented version might do it for you: lose the carrots & almond extract & jam; add 1/3 cup butter (nobody gets hurt - it's a whole cake.) Finish off each slice with a modest dollop of whipped cream & drained canned cherries. Still not a fattening cake & muuuch tastier. May take a few extra minutes in the oven.

This cake got rave reviews from my family, I put the raspberry jam on 1/2 of it and with or without it is unbelievable. I didn't need the fudge sauce and this is also amazing the next day.

This is a delicious cake. I make it regularly and usually double the chocolate chip quantity. I don't bother with the jam. Usually serve it with frozen vanilla yogurt and hot fudge sauce. Yum!

i hate to be a downer, but i didn't love this cake. then again...i'm used to making the traditionally buttery, creamy desserts. the raspberry filling is really necessary in this one. just okay...i'd rather have a small piece of real chocolate cake.

Using seedless raspberry preserves worked wonderfully, and garnishing the cake with a rim of whole raspberries (as in the picture) made everybody ooh and aah. This was so moist and delicious that nobody believed me when I told them it was both low in fat AND low in calories. A definite winner!

So delicious, but I'm not a fan of crunching on the raspberry seeds! I would make this again without the filling or use something else.

Rich tasting, a small serving suffices. I just need to figure a way to get it off the plate--it is a bit sticky on the bottom. Also, the recipe as printed has the fudge sauce listed twice; as far as I can tell, it is just used for the frosting.
