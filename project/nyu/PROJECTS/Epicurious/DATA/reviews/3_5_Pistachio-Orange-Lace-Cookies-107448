Today is my 13th wedding anniversary - the 'lace' anniversary. Instead of buying my wife something made of lace, I decided to make lace cookies. I'm a guy, so I need easy. I nailed it with these bad boys today. I made the cookies last night in about 15 minutes and then baked up some love this morning. What a hit!

I made these as a treat for co-workers. They were a huge hit, everyone was crazy for these cookies. I took a review suggestion and did not flatten the cookies before baking, they were perfect. I absolutely love pistachios and used shelled pistachios by the pound from Whole Foods. Next times I will buy un-shelled pistachios in hopes of getting a more intense fresh flavor. These cookies are very pretty, and would go really well with premium vanilla ice cream.

Sophisticated taste, beautiful green presentation, made them with petite lemon curd cookies and triple ginger cookies -- to die for! Everyone appreciated something besides chocolate chip and sugar cookies (they have their place, though!) and gobbled them up (8 people over 2 days). Try them for something different!

I am not sure what I was expecting but they were just rather average. I will probably look for another kind of recipe to combine the flavors of pistachios and orange.

Very easy, with a wonderful, sophisticated taste. The instructions are unnecessarily complicated. I forgot to squish down the cookies with a fork on one batch, and they came out just fine. After that, I simply skipped that step. Be sure not to undercook. These need to go the full time.

I have made these 2 Christmases in a row and they are personal favorites. Delicate and crunchy.

These disappeared at a recent party and everyone asked for the recipe. They're so easy to make and look very fancy. I added a few drops of orange flower water and they were a perfect combination of pistachio and orange.

Wonderful little cookies! Love the nut and orange combo. I served them with homemade gelati. These are a great accessory to any ice cream desset. No problems using parchment paper. I still have some in the freezer ready for action.

The first batch I used wax paper instead of parchment paper. HUGE MISTAKE!!! The cookies stuck to the paper and I had to throw them out. But when using parchment paper, they came out wonderfully. Next time I will look for already shelled pistachios, since shelling them took a long time. Other than that, these are not too difficult and very yummy. They also look very fancy for dinner parties.

I made these to accompany home-made pistachio ice cream. They were just terrific; crisp and flavorful but not too heavy. I accidentally sloshed in a little extra grand marnier so didn't bother with the orange juice. I had no trouble with the cooking time, baking them for 12 minutes and then cooling for 5 minutes.

Outstanding cookie with the most mouth-watering pistachio taste right through them. I thought I'd rarely eaten such a subtle, spiritually marvelous taste in a cookie. Truly a gourmet treat. And very easy. These were the kind of miraculous thing that could literally shake you out of a depression. A triumph.

Cookies tasted good, but cooking time was way off. Cooked about 10-11min they were soft and sat out about 15 min and were still soft. Had to put them back in for about 10min. They do spread, so don't flatten so much.

The cookies are good, but you have to like grand marnier. I thought they spread a lot and would make them smaller next time. I froze the dough in logs and sliced a week later.

These were wonderful and a big hit with the gift giving tins this year! One word of advice -- I simply divided the dough in half and then spooned it onto the plastic wrap and formed a "meatloaf" of sorts (almost the same sort of wet consistency) with the help of a good silicone spatula and chilled both "logs" for 4+ hours. The next morning, they were ready to be sliced and baked -- the very same day they were to be distributed as gifts. Surprisingly easy! I wonder how these would be with a little valrhona chocolate as a dip....

These are very easy to make. I wasn't big on the taste, but they were a big hit at the office.

These cookies were easy to make and deliciously different! They're delicate but did I did not have problems with them falling apart. Do not overcook. I brought them to a luncheon and they were a big hit!

These cookies were different and delicious. They are fragile, though, so not too practical for gift giving. That's okay... I'll just eat them all myself.

These were really easy to make but I was not crazy about the taste. The orange flavour really comes out but that is about it. I also ended up cooking them longer to crip them up because they were so chewy. I drizzled chocolate on top to add more flavour.
