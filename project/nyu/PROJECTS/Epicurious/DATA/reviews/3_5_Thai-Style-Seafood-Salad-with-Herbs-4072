I had some extra grilled grouper and wanted a summery recipe, and this really fit the bill. I did not have any tarragon, but lots of fresh basel from my window box. I found that the fish sauce added too much salt; I would make it next time with one tablespoon instead of two. Since my fish was already cooked I did not do the cooking step, and it was a such a refreshing, summery salad. Highly recommended.

This is extremely delicious just as it is. However, my supermarket didn't have any fresh tarragon so I used basil. Two thai peppers were just right.

Just FYI Jamiesf, calamari and squid are the same thing. I do agree, the Thai peppers add much more zing.

This recipe has great potential. I made it just as said and served it with fresh brewed Lychee tea. However, I would make this recipe again in a more authentic Thai style. Omit the tarragon and the red chili flakes and add instead thai chili peppers ( prik kii nuu) during the chilling process so as they don't lose their nice hot flavor. Also add more fish sauce ( naam bplaa). Don't make the same mistake I made. I used squid and it would be better with calamari and medium sized prawns. It will be perfect next time!

Should include half cup minced shallots in ingredients.

Wonderful. Nothing lost by omitting the shallots. A nice appetizer, too.

This dish is flavourful and easy to prepare. There is a small mistake in the ingredients list. Shallots are not listed but are included in the instructions. I simply added raw, chopped shallots. It was delicious and low calorie.
