I only make half the sauce. Otherwise great! The salsa is a must!

I must be one of the few people who made the sauce and liked it! My mother, who is incredibly picky, even loved it and couldn't believe it was so delicious. I didn't find it time consuming but I did make a couple of modifications. I used orange spiced black tea, and I didn't bother with the chicken stock. So basically: Bring 2 cups water to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Add tea bags. Remove from heat; cover and let steep 10 minutes. Discard tea bags. Add 1 cup orange juice and 3 tablespoons orange marmalade to tea. Boil mixture until reduced by half, about 12 minutes. Whisk in 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard and return to boil. Whisk in cornstarch mixture. Boil until sauce thickens slightly, about 4 minutes.

We absolutely LOVE this ham!! I made it for Christmas '08 and easter '09. {DON'T MAKE THE TEA SAUCE THOUGH SKIP IT AS OTHER REVIEWERS SAY!!} Just make the ham with the orange marmalade/musturd sauce and cloves and it is devine!! TIP: I pulled all the cloves out before I glaze it at the end. If you don't the cloves get stuck in the glaze and they are hard to remove and bitter if you eat a clove so take them out {a mistake I made the first time I made the ham". My husband loved this and asked for seconds every time and he is not a big ham fan. This ham is sweet and salty but thats what makes it a special treat for the holidays, its a little over the top in a good way! I put it in my permanant holiday recipie notebook and this will be a new tradition for us I will continue! I served it with boiled red potatoes with butter S&P, and asparagus, butter S&P. A simple and very easy delicous meal!

Tasted great, looked great too. I read the other reviews and also omitted the sauce. The ham was delicious with just the glaze! For anyone that is wondering, you can cook your ham 10-15 minutes per pound. Ours was about 8 pounds and was great at an hour and a half. Looking forward to the leftovers!

Made this to take to family Easter dinner. Despite negative comments about sauce from some reviewers, I made it -big mistake - it was not worth the trouble. The ham, however, is delicious with the glaze which permeated the meat with flavor. For me it took quite a bit longer to thicken than the recipe directions indicate. I'd suggest doubling it, heating until slightly thickened. Remove half to serve as a sauce and continue cooking the rest for the glaze.

The ham was glorious! I made it for Christmas and it was my first ham AND my first Chrismas with the inlaws coming to my house. I impressed their socks off!! The sauce was good but unneccessary, everyone loved the flavor of the ham and the glaze. Next time I'll leave out the sauce. I think it would be going overboard.

I made the glaze for Easter this year. I needed a glaze and I had all the ingredients for this one in the house. I did not make the sauce but the glaze was wonderful and I got many raves. Definitly a keeper.

Most excellent results. I prepared this one straight off the printer to feed 20 at Easter to rave reviews. The sauce was absolutely incredible, although I subsituted a dry white wine instead of water for the roasting pan deglazing. Shared the receipe with a neighbour who was also preparing a ham, the response...most excellent. This one's a keeper!!!

Great ham recipe. Made it for Easter with rave reviews. I went ahead and tried the sauce - it was alright but not necessary. Next time I might double the glaze so that we can pass it for topping the ham with afterwards. Made it with the porcini risotto cakes which were great.

I didn't have enough time to make the orange tea sauce but it still tasted wonderful. It looks exactly like the picture so that's a major plus.

Delicious!! We did not make the sauce (it was wonderful without it). Also, I did not bother with adding water to the pan and scraping -- just used the glaze with the marmalade and mustard -- fantastic and beautiful...

This is my third year making this recipie, and I have to say, it is fabulous. Every year, my family makes sure to request that I prepare this incredible ham! I do haver to cook the sauce a bit longer than stated, but it always thickens, and looks just like the photo!

I would have given this recipe 4 forks if not for the disaster that was the sauce. I read the reviews but decided I wanted the sauce anyway -- that was my first mistake. Totally unnecessary, and following the recipe exactly left me with a watery sauce that would not reduce and barely wanted to thicken. The taste wasn't worth it. On the other hand, the glaze for the ham is WONDERFUL and I'd definitely use that on a future ham.

Great recipe. It comes out looking just like the picture ... that's an added bonus! I made it for Easter without the sauce or the relish. Everyone loved it. I may make it every year.

I have made this recipe twice and both times it was good but not as great as all the rave reviews. I made it for Easter 2002 not remembering I made it 3 years ago for Easter until I was adding comments (I printed the recipe off Epicurious)to my BA 4/1998 issue I wasn't over-enthused then either. I found the sauce to be tasty but thin even after adding more cornstarch, I won't be making it again. The first time the Pineapple-Mint Relish didn't go over at all, I didn't make this time.

I made this using a ham made from a wild pig (my husband is a hunter). The glaze was perfect. I had to boil it longer than 6 minutes, more like 8-9 min. I also ran out of marmalade and had to use apricot preserves for the sauce -- still tasted great! Unlike other reviewers, my family loved the sauce. The sauce is also great the next day with leftovers.

Made this for Easter dinner - wonderful. I made the sauce, but didn't use it. I would make the ham again, but skip the sauce. Saved the ham bone and with the leftover pieces and made Split Pea Soup the following weekend.

Had the ham for Easter dinner. Everyone thought it was great. I really did not need the sauce and my guests also felt that it was not necessary; the ham was delicious without it. I would definitely make it again.

Since I had a ham that didn't need much cooking, I just made the sauce. Didn't have orange marmelade on hand, so I used raspberry jam, though still using the orange juice. Terrific!

Made for Easter lunch and everyone raved. I'll never buy a Honey Baked again. I usually do not like sauce on ham, but this one was great. I cooked the ham on Saturday and on Sunday I glazed and made sauce. Served with a corn casserole, fruit salad, and a cold mixed spring vegetable salad with a mustard vinegrate. Perfect for a lunch since it was unusally hot for Easter this year. I also made the mentioned cake, but just served with whipped cream and strawberries on the side. It was also very good.

Very good ham. I made this for Easter for 8 adults and had tons of leftovers. Everyone loved it and had seconds (STILL have tons of leftovers). Use coarse grain mustard. It adds something to the look of the dish.

I made this yesterday for my Easter dinner and it was a big hit. The two best things about it were that it was extremely simple to make (without the accompanying sauce, which I felt was not worth the effort) and was by far much cheaper than buying a Honey-Baked Ham (about $15.00 for an 8 1/2 lb. ham versus probably $40.00 for a Honey-Baked). I would definitely make this again and hope to before next Easter!

This will be the 3rd Easter in a row I've made this ham. In fact I make the whole menu from the magazine artical. Everyone loves it.

I have never made a ham before. Always pre-ordered one at specialty stores. Never again! This recipe was incredible! Definatly a keeper! I made the sauce, and didn't end up using it though. Quite honestly, the ham didn't need it!

I might have liked a thicker sauce, but it was certainly tasty. I used a non-bone deli type ham, for a smaller number of people, but it converted fine.

Really good--everyone loved the ham, but the sauce was the real hit. I didn't cook the ham as long during the first cooking, and I lined the pan with foil right from the start and didn't bother using the drippings (which were mostly fat, anyway). The glaze was very good--I added a little garlic to it and omitted the water. The sauce--excellent, though I did change it somewhat (mostly to accomodate the vegetarians who ate the sauce with potatoes, etc.): 2 c mango-herb tea, 2 c veggie broth, 1.5 c orange-strawberry juice, 2 cloves garlic, double the mustard, triple the marmalade, reduce as specified, then add the juice of 1 lemon (this really makes the sauce and helps balance the strong mustard and tea flavors) and the cornstarch mixture. Perfect, and the sauce and glaze can be made a day ahead.

I made this for Easter this year and it was a big hit. Everyone loved it and the taste was very nice. I used a strong mustard that I got in Dusseldorf, Germany and it gave the ham a bit of a kick; however, the orange marmalade sweetened it. Lovely!

Very good glaze. The sauce was too salty, but that may have been because the ham was a very salty one, so the pan drippings were very salty. Other wise excellent.

I tried this recipe because my wife hates ham (too salty), but our kids and I wanted a ham for Christmas. The recipe was easy prepare, the ingredients easy to find, and the results were excellent. My wife even went back for seconds.

the sauce was great, very subtle flavours. but don't forget to line your pan with foil before the marmalade goes on!!!!what a mess.

This recipe is a wonderful combination of sweet and salty. The marmalade glaze gives a wonderful sweet taste that goes far beyond what a honey-glazed ham would ever give you. It is definitely a recipe that will be in my recipe box for a long time.
