This was incredibly easy and delicious. I added some salt to the water as well as the vinegar and they came out perfectly done.

I didn't have any vinegar so put none. My egg yolks stuck to the bottom of the pan so when I slotted them out, the yolk started dripping on the kitchen towel, which meant, i couldn't really drain them but other than that, they were fine.

Yes, this works just fine. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX But, if you don't have the time, you can do something very similiar with a lot less trouble. Get a small microwavable dish. Big enough to hold one egg. Put a little butter on the sides of the dish. Place 2 tablespoon of water in the bottom of the dish. Put one raw egg in the dish. In my microwave it tack about one minute to poach. The poached egg slide out in a perfect shape. Since each microwave is different you may need to try different cooking times to get the type of poached egg you like.

This is the quintessential cooking 101 recipe. For me (whites firm, yolks runny) 2 1/2 minutes is perfect.

Easy and perfect for someone who is learning how to perfectly poach eggs. Poached eggs being as delicate as they come can seem intimidating until it's discovered how easy it really is thanks to recipes like this!
