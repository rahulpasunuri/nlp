Sooo good!!! If you want to avoid the messy roll out and cut, then consider, quickly rolling into balls and gently pressing down, I did and they were delicious! (Quickly so the butter doesn't melt, the biscuit will be tough if not done quickly.) They aren't quite as perfectly shaped but still 'look' like biscuits.

easy. tasty. however, these were more of a cross between a biscuit and a scone. both in terms of the sweetness and the texture.

A nice, softly sweet flavor and very moist. I'm not usually good at biscuits and pastry items, but these were easy for me. I too, used the processor to mix and I don't think it hurt them at all.

These are quick, easy and delicious. I bake them in a cast iron pan on the Big Green Egg, the sweetness goes beautifully with the hint of smoke from the charcoal. Excellent for breakfast!

These biscuits are wonderful and quick to make, if slightly sweet. I like to make them with bacon grease instead of butter (add a bit more flour if you do this), and the sweet-and-salty flavor is to die for! :)

Rating: 4
I love these. They are sweet, but with just a hint of sweetness, nothing crazy. Makes them so wonderful for breakfast with jam or honey. I used the food processor, stopped just before dough was together and dumped out to knead just a few times to bring everything together - dough is sticky. I patted the dough into a rough rectangle and cut biscuits as directed, sort of patting out the edges to be less squareish - and am super happy with results. A bit of a crisp golden outside, tender wonderfulness inside. Also love that recipe makes just 6, perfect for my purposes without lots of left overs. Enjoy!

I almost never review recipes on here (oops) but I am making an exception to waddle to my computer and write this one here. These biscuits are AMAZING. A couple of notes - firstly, when measuring 'well shaken' buttermilk keep in mind that 3/4 cup is going to be about 1/3 full of bubbles...just add bmilk until th dough is sticky (past the point you'd usually want a dough to be). Second - I had this tonight with some blackberries simmered in red wine and buttermilk ice cream (recipe also courtesy epicurious) and even though it hurts to move, every bite was worth it.

I just made this recipe for the first time and it's delicious! I cheated and used a food processor for the mixing, just a few pulses to combine the dry ingredients and butter into a meal, then several pulses until the buttermilk was integrated and the mixture took on a doughiness. Then I kneaded briefly by hand.

Rating: 3
Really great recipe! I made them exactly as listed and baked at 425 for about 10. Makes a small amount, but they're so easy to make, I don't mind doubling or tripling the recipe!

Added dried chives, and dropped the dough onto the sheets with a spoon. Found them to be dry, hard to swallow. I'll keep looking...

Good recipe, might even give it 3.5 (good and super easy). Made biscuits as written but made drop biscuits instead (happened to make 7 with my scoop, and they were still quite large). Did not like the prominent flavor of the sugar in the biscuits and will leave that 1.5 T. out next time. Biscuit texture was lovely, not at all dry or scone-like. Made this with leftover meat from roast chicken and stock from the carcass. It was very flavorful.

I followed the recipe to a T and these turned out very bland. They were not flaky at all, but rather tasted like dry, stale scones. I would not make them again.

I've been making preserves at home for a few years now, and this recipe has become a wonderful staple for testing jams and marmalades on. While I'm by no means a skilled baker, I've never run into problems with this recipe. It's quick, consistent, and delicious, and the biscuits rise really well so long as the dough doesn't get handled excessively. These have a wonderfully light texture and great balance of sweetness and salt. If I'm rushed for time or feeling particularly lazy I'll skip the rolling out process and make drop biscuits, but the method in the recipe delivers the most reliable results. The recipe also scales up very well and keeps well in the freezer. I'd also add that plugra or another similar high butterfat butter is particularly good in these.

Gluten-Free version: I just made these with King Arthur's Gluten-free multi-purpose flour, following the recipe with no other changes. For anyone wondering, they came out very nice -- everyone loves them, and since I've got more buttermilk, I'll make another batch tomorrow. I followed one reviewer's advice to stir with fork in one direction till everything came together; then, I just scooped up a likely amount of better, shaped it roughly into rounds in my hands, and plopped them right on the pan. On taste: one and a half Tbsps of sugar made buscuits that were a bit on the sweet side -- I think I was expecting just a plain, savoury buscuit. Are they supposed to taste a little bit sweet? Tomorrow, I'll halve the sugar, and see how that is.

Rating: 4
excellent recipe - i use a spoon to drop the biscuits on the cookie sheet rather than rolling them out. perfect every time!

Rating: 4
Just adding a 2nd review to say that I made 4x the recipe for an Easter brunch, and it worked great. In order to prevent overworking the dough, I made 2 double batches of the dry ingredients, pulsing the butter in the Cuisinart. Then I dumped both batches into a huge mixing bowl, poured in the 3C of buttermilk, and barely folded it into a dough. I turned it out onto a floured surface, kneaded it until it just formed a cohesive disc, & used a rolling pin to flatten it out. I cut about 70 2" biscuits, including the rerolled dough. They all disappeared. Awesome.

Rating: 4
Extremely easy (no rolling pin or cutter required!) and very, very tasty.

Rating: 4
These were great! Made just as directed and they came out perfect. My boyfriend loved that they had crispy tops and bottoms and they were perfect with beef stew. Highly recommended!

Rating: 4
I used these to top a chicken pot pie. Yes, it is very wet, but just drop the dough onto a good amount of flour, dust again, and use quick folding strokes to make a flat disc. If topping something soggy like I did, make sure to bake them until nice & brown on top to ensure the bottoms cook through as well. You could also use the drop method others have described.

Rating: 4
These are definitely worth adding to your arsenal. They are great for breakfast or with dinner. To make this even easier, pull biscuit size pieces of dough off and form in your hands, no rolling, no cutting and you still have a great tasting biscuit with a lot less work! My boyfriend said these remind him of the biscuits his grandmother used to make!

Rating: 4
This is a very good recipe for classic buttermilk biscuits and is easy because it does not require biscuit cutters. I added a spash more buttermilk and scooped out the batter with an icecream scoop to make drop biscuits and it worked very well. The secret is to mix the batter in one direction with the fork and stop as soon as the mix is blended. Don't beat or over-mix. A light hand makes light biscuits!

Though these had good flavor, I didn't get the lift that I was expecting. Also, the bottom of the biscuits looked a little on the grainy side. I guess I need to work on it a little bit.

Though the flavor was good, I didn't get any lift on theses. I have a feeling that I may have patted them down too far. Also, the bottom of the biscuits were a little mealy in texture. I was a little disappointed

Rating: 4
My family has been requesting this recipe every Sunday morning for the last two years. These biscuits are outstanding with a slice of country ham and a cup of coffee. If they're not coming out flaky, then you're either not cutting in the butter correctly, or you're kneading the dough too much. Just a few times to bring it together is all it takes. These biscuits flake beautifully. If you're used to supermarket biscuits then these may seem a little denser and moister to you, but that's a good thing in my book.

Rating: 4
These were fabulous. For my first attempt at making biscuits from scratch, I was so pleased with how they turned out. The recipe was easy to follow and the biscuits were moist and fluffy. We topped them off with butter and honey and ate them along side our homemade chicken soup. Delicious.

These were not my favorite. The dough was way too sticky to even think about kneading. I just rolled them into balls and gently pressed into a biscuit shape. They turned out ok, but were too sweet and dense, not flaky at all. As a southern girl, these did not live up to my expectations.

Rating: 4
Biscuit perfection! I cut the sugar in 1/2 because I don't like sweet biscuits...and...I accidentally mixed up the baking powder and soda (I was talking on the phone while making them), so I had to get creative with a solution,but it didn't matter. My son and I had one warm out of the oven, slathered with butter and homemade strawberry jam; he now thinks I'm a culinary genious.

Rating: 3
On a whim, I used this recipe to make my "pigs in a blanket." Since the dough is wet, I had trouble getting it to stick well to my turkey dogs. It came out alright, but a little tough (especially compared to Pillsbury). In the future, I'll reserve this recipe for biscuits and try something else for my pigs. :)

Rating: 3
Very light and fluffy, but TOO SWEET for my taste. I will reduce sugar next time. The dough was very wet - too wet to really knead. But I resisted the tempation to add more flour. I think the wet dough is one reason these biscuits rise so well. I patted the dough into a thick round and cut it into six wedges. I made one change to the recipe. I substituted one Tablespoon of cornstarch for one Tablesppon flour to reduce the gluten content of my all purpose flour. One key to getting biscuits and scones to rise well is making sure your oven is properly pre-heated. Biscuits rise to their maximum hight during the first five minutes of baking, and rise best in a HOT oven. Since the oven drops in temperature when you open the door to put in the biscuits I have found that biscuits/scones rise best when I preheat the oven to 500, and then turn the temperature down to the baking temperature after I put the biscuits in the oven.

I made these this morning as written, except no milk/cream on top and no sifting of the dry ingredients. I wisked instead of sifting and did drop-biscuit style after kneading. Last time I made them as written, and I think they actually came out better this time. The flavor and texture were both good, but not exceptional.

These were my first biscuits made from scratch, and were surprisingly easy. Dont worry about kneading the dough; it was quick and easy right on the countertop.

Nothing beats freshly baked biscuits warm out of the oven on a rainy Saturday morning! Better yet, this recipe is so simple for such a delicious result. I blended 1/2 cup of plain yogurt with 1/4 cup of milk to substitute for buttermilk. And I also cut the dough using an upside down drinking glass to make that classic round shape. Warm goodness with just the right texture!

Best biscuit recipe, hands down - and easy. For single folks: I used a biscuit cutter and made 5 large biscuits. I cooked one and froze the remaining on a wax sheeted plate in the freezer for an hour, then in a ziplock bag. This morning I popped one into a cold toaster oven and cooked at 375F for 20 min, and the frozen one tasted as great as the fresh one I made 2 days ago.

These were excellent served with a blend of butter, orange peel and honey. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I substituted kefir for the buttermilk, which isn't available here in Moscow. The dough was rather unwieldy, and so I ended up incorporating a lot of flour during kneading, but they still came out light.

I love this biscuit recipe. It was exactly what I wanted for my cobbler. I took this recipe to the letter, but then when I rolled it out I brushed it was 2 Tbl of butter, and then sprinkled it with 1/2 a cup of chopped and toasted walnuts, 2 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/4 of a cup of lightly packed brown sugar mixture. Rolled it up and sliced it and then layed it on top of a peach and strawberry cobbler filling I had made and baked according to directions. I used this recipe for the biscuit because I wasn't satisfied with the one that came with the cobbler recipe I was using. These biscuits took it over the top. These will be my standard biscuits from here on out.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe exactly - brushing cream before baking. I then used them for strawberry shortcakes - strawberries, sugar, whipped cream... mmm. I think the technique matters a lot for biscuits so I hope I can replicate the recipe next time. I tried to keep the butter as cold as possible, mixed minimally and used very little flour during the kneading step. The biscuits were light, fluffy, flaky but not crumbly. I think the kneading makes them different from scones.

I made these for strawberry shortcake and they were perfect. I didn't have buttermilk, but I had limes, so I mixed a little milk, heavy cream and lime juice together instead of buttermilk and worked out great. Also added a little lime zest. Lemon would work, too. You could easily use this recipe as a base for cheddar dill biscuits, or some other savory biscuit by cutting the sugar.

Lovely, soft fluffy biscuits. I used a round biscuit cutter, didn't bother with the dairy glaze.

I am a lifelong biscuit-making failure. This recipe has changed all that! Dead easy and impossible to screw-up. The only changes I made were to cut the sugar by half (I was making them to be smothered in sausage cream gravy) and use half bacon-fat and half chilled butter. Crumbly crunchy on the outside and pillowy fluffy soft on the inside. To avoid flat, tough or dense biscuits make certain that your baking powder is fresh, forget about using whole wheat flour, don't make your rectandle too big and DON'T manhandle the dough! "Six times" means "six times", people! You won't be disappointed. These are fast and easy enough for a weekday morning!

Using a well-floured knife or cuter is essential, or they won't rise as nicely.

These were great!

They puffed up beautifully and weren't too oily, and were perfect with fresh turkey sausage.

These were yummy. The problem I has was that I doubled the recipe so I wasn't sure how big my rectangle should be. And sure enough, I made it too big and ended up with 16 biscuits instead of 12. They were very flat. Not dense, but flat because I flattened the dough too much. Be wary of this. Taste wise they were great, but I couldn't bring myself to take them to the party because they looked funny. More like coasters than biscuits.

I made these for the second time tonight, and this time they turned out GREAT!!! Perhaps I have eaten too many store-bought buttermilk biscuits, but I thought that they turned out too sweet the first time, even though they were good as part of the shortcake recipe. Again tonight I used buttermilk powder and water for real buttermilk, but this time I increased the powder from 3 Tbs. to 4 (with this brand, 4 Tbs. is what should be used to make 1 cup of reconstituted buttermilk, even though the powder is mixed right into the dry ingredients), and I used less than 3/4 cup of water. Increased the salt slightly and decreased the sugar to 1 Tbs. & 1 tsp. I did not trim the large rectangle because I did not want to waste the dough. Used a pizza cutter to make the 6 biscuits. Once they were on the cookie sheet, I formed them into uniform sized rectangles with rounded corners--who cares?? Since we are a family of 2, I served these with "Chicken Salad with Grapes and Walnuts" (also on this site) and, you guessed it, "Strawberry Shortcake", of course!!! DO try these--they are YUMMY!
