This is wonderful! My favorite spinach--ever.

Quick to make, simple ingredients, delicious and nicely balanced flavors. I've eaten something similar many times in restaurants but didn't know how to make at home. Great to have discovered it here. Will definitely add to my menu rotation.

I've made a few mistakes making this, and have had varying levels of success. Both time, I've used bags of pre-washed, picked spinach. The first time I only had half the spinach lying around, but I kept the recipe the same and it was great. The second time, I purchased the proscribed amount of spinach but, again, used bagged picked spinach. This time the recipe was out of balance. So, the next time I make it, I'll halve the amount of spinach. Besides, *more* onions and raisins is always good.

Pretty good. I skipped the pine nuts and added cashews.
