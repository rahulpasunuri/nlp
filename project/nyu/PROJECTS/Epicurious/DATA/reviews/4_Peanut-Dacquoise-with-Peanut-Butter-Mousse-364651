Making sure the meringue layers were the exact size made the presentation beautiful, as I let the glaze drip and puddle slightly, instead of "icing" it. I loved the way it presented itself on the flat platter, showing off its lucious layers. Drop a few whole peanuts on top and down the sides. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Make the meringues a day ahead. Oh my Lawd, merci me ! (that's what my stomach said)

I am underwhelmed. This was not hard, but it was time-consuming, and, in my opinion, not worth the effort. HOWEVER...I made just the peanut meringues for another group, topped them with vanilla ice cream and fudge sauce...that was an exceptional dessert! I will keep the recipe for the meringues and use them this way going forward.

I just wasn't impressed with this. The flavors were good (can't go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter), but rather unsophisticated. It was basically like a large Reeses Cup. I doubt I'll make it again.

This is so pretty everyone oohed and aah-ed when it appeared, then they groaned with delight when they saw it sliced. And then they moaned with pleasure when they ate it. It's a bit time consuming to put together but make it easier on yourself by doing the meringues and even the mousse a day or so before you do the glaze and assemble everything. I assembled the thing three days ahead and refrigerated it, per the recipe, and it was just a magnificent creation. Of course, we all love peanuts! The meringues have a great flavor from the Spanish peanuts and their skins so don't substitute. I made extra mousse and chocolate glaze to be sure I wouldn't run out but this assemblage is so rich next time I'll actually use as little chocolate as I can get away with. I never thought I'd say that.

My husbands LOVES chocolate and PB so I decided to make this for his birthday. BIG HIT! I'm not even a big PB fan but I couldn't resist this cake. It's a bit time consuming but for the most part a very EASY recipe. I will definitely make it again...or even just the individual parts by themselves, especially the PB mousse! Sooooo yummy!

Every year I fast from Chocolate for Lent, so, on Holy Saturday the chocolate must be good quality! Made this yesterday, oh yeah, it's all that! Outcome was beautiful, even though this was my first try at meringue. For special occasions, I plan to make several smaller versions & glaze all sides to yield more 'end cuts' for the chocolate- lovers.

We made this twice in one week! Had to trial it before taking it to the family Easter food fest. Surprisingly enough, with the double dose of chocolate on top, it is (shudder....)too much chocolate. We skipped the first layer the second time around. Other than that - this is spectacular!!!!!!

Very good. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out delicious. It's a little time-consuming, perhaps, but not complicated, and looks more impressive than the effort required to make it would suggest.

Make some more mousse if you can. that layer is a bit thin - or maybe I'm a bit fat...

Terrific dessert and not difficult to make (despite time commitment). I made it exactly as instructed and it turned out perfectly. By the final step, my chocolate had hardened, but placing it in the microwave for a minute allowed it to be poured over the dacquoise. Also, made a 1/2 dozen meringue cookies with the leftover meringue and cooked them on a silpat in the oven with the meringue rectangles for 60 minutes - they lasted about 5 minutes! Served dacquoise with whipped cream and fresh blackberries to cut the richness - delicious!

Loved this dessert. The meringue is delicious alone. Add the peanut butter whipcream and bittersweet chocolate and it is a show-stopping dessert. Made this one per the recipe and it turned out great. By the time I got to the last step with the chocolate, mine had hardened a bit so it could not be "poured" over the dacquoise but the issue was easily rectified by putting it in the microwave for a minute. Also, made 1/2 dozen meringue cookies on a silpat and baked 60 minutes (instead of 90) with the other meringue - very tasty. Served with some whip cream and whole fresh blackberries to break up the richness.
