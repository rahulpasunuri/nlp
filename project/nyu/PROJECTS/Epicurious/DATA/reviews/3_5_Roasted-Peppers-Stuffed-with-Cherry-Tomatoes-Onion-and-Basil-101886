Tossed 4 whole peppers (2 red/2 yellow), a sliced sweet onion & a large garlic clove (foil wrapped) onto gas grill to soften & give peppers a few charred spots. Mixed sliced cherry tomatoes, lots of basil & fresh oregano, pinch red pepper flakes, salt & pepper with olive oil. Added charred onions & roasted garlic & let marinate for a bit. Poured 14 oz can fire roasted crushed tomatoes over bottom of 9x13 baker, added layer of lightly sautéed fresh spinach, then placed peppers sliced in half, open side up and piled on the tomato salad. Baked uncovered for about 30 minutes, adding grated parm 5 minutes before removing from oven. Served on a little "nest" of angel hair pasta. Yummo. Very pretty, too.

To be fair, the peppers I cooked tonight were only "inspired" by this recipe...but they were excellent and my husband and our two guests thought they were the best peppers ever, so I'm writing this quick review/option. I used all the ingredients in this recipe as directed, but I also stuffed the peppers with chopped pre-cooked Flaffel (from Costco) mixed with a wild rice blend, an extra egg, a bit of tomato sauce, a healthy amount of Parmesan and feta cheese, plus salt and pepper. I also sauteed the onions before adding them to the mix instead of adding them raw. Once the peppers were stuffed, I put a bit of extra tomato sauce on top, topped with a slice of tomato, Parmesan and a basil leaf before cooking - the results looked very good/decorative. I know it's not really fair to give 4 forks when I didn't really cook the recipe as written, but I was so pleased with the dish that I wanted to share!

We loved this. I used red, orange and yellow peppers and mixed them up for contrast. I pretty much followed the recipe, fresh in season produce - tomatoes and basil just picked from my deck. It all went into a hot oven on a cookies sheet with a generous amount of olive oil. Excess tomatoe mixture went on the pan and was drizzled over top as it was served. I recooked the leftovers with ginger an sliced carrots and served it cold the next day and that was taty too.

Wonderful summer recipe! I added some finely chopped portobello's and a little italian sausage...turned out phenomenal! By pre-roasting the yellow peppers as recommended, all the flavors were extremely balanced. Would definately make it again and again!

I've made this several times to rave reviews. The presentation is as good as the flavor. I serve them at room temperature. Fabulous.

This is easy to make, but it is missing something. It was dull.

I haven't yet made this recipe but plan on using it tomorrow night for a party. A famous English cook, Delia Smith has a very similar recipe in which she uses snipped up anchovy fillets in each pepper, maybe this would give the missing flavour paople are looking for?

This recipe has potential, next time I'll toss the tomato mixture with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese added.

I agree with other reviewers who found this recipe OK but not great. However, it does have potential. I felt there were two problems: the tomato mixture was bland and the pepper tended to overpower everything else. The solution was simple. I added a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and 1/2 cup of chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the tomato mixture. To tone down the peppers, I roasted the peppers under the broiler, removed the skin and seeds, cut them lengthwise and then stuffed them. I let them sit around the fridge for awhile to marinated the peppers in the tomato mixture and then served them cold. I also use yellow or orange peppers to contrast them with the red of the tomatoes.

This is a great dish! It is very simple to prepare and has a wonderful, fresh taste! We make it several times during the summer when we can pick up fresh ingredients from the farmers market. Fresh ingredients are a must.

There's a recipe on this site called grilled veg with eight spice seasoning. If you put the seasoning on the tomatoes and onions and add some courgettes... oh my ... you will dissolve in a pool of drool like me. I also added a bit of Parmegiano Reggiano.

Based on the feedback from others here, I made some minor modifications, and my husband and I thought this was delicious and would go well with a steak dinner. I used red onion and topped it with shredded mozzarrella. Yummy!

These were just too bland to make again. I agree that they are beautiful, but that makes them all the more disappointing! I think it would take some work to figure out how to bump up the flavor (you'd think that the basil and garlic would have helped).

An elegant dish. I agree that it needed some changes. Suggestions: use 3 *small* garlic cloves as 3 whole-sized can be overwhelming; marinate the tomatoes & peppers first (light mix of oil, water, chopped basil & 1 garlic clove; 1.5 cups of basil. I usually serve it with a strong dish that balances out the mildness of this one.

I add pine nuts to the filling and it really enhances the flavor!

Not bad. These are gorgeous. I will make it again but will make some changes.

These looked pretty but were just not very exciting. This recipe could definitely use improvement. Next time I think I'll add sauteed mushrooms (and saute the onions with them) and top with cheese near the end of roasting. Speaking of roasting, I agree with the previous reviewer...20 minutes is not nearly long enough.

I cut up the cherry tomatoes and prepared the filling about two hours ahead of time. I then let it sit to marinate in its own juices. I also prepared the peppers (red & yellow) ahead and let them sit with the olive oil rub on them. I then cooked them on the grill topping them off with feta cheese. They were a huge hit at the dinner party with many requests for the recipe.

I added asiago cheese to this one, and chopped the cherry tomatoes into quarters. I put teh cheese on with about seven minutes left in cooking time, and it melted beautifully. It was the perfect recipe for a dinner meeting with friends.

After seeing the picture, having fresh basil and cherry tomatoes in our garden, and reading the many reviews, I decided to try the recipe, adding a favorite family seasoning - Lawry's Seasoned Salt - to liven up the taste! We prefer the peppers and tomatoes with a firmer texture so adjusted the time and temperature - 15 minutes at 375 works perfectly for us. We really enjoyed the recipe with the addition of the salt - and loved the fact that the dish could be prepared in advance and was so attractive and tasty! Tried adding feta and liked it very much!

I thought it was missing something, BEFORE I started making this. I added 1 cup of pine nuts, which moved it up a notch. I also think the peppers need to be roasted at least 30 minutes. Next time I will try to sprinkle the peppers with a dry cheese at the last few minutes they are in the oven.

I love grape tomatoes sauted in olive oil with fresh basil, so I should have loved these. I used green peppers (3 for $1) instead of red/orange/yellow ($1.79 each!); is this the problem? As a reviewer suggested, I added Lawry's salt. I also added some grated Parmesan. Whatever. They were pretty, but not very popular.

I followed the other reviewers advice and added some goat cheese - I thought it was okay, I think if I were to make it again I would chop plum tomatoes.

I made this with yellow bell peppers. Basil and the grape or bryan tomatoes are growing in my garden now. Visually this was beautiful. I am generous with the basil and add some feta on top. Even my kids like these stuffed bells. My kids prefer the yellow to the red peppers as I've tried both ways.

Tasted yummier after I found out it has 76 calories per serving! Next time will try Feta & olives and see if I can remedy that.

thought this was pretty good...the smell of it cooking is REALLY good... i added some goat cheese as someone had suggested, but it didn't seem enough. scooped out the filling, stirred in some cooked couscous with parmesan, re-stuffed the peppers, and re-roasted the whole shebang. yum. next time will add olives, and maybe try wild rice instead.

Used this basic recipe in a my restaurant as the veg entree. Added a few ounces of goat cheese to the filling and garnished the finished product with chopped kalamatas and feta crumbles. A huge hit.

I thought this recipe was a nice variation in color and texture for any meal. I added some crumbled feta and it was even tastier!

I'm with the reviewer from Alberta - not particularly interesting. Now if you "doctor" it up as another reviewer noted adding other ingredients such as parmesan, yellow peppers (with the red cherry tomatoes), etc., etc., it might be worth trying again. It's a colorful presentation for entertaining.

This is a great summer recipe when tomatoes are ripe and fresh. I don it over indirect heat on a covered gas grill. It's easy, can be prepared ahead of time, looks colorful, and tastes great. I like its versatility as well. You can add what you like and take away what you don't. Yum.

Delicious way to use fresh picked cherry tomatoes. I also added some parmesan cheese, slivers of proscuitto and green onions. Asagio cheese would be good too! Enjoy with fresh bread to soak up all the juices. Would probably be good with rosemary, oregano and feta cheese too!

I used yellow peppers instead of red. It was sweeter to the taste and much prettier! These are very easy to make and absolutely delicious!

The roasted cherry tomatoes are divine in these delicious stuffed peppers. I'll definitely use this as one of my staple recipes. Yum!
