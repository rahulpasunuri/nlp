I made this crown roast for immediate family on Christmas Eve 2011. Fabulous. Stuffing is the best...made with homemade rosemary focaccia. Next time I would rub the roast with more sage & marjoram & less salt.

This recipe was a smash hit for Christmas Eve dinner! The pork came out juicy and delicious & everyone raved about how good it was. The hubs and I made a few additions, which we'd highly recommend: -Added chopped prunes and a 1/2 cup of unfiltered apple juice to the stuffing. The original stuffing reminded us a little too much of a turkey stuffing, so we opted to add a touch of sweetness to compliment the pork. SO tasty! Also, instead of just putting water in the bottom of the roasting pan, we used a mixture of water and unfiltered apple juice. This made for the most delicious gravy imaginable! It was truly to-die-for on top of the pork. Also used flour to thicken the gravy instead of cornstarch (which tends to be a little gooey for our taste). The presentation of this roast is so much fun, too. It's a real show stopper. After my husband cut the chops, he arranged them back in their original crown shape so they could be served at the table in all their glory... HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Very nice recipe. First time crown roast for me. I recommend simple brining for 12-24 hrs and definitely allow the cooked roast to rest. My roast was 14 lbs and even with central stuffing, roast did not take 2.5 hours, so make sure to use dig thermometer. Highly recommended use of Cranberry Horseradish + Celeriac/Apple Puree. Delicious. Guests demolished plates. Gravy was good - but there were not many drippings - so plan ahead if you think guests may want more sauce.

A truly exceptional Thanksgiving main course! Made exactly as described (roast, stuffing, gravy), except for a longer cooking time at increasingly lower oven temperatures owing to our guests calling several times delaying their arrivals. I don't know exactly what part the quality of the butcher counts for, but we went to the best, which didn't increase the price much. Magnificent.

Made 7lb crown roast of pork for 6 people, have plenty of leftover. Guests love it! I used focaccia according to one reviewer and cubed instead of breadcrumb, the stuffing is delicious! Pulled the roast out at 150F and rest for 30 min. (after had been cooking for 2.30 hours! - I thought smaller roast will take less time but it doesn't) The sauce is also good (taste a bit of white wine in there) Definitely will make it again!

This recipe is great. I don't often make crown roast of pork, so I use the stuffing and sauce recipe with roasted chicken or turkey. Homemade chicken broth is really much better than canned.

Made it exactly as written and this is the best thing I have ever made. The roast, the stuffing and the sauce were to die for. The smell in the house amazing! Made it for Christmas Eve and was a huge hit. Served with Potato Gratin with Gruyere and Creme Fraiche and Roasted Green Beans with Shallots and Cashews and satueed apples with brown sugar/balsamic glaze! Wow!

Served this for T'giving dinner as we wanted to do something along with turkey. Our butcher didnt do a great job of making it look pretty, but it tasted great! Used rosemary focaccia for the stuffing. The gravy was wonderful. Served with roasted red taters and a spiced onion marmalade and the whole meal was to die. Drank Patricia Green Pinot noir. Yum.

I made this the other night for a dinner party for eight. Didn't make the stuffing, just mashed potatoes. Very tender and moist. Will rub the seasoning inside next time. 10 lbs was plenty with leftovers too. Made gravy from an Emeril Lagasse recipe "Pork Roast with Bacon, Mushroom Gravy". Also made roasted green beans as a side and chocolate decadence for dessert with home made whipped cream and raspberry puree. Best dinner I ever made.

Very good, especially the stuffing. I fumbled on the degree F to C conversion and was cooking it a shy low so it took longer (4 hours). But I caught the mistake around 2.5 hours and cranked the heat up and the end result wsa right on the money. I used a 16 oz package of Pepperidge Farm stuffing crumbs. I had to use a little more butter (1/2 stick) when mixing the crumbs/ground pork. Great piece o' meat and very comfortly served 12 of us with leftovers (roast cost $30 from commissary here).

I've served a similar recipe numerous times with very impreesive results. This year I garnished the ribs with kumquats rather than paper hats and loved the look. Very elegant. My original recipe used dried apple in the sauce and I've lost it. My family loved the sauce. If anyone has that recipe, I'd love to have it again just for the sauce. I improvised and it was pretty good but lacked something. Any crown roast is easy and elegant. I wouldn't bother with filet of beef again because it is so easy to ruin if overcooked even a little bit and there are so many distractions on Xmas day.

Pork was great, turned out moist. Stuffing was the best part. Baked bread crumbs to dry out a little more. Added an apple with the onions. Chicken stock and half cup of parmesan before baking. Used 1lb sweet Italian sausage instead of ground pork. Don't waste your time stuffing the pork. Not worth it. New favorite stuffing.

Served this for Christmas Eve 2008 and it did not disappoint. Cheated by buying chopped onions at Whole Foods (worth the cost, truly, since the recipe calls for a LOT of chopped onions) so it was EASY. Left the bread cubed, didn't do crumbs, worked great. And yes, you do brown the pork first even though the recipe isn't clear. We pulled the roast at 147 degrees but wish we had done it a little sooner, maybe 145 because it keeps cooking. We had a big group, cooked a 14 lb roast, served 20 people (with leftovers) and took about 2 1/2 hours to cook, less time than we thought! Don't skip the sauce, it is great. Roasted some apples for garnish, those were good too. Will definitely make this again.

Served this roast, along with the stuffing, sauce, potato lardons, frenched green beans, and cranberry horseradish sauce as the main course for our 2008 annual progressive dinner. Everyone loved the presentation of the roast as well as how good everything tasted! Most of the prep work can be done a day ahead for each of these recipes in the "Christmas Present" menu from Gourmet Dec. 2005. Both sauces were especially good: the roast/stuffing sauce, and the Cranberry Horseradish sauce. Our 16 yr old son loved the leftovers! I followed each recipe to the "T" and served a nice Merlot. There is time involved in preparation, but well worth the effort; will definitely prepare this entire menu again.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! This is my first one I ever did and it came out great. Pulled it out when the temp read 145-47 degrees and it was perfectly cooked. Stuffing was a huge hit although I cooked it fully in seperate pan and put none in the roast per my butchers recommendation. Just rubbed the roast in sea salt and fresh ground pepper. 12.5 roast took a little over 2.5 hours. Stuffing was outstanding and this dish was a hit all the way around.

I made this for the first time at our family Pre-Christmas dinner. The roast was just as delicious as the reviews indicated. However; the dressing was not a big hit. First, there was way too much. Next time, I will only make enough for the 2 cups on top of the roast. The sauce was good, but not really worth all of the effort. I think I will search for a different sauce, or serve with applesauce. I will be looking on the site for an alternative dressing. Great presentation and, again, the roast itself was wonderful

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. The ground pork that the butcher gave w/ the roast was 95% fat, so I left that out and added 3 large links of mild Italian Sausage, browned and chopped. Also added 1 1/2 c chopped prunes. The stuffing seemed dry, so I added 3/4 cup chix stock with a beaten egg in it. Results were wonderful.

This recipe was delicious! I made it for Christmas 2007 for about 12 people. I got a 10 lb crown and brined it for a day (24h) using a brine recipe from this site. I wasn't able to fit a cooling rack inside my roasting pan, so the crown went directly in the pan. I added brine for the liquid and had to keep adding liquid throught the cooking process. It was extremely moist and it was done in about 2.5 hours (convection oven). I used a thermometer until it read 145. The stuffing is really good, even though I used a French loaf. I did not like the stuffing inside the crown, it was too "wet" for my taste. I think the brining really helped the meat to be so moist. It was a hit! I served with a celery root puree and the cramberry horseradish sauce.

This was a great change to my Chirstmas Eve menu for 18...I rubbed the roast the night before for extra flavor. My roast was over 11 lbs. and removed at 150 degrees but was a bit more well done than I'd like. I would definitely remove at 140 degrees. Stuffing and sauce are amazing. I used sour dough bread and left it in larger pieces rather that making crumbs. Also didn't have any left over ground pork from butcher, so I purchased separately. Prep time is a bit long but worth it, I made the stuffing a day ahead. I will definitley make this again.

Made this dish for Christmas dinner and it came out wonderful. Everyone was amazed because of how elegant it looked and how great it tasted. Cooked a 9-3/4 lb roast for 2-1/2 hours and it came out perfect. Moist and full of flavor. I served it with both the pan gravy and cranberry horseradish sauce from this website on the side for people to pick. An absolutely excellent dish.

Made this for my Christmas Eve Dinner. It was delicious and a beautiful table center piece. I did make a few changes. I added rosemary, orange zest and garlic along with the other herbs mentioned in the recipe to make an herb olive oil mixture. I rubbed this all over the roast before baking. The outcome was outstanding! This will remain among my holiday favorites.

I made this for Christmas lunch and received rave reviews! Since I was unable to get a crown roast, I made a rolled/stuffed version instead. I used 4 small pork loin roasts (about 1 pound each) that I had my butcher butterfly. I made half the amount stuffing (prepared the night before and refrigerated covered) and rolled the pork around the stuffing, tying with cooking twine. I placed the 4 rolled loin roasts in a baking dish and roasted for about 90 minutes before my meat thermometer reached 155. Since there werent a lot of juices that cooked out, I made the full recipe of the sauce. I paired this dish with cranberry horseradish sauce and potato and lardon casserole. I completed the meal with roasted asparagus with hollandaise sauce and a tossed salad. It was a wonderful and simplemeal! A definite keeper and one I will certainly make again!

The meat from this recipe was mediocre. The best part was the gravy. While the presentation looks beautiful when you take it out of the oven, you don't serve it that way at the table (it really needs to be carved at the kitchen counter), so I think this whole concept is overrated. Won't bother again.

This is Amazing. The stuffing was incredible. It did take time but well worth it. I cubed the bread and assembled the day before and cooked it all in a seperate dish from the roast. I substituted a regular pork loin roast for the crown roast. Served with the Potatos and the cranberry Horseradish sauce. Will make this a Christmas Eve Tradition! Will do the Crown Roast next time.

I also made this for Christmas dinner. This was my first time making a crown roast and it was super easy. The meat was cooked perfectly, though I cut the time by about 30 minutes since I have a convection over. The only thing was that the stuffing was way too labor intensive for the taste. I would do a more traditional stuffing next time, though the onion mixture really made the gravy great. I also made homemade applesauce to serve with it, which was a hit. Everyone loved it, and I'll definitely make it again!

This was a delicious menu. My guests kept giving me complements and my daughter said she thought it was the best holiday meal we've had. She and others commented that the seasonings of thyme and etc.was so good and that it was an elegant dinner. They also loved the stuffing. I too kept the bread in cubes and also made the Potates and Lardon Casserole and it was wonderful. When I first made the cranberry horseradish and tasted it I was concerned because it was so strong.But it went great w/the pork. Excellent and loved by all.

I made this recipe for Christmas last year, and forgot to submit my review. This was absolutely one of the best dishes I have ever tasted or prepared.

I made this for Christmas dinner. It was fantastic!!! All my guest raved about it. I would definitely make it again. I think it is very important to have the best quality of meat.

This is one of the best recipes for pork I have every made!

My roast was 11.5 pounds and was done on time or a little early. My thermometer must be a little off because at 160 it was perfect, juicy, etc. I made the stuffing with the ground pork, but without the cider vinegar (no reason, I just forgot and put in some chicken broth). I too left the bread in cubes - laziness and lack of confidence in the results since it was for company. When I spend $100 for meat, I don't want to take unnecessary chances. I made gravy rather than sauce, but followed the directions (except for adding more onion mixture since my daughter isn't fond of onions). Everyone raved about the gravy. All in all, despite the cost, this recipe is a keeper. The butcher said I would have lots of leftovers -- I had enough for one meal for my husband and me - that's it. 10 adults nearly demolished the roast, and despite lots of sides. I also made fresh applesauce (we had latkes first) and the horseradish-cranberry sauce on this site. Raves for that as well. One guest is a restaurant owner, so I love to impress her.

Very tasty roast and wonderful presentation. My butcher did not include ground pork as I'd requested and I had no opportunity to get some so my stuffing was pork-free. The pork-free stuffing was good but not terrific and lot more labor-intensive than the stuffing I normally make for turkey. The sauce was great! Will definately make again WITH the ground pork in the stuffing.

The stuffing is wonderful. I opted to leave the bread in chunks rather than making crumbs. The roast (I had 7.2 lbs) took longer to roast than indicated. I used convection oven but kept the temperature as indicated in the recipe. With convection, it should have taken a shorter time to roast. I'll just plan for more time the next time I bake it. I'll use this stuffing with turkey and chicken, also. So yummy.

This dish was superb! We cooked it until the pinkness was just gone, and it took longer than the prescribed 2.5 hours...more like 2.75 or 3 hours. The stuffing was also excellent. We also used organic pork roast which as always made the flavor just right.

A great dish, not only for the holidays !! Meat was well seasoned and very juicy. Stuck exactly to the recipe, only baked the roast to 145 ( yes, you will need a thermometer :-)), let rest covered for 30 min. Didn't cover with foil while baking, cooked stuffing separately. Everybody loved it and it looked spectacular.

Ever think how boring turkey really is? You think you like it, tradition and all, yet, yet, well friends, let down your guard and put that order in. Crown Roast of Pork is truly celebration cooking at its finest. Make sure you have a meat thermometer. Brine the roast only if you plan to overcook it. One fifty-five is a very very solid medium. I'll cook mine to 145 next time. Warning, the color at the top of the roast will look raw, even at 155 degrees. This is great. Stuffing was cooked in a separate dish (I hate soggy stuffing) and was light and delicious. You will throw your turkey recipes away for good.

This roast was a huge hit with my Christmas dinner guests -- fabulous presentation, delectably light, crisp stuffing and a sauce to die for. My roast was 12 lbs. and reached 155 within 2 1/2 hours -- a lot sooner than expected.
