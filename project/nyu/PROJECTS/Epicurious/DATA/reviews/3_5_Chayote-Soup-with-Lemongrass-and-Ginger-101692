All I can say is that I'm a bit addicted to this soup. Made this again today. Took it to the next level by doing as per review below, and: added a serrano chile to the broth. Pulled out the leaves and pureed garlic, bit of the ginger, and chile. After the chayotes were cooked, I added a bag of cilantro chicken dumplings (from TJ or you can also use thai shrimp)in the last 6 minutes, and 3/4 pound of shrimp in the last 3 minutes. WOW!

What a nice surprise this soup is! Light and delicious, so easy to make. I added some thai basil and garlic to the broth and used chicken boulion. Finished with cilantro instead of parsley and used tamarind concentrate for the lime. I will make this again and again.

So delicious! I found the chayote squash at my local grocery store and I didn't know what it was but bought it anyway to find and try some new recipe. I substituted vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and I used lime zest instead of kaffir leaves. For a personal touch I added 2 medium chopped tomatoes and some snow peas at the end. So flavourful, will definitely make again.

The recipe is good, but note as spicy as I'd like. Nex time I'll add more cayenne (maybe 150% as much.)

If I could give this recipe 5 forks, I would. My dinner guests and I loved it!!. 2 changes...on accidently and the other on purpose. I forgot to add the lemon juice at the end, but did add some chicken and cabbage dumplings I got at the asian market. Soooo good! Only one negative thought....no leftovers....guess I'll just have to make it again...

My family and I really liked this a lot. Very flavorful. I added a bit of lime zest since I couldn't find the kaffir lime leaves (a vietnamese recipe I often make suggests this as an alternative). My 12 year old daughter especially loved this soup. In fact she just called from a friends house a minute ago and requested that I please make it tonight. She said she can't get the good taste out of her head! I'd say that is one great review!
