FAIRLY EASY. PUT A PANSEY IN ASPIC IN INDIVIDUAL RAMEKINS. LOOKED LOVELY WHEN INVERTED. SERVED ON A BED OF BABY GREENS WITH A HONEY DIJON DRIZZLE AND TOASTED BAGUETTES.

I use this sight all the time, and depend on the fork ratings to guide me. I've never been dissapointed until I made this for guests who I have'nt cooked for before. Yuck ! Do not make this , it's awful, and I'm not a picky eater. P. S. Yes you can divide into smaller portions . I did and threw them all out. Yuck! . I did
