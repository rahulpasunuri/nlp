this must be a bayless recipe. very tasty. i used black beans (as suggested in the note) and ricotta salata for fillings. one thing to bear in mind: this dough needs to be soft, very soft--like cookie dough. it's important that the final fritter be shaped like a flat pill. cook the dough thoroughly before frying.

I concur with cook from San Francisco: These were good but not overwhelmingly so. I did not have a tortilla press so I used the bottom of a cast-iron skillet.

These were tasty, though not mind-blowingly so. The cakes have a nice crunchy texture and the filling adds a subtle flavor. Make sure you use a strong goat cheese, otherwise they will be kind of bland. The accompanying salsa is tasty, but I thought it overpowered the flavor of the cakes. Might be better with a roasted tomato salsa. They were easy to make. I don't have a tortilla press, so after placing them between the plastic, I flattened the balls a bit with my palm, then rolled them with a rolling pin.
