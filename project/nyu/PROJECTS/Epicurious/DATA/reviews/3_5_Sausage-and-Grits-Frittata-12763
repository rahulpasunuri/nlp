I made this tonight for my family and we all rated it 4 forks. Even my picky son, who proceeded to pick out all the red bell pepper. I made two changes: I used ground sausage as I didn't have kielbasa and Mozzarella cheese as I was fresh out of Cheddar. I also added 2 more eggs, so technically that's 3 changes. I tossed the grits into the freezer for a minute or two - after 8 minutes in the refrigerator - and they cut up just fine. Loved them in the frittata - so did my non-grit-loving husband. Can't wait to eat leftovers for breakfast tomorrow!

This was a big hit in our house. I was hoping it would go over well as my husband doesn't like grits. I think he's weakened his stance a bit! I doubled the recipe and used a larger skillet and it came out fine. I think it serves more than two, because the doubled recipe served 4 for dinner, plus breakfast and lunch the next day. Its good eaten cold or reheated too. Really easy meal and loved by kids and adults.

I made this just like the recipe said, except the grits did not work as directed. After 15 min. in the refrig., the grits were still gloppy. So I just stirred them in as is, which worked absolutely fine. Very, very tasty frittata.

I trippled this for a brunch for 6 as well. Note - if you do increase the recipe, it's important to divide this among 2 frying pans, as other reviewers have suggested. I didn't and it took forever to cook, and left a dark brown bottom as a result. It still tasted wonderful, but it looked overdone. Planning to make again for a day-after-Christmas bruch with inlaws.

Tripled this recipe for a brunch (used two large frying pans). It was a huge hit! I'm not sure the grits added anything but they were a nice conversation piece as most of my guests had never had them. "cayenne to taste" was an annoying instruction since you can't really taste the dish until it's fully cooked. Anyone have a measurement suggestion? I used 3 dashes and it wasn't enough.

I have to agree with the others. I don't care for frittatas, but this was a hit! Have made several times. It is a very flexible recipe to make with what I have on hand.

Terrific flavors. Used a "light" kielbasa & colby jack cheese with good results. Served with hash browns & made for a very satisfying dinner.

I made this for breakfast Christmas morning for my family. I substituted 1/4 pound of turkey sausage for the smoked kielbasa. It was wonderful and I will definitely make it again!

This was awesome! It was my first frittata, but definitely will not be my last! It was very easy and delicious, and impressed my brunch guests!

Our favorite fritatta! Have made it many times. Great leftover lunch! Great Sunday supper with salad, bread and a glass of white wine!

I substituted a lot on this recipe - and it came out really well. Instead of the kielbasa, I used 3 tvp veggie breakfast patties, substituted leftovers from another recipe (steamed asparagus with ginger garlic sauce) for the red bell pepper, onions for scallions and fresh parmasean for the cheddar cheese. It was yummy! Would definately make again - great brunch dish!
