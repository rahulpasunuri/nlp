I think this is delicious. Did the recipe almost as written. Used finely diced red bell pepper instead of the green onion (we're not onion fans). It added nice color and flavor. Also, added cayenne to the sauce per the previous reviewer. I chilled them after making the patties for several hours before cooking and the cakes came together beautifully. Very easy, inexpensive way to get more salmon into our diet.

I used canned salmon and will never use again. This recipe is probably fine with left over cooked fresh salmon but I would strongly recommend NOT using canned. The whole house stank after I made them. The best part was the celery, don't skip it, it adds a nice flavor and texture.

I used frozen salmon from Trader Joe's; poached quickly in white wine/water/dill/lemon, then prepared exactly according to recipe. I did refrigerate the salmon cakes for about 3 hours before cooking; they required a bit of work to form into cohesive cakes, but I think the refrigeration helped a lot. I served these as "salmon burgers" on toasted buns, with the sauce and some greens coated lightly with olive oil. The cakes were very tasty; I will be taking leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I was looking for something that simulated my childhood "salmon patties" of Catholic Friday (meatless) dinners; these were MUCH better; the salmon flavor was quite distinct; the texture was more of solid salmon with some crunch from celery and onions.

Quick, easy to make, outstanding result! Didn't have corn flakes on hand used yellow corn taco chips instead. Used higher quality canned salmon, which I believe made a big difference if you don't have fresh. The horseradish sauce was exceptional as well. To finish, I added some chopped red onion, red tomato, and tomatillo as a kind of relish on the side. Man that hit the spot.

Loved this recipe! I used Arnold's herb bread crumbs instead of corn flakes, and I substitued celery salt instead of fresh celery and last I substituted red onion for green onion. It all came out perfect!

I love this recipe. It's easy and a great way to use leftover salmon. The only change I would recommend is adding cayenne to the sauce to add a little heat.

We LOVED these. Brought back memories of childhood. When made with the canned salmon, they are pretty much like Mom made.

I made the cakes using canned bumble bee red salmon and panko bread crumbs and was not thrilled. the cakes were ok but that's all. It may have been the canned salmon, not the recipe. It was a bit too fishy and mushy. I didn't make the sauce but usedgood prepared tartar sauce and capers.

Very good. I used panko instead of bread crumbs, red onion vs green, 1/2 TB of grainy dijon mustard and a little Frank's Hot Sauce.

This recipe was excellent! So easy to make! The sauce is a little bland for my tastes so I added garlic, lemon pepper seasoning, and a garlic herb seasoning. A great sauce choice for those you don't care for the usual thousand island sauce. Leftover sauce is also great with veggies!

yum yum. the best salmon cake recipe yet. the sauce is a must - i put extra horseradish in the sauce and used braggs instead of worchestershire for the cakes.

I made this tonight using one piece of leftover salmon filet that had been grilled. I substituted shallots as I had no scallions. I minced the shallots and celery in a mini processor, added the mayo (reducing everything as it was for only 2 servings)and the rest of ingredients using Panko breadcrumb in the cakes and a little extra outside. This helped to absorb the moisture that was from forming them ahead of time and keeping in the refrigerator until I was ready to brown them. I also used olive oil to brown them and then added two handfuls of baby spinach to the pan after I removed the cakes. My husband really liked them...which surprised us both.

I made a platter of these salmon cakes (appetizer size) for my Aunt's 98th birthday party. Everybody loved them, and the sauce was excellent as well. They looked very pretty garnished with extra thyme sprigs and lemon wedges. I did not include the egg, added a little more mayonnaise, and only 1/4 C. panko crumbs, and they still held together perfectly.

I really like this recipe. I used fresh salmon and bread crumbs instead of corn flakes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I used some cayenne pepper in both the cakes and the sauce. This recipe tastes as good as any cakes from a restaurant.

I reviewed this recipe earlier and loved it. I have a wonderful time-saving variation: in place of the mayo in the cakes, use Marie's Honey Mustard dressing. Also put out a dish of this dressing in place of the lemon-herb mayonnaise. It is the best!!

This was a great way to use a lot of salmon I had in the freezer. I made the cakes exactly as written but used wasabi ginger sauce in place of the horseradish and everyone loved them. I had some leftover sauce and it was great on a turkey sandwich! Any type of salsa or sauce will go well with the salmon cakes. You don't really need the sauce - they are that good.

Four forks for great taste, quick and easy. I fried them in olive oil but made the recipe as written. Fresh Alaskan silver salmon helped, I'm sure.

We really enjoyed this recipe--easy and delicious! I used canned salmon and bread crumbs (leftovers that were mixed with herbs and garlic) instead of cornflakes. Next time, I'll halve the sauce, though--it was good, but there was just too much of it!

Rating: 3
A great dish. I did not have a few of the ingredients (green onion and worchestershire sauce) but went ahead and made it without. The dish was still very good. One thing I would recommend is slightly more cornflake crumbs than suggested, because my salmon cakes did not hold together quite as well as I wanted. Other than that, a great recipe!

mmmm, yep, this is a good one. I used red onion rather than green, and served with wasabi mayo rather than the above recipe. Mmmm! I agree about using fresh salmon if you can.

Would not suggest canned salmon (or canned anything). Fresh bread crumbs instead of corn flakes were very good. Press panko on to the outside of the cakes and saute in olive oil.

Made this with leftover grilled salmon and loved it as much as a crab cake! Used fresh bread crumbs, fresh thyme and everything else the same. Served on a bun with lettuce and a roasted red pepper mayo - 1/2 of a roasted red pepper, 1/4 cup mayo, garlic powder, lemon juice and cayenne pepper to taste. To die for!

Excellent! These were tasty & presented very well. Flavorful & easy sauce, too. I poached .8 lb Atlantic salmon (place salmon in wide pot, cover w/water & add 1 tsp salt; bring to boil then turn off, cover 10 min, drain, transfer to fridge), subbed 1/4 c minced onion & 1 T minced parsley for gr onion, 1/2 tsp thyme only, 1/2 c. panko breadcrumbs (for cornflakes) & remaining ingred from recipe. When combined I dipped them in a little more panko crumbs before frying. Made probably 1/2 the sauce, which was enough for 2 adults (my young kids didn't like it). Definitely will make again.

These were easy to make - I had leftover grilled salmon. Much better than store-bought fishcakes. I didn't have the patience to make the sauce, so I just threw together my own take on tartar sauce. The salmon cakes did need something to jazz them up a bit.

Delicious, quick and easy way to prepare an elegant appetizer or a great way to use extra cooked salmon. Was so tasty that I didn't even make the mayonnaise topping. I used about a cup of fresh toasted bread crumbs.

These were wonderful salmon cakes. I used farm atlantic salmon that I cubed into 1 inch cubes and cooked with 1 Tbsp of water for six minutes in the micro. I covered them with a paper towel and nothing more. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly except subbing town house cracker crumbs for the corn flakes. I left the chunks of salmon quite big. I added a drop of water to break up the egg befor adding it to the mix. I tossed only gently. This was sooooo goooood. For mayonaise, I had some hellmans horseradish mayo on hand. I microplaned a few shredds of lemon peel and juice of half a lemon. It was quite hot, but a perfect accompanyment. This recipe is definitely worth trying.

Yummy! I used canned salmon and bread crumbs instead of cornflakes. I cut out the thyme because it was overpowering the salmon flavor. Also, we just make 1/3 of the sauce and that is more than enough. This is a new family favorite! Easy and delicious.

Good cakes, easy & nice to prepare in advance. Not a cornflake in the house, so used fresh breadcrumbs instead. Should have only made a half recipe of the sauce -- good, but it made more than we needed.

What a wonderful way to use leftover cooked salmon, though I am anxious to try other fish as well. I skipped the cornflakes and used fresh bread crumbs, omitted the thyme (so the flavor of the salmon would not be compromised), and just added the white of the egg. The horseradish combined with lemon was wonderful. Instead of thyme I substituted fresh snipped chives. I, too, will now cook extra fish at home so we can enjoy the leftovers with this recipe!

Yum! Even better than my mom used to make!! I used canned salmon, which was fine, but I went a bit overboard with the thyme (will use a bit less next time!), but very very good overall. At first I thought they were too dry and almost added more mayonnaise, but the problem went away after adding the egg. I didn't bother with the sauce, just served them with mashed potatoes and we ate them up. My boyfriend has asked that these go in the regular rotation!

This is a great recipe with a couple of additions. I added about 1/4 cup red bell peppers (chopped fine) and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper to zip it up a little. The mayo sauce needs something, but I haven't decided what. All in all, it is a delicious recipe and I've added it to my recipe box!

I agree with everyone else, great use of leftover salmon! I buy extra now just to have these a day or 2 later! For those of you w/ Trader Joe's (supermarket) their dill jalapeno tarter sauce is AWESOME with them! I, too, used goldfish crackers once, saltines another time. Use whatever you have.

This has become my favorite recipe for left over salmon. I use Panko in lieu of the conr flakes and at times add chopped celery. I din't care for the sauce so I use a chili flavored mayo thinned with sake and it is always a hit!

We've made these with both salmon and canned tuna. Both the cakes and sauce are tasty but quite heavy when served together. I'll probably make a lighter sauce next time for the cakes, and pair the dipping sauce with a steamed artichoke instead. Yum!

I've made these salmon cakes twice now, both times with canned salmon. They're delicious. The nice thing about this recipe is that it is rather versatile, as you can see from previous reviews. I added lemon zest this last time, and used bread crumbs instead of the crushed cornflakes.

I thought I had everything for the recipe before I started, but was missing the bread crumbs, & I also used canned salmon, which worked wonderfully. Strangely, there were instant potato buds in the pantry (slumber party left over?), which I used instead of bread crumbs. I also added 1/4 cup chopped red onion. No Worchestershire, but I did have anchovy paste, & since the main ingredient in Worchestershire is anchovy (Really!) that was a good substitute. I'll make this recipe again: it was delicious.

We also used leftover grilled salmon for this recipe. Added some capers... and used half low-fat mayo and half sour cream for the sauce to try and lower the calories. Definately will make it again. And will try the other suggested variations: chopped jalapeno/cumin, parsley/lemon/capers.

A simple and very tasty way to use up leftover salmon. The salmon was previously grilled in my case, which added a nice smoky note. I increased the vegetable content somewhat and added a chopped jalapeno to "kick it up a notch." Doing so meant increasing the mayo to better bind everything together. I despise low fat mayonnaise, so I might try a mayo yogurt combination next time to reduce the fat a little. Adding egg whites might also work. I think the raita suggestion from an earlier review is a good one, as the mayonnaise sauce is kind of unimaginative and obviously fat laden. This will sound strange, but all I had on hand were Pepperidge Farm Goldfish, which I ground up to use in place of the corn flakes. I recommend them highly. I may also try dried polenta or cornmeal next time, which might give these more of a southwestern feel, especially with the addition of the jalapeno (and perhaps cilantro and cumin in place of the thyme?) I served these on baby greens with a sauvignon blanc--great summer combo. I had the leftovers for lunch the next day cold and they were almost as good. They'd make a great addition to a picnic with some cold champagne and a beautiful woman. Any takers?

Looks like I, as did most other reviewers, substituted the corn flakes. Why "pollute" the recipe, especially if you're using fresh salmon and thyme? I used Panko (japanese breadcrumbs used for tempura) that made the cakes very flaky and delicate and added julienned red roasted peppers. Then made aoli from scratch in the blender sans horseradish and have found a new favorite sauce for seafood. Utilized fresh aoli in cakes, too. Plated the cakes on top of a bed of fresh spinach, served up some Pinot Noir, and sat outside under the umbrella, and enjoyed a perfect summer evening dish!

Nice, light recipe. Used fresh breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes, sub'ed chopped onion for green, had no celery, put a dash of cayenne in, turned out well. Nothing super spectacular, but salmon cakes are rather light. Fresh thyme works well but can see dill would do well nicely. Sauce was great and finishes off dish well. I added bit more horseradish to my tastes.

This is a great recipe for using up your salmon leftovers. My husband and I love grilled salmon, but, often times, my eyes are bigger than my stomach and I end up buying too much. Now I buy too much on purpose so that I have enough to make this the next day. This dish also travels well if you need something that you can do all the prep for at home and do the final saute someplace else.

I used the proportions here with some variations that I'm sure greatly improved it. Forget the dry cornflakes, it takes only a few seconds to whirl up some fresh bread crumbs in the food processor--I used about 1/2 to 3/4 cup. I omitted the thyme and worstershire for some chopped cilantro. I added a touch more mayo--just enough to lightly bind the ingredients. Anyone who whould eat this dressing must be crazy for fat. If you want this dressing cut lofat mayo cut with lofat sour cream or yogurt. I made a raita by mixing yogurt with cucumber, mint, red onion and a little Indian spices, and spooned this over the top of the patties. Served on a bed of greens with sliced papaya, it made a great dinner for 2.

Got rave reviews as an Hors d'ouerve. Used poached salmon steaks. Kept salmon in "chunks",which made it difficult to stick together. Used more seasoning- paprika,parsley, and dipped in breadcrumb before frying. Next time, I'll cook salmon less to start, and fry on high heat only to brown. Used my own sauce.

I used canned salmon which was a mistake. The patties were VERY fishy tasting and were just plain awful (besides the fact that my whole house reeks). Had to throw most of it out. Maybe it would've been better with fresh salmon, but after such a bad result I'm reluctant to try again!

Am I the only one who had a problem with the patties not holding together? It seemed a little dry; I suppose another egg was in order but I was reluctant to do that. And I think we would've been a lot happier with fresh vs canned salmon. Basically, we were disappointed. Nice sauce, though.

Now that salmon is so plentiful and inexpensive, I seem to have leftovers on hand often. We enjoyed these cakes. I was fresh out of cornflake crumbs so used crushed flavored crackers. I also used an egg product instead of the egg and cooking spray and some leftover tartar sauce that I made from another recipe. Turned out great and I'll be using this recipe again.
