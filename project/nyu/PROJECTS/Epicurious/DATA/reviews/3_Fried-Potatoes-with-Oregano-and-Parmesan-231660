Oily but fragrant. Tried to salvage the dish by crisping the potatoes with the oven broiler for a few minutes. Will trying again with baking only...and a lot less oil.

A new family favorite! As a culinary experiment, I tried this dish both fried and baked on the same night. The baked version was much better - I personally like the slightly burnt crispy edges. Using powdered parmesan cheese (in a crunch), I mixed all ingredients in a bowl and then baked at 425 degrees. The fried version was still great tasting yet I like more crunchiness...will definitely make this again.

This dish was perfect. I wouldnt change any bit of it the only thing i did different was that i added less salt so then each person could add the amount of salt for them.

I did both baking and frying. My family could not get enough of it. I made the potatoes sort of soft and squishy, and baking them gave just the right consistency. I also added all the spices to the potatoes before tossing them in the frying pan. They came out really well, especially with the crunchy cheese. Thanks for the advice.

This is a quick and easy recipe to fix. I took the advice of others and baked the potatoes, minus the cheese, in a 425 degree oven. I used freeze-dried oregano, freshly ground sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper. I don't know if that made the difference or what, but they were very flavorful. To save fat grams, use an olive oil spray on the potatoes. Be sure to spray the bottom of the pan, however, or they will stick. I used freshly grated cheese. It was a cinch to grate with a very sharp, very fine grater. Don't know why others thought this was so difficult to prepare. Don't be tempted to use ground oregano. It won't have the same flavor as dried.

I used Walnut oil instead of Olive oil. It holds a higher heat before smoking, I was able to use less than the 1/4 cup suggested of Olive oil, and it also contains a greater amount of omega3's. It gave the potatoes a nice nutty flavor too. Whenever frying ANY vegetable I never add salt until *after* browning because the aslt tends to bring the water out of the vegatables and they steam rather than fry nicely. We really enjoyed this recipe and since it was prepared light and healthy we didnt feel the least bit guilty eating it. I will certainly cook it again.

No, sorry, just didn't care for this. I have had better, easier potatoes using good old Shake-N-Bake potato seasoning that you bake, not fry. Of course, if you are trying to control your sodium, DO NOT use the shake-n-bake. The sodium is out of control. The above recipe would be better (without the salt; use a sub) but I would recommend oven roasting, not oil frying. Over all this is a no.

Tasty, but very labor intensive. Not all that original, either. I mean, what's so special about fried potatoes? I also added a hefty sprinkling of cayenne. Otherwise, this dish seems kind of bland.

I should give it 2 forks because the 1st time we made it we got burnt oregano & pepper which didn't taste good at all. However, we tried again just adding those in the end and we loved it, so there goes the 3 forks. Also, be carefull because the oil really splutters when you add the salt. Perhaps it's also better to save this for after the frying. The texture of these potatos is amazing.

Calling these "fried" potatoes is somewhat of a misnomer--1/4 cup olive oil does not "fried"make. Actually I followed the advice of the reviewer who suggested roasting at 425 and the potatoes were delicious--the cheese and onions make the dish almost like a gratin but without the milk or cream

My husband & both loved these potatoes! Easy, flavorful, perfect comfort food. We served with garlic creamed spinach from this site (DELICIOUS!) and a fried egg. This was a slightly kicked up version of a meal I was served years ago when visiting a friend in Germany. Humble & inexpensive, but soooo good.

i used butter to fry the potatoes in, instead of oil, only because it was what i had. i also used some sweet basil to add to it. this dish is wonderful i would use it again.

I made this as a side dish for broiled, herbed salmon, and steamed asparagus. I added minced garlic and freshly ground black pepper, and used coarse sea salt which worked very well. The aroma of this dish will bring the neighbors running!!This was an excellent meal and went suprisingly well with the pinot noir we had been sipping during preparation.

Fried potatoes are always good but I didn't see much difference in this one vs any other. I would give it 2 forks but my boyfriend says 4 so we compromise.

Followed recipe and my husband loved it, I thought potatoes were too moist so the next time I made it I tossed all ingredients together, minus cheese, in a roaster pan, set oven to 425 and cook for about 45 minutes. The dish came out browned and a bit crusty, just the way I like it.

I made this the other night. It's tasty, but I won't make it again. If you can fit 1-1/2 pounds of potatoes and a sliced onion in a 12" skillet and have enough room to decently fry them, then you've got much better skills than I do. The pan was way too crowded and I never got that nice, fried texture to the potatoes.
