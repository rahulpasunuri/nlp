This was pretty good, but kind of bland. I ended up adding a lot of salt, pepper, and hot sauce to make up for it. Honestly, next time I'd add more spices, and double the tomatoes.

I'm a vegetarian, have been for years, and have long made my peace with tofu. There are ways to prepare it without having it taste like, well, nothing. Just throwing it into a dish like this is not one of them. Yuck. I was really disappointed with this dish, because aloo mattar (peas and potatoes) is my favorite dish in Indian restaurants, and I was looking forward to finally being able to make it myself. Alas, this isn't it: even with modifications from other reviewers, it didn't come close (and yes, I also had problems with the potatoes taking much longer to cook). I'll look elsewhere for a better recipe.

Based on the advice of previous reviewers, I made a few changes to the recipe. I substituted 3t garam masala and 1t cumin for the other spices, I used a can of chickpeas instead of the tofu (added at the same time as the potatoes), and I added about 2t fresh grated ginger at the same time as the peas. The result was delicious and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

I thought this dish was very flavorful and easy to make. I would add more liquid to make it "saucier" though. Next time I may add a little tomato sauce or chicken broth.

I have made this recipe a couple of times. I think it is great. Definitely experiment with the recipe though. I've never had a problem with potatoes being undercooked. Just watch the pot and remove from heat when the potatoes are cooked the way you like.

I added 2 tsp. of garam masala and 2 generous Tblsp. of tomato paste. I also substituted one well-rinsed can of chick peas for the tofu and got an easy and delicious channa masala!

Easy but not worth even that effort. The potatoes were undercooked, the seasoning was uninspired, and the whole dish didn't come together.

I was able to make this quick dish with items I had on hand. I didn't have cilantro, but added some fresh-squeezed lemon juice for a little zing. Easy and enjoyable.

Has great potential but does need work. I followed the advice of others and wound up cooking the potatoes longer (20 minutes), adding more spices (curry and garlic), and it was still a bit lacking. I think adding alot more curry and other Indian spices would really help. If I used my father in law's secret blend of African curry spices, it would be an amazing dish.

Not wanting to purchase a bunch of spices (I just moved and my spice cabinet is still sparse), I decided to substitute in 1 tsp. each of curry powder and garam masala for the various spices. It worked pretty well, although the comment about the potatoes taking much longer to cook is completely correct - I ended up giving up and eating slightly undercooked potatoes, but still enjoyed the recipe. Also, it was a large 2 servings - maybe closer to 3, depending on what you serve with it.

I had high hopes for this dish because I love all the ingredients but for some reason it just didn't work. The cooking time was way off as others have mentioned. I eat and cook Indian food often. I found that in this dish the textures were wrong and the spices fought each other instead of complimenting and building on each other. I came very close to dumping this in the trash rather than serve it and will not make it again.

Added the spices as recommended by the chef below and loved the recipe. I was a personal assistant to an Indian film director for several years - using this recipe brought back a lot of memories.

I substituted tempeh instead of tofu (sauteed with some curry powder) and the dish turned out really well...not as spicy as I like, but still quite good!

The previous post calling for the addition of seasonings prior other preparation was right on target. It resulted in a wonderfully aromatic, pleasently flavorful dish which was easy to prepare. As mentioned in other posts, the potatoes did take longer to cook then called for even when chopped into 1/2 inch cubes. To account for this time add a minimum of 20 minutes to the total cook time.

As a chef, I would make this recipe with the addition of more seasonings: toast in oil, being careful not to burn one teaspoon each of tumeric, corriander, black (brown) mustard seeds until the seeds start to pop. Then add a healthy pinch of cardamon, cinnamon, and two pinches of ground cumin. Fresh grated ginger would be a nice addition as well, but ground would be ok. Either a 1/2 inch cube of fresh or 1/4 t. ground. Be sure to toast seasoning in oil or ghee or it will burp up long after the meal is over. Panir instead of tofu is nice in this dish too, but sautee cubed panir first and gently stir in last as it is quite tender.

I was extremely disappointed with this recipe. It was a waste of good tofu.

I agree with James about the cooking time, but we didn't like it as much, and probably won't make it again.

My wife and I loved this dish. It is a little bland for Indian.... Try adding some curry paste. Also, cooking time on this is way off, you need at least an extra 15mins to get the potatos done.
