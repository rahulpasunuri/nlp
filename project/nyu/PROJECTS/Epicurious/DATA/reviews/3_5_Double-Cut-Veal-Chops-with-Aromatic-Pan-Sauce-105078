I made this with a 1.5" veal shoulder chop, so it didn't take as long to cook. I also added a boullion cube and half red wine and half water for the chicken stock. The sauce is especially good with a nice brown color and great flavor.

This was easy to make and delicious. To the recipe I added more garlic, which we love, and some diced tomatoes that I had around. To the meal I added home-made potato slices, cut thin and fried, salad, and sliced fresh fruit for dessert. the veal was tender and made a very nice "every day meal" w/ little work.

I was expecting a lot more from this dish. I think the preparation is good for a tough cut of meat -- not for a succulent, tender veal chop. The natural veal flavors were a obscured by the aromatics.

I made this sauce recipe with a Mushroom-Stuffed Veal Chop recipe from Cooking Light. This sauce is fabulous. It saved the expensive veal chops from being a dry disaster.

This is, as my boyfriend put it, a "sick" dish. So flavorful, so impressive and relatively easy to prepare with minimal mess. Be careful not to overcook - the chops I used were about .70 lb ea -cooked for 15 min after the last flip not the suggested 25 minutes. This was really wonderful.

Excellent! The sauce is what does it for me--it really transforms otherwise ho-hum meat. Go for the garlic, it really adds.

I didn't use the garlis(although I would have loved to) because my husband has trouble with garlic, and I used beef broth because I was out of chicken broth, and it was still delicious. Also added mushrooms to the vegetables. So easy!!

This was very tasty - the sauce is flavorful, and the meat juicy. A winner.
