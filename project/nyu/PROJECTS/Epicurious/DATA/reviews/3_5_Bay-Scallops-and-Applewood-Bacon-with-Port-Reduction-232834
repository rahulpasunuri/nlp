Though I found wrapping the scallops a bit too labor intensive to include this recipe in the 'quick & easy' section, it is one of the best scallop dishes I've ever prepared. This one is going into the family cookbook.

This went over really, really well. I shared a sample with some friends who run a successful restaurant and they commended the port reduction sauce. That said, 2 little 'ole mint leaves are not enough! Having lots of mint in the garden, I used about 4 or 5 medium/large leaves and still had trouble tasting the mint when the reduction was finished.

Sauce is way, way to sweet. If I were to try this again I'd scale back on the sugar significantly.

I made this recipe for a home-cooked dinner date and it was perfect! The port wine reduction is sweet, and it balances the salty flavor of the scallops & bacon. The scallops were even great without the salt & pepper. Assembly was a little challenging, as the bacon was curly (and a little overcooked, accidentally). I would suggest using a bacon press. I served it with my mom's garlic bread and Paula Deen's creamed spinach recipe (from Food Network). This is relatively easy and has a great result!

Made this receipt for Christmas eve as an app it was incredible. I would agree it takes longer to cook down but well worth every minute.

Fantastic. Perfect appetizer for our Holiday party this year. The reduction sauce is great, and took a bit longer to cook down. This was enough for about 3-4 people, if only providing one or two appetizers.

I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted great. I had never made a port reduction before, and I thought the flavor was outstanding.

It was delicious, but the port was extremely sweet. I think next time I would try cutting the sugar in half. I tried it over rice as a main dish, which was a bit heavy. As an hors d'oeuvre, the way it was intended, it would be fantastic.

This is really good! I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased. Quite filling but a quick, delicious treat.

Yuck...I followed this recipe to a T and thought it was terrible...sweet scallops in a SICKLY sweet sauce. Nothing worse than seafood dessert! I honestly can't imagine what everyone sees in it.

Still haven't made this with scallops yet, but the port reduction in this recipe is excellent with filet mignon.

We made this twice already whilst in Norway, and it is fantastic!!! The second time we added a small amount of Pernod, and a pinch of Old Bay Seasoning to the Port Reduction and it was absolutely fantastic!!! The sauce blends perfectly with the scallops, it is a huge success

The second time I made this dish I used a very good port which was a vast improvement over a cheaper port used the first time. This has become a favorite served with plain white rice and steamed broccoli drizzled with a little white truffle oil.

the reduction is just delicious! very sweet, but complements the bacon nicely. served with risotto and spinach salad.

I don't know... the Port Reduction tasted like liquid grape jelly... Too sweet! Perhaps I did something wrong. Nonetheless, the scallops were great alone (that is with the seasoning and wrapped meat (we used proscuitto instead of bacon)). Will definitely make the scallops again but might consider another reduction if any!

Wonderful recipe! Sea scallops worked well. The flavors from the Port wine reduction sauce are so fabulously complex that the recipe is worth saving for other dishes!

I know this is supposed to be an appetizer, but at our home, it is an entree item! What glorious flavors!

This dish is fantastic!!! The port reduction takes this from plain old bacon wrapped scallops to something classy and very delicious! Made this for my husband's birthday dinner. He was calling the meal a success after the appetizer. Next time I'll use a better quality port now that I know how good this is.

I made this for my girlfriend, and she was extremely impressed. The the sauce was delicious, but couldn't taste the mint. We also used some port we had left over, and even though it was a pricey port, it was worth it. I also used large sea scallops simply because the bay scallops I could find were way too small. Also, the applewood smoked bacon I used was really thick, so even though it added a great flavor, it was slightly difficult to cut. In the end though, we loved this dish. The scallops, bacon, and port wine sauce was a perfect combination. For sides, I baked a butternut squash with cinnamon, nutmeg, and butter... and quickly stir-fried some sugarsnap peas with butter and soy sauce until slightly tender but still crispy.

Have made this twice and was fantastic both times. I baked the scallops and bacon instead of frying it. The sauce is divine - added more mint the second time.
