Every time I make this recipe, every single person who's tasted it has said, "Best Biscotti Eva!" and refuses to let me change a thing. Nuff said.

My husband is the oficial biscotti baker at Christmas. A long tradition for us with our usual favs. He made this recipe for me after I stubled upon it searching for Christmas ideas. This is the BEST biscotti recipe and the cookies are the best I've ever tasted. We skipped the GM and used good quality orange extract and dark chocolate. Will be making this again for sure!

I have made this biscotti to give away as Christmas gifts for the past 5 years and it is always a huge hit! I have friends that ask for these biscotti. The grated orange peel with the Grand Marnier give them a great flavor! Awesome recipe.

Made this and the Pistachio, Raspberry, and White Chocolate Biscotti for a Foodies Italian dinner a few weeks ago and still getting requests for the recipe. It was very easy and a huge hit! Used 3 eggs instead of 2 and added little drizzle of orange oil for extra orange flavor. Cut pecans and chocolate in very small pieces to avoid crumbling when cutting. Used a very sharp bread knife and the log cut very easily. Great base recipe!

This biscotti is the BOMB! Consistently delicious and easy, there is no better treat for a casual afternoon of sweets snacking and coffee drinking. These tasty treats are also perfect for care packages as they keep exceptionally well in the mail. One thing I've noticed is that it is better to err on the side of undercooking the logs (by about five minutes each round) or they will come out very hard and crumbly; go based on color - taking them out when they are still very light the first round will ensure that they end up ideally crunchy with a beautiful golden color.

Wonderful biscotti. My only suggestion is to use a little less chocolate because I found that if I had used the full amount the chocolate would overpower every aspect of the biscotti. But if you are going for a dessert biscotti than the chocolate can't hurt. I also think it can't hurt to add more orange zest.

Great biscotti! I didn't have any orange oil on hand, so I used 2 T of frozen orange juice concentrate. I learned this trick from a recipe for cheesecake that I have and it's the perfect flavor of orange. The chocolate orange combination is perfect!

light and delicious with a nice hint of orange. a christmas staple.

Yowzers, this recipe friggen rocks. Easy too. I took the advise of another before baking and used ORANGE EXTRACT, didnt bother with zest, and used twice as much. Safeway has it for $4 a bottle. Orange flavor is right there with the rich Ghiradelli chocolate chips I used (chopped). ROCKS!

I am re-doing a previous review of this recipe. As long as you don't expect ORANGE it is quite delicious. I followed it by using the bar of chocolate rather than the chips I tried last time. I still put in more orange zest but unless you buy the $$ oil of orange - you really can't taste orange. I don't recommend upping the orange liquor either. I'm giving it a 3 for because of the lack of orange taste in the recipe as written. I'm keeping the recipe though.

Made this last night after looking at the recipe for a few years. I have to say I was not "thrilled". Its good but not what I anticipated. There is no orange flavor - I even doubled the orange zest. I suppose 3 Tbl of Zest & 3 of the orange liquor might help but I have a feeling not. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet choc chips instead of chunking up chocolate & that worked out ok but I would recommend using the chocolate according to the recipe - distribution of chocolate would be better. The biscotti did crumble a bit during the cut but not as bad as one reader had it happen - they made good crumbles under ice cream.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times and the key to getting a distinct orange flavor is not additional Grand Marnier or even more grated rind, but getting yourself some orange oil, which commercial bakers use. It makes a world of difference. Only a small amount is needed and it is NOT one-for-one with the Grand Marnier. Use to taste. This is a great recipe especially if you're a fan of the chocoate-orange combo, which I am. It also lends itself very well to substitutions. Using quality chocolate cannot be stressed enough. Love these!

Found this recipe and made the biscotti, for the first time, to bring to a dinner party. Brought it with the Spiced Fresh Orange & Honey Sorbet, also from this site (yummy), and a dark chocolate gelato (home made too). The biscotti was wonderful - the flavor of the orange is evident but subtle and the recipe is easy to follow. No problems, as others have had, with crumbing. Rave reviews for the biscotti from the other guests.

My first time making biscotti. Six of us all found it excellent. When our close friends left they asked to take some home, and one has Italian roots and knows his biscotti. A great combination of orange and chocolate and not super hard.

Rating: 2
Flavor was lovely; I did add more orange zest and thought the balance between cookie/orange/chocolate was great. I did have to cook them about 10 min longer than called for. The problem I had was, they just crumbled when I cut them. I let them cool longer (I first cut them after the recommended time), but that didn't help. And the "cracks" in the surface became fault lines. I think I got maybe 6 whole cookies, the rest were shambles. Don't know what I did wrong, thought I followed the recipe to the letter aside from the things mentioned, but obviously did something because everyone else seems to have had great success.

This was my first attempt at biscotti; I had never even tasted it before. I was a little concerned that the dough seemed very soft even after being in the freezer, but I stuck with it and was glad I did. The biscotti were light, crunchy and subtly imbued with a hint of orange. I followed the recipe as written, but may follow other suggestions to add more orange zest. This is a keeper either way.

I've spent most of the day making several batches of these. First time through, I made exactly as written and they were just fine. Second and third batches I grated the orange peel a little more coarsely and put a little more in. I like the combo of the orange with the dark chocolate and it got even better. The final batch, I used macadmaia nuts and those are really yummy, too. My favorite recipes are those with a good, solid base that give lots of wiggle room for change. This one is a keeper.

Very good...added some candied orange peel as well.

I too, want to give this recipe 3.5 forks! I used 3 tbspoons of fresh orange juice since i did not have any Grand Marnier and 3 tbspoons of orange zest. When making this recipe, i thought there was way to much chocolate, but after baking it, i have to admit that it was perfect, and my chocolate lover fiance was simply amazed. I also used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour and it turned out great. With a nice expresso lungo, those biscotti are even more delicious.

Rating: 3
Actually I would like to give this recipe a 3.5 forks. Like few other reviewers, I didn't have grand marnier handy, so I substituted it with juice of 2 navel oranges and 1 tsp of orange extract. Also, used zest from 3 oranges...because i absolutely love citrus flavors and chocolate w/ orange happens to be my favorite choc/fruit combo. I love that the biscotti has just a hint of sweetness and it is complimented very nicely by the orange and choc. Last but not least, I too used walnuts since those were the only nuts i had on hand. Will definitely make again

These are beautiful, easy, and impressive! I added much more orange peel...I think the zest of 3 pretty large oranges. I also increased the alcohol to 3 TBSPs. Keeper of a recipe! Smells SO good baking!

I made this w/out the orange peel and did not refrigerate the dough. That said, these biscotti are fabulous. The firmness and the texture are perfect! I am going to use this as a base recipe and try all kinds of add- ins (dried cranberries, almonds...) Yum!

Very good, my first attempt at biscotti and they turned out really well. Following the earlier suggestion I increased the cointreau to 3tbsp (more liqueur is always a good thing).

Rating: 4
I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 3 tbsp of liquor (cointreau), and the zest of two whole oranges (done on a microplane, which gets a whole lot of zest!). I also used couverture rounds and was sorry I didn't choip them down further. Next time I'll do that or even use chips. It's a fatastic recipe, though. I'll definitely make it again and again.

I'm a huge fan of chocolate and orange...yet these biscotti didn't quite work for me. They were pleasantly crispy, with good texture for dipping, but the orange flavor wasn't strong enough despite doubling both the GM and the zest. I'd recommend that people even triple the zest if they want strong flavor. note: for super-crispy cookies, increase the cooking temp and decrease the duration. 400 degrees worked well. Also, I used walnuts rather than pecans, which was nice with the chocolate.

Rating: 4
I agree with others. This recipe is delicious! Here's what I also agree with based on other recommendations: add MORE orange zest and MORE Grande Marnier, BAKE longer first time for total 40 minutes and SECOND TIME for total 15 minutes EACH SIDE (i have a gas stove, so that may be the difference). My biscotti were crispy and light- perfect with orange tea or bourbon and egg nog!

Rating: 4
Easy, excellent recipe. If you want a crisper cookie, extend the first baking time to 40 minutes as another baker mentioned. Nice subtle flavor as is, but think I might up the orange peel the next time around. Recipe doubles easily too. I was able to cook a double batch in a single oven by rotating the cookie sheets half way through (I have a funky old oven.)

Rating: 4
Delicious. I didn't read any of the reviews before I made it, but I found them to be crispy and yet not the tooth-breakers I sometimes find biscotti to be. Lovely orange scent and flavor. Because I wasn't in the mood to chop chocolate, I simply mixed in small chips at the end. Delish. I'm perplexed as to why these didn't work for some people. I fed them to dinner guests two nights running and they polished them off. Oh, and I just whacked them into logs with the heel of my hand after they were cold. Probably would have made sense to do it while they were still warm.

Rating: 3
The end product was very good, though I had lots of problems getting there-chopping the chocolate almost burned out my Cuisnart (did it by hand after that) and I doubled the recipe, which was just too much for my Kitchenaid. I subbed hazelnuts for the pecans-for some reason, pecans seems like an odd match to the choc orange flavors-and liked the results immensely. The ginger biscotti and the pistachio cranberry ones on this site are still my favorites, but these are very good.

Rating: 4
Have made these a few times...they're easy and excellent. Re-read some of the comments...will add my own. First. I agree that you can definitely add more orange zest if you want more orange flavor. Second, 30 minutes on the first baking doesn't seem to be enough -- I do close to 40. All of the other comments regarding substitutions are right on...it's a very adaptable recipe and you can really be creative if you'd like.

i am actually making this a second time, because i made them and they went so fast not everyone got to try!! i didnt have grand marinier (sp?) so i added a little bit of rum and vanilla extract....also i baked it a good 10 minutes longer to get the biscotti crunch.

Didn't change a thing and got rave reviews...will definitely be making these often...better than anything storebought for sure.

Wow-the ratings on this go from one end to the other! I (and all of my guests) thought this was the best biscotti ever. I used orange juice instead of Grand Marnier just because I didn't have the latter, and used a naval orange. Also, I found that I needed to bake the slices for quite a bit longer than the recipe called for in order to get the desired color, crispness, and dryness. We all enjoyed the way the orange flavor complemented the chocolate-subtle and not overpowering. I must say the smell in the kitchen from start to finish was worth everything!!

I didn't care for this recipe. I've been making biscotti for years, but I rarely, if ever, put butter in my biscotti. Butter makes them too crispy and airy, in my opinion, which is what happened with this recipe. I prefer my biscotti dense and crunchy. (Maria Robbins has a fabulous biscotti cookbook that I live by - she doesn't add butter or oil to her recipes, and they are divine, and low fat!) I also didn't care for the orange/chocolate combination as much as I hoped I would. The only thing I did like about this recipe was the light orange aroma while they were baking.

Rating: 3
They are very good, however, there is a lack of orange flavor. It's there, it's just very subtle. On my second and third baking I added more orange zest and Grand Marnier but it just didn't seem to "kick-up" the orange flavor. To make a wonderful and simple 4-forker dessert I add a piece or two of biscottii to peach or orange sorbet, drizzle a couple of tablespoons of good esspresso, a drizzle of Grand Marnier and a bit of marscapone cheese on top. If anyone figures out how to make it orangier let me know.

Always thought that Biscotti would be so difficult to make. Much to my surprise they were quite simple. I did not add the chocolate to the mix, better yet - I set it aside, melted it, and dipped half of my cookies in it to give them a neat retro look. They were great!

I doubled the recipe and added some extra orange zest (in total about 4 Tbsp) I also used semisweet chocolate chips instead of chopped chocolate. If you do decide to double use less than 12oz chips they tend to clump together- Recipe was good but I'm not really the worlds biggest Orange-chocolate fan.

Just as well I didn't read the previous two reviews or I would not have attempted this recipe this weekend. My results were fabulous - only substituted almonds for pecans, otherwise I followed the recipe as presented. Try rolling the dough while still wrapped in the plastic wrap - much easier to control. The type of orange that you choose is important.I used one of the beautiful large mandarin oranges that are available right now.

Yuck, yuck, and double yuck. No orange flavor to this at all, despite following the recipe exactly. How very disappointing, especially after all the wonderful reviews. Worse than the cheapest store-bought chocolate chip cookie. What a waste of really fine ingredients. :-(

Blecchhh. How very disappointing. I followed the recipe to the letter, and not only couldn't taste any orange at all, it made the rest of the cookie VERY bland - worse than a store-bought chocolate chip cookie. Yuck. :-(

I liked this recipe. First time making biscotti, and I was surprised how easy it was. Couple comments: I used dried cranberries instead of choc chips and then dipped them in melted chocolate. Made them look very festive! Also, I think I would prefer almonds to pecans. And, the dough was pretty sticky, so it's a good idea to wet your hands before forming the logs. Enjoy!

Don't even bother just making one batch, you will need to double the recipe because they are so good!! I used walnuts instead of pecans, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I had planned on giving them away with Christmas gifts, but I don't know how many of them will make it! Excellent biscotti!

Great biscotti--very light, but not too crumbly. I had to substitute orange juice for the orange liqueur, but it still tasted fine. Don't put the biscotti logs too close together, for the initial bake, as they will spread quite a bit.

Wonderful biscotti! I omitted the nuts and used dark-chocolate-covered raisins instead of chopped chocolate (requested by my sweetheart, for whom these were a gift) and didn't skimp on the orange zest. They took a little longer than indicated for the second baking, but they turned out crisp and tasty. This is a very good "base" recipe that would adapt well to other additions/substitutions.

Nice orange flavor. I omitted the nuts and kind of regretted it -- next time I'll use almonds and may spike the batte with a bit of almond extract as well (the orange is a bit one-dimensional). I will also dip them in chocolate next time. But overall a great recipe. Followed carefully and had no problem with spreading or crumbling.

This was my first time I have tried this particular recipe, although I have made several other types of biscotti. I thought the flavor was wonderful, but the dough really flattened and spread out during the first baking. I don't know what I did, but the only thing I changed about the recipe was the addition of some candied orange peel I happened to have on hand and I substituted chocolate chips for chopped chocolate. Mine didn't look like the picture but they tasted great!

I've made this recipe 3 times now. My advice is to follow the recipe--I learned the hard way that MORE chocolate and MORE nuts do not make it better--it makes it fall apart when you try to cut it up. Fantastic biscotti recipe and they make a great gift.

These had a better texture than some other biscotti, not rock-hard like many. Used Triple Sec because I didn't have Grand Marnier and used a Ghirardelli baking chocolate bar which is only 4 oz., not 6. Still, the recipe was easy and everyone agreed they were wonderful!

An excellent biscotti recipe!!! One of the best we've ever tasted -- I actually got a rare request from my finicky mom to make them again for her and my dad! (Only change: I omitted the orange peel because I didn't have an orange.)
