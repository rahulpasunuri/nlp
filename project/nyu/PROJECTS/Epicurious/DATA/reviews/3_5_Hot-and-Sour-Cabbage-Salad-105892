Delicious and so easy to make. I usually add some toasted sesame seeds for crunch and flavor. Sometimes also add a bit of lemon juice.

We liked this recipe as a base for scrod sauteed in EVOO sprinkled with pepper and seasoned salt and topped with additional scallion. More exotic seasoning for the fish is unnecessary. Also microwaved the dressing for a minute. Easy and quick.

I cook far more than I review but I really depend on the reviews of others so I thought it was my turn. This dish is extremely simple but I though it was deserving of more forks than 3. For those who were not as happy, hopefully no bottled ginger was involved. If you love crunchy, sweet and spicy, this dish is for you. It goes great with the skirt steak on the menu.

Simple and tasty. Can be prepped ahead of time and dressed just before serving. This is a perfect salad to accompany grilled entrees. It can be dressed while the grilled meat rests before serving.

Perfect exactly as is! The only thing I did differently was used a couple of shakes of ground cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes (didn't have flakes on hand). Fresh and delicious, and oh so gingery!

The sesame oil and lime juice helped, but didn't completely make the dish. I liked the textures, but it still needed something... crunchy Chinese noodles? More sugar? ??

This was great and certainly not boring. Quick, easy to prepare. We love it with or without the cilantro

Absolutely delicious! Very easy to prepare and the flavors are wonderful. The ginger is the key. I added sesame oil as suggested. What's not to like?

We weren't impressed... we made this w/ a few changes, didn't have fresh ginger so used 1/2 the amount of powdered sugar, just 1/2 of the amount of chili flakes and overall it was just a little "ehh".

We absolutely loved this! It was so easy to make and the flavors were outstanding. The addition of a tsp. of sesame oil before serving brought this from a 3 to a four.

I found this recipe to be alright but too gingery. If I made it again, instead just dumping in the minced ginger, I would squeeze out the juice and use that. I would also add 1 Tbsp of sake to the dressing mix, as this has a way of mellowing out the flavors and bringing them together

I made this recipe as written, and it did need a bit more of both rice vinegar and sugar. Added a healthy sprinkle of Maggi bottled hot chile sauce to the dressing. To add a bit more flavor, I sprinkled the salad with bacon flavored chips just before serving.

I added 1 tablespoon of sugar rather than the teaspoon of sugar, juice of 1/2 lime, and a clove of garlic. This was served with Tempura Fish and it was fabulous. The mild fish with the sweet/hot/tart salad was perfect. (think fish and chips with malt vinager).

I Changed the salad by adding 1 bunch of celantro, chopped. For the dressing, I used 2 Tbs sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp hot chili oil, red pepper flakes to taste, and 1/4 to 1/3 c. salad oil. Shook well in a jar then poured over salad and mixed well. Everyone loved it!!!

It is simple but rather boring as written. But after I drizzled a little sesame oil on it, the whole family went crazy - none was left! Adding a few teaspoons to the entire dish will make a world of difference.

i didn't think that the dressing would be enough for the quantity of cabbage, but it was just right. the combination of flavors was excellent. someone said that the salad was dry and too spicy? i didn't have that problem. i made this along with coriander teriyaki flank steak. the flavors were a great compliment to each other.

I added 1/4 cup of julienned cilantro to the cabbage. Increased the vinegar to 1/2 cup and used two teaspoons of raw sugar. Simmered for 30 minutes to blend flavors. My husband loved it.

This recipe was a delicious surprise! Very strong flavors overcome the natural old-socks bouquet of cabbage, and the spiciness of the red pepper is a surprise in an otherwise cold side dish! Fun! Fun! Fun! Very good with Coriander-Teriyaki Steak and plain steamed rice. Yummy!

Excellent and easy.

I served this salad with Teriyaki beef (sauce not too sweet) and rice. Big hit with my family, especially my husband who is not overly adventurous. Said it was better than coleslaw. I let the dressing steep a bit on low heat and thought the flavors were perfect. Great no fat salad.

Not a hit in our house. I halved the cabbage for the 2 of us and used 3 scallions. I made the full recipe of dressing and it still left the cabbage too dry. Also, the dressing is VERY spicy and will overpower all but the strongest flavors. I made it as an accompaniment to the Coriander Teriyaki Flank Steak.

Good for a change, but needed more rice vinegar than recipie calls for just 10 ounces of cabbage.
