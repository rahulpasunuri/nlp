This is a great recipe! I use it as a base for many variations. 1 extra egg and a little more cream. I also add extra feta, sauté some onion and asparagus w the pepper and use a store bought crust. Yummy!

I have made this recipe for years and years, possibly since it first was published. First, in a little European cafe, and then for friends and family, and most recently in another bakery/cafe. Everywhere I have made it, people have loved it. We couldn't make it fast enough at the bakery/cafe, where we made it in a quiche pan, without the crust. Oftentimes I would use roasted red peppers from a jar to save time, and the results were still great. I am hosting a baby shower this weekend...and here I am again, back to this recipe!

I actually made this recipe, not adjusting it to make it something else. It is nominally ok, but I won't be making it again. I have other recipes which are better. I tried it as I thought feta would be interesting, which it was. Beyond that, nothing tasted that amazing or stood out.

I added an extra egg and a bit more creme and tons more feta and it was awesome. I would double the spinach and peppers next time bc it was WAY too thin. I understand it's not meant to be super thick, still. The combo of flavors was GREAT though.

I have made this recipe at least two times for my friends and they loved it. I have not tried making the crust as of yet--I follow our family recipe and freeze the second crust--so I cannot rate that. Most recently, I added a grilled bratwurst and it was even better (obviously not a choice if you're going for vegetarian). Never have I seen a quiche recipe with feta before, but definitely a keeper.

In my opinion, there seems to be a misunderstanding about what this recipe is supposed to produce. Many have said that there is not enough dough to cover a 9" pie plate, or not enough filling. Other than sauteing some onions before the bell pepper, I followed the recipe exactly and discovered that there is no mistake. The dough covers the bottom and SOME of the sides of a 9" pie plate. This is not a problem, as you will see. The egg/milk mix is enough to lightly cover the spinach/peppers, but not entirely cover them. So this makes a thinner, lighter quiche than I think many are accustomed to. Note that the recipe says it only serves two; not four as you might expect of a larger quiche. I don't think there's anything wrong with the recipe's quantities. I think it's just a question of expectations and what we're used to.

Well I listened to everyones reviews and did the following-doubled the cream mixture, added sauteed onions and thyme and oregano to the spinach, pepper onion mixture. I salt and peppered everything well and i doubled the amount of feta. Used store bought crust which was really fine. I only gave it two stars because frankly I did not follow this recipe at all! it was a good base to work from and I think you can be creative with your fillings!

Important Note: I used a different crust recipe. After reading some of the comments from you fine folk (thank you very much!), I decided to go with a different crust and it paid off in a huge way. I found an appealingly simple crust recipe at cooks.com (http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,191,141188 -232200,00.html) and went for it. The recipe called for: 1 c. whole wheat flour 2/3 c. shredded cheese 1/4 c. chopped almonds 1/2 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. paprika 6 tbsp. corn oil and the directions were simply to combine the ingredients and press into a pie plate and bake for 10 min at 400 degrees. It never said what kind of cheese to use, so I went with provolone (I figured it would melt well and be mild enough that it couldn't mess things up too badly). I pressed it into my 9" pie plate and up the sides and threw it in the oven. When it came out it looked like a big graham cracker, lovely golden brown. I added the filling as per this recipe - except that I added more feta in order to have a layer over the entire bottom of the quiche - and put it back in the oven for the cooking times and temperatures given in this recipe. I was a little concerned because the top of the crust started to burn but in the interest of having fully cooked eggs, I just went with it (next time I will try to solve this problem by not having the crust climb up the sides of the pie plate as high, but the burnt part tasted fine, so it didn't even matter). The result was fabulous. My guests loved it and I can't wait to make it again!

I exchanged tomato for the red pepper and sauteed the spinach the night before. I was able to assemble the quiche quickly in the morning, when time is tight.

this was super easy compared to my standard quiche recipe. I added crumbled sausage too (6, sweet, italian, casings removed) just on top of the feta and before the spinach and red pepper. yummy and a great way to use crumbled feta that was on sale plus a coupon at stop & Shop!

Its a mystery why people found it necessary to modify every aspect of this recipe and still gave it a high rating. Everyone tweaks the ingredients to their taste - adding onions, different flavourings, etc. What I am looking for is a good basic recipe - I can figure out whether to add some nutmeg. I have to admit that after I started making it, I couldn't imagine only 1/3 cup of milk. More like scrambled eggs than custard. I used 3 eggs and 1 1/3 cups milk and it turned out pretty much the way I wanted. Other than that, I know what vegetables and flavourings I want to add. Useless recipe.

I bought a crust and found that the filling didn't quite fill the crust, so next time I will double the filling. We made this as part of a break fast after Yom Kippur and liked the taste.

BUY the crust. The crust portion of the recipe is flawed. Kalamata olives also perked it up a bit!

As previous reviewers stated, I added sauteed onions and garlic. I also threw in some sun-dried tomatoes that added a little zing to the quiche. I happened to chop up the spinach (chiffonade?) so that it'd be easier for guests to eat. And only because I personally like cheese, I sprinkled the remaining feta that I had on top. Note: I didn't make my own crust, but thought the filling amount was appropriate for the store-bought shells. Easy to double, and both quiches went very quickly at brunch.

I love this quiche! I used a frozen whole wheat organic crust...doubled egg & cream as advised, also added onion and garlic. Cooked 40 Minutes...it's delicious!!

I doubled everything as per the other reviews and it made the perfect amount. The crust, I noticed, when cooled, tended to taste rather shortening-y which I didn't like. Next time I will make it with the crust from the Arugula & Bacon Quiche as was suggested. Guests enjoyed it, but it tasted moderately flavorless to me. Next time I'll jazz it up.

Rating: 4
This is great....but like other reviewers have noted, the crust should be doubled to fill a 9 inch tart pan and the filling increased as well. A chopped and sauteed onion makes the filling even better. Cooking time was correct for me, which makes this meal perfect for weeknights.

I made this last night...wow. Thanks to everyone for all of the great tips! I too, sauteed garlic and onion with the spinach. I replaced the red pepper with sun- dried tomatoes and canned artichokes. Incredible flavors. Also doubled egg and cream amounts and cooked for 40 minutes. The easiest thing ever!

For a quick and healthy breakfast, I have modified as such: omit the dough portion altogether, double the other ingredients, and stir in 2 or so tbsp flour. Then bake in a greased (or sprayed) glass pie dish for 25 minutes or until it's set in a 350 degree oven. It serves about 4 people, looks beautiful and is a great way to use up extra spinach or peppers and eat vegetables for breakfast.

Rating: 4
I took the advise from the reviews...I sauted some minced onions and garlic in butter before adding a handful of mushrooms. When the mushrooms were done I added the fresh spinach and stirred until wilted. I added salt and pepper. I used 3 eggs and 1/2 cup heavy cream. I didn't have time to make the dough so I used pre-made croissant roll dough that i just unrolled and put into a pie dish. I baked the dough for 5 minutes before adding the mix (dough is quick cooking). I must say it turned out perfect. WOW. The crust was light and the flavors were excellent. I went back and quickly wrote down all my adjustments so I can make it the same way again. What a great dish...cant say enough.

Rating: 3
This is a great basic recipe for quiche however the crust wasn't flaky enough for my liking. Use the crust recipe from the Argula and Bacon quiche recipe if you want a flaky and tender crust. Also, double the egg/cream quantities, as well as add garlic to the spinach and pepper sautee. I also added a 1/4 ts. of sherry vinegar and some zaa'tar (or some thyme and oregano) to the mixture to give it more flavor. Adding thyme to the egg/cream mixture, and you'll have a great quiche with alot of Mediterranean flavor.

Skipped the crust because I wanted a healthier vegetarian version and added sauteed portebello mushrooms, leeks and garlic to the dish. Also doubled the eggs (2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites) and used 1/3 cup half and half and 1/3 cup lowfat milk as well as substituted goat cheese for the feta. Cooked at 350 degrees for 30 mins. and voila - a great light lunch/dinner meal that was a big hit with my discriminating teenagers.

I made this for Christmas morning, the day before and reheated in the morning. It was delicious and festive red and green. I used frozen spinach and microwaved it for 2 minutes before sauteeing it with the red peppers. I also added sweet onions and garlic to the sautee. I used guyere cheese and egg beaters for 6 eggs and 3/4c non-fat half-and-half. I also used pilsbury crust from the refrigerator section. It turned out so light and fluffy and delicious. It took 40 minutes to cook(and I forgot to lower the temperature) and I reheated it the next day for 20 minutes at 350. Still, it was wonderful!

Rating: 4
Very yummy, I couldn't help going back for seconds! The feta makes the dish. You definitely need to double the eggs and cream, and it's also good to add a little more bell pepper, if you are using an 8-9 inch pie dish. I also highly recommend sauteeing some garlic and onion or shallot with the bell pepper. Mine took a little longer than prescribed to cook the crust, but the quiche itself cooked in the prescribed time.

I tried this out to serve at a brunch I'm catering. I was very pleased with the cream & egg ratio; the results were light and airy. I always follow a recipe exacly at first, and this one called for very little spices. I found the veggies to be a bit bland. I modified the second trial and added garlic and onions to the spinach and a little cavender's seasoning (my family spice-all). MUCH BETTER the second time around.

Rating: 4
This is by far the best baking procedure and egg/cream ratio that I have ever encountered. I also had to double the amounts. The custard part of the quiche was the lightest and fluffiest that I have ever tasted. I changed the filling, and made 2 different quiches with it: one with chicken, asparagus, and gruyere and the other with bacon, spinach, and feta. It was outstanding with both. The only reason I picked this recipe was because of the shorter baking time than many quiches (it was a hot, hot summer day) and I'm so glad i did! A keeper for sure.

I needed a larger quiche, so I had to double the egg and dairy and more dough. I substituted heavy cream for half and half since that was what I had but otherwise stuck to the other ingredients and it was a MARVELOUS recipe that got rave reviews.

Used this as the basis of my first quiche, and was quite happy with the results. I changed many of the ingredients: Swiss chard instead of spinach; a combination of cheddar and parmesan instead of feta; included the red pepper; added one leek, chopped. Next time will add something to give it a kick, perhaps some cayenne or dried red pepper and will make twice the amount of everything to make a bigger quiche!

I loved this recipe but couldn't resist experimenting. I added 2 slices of crisp bacon bits (small bits) and 1/2 cup of soft manchego cheese to the feta. If using a 9 inch pie pan increase the ingredients by 25% and cook slightly longer. Marvelous results! Don't miss this one!

I did what other cooks suggested and doubled the cream and eggs. I would also double the pastry and make it in a slightly larger dish. I sauteed onions with the red pepper and added more feta cheese. For Australian cooks, this serves 4 not the standard US 2. I served this dish with steamed brocolli, carrots, asparagus and brown rice with cranberries, pine nuts and toasted almonds. This is a refreshing meal and please make the pastry it takes no more than 5 minutes and really is worth it. Next time I think I will add the asparagus to the actual dish.

This is my new favorite recipe! I've made it to bring to 2 different brunches, I've made it for dinner, and I actually made it for myself one Saturday morning, since it's so easy.

This was my first experience making quiche, and I was surprised how easy it is. My husband is lactose intolerant, so I used yogurt instead of cream - it has an enzyme that eats lactose, and it also adds a bit to the taste. I also put oregano in the crust to liven it up a little. Yummy!

This quiche was excellent. I have to admit I took some liberties with the recipe, however. I was looking for a spinach quiche recipe and didn't really want to use the red peppers, so I left them out. As per previous reviewers suggestions, I doubled the custard and used about 1 cup of feta. I also sauted some shallots (about 1/3 cup) with the spinach, and put some sliced roma tomatoes on top about halfway through the baking. I used a store-bought crust, as well. Kudos to the cooks who make their own, but this is incredibly fast and simple--and yummy--using premade crust.

I made this for a ladies brunch and it was claimed to be the best quiche a couple of the ladies had ever had. I agree with previous reviews to double the egg/ cream mixture, and to be generous with the feta. I second that the crust is SUPER easy--why BUY premade when you surely have flour & butter laying around? I used a blender instead of a food processor and it still turned out great-- I would suggest increasing (maybe double) the crust portions. I also added sauteed red onion, and oregano to the veggies. Voila!

This was very good with the addition of a generous sprinkling of sliced kalamatas (over a full cup of good quality feta at bottom of shell), 1/3 cup each red and yellow peppers sauteed in garlic olive oil, and double the filling ingredients (4 eggs, almost a cup of half-n-half). Served with a bacon quiche as part of a shower buffet and it was gobbled up. Will definitely make again.

This is a terrific recipe. Really really easy and delicious. I've made it many times with great success. I've also substituted Swiss chard for the spinach -- easier to prepare the greens and it's delicious this way too. I strongly recommend making the crust as suggested in this recipe. Why go with pre-made when you can have homemade? It's super easy, doesn't even have to be rolled out and tastes great.

I took many of the reviewers suggestions and made this the best quiche I've ever served. My husband is still raving about it. Use pre-made pie crust instead. Sauteed 3 cloves of garlic then added 1/4 cup or so of sundried tomatoes and heated them together before adding the spinach. Used more feta also (tomato/herb) and crumbled that until it covered the bottom of the pie pan then added the garlic/tomato/spinach mixture. Also doubled the egg and cream mixture (used half/half instead). The only problem I encountered was when the crust got too dark. I'll use a foil cover next time. Otherwise, was the highlight of my Easter brunch!

I am going to make for the second time and will increase the feta cheese to 1.2 cup and eggs to 4. It was good, but just lacked something. I like my quiche subtle (not spicy) but am going to add garlic, a dash of red pepper flakes and some olives.

I used a refrigerated pie crust, which worked quite well. However, I agree with many of the other reviewers that the ratios were quite off on this recipe. I used three eggs instead of two, but if I make it again, I would add two more and some more cream. Also, a whole cup of feta seems to work much better than 1/3, and counteracts much of the blandness, as does the salt from some fresh kalamata olives. I also added half a large red onion and two cloves of garlic. It's very colorful and not too eggy.

I've made this quiche several times and everyone who tries it asks for the recipe. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and doubled the eggs and cream. After making this several times with varying amounts of feta, I find that a full 8 ounces is just the right amount. In addition to the red bell pepper I add yellow bell pepper and add a little minced garlic to the oil before sauteing the peppers. Nearly everytime I've served this I made it ahead and reheated it at 375 degrees for 15 minutes (I reheat it alongside some baguettes I serve with it). It reheats thoroughly like a charm. Served with a greek salad, warm baguettes and a chilled white wine and this is HEAVEN.

Really good quiche, with a nice twist of flavor. I used a Pillsbury crust (for the first time) and it was fantastic. I made the quiche in a 9.5" fluted tart pan with removable bottom, and as promised, the presentation was beautiful. I used Trader Joes Fire Roasted red bell peppers and sauteed a handful of slivered red onion first. 4 eggs and 2/3 cup half and half made just the right amount of filling. A pinch of nutmeg and freshly ground pepper with the spinach was a nice suggestion. AND, I used all of a container (almost a cup) of Athenos peppercorn crumbled feta in the bottom. I baked it for slightly longer because of the additional filling and served with a simple salad of romaine, cucumber, tricolored peppers and greek dressing.

Rating: 3
I thought that the proportions were definitely off on this quiche. I used 1.5 times the eggs and cream (i.e. 5 eggs) in order to make this fill my crust to the right level. I think I should have doubled the amount of feta also- I couldn't taste it at all in the final product. That said, this was delicious, and everyone who tried it loved it. I got so many compliments on my Pillsbury crust, I don't think I'll ever make my own crust again!

Yummy and so beautiful! I took advice from other reviewers and doubled the eggs and milk, added carmelized onions before the feta layer, and used the "butter pastry dough" from the Tomato and Onion Tart recipe listed elsewhere on this site.

Everyone at the baby shower gave it rave reviews and there was none left, which I always feel is the biggest compliment! This one's a keeper.

Using previous reviewers suggestions, I made this recipe (in my mad scramble to come up with suitable dishes for an upcoming summertime wedding shower). I wasn't disappointed. For the test I used a prepared pie crust which comes in an aluminum pan, but for the shower I will use the crusts which are in sheets so that I can put it in my own pie plates. Any suggestions for other side dishes? I'm having a fruit salad and muffins. What am I missing (other than dessert which will be cake)? Anyway, I'll definately use this recipe; it's tasty, easy, and forgiving as to subtle changes one can make.

Very nice - my husband loved it almost as much as my Southwestern Quiche (vidalia onion, green chiles, cream style corn, pimentos and jack and cheddar cheeses, served with jalepeno pepper jelly on the side). I used a 10" quiche dish and increased ingredients to 1/2 C Red Bell Pepper, 2 chopped shallots, 3 C spinach leaves, 3 large eggs, 2/3 C cream and 1/2 C Feta cheese (which we felt wasn't enough, and will add 1/4 C more sprinkled on top next time). Only negatives: I pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes and it over-browned in the end, and I added a few chopped Greek Calamata olives and we agreed that they dominated the flavor too much and made it a bit too salty.

Very nice. I didn't want to use a crust because they are so fattening. So, I buttered the pie dish with 1TBSP of margarine and pressed toasted bread crumbs into it. It was great. I also added a little red onion and dried basil to the veggie mixture. More baking time is necessary than is written.

I dobled the recipe and added some garlic as previously mentioned. It was decent but not spectacular. I had 2 other pie shells so I put bacon, mushroom, onion, green pepper, & cheddar in one (a Huge Hit) and onion, mushroon, tomato, & spiced gouda in the other (rated number 2).

Added shrooms and black olives and man did it go! Used extra garlic, herbed feta and doubled eggs/cream mix. Quick and easy.

Looked at all the comments and did the following: Used 1/2 pkg. Pillsbury ready made crust in standard 10 inch quiche pan. Doubled filling ingredients (4 eggs & 2/3 cup cream) with following variations and baked at 350 for 45 min. without prebaking shell. Filling variations: sauteed 1/2 cup onion and 1 heaping tsp minced garlic. Used 10 oz. frozen chopped spinach (defrosted with moisture squeezed out). Sauteed spinach with cooked onion and jarred roasted red peppers, 2 dashes Tabasco until moisture removed, then added 2 tbs. plain dry bread crumbs to remove more moisture. Assembled as in recipe with 2/3 cup feta in bottom, sprinkled 1/3 on top. Was to die for. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This quiche is so quick, colorful and delicious. As other cooks stated, nutmeg is a good addition to the recipe. Next time I'll add a dash of Tabasco or a few red pepper flakes for a little extra kick. Very good as is though.

This is a tasty quiche. I added red onion and black olives with the pepper and spinach.

Yummy, Yummy and so nice and easy! I doubled the recipe and cooked it 10 minutes longer at 350 degrees. I also took the advice of another reviewer and added some nutmeg--a very nice touch. This was really delicious and I will definitely make it again--next time I may try roasting the red peppers rather than sauteing them.

I have made this quiche a few times and it always turns out great! I slice the red pepper cross-ways, into rings, and arrange them on the top, so it looks superb. My book group was totally impressed. I have also made this recipe by blending the cheese thoroughly with the eggs and cream so there is a uniform custard. I layer custard/spinach/custard/peppers. I think this is much better. However, the cheese taste is more dilute so I use a stronger-flavored type of feta.

This recipe has such a wonderful blend of flavors. It is definitely a keeper! I'll add a pinch of nutmeg next time. It came out thinner than a regular quiche. So, I will be doubling all the ingredients next time.

EASY! I would add a little onion next time but other than that it was wonderful.

This was a great, simple recipe. I used egg substitute instead of real eggs and put tomato slices on the quiche when I lowered the oven temperature to add some additional flavor.

This dish really saved me - I started making it about 15 minutes before company arrived, and I still had about 3 1/2 minutes to throw some fruit and cheese on a plate as an appetizer when the doorbell rang. It came out beautifully, though it isn't the most impressive dish I've ever made.

I always hate to read about a recipe that someone rates & totally changes it until today. I made this dish & added chopped roasted chicken & steamed broccoli. I had to double the egg/whipping cream & double the time. It turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

I made this quiche exactly as the recipe dictates, but used a store-bought pie crust. It came out beautifully. This is one good quiche!

Very easy, bright presentation, subtle and rich flavor. Used thawed frozen spinach and it worked well.

Simply marvelous! Used jarred roasted peppers,home oven-roasted Roma tomatoes, toasted cumin seeds, sliced garlic sauteed and then removed in the olive oil, topped with Parmesean Reggiano and fresh cilantro. Just had leftovers for breakfast. Yum Yum Yum!!

This was wonderful. I used a 9-inch pie dish (with a Pillsbury ready made crust) and increased the filling ingredients to fit. I used a rounded 1/2 cup red bell pepper, 1/4 cup minced shallot (only because I had some leftover from another tart I was making), 3 cups packed spinach (torn), rounded 1/2 cup of feta, 2 eggs, 1 cup heavy cream, 2 pinches kosher salt, and I added a sprinkling of grated Parmesan over the top. I did not bother prebaking the crust, but baked the above mixture at 350 for 45 minutes and it came out great. Just thought this info might be useful for anyone wondering how to make this work in a 9-inch pie plate (in case, like me, you don't happen to own a 7-1/2 inch tart pan and can't see the point of buying one as this is the one and only recipe I've ever come across that calls for one.)

This was easy to make and my husband loved it. I added Greek olives to the feta, and he said that made it great. It really is an attractive dish. It is a little small. Great for one or two people. For a group I'd have to make several of these. I'm looking forward to making it again.

I thought this was wonderful! I the advise of a bunch of the reviews and I have added sundried tomatos, greek olives, artichoke hearts, garlic, and leeks. That's another recipe, but it's yummy too!

This is a keeper. Made ahead on Sat. to reheat for Sun. brunch, and it almost didn't make till the morning! Used garlic & herb feta, and added a pinch of nutmeg & coriander + a dash of basil & 1 extra egg. Delicious.

Added one extra egg because I was a little worried about using skim milk when cream is preferred. It was great. Everyone loved it. We'll definitely make it again.

I've been making this since it first appeared in Gourmet - it's a very quick and easy supper - and also a recipe that lends itself to throwing in a few ingredients that might be in the fridge. I love the suggestion from one reviewer to use it for breakfast - what a great idea!

I have to admit I cheat. I use a ready made pie crust and it is still fabulous. I would definately serve this to company.

Rating: 3
Easy & attractive. Based on other reviews, I increased all filling ingredients by 50% (ie, 3 cups of spinach instead of 2) and it made a very attractive presentation in a 9-in pie plate. I do think it needs something to give it a little more zing; I found myself adding more salt at the table than I would have preferred. Greek olives are something to consider or a liberal pinch of garlic salt when sauteeing the spinach.

A pleasant twist on an old classic.

I changed the recipe slightly, but I doubled the filling recipe, used frozen spinach, which I sauteed in olive oil for about 2 minutes and substituted about 3/4 cup of cheddar instead of feta. I didn't use any red pepper.

I have made this quiche twice and it's really delicious. I made it in a large - (9"?)removable bottom tart dish and doubled everthing - dough and filling. Will make it for all my brunches. - Four Forks.

Did this in a 10 inch tart pan by doubling the filling ingredients. Used a commercial pie crust (the kind you buy out of the dairy case). Took it to a party, never got a piece because it was devoured immediately. It looked very festive--and people tell me it was delicious. Guess I'll have to make it again to taste it....

I loved this dish as did my guests! I still get calls for this recipe. Will definitely make it again.

Added onions and substituted swiss chard for the spinach. Definitely took longer than 25 minutes to cook. Next time would double eggs and cream as the quiche only filled up half the pie shell. Great taste though.

Rating: 3
Delicious and simple to make! From start to the time I put it in the oven - 30 minutes.I substituted 1 T soft butter for the shortening and I also substituted soy milk for the heavy cream/milk. I followed the suggestion of one of the other reviewers to add chopped leeks to the spinach mixture and I'm glad I did - wonderful flavor. I added a little too much salt to my spinach mixture (the recipe didn't call for a particular amount - I always get in trouble w/too much salt when the recipe doesn't tell me how much to use!) - so next time, I'll use less - the salt in the feta makes up for it anyway!My guests loved it...I'm craving a slice right now!

Very flavorful. I sprinkled a little extra crumbled feta over the top after baking and it made a nice presentation with all the colors. Be sure to check the center well for doneness. I removed it from oven after it was "set" and shell was nice golden color. Unfortunately, once we cut into it, we found the center to be somewhat wet! (I let it set at room temp for 15 minutes, too).

I have used this recipe as a template for lots of variations. I usually sautee onions or leeks, and sometimes mix in cottage cheese or ricotta along with the feta. Ive also used other greens, sauteeing them longer if they are tougher than spinach. I especially like swiss chard.

I'd never made quiche before, and this was quick and looked very pretty in the pie plate. It was very mild, even with all of the feta. I might add some chopped olives or something to spice it up a little next time.

Wonderful! Beautiful and delicious.

This is very good and easy to make. Be sure to make the crust go high enough up the sides of your pan before baking (remembering that it shrinks a bit when baked). I had the egg/cream mixture run over the sides and underneath because I didn't make it high enough on the sides. Good weeknight recipe!

This was VERY simple and easy. It makes a great dinner item, served with a side of fresh veggies and/or a salad. It's also good cold for those with left overs. The crust was very flaky and easy to make. To save time, I made it several hours in advance. I actually replaced the eggs with egg substitute and used skim milk with a little bit of 1/2 & 1/2 in place of the cream in order to lower the fat/calorie content and it turned out great.

This is a great recipe. When I went to my market they were just out of spinach so I exchanged swiss chard for it. That was great
