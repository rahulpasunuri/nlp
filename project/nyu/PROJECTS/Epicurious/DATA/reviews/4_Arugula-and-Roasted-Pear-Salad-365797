This recipe really pays off. For minimal effort, you get an attractive, delicious main course salad. I have no idea how to obtain calendula blossoms, but this was quite good without them.

I made this exactly as directed to bring to a dinner party and it was a tremendous hit. I brought over the dressing, pine nuts/cheese/cranberries, and pears separately so it wouldn't get soggy in the car, then assembled to serve. Since then, I've made it again for lunch 3-4 times (skipping the roasting of pears and toasting of pine nuts) and I can't get enough of it! Oh, I didn't have calendula blossoms but I guarantee it's fantastic without them.

I made this salad for my boyfriend's birthday (followed by mac n cheese w/ swiss chard - also on this website & delicious!) Did just what the recipe said (minus the calendula blossoms for decoration). Also used shaved parmesan (not grated) & it was perfect! The dressing is really amazing & simple & fantastic. After you make this salad the first time, it's easy to make super quickly. Highly recommended

I needed to make a dinner salad to accompany my husbands homemade pizza. This recipe looked perfect. I followed the recipe with two substitutions. I already had sunflower seeds and dried cherries in the pantry so I swapped out the pine nuts and cranberries. Still, the salad was absolutely delicious! I am not kidding  there was not a morsel of food on anyones plate when we cleared them from the table. All the flavors blend well together  the slightly bitter arugula, the sweet and buttery pears, and the savory cheese and seeds. Oh, and the mix of textures are great, too. The salad has a great presentation for entertaining with the contrast of colors. I am making the salad again in a few days when another friend comes over for lunch!

I served this to my in-laws this past weekend. They declared it the best salad they have ever eaten. I used one small pear per person and that was the pefect amount. The pears I had on hand were fully ripe. They tasted fine, but I thought they were too "mushy". Next time I'll use pears that are not quite ripe, as the recipe suggests. I also combined other lettuce with the arugula, which worked fine.

Delicious - it made for an elegant presentation with minimum effort. I used one small pear per person and included a small wedge of a mild, creamy blue cheese. The combination of the flavours was superb. Definitely a keeper.

Terrific salad! Comments included "fantastic" and "the best salad I have ever eaten." I made some minor changes: I used mixed baby greens with the arugula, "light butter" (half canola oil and half butter) to roast the pears, and white balsamic vinegar for its milder taste. Highly recommended!

delicious! Not a pine nut fan so used sweet and spicy walnuts instead. Agree that can reduce the amount of pear.

I agree that fewer pears are needed. Great fall salad. I used the arugula and the combination of bitter with sweet was just right. A keeper for sure.

Yes - this is a keeper! I've been making again and again, and when I took it to a potluck, it was the only salad there eaten down to the very last drop. Arugula is a perfect balance for the sweetness of the pears, and the dressing is perfect. Making it again now!

Really tasty, pretty simple to make. Used mixed greens and didn't need 4 pears roasted 3 and still had some left over. Big hit with the guests.
