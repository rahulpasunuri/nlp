Loved it. Trick to smoothness was keep stirring while cheese is melting. Served with chunky pretzels, steamed broccoli, steamed butternut squash, and baby Kosher dills. Odd combo, but had on hand and it worked.

3.5 forks would be perfect; it's a distinct taste, and quite good, but not a hit with everyone.

Made this for St. Patrick's Day as a little something different from the same old corned beef and cabbage. We used a crisp (alcoholic) apple cider in place of the 6 tbsp of apple juice concentrate as the latter is a "thing that should not be" in my book. This turned out delicious and is a really fun twist on both fondue and St. Patrick's Day.

Very good and it was great for St. Patrick's Day. I loved the flavor that the Stout gave it. Next time I might use some more/different vegatables. And, it turned out a little runny. It might need some more cheese to make it a little creamier.

I made this recipe on the stove top and then put it into my mini crock pot to serve at our monthly "girls foodie night". It was a huge hit. It became richer and nuttier as the night went on and it caramelized on the edges of the crock pot.

We love this recipe! We make it for football nights, or just for whenever! The freshness of the cheese is key, when you are shredding it, if it's moist, the fondue will be creamy, if it's dried out and crumbling, it will be grainy. I use Harp to cut the stout taste down and I use apple sauce instead of frozen juice, it deepens the flavor. Awesome with just granny smiths and a baguet.

The key to this receipe is to omit the flour-not needed and the guiness, we used a micro brew porter and it was delicious!

This was such a hit with the office lunch crowd! I found a cheese at Publix that was called "Irish Stout Cheddar" and didn't use Guinness, but substituted with Heineken because I didn't want to ruin the color. It was delicious and easy.

We liked the flavors in this, but as others have mentioned, the texture was off. I used the creamiest cheddar I could find, but it came out very grainy and clumped almost immediately. Not sure this will be a repeat dish.

Rating: 1
The combination of flavors were distinct,but the color was unappetizing, and it was grainy although we used a good quality of Irish cheddaras suggested. This did not beat out another beer and cheddar recipe we prefer, so we won't spend the extra money to make this one again.

Made this for New Year's Eve dinner with my husband and two children -- it was extraordinarily good! We modified the recipe: used 5-year-old white cheddar and substituted a cream ale for the stout (thought Guinness might be too strong a taste for the kids). Also used fresh-pressed apple cider instead of apple juice concentrate. The texture was smooth and creamy (I think the quality of the cheese is key here) and the taste was divine. We served it with steamed broccoli, cauliflower, ruby red fingerling potatoes, French bread and apples and loved them all. It was one of those meals where everyone kept saying "Ooh" and "Aaah." Would definitely do this again.

This was good, but the cheddar got gummy. Next time I might add some Velveeta to keep it smooth. GASP.

Rating: 4
Delicious!! Described as a first course, this recipe works better as a main course because the use of stout makes for a very rich fondue. I made a beer bread (again with stout) that went really well with it. The bread could have made it a stout overload, but was subtle enough that it paired well. And I just realized that I forgot the apples! Looks like I've got to start all over again! Yum!

I always make fondue using beer. I think Stout may be a little strong for my tastes but that is just personal perference. I also put a smashed garlic clove in with the liquid as I heat it and remove it before adding the cheese.

I also used sam Adams Light and it was wonderful! Dipped bread, apples and asparagus. Will def be making this again.

I have made several beer cheese dips and fondues and have found that I don't enjoy the flavor. I like beer and cheese seperately though :) When I made this the texture was a little grainy but I didn't use high quality cheese. If you like beer and cheese dips this recipe is for you, I just personally don't care for it.

My guests loved this and I loved this recipe. I served it with a walnut prune bread, mission figs, sausages and apples. Fabulous. The color was more like caramel or maple icing. The flavor was great. I used a sharp VT cheddar and made my own concentrate by boiling apple juice down to a concentrated syrup. Still very easy.

Delicious, but if you don't like Irish stout, it might not be for you. I've made this several times, usually just with potatoes for dipping, and apples if I have them. Very easy to make.

Excellent fondue! One suggestion - add a bit of fresh lemon juice at the end for a bit of sharpness. Served with bread and apples- all was eaten! Even my born & bread Irish husband couldn't get enough of the Guinness flavor!

Made this for a St. Patty's Day party, and it was absolutely delicious. I did modify the recipe by using six tablespoons of apricot nectar rather than apple juice concentrate (have always hated apple juice). I had trouble keeping the burner for my fondue pot lit, so after awhile it was a globby mess. Even then my guests scarfed it down!

We made this last night as part of our St. Paddy's feast. Followed the recipe for the fondue portion. Dipped good bread, green onions, apples, mushrooms and steamed cauli. Easy to make, everyone enjoyed it. I agree with the color assessment that others have stated, but it didn't prevent us from pounding it down. One stated that they would cut the apple concentrate next time, but everyone else really enjoyed it.

Made it for our St. Patricks Day party and it was delish! I used extra sharp white cheddar because they didnt have Irish cheddar at the supermarket; substituted Sam Light instead of Guinness and only added apple juice concentrate to taste as was recommended in another review (we ended up with about 3 Tbsp total). The color was a creamy tan color and very appealing. I used apple slices and Italian bread cubes for dipping (the bread cubes went perfectly with this dish). My fondue pot needs to be plugged in and I was concerned it was in an out of the way place, but everyone still crowded around it and devoured it all. Ill definitely be making this recipe again soon!

fondue part was tasty. Color unappetizing. Too many veggies for that # of women. Labor intense with all the steaming. Probably wouldn't make again.

Very tasty fondue. I used white cheddar and it turned out an attractive light tan color. Didn't have the apple juice concentrate plus was making this for my family with young children, so I used 1/2 c. guinness and 1/4 c. apple juice. We licked the bowl clean. I didn't do the veggies as instructed, so can't rate those, but the fondue itself was very good.

I splurged on the pricey Irish Stout Cheddar cheese since it was marbled. The cheese was great by itself, but after adding the Guinness, flour, and apple juice, it was terrible. It was a waste of alot of money. The taste was tart at first bite, then cheesy, and the color did not make it appetizing. I cooked cauliflower, red potatoes, asparagus and brussels sprouts, all fresh. I thought I would give it a shot since there seemed to be a number of reviews that were decent, but I was extremely disappointed.

Made it for friends last night and it was wonderful. I didn't have regular stout, but used a chocolate flavored stout and it added a nice touch to it. The potatoes went first, they were addicting!!! We also had it with a brown bread made with stout. All in all a wonderful recipe!

Excellent. Differnt taste and texture than reg. fondue. But not offensive by anymeans-. I wouldn't make it for a Christmas party but it was perfect for a St. Pats Party. Everyone enjoyed it and it was fun to try something so diifernt than reg. fondue. I also served it with a black bread and Guinness Beer Bread, (found a mix at the grocery store) Really Good! A new St Pats Tradition!

I ran across this fondue recipe while pulling our St. Paddy's day menue together and served it last night to my favorite guinea pigs - my boys and some of their friends. The ingredients sounded wonderful but the mixed reviews had me nervously watching everyone's reaction as they took their first tastes. It was wonderful!!! 1/2 of my Aged Irish cheddar ended up being snacked upon earlier in the day (anonymously of course), so I used extra sharp white cheddar in it's place. Taking the suggestion of adding the apple concentrate at the end, I ended up using approximately 4 Tbsp and about 1 cup of Guinness. We enjoyed this with steamed broccoli, baby carrots, asparagus spears and rye and pumpernickel breads. The broccoli and carrots steamed for 15 minutes, which was perfect for the carrots, but the broccoli was a little too tender to dip. Next time I'll steam the broccoli with the same technique I used for the asparagus. Bring the water under the steaming basket to a boil, drop in the vegetables, cover, turn off the heat and let stand 10 minutes. Perfect veges for an outstanding fondue. PS one of my boys liked it so much he put his arm across my shoulders and asked to have fondue more often. I think weve started a new monthly tradition at our house!

Yuck! This has to be the worst recipe I've ever made off of this site! I figured that it had so many good reviews I'd give it a try and followed the recipe exactly but it was horrible. Waste of time and money

I made this for company, and everyone loved it! I'm not too fond of brussel sprouts or cauliflower, so I substituted broccoli, carrots and mushrooms. It was fantastic and easy to prepare ahead of time- I steamed the potatoes and carrots for 10 min and then added the other veggies for another 5, popped it all in the fridge until it was time to serve the fondue. It was nice to have the cold steamed veggies to contrast the fondue because it does get very hot.

Everyone just loved this! Used regular cheddar in attempt to keep to my budget. Added a tsp of worsterschire sauce and cut the flour to 2 T and it was great. We dipped bread, mushrooms, broccoli, little smokies, ham and sweet peppers. My favorite was the sweet peppers, but the bread and little smokies went first. Unlike alot of cheese fondue recipes this does reheat pretty well in the micro. Only issue I had with it was the color-it's kinda ugly colored.

I was hesitant to make this based upon mixed reviews but I gleaned from the suggestions and would highly suggest to do the following: Make the recipe using all said ingredients BUT add a dash of cinnamon AND add the apple juice concentrate LAST ~ 1Tbsp at a time and ONLY to taste. (I ended up only adding 1 tbsp.) We dipped an "Irish Baked Red Potato Soda Bread" made by a local bakery in our area. My guests devoured it and when asking for the recipe they were shocked by the ingredients but all agreed it was the most delicious and unique fondue they have ever had. Be adventurous and try it!

I'm shocked to see the other reviews. Our supper club members are pretty much fondue fanatics and all of us loved this unique but so tasty recipe. We added rye bread as a dipper as well. Which was a big hit. Although the texture and color were different than traditional cheese fondue the flavor was excellent. And this was such an easy recipe to make too. Our supper club highly recommends it. Everyone wanted the recipe as soon as I could get it to them.

This is the second time I've made this for a St. Patrick's Day dinner. Last year I decided to use orange juice concentrate after reading the reviews. It was good, but a little too sweet. This year I made it with apple juice, exactly according to recipe, and it was delicious. Everyone at the table loved it. My husband and I are both wishing we had a little left over for lunch today. I thought the apple juice-cheese-stout balance was just right. The recipe is a great community-oriented way to start a meal.

I got a mixed reaction to this recipe. Some people loved it; some did not. I added stout to thin the recipe as directed, but lost the apple aspect, so I also added more apple juice concentrate. The only thing that put me off was the color--a little too gravy-looking for me. Even more brown than the picture. I would make this again for my more adventurous friends.

I can't believe the negative reviews for the this recipe! This was the highlight of our St. Patrick's Day dinner. There was a lot of left over corned beef because we all ate so much fondue. We also dipped soda bread into it. Fabulous. Don't think I'll ever use another fondue recipe.

The combonation of flavors did not appeal to my taste. Love all of these ingredients separately, but combined the flavors were not complementary. Used a great quality irish cheddar, and reduced the amount of apple juice concentrate by 1/2. It was okay, but I would not make this again. The flavors just did not combine well.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I used aged Irish cheddar which has a very pungent, strong, lovely flavor. It's a pricier cheese but it's so worth the extra money, instead of just regular white cheddar. I eye-balled a lot of the ingredients, just because I have a lot of cooking experience and I didn't think it was too sweet, like some other cooks had said. Everyone at the St. Patty's Day party raved about it! I'm making it again tonight for a dinner party I'm gonig to! I've been craving it ever since the first time I made it!

This is delicious. I used white extra-sharp cheddar.

This is an excellent recipe, but to be on the safe side, you should only add part of the apple concentrate at the beginning so it won't be too sweet for your taste. You can always add the remaining concentrate to taste at the end. You can also add a bit more stout to cut the sweetness and adjust the consistency.

We had a St. Patty's day get-together, but being an Orthodox Christian observing Paschal lent, could not eat any meat! Hence, this was our "substitute" for Corned Beef & Cabbage. Was a big hit! Used authentic Irish cheddar (yummy). Served as an hors d'oeuvre and kids and adults alike enjoyed. Guiness gave fondue a caramel color - unexpected, but good! Try it, you will like it!
