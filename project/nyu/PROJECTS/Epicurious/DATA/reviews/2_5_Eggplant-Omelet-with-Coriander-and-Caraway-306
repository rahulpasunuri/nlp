I want to update my last review; I must have done something wrong, because I made this receipe again and I loved it. Used 3 eggplants for 6 eggs and found it perfect; also, those LEMON WEDGES are essential. Sorry for the confusion.

I love eggplants, but this recipe disappointed me. It is too bland to my taste. Lemon juice helps a bit, but doesn't convince me.

Found that 1 big eggplant was just enough for the rest of the ingredients in amounts as given. We had the leftovers at room temp., and still delicious. Would increase the coriander, and maybe add some cumin next time.

Fantastic, i too used only about a pound of eggplant and used 8 eggs. I left the spices the same and served a Tunisian couscous recipe with speckled red potato sauce (on the side). Fantastic. I'm making it again. the lemon really works on the omelet. I didn't cook it at all in the oven. I used a cast iron skillet and covered the whole thing with aluminium foil instead. The Tunisian couscous recipe was from Madhur Jaffrey's "World vegetarian."

Delicious--with the following changes: I too thought that 3 eggplants for 6 eggs would be excessive, so I used 1 large eggplant, 4 eggs, and halved all of the seasonings. I also let it bake at 300 for 5 minutes, to make sure it was really set. Color looked fine.

There are plenty of other things to do with eggplant. I found the 3 lbs of eggplant just overwhelmed the six eggs. It also came out a sort of gray/green in the middle which didn't appeal to my family too much.
