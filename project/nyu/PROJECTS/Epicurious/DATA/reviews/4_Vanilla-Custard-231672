Very good and quick recipe. I cut my sugar down to 1/2c, but would use only 1/3c next time as 1/2c was plenty sweet. I did not strain it because I was too hungry.

Very easy and very good. You don't really need a thermometer - It's fairly obvious when the consistency changes and it's done. Stir like a mad fool and all will work out

OOPS! First time making custard. I stirred and stirred the mixture for ten minutes and it never seemed to thicken. All the other steps went perfectly accept this last bit. Is it possible I needed to stir MUCH longer?

This is a fantastic recipe!!! I used it in a trifle and it was perfect! A little looser than pudding, great texture. I didn't have any curdling. I added extra vanilla (I almost always do) and next time I might just throw in a vanilla seed as well. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my repertoire!

I sincerely think this is the best way to go with a vanilla custard. the only thing i do differently is add a dash of nutmeg when it is finished. I definitely run this through a very fine sifting strainer and MY OH MY i usually can't wait for it to hit another dish before i have to take a big lick off the spoon. I use this for pies as well as sweet tarts ..

This recipe is awesome, though I did alter it a bit -- mother of 2 toddlers needs simplicity, so... -I only used 1/3 cup sugar -Didn't use a thermometer -Didn't filter it (just beat the heck out of it with a whisk) -Used 12 small egg yolks from our free-range bantam chickens instead of 8 regular sized It was so creamy and delicious, I just ate it as is, hot at first, then a few hours later (when I was craving it again) I had it at room temp. Great both ways. I will definitely make this again -- never using custard powder again.

A wonderful custard and easy to prepare. Not too sweet. I served it with a peach pie. Definitely a keeper. As soon as the custard started to bubble I took it off the heat and added the butter and vanilla. I did not strain the custard and it turned out perfectly.

This custard is stupendous. I used it in cream puffs, and 9 dinner guests groaned and rolled their eyes in ecstacy. Don't let the lack of an instant-read thermometer keep you from making this recipe - you'll know when you're at 170 degrees because the custard will suddenly begin to thicken. And I also recommend making it ahead of time since it's much better well chilled.

I have made many custards and found this one to be easy and fast. Very nice base for cookies/pies/cakes.
