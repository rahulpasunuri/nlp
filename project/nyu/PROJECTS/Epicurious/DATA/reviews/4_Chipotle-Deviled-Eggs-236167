I have made these 4 times now - always a huge hit - even with people who don't care too much for devilled eggs. Quick, easy, inexpensive and delicious = a winner!

These are fantastic. Since Deviled Eggs are a low-brow item, this made them acceptable to serve at a party in my opinion. You have to like a little bit of "kick" in your food, but if you do these are awesome.

although my wife said they were the best deviled eggs she had ever had I wanted more smokey flavor. next time I think I'll had some of the adobo sauce that was in the canned chiles. I used a potato ricer instead of the box grater and it was very easy

A great, simple dish with a nice tex-mex twist on an old favorite. Made this for a dinner party and it was a hit. I did, however, put a bit less chipotle (about 1/2 the amount the recipe suggests) in them since I have learned from other recipes that too much chipotle (especially with guests that have delicate taste buds) can absolutely ruin a dish. Better safe than sorry.

Excellent, cheap, and easy. This is the 2nd time I've made these.

We love these and serve them whenever we can. I make my own chipotle sauce and then store it in the fridge to use whenever I need it. We love these eggs spicy, as do our friends. To another reviewer: there is no SHAME in having different tastes.

If you liked these eggs, try my Sialkot Deviled Eggs (via Member Recipes). They've got some kick but that can be increased if you really like spicy. They sound weird but TRUST ME, they're incredibly delicious!

I made this recipe as a contribution to a very large reception at my parish, this morning. It was an embarassment, I made 78 halves and most were not eaten. This is the worst thing I have ever made and I am a retired caterer. DON'T TRY THIS AND SHAME ON WHOEVER CONCOCTED THIS.

Very good. Tasty, used only 1/2 the amt of chipotle to keep it mild -- perfect!

An exquisite indulgence for deviled-egg lovers who "like it hot!" This is a delicious and easy recipe and sure to be a hit with anyone who loves that smoky, hot chipotle flavor. For extra kick you might even offer chipotle chile powder (or smoked paprika) to sprinkle on. I was out of the canned chipotles en adobo that are a staple in my pantry, but luckily had a small jar of Terra Sol chipotle chile paste, and it worked just fine. I did without the cilantro this timethe other family members abhor it (must be genetic) but next time I offer these to guests, I'll have cilantro on the side. It's true that chipotles are not for the faint of heart or palate, so know your audience (what's a better word?) if you're serving these to guests.

I really did not care for the flavor combination of this recipe. Next time I will stick to a more traditional deviled egg recipe.

very good recipe...careful with the chipoltes (or add to taste). I added the cilantro to the mix as well as a garnish and by the time i got to it at the thanksgiving potluck, well, I'm glad i tried them at home cuz they were gone and lots of good comments. A good change up to the traditional eggs!

Overall pretty good but I would've liked some crunch to the recipe, bits of onion or celery maybe. Also, I thought there was too much mayo, I used only about 2/3 of the recipe.

Rating: 4
Yes...add some chopped cilantro to the egg mixture as well. Just mashed the egg and added the mayo until it seemed the right consistancy. Everyone loved this at our staff lunch.

Rating: 4
To the cook from LA criticizing the recipe...2-3 tsp of chipotle is NOT 3 whole chiles! If you added 2 tsp as written, you wouldn't have overpowered the recipe. Chipotles by nature are smokey. They are jalapeños smoked and dried. They will overpower anything if they're overused.

I made this recipe for our Easter gathering. It was wonderful! Not only did everyone rave about the taste, it is the only devilled egg recipe I have ever made that had no filling left over! I highly recomend this one!!!

WELL! I read all of the reviews before I made these eggs, and I read the one that if you like SPICY... you should use all of the Chipotles-------WRONG!!! It was ok... but most thought it was AWFUL....... but I was not convinced that it was bad, so I tried it again last night, but this time, I used only 3 chiptoles.....and I mixed in the food processor with a little cilentro, lime and mayo.... I used only a couple of spoonfuls of mayo too... I mixed the mixture with the eggs separately... and then added mayo as needed so that there was not too much of the mayo... I think this receipe calls for too much mayo... I used the baggie idea.. that is great..... and to be on the safe side.... I used only 9 eggs.... cause I used another 9 eggs to make REGULAR stuffed eggs JUST INCASE they were thought to be awfull----- but everyone loved them... I used roasted pepper as a garnish and they were a hit both kinds. So to the lady who made all of those SPICY chipotles.... your friend might have loved them.. but these eggs only need a hint of chipotle.... they are far more successful that way... I love spicy, but this is too elegant to do real spicy, and I live in an area where we LOVE the spice!!!

I added chopped cilantro and a 1/4 teaspoon of lime juice to the egg mixture. The lime juice compliments the cilantro and really perks up the eggs. Everyone loved them.

I added some of the cilantro to the mix as well, to good success. To the person who earlier asked about chipotle powder instead of whole chipotles: the pepper itself adds some texture (and moisture), so I would think it would be better to use the canned pepper than just the powder. Just a guess on my part.

The flavor of the chipotle / adobo sauce did not do anythig for the eggs. it tastes too much like smokey BBQ, which was very strong. Granted, I did not know exactly what to expect from that sauce, but I expected heat, which was definitely overpowered by the BBQ flavor, which neither compliments nor is complimented by egg and mayo. Thankfully, I made just one prior to making the whole thing, so I'm just going to waste the peppers, not the whole thing, as there is no way I would serve this as an appetizer for a party

Made these to share with a group of friends while camping and they were a huge hit! I used about 4 tsp of finely chopped chipotle chiles and at the recommendation of several other reviewers, added at least 1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro to the yolk mixture. The red color from the chiles and the green from the cilantro made for a great presentation. They'll be devoured quickly!!!

Delicious. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested the use of a zip lock for the pastry bagless. Topped mine with leftover grilled shrimp and pimenton.

YUMMY!! Added tiny bay shrimp & lots more chipotle plus salt & pepper. This was a definite winner at cocktail party!

Scrumptious little numbers. Included these in part of a Mexican buffet and they were quite the hit. Did take a few shortcuts and just mashed the yolks instead of grating and went ahead and scooped the filling in. I added a little bit of salt and cumin for extra zing. Make these!

What if I only use Chipotle powder and not the canned peppers? Do they really have to chill 2 hours?

I added a can of chipotles and adobo sauce then garnished with some green onions and alittle lemon. Got great comments on the dish! Will make again!

These were a hit the first time I made them just using the chipotles & adobo sauce. The second time I made them I added some roughly chopped shrimp (16-20's) then topped them with the cilantro leaf & a salad shrimp. These are always requested byfriends whenever we get together for a gathering. The plate never wrapping for the trip home!

Fantastic deviled eggs the first time I made them. The second time I added diced shrimp to the yolk mixture they were the hit of the party. They always requested when we get together with friends for a party.

This is hands down THE BEST DEVILED EGG I've ever had! I made 3 dozen & shared with my co- workers. I made mild, medium & spicy. I followed the recipe for the mild dozen. For the medium dozen, I added 4 teaspoons of chipotle & added cilantro to the yolk recipe & put 1/2 tsp. of the adobo sauce in the egg halfs before adding the yolk recipe & for the SPICY... I doubled the chipotle petters, more cilantro & put adobo sauce in the egg shells. I prefer the spicy...but I like everything HOT. One co-worker said: "It's like a party in your mouth!" Spice up your life people! These eggs are good. I'm e- mailing the recipe to many in the office now.

I add loads more chipotles to mine and they are fabulous!

This recipe is excellent! I definitely recommend adding more chipotle peppers... and in my opinion, the more cilantro, the better. I might try chopping up cilantro and adding it the yolk mixture.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it three times last year, for a fund raiser not for profit, a work social potluck and Thanksgiving. I did add smoke Paprika on top after this first attempt as well as added more chipotles as I wanted more of a kick and color. I am making it again this year.

this turned out great!! i would add more chipotle peppers then what is suggested on the recipe and a little bit of the adobe sauce for more of a punch. i used a zip lock bag, filled it with the egg filling and cut one of the corners since i didnt have a pastry bag with a fancy attachment.. see photos of my deviled eggs at http://runofroad3.blogspot.com

Super easy and very tasty. The chipotles add a nice smoky flavor. I made egg salad with the ugly eggs that refused to peel, and it was just as good.

These deviled eggs are such a hit every time I make them. I am always asked for the recipe. I do top them with a bit of ground chipotle pepper for color. The cilantro is a great touch!

Made it for an art gallery opening and they were gone in minutes! I used dried chipotle peppers that had been soaking overnight. Worked great. I'm making them for Easter lunch.

My fiance' is a deviled egg fiend. I think he at 3 eggs after I made this recipe. He really did enjoy them. Myself, I preferred the more classic version of deviled eggs -- but hey, I'm just one opinion.
