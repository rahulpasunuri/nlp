Very tasty rice recipe. Perhaps a tad too oily - I might try to cut back on the butter slightly. Had to use veggie broth in the absence of chicken broth, but was quite happy with the result. Will be making again for sure.

Nice flavor and very easy

Easy, lovely rice recipe. I've made this several times, and got a lot of compliments. The only change I made after the first time I cooked it is to add raisins or sultanas to the rice and let it cook together (so they get soft); it adds extra flavor to it.

Simple, elegant, and delicious. Worthy of a special occasion and everyday meals.

A well done pilaf! This will be a constant on our table. Suggestion... 1-2 drops of Almond extract during the final rice cook REALLY brings out some subtle flavors. You'll enjoy this addition.

This dish is superb. The only change I made was to use a strong Garlic Salt instead of just salt. Simple yet elegant and open for all kinds of variations. Such as added mushrooms or chicken pieces. We use it as a bed for chicken and/or pork chops. Very simple and not overly expensive.

A little bland ... but I would do it again. I added some frozen green peas to add some colour. Good basic recipe. Served with a whole chicken I roasted in the slow cooker.

Delicious and incredibly easy. Rice was done after 15 minutes.

Nice. We used scallions instead of onion and then added chopped scallion greens with the almonds.

Excellent basic pilaf recipe. I would suggest only using chicken broth instead of mixing it with water, unless the broth is very salty. Will do again!

I tend to kill rice, so the method on this one caught my eye -- turned out wonderful (omitted saffron, as I was going for a broth/onion rice to begin with).

This was my first time making a pilaf. It was so easy, and really delicious. I will be making this a lot!

This was excellent. Like the poster below, I love my rice fluffy. It had just the right amount of flavoring as a side dish, not to overpower. Due to an empty fridge, I served it next to steak and steamed green beans. I did leave out the almonds, as I already had those in the beans. A definite keeper.

This was simple and a very nice taste. I would definetly recommend this recipe.

I used shallots as well, since I like their flavor better. I thought it was delicious, but certainly simple in terms flavors, and not strong enough to stand on it's own (but the saffron is so delicious!) It was easy to make and I'll make it again. My partner thought he would prefer it without the almonds, saying they competed too strongly with the saffron flavor, but I enjoyed the mixed texture they provided.

My husband and I loved this rice. It was simple, flavorful and the toasted almonds really make it. I love rice when it is dry and not mushy or runny.

I didn't care for this rice dish. It was bland and tasteless, even though I served it with a flavorful meat. I omitted the almonds because I didn't have them in the house, but I don't think they would have made much of a difference. (Of course, I am Indian so I am used to rice full of flavors. Try making a rice pulao sometime in lieu of this!)

I made this dish as part of the final practical exam for my Food Prep class. The chef/instructor loved it, and so did I. Easy (I had a lot of other cooking to do) and elegant, especially with the addition of the toasted almonds at the last minute for some extra crunch.

Paired this dish with the roasted halibut with tomatoes, saffron and cilantro. It was a match made in heaven! Also used shallot and added a little fresh cilantro.

A perfect, simple rice dish. I followed the advice of substituting shallots for the onion, and it was delicious (and a bit more elegant). I served it with lemon-caper chicken, and roasted asparagus and portobello mushrooms. Definitely a keeper!

Outstanding! Everyone, from my 6 year old daughter to me 73 year old friend raved about this. Just the right amount of saffron flavor, and almond crunch. This will be a regular side dish here!

An excellent side dish for Orange Roughy baked in parchment. It took closer to 23 minutes for all liquid to be absorbed, but an earlier poster fixed that problem by increasing the amount of rice. This will definitely be added to my regular offerings.

Simple but elegant -- I served this with garlic/rosemary lamb chops and it was great. I made one important change, though -- the recipe called for too much liquid. I used 1-1/3 cups of rice -- my standard proportion for 2 c. liquid -- and it was perfect.

Used shallots instead of onion and parsley. Very tasty. Served with chicken marsala

This simple preparation allowed the aromatic flavor of the saffron to come through beautifully. The browning of the rice added depth of flavor and the almonds, just a nice bit of cruch. This was the perfect rice dish to serve with my Garlic Shrimp Gratin
