I followed the recipe exactly but my apples fell apart during the baking process. Thus, it turned out more like apple sauce in the end (served with vanilla ice cream) but had great flavor. Perhaps the peeling and slicing of the apples contributed to this...

I didn't use the lemon, allspice or the jam but It came out great. Very yummy, I can't wait to make it again.

Excellent. I substituted bourbon for the brandy and used ground cinnamon as I did not have stick cinnamon at home, and it came out great. My wife says this one's a keeper.

super yummy! I substituted whiskey for the brandy and ginger fig jam for the apricot. It was easily quadrupled for 4 servings and my dinner guests just loved it. This will be thanksgiving dessert instead of apple pie.

For this recipe, I subsittued orange marmalade for the apricot jam and scotch whiskey for the brandy. I served it with mango ice cream with the sauce poured over it. It turned out delightful. My husband licked his bowl clean!
