Made this in the middle of a snowstorm because we were down to a head of napa cabbage and two carrots. Wow. Really good. I usually don't like coleslaw because it's so sweet but the pickle relish adds just the right hint of sweetness and still let the zing of the white wine vinegar sing through. This would be awesome on top of some slow barbecued pulled pork in the summer...

While I usually buy ready cole slaw because I haven't been able been able to get it just the way I like it, this one is simple, with ingredients that are at hand. To make things easier on busy weeknights, I usually use ready shredded cabbage. It's a great way to get a quick, fresh cole slaw that's ready in no time. My husband & kids really like it.

This is a honest,simple recipe. True there is nothing fancy about it but truly how can a recipe whose main item is Cabbage! Yummy Yummy!

I was thinking of making this recipe to have something different, but after reading the reviews I am reconsidering. My usual is the Coleslaw in Bon Appetit July 95. It is an excellent tasting salad. To the reviewer from Delta, BC - small world, I used to live on Panorama Ridge.

Great easy recipe. I was also a little leary of the relish, but find that it does a great job of adding sweetness without being as bland as just adding sugar would be. I reduced amount of Dijon mustard to 1 tbsp. to make recipe more child friendly. Good sidedish for these "baseball nights" when I am trying to get a meal together quickly after a game.

Although when reading this recipe, the thought of putting a forkfull of relish into my mouth kind of turned me off, I thought I would give it a try. Guess what? I toned down the relish a bit and I still felt like I was eating in my 5th grade cafeteria with a forkfull of relish! Never again.

Sorry to be the negative one here, but I wasn't thrilled with this recipe. I think it lacked pizzaz - it was pretty ordinary (maybe that's just the way coleslaw is). Also, made it in advance for flavours to blend as recommended (followed the recipe exactly) and it was soggy/too wet at serving time. Blah.

I was never crazy about coleslaw until I made this recipe the other day. This dish is delicious, cheap, and quick to prepare. I did substitute a bit of buttermilk for some of the mayo. I'm going to make it the same exact way tonight.

This recipe was great, very quick and easy! I used the ready made coleslaw mix instead of shredding the cabbage & carrots.

This was really good with the barbecue potatoes in the same issue. The slaw is not overly mayonaisie, nor sweet. It is balanced and sits well. I finished the last little portion 3 days later. Make it at least one hour ahead of time, so the flavors blend. As part of a meal, 1/2 the recipe was more than enough for my family of 4.
