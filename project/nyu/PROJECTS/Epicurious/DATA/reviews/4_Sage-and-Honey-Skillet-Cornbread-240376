This was by far the best cornbread we have ever had. It was a snap to make and so buttery and delicious. This one's a keeper.

Holy cow, is this delicious cornbread. I have been dying to make this, and for the first attempt I made it exactly as directed; I wanted to eat the entire pan as soon as I took the first bite. Next time, I will likely use less honey and less baking powder, as others have suggested. It was a tad too sweet for me (although I don't like unsweetened cornbread, either). It might also be good with a savory element, like some crumbled bacon? I would also like it to be a little less fluffy, and a little more dense. There are soooo many ways you can play with this recipe, I can't wait to start trying. Also, I probably won't make it with the sage leaves in the future, unless I have them on hand, but as others have suggested, I would definitely use them the first time you try it, because they are better than I expected.

Before the meal even started I was asked to make double the recipe next year. I followed it almost exactly but I did add 2 heaping tablespoons of sage and substituted whole milk for 1/2 c 2% milk and 1/2 c almond milk. I also folded in about a tablespoon of thinly diced cold unsalted butter just before pouring in batter to bake. It was deeeeeelicious.

Followed the recipe and found the cornbread to be rather cakeish. It was fluffier than I expected. The flavor of the sage and honey was a nice touch.

I loved this - the sage makes it! I served this with a bean soup and it was a hit with everyone, including the dozen kids who were here. Cooking it in my iron skillet was brilliant. The top of the cornbread with the sage on top looked so pretty I had to photograph it! This is a keeper.

Best cornbread ever. I've made it 20+ times and always get raves. I follow recipe exactly but watch cooking time, as it's usually done early.

I got a late night cornbread craving and this fit the bill! I did change the recipe a bit - I ran out of honey, so I used some sugar. I also cut the butter in half (I was eating it alone after all!!) and it was still very moist.

I thought it this made a moist, marvelous cornbread. I liked the texture, and enjoyed the fragrance the butter and especially the honey gave it. It was a pretty decadent cornbread, all the moreso because I served it with good maple syrup. (I like my cornbread more sweet than savory). I might reduce the butter to 1/3 cup next time, or swapping some of the butter for a healthier fat, because it was pretty oily (deliciously so, but still). I used a medium-grind polenta for the cornmeal (its what I had), a mix of 1% and half-&-half. At 17 min I checked on it and thought it was browning a bit quickly, so I turned the oven down to 375* for the last 5 min of cooking.

the flavors are delicious & compliment a spicy bowl of chili wonderfully. it does cook quickly, so watch that oven. :)

I cheated the recipe in so many ways, but it was still delicious. No fresh sage, but I crumbled 2 t. of sage I had dried myself this summer. I did not use any for the top. Read the reviews, reduced the honey to 1/8 c. No whole milk, used 2%. No skillet, used a heavy 10-in cake pan and didn't preheat it. Yet, success! Never ever touch a box of cornbread mix again; make this. I will aspire to get a little closer to the recipe next time.

monika425 wrote a useless review, she burned the bread, made a different recipe without one of the title ingredients and didn't like it? AMAZING. I like this recipe a lot. I have made it a number of ways, sometimes I put in more honey and make it more of a corn cake. The sage is really lovely.

Rating: 1
Cornbread was burnt around the edges, not sweet enough and just bland and boring. I did change the cornmeal to 1 1/2 cups with 1/2 cup of flour as suggested by another reader and did not use sage as I am not a sage fan. However, bread just had no taste. I will use it to make stuffing where I can add flavors.

Rating: 4
Wow a winner! Used 1/2 whole wheat flower and 1/2 white. next time I will use all whole wheat as it gave it a nice nutty texture. I also used 1/2 cup half & half, along with 1% milk. Also, think it was a tad sweet, so might cut the honey down a bit the next time.

Sooo yummy! I make this alot (now by request) & everyone loves it - I don't know how many times I have passed this recipe on! I generally add extra sage!!

Rating: 2
This recipe was good, but not great by any means. Perhaps the sage makes this marvelous, but mine wasn't. I omitted the sage, used half and half for the milk, and a little over 1/2 c. butter. I wanted a decadent cornbread (with grilled salmon and kidney beans, something had to be bad for me today!). I used high quality honey, fresh wheat flour, decent cornmeal, and good quality butter. There was no lacking on the ingredient's part. I also added some almond extract to give it a little difference. It lacked the roughness of cornbread i was hoping for, which is surprising. Next round, I'll use regular lavender honey, 1 1/2 c cornmeal to 1/2 c flour. Perhaps try it with cream (if i'm feeling glutinous), and do a honey wash for the top just as it's finishing. Sage isn't my favorite, but lavender should be a good substitute. Will try next round. =]

Agreed with the previous reviewers who said this was both too sweet and did not have enough cornmeal in comparison with the flour. I would adjust to have a higher cornmeal to flour ratio, use less baking powder, and less honey. I was hesitant to make it with less honey because I have quite a sweet tooth and several reviewers thought it was a good amount, but after making it I would say for sure less honey! This really is too sweet and too fluffy.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and very easy! We thought the ratio of flour to cornmeal was too high, but it tasted great. Didn't have a skillet but it baked nicely in a 10-inch pyrex pie platter. However, if I don't use a skillet next time, I will definitely set the sage leaves on top rather than on the bottom. When you pour the batter they get moved around anyway; I had to rearrange them before serving.

I simplified the recipe a little and made less-elegant corn bread muffins for a weeknight family dinner. Delicious! Read the whole story at http://mommyporch.blogspot.com/2010/11/honey-sage-cornbread-muffins.html

I went easy on the honey (1/4 cup) and found it plenty sweet. Tasty, but I found it a way too buttery (I feel greasy after eating it). I'm going to try with about 1/2 the butter next time. I think with some tweaks, this is a winner.

wanted to love it, but thought it was just o.k. texture was good, but taste lacked.

I didn't use the skillet. Sprayed pam in a 10" dish. Mixed melted, cooled butter into the milk/egg mixture then folded that into the corn/flour. However, I dipped whole sage leaves in the melted butter before hand, and then laid them in a decorative pattern, on top of the batter once I poured that in the dish. Baked it exactly 22 minutes and it came out perfect. The sage leaves did not burn. Cut it into wedges. Served with Black Bean Soup with Cumin & Jalepeno. Wonderful!

Edible beauty! I recommend a fine grind cornmeal. I felt like the meal was somewhat of a distraction. Very moist and the whole sage leaves on top made this a very festive looking dish.

I'm sitting here eating this now and I've got to say it is amazing. I've never had cornbread before (!) so i wasn't quite sure what to expect but I'm definitely a fan now.The sweetness of the honey is just enough to prevent the bread from being too bland and the sage compliments it well. Easy snack to take to work!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I've made this a few times now. The bread is moist and just sweet enough and sage is really delicious. The last time, I didn't have sage, so I substituted dried oregano, giving the oregano a little time to soak in the egg mixture before I combined it with the dry ingredients. The oregano was as good as the sage. Wonderful recipe.

Rating: 3
Perhaps a bit too sweet (1/3 cup honey would probably be enough), but very nice texture and flavour. Recipe makes about 42 mini-muffins (1 tablespoon of mixture per mini-muffin). Ground dried sage also works if you can't get fresh. I substituted maple syrup for honey, which is also nice.

2.5 stars. This is good but I like my cornbread with more cornmeal. My husband liked it very much. The sage is terrific, particularly the fried pieces on the outside.

I just made a version for a gluten-free friend subbing brown rice flour for the all-purpose but otherwise keeping it the same. I was worried about the substitution as I normally don't cook gluten-free, but I sampled a little piece before sending it off and it was really good. Plus, I got to use my cast iron skillet, which is always fun!

I did not have sage (made the recipe without it) and used Country Crock instead of butter. Like another reviewer, I have been looking for the keeper cornbread recipe for a few years and this is it. Just a little sweet, a nice crumb (not too cakey), and neither not too moist nor tood dry. I think the butter/margarine on the bottom of the skillet really add a nice texture to the crust.

Rating: 4
After over-complicating the process for years in search of the perfect cornbread this recipe is the easiest and, by far, the most delicious I've ever made. I did add one cup of corn kernels to the batter (dusted with flour to keep them suspended) but otherwise followed the recipe. This will now be my official cornbread recipe.

Rating: 4
The most delicious cornbread! I made this to serve as an accompaniment to my delicious turkey chili, which has a touch of sweetness, for a Super Bowl party. Instead of whole milk, I used low-fat buttermilk. Instead of 1 whole stick of unsalted butter, I used half of a stick. This was a great way to use the beautiful sage from my garden. Everyone loved this... even those who aren't normally fans of cornbread. It was so moist & tasty!

3.5 stars. I made two batches of this to bring to a party the other night. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I had to use two different pans as I don't have a cast iron skillet. The first batch was made in a stainless steel pan and it looked just like the picture. The sage leaves adhered beautifully to the cornbread - very pretty presentation. I made the second batch in an aluminum skillet. It browned much better than the first batch, but the sage leaves were all over the place. Didn't matter as I ended up taking them off. I preferred the browner batch, but both were great. Everyone complimented me on the dish and I would make them again. Do look for whole grain corn. I found it at Whole Crooks, I mean Food!

Crazy how I added honey and sage to a box of Jiffy, melted butter in a pyrex in the oven and poured the batter over that and it came out INCREDIBLE!! Needless to say, I am a fan of these additions to cornbread!

Wow, this is a great recipe. So moist and buttery. It was very easy to make and looked beautiful after it came out of the pan. I used a stainless skillet and it worked beautifully. Our guests raved. I only had finely ground cornmeal, but the end result was so delicious that it didn't seem to matter. Cooking it in the skillet gives it rustic texture anyway. The sage leaves were absolutely delicious!

This was very easy and pretty and tasted goodnot great. I followed the recipe to the letter except I added 1/4 c. sour cream to moisten the mix, as well as cooking it 5 minutes less than called for and I think that helped somewhat. Used beautiful sage leaves from my garden and if I made this again I'd add even more to the bread. Overall, a good recipe.

I usually prefer savory cornbreads, but this recipe won me over completely. Sweet without being sugary and the sage/honey is a dynamite flavor combo -- I'm converted! As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the butter by about one-third (and I also used 2% milk instead of whole) and it was still incredibly rich with a golden, buttery crust. This recipe is going into permanent rotation.

This bread is so flavorful and moist! My family loved it. I will definately make it again. Be careful pulling the skillet out of the oven, I burnt my hand a little bit. I served it with the sweet potato and black bean soup. Warm and cozy on a winter nite....

This cornbread was AMAZING. I left out the sage b/c I didn't have any, but the rest of the recipe was great by itself. I would use a milder, more generic honey next time (all I had was some nice raspberry honey from the farmer's market) b/c the honey was very perfumey, and it dominated the flavor. Totally a keeper recipe though!!

Super good! Followed the recipe exactly, baked in cast iron skillet - and my entire family loved it. Especially the crunchy sage leaves on the crust. I'm sure this would be very good without any sage, but it would be completely different. Make it with the sage at least once. Excellent!

Yum!! The sage leaves on the bottom were still green after cooking. It may have been because I used a glass pie dish (I didn't have a cast iron skillet). Anyway, I thought the cornbread was fabulous. I might have to fry up the rest of my sage in some butter, it tasted so good.

Delicious! More trouble than ordinary cornbread but worth it if you have a little extra time. This stays moist for a long time and is good reheated by toasting with some butter even a week later.

I served this with chili on halloween night. It got excellent reviews. I made a few substitutions. I used buttermilk and did not put the sage leaves on the bottom, just chopped them really fine and put them in the batter. I used an 8" skillet as that was all I had, the batter needs to be cooked about 7 minutes longer but it worked out fine with the smaller pan. Will make this again!

Even though I made this without the sage and used a round cake pan, this cornbread was absolutely delicious! It had a very nice texture and a beautiful buttery-crisp top (which is actually the bottom). I did leave about 2 tablespoons of butter in the pan even though I didn't use the sage. This is a keeper!

This is fantastic. The texture is great, the flavour is rich with just the right amount of sweetness. I did not have any fresh sage on hand so I substituted with fresh chives from the garden. Next time tho, I will definitely try it with sage - I think it would make it even better. And using a cast iron skillet, the crust on top with the browned butter is just divine!

I'm constitutionally incapable of making a recipe exactly as written, but my tweaks were relatively minor and may be of interest to others. Even without them, this is still a fabulous recipe and one of the best cornbreads out there. I was serving this with chili so I wanted a little more of a savory flavor and I couldn't find any fresh sage. Also I was using an 11" round baking dish that was deeper than a skillet. Here's what I did: 1) reduced honey to 1/3 cup 2) added 1/3 cup sour cream to milk 3) used two eggs & increased flour and cornmeal to 1/3 cup each. 4) substituted 2 tsp. chopped fresh cilantro and 1 tsp. snipped fresh chives for the sage, did not use leaves on bottom of pan. Served to my fiance and 4 guests who all said it was the best cornbread they'd ever had and went beautifully with the chili. One note: Next time I make this, I will smooth the top of the bread down with a spatula and try brushing it with melted butter after about 5 minutes in the oven. The top looked a bit bumpier and grainier than I'd expected and I think this might create a more pleasing appearance.

Simple recipe & very good! Boyf loved it, too. The honey, butter & sage flavors are a delicious (though slight) variation on the recipe I've used for years - printed on the cornmeal box! =) I may or may not bother with the sage leaves on the bottom of the pan again, though I did solve the migration problem people described. They turned kinda brown as they baked, much less pretty than the photo here - still a nice look, but not when I was envisioning the light sage green color against the golden yelow cornbread. I avoided the leaves scooting around by not using a skillet - I buttered a 9" round cake pan and pressed the leaves into the butter. I then carefully spooned the batter over each leaf, and gently poured in the rest once all leaves were covered. For a homey, easy meal, I served it with steamed brocc and S&Ped, buttered chicken breasts with sage leaves tucked under the skin, as suggested in the Nov 07 Bon Appetit. Word to the wise, though - it'll take the chicken 40 mins to cook, not 20, as the article suggested - so plan your dinner accordingly! Overall, a speedy, yummy recipe and one I'll certainly make over and over.

I made this for me and my boyfriend on New Year's Day. I love southern cornbread (unsweetened, no flour) and he loves the cakey sweet stuff. I modified this recipe by using half the honey, and 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup flour. I also only used half the butter. It came out great though, we both loved it!

To the cook from Hamilton, I doubt there is any way that you made it correctly if you didn't notice any sage flavor. This recipe it outstanding. Like everyone else, all my sage leaves migrated to the edges of the pan, but who cares, because all the butter still had the sage essence. My husband LOVED this. Served it with roasted garlic jelly for dinner, and sweet butter for breakfast.

One of the better cornbreads I've made. My wife thought it was the best. Very moist and flavorful. I had no trouble with the sage leaves staying put and their flavor was a delicate addition. The only fault is the amount of servings - we only got four!

To adjust to 12" skillet, you could increase all the ingredients by 1/3 (eg. the cornmeal would be 1 1/3 cups). But two warnings: it's hard to split an egg into thirds, and (without having made this recipe), it maybe more fragile to try to turn it out of the pan due to the increased size.

Good but not great. The sage leaves all migrate to the edges of the pan and need to be reassembled. They just rest on the cornbread and are not attractive. I did not actually notice much sage flavour.

A 12" skillet is 44% bigger than a 10" skillet, so I would increase all ingredients by 50% (adding an egg white instead half an egg). Cooking time should be similar.

This is such a great cornbread recipe, very fragrant. Although the sage leaves on the bottom of the pan turned brown... it wasn't really attractive to serve turned upside down, but it is very tasty. I also made it with chopped serrano peppers instead of sage, which was equally as good.

How would I adapt this recipe for a 12" cast iron skillet?
