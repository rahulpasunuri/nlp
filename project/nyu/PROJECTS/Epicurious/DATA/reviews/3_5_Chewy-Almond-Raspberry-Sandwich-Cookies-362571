GREAT recipe! easy to make, relatively healthy, and so delicious! I learned the hard way: it is better to let the cookies cool off completely before removing from baking sheet, or they will break. Some modifications: I made them into small discs, and sprinkled almond slices on top. I did not use parchment paper, but greased the cookie sheet. Some of the best cookies I've ever tasted! I'll be making these again and again...

I love this recipe. I have made it about 5 times. It is also great as a gluten free dessert. The cookies also freeze well. Will continue to make these addicting chewy delights.

My first review and this cookie deserves it. My kids loved it. I did it exactly as suggested and did find that it was messy and much was wasted in the plastic bag, so I will use the spoon next time and sprinkle on top instead of piping. Otherwise the taste and texture were perfect.

I'm not sure why people think this recipe is time consuming, but I've made this recipe a few times and thought it was very fast and easy. You just have to put everything in the food processor, which takes just a few minutes. I followed the recommendations of the other reviewers and just spooned the batter on the baking sheets and then sprinkled the almonds. It takes no time and the cookies are delicious and very pretty. I took these to a holiday party and everyone raved about them and my husband is always asking me to make them for him.

I was very pleased with this recipe. They were very impressive on a cookie tray and they were a big hit at my cookie exchange. In fact, I made them twice. I found that the dough was easier to work with if I chilled it for a few hours in the refrigerator. Also, I found my small offset spatula indispensable for flipping them over and picking them up. I could also put the spatula in the palm of my hand to shape them and make them straighter. I made mine a little shorter than suggested, and I ended up using at least twice as many almonds as called for. With the second batch, I found that my almond paste was not as fresh. I think it had been on my shelf for several months. It produced a drier and more chewy cookie, which was disappointing. Mixing the ingredients was a breeze. I'm not sure why one of the first reviewers had such a problem. This recipe will definitely be a part of my Christmas-cookie repertoire for years to come, along with Spoon Cookies, of course.

Dough was very mushy and was very difficult to form the long oval, mine ended up all different shapes. If I were to make these again, I would just go with drops to make rounds. Nice taste and texture, but too much of a mess.

I just finished making these cookies. I also agree that the batter be spooned onto the baking sheet rather than using the plastic bag as you will lose alot of the batter and end up with fewer cookies. I also agree that sprinkling the almonds instead of rolling will not waste alot of the almonds. Two cups of almonds are needed as well. Otherwise the cookies are tasty

"That's a great cookie." This is what my husband said after the first bite. I agree. BUT... they need to be half the size, as others have said. I started it 1.5 hours ago and have been done for 10 minutes, and I am not a speedy cook. I agree with others that you need 2 cups of almonds. And they are a bit of a potchke (Yiddish for fussy), but worth it.

These are very good... I will follow the other reviewer's advice and not roll them in almonds...just sprinkle on top...gets expensive. I will add more cinnamon. and I would suggest they be rounds..easier to work with.

All my taste testers tell me to make them again. I wasn't sure I liked the cinnamon taste. See all the notes below. Two egg whites for me did equal a quarter cup. Two cups of sliced almonds is probably ideal. I think they're too big and would probably either do rounds or just shorter strips. Gives you more finished cookies. I will use a different jelly rather than raspberry. They are soft, so use a spatula.

I have made these cookies three times and each time is better than the last. The sugar and the almond paste need to be thoroughly mixed together before the egg whites are added. The third time I made them I actually measured the egg whites, and it turns out that 2 egg whites is considerably more than 1/4 cup which will really change the consistency of mix. I placed little mounds of the sliced almonds on the parchment lined cookie sheet and used a spoon to mound little drops of the mix on the almonds. I used a wet finger to slightly shape the mix and placed a few almonds on top before baking. The rest is as the recipe is printed. These are very tasty cookies and very much worth the effort.

These cookies are large, delicious and NOT difficult to make with some modifications. They take under 2 hours to make (using 2 large trays)and that includes a very easy clean up! Consider piping smaller straight lines or small rounds on top of the almonds and sprinkle or pat the rest on top of the dough. Slide a small, thin spatula or knife under each cookie to transfer to a SILPAT lined tray. Let the cookies cool on a rack with only the SILPAT for 5 minutes or until cool. (Remove the tray.) Use 2 cups of sliced almonds as 1 1/2 cups are not enough. I used air-cushion cookie sheets and the cookies took 14 minutes to bake.

I did these cookies three times. They were the favorite of a recent cookie baking party I hosted -- but in the end I significantly adjusted the process: I squirted the dough into round blobs directly onto parchment paper rather than 2 1/2 inch strips, and I sprinkled almonds on top because the process of rolling and transferring was messy and the cookies were too big. Let the cookies completely cool before removing them from the parchment or they stick. The first time I didn't measure the egg white (just used 2 eggs) and the cookies were puffier than in the picture - but if you squeeze less dough for smaller cookies, puffy would be fine. And I liked the canned almond paste (8 oz) better than the tube (7 oz). Love only having 4 ingredients plus jam.

These cookies taste delicious, but are NOT worth the time or cost. It may be helpful to cool the almond paste prior to grinding. Part way through grinding, the blade on our food processor stopped moving (likely due to accumulated almond paste below the blade). Since the food processor wasn't working, we decided to use our blender and grind in batches. This worked; however, it overworked the blender and we're now in the market for a new one. Our cookies turned out a little bigger than the picture. We cut each cookie in half with a pizza cutter and made sandwiches with the two halves. We doubled the recipe, but only ended up with around 30 cookies. We probably would've saved time and spent the same amount of money by going to a bakery and finding a comparable cookie. We will not be making these again.

Delicious!! Don't even try to roll them - I just sprinkled the tops with almonds and used a sharp edge to transfer.

This recipe is definitely not worth the time and mess. The dough was too runny to really roll around the almonds and then pick up. I tried chilling the dough but that didn't help. The cookies were really soft after the baking, whereas I was expecting them to be crispy. They taste good but not what I was expecting.
