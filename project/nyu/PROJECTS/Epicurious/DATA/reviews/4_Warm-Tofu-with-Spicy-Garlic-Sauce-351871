I'm not a huge fan of tofu at all, but I decided to try it since I love soy & sesame. I used light firm tofu and steamed it whole, then cut the block into 12 slices and spooned some of the sauce over. It was really good and absorbed the sauce well. My only complaint is that the sauce was salty-perhaps I should have used reduced sodium soy sauce. I added some water and some rice wine vinegar, and it was perfect. This is a great light dinner or accompaniment to a meal.

Great taste, fast and easy to assemble, needs no cooking.

I made this with firm tofu. I was happy that the recipe didn't call for frying (no need for extra oil). I cut the tofu in big chunks and although I loved the sauce, I wish it would be all over the tofu. I actually used 1.5 packages which is more than what the recipe calls for, so I have lots left over. Also, I used leftover sesame salt from a quail egg recipe on this site (finally, it's almost finished...) which basically consists of ground toasted sesame seeds with a very small amount of salt. I don't know what korean hot red-pepper flakes are; I just used some dried chilli peppers and cut them up. Leaving it in the fridge for tomorrow and hoping that marinating in the sauce will help. Dunno what my family thought of this as they were much more interested in the bean salad I had also made. Also, I've recently started buying local organic garlic, and found it is amazingly fresh compared to the regular ones from the store (I found out that at least some of them are shipped from China). The first time I saw a fresh head of garlic was when I was in Iran a year ago, and I was amazed. In my experience you can never crush those "conventional" garlics to a paste, they will sort-of squish apart into long fibrous pieces (of course if they've been hanging around your kitchen a while it will be worse, but it turns out they are old to start with!). If you really want to be able to make your garlic into a paste, and if you want fresh taste, go for local. It seems to be several times the cost around here though...

I wasn't sure if my family would go for steamed tofu, so I stir fried it with a touch of sesame oil in the oil. After that, I used to hot pan to mash and roast the garlic since raw garlic doesn't agree with me. I also doubled the sauce with a low sodium soy sauce. I served it with sauted snow peas and mushrooms and brown rice. A definite keeper, but I will have to try the steamed tofu next time.

I was surprised at how good this was! The sauce was delicious and garlicky, and the poached tofu had a nice texture. I went with the suggestion offered by other reviewers and doubled the scallions. Although I can see how it might be too salty as a standalone dish, it worked well over soba dressed with a little sesame oil and with a side of napa cabbage slaw dressed with sesame oil and rice vinegar. I think the noodles diluted the salt and the vinegar in the slaw was a nice foil for the very garlicky tofu. Nice easy healthy weeknight meal.

Pretty good. Used extra firm tofu and doubled the scallion. I agree with some other reviews that it was a bit too salty, but I think that can be easily remedied by using low sodium soy sauce next time. Served with quinoa and sautéed bell peppers.

delightful recipe..i added some freshly grated ginger, additional garlic and a bit of chopped cilantro...i also found the sauce a tad too salty, so i thinned it out with some sake. i think the key to getting the sauce to infuse is to get as MUCH water out of the poached tofu as possible. i used many paper towels to do so. i love the soft, creamy texture of the poaching. I served it with brown rice and braised baby bok choy (from this site), adapted just a bit, as always. really fast, easy meal. the brown rice took longer than anything to cook, but the rice cooker made that a snap too.

Very flavourful! This tofu is also great marinated overnight in the fridge and can be eaten warm or cold. I've made it with both extra firm and medium firm tofu, and both are good.

i was completely surprised by this recipe. poaching the tofu gave it a really nice texture. i sliced it and let it marinate in the sauce for about an hour and served at room temperature with sesame peanut noodles. it wasn't WOW (thus only 3 forks), but it was good and i was happy to serve it to company.

This recipe was really good. I don't like tofu and my partner loves pork, so we substituted hunks of braised pork belly for the tofu. SO DELICIOUS! I am going to make it again tonight!!!

I love this recipe. This is now in the top two of my tofu recipes. I made the sauce as written but instead of steaming the tofu in water I steamed it in the sauce, turning occasionally so that it was glazed on all sides. This made it absolutely delicious. My meat loving husband had seconds!

Love this tofu recipe! This is one of my favorite ways to cook tofu, and the best part is how wonderfully simple it is. A great dish to cook when you don't want to spend hours cooking, and it tastes wonderful! I definitely recommend adding more garlic to your liking.

I don't get it, seems like it turned out great for everyone but I found it too salty. The flavours were strong which was perfect for bland tofu but I'm still trying to see what the big deal was. Did I miss a step? May try again.

While the gentle boiling gave the tofu a nice texture, we felt the sauce was too spicy and lacked depth of flavor. It didn't really sink into the tofu much either, leaving it mostly flavorless. It looks like this is a very popular recipe, so perhaps we just have different tastes than our fellow tofu-eaters.

I really, really like this recipe! This is the first tofu recipe I've made that is not only edible but delicious! Next time, I will roast the garlic just so it's not so strong. I love garlic but was still tasting it next day, lol!

This recipe was amazing!! We absolutely loved it. When making it we doubled the garlic and it was perfect. For our family it was more like 3 or 4 servings rather than eight, but if you had this in addition to one or two others it could serve eight.

Tofu, just boiled? It's not the way I usually serve tofu, but with this sauce (with double the garlic), it was elegant and delicious. I served it over lightly sauteed bok choy seasoned with a bit of mirin. Instead of rice, I made quinoa in a miso broth; once it had cooked up, I tossed in some soaked hijiki seaweed (which had been tossed with a bit of sesame oil and soy sauce). Looked good on the plate and made for a lovely light dinner.

This dish is a great way to please people who normally don't like tofu. Two of my family members are definitely not fans of tofu, but even they agreed that the sauce really made it palatable. I substituted red onions for the scallions, and it turned out well. I also didn't have any sesame seeds, but the sesame oil worked perfectly. This dish is wonderful with a little spicy kick! Frying the tofu is an alternative I might try next time. :)

This recipe was quick and easy!! Made it for my vegetarian guest when we were serving a whole Pork Shoulder (from Momofuku cookbook) and everyone (veg & non-veg) loved it! Changes I made: 1. Didn't have korean peppers, so just used a good dollop of sriracha instead. 2. The soft tofu I bought was very thick, so I sliced it width-wise through the middle for two thinner pieces, and followed the recipe cues to a tee - turned out perfect. Made a little extra sauce so there was enough to cover twice the surface area. 3. Garnished it with shitake mushrooms sautee in sesame oil ginger, garlic, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar... it matched the tofu dish perfectly and when eaten with the tofu the texture mix was awesome.

I rarely review recipes, but this one was a real winner and I want to share the good news. Something about this recipe ends up feeling very sophisticated even though it's very simple. My girlfriend and I make some version of this recipe as a quick dinner almost every week and yet it's totally suitable for a dinner party. And the colors are great. I wish all my plates looked this great. I've started using the sauce in other recipes too. Tonight, I used the same sauce on a bowl of rice, lightly stir fried vegetables and a poached egg.

I liked this very much but the soy sauce taste was a little too strong. I added a little extra toasted sesame oil.

Since I made so many changes, I'm not rating this recipe. I only had extra firm tofu and so I cut it into chunks and fried it in a combo of "Smart" veggie oil and sesame oil with black pepper. Then I drained the tofu and stir-fried the veggies I had in the same oil: orange bell pepper, asparagus, green beans, carrots, and broccoli. Then, drained off the oil, and mixed it all with the sauce. For the sauce, I double everything, subbed sesame oil for seeds, Sriracha pepper sauce for red pepper flakes, and added sliced baby bella mushrooms and extra garlic. I also added chicken broth to stretch the sauce further. We served the whole thing over brown rice and had fresh pineapple for dessert. I'd give my version 3/4 forks. Next time, I'll try following the recipe. :)

Definitely a keeper of a recipe. I combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a small sauce pan (except for the scallions) and heat the sauce through over medium heat. Then after the sauce is warm I add the scallions. Worth the extra step.

My husband and I both loved this dish. Tasty and very quick and easy to make.

This is a very tasty, quick, simple recipe. I made steamed rice to go with the tofu, and instead of simmering the tofu in a separate pot, I used the steamer basket that came with my rice cooker. The tofu was warmed through by the time the rice was cooked. I may cut down on the raw garlic the next time I make this, which will be very soon!

I'd cook this again, but I think next time, I'd marinate the tofu in the sauce for awhile as the tofu didn't pick up as much flavor as I would have liked. My guests enjoyed it as a side dish though.

3.5 stars, really, since it's such a quick and simple snack to prepare. I made it as noted, and I think that boiling (vs. frying or searing, as many reviews suggest) adds a nice feel of freshness along with the obvious health benefits. I would add extra chopped scallions, otherwise this is a go-to snack as written.

The only changes I made were to slice and saute the tofu in butter/oil blend until golden brown rather than boil as directed and I used regular red pepper flakes because that is what I had. It was so yummy. Served over rice with side of steamed mixed veggies. Spicy and flavorful without being overly hot this is now on our regular dinner menu rotation.

I doubled the sauce thinking that there wasn't enough but ended up with an exceptionally spicy dish. It was still amazing though. Really easy and delicious. Also used firm tofu and normal paper flakes and put some of the sauce over rice and broccoli. Everything was great. I would definitely make this one again!

I have had bad experiences cooking tofu in the past but this time it went just right. I used extra firm tofu and regular red pepper flakes and it was delicious (and spicier than I anticipated). I am not a very experienced cook and found it easy and quick to make.

Have made this twice now, once exactly as directed except sauteed tofu. 2nd time sauteed red onion, green and red bell pepper in wok 1st, then set aside and sauteed chopped/cubed eggplant, then sauteed tofu (make sure you rinse and dry well prior to sauteeing if you don't want it falling apart). Then made sauce on the side, added just a shot of hot chili oil, didn't use sesame seeds. Added everything back into wok and poured sauce over it and let simmer a couple of minute to let flavors infiltrate veggies and tofu. Served with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. Picky boyfriend went back for seconds...that's how I always know a recipe is a keeper!!

Amazing recipe. I substituted togarashi for the red pepper flakes (had it in the pantry) and it was great. Served over rice with a sliced avocado and some sauted greens. I was a bit concerned that there wouldn't be enough sauce to flavor such a large chunk of tofu, but it was incredibly intense. I love how quickly it came together -- the rate-limiting step was waiting for the rice to steam.

I cannot believe how easy and delicious this simple recipe is. I have had the misconception that one must bake or saute tofu to make it taste good and this complimentary sauce proved me wrong.

This recipe was great! I have to admit, I was a little skeptical of boiling tofu, since I've only ever stir-fried or grilled it before. But this turned out wonderfully well, and the sauce was delicious. My only changes were that I used extra virgin olive oil and regular hot red pepper flakes. Also, I couldn't find soft tofu so I used firm, and the texture was very nice with the sauce soaking into it. I've been trying to include more soy into my diet, and this recipe is definitely a keeper. My only mistake was that I paired it with Chinese Broccoli (also on Epicurious) but the flavors were too similar. Better to pair it with rice and steamed veggies, or something sweet, such as sweet potatoes.

This dish was ridiculously quick and so delicious. I served it on a bed of greens and we licked up the plate. I think the sauce would be good on many dishes.

So easy! The whole family can enjoy this dish because the flavor intensity can be controlled by how much sauce each individual decides to use. Keep in mind that the beauty of this recipe comes through when you let the warm, moist tofu melt and distribute spicy, salty-sweet sauce through the dish. I piled a bit of asparagus (green beans are nice too) on the top of the tofu before adding the sauce. Makes a great leftover lunch too!

This was very, very tasty and like others have noted couldn't be easier. I used silken extra firm tofu because that's what i had and it seemed to work, but I will use what the recipe calls for next time and see the difference. I had it with rice as a main dish, but I can see it would work great as a side dish too. The sauce is a definite keeper!

Always looking for ways to dress up tofu, and this fit the bill. Adding this to the weekly weeknight rotation. Husband loved it. Kids loved it. The sesame seed and the hard-to-find (at least for me) Korean pepper flakes make this sing. Scored my pepper flakes from a colleague. Do not use regular old pepper flakes. You'll miss out on all the fun. I used half of the suggested amt of flakes since I wanted my kids to eat it.

This dish is easy and wonderful. It's great on its own as an appetizer, but for a light meal I cubed the finished tofu and served it over shredded romaine lettuce, with a bit of extra sauce added on top. Not traditional, but a nice mix of greens and flavor. I'm sure it would also be great over rice (but probably with a vegetable side dish to balance out the plate).

Normally, I wouldn't review a recipe when I made this many changes, but I will since there aren't any other reviews yet. Changes: Used firm tofu (soft not available), sauteed garlic, added two large handfuls of green beans, halved hot pepper flakes. Served with rice for our weekly vegetarian meal, and I thought it was tasty.
