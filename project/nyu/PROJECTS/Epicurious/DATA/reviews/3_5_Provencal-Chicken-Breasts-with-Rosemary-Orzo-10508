I don't get the high ratings on this dish. I sauteed the leeks and garlic (added some extra) after I browned the chicken, then deglazed, then added all the rest of the ingredients plus some dried oregano and basil, then reduced the sauce before adding back the chicken. It was still pretty boring and I won't make it again.

Made this for dinner night before last with a few changes: substituted onions for the leeks, used diced tomatoes and left in the juice from the can, and left out the olives because i didn't have any. Overall it was good and easy to make. My husband and son both liked it as well. The chicken was moist and the sauce was tasty. I served it over the orzo which I found slightly lacking somehow. I would make this again though.

I have made this dish countless times with and without the olives. One thing of note is how acidic it is. To balance it, add some sugar and taste as you go to make sure you are pleased. Also, New Zealand Sav. Blanc is great because they really seem to hold up better than anything else to the acidity of OJ and tomatoes. And, yes, it gets better as the days go by so cook ahead!

This is very flavorful. I can really taste the wine in the sauce.

This is great for company because it tastes much better the next day. You can make it a day ahead so that on the day of your dinner all you have to do is worry about the sides and other details. I make this recipe all the time.

I thought this recipe was delightful. Since some cooks thought it was bland I substituted stronger flavors of lemon zest instead of orange zest and diced yellow onion for leeks, and I cooked the dish in stages. I added the garlic and the citrus zest with the deglazing wine. When that reduced I added the broth and onions. Only after that had reduced did I add the browned chicken and tomatoes. The chicken was moist and the tomatoes made a lovely sauce over the accompanying rosemary orzo. I also included a side of steamed asparagus tossed with a little butter herbed with fresh thyme.

After reading so many "better next day" comments, I made this 24 hours before I served. I thought is was ok, not too salty, but no big flavors. However, my husband, who doesn't care for chicken really liked it. Would make it again in a pinch, but would punch it up somehow.

It's easy, tasty and pleasing to the eye, what more could one ask for. Good for a week night or company.

This recipe was excellent. I stayed very faithful to the recipe, but I crushed the tomatoes directly into the pan because I like hands-on cooking. The boyfriend loved it and asked me to make it again. The sauce was great the next day with crusty bread or over couscous.

This dish was very good. I listen to the reviews and as I added the tomatoes and wine,(which I increased to 3/4 cups) found that there was really enough liquid so I only ended up putting in 1/4 cup of the chicken stock. I also mixed in parsley with my garlic to make it more provencal style. I didn't have an orange so I used lemon zest and the olives I used had also been seasoned with some lemon. The dish was also really taste the next day. I will be making this again.

I'd agree that this dish is a bit bland - but after eating the leftovers I changed my mind. It's definitely better after sitting for awhile.

I totally changed the recipe to use ingredients on hand. Excellent. I used lime instead of wine & fresh rosemary & thyme. I left out the chicken stock, leeks, tomatoes, olives & orange. I will definitely make the revised recipe again.

This is a great base recipe that needs a few additions. I left out the chicken broth and then boosted flavor with rosemary and oregano - AWESOME!

My husband gave this dish three stars but I'm giving it two. This was disapointing, thought it to be a bit bland.

Rating: 2
This was okay, a bit disappointing based on all the great reviews. If I make this next time, I will not add any chicken broth. It is not necessary. I will also saute the garlic, orange zest and leeks separately w/ tomotoes before adding it to the chicken.

This was ok. I don't think I'd bother making it again, though. A little boring.

This recipe was great if you tweek it a bit. I used cornish game hens instead of the breasts. Split them in half and work with them the same as with the brests. Use fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Start the vegies cooking for about 3-4 min before putting in the chicken. Cook without the lid on the pan. Finally Cook for longer than the 15 min. The game hens took almost 25 min. Watch the bottom of the pan since cooking this dish on High heat tends to come close to burning. The dish in general is a great rustic tasting dish with lots of mellow well blended flavors. One last thing. If you have fresh herbs slip them in under the skin of the birds. Yum

This recipe was perfect for a mid-summer dinner. Next time I make it, though, I will reduce the amount of chicken stock even more than I did this time. I served this dish with rosemary potatoes and French bread as opposed to the orzo.

sorry to be the voice of dissent but I thought this dish was awful. The result tasted like tomatoes and nothing else. After reading previous comments I cut the amount of broth down to 1/2 c and the result was still watery and ran all over the plate. I would imagine that without the tomatoes this would be quite good or perhaps with fresh tomatoes which have a milder taste?

This recipe was fantastic, quick, and healthy!! Seeing as we finished the white wine the previous night, I substituted vermouth for the wine. It did a fine job deglazing the pan, as well as added a tasty, dryness to the dish. I also added some red pepper flakes for a little 'zip'. I plated this with the orzo and an olive boule. A definite 'will-do-again'.

I made this without the accompanying Orzo, and served with new potatoes instead. The chicken side of things ended up rather watery and I will probably not use as much chicken broth, the leeks and tomatoes were fantastic though. Best thing about this - the leftovers the next day for lunch.

Rating: 2
the chicken/sauce is good, but used spiced kalamatas which added too much sauce. quite salty at the end. orzo in italy is like bulgar grain, not little pasta points, which are called puntini here, so my boyfriend was kind of confused as to the so called 'orzo'. could be much better maybe with real orzo, which is less liquidy. i still can't figure out how this dish got so salty....

Easy and delicious. My husband and I really enjoyed this. I shredded some Asiago cheese over the orzo and that added a little extra flavor.

This dish is one of my favorites to cook. Very easy and tastes great! I don't cut back on the broth but I do simmer extra long until it isn't so watery. This really brings out the taste!

I thought this recipe was just OK. I actually chose this recipe for the rosemary orzo but ended up liking the chicken far more. No matter what I did, the orzo remained bland. I ended up adding some freshly grated parmesan cheese to it and that helped a little. If I make this again I'll probably just make the chicken and use another venue to serve it over.

Rating: 3
Light and flavorful. Works well with the rosemary orzo, especially when topped with freshly grated Pecorino Romano. I used the Nicoise olives. Glad I did. There's a bit too much liquid in the sauce. I think I will cut down on the broth next time.

This was really good - I really enjoyed it. I used it as a side dish & it added a ton of flavor. It has a nice sweetness to it - you can taste all the flavors seperately. Very nice.

This was a big hit with my family, and there were no leftovers. I made it as written except I used skinless boneless chicken breasts, which was what I had on hand. I sprinkled them with a little bit of flour and browned them in olive oil, removed them, and carried on with the recipe. Ultimately, I cut the chicken into chunks before returning it to the pot because I needed to make two very large chicken breast halves feed five. The only problem with the recipe is that it has an awful lot of liquid that needs to be boiled down. I would use no more than one cup of broth next time I make this, and there is no doubt, there will be a next time!

My husband made this as a weeknight dinner. The flavors blended wonderfully. The orange zest really added to the depth of the dish.

I should have read what Cook from Orange County said about olives overpowering the dish. I think when finished my dish was a little bit overpowered by Kalamat. Next time a I going to use a little bit less and hopefully I will find them pitted. Overall the dish tastes great, especially the next day when chicken got the chance to absorb the flavors and that rosemary orzo was a hit with me too. I would definitely recommend that dish to everybody just be carefull with the amount of olives.

Rating: 3
Orange zest and tomatoes? Yes - it works! I cheated and used onions instead of the leeks and regular black olives (I'm not a big olive fan.) Tons of sauce leftover - but that's not a bad thing. Both my husband and eleven year old loved it.

I love this dish. I have made it several times and have come up with the following variations: I use boneless chicken breast, dust them with flour, salt and pepper and brown them (few minutes each side) with olive oil in a large cast iron skillet. I then set them aside, and add a bit more olive oil to the skillet and sautee the leeks, a few cloves of garlic and some fresh thyme. I then add white wine, a can of diced tomatoes, and the orange zest (a MUST) and let it cook down a bit. Then add chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Return the chicken breasts to the skillet and simmer until cooked through. Add the oilves during the last few minutes of cooking. I then shred the chicken breasts so its all mixed together like a stew. Serve it over the rosemary orzo-- its fantastic.

my family enjoyed this recipe though I made a few substitutes: red wine vinegar for red wine, marinated artichoke hearts for leeks, lemon zest for orange zest, & basil for rosemary for the orzo side dish. Leftovers were great as well!

My husband and I thought this dish was absolutely delicious -- the flavors blended beautifully. I served it with the Rosemary Orzo which was the perfect compliment. The orange rind was so interesting in the sauce, and made the kitchen smell wonderful. The only changes I made were to use skinless, boneless chicken breasts, less than a teaspoon of minced fresh rosemary (per another reviewers suggestion) and a 3.8-oz can of sliced black olives instead of Niçoise or Kalamata olives -- I thought 1 cup of Niçoise or Kalamata olives might overpower the leeks and orange zest. I didn't find the sauce too watery at all -- I removed the chicken breasts when they were fully cooked, then let the sauce reduce a bit, then added the breasts back in until the sauce was thickened to my liking, we thought it was perfect. (To Anne from Ypsilanti, MI -- if you try it and find that feta overpowers the subtle flavors in this recipe, you might try the Pasta with Kalamata Olives and Roasted Cherry Tomato Sauce on this website. Feta is a key ingredient, and it too has olives and tomatoes and is outstanding.)

I've made this several times now and it's just wonderful. I was reluctant to use the orange rind but it adds something special to the dish that isn't overwhelming. It's a dish that's easy but special enough for company - and the rosemary orzo is to die for! My husband really wants me to sprinkle feta cheese in it - may try that next time.

Rating: 3
Very good and easy. The orange zest adds a subtle fresh flavor. I didn't have leeks so substituted a mixture of 1015 onions and shallots and sauted these in the pan before added the wine. Since I wasn't making the reosemary orzo as a side I added one tsp dried rosemary. Think this added some depth- a tbsp or so of fresh would have been divine. My sauce was rather thin (for serving over pasta) so I thickened with some tomato paste.

Rating: 4
I agree with other reviewer: even better the next day. I made it for our gourmet club and it was very well received. Next time I'll make the sauce ahead then simmer it with the chicken after it's sauteed. I wouldn't think of thickening the sauce, it's juicy but it works well with pasta (we used linguine as orzo doesn't soak up sauce that well).

Rating: 2
Although the sauce was very tasty, I had to strain it and reduce the liquid to keep it from being so watery. I added some arrowroot mixed with a few teaspoons of water for thickener. Also, I think something more should have been done to the chicken - like marinating before. When I tasted the chicken without sauce, it was too bland. I prefer sauce to be an integral part of the dish rather than a cover up. The rosemary orzo was great.

This was a very flavorful dish. I doubled the delicious sauce and added extra orange/lemon zest. It was even better the next day, so in the future, I'd prepare ahead. I'm sending this recipe to my mother, who serves chicken frequently but is bored with her chicken recipes.

What a delicious dish! The orange flavor really added an original, tasty touch. I served it with a nice Chateauneuf du Pape and the whole family loved it. I particularly liked the abudance of sauce.

My wife, who is my resident food critic, said we have to save all the sauce. I agree! I substituted cut up chicken for the breasts. The recipe makes more sauce than needed for this much chicken. In keeping with the Provencal theme, I added some sliced zucchini with the olives. I also used potato flour for a thickener. The rosemary orzo, to my taste, needs almost twice as much rosemary as the recipe calls for. The flavor was then subtly "there" with the sauce flavors. I may add some musshrooms and/or green pepper the next time.

This was a big hit. The only thing I modified was to use boneless, skinless chicken breasts, pounded flat. It lightened it up considerably. Very savory and reminiscent of summer!
