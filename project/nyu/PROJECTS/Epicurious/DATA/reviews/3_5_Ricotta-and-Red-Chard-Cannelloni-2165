Awesome. Totally quick and simple. Kids loved it. I loved it. This is a great addition to the rotation.

I have made this many times as a company worthy dish the vegetarians and meat eaters both enjoy. I prefer to use green chard for a more traditional look. It can also be prepared as a lasagne with a bit of mozzarella.

I use this recipe a lot, but never just as it is. I add meat, other vegetables, different kinds of cheeses, and vary the sauce. It's a great basis for a variety of different meals. Guests always love it. I also use fresh lasagna noodles and it becomes much less labor intensive.

Made this for my vegetarian neighbors and even my strictly meat and potato eating fiance loved it. I probably doubled the garlic and added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper but other than that I prepared it exactly according to the recipe. Wonderful!

Actually it did need something, but it can easily be vegetarian and taste good. I used Gimme Lean vegetarian sausage and parboiled the "no boil" lasagne. Added tons of garlic to the sauce and it was a decent little weeknight recipe.

This is a crummy dish, but you can make it really delish with just a few minor adjustments. First you have to at least double the amount of swiss chard. It seems like a lot, but it wilts down to almost nothing. Second, before you saute the onions and garlic, brown some Italian sausage w/casings removed. (Sorry vegetarians but this was the only thing that could save this dish in my opinion). And third, at least double and consider triple the garlic.Ricotta cheese has a really great texture, but it is Mild, so you need to jazz it up with what ever you've got. I too was doubtful about the jar of sauce, but just use a really good one, or make your own and freeze it so its on hand for just such a recipe and you are good to go. This rolling up business is pretty cool, b/c rather than fighting with your knife and cheese to slice the right sized pieces of lasagne to serve a crowd, each piece just lifts out of the baking dish in a perfect sized single portion. Love it!

We found this recipe to be VERY disappointing--bland and quite labor intensive. The primary flavor is the sauce and this is not something I would usually entrust to the pre-prepared variety. The filling was OK, but I would stuff it into jumbo shells instead to reduce the pasta to filling ratio. And I would definately make my own, more flavorful, sauce.

I'd really rate this 3 1/2 forks. This is easy to prepare and very delicious. I used the mixture to stuff the jumbo shells rather than roll in lasagna noodles but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It's a nice for company pasta dish.

Easy and good. I added the chard stems and cooked with the onions. Also used more chard than recipe said. The rolls were quite full and quite filling! Also doubled the garlic as did a previous reviewer. Didn't feel the need for all of the Parmesan on top, when using a spicy sauce.

Very easy and tasty. I used low fat ricotta to lighten up. Super easy make-ahead meal when entertaining casually.

This was a great recipe! It looked a bit difficult, but overall it was actually really simple to put together. I would definately make this for a group of 3-5 people. It's just great. One thing I will note is that I didn't add enough "salt and pepper to taste" in the ricotta mixture.

This is delicious! Very easy to make.I used nonfat ricotta and doubled the garlic.I only made half the recipe and it came out wonderfully, so it's good to know you can make as much as you need and still have it come out nicely. Try it!

Delicious. These are wonderful "lasagne rolls" that I like to serve as a main dish accompanied by tossed green salad and french bread or crusty rolls. The sauce I like to use with this is the Tomato-Sausage Sauce here at EPI, http://food.epicurious.com:80/run/recipe/view?id=4230.

I loved this recipe. It was my first time using Red Chard and this was a great "starter" dish. Although, I did make the mistake of buying the 8 oz. package of Lasagne noodles (rather than lb.) so I was a little short on noodles. Very good though. (I used Barilla Spicy Pepper sauce to give it a bit of spice).
