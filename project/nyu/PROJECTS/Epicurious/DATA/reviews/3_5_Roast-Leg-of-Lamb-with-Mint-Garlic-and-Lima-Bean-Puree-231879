I am making this for Easter again due to family demand. This is a perfect lamb recipe, what a shame the title includes "Lima Bean Puree", which I never make. My husband is a lamb-fanatic, and resists over-seasoning the lamb or trying to cover up the flavor. So this was a perfect compromise since some of our family are not lamb-crazy and the fresh mint and parsley is perfect without making the dish sweet. we are fortunate to get fresh Colorado lamb at reasonable prices, which makes this dish even better.

Made this for Easter lunch. It was very easy and overall was very tasty. I doubled the garlic as I thought 2 cloves a bit meagre and I should have halved the rosemary because the rosemary wound up being way too strong and soapy tasting. At 130F the lamb was way too rare in the middle and could have used another 5 degrees. The outside was nice and crispy and wonderful. I skipped the lima beans and served it instead with lovely spring asparagus, and because it was so cold out, some roasted sweet potatoes.

Made this last night for the regular poker party. Cooked for 1hr 30mins to attempt to get it medium but got medium well (130 degrees when tested). I used just mint and garlic for the stuffing and I would cut down a bit on the garlic the next time as its a little strong for my tastes. Next time I'm going to try apricots or peaches with herbs and a little butter for the stuffing.

First time I've butterflyed a leg of lamb and it was surprisingly easy. I cooked the lamb for 1hr 30m as my guests dont like lamb medium rare, I was hoping for pink in the center but ended up with a medium well joint of meat. Saying that it was delicious, I just used mint, oil and garlic for the stuffing and would cut down slightly on the amount of garlic in the recipe next time as it was just a little bit too much for my taste. You could have a lot of fun with this recipe, next time I think I'll puree some apricots with herbs and a little butter for the stuffing.

I made this using the listed pounds of lamb. The first reviewer used a whole leg. This would have been much better because the heat and time it was listed at to cook would take longer for that amount of meat. I cooked too much...It still was well receieved.

We made this for a Sunday night Master's Tournament Dinner for eight. It is idiot-proof and everyone wanted seconds. Thank goodness we had cooked a large boneless leg. We all like it rare so I removed the roast at 120 degrees and let it sit for fifteen minutes. Try it - you'll like it!!
