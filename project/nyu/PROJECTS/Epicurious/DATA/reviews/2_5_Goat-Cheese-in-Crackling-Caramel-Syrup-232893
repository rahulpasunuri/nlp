I made this tonight for my restaurant club and it was a major hit. I used 2:1 as suggested, but used 1/3 cup of water and 2/3 cup of brown sugar - it was amazing. I brought the syrup to a boil for a minute to thicken it some, but then I turned it down to a simmer. With the syrup still bubbling over low heat, I put the apples in and coated them like the recipe says, but I left them in the pan and let them cook and soften a little (maybe for two or three minutes) before putting them on the plate. I'm not usually a huge dessert lover, but I will definitely make this one again.

I wanted to make this to serve with a cheese course. But alas, no sugar quantity mentioned! After searching my vast cookbook collection to find a similar recipe, it still didn't get crackling hard, but it tasted good. Glad to see that Epicurious replied to the other reader's response! Will try it again.

I served this on top of a spinach- shallot- smoked almond salad dressed in balsamic vinegar with panettone toasts. We enjoyed it a lot but I prefer goat cheese recipes that are not so sweet.

I contacted Epicurious and this was their response. Thanks for getting back to me, Epicurious! --- Thank you for contacting Epicurious.com. I believe the recipe is for a simple syrup you cook until it turns caramel-colored. Therefore you would do a 2:1 ratio of sugar to water; in this case that means 1/2 cup of sugar. We hope you enjoy our site and please continue to visit.

About twice as much as you want volume of caramel. Water is only added to make it easier to make the caramel so basically all caramel is, in this case, is melted sugar. Seems very odd that they wouldn't give you a measurement though doesn't it.

How much sugar? Inquiring minds want to know!
