Eh. As noted, it needs way more spice. Ive been looking for a nice Asian slow cooker recipe, this isnt it really. Maybe Ill use pork next attempt, but overall its a good weeknight family meal.

I made this for a birthday dinner. It turned out amazing, it was a hit and was enough to feed 8 ppl. I added 1 tsp of red curry. Was surprised by the lack of heat, despite the peppers in this recipe. Will definitely make this again but not break up the lemongrass, as its fiberous plant and didn't have a food processor (blender only works so well).

Good, but as other reviewers noted, it was barely above mild in the spice department. I couldn't find kaffir lime leaves, so substituted zest from one lime. I'll make it again, but next time I'll marinate the meat in the spice paste ahead of time.

I'm going to make this again but add some spice to it. It was lacking a kick... I usually like my curry spicy and I expected the chiles to add that heat. Other than the lack of spice, the flavors were good and I served it with coconut rice. Definitely worth a try!

Really delicious! I didn't find it too fishy at all. I used 8 small Thai peppers and it was so fiery that I added another half can of coconut cream. Used light coconut milk at first and it was far too wimpy to cut the heat. Yummy.

Made this in a slow cooker...smelled delicious when I put it together in the morning but after cooking on low for the day, it smelled remarkably fishy. Normally I like the addition of fish sauce, but if I were to make this again, I think I'd cut back on the amount. Also, I have to say that the spice level was nearing incendiary. I like spicy (sriracha all but travels with me) but this one was a little much. If I made it again, I'd definately make a few changes.
