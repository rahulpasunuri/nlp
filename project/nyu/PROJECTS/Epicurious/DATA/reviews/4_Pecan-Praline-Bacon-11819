Awesome recipe! A perfect combination of sweet, salty and spicy. Start with good quality bacon and add a touch of penzey's chipotle powder and maybe even ground coffee. I entered it into a local beer 'n bacon fundraiser event last weekend and won "best creative dish" out of 30 entries.

Not a review, but a question. I assume, when you say chili powder, you mean powdered chilis, not the kind of chili powder you buy in the grocery store, that is a mixture of cayenne, cumin, garlic, oregano, etc.?

I often use a brown sugar and chipotle powder on bacon or SPAM (even camping) but the pecans caught my eye! Yum. I would use brown sugar probably before white sugar.

I made this and it came out great. I only used a small fraction of the praline powder. Definitely make sure to only cook the bacon 5 more minutes after sprinkling with the praline mixture - the sugar carmelizes very fast and helps the bacon to cook quickly.

These are amazing and so easy especially if you use disposable pans. Everyone at the shower I made these for wanted the recipe. The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 T of chipotle powder for 1/2T of chili powder.

So, this is my first review on epicurious. Its not that I haven't found fantastic recipes before ... its just that I haven't been moved by the sheer uniqueness of a recipe enough to warrant a response. All that changed when I tasted this recipe. I was skeptical at first ... but my taste testers and fellow cooks all agreed that the combination of the crispy, salty bacon with the sweetness of praline and unexpected chili powder kick was simply fantastic. You will not regret this recipe - a wonderful addition to any brunch!

Oh my God. This sounds so bizarre--just trust the good reviews and make it. My family calls these "bacon bars." I make them as a kind of appetizer when I'm cooking an elaborate meal because they take no time at all and the oven's already hot. My family just walks through the kitchen and snacks on them and don't bother me. Such a strangely delicious flavor combo--the sugar and the nuts soak up the bacon grease and make a solid, crispy, sweet, crunchy awesome snack. But cook the bacon a little longer than the recipe says if you like it crispy.

This is so good it's scary! It's eat the whole batch and lick the pan good, and criminally simple to make. This would be good wrapped around jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese.

I served this as an appetizer at a cocktail party -- cut the bacon into thirds and threaded it on 6-inch bamboo skewers before baking. A big hit and not the usual cocktail fare.

This bacon is incredible! I made it for a mother's brunch and women that don't eat were practically fighting over the last few pieces. It's salty and sweet, what could be bad.
