Two forks because I like it better with pumpernickel, and just a thin layer of dijon on the bread before spreading the chutney. Yum.

EASY to make + delicious. I made them on pumpernickle squares and garnished with green olives cut in half. They benefit from a colorful garnish of some sort.

Well I didn't use the mustard, maybe that was my problem. I didn't like this at all. Too bad I love grilled cheese sandwiches and this sounded so interesting. The chutney just completely overwhelmed the nuttiness I love from toasted cheese.

These were so good!! I used little rye party breads- toasted, and served with chili on a cool, autumn evening. Yum!! I will definitley keep this in mind for an appetizer also, but will now always make this an accompaniment to soup!

This is a really simple appetizer that tastes like you went to a lot more trouble than you did. Make sure you buy very high-quality ingredients; I use a spicy chutney and extra sharp cheddar, and just serve it on plain water crackers. Perfect.

I was very dissapointed in this recipe! It sounds amazing, but really tastes like nothing more than honey mustard and raisins on toast.

I really liked this. Be sure to toast the bread first. I've make this twice and the second time I forgot to toast the bread first and it wasn't as good. Also I used only 1 tsp. mustard instead of 1-1/2. I'll make this again and again.

A fantastic way to introduce someone to chutney. next time I will have to double the recipe! I pushed some of the large pieces of chutney through my garlic press rather than chop them.

Really good. Two of these toasts plus a salad makes a meal. Easy, too.
