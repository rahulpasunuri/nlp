I made the vinaigrette and didn't even serve it. It had very little taste and the texture was very thick and clumpy. Not good.

Prepared this recipe with turkey breast tenderloins. For greens I used a variety of lettuces fresh picked from my garden. What drew my interest to this recipe initially was the dressing. Truth be told, I was disappointed. Using a more flavorful olive may make the difference. For example a salt cured, then oil packed variety such as nicoise. I did use a white balsamic vinegar because I didn't want the dressing to be too dark. All in all this dressing could elevate to 3 forks with some experimentation.

Simply spectacular and easy! I doubled the vinagrette and marinated the chicken in it as well. My guests and I loved it and it looks pretty on the plate when you drizzle the dressing over it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Vinaigrette is wonderful! Glad there were leftovers.

Absolutely yummy. This is a great salad with depth of flavor. I added chopped kalamata and avocado to the salad and, like other reviewers, used an equal mixture of romaine, baby spinach and arugula. As far as the thickness of the dressing or the amount of red peppers: that's all personal choice. I found it perfect as is. I'm going to say it again: Yummy.

Very good vinaigrette, however it is a bit thick, which I liked, but my husband would have prefered it a bit thinner. Make the dressing ahead a few hours to meld the flavors. Did not have kalmata olives on hand so used a generous teaspoon of trader joes tapenade with excellent results. For the tomatoe, used an heirloom tomatoe instead of the plum.

I doubled this recipe last night for my 2 picky teenage girls, wifey, and me. It got good reviews, particularly the grilled peppers and the dressing. The dressing is delightfully light and flavorful. I used vine-ripe tomatoes from the back yard in the dressing - that always helps. Omitted the olives and didn't notice anything missing. A terrific warm summer night salad.

I brushed the chicken with olive oil and some fresh lemon juice before grilling... it was awesome with the dressed greens! Very fresh, very light dish.

A great one-dish summer meal!

Yum. I didn't have any endive, so I added some lettuce and spinach instead. I wanted the chicken to have more flavor, so I sprinkled it with spicy salt and pepper, then pan-fried it in a bit of garlic butter. Also, I added a bit of sugar to the dressing, which made all the difference. One red pepper isn't enough, though! Two + would have been better.

I love this dish. It was initally made for me by a girlfriend. What a great meal it was. I love it so much that I grow my own Arugula in the summer time so I can make it, since in my area Arugula is considered a herb and a small amount cost a great deal

I quadrupled the recipe and made it for a shower. I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated the chicken first in a balsamic vinaigrette. I also garnished with some Kalamata olives. I served it on a large white platter, and it was spectacular looking. I was not pleased with the consistency of the dressing (too thick, and a touch bland). I think next time I will not blend the tomatoes in, but add them chopped to a thinner, more pungent vinaigrette. Served with roasted new potatoes.

Excellent. I used fresh arugula from my garden. I also slow-grilled the chicken, constantly basting it with olive oil. A great use of my grill, and a winner with my fiancee!

My husband thought it was good, but I didn't. I think the mustard I used was too spicy because the vinaigrette had quite a kick to it. Warning to breatfeeding mothers: my 10 week-old has been crying all night. I may make this again--in about a year.

Yum. I served it with baby potatoes and it was great. Maybe the chicken would be even better if it was marinated first.

I marinated the chicken breasts in a combination of equal parts olive oil and balsamic vinegar and one clove of garlic. I also doubled the dressing and used only 1/4 t of the thyme and one tomato. In addition to the arugula, I tossed a few pieces of dole classics lettuce, eliminated endive and grilled 2 red peppers 4 portabella mushrooms. This is a sure winner for entertaining.

This was very good, low in fat, and very pretty. I used lettuces from my garden (including arugula) instead of the endive. Definitely a keeper.
