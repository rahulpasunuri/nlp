This bread is amazing, easy to make, delicious, and beautiful. We skipped the apricot glaze and drizzled it with clementine juice/powdered sugar.

I liked this bread a lot; it really is like brioche. It is a little bit plain, but nice with raspberry jam and a cup of coffee. The seeds from the vanilla bean look beautiful in the dough, which really does rise to impressive heights! This bread is huge, so round up lots of hungry people to help you eat it!

This bread turned out very well even though I mixed it by hand & hand-held mixer. The lemon flavor is very subtle. I was hoping for a more lemony bread. Does anyone know if it is possible to add lemon juice? Or would the acidity have an adverse affect? But, it was still excellent.

This was wonderful!!! I have made it several times, and have given it away for gifts. Perfect for holiday, smells awesome too.

Having never made bread before, I have no comparison in terms of difficulty. I used a regular standing mixer and it was perfectly fine. To recreate the effect of a proof box I simply set my oven to 100 degrees and added some boiling water in a pan to create steam (humidity). The bread rose wonderfully and smelled great! Do not use fake vanilla and if you can get it, do the whole bean thing. I accidentally underbaked (make sure you rotate it enough) but on the whole, it tasted awesome!
