I liked this so much in the quantity for (2) that I tried making for x12 ( use a little extra broth / half & half). It is one of my favorite crowd soup recipes now. It pleases many palates and is an ideal winter chowder dinner, rounded out with bread & cookies for dessert.

Very simple and delicious. I cut back on the half and half and didn't miss it at all.

Very nice. My boyfriend and I made this together and it was quite tasty but then we added some Old Bay and some sauted mushrooms and it was out of this world.

Very nice flavor, but a little thin. Next time I'd follow the advice of the cook who added cornstarch. A generous pinch of salt does wonders.

Quick and easy. I doubled the recipe, added a cup of frozen corn (would be good with even more), and at the end 2 tablespoons of corn starch mixed with cold water to thicken.

I thought it was a good basic receipe, seems it would be easy to experiment with. Next time I think I will add mushrooms and maybe some rice.

This is a very simple yet tasty soup. I streched it out with some more stock and milk. I also added some turnips that I had. Served it with some homemade biscuts. Got great reviews from my husband!

I used green onions (I had some I needed to use up) and half evaporated milk half skim milk for a double recipe, and 2 extra bacon slices. It was really good and really quick. My husband had seconds and my five year old drank his bowl clean. My 4 yr old is another story, but who asked her? I love it!

Excellent! This chowder was such a surprise hit. My fiance, who normally complains when I make a soup for dinner, raved about this chowder. I added extra potato. MMM Good.

This soup is quite delicious and easy to make. I doubled the recipe using only six thighs and found there was plenty of chicken. I also added a little more potato. Very yummy!!

Great fresh tasting dish for those nights you really don't feel like cooking. My husband is not crazy about "soups" but he loved this one. I paired it with homemade bread and a fresh salad. A definite keeper.

We liked this recipe but thought it was a bit bland. Next time I will add a little more onion and little ham to either go with the bacon or instead of the bacon.

The only comment I have on this very good meal disguised as a soup, is that when doubling you can get away with using a package of chicken thighs containing 6 vs. 8. If you prefer white meat, I'm sure it would be just as tasty with chopped boneless chicken breasts in the usual quantity per small package. Be sure to skim any fat off the surface prior to serving. I was surprised that I needed to use as much pepper and salt as I did, for 'to taste'.

Great quick dinner for two. Nothing I would change. It's a keeper.

This chowder was really good. It was nice and smoky from the bacon, which also gave it a good crunch. A definite keeper.
