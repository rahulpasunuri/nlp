I made my mom's pie crust (as always) but otherwise followed the recipe. The streusel topping is delicious but an added bonus is how beautiful it looks without even trying. Loved the filling.

Outstanding pie! I think this might be the best pie I have ever made. I cheated just a little and used Pillsbury pie crust, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The streusel was amazing! The pie did take about 10 minutes longer to get to that thick bubbly stage. Am I ever glad I have lots of blueberries, raspberries and blackberries in the freezer!

This was fantastic. I made it all with wild blackberries ("dewberries"), as I several gallon bags full. The filling was almost too much for my smallish pie plate, so you might want to reduce the total berries to 5 cups if you're using a smaller dish. I also added about 1/2 c of oats to the topping, and used whole wheat flour (it was all I had). The hint of ginger and orange along with the extra crunch really made the pie something special. I'll definitely be coming back to this recipe any time I have a lot of berries laying around.

Perfect summer pie. I added extra (about 2 tablespoons) corn starch and the middle was perfectly firm and delicious. No runny messes here! Served warm with vanilla ice cream- YUM!

absolutely outstanding. Wouldn't change a thing.

I think there is something wrong with the cooking times here or something. The crust was incredibly undercooked and the berries were a soupy mess. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this was a big disappointment.

Delicious - even with the substitutions I had to make. I used store bought pie crust since I've never worked with dough and didn't have time to learn. I used frozen fruit, about equal servings of all three. Since I forgot to buy corn starch I substituted quick cooking tapioca (4tsp per 1 tbl of corn starch). Plus I had no idea what crystallized ginger was and couldn't find it at the store, so I used ground ginger instead. The pie came out great and everyone loved it! The ground ginger gave it a 'kick', if I had to make it that way again I think I'd use only 1 tbs of it. I now know what crystallized ginger is and will use that instead next time I make it.

The streusel topping was amazing. However, the berries came out undercooked and tart, and the pie was way too watery. I was disappointed. I followed the recipe to the letter, and I don't know if it was the fruit or something that wasn't quite ripe/good. It is the height of summer in the south, though, so I should think the berries were ripe.... Any suggestions? I've made lots of pies before, and this is the first one where the epicurious rating and reviews did not hold true.

This was mostly delicious as the recipe was written. However, the seeds in the blackberries and raspberries really got in the way. Next time I'll just use blueberries. Also, the topping was a little too moist, so it was hard to crumble on top of the pie and was very firm when cooked. I'd suggest 1/2 or less of the milk so that it becomes more of a crumble topping. The ginger was delicious. Serve hot with vanilla bean ice cream. Note: both the dough and the topping can easily be made in a food processor at a great savings of time.

Best pie I have ever made! Served it at a dinner party last weekend and someone said "Marie Callendar can throw in the towel!" Great recipe for those looking for no-fail high altitude (I am at 8300 ft) desserts. I am making it again tonight! Definitely my summer go-to pie, as well.

Make this pie! This is so excellent - I'll be dreaming about this pie! I used equal parts of the 3 berries. I make an apple crumb pie often, and the streusel for that is 1/2 c. flour, 1/2 c. sugar, and only 3 T. butter - since I knew that was a good streusel, that's what I used, and added the zest, milk, almonds and ginger that this recipe calls for. So if you wanted to, you could cut the butter in half without any detriment at all. This was a FABULOUS pie. DEFINITELY my new summer go-to pie!

This pie is excellent! I made it on Christmas and it was the perfect finish to a classic meat and potatoes meal. I agree that it is better the next day when the orange and ginger really come through.

One of the best berry pies I've ever made. I use equal parts of the berries. The ginger & orange really enhance the flavors of this pie. For those of you who don't make pies often, my advice is, make it the day before you plan to eat it, the flavor and texture of any pie is so much better after it's had time to rest.

From a pie connoisseur family, this is the best darn pie ever! Having sampled recipes from all the best cookbooks, this is a must make for pie lovers! Enjoy.

This is for sure the best pie I've ever made, and I've made many. I actually made it to give away, but after smelling it for so long I decided I just needed a little taste...and then I ended up eating half of it before I gave it to a friend to get it out of the house. The friend also said it was the best pie he'd had, and has since asked me to make it again several times. Absolutely delicious!!!

I have made this twice, first time I didn't have crystallized ginger - what a BIG difference (the flavor was so much STRONGER/INTENSE w/ the ginger). I actually preferred it better the next day when the flavors mellowed (tart berries, zingy ginger, citris-y orange) it is my new fav dessert!

This was a big hit at a party last night. Used a pre- made crust and added 1/2 c of oats and 1/4 c of brown sugar. The ginger & orange come through loud & clear-may decrease the amount next time.

Used lemon instead of orange, so maybe I can't compare, but I didn't love it. The berries were great, but the strudel complicated things. Maybe I'll give it another try, but maybe not.

This could be the best berry pie in the world. I'm happy to keep testing others, but it's hard to believe any recipe could beat this one. Serve this pie and your guests will fall at your feet. It is that good.

I made two pies for a neighborhood progressive dinner and it was remarkable! Everyone raved about how delicious it was and particularly asked about the streusel. I will certainly make this again. Splenda worked just as well as sugar too.

I had this pie at a big BBQ. It was so good, I assumed that the host (a chef) had made it. I asked around, but no one knew who had made it. Everyone -- including the host -- wanted the recipe. Someone actually proposed getting on a chair and shouting "thank you!" at the whole party at once, just to make sure we thanked the cook. It was that amazing. I just finished making it myself, using cherries and apricots instead of berries. I screwed up the streusel -- forgot to add the almonds and dumped them on top when I put the pie in. Still tastes fantastic. There's just no way to wreck that wonderful mix of orange, ginger, and almonds.

I was out of almonds and substituted pecans instead, just as yummy! This will become one of my "go- to" summer desserts.

Sorry - re: the last review, make that more raspberries and BLUEberries in place of the blackberries!!

Rating: 4
This pie was out of this world! The crust is an outstanding go-to recipe. The streusel was perfect for this flavor combination. The filling was delicious and stayed together so that the slices came out cleanly. I only had slivered almonds on hand, so I used them, and it turned out well. I also added more raspberries and blackberries in place of the blackberries because one of our guests does not prefer them. This was a slam dunk. I will be making this again and again!!

This was fan-flippin'-tastic! I got rave reviews for this one. And I may have found a new pie crust recipe! Ever since Crisco changed its formula, my tried and true, handed-down-for- generations pie crust recipe has not been the same. This was delish!

This may be the best pie ever. I didn't worry about the precise mix of berries, and the milk wasn't whole, but other than than I followed the recipe exactly. The streusel topping is truly exceptional.

The best pie I have ever made! Put a couple oz. more of blackberries, and a couple oz. less of blueberries. Used less sugar and chopped some almonds as well as using sliced. It was AWESOME! My absolute most favorite pie.
