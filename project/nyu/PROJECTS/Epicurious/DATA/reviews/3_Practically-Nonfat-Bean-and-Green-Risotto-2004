Easy to make, healthy and delicious. I made this risotto yesterday and basically followed the recipe, except that I took the advice from Dr. Serena from California (I think) and sauteed the onions (I used a red onion), garlic and leeks in olive oil before adding. I also used red and green endives and sauteed the green endives with the leeks, onions and garlics. I added the red endive, arugula and raddichio at the end, as the recipe states. The dish was very tasty and filling and with the olive oil used to saute, still came out to 280 calories a cup. I brought it to a cooking club and it was very well received.

I doubt if this dish tastes that great when made as written, but it was excellent when made like a traditional risotto (and using arborio). I used the ingredients listed except evoo, 8 oz arborio rice, 2 1/2 c water, 1 tsp veg bouillon, salt, canellini beans, ~3 c chopped curly endive (no arugula). I made as a traditional risotto but in the pressure cooker. First saute onion, leeks and garlic in evoo then add rice and toast lightly. Add wine and wait until it is mostly absorbed by rice. Add broth then pressure cook for 7 minutes. Add beans and curly endive and some parmesan. WAIT at least 30 min to serve! (flavors were not that great right away but were exceptional after waiting a bit). Great dish with lots of room to modify based on what you have on hand.

Works with wild rice too!

Loved this recipe exactly as written. Went really well paired with Sourdough bread as someone had suggested. I'll be making this again, especially in the colder months because it's great comfort food - that's light and healthy to boot!

This is a great base recipe. It is quick and simple, yetI have broken it out for dinner parties.

I found this dish un-remarkable and mediocre. I have not had a greate deal of risotto, but I found this dish not very good. Smelled great cooking though.

We made this over the weekend and quite liked it. I found myself eating a bit of the cold leftovers the next day, and liked it then too! It made considerably more than 5 cups, though--more like 7. (Note to the cook from Somerville: where the recipe calls for white rice, they're talking about the risotto, and I used 1 1/3 cups with good results.) It's true that the raddichio is a little bitter, but we didn't find this bothersome; perhaps radicchio varies in bitterness? If I were going to serve it to company, I would use white kidney beans rather than red.

The first risotto I've ever tasted that I actually disliked.

I love radicchio, but found that the amount called for overwhelmed the risotto with too much bitterness -- which the added parmesan cut somewhat. Next time I will use kale. This recipe also gives me great ideas to modify with other ingredients for other low-fat, tasty and low-maintenance risottos.

What's up with the risotto? The recipe doesn't say how much rice I should put in. I'm guessing 2 cups?

Very easy and very delicious! I also used chicken stock, and white beans instead of red.

Delicious, healthy, and easy to prepare - what could be better? I also used chicken stock, and I think I ended up with kale rather than endive, but it was still great. Better than any restaurant risotto I've had. Can't wait to have the leftovers tonight.

I also made this with chicken stock, and used all curly endive (since I had too much on hand). It was a definite hit with everyone, and the leftovers were just as good the next day. I could hardly believe that it's actually good for you.

I'm not a vegetarian, but this recipe is delicious. I have made it many times.

This was a delicious main course with sourdough bread. I used chicken stalk (since I'm not a veggetatian) and flat leaf endive which was fine. I think it was actually more like 3 and a half forks!!
