I mixed all filling ingredients together then put the cherries mixture in the food processor and pulsed in two batches to break them up some. A few were still whole but it gave a better mouth feel and better to serve.

So yummy! My son and I made this with our Montmorency cherries this year. We did 1.5 of the topping as someone else suggested. The cherry filling was still very tart and was perfect with vanilla ice cream.

the recipe was a cinch, and the cobbler came out beautifully. i subbed 1 tablespoon OJ and 1 lime juice for lemon and it didn't make one bit of difference. i didn't make the ice cream recipe and just used a scoop of melty vanilla. summer perfection!

I made this recipe with fresh sour cherries from the farmer's market. It was the first cobbler that I have attempted, and it turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly except that I baked it in an 8-inch square pyrex dish, which could not be used over an open flame. So I brought the cherries to a boil in a pot, poured the mixture into the baking dish; then added the biscuit batter. I checked it five minutes before the recommended baking time, and it was done. Delish with Haagen-Dazs 5-ingredient vanilla ice ream.

LOVED this! Followed directions exactly except used 1/3 cup white and 1/3 cup brown sugar. Made with frozen sour cherries from the farmer's market, will definitely stock up on those again this year. The topping was just delicious.

This was excellent. I used four cans of sour cherries (drained two)and in lieu of cornstarch, added about 2 big tablespoons of tapioca. I added some Amaretto to the chrries. I made a double batch of topping and added some brown sugar and cinnamon to the topping. If I made it again I would not drain any of the cherries because the biscuity-y topping absorbs a lot of juice. And I think some grated orange zest would be good in this. But my dinner guests loved it and my husband raved about it as it was.

Fresh sour cherries are available at farmers markets for about two weeks starting around the end of June and this is my go to recipe for cherry cobbler. I have been making this recipe for 5 years now. I bake the cobbler in an 8"x8" baking dish. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/07/07/sour-cherry-cobbler/

Deliscious recipe. I had about 4C. Bing cherries leftover and was looking for a recipe where I could use them. This fit the bill! I used a mixture of brown sugar, flour and butter for a topping and added in some cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust. This makes for a perfect summer treat!

The entire pan was empty in less than 20 minutes! I used 2 cups jarred pitted sour cherries with most of the juice, a small bag of frozen black cherries and about 1/2 cup dried cranberries, doubled the lemon juice, vanilla and corn starch, and added cinnammon to taste. The topping, I made 1 1/2 times the amount, added about 1/4 c packed brown sugar and sprinkled the top with vanilla sugar prior to baking. The key is tasting the filling and the topping before baking, and mke sure you have enough sweetness in the batter and combination of sweet and tartness in the filling. It was fantastic served with (and even without) vanilla bean ice cream. Yum!

We have a Montmorency cherry tree that is having a banner year. Checking for a recipe to use some that I haven't frozen, this sounded like the one to try. After reading the reviews, I also did 1-1/2 times the topping, used brown sugar instead of regular sugar, and sprinkled demerera sugar over it before baking. I baked it in a large glass casserole dish that is deeper than a skillet so it would not bubble over. And I added about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the cherry mixture. It took 35 minutes in a convection oven. My husband has told me several times that I can make this every night if I want to and has even offered to go back out to the tree and pick more cherries for the freezer! It is a really terrific cherry dessert.

Tasty! I used fresh sour cherries (pitted 380 of them, one at a time with a little Kernex cherry pitter). I saved the juice in the bottom of the bowl with the cherry pits and added it to the cherries. On the advice of another reviewer, I added a little brown sugar (1 tablespoon) to the topping. Baked the dessert in an 8 inch square Corning Ware pan.

I added Cointreau, cinnamon and natural vanilla (instead of almond extract) to the cherries (delicious on their own), and sprinkled natural sugar on the top of the crust before baking. The crust was a bit boring but the cherries conconction really livened it all up!

Really good recipe and I would make it again - with one change. I made it in my cast iron pan and the acidity in the cherries and the lemon juice stripped all of the seasoning out of the pan and the finished product had a bit of a metallic taste to it. Next time I'll cook the filling in a saucepan and bake it in a casserole dish or use a different pan.

I made this twice, the first time it was good then I decided that it needed a little help somewhere. The second time I added a little cinnamon and a little dry sherry to the cherries before cooking and also added brown sugar to the dough I was very pleased with the results. The cinnamon added some mystery and the sherry a bit of undertone to the cherries. The brown sugar made the crust irresistable.

This recipe is simple, easy and delicious. We've made it twice - the first time I found that there wasn't enough batter. The next time we doubled it and it ended up soaking up all the sour cherry sauce! I think I will leave it just as it is. Lovely.

I recommend this very easy and yummy recipe, but would make a few changes next time I make this. I used a Le Creuset 9 inch skillet and I felt it was too small. The cobbler overflowed in the oven; at the least, I recommend placing foil under pan before baking. Next time I make this, I will: reduce the sugar slightly if using fresh sour cherries, use a bigger skillet, increase the batter proportions by 50%, and add a small amount of freshly ground nutmeg to the batter.

This is a standout recipe: simple, quick to make and delicious. I have made this cobbler a number of times and each time it has turned out well and received rave reviews. I use frozen cherries due to their continual availability and closer proximity to fresh.

Very easy and yummy cobbler. I too cooked the cherries in a saucepan then baked in a casserole and it worked great. I would like the biscuts to be a little sweeter so next time I'd probably add some more sugar, maybe vanilla sugar and sprinkle with turbinado before baking.

There weren't fresh cherries available, so I used some jared pitted sour cherries I found at the market. They worked fine and saved a lot of time. Delicious recipe.

This is my favorite cherry cobbler recipe, bar none. Not too sweet. I usually cut the sugar some, as well.

I doubled the recipe using frozen tart cherries, and instead of using a cast iron skillet to simmer the fruit mixture, I did that separately in a saucepan, then dumped it into a large baking dish. I'd never used this technique for biscuit dough but it really worked well--it was tender, fluffy and buttery tasting. I did have to adjust the baking time to 1 hour, however, to get a golden color. The almond extract and lemon juice really enhanced the distinct flavor of tart cherries. Wonderful. Can't wait to try it with homegrown cherries soon.
