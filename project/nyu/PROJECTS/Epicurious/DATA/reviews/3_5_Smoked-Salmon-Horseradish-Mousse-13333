I've made this several times and think it's great. To make it a little less caloric, I use 1/2 c plain Greek yogurt and 1/4 c low fat sour cream. The sour cream is rich enough that you don't even notice the substitution. I also use jarred horseradish so I don't have to worry about having fresh available.

Love it! Never a bite left! I've used good refrigerated horseradish in a jar and it's just fine... also, a little grated fresh lemon zest added makes this even more perfect!

This gets 4 stars because it's so easy, quick and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly in terms of making the mousse (I only had 2 oz. of salmon, so I skipped the sliced salmon part.) Taking a cue from the other reviewers, I served it on a salad of baby spinach and red onions, with a lemony French vinaigrette. On a whim, I tossed in some dried cranberries.... it was AWESOME. We couldn't believe the cranberries worked so well, but they rounded the flavors out beautifully.

What a lovely, light meal! I served mounds of it on mesclun greens with thinly sliced bosc pears, and capers and dill mustard to dip the extra salmn in. Beautiful. I didnt use bread but rather spread the mousse on slices of cucumber. Yum.

I made this last Christmas for a family gathering and just came back to find the recipe again for this year. It was a hit with fish lovers and non fish lovers alike, very simple to prepare, elegant presentation and perfect to make ahead and take along.

Our friends flipped over this one. I had a lot of salmon left over from Thanksgiving, so used extra in the mousse and served it with additional slices, plus a garnish of dill sprigs and lemon slices - and Carr's cracked pepper table wafers. Everyone agreed that it was perfect as such, and I'll do it again for Christmas dinner.

We served this as an appetizer for a special dinner prepared for our Inn guests. Three small scoops atop a bed of fresh spinach leaves, served with garlic olive oil toasted crostini lightly sprinkled with fresh ground black pepper. Plate garnished with blossomed capers. Beautiful & great tasting.

Made this recipe with the side of salmon I just smoked - too too good! To be served with ROASTED BEET SALAD WITH BEET GREENS AND FETA (this site) for dinner tonight. YUM!

Easy, elegant, and delicious! Served with lightly toasted cocktail pumperknickel bread. I actually made this in a mold, and garnished with sprigs of fresh chives, and a rose tomato. Have received numerous request for recipe.

Excellent and easy to make. Do make sure it's for 6 people though. I served it to 4 and it was almost too much for the Ladies. But they ate it all anyway. What does that tell you!

I doubled the salmon, tripled the horseradish, and left out the dill (cause I don't like it). I served it with some shredded horseradish on top. This was extremely easy, do ahead, elegant and very well received.

When I made this I doubled the salmon. I have also made it with smoked Arctic Char. I serve it on endive leaves for a wonderful presentation.

This was delicious but it needed alterations. I also doubled the amount of salmon and used about 4 tablespoons of horseradish. After first making it as written, I tasted it and found it tasted much more like sour cream than smoked salmon. So I added the extra salmon and horseradish and it was wonderful. I shaped the mousse like gefilte fish ovals and served it as a different sort of fish course at Hanukkah dinner. It was very well received.

Personally I LOVE this appetizer. I served it at Christmas dinner and it was an elegant and excellent hit. Personally I found the horseradish just a little too much, so I'll add a little less next time.

I made this and found it delicious. I doubled the salmon quantity and added more horseradish. Delicious! I piped it onto toasted rounds as an Hors D'oeuvre

This recipe is delicious. I make it every year for my Christmas Open House and it is always a hit. The recipe is even better with more horseradish added.
