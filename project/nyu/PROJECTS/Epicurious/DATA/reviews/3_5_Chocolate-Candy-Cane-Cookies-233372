After reading the reviews, pulling the cookies out of the oven in time seemed to be the biggest trick. Unfortunately even with that in mind, they still came out tasting like dog biscuits as previously mentioned. There is not enough chocolate flavor coming through which puts them in the bland, middle-of-the-road category.

We've made these cookies several years in a row. First of all, don't overcook them! These lose all appeal when not soft. Second, try using a quarter cream cheese instead of butter. It adds to the flavor and texture of the filling. Third, up the peppermint extract to taste. We like it pretty strong! And last, try my tip for filling them: Put a large dollop of frosting on the bottom of a cookie, press the second cookie on top until the icing just begins to ooze out from the sides, and roll it in crushed peppermints. Oh, these cookies are also great refrigerated. The cold chocolate-mint combination is so good!

don't mind the haters - these are actually pretty good cookies. if you watch the timer with diligence, the chocolate wafers turn out really well. the butter cream recipe does need some help. waaaaay to buttery to begin with, but some almond milk and a pinch of extra sugar saves the day. also - if you are a reasonable person (and not a total frosting fiend), you can almost certainly just make 1/2 the filling as this jawn calls for. otherwise, mint and chocolate are the best combo, and this is a worthy cause.

A very pretty cookie with a lovely texture to bite into, but the taste is rather unappealing. Imagine biting into two dog biscuits with toothpaste in the middle.

Two things: The cookies itself were hard almost as hard as a rock but still soft enough to break them in half. If you were to eat the cookies plain - there would be NO taste! The recipe asks for a lot of crushed candy canes - I seriously didn't use even half of the candy canes needed for the recipe. Overall, the buttercream did help the cookies taste good but if the cookies were a lot softer it would be more enjoyable to eat.

By far the best Christmas Cookie I have ever made. A MUST MAKE cookie for the holidays. Chocolate, peppermint creme rolled in candy cane. Not much more explanation needed. Key to success: do not overcook cookies. That and add just a wee bit more powdered sugar than you think you should.

Of all the cookies I made these were the ones always left on the plate. The dough for this is pretty hard, perhaps I overdid them, but I'd say they weren't worth the trouble.

I thought these cookies sounded fabulous for christmas time...but I was sadly disappointed. The buttercream is FAR too buttery. I ended up adding milk, and quite a bit of extra powdered sugar, which just made it too sweet. The cookies turned out too dry...soft, but dry, and fairly bland. After eating one cookie, I felt like I had consumed about a full stick of butter, and ended up giving the rest away (and I was almost ashamed to give these terrible cookies away). In my opinion, people who are giving these cookies a good review are too easy to please.

YUM!!! I just made these cookies to package up in my annual Christmas cookie boxes. They look fantastic and people were super impressed. First of all, I made a double batch and reduced the sugar by about 25%. I rolled the dough into 2 log shaped rolls using parchment paper, and put into fridge. When time to bake, I sliced the cookies into about 1/4" -1/2" slices and baked on parchment paper. I thought the icing was just perfect as is.

Rating: 4
Easy and fun to make, and so pretty! We ground up candy canes in a food processor and used the resulting "peppermint dust" to give the filling a bit more flavor and a wee bit of texture. And, after making and sampling a sandwich of cookies and buttercream, we decided to simply ice the tops of the cookies and press them into the crushed candy. The sandwiches were too much, but the iced cookies were just right.

Rating: 2
These cookies were great, but the only complaint I had was the icing! Waaayy too much butter so they tasted overindulgent and fatty. Next time I'm going to take other cooks' advice and make them smaller, as well as add much more icing sugar to the buttercream. Otherwise they were a hit! Turned out just like the picture and they were gone in 24 hours!

OH MY!! These were my christmas present to my family and they loved them! I did make a few slight changes. 1st, I used someone's suggestion and I added in about 1 tbsp of finely ground espresso into the dough and also roughly chopped about 1/3c. 70percent cacao dark chocolate bar and put that in the chocolate cookie part. The thing that was so nice about the recipe is that the cookies are nice and flexible. Your teeth sink in without upsetting the peppermint buttercream which paired so well with a very rich dark chocolate espresso cookie! We were all so pleased by these delicious cookies. Also, I made the cookies very small. If you make them too big, it's too much of a good thing. The cookies end up to be the exact same size after baking, so it's good to be aware of this so your size can be as you like it.

Rating: 0
I was hoping so much that other reviewers were wrong, but unfortunately, i too threw these cookies out. For one, they were too sweet even with downsizing. Secondly, the butter cream frosting felt like shortening. If i ever make this again, I would probably use my famiy's butter cream frosting recipe and a different cookie altogether. Sorry folks, I really wanted this to be a winner.

Rating: 3
I didn't read the other reviews before I made these otherwise I would have made some changes. First, make these cookies SMALL as they become a "meal" as my husband said after he ate one. Also, add twice the amount of powdered sugar to the filling or it is too soft and buttery. Overall, it's a delicious and visually beautiful cookie.

Rating: 4
These are truly amazing, simple cookies! They are my signature cookie this year, 2009. I bake for exactly 10 minutes, cool for 5. They remain soft enough that when you bite down on the perfect buttercream filling they do not ooze. If left in for 2-3 more minutes they are too hard and yes, will make a mess. They are truly a hit everywhere I take them!

Rating: 3
This recipe is great, made them for my sister who loves candy-canes! I added 2 cups of icing sugar (instead of 1) to the buttercream icing, and halved the sugar in the cookies (to avoid some reviews that the icing was to buttery), I then thinned the icing with a touch of milk. The cookies right now are in the fridge, and we've discovered their tastier eaten from the fridge b/c the icing stays solid and does not create such a mess (they kind of taste like ice cream sandwiches!).

Rating: 4
Yummy and elegant cookies. As other folks have done, I've made mine smaller, about a 1 t. of dough. Adjusted baking to 7-8 minutes. Additionally, I found that I needed to add more powdered sugar to filling... it seemed like it was too soft. Also, once finished with the assembly process, I've refrigerated the cookies. In prior years, the soft filling tended to squeeze out and this firmed up the filling a bit.

One of my favorite desserts is brownies with mint frosting, and this recipe is a delicious cookie version of the same when baked open- faced instead of as a sandwich. I rolled mine out and baked them for 7 minutes and they came out wonderfully textured-- somewhere between a soft shortbread and brownie. The pink frosting against the dark cookie is chic (which I've never called a cookie before!), and the candy canes on top festive. My son had a field day crushing them inside a ziplock bag with a rubber mallet. Definitely adding my modified version to the Christmas cookie round-up.

These cookies are the GREATEST for the holidays! They are so cute and festive looking...we gave them away as a part of a Christmas treat package and everybody absolutely loved them. Several people requsting the recipe and stating they were the best cookies they had ever tasted! Some minor suggestions (as already made). Roll into fairly small balls. The recipe will go a lot further and the look is that much more cute. We baked for only 7mins, so the texture was nice and soft.

Precious to look at, but less than average cookie. I threw them away.

Superb! Just use the filling as a frosting (do not sandwich) and then press the tops of each individual cookie into a bowl of crushed candy canes to garnish with holiday flair! To achieve a more striking appearance, swap out a tablespoon of the regular cocoa with black cocoa. A teaspoon of espresso powder can also be sifted in with the dry ingredients to enhance their flavor. If they are too minty for your tastes, leave out the peppermint extract in the filling and use vanilla instead! Make them very small (adjust your baking time) and they'll be elegant, cute as buttons! Sincerely, Dorina

These cookies were so delicious! I used a 1 tsp. scoop to make the cookies. I ended up with 36 cookies in total. It worked out perfect. The cookies were nice and soft and the butter cream icing was perfect. I just added a couple of drops of peppermint extract (to taste) and it was delicious. Definitely will make these again.

Rating: 4
They came out soft and chewy when I baked them for 8 or 9 minutes. And they were delicious. The recipe made 1 1/4 dozen completed sandwiches, so not a lot, but they were worth it, anyway. The butter icing was very creamy, though the peppermint was a little too strong. It was kind of hard to get the candy to stick, at least the bigger pieces. However, they were so easy that they will definately be added to my Christmas cookie repertiore.

These were delicous! It was the first time I had made icing from scratch (as opposed to adding to a tub of Betty Crocker) and it was so easy and delicious I don't think I'll ever go back. Easy to do, delicous and gourmet looking, what more could I ask? Next time I may use a little less peppermint though as the taste was mildly remenisent of toothpaste. Not enough to keep me (or everyone else, I only got 1!) from eating them, but enough that I could recognize it. Still 4 forks though for being easy, yummy and aesthetically pleasing.

Rating: 3
These cookies were absolutely delicious, but they were so heavy that I felt like I was eating a stick of butter. I think that both the cookies and the buttercream could do with about 1/3 less butter. I ended up thinning the buttercream with 2% milk and lots more confectioner's sugar, and using crushed candy canes in lieu of peppermint extract simply because I didn't have any on hand. The cookies tasted absolutely wonderful - the chocolate component of the recipe is absolutely perfect, but if you prefer something lighter, steer clear or augment the recipe.

I also only baked the cookies for about 9 minutes- they were perfect this way.

I used small little once inch cutter (actually the top to a spice bottle) and made about 50+ mini ones. Very cute and delicious.

Holy smokes! These are the real deal, a delicious delight for the taste buds. The cookies need to be wet in the middle and done on the edges when taken out. The frosting needs to be slightly stiff and a good amount should be put in between the cooled cookies. We used crushed peppermints rather than candy canes because that's what we had on hand. They are delicious. I only wish that the recipe made more. These are fabulous cookies. Simply devine.

Rating: 4
This cookie is excellent! It is a perfect holiday cookie. I made a few adjustments to make it even more delicious. I baked the cookie for 7 minutes which gives it a chewy texture. The frosting needs almost double the confectioner's sugar and more peppermint extract to make the flavor more intense and bring out the chocolate. Also, I finely chopped the candy canes so nobody would break a tooth! Enjoy- this is wonderful!

Oh my stars, these are delicious. Husband declared them best cookies I've ever made. They came out perfect for me, just like the photo - I followed the recipe exactly.

If people are sampling from a cookie tray, a smaller size might be more appropriate. Overall, though - absolutely delicious!

I made these this December for a cookie exchange and they were a huge hit! My hubby and I liked them so much that I made more for the Christmas holiday. I tripled the recipe to make a lot and they came out perfect. Some people on here complained they are too rich, however I disagree. I think they are perfect as sandwiches and the combination of peppermint and chocolate makes the perfect holiday treat! The crushed candy canes on the sides make them so pretty too. One tip I would say is to definitely make extra frosting. I found that I ran short when assembling. I used a good heaping tablespoon in each sandwich. Also, I listened to the advice of others and baked them for less time...9 minutes. That was perfect. They came out fully baked, but stayed soft. I will definitely be making these again.

Rating: 3
These cookies are fantastic! The recipe was easy to follow and execute. My only suggested adjustment is the amount of butter used for the icing. You could get away with only one stick, or adding a little extra sugar, (about 1/4 cup more.) If you find the icing is too thick, add a 1/2 tsp of water at a time and remix until you get the consistency you like. It should be on the thicker side, so that it grabs the crushed candy canes well. Have fun!

I loved these, but you do have to love chocolate and mint. I followed others advice and made them smaller; with a 1.5 teaspoon scoop they were still a little big. I thought there were better with slightly less frosting than the picture shows, so the peppermint needed to be in really small pieces to adhere well.

Intense chocolate flavor. Peppermint buttercream is out of this world. Gorgeous presentation - esp. as I used crushed organic candy canes from Whole Foods that were more on the pink side than red. I didn't measur the cookies, but next time will make them thinner as the chocolate flavor was so intense and the cookie was quite generously sized.

These are cute, little, delicious gems. Thanks to other reviewers, I made these much smaller (ended up with about 45). I rolled the dough into 4 logs about 1" in diameter, refrigerated over night and then sliced and baked. I put the frosting in a small plastic bag and refrigerated it for about 15 minutes. Then snipped the corner of the bag and piped the frosting onto the cookies.

Easy enough to make, but time consuming. Need to state the obvious here: you have to love chocolate and you have to love mint (specifically candy canes) in order to love these cookies. They do have quite the visual impact, but I'm just not a fan.

I made these cookies gluten free by using Pamela's GF Baking & Pankcake mix in equal parts to flour measurement and reducing the butter to 1/2 cup. I rolled 1/2 tablespoon size cookies and baked for about 15 mintues, they turned out perfect. The frosting is a bit sweet for my taste, but was overall pleased with the outcome and presentation.

I've made these cookies for a few years and I find they are consistent. The dough is easy to prepare - I'm not a very good baker and it has come out correct every time. I frost a single cookie and dip the frosting into the crushed candy canes as other reviewers. A good recommendation is to thoroughly crush the candy canes finely, as big chunks get stuck in your teeth! Two of my kids don't care for them at all - they think they are too bitter. They do look pretty though.

This is the best Xmas cookie I could imagine. Made it for a Xmas party and the adults loved it and so did the kids. Thanks to a reviewer who said she used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa which made the flavor really rich with chocolate. Used about 1/2 teaspoon or less peppermint extract, didn't use all of the butter cream for filling the cookie and made the cookies smaller. The cookies were so cool looking and thanks to the other reviewers suggestions mine turned out wonderful. sometimes I am disappointed when recipes get rave reviews and then don't turn out great for me, but this one did not let me down.

I was most looking forward to this cookie and read most reviews and tried to follow the advice of others -- the cookie itself lacked something (i was slightly short on cocoa powder though) then when i made the buttercream all i tasted was butter and i used more peppermint than it called for! once i readjusted that and decided to put the crushed candy cane pieces INSIDE of the cookie they tasted better. Food network had a peppermint sandwich cookie out this year too. Personally i would try that over this one although after a few days it didn;t taste as bad but i was not impressed as i was by the picture

I didn't rate this recipe because I didn't follow it at all but I did make the dough the same then made small balls and rolled them into finely crushed candy canes. I placed them on the baking sheet and flattened them out with the bottom of a cup and baked them the same as this recipe. This way I omitted the filling, made much more, saved time, and still got the peppermint flavor. The only key to doing it this way is finely crushing the candy cane.

This went over really well -- one person exclaimed that this was Christmas all wrapped up in a cookie. I took the advice of others and just used one cookie, spread the filling on top and dipped the surface in candy cane pieces. It looks great! But the filling is sweet -- I used about 2/3 of the peppermint extract called for and should have used the whole amount to cut the sweetness.

These cookies look so cute and they taste exceptionally good. I'm so pleased with how they turned out - my only regret is that I would have made more. I did use a melon baller, leveled off the dough and only baked them for 5-6 minutes. Also, only used a 1/2 tsp. of peppermint for the frosting. Since I made smaller cookies, I ended up running out of frosting and had to make more frosting.

Rating: 3
I had a hard time with the dough - the cookies didn't flatten out like they needed to in order to be thin or wide enough to make sandwiches. SO instead I made open faced like other reviewers which looked nice, but may have added to my next point. I would definitely say these had WAY TOO MUCH PEPPERMINT. I would not add the peppermint extract to the frosting and just do the candy canes. or perhaps add more chocolate to the cookies. anything to make the peppermint less strong. they were beautiful though, and my roommate loved them just the way they were.

I already got requests for them.

These are yummy and fairly easy to make. I doubled the recipe for the cookies and did 1 1/2 times the recipe for the filling, which seemed to be about right. Next time, I would refridgerate the filling for a little bit before assembling the cookies. It got a bit soft and squeezed out the side of the cookies when I rolled them in the mints. I also doubled the mint extract.

I used special dark cocoa powder in the cookies, and they turned out delicious! I rolled out the dough and used a cookie cutter to make even, small circles that lined up evenly. The cookie part was amazing! Next time I make these cookies, I will use a different frosting, though, as the buttercream was too rich for my (and my family's) taste.

I made these last night to go along with a coffee oatmeal imperial stout I was bringing to a party. Everyone loved them and they were fairly easy to make.

Not the greatest recipe just okay. I found the buttercream too minty and I did like another reviewer and did not make the sandwiches just put the buttercream and candy canes on top.

You really do need to use Dutch Processed Cocoa as it makes the choc. cookie really rich and brings out the choc. flavor.

Just made these cookies for Christmas dessert. They are pretty easy to make. 11 minutes is way too long to bake them. 8-9 minutes is perfect. They are very sweet. If I do them again, I'd make the cookies a little smaller than 2" when baked. I'd also cut back on the frosting as others did.

These cookies are really very, very easy. When done they are not only attractive, but they taste heavenly. They are extremely rich so I only used a teaspoon of dough for each cookie. In the end I got lazy and just frosted a couple cookies and put the crushed mints on top. They were just as good that way (if not better as they are smaller this way and not quite as rich). The only change that I would make is too add a LOT more peppermint extract. As it is I doubled it, but still thought the mint flavor was much too delicate for my taste (but then I really love the taste of peppermint). I also took these out of the oven at 9 minutes and found them to be perfectly done. I will add this to my favorites as they are insanely simple for such an attractive delicious cookie!

The whole family enjoyed these, even my son, who is not a particular fan of peppermint. These are much easier than the roll-out candy cane cookies we used to make every year, and I may alternate from now on! (Can't drop the candy canes altogether- it's a family tradition.)

Just made these. I made them low carb, so I skipped the candy cane and almost doubled the peppermint extract. Made them with the melon baller and used the ziploc baggie to do the piping. Great advice from all! Thanks very much! Cookies came out great! Hubby very pleased. Me, I've been tasting batter and filling all afternoon so, for now, I'm sick of them. :) They do look awful pretty though and I got over 2 1/5 dozen with the melon baller.

These were outstanding, and a hit at the office. I pretty much followed the recipe, leaving out the red food colouring as I didn't have any to hand. I agree with others, the cookies are better taken out early rather than late, about 8-9 minutes. Also, as others have done, I did make the cookies a little smaller than directed, and ended up with approximately 2 dozen assembled cookies, along with 1/4 cup extra filling and crushed candy. I too ground the canes in a food processor to get the pieces fairly small. Very festive!

As a chef, these cookies are a favorite of mine. They add variety to the typical bevy of cookie recipes available during the holiday season. I have also made them with a variety of different fillings and buttercreams in between holiday seasons, the patrons that I bake for love them. These cookies are blessedly simple to make, and deliver consistant results every time. I personally am not a fan of buttercream, and found that the recipe yields an excessive amount of it. In my opinion that is the only flaw. These cookies can also be filled and stored in the freezer...which is how my sister prefers to eat them: frozen.

Delicious. I didn't have parchment paper and so just used some non-stick spray - worked fine. I used my hand to push down the dough, and that was fine as well. Everyone loved them but thought they were very rich - so do stick to the 1 tsp. size dough ball.

I made these last year, when the recipe was first published in Bon Appetit. They were a HUGE hit, so have been added to the Christmas cookie file. My 7 year old insists that I must make them every year. In addition to being yummy, they look absolutely beautiful on the table or on a gift tray of cookies. I did double the recipe, which I would recommend. I also found that mini candy canes give more uniform, small pieces with maximum white/red color effect

Beautiful and delicious! but I learned a few things the hard way because I didn't read all the way through the reviews... Make sure you have peppermint extract (NOT mint extract or peppermint flavor), use a bit of saran on the bottom of the glass to prevent it from sticking, make the cookies a little smaller, as they are rather rich, and be sure to crush the candy canes thoroughly to avoid chunks that are too big and hard on the teeth. Absolutely worth the effort!

I adore this recipe! If you follow the directions (chilling time, etc.) you end up with delectable cookies that will be the hit of any gathering. Makes wonderful gifts, too. So glad I was a subscriber when the cookie issue came out last year!!

I made this for Christmas last year, and I was not impressed. Although they look lovely, they didnt have the taste to match it. The cookies became too hard and the cream just wasnt good. FIY- don't use mint abstract instead of peppermint

This cookie sums up the magic of the holidays. Made them for a holiday party and they looked festive sitting on a simple white ceramic tiered platter. No one could resist the alluring pink buttercream, twinkling crushed candy canes, and chocolate cookies. No oreo could ever be this good. And by the way, the chocolate cookies are amazing on their own.

Delicious, they were even better than they looked! I had no problem with the sticking as I wasn't worried about exact uniform size and just used my hand to flatten them. I was wary of rolling them in crushed peppermints because I thought they would be too hard, but I'm so glad I did as it added the most marvelous crunch, not too hard on the teeth. I will be making these each year, and so easy!

I definitely liked these cookies a lot. They have a wonderful taste, and they are very pretty too!

Holy Cow!!!!!!!!!!! We had a cookie baking extravaganza and this recipe was one of the most spectacular. The kids loved smashing up the candy canes and rolling the cookie in the crumbs. The decoration of the crushed candy canes is lovely. I don't actually like chocolate, so I cannot give my OWN review of the flavor. However, the look on the faces of those who did eat them was absolute enjoyment. Their reviews were very positive and all claimed it as their favorite cookie. They said that the cookie itself was moist the minty filling was smooth/tasty and the candy canes on the outside gave them a crunchy variation. The recipe definitely needs to be at least doubled. I didn't have any problem with the sticking that others discussed. Definitely a keeper for future cookie baking.

I made these to take to our extended family's Christmas Eve dinner.I did like these cookies however my critical family had mixed reviews. I think they go over better when made a little smaller so the minty flavor and sweetness isn't too overwhelming. Also, to keep the cookie dough from sticking to the bottom of the glass, I buttered and dipped it in flour before pressing each cookie.

I used Key West's saran wrap tip and had no problem with sticking. The cookies were great even without filling, which was good because my 3 year old wanted nothing to do with the filling ("It's minty!! Yuck!!). My 7 year old enjoyed them both ways (as did my 46 year old). I didn't have peppermint extract, so I just ground some candy canes fine, and added that directly into the filling -- worked well. Gave a nice minty flavour. Like others, didn't bother with the additional candy cane coating, but might do so for a cookie exchange (though with smaller chunks). Didn't double the recipe, and now I regret it. Easy enough to make though.

I solved the glass problem by buttering the bottom of the glass and kept buttering it. I loved it and will make it for the cookie exchange next year, but this year I learned, too late, that my kids aren't really into the Chocolate/Mint combo thing. Poor, sad, wayward lambs.

These Christmas cookies were so fun to make. We took them to the neighborhood Christmas cookie exchange and they were a hit. The cookies are made mostly from butter and sugar, so it is hard to eat more than one at a time, but very tasty. Perfect for kids.

Excellent. Perfect "wow" factor for giving away to friends & family. No problems in the creation process. Fun and easy to make. We will make these again!

these are the only cookies made this year, when I usually make 200 - 300 dozen. I will make them again. As to the chocolate dough sticking to the glass, I solved it by putting a small square of saran wrap under the glass and it worked perfectly.

We absolutely loved these! The taste reminds me of Girl Scout Thin Mints, kicked up a notch. I had to refrigerate the dough for a longer time due to a busy day - had no problem with the glass sticking to the dough so maybe that helped. Rolled the dough into long ropes and piched off the dough into equal pieces before rolling into balls - created a very uniform cookie size for the sandwiches. Also, kept finished cookies in fridge to prevent the filling from getting too soft and "squishing" out. I think using a quality dutch cocoa makes a big difference since it is the central flavoring ingredient. I cut a minute or two off the baking time (but my oven is ancient and tends to incinerate things). I make A LOT of cookies every Christmas...this will be added to the permanent file. My only regret is giving almost all of them away. Next year I will be a Scrooge and keep more for myself!

These were delicious, if problematic. First of all, you will need much more than 2 teaspoons of filling to get the effect in the picture. Secondly, when you bite into them, all the filling squishes out, so they are bit tricky to eat. You will also need to keep dipping your glass in flour to prevent the problem (listed above) of the cookies sticking to the glass. They are gorgeous and festive-looking though. I might do them again.

Thought these looked beautiful on December's cover. Made the recipe as written, but I had trouble flattening the cookies as instructed - the glass kept sticking to the dough. The results looked pretty as the picture, but I wasn't keene on the taste.Perhaps my expectations were off kilter because I expected either a soft chewy cookie (like a double chocolate chip cookie or brownie) or a crispy cookie like an oreo or thin mint. The result was sort of in the middle - a little soft, not chewy, not super chocolatey flavored. I will not make these again, but glad so many people enjoyed them.

Beautiful, festive and delicious to boot. The flavor is not quite good as "grasshopper squares" (Gourmet Magazine), but these are definitely keepers. Much less difficult and time consuming than I thought they would be, too.

These are a great cookie. They looked just like the picture! They tasted good too!

Pretty easy to do - I used less frosting and sprinkled some of the crushed candy canes on the frosting before putting the second cookie on top. Similar effect without the rolling. Chocolate cookies also good on their own without the frosting.

Delicious! I made the cookies smaller so they made more. They freeze great!

I made these cookies for a party and they were a big hit. I did not roll them in pepperment candies, as I thought the frosting was enough peppermint. I loved the way they looked and thought they were a perfect blend of chocolate and peppermint.I'll add this to my christmas cookie file.

I don't like chocolate, but I made these for my husband who LOVES chocolate. They were a hit. I made the dough on Sunday and refrigerated it until Wednesday night (I didn't have time to bake on Sunday). No problem making the cookies. I agree with a previous poster that parchment paper on the cookie before pressing it flat would have been helpful! The butter-cream was yummy! That I'll eat! The candy-cane crumbs were so-so. Hubby didn't like the larger chunks of candy cane on the cookie. Next time, I'll either omit them (since peppermint flavor is in the butter-cream) or use a food processor to chop them finer. Good recipe overall. Will keep for future use!

I made them small and came out with 2 1/2 doz. I actually had frosting leftover. Very pretty and delicious. A nice change from the typical brownie with mint icing that usually shows up during the holidays.

Just won best tasting cookie at a cookie exchange with this one! Judges said that the texture was great and a perfect mix of chocolate and peppermint. I melted/softened the frosting to a thick paste consistency to make it easier to spread between the two cookies. I used a melon baller as a scoop to get the petite size. When I doubled the recipe and was able to make four dozen. Enjoy!

Delicious! I would agree, it is worth it to double the recipie...I only made one batch, but doubled the icing, should have doubled everything. Freeze great!

Made these twice. First time used Toll House cocoa powder-second time a dutch processed cocoa-(Drost brand)-Much Better!! Deeper chocolate flavor. I agree-double the icing recipe, you'll need it. Second time made cookies smaller,they are pretty rich.Putting a small piece if parchment paper on the cookies before you flatten them keeps them from sticking to the glass. Yummy cookie-and they freeze well!

Possibly my new favorite! I made 2 batches of these and they were a huge hit. I used extra mint in the icing--probably double. I would not cut it back at all! I had quite a bit of icing left over and just spread with a knife. I chopped the candy canes in my food processor, for a nice powdery texture. Next time, I am going to make several batches of the cookie ahead of time and freeze until I'm ready for the frosting.

Definitely double the recipe -- it doesn't make enough cookies to keep up with demand!

Good cookies! I thought the icing was light and dreamy despite the massive amount of butter! I used a spice grinder to make a powder of the peppermints as I did not want to get big bites of hard candy with my cookie.

This was the new cookie for the year. Wonderful! Made exactly to the recipe. I used Valrhona cocoa powder. Everyone loved them. For the next batch I tried to make the cookies smaller and rolled them in sprinkles. Again, everyone loved them. Will be a permanent addition to our Christmas cookie collection. My husband and daughter loved the batch that was "too crisp" for sandwiches and popped them in their mouth and grabbed a handful for munching.

Very yummy and got rave reviews from my 6 year old. They also look very pretty. I doubled the entire recipe so that I could make 36 (18 cookies just doesn't seem worth the effort). Doubling worked out well and gave me enough for a cookie exchange.

We loved this recipe! The cookie is such a rich chocolate and it is balanced nicely by the cool peppermint icing! Definitely will make this one again. And I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing.

Agree on doubling the icing. I also "toned it down" a bit, by using 4oz cream cheese, and just one stick butter. (So, in total, 8oz CC and 2 sticks butter). Not quite so rich! Great idea on the tubing...wish I had thought of that. Very rich. And, only made about 15. So, a bit short for my cookie exchange at work ;)

A very pretty and delicious dessert for the holidays. I cheated and used Archway Dutch Cocoa cookies and they worked out fantastic (I am NOT a baker!). You could dust them with powdered sugar just prior to serving to add "snow" to the tops of them. I would decrease the amount of peppermint extract, as I used about half of the amount it called for and it was plenty minty enough. I would also double the amount of frosting, as you may need more to extend to the edges of the cookies to allow for coating the edges in the crushed candy canes. I also used a ziploc bag with the end snipped off to pipe on the frosting on each cookie (made life a lot easier). Happy Holidays!!
