French Toast has to be the perfect brunch recipe, especially when you add vanilla and serve with a mimosa! Here's my favorite orange French toast recipe.

I can't believe I actually just made bread (challah with raisins and hazelnuts added, not braided) specifically to make French toast out of, but I did. It was absolutely the right bread, though. We added a little brown sugar and some extra spice to the milk and eggs, let it sit overnight and baked it in the morning. For the thick bread slices we used there wasn't quite enough liquid, but another half recipe was a bit too much. However, it puffed up nicely, and our guest, who says he's not a big French toast fan, pronounced it "quite acceptible", which, believe me, is high praise. The orange syrup is quite similar to a Sunkist recipe I found from 1913 (my house was built in 1903, so I often look for food to match for entertaining), and it's every bit as wonderful now as it was then. Just don't put it in the refrigerator in something you can't microwave, as it sets up quite solidly. (Had to put the pitcher in a pan of hot water to get it out this morning. Putting it on hot cereal was _decadent_!)

This dish is wonderful. I made it with challah, and I think the texture of that is particularly good. I loved the orange syrup. It really did puff up beautifully!

Yummy. I didn't know exactly what to expect the first time, but basically, it tastes like french toast. I've made this several times when we've had guests for brunch and people always like it. I put out maple syrup, too, just in case someone doesn't like the orange syrup. This is incredibly convenient. So much better than standing over a frying pan while 6 people sit at the dining room table. There are other recipes on Epicurious using the overnight method that I want to try and I wonder if there's something special about the recipes that makes the method work or if any standard milk and egg french toast mixture would work. If you like the method, there's no reason not to play with the type of bread and the flavorings until you arrive at combination you like. I'd stick to thick bread though. I'd be afraid a basic slice of supermarket white bread would fall apart overnight.

I thought it was OK; our grandchildren didn't like it.
