This was delicious, though I didn't have pork hock and so used thick sliced bacon cut into small pieces. I will say, though, that it's very brothy, which is a presentation challenge - and I poured off about half of the liquid. Still, it was delicious - I had baby turnips with greens attached from the farmer's market as well - could see how larger turnips and older greens might be bitter. I served it as a first course before this site's Spicy Shrimp with Andouille Sausage on Grits - if you haven't tried that, you really ought to!

This recipe is fantastic!!! My turnips and greens came right out of my garden and were not any larger than 3". I can't help wondering if the bad reviews that are on here are from people using store bought or overly large and bitter turnips. My dish didn't even have a tiny hint of bitterness. It was just fantastic! I did take others' advice and strain and reduce the broth a little bit. Otherwise, I made everything exactly as written and it was absolutely delightful and flavorful.

This simple, homely-sounding dish is absolutely fantastic. I used wonderful (unpeeled) Haruki turnips and greens from the farmers market and a big bunch of curly kale as well, and a huge and delicious ham hock. I took the advice here to strain the veggies and reduce the broth--brilliant. The Gala apples and turnips both held their shape and the flavors blended perfectly. It was even better the next day over quinoa. This is simply one of the best everyday meals I have ever made.

Gourmet republished this recipe in their special holiday issue. Surprising, since this recipe turned out terribly bitter and watery. The ratio of ham to greens is too low, and the turnips soften much more slowly than the apples. Braising the greens causes them to leach their bitter water into the otherwise lovely ham broth. When the dish is finished, you have rapidly disintegrating apples, firm turnips, mounds of greens, all swimming in cups of bitter broth, which you will desperately fork through in search of the few dots of smokey ham.

We used kale in this dish instead of turnip greens. The combination of the stewed greens and the turnips is sublime; however, I don't think the apples really added much to this dish. We'll probably make this again, but replace the apples with extra turnips.

This was so good. I added some chopped onion and garlic. I also used smoke turkey instead of the ham hock. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this with some gorgeous turnips I found at the farmers market. I used bacon instead of the ham hock and following the other reviewers' suggestion, I strained the juice, add the butter and reduced it down to a glaze. Doused in glaze and sprinkled with crumbled bacon, this was quite a yummy dish which paired really well with a juicy pot roast.

Yak! There is nothing good about this recipe. I followed it exactly except for the vinegar. I didn't have cider vinegar so used rice vinegar instead. But it can't be the reason. The ham was undercooked and tough even after one hour of cooking. It was way too watery. The flavors just didn't come together. I usually had good luck with the recipes on this website but not this one.

this is a very good recipe--and as others have mentioned, perfect for the fall csa bounty. I've made it with bacon and without any meat. Still very good. I love the apples and turnips together.

We husband and I were really wowed by the depth of flavor from such a simple recipe. We used both turnip and beet greens, since that's what we had from our CSA. We replaced the ham hock with 4 oz. of smoked tofu, since we're vegetarians. And it was absolutely delicious!!! With baked sweet potatoes and chipotle corn bread, it made a terrific dinner. We will definitely make this meal again; it's easy, healthy, and bursting with flavor.

I had a bunch of turnips with greens from the farmers market and was looking for a recipe to use them. My husband is not a big fan of greens or turnips, but he loved this dish. I took the advice of the previous poster and reduced the liquid which did concentrate the flavor. I found I did not need the added salt, as the Black Forest bacon I used was salty enough for our taste.

This is the best use of turnip greens that I've found. A bunch of three medium to large turnips and their greens is a good amount for this recipe. I used a meaty hambone instead of a ham hock, sucanat instead of white sugar, and only one tablespoon of butter. There was quite a lot of liquid by the time the vegetables were done, so I strained them from the liquid and then reduced it down to a thin glaze (to about 1/4 of the original volume) with the second tablespoon of butter and added just enough back to the vegetables to make them wet and juicy. Very tasty recipe.

Oh my god, I am in love with turnip greens and I am in love with this dish. I made it a week ago as an effort to use the turnips and their greens that came with my share from my local community farm. I forgot the butter the first time around and decided it was fine without it. Also, when I made it the first time, I served it as a side dish. The second time, I ate this dish as a standalone soup. Yummy.

I used rutabaga and kale. Had roasted a spiral ham the day before so used the ham bone. Also used Mac apples as that's what I had on hand. No butter added. Wow...I was surprised at how easy and wonderful this was.

This was MUCH better the next day. So, it would be great for Thanksgiving to make the day ahead. Also, I would recommend using a ham hock and then adding in a bunch of chopped ham in addition. We found that the bites of meat really added to the overall taste. Definitely a lighter side and only for more veggie-friendly people!

great if you like greens and was good for the menu at Thanksgiving. Not my favorite from the Nov issue but my husband raved about this and so did the men at the table who love collards. I would try to find a meatier ham hock next time.

I gave this recipe a "good" score because it is very delicately sweet and healthy tasting. Someone who likes rich food may not like it so much,but I eat like a vegetarian so I enjoyed it.My ham hock did not break down so I did not have a lot of meat in my version.It made quite a bit so after a few days I blended it all up in my cusinart .I preferred it that way,and so did everyone else.It really was a nice change for the use of greens .I would make it again.
