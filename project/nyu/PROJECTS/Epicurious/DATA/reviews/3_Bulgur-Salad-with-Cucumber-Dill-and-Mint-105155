This was a nice easy recipe but i found the Lemon juice to be overpowering. I think next time I will use half as much so that the herbs can come out more.

Although I liked the texture of the bulgur and there were a lot of flavors going on, there was just too much lemon juice for my taste. I would look for other bulgur recipes before I made this one again.

I made this recipe for a summer potluck cookout and it was the hit of the party! I poured the lemon juice/oil mixture over the bulghur and let it sit while I chopped the rest of the ingredients. Doing this gives the bulghur time to absorb the moisture. I didn't have fresh mint on hand so I used dried. I'm sure this is even better with fresh, but everyone loved it anyway!

I made this dish as a side to a very spicy chicken dish  what a great combination! Cut down the lemon juice and replaced about half with water  only used a drizzle of Olive Oil, combination of cilantro and parsley, at least twice as much mint and added some salt. Only 2 small cukes, and no bother with peeling and seeding. Just halved and sliced thinly. It was a big hit with meat and potatoes friends who had no idea what bulgur wheat even was.

this recipe is unclear. Am I to understand that you do not soak the bulgur in boiling water? I have made this salad many times and have never come across this method. I use fine bulgur and soak in hot water until fluffy, about 20 minutes or until the water is absorbed. Then I add the above, plus tomatoes. I don't know how soaking wheat in cold water will soften it?

Basic idea is great, but I needed to substantially modify this recipe. Use fine bulgur (No. 1). Put bulgur in a large bowl and completely cover with cold water plus 1". Allow to soak for up to one hour. Drain in a sieve or colander lined with cheesecloth until dry and fluffy. Set aside. Whisk 1/2 c. lemon juice, 1/3 c. olive oil and minced garlic to taste (I used 5, but I love garlic). Set aside. When preparing the cucumber/herb mixture, substitute cilantro for the parsley and increase the amount of mint to one cup (or more -- if you love mint like we do). Also, mince the green onion. Finally, to this mixture, add once cup of finely chopped sundried tomatoes (in oil). Mix all ingredients together in the large bowl and chill for at least 3 hours to allow the flavors to blend.

This is an excellent recipe. I used coarse bulgur and I was afraid it might not soften enough without the usual advance water absorption technique but it turned out pleasantly chewy. The only change I made was to cut down on the garlic-a lot!! Talk about overkill! All in all a great salad to serve with grilled foods or on a buffet table. The amount of lemon juice is not too much, in case anyone is worried.
