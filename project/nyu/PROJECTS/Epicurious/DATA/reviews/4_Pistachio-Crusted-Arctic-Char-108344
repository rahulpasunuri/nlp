An easy mid week meal that wowed my husband. I served it with an arugula salad made with fresh golden beets, chopped oranges, red onion, olive oil and Champagne vinegar. baked sweet potatoe on the side and a glass of Chardonnay rounded out a delightful meal. I followed the suggestion of using the same pan to fry the skin and put it directly in the oven . Definitely will make again. Certainly would make a great meal for guests!

This recipe was fantastic! I made it exactly the way it is with maybe a little more pepper and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. The flavors worked so well with the arctic char. I can't wait to make it again. It will definitely be one of my go-to recipes for my family.

I absolutely love this recipe. My husband and I have made it many times with any white fish or salmon that looks best at the market. Even my parents, who aren't big fish lovers, really like it. Definitely a keeper, and a great way to impress guests without much work. Enjoy!

I made this last night, and much to my dismay, my food processor is in storage. So, I chopped everything as finely as possible, did the nuts-in-the-ziplock trick and pounded away with a mallet, and simply used one pan for both cooking steps (ovenproof skillet). The fish was very good, I was impressed and plan to share this recipes with our customers at our Pier 46 Seafood Market in Templeton. It's an easy recipe, just mix all ingredients together and throw it on top of the fish. What could be more simple and tasty? Gotta love this website!

Artic char was not available so I used fillet of sole. This recipe brought out the delicate flavor of the fish. It's so simple to make and absolutely delicious.

I make this dish with Chilean sea bass for a delicate, elegant alternative to the char (sea bass takes about 10 minutes longer in the oven). This recipe makes a bit more topping than necessary, so increase the amount of fish. I purchase shelled, unsalted organic pistachios at Whole Foods in the bulk seeds/grains section.

To the cook wondering what to serve with this, I make an "all in salad" of a box of orzo, a cup of another grain such as quinoa, cooked peas and cooked corn cut from 3 ears, all with a dressing of heated olive oil in which I toast a large handful of pine nuts and into which I throuw at the last minute of cooking a handful of chopped fresh basil until it crackles. Pour that over the already mixed together rest of the ingredients and serve warm. As for the fish, I thought it was a great recipe but I had a great deal of left over crust the first time I made it so I have cut that back a bit.

I have been using this extremely easy but impressive recipe for years now when I need something quick for last-minute company. This works great with salmon and tilapia too. Served with a sauteed julienne of zucchini and carrots, and some new potatoes with herbed butter - you can have this lovely meal on the table in less than 30 minutes.

Excellent recipe - easy and very good. I used tilapia and served a simple fruit salad with mint alongside.

I did not have basil on had so I used a combination of fresh tarragon and parsley. I turned out wonderfully. It was so simple to make and so good.

"As good as anything you'd get in the finest restaurant" raved my husband. Absolutely delicious, and easy, too!

I love this recipe and make it often, especially for new guests, it's simple yet elegant and impressive. The only think I struggle with is what to serve with it. Any suggestions? (For the cook asking about Arctic Char: it's a wonderful "cousin" to the salmon, but more delicate and a little less fatty.)

Great crust! We used grouper tonight. I agree, with this cooking method of starting stove top and finishing in the oven, almost any fish will do. (What IS arctic char, anyway??) Beware of adding salt if, like me, you use salted pistachios.

Very good. Need to finely grind nuts, and season fish before adding butter. Butter is probably good w/any fish

Wanted the first dinner I made for my husband (4 days) to be scrumptious. We loved it!!!!!!! Would recommend cooking the fish a little longer (depending on thickness) We will definately make it again. Husband suggests substituting salmon or using the topping to stuff sole. Happy Eating!!!!!!!!!

I've made this several times using both salmon and arctic char. It is an easy quick recipe, though shelling the pistachios is a bit tedious. It is quite good (resturant quality) and has been a hit. I am supprised there are not more comments.

This was absolutely grand! Grilled the fish with the paste on (no browning). It took longer to cook than normal, but was absolutely fabulous when finished. What are you waiting for -- MAKE IT NOW!!
