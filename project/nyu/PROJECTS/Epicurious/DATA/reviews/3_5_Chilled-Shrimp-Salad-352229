Fun, beautiful and quick. I needed the perfect summer dish to serve to our guest and this is it. Everyone loved dinner. The dressing was perfect. We may add mandarin oranges!

This has quickly become one of my favorite summertime recipes. I have made it for company on a number of occasions and always to rave reviews. The older set is sometimes a bit reluctant to try (watermelon and feta, together in a salad?) but all have been enthusiast after tasting. It's a great way to showcase the heirloom tomatoes out of my garden (as well as get rid of some basil) but ultimately it's fresh, cool and just leaves you feeling good.

Grilled the shrimp instead of boiling it to save on creating heat in an already hot kitchen. Served it over soba noodles. My friends looked at me as though I had just placed John the Baptist's head on the table, but they couldn't stop raving once they had tried it.

What a great refreshing meal! Substituted grilled chicken for the shrimp and added a bit of avacado. The flavors worked so well together. Loved it!
