I followed the recipe exactly, and was very disappointed with the soup. Clove flavor is overwhelming.

Very good. I skip the sugar and sometimes make small adjustments, but this is a solid recipe for comforting tomato soup.

Good, healthy, fresh tasting. I added a carrot and half a red pepper to the onions as they sauteed just to have a few more veggies in there. I also had pieces of fresh basil on the table to add to the soup. Yummy.

Very easy tomato soup recipe and a great way to use up all the tomatoes that were too soft for much besides sauce. I forgot the flour but just used a lot less broth and didn't notice the difference. Also tossed in a bell pepper for extra sweetness. Delicious!

This soup is great! I made the recipe as written, except that I used chicken broth and I added a touch of basil at the end of cooking. I used about 7 medium sized fresh tomatoes in total. Before adding the half-and-half, I worried that the soup was too tart, but the cream sweetened it up perfectly! I used my immersion blender and didn't bother straining - there were no bothersome chunks or seeds to contend with. A great, basic recipe that I look forward to experimenting with in the future :)

I consider myself a pretty experienced cook, but apparently I wasn't experienced enough to follow my instincts that this was way too much broth. With the world's best tomatoes, I followed the recipe exactly and the result was watery and bland. I believe all it would need to be exceptional is either severe reduction of or complete omission of broth. The liquid from the tomatoes alone is plenty. One could always add broth at the end and heat the whole thing up if it were found to be too thick or intense. At the end I kept trying to doctor it with more salt, more sugar, lemon juice, and dried basil. A 10% improvement maybe  but what really did the trick was putting it back on the stove for a few hours and letting it simmer-steam away all the excess liquid. Having cooked it down, it was much, much more tomatoey and flavorful - more like a bisque than a soup, which I think most people really prefer.

This is just the thing one needs on a cold autumn afternoon. I made this recipe for my boyfriend who is a big tomato soup fan. I substituted ripe tomatoes for 1 can of crushed tomatoes as they are not in season. I also added 5 cloves of garlic and used chicken base from a local farm instead of vegetable broth. Finally, I used 3 whole cloves and removed them just before pureeing. Garnished with fresh basil! Voila! In case your wondering, it passed his test! Delicious and creamy!!

I like how easy this recipe is with natural flavor. I definitely like it with either yellow or sweet onions. i tried red onion because i had it on hand and not quite the punch you're looking for. I did add rosemary flavored salt and rosemary to it in addition to the cloves. i did use chicken stock because i don't have veggie stock but maybe i'll try that next time. i do love it and LOVE to experiment with such a solid recipe.

I loved this recipe. I made some changes though: I did not use the flour or the cloves. I even forgot the onion! I used chicken broth and white wine. I pureed the veg and 35 oz can of crushed tomatoes. I also added bay leaves. I let it slow simmer for about an hour. I served this with basil pesto grilled cheese sandwiches. I loved it!

I didn't like this as well as other reviewers. I cut back on the cloves but still didn't like the flavor. I also like my Tomato soup creamier. Even after adding double half and half. I will not make this again

I had been searching for a tomato soup to go with my grilled cheese for a while, and this one goes great with it. The only thing I did was add a bit of chopped basil just before I put the soup on to simmer. It gives it something to balance out the cloves a bit. Also, I used an immersion blender instead of a food processor. It doesn't really need the half-and-half; it changes the consistency a bit, but didn't effect the flavor much.

In the middle of making this soup, I realized I didn't have flour, tomato paste or ground clove. I made it any way and used fat free half in half and it was delicious. Squirted a little hot sauce in for spice and topped it with fresh grated parmesean. Served it with grilled cheese sandwiches and it was just like being back in high school only much better.

I made this quickly, in about 20 minutes, missing an onion and cloves. It still turned out great. I added a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes (in juice, no salt added), and substituted whipping cream for half-and-half.

I will be making this tonight. I had to call my mother this week when I was making a batch of vegetable/cabbage soup to find out what her secret spice was that made it taste to good (like campbell's): three whole cloves, that were removed at the end of simmering; also, a touch of mace. It was delicious!. I know a lot of people say that they don't like cloves, too much is overpowering. Removing the whole cloves might produce a milder taste than using ground cloves. Thanks!

This was my first attempt at tomato soup, so I was actually really pleased with how it turned out. I also substituted chicken broth for the vegetable stock, and added some scallions and a diced green chili pepper for a little more zing. Instead of the cloves I threw in some fresh basil during the simmering and the flavor was amazing. My only wish was that it had been a little thicker, which I will work on for next time.

Fabulous way of getting rid of all those late summer tomatoes

Too tomato-y for my taste. To save the pot of soup, I added basil instead of cloves, doubled the sugar and ended up putting in about 1.5 cups of half and half to make it rich and creamy.

I too used garden fresh tomatoes and onions. I also used some chicken bullion (1 cube), and omitted the cloves, as I'm not a fan. It was heavenly. The 7 yr old food critic even said it was better than campbells.

Delicious! It was a great use of all those end of summer tomatoes, and pretty simple to make. I don't think it needs the half-and-half. It was tasty before I added it at the end.

Delicious. My friends raved about this dish. I used fresh garden tomatoes and onions, a whole head of garlic, and chicken broth. I also added in a little chicken bouillon to up the flavor a bit. Ground the cloves myself and used about 1/4 tsp. I used my crappy blender with great success. It's very important to strain the soup, especially if you use a crappy blender. There were tons of seeds and stringy pieces of skin left behind that I'm sure would be unpleasant if left in the dish. Straining was not the big pain other reviewers make it out to be. I didn't weigh the tomatoes, but I used about 18-20 small romas. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wonderful..... I didnt have any chicken or veggie broth but used beef instead. I thought it was going to be a disaster but suprisingly wasnt. Easy recipe but, the straining of soup takes awhile so plan ahead

I made this as part of a vegetarian Easter lunch, and it was fantastic. Cooked it the night before, halving the recipe since there were only two of us. It warmed up beautifully the next day. I used canned whole tomatoes, crushed by hand, and Knorr vegetable gelatin-type bouillon (all I can get here in my tiny French town). They don't have half-and-half here, so I just mixed equal parts whole milk and cream. Used a little more than called for. In short, this recipe tasted rich and delicious, with balanced flavors and lovely buttery undertones. I didn't have anything to purée it with, but the chunkiness wasn't an issue. Superb, easy, and I will definitely make it again.

Very very good. I can't imagine why anyone would say it's bland, in fact is very rich and creamy. I only changed the veggie broth for chicken broth, and used cummin instead of cloves, mostly because cloves are a bit too strong for my personal taste. It turned out delicious and was a big hit with my famisly

Definitely a good recipe, in part b/c it's so easy. I actually forgot about the cloves and thought it needed a little zing so added some crushed red pepper flakes. Would also skip the sugar and add grated or finely chopped carrot instead.

Holy Cow!!! My mom wanted me to make a tomato soup like her grandmother would have made...so I looked for the simplist recipe..lo and behold, wow!! Simple, followed exactly. Used whole ripe tomatoes from the garden....blanched them in boiling water to skin them...then seeded them by hand. No sieving needed. Used chicken broth instead of veggie...typically veggie stock is too heavy in squash flavor. Wrong flavor for tomato soup...Recommend trying soup before you add the cloves, some people may not appreciate it.

Exceptional. I had only half the amount of fresh tomatoes required (plum) so used half canned. Also I had no cloves so used ground toasted cumin and a pinch of cayenne. The colour and falvour of this were stunning and I didnt add cream to my portion. My partner did and we both loved it. I was surprised that one reviewer found it watery as it was anything but! I will make it again and to the exact recipe to see if it;s very different but as it was it was fantastic.

I used this recipe for my first shot at making homemade tomato soup, and it was a success. It's not flashy or super complex as far as flavor and components go, but it's just plain delicious. It is a good reciped to build on, play around with, and modify. (oh, and i used two medium sized leaks instead of a large onion, which worked really well)

I made this for dinner and it was fabulous. I served it with grilled cheese on rye. I made a few modifications. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I substituted three 15 ounce cans of dice tomatoes (fire roasted and one made with burgundy wine). I used chicken stock instead of vegetable. I also added about 1/2 cup port wine, about 1/2 cup sun dried tomatoes and a tbsp of pesto. Instead of straining, I just used an immersion blender to puree most of the soup, but left a few chunks. I served the soup with some chopped fresh mint on top.

This is good on a cold night. I served it with sandwiches on rye made with leftover roast ham. I made the soup with canned chicken broth to make it easier. I also added 1/4 tsp ground cloves plus a little more as it was too bland with only the 1/8 tsp. This plus salt and pepper to taste before serving brought out the tomato flavor. My husband really liked the slight clove taste. We had end of season tomatos from our garden that had to be used - this recipe was a perfect solution.

This is the best tomato soup ever! We added a bit of dried tarragon, and 1 cup of pasta. We did not put the soup through a sieve, and it was perfect! If there were more forks, I'd fill them in!

i wasnt to impressed with the soup. I followed it exactly, and I think it took some hard work that was not worth it. My mom tasted it though and liked it, but i didnt think it was creamy enough and the clove ruined the taste.

Loooooved this soup! I used canned veggie broth as well. Plus, since I love the flavor of roasted tomatoes, I roasted one pound of cherry tomatoes then used 2 cans of diced tomatoes as well. At the end I added a handful of fresh basil and a pinch of red pepper flakes. It was a smidge salty, so next time I won't add additional salt. But overall... very flavorful & delish!

This recipe was delicious as is, but we sprinkled some grated cheddar cheese & chives on top for garnish. It was nothing like tomato soup from a can, but that's the point! It had just the right flavors from the onion, garlic, and cloves. Also, I didn't end up using a food processor - that was very messy. I used my good old fashioned food mill. Had my friend over for lunch and she couldn't get enough of this ;-) Always a good sign!

We made this for a party of 20. Served the soup in little bowls with mini grilled cheese and got rave reviews. I did make modifications. Did not use cloves. Used half fresh tomato and half boxed freshed cut (similar to canned). Added chicken boullion to give more body, and used half a cup of heavy crem to give a little more body. This use so easy to make. Next time I would use chix brith instead of veggie.

I made two changes to this: canned veg broth and whole milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2. I enjoyed this soup and it was certainly better than plain campbells! The recipe was easy to follow as well. I thought it needed some extra spice, so I added some fresh basil.
