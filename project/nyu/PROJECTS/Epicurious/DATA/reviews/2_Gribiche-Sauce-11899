This recipe is wrong wrong wrong wrong. This for a really poor tarter sauce. This sauce doesn't have mayonaisse. You use hard boiled egg yolk mashed up and emulsified with oil, preferably a neutral oil like canola oil. After you do that you add capers, cornichons, chervil, parsley, and tarragon and juilienne egg white. And you don't serve it with shell fish or seafood. This is for meat, traditionally calf brains. Please have some respect for our chef forefathers.

I prefer not to use maionnese, but just extra virgin olive oil, instead.
