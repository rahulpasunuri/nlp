delicious and simple as is... i spice up my crust with a little cinnamon and sometimes use a more traditional graham cracker crust but all that is just rearranging deck chairs on a wonderful cruise ship.

I kept it in the oven until it reached an internal temp of 148, snd then let it rest. Also baked it on an insulated cookie sheet, keeps the direct infrared heat off of the springform pan. Came out perfect.

Fabulous recipe! Creamy and delicious!!! Can't go wrong with this recipe. Any cheesecake that we eat out--even at fine dining establishments--hasn't come close to this recipe. You won't be disaappointed!

I am giving this 4 forks because the taste was exceptional. Probably the best cheesecake I have eaten. I struggled with the execution, however. I baked the cheesecake for 35 minutes - the middle was jiggly, but it was supposed to be. I cooled the cake for 20 minutes and added the topping. The topping sunk in the center - my cake wasn't baked at all. I am not having oven problems - if anything, my oven runs a bit hot. I ended up baking the cheesecake with the topping sunk to the center for at least another 30 minutes. I was going to pitch it, but decided to taste it and it was wonderful. But it seems that I was the only one to have the issue with the baking time. Does anyone have any suggestions?

I made this for Christmas Eve....AMAZING. Of course I did a couple things to make this my own. I took the Gingerbread Snowflake recipe (used Oat Flour) and made the crust for the cheesecake with it. I also used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese...had to bake it about 10 minutes longer but everyone loved each bite and probably didn't know I made it low-fat. I decorated the top with gingerbread boy cut-outs.

The reviews don't lie. This cheesecake was absolutely stupendous. The presentation was beautiful! And the texture and taste were unbelievably delicious. I will unequivocally make this cheesecake again. My family and guests could not believe I made it! I did use graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers. I would give this a 10 if there were 10 forks.

Followed the filling exactly. It came out great! I only had gingersnap cookies on hand, so I made a gingersnap cookie crust instead. The pair came out great even without the topping. Will try the exact recipe next time.

Hey Caponata, you were supposed to take cheesecake out of oven after 25-30 min. and cool on rack (not in oven). You were to keep oven on (door closed) so you could put cheesecake back in oven after putting sour cream topping on it. Better luck next time!

Question to those who've successfully made the cake!! The recipe says "...s shaken gently, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool slightly in springform pan on rack, about 20 minutes. (Cheesecake will continue to set as it cools.) Leave oven on." I baked it for 30 min (170 C), then I opened the oven door and baked for another 20 min with the open door - "left the oven on", as the recipe said. Took it out of the oven just now. The surface cracked. I guess it is a sign it was overcooked :( did I do something wrong?

This dessert is heavenly. I'm not a big baker, so I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using a graham cracker crust instead of vanilla wafers. Do not skip the sour cream topping! It makes it a professional sophisticated dish. I read the reviews beforehand, and I was concerned about the cooking time. The cake did come out a bit loose out of the oven, but after setting in the fridge overnight it was perfect. I would not overtake this dish! I guess it boils down to personal preference, and I prefer a creamier consistency. This was my 'practice run' before serving guests- I will make it the day before and it will be perfect! I also topped it with fresh raspberries- delicious!

This was my first cheesecake ever made from scratch. Everybody at home really loved it. It lasted one day only. Because I read all the reviews I didn't love it but it was my fault. I over baked it fearing it would be too liquid in the center and it turned out firm but the flavor is delicious. Today I'm baking it for the second time and I will follow the baking time as given in the recipe.

Made this twice, the second time I read some great tips by other reviewers. I used my own fresh bantam eggs and it made it a brilliant yellow, since I feed my girls lots of sunflower seeds along with their daily bug intake from the pesticide free yard. My second one was better from reducing the butter in the crust by 1/3 and doubling the lemon juice and adding the zest of one lemon. It helped temper the sweetness. I also substituted half the sugar with Stevia, but you could taste the difference if you were looking for it. I also made a cherry topping with a bottle of dark cherries in light syrup from Trader Joe's by cooking them down a bit and adding some cornstarch, sugar and a squeeze of lemon juice. After cooking it looks like it might be a mousse in the middle so, shut the oven off and leave the door ajar for an hour, then put it on a rack for another hour and then in the fridge overnight, I transported it on ice as well. The hostess offered to buy the recipe from me !! ( I sent her a link)

Followed recipe exactly and it was stellar. I gave the recipe to a friend of mine who made it for a dessert dash at our school's art auction. My husband ended up picking out the cheesecake and the whole table thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't realize until much later that it was the same recipe! A true blind taste test!

This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made. Always gets rave reviews when serving. And, it is not fussy, no bain marie! The sour cream topping makes the presentation clean. I do make one significant change which makes it both gluten free and adds more flavor. Instead of the vanilla wafer crust, I make a crust from amaretti cookies (8 oz.) and butter (6 tablespoons). I pulverize the cookies in a food processor (or you can crush in a baggie) and add the melted butter. I press into the spring form pan and bake at 375° for 10 minutes. This will put this recipe over the edge! I promise!

This is my absolute favorite cheesecake recipe! I've made it a number of times and it's always a huge hit. I do, however, have a question: Does anyone think this would make a good oreo cheesecake recipe (meaning I would add oreos to this recipe)? The cake is so smooth and light, I'm not sure if the richness of oreos would add or detract from the texture. Thoughts?

I love this cheesecake and it is my definite go-to recipe when I need to bring a dessert. I have altered the recipe a bit to make it 'low-carb' though. I do not make the crust, I just line the pan with parchment paper and grease it with unsalted butter. Then I replace all the sugar with Splenda for baking. This makes a creamy and delicious cheesecake that is friendly for diabetics and people on low-carb diets. I do consistently have a problem with cracking though. The only thing I haven't tried is baking it in a pan of water, but I haven't quite figured out how to do that...

Rating: 4
This is secret weapon in my arsenal of great recipes. The first time I made this cheesecake I used the wrong size pan and neglected to leave it in the oven long enough. It turned out to be more like a cheesecake mousse. It was a delicious cheesecake mousse. I have since made it 6 more times ( I am still using the wrong size pan). For anyone that only has an 8" springform pan leave the cheesecake in for 45 minutes. If you want to WOW your family, office, or guests make this cheesecake. I must warn you. Be prepared to be adored.

Rating: 4
PLEASE use half the butter in the crust if you make this. I'm not exaggerating. I was incredulous but figured I'd try the recipe ... My crust melted down the sides of the pan and formed a pool of melted butter and crumbs. I eventually cracked the springform pan a little to let it drain. I'm not an amateur baker and should have followed my instinct rather than the recipe. The good news is that everything else can be followed to a T, and it's just amazing ... a tie for the best cheesecake I've ever made. Worth spilling butter in my oven and a little pride!

This is a great basic cheesecake. I used whole foods vanilla wafers and didn't have enough to measure 8 1/2 oz. so had to supplement with ginger snaps since that's all I had. Crust was decent-maybe a little greasy so next time I'll use less butter. Also will add a lot more lemon or maybe the white chocolate like other reviewers suggested to enhance the flavor. Had to bake an extra 15 minutes and the top cracked but it tasted great and with the sour cream topping you can't tell anyway. Used 8 oz mascarpone, 16 oz. cream cheese and 4 oz neufchatel (because that's what I had)

It was dream-like!!! This is what I think of when I wnat cheesecake, but seldom get. NOTE: when you ground the vanilla wafers to make a crust. . .really make a dust, and then add the butter.

Rating: 4
This is by far my favorite Cheesecake recipe. I always bake this for extra time (depending on the oven I use this can be 5 - 20 minutes extra!)so that the cake does not come out too liquidy. However, even the first time I made this cake when it did come out too liquidy, it was completely gobbled up! I generally have a problem with the top of the cake cracking, since I can't figure out how to do a water bath correctly, but I usually remedy that by topping the cheesecake with some fresh fruit. Unless absolutely necessary, I wouldn't recommend any other topping as this cake has a rich, creamy taste and texture that would only be hindered by, say, pie filling or chocolate.

Rating: 4
I used Trader Joe's vanilla wafers to make this crust. It seemed too buttery and the sides collapsed during baking. I pushed them up with a spoon while the crust was hot. Next time I will increase the ratio of wafers to butter. Since I don't like a sour cream topping on cheesecake, I omitted that step and topped with caramel sauce. I baked the cheesecake for 45 minutes continuously at 350°. It came out with slightly puffed edges and a little jiggly. It set up well overnight. I had to wrap the springform in foil to prevent butter from leaking out the bottom, and baked over a shallow pan of water on the bottom rack, to prevent cracking. Came out looking beautiful.

Rating: 4
Quick & easy recipe. I add 1/2 cup melted white chocolate chips - it adds "something" that guests can't quite identify. Also add about 1 tsp. lemon zest to the cheesecake. And have used Peak Frean's Lifestyle Lemon Crisp cookies for the crust instead of vanilla wafers (eliminate the sugar though).

I have made this twice (although using a different crust) and it is fantastic. My husband is not easily impressed and he thinks this is amazing. Use vanilla bean paste in the sour cream mixture for a very pretty topping with little vanilla bean dots.

So frustrated..just finished making this...haven't tried it yet. It may be the best cheesecake, but the recipe sucks. I followed the directions, but it was liquid in the center.

Wonderful taste and creamy cheesecake (even if overbaked a little to be more cakey). I too, was concerned about it being underdone...20 minutes (plus rest) and 10 more...not enough time for the cheesecake to reach a safe 145-150F internally to cook the eggs. I have a thermometer in the oven to make sure it's at the right temp, and a stoneware piece to keep it even. At 20 minutes, it was super jiggly - I cooked 5 minutes more...still jiggly...and then I stuck in a meat thermometer. 100F. So - in the end it baked about 40m @350F, cooled the 20 minutes, then the sour cream layer for 10 minutes, then cooled in the oven (off propped open) for an hour. then an hour on the counter, then in the fridge. Cooking only 20-30min might get you a creamy cheesecake after refrigerated 8 hrs, but the eggs never cooked to high enough a temp. It IS a good cheesecake though, and mine is more cakey than creamy, but it's still a creamy cakey and the taste w/ the marscapone is WONDERFUL.

I love this recipe! Aside from finding the actual Mascarpone Cheese (I had to go to an Italian Grocery to find it), this cake was remarkably easy to make and had very little cracking. I did have some trouble with the cake actually being a bit too creamy (almost liquidy at the bottom) but I think that may have been more on the fault of my oven, which bakes at very high temperatures. I ended up leaving this cake in the oven an extra 15 minutes for it to be done. I actually have a question: When I created this cake for the very first time, I omitted the Sour Cream topping and replaced it with Cherries (it was for someone who loved cherries). I intend to bake this next for someone who loves Peanutbutter & Chocolate, so will drizzle those on top of the cake. Should I drizzle chocolate & peanutbutter on top of the Sour Cream topping, or omit the topping and drizzle it on top of the cake? I have never made the Sour Cream topping and have no idea what it tastes like, so am not sure if it will go well with chocolate & peanutbutter. Thanks! :)

This is a great recipe. I've tried it both ways, and I prefer firm to creamy, so I would cook the extra 10 minutes. Also, I like to add white chocolate to mine (melted in a small amount of heavy cream and blended in) -- depending on how much you add, it can be a subtle enhancer or truly a "white chocolate cheesecake." People love it and can't quite place what the flavor is from.

This is 'oh my god good' cheesecake! I've made it twice and both times it got rave reviews. This first time I cooked it exactly as written, except I did let it cook about 10 minutes longer then described after reading the reviews here. Cooked it the same way the second time, but doubled the amount of lemon juice in the cake part to give it just a little more tang to balance the sweetness, which I though made it perfect, not 'lemony.'

If you are searching for the perfect cheesecake, look no further; you have arrived. This cake is smooth and creamy. It has the perfect level of sweetness. It is just so darn good; it was the most popular dessert at a very well-stocked Thanksgiving desert table. It does however need more cooking time. I understand that it won't fully be set; but at the designated time, it was still runny. Just let it bake past the time until you arrive at your desired level. I baked until it was nearly firm.

My boyfriend has made this recipe three times now in his cast iron skillet and it has turned out beautifully each time. The presentation is more rustic because you have to serve it in the skillet, but the thickness of the skillet seems to reduce surface cracking by slowing down the setting process, much like a water bath. The cooking time needs to be lengthened slightly to compensate for the extra pan thickness, approximately 10 minutes longer than stated. We came upon this recipe because my daughter requested the "creamiest, richest cheesecake out there" for her birthday. This one fits the bill wonderfully. Don't do it if you are too concerned about calories.

Best cheesecake I have ever made. Light creamy not too sweet not to sour as some can be. I made it for Thanksgiving as an alternative to the pumpkin pie and the cheesecake was gone by the end of the night. I have cooked it for the time specified in the recipe and for a bit longer the second time I made it. It's creamier when cooked as the recipe is written. I now don't add the extra time as I like it creamier but its a personal preference.

Delicious and everyone loved it for Father's Day. It seemed totally uncooked after the directed time. I baked it an extra 15 minutes based on the reviews. However, it did get much firmer after sitting and I will not add the extra time next time, since I'm a fan of creamy, not firm, cheesecake.

Nothing but rave reviews for this cheesecake! I did a holiday version with Swetzel's Spiced Wafer cookies for the crust instead. It came out fantastic! This was the first cheesecake I've ever made, and I had no problems at all. I found sometimes I needed to use more than the recipe called for to fill the pan with crust, but it's easy to modify that. Everyone who ate this had a hard time believing I made it! It's rich but not too dense, and the lemon and sour cream makes it light on the tongue. My new favorite!

We are a gluten-free family, so cheesecake is the dessert of choice at my house. I've been on the prowl for the ultimate cheesecake recipe for the past three years and this is finally it! I've tried this recipe in several iterations: individual mini-cakes, sugar-free with Splenda, gluten-free cookie crust, crustless, etc. and after about 12 tries I boldly declare this recipe fool-proof. Unlike many more pernisckety cheesecakes, this recipe doesn't require a water bath or leaving it in the oven with the door ajar for an hour post-baking. Even the prep is relatively straightforward! But it's the texture that will really win you over: perfectly dense like a NY style, but with a lighter mouthfeel due to the mascarpone. This recipe produces winning results every single time! Is there any higher praise? P.S. Also tastes fab with the balsamic strawberries recipe also on this site!

Wow...this is a PERFECT cheesecake...I brought this treasure to a dinner party, and had placed the cake in a pink box from the grocery store. The cheesecake was so good that the guests were questioning whether or not I had actually baked the cheesecake, or just bought it! I piled a basket each of strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries on top, after soaking them in 3 TBSP of vodka, 1/4 C sugar, and 2 TSP vanilla extract. Not only did this create a stunning and foolproof visual (just pile up the berries on the cake; no talent required!), but it also complemented the tanginess of the chessecake wonderfully. 35 minutes was the magic number for me. No cracking on this particular cake, but the previous one did - easy fix when you put the sour cream topping (or berries) on top. No one will ever know! This recipe is so good, I don't think I even want to bother with any others. I will be baking this cheesecake over and over again.

Sublime! Your diners will worship at your feet. My favorite version from previous cooks' comments: adding 1/2 cup finely shredded marmalade to the cheesecake batter and making the crust with the addition of amaretti - 3/4 butter cookie to 1/4 amaretti seems about right proportion. I also like the crumbs coarser rather than finer.

the best cheesecake i have ever had! it is rich and creamy, and melts in your mouth, but not as dense as others i have tried- which to me is a good thing. i have made it several times- the center sank once because i did not let the cheesecake cool long enough before i put on the sour cream topping(impatient), but it was still most definitely delish!

I added the zest of two lemons and an extra 1/2 tsp of lemon juice (and since I have such a hard time counting to 3 an extra egg).

Even though the cake set overnight in the fridge the centre fell just a bit when i spooned the topping on.

wow! I enjoyed every second of eating this cake as did everyone else. I was very apprehensive about how jiggly the cheesecake was when I took it out of the oven after 25 minutes.

This is a great plain cheesecake, but light and fluffy in texture. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully!

I made this for Easter and it really was the best cheescake ever- although I like most cheescakes but this one was killer. It was creamy, had an excellent taste and nice texture. I used a graham cracker crust, added another tsp each of lemon juice and vanilla to the cheese mixture. I don't think I would add more lemon juice as I like a plain old traditional cheesecake. I also beat two of the egg whites and folded them in. And I did bake it for about 12 minutes longer. My nephew who does not like desserts at all loved this- as did everyone who had some. I have one slice left in the fridge and I am willing myself away from it. Definitely a keeper and I will make it again.

Based on the all the comments...I added 2 TBS of cornstarch and baked for an extra 10 minutes before cooling and adding the sour cream topping. Cheesecake set well and sliced perfectly. I also baked ahead of time...chilled 1 day and then carefully wrapped and froze it. I thawed for about 5 hrs and kept chilled until time to serve it. It got rave reviews as the "Best Plain Cheesecake Ever"! A Keeper!

I made this over the weekend. I am not a fan of cheesecake (I made it for my husband and kids who love it) and I thought it was very good (they loved it!). It was very light, but full bodied at the same time. The flavor could have used a little more oomph (next time I will put lemon zest in) and I thought there was too much butter for the crust, but overall it was very good.

i bake this every year for my beloved's birthday - at his request. it looks picture perfect and tastes divine. too bad it's such a calorie bomb! but once a year can't hurt... and it truly is delectable. if you're looking for a dry, dense NY cheesecake or a käsekuchen, this is not it - this is tender and creamy. surefire!

Not the easiest cheese cake I've made, but by far one of the best (could even be the best). It received rave reveiws by everyone who tried it and they keep asking me to make it again.

A bit time consuming with all the cooling and re-baking between layers, but well worth it! It's a lot creamier and lighter than I had expected from a cheesecake. I thought it was even better the next day after being in the refrigerator overnight.

This is so good it's freakish! I made this for an italian wine tasting dinner and all of the guests ate two pieces! They all think I am an expert baker but they have no idea how easy this recipe is! Second time I served it with the balsamic strawberries on the side (a recipe also on this site).

Ok, I am not generally a big cheesecake fan, but I needed a dessert that could be made a couple of days ahead to bring to a Christmas dinner at the in-laws. If you want a simple, plain, but very elegant dessert choice this is it. Everyone loved it! (they asked to keep the leftovers for themselves). I made it with a pecan/ginger crust from the pumpkin cheesecake recipe on this site (made before to rave reviews as well) and because I thought the top looked plain and uninteresting, I made up a quick topping to pipe around the edge of some leftover cream cheese and mascarpone cheese whipped together with sugar and a little cream (this, incidently, was delicious and the leftover went into tart shells for another occasion). I did cook it for about 40 minutes for the filling, and 15+ for the topping, thanks to all the others who suggested this .... I think this was about the perfect amount. I do think a fruit sauce would be nice with it next time, although it stands well anyway on its own.

I made this cheesecake last year for our Christmas dinner dessert. It was the creamiest best cheesecake I had ever tasted, and everyone agreed with me. I am making it again this year, and, who knows, maybe it will become a new holiday tradition for our family.

I couldn't believe all of the comments made about this recipe - but having made this cheesecake, I tend to agree that it is one of the best - if not the best. I did not use a bain marie, I added only 5 minutes to the initial baking time, and an additional 5 minutes to the topping time. I had no cracks, no soupiness, no problems at all. I did add some Amaretto di Sarrano crumbs to the vanilla wafer crumbs. They were a pleasant addition, but I shall add more the next time. In short, this cake is definitely a keeper. By the way - no fruit sauces of any sort are necessary.

this is my new fave of cheesecakes. Easy to make and deelish. The mascarpone gave the cheesecake a mild creamy flavor that I loved. It wasn't too sweet or rich. My boyfriend loved it and he's not a sweets guy. I also baked a bit longer according to the previous bakers; it was perfect. I used reduced-fat Nilla Wafers, that stayed crunchy, which I also liked. My new fave!

This cheesecake had the most marvelous texture. It was the perfect combination of creamy and firm. But I did have problems. First the crust, though I baked it for 15 min, was underdone and did not stand up well. Also, I did not have enough crust to reserve for the topping; I needed to use it all to get the sides up high enough. The filling was the right texture after adding an extra 5 min, but the flavour was pretty bland. I used high quality ingredients too. The topping added nothing extra to the cake, it was also fairly bland, and I think could have been skipped and a raspberry sauce or something made instead. I will make the cake again, but I will either add more lemon juice and/or make a sauce.

A friend of mine made this for our poker party. It was so good so I decided to make this myself. I agree with the other reviewers that you need to add an additional 10 mins during the bake time for it to firm up. I definetly recommend this to cheesecake lovers!!

Rating: 4
I always wondered what a "little bit of heaven on earth" would taste like, and now I know. A minor suggestion would be to pulverize the entire box of vanilla wafers and then measure out the suggested amount. I originally did the recipe using the 8.5 ounces recommended, but there seemed to be too much butter for that amount of crumbs. On the other hand, there were no complaints from the tasters. I baked the crust 5-10 minutes more and the filling for 10-15 minutes more than the recipe advises. Do NOT skip the topping: it gives the cake a wonderful tangy contrast.

Outstanding!!! I make a lot of cheesecake and this is by far the stand out. I'm making it for my wedding!!! I cook it a bit longer at a lower temp in a waterbath and ditch the topping.

Wonderful. I baked this one for 30 minutes (per the recipe) but was nervous when I read all the reviews about adding extra minutes to avoid undercooking. So I added 5 minutes to the sour cream topping bake (for a total of 15 minutes). I also ran a thin knife around the edge to help avoid the cracking issue. The cake set up beautifully, no cracking. The end result was a creamy, eye-roll back delicious cheesecake with a crust that was spectacular. Per my husband: he rates it a B, because he is a "New York" dense kinda cheesecake guy. This is definitely a different mouth feel. This does make it into our family cookbook however, due to the "eye-roll back" quality (the criteria to make the cut). Goodluck to all who try to make this. It's worth the effort. Thank you Epicurious! Maplegirl P.S. I was thinking about adding a fruit sauce but this really doesn't need anything more. It stands alone!

I made this cheescake for a jewelry party I was hosting. It was a total hit! It looked perfect - the topping helps cover any imperfections (i.e. cracking). Everyone loved it (especially my cheescake junkie 9 year old son)! The girl who designs the jewelry asked me to make her one to bring to her mothers for a holiday dinner. Long story short - it was a flop. But, based on my 1st experience, I would make it again!

Cooks Illustrated: Why Do Cheesecakes Crack? What we learned from two months of baking was that when the internal temperature of a cheesecake rose beyond 160 degrees, it almost always cracked. The best way to prevent cracking is to use an instant-read thermometer to test the cheesecake's doneness. Take it out of the oven when it reaches 150 degrees at the center to avoid overbaking. That said, there is a second opportunity for the cheesecake to crack, this time outside of the oven. During testing, a perfectly good-looking cake cracked as it sat on the cooling rack. Evidently, the cake shrank during cooling and clung to the sides of the springform pan. If the cake clings tenaciously enough, it splits at its weakest point, the center. To avoid this type of late cracking, free the cheesecake from the sides of the pan with a paring knife as soon as it comes out of the oven. What causes the cheesecakes that I bake to crack down the middle? According to our test kitchen, cheesecakes commonly crack due to overcooking. Cheesecakes should be removed from the oven when a 3-inch circle in the middle of the cake wobbles slightly. Although it still looks uncooked, residual heat will continue the cooking, and, when chilled, the cheesecake will have a perfectly smooth consistency.

This is by far the best cheesecake recipe I have come across. I have now made this three times and it is always a hit. Two suggestions, bake the cake with the filling for 35 min, then bake with the topping for 20 min.

Only lost one fork because it cracked and looked pretty sad(but it might have been my sugar subs). I was looking for a recipe that started out great so I could try to "low carb" it. This one worked great-I used an all nut crust(pecans/almonds/almond flour/melted butter and some artificial sweetener). I used artificial sweetener and some extra vanilla in the cheesecake portion-so good! I tastes like rich original cheesecake. I loved the suggestion to leave in the oven for an hour after turning it off.

This is by far the best cheesecake I have ever tasted. Each holiday I try a new cheesecake recipe from epicurious and now I have no reason to do so again. This will be made for every occasion.

For Easter Sunday, I had planned to use the same dependable cheesecake recipe I use each year, until I read the rave reviews associated with THIS one. And it was worth the deviation from tradition! Without a doubt, this is one of THE best cheesecakes I've ever made. It was easy, rich delicious & got rave reviews. The only problem I had was that my sour cream topping was too thin, probably because I made it with my electric mixer. Next time, I'll do it by hand to prevent this from happening. My only change to the recipe was that I used a traditional zwieback crust, which suited the filling perfectly. Thanks to all the cooks who recommended this recipe so highly - it will definitely be the recipe I use from this day forward. This truly IS "the perfect cheesecake". Note: A tip to prevent cracking - when the cheesecake has finished baking (after adding the sour cream topping), turn off the oven & leave the cake in the oven to cool slowly with the door ajar for 1 hour. Then, cool at room temperature for another hour before putting it in the fridge. It works!

This cheesecake is so amazing that I see no reason to try any other recipe. The texture was perfect, the crust was delicious, the presentation was gorgeous. The taste, out of this world. I made this for my girlfriends birthday and it was a huge hit. It was also pleasantly easy to make. I followed the instructions exactly. The cake was very jiggly when I took it out of the oven, which made me a bit nervous, but it had the extra 10 minutes in the oven after I added the topping, and it set very well in the fridge overnight. It was perfect! A keeper for sure!

Rich and creamy, yet light. I did bake it 10 minutes longer, and it's a good thing because it was still very loose in the center even after 10 hours in the fridge. It still tasted wonderful, but presentation was a little off because the slices slumped into mush in the center. I may bake it even longer next time, and use a water bath.

This is a great cheesecake. As I live in France, the real cream cheese isn't available, not where I live. So, I substituted Tartiner au Nature, a close second, but it is lighter and creamier in texture, requiring a longer baking time. I also substitued creme fraiche epaisse, 30% for sour cream, that worked well. The crust was made with Galettes au Beurre, or bretonne, these were delicious. All in all, a real hit, I've made it 3 times this week. Once for friends, once for our anniversary and another one for a friend who NEEDS cheesecake, she must have the American experience. So far, she's a convert.

I have made this cheesecake a total of four times. I am diabetic and have been able to modify it by using Splenda, low fat cream creese and low fat sour cream. The marscapone cheese is the ingredient that gives this cheesecake it's great flavor! I top it off with fresh berries, and it is has always been a hit! Also must use graham cracker crust instead of the one featured in this recipe.

This is the best cheesecake ever. I doubled the recipe with no ill effects. The vanilla cookie crust is quite good and I would certainly make it this way again, but next time I make it, I will probably use the classic graham cracker crust for a perfect, iconic cheesecake.

I've made many cheesecakes and I like this recipe the best. Just the right balance of sweetness and cheesiness. I like not having the water bath--something that has resulted in soggy crusts in the past. The cheesecake cracked in the oven, but the crack was hidden by the sour cream. Overall, it was delicious and my guests gobbled it up.

This was the best cheesecake recipe I have ever used, and the best cheesecake I have ever had! The cake is nice and creamy, but not too sweet. It's great with fruit (especially berries), chocolate, or candy on top. I used a water bath and increased the time for 15-20 minutes and had no problems with cracking or removal from the pan. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

The best cheesecake I've ever made! It's very smooth and creamy, not dense like a New York style cheesecake. It looks quite loose and wobbly when you take it out of the oven, but it sets up while it chills, so don't overbake it. The crust is great--worth the time. I've made this twice and it did crack once, but the sour cream topping hides any imperfections.

This cheesecake never really firms up in the oven but don't worry about it. If you follow the cooking instructions it will be very loose. The 8 hour chill time fixes that and helps the crust stay together when slicing (although I used traditional graham cracker). I thought this cheesecake was wonderful! The best I've ever made. I'll try the crust too next time. It did crack though. Let me know if you solve that problem. I ran a knife around the edge but maybe a water bath or a lower temp longer?

I tried this cake last night and it was absolutely dreamy and easy to make. At first it I thought a cheesecake should bake longer than 35-40 min (total) but it really turned out to be the best cheescake that I have ever eaten. (I have had many different cheesecakes) Just make sure to beat your cheeses until they are very fluffy before adding the other ingredients.
