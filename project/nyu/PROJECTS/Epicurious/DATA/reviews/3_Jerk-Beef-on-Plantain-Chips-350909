My hubby and I make this recipe frequently. It's a big hit with great flavor, and not too labor-intensive.

Simple and awesome. One of the earlier reviewers suggested tasting the Jerk seasoning, which is probably a good idea--if you don't like Jerk seasoning this is probably not a good choice--but cooking and the onion/cilantro salsa cut the spiciness a bit.

I didn't have jerk seasoning paste, so I made some by mixing together: 1 T. Jerk Seasoning, 1 T. Olive Oil, 1 t. Balsamic Vinegar, and 1 t. Minced Garlic. Also, instead of the onion- cilantro topping, I spooned a little store bought mango lime salsa on each. They were delicious... since they're bite-sized, they were gobbled up quickly and everyone asked for the recipe.

I enjoyed this, and so did my guests. I did it without the onion cocktail. I have a small baby and the intricatge bits got complicated in the end, so i gave up on it.

Before you make this I would strongly suggest that you taste the topping. It's quick to make so you can try it before cooking the beef. I really disliked it. This would have been a terrible waste of good, expensive tenderloin.

I served this at Christmas Eve dinner as appetizer and got raved reviews. I used fried leeks in place of onions. At the New Year's party I used steamed fingerling potatoes (sliced in to 1/8 in. disks) in place of plantain chips and liked it equally well. Either way, the presentation was impressive.

Fabulous! Made this for a New Year's celebration in Toronto. We made fresh plantain chips (highly recommended!) Great recipe.

Easy and impressive. My jarred onions were very wet after chopping with the cilantro, so I had to pat them dry w/paper towels. Next time I will chop onions seperately so I can dry them without ruining the look of the cilantro.
