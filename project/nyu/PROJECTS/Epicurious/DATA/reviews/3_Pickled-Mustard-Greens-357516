This was pretty decent and goes really well with the Sichuan beef noodle soup. I would agree with some of the readers, though, that as currently written, the dish is far too sweet. I added a teaspoon of sugar and that worked well for me. For other readers, I would suggest adding a little bit of sugar and tasting to see if any additional sugar was needed-this way you don't wind up with a dish that is sweeter than what you'd like.

Why is this called "pickled?" I skipped over looking for something with vinegar!

I thought this was good, but not great. It was a little too sweet and the texture was not that desirable. I served over brown rice.
