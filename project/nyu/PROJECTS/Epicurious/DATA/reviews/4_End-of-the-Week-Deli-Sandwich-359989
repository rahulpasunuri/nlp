OK, at little too much pesto.

I too make this sandwich on Trader Joe's Cibatta - a trick is to pull out the extra bread in the top half of the sandwich before baking,. This allows the filling to sort of "anchor" into the top of the sandwich - I use this trick on my burgers as well when using thick buns. As for the person who wondered about a vegetarian mayo substitute, at my local (Southern California) health food store, they sell a product called "Veganaise" (not sure if I'm spelling it correctly), which is a quite delicious vegetarian sub for mayo, but not particularily low fat (sorry!). It lasts only a scant two weeks in the frig so don't overbuy if you don't need it. But I really like the flavor and I am a meat eater but was once vegetarian for years and this is good, good, good. For the red bell pepper sauce in this sammie, I use the blender and puree one Trader Joes' jar roasted red bell peppers (or 2 good- sized fresh ones roasted, steamed & peeled), 2 TBL capers, 1 small/medium clove garlic chopped a bit before going into the blender, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and 2 Tbl olive oil and 1/4 tsp salt. This makes a great sauce for sammies and grains. Do not remove the red pepper flakes - this added very small spiciness really makes this sauce. Also, another sub for the pepperoncini is a deli-type item sold in jars in brine or placed with the olives in salad bars called "pepidew" a vibrant orange nicely sweeet pepper - it goes very well on most sandwiches requiring something moist. I too use Arugula for the greens and Havarti but a nutty Swiss can work.Enjoy the game!

We had the sandwich for dinner and it was delicious. We ate the leftovers for lunch the next day and enjoyed it just as much.

Wow! This sandwich was DELICIOUS! Used pain rustique bread from Trader Joe's, which worked beautifully. Used Trader Joe's Red Pepper Spread too, which everyone thought was key to the tastiness of the sandwich! Didn't have peperoncini so used pickled banana peppers instead. Perfect! Can't wait to make again!

I made two of these for a pre-concert tailgate party, and they got raves. Leftovers made excellent lunch the next day. Nice blend of flavors, especially with arugula. I've subsequently made them on individual hoagie rolls, and they've turned out nicely that way as well.

I make one quite similar. Mix equal amounts of minced roasted red pepper and mayo for the spread. I used quartered marinated small artichokes in place of the pepperoncini. Meats were soppressata, capicola and Genoa salami. A handful of arugula added a nice contrast as well.

This recipe is fabulous. Please do not rate it if 1) You have not tried it 2) Are "part" vegetarian (?) and 3) Object to mayonnnaise; use something else. Crimony.

This recipe is delicious. I choose focaccia, havarti, salami, ham and prosciutto. Just watch your bread. I made less than the recipe yields and my bread was nice and toasty in just a few minutes. Would definitely make it for a party.

I am part vegetarian and seeing that there are more vegetable related things here than meat, I would say that I would like to make this over the weekend. I wonder if there could a healthier alternative to mayo, because we all know that mayo has a lot of fat in it.
