I just made this for a fall weekend away with friends, and it was delicious! Used Trader Joe's pizza dough, spread the ricotta on the bottom, followed by goat cheese and mozzarella. Added thinly sliced roast pesto chicken I had on hand, then topped with the parmesan and a chiffonade of fresh basil, and baked it on a pizza stone. Turned out great, will definitely make this again.

Was looking for something easy to throw together. This was really nice. Didn't have goat cheese. Didn't miss it. Added parboiled asparagus, kalamata olives & artichoke hearts. Grated Black pepper before putting in the oven. Lots of Garlic and LOTS of FRESH Basil. Really nice meal. Served with arugula and poached pear salad.

This was the perfect cheese pizza. I used a pre-made crust from my local co-op and used neufchatel cheese instead of ricotta. I LOVE garlic so use 2-3 cloves. Turned out amazing and has become a recipe staple in my house.

First time making a white cheese pizza. I used a pizza dough from a local pizza restaurant. Everyone gave it a great review, no left overs!

Grilled this pizza on the barbeque vs baking it in the oven and it turned out marvelous. I ravaged my basil plant the day before, so opted to use chopped fresh rosemary from the garden instead - still great. Making the garlic infused oil is a must! Will be making this for company this weekend with the addition of figs and a drizzle of reduced balsamic vinegar. Did I say yum??

I forgot to mention that, growing up in NJ, I was always fond of white pizza. I moved away and NEVER had a "white pie" as good as home. This recipe certainly competes as one of the best white pizzas I've made. The fact that I made it myself was icing on the cake. I agree with other reviewers that 1) the garlic oil makes it, and 2) Trader Joe's pizza dough works well.

I left out the goat cheese and this was still just flat amazing. Would certainly make again.

The garlic and oil makes the entire recipe for me! I added a few handfuls of chopped spinach (which I buzzed the the food processor with the basil). I would consider fresh mozz or even thinly sliced roma tomatoes for something different. Best white pizza I've had! Highly recommended.

Maybe a tad heavy on the ricotta, but excellent otherwise. I will definitely make it again (with spinach).

This is good, but I found the goat cheese to be slightly overpowering. Next time I will reduce the goat cheese to 1.5 oz and increase the mozzarella to 8 oz.

Very good. I just used Pilsbury Pizza Dough and no one was the wiser. Everyone really liked this, even those who would normally turn their nose up at Goat Cheese. I did use a 9x13" pan but would like to try a pizza stone next time. I prefer the crust to be more on the crispy side.

This was very yummy-- loved the garlic. We also used Trader Joe's dough and a pizza stone, and it came out crispy and great.

We liked this quite a bit. If you have any concern about pre-made dough, try the herb refrigerator dough from Trader Joe's...I can't imagine a homemade dough being any better. I would leave off the ricotta next time...it seemed kind of pasty to me. I'd also increase the amount of basil and maybe add some roasted garlic. I agree that Feta would be good when you want a change from the goat cheese. The nice thing about this recipe is that you can add pretty much any extra ingredients you like...my husband wants kalamata olives.

I make the Cook's Illustrated whole wheat pizza margerita on a regular basis, and it's always to rave reviews. People frequently say that it's the best pizza they've ever had. My family, however, said that this pizza was possibly even better. I made my own pizza dough from the aforementioned recipe. Try it--it's easy and so worth it! The garlic oil was fantastic and made a great dipping sauce. I would highly reccomend this recipe.

Very quick and easy for appetizer, have served this several times to different groups of people, and everyone has raved about it

Delicious and simple. Foodies, do not fear the ready made pizza dough. It's a great time saver and bakes to a nice cripy, bubbled outside while the inside stays incredibly chewy. It reminds me of pizza dough I was quite fond of in Florence.

I made this pizza as an appetizer for a party and my guests loved it. The recipe states to "crumble" the ricotta, however I wasn't sure how one would crumble wet ricotta from a container so I simply spread a thin layer before I added the other cheeses. I agree with another reviewer that spinach would be great on this pizza, I may try that next time.

I love this-so easy and everyone at our party loved it! I was scared of the refrigerator dough, but it turned out great! My tip is to only make it if people are eating it almost immediately, it tastes much worse after sitting for 30 minutes.

Great pizza recipe. Make my own dough though.

Delicious and easy. I was worried it might be too bland, but the goat cheese and garlic give it a wonderful flavor. I can't wait to make it again.

Yum! The goat cheese gave it a great tang. I wasn't too sure about using store-bought pizza dough, but we loved this and my husband couldn't stop raving. Definitely a keeper.

To BettyO from Atlanta: This recipe calls for "WET" Ricotta. All white pizzas use Wet Ricotta and that is what this is. This is also great using feta cheese instead of the goat cheese and adding thinly sliced garlic and spinach.

It was very easy and smelled delicious when cooking. My husband and I loved it.

Fabulous and easy, however, it seemed a bit weird not having a sauce.

We really enjoyed this. I actually like the "wet" ricotta, reminded me of pizza's we had in Europe. I made it another time with blue cheese instead of the goat cheese. Both were keepers.

This was WONDERFUL! Be sure to use ricotta salata rather than the "wet" kind. What a delightful, tasty meal.
