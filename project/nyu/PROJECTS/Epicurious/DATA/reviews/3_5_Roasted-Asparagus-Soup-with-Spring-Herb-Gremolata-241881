Its all about the Gremolata. Sprinkle the Gremolata so you get some in every bite. Then you get all the bright flavors up front and then finish with the soft flavor of roasted asparagus. A well composed recipie that needs all its parts.

Maybe the leeks browned too much. The vegetables all tasted good when I tried them out of the oven but when I put all the ingredients together the soup turned out bitter and blah. I tried to fix it but nothing made it taste very good...not even cheese.

Be careful not to overcook the soup. It turns from bright to bitter and mushy.

It turned out great! I also grilled some carrots and potatoes and used a sweet onion 'cause I didn't have a leek. And, I saved all the asparagus tops for a garnish. everybody loved it.

Very tasty and beautiful! Plan on running this though a food mill after you blend it for the best texture. The food mill eliminated all the fiberous pieces from the aspargus and the leek but still gave me a smooth soup with a a lot of body. The Gremolata was an excellent addition that even my more timid guests enjoyed!

I added the potatoes and lowered the temperature when roasting the vegetables as previously suggested. The texture of the soup is chunkier than I would like, and I found the garlic in the gremolata to overpower the asparagus. The soup gets points for not having any cream in it, but probably not enough for me to make this again.

I made this most delicious soup. Followed previous cooks who lowered the temp. to 350 and roasted for 40 mins. Used vidalia onions instead of leeks and added 2 potatoes to the roasting vegetables.We do not eat garlic in our house so I made a mix of the remaining ingredients and sprinkled it on the soup when serving. I offered this soup cold. It was refreshing and so wonderful.

I bought a whole bunch of asparagus at the farmers market and was looking for something to do with it - this soup is fantastic! Agree, the cooking time is too long/hot, but teh carmelized flavors really make this work. I added the leeks and asparagus directly to stock and pureed right in the pot. The gremelata was a great touch - no cream needed!

Great soup, however I agree that the oven time was too long, and therefore dropped the temp to 400 and left the veggies in for half an hour, turning them a few times. I also added two medium potatoes, cubed small, so they would cook at the same time as the other roasted veggies. This meant that the soup thickened nicely without adding any cream. I pureed everything right out of the oven, and added it to the stock, and it was ready in minutes; no need to cool the roasted veggies.

Superb! I made this for my 75-year old mother and she loved it. So did I. I echo the comments on lowering the oven temperature to 350, and add a few cloves of garlic to the roasting pan too. There was no fresh tarragon to be had so dill was substituted. The beauty of the dish was adding the gremolata at serving and letting the flavours blend in the warm of the soup.

Excellent. As suggested by others, I roasted the vegetables (and several extra garlic cloves) at a lower temp and added half-and-half to the near finished soup for extra richness.

just made this for mother's day and everyone liked it. i roasted onions and garlic along with the other vegetables (at a lower temp). great color and a surprisingly sweet flavor.

Almost didn't make this after reading the reviews, fearing it would be green mush with no taste. Not at all! This was a huge hit. Used finger-thick asparagus, and seasoned it and the leeks well before roasting. 425 is too high to roast the vegetables; the leeks started to burn a bit, which would have added bitterness to the soup. Next time, will reduce the heat to 350. (Incidentally, the vegetables were so delicious after roasting that we put them on toasted slices of French bread spread with garlic confit to make brilliant open-faced sandwiches/bruchetta. Yum. Would be a great app, or lunch alongside soup and salad.) Thinned the soup with plenty of veg broth and half and half. The gremolata was easy to do ahead: minced the garlic and washed and dried the herbs ahead. Then, zested a lemon into a mezzaluna and chopped everything together right before serving to avoid any browning of the tarragon. The gremolata was so worth it, and added different sparks of flavor to each bite. Had reserved the very tips of the asparagus, chopped fine, before roasting, and sauteed those in butter and added that as garnish as well. Bona fide crowd pleaser. In fact, the clean up crew devoured the leftovers the morning after the party and declared it an excellent hangover remedy!

I fixed this soup for Easter - not one guest ate it! It was much too thick and flavorless. I ended up tossing the whole batch down the drain.

I just made this as one of our starters for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe as is and thought that the low sodium broth kept it fresh and healthy. The gremolata was a hit with everyone and just added to the fresh flavors.

This is an excellent recipe. As one other reviewer mentioned, watch the asparagus so that it doesn't burn. My husband didn't care for the gremolata, but my guests did. Next time, I will try cilantro rather than the parsley in the gremolata. I do not think it is necessary to add cream to the soup.

Delicious! I added 2 cloves of roasted garlic to the puree for extra flavor. To gussy up the vegetable stock, I added the woody asparagus stems and green stocks of the leeks to my vegetable bouillon water.

I was looking for a recipe to help me use some asparagus broth that I had made from the "tough" ends of the stalks. This was SO GOOD I cannot ascribe it to using asparagus broth vs. any other. Others have added cream, but it's not necessary: the concentrated taste of the vegetables is all you need.

35 minutes in my oven burned my little asparagus to a crisp and I found it needed a little less intensity. I recommend adding a little cream. Otherwise pretty good.

Very easy. Impressed my guests. Everyone loved it. My husband didn't care for the gremolata, but he was the only one

In lieu of the gremolata, try adding soft goat cheese crumbles (NOT feta as it can be too salty)...I add it to a cream of asparagus soup I make with fat-free cream to decrease the fat content and everyone loves it

Asparagus in the oven as I write this. This is 2nd time to make it for others. All the positive suggestions by others will probably work well, treating this soup as a good basic taste. Gremalata really makes the soup delicious....rather bland without it. Wonderful way to start with basic soup; I'm going to try and freeze leftovers after serving it tonite. Try It; You'll Like It!

I haven't made this (yet) but love the asparagus soup with lemon creme fraiche recipe from this website. Does anyone know how the two compare (dinner party for the in-laws in May!)?

Rating: 3
I loved this! I didn't have time to assemble the gremolata, so served with a dollop of creme fraiche instead. Delicious! Also great with panini (I served grilled roasted chicken with caramelized onion sandwiches with this soup and they were wonderful together).

Rating: 2
While the flavoring to this soup was unique and accentuated well by the gremolata, I don't believe that the asparagus has the legs to stand out as a star for this dish. With a bit more citrus and served in a sparse amount, this "soup" could becomes a nice "sauce" to compliment a tasty fish.

i found myself not liking the consistency but loving the flavor

This was beautiful! I cannot believe anyone thought it bland. I agree with the reviewer who seasoned the veges before roasting - I also did this and this probably helped. I didn't end up making the gremolita and the soup was raved over anyway!

This was very easy to make, and, if you like asparagus, the flavor was wonderful. Also, the little bright bursts of flavors from the gremolita definitely topped this soup off.

Excellent recipe and wonderful for spring. Unlike the previous reviewer I did not find the recipe to be bland especially since I knew what needed to be tweaked. I roasted the asparagus and leek with a few cloves of minced garlic and red pepper flakes. I also used vegetable broth since I am a vegetarian. I had dried tarragon so I soaked it in a little olive oil and added it before the rest of the gremolata.

Very bland. Very boring. In the end I discovered I liked the asparagus texture. The soup took that way even when I made it lumpy.

Delicious! Wonderful fresh flavors and lovely bright color. Made ahead for a dinner party and worked great to reheat just before serving. It was thicker and chunkier than I was expecting it to be, but it was delicious that way. Tasted great made with vegetable broth (served to vegetarians) and the gremolata was a delighful, pretty garnish.
