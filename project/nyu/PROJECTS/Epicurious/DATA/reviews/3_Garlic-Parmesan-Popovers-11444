Could use more garlic. I could only "barely" detect that there was any at all. Other than that, good, easy recipe.

These did not fully cook inside; despite being very (too) crispy and brown on the outside, the inside was still somewhat doughy before they were on the verge of burning. Not sure what went wrong -- maybe an uneven oven temp or the quality of the pan? When they looked perfectly done, fluffy and high on the outside I had to leave them in longer because they weren't cooked all the way through. I turned down the temp a bit to cook them slower and moved the rack to the middle. That's a disappointment because it seems to make the perfect popover would be a big crowd pleaser.

Very good-- made them with roast chicken. Mine rose up pretty well, though I think the cheese makes them a little denser than plain popovers. Good flavor.

These popovers are wonderful and turn out perfectly every time. Everytime I serve them I get raves from my guests.

So delicious! I like to serve mine fresh out of the oven with a little goat cheese! A real crowd pleaser!

I made this recipe with half the amount of salt and parmesan cheese that it called for. I added chopped fresh rosemary. The popovers were beautiful! No one would ever guess they were so easy to make.

I did not have good luck with these. Some popped nicely,but they were burned on the bottoms and sides. 55 minutes is too long for baking.

Great! I used romano, and about 1/2 of what it calls for, and the popovers rose very nicely, but the garlic and romano flavor was still very tasty. Yum!

I made these popovers and added the romano and parmesan like a previous reviewer stated. They were excellent; tasty and moist! I will make them again.

These took only a few minutes to prepare - and with some "light" variations, they were incredibly good! I used olive oil spray to grease the popover pan, fat-free Scramblers 2-egg equivalent and about 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic. I used much less cheese, only sprinkling some shredded romano & parmesan on top of the batter. These were done to perfection in 40 minutes - very high, moist inside, and delicious! Served with a tossed salad for today's lunch. Yum!

Will keep making these - - they were easy, fast and delicous!!! Despite your warnings mine were high and fluffy. Tip - - Make sure you oven is hot, and No peaking.

I have made these a bunch of times, and they really don't get all fluffy like other popovers I've made. But I still keep making them because they still taste delicious!

Awesome popover with Italian main course. Two people who I served have asked for this recipe! One said, "I've used the epicurious recipes before. They are fantastic!!!!

Barf! Way too garlicky, not to mention there is no "popping over" because of the heavy parmesean. Don't make these!
