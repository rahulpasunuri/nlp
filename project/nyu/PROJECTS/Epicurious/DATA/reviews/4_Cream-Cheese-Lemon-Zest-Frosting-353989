Fantastic recipe!! Yes, it does make a lot of icing, but if you split two 8 inch layers into 4 layers, it's just the right amount!!! I used lime instead of lemon...awesome!

The quantity is perfect to frost a 8" two layer carrot cake. The recipe is great as is but after tasting it I decided to add a smidge more lemon juice and it ended up tasting almost exactly like a lemon cheesecake. It was delicious, but was also a little monotone/heavy. After it sat for a bit I decided to kick it up a notch and stirred in a piece of ginger (approx 1/2" square), peeled and put through a garlic press. That made all the difference and really brightened it up.

Excellent! I've made this with lemon and with tangerine, and have to say I prefer tangerine, but this gets rave reviews.

Fantastic frosting - everyone loved the lemon flavor. It makes A LOT of frosting - I cut the recipe in half and still had leftovers from a 2-tier carrot cake.

The flavor was outstanding but I found the icing too runny. Did anyone else have this problem?

Like everyone else - I love this stuff! It's delicious.

Oh, this frosting is just ridiculous. I have never liked cream cheese frosting, in fact it's always turned me off so much that I have only ever made carrot cake with a sugar glaze. However, for a party I decided to go with a crowd pleaser and try out a cream cheese frosting...and after trying this recipe, I'm afraid I can never go back! It's simple to make, an elegant presentation, and the big prize goes to whoever gets to lick the bowl. A few alterations I made: I needed to make this frosting dairy-free to accommodate a cow-milk allergy, so I used Earth Balance vegan butter and Tofutti "Better Than Cream Cheese." I was nervous about how that would turn out but these substitutions were virtually undetectable. Also, I made a 2-layer 9.5" round cake, and made 3/4 of this frosting recipe and ended up with some to spare. In retrospect I could have made the center layer of icing thicker and *still* had enough leftover to make some little carrot garnishes. A KEEPER!!!

This is the only cream cheese frosting I've ever made that hasn't gone goopy on me. Most others have you add up to 2 lbs of powdered sugar! It's a sugary, gritty mess! This one is as all the rest of the reviewers say - heavenly! I won't use any other recipe.

I used only 1 stick of butter and doubled the lemon zest & juice quantities. The flavor & texture is like key lime pie. Absolutely outstanding. Great for toast & bagel topping, too.

Im baccckkkk....I made carrot cake once before but too lazy to make the frosting....this time I did...and OH MY GOD....it is delicious! I'm in love with the whole recipe....and yes you could halve the recipe thats what I did and as the other reivewer said...I couldn't stop eating the icing out the bowl either so finally I threw it in the sink and put water in it to get it away from me...LOL

I made this to frost mini-carrot cake cup cakes for Thanksgiving. I added the seeds from half a vanilla bean and only made a third (enough for 24 mini cupcakes) but otherwise made as instructed - fabulous. This is a light fluffy super yummy frosting that makes the cake!

4 stars says it all! Wonderful frosting recipe, quick, easy, and great taste. Works just fine if you halve the recipe.

Made this frosting for the triple layer carrot cake found on this site. The frosting came out fantastic. Tangy with a hint of lemon (probably could use a little more zest than what the recipe calls for). The combination of the cheese and lemon juice made for an almost sour cream taste. Since other reviewers commented that this recipe yielded too much frosting, I used only 2 packages of cream cheese, 1 stick of butter and 1 cup of powdered sugar and it was just enough to frost a 2 layer 8-inch cake.

Perfect frosting, my husband doesn't like frosting, but the lemon and cream cheese makes this one creamy and refreshing. Perfect for carrot cake. I didn't have 3 packages in the frig so I used 2 and reduced the sugar to 2 cups and added a little more zest, it was perfect.

This frosting is EXCELLENT! I was worried it would taste like Lemon Pledge--it doesn't. The lemon flavor is there but not too strong. I had a little frosting left over after frosting a 2-layer cake, but not enough for another cake.I could not stop eating this out of the bowl!

This was good frosting. Very rich, tangy, and sweet. A good compliment to carrot cake. I would have liked it to be a bit easier to work with. Even after refrigeration for over 3 hours, it was still soft and didn't maintain it's shape well. This only matters if you wanted to decorate I suppose. Otherwise, great flavor and I'd use it again.

This icing tasted really good, but it yielded way more than 4 1/2 cups that th recipe says, I ended up with enough icing to easily ice two 8 inch layer cakes!
