Rating is a guess. I confess I haven't tried the soup yet. I definitely will with a few adjustments (stew beef and chicken parts, more thrifty). I love the chicken imagery. I like the maniac whirling of the bird best! Happy Holidays all.

I live with my Yemenite husband in a neighborhood which is 90% Yemenite. May people eat this soup not only before Yom Kippur, but for lunch every single day and for dinner every Friday night. The authentic recipe has many fewer ingredients. They rarely had beef in Yemen. But this looks like a yummy modernized version. But just like the soup I attempt every Friday, they'll tell you it's tasty but just not 'marak teimani.'

Though I havent tried this recipe yet, my Yemenite- born father claims this is not an authentic recipe, rather it has been modified a great deal. Many of the ingredients are not used in traditional Yemenite soup: 1) they don't mix red meat & chicken, they do one or the other. 2) They don't use turnips, leek, tomatoes, celery, zuchinni, or carrots. Hawaijj spice mix also includes cloves and cardamom.

Oh, please! No one swings chickens around by the legs (unless they're deranged). That is a cartoon visual. Actually, someone gently lifts a chicken and moves it in a circular motion over another person's head. I experienced this as a child, and insisted on wearing a raincoat and hat. The same religious rite can be performed with .18 in change. So all the outraged can relax!! And I am going to try this soup!

My husband's family is Tameni and I make this soup all of the time. The only problem with your recipe is that it is very heavy on the hawayej We use less than 1/3 of what the recipe states

Cruelty is cruelty and shlucking chickens is cruel no matter what your ethnicity. That said, this is a good recipe if you eat chicken which I do. I hope their end is quick though.

For those who can't find hawayij in stores or wonder what it is: HAWAYIJ (SPICE MIX) / 6 t Black peppercorns / 3 t Caraway seeds / 1 t Saffron threads / 1 t Cardamom seeds / 2 t Tumeric / Pound peppercorns, caraway seeds, saffron and cardamom seeds in a mortar, or grind in a blender. Stir in tumeric and store spice mix in a sealed jar. Use according to recipes. Source: The Complete Middle East Cookbook by Tess Mallos

I made this with my 5 year old and he (and the rest of us) loved it. My husband thought it was a wonderful change of pace for chicken soup and I enjoyed making something different:)

This recipe looks wonderful and the reviews are hilarious, so serious, some quite unjoyous. Let's celebrate and try this soup - L'Chaim!

To be honest, I haven't made this... yet. After spending three years in Israel, I was exposed to Jewish food from all over the world. Yemenite food is among my favorite, particularly because of the use of hawayij. I don't think anyone should shun a recipe just because the culture that lies behind it is different than our own. We could really miss out on some delicious eats that way. And, by the way, the ritual of "shlucking" a chicken (twirling it over one's head) is still performed to this day... As for giving food to bachelors, I've never encountered one that has turned down free food, let alone during the holiday season. So, next time we read about where our food comes from, let's not be so judgemental. After all, if we eliminated all foods whose cultures were "insensitive and unenlightened", we would have a very unexciting diet.

Golly, I never realized how insensitive and unenlightened this recipe and tradition are. Tell me more, NYC. It's really relevant here. Plus, we care. A good, satisfying, easy-to-adjust, and politically incorrect recipe. Dare we?

The concept of swinging fowl about one's head, and then slaughtering the unfortunate animal is really odd to say the least. I thought that kosher rituals required humane and hygenic methods for animal slaughter. And giving the leftovers to bachelors? How sad and arcane to think that the unmarried deserve our sympathy.

THIS IS A WONDERFUL RECIPE NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S DELICIOUS BUT BECAUSE IT REMINDS US OF THE IMPORTANCE OF TRADITION AND CULTURE. I FOR ONE WILL NOT BE SWINGING ANY LIVE CHICKENS OVER MY HEAD WHEN I PREPARE THIS WONDERFUL SOUP BUT I WILL BE REMINDED OF THE FACT THAT AT ONE TIME PEOPLE DID. I THINK MORE PEOPLE NEED TO BE REMINDED OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS MORE TO FOOD THAN JUST CALLING FOR PIZZA

I LIKE THIS ONE BECAUSE IT HAD INGREEDIENCE THAT I LIKE.
