The chocolate glaze was amazing, and I served it over ice cream during the following week. But I found the cake a little bitter and overall the amount of work was not justified by the end result.

I followed the recipe to the letter, and I was pleased with results. It was surprisingly moist and flavorful. If you are crunched for time, be sure to make the glaze just after or while the cake is cooking so that cooling times overlap. Also, my glaze never really set while cooling (I assumed at room temp, since it didn't ay chill). This made the crumb coat especially easy and the re-warming very brief.

i haven't made this yet and am wondering if anyone knows if it's possible to make the cake layers in advance and freeze them.

This came out really well and wasn't too much work. I made it for Rosh Hashanah and it is really a Pesach cake, but everyone loved it. It was very moist and the orange chocolate combo worked well. There was more glaze than necessary but I am going to use it on ice cream for my book club.

Oh my - this was awesome and everyone at my seder loved it! I made it exactly as the recipe says; the only slight variation I made was I used 1/2 bittersweet and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate for the glaze (instead of one or the other) - and the taste was just great. I ended up with a tremendous amount of glaze I didn't use, so if I make it again - I'd half the glaze recipe. Overall - a fantastic cake which I would make all year round.

I've make this cake almost every year since it first appeared (that's 10 years now!). Everyone I make it for loves it. Despite what looks like an overload of chocolate in the glaze, in fact it's just right, and the amount is perfect--enough for a good amount of filling, a good crumb coat, and still have plenty for the overall glaze. I can't have the matzoh meal because I can't have any gluten, so I substitute quinoa flour, which is also kosher for pesach. At other times of the year I'd use a mix of quinoa or sorghum flour, sweet rice flour, white rice flour, and tapioca starch, along with potato starch called for.

I have made this cake every year since 1995. It is a family favorite and big hit with all who join us for seder. If you use a good bittersweet chocolate and follow the recipe it comes out beautifully.

The cake itself was good. I didn't have potato starch or matzo cake meal (matzo meal?) so used cake flour & unbleached. The frosting recipe seemed outrageous so I cut it down in half, but used unsweetened chocolate, lots of sugar & more honey. It was very bittersweet but edible. Even half of the frosting was enough for this cake. Oh, I also only had a 9 1/2" springform & baked it one hour instead. Not a bad cake but don't know if I'd make it again, especially not their frosting.

I am looking forward to making this! It sounds fantasic.

instead of matz cake meal(not available)in this part of the world}, I used ordinary white refined cake flour.
