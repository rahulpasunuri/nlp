A great recipe that makes a wonderfully flavorful curry. Expect to spend about 2 hours in the kitchen assembling, dicing, combining, but this will last you for several meals and is fun to make. My first batch lasted 4 months - I froze it and it keeps well in the freezer. One word of warning - make SURE you have rubber gloves to cut the peppers and remove the seeds. You can get capsicum oil burns...as I found out on my first try.

This is similar to my curry pastes. I make up batches of green and red and then freeze them in ice cube trays. When I want a good paste, to stir fry rice noodles, whatever ... I just pop a curry paste cube or two out of the freezer, fry it, add whatever else I want. Freezes well.

This is THE way to make red curry paste, i've been cooking Thai for a few years and came across this recipe. This is almost exactly the way i've made mine, and believe me, THIS IS THE BOMB!!!! Make sure your guests are ready for a mouthful of flavor and have plenty of ice water at hand.

This is a fantastically aromatic, not to mention authentic base for any Thai red curry. Used to make a traditional curry of beef, Thai eggplant, bamboo shoots, and red pepper, it was unbelievably tasty. It's obviously a little tricky to gather all of the ingredients and spend the time to pound everything together in a mortar, but the resulting paste does keep in the refrigerator for at least a week and this recipe produces enough for at least 2 curries (serving 4-6 people each).
