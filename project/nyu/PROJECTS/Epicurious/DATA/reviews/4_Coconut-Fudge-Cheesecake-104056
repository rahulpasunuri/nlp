Very good cheesecake, will make it again for coconut loving friends. I made a ganache with 1/4 cup cream and 3 oz. semi-sweet chocolate, which was just enough to spread over the top and it remained soft when cutting. Next time I'll cut back a bit on the sugar. Overall it's a keeper.

this was the first cheesecake i've ever made, for my mom's 75th birthday. like several other reviewers, i used coconut cream rather than the coco lopez cream of coconut and it worked out ok. i believe it was a 15 oz. can. i also used a hot water bath while baking the cake, and kept the oven door shut (with the oven off) for an hour after it was done baking. i then cracked the door open slightly (holding it open with a wooden spoon handle) and let the cake sit in the oven for another full hour. it came out incredibly creamy and not cracked at all. my one complaint: despite letting the cake come to room temp before serving it, the chocolate topping was still rock hard and very difficult to slice! next time i will either make half of the chocolate topping or find a recipe for more of a soft glaze topping. otherwise, delicious! my mom immediately requested i make it again next year.

My friends wanted a cheesecake that tasted like a Mounds candy bar-this recipe seemed to fit that. Although it was very tasty, next time I would cut back on the sugar and the light corn syrup.

It was tasty and rich. Everything a cheesecake should be. It might be good without the chocolate covering, too.

I made this for a relative who loves cheesecake and he claimed it was one of his favorites. Texture turned out very nice--a water bath definitely helps. The only thing that did not turn out was the chocolate on top. I may have refrigerated it too long and/ or not let it sit at room temperature long enough. Either way, the chocolate was still hard when I served it, so it was difficult to cut through and almost had the consistency of a chocolate bar. Overall it was a delicious dessert and worth making.

Very good cheesecake, but the chocolate topping is overkill. 2 of the 4 cream cheese were light and you'd never know the difference. It was hard to know when to take the cake out of the oven, because it was still jiggly after an hour and 20 minutes. But it set perfectly in the fridge. Next time I'll omit the chocolate topping and make a mango or raspberry coulis instead

A very rich, delicious cheesecake, but a bit too sweet for my taste. If I were to make it again, I would use bittersweet rather than semi-sweet chocolate for the topping. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and baked the cake in a water bath.

I was not too crazy about this cheescake. The flavor of cream cheese and almond extract did not mix well for me.

This is the best cheesecake ever! I don't like almonds however, so I substituted the almond extract for vanilla and left them out of the crust as well. Still this is an unbelievable cheesecake! I always cook it in a water bath and it comes out perfect every time. Someone even paid me to make them one for their dinner party...A sure hit! Thank you!

A great recipe. A huge hit at a recent dinner party

This was a very rich cheesecake - quite professional looking with the chocolate topping, toasted coconut and almonds on top. I made this for a dinner group gourmet evening and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I'm not sure it was my very favourite considering all the extra ingredients and steps but it was good - especially if you like coconut. Be sure to wrap the outside of your pan with foil since there was a lot of oil that leaked out - probably from the coconut cream. It would have been a real mess in the oven if my pan was not wrapped!

This was a really good cheesecake, the favorite at the Thanksgiving dinner table. It took shorter to bake then the recipe said, but that might have just been my oven. Beautiful presentation--I would make this again.

I made this for a get-together I was having. They loved it. I did make some changes. A shortbread crust and added 2 more pks of cream cheese, 1 egg. (10 in. pan) I will use coconut extract next time though. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe was excellent. The flavor combination is perfect. I used vanilla extract instead because I find almond extract too over powering. I also used coconut cream and it worked well. My cheesecake fell a bit and was quite cracked, but I covered it up with the chocolate topping. I think I'll try a water bath next time. Overall though it looked okay and tatsted great.

Just can't agree with the 4 forks that everybody else seems to think this cake deserves. It was "okay". I thought it a bit on the sticky side and felt that the chocolate overwhelmed the subtler flavors of cake and crust. It certainly LOOKED gorgeous though-- I'll give it that. And it may just be me being overly critical, as my co-workers adored it.

This cheesecake was delicious,and makes a beautiful presentation as well. I will definately be making it again. Even people that weren't die-hard coconut lovers enjoyed it.I do agree with other reviewers about the almond extract being a little overpowering. Next time I'll try it with the coconut extract. Can't wait.

This truly is so delicious. I make just half of the chocolate topping and drizzle it on top, it looks beautiful this way with the nuts and coconut aswell.

This cheesecake was fantastic! I made it for New Year's Eve and everyone loved it. I substituted vanilla extract for the almond, since I didn't think almond would be great with coconut, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. There didn't seem to be enough crust though - I had to make it so thin and had a tough time pressing it into the pan so there weren't holes in it. Did anyone else have trouble with the crust slipping down while pre-baking? Even with the crust issues it still turned out to be delicious and I will make it again soon!

Love Chocolate and coconut together, but thought this was just ok. I have a much better chocolate/coconut cheesecake recipe that I'll continue to make.

This got rave reviews in my office and I even cheated and used a bottled fudge sauce for the top (the real stuff is much better, but I ran out of time). Used coconut cream (liquor stores are closed on Sundays here so I couldn't get the Coco Lopez) and no almond extract and it was still fabulous. Gave me a couple of tense moments when I thought the whole thing was going to cook over the top - I think a ten inch springform would work better, but it did settle back down in the end and disaster was averted.

This is a great recipe! Just go easy on the almond extract, a TINY bit goes a VERY long way, and using even a touch too much can overpower the other flavors.

Well, I'll be... I have made this cheesecake five times now, and I just realized that I've been misreading the recipe. I've been using coconut cream instead of cream of coconut. Well, I'll just say this: Coconut cream works, because I receive nothing but raves every time I make this! The last four times that I have made this cheesecake, I have substituted a teaspoon of coconut extract for the almond extract for a smoother coconut flavor, and it is excellent. Everyone who has tasted it agrees that this recipe is absolutely decadent. I never can force myself to use any other cheesecake recipe, because this is, by far, the best I've ever had. In addition to its great taste, it is also beautiful in presentation. You can't go wrong with this one, folks!

This dessert is amazing! I made it this weekend, and it was a huge hit. I am looking for reasons to make it again. I would suggest putting a cookie sheet under the cheesecake during baking to catch any leaks. Also, I toasted extra coconut for the topping. I thought the 1/4 c. was too little.

My guests said this was the best cheesecake they had ever eaten! I used unsweetened coconut, substituted vanilla extract for the almond, and used Scharfenberger semi-sweet chocolate for the topping - the good chocolate made all the difference.

This cheesecake is so d'lish. The only part that didn't work out for me was the chocolate topping, so what I did was just took some Hershey's syrup and drizzled it all over the top over the almonds and coconut and it looked beautiful and tasted wonderful. I'm going to bake another one this week and plan on drizzling caramel instead of chocolate. Yum!

Absolutely fabulous! Be sure to cover the bottom of the pan with one unbroken sheet of foil or it will leak in oven. I didn't even put chocolate on top as it was terrific without it!

This was a great cheesecake! I needed to use a 10 inch springform pan, so based on previous reviews, I made one and a half times the crust ingredients. Those were the only changes I made. I brought it to a brunch for 50 people and everyone raved!!!

I love anything with coconut and this did not disappoint. It was the right texture and consistency. It turned out the way I expected it too. I had some good quality chocolate sauce in the fridge I didn't know what to do with and so I used that as a topping which saved some time. Loved it will make it again.

This was one of the best desserts I've ever made as well as eaten. I wanted to make something special for my mom on her birthday. She raved over it. Needless to say, it was gone in two days. It's very rich with the fudge topping, so you don't need much before you're full.

I made this cheesecake for my sisters birthday party, and while everyone loved the cheesecake part, they could hardly cut through the fudge sauce on top. Once it sets, it is very hard. I took off the fudge part on the leftover cheesecake and put some fudge ice cream topping on it and it was totally wonderful. I would suggest substituting fudge topping and it will be perfect. I also used Orea cookie crumbs in the crust and that was wonderful, too.

This is an outstanding cheesecake that always brings multiple "oohs" and "aahs" when I take it to any function. The toasted almonds make the crust absolutely fabulous! The chocolate topping is rich, but not hard to make at all. I garnish over the chocolate topping with additional toasted coconut and almonds. Absolutely extraordinary!!

I brought this cheesecake to a party with four other people and came home with no leftovers. I followed the advice of another reviewer to substitute shortbread cookies for graham crackers and was pleased with the result. Also I "cheated" and used a jar of Dove dark chocolate ice cream topping instead of making from scratch. It was great! I will make this again.

I've served this two times and both times to rave reviews. It's a real keeper! The presentation is outstanding. I did use a small 4 oz can of CocoLopez, but wondered if I should have used the larger one. Does anyone know what size can was actually called for?

Okay, this cheesecake is fabulous. I've made it at least 6 times in the past year. People constantly ask for it. I now use shortbread cookies replacing the graham cracker crumbs. Also, try adding 1/3 cup of dark rum and another tbl of flour.

This recipe was a big hit at my book club meeting. I didn't change a thing, and it turned out perfectly! I've made many a cheesecake, and this is perhaps my favourite ever. Although the ingredient list is fairly long, I found the cake easy to make and well worth the effort. I particularly liked the almonds and coconut in the graham crust. It went well with the fruit salad one of the other club members brought along. YUMMY!

This cheesecake got rave reviews last night at my dinner party. Everyone loved the crust, the cheesecake was extremely moist and creamy and just the right amount of coconut, and the fudge layer on top was fabulous. Overall, the flavor was perfect -- even those who aren't big coconut fans thought it was excellent. I used the almond extract since I was a little concerned it might be too coconut-y for some, so can't comment on those reviews. But I will say that the crust recipe was just fine for my 9 inch springform pan. Maybe the people needing to double it are using a larger pan.

It was a delicious cake. However I baked it in a 10 1/2" springform pan because there is a lot of cake for the smaller size pan which is recommended in the recipe. The chocolate fudge layer is fabulous and I will use it on other cheesecake recipe I make.
