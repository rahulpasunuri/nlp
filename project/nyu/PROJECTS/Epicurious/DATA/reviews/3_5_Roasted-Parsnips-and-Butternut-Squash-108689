LOVED this! I made it as described, but will follow reviewers' advice about tossing the garlic with the veggies, next time. Also, I will used more garlic, minced and won't bother to core the parsnips. I tried out my theory on one of the parsnips and couldn't tell it form those I cored.

LOVE This recipe. It is a staple for the fall! However, I put the garlic right in with the parsnips and squash

I will have to try this recipe with the olives one time... but even without them, what could be bad about roasted winter veg? These come out sweet and carmelized and were a hit with my family.

Good substitute for roasted potatos.

We don't like olives, so I took a previous reviewer's advice and substituted mushrooms and red onion. I found putting the baking dish on the top rack under the heating element roasted everything perfectly. Also, I put the mushrooms in half-way thru the cooking time. I loved the mild garlic flavour (but would increase the # of cloves to 2 or 3).

Like other reviewers, was skeptical about the olives but I added them, figuring that they could always be nudged aside if they didn't work. It turns out that their salty tang was surprisingly just right. Everything took longer to cook and to carmelize than the 25 minutes indicated but that may have been a quirk of our oven. I liked the subtle garlic flavor here and don't think I would tamper with the original recipe.

I was pretty excited about making this recipe because I had never cooked with parsnips. Nonetheless, this recipe proved to be very bland even with the olives. In fact, the olives should have been kept on the side and eaten separately. It would also make more sense to replace the parsnips with actual carrots. The carrots would have given the dish a little more flavor. In sum, I wasn't crazy about this dish and I won't make it again.

I thought this recipe was very good. At first I thought the olives were an odd ingredient for this dish, but it ended up complimenting the flavors REALLY well (they were like a little treat everytime you got a piece of one). Next time I make it, I will add more olives and a bit more garlic also (I always like a lot of garlic).

What a delightful dish! I made it as an accompaniment to grilled swordfish, and the meal was a hit! However, I made a few adjustments to the original recipe. I chose to omit the additional 1-1/2 tablespoons of oil (glad it did so) and added 3 garlic cloves, cut lengthwise into quarters, to the vegetables halfway through roasting time. The olives and the parsley didn't seem quite appropriate to this dish, so I crumbled several crisp cooked slices of bacon over the finished dish, which made it just wonderful! Definitely a keeper!

Disappointing! Made a double batch to serve 6 adults and 4 kids but had more than half left over. Pretty boring, a little too oily overall.

What a wonderful fall/winter vegetable dish. Very easy to make and just delicious. The parsnip is a nice complement to the swwt squash. Comments: I am not really sure the olives were necessary and could easily be skipped. Although I did it, I would not bother to saute the garlic separately in its own oil. I would add it directly to the roasting vegetables - perhaps a few minutes before the end if burning is a consideration. This is a definite keeper.

Being a working cook who does things outside the lines, I made this into a delicious soup by just peeling the squash after cooking the recipe (minus the parsley), then adding a cup each of cream and vegetable broth, then pureeing till smooth. Add the parsley as a garnish. Just a thought for the adventurous.

Another excellent dish. I omitted the olives. Instead I used roasted onions and mushrooms. Everyone loved it. Alot of people had never tried this before and loved it.
