These were very nice indeed. They are a little soft and delicate but manageable.

A "quick frying"", huh? I just spent about two hours frying all those little pancakes up. What a mess. They don't taste bad, but since I don't have any caviar or sour cream (just tapenade), I can't really recommend making this or not. I do suggest, however, that if you have any kind of life at all you will not want to.

I have to say, I was INCREDIBLY skeptical about this recipe. I only tried it because I had all the ingredients on hand and was throwing a dinner party. Having said that, these were DELICIOUS! Everyone raved over them, and I am completely in love. I will make these again, and again, and again. The only change I made was to add more flour (after reading reviews about them not holding together well). I used about 1/3-3/4 cup whole wheat flour, and it wasn't noticeable taste or texture-wise, but they did fry up incredibly well.

Absolutely delicious! A few tips from my experience might come in handy... I overcooked the potatoes slightly so added another egg and another spoonful of flour to thicken the mixture. Otherwise it was too watery and didn't hold together. Because it was a little soupy, I dropped it by teaspoonfuls into a very hot skillet and let it brown first before flattening it out and turning it. All to keep them from falling apart and small enough to eat in one bite. Also found they hold together much better if they're very browned rather than only slightly. Should look as dark as the picture. They're very light and super flavorful, and have a very impressive look. I'll definitely make them again, this recipe is a keeper!

We make this recipe every year for Hanukkah. One important tip: flatten these latkes on the baking sheet with your hand before putting in oil. Otherwise, your spatula will make them break apart when flattening.

Served this for my annual Christmas party. It got raves from all my hard to please friends. I did a run through on the pancakes. First time around they were difficult. The key is to make the pancakes as small as possible. They should be small enough to eat in one bite.

This dish was an excellent starter. Only two things I would change: I would have cooked the pancakes much further in advance. The recipe reads like it needs to be done right before serving, but I reckon it could be done several hours before. I would also increase the flour as the pancakes were too moist and some fell apart in cooking. Also, I needed more oil than the 3 tbsp called for.

I thought these pancakes were great and so did the people in my cooking club! I used Creme Faiche instead of sour cream.

Wonderful, easy, so tasty. Made this as a side to Brisket with Portobello Mushrooms and Dried Cranberries. Fed a house full of friends that were in food heaven!

I add a couple teaspoons brown sugar. It is very pretty and festive. Everyone seems to like it and keep asking me to make it again.

Wonderful -- I made these as a passed appetizer at Thanksgiving & my guests raved. I used black caviar on most and olive tapenade on the rest for my vegetarian guests -- that worked really well too.

Fabulous appetizer! Served it with black caviar as well as salmon roe. Had great reviews--even from my 11-year old brother. Take heed though--do not overcook the sweet potatoes, otherwise, your pancakes will be mushy.

Thanks to the freezing info from the reviewer from Glastonbury below, these were a big hit at my cocktail party. I followed the recipe exactly and used a teeny melon ball sized ice cream scoop to quickly make the balls and put on a plastic cutting board. I transfered the balls to the skillet using a heat resistant rubber spatula. I dipped the spatula in the oil and then gently pressed to flatten and then sort of whapped them back into the skillet if they stuck...it worked really well. Will have on hand for the holidays especially because you can store in ziplock and just use as many as you want. Looks very impressive and yummy too.

I found after the preparation that the potato mixture needed to be the same consistency as that when one is preparing potato pancakes. This recipe creates too soft a texture for frying. The next time I do this dish (and I will) I shall cut potatoes and grate in a processor while they are still raw. I believe this will give us the right texture. The flavor is wonderful. And visually, it's just beautiful to look at.

Absolutely Fabulous. Tasted exquisite! Yes, it wasn't easy to fry them, however it was worth! Everyone raved about them.

I thought these were some of the best appetizers I have ever had. I made them ahead of time and they worked out perfectly.

I am a Director of Catering and Sales at a Convention Center and we used this for an event. We "tweeked" it a little but have received "rave" reviews from all of out clients that had them. I do recommend that you Freeze them as well. They were absolutely delicious.

I just made these as an appetizer for a dinner party. I would not recommend them. WHile they tasted very good, the "dough" if you can call it that was just too hard to work with. I had the same problem as the person below--the batter stuck to the spatula and it was just not worth the effort. It was very difficult to get a nice round shape so the pancakes did not look pretty and it was tough to cook them to the right consistency. I wouldn't do it again.

I made this for a party and it got rave reviews. I thought it would take no time to fry up the pancakes, but I found it difficult. The pancakes were too moist and kept sticking to my spatula. Perhaps I missed something, but even with lots of preparation, it still took over an hour to get it all together.

Simple and tastey. Also really good with applesauce!

Delicious! I had to make ahead and freeze the pancakes for three days... they were great. Just reheated frozen at 350 for about 8 minutes, then added the sour cream and caviar. They tasted like I just made them!
