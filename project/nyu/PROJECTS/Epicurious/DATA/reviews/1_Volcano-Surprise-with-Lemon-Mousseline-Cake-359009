This dessert was disappointing. I wanted a dessert that I could "set on fire", but it really didn't turn out. The cake itself had a nice taste to it, but it says to cut it into four layers, and I don't know how that would be possible. I could barely cut it in two. The meringue on top was strange. I don't know why the yolk of the egg would be in it. I wasn't able to mound it on top of the cake in a cone shape at all....it was too heavy. I called it a "low hill" on the cake. The exterior cooked in 1/2 the time the recipe said, but the interior of the meringue was gooey. I wasn't able to set the liquor on fire from within the lemon. Instead, I poured the liquor on the meringue and set it on fire. The whole show was very disappointing.
