DEFINITELY use frozen pearl onions, rather than blanching and peeling a pound of them. There's no loss of quality, but the work time is cut by at least 50%. Also, I've found that the potato sub-recipe results in burnt garlic well before it gives me fully-cooked potatoes, so either add the garlic when the potatoes have already cooked for a few minutes, or (my preference) just make garlic-roasted potatoes. Otherwise, we've very much enjoyed this recipe several times.

I was very disappointed in the recipe. I normally love the recipes that have high ratings, but this recipe was certainly the exception. The dish was just too sweet!!!

I made this for my Iranian husband and his Iranian friend for the friend's birthday dinner and it was a HUGE hit. The sauce is one of the best I've ever had. I used small onions from a jar and they still loved it (there were no fresh pearl onions at the store), but next time I'll try fresh onions. I also cooked it longer (3 hours) but would probably only do 2-1/2 next time. I would heartily recommend this dish.

Had a version of this dish (with wild boar instead of lamb) in Delphi, Greece. I got the recipe from The Gourmet Cookbook, and the key fact for me was that the Stifado came from the onions used in the dish. I'd bought the lamb (Virginia free-range) at the local farmer's market, so I substituted leeks from the market for the onions. Like the previous reviewer, I just cleaned the leeks and then added them to the pot when the dish was done (and left everything in the oven at 150 degrees). The leeks were meltingly delicious. We gave it an extra kick with spicy Greek olives from the local Greek store in Virginia. To be honest, it was better than the wild boar in Delphi--although nothing could beat the Delphi view.

This was delicious but the directions were way more complicated than it needed to be. Firstly, I followed the recipe as instructed but I added the onions to the sauce as it was baking.. I felt that the baking time was too quick for the meat to be so tender so cooked it covered for 3 hours. I removed the lamb and blended the sauce to make a rich, gorgeous sauce. The kids never need to know that there are onions and the flavours are tremendous. The biggest problem I had was with the potatoes. When the lamb has cooked for about 2 hours and 45 minutes, boil the cut up potatoes for 10 - 15 minutes. Drain and toss the potatoes with the olive oil, salt peppper and garlic. Place in a large 9" x 12" pan and bake in the same oven as the meat. After an hour, they will be beautifully golden brown and almost crunchy. No need to dirty another pan and making a greasy mess on the stove. As for "steaming the onions" don't bother as you can add them to the lamb at the beginning and they add all their flavour. It might not be the traditional Greek way, but it is so much easier and much more palatable.

For years, I have been cooking a braised beef or pork dish called ESTOFADO in the Philippines with similar ingredients in the braising liquid except for: no rosemary nor cinnamon, uses whole black peppercorns and bay leaf instead; soy sauce and water instead of red wine(rest of braising liquid ingredients are the same); cubed carrots are added; fried sliced Saba which are similar but better than plantains are added along with the fried/sauteed potatoes. So this recipe has a familiar flavors, and taste as delightful.

Excellent, I cooked this the day before and it was very good. I shall try it again with beef next time and have already passed it onto two others.

Lovely - my whole family rated this one (which is unusual in itself!). I was worried about the sugar, but it was very subtle. Will definitely try this one again, but next time I will cook for longer at a lower heat (I like my lamb to fall off the bone at the merest sight of a fork!), and I may try making it a day in advance.

Delicious! My fiance and I made this with cubed beef and it ws wonderful. Added some cracked garlic cloves, as well as oregano, basil and allspice and it was wonderful!

I followed the advice from the cook from Chicago and added some marjoram, basil and allspice. I also used balsamico vinegar and lamb stew meat without bone. The next time I'll use beef which I prefer.

My husband, who ordinarily doesn't like the smell of lamb, came into the kitchen while this was in the oven and said, "What is it that smells so good?" It was just delicious! --a combination of ingredients that would not have occurred to me. I did not want to run to the store after I had read the recipe, so instead of little pearl onions I just diced & sauteed a regular onion and added it at the end. My Greek grandmother might have objected, but we did not.

This is a great start, but if you want an authentic Greek taste more ingredients are necessary. 2 teas. each of oregano, marjoram, and basil, 1/4 teas. each of allspice and nutmeg. Use approx 5 minced garlic cloves, but toss them in the pot along with the quartered potatoes.

Yum. The flavors melding in this dish were incomparable. Because I bought marjoram by mistake I substituted this for the rosemary and it was still very Greek. I did, however, make this in the pressure cooker, which cut the cooking time in half, but melded the flavors beautifully and left me with lots of gravy.

WORKED NICELY WITH LAMB STEW MEAT. BENEFIT IS A MUCH SHORTER COOKING TIME. CINNAMON INFUSION ADDED A NEW FLAVOR DIMENSION TO THE TOMATOES.

A wonderful combination of flavors combine to make this a showcase dish. It's become the family's favorite lamb recipe.
