I also used boneless, skinless chix breast and added a little more garlic and some red pepper flakes. Delish, but messy.

man, oh man! this is another winner! like the reviews just under, i too used boneless, skinless chicken breast and it turned out perfectly. didn't have parchment paper, so used a slightly greased piece of foil. also subbed the marjoram for dried oregano because that's what i had on hand. this is a MUST MAKE DISH if you're constantly in a hurry and looking for something quick, delish and healthy!

This was easy and the chicken was so moist and flavorful. I used boneless, skinless breasts, so I cooked them 8 minutes on the first side, and 7 on the second side. I used fresh basil instead of marjoram, because it's what I had on hand, but I'd try it next time with marjoram. I also didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I used canned, which were fine (but of course fresh would be better!). This is a keeper, and could definitely be made with other vegetables - zucchini, of course, but also bell pepper, or fresh corn kernels, or whatever you have on hand.

The only modifications I made were skinless breasts, and adding a little red-wine to the sauce. Found it very tasty -- like a cacciatore.

This recipe was a winner! So much so, that the guests I served it to asked for the recipe and were still talking about it the next day. It was so quick and tasty it's likely to become a regular at my house.

I almost bought skinless boneless chicken, but I do love crispy chicken skin and the bone does keep it juicier...however, I almost wish I had gone with original instinct. The bone-in chicken breasts I found at Whole Foods were rather large and did exactly what I was afraid they would do: they didnt flatten or press very well which made them basically a bunch of nicely browned plain old chicken breasts. Granted, I could have looked harder for smaller ones, and I did triple the recipe and kept the first batches in the oven on low to keep them warm which dried them out a bit.

Loved the pressed process! Worked perfectly. I used my cast iron skillet with a bunch of tiles for the weight. I didn't cut the parchment into a circle so it hung out over the pan and caught most of the grease. Not messy at all. My husband doesn't like white meat because when he grills it he says it is too dry. He continued to coo over how moist this was.

EASY and DELISH. I just put a mesh splatter guard between the two pans and that stopped the mess. I stripped some leaves off fresh marjoram and dumped them in. Cooked in an iron skillet, always like the flavor it adds. Not much chopping, don't know what those complaints were about.

This was a good warm weather recipe. Nice crisping on the outside and juicy on the inside. I did not have a problem with the mess, but I would have loved a prep cook with all of the cutting! It's worth another go!

My neighbor gave me a yellow squash and some tomatoes from her garden, so I searched for a way to prepare them. This recipe resulted in quite a delicious and healthy meal! I enjoyed it very much, and will make it again. I didn't have fresh marjoram, so used 1.5 tsp of herbes de provence.

The chicken turned out very juicy and looked quite pretty. I might just do this every time I cook chicken in a skillet. And it was fully cooked in the amount of time listed in the recipe. I didn't think it made that much of a mess and I didn't use parchment paper...but maybe I'm just accustomed to being messy. I didn't have any veggies on hand, but I'm sure they would have been great.

This turned out perfectly! I added eggplant as well as rosemary and I am sure you could pretty much make the vegetable part with ANY summer veggies. The chicken got a nice crust and cooked through in the amount of time noted on the recipe (which surprised me...). I think I will try to make it with chicken thighs next time.

I have enjoyed this recipe so much that it has been passed on to a couple of good friends. The grease splatter can be minimized by parchment that is a little wider than the bottom skillet. I also use my trusty cast iron skillet as a weight, in addition to two big cans. When you are overwhelmed with all the squash and tomatoes being produced in your garden in the summer, this is a perfect dish.

Easy and tasty! Used boneless chicken breasts since I had them on hand. Thew some lemon on them, and also added a few extra herbs. Thinking about tossing in a little Parmesan cheese to the sauce next time. And there will be a next time!

I used dried thyme (just a tiny bit) instead of the majoram and it was great! Even better the next day.

This was pretty good, but sooo not worth the enormous mess it made. I can't remember the last time I had this much grease splattered all over my stove (and beyond!).

Very good flavor. I only had skinless chicken breasts, so I should have cooked them a lot less long. I used a lot more marjoram and the flavor was excellen.

Used dried marjoram, good and easy chicken recipe.

Made this for dinner last night and my boyfriend and I were both super happy with the outcome! We used all farm fresh veggies from our CSA and added a little dried herbs de provance because we were low on fresh herbs, but it was wonderful.

I didn't have marjoram so I used rosemary and thyme. I was surprised the chicken was done in so short a time. The vegetables were delicious. I served it all over quinoa. My only hesitate in making it again is that there was lots of oil splattering, a very mess process.

A stepped-up, easy chicken dish--can't get enough of those recipes. I made a pan sauce from the chicken juices with white wine, and then sauteed spinach, shallots, and morel mushrooms in it. Fabulous instant side dish.

It was moist, easy and delicious. I used quartered cherry tomatoes

This chicken is incredibly moist. I had to keep checking it while i was eating it to make sure it was fully cooked. It was. It was easy and quick to make, and will definately become a staple for busy nughts.
