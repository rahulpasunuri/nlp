Question: Could frozen pearl onions be used? Thaw before cooking in cream?

I thought it was terrific. To cook from New York...I've never commented on another person's post, but really??? Seems like a clerical error regarding this recipe coming up under search for vegan when it contains dairy. Not like it is a conspiracy. Relax and move on to another recipe. Geesh

"Vegan" denotes a dish that is free of all meats, eggs, AND dairy. Nothing that came from an animal is vegan, i.e. whipping cream. Please remove vegan from the dietary considerations heading.

This dish is delicious! It tastes fresh and slightly sweet. I have made it several times now and have always received praise. I made exactly as it is written and would not change a thing!

Our daughter-in-law made this for Thanksgiving 2005, and it just bowled me over. It's a fabulous vegetable dish. It's definitely going into my collection for future use.

What a wonderful dish! You get all these veggies, the rich, creamy sauce, and the fork-tender pearl onions. It looks great on the plate, too! Perfect for Thanksgiving. My guests "gobbled" it.

I only loosely followed this recipe, and it was delicious. I didn't have pearl onions, so I used chopped red onion, which I just sauteed with the red pepper, some garlic, and the zucchini. Added some whipping cream (and light cream having run out of whipping cream). Cooked that down some and then added a can of corn, basil, and more light cream. Cooked until reduced and thick. Yummy, and easy.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I simmered the cream and onions a little bit longer than called for to thicken things up. I also added some freshly grated parmesan cheese at the end then I put it in a cassarole dish, sprinkled french fried onion rings over the top and baked for about 10 minutes to brown the onion rings. It was a definite hit with my family. Seconds all around!!

When down to the wire, trying to get dinner on the table and you need a quick veggie recipe, give this a try. Have made it for our pre-thanksgiving dinner by request for the past three years. It's a keeper!

California succotash has been a family standard for holidays since appearing in Bon Appetit in 1999. Try adding green pepper along with the red for the Chistmas version! We brought this to a Boy Scout pot luck dinner where it quickly disappeared.

Made this a couple of year's ago for Thanksgiving with friends. Everyone loved it! A colorful, easy-to-prepare and fresh-tasting alternative to the usual holiday sides. Next time, I'll try adding a crushed garlic clove and a little basil to spark up the flavor. Definitely a keeper.
