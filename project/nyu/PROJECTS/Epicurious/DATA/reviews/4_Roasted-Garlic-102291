Buy a baggie of refrigerated peeled garlic cloves from an Asian market to make it even easier to prepare (or to produce larger quantities). Saves you from the foil and gooey husks; just roast in a covered terra cotta or ceramic dish. Keeps in the frig for months. Great flavoring for a dipping oil or spreads for bread, pasta Aglia Olio, soups, potato dishes, marinades.

Could not be easier! No special garlic bakers....just follow the recipe.

Very good AND very easy! Came out perfect....just make sure to wrap each head of garlic individually with foil.

I'll make roasted garlic bulbs and in addition to placing them on French bread I suggest adding a slice/portion of softened Brie cheese to the bread, add a roasted garlic clove, eat and wash down with your favorite red wine.

Outstanding. I doused each bulb w/olive oil and then wrapped them individually in foil. Squeeze it right on toasted french bread for a delicious meal or snack.

Wonderful and easy, a1though had the seemingly straightforward instructions been less ambiguous, I would have had good resalts the first time and not have to waste the first batch: maybe it's just me, but had the instructions more explicitly called for wrapping each head of garlic tightly in foil individually, I would not have wrapped the entire baking sheet and all the heads together collectively, the latter of which resulted in dried out, very underdone results that I had to toss.

I only made one bulb of garlic to go with my mashed potatoes. It was very mild. Good but mild. I had to use the entire thing in my mashed potatoes. Also, I had somewhat of a challenge getting the roasted garlic out of the skins.Are you supposed to peel it all first? Should I have roasted it longer? I'm new to home cooking so I'm not sure. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Easy and tastes great. I added roasted garlic with fresh basil pesto and goat cheese to spread on crostini. I also stuffed cherry tomatoes with the mixture. Great for appetizers or a light meal.

Roasted garlic is one of my favorite appetizers! I like to serve it with crackers and a round of brie with some jalapeno jelly for a finishing touch. Delicious!

This is a great way to get more out of garlic. Great.

This is such a simple, basic recipie, but it comes out just perfect every time. I use the garlic to mix into my already wonderful mashed potatoes. Now they taste divine. And oh how it makes my house smell!! I make this often.

Easy and tastes great! Wonderful spread for bread instead of butter!

We only needed one clove, so we used just the one, peeled and coated with olive oil and salt and wrapped in foil. It roasted wonderfully and just as well as four in a pan.
