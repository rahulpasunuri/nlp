I agree with Laurie from Clarkston!!!! The comments alone made me make this salad, and it was great!!! If I had a restaurant, I too would feature it as a special on principle alone. Now that I'm full and happy with a new recipe, I think I'll go adoringly thank my husband (helpmate, partner, lover, Knight in shinging armor,whatever) for the beautiful diamond on my hand and all the love and understanding that has come with it over the years. This site is too fun sometimes

Was perfect for a quick lunch, yet not another sandwich. I used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar. I used the sesame oil, but found it so overbearing, that I only added a little and still had to add more vinegar and soy. Dressy was perfectly tangy to dress up blah canned tuna!

I have to agree with the last reviewer. I've made a lot of dressings both from recipes and not. This could be better by a better cook, but as I am one of those cooks who has trouble following a recipe exactly this recipe was great. The result was very tasty and certainly will be different the next time and no doubt tasty again. HAVE FUN WITH THIS RECIPE!!!! I did.

I'm giving this recipe a 4 fork for entertainment !) I found the recipe more entertaining than the reviews! I will make this tonight, and since I'm aware of dressing proportions,(usually 1 part vinegar to 3 parts oil) it shouldn't be difficult. The only suggestion I'd make looking at this is to use peanut oil with just a small amount of dark sesame as the later is very strong, and usually a Tablespoon is enough. so for anyone trying this, keep this in mind. The plain sesame oil is not toasted and is not strong, but it's much more expensive than peanut oil which I use for most oriental style dressings. To comment to all those reviewers in cyberspace.. The only true thing to be serious about in this world is: John 3:16 God Bless!

Past reviews for this recipe intrigued me. I like controversial recipes. There's nothing tacky about a sturdy tuna and pasta dish - as long as it ISN'T served ad nauseum. Thanks for the interesting reading and the recipe.

For those of you that are not impressed by the intro of this recipe then here is where is comes from. The intro comes from the book Food and Whine. Here is the summary of that book: If you want to relate to the absurd realities of mother-, wife-, and daughterhood, you'll devour Food and Whine's comic highs and lows. If, however, you prefer otherworldly order and perfection, you might be better off with a copy of Martha Stewart Living.

Gaze at knife cuts and steam burns on your left and right hands. Remember how, yesterday, when you are single in Chicago, riding the train home from culinary school, and men made rude remarks about the chef's outfit and your ever-expanding rear end, you'd dream about the day your male professors would hang the cordon bleu around your woman's neck. Those trips with your friend, Pierre, to Paris--how the steaks sparkled under mayonnaise. And so, my friend, it comes to this: yet another jibe at women's dreams, whatever they may be, that we are not allowed to feel upset about, for the kabillionth time.

Why couldn't they just give the damn measurements for the dressing???????

This recipe looks easy enough. Maybe I'll use shortened linguini instead of the spaghetti. But the main reason I am going to make this is a) to spite the PC critics, b) it looks good, and c) maybe I'll get lucky tonight!

I made tihs and really liked it. Though I highly resent the Cook fromn COlumbus implying that having feminist sensibilties makes you crazy, and so do my 3 cats.

Holy Cow....I'm going to make this dish tonight just to spite a bunch of crazy chicks who were actually offended by a recipe. I'm giving it 4 Forks without even trying it.

Very quick, very tasty, and lots of vegetables. All the furious reviews were hilarious, but give the author a break! She's just sick of always having to cook dinner!!!! Loved the fact it called for canned tuna; when money's tight can't afford fresh fish.

WOW...it's a darn good thing that Mr. Hershey never put any of his private thoughts on his chocolate wrappers, huh? Or then again maybe he should have and then some of us who cook/eat according to the creators pinings would not be quite as thick as we are , especially around the head! I'm not a big tuna fan but made the dish just to see... not how it tasted but what would happen if I did. Well it tasted ok (for a tuna dish) and I'm still the same individual, independent woman I was before! Imagine that. My kids liked it, I hope that I have not damaged their futures!

The recipe was good, the comments great. I am a name partner in a law firm, and the mother of 3. My passions, besides cooking are playing ice hockey and quilting. I both dream of a knight in shining armor rescuing me, and dream of being the kinght in shining armor doing the rescue. Depends on my mood. So, according to the comments, I should only cook this salad when I feel in need of rescue by an easy, but good recipe. Oh, and when I am barefoot!

Good grief .....grow up ladies! This recipe was delicious and easy too. Some of the reviewers sound like spoiled brats, sucking bottles in a play-pen! WAAAH.."I'm not making the recipe because I didn't like the prologue''

Three words: get over it The recipe is good. (Isn't that what this website is about??)

Now, now, Ladies, let's not get too macho! I am a feminist from way back and I believe the Goddess made my man to be my helpmate, and I still have my knight in somewhat tarnished armor (but, alas, no diamonds)and I still dream silly dreams. I love going barefoot. I really loved being pregnant. And I still love being in the kitchen. If one doesn't like any of these situations I suggest they simply wear shoes, tie their tubes and eat out. I still have my sense of humor and I wouldn't make this salad on my principal OR my teacher, but not because of some silly words but because I don't like canned tuna in ANY pasta salad. Also, I make a similiar dish that is so-o-o-o good without the vinegar and mustard, substituting tamari for soy, cashews for peanuts, and Snow peas for frozen, and adding diced red peppers, garlic, broccoli florets and scallions. I have had much more fun with the reviewers than the recipe and I thank you. P.S. ALL women don't dream of men in armor, some dream of women. I applaud our differences while rejoicing in our oneness.

Ladies, get over yourselves! Just because the author described feelings that she and her friends shared...(and probably you also but you don't dare admit it,) is no reason not to try this wonderful dish! Not only will I make it again but I will featur it in my restaurant as a special. What has happened to the "feminist"? Where is the femininity?

I agree that the prologue is a little corny. But God made women as a man's helpmate. I am a 26 year old woman with a college education working in a major brokerage firm, and I am not the least bit offended by the prologue. I think all women dream of a knight in shining armor. I won't make this dish because I don't like oriental cooking - NOT because of the prologue!!

You've got to be kidding!! welcome to the year 2000- feminists against oriental pasta salad!!! I am not making this dish on principal either.

So what if the beginning was corny, I really liked the salad. I think the peanuts and seasame oil gave it a wonderful taste.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but it sounds good and I thought the prologue was quite funny -- i love food, cooking and marriage (among many other things...)!

I agree with the above cook---WHAT A STUPID PROLOGUE!! First we dream about men saving us from bad situations, what is next? Barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen? Is this what this website is all about? I am never making this dish just because the author is a moron.

I didn't make this salad. Why? Because of the super-stupid prologue! When men hassle you, you dream of the day that another man will save you from this frustration? Maybe it's the recipe that matters, but i was so disgusted by these brainless comments that i couldn't read on because i was gagging to hard.
