I love love love this recipe!!! I do not have a doughnut pan... so I used a muffin tin. I only drink fat free milk and didn't want to buy a whole container of whole, so I used fat free and had no problem!!! I thought it would be a little too much nutmeg for my taste, but it actually sets everything off amazingly. I rolled it in sugar after it came out, and it turned out amazing. I was a bit nervous that I over mixed it, because it looked a bit rubbery, but turned out perfectly. I am most definitly doing this again!!! Love it!
