I made this dish last night in hopes for a delicious corned beef hash. This is not it. It was weirdly sweet and very dry. The corned beef was very flavorful before mixing with the rest of the ingredients, then all of the flavor went somewhere.....won't make again, as it was a waste of very good ingredients.

First time making hash with leftover corned beef. Seemed like a solid recipe. I didn't get what the cream was about, but I added it anyway. I don't think it would be missed. I did poached eggs, but next time I'll do over-easy.

Wow, this was yummy. I used leftover corned beef from St. Patty's day. Had a poblano pepper instead of red bell, that worked out great anyway. Served w/side of buttered rye toast, eggs, sliced avocado and tobasco sauce. Great start to any weekend.

The splash of cream and handful of parsley are what make this better than your average hash. I made my own corned beef for this and it was a great way to highlight it.

One fork, because this recipe was just OK. I was disappointed because of all of the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added more onion and peppers for more flavor...and we all thought it tasted very bland. I put it under the broiler to crisp it, but even that didn't help make it tasty enough to make again.

I joined this site because of this recipe! I cooked a 4 pound brisket (flat cut) in the crockpot with onion, garlic and a bay leaf and the amount was just right for the recipe. Like others, I used a bag of Simply Potatoes and cut the potatoes up a bit. Food processor worked well for the brisket and I added some extra onion. It was soooo delicious! Served it for Christmas Day brunch.

This is a great recipe. For years I have been buying the Swenson Corned Beef in the package which you can find at your local grocery store (Safeway for me in Oakland, CA). However they come in 4 pound packages roughly which ends up being about 3 pounds of cooked corned beef when cooked. So I tripled the recipe. I added a twist however because as a kid I would always want my corned beef hash to have a "crispy top." Mincing the beef in a Cuisinart is a great idea too. Just 5 or 6 quick pulses gets the meat finely chopped but don't go too much or you will get mush. I then combined everything in two casserole dishes (remember, I had tripled the recipe so had enough for about one 9 X 13 dish and a smaller maybe 6 X 9 dish). I put the casserole dishes in the over at 450 degrees for about 20 minutes to get a nice "crust" on the top - this is now the perfect corned beef recipe and my family absolutely LOVED IT including my 7 and 11 year old girls. Also, the corned beef itself is salty enough so you do NOT have to add any additional salt.

This is a great recipe. So easy--I too used Simply Potatoes. I chopped them up a bit based on readers' comments that the potatoes were better smaller. Great tip. I also didn't have any heavy cream so blended some skim milk and fat free sour cream. Healthier and it still tasted great.

Amazing! To simplify, I used Spicy Turkey Sausage meat from the Farmer's Market instead of Corned Beef. Just sauteed it and added to skillet in place of the beef. No red bell pepper, but a small handful of chopped fresh sage before the cream made ALL the difference. This is an easy and a delicious brunch recipe. Cooked the eggs into it as well, took a little longer than I expected, but great presentation!

I omitted bell pepper, and used fresh Turkey sausage from the farmer's market instead of Corned beef. Just sauteed the meat in a skillet until done and added it instead of the beef. No extra seasoning. Chopped 4 TB fresh sage and added before the cream. Delicious!

this hash rocks! I was a little leery about finishing with cream, but it definitely made a difference. Made twice, pulling the fat off the cooked brisket once before processing and leaving half of it on the second time; the batch without the fat was definitely drier. also used "simply potatoes" diced with onion; as is in first batch and chopped smaller in the second. Smaller is better, texture-wise. but no matter what you do, this hash will disappear! I can't wait for an excuse to make it again. Served with poached eggs, toasted whole-grain english muffins and a meyer lemon hollandaise. OMG.

I enjoyed this very much, what a great way to use up corned beef. I added mushrooms and garlic as per some other reviewers suggestions. I did find that the potatoes took a lot longer to brown than the suggested five minutes. So will probably try removing the vegetables when I fry them next time, then re-adding the veg with the corned beef towards the end. Will be using this recipe time and time again to use up old corned beef.

Deeeeeelicious! I followed some of the reviewers' modifications such as adding chopped garlic and leaving the skins on the potatoes. I also added chopped green onions and mushrooms. My husband and I loved it. It reminded of us of the corned beef hash at a restaurant in Berkeley, CA. I will make this for my in-laws.

wonderful blend of home yet refined enough to really appreciate all the flavors. Followed recipe to a T, and keep the egg yolks runny! It adds such creaminess to the hash

This recipe is very successful. I did make a couple of additions: after adding the cream, I added a layer of chopped broccoli and covered the pan to steam it for about 5 minutes. Then sprinkled with crumbled feta. Makes a very colorful and delicious dish!

The only thing I added was crushed, chopped garlic with the onions and RED bell peppers. I got corned beef from the deli and just chopped it up before adding to the veggies. I thought the cream was a bit weird but added it just the same and it made the dish moist and extra yummy. Had it for breakfast with scrambled eggs and spared us from turkey overdose the morning after Thanksgiving.

This may be the best corned beef hash recipe, yet so simple. I substituted fresh for a canned corned beef,cover it for 1 minute, then stirred it in, didn't peel the potatoes either, and used a 1/3 cup of half and half. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent - best hash recipe I have found! I corned my own beef using the Cooks Illustrated recipe and used leftovers for this hash. I followed the recipe exactly, unusual for me. I was amazed on how much that 1/4 of cream adds to the dish. Don't leave it out, don't substitute milk, it just isn't the same without it. Also, I was skeptical of adding red pepper but I went with the recipe. It absolutely works, don't skip it and definitely don't use green bell pepper (more bitter tasting, less sweet).

additionally...I did not peel the potatoes (my family never peels potatoes whether it is french fries or mashed etc.)

Just made for father's day for my dad. he always orders corn beef hash when we go out which is where I got the idea. He said it was the best he has ever had! Even my mother agreed who usually turns her nose up at such foods. Notes: I used 1 teaspoon dried thyme, no parsley, used additional butter through-out to help browning of potatoes, used deli-sliced corn beef sliced into strips, 1/2 inch diced potatoes, used half and half (because it is what was in the house), no bell pepper, added one clove garlic. Served with poached eggs and whole grain bread.

What a great way to use leftover corned beef! This was an easy to prepare and very flavorful hash. My husband loved it. I will definitely make this one again.

I have been making this recipe for years and it has never failed to entice my family to come to the table! Recently at a restaurant while having breakfast (fishing buddies, who are very manly and do not discuss cooking - and me, the only woman), one of my husbands friends ordered corned beef hash. Of course  what arrived at the table was straight out of a can and was the epitome of everybodys pre-conceived notion of what it is supposed to be. My husband and son (who is 15- and again  does not discuss cooking) could not stop telling these guys how good MY corned beef hash is. I could not stop blushing, and lets be honest it felt great!!! As for the cook who said it was dry, I wonder about the quality of the corned beef they started with. And BLA???? NO WAY!!! Tomorrow morning I am delivering this recipe by special demand for the same group of fishermen. I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WILL BE EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS! EVERYBODY SHOULD TRY THIS RECIPE!

I found this quite good, tasty in that 'umami' way. I had it with fried eggs on the side and it was perfect as a rich sunday brunch (also helping combat the effects of last night's martinis!)

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a big hit. I store the leftovers in small plasic containers for freezing. For breakfast add to a small nostick skillet and cook until has is slightly brown, top with an egg, cover for a few minutes, and serve.

Yum-made this last night with left over roasted potatoes and corned beef as part of "left over extravaganza". This is what I call the dinner when I clean out all the left overs. Only change was to use olive oil instead of butter and finished the eggs in the oven. Will make it again. Even the kids liked it and didn't pick out the peppers

I love this recipe and have been making it since I saw it in my 1999 December issue of Gourmet. I have not changed a single thing in the ingredients of this dish other than adding some additional red bell pepper or red onions since the family likes these vegies so much and add such a wonderful flavor. I don't know how one cook came up with a green bell pepper, but that sounds awful; it must be a red bell pepper!!! Sometimes a little additional cooking time is needed depending on how you like your potatoes, etc. The only thing I did different was shred the beef instead of cubing it. My husband prefers it that way and so do I. The blending of flavors is incredible when the meat is broken down more. I have made it a dozen times plus and have never been disappointed. This is a keeper!!!

Perfect - cooked it a lot longer than called for - for a crunchy bottom - If you want to be really decatant, try making a hollandaise sauce to pour over the eggs - WOW

I made this omitting the bell pepper (didn't have one), no butter (used olive oil), used leftover baby dutch yellow potatoes with skins (just cubed them), no cream (used half & half), and did it with the eggs since I didn't have a full pound of beef leftover from our Irish dinner. I left the beef cubed (approximately the same size as the pototoes), and cooked it in my 12 inch cast iron skillet. It made a crusty bottom that was irresistable. All in all, it only took about 15 minutes to cook because most of the ingredients were already cooked. It was the perfect thing to make with the leftovers from our Corned Beef Irish dinner. Next time, I'll make sure I have bell pepper but I'll always use the waxy Baby Dutch Potatoes since they don't get mushy or fall apart easily. Fantastic!

It was kind of BLA! It seemed to have little flavor, and it was kind of dry. I followed the directions exactly. Also it took much longer than 5 minutes to brown the potatoes. My son liked it though. I guess that says something!?

This recipe is great. The only change I made is that I brown it for longer than they call for. Because I double the recipe, I brown it under the broiler in the oven until till it's really crispy on top. Then I put the eggs in, and finish it on top of the stove.

This is fantastic corned beef hash. I never liked it before as I thought it always tasted like the stuff in the can. This is unbelievably good and if you don't want the eggs, you don't need to add them but they look neat cooked into the dish. Get the corned beef at the deli - ask them to just cut you a chunk. Great on weekends when you have the extra time.

Yum, yum!!! A must with left over New Year's corned beef. I would add another red pepper next time and some beets.

i make a similar dish but use ham and spring onions or cooked chicken with small pieces of stuffing added at the last moment. great for that extra dish for a bbq or salad meal instead of potato salad. it is great sprinkled with my dressing. 6 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp white vinegar, 1 heaped tsp prepared mustard, 1 tbsp chopped parsely, 3 tsp cator sugar. shake all vigorous together and just sprinkle of anything.

ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RECIPE. I'VE MADE IT SEVERAL TIMES AND MY HUSBAND GOES NUTS OVER IT. I KNOW WHEN STARTS HAVING THE CRAVING FOR THE DISH. HE COMES HOME WITH CORNBEEF IN HAND. THIS A KEEPER RECIPE. I DIDN'T ALTER ANYTHING IN THE RECIPE, WHICH IS VERY HARD FOR ME. GIVE THIS DISH A TRY.

My husband *loves* corned beef hash - especially when I make it from scratch with my own corned beef. Of course, this recipe can't compete with that - but this one is darn good and a lot easier. I bought a hunk of corned beef at the deli counter, added more onion because we love onions, and had a wonderful breakfast. The true test was that Hash Fan Husband was completely happy, and delighted with leftovers the next day! This one will be a breakfast keeper for us.
