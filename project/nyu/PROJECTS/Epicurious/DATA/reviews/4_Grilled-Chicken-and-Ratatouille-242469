I have made this recipe twice now. It truly is quick, easy and delicious. The first time I did it on the grill. The second time, we were out of propane, so I did the chicken in a Le Creuset grill pan and the veggies in a pot. I love the flavors and I was glad that I could get most of the ingredients from my garden. I would absolutely make it again.

Great recipe and easy to make. I will try the balsamic vinegar next time but this is a winner as it is.

An excellent, quick supper. I make it often, and usually add in whatever fresh herbs I have on hand: marjoram, parsley, etc. along with the basil. Also works well made indoors on a grill pan.

Wonderful meal - placed garlic crostinis under the grilled veggies to soak up the vinegar & oil - delicious! Easy to make, healthy, & tasty. My husband's nit a fan of eggplant, onions, or zucchinis & he enjoyed every bite. This meal concept - grilled veggies & meat will be in heavy rotation this summer.

I have made this recipe twice now and both times it was a crowd pleaser! Great simple, light summer fare. Made it yesterday for a baby shower with Salt encrusted BBQ tritip as well. Once again it was a hit! Espeially for those looking for healthy eating choices.

Nothing exceptional. Filling but not one I'd run to make in a hurry. Maybe better on the barbie rather in the grill.

My wife said "you need to make this on a monthly...no, on a weekly basis." Simple, flavourful and fantastic!

Increadibly easy to make and delicious! Although I ommitted the eggplant (not a fan), I followed the recipe. It came out GREAT! I will make this again soon.

Excellent. Great use of garden veggies! Easy end of summer meal.

My husband wasn't sure whether he would like this dish because he seldom eats some of the vegetables in the dish. However, he loved the ratatouille and kept commenting on the "dressing". He has asked me to make this a number of times.

The vegetables were wonderful! Local farmer's market did not have Japanese eggplant, but regular eggplant was a great substitute. (I cut into smaller wedges when cooking and smaller chunks afterward.) Thanks for the tip about using a broiler. That worked really well! Also subbed balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar. The chicken lacked a little flavor, though was very tender. I think I will try marinading it in the future when I make this dish again.

This is just delicious. Made for Labor Day party last year. It was a big hit and the leftovers were great.

Since I hate dealing with our problematic gas grill, I used the broiler in our oven  Worked Great! Used chicken thighs instead of breast = tasty! Would probably double the veggies next time, for that was the first to be gobbled up. Husband kept telling me (in between bites) how much he loved the meal, and me. Guess it's a keeper.

This was a very quick and easy way to do a grilled ratatuille and it could be used as a vegetable dish alongside many things. Have leftovers for lunch this week.I grated some parmigianna padano on top which was great with it too. Wil definitely be making again.

A very quick, simple, and healthy meal. My husband loved it, especially the eggplant which he normally hates. I added a generous handful of fresh basil and eyeballed the vinegar. This one will definetely be added to our summer rotation menu as out here in the desert all our meals are grilled.

When I read the rating and reviews for this I was skeptical...how could something so basic be so good? OMG!! This was fabulous. I added garlic when olive oil was added. I also marinated my chicken in store bought mojo. I also wasn't sure what rough chop was...I cut into bite size pieces and that was perfect! Absolutely wonderful! Served with Alton Brown's Brown Rice Recipe (google it, it is on Food Network website)..this will make it into my rotation. Healthy and tasty...how can I go wrong?

Made this recipe last night for the whole family then we had a movie night for the kids (Maybe not so original but still fun!). This was a tasty meal with a glass of red and some bread for passing. Great way to serve your family veg. The only thing I added was 2 cloves of garlic to the vegetables before grilling and a little parm at the finish. Oh ya, balsamic too instead of red wine vinegar. This will be added to my regular rotation!

A HOMERUN! Everyone in the house love this, including a 4 year old who said(mmmmmm) every bite! I prepared as stated in the recipe but also added fresh mushrooms and about 1 cup of medium pace salsa to give it a punch. I was asked to make this again....soon!

As mentioned this is a good and simple recipe. The vegetables deserve 4 forks and I will do them again regularly but the chicken was a little plain. My daughter and I thought that next time I might slice chicken immediately and toss with the veggies to give it more flavor.

This was pretty good, and very easy. Great way to get piles of vegetables into my family (I used 2 big peppers). I used a large regular eggplant and would try for the Japanese kind, or a smaller one, next time (there was a little too much super-squishy eggplant in the mix).

This is a surprisingly simple recipe with incredibly delicious results. I followed the recipe except that I grilled and chopped a jalapeno pepper, and added it to the ratatouille. This is an excellent late summer dish.

A great example of simple being not just good but exceptional. My only change was to usse herbes de provence instead of basil. I'll be making this agian.

Ratatouille has long been one of my go-to recipes, so I was really excited to try a new variation. I'm definitely adding this one to my repertoire. It's simple, delicious and healthy; the colors and flavors blend beautifully. I served it with brown rice and barley to make a complete meal. I think quinoa would also make a good complement.

Great recipe, have already made 5 times this summer. It is a huge hit. My notes would be to use balsamic instead of red wine vinegar and be carefull not to use to much basil.

Thought the ratatouille was excellent but the chicken adequate. I would love to try with the mentioned balsamic chicken breasts with bleu cheese, but am disappointed that I can't find this recipe in Epicurious.

I was suspicious of this recipe given that I love traditional ratatouille. The results were good, but not fabulous. The next day however, I do believe the dish improved. Given the ease of preparation, clean up and flavor, it is a definite keeper.

I made this without the eggplant and used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. Was delicious and a very healthy and easy dinner.

This recipe is amazing....a wonderful use for eggplant which I do not eat as much as I should. I will definately make this again. The starch was not at all missed!

Simple and delicious! The smokiness of the ratatouille is a perfect compliment to the grilled chicken (just be careful not to overcook the chicken). Used Bell and Evans chicken breasts and italian eggplant as I couldn't find Japanese. The quality of your ingredients will really shine as it's not a fussy recipe. I have made this for guests twice this month and it platters up great for a crowd. Serve with the grilled smashed rosemary potatoes from the August 2008 issue. Very well received by guests.

I am not a vegetable person, but when we got zucchini from our CSA I was looking for an easy and yummy way to get me and my husband to eat it. This is absolutely delicious. We added a tomato since they are in season now, and the whole thing was full of flavor.

The vegetables in this recipe are outstanding. We used them for several days, hot and cold in sandwiches, etc. The chicken is very basic and isn't critical to the recipe. Any other favorite could be used.

This was a fantastic dinner. It was one of the easiest meals that I have ever made. I cooked all of the vegetables suggested and added some asparagus as well.

Very simple, quite tasty. I chopped all the veggies first and cooked them on the grill in a stir-fry pan made for the grill; this simplied the final steps required for serving.

This was delicious! I actually made it inside on my Cuisinart grill and just grilled the vegetables in batches. It was wonderful the night I made it and still enjoyable all week. I've been eating it cold for lunches.
