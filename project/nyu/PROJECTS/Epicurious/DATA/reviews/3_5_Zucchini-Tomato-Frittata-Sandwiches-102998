I made these to eat cold for an impromptu picnic and they were delicious! Even my veg-hating husband liked them (though my 1 1/2 year old wasn't thrilled with them). I didn't have basil or tapenade on hand, so I used fresh cilantro and light cream cheese and they were still good. They are great for picnics, btw, because they are easy to eat - no vegetables falling off the sandwiches!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this frittata as a light dinner. We added onions to the recipe. We, too, ended up broiling the frittata for a minute or two, in order to get it to set--good tip!

Had this for dinner tonight with rosemary roasted new potatoes and mesculan salad with shallot dressing. We did not put the frittata on a sandwich but instead put a little tapenada on each wedge. It was delicious and healthy. Don't change a thing.

This was so good. Very interesting flavors, yet easy. I had to cover the frittata and cook longer than stated, but came out great! The tapenade is a must. I also used fresh baby spinach to top the frittata. Yum!

I've made frittatas for years, but never as a sandwich. This has good flavor and is hearty as a sandwich. To the cook from Minneapolis: no need to flip the frittata, just place under a broiler until it set or begins to brown. Don't let it get too brown or it will be dry.

This is awesome! So healthy, so flavorful, so easy. I cut it in half for a light lunch for my husband and me, so I used 2 egg whites and 1 egg. My husband doesn't care for tapenade, so he had a red pepper sauce on his sandwich - both ways were delicious! I did flip the frittat to cook it on both sides and cooked it a little longer than called for.
