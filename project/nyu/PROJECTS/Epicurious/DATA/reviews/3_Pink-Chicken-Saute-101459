I also used boneless chicken breast for this recipe, don't imagine they were ready available in the markets in 1959 when this recipe was plublished. Turned out very good and easy to prepare.

I modified this recipe by using shallots instead of onions and boneless, skinless breasts. I also used a bit less wine (1/4 cup less) and added 1 cup of chicken stock. My garnish was green onions thinly sliced on the diagonal which added the punch this dish needed (instead of parsley). My guests loved it and raved for days.
