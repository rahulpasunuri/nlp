I made a variation on this dish and it was delicious! I followed the directions for the sauce, as-is. Then I crisped up some prosciutto bits and pan fried tilapia filets in the same pan. I served the filets over rice with the sauce, prosciutto, and onion compote over it. The only change I would make next time would be to reduce the amount of onions by about half - there ended up being way more than we needed for this variation. Also, the sauce was a bit sweet but we liked it. Non-sweet tooths might want to decrease the sugar a bit.

Does anyone have any ideas for good veggies that would go well with recipe? This fish is delicious! The sauce is an essential part, so make plenty. One problem I had was that the fish was next to impossible to flip over in the pan, resulting in the whole thing being a big jumble with the head somewhere on the stomach and the presentation being awful. Good thing I did a test run before my dinner party! I am now planning to make the bacon separately, then put it inside the fish and bake it together so the flavor will be absorbed. The whole thing is VERY good, and super-fast and easy to make!

I've never had trout before, and we were given a 3-4 lb fish from a friend. This recipe looked promising, and we were not disappointed! The sauce is amazing, and the fish was flaky and rich, like mild salmon. I was surprised at how easily the fish deboned itself after cooking in the oven. Unfortunately the bacon was lost with the skin, and added little more than a light smokiness to the fish. The sweet onion was a wonderful complement to the fish, and the sauce crowned the meal. I will definitely be making this again, and the sauce will be just as good on salmon or filet mignon.

I used Pink Salmon Fillets, a fish that usually isn't well thought of as a table fish. I substituted blueberry yogurt and a little hazelnut coffee creamer for the heavy cream. I used Walla Walla sweet onions. Instead of stuffing and wrapping the fillet, I placed the bacon and a little of the onion compote into the pan, then placed the fillet skin up on the mixture. I removed the fillet briefly so that the bacon could be turned. The balance of the compote was added when the salmon was placed into the oven. This turned out to be one of the best salmon dishes that I have ever had.

Very tasty. Didn't think it was too much work for the end result. Seemed too sweet, but I used Maui Onions, so it might have been those... Definately would make again.

A lot of work for a so-so dish. It certainly looked impressive, but neither my boyfriend nor I actually liked the taste of the dish. We both had a few bites, then threw the rest away. The trout would have been tastier on its own.

Too complicated a dish for the end result. I adore making sauces but the trout doesn't need such an elaborate sauce. The bacon is a nice idea.

Excellent. Everyone loved it.

I left the cream out of this recipe and only used two strips bacon per trout (but really good, thick, Niman's Ranch applewood smoked bacon) and it was delicious. I don't see any need for the cream. The flesh had a wonderful texture, and the smoke of the bacon, and the sweetness of the onions, it was terrific. I also cooked up a couple of scallions along with the trout -- in the frying pan, reserve them, then back in the oven at the end and they were great

My brother, a friend from Kansas, and I trout fish once or twice a year in Colorado. We first tried this recipe three years ago, and it has won first place on the menu ever since. Absolutely delightful. More delightful the higher the elevation, with fresh rainbow, cutthroat, or German brown.

This dish was excellent! Great sauce and a great balance of flavors. (I did not have whole trout, so I wrapped two, skinned pieces with the bacon and it still worked out fine. My husband loved the dish. Only negative comments: not enough sauce and it takes quite a while to prepare for such a simple dish.

The sauce in this recipe is wonderful. Easy to make, but time consuming.
