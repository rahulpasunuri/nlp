I really enjoyed this dish but it's very labor intensive and time- consuming. With prep time included, the first time I made it it took me closer to 5 hours from start to finish. The walnut sauce is a perfect finishing touch and adds a great flavor and texture to the dish. The pomegranates are great as well and balance the savory with a great touch of sweet. I was underwhelmed by the stuffing and have found that the foundations of this recipe are good but I prefer to play around with the stuffing. I have made it with ground beef and sauteed vegetables and a blackberry jam instead of pomegranate seeds, which are only in season for a short time.

WOW! the flavors of this dish are amazing! Three of us got together and made this for a dinner party, which helped make the whole process go faster, it would have taken ages to make alone. Made almost exactly as is. The few tweeks: used coconut milk instead of regular milk for the sauce, which was fantastic! One person in our party was allergic to walnuts, so we subbed pecans instead. No pomegranates were to be found, so we skipped this portion, really can't imagine that it affects the flavor all that much... One note, I grew chillies in my garden and then had to supplement with a few store bought chillies, the ones from the store were much much hotter than the ones from my garden. The hotter chillies totally overpowered the subtle flavors in the stuffing. I would recommend choosing chillies that have a kick, but are not too spicy.

This recipe was amazing. Tons of work, but well worth the effort for a special occasion. The sauce was so simple and delicious that my dinner guests didn't believe me when I told them what was in it. I shredded the pork instead of chopping it, but I don't imagine it made much difference. Lovely flavors. Now I just need to find someone to roast and peel the peppers for me, its a pain.

Delicious! I used crystalized pinneaple instead of the peaches and came out great.

I was so excited to find this recipe because it really tastes like what my friend's mom made for me when I visited them in Mexico. It's time consuming, but very impressive to guests who haven't had it.

Do people understand that this is the celebration dish "Chiles en Nogada" that is the heart of Puebla Mexican cooking? It's a dish served in late summer and at most Pueblan restaurants its scrumptious. Do dot scrim on the walnut sauce. The green poblan, the white walnut sauce and the red pomegranate seeds represent the colors of the Mexican flag. Viva Mexico!

Excellent! I actually purchased pulled pork from my local Whole Foods and skipped that step. Definitel company-worthy.

I thought the sauce wasn't worth the money, or really needed. The peppers were alright.

This was a great idea for leftover cubed pork. The filling is nothing short of a celebration of textures and tastes, well worth the effort.
