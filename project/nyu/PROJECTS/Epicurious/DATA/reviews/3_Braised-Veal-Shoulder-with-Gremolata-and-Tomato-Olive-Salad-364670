P.S. the leftover sauce makes a great stock to add to minestrone soup!

I just made this for Rosh Hashana. My husband, an artist, said it was like "a work of art." It was delicious and tender. I should add that for the baking part of the recipe, I used an oven bag. Also, I left the vegetables intact (i.e. skipped that last part where you puree the veggies, simply because I had no time). But it was delicious, and my family and our guests enjoyed. When you buy a really expensive cut of meat like veal, you need a no-fail recipe like this one, and it really worked.

For those having a problem with the recipe as written, simply go to www.BonAppetit.com and enter the recipe name (use sauce instead of salad).

I made this for our seder and it was delicious. The veal was so tender, and it presented very well.

I made this veal shoulder for company and it was excellent - and it got rave reviews from my guests. My oven is hot, so I braised it for about 2 hours, rather than 2 1/2. I refrigerated the veal overnight and sliced it the next day, finishing the sauce then as well. The other reviews have whined about the typos (salad instead of sauce) in the posting, but the recipe is excellent and I would make it again.

Can't rate the recipe yet but the print version has the instructions for the gremolate: Combine all [gremolata] ingredients in a medium bowl and toss to combine. Not sure if I'll try this though, lots of recipe issues and no reviews from anyone who's successfully made it!

I am noticing fennel bulb in the picture and see that it is not in the list of ingredients. Was this a photography error or something that was left out of the recipe by mistake?

You would think that someone would read the "recipe of the day" before it was published as such. Clearly, this recipe has a significant error that isn't hard to fix (or to imagine how to work around) but it does indicate that the QA processes for content need some work.

I think all you do is mix the gremolata ingredients together and add it to the veal as instructed. But this is yet another recipe here that makes me wonder if anyone at this web site takes even a few seconds to check what is posted. There have been numerous gaffs and no one there seems to care.
