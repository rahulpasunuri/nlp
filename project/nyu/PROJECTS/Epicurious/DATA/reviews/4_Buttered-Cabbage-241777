Quick and delicious side for a weeknight meal. I used regular green cabbage and added a splash of ponzu at the end to add a bit of acid. The citrus seasoning in the ponzu added a little brightness to the dish. Served it with pan seared chicken breasts topped with an asian-style sauce (http://reluctantgourmet.com/component/k2/item/779:chicken-with-pan-sauce). Delicious and I had everything in the house already.

This is a lovely, simple recipe that highlights the sweetness of cabbage. To aslandreams from Orlando. In Ireland a dish of cabbage and mashed potatoes is called colcannon. It often includes sauteed leeks or scallions.

Delicious, and the cabbage was cooked perfectly (not too mushy, not too crunchy).

I didn't realize plain old cabbage could be so delicious. Perhaps my love of butter and the amount of butter in the recipe played a role, but I'll definitely be making this the next time I get cabbage in my organic box.

It's incredible how simple this recipe is and how tasty the results are. I used a bag of Trader Joe's shredded cabbage and about 1.5 tablespoons of butter. My husband and I loved it!

WOW! This was quick, EASY and turned out beautiful. Cabbage still had some crunch and was a beautiful green color on the plate. Not like my usual mushy "boiled in the pot" stuff. I used Irish butter which gave a tad more flavor. I served a party of 8 - all had clean plates when it was over! I would think you could use "pot liquor" from the corned beef instead of water if you wanted the flavor....

This and Stir-Fried Cabbage with Green Onions by Susan Bishop-Sauter, also on epicurious, have changed my taste-buds toward cabbage! Next time I make this I'll probably use less butter and more pepper, maybe a bit of vinegar would go well too. I got comments at the table like "It's too good to be healthy!" I plan to make it again.

I saw this type of cappage mixed into mashed potatoes has anyone tried it that way?

I didn't have savoy cabbage so I just tried it with regular green cabbage. I thought it was GREAT!

This was simple and delicious, a tender, buttery way to prepare any greens. I used 1/2 a cabbage and 1 bunch chard, and only 1 tbsp butter at the beginning and 1 tbsp at the end, and it came out great. Even my 4 year old son told me (without coercion) that he liked it and finished his full helping!

...love and butter. I agree that fresh ground pepper is a great addition.

It is what it is, a very simple cabbage recipe and also a very good one. Simple cabbage taste, quick and convenient to make. I will be making it regularly as a side. St. Patrick's day will be here soon and I will make this then as a side for the corned beef. I think regular white cabbage could probably be substituted in this recipe if one wanted to.

i really liked this. i hate boiled cabbage so i was skeptical but this was great. I made a few changes: i fried up some bacon in the pan, then removed the bacon and most of the fat before i added the butter and cabbage. rather than water i used chicken stock. i braised it for about 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally,then added back in the bacon. very very good--in fact that was my main course! this is a cheap, easy,and tasty meal.

This is easily one of the most delicious, simple, and economical sides I've ever made! My fiance never eats cabbage, but after this, it looks like I'm not going to make as much sauerkraut as I thought...

Good stuff! Really easy, and I like "fried" cabbage because it retains a little more crunch and color than boiling. I used around 2 Tbsp. of butter overall, and it was fine.

Surprisingly good and simple! I used a soy bean oil spread instead of butter and it was really delicious. Think it would be great as a bed for serving grilled fish.

I cooked it a tad longer than called for and omitted the final pat of butter, and it was delicious. We'll see if the kiddo eats it.

Fast and Fabulous! We're already cabbage lovers, but this is so easy and not over cooked. Delish!

Pretty good! We put the salt and lotsof pepper in with the butter-water mixture and steamed for 60 to 90 seconds.

Yes, a fantastic recipe. Worth trying for the sake of trying something different. I did add more butter than called for and made sure salt and pepper made an impact

I tried this for St. Patrick's Day dinner this year because it looked different and worthy of trying. My wife is the ultimate judge of whether or not I will make something like this again. She has asked that I make cabbage using this recipe from now on. I used a little bit more butter than called for and made sure to taste often to be sure salt and pepper level was okay. We both found it to be mouth watering and delicious. The kids still didn't eat it, but they didn't eat cabbage before hand either. Great, easy, delicious recipe.

I made this tonight based on the reviews that it changed cabbage haters into lovers. It was bland, boring, tasteless. I had family over & usually I experiment with new recipes & we are all pleasantly suprised - but tonight I was embarassed. The only thing that saved it was the fact that cabbage is good for you. I recommend against making this.

This is excellent. Great texture and very flavorful. None of the watery, soggy, mushy stuff you wind up with when you add the cabbage to the corned beef braise. With this recipe, we'll make cabbage a regular part of our vegetable side dish repertoire.

Had to improvise. Recipe was upstairs, I was in the kitchen with corned beef and potatoes ready. Used regular cabbage, put just butter in the skilled, did a quick stir, added more butter, covered with lid for a few more minutes and voila! slightly browned delicious cabbage. My adult son, who until then had shunned the boiled kind, loved it. Thank you Darina! Now I will try the original recipe.
