We LOVE this. I use three pears and multiply the rest of the ingredients by 6. I use lemon flavored olive oil for all but 1-2t. butter and I used either less brown sugar or a stevia replacement. Put plain Greek yogurt on top for a healthy fun breakfast.

This was just OK. I'm not making it again. No wonder it's under the "healthy" recipes. The oats got to me in the end. Too much oats. Now, I'll have to think of what to do with the massive bag I got left...

So yummy as dessert! And perfect amount for one person. Even better with some vanilla ice cream :)

This recipe is perfect especially for dessert! We served it with chocolate sorbet. I like that it's healthy and doesn't weigh you down.

We really really enjoy this recipe. I have changed it around sometimes and just used what I have on hand with regards to fresh or frozen fruit. Blueberries are really good too. Also ran out of oatmeal one day and had to make due with old slightly stale Kashi rice puffs but it turned out really yummy. Family favorite.

Really really enjoy this recipe. I change it around depending on what I have fresh versus frozen. Blueberries are also very good! Also ran out of oatmeal one day so used some old slightly stale Kashi rice puffs and it was really yummy! Family favorite all around.
