Quick and easy to pack, a lovely lunch or late supper. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added cucumber to the salad, left the romaine out until assembling, and added a smear of simple homemade yogurt tahini sauce to give it a little more moisture. Also works well in a wrap.

This was a wonderfully quick recipe that makes for a great light lunch. My only suggestion is to add 3/4 cup of chopped black olives to the recipe. My wife is Greek and she was much happier with the results after I had modified the recipe.

This tastes better as just a salad to me than in the pita bread. I didn't like it that way at all. I think this is ok, but i would not have to have it again.

So quick, so easy!! And made with things I usually have on hand. My fussy in-laws even liked it.

Thanks for a delicious sandwich, which is quick and easy to prepare. I used a whole can of chickpeas, more onion, and a little more olive oil and lemon juice, plus added seasoned pepper, garlic powder, and oregano. I didn't have tapenade, so used Greek Caviar. Romaine wasn't added to the bean mixture - just put in the pitas separately. It was enough filling for 4 pitas (8 halves) and improves with age. We washed it down with Retsina. OPA!

I don't like whole garbanzo beans. Try making hummus instead. And instead of tapenade, just quarter whole black olives lengthwise. Make tahini and pour it over the lettuce, tomato, red onion, olives and teaspoon-size scoops of hummus inside the roasted pita. It makes a rich, filling sandwich.

My family has enjoyed a similar salad for years. I recommend you double the recipe (we use 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1/4 cup olive oil, minced garlic, oregano, marjoram and diced cucumber and green pepper) and hold the lettuce. Can be made ahead for better flavor and lasts 1-2 weeks in the refrigerator. Then serve as is or add lettuce for salad or pita sandwiches as needed. Delicious and easy! I really like the idea of using the tapenade and grilling the pita bread! Give this one a try!
