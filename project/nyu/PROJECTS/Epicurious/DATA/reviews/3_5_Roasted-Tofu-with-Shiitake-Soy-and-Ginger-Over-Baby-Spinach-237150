My husband and I both enjoyed this, served on top of white basmati rice. I used 4 tbsp malt vinegar and 2 tbsp white wine vinegar since I was out of rice vinegar (I don't think this makes any difference). I also used a mix of regular white mushrooms and coffee mushrooms since that was what I had on hand. I think I put too much of the marinade onto the mushrooms, as the tofu was fairly dry and bland, while the mushrooms were drowning in the marinade after the cooking time was up. I suggest mixing the mushrooms after adding the marinade in small amounts and stopping as soon as it starts to accumulate at the bottom of the bowl (I found this was not obvious until you move them around a bit). I especially loved the beautiful colour of the roasted tofu.

This has become, with some changes, one of our go-to healthy, easy and delicious dinners. I start a pot of brown rice and then do the rest while it cooks. I leave out the shiitakes, and steam the spinach instead of leaving it raw. I make the marinade as directed but only half of it, saving the other half for the next time. Simple and great.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. I reduced the oil in half and reduced honey to 2 tbsp after reading some of other reviews. The final product was way too tangy for the whole family. Should have left the honey alone I guess.

This came out great. Ran out of soy sauce so I substituted balsamic vinegar for some of it, but it tasted fantastic. Served with white rice instead of spinach.

Am I the only person that thought this was an awful lot of work to prepare? I seemed to have a lot of different dishes and utensils to clean and different steps to complete. It definitely was tasty, but not incredibly filling.

This was really delicious--even my fiance who isn't a tofu fan loved it. I served it over brown rice and used cremini mushrooms because that's what I had. I used silken tofu that I had in the fridge and drained it and wrapped it in a towel to suck up the moisture. Worked just fine. Extra spice, like sriracha, would be a nice addition. Awesome healthy meal!

Great recipe. I made a few modifications: I didn't have rice wine vinegar so I used 3 TB of apple cider vinegar instead and added a 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to the marinade. I marinated and roasted a large thinly sliced shallot with the mushrooms. Cooked brown basmati rice and spooned over the spinach then topped with the tofu mushroom mixture. Very yummy and healthy and my husband loved it! Will definitely be making this again.

Followed other reviewers' advice, and cut back the oil to 1.5 tablespoons, and used toasted sesame instead of olive oil. Used 1 tb. of honey only, and a mix of portobellos and baby bella mushrooms. Advice here to add some spice (one minced Thai red chili) was well-taken. Used a baking sheet large enough for all the tofu slices to fit and lay flat, and the marinade poured over them ended up burning and blackening the pan. Next time, will pour more of the marinade over the mushrooms, which hold it much better, so it won't burn off and will be left to pour over the finished plate. This made dinner for two just perfectly.

Great recipe! But I made some changes - I used very little oil, portobello mushrooms instead of shiitake and I put half of the spinach in the saute pan just to wilt it a bit.

Delicious, healthy tofu recipe, a welcome change from the standard fried tofu dishes. Next time, I'd use less olive oil, as it seperated from the rest of the marinade while baking, despite whisking, and didn't add much. I also threw in some chopped jalapenos for some added spiciness.

Absolutely delicious. I rarely leave reviews, but this was so good that I felt compelled. I serve it over steamed spinach

The marinade for the tofu is amazing! We sliced the tofu into quarters, and grilled it. It was spectacular! Used extra firm tofu, we found the firm just wasn't firm enough. Also marinated regular mushrooms in the sauce and grilled with the tofu and served it over baby spinach. Have made many times in the past month alone as keep getting asked to make for BBQ's. Have also added chili sauce and sesame oil as well - tastes great with both!

I marinated the tofu overnight which was good, and sauteed the spinach. Served it all with rice, which made a delicious meal.

Easy, fast and healthy. Pretty standard Asian-esque recipe.

This is a delicious, easy, and healthy recipe. I wilted the spinach either by steaming or sauteing. Highly recommended.

This turned out pretty great though I altered it somewhat. I roasted some thinly-sliced carrots and green beans with the mushrooms because they needed to be used. And, I had no spinach so that was out. As per other reviews here, I tasted the sauce as I added ingredients so that I could adjust the sweetness. I also added some hot chili oil (just a few dashes) to give it a bit more of a kick because we like spicy food. Finally, I served it over soba noodles instead of with rice because we were out of rice.

Looks and tastes great. I prefer a little less oil and honey. I think it's nice enough to serve to guests.

I used baby bella mushrooms and they were terrific. I think the tofu needs to be dried in a couple of changes of paper towels to get it good and dry before roasting. I used a hotter oven -- around 400. This was best cold over the spinach with some grated carrots for color
