Pretty good. I was looking for a recipe that would use up the massive amount of arugula in my garden. I ate it warm because I'm not a huge fan of cold soup. That being said, it was a little bland. Next time, I think I'm going to marinate the tomatoes in a little bit of basil oil and then sprinkle that on top of the soup. I think it might give it some added interest.

Good. Just wish I hadn't oversalted it, which is easy to do when salting something that is hot but will be served chilled.

A little cream goes a long way-- and it wasn't even cream! We used fat-free half-and-half, which produced a rich and flavorful soup. I was amazed at how quick this was to prepare. We skipped the croutons, forgot the tomato garnish, substituted spinach and watercress for the arugula, and chilled the soup in the freezer instead of submerging the bowl in ice. Despite all the corner-cutting, the result was still delicious. I had to resist taking a second helping to save room for the rest of my dinner. My one suggestion would be to add a tiny bit more potato to make it thicker.

My boyfriend loves Arugula, so I made this as a surprise. He loved it! I doubled the recipe and served it hot, as a light supper with toasted peasant bread, Carrots Vichy and Chardonnay. I substituted evaporated milk for the cream, and mushroom broth from a company called Star for the chicken broth. Be sure to chop the Arugula before before cooking, otherwise it'll get tangled in the blades of the blender.
