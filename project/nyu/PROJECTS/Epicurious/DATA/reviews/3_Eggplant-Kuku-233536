this is not supposed to be a souffle it is supposed to be kuku and even though the eggplant is unexpected and a bit untraditional (and you must account for a difference in consistency and for other things) it works very well

Bland - too eggy for a souffle. I made the suggestions of the others, a little more cheese, a little tumeric and 1 extra garlic clove. It just tasted meh. Too bad.

I took a prior reviewer's advice and added some tumeric (1/2 tsp) and some nutmeg (1/4 tsp). I also increased the garlic to about three cloves. It was delicious and I would definitely make it again.

I made a 2/3 batch (4 eggs, 1 lb eggplant, etc.) and filled two two-cup souffle dishes, which would make a nice light supper or large first course or side. I thought it was very good but would consider making the aromatic additions suggested next time to punch up the flavor.

AMAZING! My dinner guests apparently raved about it, because I heard about how delicious it was from people who weren't at my dinner! note: I double the garlic in ALL recipes and did here, too...

nutmeg would work better than cinamon in a soufflé

This recipe, as posted here, is flawed. No Iranian dish is complete without turmeric to balance out the eggy aftertaste, and a hint of saffron to add color and aroma. Just dissolve a couple of saffron flakes in 1/3 cup boiling water and add it to the mixture. I personally cut down on lime juice and serve these with fresh basil on the side (or you could add a little bit to the mixture) and the combination is wonderful. If you do not have access to saffron, add a little bit of cinnamon. Not the same thing, but it does make it aromatic. My other personal touch is adding a handful of sundried tomatoes. Try it and you will be very very pleased!

Don't get me wrong; I love egglant, I love souffles. But the two shan't meet in my kitchen again. At least not in this form. Unfortunately, this recipe reminded me of overly laborious baby food. And I so much WANTED to like it! Oh well.

This is a great recipe: flavorful and easy. Because eggplant is a bit bland, I doubled the lemon juice, garlic, and cheese. I also roasted the eggplant about twice as long, so that it would be more flavorful.

The person who said, "Grey, unappetizing, mushy concoction" was absolutely right. What a waste of time.

This was super. I almost didn't make it, given the previous boos! Here is the secret, I think. The eggplant must brown a bit in the oven. I used smaller eggplants (roughly 1/2 lb each) and placed them face down on a cast-iron plate with a little olive oil. They had a nice grilled look. And freshly grated, aged parmesan is absolutely necessary. I would make these for hors d'eaurves for a dinner party, they were that tasty and succulent.

I added 1pound of ground beef (fried with tomato paste) into the mixture. It was one of the best dishes I had in a long time.

Funny and unremarkable. It tastes a little of lemon and otherwise has very light flavors. If you're dying for an eggplant souffle this will do, but otherwise I'd tend toward other recipes.

Grey, unappetizing, mushy concotion. Normally, I like eggplant and souffles. This was a disappointing waste.

light, fluffy, lemon-garlic flavor. Very nice. I might add some fresh herbs next time. Not really sure if I will make it again or not - only because I found so many other great eggplant recipes on this site!

I made this for some friends last night and it was exceptionally easy and delicious! I had to roast the eggplant longer than suggested, but that might have just been my oven.

I made this for my New Years Eve party as a dip/spread. Everyone went "ku ku" for it.

Wow, what a wonderful use of eggplant! I made this for dinner as a side dish, along with a morrocan chicken and couscous dish, and it far outshined the chicken. The recipe neglects to mention that the dish should be cooked until completely set, and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. I also used a blend of preshredded asiago, romano & parmesan cheeses, and prepared garlic. I think next time I will use fresh garlic or add a bit more, as my family are garlic lovers. Delicious!
