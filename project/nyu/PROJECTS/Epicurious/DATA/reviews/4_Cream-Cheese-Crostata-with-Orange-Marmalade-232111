Liked substituting about 1/3 of flour with almond meal (Trader Joes). Was really easy to push the room temp pastry dough around in the tart pan by using the bottom of a 1cup measuring cup on top of a piece of plastic wrap covering the dough. Definitely splurge and use Seville orange marmalade--read the label to be sure. It really makes a big flavor difference. Also liked decorating the top with canned mandarin segments (under the marmalade glaze) --- brightens the tart.

This was delicious and a big hit at Christmas dinner. Followed the recipe exactly except for adding a bit of ice water to the dough and adding some lemon zest to the orange marmalade, as other reviewers suggested. Since I hate to roll dough, I loved the press-in flaky crust as a change from usual cookie crumb press-in crusts. Also loved that it could be made in advance. This is definitely a keeper.

I've made this dessert a few times now....even won a competition prize for the "best tasting dessert" with it! Last time I made it, I 'tweaked' it - instead of the pastry crust I prepared a crumb crust which, on the day, was quicker and easier. I also arranged two small cans of drained mandarin oranges, overlapping, on top of the marmalade. It was a great hit, and I know I'll be making it many more times in the future. Great favorite with all who have tasted and enjoyed it!

Love the flavors-do not substitute for the orange marmalade as that is what makes it. Very easy and great for spring or summer. I used store bought crust which was good.

Yes, this is easy and looks great, but I agree with former reviews about the crust-You need to add about 2 T. of ice water to this to get it to stay together, with that addition, crust was flaky and very good. Would also agree with previous comment to add lemon to the orange marm. It will produce a milder citrus. I microwaved mine to allow it to thin slightly before spreading onto the cream filling.

Really wonderful -- rich and elegant and EASY! This would be really difficult to mess up (though I did turn the almonds to ash one time as I was toasting them!). Great when you need something special, but don't have time to fuss. Plus, since it's so rich you can slice small and it goes a long way.

I made it with a store bought pie crust. It was very delicious. It was so creamy and rich that I would definitely love to make it again.

Delicious. I almost felt guilty it was so easy. I used a graham cracker crust instead of the crust listed. Many rave reviews from friends. Presentation is professional looking.

Excellent. I have made this several times now and eventually altered it to include 1/3 cup toasted almonds, chopped very fine in the crust and adding about 1-2 tbls lemon juice to the marmalade.

Everyone raved. Made according to the recipe with two exceptions: I used the whole egg yolk in the crust and made it in the food processor.

Very simple and quite good. Made it for my brother, who loves cherries, so I used cherry preserves instead of orange marmalade. I think I'd like the orange better, but he loved the cherry. Only comment is that the half an egg yolk wasn't nearly enough to pull the dough together. I've made a lot of dough, and they always use ice water or milk/cream in addition. So I added 1 or 2 T of milk to get it to hold, which worked great. And this also tasted great if left in the freezer for a bit to harden a little more.

This is a delicious and elegant yet easy to make dessert. Living above 5000 ft I had to add approx. 1 T of water to the dough in order to get the crust to come together. Otherwise I prepared the recipe as written. Wonderful recipe with many topping possibilities.

A hit at Thanksgiving! Impresive, simple, easy and delicious (not too sweet or rich). Didn't want to bother with the crust, made a classic graham cracker crust instead (baked). Also added fresh rasberries giving it an eclectic flavor for those sophisticated and discerning palates. Great classic torte recipe where any combination of fruit/topping would work. Just let your imagination run wild!

Fabulous and easy! The tart/ bitter taste of the marmalade really compliments the sweet marscapone filling. It was a big hit at my dinner party; I will certainly make this again.

Absolutely delicious and can be done in no time, The best part is that it can be made as a last minute type of dessert and it takes only few ingredients. My guests raved about this fabulous dessert. Very elegant as well. I used marinated kumquats to decorate and reduced the syrup to glaze the tart.

Unbelievably good. Surprisingly simple to make given it's fancy appearance. CRUST - I added a dash of cinnamon and reduced the butter to ~6 tsp. It had a nice sandy consistency. FILLING - I added a dash of amaretto, and reduced the sugar to ~1/3 per above recommendation. You couldn't really feel the amaretto so I think next time I'd add more or skip it. GLAZE - I used apricot jam instead, and incorporated a couple of sliced figs to the top, spreading chopped almonds around the edge. It looked very professional and tasted GREAT.

Can good be made better? Yes. Made the first time exactly as written. Good, but not great. Made a second time, reducing sugar in the filling to 1/3 cup and adding 1/4 tsp. vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg. Delicious. Next time around will try using 1/2 cp sugar and vanilla and nutmeg. Then I will have the ultimate answer. Easy to make and most impressive.

Ok, i can really only rate the filling b/c i altered everything else! I accidentally bought apricot preserves so i made a glaze(got the recipe here!) and spread that over the filling, then i cut fresh apricots into wedges and covered the crostada with them and then spread the rest of the glaze over that and sprinkled with toasted almonds! I made it for a dessert competition and won!! The filling is amazing!! I think strawberries on top would be mouth watering as well!

Absolutely delicious. The marmalade makes it. I would definately add a little half and half to lighten the filling.

This was absolutely delicious. I brought it to friends as my contribution to the meal and everyone loved. I have already made it again. I used low fat cream cheese and it was still very rich.

This was one of the best desserts I have made in a long time. It was time consuming, but no more so than any other tart. I added a bit of cream to the tart dough to make it a bit less dry and more workable, and I added a touch of almond extract to the filling. It looked and tasted terrific.

This is a gorgeous dessert, easy to make, and absolutely devine! I added extra toasted sliced almonds, and the second time I made it I added 2 Tablespoons of Half & Half to the dough to moisten it. I have already received requests to make it again---- Soon.

Have made this twice now, excellent combination of cream/tart. Crust: Came out tough, likely because all butter. Filling/marmalade: Delicious! Low-fat cream cheese worked great, less sugar too only 1/3 cup, addition of zest/juice of a lemon, 1/2 c marmalade was plenty esp warmed a bit to spread more easily. This is a keeper!
