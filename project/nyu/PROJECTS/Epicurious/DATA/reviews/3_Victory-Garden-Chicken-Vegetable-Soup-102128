I chose this recipe because it has so many fresh vegetables and doesn't have a bunch of spices to cover up the flavor. Followed the recipe exactly and love it. I did add more fresh basil to each bowl of soup I reheated. Bland? Not to me. I'll make this again and again. Thank you!

We used much more chicken than the recipe called for. Also, I only had white potatoes around, so we used those too. We tasted it and decided it needed more spice, so we added marjoram, thyme and tarragon. It was nice. Will make again.

I like this soup, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that it is a little bit bland. Next time I'll add some herbs to the stock while it simmers, and I'll maybe sautee some more of the veggies with the onions in order to impart a little more flavor. The soup needs a lot more salt than the recipe calls for, but the soup (as most soups do) gets better with age.

I loved this recipe. Tasted great when I was feeling under the weather. I did not use an entire chicken. I just boiled 5 chicken breasts in chicken broth. Also, great with some garlic.

I left out the corn and added celery. The taste is subtle - I've been ruined by years of super-salty Campbell's!

The flavor of the broth is subtle, especially if you are accustomed to more intensely flavored commercial chicken broths. My 2 picky children love this soup- its the ultimate comfort soup but with veggies! I rarely plan ahead so I usually use a fat separator to remove most of the fat from the hot broth as I cook the onions. Don't brown the onions- the brown color is unpleasant in the soup-cook until translucent. Follow the suggested cooking times or else everything gets mushy.

I liked it a lot but it needs some pepper or Tabasco or something.

In spite of all the wonderful ingredients my husband and I didn't find this recipe to be very flavorful. I lacks spice.

I used about only a cup of cooked chicken, and it was plenty. All four members of our family enjoyed this recipe.
