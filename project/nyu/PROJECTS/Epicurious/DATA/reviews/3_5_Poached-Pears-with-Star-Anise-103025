So simple yet so tasty. Per other reviewers' suggestions, I cut down the sugar to about 1/4 C (maybe a bit more) and it came out just right. With less sugar I had to reduce the port a lot more to get it to the right consistency, but there was still plenty of sauce to go around. Served with mascarpone cheese instead of ice cream.

beautiful but yes too sweet. i will cut some sugar next time. be warned also the recipe feeds a lot. half would be great for a family of four.

Delicious, but too sweet. I will try it again with less sugar. I also used Asian pear for a firmer result. Instead of ice cream, I added a little bit of the syrup (you don't need much as it is very sweet) to mascarpone, and it made a really nice topping.

I've made this several times before, it's very easy and delicious. I love the anise flavor.

Forgot to mention...This is an excellent recipe to make in advance. I followed the recipe, chilled the pears, reserving the sauce. Before serving, I reduced to the sauce to syrup. Yummy, yummy!

I made this for a family dinner...rave reviews! Instead of cutting the pears in half, I poached the whole pear, cooked them a little longer, and fanned them on the plate. I agree with the other reviewer that it is a sweet dessert, but no one at my dinner party complained!

this had a nice flavor, but was WAY too sweet.

The sauce was outstanding and this what made the whole dish. Note to choose pears that are not too firm. I used very firm Anjou pears and they got softened only after an hour.

The vanilla ice cream on the side made this a beautiful ending to an evening with friends.

Delicious and easy. Double the recipe because you'll eat more than one pear yourself.
