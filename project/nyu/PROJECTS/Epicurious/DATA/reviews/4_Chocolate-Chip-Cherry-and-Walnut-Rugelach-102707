These cookies are my family's favourite. I follow the dough recipe as is but I have tried substitutions in the filling. My preferred combo is toasted pecans instead of walnuts and milk chocolate instead of semisweet. Amazing every time.

I have been making these for 7-8 years and they are a favorite at holiday time in our family. Go easy on the filling as what leaks out tends to burn. Line the cookie sheet as the burned or thickened jelly is a mess to clean. You can really fill these with any flavor jam & nut. I like them with almonds & apricot jam. Best within a day or two of baking.

This has turned into holiday tradition to make with my granddaughter. It is easy to substitute any kind of filling you want. She and her friend (10 years old this year) made their batch with raspberry fruit spread and mini chocolate chips. I used a pear fruit spread with chopped dried apricots and chopped toasted almonds. Both were good quality French spreads. It is messy and I did have to resist the urge to "fix" their cookies, but didn't and they were delicious. Like others I only bake for about 25 min.

This was really good, but I did as proposed in the epi-blog and used the dough from this recipe http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/109475 and made them in rolls. I didn't put in the chips and they weren't any worse for it. I wonder how they would be with dates or figs?

I have never made or eaten rugelach before I made this, so call me biased, but it was delicious! The dough rolled well and didn't dry out either. All in all, this was great.

I found this recipe to be excellent and easy. I used the dough recipe, but completely changed the fillings since my children and I wanted a choc, chip and apricot (only) rugelach. I prepared the rugelach, chilled it, rolled it out, sprinkled cocoa powder, sugar, then choc. chips. Do not over do them. Then I rolled the triangles, brushed the egg wash and sprinkled more sugar. I left it assembled in the freezer for at least 30 minutes before baking. For the apricot. I used a high end preserve and sprinkled sugar the same way. Everyone was impressed and asked for the recipe. I also tried it rolled -the traditional way and the triangles were more crusty and flaky. The overall preference for sure.

It took a longer time than expected to make the dough, but then again it could just be me being slow :) But it was worth the time b/c it was the highlight of the night!! I received a great reviews on this sweet dessert. I would suggest using different fillings if you want to try something different from just chocolate, cherry, and walnut. You can basically substitute any nut for walnut and any jam/jelly for cherry. Give it a try :)

Everyone loves this recipe. I used frozen berries instead of cherries. It's easier to premix all the filling then spoon on and spread with back of spoon. For Aussies: 2 sticks of butter = 250 g or 1 block, 6 oz cream cheese = 190g ricotta works just as well, Preserve = Jam

The pastries came out awesome but the dough was very difficult to work with. I find that a sour cream dough is much easier to work with when making rugelach. Next time I will adapt the filling to my rugelach recipe.

I make this cookies every Christmas. They're always a favorite. I use hazelnuts instead of walnuts.

Oh. My. GAWD. We bit into these and heard angels singing! Turned out as good as pastries from a New York deli. Lots of work but definitely worth the effort. Messy! Next time I will roll out dough in large rectangle (vs. circle) and slice into rectangles (vs. triangles) and roll up so filling won't ooze as much. Decadant!

This is the best rgelach recipe I've ever made. I left out the nuts and the whipping cream glaze and they were amazing! Used cherry-flavoured dried cranberries instead. As previous reviewers suggested, i froze them a couple days ahead of time and then popped them into the oven before the party. The house smelled amazing and they were warm and delicious. Only needed 23 minutes in the oven.

These are my most requested cookies. Messy to make, but worth it. Have tried shaping into logs to bake. Still working on it.

Okay...made these today. WOW! My bro-in-law (who isn't a sweets eater) had to go back for more. The flavors are excellent together. I don't mind that the filling oozes out...after all that's what rugelach looks like. Even the photo at the top of the page shows that. I did, however, take a tip from mmmpie and applied the filling in a sort of "ring" so that the middle didn't have any. What happens is that the filling gets sort of mushed toward the center when you roll them up. GREAT cookie...will make again and again.

This was a hit over Thanksgiving. I agree that it's a little messy when making, and I had to watch the cooking time - they cooked in about 25 minutes. Even though forming them into cresents was messy, I was surprised at how almost none of the filling came out in the end. I think I will try forming them into logs as another reviewer suggested just to try something new.

This is the only rugelach recipe that I've tried and I must say it's been a hit with everyone that has them. I always get that whole "oh my goodness I never knew you were jewish" bit eventhough I am far from it LOL. Anyway here is my only complaint and my lil remedy. As you may or may not have already read, the filling can be very messy to deal with. I found it works for me to mix all of the filling ingredients in a bowl first, roll out the dough ad slice it in wedges and then spoon the filling on to the centers of the wedges leaving enough room to create a kind of seal where the filling doesnt ooze out as its being baked... it's a lot neater, and you won't have all this precious filling going to waste... Next time I make them I am going to roll them out as logs, making 3/4" slits 1" apart bake it and then finish cutting through the dough after it comes out of the oven as suggested in the "Rugelach" recipe on this site... Good Luck and enjoy!!!

These rugelach were delicious and our Hanukah guests agreed -- especially one woman whose father owned a bakery! Definitely watch them after 20 minutes in the oven -- these were perfectly golden brown in about 25. I discovered that if you apply the fillings in a doughnut shaped manner (leaving a small unfilled area in the center of each dough round) the wrapped tips don't ooze as much and look neater. These are bound to become a yearly tradition.

The whole trick to making this is to use a good quality jam. I used both an Israelie brand and a Swiss brand. The Israelie jam oozed out and was disgusting as it oozed all over the pastry as well. The Swiss brand remained stable and it didn't I didn't bother with the freezing process. After checking with my Joy of Cooking, they confirmed the importance of the jam and they suggested that you find a jam with the first two ingrediants listed as cherries and sugar.

This was very good but why make them in cresents? I rolled them into a log and sliced them into "ovals" as I am too lazy and they fit much better on the plate.

As another cook suggested, I sprinkled the cinnasugar mixture on top of the cookies before baking. They were done after 23 minutes on 375. They didn't *look* done, like they weren't brown, but they were actually perfectly crisp, light, and fluffy when cooled. I always use Plugra butter and this time, non-sour dried cherries which worked fine. This is the third year I've made these and they're always a hit. Oh yeah, and don't skip the freezing part, it prevents the cookies from oozing while baking!

I used the filling from this recipe (but substituted chopped bittersweet chocolate for the semisweet chips) and the dough from the "Polish Rugelach" recipe. In addition to brushing the tops with heavy cream, I also sprinkled with cinammon-sugar. I only had to bake for 25 minutes at 350. The cookies were a hit and actually not that time-consuming, as rugelach recipes go. I also made some with apricot preserves, chopped almonds, and chocolate, which were also yummy.

I made this without the nuts and could not find sour cherries so I used dried bing cherries and cut them into choc. chip size pieces (as another reviewer suggested chopping them smaller.) I used a 12 oz. jar of cherrie preserves and did not fill the pie shaped wedges with as much as the recipe suggested. I made another batch two days later. They really are very good! PS it did not take 40 minutes but more like 30 in my oven.

I was not impressed at all. The dough had no flavor and did not taste like a rugelach at all.

This is the second year I've made this recipe. Here's what I did: Used 2 T preserves, not 3. When spreading preserves on dough, I used a spoon to push the bulky cherries away from the center of the circle. I also sprinkled the dried cherries, choco chips, and most of the walnuts in a ring, avoiding the center. This way, you avoid the messy spill when rolling.The sugar I sprinkled everywhere. I chopped the cherries into itty bitty pieces, and very finely chopped the walnuts. Easier to roll. I think I baked the cookies for about 22-23 minutes. They taste better slightly soft than overdone. I also used a Silpat! And do *not* overstuff these bad boys. These are so good. :-9... Boyfriend and family love them.

I have made this recipe for rugelach for years, and these are a hit! Not being Jewish, I had never baked these before, but wanted to do something nice for my Jewish neighbor. Every rugelach recipe I have I got from this website, and these are always the first to go! I wasn't phased in the least when it came to preparing them, but I read the recipe MANY times and knew that it would be quite hair raising. I proceeded anyway, and man was it worth it! I have already purchased my cream cheese for these delicacies, and will be making them next week!

Rating: 4
These were much better than the rugelach I grew up eating in NYC! I made the rugelach in stages: I prepared the dough (in a Kitchenaid) one evening, I assembled and refrigerated them the next evening, and baked them following morning. While the first tray baked, I froze the second tray as suggested in the recipe. I found no significant difference in "oozing" between the refrigerated and frozen batches. I also doubled up the baking trays to ensure that the bottoms did not brown too quickly. 20-21 minutes is just the right amount of baking time.

The taste was great, but what a mess! There was too much filling and it oozed out all over the pan to make one big gooey mess.

These were the hit cookies of the holidays! I substituted Tofutti cream cheese, Sucanat for the sugar and Evaporated Goat's milk (Meyenburg) for the whipping cream. This one is going to be made every year from now on! And I think it will do well with other preserves combinations too.

YUM!! These cookies are SO incredibly good and not too hard (a little lengthy, but worth it). I made a plate of these last Hanukkah for my boyfriend, and I had to beat my family off with a stick to keep them from stealing all of them before I gave them to him. His family served them at a large luncheon and many people there said it was the best rugelach they'd ever had! Considering that I was the only goy in the room, that was a compliment. :-)

These were a big hit at a recent party. Everyone loved them. Personally, I prefer more traditional rugelach with apricot preserves, cinnamon sugar and raisins. However, if you like chocolate rugelach, these are a good choice.

These are truly incredible. I have now made them 3 Christmases in a row, and everyone now expects them each year. I have to freeze some for my family before friends and neighbors gobble them up! Don't overcomplicate the recipe and you won't have a problem. DO use parchment paper and spray it with Pam. DO NOT overstuff the rugelach (use about 2 TBSP of each filling ingredient) and DO only bake them for about 25 minutes. You will get absolute RAVE reviews and great results!

This is going to be my third or fourth year making these cookies; they've become a Hanukkah tradition. To be blunt: I adore this recipe. I am going to try the KitchenAid mixer idea over the food processor, so the three-year-old can be more involved in the cooking. And has anyone tried apricot preserves and dried apricots as filling? Might need to play around this year.

Rating: 0
in this recipe there was no mention that the chocolate would melt after cooking, the cherry preserves would ooze. in short, it was a serious mess and very difficult to remove from the pan. it was somewhat easier when i removed absolutely immediately but i still broke several cookies and had to throw out some. they were tasty but not worth it as one doesnt want to discard much of a holiday treat.

WOW! I've been making this recipe for years and was dismayed to see that recent reviewers have not been pleased. As someone who bakes 256 rugelach every Hanukkah/Christmas, I can assure you that this is one of the BEST rugelach recipes out there...with 2 notes. The baking time is quite overstated.....25+ minutes works for me; and the amount of filling listed will result in significant oozing, so scale it down a bit. My preference is to roll into a rectangle rather than a circle, but both work fine. Everyone I know LOVES these rugelach...even my Jewish motherin-law (which is saying something!). If you're still not sure, scroll down to the earlier reviews where you'll find that almost everyone was pleased.

I am not Jewish but I am a professional baker whose "mainstay" is rugalach! I, living in Northern California, have been told many times that my rugalach is the best this side of NYC and my family is a great fan of it. I have also been asked by our local Jewish Friendship Center to provide it for their functions. I have found in my many years of baking it that the favorites are spread with raspberry or apricot jam and filled with sugar, cinnamon and ground walnuts. I have not found it useful to refrigerate the dough for hours....I make it with my KitchenAide and start rolling right away, keeping the remaining dough covered. Once rolled, it is dredged in cinnamon sugar and placed on foil lined cookie sheets...the Silpat liners are great too, as mentioned but still, you have to wash them! As with most things, rugalach is best consumed within 3 days...it really loses it's goodness after that though some love it so much they try to "make it last" as long as they can! Also, I use currants but have used cherries or craisins when in a pinch. To my understanding, currants are the traditional fruit used but I like the others as well. Sugar and salt in the dough is unnecessary as is the cream after rolling....it's fattening enough!!!! and comes out flaky and melt in your mouth good as is! Happy Holidays to all.

The rugelach turns out nicely if you use the jelly roll/snake method described previously. I baked them for about 40 minutes with a careful eye. After baking I immediately transferred the four rolls to cooling racks and let them cool about 4 hours. Then I sliced about 1 inch pieces. Also, I used my KitchenAid mixer to make the dough & I worked with each dough disk straight from the fridge. Overall I didn't find this recipe too time consuming and there's a lot of down time that I found convienent.

The third try with this recipe was the charm. I made the recipe twice during Hannukah, and although I made several mistakes and the recipe seemed laborious, they were so tasty. On the third preparation, (for Christmas Eve festivities), I was a pro. My husband loved going through all of the holidays with this little recipe. I skipped using my food processor and made the dough in my KitchenAid mixer. It was easier and had a great texture. For this third time with the recipe I ran out of dried cherries and used Craisins (dried cranberries) instead. I also tried ran out of cherry jam and tried two from my fridge: blackberry port and raspberry. The results were still wonderful. This is a recipe that can have a lot of variations and still be great! And, yes, only 20-21 minutes to cook.

They taste so much better than they look. I thought the dough was hard to work with, but loved the end result. chocolate and cherry make a great combo.

These cookies tasted delicious, but where a total pain in the butt to make. They were time consuming and messy. I do have one tip, which is to use a silt pad for baking. It worked great, and the cookies didn't burn - I cooked them for 21 minutes. In the future I will enjoy the store-bought variety.

I enjoyed making this recipe for my family for Chanukah. I cannot wait to make them again. I rolled out the last batches of dough to 8" rounds which I found easier to work with than 9" rounds. Also, I kept each disk refrigerated until I was ready to work with the dough. If the dough is too soft, simply refrigerate for a few minutes.I also reduced baking time to 20-28 min. Watch the cookies closely around 21 min. I checked the ruggies every minute after 21 minutes had elapsed and removed the batch when the cookies were lightly golden (around 27 min cooking time). I also cut the preserves to 2-21/2 T instead of 3T. Remove from parchment immediately to prevent sticking or use a silpat. I sprinkled the cookies LIGHTLY with cinnamon sugar mixture after the cream is brushed on top. This recipe impressed everyone. They make a wonderful warm cozy presentation and this was the first dessert to disappear from the buffet, even beating out cheesecake & brownies.

Even though this recipe takes some time (and patience) it is well worth the effort! Everyone raved about the rugelach and they were already excited for me to make another batch. The only thing I had difficulty with was once I cut the pizza-shaped pieces, a lot of the filling tended to fall out on my first batch. So in the subsequent batches, I rolled out the dough in a long horizontal snake shape. After I places the filling in the center (and left 1 inch above and below), I folded in the dough and baked the entire "snake" or rugelach as a single loaf. When it cooled, I cut the loaf into separate rugelach and it looked more like the store-bought treats we're used to.

I have just finished this batch plus the L. Brody recipe from this site. Both are terrific, but I would have to say that this dough/crust is much easier to work with and looks better when done. I even switched fillings and dough & preferred this one still. I cut them all in 10ths,which I think is easier to eat, and they baked just the same...no longer than 20-25 min. Of course they are delicious just baked, but I am freezing them based on previous ideas. If it doesn't work I'll let you all know! Enjoy!

We made 5 of the 6 rugelach recipes on this site. Yum, chocolate chips always are a nice touch :) I'm glad this recipe started with dry ingredients, then cut in the butter/cream cheese; the process worked very well. The Date Walnut Rugelach recipe did it the other way around, and what a huge, frustrating mess! As for the filling, I thought the amounts were just fine. I also understand why this rugelach recipe, unlike the others on this site, requires freezing. The rugelach spread quite a lot once baked.

I haven't made this particular rugelach recipe, but I've made a few that are very similar. To keep the rugelach from burning on the bottom before they are finished cooking through and golden on top, bake them on two stacked heavy duty baking sheets. I still never bake any rugelach recipe for 45 minutes, but I think that using this method with the two baking sheets ensures that you won't be getting any charcoal bottoms even if you did bake for that long! Also, baking on a Silpat works great for oozy cookies like these. Just my 2 cents!

Rating: 3
The baking time indicated in the recipe is too long. Twenty-five minutes (or less) should suffice (mine were burning at 36 minutes). The cookies are excellent and everyone likes them. However, they are time-consuming and I'm not sure they're worth the trouble.

Rating: 4
I consider myself a bit of an expert on this recipe having made it four times in the last week! The freezing is very important (as I learned when I was in a rush and didn't freeze the rolled cookies for the full 30 minutes). The freezing keeps the shape of the cookies and minimizes the "ooze" factor. These cookies are great! Taste fabulous, look fantastic, and aren't difficult to make. I would make up the dough one night and roll and bake the next.

This rugelach was to much trouble..the filling was good but look for another rugelach cookie recipe...one that is easier to make and that doesn't require you to freeze the cookie just before baking..I made to rugelach recipes this Christmas and this was definitely the lesser of the two.

These tasted fantastic! The only problem I had was with too much filling. I agree with changing the jam or preserves *I used raspberry jam* to 2 TBS instead of 3. I did something different on one of the batches though, just to test. I rolled out the section of dough into a 9-inch square, instead of a 9-inch circle. I rolled the square up tightly into a cylinder, then cut 8 equal pieces from the roll. This way I was able to enclose the filling into little pouches, making it less messy, plus, holding the filling in much better! I barely lost any onto the sheet. I used "If You Care" unbleached, silicone coated parchment paper, *which is also recycled :)* AND NOTHING EVER STICKS TO IT, even the jam/sugar ooze from the crescent rugelachs! I agree with lessening the baking time. 30 minutes tops. I will be making these over and over and over, as they disappear in a snap! They taste Oh soo good, better than bakery rugelach! Try different variations too, like apricot, or any other fav jam, preserve, and dried fruit. Also try sprinkling some cinnamon-sugar on top of the rugelach after applying the cream, right before baking. It gives it an extra crunchy caramelized top. Happy Baking! *S*

They looked just like the picture, except when turned over: charcoal black w/ pieces of burnt paper. Tip 1: oven time should be 20min MAX. Forgot the tart cherries, so had to improvise. Tip 2: try chopped raisins soaked in whiskey. Used reg chips, but de choco overpowered the other flavors. Tip 3: Stick with minis. Listen, they were my first cookies baked from something other than a box with a doughboy on it. Plus, it's my first review ever. So yes, TRY THIS.

I followed the recommendations of previous reviewers and only used 2T. preserves per 1/4 recipe (as well as Craisins instead of cherries).

Will make these again and again; may try apricot preserve and dried apricots w/ the chocolate next time.

Absolutely delicious... my favorite of all the cookies I made this year... they will definitely become one of my holiday cookie traditions. The recommended baking time of 40 min, however, is far too long. I took the first batch out after 30 minutes and found that the filling had bubbled out and nearly burned (even on an Airbake cookie sheet). The second batch I baked for twenty minutes and they were just right. Wonderful, fabulous cookies... do try them (they're easier than they look).
