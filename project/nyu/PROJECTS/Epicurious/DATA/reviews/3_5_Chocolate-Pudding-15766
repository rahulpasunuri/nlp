A very easy recepie to follow and fail proof! I chose to use Lindt Excellence 99% Cocoa bars.....SIMPLY DELICIOUS! I will indulge often!

Yummy! but a little too much cornstarch! I used unsweetened chocolate accidentally but the sweetness level was perfect. It was too thick so I added more milk so I could cook the full minute. Still it was slightly too corn-starchy for my taste. I will use only 1 tablespoon next time and 2 egg yolks instead. There was a skin on top despite covering in plastic wrap. I will put the plastic wrap directly on the pudding surface surface next time. I serve this topped with whipped cream, shortbread cookies and raspberries and everyone thinks I slaved all day!

No bittersweet so used semisweet and reduced the sugar...perfect. I've tried it with evaporated milk (diluted) as well....works just as well!

I have made this recipe more times than I can count. It is one of the best chocolate pudding recipes that I have found. The best is to top it with homemade cinnamon whip cream. So good and very easy to make.

During Snowpocolypse February 2010 in Washington DC area I invited neighbors in for impromptu dinner with what I had in the frig. Dessert was problematic but this tasty little pudding was a perfect end to our wintry repast and all the ingredients were available in my pantry or refrigerator. Sweet, chocolaty and smooth it was comfort food easily made and quickly enjoyed.

Have made this twice, and it is a little sweet, but that works really well in our home... I love that it's super quick and easy, and makes a nice treat for my daughter in a pinch...

I make this all the time (soo good and so easy), but increase the milk to 1-1/2 cups and decrease the chocolate to 3.5 ounces. It makes four perfect servings--as written, the recipe is too much per person and a bit too rich, IMO. As others have said, the recipe calls for BITTERSWEET chocolate, which is less sweet than semisweet. If you use semisweet chocolate, you will need to reduce the sugar.

Yeah, this was good. Easy. But very, very rich. Some people liked that, some people couldn't eat much. Everyone was tempted. I used a very high quality chocolate that I had lying around. Make with lactose-free milk and even your lactose-intolerant friends can enjoy that mousse-like dessert they've been missing!

Incredibly delicious. This is thick, rich an creamy, like the best brownie batter or molten chocolate you've ever had. This is a keeper.

Oh right, and it served four - two soup spoons each is more than enough.

Sinfully rich! Followed the recipe exactly except I checked a couple of reviews after I started and decided to up the milk/yolk combo by about 1/2 to offset the sugar - except I used whipping cream. Used very fine, very dark 85% green and blacks organic and some other fine chocolate I have lying around from a 'chocolate tasting' event. It was very thick, very dark, quite sweet (I would decrease the sugar in the future). It was very smoky and dark-- pure chocolate-- and we thought it would be a great base for some other flavour: pink pepper, ginger, mint or orange or maybe black tea. This was very!! easy to make and I had no problem with it thickening. Ate it warm.

Excellent, simple dessert, but will make a couple adjustments next time: less sugar, a little less chocolate and three servings instead of only 2.

Rating: 2
I saw that someone used chocolate chips so I did the same, reducing sugar to 1/3 c. It still turned out too sweet for me. It is a wicked quick dessert, though. Got 3 servings instead of 2, as it is very rich.

Rating: 4
I had leftover egg yolks from another recipe and came across this. Following others, I reduced sugar to 1/3 c, cornstarch to 1 T, and used 1% milk. Only change I made that I haven't read in the reviews is that I used high quality cocoa powder (4 T) rather than actual chocolate. And I used 2 egg yolks instead of 1. Delicious! Next time I would reduce sugar even more, to 1/4 c. The cocoa powder made it easy to whisk from the very beginning, and the mixture thickened up beautifully on the stove.

A vicious late afternoon chocolate craving struck, and with my baking supplies on low, I found this recipe. The method was simple and easy to follow using few dishes. Since I only had skim milk and half and half on hand, I subbed 1/3 cup of the milk for half and half. I used 4 weighed ounces of semi-sweet chocolate baking chips instead of the whole block chocolate. This came together very quickly. We had to stop ourselves from eating it warm after tasting what was left in the bowl and on the spatula! As it cooled, it became less sweet making it absolutely perfect as it was a little too sweet when it was hot. I'll definitely be making this again and looking forward to playing around with the recipe to vary the flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the pudding was wonderful. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make it again. It does make more than two servings though--at least three, possibly four. I'd greatly recommend it to anyone!

i added peppermint extract by accident and that was a great addition. i also found it a little grainy, and i think i ruined a pan. next time, i would add the cornstarch to the milk first and heat that together with the chocolate mixture, rather than chocolate first.

Rating: 4
I have to say, this tasted entirely more sweet on the spoon out of the pan than it did after it chilled for a while. Two of my kids didn't think it was sweet enough, but the one who adores dark chocolate thought it was amazing. I liked that the egg yolk was cooked -- I also thought it was mousse like in texture. I garnished with mint and raspberries -- I will absolutely make it again and probably attempt different versions (maybe mocha or grand marnier). Mmmmmmmmmmm.......yu mmmy.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS!!! I followed the recipe exactly. I used Lindt 70% cocoa chocolate. Next time, I will add a teaspoon of instant coffee to give it a slight mocha flavor. I will make this recipe all the time. My family loved it. Definitely NOT too sweet if you use true dark chocolate.

Way too thick. So rich as to be almost inedible. Save yourself the trouble and just eat a chocolate bar.

Wonderful recipie that was easy to prepare! Follow instructions and ingredients exactly and it came out really wonderful! I made this for a dinner party so I glammed it up a bit by sprinkling the top with confectioners sugar, and garnishing with a fresh-fruit berry mix and a sprig of mint leaf. it looked beautiful and everyone was extremely impressed with the dessert - it is a great alternative to a souffle or custard, which can be much more time consuming. also, i didn't wait for it to cool all the way, so it was slightly warm, which was great with the fruit!

Hooray for Pudding! I used 4 oz of bittersweet chocolate chips (Trader Joe's- yummy). As per other reviews, I cut the sugar to slightly less than 1/3 cup. Then... I saved 3 portions of the yummy stuff for us grownups and diluted the rest with lots of skim milk and made freezer pops for my tot.

Rating: 4
Yummmm.....if you love dark chocolate, this recipe is wonderful. I've tried slight variations but do not find it overly sweet for our taste as written. This time around I used 70% chocolate and 1% milk, it's good with 61% cocoa chocolate also.

Agreed. Outstanding, simple, and comes through every time. Ultimate comfort food!

Rich and chocolatey. Last time I tried to make pudding on the stove it never thickened. This one had no problem. It's a great quick dessert without too much work for 2 servings.

Rating: 4
Great easy recipe. I definitely won't buy my kids store bought pudding again. I whipped this up using the ingredients I had on hand. All of the ones listed, except that the milk was skim. I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup as per earlier reviews. It came out fantastic!

Rating: 3
Fabulous and extremely easy! It was my first time making pudding from scratch, and I decided to go big by using a bar of Valrhona 71%, making the end result quite sophisticated, that is, as much as pudding can be. Reducing the sugar is a must. (Unless you are a fan of Kozy Shack.) I did 1/3 cup but might even go lower next time.

Rating: 3
Wonderful - fast and incredibly easy! I can't believe we were eating this delicious pudding 45 minutes after I found the recipe. Ignore the ridiculous comments about this being overly-sweet (notice that those people used either semi-sweet or milk (!) chocolate rather than bittersweet, which would more than account for the extra sweetness) - I followed the recipe precisely and was thrilled with the results. Perfect for last-minute dinner guests or for a decadent weeknight snack. I used 4 6-oz. ramekins - perfect. Love the suggestion to add a dash of cinnamon... next time!

Rating: 1
It's a bit too hard to get right in a pot. I would suggest cooking the pudding without the eggs, then adding eggs and baking it in a pyrex bowl.

Rating: 3
I used 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/2, based on the advice of other reviewers. Otherwise I followed the recipe, and this pudding was easy and delicious. I'm not sure I understand why I put the chocolate in before the liquid -- it made 'whisking' the liquid and dry together really difficult. I think it would make more sense to whisk the liquid into the dry over med-high heat, add the chocolate, bring to a boil, lower the heat, and stir until thickened. I ended up with a generous 4 servings from this recipe.

Rating: 4
Rich pudding, excellent firm creamy texture, and powerful chocolate flavor. A word of caution... tasting this pudding was like inhaling the smell from a jar of cocoa powder, which I happen to think was delicious. A dash of cinnamon might add a nice touch. I used an underfilled 1/2 cup of sugar, two underfilled tbsp of cornstarch, slightly more than 1 1/3 cups whole milk, and just shy of 4 oz bittersweet chocolate according to the kitchen scale. I recommend increasing the heat very gradually over several minutes. It takes longer and your arms may get tired from all the whisking, but it will improve texture. For me it reached a boil just above medium heat, and it was easy to tell because it suddenly began to thicken at once. The number of portions depends on when you plan to serve it... for an after-dinner dessert I'd recommend dividing into four custard ramekins.

Fabulous. Used milk chocolate chips.... was incredibly over sweet. Will either cut back on sugar next time or will use suggested chocolate. Served in wine glasses with maciated strawberries. Fabulous.

This dessert was delicious and super easy. It was very dense and chocolatey. I read the other reviews about it being too sweet so I added 3 oz. of regular chocolate and 1 oz. unsweetened chocolate and it was great. I would recommend putting plastic wrap on the top to prevent a skin from forming. I did not do that this time, but will the next time I make it. Also, it easily made 4 desserts, not two. I can't imagine eating 8 oz. of this pudding (and I LOVE chocolate!)

Rating: 4
Wow, if I had known how easy it is to make chocolate pudding this good I would have been making it for years. I took the advice of other cooks and used only 1/4 cup sugar. I used some Mexican chocolate I happened to have and part of a dark chocolate bar and followed the directions other than that. It came out perfectly.

Rating: 1
Sorry to be a party pooper, but this recipe is WAY too sweet. I used Nestlies semi sweet choc. chips, and 1/3 cup of sugar rather then 1/2 cup... and still find it sickeningly sweet. And I'm a chocolate pudding fan! Also, as other reviewers have said, you've GOT to add more milk and/or decrease the corn starch. If you're planning on making this, read some of the other reviews first for modifications.

Rating: 4
Oh my God... absolutely decadent, and dead easy. I made exactly as directed. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate, and it was worth it. This is a *very* rich pudding. The two servings were almost chocolate overload for myself and my guest, but neither one of us was complaining - we both felt the need for a long walk after eating it, though. I would say that splitting the servings four ways is advisable, but that's not much of a complaint is it?

Rating: 3
Very very rich following the recipe. The one thing I did change was adding some ground cinnamon and hot chili powder to compliment the Chicken Salsa Salad it followed. I would definitely lighten it up next time and would advise any others trying the recipe to do the same. Less cornstarch and more milk ought to do the trick, perhaps even a little less chocolate?

Rating: 4
I used cocoa and a few low-quality chocolate chips, skim milk, no butter, artificial vanilla, half the sugar, and it was still unbearably rich (in a good way)! Never again will I buy packaged pudding!

After carefully considering the reviews, I used 3oz Valrhona chocolate, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 cups 2% milk. Result - not too sweet, and chocolatey enough. better w/ whipped cream, strawberries, and walnuts. However, will cut cornstarch next time or add egg yolks - despite the extra milk, very thick - like a layer in a cake rather than a pudding.

Help! I'm new to making pudding, and though I appreciate the recipe needs adjustment, from all the comments I'm not sure to make. It sounds like I should cut the sugar and chocolate, and use 2% milk, but can anyone tell me if I should/should not cut butter and/or starch???

Rating: 3
This is a quick tasty recipe that fulfilled a late night craving for sugar. I had leftover madeleines which I put in a mug and topped with the pudding! It was great... I did not add butter, and next time I make this, definitely less sugar. Even for my very sweet tooth I felt this was just too sweet.

You should have seen the rumble at my house when I asked, "would anyone like to lick the spoon?" Made with Schaffenberger bittersweet, the aroma was amazing and the taste even better - in the midst of the spoon-scuffle, I forgot the butter and vanilla - STILL delicious!

Just craving chocolate one night and came across this recipe. I used cadbury dark chocolate since that's what I had at home... decreased the amount of sugar and it came out okay. Tasted better the next day with cool whip. The quality of chocolate is very important. Next time I will buy bittersweet and I anticipate it coming out much better.

fabulous....the perfect weeknight treat. 1/2 C is way too much sugar, 1/4 C is plenty. wow, hard to believe something this easy and quick is so amazing. i'll be making this again and again. this is overwhelming even for a chocoholic...if you're unsure you can handle it (!!) use only 3oz chocolate.

super easy, quick and fantastic. this is a perfect weeknight treat, super cozy and delicious. half the sugar called for is plenty, i can't imagine adding any more. this is so rich and uber chocolatey....i wish i could say that the servings are too much for one person but i can easily finish one and love every last bit! this is a keeper....i will make it again and again.

Very rich and delicious - i always have these ingredients on hand so it's great for a quick and no-bake dessert. I used a high-quality bittersweet and skim milk (that's all i keep around) and an extra teaspoon or so of butter to compensate for lack of richness that i would've gotten from whole milk. (next time i won't add the extra butter and might cut the cornstarch a bit to see the difference.) we loved it, although one ramekin was enough for 2 people so i'll split it among 4 next time. more like a dense mousse or creme brulee texture than a pudding.

This recipe is delicious, and super chocolate-y. Anyone who thinks it is not chocolate-y enough has some challenged chocolate receptors, or is just not following the recipe. Try it once and you will make it again and again. It is enough for 4 servings, not just 2, and you can chill them in the fridge for a few hours if you like.

I agree that the amount of sugar could be reduced. I made it with 2 cups of milk, everything else as written, and it was very good - but still too sweet for me. I can't imagine how it would have been with less milk! Also - it made 5 servings with the extra milk.

I tried this recipe as it did not list heavy cream as a significant ingredient unlike many pudding recipes. I followed it exactly using Ghiardelli bittersweet. Although others obviously loved it, my husband and I found it to be too chocolately (that is possible). It definitely serves more than two as it is very rich.

I made this recipe with mediocre chocolate and it was very good. With an excellent chocolate it would be downright decadent!!

Wow--if you love chocolate, this will knock your socks off. I used good quality bittersweet chocolate, which I think is necessary because of the intensity of the chocolate in this recipe. It is super rich--I could only eat half of a portion. I'm looking forward to the second half for dessert tonight!

I make a similar recipe with these changes: 1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. Cocoa, 2 oz of bittersweet chocolate, 2 c. milk (I use 2%) and no egg yolk. Comes out perfect everytime, with nice balance of chocolate and sweet. Top with whipped cream and it is a perfect dessert.

This is a very easy recipe and tastes great. But it's too rich for my taste -- and I'm a chocoholic. I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, but it didn't tone down the intensity of the pudding. Next time, I'll use 3 oz of chocolate instead of 4 oz. Still, it's a wonderful pudding and even better with whipped cream.

The first time I made this, I quadrupled the recipie and it made way more than 8 servings. I gave some to my boss, my mother and my friend and everyone has ooohed and aaaahed so much over this recipe that I have made it again 3 more times in as many weeks. I find it a bit too rich and sweet as another cook did, but that just impresses people all the more when I tell them it's made with lowfat milk, not cream. I also think the key is very good chocolate. I use Sharffenberger and wouldn't bother using anything else. I've come back to the recipe to print it out for 2 friends - or else!

I cut the sugar in half and added cocoa powder as suggested by the other cooks. The pudding was not too sweet but it was very dense and rich--more like a pots de creme--and even too heavy for my kids who didn't eat all of theirs. This was good but I was looking for something more kid friendly.

Rating: 3
This recipe could be wonderful with some adjustments. It was a bit too sweet for my taste and I couldn't finish it. I even added 2 tablespoons of cocoa thinking it would be less sweet but it was still way too sweet using a 1/2 cup of sugar. I would cut the sugar by half. Texture was nice and creamy and I only used 1% milk. With these minor adjustments you will be happy you didn't just open a box and add milk.

Rating: 4
WOW! Who knew it would be so simply and yummy. My kids ran out of their usual Jell-o pudding and so I tried this recipe. I quadrupled the recipe, and used the chocolate that I had one hand (semi sweet mixed with unsweet) and it turned out very good. My kids were in shock that it tasted better than the commercialized garbage, and best of all no presevatives. Yeah! Will make again. Many times.

Rating: 4
This was amazing! I think the negative comments must be from folks who didn't use good chocolate. I used quality chocolate, 2% milk, and added about 3 T of good quality cocoa and the result was like biting into a creamy bar of dark chocolate. Best I've ever had!

Rating: 3
EASY and yummy... if a *little* sweet and cheerful for my taste. I like my chocolate deep and dark! When I make it again, will cut the starch a bit, cut the sugar a bit, use a less-sweet chocolate (I used a bar of Ghiradelli bittersweet), maybe add a little egg yolk or unsweetened chocolate powder. Also, I'd serve in 4 or 5 tiny ramekins instead of 2 big ones -- it's rich enough you only need a little.
