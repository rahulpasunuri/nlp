We like these so much that they became our Thanksgiving mashed potatoes and now make them every year, they look gorgeous on the plate and the bright flavor provides great contrast to some of the other sweeter sides. I don't change anything, make sure to puree the herbs in the oil very finely.

The green color is whimsical! the falvors were mellow yet satisfying. I did add a little more salt and pepper otherwise followed it to the T.

this dish is very yummy, as far as mashed potatoes go. for taste and "presentation" (really really green!) i would have given 4 forks. HOWEVER for the amount of effort required (squeeeeezing the green oil out of the puree was surprisingly tedious). i'll make again only when i'm feeling excessively patient.

I made a little differently then as described. I used a little more olive oil in the milk/butter mixture and a little less (but still some) butter. I also did not have a full cup (just the small package from Whole Foods) of chives so I filled in with green onions. I have no idea how some people made this and the mixture didn't turn green. You can't make this with dried herbs - they have to be fresh. I used Yukon potatoes and mine turned a lovely shade of green. So tasty - they don't need anything else.

Great recipe and loved the color - which was entirely why I had to try this one out. My preference was to reduce the butter by half, and didn't peel the potatoes or strain the chives/parsley. Much more rustic, and the color was definitely green and vibrant! I think next time I'll try walnut oil in the chives/parsley puree.

I had the pleasure of eating these potatoes last night, and they were so good that I'm still thinking about them today! The herb flavor is present but not overpowering, and the color was a nice contrast to everything else on my plate. I strongly encourage everyone to try them, they are delicious!

everyone loved them but they didn't turn green! I was so disappointed. Will make them again though.

They're the best that's cause I didn't whip them and they're better that way.

There were all kinds of names called on my green mashed potatoes. Kryptonite MP, radioactive MP, and more. I would not do them again even though I liked them.

I have made these potatoes two or three times now and will be making them again next weekend. They are a perfect springtime side dish. To get the really intense oil infusion (and color) it is important to really pack the herbs into the measuring cup in order to get enough. Also be sure to blend them very well with the oil.

These were absolutely wonderful. Everyone LOVED them...But...They weren't green!!!! I was so sad!!! Did they use green food coloring in the picture or something?!

I really loved the flavour, but would have liked to find a ready-made olive oil and dispense with the infusion step... After all, mashed potatoes are supposed to be the least complicated dish in the world. But I have to say, there were no leftovers.

Must be me, I don't like Yukon Golds in most recipes. Every time I try they come up too sweet. Mashed potatoes are a savory dish

This was too onion flavored to me. I like other mashed potato receipes better so probably won't make these again. Although all my guests said they liked these and none were left....

These are the best mashed potatoes ever! We absolutely loved them and will definitely make again. TIP: We rubbed the remaining oil on filet mignon before broiling-- which tasted outstanding.

These were beautiful, but not strong in flavor - I paired them with steaks served with a rich port reductions sauce. But if you're looking for big flava, this isn't it. Also, putting the herbs through the sive was time comsuming.

Try this for a different but tasty variation of old fashioned mashed potatoes. Even my son-in-law had seconds.

I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by how much flavor these mashed potatoes had. I toyed with the idea of adding garlic and parmesan cheese, but I decided I didn't want to overpower the recipe with a bunch of competing flavors. So I made my traditional roasted garlic mashed potatoes as a back-up just in case. My Thanksgiving guests ate them both up. I'd definitely do this recipe again.

This was okay. I made it, tasted it, and ended up adding a whole bunch of garlic to spruce it up a bit. It wasn't mindblowing. Wasn't bad either
