Use phyllo dough but it was dry, however, my girlfriend and I managed to put them together. It is so good and healthy, server with Chapman "no sugar added" ice cream (good for diabetes)

Darn good, but then, what I concocted has so little to do with the recipe. I didn't have mango, so I threw in some mango chutney. I didn't have crystallized ginger, so I threw in diced ginger from a jar. I used a smattering of banana liquer, then I tossed in a few glugs of cointreau and a few glugs of limoncello, plus a dash of vanilla. Goodness gracious, how delicious. I did screw up, though, and made it too sweet. Next time I'll cut way back on the sugar. Not that I actually measured it, mind youthe recipe's amount may be fine. Lord knows how much I tossed in, in my brandy-addled, no-holds-barred, kamikaze cooking spree. Hell, 30 Rock was on in 8 minutesyou expect me to read a bloody recipe? :-)

this was very good. use vanilla extract instead of the liqueur like another reviewer and it was very tasty.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong after all the great reviews this recipe had, but I thought it rather boring. I served it with ice cream, like the others did, but the bananas were super mushy and it wasn't very sweet or rich, like the bananas foster I've had in the past.

Amazing! I didn't have phyllo on hand, so I just made the bananas, replacing the banana liqueur with butterscotch schnapps. I sprinkled the bananas with cinnamon and served them in bowls of vanilla ice cream. A satisfyingly sweet end to a meal--and nutritious, too!

Like the previous reviewer I used vanilla instead of banana liqueur. This was great! Everyone wanted more. I served it with vanilla ice cream with chocolate drizzled over all of it.

I made this recipe and ate it for dessert three nights straight! It was light and delicious. I substituted about a half teaspoon of vanilla extract for the banana liqueur (it was very expensive to buy a bottle for the small amount I needed), and they came out great! I was able to make 6 turnovers instead of 4. Served with vanilla ice cream and it was great.On the second and third nights, I just popped them in the oven for a few minutes to reheat and they were as flaky and good as the first night.
