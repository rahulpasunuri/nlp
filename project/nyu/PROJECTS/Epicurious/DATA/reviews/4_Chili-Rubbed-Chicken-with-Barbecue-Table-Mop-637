EXCELLENT!!!! Made this for 2, so had to reduce the quantities used - for the rub at least. Grilled the chicken breasts for 10 minutes after 2 hours sitting. Instead of placing the MOP on the table, I dipped the breasts in the MOP prior to serving...... YEEUUMM. The citrus from the OJ in the MOP took a little of the "kick" from the rub away. Will be making this again for sure.....

Yummy! The perfect summer BBQ chicken recipe for sure. I have prepared this recipe for friends and family and there are NEVER any leftovers or requests for additional sauces, only rave reviews!

Great rub. Great sauce. Have made it twice now. Both times everyone loved it (even my picky children)! This time marinated overnight and found chicken very juicy. Will make it again and again.

Guests and hubby agreed, best bbq chicken ever. I used good quality chicken and followed the recipe, although we just grilled it on the Weber gas grill without wood chips.

Fantastic, though I didn't even try the original - went with the overnight brining. Even ignored my gas grill and hauled out the old Weber so I could do applewood chips. Moist, delicious. READ THE REVIEWS and shop the day before! orange flavor in the mop is a delightful surprise.

The rub was excellent, but I was disappointed with the mop. Not bad, but not great. May have been the bbq sauce I used. Luckily the rub is good enough to stand on it's own. Soaked the chicken for about 5 hours as per previous reviews, chicken was incredibly moist. Very very good dish!

Great rub, and fabulous BBQ sauce. I will make this sauce every time I BBQ anything - not too sweet, and just the right amount of tang. Next time I will use the salt/brown sugar soak suggested in the other reviews.

I didn't find the chicken very spicy, so I made another batch for myself and my husband and added more hot spices. I used a very spicy chili powder, a wee bit of annato and more cayenne. The result was much spicier. The chicken was very juicy. One thing to consider is that chicken can take awhile on teh grill; I usually bake mine for 20 minutes at high heat before moving it to the grill. Also, I added lots of fresh green onions to the mop and extra hot sauce. I also added some 'tiger sauce' and a bit of thai red chilis sauce(the kind you get in a tube in the produce section) which gave it an extra umpf.

Geat and easy. I also followed the Clarks Chicken recipe to marinate the chicken (1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 1/2 cups water to marinate one chicken over night)Then followed this recipe exactly. Ecellent.

Made the rub as written with boneless chicken breasts, on the grill, and ate on a bun ... better than the cajun chicken sandwiches we usually have! I made, but we really didn't eat, the mopping sauce. Mostly because the chicken with the rub already had so much flavor and a bit of pow. Will definately make again for an easy casual meal.

This was absolutly wonderful!! I added a heaping teaspoons of my favorite hot sauce, Spicy Caribbe. Next time I will add more hot sauce just becasue we like it hot. This is going to be a staple in our household. Definatly try this!

Loved it. I just put the grill on low and turned the chicken every 10 minutes for an hour. Then gave everyone their own little bowl with the mopping sauce. Easy and not a big mess on the bbq because there's no sauce. Big hit.

THANK YOU to the cook from Ottawa for the suggestion of using Clarke's BBQ Chicken recipe for the marinating and soaking of the chicken first. Very moist chicken, very happy guests. I used the rub from this recipe with BBQ sauce I made from a combonation of the maple & molasses sauces on this site. Sweet and tangy with a kick . . . have been telephoned to ask for instructions twice since.

Great recipe! Used boneless skinless breasts and it turned out crispy but still moist inside with that great cayenne zip.

This was awesome...I used "fit and easy" thighs and was amazed.

The Best! I used Free Roaming chicken and it was very moist. This was so easy to prepare. Also, I heated the sauce and served it warm. The hardest part is getting the smell of the BBQ off your hands!

I have been making this recipe since it was first published in 1995, my copy of that issue is very worn. I combine the rub and mop from this recipe with the marinade and method of preparing the bird from CLARK'S BARBECUED CHICKEN recipe and BBQ the chicken. Each recipe is good on its own but beyond compare when combined.

What a HIT this recipe was, I wasn't sure, but from all the reviews I decided to try it, thank you to all. Try it, your family will thank you.

This is spicy!! I grilled on the stovetop (grill pan), and only let the rub soak in for 30 minutes. Was a big hit with my finicky husband regardless.

This is a wonderful recipe. My husband asks for this regularly and he's not a big fan of bbq chicken. I use habanero chili sauce in place of tabasco to add heat. Delicious! The rub and mop sauce are also great on ribs!

This is one my favorite recipes -- it's also great on baby back ribs. It does pack some heat, however, so adjust cayenne to suit your individual taste.

We made this recipe for a group of twelve...doubled the recipe. Everyone raved about it. It was not too hot...just enough heat. We served it with a beet coleslaw, picnic potato salad, both from epicurious site along with ice cold water melon with marinated berries over vanilla ice cream for dessert. We will make the bbq recipe again. thanks

Yummy. We adjust the heat up and down depending on who we are serving. The mop really completes the dish.

Wow! This is a great rub! Boy does it have heat, next time I will cut back a bit on the cayenne pepper and chili powder (not much though). I used this on chicken breasts and cooked them on a George Foreman grill and they were great. I can't wait to try them on the grill in the summer. I would give this recipe 4 forks, but the table mop was just ok, to me it just tasted like the bbq sauce I started with.

I just found this recipe again, after forgetting the name... It was worth the search..It's one of the best chicken recipe that I've tried.

The mop was just okay, but the dry rub really seals the juices in the chicken.

Outstanding, I tried it with boneless pork chops and it was excellent. I would like to try it with spare ribs as well as chicken.

This is spicy and good. We halved the recipe and it still made way more then we needed. An awesome summertime dish!

This is my all time favorite grilling recipe. It's easy & tastes great!

Phenomenal! The rub sealed in the juices and created a crisp and spicy coating. The mop was appropriately tangy with just the right amount of heat from the tabasco. A real winner!

A very simple yet tasty dish. I used boneless breasts and grilled them. The mop was so good my southern husband asked me to make up a bottle to keep around. I look forward to making it again.

Great chicken. I've made this three times this summer. Family and friends have raved and asked for the recipe. Try it!

Very tastey chicken. I used boneless breasts and grilled them 5 minutes per side. Easy and a nice change from marinades.

Rating: 3
The rub and sauce are great. The sauce was so good I caught myself testing it several times before the chicken was done. So much better than plain bottled and very easy. Finally something spicy enough for my husband but not over the top for me. I may have cut down on the tabasco, etc., but not much.

Excellent dish -- my family loved it!! (and they are so picky!)
