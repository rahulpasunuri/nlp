I was looking for a wing recipe that did not include tomato or chili or other heat but wanted good flavour. This recipe is good, just needs one little extra dimension of flavour, I think. Next time I will add a little orange zest to the marinade and substitute the lemon juice with fresh orange juice. The addition of butter to the glaze was a good suggestion. I had huge wings from the butcher so the time to cook was longer. I would also suggest with large wings to flip them on the rack for a minute or two at the end.

Good...different. I added butter to the lemon/cumin mix which I liked
