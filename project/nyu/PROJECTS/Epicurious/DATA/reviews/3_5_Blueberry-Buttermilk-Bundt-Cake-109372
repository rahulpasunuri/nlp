Excellent! I don't usually substitute much especially in baking but was desperate to get a cake made and only had fresh raspberries. I floured them a tiny bit and added to the batter. They weren't attractively spread throughout the finished cake but they weren't all at the bottom either--and the taste was fantastic. I also subbed greek yogurt for no buttermilk and the finished texture was dense but moist and delish.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS! I made it exactly according to the recipe and everyone raved. I used frozen blueberries and they ended up nicely distributed throughout the cake.

this desert was okay. I didn't use frozen blueberries, I used fresh ones and they didn't sink to the bottom because the batter was so thick and it wasn't too sweet because the blueberries were a little tart. i suggest not using too much sugar so the batter doesn't overwhelm the blueberries. add some butter on top and it will taste just like mommas recipe for blueberry loaf bread! After a long day of riding my horse white feather, it hit the spot. Anyway, very moist and packed with 2 flavors that mingle well together, wouldn't make it again, but pretty good.

This recipe really needs no more reviews, but I have to say, this was delicious and very easy. Took a few others' tips and made only these changes: reduced sugar to 1 1/3 c., used 1 full cup buttermilk and added about 2/3 cup extra blueberries, just because I had them. It was a really nice breakfast cake.

Rating: 1
have had good experiences with buttermilk cakes so the review stating that the batter is heavy did not cause me to hesitate. that being said, the consistency of the finished cake was HEAVY, almost like eating a buttermilk donut. also, i used fresh wild blueberries which i guess were too small to sink. they all stayed on the top. will be looking for another blueberry cake.

This is good, not great. I had the same problems as the other reviewers (batter was thick and a little too sweet). I think there are better recipes for blueberry desserts. I did like the orange zest--I have used lemon and blueberry together before, and I think that the orange zest is a little smoother.

Great cake but the batter is a bit thick. I added a bit more buttermilk and the recipe turned out very well.

Fantastic cake that was perfect as a tea-time snack. I used only 1 cup of sugar and only 1 stick of butter, but it turned out fluffy, sweet, and delicious. I also used part cake flour, because I ran out of regular flour. I used fresh rather than frozen blueberries. Because the recipe warned they would sink to the bottom, I didn't mix them into the batter; I poured the batter into the cake pan, then dropped the blueberries onto the top of the batter and pushed them down until they were mostly just barely submerged in batter. This turned out really well; they didn't sink much, so when I turned the cake out onto a dish, the bottom of the cake had a nice, juicy rim of blueberries. That's definitely how I'll make it from now on. I served it a few times with blueberry jam heated with a bit of pear liqueur. Delicious!

This was delicious. I made it exactly as written (and it took 1 hour and 5 minutes), but if I were to make it again, I think I would use a little less sugar. It is ever so slightly too sweet for my taste. However, it quickly disappeared, so it's a crowd pleaser.

This coffee cake was well received! I was a little disappointed that I couldn't taste the buttermilk. I used lemon peel instead of orange and tried powdered sugar sprinkled on half and lemon glaze on the other half. The glazed side was eaten first, but both were very good. My frozen blueberries sort of sunk, but was told nobody noticed. I did use about 1/4C extra buttermilk and forgot to alternate the dry with the buttermilk when mixing, it caused no problems. I will make this again!

I was very disappointed by this receipe. I made it exactly as the receipe indicated and just from experience I thought the flour seems like quite a lot and I was right. I knew there was something wrong when it took 1 hour and 26 minutes to bake. It came out too doughie, if that's a word. As one of the other reviews had said I increased the buttermilk to 1 cup,thinking it would make it moist, but didn't make a difference. I felt it was a waste of all the ingredients, but then you never know until you try. I am now searching for another blueberry cake, or I might try this again with less flour and a bit less blueberries.

Rating: 4
This is a great base for a bundt cake. I used cranberries instead of blueberries, and the fruit did not sink. Toss in a bit of extra flour if you are worried. The batter is thick and comes together easily. Very moist and tasty, though watch it after 1 hour. Came out perfectly by just spraying the pan. Family loved it with a sugar glaze. A wonderful recipe for any baker.

This is such a delicious and easy recipe that I've made it three times in the last week! The first time I used fresh blueberries and 1/4 cup more buttermilk and it was perfectly moist. The second time, I only had frozen rasberries, but my family still loved it and ate the whole thing. I thought though, that the texture was comprimized because the defrosted rasberries were so runny . The last time, instead of berries, I trippled the lemon peel and used a 3/4 cup poppy seeds for a delicious twist on this basic buttermilk bundt cake, It's so easy, I know it by heart, and I "heart" it!

Rating: 4
I rated this 4 forks not because the taste was exceptional (it was very good), but that the good taste combined with the ease and presentation makes it a great go-to recipe for company or taking to a friend's house. I used at least 1 c buttermilk. Wish I had used more orange zest and added a citrus glaze. I will play with this one. Also, baked for close to 70 mins.

Rating: 4
Wow! What an easy recipe. And so delicious, too! I used orange rind for mine and thought the sweetness of the citrus complimented the tartness of the blueberries beautifully. I was a tiny bit short of the required amount of buttermilk, and added a splash of regular milk to preserve its moistness. Worked perfectly! By the way-- if you are ever without buttermilk, try combining a scant cup of milk at room temperature with a tablespoon of white vinegar. Same thing!

Rating: 3
This was a delicious breakfast cake. Everything I was hoping for. In order to lower the amount of fat, I substituted 1 1/4 cups nonfat plain yogurt for the buttermilk and reduced the amount of butter to 1 stick. There was no loss of anything. Everyone loved it and thought it was moist and completely delicious. Highly recommended.

Rating: 3
This cake was very tasty, but just a bit dry. I used lemon peel in place of the orange and I made a lemon powdered-sugar glaze to go over the top. I might try just a bit more buttermilk next time to see if that remedies the dryness. Very good otherwise!

This cake is really tasty and pretty easy to make. I have made it a few times now. I used lemon zest instead of orange, per other reviewers' suggestions. I substituted one cup of the flour with cake flour and also added extra buttermilk (the first time I made the cake I thought it was a bit dry - the extra buttermilk helped a lot). I found this cake baked faster than an hour, so I would check it after 45 minutes. It could be my oven, but my mum made this cake recently as well and said it baked fast for her too.

This was my first- ever bundt cake. It turned out beautifully--and tasted great too. NordicWare (originator of the bundt pan) says to use Baker's Joy to coat the pan. Worked great!

I have not tried this yet but will this week. However, I wish to comment on the bundt pan release issue. Dump your old metal pans and purchase a silicone bundt. Spray lightly before use. After the cake cools about 15 min. pull the sides slightly and it will drop onto the plate...perfectly!

I didn't have any oranges or lemons on hand, so i skipped the zest and it was still delicious. I used frozen blueberries and was a little concerned by the purple batter that it created. It baked into a yellow cake though. I only gave it 3 forks b/c it was difficult getting out of the pan and part of it broke off.

Rating: 3
This was quite good! I used 2 sticks of butter, lemon zest and added a bit of lemon juice to the batter. The batter was REALLY thick and I was concerned but it turned out well. I used frozen blueberries, dusted with flour and they did not sink. Also used a lemon/10xsugar/vanil la glaze, which I think it really needs. I use a toothbrush to make sure that my Nordicware pan is thoroughly greased in each crack and crevice. As long as the pan is lightly floured and you cool the cake for 10 minutes, release is not an issue. Leave the cake in the pan too long ....problems.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe - I've made it several times and it always comes out a winner. The frozen blueberries are key. Instead of orange rind, I use lemon rind and use some of the lemon juice mixed with powdered sugar to create a glaze - it really brightens up the flavor.

I made this for a casual summer lunch with a friend, and it turned out just great - texture, flavor, and ease of preparation all get 4 forks from me. It's the kind of cake you would take to a new neighbor or enjoy on a porch swing with a tall iced tea - a classic, old-fashioned-y, comfort cake. The only thing I would do differently next time is I think I will add a light OJ- confectioners' sugar glaze to it to dress it up a little. Without a glaze, it is a bit more like a coffee cake. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!) Great recipe, I will definitely put this in my regular rotation.

This cake is wonderful and is wonderfully easy to make. I used lemon zest instead of orange peel. Either would work nicely. Next time I make this, I will reduce sugar to 1.5 cups or slightly less -- the cake was just a tad too sweet.

I made this with blueberries and with cranberries. Although I enjoyed the blueberries, the cranberry one was outstanding because it gave a powerfull tart flavor punch when you bit into a cranberry that contrasted nicely with the sweetness of the cake.

Very, very good summer cake. Decorating tip: I used a bundt pan so the finished product was as pictured above. I placed the finished cake on a white doily and dusted with confectionary sugar. Then placed upon a antique dark blue cake plate, inserted a votive candle holder in the bundt center and filled with bright yellow "Black-Eyed Susans." If this doesn't scream SUMMER!..I don't know what would.

This was delicious! I didn't have a bundt pan, so I used an 8" square cake pan. It worked just fine and was done in about 55 minutes. It's kind of like a giant blueberry muffin. I also found that fresh blueberries worked just fine and din't sink to the bottom - the batter was plenty thick enough!

Delicious! There are so many reviews of this recipe that I was daunted by the many modifications others had made prior to rating it. I cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, but it would have been fine as written. Baking time was 1 hour 10 minutes. Other than that, just like the recipe, and a big hit!

Made it without blueberries, with a whole cup of buttermilk and a small ribbon of jam in the middle. Baked for a few minutes over an hour. Cut down the sugar for 1 cup white and 1/4 cup brown.

I made this cake, substituted the orange zest with lemon zest, and adding lemon juice to the batter. I would have used orange but I had lemons in the kitchen and making this cake was a late night wild hair! I also added more buttermilk as the batter was incredibily thick, but I was careful not to make it too thin. Used fresh blueberries without dusting with flour and they didn't sink at all. I also cut the sugar down to just a bit more than a cup. Warm out of the oven it was fabulous. Oh, no problems unmolding either. I do sorta feel though that it needs a glaze of some sort, so I might make an orange/conf. sugar glaze for it today and see how that goes. Wonderful with morning coffee!

Rating: 4
This was an excellent cake. It was fluffy, yet extremely moist. I used lemon zest instead of orange and added 1 tbsp lemon juice to the batter, which gave it a very nice, but subtle, lemon flavor. Also, I used 3 cups of fresh blueberries, coating them in some of the flour so they wouldn't sink to the bottom of the cake. The first time I made it for brunch/afternoon and simply topped it with powdered sugar. The second time I dressed it up a little more for dessert with a lemon glaze (1 cup confectioners sugar and juice of 1 lemon). It was good, but not really necessary. Everyone I have made this cake for has raved over it.

Rating: 3
This was a BIG hit with everyone that tried it. A friend that is a chocolate lover said that as she was eating it she thought "who needs chocolate". I used a combination of fresh and frozen blueberries. I have also combated the supposed problem of sinking fresh blueberries by first coating them in a bit of the flour before folding them into the batter.

I live in Central NJ where every June is blueberry picking season so of course I had a lot of frozen blueberries left over from 2004 season and not a clue on what to do with them. I made this cake for the 4th of July, 2005 and was praying the whole time that it would taste ok. Wow!! The cake came out great and tasted great! I got rave reviews from everyone who ate the cake that day! The blueberries were not the sweetest so it gave the cake a nice, slightly, tart flavor that meshed well with the lightly sweet cake. This cake was moist and delicious. I made the cake a day head and followed the advice of the reviewer from Monrivia, CA and added an extra ¼ cup of butter and an extra ¼ cup of buttermilk. I used whole cultured buttermilk and not low-fat or reduced-fat buttermilk because using low-fat or reduced-fat buttermilk would add water to the cake and I wanted this cake to be as moist as possible. Not that there is anything wrong with using low-fat or reduced-fat buttermilk but I knew it was going to be a full fat and a high carbohydrate barbeque, after all it was Independence Day. After I creamed the butter and buttermilk with the flat beater on my Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer, I used the balloon whisk to whip the ingredients. This added air to the batter thus making the cake lighter so that it would rise higher during baking. If you use Crisco shortening (not oil) to flour a non-stick Nordic Ware Bundt pan, you will have no trouble releasing the, cooled, cake from the pan. I will defiantly make this cake again!

I've made this a dozen times varying the flavor, with and without berries, frosted with buttercream or cream cheese, glazed, and plain. It comes out fine every time using my mother's old Bundt cake pan she never used that still had its $1.99 price tag on it when I "borrowed" it. I think the cranberry orange is best but have made it with grated lemon and its wonderful. In fact there's one in the oven now. I let it stand 20 minutes and the cake unmolds perfectly. It's a great standard in the repetoire. When in doubt, Bundt!

Made this earlier this year, with blueberries. Perfectly acceptable, but nothing to rave about. Tried it again last night with cranberries (one bag, raw) -- people are stopping dead in their tracks to rave about how good it is. Definitely one to add to the repetoire -- and easy as all get out. Instead of simply sifting powdered sugar over, used the juice of the zested orange to combine with powdered sugar and a pinch of salt to make a light glaze. Really finishes it off nicely.

very tasty but it completely broke out up when I tried to unmold it. I had to make mini trifles with it instead, serving it with an orange scented custard. However, the cake was very very good. I'm sending my pan back to nordicware for replacement since it never unmolds well.

This cake is yummy! Even my husband who never eats sweets had 2 slices. I followed the recipe exactly and baked it in a buttered (not floured) Nordic Ware bundt pan for exactly one hour. Let it cool in the pan on a cooling rack for ten minutes and then turn it over and it will slide out of the pan. Dust it with powdered sugar in a sifter and eat it while it is still warm. It is much better warm and it slices beautifully. We served it with vanilla ice cream. Enjoy.

This case is incredible. I can't imagine anyone not liking it. Be careful when measuring out the flour (err on the side of too little rather than too much) and be sure your baking powder is fresh or you could end up with a much heavier/denser cake. I use lemon zest and blackberries and reserve 1 T of the flour to coat the berries with so they don't sink. I've made this countless times. A beautiful and classicly old-fashioned cake!

I made the cake as described and think it's a definite keeper. The result IS a dense, very moist cake--but I don't think that's a bad thing! Kind of like pound cake with fruit in it. This recipe allows you to adapt the fruit and flavoring ingredients to what is on hand making it very flexible. I second what others have said about the scary purple batter morphing into pretty yellow cake. Don't freak out! All will be well. I have a nonstick Bundt pan which I greased and floured. The cake came out of the pan just fine.

This is a great recipe. I made it twice, two days in a row, as I gave the first one as a gift. It was enjoyed by all.

I was a little wary of making this after reviewing the others' comments, however....I made this last night - used both lemon and orange peel and a tablespoon of vanilla and increased the berries to 3 cups. I did not freeze the blueberries either and they went to the bottom of the cake but it presents very nicely. The cake had to cool in the pan - when I tried to release it after ten minutes the bottom was too loose. It was sooo moist - my son ate half of the cake as a midnight snack! I brought it to work and everyone requested the recipe. I recommend using dried orange and lemon peel - plenty of flavor! Great cake!

This is really good, and very easy. I used half and half lemon and tangerine rind, because that was all that was in the house! I'll use orange next time I do it with blueberries.

I did a simple powdered sugar and milk glaze, with a drop of additional almond extract. WOW! That was really great. The original is a sort of simple breakfast cake, I changed it into a great dessert.

This was ok; not great. I much prefer a blueberry streusel bundt recipe published a couple years ago in the Penzey Spice catalog.

Awesome cake. I bake A LOT and thought this was definately one of the best cakes I've made.. Made the cake twice last week , once for a meeting at work and ones for hubs to take to work. He told me the morning huddle was dedicated to me b/c they loved the cake so much. Was gone in 15 minutes and I've been inundated w recipe requests ever since. Time to make one for ME! Didn't change a thing on the recipe. Found that Market Basket frozen blueberries were the best ..large and held their shape well.

I made this and the only change I made was to omit the orange zest and add the juice of 1 lemon and zest. If you use frozen blueberries take note: while folding in the berries, the batter sort of seized up making it extremely thick. I guess it's the cold hitting the butter in the batter. It was difficult to "pour" into the pan. The end result: it tasted like a blueberry muffin. Good, but I guess I should stick to recipes I love - chocolate.

I wish I had waited a week to make this recipe --I would have seen all these reviews from people who said this tasted like a blueberry muffin from a bakery. Like most bakery muffins, I thought this cake was too sweet and dense. On the other hand, my mother-in-law loved it (except for the orange zest) and asked for the recipe.

Didn't much care for this. It was pretty, but very sweet, and heavy, I thought.

Very moist (thanks to the buttermilk, no doubt). I made it with blackberries/lemon combo, and I want to try it with blackberries/lime next. I also halfed the recipe, used only one egg, and baked in a loaf pan, and it turned out fine!

Easy, moist, and very yummy. I will definitely make this agin.

Delicious! Would I make it again? I already have! I really love lemon, and after reading previous reviews, I decided to keep a bottle of lemon extract handy to add as needed. I ended up using almost 1&1/2 tsps of lemon extract, being a little generous with the vanilla, and omitting the orange peel. We loved it! It was exactly like a bundt cake version of a rich, irresistible blueberry muffin from a great bakery! Definitely a hit on Mother's Day. Very moist, rich, and neither too heavy or too light in texture (both regular and veganized versions). If you have a smaller 10-cup capacity bundt, 2/3 of the recipe fits with a little extra room to spare if you feel like adding extra berries (it was great with really big ones). VEGANS! This worked really well with Ener-G egg replacer, margarine, and a combo of 3 Tbsp vegan sour cream, 1&1/2 tsps lemon juice, and nondairy milk to equal 3/4 cup in place of the buttermilk. Or you could probably just use all soured nondairy milk instead of bothering with the veg sour cream--the sour cream just replaced the thickness of buttermilk, and I happened to have some already on hand.

I made this for Mother's Day breakfast, and it was a huge hit. I didn't use the orange peel, and I used fresh berries, taking another reviewer's suggestion of coating them in flour first (I think the recipe needs 2.5 cups of berries). It's easier to spoon the thick batter into the pan (use baby loaf pans if you don't have a bundt pan) than to pour it. I served it with creme fraiche, which was a fabulous complement. Next time I might try making it with cranberries...

It tasted like the best sweet blueberry muffin ever. I made it in a mini bundt pan, and it rose quite a bit, giving me 6 delicious muffin-tops (I cut the extra off to make the bottoms of the cakes flat)

I followed the recipe exactly and I was quite disappointed. The batter seemed like a dough almost and after baking the case was very dense. It was tasty though the first day, but on the second day it got dry and wasn't very appealing. Maybe I packed too much flour... ?

This was great! It looked dry (oh how wrong I was), so I glazed it with an OJ/powdered sugar/cream cheese and butter mixture. I got great reviews from my family. It would have been delicious with or without the glaze.

Do you think I could substitute fresh strawberries? I went strawberry picking and even after making jam I still have pleny to use.

Rating: 0
To address the cook from Wilson, NC, I also spoon my flour into a dry measuring cup and level with the back of a knife. I've read that when you dip your measuring cup into the flour, you run the risk of packing too much flour into the cup, and thus, into your recipe. (P.S. Recipe looks like a real nice way to use up leftover buttermilk!) :)

I wasn't disciplined enough to let it cool completely before cutting into it:) Very tender, very nice with a glass of milk.

This was a great cake. I did use more blueberries and everyone loved it. I also made it a second time with chopped frozen cranberries and pecans. I enjoyed the taste from the grated orange peel.I'm also going to try it with strawberries and almonds and I bet if there was ever any left it would freeze well.

This was so easy and tasted delightful. It was very moist and therefore stayed fresh for several days.

Very tasty, moist easy breakfast cake. I think I will try it with frozen chopped cherries and mini chips, no orange peel, next time. To those who had trouble with sticking, the best thing I have found to help release cakes from bundt pans it a thin plastic spatula, it bends to the curves of the pan and doesn't scratch the non stick surface. Also I think when it is a little pulled away from the sides, steam helps it release also.

Enjoyed this breakfast cake very much. Had no oranges on hand, so grated lemon peel, and that was just fine. Used dry buttermilk. Don't know if that contributed to the light texture or not. A lovely contrast to the sour cream/cream cheese struesel coffee cakes I usually bake.

Rating: 3
This was a most delicious cake. A dense cake that is simple to prepare, flavorful and pretty. Served it with fresh blueberries around the perimeter and a dab of whipped cream. Would recommend using a slightly larger quantity of frozen blueberries next time - maybe 2 1/2 or 3 cups instead of two.

This is a terrific cake and quite easy to prepare. The vanilla and orange peel give it plenty of flavor (I was surprised at the reviewers who described it as tasteless). It's a wonderful, light breakfast cake that we will have again.

A quick, easy, and delicious cake! Will definitely make this again.

This cake was OK, but I don't think it has enough flavor to stand alone with only powdered sugar as a topping. It would take a pretty interesting glaze to make it worth the calories. Or perhaps more orange peel and/or some vanilla pudding in the batter.

Rating: 3
Great cake!! For those who would rather use fresh than frozen blueberries, toss the blueberries with a little bit of flour before mixing them in. The flour prevents them from sinking. Also use that trick with adding carrots and raisins to carrot cake.

Rating: 3
A pretty, simple little cake. It goes together easily and without much mess. The batter was so thick that it was hard to fold the blueberries in, but it baked up wonderfully. Don't worry if your blueberries tint the batter purple - you will still end up with a normal-looking cake.

This is the best Blueberry bundt cake I have ever had. My 2 friends are in agreement! I added 1/4 cup of extra butter and buttermilk. It came our so moist & delicious! I will make it again & again!

This is great. Very easy to make. The dough is very heavy, but the cake comes out very light. I also expected a purple mess, but it came out just like the picture.

This cake was very easy to make and I had no problems. Ditto to all who said the batter was thick-it still came out very good. I didn't worry too much about the blueberries since they were frozen. Just threw them in the mixer, gave it a few whirls and they were just fine. I also found the taste was much better if the cake was allowed to sit for a day.

Question: Way back, when I learned to cook, one sifted and then spooned flour into a dry measuring cup and leveled with back of knife. Now it seems many cooking sources use the dip and sweep method to measure flour. Which way is best for this recipe? Thank you. FCA

Made exactly as directed and had no trouble removing from pan, just let it rest 20 minutes instead of 10, but was disappointed in taste...have so many cakes that are so much better

You could use lemon zest, and mix the powdered sugar w/ some lemon juice to drizzle over the cake after it cools. If you dredge fresh blueberries in flour (or mix them into the flour mixture before adding the liquid) they won't sink to the bottom. I used Williams-Sonoma's cake pan coating, and the cake didn't stick...also used a non-stick pan.

" This cake is good, but, you need to have a glass of milk and some powdered sugar on top ( while watching TV).

I used the other reviewers' advice and added some nutmeg and I double-floured the pan. Don't be frightened of the thickness of the batter. Was really delicious.

Rating: 3
Very good, moist cake with a nice crumb. Despite greasing & flouring the bundt pan, my cake stuck in the pan and looked like it had been in a train wreck by the time I removed all of the pieces. However, it still tasted yummy! I'll probably add a dash of freshly grated nutmeg to the batter next time I make it, and will probably use two loaf pans just to be on the safe side.

I was a little concerned at first because the batter is so thick, but it baked up beautifully. We thought the cake was pretty tasteless, but I think the problem could be with the frozen Maine Wild Blueberries that I used. I will try it again this summer using "real" blueberries...
