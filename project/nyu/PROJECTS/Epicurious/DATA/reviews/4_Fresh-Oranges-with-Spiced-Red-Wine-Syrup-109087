Great taste but never reduced to syrup for me. Fantastic poured over a lemon pound cake but much better and easier to just cut fresh oranges (much smaller quantity) into smaller pieces and just add to sauce ahead to soak up great flavors and then pour it over cake slices.

Reduced to about 1.5 cups instead of 1 cup. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly. Absolutely wonderful.

This is a recipe that I have made for years. I always get requests for it. You can serve it with Pound Cake, frozen yogurt, orange segments or any kind of fruit. It makes the house smell so good as it simmers. Great to have on hand for guests who are not chocolate people :-)

This was so simple and delicious. I didn't need 8 servings so I halved the wine and sugar, and that worked fine. I skipped the grated peel/sugar topping and didn't miss it. I had to heat the syrup slightly before serving, because it had hardened in the fridge, but it only took a few seconds to re-liquefy and was no problem. The perfect light dessert!

Excellent! I made this for a tapas party I threw. Got rave reviews from 10 out of 10 guests. Served it with some good quality vanilla bean ice cream. I hate segmenting oranges, though, but I made another poached orange recipe from this site and just sliced the oranges into 1/2 round - so I may try that next time I make this one.

Yes. reviews are right on. - go light on reduction time (carmalizes quick) - try adding part splenda for wine syrup, to bring down sugar content - complex flavors, not everyone will like it.

Absolutely gorgeous. Great flavor, lovely aesthetic. Though I couldnt resist adding a small scoop of vanilla ice cream to each serving, its a much lighter alternative to the chocolate cakes and cheesecakes that are my dessert defaults. A perfect post-BBQ refresher.

I made this recipe for a Spanish themed dinner. Everyone loved it and I will definitely use it again. The syrup was surprisingly sweet and could even be used on vanilla ice cream.

I've made this for a dinner party and even the guests who never eat dessert had seconds. I didn't have the time to segment the oranges, so i just sliced them on a half moon shape and arranged them on neat layers on a small plate. They almost looked like a flower and everybody raved about it.

I love this recipe. It's light, refreshing, elegant, easy to make, and can be made ahead. To A Cook from PA: if you segment the oranges properly, there should be no membrane left at all.

Orange segments should probably be halved crosswise so each bit has fresh orange flavor rather than just the taste and texture of the membrane. Also, cooking down a bottle of wine and adding sugar produces something like grape jelly with no alcohol left, albeit cinnamon-flavored. Why not use a good jelly and add a bit of brandy and a bit of water?

This was very delicious, refreshing and perfect after a Spanish meal with paella. I made the recipe exactly as stated, and served it with Chocolate Hazelnut Biscotti (Bon Appetit mag.)

This was wonderful. Removing the pith completely refines the experience of eating an orange. So simple! And I had the syrup the next morning over oatmeal with creme fraiche.

This was a very refreshing dessert - however, cutting the oranges as directed was really time-consuming. Next time, I wil peel the oranges, slice them, and pour the wine sauce on. Much easier and I think equally delicious.

The wine syrup was a big hit. I cheated and used canned mandarin oranges. Served everthing in a saucer champagne glass. It is a very impressive dessert, and tastes great.

I am not a dessert person... in fact, I would rather have two appetizers as opposed to a dessert. As the ending to a Spanish meal I prepared, however, this dessert was phenomenal. The combination of the juicy citrus fruit with the dark cinnamon wine syrup and the zest sugar cannot be adequately described. It's everything I like in a dessert... bursting with flavour, not overly heavy, really really easy... and oh so elegant. I served each dessert in a martini glass with a tiny scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Impress your guests with this... I impressed myself and that doesn't happen often.

This was one of the most well received dishes at my tapas party this evening. I, like a previous reviewer, caramelized the first batch and had to make a second. I ended up with almost 12 oz. -- probably b/c I was scared of the same thing happening again. I used a $6 Shiraz and it was fine. I also added two peaches and had to add another peach near the end because they kept being picked out. Do yourself and your guests a favor and please make this!

I too made this for a Spanish-themed dinner party, & it was the hit course of the evening. I just used a cheapish but full-bodied red, so would agree with the previous reviewer that a more expensive & Spanish wine isn't essential - but cutting the oranges into segments without pith IS! I served it with whipped cream with cinnamon & vanilla.

I made this for dessert at a tapas party. It was ok for me, I've never been a fan of the "fruit dessert" but everyone else claimed they loved it. It's different and it's pretty to look at. It takes a long time to boil off the wine- and be careful when it gets down close to the 1 cup level, the sugar could carmalize if cooked too long- I had to make it twice.

I served this dessert when I had a lot of company, and everyone absolutely loved it, even my kids (who don't consider fruit a dessert :) It is a little syrupy to pour, but a little goes a long way. I combine regular grapefruit with pink grapefruit and pomela in addition to the oranges and it's fabulous!

Made this over the weekend for a Spanish wine dinner. Taking the orange segments out of the membranes but very time consuming and I'd skip it if not doing this for a party. Syrup was *amazing* and a huge hit. It went on the oranges, on another guest's contribution of flan... and then we dug out vanilla ice cream from the freezer. Riberas can be very expensive so don't hesitate to get a less expensive Sardon de Duero - just pick a wine with bigger fruit and less tannin.

The syrup was so thick I didn't really drizzle, It has a very thick honey consistency. Filted the 8 oranges took me more than 1/2 hour. Since I have lots of leftover syrup, next time I'm going to skin the outside of the orange and slice it horizontal slices instead of skining each segment.

Refreshing dessert, and easily made the day before. We served for dinner guests last night and six oranges disappeared among the four of us. If you can find two types of oranges, the color contrast is quite nice.

I didn't expect this to be so tasty but the cinnamon in the red wine syrup made a perfect balance with the tartness in the oranges. With the lemon cake, it made for a mouth-watering dessert. So easy, I'll definitely make this again.
