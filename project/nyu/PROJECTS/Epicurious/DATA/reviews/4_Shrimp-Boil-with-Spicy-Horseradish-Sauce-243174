Super easy, good, but not amazing. I don't think you necessarily need to boil everything in a huge pot of water, but just enough to cover the potatoes and simmer everything else. Will definitely make again.

Really easy, really good. The Creole/Cajun seasoning is a must.

Very fresh corn AND shrimp needs only about 3 minutes total, needs a bit more spice, but very good and easy.

Quite yummy and easy--perfect for a hot summer night. We only wished it had been a bit spicier, so we added some cayenne and cajun seasoning sprinkled on top when we served it. Had it as part of the "Spicy Southern Shrimp Boil" menu that included okra/corn salad and figs with goat cheese. All were delicious, but the dessert, with its use of rosemary, struck an odd note in this particular menu.

We've done this recipe time and time again....one time when we were moving and had no kitchen. Did it all on the grill in a camping pot. Sometime we add artichokes to the pot. Always delish, easy and quick. It's what's for dinner!

Not so (yet). The oil has not yet gotten east of Pensacola. There are still large areas of the gulf and intracoastal waterway that are providing great seafood. For shrimp, look for Apalachicola Bay shrimp. This is so much like what we do with shrimp, crab legs, etc. that I'm giving it 4 big stars. (Try it with Zatarans Crab Boil seasoning.)

Sigh, too bad we'll be making this without the southern shrimp for a good while...

This is my go-to summer dinner party meal. Add 2" pices of smoked louisiana sausage for more hearty fare. I put them in with the corn.

With good ingredients, this is the best summer meal! One of the easiest dinner party meals too!

Delicious and spicy! It's also easy to make and quite healthy if you use a low-fat mayo. We can't wait to have this again.

Loved this!!! Used Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning and no salt. Used the cute fingerling potatoes. Perfect for a backyard summer party.

I've made this recipe a couple of times now, it's wonderful. I've added black mussles, bay scallops, and crawfish, all were fun/tasty additions. I'll make this again and again!

I thought this was very good. I used small shrimp and found them quite flavorful. Added 1 tsp dried rosemary to the pot. Also cut some smoked sausage into thin slices, browned in a different pan and threw in at the end. I don't think Old Bay is a good substitute for Creole seasoning. Try Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning, it's what they use in Louisiana.

Loved this recipe. We modified a bit to include king crab legs, substituted baby fingerlings for the potatoes, and cut the corn in half so everything was perfectly bite sized. I had unknowingly run out of horseradish, so I used Dijon mustard and cayenne pepper instead which was fabulous!

I was surprised at how good this was. Cut up and fried some kielbasa to add at the end, which fleshed it out a little, but wasn't necessary. Not as spicy as I thought it would be, but the flavor was excellent - the shrimp and sauce especially.

I really liked this recipe. Followed as is and found that the shrimp were very flavorful AND spicy. Definitely a keeper. May try adding smoked sausage next time.

Absolutely delicious, I cut down on the spice a tad but it was still hot. So easy, all in one pot.

We made this with fresh corn from the Berkshires-it was easy and tasty. My 17 year old daughter made the sauce. It is a great meal for an easy summer evening with exceptional ingredients.

We really liked this boil. We made the horseradhis sauce as is and even the kids loved it. I used old bay seasoning in the boil (not sure the difference between this and creole). The only change for next time is try a smaller butter potato - may be moister. I melted butter for the potatoes because they were a bit dry.

This recipe was not that great. gthe shrimp were not very flavorful. We made the horseradish with just sour cream, horseradish, and lemon juice and that was the best part. I would reccommend serving corn bread with this or some other bread.

This recipe was ok. We used a standard recipe for the horseradish sauce of sour cream, horseradish, and lemon juice. Felt that the shrimp did not have enough flavor. I would recommend a corn bread or other bread served with this dish. Eh Probably will not make it again.
