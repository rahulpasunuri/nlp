Don't waste your time, money and energy with this recipe. I like all of these ingredients and I'm pretty good in the kitchen, but I could not make this OK. The ingredient quantities are completely off. It's bland unless you really increase the spice. A complete waste of time. I ended-up with a goulash that I put over rice and had a ton of uncooked ingredients left over. Not!

Really great, simple recipe. I skipped the eggplant and added a lot of pepper and extra herbs.

I modified this recipe somewhat. I used turkey instead of beef (I think you can use any chopped meat!). I didn't have chicken broth, so I used water. I used yellow squash instead of zucchini because that's what I had in the fridge. I added parmesan cheese to the mixture and I rolled up the cabbage leaves, like regular stuffed cabbage. Also, I left out the tomato because it gives my husband heartburn!

I followed the recipe as directed from self.com. There is no way that 3 lbs of cabbage will fit in a medium saute pan, let alone with all the other vegetables. At least half of the cabbage was left over. Poorly written directions!! In the oven at the moment so I cannot comment on the taste.

I used ground turkey for this recipe...maybe that was the problem. I don't think so, though. It was bland...the veggies were raw and the consistency didn't work with the dish...the cabbage got way to wilted during the cook time. It was just a mess and it didn't taste good. So, this one's never happening again! I don't recommend.

My husband and I were a little skeptical about this recipe, but we loved it. There is definite flexibility as to the veggies, meat, and spices you can use. Here is what we did: 1- Browned the ground beef with some onions and seasoning and placed aside to drain. 2- Sauteed onions and garlic with dry Italian seasonings. 3- Added yellow squash, zucchini, and cabbage for a few minutes. 4- Added broth, tomatoes, and some chantarelle mushrooms (because we had them), and simmered until veggies are tender. 5- Stirred in the meat and some brown rice already cooked. 6- Put the mixture in the cabbage, put on the bread crumb topping, and baked. It's not 4 forks for me, because the cabbage cups themselves were not always easy to eat. But we will make this recipe again for sure.

I'm not a huge fan of cabbage but my coworkers are huge fans of giving me cabbage from their gardens. Lucky for my Polish boyfriend :D I pretty much followed the recipe to a T except substituted carrots for the zucchinis (no zucchinis here). I thought it was okay but boyfriend raved. At least it gives me a quick solution during cabbage season!

We had this in lieu of a turkey for thanksgiving. Minced turkey and canadian wild rice, along with the onions, eggplant, zucchini, and parsley went into the stuffing. The cabbage leaves we blanched with the potatoes we were boiling for garlic mashed potatoes...yum! We had more filling than cabbage leaves, so we stuffed mushrooms with some of the remainder and simmered them in a little olive oil and chicken broth. We made a few into meat balls that were thrown into the tomato sauce with the stuffed cabbage, too. We had extra zucchini and eggplant too, and those we roasted in the broiler with a little olive oil. It was more than enough for 5.

I tweaked the recipe to reflect what I had at hand and the fact that I eat low fat/no white flour/low calorie: bison instead of beef (lower fat, better taste), dried herbs, etc. I also nixed the eggplant and added fat free cream cheese (couple tablespoons), fat free cheddar (shredded, couple ounces), and about two tablespoons of parmesan to the filling. I didnt make the crust, but tried to substitute garbanzo flour mixed with smart beat lite, and while it didnt spread, it did make for an interesting crusty element where it got dabbed on. I also added a small amount of a brown/wild rice mix to stuffing. We came up with enough for at least two meals for two people.... definitely a satisfying comfort meal, easy to tweak how you want--would probably be good with corn kernels, turnips, maybe peas....the cabbage didnt cook all the way, but if you like the crunch that doesnt matter. I think this would be a good variation on rolled up stuffed cabbage, when it gets nice and sweet from being fried up.
