I've made this for years - usually substitute sausage for the tasso - 2 tsp of cayenne will kill most of your guests/family; be prepared to cut this WAY down for most folks. But everyone LOVES this dish - it never fails to be fancy awesome!!!

I made this last night and while the flavor was fantastic, the "heat index" was too high for even a person that enjoys spice. I recommend cutting the cayenne way back for a more balanced flavor. Also, I substituted olive oil for the butter.

As a Tulane Alum, I've eaten my share of Jambalaya - good and not so good. This was one of the easiest and tastiest I've ever made. It'll be a staple in my Mardi Gras file!!

This dish was very good, with a couple of changes, which is why I only gave it two forks. After reading the reviews, I cut the red pepper to a fourth of what was called for and it was perfect- there was heat but not too much. We like spicy food, but the full quantity would have made the dish inedible. The second change I would make is to cover the rice while cooking-- I left it uncovered, as per the recipe and at the one hour mark, it was still very raw. I added more water and then covered with foil- after another 30 minutes, it was fine. The flavor was very good though and my family says they want it again so overall, it was a success.

I love this dish. I've made it many, many times with some changes that some might consider significant. A few of the changes make this taste more to my liking, others just make it faster and easier: I substitute Andouille sausage for the tasso; instead of mixing my own herbs and spices I use 2 tablespoons of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute; I make sure to use only chicken thigh meat and I use a whole pound; instead of peeling and chopping tomatoes, I strain them from pre- chopped canned tomatoes; finally, I use brown jasmine rice. It's delicious!

Quick and easy to make - even better the next day!

This is the best recipe I have come across short of just going to Lafayette, LA and going to my "cajun source". I substituted the tasso with some Parker House Sausages, cooked the rice and then added it to the mixture to be baked. You don't have to cook as long and I don't like crunchy rice. Never had leftovers when I cook it.

I thought this jambalaya was good, however, I had to add cumin, garlic powder, and tony chachere's creole seasoning after taking out of the oven. Maybe it was mostly to get rid of the overwhelming tomato flavor. Being from Louisiana I am very familiar with what the flavor should be like and this was a tad bit off.

What else would you make for Fat Tuesday, why Jambalaya of course! This recipe was the BOMB! I did cheat a little and used Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning in place of the ground red pepper, salt, white pepper and black pepper. I used some left-over ham I had in the freezer for the Tasso (but I think I'll try and find that next time). I also used about 2 cups of smoked sausage with the chicken. It's winter in Cincinnati and hard to find flavorful tomatoes, so I subbed a can of Red Gold diced tomatoes with Chipotle seasoning and next time I'll use the whole can instead of just 1 cup. Awesome flavor, my teenage son couldn't get enough.

Paul Prudhomme is the man! I have yet to make a recipe of his that I didn't absolutely love. His Louisiana Kitchen cookbook is the only one on my counter and this is my favorite Jambalaya recipe. I will admit that it will light you up if you follow his recipe verbatim, but I'm a chilehead so I either follow it or add to it. I did decrease the cayenne pepper for my Mom the last time she was up and it was bearable for her. I liked the ham (used the Cure 81, as I couldn't find tasso), but it gave a bit of sweetness to the dish. I prefer using Andouille or some other spicy sausage in place of the ham, but either way is delicious. I may try both next time. I highly recommend that you try this recipe out, crank up the heat, and enjoy!

Fantastic. We must have delicate tastebuds here in the midwest - I cut the spice down to 3/4 and it was perfect for us (very spicy for some guests). Didn't have tasso and used ham. I'd like to know what the difference would be?

I couldn't find tasso so I used country ham. Maybe it is saltier than tasso, because the recipe seemed too salty to me, even though I left out about half the spice mixture. Next time I will add salt to taste.

This is my new jambalya recipe-yum. I read it this afternoon and made it with what I had on hand: chicken breasts and fresh chorizo. I cut down on the cayenne and the white pepper and cooked the rice separately, added a little liquid to the pan while it simmered separately. It made a rather large potful, so I can freeze some. This would make a great buffet dish. Thanks for the tips everybody.

We made this dish for our gourmet group at two different houses, and only 5 of 20 people could eat it because of the spice. I adore hot food and it was at the upper level of what I could take. But the other reviewers are blaming the cayenne solely--I think the tasso ham is just as much to blame, and I see most of the people below who didn't think the dish was spicy substituted sausage or another type of meat. The tasso we bought were small pieces very heavily coated in spice, and with the high amount of caynenne, you have to love it HOT to tolerate the dish. If you love it REALLY hot, prepare the dish exactly as specified. To make it more palatable to a range of guests, use half tasso and half regular smoked ham and cut the caynenne by 25-50%, or try subsituting andouille sausage for the tasso and cutting back on the caynenne.

I never thought of myself as a jambalaya fan until now. This is a great version. I halved the pepper and it still had quite a kick to it. This can be made ahead and then reheated, covered with a bit more stock, just before serving. I could not find tasso in all of Cicinnati so I ordered it online from New Orleans. I was glad I hadn't tried to substitute anything for it, as it really made the dish.

Cut the cayenne in half for starters. I used red and yellow peppers in place of green and it added some nice color. I see no reason to use converted rice.

Very easy one-pot meal! I altered the recipe somewhat adding 2 links of hot Italian sausage, regular smoked ham and added at the last minute a handful of raw shrimp. I also used leftover chicken instead. I did have to add more liquid. The 2 tsp of cayenne was a bit too warm so I would cut that back to 1 tsp and I tend to love heat in my food. This can be made easily on top of the stove in a dutch oven with the lid slightly askew. I just cooked it on med-low. Defintely would make it again and it made plenty.

I tripled this recipe and baked it in two 9x13 dishes, and it worked very well. While I tripled the recipe, I only doubled the cayenne, and it was still on the edge of being too spicy for many of my guests. I would recommend 1 tsp. of cayenne instead of 2! Other than that, everyone loved it!

I really liked this Jambalaya! It is very spicy though and I like spicy food. But I think mine may have been extra hot from the Habanero chili sausage I used instead of the Tasso. I also added a chipotle chili as well so I guess I deserved the heat. I will make this again. It was pretty easy and doesn't make a big mess in the kitchen.

With no time to go to the store, I had to improvise. I used about six pieces of bacon with some of the fat trimmed off instead of the tasso. No tomatoes so I substituted a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes, drained. Turned out pretty tastey.

I have a group of friends (with many different tastes) that get together every week and try a new recipe, this is still our favorite!! It was a little spicier than anticipated but with a little less pepper it is still very flavorful and much easier for the wimps to handle.

I followed the instructions but used leftover turkey instead of raw chicken. The dish was one-dimensional and that one dimension was intense heat. I think there must be a typo. If you use relatively fresh cayenne pepper, two teaspoons is way, way too much. I would cut this at least in half.

This is a very good jambalaya recipe. In our house, we add another teaspoon of chile-- chipotle to go with the cayenne, because otherwise, it's a tad bland for our tastes, and the chipotle compliments the dish with it's smokey flavor. We also reduce the amount of celery a tad-- we're not real celery fans. I can't imagine anyone thinking it's too hot!! My suggestion: eat more chile!

I'm going home to make this for the fourth or fifth time. Vary it any way you like. I add different kinds of sausage, with or without the ham as called for. Use all of the cayenne, and fire any friends who can't handle it! You shouldn't be dining with them anyway.

Good, but not great. It was a little too spicy and the flavors a little "muddy".

I love this recipe! And I use all of the cayenne pepper. For those who can't stand the heat, serve with a side of plain yogurt to mix in. It takes away some of the bite but none of the flavor.

AWESOME! I too reduced the amount of all peppers to 1/3 and it was fantastic....to NOSEMAN....if you are such a doofus to make a recipe without reviewing the ingredients, you deserve what you get....still to Beefaroni or whatever in in your class....

I reduced the cayenne by 1/4th and the heat was still over-whelming - but through the tears I received rave reviews. I cooked the rice separately to reduce the cooking time (30 minutes was perfect). I will definitely make this again - but next time with only have the cayenne.

Everyone in my family loved this and I have made it many times. I use Basmati rice and add tarragon and rosemary to the seasoning mix. Also I use a turkey sausage and a spicy beef sausage instead of the ham (1 cup each).

I think this receipe is great. A little spicy but still very good. No trouble with the rice either..... Next time I will use slightly less cayenne....

This is a wonderful recipe!! Others' reviews made me apprehensive about the cayenne so I cut the cayenne by half and found the finished dish not too spicy, even for my mild taste, and very flavorful. My family really enjoyed it (and we're all spice wimps) and I can't wait to make it again. My sister has a jambalaya recipe she's very partial to but even she gave this one a big thumbs up. As for the rice issue mentioned in this last review- I didn't experience that problem, I think the rice came out just right.

YUCK-way to spicy and I cut down the cayenne, also way too salty. YUCK-the rice was hard and I cooked it for over one hour. YUCK-need I say more.

I don't know how anyone could rate this recipe just so-so. I grew up in Louisiana so I'm quite accustomed to spicy food, but if you're not just reduce the amount of red pepper.(!) This is a wonderful recipe and if you appreciate wonderful food you should try it. Thank you chef Paul!!

This was fantastic! yum, yum, yum! We loved this dish -- I admit, we didn't have tasso on hand, but after seeing it on TV I wanted to make it. I used smoked ham instead and it was great. A definite keeper!

Being from Louisiana and accustomed to spicy food, my family and I were eagerly anticipating this dish. Much to our disappointment, it was WAY TOO SPICY. We couldn't eat it. I think it would have had a nice flavor, but the pepper drowned it. I MIGHT try it again, but with a lot less cayenne.
