This was really nice and refreshing salad. I used apple cider vinegar because it was all I had. A nice change from the conventional salad.

Love this. One of my favorite salads to make on the fly!

I didn't have Champagne vinegar so I used Tarragon vinegar. In my opinion this salad needs something sweet to offset all the bite (apples?). I love radishes, shallot, and Dijon but the combination was a bit too much. Also, we bought butter lettuce in the spring but the leaves were a bit more bitter than usual adding to the bite.

I happened to buy some locally grown radishes this weekend and had two avocados that needed using and ran across this recipe during a search. I wouldn't have thought of pairing radishes and avocado, but this was a winner of a salad. Both my husband and I were delighted with the light fresh tasting result--crispy radishes with creamy avocados, and the dressing is the perfect complement. I didn't have butter lettuce, so used boston instead, which produced the same rose presentation (lovely), but will definitely look forward to trying it with the more tender butter lettuce. I used a combination of basil, tarragon, chives and oregano for the sprinkling of herbs.

Dressing is nice and light, and pairs well with the avocado. I didn't want to buy all the herbs, so stuck with fresh chopped oregano and it turned out nicely.

Love the dressing, love the avocado. Light and healthy.
