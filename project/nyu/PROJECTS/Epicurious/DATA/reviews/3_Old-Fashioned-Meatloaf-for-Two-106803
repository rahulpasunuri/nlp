I followed everyone's advice and in addition added about 1 - 2 tbsp of parmesan cheese. I also cooked it 35 minutes instead of 30. In the future, I'd probably use 1/2 of an egg and 1/2 cup bread crumbs and add more dry spices. But, overall, a good stand by.

I followed recipe to a tee rather than trying variations, It was simply delicous.

I took the advice of the other reviewers and added breadcrumbs and an egg. It was still a pile of mush. Neither my children nor my husband were willing to eat it. This is not a keeper.

This is a basic meatloaf recipe. I added 1/4 cut water and a heaping half cup of rolled oats, dash of HP sauce and 1/4 cup catsup which is the way my mother used to make it and it was much better the second time.

I added garlic salt and mushrooms to this recipe. It was the best meatloaf that I have ever eaten!

Pretty good. I took the advice of other readers and added chopped mushrooms, garlic, 1/4 C breadcrumbs and an egg. It came out a little soft though so would probably add even more breadcrumbs.

This was good with a few additions/changes. Added 1 egg and 1/4 cup breadcrumbs. Also accidently put in way too much onion (about 1/4 cup, maybe more) and a couple cloves of garlic, minced. I liked the way it came out, plus it was super quick. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and yellow corn for that "TV Dinner" effect. I'll make it again.

I made this recipe and my husband and I both agreed that it is lacking. It definitely needs something like breadcrumbs or pork, or some additional flavors. I will try a different meatloaf recipe next time.

this recipe looked so sad without a review. Anyway, it's a very good basic meatloaf, and the right proportion for a couple. Cooking time was right on. Don't be afraid to play with the recipe and add mushrooms, breadcrumbs, other sauces, or whatever.
