My family loves these crackers. They are addictive and go great with soup. And they are indeed fun to make with my preschooler. Definitely do not re-roll leftover dough - the crackers do get tough. Better to carefully place your cookie cutters to maximize the yield the first time around.

While I wouldn't make THIS recipe again, I will work with it to try to come up with a recipe I do want to make again. These crackers have a subtle cheesiness that is not bad, but I was looking for a more pronounced cheese flavor that wasn't there. Having said that, I watched my husband eat them by the handful, so they weren't that bad. Because the dough is slightly springy, it is difficult to roll out as thin as I'd like, but I was able to get it pretty thin... I think removing the eggs or baking powder might prevent the end product from rising... I was hoping they would be flatter and cracklier; they were puffier and softer than I wanted. I might use more butter next time and I'll probably experiment with strong cheeses... I'll also try adding cayenne pepper to give it some zip. Also, it's true that you can't reroll the scraps... they are too rubbery to reroll. But that didn't stop me from baking the scraps... which made a fun dish of snacks after all the crackers were made. I also doubled the recipe; using a 2-inch biscuit cutter I got 3 dozen crackers and a bowl of scraps out of my doubled recipe. Obviously you don't need animal cracker cookie cutters. I also poked some of the crackers with a fork (because some cracker recipes ask you to do that) but it didn't seem to make a difference whether I poked them or not. I thought I'd add that so you don't waste your time trying, like I did.
