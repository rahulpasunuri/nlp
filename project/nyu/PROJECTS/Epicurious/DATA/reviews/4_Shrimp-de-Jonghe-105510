Ok - just made this tonite. And it was wonderful - great recipe! I tried because I had left over shrimp I wanted to use, but my husband said he would like it even if I did it from scratch! Like a few other folks, I did more garlic and added some sherry. But it was scrumptious! Some of these "old" recipes are awesome!

I made this as described. As a side note, there should be an abbreviation indicating that we followed the recipe so the rest of us would not waste time reading through a review where the cook made something completely different. Something like IFTR. Just my 2 cents. So, yeah, I made this for a birthday party and it was a big hit. The bread crumb mixture is a winner. It could be used with other meats/fishes as well. In the future I would make more "dressing" as the shrimp way out number.

My first husband's Chicago area family introduced me to this, their favourite shrimp dish. I am thrilled to have found this again some twenty years later! Try cooking the rice with a can of beef consomme for a wonderful layered taste to the meal, and serve the shrimp on top. Lovely memories from a wonderful family.

Well my parents said they liked it but I think they were just trying to be nice. . .I thought it was pretty bad. Definitely not worth making again. There are so many better ways to eat shrimp.

This was a great recipe. After checking several recipes on this site for Shrimp De Jonghe I thought I would like to try the original one. I did add more garlic, halved the butter with olive oil, and omitted the Mace. (couldn't find it in the grocery store here in the Netherlands). I did add 1/4 cup sherry to the mixture as the other recipes on this site both called for it. It was really tasty, easy and got a 4 fork salute from my dutch husband. I know this recipe will be requested again soon.

AMAZING RECIPE - Made this for my dad's bday party and got RAVE reviews. I believe there was one breadcrumb left. Will make AGAIN!! Delicious.

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was fabulous. My family is already asking me to make it again. Great because it can be made ahead of time. I used panko for the bread crumbs which I think helped give it nice light topping. A little sherry would be a delicious addition.

Don't let the simplicity of this one fool you into thinking it's nothing special. Impressive presentation when served in individual oblong ramekins. I use large prawns, about five per person is all you need, you would pay $20 per for the same dish if dining out. Yummy!

My husband is from Chicago and kept talking about this dish. I had never heard of it and searched high and low in all my recipe books to no avail. I was so thrilled to find the recipe on your website for the "Original" and surprised my husband with it. We all loved it and will definitely be making it again. I couldn't find all the fresh herbs at my grocer so I used bottled ones and the flavor was just great. Thanks for the great recipe - I'll be coming to epicurious.com first from now on!!
