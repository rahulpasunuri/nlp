This was a pretty good recipe that was easy to make and pretty inexpensive. But I thought the espresso taste was a bit too strong and would suggest using a bit less. I had already made the custard, so I added some homemade whipped cream within each layer to lighten up the espresso taste.

I have made this recipe many times for differant affairs. It is one that people want me to bring all the time.

I made this recipe for some very food-savvy dinner guests. As I brought it to the table, the gentleman asked me where I had gotten the dessert! It not only tasted outstanding; the presentation made it look like the fanciest of restaurant desserts.
