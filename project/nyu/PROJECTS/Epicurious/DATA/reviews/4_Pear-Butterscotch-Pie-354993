EASY and DELICIOUS!! What more could anyone ask for. This is definitely a KEEPER, a no-brainer, and absolutely everyone loved it!! This will be served at my next dinner party, followed by Thanksgiving. YUMMY!! (I, too, will add one more pear).

I love love loved this pie. The dough is really easy and delicious, if a little tough. I will add at least another pear to the mix next time I make it. But I'll be making it again. It was a big hit with my husband and my in-laws!

Not a keeper, turned out a bit soupy and the butterscotch flavor was barely there.

WONDERFUL, DELICIOUS!! So easy, too, and what a surprise to serve to guests. Warm pear pie with ice cream - yum!!

My 17 year old daughter made this for Thanksgiving dinner. It was really easy and everyone loved it (we did cut the nutmeg in half and found that to be PLENTY). The family is requesting this pie again for Christmas. A definite winner!

Made this pie with apples instead of pears(we went apple picking over the weekend). Perfect!!! I actually increased the spices since we like a spicy pie. The brown sugar adds a great flavor. This is my new go to pie recipe.

Very good and easy pie. The pears are very mild, did not have a problem with the nutmeg. Used a pre-made Pillsbury crust, as I have rotten luck with pie crusts, but it tasted special with the egg wash and sugar on top. Family was very happy.

quick and easy. Taste a lot like apple pie. Pears are a lot easier to prepare then apples. Brought to party and was a hit. Will serve it with carmel ice cream next time.

My dad asked me to make this pie because he, like me, was very excited about the pear/butterscotch combination. Overall, the pie was good but I felt it was too heavy on the nutmeg which caused any flavor a butterscotch from the brown sugar to be overpowered. It was definitely a crowd pleaser nonetheless.

Wonderful pie! I can't believe I never thought of baking pears in a pie before this. The all-butter pastry dough had very nice flavor.
