Delightful use of garden squash, onions, and thyme. Cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp. My daughter also thought this dish was amazing. It's going to make the school lunch box. That's high praise.

Delicious, hearty recipe that makes a tasty side dish. Agree with the other reviews that say add more thyme. I also found that I needed more time in the oven before I removed the tin foil - otherwise it got too brown before the texture became firm enough to serve.

Rating: 3
Tasty, but not sure it was worth all the work. I used a mandoline, but it still felt like it took forever to make, between the slicing, assembly, and cooking. I agree with the review that called for additional cheese. And I had to broil it to get it to brown. At least it made two pans, so I have leftovers to eat tomorrow!

I've already made this recipe twice - it's come out perfectly and been a hit both times. My mouth waters just thinking about it! Yum! I didn't change a thing about this recipe except maybe to add a little bit of extra of the cheese mixture :)

Rating: 4
It took some time to prepare this because I do not have a mandolin. I also forewent the two 8" cake pans and just made it all together in a large casserole pan. Finally, I don't have fresh thyme in my garden (an oversight!) so I used dried. It came out wonderfully. I took it to a get-together and everyone raved and requested the recipe. Great way to use up a lot of squash. People also couldn't believe that it had no cream in it. I have been requested to make a second batch.

Very tasty as a simple dinner and perfect for brunch. I halved the recipe and made in one pan. Also, to get the torte to hold its shape, you really have to press it into the pan. I didn't and the slices didn't keep their shape. They tasted great, though.

This was very good. I added chopped basil, rosemary and parsley from the garden and grated sharp cheddar cheese in with the parmesean. I used five medium sized Yukon Gold potatoes and three large crookneck squash and layered it all into an 8x8x2 dish. It worked perfectly. Topped with sliced ripe tomato and green onions. Perfect with a vinegary salad ( I did a green bean, cherry tomato, pine nut, basil, olive oil, white wine vinegar, garlic mixture...yum!)

We've made a zillion of these with the abundant squash from our CSA share. Vary the squash, add a layer of onion slices, change up the spices, whatever suits you. I think the key is evenly sliced potatoes, whether superthin or not. My knife skills are terrible, but I bought a mandolin just to make this dish!

This was a good brunch dish. I added more spices also. Make sure the potatoes are sliced thinly. I used asiago on top and it was great!

Rating: 0
I took a page from some of the reviewers notes and added addition spices. I added chopped fresh oregano, parsley, sage and rosemary between the layers. I also used Asiago and Parmi-Reggiano cheese. I layered it in a spring-form pan which made a great presentation. I thing keeping it simple with great fresh ingredients will score 4 forks every time.

You can do a lot with this recipe. I've added chopped, raw swiss chard to the layers, used regular baking potatoes, substituted chopped vidalia onions for the green onions. I've also varied the pan sizes and used smaller or larger amounts of the various ingredients. This always works out well. The two things that I never change is the use of a good parmesan cheese and fresh thyme.

Rating: 3
I made this in a casserole dish so i would have to make it in two pans. The result was a bit thin but thats good if you want this to be a side dish instead of the main course. Also, I used spanish onions instead of green. I thought it tasted great, although my father said it was way to salty.

Rating: 3
To be honest, I wasn't expecting much of this and only made it because I was in the mood for potatoes. It was delicious! I went a bit heavy on the thyme and used a bunch of fresh basil. I used tofu ricotta cheese instead of parmesan, and in the last 10 min poured over a soymilk thickener for the texture of melted cheese. Turned out nice--will definitely make again.

Very disappointing. I added more cheese and threw in some more spices but it still didnt do any good. I also had to bake a lot longer than the recipe called for

I made it last night and it was very well recieved. Not time consuming at all except for the baking. The flavors really blend together well.

This dish tasted delicious, but I did make some alterations. I used 4 varieties of cheese (parmesan, feta, drunken goat, & dill havarti), and I added a finely chopped jalapeno and serano pepper to the cheese blend. I also added roasted red bell peppers to the top for color. Next time, I will cut the potatoes more thinly.

Rating: 4
Delicious! The potatoes and squash were melting-ly tender, and the flavor was great. I used an artisan Sage Cheddar since that's what I had on hand, which added a little extra creaminess. Also, instead of baking the second tart, I assembled and froze it for later.

Rating: 4
I have to disagree with everyone who said this was terribly time consuming. I love this recipe because it is somewhat "complex" yet so very simple. Just get out your food processor! I didn't peel the potatoes and just sliced them. Same with the summer squash, and I added zucchini and one white onion (I didn't have green). Then, in a different processor bowl, I grated in the parm, salt, pepper, 4 cloves of garlic fresh parsley and basil, then put in the mixing blade and added the flour before mixing it all together. EASY! Layered it up (I added sliced tomato to the top because I had one - adds color) in two cake pans and followed the directions - perfect. This is such a great way to serve squash and zucchini - a lovely side dish or vegetarian main.

Rating: 3
Made this last night on one of the hottest days of the year. Probably not a good idea, since it really heated up the kitchen, but there are leftovers! Made with zucchini and dried thyme, and a little hot pepper sprinkled on top. Broiled at the end to make it crispy. A nice accompaniment to grilled fish. Easy to vary with other veges and herbs. Not time consuming at all, except for the time in the oven.

If you're going to make this in a different sized pan than is called for, make sure it has generally the same surface area: pi * r^2 * 2 pans == 100 sq. inches for two 8 inch round pans. An 11x17 dish has nearly TWICE that surface area, so it's no wonder there weren't enough ingredients to go around. I'd sub a 9x9 (81 sq in), or a 9x 13(117 sq in) pan if you must

Rating: 3
This is good and not hard but somewhat time consuming. I made just one torte that used most of the squash but not all the potatoes. We didn't find this too salty but when I make this again I'll add more herbs, maybe basil as suggested earlier.

I added a little bit of basil and loved this recipe. My boyfriend, who is slightly picky, loved it as well.

I made this recipe due to an abundance of squash in a friend's garden. I didn't have any parmesan, so I substituted feta cheese....yummy! Don't know that I'll ever try it with the parmesan, or any other way after this, as it was so delicious. I saved the leftovers and ate them for lunch the next day. I'll be catering an outdoor rehearsal dinner, and this is definitely on the menu.

I added some basil and crumpled goat cheese to enhance the flavors in the dish (based on previous reviews that it was too bland). Also used a bit less salt than the recipe called for, and I was very happy with the result. Served it with a simple salad, and it was a very nice light summer dinner.

Too little for two pans. I used a little less squash and potatoes and fit it all in one pan. I feel like it needed something more - maybe something creamier like goat cheese.

i wrongly assumed, when i read the recipe, that this torte might need some extra seasoning when served, but i was surprised at how well the flavors blended to create a really well-rounded dish. (be sure to use freshly grated parmesan and *never* that sawdust in the green can.)

First: I hate squash. My husband likes it, so I try to regularly sneak it past my tastebuds, and this is the dish that did it. I used lots of cheese, and sage because that's what I had on hand. It was so tasty that I'll be making it for a party on this weekend.

Rating: 1
This looked so good in the picture! I did my best with the proportions given I don't have a kitchen scale, and used a 11x17 baking pan as someone suggested. Overall, it didn't seem like there was enough cheese or other good stuff to make a tasty dish--when done, it was primarily just the potatoes and squash on their own. This dish was incredibly unexciting for how long it took to bake. What a disappointment.

Sub'd zucchini for the yellow squash, used half parmesan and half shredded semi-soft Spanish cow milk cheese (it's what was in the fridge). Topped with sliced tomatoes. Everyone loved it.

I've made this twice already as a main course for vegetarians. It's simply delicious! I use one 9x11 glass baking dish. It works out just fine. I think this would also be a good side for grilled meats.

I've made this several times. It's now my favorite way to have potatoes and summer squash, although it takes a long time, in my opinion. I've made it with zuchini, including a light green kind that is especially good in this recipe. I usually just use regular onions instead of scallions. I've found that I have to weigh the potatoes and squash after peeling/end-cutting to have the proper ratio.

This was delicious! I made it in one 9-inch cake pan but otherwise I followed the recipe. It came out wonderfully. A must try for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.

Wowie! As I was slicing and dicing with my mandoline, I muttered to myself, this had better be worth it! And boy was it! A definite example of gestalt cooking -- he whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Per other reviewers, I sliced the potatoes a bit thinner than called for, and the squash a bit thicker. This left me with too many potato slices and not quite enough squash. Fortunately, I had more on hand to add. I, too, used dry thyme, at half of the amount of fresh called for, and brushed the olive oil on instead of drizzling. I'm not sure that saves any oil, but it certainly gives you more control over its distribution. I used the recipe amt. of salt, and we did not find it too salty. Perhaps it's a matter of the type of Parmesan used? Some are more salty than others, I think. We used Parmeggiano Reggiano. I can't wait to impress company with this dish!

Rating: 1
I had more ingredients than what I could fit into a cake pan, so I used a long pan. Since I doubled the recipe, I also doubled the salt. The result was a complete disaster!! I had a very very very salty potato/veggie gratin. It was so salty I threw the whole thing out. I'm making this again.

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was great as is. No more or less salt required. My husband, who usually dislikes "cheesy" things, actually thought more parmesan and some additional herbs would be nice. Anyhoo, while the produce is abundant now, I'm gonna freeze a couple of these babies for future reference.

Rating: 2
The thyme was a bit overwhelming and it needs more salt than called for. It looked just like the picture when it came out. I will make it again this time with a bit less thyme, definitely more salt (or maybe salt the potato layers directly), and maybe increase the cheese a bit too.

this is simple and delicious. i disagree w/previous postings about it being too salty -- i wouldn't omit the salt. i added parsley, rosemary, and pinenuts to the cheese mixture. also, the thinner you slice the potatoes, the better -- i used a mandoline and had great results...really lets the top and bottom layers get good and crispy.

I liked this alot and so did my meat lovin hubby. We had it for dinner with some roasted asparagus. I added more oil (mine is infused with rosemary, thyme and garlic from my garden) and wayyy more cheese...like three cups and it was good. If you cut your potatoes thin enough you will not have to boil them at all (that might lead to having too much water in the mix),mine cooked perfectly in the time suggested. I'd add garlic next time and more salt, but that's it...very good.

i am thinking about using 1-2 large eggs in the cheese mixture. and parboil the potatoes. everytime i make a potato casserole, the potatoes are under cooked. then cook in a pyrex and slice in squares and serve a an hor doeurv. what do you all think about that? & of course add garlic, might use yellow onion instead of green.

Wonderful dish! Definitely use only a tiny bit of salt, or skip altogether. May substitute rosemary or marjoram for the thyme. May substitute zucchini for some of the squash for more color. No need for cake pans, and no need dividing the potato pile into sixths - I have made it in one large pyrex dish (as well as 2 small square pyrex dishes, yes I am a repeat offender) and it was just as yummy.

Like previous cooks, I used this recipe as a guideline and put it together "to taste" using minimal oil, omitting the onion, adding more cheese, and Herbes de Provence. It was a hit, and I've been asked to make it again. Versatile dish, makes good leftovers.

I wish I'd taken one of the earlier comments to heart--this is too salty. The problem is the parmesan, which adds salt. Next time I'll cut down or completely omit the salt. Otherwise, this is a very nice side dish. It's not the prettist thing I've ever put on the table (the colors are a little dull), but the textures are good and the thyme is a nice element.

Don't know what all the fuss is about this receipe. I made it for my dinner guests and I agree it didn't look anything like the picture. It was also too salty and too peppery. I suggest cutting back on the salt and pepper. My guests either loved it or hated it. My husband hated it. My sister loved it. I would NOT make it again.

Rating: 3
Great dish although it didn't look quite like the picture! I don't know why but I only managed to get 2 layers of potatos & zucchinis in each 8" pan instead of 3. It was still delicious! I couldn't find crookneck squash so I substituted zucchini. I also added a layer of sliced leeks and spread some toasted onion chips in with the cheese. I used garlic olive oil to drizzle over each layer. This dish was very tasty and I could see how it lend itself to lots of different variations. Everyone agreed though that it was the leeks that made it! Enjoy! (we did!)

Rating: 3
As with many other reviewer, I used the recipe as a basic "guideline" for construction and added a few of my own elements. I interspersed layers of potato, squash, leeks, fresh basil and thinly sliced tomatoes, upped the parmesan cheese content a bit, and added finely minced garlic and a little cayenne to the cheese mix. Yum!!

Pretty good. I'm one of those people who can't leave well enough alone, so I added a layer of vidalia onions and two layers of shredded jack cheese. I also added dry mustard as well as the cayenne recommended by another reviewer to the parmesan mix.

I thought this dish would be better given the reviews. I mostly followed the recipe, but added one garlic clove, just misted the olive oil and used a 9 x 13 pan.

Maybe it's one of those dishes that's better the next day...

just made this recipe. It didn't even put a dent in my surplus of summer squash. used VT cheddar cheese with parmesan. Baked it in my trusty seasoned cast iron skillet (browned up nicely) It's tasty,but I'll admit Iate it with a little ketchup on the side (homemade, of course) to jazz it up. Oh, I also used basil instead of thyme.

I've used both sharp cheddar and gruyere (which is perfect for this dish), plus vidalias instead of green onions. Also slice a couple fresh East Texas tomatoes. This is a great dish because it lends itself so well to substitutions and whatever's fresh, as the other reviewers can attest.

Made this with potato only, and did in a 9" springform pan. I added salt and pepper to the cheese mixture, and used a "misto" to spray the olive oil on the layers instead of drizzling it over. It was very tasty. Next time, I will try it with sour cream like another reviewer suggested, that would make it truly sensational.

Outstanding hot or cold. I added sour cream as one person suggested. It was amazing even as a midnight snak. Instead of squash I used some zuccini from my garden and added sun dried tomatoes and basil to the cheese mix. Scallions instead of onions. A quick, unfussy make!

I thought this dish was very bland. I must have gut my veges too thick, because I found the cheese/herb mixture to be too scarce. Next time I would add garlic to the mixture, double the fresh thyme, perhaps add a little oregano, make a parmasean/pecorino cheese blend, and be sure to salt and pepper each layer just to liven things up. I am also curious if you could make this in a spring-form pan for a nicer presentation.

This was heavenly!Used small, unpeeled red potatoes and zucchini;had no green onions, so subbed a couple large shallots and chopped chives with Greek Oregano, both from our herb garden.Two things I would do differently next time is slice the zucchini slightly thicker - maybe 1/5" and brush the olive oil on to use less -like everyone else I need to eliminate the extra fat calories when possible.To those who haven't yet tried it, you're in for a real treat!

I thought this was quite delicious (3 1/2 stars). The kitchen aroma was incredible as this baked. Rather than making two pans, I cut the recipe in half. Not possessing a mandolin slicer, my slices were a bit thicker than 1/8 inch. So instead of six layers, I only had three adjusting the cheese mixture accordingly. Oops, forgot the topping of green onions. Still yummy!

This was a really good dish and reheats very well. I think it's very important that fresh parmesan is used as this is such a key component. Also, I chose a selection of fresh herbs from the garden - thyme, sage, summer savoury and parsley and one shallot.

I used red new potatoes and zucchini, and substituted pecorino romano for the parmesan. The amount of oil called for in the recipe seemed a little skimpy, so I added more. Unfortunately, the whole torte became very slippery and didn't hold together for slicing. The flavor was delicious, though!

No Yukon Gold potatoes in the market, so I used russets instead. Delicious addition to our beach picnic (along with rotisserie chicken from the deli and an arugula and tomato salad) Very easy to make ahead of time and re-heat later. I agree - mine didn't look as colourful as the photo. I was able to cut neat slices but the colours weren't so vivid. We transported the torte to the beach in the cake tin. The flavour ? Delish ! Not a scrap leftover. Definitely a make-again.

I made this for a Memorial Day party and everyone loved it. Making it ahead worked out great and was a lot easier for entertaining. I doubled the recipe and used 1 8" dia pan and one 9X13 and ran out of potato slices but I think I sliced them thicker that 1/8". For additional flavor, I used more green onions than the recipe called for and I used fresh parmesan.
