I love this recipe. My wife and I have made it for the Super Bowl every year since we first saw the recipe in Gourmet back in 2001. The beef is really tender and flavorful and the cornbread topping provides a great textural contrast.

This recipe has flavor that never quits. My whole family loved it and I can't wait to make it again. I substituted ground chicken for beef, Anaheim peppers for jalapeno chiles, extra corn and added chopped red pepper for color in the cornbread. I cannot say enough great things about this recipe!

Holy tamale pie! We made this last night and we both plowed through it. But this is another reason that I love it: I used 1-pint souffle ramekins for two individual servings and after topping them, there was just enough left over for a 6-pack of muffins so now I have leftover chili and cornbread to go with it! The recipe worked fine for muffins; I just kept them in the oven at the same time. This reaches new heights with a little sour cream as an accompaniment. I didn't have enough beef to do the whole thing, so used some pre-cooked carnitas and the meat from leftover ribs from the freezer to supplement and I preferred the pork to the beef, as it was already fall-off-the-bone tender and the beef never got there, even with extra cooking time.

very very tasty.

I use coarse ground beef to save time. I omit the green olives, too. Easy to prepare. It's chili, so the ingredients and proportions can vary and it still turns out great. A very tasty and satisfying comfort food. The best part is watching hungry teenagers inhale it.

Since I don't know what Tamale pie is really supposed to taste like, I can only rate on how I liked it. The pie came out perfect and tasted good. I did increase the seasoning, however, as I felt it was not enough. The topping was also ok and made the whole dish look exceptional.

Took a lot of prep time. Spicy and flavorful, a bit too much for a lot of people. If I make again, I will reduce the amount of cilantro called for.

I made this a few nights ago, and it was OK, since I had toned down the heat in the recipe. We had the leftovers tonight, and it was so dry and lifeless that we hated it. I would not make it again. Too much work for the outcome, and there are better chili recipes out there. Also, there are better cornbread topping recipes.

I think this is a good solid chili recipe. That said, I've taken to making the chili without the tamale topping the first night, but making the tamale topping for reheating the chili -- the removes the taint of 'leftovers' and makes the meal a bit special again. I do think the whole thing is good eneough to be worth the effort -- just not on a busy weeknight.

I agree with everyone else in that it's quite a lot of But work for a one-dish dinner. But once you're there it's definitely worth the wait. I used jar jalopeno's instead of fresh and threw in a combination of pork and chicken and it's fantastic. Definitely going to be one of my favorite comfort foods for winter.

This was okay. I agree with others - lots of work for a one-pot dinner. Used extra-lean ground beef. Would sugget stewed toms as opposed to the ground with puree - found it a little dry. Used buttermilk for the biscuits - lite and fluffy.

I loved this! My husband thinks it should be a little spicier but other than that everyone, including my 2 children loved this!

This was a delicious dish -- more of a chili with a cornbread top. It is a lot of work and I think the secret is simmering for at least an hour so that the beef is tender.

It was a lot of work for what I considered a not very flavorful chile or tamale. Seemed bland and dry (both the chile and tamale).

Totally yummy! Of course I had to tinker: I used ground beef and left out the olives. The leftover filling will be great in burritos later in the week.

This dish was just delicious and unusual. The topping was particularly light and tasty.

This is fabulous, good enough for company food. I agree with the previous reviewer that the beans should be doubled. Be sure to use a deep baking pan and leave plenty of room--the expanding dough caused some major oven overflow on mine as it cooked. I put the jalapenos and cilantro in the food processor with the corn meal before mixing the dough, until they were chopped ultra fine. The biscuits came out looking just like the picture!

I took this to a pot luck supper and it received rave reviews. The corn meal biscuits on top added to the presentation. I definately will make this one again.

Surprised at how good this was. Used it for an informal company dinner and it received rave reviews. This will become one of our standbys.

The chili was good; nice and spicy, but we didn't care for the biscuit topping. Would definitely make the chili again, but would serve regular cornbread or cornmeal muffins on the side instead of the topping. One can of black beans didn't seem like quite enough, so next time would use two cans, or one can of black beans and one can of pintos. The cocoa powder added nice overall color and richness to the chili.

just ok, didn't like the corn meal biscuits on top.

This was a great meal. Took a while to prepare, but well worth it. I would contest the serves eight part though. I would say more like serves three. Would definately make this again, it was fantastic.
