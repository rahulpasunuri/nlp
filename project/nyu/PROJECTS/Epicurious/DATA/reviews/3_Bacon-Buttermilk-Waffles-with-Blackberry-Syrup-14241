I don't know why people didn't like this recipe, I thought it was fantastic! Light perfect waffles with a bacon aftertaste and a delicious blackberry syrup, what's not to love?

I thought it was very good. Not as good as yeast waffles, true, but darn good nonetheless. I used 7 slices of bacon, and added 1/2 tsp of black pepper for a little extra kick. Had it with regular maple syrup. I'll definitely make these again.

A disappointment. Overall, the dish tastes OK but for all the preparation, one expects something special. This was not special. The taste of bacon was minimal in the waffles, and with the addition of blackberry syrup, the minimal bacon taste disappeared completely. (Better to have bacon on the side) The waffles were OK but rather dense; yeast waffles are lighter and taste better.
