Great flavor and texture! I also did the rice in a box with no seasoning as suggested and purchased roasted red bell peppers in jar for time saver. Do let the rice and veggie mix blend for a bit. I also did increase the vinegar and spices in the dressing. Would be beautiful with bbq shrimp skewers for a crowd/entree salad.

It sounded good and looked very nice, but I just didn't "get" this recipe. It has too many textures: crisp, crunchy, chewy, leafy... all mixed together in one bowl, and none of the ingredient flavors blended particularly well. Just a plain spinach salad would have been more enjoyable.

This is a wonderful salad. I cut the amount of oil in half, but so far I have not increased either the vinegar or the spices. I usually squeeze fresh lemon juice over just before serving. I use the Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice (one box exactly right) and just prepare according to their directions, omitting the seasoning packet. Everyone loves when I make this salads for dinner parties or barbecues.

Elegant and delicious. Would suggest making dressing ahead of time for flavors to meld. Amiable mixture of flavors. Interesting textures togher. Triple amount of vinegar. Double spices.
