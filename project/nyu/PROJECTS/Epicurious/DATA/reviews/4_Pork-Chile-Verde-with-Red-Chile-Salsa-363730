Made this 2 days ago -minus the potatoes- and it was delicious. Used a pork loin roast, next time might try pork butt. Just used some store bought fresh salsa. Added sour cream on top and ate with flour tortillas. The following day made burritos with the leftovers, added some rice. So good. Rather time consuming with lots of prep, this is a weekend meal for me.

Made this for a large group to rave reviews. I used a 7oz can of chiles for the 3/4 cup called for as I didn't have the time or energy to roast my own. I made it the day before and warmed it up before serving. It came out great. I also made the red chile salsa and those who ate it liked it. It is definitely a new go to recipe.

Great recipe. I modified the dish to make it work on a week-night and with what I had on-hand-- a rotisserie chicken from whole foods, and it worked out fabulously. I got the pork flavor by frying 3 strips of bacon first, used the drippings then added the chopped bacon to the dish with the chicken. The pre-cooked chicken saved me time; I just shredded it and added it at the same time as the potatoes-- took about 20 mins to soften the baby reds and warm through. I just I also added some summer squash I had on-hand, and accidentally forgot the garlic-- doh! I also added juice of half a lime at the end to brighten it up, and used jarred salsa to top it instead of the red chile. It was an easy weeknight dish and really flavorful!

This is so delicious! Mine was a little thin because I used a smaller piece of pork, and because adding the potatoes did not appeal to me. Not a problem, I just simmered uncovered for the last 45 minutes or so. Roasted the green chiles on the outdoor grill, and I think I used 3 anaheims and 1 poblano. May have ended up with more than 3/4 cup diced, but it didn't matter at all. I did not make the red chile salsa, but served alongside tortillas, sour cream, cilantro, and a choice of a few red and green hot sauces.

I've made this recipe twice and omitted the red salsa, adding pico de gallo instead. Next time, I will definitely omit the potatoes or substitute hominy, as the potatoes seem out of character and, even after an hour and a half of simmering, still weren't thoroughly cooked.

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly as described and ended up with the best chile ever! My family loved it. I would recommend making at least some of it ahead. I made the salsa verde ahead and refrigerated it overnight before continuing. Either way, I would highly recommend this to anyone!

This is great! I ended up making it the day before serving so it sat in the fridge overnight and got even better! I would skip the red chile salsa, though, and just add regular hot sauce if you need some heat.

Long prep time but a very simple recipe to make. We have made it several times, once with chickpeas, and it is great every time. The red chile salsa elevates it to another level.

I am looking at your active time estimate and have to disagree with it. Call me slow, but the time it takes to cut the pork shoulder and make the salsa verde could burn through an hour! Not to mention roasting chiles and then peeling them. I really wish the times given were realistic. I know I can be a perfectionist, but this recipe takes a lot more time than an hour to get in the pot.

I typically do not like pork chile verde but this recipe has changed my mind. The pieces of pork are tender and flavorful, and the potatoes are a nice addition and keeps it from feeling too heavy, too "meaty". This would be great in tortillas, maybe we'll try that next time!

Wow! Loved it, Made with a combination of hot and mild Hatch chiles from a can. Definitely will do again!

Excellent recipe. I stewed it (covered) in the oven at 325deg for two hours, and added hominy (instead of potatoes) for the last half hour. Skipped the red salsa based on previous reviews. I passed extra roasted anaheim peppers if people wanted more heat. No left overs!

Forgot to say,take care when making the red chile salsa that goes with this recipe. Both the chiles and garlic can burn quickly so use your nose and not your eyes as your guide!

Jeanne Kelley comes through again! Main suggestion for next time is to double the recipe. Made it with my stock of tomatillos from the freezer (last summers bountiful harvest). I did substitute a roasted Poblano chili for the milder variety and used a piece of the trimmed fat to "oil" the pan for browning the pork. Simmer time could be shortened a bit-as the meat was definitely falling apart tender at the end of 2 hours. We liked the Red Chile Salsa but can understand the split response. Next time I would cut the amount in half as we had a lot left over. Definitely serve with sour cream and toasted corn tortillas. Salad with a honey/citrus vinaigrette and avocado is a great addition to a winter comfort meal.

Thought this was pretty good. The red chili salsa was a bit watery for me but added interesting flavor. My husband did not like it though. He liked the rest of the chili even though I never added any additional salt! Not sure I loved it enough to make again. But I tend to fall on the side of making something new rather than repeating.

I made this per the recipe except I left out the potatoes. I also used canned diced chili's (7 oz can = 3/4 cup per recipe)instead of roasting fresh chili's. I also used the Red Chili Salsa which did add an extra element of taste, but wasn't absolutely necessary.

Great. I am not a pork fan and loved this. I would use a leaner cut next time and just use less meat. Too much waste and labor involved in trimming a raw boston butt. I was also lucky to have some New Mexico Green Chili's on hand. I also skipped the Red Chili Salsa but added about 1 tablespoon of Agave Nectar at the end to balance out the spicy tartness. YUM! I won 3rd place in a Chili Cook Off with this last night!

We did not make the red chile salsa, but we made the pork chile verde. It was really good and we like to serve it over a breakfast burrito or even just over scrambled eggs.

This chili is delicious. I made it basically as written (except that I put it into a slow cooker on low for the day, and then added the potatoes and cooked it on the stove for the last 30 minutes). We really thought the red salsa added a great depth of flavor to the chili. I served this with sour cream, and handmade corn tortillas. Next time I am going to roast the tomatillos, onions and garlic on a cast iron comal prior to making the sauce (just to see if this will add another dimension to the flavor), and I might add a poblano or jalapeno to add a bit more heat. The chili was even better the second day. I'll second the comment to only heat the ancho chilis for a couple of minutes, as mine didn't get much lighter, but I could smell the chilis as they got hot.

Great dish! Many compliments

Very, very good chili, especially after a few tweaks... I added 2 TBS lime juice and a TBS of MSG. Also I doubled the amount of salsa verde and heated through in a seperate pot to take off some of the rawness of the green onions and garlic. Well worth doing since the whole lot was used up as a condiment which added zing to the dish. Finally, I pureed roasted, skinned and seeded poblano chilis as a condiment to add some heat. Next time I'll double the basic recipe as it ran out quickly! Oh, and skip the Salsa and Potatoes, they add nothing.

This is delicious, and I'll definitely make it again! I kept waiting for the anchos to turn light orange, so burned the first batch of chiles making the red salsa. They only need to cook for two minutes; any longer and they're going to be burnt and bitter-tasting -- and never mind what color they are). The second batch was perfect, but it absolutely needs to sit for a couple of hours for the flavors to develop. While the dish is fine without it, the red salsa really adds depth and complexity. I'll probably skip the potatoes next time and use either chickpeas or hominy which will make it more like a pozole, but there will definitely be a next time.

Chile was fantastic. Only simmered 1.5hrs, as I didn't want the meat to fall apart. The potato although odd, tasted fine. Next time I'll substitute hominy and make it more of a pisole. DO NOT MAKE THE RED CHILE TOPPING!!! It went right into the garbage. It doesn't add anything, and tastes awful. Totally fine on it'sown.

I'm in the process of making this dish, so haven't yet tasted the chile, but I just tasted the salsa and do not like it all. When I fried the dried chiles, they never turned light orange, and I ended up frying them for 6 or so minutes (b/c I was waiting for them to turn color), so I'm wondering if maybe I overcooked the chiles and that's the problem? Did anyone else's chiles turn orange?

This was fabulous cooked exactly as written. I thought the red chile salsa was fabulous. I've never added honey or cinnamon to chiles, so I and my dinner guests raved about the flavor. I saved some time by buying park pork shoulder roast and part boneless country style pork ribs. You need to have some fat in the meat. I served it with a large green salad and cornbread made with cheese and jalapenos.

Fantastic flavor. A bit time consuming prepping the ingredients, but worth it. Would agree that the red salsa was not that good. Next time I would add less honey as it was too sweet. This is also delicious served over brown rice.

I roasted 2 Anaheim peppers and put them in with the rest of the puree for the salsa verde. My butcher cut me a portion of pork shoulder about 5 lb with the bone, and this seemed to be just the right amount. This took about 30 minutes to cube, and remove excess fat and connective tissue. Couldn't find Mexican oregano, so I just added 3 bay leaves instead. Used what I had. Served with tortilla chips and garnished with only cilantro. Also, used low sodium chicken stock, about 4 cups total.

What an amazing recipe! I made this the day my Bon Appetit magazine came in the mail. I didn't make any changes/substitutions, following the recipe to the letter. This is SO flavorful, and relatively easy to make. It was even better the 2nd day. The only suggestion I have is to make sure you really trim the pork as best you can so you don't have a lot of grease. On the flip side, the Red Chile Salsa that is optional wasn't very good. No one in my family felt it added anything to the Chile Verde, and actually had a very odd flavor. I will skip that next time. Enjoy! So tasty!
