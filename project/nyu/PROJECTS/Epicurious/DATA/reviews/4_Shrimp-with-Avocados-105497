This is a great light, fresh dish for summer. The other reviewers are probably right about the oil. I used the whole cup of vegetable oil and could easily have done with less. If I try making it again I'll use a 1/2 cup of olive oil.

Maybe I initially overcooked the shrimp, but I think marinating for over 24 hours creates very overcooked shrimp. I think the marinade continues to affect the shrimp - like a cerviche. Other than that, it was great!

if you like celery seed, this is a fabulous dressing. clean, not sweet, not too vinegary. used chicken not shrimp. it was great. may try the dressing on cole slaw.

Love it. This dish has become of our our regular meals. My wife doesn't care for shrimp, so for her I substitute chicken (dark meat works better), or cubed cooked ham.

This was the most bland dish I have ever made-and yes the avocados get yicky after a few minutes. It was easy and do ahead but did nothing to make the shrimp "tasty"-I used top quality shrimp and felt the oil was not only to much but too bland. Perhaps some lemon infused olive oil? something- but it was a waste of excellent shrimp-yes I am a food snob

This was a great make-ahead dish! Light, tasty, elegant, and a feast for the eyes.

My family loved this! And it is elegant...especially if you use red onion for color. I agree with past reviews regarding the oil...I used 1/4 cup olive oil, added a dash of lemon juice, and it was just right. I served the shrimp in an avocado half, leaving the lettuce underneath as a salad. (My father-in-law picked through the serving greens to find the shrimp pieces, and my husband now wants the dressing to appear on more regular salads.)

This was absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was the oil - I used 1/2 cup olive oil instead, and it could probably stand less. I served it with mixed greens, wrapped in a warm tortilla, alongside a buttermilk potato salad. Yum!

waayyyy to much oil - i only used 2tbls and i used salad shrimp instead of going to the work of peeling and cooking them.

I have made this several times, once for a tapas party and it was the favorite thing at the dinner. The only unfortunate thing is the avocados get gross so only add them to what you will eat immediately and save the rest.
