Didn't do it for me. The sauce was just not flavorful - the cumin and the carrot don't mesh, and despite attempting to fix it with salt and pepper, it still turned out only so-so. I didn't have wings so I did chicken thighs, which turned out fine. But do without the sauce

Maybe it was obvious t everyone else, but it wasn't until I served the wings that I figured out that the purpose of the brine soak is to infuse salt into the wings. With a 8-hour soak, the wings were too salty for me (husband and son liked the salty - but they do). I served the sauce on the side, which didn't work. Perhaps tossing the cooked wings in the sauce would have been better. The wings-and-sauce didn't seem to really relate to each other. It was an interesting experiment, but not one we'll repeat.

A spicy, delicious dish for anyone who likes a little zip with their wings. I'd recommend definitely barbecuing versus broiling for added flavor. One warning: make sure you wash them well after brining or they're way too salty!!

I made these wings & the Chinese 5-spice wings for a church picnic 2 years ago.Everyone loved them and keeps asking for them over & over.
