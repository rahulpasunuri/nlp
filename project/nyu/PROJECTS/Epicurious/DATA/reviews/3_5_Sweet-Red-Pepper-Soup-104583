This was a hit. The prep is easy, though takes a fair amount of time with the roasting. We have heirloom italian sweet peppers that we needed to do something with, and this was the experiment. As it so happened - a couple peppers in the bag were actually hot, but this added a surprise element of flavor. Absolutely delicious outcome. Topped it with plain yogurt and fresh chives. Will be making this again.

I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken, and yogurt for the sour cream. Nice with crusty bread on a cold winter night!

Those frozen roasted peppers from last summer now have a higher purpose and check this -- a two minute prep time! I used fresh garlic, poured from a container of chicken stock and dropped in the frozen roasted peppers. Now the puree is heating on the stove with a 1/2T of olive oil and some salt and it promises to be amazing. I think I will toss in some frozen yellow and white corn for color. I am serving it with shrimp steamed in their shells with Old Bay.

It doesn't say so explicitly but you should also discard the charred skin you scrape off the pepper.

I probably shouldn't be critiquing this since I didn't technically make it but I did make a red pepper soup that was inspired by this recipe that turned out amazingly well. I only had a few of the ingredients called for in the recipe so I had to use a lot of "duffers" but it still turned out very well. Once I make it to the grocery store I'll definitely try it the way its written.

Great taste and great color (particularly around Christmas time !). Before serving, I tasted the soup and, though very good, I thought the sweet taste lacked complexity. So I added some tabasco (any hot sauce would do) just to give it a bit of a kick. Everyone loved it. As for roasting the red peppers, I've got an easier way : cut in half lenghtwise, discard seeds, lay skin side up on baking sheet, brush exterior with olive oil and put under your broiler. Keep an eye on the peppers and remove them when their black. Put in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let stand 10 minutes before removing skin.

For a little extra flavor, I added a tablespoon of home-made pesto, and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Turned out AWESOME!

My husband and I made this soup and he thought it would be awful, but we thought it was wonderful. Although roasting the peppers was a chore.

Very tasty, low fat, quick and easy to make. My husband hates soups because he hates foods that float. He loved this.

Awful. Tastes little more than a pureed sweet pepper.
