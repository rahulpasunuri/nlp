I was really disappointed with this one. For all the different fresh herbs in it, the flavor was rather lackluster....and I even added more cheese, which didn't really do anything for it except increase the fat content. I don't think I'll be making this again. Now, with all of those excess herbs in my fridge, I guess I'm making roast chicken...

Sorry to dissent from the general view, but I thought this was dreadful. A mouthful of chopped raw herbs (I used sage, thyme, basil, parsley and tarragon)sitting on top of slabs of pasta did not go over. Luckily, I served it with kale sauted with lots of garlic and, with that sauce mixed in, at least the pasta was edible.

I made this recipe as part of a New Year's buffet. It was devoured in a flash with absolute rave reviews. It was worth the time it took to 'prep' as I was able to freeze the unused herbs for another time. Next time I will use dried pasta for convenience and cost.

This is superb without homemade pasta but so good I will make the pasta myself next time. Good for winter or summer, as a light meal or as a first course. The herbs, oil and tomatoes are very flavorful and together create a unique sauce. To those not counting carbs, try it with bruschetta.

This one of the few dishes I rate four forks, and I am basing that on the next time I make it, when I will make my own pasta and user herbs and tomatoes from my garden. Using the no-boil lasagne pasta as I did, along with fresh and frozen herbs and (good, imported) canned Italian Plum tomatoes (no additives, just tomatoes), it was superb. It was fast to prepare, and the results merit homemade pasta. This is great either as a first course or as a light meal. To those not counting carbs, try it with bruschetta.

Not reviewing because I haven't made this yet, but to answer San Jose's question: "No boil" noodles means that you don't have to cook them before putting them into a lasagne (for example). The noodles continue to cook in the baked dish, so if you are not making something like a lasagne you have to cook the "no boil" noodles the rest of the way. BTW you can slap plain old lasagne noodles into a lasagne without cooking them, and if you make sure they are covered with enough sauce they will cook beautifully.

Noboil lasagne sheets are much thinner than regular lasagne, so the effect would be much heavier.

I believe the point of the no-boil lasagne as opposed to reg. dried pasta is that the lasagne sheets can be broken into large 'rag-like' pieces ("Pasta 'Rags' with a Thousand Herbs")

Question, and I hate to sound stupid why is there a need to buy the no boil pasta sheets then boil them. Can you not use regular dried pasta?????

Oh Wow!. This was absolutely dellicious! I used the no-boil pasta sheets and store-bought fresh herbs. I can't wait to make it with my own home grown herbs. This dish is worth the putzing around you have to do.
