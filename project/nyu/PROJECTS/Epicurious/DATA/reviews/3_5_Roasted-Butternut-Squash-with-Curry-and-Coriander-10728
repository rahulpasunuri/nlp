Delicious. I roasted it, tossed with cilantro, and served over brown rice with Greek yogurt for a vegetarian dinner. I can't wait for the leftovers!! Mine took a little longer to bake.

This was a wonderful combination, when finished I put it over mixed greens with arugula, goat cheese and balsamic cream...mmmmm

This is so simple and elegant, absolutely perfect with tandoori chicken and mango reciipe here as well. Will make again and again.

I'm not really a squash lover but had to get rid of some that came in our CSA box. This was not too bad although I think if I'd cooked it a bit longer, the brown edges would have been nice and caramelized.

Unsalted butter is a must for all recipes. The salt in the butter hides impurities in the taste and the product is less than perfect. When you use unsalted butter it also allows you control of how much or how little salt you choose to use, as well as giving superior taste. :o)

I cook all my veggies this way, using a variety of seasoning sometimes as simple as olive oil, balsamic vinegar (after they're cooked) & salt and pepper. A sharp knife is the secret to most cooking jobs like peeling squash. Find out where your local chefs by their knives and get them sharpened (Northwestern Cutlery on Grand in Chicago just west of Halsted both sells excellent knives and sharpens them PROFESSIONALLY too.) The other tip for this recipe is to use cookie sheets when roasting veggies. You may have to do it in batches, but the browning/efficient cooking that you get with a single layer while cooking is worth it.

Fragrant while baking! Tastes good. Why the specific request for unsalted butter since this dish needs salt? I made the mistake of using a pan not large enough to hold the squash in a single layer. As a result, after 25 mins, the squash was still hard.

Great flavor. I followed the suggestions of others and microwaved the squash first. It was very mushy and hard to dice. Next time I will not pre-cook.

Excellent, we all had seconds. I baked the squash halfs first, then diced and seasoned and baked again. It was good with and with out the coriander.

Very tasty. My mother requested this side dish for Christmas dinner. It is more for the adventurous, the elders did not care for the curry. Cooking tip, par boil or microwave butternut squash wrapped in moist paper towel, it is easier to peel and cut.

I have made this recipe many times. It's a keeper in our home.
