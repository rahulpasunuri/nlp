This was surprisingly good, considering that I thought it would just be good cold-weather fare. I only changed it slightly: used 1 cup of vegetable broth, 5 cups chicken; used two pears; used about 1/2 cup Golden Sherry. The sherry is a nice touch. The barley took about an hour to absorb the broth.

Even after cooking for almost an hour, I still had soup instead of risotto. I drained off almost a cup of excess liquid and then it was fine. Next time I will start out with 4 cups of stock and add more if needed. I didn't have a pear and I substituted a few hundred grams of white mushrooms and some red wine because that's what I had but it still turned out fine.

I tried this recipe because I had some left over chicken from stock that I had just made and had a hankering for barley. I had to leave out the mushrooms and pear because I didn't have them. I also used the chicken fat to (replace oil or butter) that I had removed from the stock (used the homemade stock too) Other than that I followed the recipe. It was wonderful and my husband loved it. It has gone into my keeper file.
