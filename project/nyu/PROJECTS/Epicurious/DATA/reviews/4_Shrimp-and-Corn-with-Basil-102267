Nice recipe when fresh corn is in season. Like other readers, I added, pepper flakes, garlic, and a squeeze of lime at the end. Next time, I will try adding fresh tomatoes.

Delightfull, and satisfying. I took others advice and added the garlic,pepper flakes, and the avacado at the end.Oh, and also spritz some fresh lemon on it. So easy, I will be making this weekly during summer corn season.

I love making this recipe! It is so simple and the results are so good! I usually increase the amount of butter though to about 3 tblspns and also use about a lb of shrimp to feed four. Highly recommend this recipe for a quick weekday meal!

Great way to really appreciate the taste of fresh corn and shrimp. Used caramelized leeks instead of green onions and I would do that again, just add even more. Taste is very light but good. Might toss in a few drops of Tabasco next time. Be sure to season with good salt. Serve it with a green salad and a good Chardonnay--lovely.

This is an amazing combination. My preparation is slightly different. I also use more butter and a bit less scallions. Definitely use fresh corn. I once tried it with frozen, it doesnt work. You need that fresh uncooked starch sweet taste of fresh corn. You can make it year round if you buy the fresh packaged and husked corn from the produce section. Rather than cook it all at once, I sauté the shrimp (lightly salted) and the scallions in some butter. I remove the shrimp from the pan when its just about done. I then sauté the corn in some butter for a couple of minutes, adding some basil towards the end. To finish, I add the shrimp and cook about a minute longer, adding more butter if needed. Salt, pepper and basil and you are done. Non stick pan is nice for this, but I hate the look of food in them. I generally use a large regular AllClad pan. Some of the corns starch browns at the bottom, but who cares.

I loved this recipe! It was so easy to make but still had robust flavor. I will be making this again!

This is my husband's favorite summer time recipe. We've made it several times and never change a thing. It's simplicity and ease are what make it so perfect for a weeknight dinner!

We all love this recipe. fresh corn and basil are essential, and I always throw in a tsp of crushed red pepper flakes. Serve with crusty french bread and very cold white wine- yum!

So disappointing...If I hadn't made some modifications (jalapeno, red onion), I would have given it just one fork...It wasn't terrible but we were expecting much more...

What could be better--fast, relatively healthy & delicious. I added garlic as suggested below, used half butter & half olive oil, didn't have fresh basil so substituted half fresh cilantro & half dried basil & used frozen corn. A reminder of summer on this first day of winter!

We tossed it with soba noodles because we didn't have crusty bread - - it was really delicious, even better than I expected. You must use fresh corn!

With a lot of modifications, this is pretty good. Added garlic, red pepper flakes and roma tomatoes and served over romaine w/ red onions and dressed with a white wine vinagrette. Needed a punch of something, but couldn't figure out what. Maybe lemon/lime juice?

This is marvelous! Ina Garten has a recipe for fresh sauteed corn and shrimp, which is good, but this is better!

I didn't enjoy this recipe the way I'd hoped. I think the green onions were peculiar--the rest of the dish was sweet, so the onions put me off. My husband liked it more than I did, but I won't make again.

4 forks just for the ease and speed of preparation, not to mention flavor "freshness"! Definitely saute some garlic in the butter. Great base recipe that you can add whatever fresh veggies you have on hand. Red pepper flakes add a nice kick too.

Wonderful! Tastes Great, Looks Great, Super Fast & Easy! I think the texture & flavor of fresh corn really made this stand out. I wouldn't change a thing - simple & tasty. Got rave reviews.

Wow - I was skeptical about this recipe because it seemed so basic... but it was fantastic! Based on other reviews, I added a clove of garlic and some red pepper flakes, and used only 1 T of butter (which was plenty - can't imagine adding more). I used a can of sweet corn from Trader Joe's, and it worked great. Easy, healthy, and delicious - we'll be having this a lot from now on!

This is the very best kind of recipe: quick, easy, healthy, and delicious. I subbed red onions for scallions and added garlic and minced roasted red pepper, all to good effect.

This is a great, very easy and unusual recipe. It looks very pretty on a plate if you also add cherry tomatos and green beans at the end.

When the corn is in season, this is incredible. Seems so simple, but very flavorful (although I do add garlic, diced red bell pepper, and a few red pepper flakes).

This simple dish becomes truly wonderful when made with fresh corn. Frozen corn is good in a pinch. It's not as fabulous but perfectly OK for a quick weeknight supper.

Wonderful and very fresh. I added two small red hot peppers as suggested - thanks for the idea. Very simple but tasty. Easy and nice enough to make regularly.

My boyfriend and I were really impressed. We usually go for buttery, garlicky shrimp - but this was light and so good. Added a hot pepper, a little garlic and a chopped tomato to top it off. Served with goat cheese croutons to mellow the spice of the pepper.

This was excellent. I added 2 more ears of corn , a diced red pepper along with the sacallions while stir frying . Then topped with cherry tomatoes (cut in half) from the garden. Wonderful light summer dish.

Bland tasting.

on french bread this was fantastic with a few generous shakes of hot red pepper and a generous bit of dry sherry. otherwise, too bland for my taste. just my style: healthy and delicious!

Fabulous. So easy and fresh. Took me 10 minutes. I also carmelized leeks and threw them in at the end instead of the scallions. Worked beautifully. Also, remember to scrape down the cob with the back of the knife to extract all the flavorful corn milk.

Very easy and very good. To spice it up I added sauted garlic, red pepper flakes, quartered grape tomatoes,and half an avocado. Excellent

My expectations were not high, since this recipe seems so simple. Also, when I went to the grocery to buy the ingredients for this recipe, I discovered that they were all out of scallions. So, I bought a bunch of leeks which I carmelized. I also added some vegetable broth, because it seemed a little dry. It was absolutely fantastic, perhaps the best dish I have made yet.

4 forks! So easy. So tasty! I know it looks a little too easy to make, and the ingredients look too simple... but this is the purist's dream. I added cubed avocado to the recipe because I had it laying around. Served on Romaine hearts. Definitely making this again and again!

Excellent and easy. I get Butter & Sugar corn in season for this recipe. The quality of corn makes a difference, for sure. The taste of all these fresh ingredients is soooo good.

I thought this recipe was great -- fast, fresh, healthy, easy and delicious. I've passed it along to friends and family members and we've all made it several times to great acclaim. I think the secret is the freshness of the ingredients, particularly the basil.

Tthis recipe is healthful, easy and kind of dull. It would probably be infinitely improved with the simple addition of one minced hot chili pepper such as a serrano.
