I made this on Saturday and we all loved it. The chicken was moist and flavorful; the cress with the pan dripping dressing and croutons perfect. I didn't serve anything else and the meal was perfect - not too heavy and 100% satisfying. I'll definately make it again and highly reccomend it.

made this today for easter dinner. everyone loved it. the lemon flavor was quite pleasing. i brined my birds over night.... infusing more of a lemony flavor. prehaps the previous reviewer didn't let them sit in the brining liquid long enough?? i don't think it needed any carbs along side at all, the croutons were more than adequate.

I changed to arugula because I had it on hand, and it was a delicious salad. It's worth making for the salad alone. The chicken was tender and juicy, though not as lemon flavored as I wished. Because it's brined, it doesn't need to be basted at all. The baking time was insufficient, added 10 more minutes. Served with roasted new potatoes with olive oil and grainy mustard.
