Did this EXACTLY as recipe stated and it was delicious! Brought it to a dinner party as a side salad and it was a hit (and I have some very picky friends). Would do it over and over again. The only thing I would say is that getting the oranges segmented is a bit tedious but it is well worth it. It took me longer than the 20 minutes prep that is stated. Other than that....it is an amazing salad!

This salad is so easy and tastes amazing. It also looks really elegant with great colours. I don't use the sunflower seeds or the oranges because I don't like them. The dressing is so fragrant - I usually only use the tarragon and basil - but it's definitely worth trying different ways. It's also a very cheap salad to make if you buy the spinach and raspberries at costco or somewhere else in bulk. I make this all the time and love having leftovers for myself!

Followed directions and thought this was a terrible salad. The dressing was way too strong with the raw garlic and the raspberries and red peppers did not compliment one another.

Very tasty and has a beautiful presentation. I thought the dressing was a lacking a little something, so I will probably try to spice it up a little more next time. It was the first thing to go at fathers day brunch.

Wow was this a fantastic salad! We made it as the salad for our Easter dinner, and everyone just loved it! I did make a few minor changes, we used half spinach, and half mesculin greens. the store didnt have raspberries, so we used strawberries, and added an apple. I also used dried spices, but went a little light on all of them; Still one of the best salads and dressings I have ever had! We are planning on making it again this week.

Excellent. I think adding carrots and bell pepper is too much when you are serving veges, etc. with a dinner.

I added a little chopped celery, carrots, cheddar cheese and BBQ chicken breast. I want to try roasting the red bell pepper. Everyone loved the raspberries. A great main dish salad.

I have made this salad several times now; it certainly makes a hit each time everyone raves. It is beautiful, colorful and delicious! Even the kids who normally wouldn't touch a salad tried this one and went back for seconds! What does that tell you?

only 2 points if you are a "weight-watcher." i reduced the vineagar a tad and got away with less honey and oil to make it even better! a keeper!

Delicious! Also used pine nuts, they were a great sub for the sunflower seeds. I also used some raspberry vinegar with the balsamic. Yum!

I had to sub pine nuts for the sunflower seeds, but that works also. The dressing is wonderful.
