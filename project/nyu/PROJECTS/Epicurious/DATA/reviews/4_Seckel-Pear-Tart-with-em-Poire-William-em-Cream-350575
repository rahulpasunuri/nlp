On the first bite, this caused some moans at the dinner table... That said, it was worth the work. This is a very delicate dessert, rich in flavor yet light. I made it in the rectangular shape and the presentation is spectacular.

Made this for New Year's and it was exceptional, though not without issues. Agree with previous reader that pastry cream was runny and with weight of pears and crunchy dough... well it a bit of a challeng to serve elegantly. Having said this, flavours were exceptional and got rave reviews. I will save this as part of my treasured recipes list, however will tweak pastry cream recipe next time to make it hold better. More cornstarch? Warning: remember to save 1/3 cup of syrup for the glaze if you're doing this in stages.

I made this tonight as a trial for an upcoming party. It was good, but I do feel like the past reviews are correct. I think it would be much better if made individually. The crust was too crisp/crunchy for the filling which was more like a pudding and there was no proper way to serve it. I couldn't find Seckel pears so I substituted Bosc, and I also skipped the poire William. My husband enjoyed it, but I felt it was lacking a bit.

The tart has such a wonderful pear flavor. I did made one additional to the pastry cream to lighten it. I fold in half a cup of whip cream made the pastry cream lighter and smother.

A dazzling crowd pleaser with excellent flavor. It's no secret this recipe takes at least 4 hours, but I found it easy and worth the effort for a special occasion. I prepared everything but the glaze one day in advance and followed the recipe (except I used 6 small forelle pears). The pear flavor is strong and overall it is a refreshing dessert, not too heavy or rich. Minor complaint is that this pastry dough recipe didn't work for me and I re-made it using the Gourmet Feb 02 version. Serving is tricky because the pastry cream is not a custard and is semi-liquid while the crust was rather hard. It was difficult for guests to cut it neatly themselves, so if I make it again, I would do the serving or use individual sized tart pans.

I made this for a very special celebratory birthday dinner. It was a smash hit! Instead of making one large rectangular tart, I made 6 individual tarts in metal tart pans with removeable bottoms. One tiny glazed Seckel pear sat on top of each tart It was a beautiful presentation and as good as it was pretty I would love to post a photo. It presents much prettier than the one you have on the site.

I followed this recipe closely, but not exactly and ended up with phenomenal results. The only 2 changes were the fact that I couldn't find seckel pears at my local supermarket, so I used the next best thing- fiorellos. I also didn't get the poire william. The pear tart ended up with a very intense and pleasant pear flavor. My dinner guests were floored. Seconds were to be had. I felt it was very much worth the effort. I think the key factor is getting the best produce possible. I will try this year with seckel pears as my new local supermarket carries them. The problem with seckel pears is that they often come unripe, so you should buy them a couple of days in advance to ripen at home before use. Also use ripe bartletts for maximum flavor. I think with that advice, you can't go wrong with this recipe. That being said, I think this recipe would work great with any pear variety. Note: Like me, if you can't get the poire William, just use some of the reserved wine/pear mixture and combine that with the gelatin. It works really well!

This recipe will surely get you rave reviews. It is so beautiful and the sweet pastry dough is amazing. Yes - I agree that it is a lot of work, but you can always cheat a little by doing a quicker version of pastry cream. I used instant vanilla pudding powder and added 1 cup of 2% milk and whisked together. Then fold in some whipped cream until you get the right consistency. You can still add the Poire William to get the pear flavor. Follow everything else exactly and you will get a gorgeous and delicious tart. I have made numerous pear tarts and this is by far the best one.

I made this recipe last year for Thanksgiving. The only changes I made was that instead of making pear juice, I bought pear juice at a health food store & that I made my own pear brandy. I also added a tablespoon of pear juice to the glaze & the pastry cream.

My friends always do the Gourmet Thanksgiving menus. And then we vote on the results of each item. The pear tart was all looks and no action. I great deal of work for little flavor.

This tart is yummy, but not great. It's got a nice subtelty to it, but nothing really puts you over the edge about it. But the one thing that makes me batty about this recipe is the amount of TIME it takes to make. WAY too much time for a finicky pear tart. The amount of time it really takes to make something like this is really 5 hours with about 2 1/2 hours active time. The Poire William was a fun addition and makes a great display in the liquor cabinet, and I think the best part of this recipe experience is the conversation starter that I have with the pear in the bottle. (You DO know how they get the whole pear in the bottle, right?)

This was good, not great. It looked wonderful but was missing something. After I poached the pears I did not have enough liquid for the sauce and the glaze. I added more water, orange juice, and extra pear brandy to make up for it.

Well, unlike "A Cook from New England", I followed the recipe exactly and LOVED it!!!! Except that I didn't have any pears, so I used onions. And I was out of poire william, so I used V-8. And I didn't have an oven, so I made it in the microwave. It makes me nuts when people give 3 forks to a recipe they didn't follow and they then tell you how it would have been better if they only... hey... how about following the recipe!?!?! Maybe that woulda been better. OKOK I'm done. Just had to vent. I'll be all right. Thanks for listening.

I'm a bit of a pear tart fan, so I was excited to make this. I found a great deal on seckels at my local market (bought enough to fill up my pockets, which, with big pockets, is a lot of pears). 1. I loved the poached pears. I would consider just poaching seckels in the poaching liquid and just eating those. You know, in a poached pear emergency, or something. 2. I appreciated the ease of the pastry cream, which came together easily. I didn't have a vanilla bean, so I used vanilla extract with good results. I did not have poire william, but I did have pear vodka and used the same amount. I don't think it was a bad swap, but it was a little boozy. I think if I did that again, I'd only use one tablespoon of the pear vodka. It brings in the pear flavor nicely, but 2 tablespoons is too much (of course, I could just buy poire william, but this was sort of spur of the moment, what with the pocketful of discount pears and whatnot) 3. I didn't have any gelatin, so I mixed a little pear vodka with a dollop of apple jelly and warmed it until it became liquid, and brushed that on. It tasted good and I think it achieved the same goal. 4. I had the wrong size pan. Rather than use a big round tart pan, I used a 9 inch pie pan and 9 poached pears. 5. I really liked this, even though I changed just about everything. I think I'll stick with my pear and almond tart recipe that seems to be a winner at my house. I think I'll swap in the pears from this recipe, though, as I like their flavor better.
