One word...AMAZING! I served this with our Easter ham this year. It was also good with grilled pork loin.

This is quick, easy, and excellent. Everyone loved it.

Substituted clementines for tangerines. Did not take membrane off each section (far too time-consuming). Instead, i cut the sections up finely, drained them and added other ingredients as per recipe. The results were satisfactory though a bit more sweet than I like in a chutney. This recipe could easily be halved for a single dinner.

I never thought I'd be writing this review, but this stuff rocks! Finally was able to use the jar of apricot pepper jelly someone gave me years ago, followed the recipe exactly (except for the peeling of each individual tangerine section, which was NOT going to happen this Easter), and was astounded by the complexity of the taste. It was the grated tangerine peel that pulled it all together, a perfect blend of sweet, citrus and hot. Pressed for time as usual, I substituted one can of tangerine segments in juice, drained for several hours per the recipe, and they worked just fine (saved the denuded tangerines for brunch the next day with that terrific mango ginger sauce elsewhere on Epicurious). I'm always leery of making full recipes of these relish-y things, because they always make too much and wind up getting tossed, so I'd cut this down by two thirds, but this was one time I wish I'd made more! Went fabulously with the bourbon molasses pecan glazed ham, also to die for.

Ghastly! I have made many recipes from Epicurious. Most were good, and a few were either mediocre or outstanding. But this chutney was simply awful. It sounded so good - I love spicy, adore tangerines, like marmalade...I blame it on the marmalade, which must have been more bitter than the kind I usually buy (this new one was a British brand). It wasn't the zest, as I didn't get anywhere near the pith on the fruit. Anyway, much too much time later, the chutney tasted OK until I swallowed, then the bitter and the spicy had a fistfight in my throat. Bleh! Naughty recipe! No forks for you!

I LOVE this recipe - as do my guests. I have been making this every year since it was published - and will continue to do so. It is wonderful with duck. The cleaning of the tangerines is a bit time comsuming, but worth it. If you can't find the red jalapeno jelly use red pepper flakes. It keeps for months, but tends to get a bit hotter!

Served with ham and smoked turkey. Everyone seemed to like it. I was craving it for days after. It was more liquid than I expected - I probably didn't drain the tangerines well enough.

My brother in law said he would help me cook for Christmas. I handed him this recipe. Quite a challenge for a novice cook but the results were worth it. Make this a day or two ahead. We also used it on turkey sandwiches the next day.On chicken tonight.

This went well with the ham, but was far too time consuming.

To be honest, I haven't made this recipe yet, but have a question - what can I substitute for red jalepeno jelly? We just don't seem to have it here...please help!

I made this with clementines. Good, but some of my guests liked the ham just fine without it, and as such I had a lot leftover. It didn't keep well.

This was an amazing accompaniment to the Bourbon, Molasses, and Pecan glazed Ham. I ended up with not quite enough of the Jalapeno jelly, but the flavor was still delicious. I had to use Florida oranges as I couldn't find any tangerines either. I cut each segment into about 3rds, but they didn't drain at all, even so I will definitely make this again and will have to try it with turkey and chicken as well.

I made the chutney for our christmas ham yesterday and it was the perfect accompaniement. I used orange marmelade, omitted the zest and used fresh undrained florida oranges. Beautiful.

i made this for Easter and found the result to be okay. A little too sweet. I served it with the Ham with Bourbon, Molasses and Pecan glaze and the combo of the glaze and chutney was too much on the sweet side. The glaze is fabulous - see recipe.

This chutney is GREAT. I made it for a party at Christmas and now I'm making it for Easter. I did use canned mandarin oranges, well drained, and it tasted great. So good with homemade biscuits, a slice of ham and a slice of swiss!

To the gal who was wondering about using canned mandarine oranges, I wouldn't advise it. The syrup would make the chutney too sweet. I used fresh mandarine oranges, and it was fantastic! Lots of work, but I rec'd rave reviews from all 20 of my guests...kids, too! Truly a wonderful, full-flavored meal with the ham and buttermilk spoon bread.

The work to make this chutney was totally worth it -- amazing with the ham.

I have a question too...how about canned mandarin segments? Not that I'm big on canned, but I am very big on not having to peel! :o)

This chutney was yummy! The jalapeno jelly gave it a nice heat.

Made it to go with a pork roase and used some of my homemade habernero jelly. It was a bit sweet, but had a nice flavor.

I can't buy tangerines where I live - would mandarine oranges be a good substitute? Thanks much!
