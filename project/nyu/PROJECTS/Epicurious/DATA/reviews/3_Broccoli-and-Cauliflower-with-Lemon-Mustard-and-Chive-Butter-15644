I really like this recipe. I might add a little more dijon/lemon butter though.

I just did a riff on this recipe and it was great. I melted 2 TBS butter, whisked in 1 teas. dijon mustard and 1/4 teas. grated lemon peel, then stirred it all into about 3/4 pound of steamed broccoli and cauliflower, along with about 1 TBS fresh minced chives. A great way to use up extra CSA vegetables!

I made this with broccoli rabe, and it was very good. the mustard is really what gave it the zip.

I loved this recipe and didn't have any trouble, as others reviewed they did, with having the sauce stick to the veggies. My only problem was, cooked as directed, the broccoli and cauliflower were both waaay overcooked for me. Next time I will steam them instead of boiling.....otherwise, a definite keeper!

I am usually not a huge broccoli fan or even a huge cauliflower fan for that matter but this dish is really tasty! This dish does make the vegies cooked but crunchy so beware those of you who like them super soft. Went really well with Christmas ham (a mustard theme going on).

Delicious and pretty! I made it the night before, followed the recipe, and served in on buffet in a chafing dish to keep warm. Raves from my guests, and my family devoured the leftovers.

This is a wonderfully pretty dish to serve along with its delicious taste. My guests are still calling with compliments

Maybe I made a mistake when I cut this recipe in half, but I thought it was bland. I served it to the family, but no one went back for seconds.

Yuck! I like all the ingredients, so I thought the combo would be great. It's not. I took one bite and threw the rest away.

This is a wonderful recipe - I've made it again and again, and it always draws compliments. I usually make it with only half the butter called for in the recipe, and since I love cauliflower, I use half broccoli and half cauliflower. The lemony flavor really comes through!

We really enjoyed this. The second time around, I added a 'tech of balsamic vinegar, just for fun ('tech is Texan for 'a touch of') and some red bell pepper for color. I also steamed the veggies until barely al dente so when I reheated them -- very slowly to coat well -- in the butter sauce, they turned out perfect.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was ok. The butter mixture was amazing, however didn't really stick to the vegetables as well as I would have liked. Probably better to use on other veggies that would absorb the flavours

I'll make it again only to use up the rest of the butter. It seems you have to drench it in butter (which I don't normally do) to be able to taste anything significant.

Tasty, but gets cold quickly. Next time I'll use a plate warmer as I serve it. I also used lite butter, which was a mistake. Very good, though.

I have made this recipe since '98 and agree with the chef from Miami Beach it works wonderfully with many vegetables.

QUOTE: A Cook on 01/14/01 This dish was okay but not a winner. I decreased the amount of butter and dijon mustard. ENDQUOTE Next time leave the recipe alone before you complain that it's "not a winner". Good grief!

I have made this recipe several times (including non-cauliflower eaters) and it always gets compliments. It was actually requested again for Thanksgiving 2000!

I've made this butter several times now. Any veg. that butter and lemon has an affinity for will work (Green beans, asparagus, carrots, peas) It can be made ahead, rolled into a log, frozen and sliced off as needed.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I made a few adjustments for our dietary needs and for the taste. I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup margerine in place of the butter- I also steamed the veggies and added about 2x more lemon zest than the recipe called for! It was tasty and enjoyable

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner this year. I was a little turned off by the smell at first, I used country style dijon instead of regular. Make sure the butter is melted throught the veggies, otherwise you might not like the taste as much. The taste was ok. I think this is a very simple recipe to make for the beginning cook. Next time I would like to make something a little more richer tasting.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving in 1998 and again in 1999, only that I substituted brussel sprouts for the broccoli and cauliflower and used whole-grain prepared mustard instead of Dijon mustard. Everybody loved it!

Not much flavor and very boring. Deleted it off my recipe box.

This was a decent recipe. Nothing special, I thought it was kind of bland myself and added lots of salt.

I made this for Thanksgiving and unlike the other reviewers my family didn't care for it. I thought it was bland. I halved the recipe and steamed the vegies.

Easy and delicious. I made this dish last year for Thanksgiving (98). My family enjoyed it so much I'm going to make it again this year!

I love this recipe. We opted to steam the vegetables, rather than boiling them, and we used a little less butter. But it was delicious and an easy side dish.
