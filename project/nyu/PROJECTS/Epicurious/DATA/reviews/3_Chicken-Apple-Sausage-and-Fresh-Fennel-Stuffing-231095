My Thanksgiving guests really enjoyed this dish. I used a mixture of whole wheat sourdough and high fiber whole grain sandwich bread and it worked nicely. It does need a good bit of broth to make it moist. Mine was a little on the dry side but still very tasty.

The recipe sounded so good, but the result was dry and bland - I would definately double the amount of broth called for and add some garlic if I were to do this again.

I made this dish at thanksgiving and two of my guests said it was the best stuffing they had ever had! I liked it too. I did AT LEAST double the chicken broth because we like really moist stuffing. And I used homemade broth.

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner, even with a fellow foodie who was burned out on dressing/stuffing the past few years. The fresh fennel flavor makes a big difference, and make sure to use good quality fresh chicken-apple sausage. I made this with part bakery-made whole grain bread instead of all sourdough--excellent.

Everyone liked the fresh flavors of this stuffing.

I don't feel I can give this a fair review bc my butcher inadvertently gave me spicy chicken sausage instead of the chicken-apple sausage. I thus added in a chopped apple and really tried to break up the sausage well. I halved this and used far less bread than is called for, and it was fine. Still used 2 eggs and a decent amt of broth given the much lower amt of bread. I put a big spoon of the stuffing into a boneless breast and rolled it, sprinked with buttered crumbs, and baked. It was very good, I will likely try this again and try to follow the recipe better.
