This will be the third year I'm bringing this to our Seder and it's been a hit. I've been requested to bring it this year, again. It's easy to make and, since most of us love spice, I up the Cayenne a little bit for all of our enjoyment.

This was a huge hit at our sedar. I'm not a huge haroset fan but I loved this too. I reduced the cayenne just a bit as I was afraid some of our older guests might not like it. Still had just a little bite. Wonderful and quick too.

Got rave reviews on this at 2 seders. It is nothing like the traditional charoset. I had to add more wine than called for, and even with extra spices added, it wasn't that spicy. Delicious!

Without a doubt the most delicious Haroset recipe I've ever tasted! This recipe has become a fixture every year at my Seder table. My guests always love it. We're teetolers, so substitute the wine with Kedem grape juice and it's still got a complex, mysterious taste that the usual mix of apples, walnuts, and wine cannot approach.

The best Haroseth ever and it doesn't get brown and old looking.

I just made this recipe for Passover this year. It was fabulous! I made a few alterations though: first I used a dessert riesling instead of the Manischewitz, and second I used ancho chile powder instead of the cayenne pepper (which I do not like.) I found that the ancho chile powder's complex and rich flavor worked really well with this recipe. This recipe is a keeper!!!!

Yum! When I first made this, it tasted a little too spicy. But a few hours later when I served it at seder, the tastes seemed to have mellowed. Everyone loved it. It makes a nice "second" to traditional American/Ashkenazi charoset.

This will be the third seder in a row that I make this. In fact, it has guaranteed my family a standing invitation to a friend's seder. Apparently her mother-in-law has put in a special request for "Deborah's spicy haroset" The cuisinart makes prep easy and the combinatin of flavors is wonderful. I do still enjoy the traditional apple mixture, but this is great to provide something new.

This dish was a hit at our Passover dinner. Everyone took seconds. I must say the only difficult part (time consuming) was dicing the aprocots and dates, some extra dried fruit I added.I think this would taste great wiht vanilla icecream. yumm

I recently made this to accompany a lamb dish as well as to give it a dry run before Passover this year (which will be a bigger production than usual); it's great. I did make some changes, though. Instead of chopping everything in the food processor, I hand chopped black mision figs and added a big handful of golden raisins. I soaked the dates in the wine to soften, mashed them to a paste, added a squeeze or two of lime juice and then used the date mixture to bind the other fruits. I also added cardamon. Finally, I rolled the charoses into small balls and placed them on top of dried apricot halves for a prettier presentation. Excellent.

For anyone looking for a change from the wan, Manischewitz-soaked apples of their youth, this recipe is a revelation. It's sweet, hot and crunchy all at once. And it doesn't fall off the matzoh. Half the recipe made plenty for our little seder, plus extras for the inevitable snacking. It's not just good, it's an addiction.

Urp. Just ate the whole bowl. In an attempt to make haroseth somewhat similar to what my husband grew up with, I added an apple. And come to think of it, instead of hunting down all the different dried fruits, I used 1 package of Sunsweet Orchard mix (it had prunes, apples, apricots, and peaches in it) and then the appropriate amount of figs. Also used grape juice instead of wine (didn't stop at the liquor store beforehand). And before you think I ate the WHOLE bowl, I did only make half the recipe. But excellent as is - and I plan on making it again next year!

I can't believe that I'm the first to rate this recipe. It is sophisticated and delicious, and promted lots of interest at the Seder table. It goes way beyond the usual, and is easy to spread on matzo as well! This will be a passover staple.
