This recipe as is, is not anything memorable. However, I found it tasted better before I added the tomatoes and olives. By omitting these two ingredients, (and perhaps the broccoli also, which you can serve as a side dish), you will end up with a very good mushroom/wine sauce, which brings it up a few notches. (It will have more of a French edge than Italian). I also suggest doubling the vegetables, herbs, and penne, adding 1 extra Tbsp. of olive oil, and using lots more wine, around 1/2 to 3/4 cup, and lots more garlic.(Add loads of garlic)!! In addition, toss the pasta with extra oregano, basil, and/or Italian seasoning, and of course, salt. I was sorry I added the tomatoes and olives, and if I make this again, I'm going to omit them. It will never be an outstanding pasta dish, but with a few adjustments, it should end up tasting light and flavorful.

Recipe read as worth a try. When completed it was beautiful. Tasted flat.
