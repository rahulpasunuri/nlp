Very easy to prepare and a great base for improvisation. Although since this was the first time, I didn't change too much. OK to use chunky peanut butter since it's going into the blender. Definitely add heat as either chili oil, hot sauce, sriracha, cayenne, etc. Changed lemon to lime as that seemed more typical with the other ingredients. Added diced carrot and cucumber as well as cilantro to add vegetables, color and texture. Will make again. Remember to undercook pasta to avoid "gloppiness". Loved it served room temp as well as cold out of the fridge.

Great and easy recipe! I used pork shoulder because it's what I had on hand. Also used chunky peanut butter and whole wheat spaghetti. I added carrots, cabbage, and a little bit of jalapeno and stir fried vegetables with meat. Tossed in cilantro at the end. Turned out nicely.

I made this last night for the first time and, after following a couple suggestions in other reviews, found that it was totally yummo - and I was impressed with how fast it was to put together, a great plus on a busy weeknight. I, added some heat to the peanut sauce - didn't have the chile oil that others used, but I did use some Sriracha sauce, and it was perfect! One other change to the sauce - instead of using all water, I used half water and half low salt chicken broth. I also sliced some seedless cucumber into matchsticks and scattered this over the top of the finished dish along with the green onions - and I sprinkled some chopped peanuts on too. Delish - and the left overs are even better the next day. A definite keeper. : )

This is glop. I'll only eat it again because I can't afford to throw away food. Way,way, WAY too much peanut butter! It might work if you have children who crave peanut butter, but they'll want jelly, too. It's basically a sticky, useless mess, and a waste of time and money.

Very good and hearty weeknight meal to make. You can make much of it the night or morning before, and I've found that the flavors come together a bit better.

Great every day meal. Minor changes because of what we had on hand. Cubed port shoulder, cooked one hour stove top and continued with adding ingredients asked for. Used the peanut dipping sauce for Sara Moulton's spring rolls on the food tv sight. Used that recipe for quite some time, with consistent success. Added meat to cooked pasta, added peanut sauce till it was just sauced. Topped with chpd peanuts and scallions. A terrific change of pace.

This is a regular in our house. I use ground turkey for the meat, and I add chili sauce to the peanut butter mixture. Before serving top everything with cucumber slices, chopped cilantro, green onions and peanuts.

I used pork chops cut into strips instead of ground pork, and added carrot and bell pepper strips stir-fried with the pork. Also used penne. My husband and I loved this. Just make sure to thin the peanut sauce enough so that it doesn't become gummy.

This is a good basic pasta dish for weeknights.

Only one word can describe this dish: Repulsive. Just thinking about it as I write this review nauseates me. I had an upset stomach all night. I'm not sure what ruins it, but it just might be the huge amount of peanut butter called for. A tablespoon would have been more appropriate. And I love peanut butter.

I've made this recipe several times. It tastes great, as well as being very quick and easy to prepare.

Love this! It's a regular wintertime dish. I add tabasco and chile oil to the sauce. After reading all the reviews, I tossed the spaghetti with the sauce, plated it, topped it with the meat mixture and sprinkled with scallions. The sauce didn't overwhelm the meat.

Very good! Tastes like Dan Dan Noodles, served at PF Chang's restaurants - except, for the lack of spice. I could tell by reading the recipe that it lacked heat, so I added a teaspoon of red chile flakes. I also topped the entire dish with some julienned cucumber and chopped dry roasted peanuts. It is a great dish, try it!

A good fun recipe. I've made it before using tofu that was coated and browned with cayenne pepper, and I think I preferred that spicier version. I used only 1/2 c. peanut butter and 1/2 c. water, and heated the sauce on the stovetop while the pasta and pork was cooking. It turned out well, just a little bland.

I understand the disapointment that some other reviewers felt about this dish. It's easy and fun to make. The ingredients all smell and look so good. The pork smells divine as it cooks with all the ginger and garlic. Then you put everything together and the peanut sauce overpowers all the other elements. In the end, even though I am critical of the recipe, my family loved the finshed dish. My husband told me that it was delicious, and my eighteen month old daughter ate a whole bowlful. So maybe it's just a matter of taste.

This is pretty good, I sugest simply mixing the peanut sauce in a bowl, and adding 1 tsp of tobasco sauce for some zing and then adding the peanut sauce to the meat and warming it up a bit. I did it that way and it turned out great.

A very tasty dish and a hit with my finicky eater. I have one at home who is allergic to onions so I omitted the scallions and added extra ginger and garlic. We also used pre-made peanut sauce and skipped that step. Overall very good and easy. Will make again.

Yuck is right! I love thai food, love peanut sauce, but after I made the sauce I couldn't serve it.

Also used pork cubes and 1/2 the water. Different and quick. Good contrast with cole slaw with caraway seeds, onion, and lemon.

My husband really enjoyed this dish. He has been eating it three days in a row now. I had to make some modifications so that it is more like the one we get at our favorite Chinese restaurant. I added three teaspoons of chili paste, used Quon Yick dry noodles instead of spaghetti, cucumbers strips instead of scallions, and a dash of rice vinegar. We used to drive three neighborhoods away and order three large orders for take-out: one we ate, the others we saved for the week!

Very different and very, very good. I've made it a few times now.

Kind of boring. Nice but ordinary.

YUCK! My husband and I could not finish what was on our plates (unusual for us!) The sauce was pasty and overkilled the dish. Disappointing, as we love Asian food.

Divine. Tasted like something from our favorite Asian noodle restaurant. My husband and 10-year-old loved it too.

This was very easy and a great family dish...not to mention, a huge hit with my husband. I altered the sauce recipe slightly by substituting cream of coconut for the sugar (didn't measure, but blended it to about a milkshake consistency). I also warmed up the sauce before tossing to keep everything hot. Next time I'll probably add something to spice it up a little.

This was yummy. We made it with chicken flavored seitan instead of pork (my boyfriend's roommate is vegan and prefers that we not cook meat in the house) and it was just fine.

Easy to make. Interesting flavors. Something a little different that I just love.
