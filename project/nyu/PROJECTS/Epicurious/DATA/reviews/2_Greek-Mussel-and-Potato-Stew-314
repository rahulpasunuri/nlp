Need to find a way of increasing the seafood taste. Seems to me that one could make this dish without using fresh mussels - maybe something canned (cheap and non-gourmet, I know, but it may just be as good).

This is a great recipe that has become a standard at our house. A loaf of bread, a bottle of wine, and you have a quick, easy, satisfying dinner.

This dish was very bland and there is nothing to really bring out the flavor of the mussels. Definitely a disappointment!

I recently had this at a Greek dinner party. I did not cook it but it was impressive, very tasty, and took very little ‘last minute’ time for the cook. I think I would add a little Ouzo to the potato mix and more seasoning, but the mussels were perfect and flavorful. Even Mussel vergins liked it!
