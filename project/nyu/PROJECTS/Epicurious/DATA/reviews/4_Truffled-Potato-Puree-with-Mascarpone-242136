Ok... so here's what I did based on all of your comments. Boiled potatoes with 10 cloves of garlic (which is how I make garlic mashed potatoes). Drained in colandar and put back in pot with butter, salt and pepper per recipe. Added 4 - 5 tablespoons truffle oil AND one full container marscapone cheese. Mashed all together and served hot. RAVES!! It was a dilecitble side to a formal St. Patrick's' Day dinner party!

Is also delicious with a combination of potatoes and parsnips.

Instantly a family favorite with a few changes. I increased the mascarpone to one cup, added 1/4 cup whole milk, and increased amount of salt to 1.25 teaspoons. Unbelievably creamy and tasty! No need to try another recipe.

Very nice, creamy, simple. A keeper! Did not put as much truffle oil as called for.

I usually follow recipes perfectly, but found this one very bland as soon as I combined all the ingredients. Ended up adding goat cheese, parsley and garlic and it was okay, but it still lacked a distinct flavor. I would stick with the garlic mashed potatoes on this website instead.

Followed recipe exactly and thought it was boring. Added salt and chives to liven up the leftovers.

So easy and so delicious. I could not find truffle sauce so used truffle oil.

This was great and easy to make. The mascarpone cheese and butter made it creamy as expected. I wish I had better truffle oil, since I hardly tasted mine in it. One thing I did to make it better was bake it again. After peeling, I quartered, boiled and drained. I then added to the cheese and butter in a bowl and mixed with a hand mixer. Later, when I roasted my main course, I put the potatoes in the bottom shelf of the oven for a half hour. The surface got golden brown and the flavor of baked mashed potatoes was wonderful.

I have made this recipe many many times. Lately, I've used a high quality olive oil instead of the truffle oil. It's fantastic and arguably the best potato recipe.

Easy, different, and tasty! These will definitely show up at the table again soon.

Made these New Years Eve with the Porcini Crusted Filet. Both were delicious and easy to make. All of my guest enjoyed them. Definitely will make again.

This is simple and elegant dish. I served it with the Tenderloin with Port and Bacon sauce from this site and the flavors complemented each other beautifully. I used the recommended amount of truffle oil, which my husband thought was too strong but I thought was perfect. I cut the butter by half.

I have made this twice in 2 weeks and have received rave reviews from all of my guests. The last time I only had a few Yukon Gold potatoes left, so added Russets and it was just as good. Quick and easy! I will definitely make this recipe many times in the future!

This was creamy and good. I have to say, I thought the flavor would blow me away given the lovely description and ingredient content, but I wasn't THAT impressed with the flavor. While I would possibly make it again for company, I didn't think the flavor justified the fat and calories. (I did cut the butter down to 2 T.)

I made this NYE as a side for the cod with chanterelle recipe on this site. Amazing.

this recipe was great- i didn't need to add any milk- the marcaspone and butter made it creamy enough, and the truffled oil gave it a nice essence.

Wow - so good!!! I also served this with beef tenderloin with shallot bacon port reduction from this website and it was truly decadent. I made this entire recipe ahead early in the day and just reheated in the oven while the tenderloin was cooking. Perfect as written!

This is my new favorite mashed potato recipe. I served it with tenderloin in a shallot port reduction sauce also from this site. The perfect compliment as the tenderloin sauce was sweet and the marscapone was not too overwhelming as some cheeses are in mashed potatos. I made them a couple hours early and then reheated on the stove top while I added a bit more milk. This worked but next time I think I'll plan to have the potatos just done and add the cheese, milk and butter just before serving for the best texture and flavor. I used white truffle flavored olive oil and only added about a teaspoon.

Only giving this 3 forks because I'm skeptical of the vague "black truffle sauce or oil" it calls for. Everything I found that was called black truffle sauce had some mixture of olives included with the truffles... Olives? Not what I was going for. I easily give this recipe 4 forks if you go for the gusto and use white truffle oil. I added a teaspoon at a time and ended up using 4 teaspoons in total. I also went for a very smooth, creamy, luxurious texture (not the mountainous mounds of potatoes mom used to make). They were decadent and paired really well with Thanksgiving dinner. Not to mention, the entire fam was impressed!

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was an absolute delight. I pureed the potatoes the day before and added the marscarpone. I added the oil the next day and reheated in a large dish in the oven for 30 minutes. I thought one of my guests was going to lick the bowl!

I think this recipe is stellar. I would recommend peeling, and cutting the potatoes into 1-inch pieces so that you do not have to boil them for so long. Also, I used white truffle oil instead of black oil.

Amazing and very easy. My two kids, ages 3 and 10 months, loved these. I joked about them having a silver spoon in their mouth as I was 33 before I ever tasted a truffle. Very subtle flavors here and can be made without too much fuss or measuring.
