Really good! Added finely diced red pepper and the chives at the end of cooking. I also made sure ricotta was room temp and added at the end of cooking the eggs. We licked the serving spoon.

Mmmm, this is a yummy new breakfast for me! The ricotta really makes the eggs light & fluffy. I added tomatoes, red pepper and a little bit of ham. Had it with rye and it was great but want to try the multi-grain next time.

Good not great. Very rich, and I would suggest using a mild bread. I used a seeded bread and it was overpowering. I would try sourdough next time - If I make it again.

Delicious! I didn't have chives, so substituted chopped basil and used garlic infused olive oil rather than butter and also added a chopped mini red bell pepper for color and nutrition. The toasted bread was squaw bread (made with molasses). Loved it!

I didn't have any fresh chives or ricotta cheese, and had to substitute fresh parsley and fat-free Greek yogurt, respectively, for each. It was still quite delicious for a light supper, when served with fresh oranges.

Absolutely outstanding and creative way to make eggs special! LOVED the addition of ricotta, and when placed on the multigrain, all flavors and textures meld into harmonized food heaven. Recipe gets an A for flavors, an A for texture, an A for inexpensiveness, an A for ease of preparation, and an A- for presentation. Overall, this puppy is an A!

Heavenly fluffy eggs but be certain to buy a quality ricotta. Buttering and toasting the bread is important to the overall recipe also.

Rating: 4
Lovely and creamy! I was looking for a creative way to empty a riccota cheese tub. I put my plate in the oven (after I baked the bread buns) so the eggs wouldn't cool off as suggested. I also folded in the ricotta while the egg was still cooking to heat it up properly. It was just perfect! And the eggs never had a chance to cool off :-D

A creamy, nutritious, and fast breakfast or meal whenever hungry. Make sure to season with chives, pepper, and salt because ricotta is a bland cheese to begin with. Quick and delish.

This is such an amazing dish...easy and pretty healthy for you. I love the original recipe, but I'll also use whatever fresh herbs and soft cheese that I have on hand....goat cheese works well.

Tasty stuff! I usually like to turn the heat down near the middle of the cooking process and add in the ricotta so that it's more incorporated. The chive and coarse grain salt really make it (don't make without!).

excellent, quick, and easy. my husband and I have brunch every Sunday and he loved this dish. He initially didn't think eggs and ricotta would go well together except in lasagna but after tasting it, he couldn't get enough! I, too, took the ricotta out f the fridge to let it come to room temp, as I did with the eggs. the chives were an excellent addition. If you don't have chives, you could try shallots. Onions would be too powerful a flavor, Another alternative might be fresh thyme. Thyme and eggs go well together. I used Kosher salt and added some pepper to the eggs.

I made this for brunch and my BF loved it! We do a lot of brunches at home and this is a new favorite because it is light but still flavorful. Suggestions: I followed the recipe exactly but to take it to the next level added baccon and tomatoes. I put the tomatoes on the baking tray with the bread in the oven for a few minutes and it turned out really well. Adds a whole new layer of flavor. I followed other review suggestions and heated the Ricotta slightly before adding to the eggs. Another suggestion: heat the plates in the microwave before plating the breakfast. Some foods (esp eggs) cool down quickly and this is a great trick.

Rating: 3
This was good and very easy. Next time, I'll make it with tarragon instead of chives... ricotta has a natural sweetness better suited to tarragon -- at least, to my taste buds. I also nuked the ricotta for about 20 seconds, just so it wasn't refrigerator cold. As another reviewer noted, this tastes yummy with tomato soup.

Rating: 3
I love ricotta - especially fresh ricotta - and love scrambled eggs, so was really excited to make this recipe. I liked it, and will prboably make it again, but found it to be a little too rich and creamy for breakfast - I'll probably save for guests etc. The ricotta cooled down the eggs considerably so even though they were fresh off the stove, they came out very luke warm. I also used kosher salt instead of fleur de sel.

Rating: 3
This was very good and I will make this again. Be forewarned: the ricotta quickly brings the warm eggs to room temperature. So make sure you take out the ricotta from the refrigerator in advance. Also homemade or locally-made ricotta makes all the difference in the final dish.

The ricotta completely transforms the eggs, this is really nice with either a green salad or tomato soup on the side.

Rating: 0
Adding the fleur de sel before cooking is useless. Fleur de sel adds taste to a dish when sprinkled onto the food, before serving, but virtually nada before or while cooking, as it is a very humid salt. Besides, it's such an expensive product, it's a shame to treat it like you would a regular salt.

My husband and I make these eggs often -- they're a lovely, easy treat on weekend mornings. This recipe also turned me on to the wonders of fleur de sel! I find this salt, while not essential to the recipe's success, to be a definite part of it. I write a blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins, and this is one of the recipes I featured on it.

I've made this recipe many times and how well it turns out is ENTIRELY dependent on the quality of the ricotta. The average grocery store brands which might make it into a lasagna recipe DO NOT CUT IT. Splurge on fresh ricotta from a gourmet grocery. Fresh chives are also a must.

Rating: 1
I don't understand the 4 forks people gave this recipe. I made this recipe as directed {right down to the Fleur de sel}and it came out sub par. I can't believe this recipe even made it into Bon Appetit magazine!! It was extremely bland and the texture wasn't very pleasant. I'm a big fan of eggs in general but I didn't like these at all. I would rather eat my eggs plain scrambled in butter than this way. My husband said these reminded him of 'egg salad' he wasn't very impressed with this recipe either. Personally I would rather eat actual egg salad than this, at least egg salad has some zing from the tangy mayo. I wouldn't waste my time with this one, but to each his own, maybe you'll have a different opinion.

Very easy to make and everyone else loved this. It was a little bland for my taste, so I added hot sauce. I'll probably make it again because of how quick and easy it was to make, and because of my family's reactions.

People say where to get ricotta? Drive 45 min? Make it in less time! Here's how. Bring a gal of milk to 200 degrees. Remove from heat, add 1/8 cup of vinegar, stirring. Place a muslin cloth in a colander, pour mixture through and collect the solids. Tie it into a bag and hang it until it stops dripping. Use the whey to make bread. It takes very little time and is great.

This was a very easy and super tasty way to prepare eggs for a party of 4 as well as a party of 10. The fresh ricotta provided a great creaminess and the chives a hint of herb that made the dish pop. Really enjoyed!

Never could make decent scrambled eggs until this recipe. It is fabulous. My husband raved. Followed the recipe to the letter except for the changes described below. Consider this is a master recipe. Other dairy products also work well to make the eggs creamy. I used a combination of cheeses and asparagus and am looking forward to using fresh herbs from my garden this summer.

Rating: 4
Quick, easy, and delicious. The eggs came out buttery and fluffy thanks to the butter (of course!) and the creamy ricotta. The mild onion-y flavour from the chives really made this dish sing. Because this is so simple to make, I've turned it into a workday sandwich by adding smoked fish (salmon) or savory meats (leftover lamb). I think it would also taste great with pancetta, prosciutto, or bacon.

This was easy and fantastic. I often make scrambled eggs with cream cheese and chives for a group. This was a wonderful change and a lighter alternative. I served this to 10 people and everyone raved!

Wanted to make something a little different this morning for Saturday breakfast and work w/ what I had in the frig. So I used low-fat cottage cheese made smooth in the blender and scallions rather than ricotta and chives. Eggs were creamy and yummy. Since I'm cutting white carbs I served with fresh, mixed berries rather than the toast.

Unbelievably simple and delicious recipe. Made it today for breakfast in Turin, Italy. I am vacationing here and found the best fresh sheep's milk ricotta ever from the farmer's market. Everyone at home loved it and my hostess asked me to give her a tutorial on it next time!!! I had trouble finding chives so i used scallions instead and I also chopped in a spicy italian green pepper. Simply remarkable. Will make again soon.

The ricotta bumps this up to 'delicious'. I chopped my chives up to give it extra flavor.

I've made this over and over again exactly as indicated and it'd absolutely delicious. A bit of ricotta really goes a long to add nice texture and silkyness to the eggs. I had no problems with temperature. Just make sure you plates are piping hot and gentley mix in the ricotta and leave it in the pan until right before serving so it stays hot. Make sure you have lots of nice buttered toast ready to go. I find myself creeping downstairs at 2 AM to whip this one up.

This is awsome. I made this over the weekend for a small gathering. It was a huge hit. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using rustic sourdough for the bread. For the person who had a problem with cold eggs after adding the ricotta, I let the ricotta come to room temp before adding it to the eggs. That worked well. No cold spots or cool eggs.

Fresh ricotta? where do you find that? I used lowfat ricotta from a carton and overall thought there was too much ricotta. As others have mentioned the ricotta cools down the eggs too fast. I will not be making this again. BTW, the chives are a must.

Why would anyone ever make plain old scrambled eggs ever again? I never knew ricotta could be used this way. All these years using only in lasagna! Used small baguette slices browned one time on the grill and one time on the frying pan, both times brushing with butterand then toasting.

For a nice change, add a diced serrano chilli and some diced fresh cilantro (about 1/3 cup for 2 eggs). I use the stalks as well as the leaves. The chilli adds a nice amount of heat and the two give it a great southwestern flair. wonderful served on lightly buttered toast. I use half & half in place of milk so it doesnt get too runny and have used cream cheese (yummy), parmesan as well as cheddar for variety.

My husband and I enjoyed the fluffy texture of the eggs, but the quantity of ricotta cools down the eggs way too fast. I would also reduce the cheese to 1/4 or 1/3 Cup as I found it too much - more ricotta taste than egg. Shall try with the fresh ricotta, though, next time to see if flavor is improved.

SO I made the ricotta as 'A Cook' describes below, but in the future I would prefer to salt the cheese and not the eggs. If I add salt to the cheese while it's cooking, will it still turn out? I would imagine so, most cheese is salty.

This recipe is excellent, but it really is better with fresh ricotta than with the store-bought stuff. I tried it both ways. However, it turns out that ricotta is really easy to make! Use half a gallon of whole milk and half a quart of buttermilk for 2+ cups of ricotta. Heat the milk and buttermilk together until the mixture boils (or almost boils) and starts to curdle (clumps form). It's really obvious when this happens. At this point take it off the heat and strain it. The curdle is ricotta. All the recipes say to strain it through several layers of cheese cloth, but that was taking a long time. Instead, I lined a bowl with a clean dishtowel and poured the mixture into the bowl. I then gently lifted the dishtowel out of the bowl, letting the liquid run through the dishtowel and into the bowl. The ricotta was left behind in the dishtowel. Don't squeeze it. I kept the ricotta in the fridge for a day and it was still good. Also, I discovered that, instead of ricotta, sour cream is also really good, but don't use as much!

Yes, provided you can find really fresh ricutta and whole grain baguetts then it is superb. It really is a matter of taste, my wife had a go the next day with a few tiny anchovies in the egg mixture, that was superb too but the general idea is valid, eggs with fresh ricotta: not so easy to find where we are!!
