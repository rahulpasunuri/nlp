Oh, and yes I would make these again.

I made these for a party the other night but added a few cinnamon sticks, star anise and vanilla beans to the poaching liquid. Served chilled with vanilla ice cream, a sprinkling of carmalized chopped pecans and home made salted caramel sauce. Diners could choose their toppings but the pears on their own were fabulous on their own.

I used Bartlett pears and this dessert was a big hit last night at a family gathering. I had never poached pears before and this was easy and yummy. Very sophisticated looking and will definitely make this again.

Very tasty. We had excess of pears from my girlfriend's grandma's tree, so we decided to try this one out. We didn't have ice cream, so we substituted home-made whip cream (with vanilla and sugar) instead. Very pleasantly surprised. Would definitely make again.

This was so easy. And suprisingly delicious for how easy and inexpensive this was. Guests were impressed, for sure.

Absolutely delicious, although I barely followed the recipe. I was making for a crowd, so I bought several - (different colors even) halved them and laid them open on the pan. I then drizzled them with honey, sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar (lightly) over the top, and topped each half with a bit of butter. I skipped the lemon juice, apple juice, water and ice cream -- although I did serve them with a bit of cream in each person's bowl. HUGE HIT!!!

I tried this for a dinner party last week. It was a big hit. Delicious & yet simple to make.

Tried this one night with my daughter, she did not want to wait till chilled in refrigerator, so we chilled in freezer for 2 hrs. This was great. We will definitely make this again.
