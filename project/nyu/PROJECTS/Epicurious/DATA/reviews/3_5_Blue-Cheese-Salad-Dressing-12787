After reading all the reviews and considering all the comments everyone made, I went ahead and made this exactly per the recipe. I think it is excellent. I used Spanish Cabrales cheese for the the "blue cheese". I think the balance of flavors is excellent. Not too much garlic, not too much lemon and the consistency is perfect on my salad. I will play with the recipe in the future. Just have to tinker with it, ya know. I'll try yogurt instead of the sour cream etc., but there's no reason not to make it exactly as described. Very, very good!

Great recipe as it is!!!

this is a good dressing but to me and my husband, it tasted quite strong. Going to blend it more with extra sour cream or plain greek yogurt and mellow it out. Good as a dip for chicken, too.

Subbed greek yogurt for sour cream, combination white wine and sherry vinegar, omitted lemon juice and it still had enough bite. Probably ended up using 1c blue cheese total and used it in a pasta salad, it was fantastic and I still have leftovers for the rest of the week!

Great recipe, though I made a few minor modifications. We love garlic but this recipe is pretty strong on it (even though I used a medium-sized clove as opposed to a large one as written). Perhaps it will mellow as it sits. Didn't have any lemon juice so used a couple tablespoons of mayo. Also reduced the mustard by half. After blending and tasting, added in a bit of sugar as other reviewers suggested and also added a couple tablespoons more sour cream. Crumbled in some additional blue cheese at the end. Really great dip for wings!

This salad dressing is not just good, it is incredibly good, and any lover of bleu cheese is going to roll their eyes appreciatively. The dressing is delicious right out of the Cuisinart and will get even better as it sits. I made the recipe as is for baseline comparison, but it'll be fun to tinker with the ingredients later on.

Yum! We had this easy & delish dressing on a salad of butter lettuce, tomatoes, thin slices of last nights flank steak, and the pickled onions from this recipe on Epi: endive and arugula salad with pickled onions and blue cheese. BF was dubious when I told him my plan yesterday, but wound up scarfing it down!

I just made 2 quarts of this..very tasty. I used white balsamic and used 1/2 xvoo and 1/2 soybean oil. I am sure once the flavors meld...it will get the fourth fork.

I, too, adjusted the recipe by using white vinegar with dry yellow musturd and no sour cream no lemon juice. Everyone loved it. Thanks.

Very Good. I made it twice. Once with the cheese added before hand and once with the cheese added to the salad instead. both were very good.

A wise bunch of reviewers (except for Miz Deb, the cheerleader). I could taste all that excess acid without even trying as written. Reduced everything except the fats; added sugar and extra cheese. Really good!

Enough garlic to knock out dracula! This isn't bad but nothing special either.

This recipe was good but can be better. Between the dijon mustard, lemon juice, and vinegar, it was much too acidic. I found myself having to use excessive salt in order to counter the sourness. Next time I will reduce the lemon juice and vinegar to 1 T. each. Use plenty of freshly ground pepper for that extra flavor boost.

Delicious.

I made this for my family a couple of days ago, and they are already asking for it again tonight. We love it! The only change I made was: instead of adding the couple of tablespoons of water, I added balsamic vinegar instead. We are huge fans of balsamic vinager, and like to think that it goes with everything, and OH! it does!

excellent blue cheese dressing.

I have made this several times, and found that by using a little less vinegar I have a super homemade blue cheese salad dressing. (my husband likes it so much I have to restrain him from eating it with a spoon)

We have been trying for years to find a great blue cheese dressing recipe. This is the best that we have found. We used sherry vinegar and lots of Stilton. We went light on the garlic and Dijon because we were looking for a lighter taste.

Excellent taste. I am just looking the recipe up to repeat it. I also added a bit less vinegar and will try a less strong flavor of garlic. I also added much more blue cheese.

A basic yet delicious recipe; I too added a pinch of sugar. I used as a salad dressing, but I think it would also be fantastic as a dip for crudites.

this recipe sounds delicious and my husband and I love blue cheese

I thought this recipe was excellent! Next time I'm going to add a little more garlic and try a little sugar. I cut a head of lettuce in quarters, topped each with the dressing, added a few chopped tomatoes, and sprinkled a little blue cheese on top. It was wonderful!

I thought this was a nice basic recipe. I used yogurt for the sour cream. Nice with carrot and celery sticks instead of salad. I used some mature Stilton which was very delish.

As with all recipes, one needs quality ingredients for this one. I tripled the amount of garlic, used fat free plain yoghurt instead of sour cream, mixed in AJ Wall Wall Sweet Onion Mustard and Hengstenberg Sweet Mustard to taste and crumbled in imported Danish Blue Cheese. Fabulous!

This is a good recipe for dressing. (Hopefully someday when Debbie grows up and leaves school she will know how to express herself better.)

I think that this is a good starting receipe for blue cheese dressing, but I find that substituting Tarragon Vinegar for the lemon and mayonaise for the sour cream is much better. You have to be a lover of blue cheese to like this. Try Maytag Blue, it is so creamy!

Please don't listen to Debbie from Chicago. Aside from her disgusting review of this recipe-(We are all supposed to be adults here!) This is a really great recipe

I love the internet. I needed a blue cheese dressing and couldn't find a good one quickly. I logged on here and found this one which everyone loved. We substituted yogurt for sour cream and used lots of pepper. Dynamite!

This is an easy and quick dressing to make, and tastes much better than anything bottled...I have made it numerouse times using only 1T of vinegar and lemon juice, last time I used spicy brown mustard and it turned out even better!!

WOW...way better than anything you can find in a bottle...my husband and my father are great blue cheese dressing lovers so we will definitely make this again!!!

This is quite good, but it tends to have a slightly bitter flavor. Next time, I'll use less mustard and see what happens.

This is the best blue cheese dressing I've had--usually I don't even like blue cheese dressing. I doubled the recipe but only had about 4 oz. of blue cheese and used sherry vinegar because I was out of white wine v.; Used regular olive oil and some roasted garlic olive oil. I have been using it on my luncheon salad all week. Am making more this weekend. thanks for the recipe!!

This was pretty tasty and much nicer than bottled dressing! One suggestion: adding a half tsp. or so of sugar really cuts the bitterness of the cheese.

Excellent salad dressing. Easy to put together. I'll never buy bottled blue dressing again.
