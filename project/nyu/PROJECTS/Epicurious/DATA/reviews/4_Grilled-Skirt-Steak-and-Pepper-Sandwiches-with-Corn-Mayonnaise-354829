Very good game food. What better for a game than a handful of a messy meaty sandwich! I used flank steak instead of skirt. Next time I will season or marinate the steak before grilling. The corn mayonnaise was outstanding! That could be a stand alone item. I didn't have enough mayonnaise so I subbed sour cream for what I was missing and it was wonderful! I used individual ciabatta rolls which tasted great, but assembling each one was time consuming. Next time I would use a 2-3 foot baguette, build the entire thing and then slice it into individual sandwiches.

The recipie itself is wonderful. The instructions need considerable improvement, however. A "bullet" list would be nice for moving through the execution of the recipie, especially for those of us who find ourselves on the "rookie" side of the gastronome index.

This sandwich really delivered. The corn mayo is awesome. I don't have a grill, so I just put my oven on broil and went for it, but between the smoke and the withering heat, I think another time I'd just flame-roast the veggies, pan-fry the meat and call it a day. I do think I'll make it again; I served it with salt-n-vinegar chips and coleslaw, and I almost felt like I was outdoors at a BBQ rather than inside my little apartment in Queens!

Very Good! Quick, easy, and very tasty on first try. Inexpensive ingredients make this recipe indispensable.

WOW. What an outstanding sandwich! I didn't use the corn because what they had in the produce department didn't look so hot. Didn't miss it one single bit though! I used hanger steak because it was on sale, it's similar in texture to skirt steak, but thicker. When I got to the bakery department, they were out of ciabatta. :-(!! I swapped in little French rolls, and everyone had their own little sandwich. My kids RAVED. Can't wait to make it again!

This has become a go-to weeknight meal for us. We use flank steak and, though the corn is amazing, for a quick meal we usually skip it. Throw the steak, bell peppers and onion on the grill - then just whip up the mayonnaise in minutes.

I thought this was very good. I used flank steak and marinated it for the day in italian dressing, magi, fresh minced garlic and fresh groud pepper. I squeezed a lime over the steak right before I grilled it. The corn mayo was great. I made this for my husband and there was not a morsel left. By the way, it was no problem to cut the recipe in half. It still tasted great.

also used flank steak....this was delicious! Used less mayo just because of calories and was still great. Used an asiago bagette hollowed out, brushed with olive oil and then toasted on the grill. a new family favorite.....

Made this the night before our son left for college. Voted 4 forks, loved the corn mayonaise. We thought we'd make it with flank steak next time.

Good, quick, easy. Corn mayo is excellent. Used leftover corn and mixed with charred peppers and onions. Very flavorful

My one observation is that this took me a lot longer than the "30 minute" prep time. This is a great sandwich and the corn mayo is wonderful. I took great pains to roast the pepers, onions and corn to perfection. I think this is where I spent my extra time. The roasted corn takes a while, but is worth the effort. The ear takes on a lovely golden yellow hue when ready. Pay close attention to the slicing instructions, if done wrong this could be a tough piece of meat.

The corn mayo is definitely the star of this sandwich. So good!

The flavor of the grilled vegetables with the steak and corn mayo is delicious. The flavors worked so well together. I made it for dinner and everyone enjoyed it.
