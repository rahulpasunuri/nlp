I loved this, especially for as easy as it was! Added 2x the chives, some white pepper, but otherwise made exactly as directed. Will definitely make again!

Loved it! Exactly the way it was.

Pretty straightforward simple delicious. I peel the garlic and wrap it in foil drizzled w a little evoo and salt. Easier than getting garlic out of skins after its cooked I think. I've used green onions too when the chives here were brown. Comfort food.

I LOVE this recipe. It is a great, simple and tasty dish to bring to pot luck events. I usually use 2 heads of garlic and use idaho potatoes with the skin on + 2x as many chives. Be sure to add salt and pepper to taste at the end. It is always a crowd pleaser

Good stuff! Quick and simple to make and got nothing but compliments! I added a little whole milk to make them more creamy. Just my preference

This was ok but I can't say it was very impressive. I used red potatoes and left the skin on, but only had 1/2 a head of garlic. Didn't think it was anything to rave about.

I've made this twice and both times my husband thought it was a bland recipe.

One of my favorite ways to make mashed potatoes. I made this dish so, so many times. I'll make with russets if I don't have red potatoes. If it's just the wife and I, I'll use two heads of garlic. At the moment if I was stranded on an island with one mashed potato recipe I think this would be it.

Easy recipe and tasted great. I didn't mash the garlic by itself. I just threw everything in with the potatoes and mashed everything together. I made this to go along with turkey at Christmas dinner. It worked well because, although you could definitely taste the different ingredients, none of them were too overpowering. A nice alternative to plain mashed.

While the potatoes were good, we didn't really care for the tang the sour cream added. Perhaps it is personal preference but I think this would have been better without the sour taste.

This is an easy recipe that taste absoulutely amazing, I did however tweaked it a bit, I also added some milk. I put milk, 1/2 stick of butter and heavy cream and heated in a sauce pan, and as I mashed the potatoes, I added in the liquid along with rest of ingredients, and once I was done, I added the other half of the stick of butter, which enhance the flavor, making it more creamier... I made this with Cornish hens and sauteed fresh spinach mixed with carmelized onions and garlic... This was such an amazing dinner, that there were no left overs..LOL I would make this again, This was soo completely yummy...!!

Very good, may be a bit garlicky. Made into small balls with a melon baller and then baked and served as appetizers.

I LOVE doing mashed potatoes this way! I actually will begin pre roasted garlic this way and keeping it in the fridge. It's a great addition to lots of recipes and good to have on hand. This is the way I make mashed potatoes most of the time - so easy and so decadent!

Delicious. I would say it was a little less flavorful than I expected it to be, but still good and I would make it again, maybe adding a few things for flavor.

Great! Made these with BEEF TENDERLOIN WITH ROASTED SHALLOTS, BACON AND PORT (Bon Appetit 1997). Chopped the bacon used in Beef recipe and added to potato mash. WOW this was terrific. Everyone loved them. Reheat well, freeze fairly well.

A nice reminder that good food doesn't have to be complicated. I made this in advance the morning of Thanksgiving and found that it was not easy to reheat on the stove-top and required quite a bit of muscle work. So I suggest reheating this in the microwave or in batches with a liquid, like water leftover from boiling the potatoes. Also, I added the chives when I was ready to serve the potatoes and found it easiest to cut them into the mix using kitchen shears.

Delicious mashed potatoes. Served them with the red wine and porcini mushroom pot roast from this site. Perfect meal for fall, and for company.

Sooooooo good, we make it every time we have guests over and they always ask for the recipie. Thanks

Great tasting potatoes. I only roast 6 large cloves of garlic as not to overwhelm the potatoes and chives.

This was an excellent and easy recipe. The best I've ever found for garlic mashed potatoes, the leftovers are great the next day. My whole family loved them.

Delicious! I used 2% milk instead of cream and it was wonderful. I will definitely make it again and again!

Very good. Used 2% milk instead of cream and added some salt. Didn't have any chives.

These potatoes were fantastic. For a lower fat version, I used skim milk rather than cream and upped the sour cream (light) to about 1/4 cup. I liked the added sour cream and chive flavor this gave them, and didn't miss the cream. Like other reviewers, I left most of the skins on. I will absolutely make these again -- they were delicious with a roasted chicken and braised escarole with garlic.

This was wonderful. I made substantive changes using milk instead of cream and omitting the sour cream and chives. I left all the skins on for visual appeal. I roast garlic in bulk and then freeze spoonfuls for just this kind of recipe, I used four frozen spoonfuls of mashed roasted garlic. WOW - quick, easy and elegant.

Like another reviewer, it's a permanent addition to Thanksgiving. I used red new potatoes and left ALL skins on for a rich, rustic taste. I also made it a second time without roasting the garlic, and simply adding one clove of minced to the "mash" step. Just as yummy and a little faster.

Best mashed potatoes I've ever made. Roasted garlic makes all the difference, so you have a nice round garlicy flavor without the bite of fresh garlic. Following the advice of another reviewer, I only peeled about 2/3s of my potatoes, which left just the right amount of rustic red potato skins.

SUPER yummers! I dumped the cooked potatoes into my KitchenAid mixer to "mash" them - then added the remainder of the ingredients and gave it another whiz. Fast and creeeeeeamy (another dirty bowl, but what the heck). The more garlic the better!!! :)

Add an extra clove of garlic and you have the best mashed potatoes I've ever tasted!

This recipe is delicious! I made it to accompany beef tenderloin in a merlot shallot sauce with asparagus, and it was perfect. I had to use scallions instead of chives, which I was hesitant about, but it turned out fine. I sliced the scallions very thin and sauteed them in a little bit of butter before adding them. Also, I recommend only skinning about half of the potatoes so you get that red color, but it the skins don't overwhelm the potatoes.

Like the other reviewers, I would add a bit more garlic the next time around. These are very nice as per the recipe but I personally like a bit more garlic.

Rating: 3
Like others - I bump up the garlic for this recipe. I also don't skin the potatoes. I find the red skins go well with the green of the chives - particularly during the Christmas holidays.

I am somewhat biased, as I live in St Louis less than a mile from 'Harvest' where this came from (Fantastic cheese cakes made there too) This recipe is easy to make and a very flexible standby as a side for almost any entree. You can punch up the garlic as needed, but the base is perfect and always welcomed and mentioned by guests.

We made this dish as our 'first stab' at Thanksgiving dinner and it turned out really well. I agree that more garlic may have enhanced the dish and a little more cream or milk would have been good too.

I really liked it - the garlic was a bit too subtle - I would increase it next time. Also, I prefer it creamier- I added more butter and cream. What the heck - it's only once or twice a year.

These are definitely garlic mashed potatoes. Very tasty and creamy. Perfect every time!

This turned out really nice, and the roasted garlic gave the whole house a wonderful fragrance. If prefer my mash a bit creamier, so I played with the potato-to-cream ratio a bit.

These were quite possibly some of the best mashed potatoes ever, very tasty and creamy and the garlic wasn't overpowering at all.

This is quite possibly the best mash I have ever tasted! Obviously very rich, so this will have to be a once in a while treat...perfect with grilled, balsamic marinated strip steaks.
