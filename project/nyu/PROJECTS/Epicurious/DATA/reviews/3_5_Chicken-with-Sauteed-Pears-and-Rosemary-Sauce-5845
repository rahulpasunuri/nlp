This recipe is very disappointing. The final product is not worth the amount of time it takes to prepare.

I quadruple the pears. Use all apple juice but double the balsamic . I saute the onions & garlic with the herbs, S&P, in the same pan I will saute the pears in. Then transfer onion mix to a stock pot with the liquid to reduce.This leaves a little herb on the pears. After the pears are brown (do this on high heat so they don't get mushy) hit them with a splash of marsala, reduce and set aside. Use the same pan for the chicken and put it all back together for the final coating, with the pears. Yum.

I used pork instead of chicken because of the reviewers here who mentioned it, and because my guest prefers pork. That may have been a mistake--the sauce was lovely, but the pork itself was pretty bland (although my guest claimed to have enjoyed it). I'll try it again with chicken.

I followed some of the previous comments and used 1 cup apple juice & 1 cup chicken stock which I think was a good idea because it turned out just sweet enough. I used only 1 tbsp rosemary because I thought 2 tbsp would be too much, not realizing it would be strained. In the future, I would use 2tbsp, but try to use fresh. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream, head it ahead of time but it still curdled once it hit the pot. My quick fix was hitting it with a hand blender for a few seconds and it was perfect. The sauce was thin so I thickened it a bit at the end with corn starch. Overall, I thought it was delicious and the sauce was amazing and would definitely make it again.

Doing half juice/ half chicken stock is a great idea, however just using the juice was delicious. I added creme fraiche instead of whipping cream, since I had it on hand, and the result was perfect. It probably kept the consistency of the sauce thicker as well. The pears added the perfect amount of sweetness to the sweet and savory sauce. Fantastic.

Good outcome - made before I read other reviews. Cooked juice/wine 2x longer + 20 min w/cream and sauce thickened considerably. Would sub 1C broth for apple juice as suggested along w/fresh herbs rather than dried. Will definitely make again w/some tweaks.

Loved this. So did my almost two year old foodie and my husband. I will definitely make this again and, like others, make even more of the pears.

(This review is for the sauce only.) Subtle and sweet, this sauce tops roasted pork very well. I will sauté the onions and garlic in butter next time.

I didn't use rosemary or whipping cream (used milk and corn starch), and I used two pears. Personally, I thought it was delicious; my husband said that it was good but that "warm fruit seems weird for dinner." I ate the sauce with leftover rice for lunch the next day.

i made this dish for dinner tonight, and it was really good. served over creamy polenta, the recipe made for a perfect combination of sophistication and comfort. i subbed the 2 cups of apple juice for half juice/half chicken stock (as per other users' suggestions) and the marsala for sherry (it's what i had.) yes, the sauce was thin--but i really didn't mind, as the flavor was great. even my picky boyfriend (who "hates pears") cleaned his plate! my only issue was with the appearance of the dish. the whole thing came out an unappetizing shade of grey. oh, well... it was delicious! i will definitely make this again!

This was delicious! Personally, I prefer a thicker sauce but the sauce had such a delightful flavor that I still enjoyed it. In the future I will make a larger quantity of the pears. The pears were far too delicious to simply use them as garnish (especially if your guest list includes children). The pears could be cooked in far less oil and still be successful. We will certainly make this again.

Great recipe! Everyone loved! Even my picky father-in-law! He is already asking me to make again!

Delicious! My boyfriend actually thought that this was one of the best dishes I've ever made because of the thinner consistency of the sauce. I like thicker sauces, which is why I rated it at three forks. Followed other reviewers advice, and used 1 c. apple juice, and 1 c. chicken broth rather than the 2 c.'s of juice. I also heated the cream before adding to the sauce, which prevented it from curdling. I also used an asian pear rather than a bosc pear, and the result was fabulous. I added the sauteed pear to the sauce before serving. I've already been asked to make this again this weekend.

very good base receipe, you can improvise a lot off this if you want - different herbs, chicken broth instead of marsala and apple juice to cut down on sugar. recommend serving over rice to fully enjoy sauce.

Rating: 4
Excellent. Used asian pear instead of bosc & sage instead of thyme. Still added dried crushed red pepper. Also used combo of apple juice & chicken broth instead of 2 cups apple juice. Didn't have whipping cream so made flour-based sauce instead. Cooked whole chicken breasts (w/ bones) in water with chicken cubes till almost done. Simmered in sauce till well-done. Added a bit of chicken stock as well. It was excellent!! It wasn't too sweet because the chicken was pre-salted and I added chicken stock. Everyone raved about it and I will DEFINATELY make it again soon.

Very good. Nice intense flavor. I liked the sauce very much, but, it was just a little too sweet for my husband. Next time, I would substitute beef stock for one half of the apple cider. Still, it was very good and I have added this to my personal cookbook.

I bought garlic marinated chicken breasts. I did use one cup apple juice and one cup chicken broth. It gave it a tinge of sweetness. Next time I will use two cups apple juice or cider, and more red pepper flakes. We like the sweet and tangy taste. But the sauce had a very good flavor. I used half the oil. Next time a quarter or less. Used olive oil. It needs very little oil. Just a little to saute' the onion, garlic and then the pear. A little time consuming, but enjoyable to prepare. I sprinkled a little of potato starch in the sauce. Let it simmer for a half hour. Simmering does thicken it. We thought it was a success and will make it again to enjoy.

We loved the complexity and refinement of this nuanced sauce. I used only one cup apple sauce and one cup stock, and added ground red pepper flakes for more kick (I live in the Southwest; we like kick). I had no problem reducing as some have said; we were very happy with the richness and depth of the sauce. I served it over roast pheasant, with mache/watercress salad, grilled pear halves for presentation and a gorgeous Laetitia Pinot Noir.

I thought this recipe was quite good-- but the sweetness did take us by surprise. Unique flavor and a nice change from the typical.

Divine. I followed the recipe exactly and obtained wonderful results. I did not need to use any additional thickener. I found that the recipe understated the amount of time that was required to reduce the apple juice and red wine mixture by one-half. It took me 40 minutes and I watched it closely. The recipe also understated the amoung of time necessary to reduce the mixture of cream and reduced wine and juice mixture to sauce consistency, it took twice as long as the 12 minutes noted. However, the sauce was divine. Not too sweet, delicate and complex. This is very close to a favority restaurant version of Chicken Marsala that I have been trying to duplicate for years. I am thrilled to have found this recipe I will definitely make it again and serve it to guests. Yummy!!

This is one family favorite!! The kids love it. Our guests love it. It's easy and the taste is beyond compare!!

I thought this was fantastic! The crushed red pepper is key and the marsala gives it that great flavor. I recommend warming the pear slices in the sauce after removing the chicken. This was great.

Didn't dig it. I think the pears and sauce would've been better with pork. The sauce was also a little too thin.

Absolutely loved it!!! We're making it again tonight!

This recipe seemed like it was going to be wonderful until we tasted the finished product. The sauce was a bit one-dimensional, it wasn't well rounded out. It was lacking a creamy, rich element even though the recipe called for whipping cream as the thickener. However, other than this, it was great, I would alter the recipe next time and add butter to round out the acidic sweetness of the sauce.

Rating: 4
WOW!! I dont' know what other people are talking about, but this sauce isn't too sweet if you make it right! You need to make sure you add enough crushed red pepper so the spice outweighs the sweetness. And you need to let the sauce cook 30-40 minutes to get it to the right consistency. This tasted like it belongs in a 5-star restaurant!! Goes great with spinach salad and garlic mashed potatoes.

A wonderful dish indeed! The sauce is rich with flavor. Complemented well with the grilled pear salad with blue cheese,walnuts,bacon and port dressing. Highly recommended.

Rating: 2
Decent. Based upon the advice of other reviewers, I also cut the apple juice by half and subbed chicken stock for the other cup of juice. I used fresh herbs and white wine instead of Marsala. My sauce took much less time to reduce than printed here. The sauce had an interesting flavor but I would prefer it over a different meat, i.e. pork.

Rating: 3
I couldn't give this a 4 due to the necessary adjustments. I followed other reviewers advice and used 1 cup of apple juice and 1 cup of chicken broth. I also added about 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit. Also added a bit of cinnamon to the pears as per another reviewers suggestion. Very tasty!

Rating: 3
Very nice - not too sweet, when substitute 1 cup chicken stock for 1 cup apple juice. Thickened the sauce with a little roux. Takes a little time, but it's worth it. Will definately make this again!

I did not like this recipe, but my husband said he did. The sauce was much too sweet and the pears just added to that taste. I tried the Dijon mustard and found it did not do the trick. I will try it sometime in the future and substitute chicken broth for half of the apple juice. There are too many good recipes to spend a lot of time correcting this to my taste.

This was delicious. I'm still learning to cook and it came out great. I substituted white grape juice instead of apple juice. I also substituted Dry Sherry instead of the red wine and again Sherry instead of Marsala.

I live on Bainbridge Island and have eaten this chicken at Ruby's. I swear they left something out of this recipe. It is a 4!!!! at the resaurant but not the same at home. Still good but not the same.

Thicken up the sauce with a couple of forkfulls of blue cheese and cut the apple sauce by 1/2 - makes a huge difference.

This dish is unusual, but wonderful, a perfect combo for a dinner party. The sauce is a bit thin, but that is easily remedied with a bit of cornstarch. I've served this many times with mashed potatoes made with cream cheese and chives. I use fresh rosemary.

This dish was delicious with a little improvisation. I floured the chicken and added a little roux to thicken the sauce, which makes a big difference. I will definitely make it again! I also used a little fresh rosemary in lieu of the dried.

I was disappointed with this recipe, but my husband enjoyed it and put it in the "make it once a year" category. The sauce was too thin, and there was to much dried rosemary.

I would definitely make this recipe again. I doubled the amount of pears, and I think I would make rice to accompany the dish as the sauce was a bit runny. Nevertheless, it is excellent and easy to make. A keeper.

I found the sauce to be too sweet. I think the culprit is the apple juice in the sauce. If I made it again, I would use chicken stock.

This was too sweet for me, but my boyfriend thought it was delicious. It definitely has potential, though. I will make it again and take the other reviewer's suggestion to add dijon and substitute chicken stock for half the apple juice - I think that would really help.

Excellent. I sauteed the pears (I doubled the amount and peeled them, as I love pears but am not fond of the skins) and added 2 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar and 1 Tbsp of brown sugar as well as a lot of black pepper to them, then set them aside. The sauce did take awhile to make, but it was excellent. When I added the cream it appeared slightly curdled, but after simmering and stirring for 10 minutes or so, it was fine. I was concerned for awhile, though. For serving, I removed the chicken to the plates and then mixed the pears back into the sauce. I garnished with very finely chopped green onions. Lovely! Even my father-in-law liked it.

This sauce has an amazing flavour. My guests raved about it. I grilled the chicken on the BBQ and served it with a quickly sauteed ratatouille and jasmine rice timbales.

All my guests loved this dish, esp the sauce. I knew the sauce took a while from the other reviews, so I was prepared for it, and prepared the rest of my meal while it simmered away in the background. Very complex in flavours. I served this with the "Endive Salad with Apples, Walnuts & Gorgonzola", also found on this site, and Polenta squares.

The sauce does take a long time, but it is very good. I got impatient and added the cream before the other ingredients fully reduced, so my sauce could have been thicker. No mustard was added to my recipe either.

This dish was very good. My dinner guests loved it and asked for the recipe. I did not find the sauce too sweet as other cooks have. Perhaps my brand of balsamic vinegar balanced the sweet-sour flavor. I did not add the dijon mustard.

I made this dish for my wife last night for Valentine's Day. I thought that it was a snap to prepare. In fact, while the sauce was cooking down (about 30 minutes total) I prepared the rest of this dish, made some oven roasted asparagus, a salad, garlic mashed potatoes, and set the table. I substituted one cup of white grape juice and one cup water for the two cups apple juice because that was all I had on hand, and it turned out fine. Also, the red wine I used was "Reds" from Laurel Oaks Vineyard. It is a marvelously deep and flavorful red wine that is under $8.00 a bottle. We enjoyed the rest of the bottle with our meal. I will definitely make this dish again.

This dish was pretty good, but took too long to make. To be exact, the sauce took too long to make. We did take the suggestion to add dijon to the sauce to cut it's sweetness. That seemed to be a good addition. We served it with rice which went well with the sauce and pears.

Rating: 3
Excellent dish! I think it needs a little something more- could be the dijon or spice as suggested by other reviews. I'm sure to find out since I will be making this many more times.

Rating: 3
Great recipe, though I agree with Sean Rogers that the sauce is too sweet. I added 1 T. dijon mustard to the sauce, which cut the sweetness nicely. Next time I might use 1 cup apple juice and a cup chicken stock rather than 2 cups juice. I also used condensed milk rather than whipping cream - it made a rich, creamy sauce with less fat.

The first Bon Appetit magazine I ever bought contained this recipe and I've been making it ever since (also buying the magazine and checking out the web site). It is absolutely delicious, although the sauce takes longer to really come together than the recipe indicates. Definitely four forks.

This recipe was delightful. Who would have thought that pears, chicken and rosemary would be such a wonderful combination.

This was a really quality dish. It didn't knock my socks off, because it didn't have really anything to balance out the sweetness of the sauce. I couldn't think of anything in time because I made it for a date and didn't want to mess it up. She was loved it anyway. I suggest sprinkling some cinnamon on the pears before you saute.
