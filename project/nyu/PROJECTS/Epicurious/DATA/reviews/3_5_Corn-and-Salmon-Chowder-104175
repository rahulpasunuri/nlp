excellent chowder for salmon. for a richer flavour i use coconut milk instead of 1% milk. i also add a small amount of chili paste for some heat.

I regret not listening to the reviewer from Coconut Grove, FL about adding spices. This was a good base to start with, but definitely needs spices, herbs, something that will give it more flavor. Alternately, I would try using a more powerfully flavorful stock than I did, which might give it more depth.

Great easy chowder...even for a weeknight. I made a few changes and it still came out tasty. Used whole milk, a frozen corn medley (it added extra carrots, baby corn and broccoli)and celery and fennel seeds instead of fresh fennel. In fact, I could have done w/o the fennel seeds. I omitted the potato, and increased the amount of salmon. Be generous with the salt & pepper. Good base soup for experimenting.

This is quite good, especially considering how low fat it is. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and it worked fine. Pureeing the corn gives a slightly curdled appearance which might be avoided if you want to go to the trouble of straining it when it comes out of the blender. I have a feeling that this would be great made with coconut milk and lemon grass.

What a fantastic way to use salmon leftover from dinner the other night. My husband also loved this, and many coworkers commented on how wonderful it smelled. We'll be making this many times in the future.

I have made this dish several times since I found the recipe on epicurious - it is always a hit! I have made several changes to the recipe: I omit the potato. Also, if I make the chowder in the Summer I will use grilled salmon and fresh raw corn off the cob. The fresh corn and the grilled flavoring turn this recipe up a notch to completely suburb!

This was absolutely delicious...I'm not a big creamy chowder person so I loved the more brothy consistency of this. I used smoked salmon because my husband whines whenever I make something with fresh, and since I used nonfat milk and my soup was more like a stew with all the vegetables, I added 1/4c cream at the end when the soup was still cool from the salmon and corn addition (so it would not curdle). The taste is very rich and almost buttery, hard to believe it's so low in fat! Filling too, if you're not serving as a main dish it's probably more like 6 to 8 servings.

This chowder is delicious... I've made it several times and sometimes use part fresh, part smoked or even salmon candy in it. Everyone always loves it.

This is a tasty alternative to heavy, complicated chowders. I even left out the potato, and used left over grilled salmon. Used less milk, and sub- stituted salt, pepper, leek, Emeril seasoning, and a little fennel seed for the fennel bulb.

This recipe ROCKS!! Don't hesitate to try it, its easy to make and delicious.

This soup was terrible - I'm baffled at the rave reviews here. It was runny; it was oily; the fennel taste is overpowering; it was just bad. It's possible that I did something wrong here, but I know I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with fodder for my garbage disposal.

This is great, not only it is kosher (pareve), but it is a great low-fat alternative to creamy chowders, which run rampant in my neck of the woods. I liked making the frothy corn milkshake (use frozen corn)...it made a great story to tell my guests.

I found the soup a little "dull". If you notyice, it doesn't cal for herbs or spices. SOOOO, 1 added 1 teaspon turmuric, 1 teaspoon thyme, and a dash of cayanne. Bingo...we loved it!

This is a great soup! I've been looking for a lowfat chowder and this is it! I used leftover, cooked salmon from the night before and it came out great. I added the corn puree first and, after a few minutes, added the cooked salmon just to warm it. It needed some salt at the end, but other than that, it was great!!

Very good and easy to prepare. The grocery store did not have fennel, so I used a stalk of sliced celery and one teaspoon of fennel spice from napastyle.com instead. I think you could use part half and half or cream for the milk and chop potatoes more finely and it would be good enough for company.

Great dish. One thing we've done though is to use smoked salmon instead of "raw". Great flavor, and a lot easier to deal with. The recipe mentions thawed corn but I don't think that's very necessary. The only drawback of frozen is that the milk in the blender creates something basically like a corn milkshake :^)

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. I thought it was a nice healthy alternative to New England Clam Chowder, and I liked the use of the fennel, but I did not like the consistency of the fennel strands along side the delicate salmon and the soup was a little thin. If I were to make it again, I might consider putting a little less fennel in it and then pureeing it before adding carrots, potato etc. I would also use a slice of bacon instead of the olive oil for a little more taste.

This will become a fall/winter favorite. I used enriched vanilla flavored soy milk instead of the 2% milk. I also used Imagine's No Chicken Broth (my favorite vegetable broth). My husband and I loved it and took some to work the next day. An excellent low-fat comfort food.

This was wonderful chowder! My husband did everything but lick his bowl. His highest compliment is, "You can make this again" and he said this after the first mouthful. I, also, used fat free half and half. It really is good, no kidding! I added more corn to the food processor than was called for and I added a really big handful of corn to the potatoes, fennel, onion, etc., mix. I also used Knorr fish bullion cubes. Worked great. Certainly will make this again. Susanne, Baltimore

Very yummy. Some variations I tried. Use 2 med. Shallots and 1/2 onion chopped med. with fennel. Deglaze with 1/4 cup white wine and reduce before adding remaining liquids. Puree corn/milk mix finely. Salt and pepper Salmon before adding to mix. We like it.

This was quite good. The pureed corn gives it a sort of buttery texture (in look and mouth feel, if not in taste).

Thought this was good but not a knock-out. Impressive for a low-fat dish however. I prepared all of the vegetables and whatever else I could ahead of time and took everything down to the grill (too hot to cook inside lately). Sauteed the veggies in a big stock pot on the burner and finished it up right there. Served with just a good loaf of crusty bread.

Really great flavors! When I do it again, I'll make the following changes: Add more fennel (enhance the flavor), puree more corn (make it thicker), and use red potatoes (they keep their shape better). Still a great recipe! And it's good on the second day. It works great as a light main course, served with some bread and salad.

The base was wonderful, but thought it way too fishy with the salmon. Would make it again, substituting clams or maybe shrimp.

Rating: 3
I didn't make the recipe exactly as written, having substituted celery for fennel, and shrimp for salmon and added a pinch of red pepper flakes. But pureeing the corn in the milk worked really well and I ended up with a creamy lowfat soup that was very tasty.

Couldn't find fennel so just left it out...but it was still delicious. Two thumbs up.

You know what? This soup would be great even without the salmon. The chowder itself is stand-alone delicious, assuming you use a good vegetable broth. I used the one from Imagine Organics (you'll find it at Trader Joe's), which is very flavorful. I'd beware of any veggie broth that's too oniony or astringent, as the flavors of this chowder are very delicate.

Unfortunaely, I used celery in place of fennel. I found using celery a rather bland subsitute. My husband enjoyed this chowder but did not rave. I would definitely try again with the fennel and possibly a drop of liquid smoke for a kick!

Good. We used celery rather than fennel, and it was yummy. I would add more corn next time, personal preference, because I really like my chowders to be corn-y. This was SO easy, my husband made it as a quick mid-week meal.

This chowder was a big hit. Last New Year's Eve, I was looking for a recipe to serve friends and family that would be elegant, yet a change from the heavy holiday meals we'd been having. Everyone loved it, even my youngest son. I forgot about it until tonight. I decided to make it again, and it was every bit the hit it was last winter.

Fabulous! I was a little skeptical at first because I was unsure how it would be the next day, but we found it JUST as good, if not better. I used a little more salmon in my version, and added about 1/2 C more corn to get more of a corn flavor, but I'd definitely make again.

This was really delicious.It has such a fresh taste. Maybe that's why it was so disappointing the next day. Savor and consume the first day and toss what ever you can't eat.

This chowder was amazing. I doubted whether it would be creamy enough, but pureeing the corn with the milk worked really well. I imagine it would be delicious using most kinds of fish or shellfish. I halved the fennel because I am not a big fan, and it was plenty flavorful. I also added some dried dill, which worked out well.

My husband loves salmon. So I'm always looking for dishes to prepare. I have made this twice in the last week. It is really good. I only added half the fennel becuase I thought it would be too thick. The second time I pureed a few cooked potatoes with the corn. The second time around he loved. It is probably best served at least a few hours after it is made so that all the flavors can come through.

I really loved making this chowder. It was very easy.It has a such a rich texture even though the milk used is low fat. My whole family loved it. They want it again soon.

A nice light main dish with bread and a salad. Easy to make.
