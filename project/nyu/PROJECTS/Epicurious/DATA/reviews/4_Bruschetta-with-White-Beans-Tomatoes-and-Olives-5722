I use less liquid and make this recipe as a salad whenever friends give me tomatoes from their garden. I also add more olives and use canned white beans. Sometimes I add the cheese and sometimes I leave it out. I will make this as a vegan alternative at my next family gathering.

Good stuff, took advice from everyone and used canned great northern. Mashed them a little bit and added ingredients. Used a little less olive oil as well since had it on broiled bread. Used sesame french bread and subsituted feta very good, am going to use it for my next cocktail party as a good vegetarian option.

Simple and easy. I have made with or without the goat cheese, and have used a woody herb (typically thyme) in place of basil. Enjoyed it thoroughly using all those combinations.

I used canned Great Northern Beans also. I didn't have fresh basil, so I cut down slightly on the garlic and olive oil and used 3 Tablespoons of frozen pesto. I served this with other appetizers at a cocktail party and it was totally gone.

UPDATE: I'm snowed in and made this with a bunch of ingredients I had on hand: canned tomatoes, minced garlic from a jar, canned Great Northern beans, and frozen chopped basil. All of the substitutions worked except the canned tomatoes. Of course, for guests I'd only use fresh ingredients.

This was delicious, and I will definitely be serving it to guests in the future. Like other reviewers, I used canned (Great Northern) beans and can't imagine that the dried beans are worth the extra work. I sliced the bread to about 1/2 inch. I used a very mild goat cheese and will try it with a slightly tangier version next time. Next time I will also try it with less olive oil (so it's less calories). Yum!

I meant to say I "mashed" some of the beans...

This is fabulous! Following other reveiwers' suggestions, I use a can of cannellini beans instead of fussing with the dried ones. I also lightly mas about a third of the beans and leave the others whole -- it helps everything hold together. I have served this at several dinner parties, and people practically lick the bowl clean :) I serve it with each component separately, instead of assembling them. Much easier, and it lets guests build it the way the like it. Not everyone likes goat cheese.

this was great, i served it at a party i had on new year's even. i used canned beans instead of dried, and skipped the olives and the goat cheese, and just served it as a simple bruschetta.

Dellicious. healthy, tasty appetizer that can be made in advance. I'm a personal chef and this is one of my clients' favorites. I did make 2 changes, though. I prefer cannelini beans and I only use 3 T of extra virgin olive oil.

I omitted the goat cheese and sliced the rounds a bit thinner as suggested by another reviewer. This recipe is a keeper, everyone loved it.

I made this for a Christmas get-together and liked it, but did not swoon. I did add a pinch of crushed red pepper and a tiny squeeze of lemon for a bit more zip. I also used canned beans as suggested (cut back on prep time considerably). I might make it again for myself as the flavors were nice, but it didn't seem special enough for company or a party.

I have been making this recipe for months - people can't get enough of it! Whenever I'm invited to a party, it's just a matter of time til someone asks me to bring this. It's such a simple bruschetta, but wonderful flavor. I never bother with the beans, and I use a flavored goat cheese, such as tomato/basil for a little more flavor. Prep the mix a day ahead, as the extra time lets the flavors really soak in. Cuts down time the next day, as you just need to toast the bread, spread cheese and top. This is a good, basic staple to any recipe book!

This is an excellent recipe. The beans, basil, olives, and goat cheese are a wonderful combination. To help keep the bean mix on the bread, slightly mash it with a fork before applying. I also have made a variation of this using sauteed onions, drained beans, basil, and salt and pepper. Heat and then top with goat cheese. I serve it as a side dish. It's fantastic.

I made this for a birthday party on July 1 - pretty much as directed, except took the reco's of canned beans which I mashed a bit before mixing the rest in. Also probably added more olive oil to taste, etc. Everyone loved it and as one earlier poster mentioned - it does make a nice leftover lunch. My only complaint was the prep time - I thought it took a lot longer than I expected because of the assembly! I'll definitely make it again because it is very very tasty, but I think next time I'll serve it as a dip - on a platter or large cutting board I'd do: the dip in a bowl, bruschetta in stacks and the goat cheese in a small log and the guests can assemble themselves.

Would do again in a minute. Had my friends licking their fingers and asking for more!

This bruschetta recipe is fantastic!! I've made this many times for family gatherings, and it's always a big hit, and so easy to make. I took another reviewer's suggestion and used canned Goya small white beans (already cooked) and they are the perfect size and consistency to blend with the rest of the ingredients. Will make again and again.

Really a great combination of flavors and a fantastic appetizer. Each time I've made this, I've forgotten the goat cheese (but haven't missed it at all. I'm sure it's great though.) One recommendation, slice the bread thinner than 1 inch, it's much easier to eat, and even more delicious.

I have made this recipe several times. I don't cook the beans but use canned which really makes this a quick simple dish. I also use cilantro instead of basil. It always elicits compliments.

I may be in the minority here, but I felt this was just okay, nothing special. The recipe on this site for bruschetta with goat cheese, tomatoes and mint is far better (and simpler) I think and thus, I see this as a waste of both goat cheese and good baguettes.

Rating: 4
YUM!! The flavors complement each other so well! I've never been a HUGE fan of goat cheese, but OH MY GOD, together it is amazing. And I recently discovered that the topping doubles as a great topping for pasta too. I love this recipe!

Since I couldn't find decent fresh tomatoes, I ended up using sun-dried tomatoes which I had soaked in olive oil (then used the soaking oil in the recipe). I swapped basil for fresh rosemary and threw about half the recipe in the blender to make it hold better and let it sit in the fridge overnight (it's more like Italian hummus than bruschetta after all this, but still yummy).

I make this every time we have company - it's also very good without the olives. I forgot to buy goat cheese once and I used cream cheese in a pinch - was still very delicious!

Out of many bruschetta recipes, I chose this one as a start to a birthday dinner party of cioppino and caesar salad. Delicious, so delicious that we had to consciously stop ourselves from filling up with it before the main course. I, too, used canned beans. There is no doubt that this will be made again and again.

Excellent. We had these as an appetizer on Friday night, then the leftovers made a very nice lunch the next day. I did leave out the goat cheese, though...

This is always a hit at our house. I used canned white beans, drained and rinsed. Add more garlic and toast bread. I spread goat cheese on toasts, then mash the beans a little so it's not quite so likely to fall off the bread. There is never any of this appetizer left!!

As the recipe stands, it's a wee bit bland -- too beany for my tastes. I eliminated the olive oil and the goat cheese (needed a vegan appetizer). I added about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, a finely chopped shallot, and freshly-ground pepper to taste. I used canned beans (so they were salted and fairly soft). I mashed a couple spoonfuls of the beans to act as a binder & prevent the topping from falling off. I also let the mixture sit for about 6 hours before serving -- it gave all the flavors a chance to meld. YUM!

The flavor is great, but the dish is sloppy--the beans roll off the bruschetta. I used canned beans to make it faster--don't know why you need to make your own beans. I also heated the goat cheese in the microwave with a bit of cream to get to a spreadable consistency. I then spread on store bought crostini to make faster. (less risk of breakage.) I'd rate it higher if the beans didn't go all over my floor!

Quick & easy with consistenly reliable results. I, too, now use canned beans for sake of speed and haven't noticed a taste compromise. My guests are always happy to see this dish on the menu and never fail to ask for the recipe.

I used canned beans to cut back on time - very good - even good cold - I made it a day ahead of time and used Loccatelli cheese - I think next time I'll use the goat cheese. Next time I think I might even try the bean mixture on fish or sauted chicken breats.

What a great appetizer that gets rave reviews everytime I prepare it. I add more garlic and basil and use canned white northern beans to make it quicker.

This was a hit at as a starter to an Italian feast I recently cooked for very good friends. I can't imagine that cooking the beans could make it much better. I used canned northern beans and it was very tasty. I made it a couple of hours before guests arrived to allow the flavors to blend. I might add a little more basil next time, but it's pretty perfect as is.

I made the bean mixture one day ahead of time and I have to admit that it smelled heavenly. But, once assembled with the bread and goat cheese, I thought it tasted just OK. I have had better and will probably make other recipes before trying this again.

I tried out a few different bruschetta recipes for a party and though they were all delicious, this was probably the best. Absolutely gorgeous combination of tastes. I used a roll of French Chevre, which was easy to spread on the bread,and a tin of butter beans. Easy to make and really delicious.

Everyone loved this one. I too used goya canned beans and they were fine. As with any tomato bruchetta mix the ingredients well before-hand and allow them to really mingle.

Wonderful. Simply wonderful. I made this for a cocktail party, and my friends couldn't get enough. I mixed the toppings the night before, and they blended into a beautiful, fresh, intense flavor. Be generous with the goat cheese and your guests will sing your praises forever.

I use canned Goya small White Beans as they hold their shape and are much less fuss than dried beans. I find their soft, velvety texture a good contrast to the crisp baguette. Don't be afraid to boost the garlic ratio. Also, DO spread olive oil (fine extra-virgin, of course) on the baguette. The oil provides body and richness and pulls everything together, so use a generous hand. And if you can't get good, ripe tomatoes, don't bother. This is food from the heavens.

Excellent recipe! It was very easy to prepare. I actually made it a day in advance using a processor and was a huge hit at a recent dinner party.

This recipe is excellent. What made it easier to eat was that the bread is only broiled on one side so that it doesn't crumble apart when you bite into it. Very popular with my guests and I'll serve it again.

This appetizer was a tremendous hit with our guests. It's very good even without the goat cheese....fantastic with it. I omitted spreading olive oil on the bruschetta, since there is already plenty in the recipe. If you take the time to dice things fairly small and carefully, it is quite pretty, as well. Also, I used canned great northern beans, rinsed; they worked beautifully and it saved lots of time.
