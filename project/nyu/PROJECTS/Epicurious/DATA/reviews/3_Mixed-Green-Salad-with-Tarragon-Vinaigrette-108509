What's not to like? Made the recipe as written and this is the dish that my guests went nuts over. Go figure. The quality of the greens makes all the difference so be sure to get the freshest and most tender you can find.

Great salad with nice balance of flavors...I used balsamic vinegar since I didn't have sherry vinegar; turned out to be delicious. Good salad to eat between courses as a palate cleanser. Very refreshing and simple.

I thought this was OK. I just don't think I'd make it again--there are other vinaigrettes that are much more interesting.

To the cook from Georgia: Italian rucola can be traced back to Latin eruca a type of cabbage. The English term arugula comes from the same source, but was probably loaned from an Italian dialectal form. In Italy, there are more than one specie of rucula, rucolletta for instance. Eruca sativa mill(latin) or rocket salad is one type of rucula. Eruca vessicaria or WILD rocket is what I understand was introduced in the US-- one sub- specie of rucula, arugula. The leaves have different shape and arom. In my region we have wide selection of international products, perhaps this allow for some differences. All rocket species have distinc pungent-aromatic flavor that increases with the age of the leaf and variation in soil can play a role also.

...to the cook from Georgia...check out the website for Franchi seed. It's imported italian seed, and they have a large selection of italian greens, not available here in the US.

Question: Who knows about rucola (its English name, maybe?) My daughter lives in northern Italy, where rucola is a widely-used excellent salad green. Rucola is not the same as the arugula used in this recipe...doesn't look the same, doesn't taste the same. We've been able to find nothing in USA markets resembling rucola. Any help out there?

I loved the mixture of the greens and the tarragon vinaigrette. I used slightly less tarragon, because I ran out. I also used a mini food processor to chop the shallots and tarragon, which formed a paste that I added to the other ingrediants and emulsified them. This worked well and turned out to be enough flavor without the full amount of tarragon.
