I wish I could give this zero forks. Granted, I'm only reviewing the quinoa and not the duck. I love quinoa, both red and regular. This was a waste of perfectly good ingredients. The dish's appearance was unappetizing- all gloppy brown with deep red flecks of the quinoa. The flavor was bland. It took a lot of doctoring to get it even a little edible. What a disappointment.
