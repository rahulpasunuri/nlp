easy to make, but the amount of sherry vinegar suggested was too much for my family's taste.

The Romesco sauce is exceptional (I used dried Ancho chilis)and comes together fast. I have a recipe for crepes layered with ricotta and spinach, with a red bell pepper sauce that I've always thought to be too bland. I'm going to substitute this wonderful sauce.
