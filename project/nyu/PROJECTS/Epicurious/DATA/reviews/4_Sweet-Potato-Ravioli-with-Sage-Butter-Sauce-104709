I noticed that most of the reviewers did not make the fried shallots, and that is such a mistake it really took this dish to another level, the raviolis are so easy to make. Just follow the recipe and you can't loose.

So I needed a quick meal and had some frozen grocery store raviolis in the freezer. This sauce was amazing and really made the meal! I did add about 2 cloves of garlic and used onion instead of shallots. Even if you don't have time for the raviolis, make the sauce and buy the raviolis!

I have to admit that I cheated. I used pre-made ravioli from whole Foods. In my opinion just as good. I loved the sauce tho its not very healthy. I was making a smaller serving so 'fried' the shallots in just a little olive oil (maybe a T, I C seems like a misprint) then added butter, about 2 T and sage. I forgot the red pepper flakes and it is still really good and a 30 minute meal.

very very good. My husband often requests this dish. One thing that we like to do is cook some shrimp in a very high heat pan with some saje and red pepper flakes (olive oil) to go with the pasta. I makes a really nice protein.

Delish! I just experimented with this recipe for a dinner party. Kinda risky, but I trusted the other reviewers. Everything turned out perfectly. But don't underestimate the time it takes to assemble these ravs, fry the shallots, boil everything in batches, etc. Although time consuming, this is not labor intensive. My wontons stayed together very nicely due to a good amount of egg wash. The adults loved the subtle kick that the red pepper adds to the sauce. Kids preferred a basic melted butter sauce. I served the ravs on a bed of wilted baby spinach. The sauce, shallots and pine nuts were all placed in bowls for individual garnishing. Perfection.

Delicious recipe, made with homemade pasta. Instead of frying the shallots, I caramelized them in the butter. I was surprised that the 8 sage leaves were not overpowering. Boyfriend loved it.

Fabulous recipe. I bought a pasta attachment for my mixer just to try this recipe. It was surprisingly easy to make the fresh pasta, but I was a bit anxious, since I was making this dish for the first time for a small dinner party. It is great for entertaining since you can make the ravioli in advance & freeze them. I did not do the fried shallots (no time). I added some garlic @ the end to the brown butter, and then sprinkled some crisply cooked & crumbled pancetta over the top. My guests swooned over this dish. I served it with an arugula salad to which I added red grapes, gorgonzola, and candied pecans ( cook's illustrated recipe).

I did't make the shallots. Instead I cut a sweet onion up and added to the butter to soften. I also added one clove of minced garlic. Everyone liked it. Quote from my nephew, "Aunt Heidi you always make weird stuff, but I like it."

Wow! I even forgot to add the scallions and crushed red peppers to the sauce and my dinner party guests were blown away! I used fresh pasta dough instead of wonton wrappers. I diced a third sweet potato to boil and then toss with the ravioli in the butter-sage sauce. I cut the brown sugar by 1/5 the amount. I didn't add butter to the ravioli filling. (I was using this as a main course and didn't want it to be too rich) I spent about 4 hours on this recipe, mostly on assembly after I doubled the recipe. Still, it was amazing and absolutely worth the time.

For those having difficulties with the wonton wrappers, I recommend buying a wonton press. Here's one from Amazon: http://tinyurl.com/alf4c6 but if you go to a Chinese supermarket they should only cost you about $1. They help you get more filling in and seal the wontons tightly. You can either use the egg wash like the recipe calls for or for vegans you can simply use water around the edges of the wonton. I use this all the time when I make ravioli or gyoza and have never run into difficulties with my stuff falling apart.

Excellent...made for friends recently and all were amazed. I read through reviews prior to making this recipe, took extra care to prevent won ton wrappers from bursting, and have some tips to offer because I think the delicate texture and flavor of the won ton wrappers are perfect for this dish...I think thicker pasta dough would mask the flavor of the filling a bit: 1. Make sure to generously wash all edges of won ton sheets with egg wash. 2. Do not overfill the wrappers...1/2 tablespoon and no more. 3. Place filling a bit more the top edge of the wrapper--not in the direct center--and do not fold top edge all the way to bottom edge. Instead, fold over the top edge of the wrapper over the filling and gently press it down tight around the filling--THEN, and this is KEY--add more egg wash before gently folding and pressing the rest of the edges. AND keep adding egg wash as you go to completely cover and close any area on the folded edges that shows traces of the flour that comes on pre-packaged won ton wrappers. 4. FINALLY, plate directly from the boiling water using slotted spoon--do not toss with the sauce. Instead, pour sauce over the pasta in the plate and then garnish with shallots and more fried sage leaves. Hope this is helpful...

Excellent flavors. Do NOT use the wonton wrappers. Don't do it, don't do it! I didn't listen to the other reviewers and regret it. After spending the time working on everything else, you'll be sad when the wonton raviolis fall apart. I boiled them very lightly, took them out immediately and then sauteed them in butter to harden them up and they still fell apart into a slimey, congealed mass like others experienced. If you must use the wonton wrappers, I would probably saute them in the butter sauce to keep them intact and then add some white wine or lemon juice to the butter sauce to soften them. I think consistency-wise, that would have been much better than boiling. I also added a little bit of lemon zest when serving to cut the butter sauce just a bit. Fried shallots were fantastic.

I used these as a starter for a Christmas Eve dinner (main course was roast pork and potatoes..also from this site). I was surprised that other reviewers didnt like the won-ton wrappers--i found the texture to be just right. (This is probably bewcause i usually find ravioli to be too chewey and doughy for my taste--i dont like tortillini for the same reason)I made them several days ahead and froze them. The trick to cooking them is to ave the water boiling and remove them AS SOON as they rise to the top. Finally, i also found them to be very rich--i think they are great starters.but as a main course...i wqould lumber the rest of the evening!

I made this recipe with fresh, homemade pasta. And although the results were delicious, it took me three hours in total. I even cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave to save time. It is a delicious dish, but quite rich. Save this recipe for an afternoon you want to spend in the kitchen!

I LOVED this - with the exeption of the wonton wrappers. The wonton wrappers seem like a good way to save time and effort, but they're just NOT good. They don't look good, they don't taste good, the texture's way off, etc. etc. This dish is worth making properly with actual pasta. The wrappers just put a sort of ghetto spin on an otherwise impressive dish.

Having read all the reviews, I decided to do a test run before making for guests. Good thing& For the filling I followed the recipe, except added nutmeg. I didnt bother measuring just seasoned to taste. It was delicious. Making the wontons was no problem. What worked best for me was picking them up and pinching all the edges closed, like making pyrogi. It was easy and fast, and none of them came apart. Make sure to brush egg right to the edges. However, cooking them was pretty bizarre. I tried boiling some fresh, boiling some frozen and steaming some. I preferred freezing for easiest handling. Dont boil too hard or too long! First mistake - cooking them until they were totally flaccid and the filling become runny. Not good. Cooked them less and tried frying them in the butter. That worked well and they came out crispy and chewy, kind of like, ok, a pot sticker. Second mistake - tasting them when they were cool on the outside, but like lava on the inside. I think maybe the folks who said Dont use wonton wrappers! are not just pasta snobs after all, but have a point. By the time I finished cooking and tasting, I have a burnt tongue and a stomach ache. I have to go lie down now.

Delicious! I'm sure fresh pasta would be good too, but the wonton wrappers tasted great. It was easy to make, and freezing the ravioli after assembling was a great way to have a quick mid-week dinner. I would add an extra minute of cooking time, however, because the sweet potato was a little cool inside from coming straight out of the freezer. Next time I might try with some kind of a cream sauce.

This was really good. I made my own pasta, as the commenters suggested, using a pasta recipe on this site. My husband said, "Wow, this one is a keeper!". I omitted the pine nuts and immediately regretted it. They would have gone wonderfully with the fried shallots.

The filling was good, but DO NOT...i repeat DO NOT use wonton wrappers if you are expecting to get anything like ravioli and not wontons. If you want ravioli use pasta dough. The wonton wrappers are too thin and once boiled are kind of slimy. I had to brown them in butter to make them edible. The shallot, butter and sage sauce is very good though.

Rating: 3
This dish came out fantastic. The little bit of spiciness plays beautifully with the sweet potato, and the sage complements it very well. I used the wonton wrappers (I almost always use these for making stuffed pastas) and served with pork chops that I rubbed with salt, black pepper, chili powder, and just the tiniest bit of ground cumin, then brushed with maple syrup before frying. The boyfriend could not say enough nice things about it :)

I STRONGLY recommend that this recipe be made with fresh pasta sheets instead of wonton wrappers. Yes, it is more work but is well worth it - the texture and flavor are vastly superior. Overall, a delicious combination of flavors and a perfect (rich!) starter dish.

This is a great recipe. I have made some modifications based on a restaurant version I love. I add a touch of cream and parmesan to the butter sauce, then I arrange the ravioli, sauce, and pinenuts in a shallow oven-proof baking dish and broil it for a few minutes. The edges of the ravioli get slightly browned and crispy which is nice texture. I add the fried shallots last so as not to lose their crunch.

Rating: 3
First of all, YUM! I made this w/out the shallots and i made a sage/butter sauce which was delicious with some parmasean and the raviolis. Question: did anyone else have trouble with their raviolis being a bit slimy? I may have undercooked them. Watch out for that!

This dish bowled me over with richness/heaviness. Also I found the pasta too oily - the fried shallots, olive oil and pine nuts made it a bit over the top. I will try the dish again, but will ease up on the olive oil for sure.

Definitely a wonderful first course as seems to be evident from most reviewers. A few tips: If you're having trouble with the pasta falling apart while cooking, try using a fork to seal the edges when preparing the ravioli. This not only strengthens the bond, but adds some decoration to the ravioli as well. Also, if you have the time, making your own pasta (instead of the wonton wraps) makes a huge difference. The recipe instructs us to add the fresh sage into the melted butter and leave it at that. I prefer to let the sage cook slightly, thereby adding some additional texture (crisp) to the butter sauce.

This recipe was spectacular, with a few modifications: Omit sugar from filling, but add a dash of cayenne pepper and a dash of cinnamon. When you make the sauce, saute' frash sage leaves until crispy in butter. Remove leaves to cool and saute shallots, instead of deepfrying them. After you cook the ravioli (they float when they are ready) throw them into the skillet with the brown butter. Crumble crispy sage leaves on top. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!

Rich and delicious, and the balance of flavours was just wonderful. I did find the texture of the wonton wrappers a little distracting, though. I'm not chef enough to make my own pasta, but I wonder if fresh (not dried) lasagna noodles can serve as a substitute for the wrappers. It would taste a little more like ravioli, I'd think. Any thoughts?

Rating: 4
Making your own dough with 100% semolina or half semolina and half white flour, olive oil, eggs, & water is a lot of work, BUT WELL WORTH IT--Use your food processor dough blade and make time for that vs wonton wraps. (Having a pasta maker helps!-#5 or #6 )Made several dozen and froze these sweet babies because they are well liked by many guests--unusual side dish with grilled chicken or pork or even salmon. Dedicated a Saturday afternoon, doubled the dough recipe and added goat cheese to some of the sweet potatoes--creamy-sweet goodness for upcoming entertaining!

If you had trouble with your ravioli falling apart, try turning the heat down until you have a gentle boil. I had no problems using wontons for another ravioli recipe--they tasted great and were much easier than making your own pasta. If you boil them too vigorously, though, they will fall apart.

Rating: 1
Too much effort for something I could have improvised with more ease and flavor. The won ton wrappers fell apart during the boiling step and the sauce (all butter!) was not worth the fat and calories. The yams would have been better alone, mashed without the sugar.

This is one of my favorites -- the sage/butter sauce is just incredible. The wonton wrappers can be a pain because they're so thin. I attempted to "double-up" on a few -- but they began to separate while cooking! - ugh! I tried another time by making raviolis out of pasta dough -- this works better -- but you have to make sure the dough is rolled VERY thin -- otherwise it's like eating a dumpling!

this has to be one of my favorite meals to cook!from casual to formal, it suits everyone! it's quite rich with the butter, but so amazing!tons of compliments! my only issue i have, is being careful not to let the ravioli's stick after cooking and before the butter, and i don't plate them fast enough for them to stay hot for my guests. but i will say that i warn my guests of this and have had absolutely no complaints,only praise!

I didn't care for this recipe too much and it's the first one I've used off this website. I was hoping to do something with my leftover candied sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving. In agreement with all about using less oil (I use Olive Oil instead of Vegetable) and also to rich for a main course. I loved the fried shallots and pine nuts, but didn't care for the squishy texture of the ravioli. If I were to make again, which I doubt, I may try doubling up the wonton wraps instead of using a single one which was way too thin. FYI for parents of little ones: my kids have a very broad range in food. Not picky at all, but hated this. More of an adult appetizer. I will however, keep trying off this website!

Wonderful! The sage really sets it off. I didn't use 1 cup oil, much less, and it worked just fine. Especially great for Thanksgiving/ Christmas. The wonton wrappers make a great and quick cheat in place of actually making dough.

I've also made this using butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes. Wonderful! I cut down the oil (i used olive instead of vegetable) for the shallots and used more butter. Used less butter in the sweet potato/squash mixture. Also added a little parmesan, cinnamon and nutmeg. YUM!!!

My friend was getting ready to run the NYC marathon so he wanted to make a heaping helping for his carbo meals. We made the pasta dough ourselves. Very fun and easy though slightly time consuming. Cut back on the amount of oil suggested for the shallots and didn't necessarily brown them. Everything still turned out fabulous. Even a diner who normally isn't fond of sweet potato gushed over their tastiness. My friend had leftover ravs for the week and finished the marathon in four hours on the nose.

Quite good! I martha'd out on this -- made my own pasta dough, dyed black with squid ink, for a halloween potluck. i added a teaspoon of curry powder to the potatoes to give them the tiniest bit of punch (but was careful not to compete with the sage). served with both the sage-butter sauce and with a vegan roux-based sauce containing white wine, scallions, mushrooms, and lots of sage. everyone loved it.

This is a prime example why this website has no competition anywhere. This was fabulous, the recipe was perfect and the raviolis were a hit with all.

I altered this based my favorite restaraunt recipe and I turned out much better. I added 1/2 cup of currants, nutmeg, and 1 tsp of walnut oil to the sweet potato mixture (crushed walnuts would be nice too).

the sauce was delicious! and the filling for the ravioli was excellent, and making the ravioli was easy and it froze well! but i wouldn't make this recipe again because the won tons were too fragile. the first time, i cooked them about 4 minutes and they broke apart. next, i tried cooking them for about 2 minutes and they were better, but really didn't hold up well.

I made these last night and while they were tasty, they were not be best choice for a main course. The reviolis are tasty, but not very filling. Also, the sweetness verges into dessert land (I'd only use 1 T of sugar, or perhaps none). Also, the sage butter sauce did little for these. So, if you lack sage or forget to brown the butter in advance, don't worry about it. Plain butter on top is fine. Also you can use about half the amount of butter listed in the recipe. These would make a lovely appetizer, or with a sweet sauce on top an interesting dessert. However, they won't fill you up as a dinner.

I teach a small cooking class for local foodies, and this recipe was a huge hit. However -- we only added a tiny smidge of the brown sugar, and it was still very sweet. We also added fresh nutmeg to the potato mixture. Finally, be aware that different sweet potatoes will yield different results. We used Jewel, which when roasted yield a very sweet flesh. Also, we thought the pine nuts was an unnecessary addition, and fried up a bit of the sage leaves with the shallots. Fabulous!!

For me, adding sugar to the sweet potatoes ruined the recipe. Somehow, to me, sage and the sweet ravioli stuffing just did not combine for a good taste. I would much prefer something savory in the ravioli, possibly a spinach or even a zucchini mixture. The sauce and the shallots were good.

Oh.....My....This was SO good!! A wonderful blend of flavors and not as difficult and time consuming as it appears. The raviolis were tender.
