We loved this recipe. We substituted yellow summer squash for the zucchini and it was delicious, very colorful and so easy!

I did not have mint, so I used fresh cilantro and it turned out fine. I think the mint would taste a bit more exotic. I love how the yogurt (I used Greek yogurt) made the pasta seem like there was a cheese sauce (my husband was fooled!) This was quick, easy and a big hit. Will definitely make this again!

I was kind of doubtful that this recipe would turn out well -- seemed like kind of a weird combination of flavors -- but it was actually pretty good. I used chicken sausage, but other than that, followed the recipe to the letter. I really was quick.

It's recipes like this that make me wish Gastronomie sans Argent was still extant. Obviously not the absolute definition of high cuisine (not complex enough), but very satisfying, and cheap on top of that. I don't suggest using quinoa or maize rotelle, though...
