Love the idea of no crust and this worked perfected. I used a cheesecake pan lined with parchment paper for a thicker quiche which I think looks nicer. Add more milk to compensate for the size. Also added French onions, bacon, brocolli and goat cheese on top.

This recipe is great, but between the eggs, cheese, whole milk, and heavy cream it has a lot of fat. I've found you can substitute both the whole milk and the heavy cream with equal amounts (16 fl oz total) of nonfat evaporated milk. The results are still great, but reduces the fat content by more than half. Like a lot of other reviewers, I use five eggs instead of four. I also reduced the oven temp by about 25 degrees because I found the top would get really brown before the center set, but this may be due to my using evaporated milk instead of cream.

Great recipe. I use it for breakfast, especially when I commute to the city. (On my commuter rail, you can eat on the train -- unlike some of the newer more pristine commuter rails.) As with most recipe reviews, I have made some modifications: 2 C heavy cream instead of 1 C milk and 1C heavy cream, panko for the breadcrumbs, and 5 eggs instead of 4. I cook the quiche for 35 minutes instead of 25 ( though that could be my oven).

Rating: 4
Almost 4 forks. My only 'complaint' is that it took much longer to cook than the recipe's suggested cooking time. After baking the quiche for 30 minutes, it still was runny. I cooked it for an additional 20 minutes before it became firm -- though perhaps it was my oven, which is more than 30 years old. But once cooked, the quiche had a delightful flavor. I will definitely make it again. Deviations: I used 5 extra-large eggs and 2 cups of heavy cream rather than the 4 large eggs and 1 cup heavy cream + one cup milk the recipe called for. I am lactose intolerant and I find that heavy cream has much less lactose (milk sugar) than regular milk.

Rating: 4
A solid recipe that I will add to my repertoire. I only made minor modifcations-used one full slice of sandwich bread to make the bread crumbs so I probably used more than the 1 1/2 T the recipe called for. I also only had 2% milk on hand so used that in lieu of the heavy cream and whole milk. Because of that, I needed to cook the dish about 5 minutes longer in order for it to set. But this was a solid recipe. I usually make a frittata once/week for dinner to cut down on the carbs but like to switch it up a bit and think this will be the recipe to do just that.

Why the frozen onions?

I followed the recipe for the most part only adding chopped, blanched asparagus and gouda cheese and put the bread crumbs on the top instead. Also took the advice of adding a 5th egg. This recipe works fine - just combine whatever you would like in an omelet. Maybe it was my oven, but I got a major spillover. Nevertheless, I would make it again but perhaps at a lower heat for a little longer.

I've been making this recipe for years. I use five eggs instead of four as some have suggested and bacon instead of ham, and not too much of it. When I made this earlier in the week, instead of using a pie pan, I used a mini muffin pan for individual appetizers. They came out perfect. My guests didn't stop raving about them. My only regret: I should have made more!

This was a great recipe. I was looking for a way to use up the last of the leftover Easter ham. I came across this recipe and thought it looked like the perfect light supper. A good basic recipe that can easily be added to depending what you have in your pantry. I followed the recipe as stated with the exception of two things. I added 1 extra egg, and needed to bake it a little longer. The recipe was easy, quick and very tasty. This is a keeper.

I made this quiche today (followed the receipe exactly) to see if it would be a good brunch item for my girlfriends. It had a great taste but turned out watery. I think next time I will drain the onions on paper towels to absorbe some of the moisture and add a veggie. it.

Rating: 4
I've probably made this at least twenty times. A few changes have crept in. I always make this in ramekins. Substitute bagel crisp crackers for the bread crumbs. Easier and makes a better bottom. I'm a purist. The ratio for perfect custardy quiche is one-half cup of heavy cream per whole egg. Yes! to grated nutmeg. Milk? In quiche? Excuse me... I've made this with fresh mushrooms, dried porcini mushrooms (soak them first), broccoli, asparagus, ham or bacon, with and without cheese. Infinitely variable, this makes our winter meal cycle about every fifteen days. Better slightly undercooked (and creamy) than slightly overcooked (and rubbery). I always make four. One for me, one for my wife, two for leftovers' lunches. Keeps me happy three days running.

This turned out great. I used fat-free half&half instead of the cream and it turned out a little watery and took quite a bit longer than 25 minutes to cook. I also subbed freshly grated gruyere for the swiss, canadian bacon for the ham and I used chives instead of onions. It was very tasty and easy to make.

DH and I loved it. I toasted the panko breadcrumbs first. I also did not have heavy cream on hand so I used 3/4 c milk + 1/4 butter instead. Next time, I will try the 5 eggs.

I forgot the breadcrumbs and used 2 cups of heavy cream (didn't have any whole milk). Also increased to 5 eggs per previous suggestions. It puffed up beautifully, nicely golden in 25 minutes.

A great basic recipe for a quick quiche. I did it last minute so made substitutions based on what I had. I subbed bacon for the ham - sauteed it first and then did the onions in some of the bacon grease. Used cheddar and parm for the cheese and used a scant cup of half and half and a generous cup of whole milk. I used five eggs. It was a tad watery but not at all objectionable. Next time, I'll try mushrooms. A great throw-it-together at the last minute dinner.

Rating: 4
This is a great base for any type of quiche. I replaced the onion with mushrooms and the ham with crab and shrimp + one extra egg. I also used half and half instead of the heavy cream and milk to cut the fat a little. It turned out perfect but required an extra 18 minutes of cooking. Ingredients were perfect for a 9" x 1.5" pyrex non-stick easy-grab pie pan.

Reading the reviews, I took this recipe as a base for the crustless and made substitutions. The quiche came out very nice -- no watery. I used (1) onion and mushroom, sauteed them till they look dry in the pan. (2)Fontina cheese and fat-free half&half. (3)for the crust I use a mixture of bread crumb and parmesan cheese. We loved the taste and no sign of watery quiche.

Rating: 4
Delicious flavor and texture. Substituted 2 Tbsp grated parmesan for the bread crumbs to make the quiche gluten-free. I also used 5 eggs per advice of earlier reviewers. I sauteed the ham and onions for about 5 additional minutes to get rid of as much water as possible. The quiche needed an extra 5-10 minutes in the oven to set up in the center. Everybody loved it.

Absolutely loved it! I did use the 5 eggs as suggested in other reviews, it was awesome.

Rating: 4
This is a great starting recipe for just about any combination of flavors. I've done sun dried tomato/artichoke, shitake mushroom, and broccoli/leek this evening. I omit the heavy cream, and just use the single cup of milk. It's way less fattening, and lighter. I've experimented with thinly sliced russet potatoes on the bottom - the egg mixture only cooks thoroughly in the middle if its a very thin layer. Very nice dinner with a dinner salad, balsamic vinaigrette on the side.

Took the advice of others and made with 5 eggs, came out perfect. I like it dry so it was a little more moist than I would like (any suggestions). I also substituted lowfat milk for the whole milk and used light cream instead of heavy cream. Any suggestions on cream substitutes? I am lactose intolerant.

I also made this recipe as 12 mini-quiches (in a muffin tin), using the breadcrumb crust, adding an extra egg and replacing the ham/swiss with spinach and feta for half of them and mushroom/asparagus/cheddar for the rest. They were delicious, but did anybody else find that their quiche came out watery? I could hardly get them out of the muffin tins (left a lot behind) and they were like wet sponges at first until I set them on paper toweling to absorb the water. Also, used marjoram in the asparagus & mushroom; and oregano in the spinach and feta. Yum. Will definitely make again, w/o the bread crumbs. I think that might have been the problem.

Rating: 3
Loved this. Per reviews added an extra egg, but kept all other proportions the same. Chopped a fresh onion and sauteed with spinach and baby bellas. Added in some leftover roasted red peppers and omitted the ham. Right before I poured the milk/egg mixture over the cheese/veggies, I added a dash of paprika, pepper, and some herbs de provence. made my house smell divine as it was baking - live at high altitude so went about 45 min until everything was brown. Had with a greek salad and it was DELISH.

The recipe as written is not correct. It needs more eggs as previous reviewers indicated. Think about it...that's a lot of liquid for only 4 eggs. I will make it again as I love the fact that it is crustless. But if you change the quantity of eggs, liquid, etc., you are no longer reviewing THIS recipe...just any recipe for a crustless quiche. As written, it does not deserve the merit of even three forks. But OH the possibilities and for that, I am grateful!

This recipe gave me the confidence to jump in and make a quiche. Crustless is even better. I use more eggs, less milk/cream. Crumbled bacon was good. I omitted the onions for my son. I also use a mixture of wheat germ and ground flax seed for the bread crumbs. Enjoy!

Awesome recipe! I make this almost every Sunday with whatever is in the fridge. I do use 5 extra large eggs and all half and half (maybe 1 an 1/4 cup) I like it fluffy. Just keep watching until middle is set and allow quiche to cool down so that he flavors will pop. Great low carb recipe and very versitile.

My husband and I loved it. We prefer not to eat carbs on weeknights, so this dish worked out well. I sautéed fresh onion w/fresh baby spinach and added turkey bacon (we're not ham fans). My casserole dish was large, so I added an additional egg, milk and cream. I also substituted 2 oz of shredded swiss with parmesan and baked for 30 minutes...yum! Can't wait to make this again.

I lightened this recipe and was pleased with the results. Instead of the ham and onions, I subbed in a bag of Cascadian Farms organic broccoli that was defrosted only slightly in the fridge. I used about 7 ounces of Cabot's Low Fat white cheddar (what I had in fridge) and used 2 whole eggs and 4 egg whites in place of the 4 eggs. Finally, I used 1 cup of part skim ricotta to stand in for heavy cream. It needed to cook for about 40 minutes and I took it out when there was just a small well of liquid in the top center, which solidified while cooling on the counter. Next time I'd add back in the onions and saute with the broccoli. I'd also throw in extra spices, maybe nutmeg and red pepper, because I found the flavor was just a touch too bland. Great and easy for a weeknight.

Rating: 3
I have made this several times it is quick and keeps well. I use fresh chopped onions, browned. I have used ham or bacon with fresh tomatoe slices. Using Emmanthaler or a Raclette cheese makes this a more special dish. I bake in a Polish Pottery Quiche dish, it baked nicely and held heat well for serving.

Rating: 3
So easy and light for a quick weeknight dinner! Since it already contains plenty of protein (eggs/cheese) I just use a variety of veggies to make it a one-dish meal. I don't even make the bread crust anymore to cut down on carbs. I also lighten it up using half-and-half and skim milk instead of cream/whole milk - still makes a fine custard. To the person who asked about using only egg whites: I tried this and it worked fine, but I wasn't pleased with the custard (a little runny). If I did "go all egg white" again, I'd probably compensate by using the richer dairy.

Delicious and definitely quicker and easier to make without the crust (which nobody missed). I changed the meat and vegetables and added fresh herbs, and like others cooked it longer, and it came out wonderfully. This will now be a go-to recipe for brunch.

This was a very good "base recipe". I liked the fact that I didn't have to make a crust, but I did make quite a few changes. I used about 10 slices of crisp cooked, crumbled turkey bacon in place of the ham and I substituted sharp cheddar for the swiss. I also added a full bag of fresh spinach (wilted in the micro and squeezed dry) and minced a whole, small fresh onion. I used 3/4 C heavy cream and 1 1/4 C 1% milk and an extra egg. I baked this in my Pampered Chef Stoneware baker and it baked beautifully - though it needed closer to 40 min. than the suggested 20-25. With all my modifications it was amazing, but I think it would be good if I had followed the recipe exactly as well. I will definately make this for our next family brunch!!

Like many others this recipe needed more time - I had it in for 31 minutes and it came out beautifully. I substituted turkey bacon for the ham, used medium cheddar and laid asaragus spears over the top. Absolutely delicious! Next time I may add a bit of cajan pepper or worchester sauce to the egg mixture for just a bit more zing.

I make this at least once a month for weekend breakfast. I've never followed the ingredients to a "T", but as a base, this is a fantastic recipe. I usually have left over bacon or sausage, expiring veggies, whatever cheese always make it in (sometimes ched, cream, swiss, munster, or a combo of each). It holds tight and always makes Larry happy.

Loved this quiche! I ate it three meals in a row until it was gone! I substituted large slices of slightly grilled bacon for the ham which added amazing flavor. Also I used sharp cheddar and some goat cheese which turned out really great. It took twice as long to cook but I think it was from using farm fresh eggs- they usually take longer.

I made this recipe for a brunch party. I'm not an egg eater, so I had no idea what I was doing. Followed the recipe exactly (using Gruyere cheese), and got RAVE reviews from all 10 people there.

Love this web site. You can't pick a bad recipe if you do your h.w. & read the reviews. This recipe was a huge hit w/ everyone. Added some leftover prosciutto w/ the ham, as well as a mix of leeks & a shallot with the onion. Loved the bread crumb "crust". So easy & impressive. That's the name of the game when it comes to entertaining for us.

Made it for a bithday party (vegetarian) and it came out wonderful, but used only veggies from my garden. Lowered the oven temp as it wasn't ready at the time they said and added more time.Used home made bread cumbs, fresh and were excellent too. Made it again tonight using bacon (crisp) scallions, spinach and asparagus from my garden once again. I should have used more liquid as it barely covered the veggies. Husband has decided it's a keeper and asked for a second piece. So eay to use changing the different ingredients and different cheeses of choice. Since I have chickens and fresh eggs daily, this is a great way to use them, and can be eaten at any meal. A great meal on the go!

Had to share my tasty experiment! Using Reynolds aluminun foil cupcake liners- I built mini-quiches, exactly like one large one, but used bacon crumbles instead of ham for size reasons. Baked 20 minutes and after 5 minute cooling, you can peal cups off and quiches hold together. Also reheat and serve well. Nice alternative in this carb-phobic world to muffins.

This is a great recipe and almost impossible to screw up. I added paprika, veggies, SALT, tomatoes, subbed coconut milk instead of cream, etc. You get the idea. I even added some left over noodles. You can do whatever you want with this and not go wrong. My pie plate broke, so I used a corning ware casserole dish. Just leave it in long enough to set.

Great! I added equiv. of two egg whites, used Fontina cheese (slightly more than 2 cups), and 2 cups of 1% milk. The extra eggwhites, and combining all before pouring over breadcrumbs probably made the difference in mine coming out just fine in 25 minutes. Delicious! Will experiment with different ingredients.

This recipe gets four forks from me for several reasons: 1. It was really versatile; I modified the ingredients to suit what was in my kitchen in my time of needing a quick little snack, using frozen broccoli steamed in the microwave and then drained/cooled on several paper towels. 2. The method as written is really well done despite needing some extra time in the oven (but there's a good chance it's my oven, not the recipe) so the baking time took a bit longer. 3. It was easy as, well, pie! I used my trusty 9" deep dish stoneware pie plate coated with some butter, sprinkled on the bread crumbs, gently added the cooked up ingredients, grated sharp cheddar cheese and poured on the custard mixture - into the oven it went. This is a good beginner quiche recipe. 4. It ACTUALLY DIDN'T STICK!!! ((takes a bow)), I was skeptical but optimistic and will definitely be making this again and again and again... 5. It was a little soggy - but wait! I think this might have been from the frozen broccoli, even though it was toweled and dried and drained as best as I could without making mush, I also had to use skim milk instead of whole and half and half instead of cream (HEY, it was in a pinch!), with the lower butterfat content of these two ingredients versus what the recipe calls for this may have also been a source of soggy-ness. 6. All in all, it tasted great, it's an easy recipe to make and it's a good method to have learned for future tweaking to suit my needs/taste.

I've been making this for years without the breadcrumbs but it sounds like a great addition. You can make this with cheddar, jack, or farmer cheese (or combination), add mustard, spinach, broccoli or just about any vegetable. Makes a fantastic pot luck dish, and so easy. I've been asked for the recipe many times. I notice that if I use mostly cream, it's never watery (but more calories). Also good with green onions instead of regular.

I could not wait to fix this. I kept the ham, used fresh onions, asparagus and used fat free half and half for the milk and cream. It was very good.

Made this for Easter brunch. As I have an aversion to anything involving flour, I welcomed a quiche that didn't require one. I'd used the butter and bread crumb crust with the Sweet and Savory tart which I make on a regular basis, so I was confident with the outcome.Based on other's suggestions, I used fresh onion, asparagus and baked it for longer than the recipe called for. The only change I would make the next time would be to add more ham; in my first try the ham seemed to disappear and almost seemed wasted. Is definitely a make again.

i admit to omitting the ham and used fresh onion. i doubt this really "changes" the recipe so i feel safe in reviewing it. it was very watery and took almost an hour to bake for it to set. i covered it with foil after it browned so it wouldn't darken anymore witht the rest of the baking time. it was delicious when it was done. will add frozen chopped spinach, squeezed dry next time for a 'florentine' influence. can cut down on the fat using 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and 2% milk instead of whole. easy to make and relatively quick, even with the additional time to bake.

This is quite tasty but it was so watery(after 25' and cooling on a rack)-- it is now in the oven for more cooking-- We did not use ham at all, just the onions. But it tastes very good and will try it again at some point with heavy cream and half and half like one person suggested.

I thought this was fluffier than most quiches. It was definitely good, although my husband missed the crust. I actually prefer this version without the crust.

Loved it. Used fresh onion instead of frozen, an old croissant for breadcrumbs. Next time, will not use the ham and will roast some asparagus tips in place of the ham and use shallots for the onions.

It was divine intervention the day this magazine arrived in our mailbox. I had already planned to make a quiche for dinner that day, but hadn't made the crust. I ended up getting home late due to car problems and fretted about the fact I didn't have time to make a crust. Voila! Just have the quiche without the crust! I did it with feta and a package of frozen, thawed, drained spinach instead of the ham and it came out quite nicely. This is a great alternative to having crust and certainly saves time.

My guess is that those who had a watery product did not use half & half for the milk and not use heavy whipping cream. Or it could have been too moist ham, as another reviewer suggested. Try again.
