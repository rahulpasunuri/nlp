Wow. This was incredibly good. No Chorizo? Don't dismay- I made "homemade" chorizo out of some minced bacon, paprika and a pinch of cayenne.

I made this tonight for supper. It was fantastic and very quick. I couldn't find tostadas so I pan-fried corn tortillas. Using the canned refried beans and jarred salsa made the dish so easy. The combination of flavors and textures are wonderful and the goat cheese is a must. I'm always looking for dishes that are fast but have big flavor. This is one of them.

I have made this with the addition of enchillada sauce drizzled over the whole stack and have had rave reviews from family and friends.

I made this for Father's Day brunch since my husband is a big chorizo and eggs fan. Made it exactly as is (for a change!) and we all loved it! It was really easy to make, too!

It's super easy to make tostadas - just brush veg oil lightly on both sides and put in a hot oven for ten minutes - then flip them over and watch them carefully for another 7 minutes or so until they turn light brown. Also, I used queso fresco - it's so good if you can find it.

I made this for my boyfriend this morning and it was so easy! I thought that the finished product was delicious as well as visually appealing. This is the perfect thing to make for people who enjoy a little breakfast with their spice.

Love this recipe. Fried up some corn tortillas myself. Didn't have avocado, but didn't miss it. My husband used sharp cheddar & I used feta (use whatever you have). I smashed the beans up a little so they were more like refried texture. Next time will cook the onions (added green bell pepper)w/the chorizo & save a step. Served this w/some sour cream to cool it down a little. Fried the eggs like the recipe says, but you can make them however you like them. 300 oven was a little too hot & got the tostadas brown. Good, fast & easy recipe!
