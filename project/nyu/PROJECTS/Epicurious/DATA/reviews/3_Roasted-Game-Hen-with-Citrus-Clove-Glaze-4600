I have hen every year for Christmas but this sauce wasn't the sauce my uncle makes every year. Way too citrusy for my taste. I had to sweeten it up.. LOTS.

I made this for Christmas - my Polish family always has Cornish hens with a sweet orange sauce. This was totally different and far too much citrus for my taste. The cloves didn't sit too well with me and decided to leave the 1st batch of sauce on half of the hen. I ended up using marmalade and honey which made the sauce sweeter and a lot more tastier! No cloves, no problems!

My husband and I had this for Thanksgiving. We prepared it exactly as directed, except we grilled the hens instead of roasting because we were camping. This recipe is very easy, and the flavor is wonderful. It will be a regular at our house from now on. The glaze should be delecious on chicken as well.

I've actually been making this dish for years ~ it is one of my family's favorites. The children especially like the sticky sweet glaze. I DID purchase apricot jam the other day by accident and ended up substituting it for the orange marmalade and I actually preferred the flavor. Also tried doing them on the grill, but my gas bottle ran out about 10 minutes into cooking. Finished them in the oven and I have to say they were delicious. Next time, I think I will do the whole thing on the grill.

Very good. I will probably broil the hen briefly in the future to get the skin a little more crispy prior to glazing.

Easy to make with simple ingredients all from the pantry - I had a bag of leftover lemons and this was the perfect, easy recipe!

I used the glaze from this recipe and kept the game hens whole. I stuffed them with Rice A Rone Fried Rice, rubbed the hens with butter, salt and pepper and cooked at 450 for 10 min and 350 for 1 1/2 hours and it was delicious!

I thought this was ok. It wasn't as divinely tasty as I was hoping for. If I do make again, will probably just make it with a roast chicken.

This was really good and VERY easy and quick to make. the lemon flavor really came thru, although if i had to say one downside it would be the cloves were a bit strong - i would use a little less next time. i served it with a rice and pea dish that was perfect because the sauce from the c.h. helped to flavor it. will def. make this again.

I turned the oven down to 375 and roasted them about 35 minutes. Too hot oven tends to burn. However, I used a chipolte raspberry sauce that just came into the market. Excellent. I am from South Texas and it is made here. If anyone wants to know to get it, please email me at tduckworth@satx.rr.com. Wrong email listed and I do not know how to change it.

WITH MANY GAME HEN RECIPES, I WAS SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED WITH THIS ONE. ROTISSERIED IT SO I SLIPPED THE LEMON SLICES UNDER THE SKIN INCLUDING LEGS, SUBSTITUTED BRANDY FOR BOURBON FOR THE GLAZE AS WELL AS ADDING CAYENNE PEPPER FOR SOME ZING. DEFINATELY A KEEPER !

Excellent recipe for game hens. I used kitchen shears to cut the birds, and left the backbone alone. The glaze was a perfect touch, but maybe a bit too sweet. The entire meal is easy to prepare (30 mins)but the results seem complicated!

I used the marmalade mixture to baste a chicken cooking in the rotissere oven. Excellent!!

I wished that I had saved my game hens for a better recipe. At first glance I thought that the clove was a strange addition, it was. It didn't taste bad but I certainly won't make it again. I'm glad that I taste tested it with the family before serving to guests. Yuck!

This recipe was as delicious as it smelled cooking. Removing the back bone actually made the presentation prettier and easier to eat. I made a little more glaze so that you would get the full effect. My husbands comment was make this again soon!

The aroma of this dish is enormous, my wife walked in and said "WOW that smells great". The high temperature and the glaze makes the skin very crisp, with a wonderful citrus flavor that permeates through the game hen.

Light and delicious ! I loved the clove, citrus combination it give a very interesting depth to the dish. As always, it is better to use whole cloves, toast them and ground them. I also added one dried Thai Chili for a more spicy hint and used Brandy instead of Bourbon.

The glaze was very tasty, but next time I'll just use it with chicken pieces and roast it at 375 or 400. The game hens are just too fiddly to work with, and the high temperature roasting burned the glaze.
