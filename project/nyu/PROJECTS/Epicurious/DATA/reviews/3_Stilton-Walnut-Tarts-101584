I thought this was horrible and no one at my party ate it. Very disappointing. Texture and flavor were dull dull dull.

I've made this recipe many times since 1988. It works well as mini tarts for cocktail parties. I've also added a drop of fig jam.

I made this when it was first published in 1988 and have looked for it since. It works really well as an hors d'oeuvre if sliced in small squares. As it can be made ahead of time there's no last minute fuss.
