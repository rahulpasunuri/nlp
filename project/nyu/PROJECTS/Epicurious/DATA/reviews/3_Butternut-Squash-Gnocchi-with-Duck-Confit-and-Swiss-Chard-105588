As per the reviews, since moisture seemed to be an issue with the consistency of the gnocchi, I used kabocha, a dry, starchy type of winter squash. The texture seemed fine and it was easy enough to work with. I used a good imported Parmesan cheese since I love the flavor of it. I also sauteed a chopped large shallot with the duck for a little extra ooomph. And it was delicious! I'll definitely make it again for company. Also, rather than "discard" the chard stems, why not use them for another dish? It's not like they don't taste good. Likewise, I wouldn't be "discarding" any duck confit skin; it's the best part.

Loved this, altho I admit we tweaked it a bit: purchased the gnocchi, added garlic, and used a smoked duck breast since we had it. Yes, I know, this is not the same as confit but it was absolutely delicious. As we made it, also an incredibly fast recipe to make. Sorry to be one of those that changes the recipe and proclaims brilliance ... it sure was good though.

I just made the gnocchi from this recipe. First time I have tried making gnocchi so I didn't know "what to look for in terms of desired consistency" as sukiyumyum below. I used roasted pumpkin flesh instead of butternut squash, and scaled up the recipe by about a third. Even with almost twice as much flour as it called for though, my gnocchi dough was sticky and very fluid and almost impossible to work with! I let the gnocchi pieces sit on a baking tray in the fridge, touching one another for twenty minutes, and they completely adhered to each other and formed a solid mass so I had to reform all of them again. This was after I floured them thoroughly once already. I think I might try Emeril's recipe next time, or omit the potatoes and add even more flour.

I have made duck before and very much prefer to rub the duck with brown sugar and herbs then letting it slow cook in a pot of oil. Much more tender meat that way. Recipe is a good idea, just needs some fine tuning.

I placed a couple of bisected garlic cloves and a sprig of thyme in the hollow of each butternut squash half as it baked. It infuses the squash. I also used the roasted garlic in the gnocchi. I roasted the squash and spuds at a lower heat, as I thought 500 degrees sounded a bit high. I served the gnocchi as a main course dish by itself (no chard or confit) and it was very delicious. I've made gnocchi before so I knew what to look for in terms of desired consistency, otherwise this recipe would not have worked quite so well.

I tried Emeril's version of Butternut Squash Gnocchi and it was fantastic. It is served with a brown butter/sage sauce with grated Parmesan cheese. You can find it on the FoodTV website. You use all the puree from the squash, no potatoes, with flour and sage and oregano. Delish!My husband raved about it - said it is as good, if not better than he had in Rome!

The gnocchi was very nice but the duck was bland. I would make the gnocchi again as a standalone dish. I had to make a few adjustments. The gnocchi dough was very wet and sticky so I kept adding flour until the consistency was right. I also had to cook the gnocchi longer than 3 minutes - but perhaps I made my gnocchi a little bigger.

This was a delicious and impressive dish. I served it as a main course, as with what would you follow this? The gnocchi were challenging as I do not have a kitchen scale and could not get butternut squash in Luxembourg - used the standard local orange winter squash instead which had a much higher water content. Offseting that was the availability of great ready-made duck confit which is rich, fall-off-the-bone scrumptious. Yum. Next time I will use a bit more of the chard stems, rather than just the leaves.

This was good - but I am a little confused by the recipe. It calls for you to roast an entire butternut squash and then you just use 3/4 of a cup of the puree? My gnocchi didn't taste very squash like and were not even close to the orange-ish color of those pictured. Maybve I did something wrong?

I just made the gnocchi and served it as a side dish. I dotted the gnocchi with a little butter and sprinkled some parmesean cheese. YUMMY.
