Love this recipe...as a base... I added garlic and will add sarachi to the sauce next time... like others, I doubled the sauce. I added 1/2 to the fish before cooking and added the 2nd half when it was finished... re-covered and let it sit on the stovetop for 5-7 mins to rest...I used broccoli vs. broccolini as there wasn't any at the store today.. jasmine vs. basmati as I had it on hand. I will make this again and change up the fish and the veggie to keep it interesting. Hubby and kiddo ate this up! Any recipe that makes my 9 yr old eat 4 oz of fish is a keeper! This is a great weekday go-to for a dish that is tasty and healthy!

This is a great go to meal. It's delicious as written and easily adaptable. I've made the recipe using quinoa or brown rice (adjust stove top time), and whatever green veggies I have on hand. I've also played around with the sauce using different marinades or herb butters. The results are always great. A bonus is the easy clean up at the end.

This is an awesome dish. I use quinoa rather than rice and asparagus as broccolini isn't commonly found in my grocery store. It's simple and absolutely delicious!!!

It was good, used Mahi instead of Salmon. Must double the sauce otherwise there isn't enough.

I use vegetable broth because my husband doesn't eat meat. Tried it both ways and we both like regular broccoli better. I like to make sure to pour the sauce over the greens, not just the fish--the flavors are amazing and it's always a big hit!

This was a good salmon recipe, not great, but good. I wouldn't make it again though. The salmon took about 20 minutes, not 10 like the recipe said.

Rating: 2
This is a keeper for me. I gave it just 2 forks because, let's face it, it's good but not fabulous or unusual. However, it's also easy and a good dish to add to my weeknight repertoire. I am usually not one to tamper with ingredients but on this day I had red onions but not shallots, and I had parsley but not cilantro. Dish worked out fine anyway, so it's very forgiving. Next time I will use less rice; it works out to a LOT per serving. But if you have a big eater in the family, use all the rice and broth.

Rating: 4
This was an awesome and easy recipe. I would change 2 things: first, I would parboil the rice ahead, since some of the grains weren't fully cooked; and second, I wouldn't spoon the rest of the sauce over the entire dish before serving, but leave instead for each person to dish over their salmon. I found that the sauce was too strong and detracted from the savory subleness of the rice.

i've made this dish on several different occasions and it's great every time! it's very easy to make and after coming home from a long day it's nice not having to stand over a stove in order to get a great meal. i do agree about cooking the broccoli separate. i do the same thing. i put some olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper all on a baking sheet and stick it in the oven for about 8-10 minutes! perfect every time :-)

Rating: 4
I've made this twice now and it is fantastic. I'd recommend doing the broccolini separately, though, drizzled in olive oil and sprinkled with garlic salt. Stick it in the oven at the same time as the rice (and take it out a little sooner than the finished fish, depending on how much you're making) - YUM!

Excellent recipe! Perfect for a weeknight!

With a few modifications thanks to previous reviewers, I would definitely recommend this dish. I used half lime juice and half orange juice, the zest of one lime and the zest of half an orange with the honey and soy sauce. I added chopped cilantro only as a garnish, not to the sauce. After sauteeing the shallots for 4 minutes, I added 2 cloves garlic, minced and 2 teaspoons minced ginger to shallots and sauteed for one minute more before adding rice. Cooked rice for 10 minutes, topped with broccolini, then salmon and cooked for 10 minutes more. Salmon was perfectly cooked as was broccolini. Rice was sensational but whole dish is a keeper.

I thought this recipe was good, but not fantastic. Although the flavors were nice and complemented one another well, I felt that they were rather subdued and easily forgotten. I followed the recipe pretty much as written (I had just under a pound of salmon, used jasmine rice, and added 1 clove of minced garlic to the sauce), but if I were to make this again, I would definitely doctor it to get a more intense flavor - more garlic, more lime/lemon, and maybe some crushed red pepper for a bit of kick. It's worth a second shot.

Overall, I liked the recipe fine, but it wasn't amazing. The flavors were good, just rather subdued and I felt it needed something. I followed it pretty much as written (I had just under a pound of salmon, used jasmine rice, and added 1 clove of minced garlic to the sauce), but I think I'd doctor it a bit and use aspragus in lieu of broccolini if I were to make it again.

outstanding. This has become a weeknight staple, easy and incredibly delicious.

I enjoyed this recipe a lot - the salmon turned out very tender and luscious, and just barely cooked through (i.e. not a second more than it needed to be cooked), which I like. The one thing I would change is that I feel the amount of lime in the sauce is a bit too much. It was overpoweringly tangy at times. Next time I make this I will probably use half the amount of lime juice and slightly less lime zest. I also added some mashed garlic to the sauce for added flavor.

Rating: 4
My family loves this recipe! I have made it as is (sans broccolini) and we love the flavors - great flavor for the rice and nice spice/flavor that doesn't overpower the salmon. My young boys occasionally turn their noses up at salmon so tonight I subbed chicken cutlets for the salmon and it was delicious! I added about 1/2 C water before topping the rice with the chicken/sauce and cooked it for about 13-15 minutes instead of 8-10. Loved it! Will try it with shrimp next!

The rice and the salmon were delicious! Loved the flavors and I'm a limey kind of guy so I was happy leaving the recipe as is. However, a few words of caution - I found for myself that the parts of the broccolini not tucked directly under some rice and salmon were dry, so I'd recommend making a bed of broccolini on the rice before putting the salmon on. Also, the salmon cooked quickly while the broccolini remained slightly undercooked so I feel like burying them further in the rice/broth mixture will solve that problem. I'd definitely recommend it!

I made this tonight and loved it, the flavors of the rice and sauce are excellent. I used orange and lime juice as recommended by another reviewer. Prep and clean up were a cinch since everything cooked in the same pot.

I made this dish last night before I read others' reviews. I loved this dish and so did my husband. The next time I make it I'll probably try it with some orange juice in the sauce and garlic in the rice as a couple of reviewers had suggested. But it was easy to prepare. Next time it'll be even faster but it was pretty fast. I had most of the ingredients. Our broccolini was done just the way I like it.....crisp-tender as the recipe says. I just ate the leftovers for lunch and it warmed up nicely and was delicious on the second day as well.

I made this for the second time, changing the sauce because I found it too limey the first time. It was a hit with my family this time. I made the following changes: I used the juice and zest of 1 lime (approx. 1/8 cup) and the juice and zest of 1/2 an orange (approx. 1/8 cup). I substituted 3 minced garlic cloves and 1 Tbsp or more of minced ginger for the shallots. I used scallions instead of cilantro as I had them on hand. And I added about 1/4 tsp. of red chili paste to the sauce to give it a little spice. This will now become a staple in our house.

This is one of my go-to weeknight dinner recipes. The salmon and rice combo is great and the lime juice gives the rice a fantastic flavor. Very easy preparation and I love the fact that it all cooks in one pot. I use a large cast iron skillet and cover the top with foil (the cast iron lid has a plastic handle so it can't go in the stove), and this also works perfectly. Just fantastic.

Rating: 3
This recipe was so easy and convenient. I used asparagus instead of broccolini, and it came out perfectly cooked with the recommended cooking time. I don't think the sauce is too limey at all like some people. My salmon came out perfectly cooked, and with the sauce, I didn't think it was bland at all. The rice, however was the best part. Perfectly cooked and flavorful.

Rating: 3
I really liked this dish and loved that it was all done in a single pan - quick and easy to make and cleanup was a snap. I subbed baby spinach for the broccolini given some of the previous reviews that the broccolini didn't cook. I found that I had to increase the cooking time a bit to get the liquid absorbed and the fish cooked through. The salmon was very moist and tender, and the rice came out delicious. I agree with the other reviewers that the sauce is too limey or maybe missing something. Next time, I will try splitting the citrus between fresh lime juice and fresh orange juice to see if there's an improvement.

Rating: 1
I really, really wanted to like the dish, and I do like the concept. My rice was underdone following the recipe cooking times. The salmon was very moist, but woefully underseasoned. It needs to marinate in something first. Also, the lime covered the soy and honey flavors. I like citrus, but this was overpowering and unfinished tasting. There are better salmon recipes on this site.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent way to serve salmon. I found the sauce to be just perfect - not too sweet or too much lime. I left out the cilantro because I'm not fond of it, but other than that I did not make changes to the recipe. I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 2
The rice was very good but overall the Fish was way to mild tasting for our families pallets. We love cooking with Salomon but in this dish the lime was overwhelming and the other flavors were washed out by lime. Top that off with an unseasoned piece of fish and it became a negative vote for us. I wont be using this recipe again...but I will use the rice portion of it again...maybe I will try to marinate the fish for a few hours in a good marinade and that will change the dish around.

i was skeptical when i read this but made anyway without looking at reviews. i used brown basmati-mistake. the broccolini was charred on top and felt that the overall taste was too "limey" making it taste almost like vinegar. would not make again- there are so many better, similar recipes out there.

The dressing for this is pretty good if used sparingly. I made this with regular long grain rice which I combined in the end. The scallions in the rice was a nice addition I'll probably use again.

Rating: 3
Definitely a do over. Following the recommendations of other reviewers I cut back on the lime juice and steamed the broccolini before adding it to the pot. I ended up using italian parsley instead of cilantro b/c my cilantro was slimy. We loved it - especially the rice.

I used brown basmati rice instead of white, I ended up cooking the rice for 25 more minutes and adding about 1/2 cup more chicken stock. USE ONLY WHITE BASMATI! I used one whole 2.5lbs peice of salmon, this worked great! In the end everything came out fantastic, everyone was raving about the wonderful flavors. I would make this again, but I would use white rice, and also I would use the glaze when grilling salmon on ceder planks.

This dish tastes bright and fresh. I used arctic char and it was meltingly tender. Also subbed in turnip greens and a teensy bit of mustard greens in place of broccolini and instant brown rice for the basmati. The combination of flavors works well here. Yum!

I made this last night--I am not use to cooking rice and since the recipe didn't specifically say "white" rice, I bought brown basamti rice-- followed the instructions and soon learned brown rice takes much longer to cook. I held my breath and continued "baking" the rice for 50 minutes and then completed the recipe, substituting spinach--the results were awesome. What a deliciously simple and satisfying dish. Brown rice/white rice, the end result is still the same--4 forks.

Rating: 1
flavor was ok--agree that it was a little too limey. my biggest complaint is that it didn't cook at all like it was supposed to. the broccolini was still raw when the rest of it was done. maybe blanching it first would help, but i was disappointed enough with it overall that i won't try again.

Yes, I know how fussy many are,hey,I was Very fortunate to have the butcher who knew me,and I got a whole Salmon(farm-raised),the person instructed Me on how to quickly cut and fillet the Large Salmon,and yes, I did have a few guests who wanted to help Me ,Thank-You friends !Since I did not really read about broccolini, I used potatoes,cauliflower,and zucchini along with two cheese sauces,and ,O K boxed rice,starts with a M. Yes I did leave out the lime,but the honey, was a Huge delight ! Wow did the kitchen smell Awesome, as well as the dining area ! Oh yeah, I did leave sides for everyone to add some of this and that , as I always do. It seems like for the last 15 years when I have my extra heat-plates,with the sides , everyone has their choice of adding their extra favorite vegetables ,yes, and rice too ! Michael, in Albuquerque

The fish was way too limey. The rice was fabulous (like a risotto). Used brocolli and it didn't cook well enough, would definitely steam it first. I ended up making up a new sauce (with soy, horseradish, garlic) to put over the fish at the end to cut the overwhelming citrus taste. The reason I even gave this two forks is the rice was great, and I like the concept. I think this is a recipe that could be played with, a different sauce, different veggie (asparagus maybe?) and it could be 4 forks. As is...2 is generous.

wonderful and healthy (except for sodium.) took the advice of another reviewer and replace the broccolini with spinach since I had fresh spinach from the farmer's market.

A lot of the Epicurious recipes people rave about don't work as well for me it seems, but this one was a winner. I left out some of the lime peel and subbed onion and garlic for the shallot as I didn't find any in the supermarket. Used my Creuset dutch oven and was relieved to see that the plastic knob on the top didn't melt at 450 Farenheit. This is a winning salmon recipe. Served with thin asparagus that I ended up cooking separately because I ran out of space in the pot.

Came up as "Recipe of the Day" yesterday and I had most ingredients on hand so figured it was a good time to give it a try. Wow - simple, delicious, and SO HEALTHY! The salmon was melt-in-your-mouth perfect! I did substitute jasmine rice for basmati since it's what I had, but would do the basmati next time - the creaminess of the jasmine combined with the soy was a little too reminiscent of sushi for what I expected. I also substituted spinach - just mixed it in with the hot rice after the first round of baking, and once it wilted a bit added the salmon as the final step. Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today!

Think about all them poor bears in Alaska missing this plate of Salmon!! Poker Guys give this a thumbs up for a Fish entree. We all liked the lime but would have been just as good without the honey. All in All though it is a taste thing we liked it. I will make this again over the Holidays for sure.

I really enjoyed this and thought it a nice mix of flavors. I did think the broccolini came out dry and next time may make the broccolini separately. I would have given 31/2 stars if possible. My meat and potatoes bf was so so about this dish as well, which does not bode well for it in our household.

I thought this was very flavorful. I did add some wasabi, more soy, some horseradish and I used broccoli instead of the broccolini. It will def. become a staple meal. I think next time I may add garlic.

Made this recipe last night and it turned out much better than anticipated. Halved the recipe since there were only two of us eating and substituted Jasmine rice for the Basmati as it was already on the shelf. Cooked the salmon and broccolini for 9 minutes and they turned out perfectly cooked. The rice was the big welcome surprise as it emerged from the pot with a risotto-like creaminess. Not sure why so many had issues with the taste of the broccolini, though, as ours delivered on the taste as expected with no bitterness. I do agree with several who suggested a reduction in the amount of citrus as it was a bit over-powering. Next time, I will reduce the amount of lime and zest 1/3 to 1/2 to begin with and then make further tweaks to fine tune the final ratios. Overall, this recipe ended up a 'keeper' for us.

Rating: 3
Honestly, this is a really solid dish and is perfect for beginners. If there were to be any criticisms, it would be the method for cooking the broccolini. Rather that cook it in the oven, I threw it one the grill with some balsamic and a dash of parmesan and then drizzled it with some olive oil. That seemed to put it into high gear.

Love, love, love this recipe. Big fan of the one pot meals but this one fantastic. The lime-honey glaze sets the whole dish off to sheer yumminess. Substituted super-skinny asparagus for the broccolini and still successful.

broccolini was nothing impressive, and undercooked so we had to separately boil them to be cooked. the sauce was far to citrusy and overpowering. Perhaps reducing the lime by half (especially the lime peel)? On the positive side, it did look like the picture....

I made this last night, substituted chicken broth for vegetable one and didn't notice any difference. I steamed the broccolini separate and just added a bit of the sauce at the end for flavour. I also used brown basmati rice and took forever to cook and it turned out with the consitency of risotto. The taste was good, but didn't look very appealing. The salmon was too bland for my taste, as it "boiled" in the rice. Next time I'll do the rice in the stove and cook the salmon separate. The sauce was tasty though.

I made this last night and it was outstanding! I used brown basmati rice and added more broth since it took 40 min. in the oven before adding the fish. I used broccoli only because my grocer didn't have the broccolini, but will definitely try it next time. The broccoli could have used a little par-cooking since we prefer medium on the salmon, but it was still edible.

Exceptionally easy and tasty for a weeknight meal. Subbed broccoli (cut skinny with long stems) for broccolini. Omitted the cilantro. My citrus-crazy family loved the sauce. I did use close to 4 c. of broth/water overall - maybe my pan's lid wasn't that tight-fitting.

Based on previous reviews, I left out the broccolini. Thought rice and fish were super easy to prepare and very quick. My 10yo son thought the fish was too "lime flavored" so next time I might leave out the lime peel. Overall a winning weeknight dinner!

This is a great weeknight meal. I used broccoli instead of broccolini and made sure to cut it up pretty small so it would be tender enough. I cooked the salmon/broccoli 13 minutes, but I had six portions vs. four.

I only gave this three folks b/c the broccolini very nearly ruined the dish. The salmon and rice - and esp the lime-based sauce were divine, but the broccolini was disgusting cooked this way: slimey and bitter and we dug out every bit of it right at the table. Perhaps it was overcooked? No matter, the salmon was perfectly done. Next time I'll plate the salmon and stir in some fresh spinach and let it wilt - I think that might have been the idea anyway.
