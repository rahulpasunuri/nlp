pretty good! used ground chicken & pork and used homemade salt-free taco seasoning (that included chipotle powder) because that's what i had on hand when i wanted to make this. the fritos added a nice mexican-y kind of flavor, which was good for a change from the usual meatloaf; served with spanish rice and refried beans. would make this again

Hello, I am not sure which Frito Lay employee hi-jacked these notes, but corn chips don't have to be fritos. I use the leftover crumbs at the bottom of the tortilla chip bag to make this dish all the time and my friends love it. Doesn't hurt to spice it up a bit either.

This is a really yummy meatloaf recipe. Per a previous reviewer's comment I used extra chili sauce and I'm glad I did. I don't think it would be nearly as flavorful without the extra sauce. I'm not usually a fan of meatloaf, but I would happily make this recipe again.

My husband is not a big fan of meatloaf, but he really likes this recipe. I've been making it for 10 years, since the recipe came out in Bon Appetite in 1995. Tasty and different.

I enjoyed this recipe, especially because I am a Frito's lover. I would add additional chili sauce next time.

I've made this several times- great combination of ingredients, not bland at all. I've also doubled the recipe and froze half (airtight seal, uncooked meat) for a fast and easy weeknight meal.

My family loves this meatloaf recipe. I add a few more fritos and chili sauce. The green bean recipe is also good, but I use more white wine vinegar than the recipe calls for.

I thought this sounded good, but I was disappointed with the taste. I wouldn't make it again.

Very easy to make and always good! I use extra hot chili sauce for an extra zing.

This was the best meatloaf we have ever tasted. We were over to a friends for dinner and she served this wonderful meatloaf. I have been looking or the recipe for months. Finally tonight the name came to mind that it was a blue plate special. Fantastic - she gave me the recipe but it was not complete. We like this dish more than anything I have ever made. We have it quite frequently and now I will have exactaly how it is made. You made my day. Nancy

I didn't care for this recipe and I'm one of the few people who like meatloaf. The corn chips were overpowering and the green onions didn't give it enough onion flavor. Like the chili sauce and plan to use that with another meatloaf recipe.

This tasted like plain old frito pie to me. It was ok but nothing I would make again. Pretty blah.

I am a fan of meat loaf, so I am always looking for a good recipe and this one is GREAT! Very easy to make and great flavors! It is now one of my favorite meat loaf recipes!

A CROWD FAVORITE. ALWAYS REQUESTS FOR RECIPE. I USE GROUND VEAL INSTEAD OF PORK. ALSO, REPLACE THE FRITOS WITH BREADCRUMBS. DOUBLE THE CHILI SAUCE ALSO.

This was so yummy. I love meatloaf anyway but this has a nice new flavor to it. Has almost a tamale flavor between the fritos and the chili sauce. Served it with the mashed potatos and green beans as recommended. Although between the meatloaf with Fritos and the green beans with bacon fat this isn't a low-fat affair...it was worth the splurge.

A nice change from the normal blah meatloaf. I doubled the recipe and packed it into a large bread loaf pan. Then, I inverted into a rectangled greased casserole dish. Baked for 20 minutes, covered with remaining chili sauce, then bake it for an additional 20 minutes. For a meatloaf, it looked rather attactive as well as tasty.

This was absolutely the best meat loaf that I have ever eaten! It had a really good flavor and texture and was seasoned perfectly. This will be a family favorite. Now, I can put meat loaf back on my family dinner menu again!

What a reaction! My husband LOVED this, said it was the best meat loaf he'd ever had. My son was too busy snarfing to comment. I'll definitely make this again. BTW, I doubled the recipe and made one large loaf. I might ease off on the pork-to-beef ratio next time, but this was yummy.

I doubled the recipe and made "big loaves". My husband and I said we'd save the leftovers for another day....Until we tasted it!! We devoured the whole thing. Very rich---top with shredded cheese, if you like your meatloaf that way. It's great with plain mashed potatoes(no gravy or butter, maybe some horeseradish) and plain green beans--canned or regular.

This is better than MOM's meatloaf. My family and clients liked it! Even I, who is not fond of meatloaves, have to admit it is not too bad.

It's an interesting twist on a "normal" meat loaf -- my husband and I both liked it.
