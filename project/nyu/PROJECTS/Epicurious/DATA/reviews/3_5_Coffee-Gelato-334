Made the base last night per the recipe, but following the suggestions cut back on the sugar. Because it made less than expected I will be making another batch today before freezing it all and will increase the sugar to about 3/4 of a cup. What I noticed is those that used brewed espresso seem to have the issue with sweet overpowering the coffee. The powdered espresso in the ratio listed is actually triple strength. I had considered brewing my own until seeing that.

This gets 4 forks with half the sugar and three shots of espresso, as other reviewers have suggested. Simple, delicious, wonderful consistency and healthier than recipes that call for cream. This will become a standard for me.

Love this. I've made it a few times. This time I added a cup of chopped Heath Bar. Only used .5 cups sugar. Served it over a brownie. Heath Bar took it to another level. A crowd pleaser!

I agree with the sweetness assessment - 1 full cup of sugar in 1.5 cups milk is entirely overkill. Next time I'm going with .5 cups. I pulled 4 - 1 oz espresso shots instead of using the powder. It's cooling in the fridge - I'll let you know how it came out.

I was so excited to make this recipe after reading all of the great reviews. The only change I made was that I used real brewed espresso instead of instant. However, I found the gelato to be entirely too sweet. Although it had a nice coffee flavor, I feel the sweetness took over and I am not sure I will finish the eating the batch. I will make this again, but use half the sugar called for.

This was a great gelato! I made a batch of espresso and used that instead of the instant stuff. I found it was a bit too sweet though, and will cut back on the sugar next time.

I used real expresso b/c I could not find the powered version. It was a gift to my taste buds! I served it at a dinner party and everyone fell in love with it.

This amazing coffee gelato was a real hit with my family. I replaced the instant espresso powder with brewed expresso and the flavour was incredible.

AMAZING...I couldn't stop tasting it with a spoon even before the ice cream maker finished churning it. Used 2 tbsp instant coffee. Great taste, smooth texture...a definite winner!

Excellent texture and flavor. It even works if you don't quite the temperature right.

I thought this was a very tasty and easy recipe. I have made it several times. I usually just use about 2 tbs. instant coffee, especially the flavored types such as hazelnut. Yum!

This was delicious DESPITE the fact that I let it get a little too hot on the stove so it was slightly grainy (I was trying to do 3 things at once, as usual). You gotta love a recipe that you can mess up and the result still tastes great! Next time I will add some scraped vanilla bean to make this even more interesting.

This recipe is excellent when you replace the powdered espresso with a really good shot of the real stuff. Even the best quality powdered I could find did not compare with the real thing.
