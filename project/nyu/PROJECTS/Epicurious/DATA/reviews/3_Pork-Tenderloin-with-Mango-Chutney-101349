I had leftover pork tenderloin from another dinner, so I just made the mango chutney part, and threw the pork in a skillet with some cumin. I also made couscous with cumin in it. I mixed everything together to make a couscous, pork, and mango "salad" and it was great! The only thing I omitted was the jalepeno (didn't have one), and I think when I make it again I'll make sure I add it, as it definitely would've added more flavor. So, my version was a 2 start, but I think the real recipe was definitely 3!

Followed the recipe quanities and ingredients other than using only one tenderloin. The mango chutney was very flavorful and complimented the curry seasoning on the tenderloin. Served this with Broiled, Marinated Eggplant on this site from Gourmet 2001. Incredible flavors from both of these dishes on one plate.

Fine food. I'd give it 3.5 forks but don't have the option. Used boneless pork loin chops, brined 1 hour and rinsed/dried. Then, doused with olive oil (as others recommended) & allowed to soak in oil 15 minutes. Came out moist and tasty (can come out dry without brining & the extra oil). The chutney made it especially memorable. Thumbs up. Used cumin powder, toated slightly, instead of seed. Worked. Will make again.

Wow, great recipe! The sauce is incredible (I added some cilantro when it cooled). I found that the tenderloins (exterior) were a little dry on the grill so the next time I will marinate in a olive oil, cilantro, lime, salt and pepper an hour or two before grilling. And 20 minutes would have been way to long, I cooked it for 14 minutes. Also, I did not have cumin seeds so I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cumin after I sauteed the onion.

I prepared this recipe for dinner guests and everyone loved it. The different flavors in the chutney were wonderful with the pork tenderloin. I will definitely serve this dish again.

simple and quick -- substituted Thai bird chili and bumped up the ginger -- deglazed the pan with a little bit of the Conundrum I was enjoying at the time. Basmati rice and blanched snap peas round out the dish.

very good recipe. even my picky "I don't like anything" kids loved it. we used a 3 lb pork loin roast, increased the ingredients to cover the extra weight and rotisseried it. About the only other change we'll make next time is to decrease the amount of ginger, as it overpowered the taste of the mango.

I added lime zest and more fresh ginger, and it was wonderful.

The pork was great with the curry, i thought it wouldn't be enough flavor, but it was. BUt the chutney made the dish. I had to use substitutions, cumin and ginger powder, still could taste the flavors. Can't wait to make again with cumin seeds and fresh ginger.

Delicious! My husband made this for dinner last night. Although a good cook, he rarely works from a recipe, preferring to develop his own dishes. This time he followed the recipe and with great results. The pork was very flavourful, moist and tender and the mango chutney was wonderful - an excellent blend of sweet and spicy, cool and hot. The chutney is definitely not bland as one reviewer stated and really makes this dish - next time I would increase the ginger and add lime zest. If you are looking for a different way to prepare/serve pork tenderloin, this is a superb recipe! You will not be disappointed!

Based on other reviews I skipped making the chutney and used a good quality prepared chutney instead. I thought the combination of the chutney and curry was interesting so I followed the rest of the recipie. I grilled the pork on a gas grill using the recommended medium high heat however after searing the pork moved it to another spot on the grill away from the flame and cooked it using indirect heat. I think it would have been blackened tenderloin otherwise! Very good flavors.

The pork was nice. The chuntney was fairly good, but I didn't have the chili to spice it up.

Pleasently surprised at how good the chutney was (used all fresh ingredients) by itself. The curry rub and mango chutney were superb together. The jalepeno in the chutney was tasty and mild, allowing the curry to provide the spice.

I had to substitute powdered spices and added some brown sugar to the chutney to contrast with the jalapeno and lime. I used fresh frozen mango that I thawed, but would have been better if fresh. All in all, the flavors were a nice change.

I thought the salsa was okay but blah. I would certainly look for another recipe to use for a pork tenderloin.

The pork was wonderful, but the chutney wasn't as good as I hoped it would have been. A nice dish, but not worth the trouble.

I made this recipe as is; it was wonderfully tangy. My dinner guests loved it too. May I suggest serving it with a side of grilled squash or zucchini?

Delicious. Beautiful and fun to make. I used pork thick pork chops (tenderloins were puny and expensive), and cut jalepeno in half - it was still plenty hot. Also, served with lots of steamed rice. My husband and guest were delighted - three of us easily ate the recipe for 6. I love technique and results that make cooking and eating an adventure - very high marks for this treat.
