Okay don't tell I used frozen corn - I mean FROZEN undefrosted corn. My house guests left and I was wiped out and I needed a side dish and the first Sunday night football game of the season was about to start so I dumped everything together to marinate while I whipped everything else together and the corn defrosted quickly but the funny thing is it perked up the arugula and made the whole salad super chilled and seriously delicious. The Parmesan is optional in my opinion, I used it but don't think I will next time. This was so fresh and summery tasting I can only imagine how great it will be when I use real corn!

This salad was amazing. There is more dressing than needed, so be sure not to just pour all of it on the salad at once. But a terrific combo of flavors.

Exccellent summer salad. I cooked the corn kernals for about 5 mins with a clove of garlic. Only other change was that I added a Tspn of balsamic to the dressing. Have made it several times this summer - a hit every time.

So many flavors--peppery, salty, sweet. Perfect for a warm summer night when you don't want to cook--although I did broil the corn for a few minutes.

I love this salad! It's a great showcase for fresh summer produce! I wouldn't change a thing!

I would leave out the basil. The basil over-powered the flavor of arugula. When I eat an arugula salad I want to be able to taste it.

we grew arugula this year,and will again just for this salad. i brushed the corn with olive oil then seasoned and grilled to add "depth of flavor".excellent!

I prefer the other recipe for Arugula and Corn Salad on this site....to me, it had more flavor, but overall a good starting point. I added grilled chicken breast to make it a meal.

Great summer salad. Add a can of tuna and hold the cheese for a wonderful light lunch

This is so terrific! I found corn on sale (so early in spring!!) at my local market. It was light and wonderful. I forgot to put the cheese on and it was still great. I know that with it, it would be even more wonderful. I can't go on enough.

What a wonderful salute to the end of summer, when the garden gives it all up at once! Delicious, nutritious, and a classic twist on summer salads.

Too traditional? I don't think so. It is a refreshing change to visit a good classic. When all of the ingredients are in season why not let them just shine on their own!

I used "peaches and cream" corn from the farmstand, my neighbor's cherry tomatoes and arugula...it was wonderful and sublime. Easy as well and that always counts for high marks in my book.

Too traditional? I loved it. A very fast and tasty mid-week dinner. Love the peppery bite of the arugula with the juicy sweet corn and tomatoes. The tomatoes, basil and lemons came out of my garden. Use the ripest, sweetest tomatoes and corn you can find. May try roasting the corn next time.

Very easy, and a wonderful combination of flavors. I've also made it without the basil, and it's just as good that way!
