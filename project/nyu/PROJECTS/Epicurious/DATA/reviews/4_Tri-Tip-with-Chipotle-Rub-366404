EXCELLENT! I rubbed one recipe onto 2 good sized tri-tips, put them in the fridge overnight then BBQd them the next day. Friends who dont normally even eat beef were going back for seconds and thirds! There was lots of bbq chicken left overs (which was also pretty dang good) but there wasnt any beef. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

The Tri-Tip with Chipotle Rub was really wonderful. The grilling directions were spot-on, and we ended up with a beautiful, medium rare, juicy steak. I wasn't sure that I'd be able to find a tri-tip steak, or dried chipotle peppers, and pink peppercorns for the rub, but sure enough, I was able to find everything that I didn't already have. I only used about 1/3 of the rub, and while the steak was spicy, it wasn't, IMHO, overly spicy - just right! This is a dish that will be repeated many times at our house.
