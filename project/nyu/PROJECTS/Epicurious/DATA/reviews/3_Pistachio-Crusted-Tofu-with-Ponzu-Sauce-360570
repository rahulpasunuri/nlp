Great way to have tofu! Even the non-tofu lovers in the family liked this one. I don't use mayo, so I used plain yogurt, which turned out fine. I also made a mix of half pistachios and half panko (to use up the last bit of it, which wasn't enough for a full recipe of anything), which was quite good. Also agree extra firm would be best; I used firm as the recipe called for, and while it didn't fall apart, it was a little softer than it I'd like, both for lifting in and out of coatings and the pan, and for eating (it was a little soft in the middle). Will definitely make it again.

Very tasty and quick. Made a mixed vegetable stir fry and brown rice. Used light mayo to reduce calorie count (no difference in taste) and next time I'm going to try baking it instead of sauteeing/frying. Note to person who used sesame oil -- not good for sauteeing! Canola or safflower or peanut would all have worked.

Made with extra firm tofu. served over sesame quinoa. (quinoa cooked with celery, carrot, onion in chix broth with dash of sesame oil and soy sauce). Perfect compliment! Only goof was that i over processed the pistachios and it got too paste like. other than than, easy peasy.

Very quick to make - I would say that the total active time was closer to 20 minutes. Would suggest using *extra* firm tofu. We felt like using firm tofu yielded a slightly mushy center to the tofu block even after cooking. I agree that the nuts need to be chopped very finely in order to stick to the cube. Overall, good recipe. A bit calorie high due to the mayo, but this could be easier reduced should you want to.

I've made this twice now--and it is a new favorite with my boyfriend and me. However--I do improvise on the ponzu sauce, since on a weeknight I'm too hectic to go looking for it. Here's what I use: about 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce, juice of 1/2 orange, about two tsps. lemon juice, some superfine sugar and 1 TB rice wine. This is a very, very loose approximation of ponzu sauce-- but it tastes great with the recipe and uses more common items.

Hmmm - I guess I missed something with this recipe. It totally fell apart! I like the flavors (my first time using ponzu) but I was definitely eating a piece of tofu, then scooping up broken pieces of pistatio crust. I didn't have peanut oil, so used seasame - that may have been it? Or didn't use enough mayo?

My husband and I thought this recipe was wonderful. I served it with bulgur (to soak up some sauce,yum!), and summer squash sauteed with 2 rinsed anchovies.Awesome...

I really liked this dish--quick, but interesting. My pistachios didn't stay "crusted" all that well, but I probably didn't chop them finely enough. I served it over soba noodles, and it went over well!

My execution wasn't perfect - I didn't chop the pistachios finely enough - but the flavors just didn't do it for me.

Loved it. I'm vegetarian and have cooked tons of tofu in my day; this is definitely one of the tastiest recipes I've come across. Love that it's only 5 ingredients.
