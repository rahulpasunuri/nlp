This is fabulous combo of flavors, however I recommend changing the order of adding the ingredients. Adding the onion first really encourages the starchy potatoes to stick to the bottom of the pan (along with all the onions eventually). If you saute the onions and peppers with the sausage and add them later it will prevent this. So far I've made it twice. The second time I added a little chopped kale before adding the sausage back into the mix.I also added a clove of minced garlic. There seems to be wee bit too much sausage in this, but it is easily remedied with another potato or 2, or by using less of it. Pickled beets with potato hash is awesome! I love this dish.

This is a great hearty breakfast recipe. I often substitute sweet potatoes for regular potatoes and it turns out great. Also recommend using fresh instead of dried thyme. The blue cheese is the star, egg on top and you are opening your day in style...
