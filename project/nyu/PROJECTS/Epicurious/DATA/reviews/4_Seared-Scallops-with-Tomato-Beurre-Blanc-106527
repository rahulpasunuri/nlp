Just made it. Was not that good. It's also a very greasy sauce. Actually, both my husband and I preferred the scallops without the sauce-- with just a little bit of butter.

Just made this- but I did not have the tomatoes as called for in the recipe. I did have a tube of concentrated tomato paste & used that instead. A bit of guesswork involved here. I served it over orzo with steamed broccoli as a side & it was delicious- not a morsel was left!

While the beurre blanc had good flavor, I don't think the sweetness worked well with the scallops. We prefer something saltier with scallops such as bacon or prosciutto so I won't make this again. But, if you like sweeter sauces, you will enjoy this recipe. Served with parmesan garlic cauliflower "rice".

This is my go to recipe for scallops. It is so simple and very impressive. Still trying to figure out the best sides to serve with it though...

This was the first time at our attempt in making scallops, and it definitely won't be the last. This recipe was delicious! We served it with mashed red skin potatoes, which went really well with the beurre blanc.

I have two boys ages 11 and 13 I always feel like the allstar when there friends love a recipe I cook. The football team finished every scallop and wanted more!

Made this for a large group as part of a "surf and turf" with smoked beef tenderloin. Big hit! I had doubled the beurre blanc recipe and we just had the leftovers spooned over a simple baked fish. Almost liked that better because I didn't want to overwhelm the scallops too much.

Delicious. Will make again and again. Made w/ Risotto con Parmigiano-Reggiano from this site.

so so yummy, we love scallops, and this may have been the best we've had- the butter must help! I used the wrong tomatoes on accident (the ones in oil) but it still came out really delicous. It was also pretty easy, I was able to make it and take care of my toddler at the same time, inlcuding putting her to bed.

My husband made this for me as a special, Valentine's Day dinner. It was truly excellent. We ran into a time crunch, so he was unable to make the tomato butter as described. It made it a bit more challenging when adding butter to the sauce; however, it turned out great. Served it with a little rice, which was great to soak up some of the delicious sauce. Plan to make again.

This was fabulous. I put the scallops over couscous and wilted spinach, though, which made it considerably heartier and the butteryness of the couscous accented the beurre blanc, while the spinach subdued the saltiness of the olives.

Delicious! I didn't have enough scallions, so added minced white onion in a 1:1 ratio -- the recipe still turned out well. I had leftover beurre blanc and used it on shrimp and rice pilaf, which turned out wonderfully. I'm definitely going to try some of the dishes other reviewers have used the sauce for.

Amazing how versatile this dish is! I searched for a tomato beurre blanc/nantais and found this. I made it with 1 lb fresh scallops and 1 lb spinach/ricotta ravioli and added a sliced orange bell pepper to the pasta as it cooked. did my carmelized mushroom risotto and garlic green beans as sides and garnished with some fresh basil...!!!

Just made this for lunch - was great. I served with orzo which I cooked while making the sauce. I spooned some of the sauce over the orzo, then set a bowl with the remaining sauce over the pan with orzo to keep warm while searing scallops. Also topped with a bit of fresh grated parm and served with steamed green beans. Will definitely make again!

Just made this simple and delicious recipe for the first time last night . . . but I substituted roasted red peppers for the tomatoes. It turned out really well. I blogged about it with photos at Food Rockz. Cheers!

This is fantastic and so simple, yet it appears that hours were spent preparing. I served it with Caesar Salad and wild rice. It is definitely on my must make often list.

This dish has become a monthly "must make" for us, just delicious. Yes buttery, yes rich, but you only live once, might as well enjoy yourself! I like to serve it over risotto to grab some of the sauce. Yum!

The tomatoes add just enough acidity to the butter sauce, and balance the richness of the scallops just perfectly. It's important to make sure that your scallops are Dry-Pack (none of that wicked tripolyphosphate solution that can just ruin good scallops), or you won't get a good sear on them. This dish may be too rich for an entree, but it's an amazing first course served with raw spinach.

Deliciously rich, yet delicate. The sauce complements the scallops but lets the scallop flavor come through. Easy to make for company; just make the tomato butter ahead of time and keep refrigerated. A wonderful dish!

Even a novice chef can prepare this easily. The individual baked Alaskas were a stunning conclusion to our meal. My dinner guests were quite impressed, and it was all sooo easy!

Very rich and decadent. While tasty, I've concluded that I like scallops so much that I prefer them with a lighter sauce. I made this recipe for two by making the full batch of tomato butter but then using only 1/2 for making about 1/2 the beurre blanc. The leftover tomato butter was delicious in mashed potatoes I made a few days later.

I halved the recipe and served it with the wilted baby spinach and straw potatoes. This was very tasty although my potatoes came out larger than what is recommended.
