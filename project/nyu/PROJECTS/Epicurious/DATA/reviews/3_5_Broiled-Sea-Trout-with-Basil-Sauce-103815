I caught a Sea Trout today and not having ever made/eaten one before, I found this recipe. I switched the parsley for cilantro. I used very little oil and the juice from half a lemon, a squirt of water from my sprayer. I took the previous reviewers advice and broiled the sauce on the fish. I used no additional oil on the fish simply sprayed oil on the pan under the skin. This recipe came out very good...ohh we took the advice of the author and served with a tomato gratin.

This recipe was my base for a meal of Spanish Mackerel and flax ligunine. Did not use the water and used the lemon over the pesto covered fish filets. I added to the basil recipe a 1/4 cup of toasted walnuts, 1/3 cup of grated parmesan and served this sauce over 2 mackerel filets and as a pesto aauce for the liguini. Sooo good! Other than the changes made to accommodate the ligunine and all worked well including the blender.

There were several problems with this recipe. As instructed, our Cusinart blender could not chop the herbs. The basil and parsley leaves sat atop the blade as it spun below, forcing me to leave the top off to push the leaves down with a large spoon avoiding the spinning blade. I emptied blender of herbs onto a cutting board and chopped them myself. Once they were back in the blender, it was difficult to puree the chopped herbs without constant attention, stopping and starting the blender. Broiling a thick piece of bluefish fillet was a major chore. Following the recipe, it was way undercooked. Back in the broiler, it overcooked. Finally, the puree was tasty but not our favorite. This is not going on our "make again" list.

Just made the sauce to put on poached Red Snapper. I used packed cups of basil and parsley, and so had to add extra water, lemon and garlic.

This one was okay, though perhaps not enough to bring the excellent mackerel flavors out. By the way, there aren't enough mackerel recipes on this site! It is an amazing fish, especially broiled whole. But I digress... I did use whole mackerel and made the 'sauce' with a mortar and pestle. The whole recipe doesn't need nearly this much olive oil, I thought, though, and you can make up for this with more lemon juice or perhaps just using an oil spray to coat the mackerel instead of so much oil. Anyway, it was good, but I think other flavors, like a simple one with cumin and lemon juice, complement the mackerel so much more.

Was it just me, or was it impossible to finely chop the basil and parsley in the blender? I wound up doing it in the food processor, but it needed more lemon juice.

This is an excellent trout recipe! Like the other reviewers, broiling the sauce with the fish makes good sense. This is the second time I've prepared this but this time, I substituted water with white wine.

Fantastic. After fishing trout and cooking ither ways, this is by far the best recipe yet. Extra basil and lemon juice make even better. Contrary to other reviews, 7 minutes is perfect (remember, fish will vook itself another 20 degrees after removed from oven!).

Good.. I would make it again if I had excess basil to use up but it's not one of my favorite fish recipes.

I made this dish with mackerel. I found mackerel rather strong, but loved the sauce. I used cilantro instead of basil and have been using the left over sauce on everything. I'd eat cardboard covered in this sauce!

I made this receipe with bluefish. I find this fish usually very strong. It is not my favorite. But with this sauce it was wonderful. My husband put the sauce on his twice baked potatoes also. I will be making this one again. Very pesto like.

The fish took much more than 7 minutes to be cooked through - about 16 minutes. Otherwise, great recipe.

Quite tasty. I broiled the fish with sauce and served it with a cold potato, green bean and tomato salad.

Don't like fish that is broiled, because of the fishy taste, however it not only tasted great but the preparation was easy .

This was AMAZING - best fish dish we've had in a LONG time - in restaurant or home! I suggest cooking the fish with the sauce (pesto) already drizzled on top

this dish is absolutely delicious. i made it using mackerel (so good!!) and it worked out really well. it's a nice recipe because the amounts of the ingredients for the sauce can be shifted to your taste. i upped the amounts of everything just a bit and it was more than enough for 4 (i used about 3 lbs of fillets). i also increased the amount of garlic... mmmmm. i served it with a fennel salad and a simple rice pilaf.

This was a delicious recipe. One that I will keep on file for future use. I used Mackerel which I had caught in the Gulf Stream off the coast of Ocracoke Island, NC. Wow. It was great. I broiled it for 8 minutes, and it was perfect. :d :) yum!
