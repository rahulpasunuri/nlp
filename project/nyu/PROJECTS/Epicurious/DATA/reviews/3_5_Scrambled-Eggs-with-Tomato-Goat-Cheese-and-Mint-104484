We were very disappointed with this recipe. I agree with the previous reviewer that it lacked flavor.

These were nothing that special. It lacked flavor- had a simple, simple taste! I don't think I'd make again.

I made this last Sunday morning for breakfast. It was great. I was concerned about the mint but it worked really well.

foodlover husband after he returned home from one of his gigs (drummer). However, due to the circumstances I had to use oregano instead of mint. We both loved it. So delicious and easy. I beleive he will be going away more so that I'll make it again.

Just made this for Christmas Day breakfast. Didn't have any mint, so I used fresh minced rosemary (1 TBS) and it was delicious. Also, used Montchevre instead of Montrachet...yummy. It got rave reviews from my family and was so easy to make.

Yum! I expected the mint to be overpowering, but it was just right. I may substitute sun-dried tomatoes for the fresh ones next time, or use a combination of the two, just for the fun of it. This was lovely for Christmas morning!

I prefer goat cheese and tomatoes with basil instead of mint!

Sometimes, those of us who are pressed for time, need a little reminder that we don't need to have a gourmet "Meal" to prove anything. I'm sure ALL of our parents served a basic. Some may have even appreciated, that MOM saved a little time for herself, if not, get over it- BRATS

Such crankiness! I certainly don't want Epicurious to send me only recipes that they know I'll like. I enjoy picking and choosing from the huge variety that they offer. Many times none of the recipes appeal to me and I take the liberty of deleting them. Other times I copy them all to make another day. Thanks, Epicurious, for opening my eyes to so many different, delicious, and exciting dishes.

This is great! To think that I always thought eggs could only be hard boiled. (hey.... I'm just teasing Cook NH)

Seriously, stop complaining...some people are kitcken clutzes and appreciate the extra help. Just click next on your browser if you can't bear seeing this or the bacon and egg recipe.
