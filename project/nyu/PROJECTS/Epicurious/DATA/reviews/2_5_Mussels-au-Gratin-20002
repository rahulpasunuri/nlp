At first, it would be better to carefully wash the mussels, passing them multiple times under running water to remove any dirt and impurities. Before serving, cover with a squirt of lemon juice if you like. http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/campania/mussels-gratin.aspx

excellent recipe! i skipped the onion alltogether which was just fine. slightly simplified the recipie by melting the butter, garlic, shallots, and white wine, added 1 cup chicken stock to increase the liquid (delicious). i also added a little herbes de provence. added the mussels, let them cook for 4-5 minutes. rather than bread crumbs, i used a baguette cut into strips or cubes, baked them in a low oven till hard then tossed them in with the mussels before serving. as good as any mussels i've had in france!
