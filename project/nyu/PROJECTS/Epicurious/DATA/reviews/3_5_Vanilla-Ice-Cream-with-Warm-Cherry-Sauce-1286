This is the dessert that we serve when we need something tasty and don't have much time. It is so easy and everyone comments on how good it tastes. I am taking it to supper club tonight for someone that can't eat wheat.

Delicious! I only made 2 changes: soaking about 1 cup of dried cherries in the kirsch, simmering them till soft...and leaving out the cornstarch. Instead, I reduced the whole thing which takes more time, but I do so hate the taste of cornstarch! This is unbelievable with the ice cream, and it's even better if you slip a nice fudgy brownie into the microwave for a couple of seconds and then proceed...

This is easy but really didn't do a thing for me. Our guests ate it but didn't remark --- guess I'll serve something else next time.

The sauce is not too sweet, which is good given that it's over ice cream. Definitely easy.

Quick, easy & a crowd pleaser. This is a great recipe and beats out another one called Cherry-Vanilla Bean Ice Cream with Cherry Sauce (which takes hours and hours to make...for pretty much the same taste as Vanilla ice cream with warm cherry sauce. I've tried both and find the results are about the same except this recipe is a fraction of the time as the other. Definite keeper.

I have made this 3 or 4 times. I can spend my time on the meal and still have a great dessert.

Excellent dessert and so easy. I made this the day before I served it and it was delicious.
