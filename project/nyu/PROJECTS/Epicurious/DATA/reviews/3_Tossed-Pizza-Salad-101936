This recipe gave me the inspiration I needed to create a chicken salad. The only ingredient that was similar between my creation and this recipe was the pizza crust (though mine was homemade crescent-flat bread). I threw in chicken, artichokes, and fresh mushrooms mixed with a Parmesan peppercorn dressing. If you don't have a recipe for this dressing, search for one with sour cream; it mellows out the mayo flavor. Try it sometime; the recipe was requested.

I so wanted this to taste as good as it read, but alas, it didn't. It smelled great as I was assembling the ingredients, but I think the dressing was the thing that ruined it for me and my guests.

This recipe was pretty good. I really liked it, so did my boyfriend. I used vegetarian pepperoni and soy cheese- a good change to a salad if you are feedign vegetarians.

I kicked this recipe up quite a bit. Using homemade Italian dressing and genoa salami instead of the bottled dressing and pepperoni. Also added sliced red onions and leftover homemade pizza dough for cubes. After which it was 3forks! Yum! I will definately use this as a blueprint for a great salad but it needs modification.

Made this recipe twice in a week...once for friends with 2 young kids & once for older relatives...both loved it (especially the kids). I did make some changes, such as I used cherry tomatoes halved (not so soggy), used onion instead of pepper, & used 1/2 of a package of garden salad mix (arugula is not popular in my house). I marinated the pepperoni, tomatoes, basil, cheese, onion & dressing first, then added the crust, and last the lettuce at serving time. Definitely must eat it all when made...to soggy to save. Great summer salad to use up those tomatoes & onions.

For all the vegetarians who eschew this dish because of the pepperoni-- Don't! There is a veggie pepperoni available in the supermarket now! I have been using it on pizza and anywhere else I can squeeze it in. I also like this with a simple homemade balsamic vinaigrette instead of stinky Italian dressing. Another thing to try is to pass the cubed crust rather than dumping it in. It doesn't get soggy that way. (Personally, I like mine a little moist, but my boyfriend hates soggy.)

It's a pretty decent easy salad, though I use a trick with the pepperoni---lay the slices on several thicknesses of paper towels and nuke on high (watch carefully!) til almost all the fat is rendered out. It makes the pepperoni crispy and tasty. Also, a tomato vinaigrette tastes much better than bottled italianm ditto with croutons rather than the Bobolis.

We're vegetarian, so I substituted olives for the pepperoni. It was a wonderful quick meal for a hot evening, and even though I only accompanied it with breadsticks, it fed two of us with leftovers to spare.

It's okay, nothing special and I probably wouldn't make it again. It is a good idea, but it just doesn't quite work.

Good summer salad when you want something light. Leftovers weren't so great because the pizza bread turned soggy. Otherwise, a good salad.

This recipe taste great and is so easy to prepare. If you love arugula I suggest you give it a try. I slice Boboli bread sticks instead of the pizza crust and I prefer to slice my own pepperoni for more texture and less grease. Everytime I make the recipe for friends, I'm always asked for the recipe.

It's a good dinner for the day the cleaning lady comes. No mess, easy but not exciting.

Totally average, I didn't think it worth even the minimal amount of trouble.

This salad is great, have already made it 3 times in 2 weeks. I used mixed baby salad greens and used an Italian Ceasar dressing, everyone loved it.

Great salad to bring along to a cook out or picnic. The kids and adults all loved it and continued to pick at it all afternoon. I did not have any arugula so I used spinach instead.

The combination of the flavors in this salad is amazing. The whole aura was one of freshness and wholesomeness. We used it as a salad, although I would recommend it as a one dish meal. I wouldn't substitute a thing.
