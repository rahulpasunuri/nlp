This recipe is very flexible always yields great results. I put the custard ingredients into a blender (can use more or all local heavy cream) and toss in whole tomatoes, roasted garlic, even creamed spinach. Have used kale instead of arugula with great results. And, as always Veggie Bacon Rocks!

This is not the right issue for this recipe.My Gourmet December 2008 issue has a Baked Egg Custard with Gruyere and Chives on page 178, recipe by Melissa Roberts.

This was terrific and so easy. I made it exactly to the recipe - did use half arugula and half spinach. Everyone loved it.

This was amazing!! I made it exactly as directed, with the exception of using half gruyere and half sharp white cheddar to cut costs a bit as I made a TRIPLE batch for a large group. It was delicious and received rave reviews!

Such a simple, delicious dish. I didn't change a think in the recipe and it came out so good. This one's a keeper!

This was easy and pretty good...although I used arugula and the flavor didn't come through. Next time I'll use baby spinach.

I really liked this recipe. I made it for some friends for Sunday brunch at home and it is definitely one of the best dishes I have ever served to these people. I made a point to do the recipe as specified with full fat ingredients. Next time I will probably use lower fat dairy components (except the cheese). The flavor balance with the garlic and shallot worked out very well. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it tasted great. It's very easy and the finished product is pretty and perfect for company. It's also very heavy and while I am no fan of lowfat cooking, I did make some changes to it the second time around that added flavor and reduced fat. I subbed the whole milk for 2% milk and the cream for 1/2 and 1/2. I also reduced the cheese by 1/2 and added mushrooms to the dish. You can also sub out the bacon for pancetta because it has a stronger flavor allows you to use a lot less and still have a great bacon essence throughout the dish. Trader JOe's has little pre-cut "croutons" of pancetta in a small package that are perfect for this recipe. If you do add mushrooms, you can just par-saute them in the pan for the same amount of time as the garlic and shallot. They won't be fully cooked when you put them in the dish to bake but that helps them hold their own during the baking process. Excellent either way but definitely a recipe that lends itself to creativity.

I agree with westsidecook 100%. If you change the recipe, fine, but don't rate it. It's not the same recipe.

I will make this. But one thing about this entire site and the reviews; if you take a recipe and change everything, it's not the same recipe, is it? ; )

This was reeeally good. I used Swiss for economic purposes, just can't justify the cost of Gruyere in a dish with other strong flavors, though I'm sure it would be wonderful. I used spinach only because I couldn't find arugula. Think arugula would be better. Kids inhaled it (with spinach!). One thing, we are three big eaters including tweenage and teenage boy and we only got through half of what is 4 servings. Next time will try with 2% milk and half and half to try to save our arteries, but boy was it good with full fat.

I just served it this morning to a group of girlfriends whom I had over for brunch. The dish was a hit with everyone. I did make some changes. I thought the arugula would be too bitter so I went with baby spinsch. I thought it called for way too much garlic for breakfast, so I omitted the garlic but kept the shallot. Lastly, I wanted to add fresh tarragon to the recipe, but my grocery store was out of it, so I opted for fresh chives. I will defintely make this recipe again.

Do not change anything in this recipe. It's great fresh and reheated. Use top quality ingredients and don't substitute for the gruyere. Weigh the bread don't go by the 6 cups. About 2/3 of a normal loaf works.

Pretty good. Used more arugula than called for.

Love love love. I found it easy to make and very tasty.

Gruyere is not the best (but certainly most expensive) option. 2 cups (8 oz.) will run about $9. I'd like to find a better option as most times I'll double a recipe like this for guests. Flavor was okay.

I made this for Christmas brunch and it was delicious! I did double the bacon and added more arugula than called for. I will make this again!

Easy to make, perfect for Christmas morning... my new breakfast staple. I'd suggest doubling the bacon, but otherwise, this was absolutely delicious.

YUM Used it as a substitute for dressing with Holiday Turkey and it was a perfect pairing, much lighter than the usual stuffing. Substituted Havarti and Sicilian Table Cheese because I had it in droves and used arugala. Not just for breakfast!

This recipe owes more than a wink and a nudge to the Basil Breakfast Strata recipe in The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook (1985). I made the original most recently for Christmas brunch this year. Because I have never been able to find the basil torta cheese, I used Boursin, Havarti, and extra pesto this time. I will try this version (much simpler), but I think it will be hard to beat the original. I am not reviewing this (in order not to skew the numbers) but am simply noting the history of the dish.

The kids took pleasure in preparing quick and easy brunch pudding. Perhaps their dirty hands added the essential flavors others found unappetizing. We beorcan forget not negi nor dash daikon. Absolutely more delicious than oven bake frozen meals since all vegetables imported from garden. Gina Marie, we're wrestling how to turn this delight into quiche for office lunches. Is it believable?

I thought this was really great. I made it as written the first time. The second time, I added extra bacon, and doubled the spinach. I also coarsely chopped the spinach before mixing it into the custard mixture. I used ciabatta bread and thought the texture was perfect. Count on close to an hr total cooking time.

Tried this recipe over the weekend. Definitely nothing to write home about. Very bland. I will not make is again.

Urr, waste of cheese and good greens.

Absolutely stunning. I threw in extra bacon (no such thing as too much bacon) and used challah, with crusts cut off, for a soft and eggy interior. I agree that you'll need to leave it in the oven for longer than you thought, but the patches of browned cheese on top are good enough to wait for!

it needed to cook closer to an hour, but it was delicious. after a half hour, just check on it every 10 minutes until a knife comes out clean in the center. a nice, creative change to the usual breakfast casserole.
