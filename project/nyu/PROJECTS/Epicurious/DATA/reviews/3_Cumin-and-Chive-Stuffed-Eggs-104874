I tried this recipe but because I wanted to use my cake decorate to make them look fancy I used "lemon peel" instead of "lemon juice" to make them. The filling came out perfect.

I didn't think they turned out too runny, but I refrigerated them overnight before eating, with I think may have solidified them a lot. But they got a big thumbs up at my house--planning to make them for an upcoming barbeque! (also noted that the leftover filling is excellent on bread/as a sandwich!)

I tried these eggs for Easter and found them to have an odd flavor and the filling was a little runny. Worth a try but not a repeat.
