Delish! Fried the egg to save fat. Used Mrs. Ball's chutney and fresh sliced tomato. No cheese. Everyone loved it!

Delish and 1uick. To save fat, fried egg in shape of bread (broke yolk). Used Mrs. Ball's chutney and sliced fresh tomato; no cheese! Everyone loved it!

Couldn't find tomato chutney. Didn't want to make it, either. Could be better than just regular tomato.

Made this with fresh sliced tomato and applewood smoked bacon - fabulous! Made it again without eggs and instead added fresh buffalo mozzarella - even better!

This was the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had and my guests agreed. I used fresh pico de gallo instead of the tomato chutney and it was superb.

My wife loved it. Simple,took no time. Did not purchase tomato chutney but rather made spicy tomato chutney (on this database). Served with salad.
