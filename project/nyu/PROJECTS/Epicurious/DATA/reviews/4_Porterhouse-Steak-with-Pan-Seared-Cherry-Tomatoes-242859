I make this all the time now one of my favorite ways to cook steak. I use more garlic and I like to add 1 or 2 Serrano chilies that are halved lengthwise to the tomatoes.

This was the first home cooked meal my BF made for me. 4 years later it's still a favorite. The only change we made is to reserve the oil/juices from searing the stake. They mix beautifully with the tomatoes once they burst and let a little juice into the pan.

Very tasty. I made it with filet mignon which took longer to grill, but was still delicious. As far as preparing the steak, of course I peppered it too. In addition, I am also a big fan of balsamic vinegar, so I doused the tomato mixture with a nice splash of balsamic before pouring it on the steak.

This recipe was just ok for me and the kids, but my wife loved it so it get's 3 forks. I ended up using the left over steak and tomatoes for quesadilla's the next day and those came out great!

Absolutely delicious, and perfect for a small outdoor get-together. My husband and I grilled the steaks as opposed to preparing them indoors as the recipe here directs, and got the same amazing result. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Delectable. Made it with rib eyes I salted and peppered two hours in advance. I also seasoned the tomatoes in advance (sliced; I didn't have cherry). The flavors are incredible and the steak comes through beautifully.

Good recipe. One suggestion, however, I would retain oil in pan after searing the steaks. I would also combine the garlic, thyme and tomatoes together at once and season with salt and pepper. This seems to make the preparation more efficient.

This is a recipe that I will make over and over again. The sauce was delicious, and such a quick easy dish to make for dinner.

This was my first time making porterhouse steak. I was very nervous since I spent so much money on the meat and I did not want to ruin it. This recipe was UNBELIEVABLE! I made this for a dinner party a few weeks ago and everyone is still talking about it. I served it with sauteed string beans with shallots and mint and with the Creamy Polenta with Porcini Mushroom Sauce. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Polenta-with-Porcini-Mushroom-Sauce-102838?recipename=Polenta%20with%20Porcini%20Mushroom%20Sauce&saved_to_box=y Looking forward to another opportunity to make this dish. It was a true treat and easy to make.

Delicious. I also used ribeye; salted it several hours in advance (Judith Rodgers influence) but otherwise followed the recipe as is.

This recipe is delicious. And very easy. I couldn't find a porterhouse steak, so I used a ribeye, which worked really well. Using the indicated cooking times, methods and temperatures left it a bit raw at the bone (not a problem for my boyfriend, but maybe for others) so I would recommend making sure that all parts of the steak are the right temperature. The tomatoes, basil and thyme were a delicious combination, and the thyme really lent a wonderful flavor to the dish.

Wowzer! Used fillet mignon, cooked the same exact way to medium rare; OMG, it was perfection. Had fresh rosemary from my garden, instead of thyme, and that flavor worked well too. The fresh cherry tomato sauce mixed with the juice from the meat was to die for. I can't wait to try this with the porterhouse.

So I knew this recipe had potential when a reviewer called it "lust on a plate". They were right! As noted by reviewers, press the salt & pepper into the steak before cooking and serve a salad of shaved fennel, basil, olive oil and fresh squeezed lemon juice. Sprinkle the garlic on the steak before pouring the pan seared tomatoes over it. I added a baked potato but no one cared == the dish was that good! People were wiping the juices out of the platter and their plates.

Aside from the cleanup and smell of fried steak in the house, this recipe is absolutely awesome! I used two NY Strip steaks (it was enough for me, my husband and two little kids), and dug out my cast iron frying pan from the basement. I will absolutely use this recipe again - even just for the tomatoes -- they were worth it by themselves and took very little time. I threw in some room temp bocaccini mozzarella, and my kids snarfed everything down.

Really Excellent. Perfect for when you can't use the grill. Very flavorful!

Excellent. I followed the recipe exactly.

Wow. This was lust on a plate. Juicy, robust, aromatic...just delicious. I saw some reviewers skipped the thyme sprigs--don't do it. It adds a lot. The porterhouse steaks were perfect for this, although they were hugely expensive at the high-end-organic supermarket I bought them from. I served it with polenta and a salad of shaved fennel I tossed with some lemon, olive oil, parmesan reggiano, and basil.

The cherry tomato sauce was brilliant! We will be making it again, and again!

Fantastic, really easy too. I added carrots and in addition to the garlic, some shallot and onion, definitely a win.

This is an outstanding recipe. If you want a break from a great grilled steak, this is the one for you. The flavors all work and it's so easy. My friends were quite impressed with a steak that definitely had a gourmet twist.

My family absolutely loves this recipe, even those who are a little bit ho-hum about steak! When last visiting my daughter and her family, I substituted rosemary for the thyme--she has gorgeous rosemary growing outside her front door! The result was, if possible, even better. I've tried making this in a regular skillet and have found the cast iron creates a better product--so much so that I bought a new cast iron skillet when visiting my son and his family. I buy our steak at our local butcher shop instead of the supermarket, but as long as you can get that 1 /12 in. cut, you're in business. I've found that pressing the salt and course ground pepper into it makes an even better flavor. Simple and stunningly delicious!

So fabulous- the tomatoes really make this dish. I thought if anything it could have perhaps a little creamy sauce. Any ideas?

Wow!!! This is our new favorite steak method this month. My boyfriend and I are huge food aficianodos and were getting a little burnt out with our typical blue cheese crust, demi's, pepper rubs...We found the most amazing farmer grown sweet grape tomatoes, added a few rosemary leaves (because thyme was missing), thai basil, and slivered garlic as suggested. I didnt use as much oil though. After the steaks cooked (ribeye and filet) I topped them off with cool and creamy boursin cheese and then the warm tomato/garlic. Wow! I think we have probably made this 5 times since I found the recipe last month.

We grilled the steaks and I made the sauce separately. At the last minute, I decided to add a fresh jalepeno pepper (shaking out some seeds). Everyone loved it!

This was so simple and delicious. Instead of a whole porterhouse I used strip steaks. I also used cherry tomatoes, thyme and basil from the garden and didn't have to go to the grocery store at all!

Whoooooa. This is good. Made it tonight for the second time. It's easy, and looks just as beautiful on my plate as it does on the cover of Gourmet. I also found it was wise to cut down on the cooking time for the steaks, but otherwise the recipe is perfect. There's a lot of cherry tomato in my life right now, which is a pretty good excuse to make this at least 17 more times before the summer is over.

my boyfriend loved this, but I thought the tomatoes were unnecessary

Exceptional. Truly delicious. We had this on a hot summer night and sat outside with a tremendous bottle of wine and a tremendous Seattle sunset. We used the grill rather than the pan, and reduced the "active time" by half as a result. I also prepared corn and salad, but it was too much food, and this could have stood alone. This may be the quintessential summer dinner. Must haves: freshest basil and tiny, flavorful organic cherry tomatoes. Forget dessert - this is it.

I have made this three times, and I love it. It's easy and delicious! The cherry tomatoes and basil make it taste so summery. I did find that the cooking times were a little long. I usually serve cabernet sauvignon with steak, but the acidity of the tomatoes makes a cab a little tannic. I tried a shiraz, and it worked very well.

I have made this three times now, and it is easy and delicious. It's a great way to highlight in- season basil and cherry tomatoes. I found that the cooking time was a little long, but it depends, of course, on the thickness of the steaks. I usually serve a cabernet sauvignon with steak, but the acidity of the tomatoes calls for a less tannic wine-- maybe a shiraz or a tempranillo.
