Suggest using orange juice concentrate; toast pecans with shredded unsweetened coconut; garnish with edible flowers AND serve in a tall glass bowl Careful don't stir sweet potatoes too much, the recipe will turn into mashed potatoes

What is it about Americans and their need for sugar in everything? I served this to my family and everyone agreed it was much too sweet. Will try it again without the maple syrup and raisins- the natural flavor of the potatoes don't need it. I thought someone's suggestion to roast the potatoes was excellent. I also used an organic variety and kept the skins on.

Outstanding. Fresh and tasty. Omitted parsley and used dried ginger in the dressing. Threw in some dried orange peel in the dressing.

I agree, this is not as good as it sounds. It has everything I love in it but the flavours just don't come together. I also dislike the presentation, it looks gross in the bowl and is off-putting to kids and many adults alike. It's an okay dish but not a replacement for traditional potato salad! Won't make it again.

Not as good as it sounds - I think the sweet potato preparation is critical.

This is a great recipe! I made it for a Labor Day Weekend cookout. The biggest surprise was what a beautiful presentation it is! Serve it in a dark-colored bowl and you'll see what I mean. The flavors work so well together. The only adjustment I made was to use dried cranberries in place of any raisins. You must try this recipe!!

I served this at a party and was asked repeatedly for the recipe by all the husbands. I added a little extra maple syrup, ginger and orange zest. To the salad I added diced green and red apples as well as dried cherries and dried cranberries.

This was delicious. I used 2 1/2 pounds of sweet potatoes and about half of the dressing, a combo of golden raisins and dried cranberries, and only 3 chopped scallions. Per other reviews, I added the zest of 1 orange and the zest of 1/2 lemon to enhance the citrus flavor, more ginger, and less cinnamon. I'll use the leftover dressing on a tossed salad tonight. It would also be good on a rice salad, I think.

Made for Christmas buffet, this was a hit! Boiled the potatoes, made the dressing, and chopped items a day ahead, then just mixed together when I plated it. Used real maple syrup and substituted dried crans for the raisins. Didn't bother toasting the pecans. A keeper!

I only gave it 3 forks because I thought this could use a few extra ingredients. So I added some cayenne pepper to the dressing and substituted apple cider vinegar and powdered ginger. To the salad ingredients I added some red onions for color, cilantro, shredded coconut and celery for more crunch.

Great recipe. I used red potatoes, walnuts, and dried cranberries. Created a nice holiday-inspired dish. Would make again. Only complaint is that is does require quite a few ingredients, but the taste is well worth it.

Okay.. truth squad here. My family hated this recipe. I, on the other hand, LOVED it! I love sweet potatoes and I loved the sweet and tangy dressing. Here is a hint to when you try it: Don't use canned orange juice, use fresh squeezed and add about 1 tablespoon of orange zest, use a bit more fresh lemon juice and also a tablespoon of lemon zest. Olive oil is great, but I think Walnut oil would be a far better choice. Also, cut back on the sweet potatoes to four of them, and add uncooked cubed apples. Try two greet tart apples and maybe two sweet reds. I would leave the peeling on for color. The sherry is key to the flavor and use a good sherry. Don't use the grocery store salty gross sherry, use a good liqour store sherry. And, lightly toast your pecans for that light nuttier flavor. And, I think you will have a sweet potato salad that your family will LOVE, just like I did. I betcha good ol' B.Smith would like my version better too!

My family really liked this salad. I used 3lbs of sweet potatoes and kept the dressing the same:) I will make this again

I've never had a bad remark from anyone I've served this salad to. You do have to use more dressing I find (I add way more OJ-yum!), adding pommegranate seeds for colour/taste, or pommegranate molassas to the dressing adds that certain je ne sais quoi!

I took the advice of the other reviewers and halved the salad portion (leaving the full amount of dressing). It was very good and served a party of 11 nicely as a side- dish. Also used cranraisins and balsamic vinegar.

Just finished making this salad as written. I cut the recipe in half and used a little more than half the full recipe of dressing. I can't wait to serve with my mollasses mustard pork loin tonight!

Really yummy dish, I would add a little orange zest next time and maybe even a bit of spice to balance out all the sweet flavours

we loved this and found it great both warm and cold. I used a mixture of red and orange kumera (NZ sweet potatoes) and roasted them. I also substitued walnuts for the pecans as that's what I had at the time and used craisins instead of raisins (as I hate raisins) and found they worked well. This was so yummy - so far I have only made it for us but can't wait to take it too a BBQ this summer. So good and so easy to make.

Excellent recipe. I also roasted the sweet potatoes, and I substituted dried cherries for the brown raisins. This recipe helped me to win a best brunch contest!

Delicious...I made this just for myself and it lasted all week. Great to take to work and class since there's no mayo. Instead of green onion I use thinly sliced Red Onion. Next time I will add orange zest as another poster suggested.

I also doubled the dressing recipe and used every drop. I used orange juice concentrate and orange zest to enhance the orange flavor. We served it with smoked pork. Yum!

Really good and unusual. but the mistake I made was to serve it as a course in itself. It was a little heavy going, and not exactly most people's idea of a salad. I had it again, this time as a side to grilled duck breast and it was perfect. Some changes I would make next time is to add orange rind and top it with bacon bits. As is, there's no distinctively orange flavour.

just made this salad and thought it was really yummy and fresh - perfect with the ribs i'm serving it with (i didn't feel like a starchy or creamy potato salad - the colours and flavours in this were nice and bright). i'm not a fan of nuts and raisins in salads so i left them out but it was still great without them. really liked the spices in the dressing. like everyone else, i doubled the dressing to potato ratio and it was not over greasy or soggy. also i tossed the hot potatoes in the dressing and spread them out on a sheet pan to cool. i think this helps them absorb the flavours as they cool. will definitely make again this summer.

I have made this salad twice for groups of friends to rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I only made a few modifications - roasting the potatoes, doubling the dressing and letting the flavor develop overnight. It's definitely a winner.

This is a favourite of mine, but I recommend roasting the potatoes, and doubling up the amount of dressing, as well as letting it sit overnight for full flavour.

Took this dish to a BBQ and go rave reviews. Used HALF the sweet potatoe though, when buying the potatoes, 6lbs seemed to be an awful large amount. Used full amount of dressing and used DRIED CRANBERRIES. Enjoy

Delicious! I took the advice of one reviewer and roasted the sweet potatoes (roasting is so quick and easy) and the advice of another and used about half the amount of sweet potato and all the dressing. Quick, easy, and a great way to add color to a plate!

I made this salad on Easter instead of the usual sweet potato dish and it got great reviews. It was a wonderful alternative. I thought the green onions really added the perfect touch to this dish.

I made this recipe to take to a barbeque. Got rave reviews, several requested the recipe. I made the following alterations: oven roasted the sweet potatoes, so much faster and intensifies the flavor (toss with a few tablespoons of olive oil and a little salt and pepper, 15 min @ 425); used balsamic vinegar, subbed craisins for half the rasins and soaked them both in orange juice overnight; also cut down on the green onion and parsely. It is definitely a "keeper".

This is a beautiful salad and, I thought, a fantastic way to use a favorite vegetable that is normally served warm. Perfect for summer in Texas, and something sweet next to some spicy grilled food.

Used less sweet potato and the full amount of dressing because it was clearly to dry otherwise -however, still lacked something. Served to my guests, nobody commented and most of it was left over. Too much trouble (steaming sweet potatoes in batches) to make for just an "okay" dish.

Great recipe - made it for Mother's Day and everyone love it. I will make this again and try it w/ the craisins like a few of the other reviewers did.

I thought this was very good although I did make some substitutions instead of going out to the grocery. Walnuts for pecans, dried cranberries for raisins, half af a yellow onion (minced) for the green onion. And I had no parsley. Next time I'll try it the propper way, but I'm keeping the cranberries! My 13 year old brother also tried it, and for the first time gave a good review of a sweet potato dish.

I love this salad. I always use a little less sweet potato (about 1/2) so it is not as dry and I like the consistency with the other ingredients.

This is a very interesting salad - good not great - I could only suggest it to someone who is really looking for something different. If you decide to make it, I would definitely make it ahead of time and let it sit for at least two hours to allow the dressing to soak it.

Excellent salad. I followed recipe exactly, except that I subbed craisins for golden raisins. YUMMY!

Rating: 3
I had no idea this could come out so good! The textures and flavors were amazing. The dressing was delicious but not overwhelming - the maple did it. I used only golden raisins and not so many onions. I will definitely make this again. I was particularly pleased because I dislike potato salad; I loved this, but think it stand in well for those who have to have a potato salad at a picnic (also since it lasts well unrefrigerated.) P.S. Sweet potatos and yams are not the same thing - this salad is calling for yams, which have the bright orange color which is lovely on a picnic table, and a firmer texture to stand up to dressing and mixing.

This recipe sounded so good but we thought it was pretty bland. I followed the recipe except used dried cranberries instead of dark raisins. I used the balsamic vinegar mentioned as a sub. It didn't have the pizazz that I thought it would. Might try it again with some ajustments but not sure what I should adjust.

The trick is to let this salad stand at room temperature.. It was delicious, but I added 1/4 cup of maple syrup by drizzling over salad. It got raves..

I made this recipe to accompany Epicurious' "grilled chicken moroccan style". The match between the seasonings used in both recipe's seemed to be a natural. The sweet potato salad dressing had a wonderful aroma and I couldn't wait to taste the blend of salad and dressing. I was somewhat disappointed however since I felt that the green onions and parsley overode the subtle blend of spices in the dressing. I will make this recipe again however I will leave out those two ingredients.

Amazing party dish - absolutely delicious. Everyone asked for the recipe. I think the mistake of the other cook was to roast the potatoes. They should be just shy of crisp cooked.

Sorry to start off with a not-so-stellar review, BUT- followed directions except I oven roasted the potato cubes with salt and pepper (they were delicious). Expected a great burst of flavor after the 2 hours of sitting, it just wasn't there. Maybe after a day or 2?? Not as good as it should have been for the amount of time it took.
