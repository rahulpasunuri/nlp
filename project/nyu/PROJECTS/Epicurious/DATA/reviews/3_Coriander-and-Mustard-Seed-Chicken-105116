I think the key here is to use the coriander seeds and not just ground coriander. The reviewer from Sarasota notes the crunch with those seeds. I also will try the brown mustard seeds next time to give a little more zip and will also try the chutney. The first time I used pomegranate jelly. A good dish but not great as written, will try the reviewers' suggestions.

sorry to disagree with the others, but this is my son's favorite. i just add a lot more jam. it is so pretty and tasty. the wine keeps it moist, sometimes i use 1/2 ground coriander and 1/2 whole for more flavor

This dish was disappointing. Was tasty, but not a wow meal. Definitely needed more flavor, perhaps some more of the jelly.

Made exactly as written, but flavour did not live up to expectations. Fortunately, I had lots of cilantro, and that helped cover up the bland taste and added a little character to the dish.

Delicious and easy, with an exotic flavor that tasted like it required more effort than it did. I used skinless chicken breasts, which required a little extra oil to keep them from scorching.

This is such a simple recipe and is very delicious. Its better than chicken dishes from restaurants.

It was easy to make but results were not up to par. Chicken did not have enough flavor for me and sauce came out dry. Try adding chicken stock and maybe more jelly. Looked prettier than it tasted.

Nice. I added some broth to the braising mixture and more coriander, because mine was getting dry. I also used the mango chutney. Good with a gold noodle salad and stir-fried asparagus.

I definitly prefer dark meat of chicken over white meat. Whenever I cook a chicken breast recipe I do not send in reviews on how much better the recipe would have been if I had used dark meat. This recipe is one of the best if not the best dark meat chicken recipes I have ever cooked. I attempted to follow the recipe as written but had no red-current or apple jelly so I used Major Grey's Chutney. I also found the coriander seeds to be a must as they gave a brief burst of cilantro flavor when you bite into them. I have never experienced this when cooking with cilantro seeds before. Perhaps I had not cooked them whole in a sauce previously. I served this with the Arroz Con Fideos that is in the same magazine issue. The combination of both dishes was delightful. By all means you should try this recipe.

Dark meat is nearly always superior to white for a number of reasons, taste and texture foremost. Forget the water and double the wine, simmer the alcohol off and double the cilantro. If you bruise the corriander seed you'll get the right flavor and if you insist on the fruit use eight quartered mission figs instead of the jam. Guess this changes things! Serve it with curried basmati rice and a cucumber yogurt raita on the side.

This just wasn't very interesting. Even from someone who enjoys exotic flavors, the coriander seeds were a little weird. Not worth the trouble.And what is 1 teaspoon of any kind of jam supposed to accomplish?

Easy enough, but a little bland. I'm not sorry to have made it once, but I don't think I'd bother to repeat it. I did use breasts instead of legs, but the sauce still just isn't all it's cracked up to be.

This dish simply didn't have enough taste for the trouble. The idea of using breasts seems better, but there are better recipes than this.

On this post-Memorial Day Tuesday, we wondered what to have; there wasn't enough Potato Salad left and so we had to do something. I happened to get my "New Batch" e-mail and this recipe was there. What a piece of LUCK! Perfecto! We served it with Creole Rice, a Mesculin Salad, and a good Pinot Grigio.

this recipe would be much better if made with chicken breasts, unless of course you like dark meat. I would make it again with chicken breasts it is a quick easy tasty meal...
