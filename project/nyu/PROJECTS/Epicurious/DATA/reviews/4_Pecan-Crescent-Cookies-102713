Classic cookies that come out perfectly every time. I always make a triple batch and time myself when shaping them, trying to improve upon my record of 4.5 minutes per cookie sheet... The extra effort in shaping them will pay off when you serve them as people always comment on their appearance. These freeze excellently but should be dusted with powedred sugar to spruce up their appearance after defrosting. Always a hit, for over ten years now, these have become a staple in my holiday cookie arsenal. A friend refers to them as the "little wicked horns" that she finds irresistable.

What chocolate? Bigfanny, have you misread the recipe?

I follow the recipe exactly, except I find the dough very difficult to work with when it is refrigerated. I totally omit this step and shape the cookies as soon as the dough is made. I've made them every year since I cut this recipe out of the BA magazine in 1999!

Delicious! And, for me, the additional time taken to form crescents was minimal and well-worth the joy the shape brings. I say, go for it - it adds maybe 5 minutes total. Also, I subbed in pastry flour and that really brought it up a notch!

Very good cookie. Making crescents is too time consuming and I thought they might overcook on the ends, so I just sliced the logs into circles and pressed down with a glass. Toast the pecans and dust with powdered sugar (after they are cool, eh?) and skip the chocolate. More interesting than plain shortbread and a nice alternative for those of us who don't like a lot of chocolate. Attractive, tasty and keep well.

These are a favorite amongst family and friends. I make them every holiday and give as gifts. Very delicate and wonderfully tasty. No changes needed to the recipe. I think chocolate dipping bogs down the lightness of the cookies. Keep the dusting of confectioner's sugar and let it be!

This recipe is good, but I jazz it up a little...instead of logs I've been making them into crescents and then dipping the ends in melted semi-sweet chocolate and letting them cool on wax paper. I guess I could sprinkle crushed toasted pecans on the chocolate too to make them really pretty. I've been making these every Christmas for a few years and they are well liked by all!

I thought this was good, but not exceptional. Mine tasted a bit dry and didn't have as much pecan flavor as I wanted.

A simple and delicate cookie with a shortbread feel. Great with a cup of tea. Keep a close eye on this one. It goes from perfect to burnt in a moments time. Don't worry about the cresent shape, just roll into a log, chill, and cut. Its a lot less messy and time consuming.

This is my favorite cookie recipe. Instead of shaping them into crescents, though, I roll the dough in 1T. balls and depress the centers with my thumb or back of a melon baller. Bake as directed and let cool. Dust with powdered sugar. Then, I fill the center with about 1/2t. of the following icing: 2 cups sifted powdered sugar, 1 T.Butter (melted) and enough milk to make a filling consistency. I then use some food coloring to tint the filling. This is a very good cookie!

delicious. Made a few mistakes and they were still great. Didn't toast the pecans and baked at 375 for 10-11 minutes. YUMMY!

These cookies are definately Melt In Your Mouth DELICIOUS!! I plan on making more tomorrow and sending them to my boyfriend in Florida for his birthday. I took my first back to my mothers - Pecan cookies are her favorite, and she RAVED!! Like the other cook, I divide the dough in half and shape them into cresent shaped logs then refridgerate them overnite wrapped in parchament/wax paper. Cutting them the next day is easy and the turnout is DREAMY.

I LOVE THESE! So has everyone else who's tried them. They're also easy to make.

Wow! These cookies were a big hit with my family and friends. I shaped the batter in to several long logs, formed the whole log in to a crescent shape (sort of like looking down a a pipe if you cut it in half lenghtwise), refrigerated them, and then was able to slice them and they were already crescent shaped. Great flavor and enjoyable, especially due to the different shape. Definitely am adding this the recipe file.

These were my partner's favorite cookies of all the ones I baked for the holidays this year. I agree that making the crescents is a pain, but it helps to set them apart from other cookies.

These were absolutely delicious and THE favorite cookie in the batches made for Christmas. While the cold dough was crumbly, the heat from my hands softened it and allowed me to make the crescent shapes without too much trouble. A definite keeper!

I thought these were great. I didn't have any problem making them into crescents, which I'll continue to do because they're a more interesting shape than just slicing.

I should have listened to the other bakers. Rolling into a log before refrigerating, then slicing makes sense to me. My dough was rock-hard and, with arthritis, downright painful to work with. The cookies are good, but not worth the effort for crescents.

Exceptional and delicious! I agree with others that the crescent shaping aspect is dispensible. Instead I rolled into a log to refrigerate (wax paper) and sliced them to bake.

Delicious. I found making crescent shapes too time-consuming, so I rolled the dough into little balls. This worked very well. The cookies needed a little less time in the oven than indicated.

Very nice--I used walnuts instead of pecans (can't get pecans in Japan) and they turned out great. The dough is very, very crumbly, though, and I gave up on making crescent shapes.

You don't need to preheat your oven the night before!

Very easy and turned out perfect in the first round. I don't think it is possible or necessary to roll out a tablespoonful of dough into 3 inch logs. Thin crescents can be too brittle for such a tender cookie. I recommend smaller shapes. Yummy!

easy and melt-in-your-mouth texture! I hated to wait overnight for the dough to be ready to use but well woth the wait! take care when toasting the pecans not to let them get to dark...they will have a bitter taste if you do.

Crescent cookies are a family favorite of ours. On CooksIllustrated.com, the magazine tested several crescent cookies. If you're a fan, you might want to take a look.

very tender, melt-in-your-mouth cookies. dangerously addictive, and so pretty, too! but i found that the powdered sugar made the cookie surface slightly slimy. how do you avoid this? not at all a big problem, though, and overall a truly excellent cookie.

I doubled the recipe, and then I added a little extra brown sugar, about 1/4 cup, and then pressed the whole mixture into the bottom of a greased cookie sheet. Baked it for 20-30 minutes. I was then able to eliminate the powdered sugar, and was able to cut them into bars. Much easier and very, very tasty. Will be using this one often for large party affairs.

Very tender and rich. Delicious. A friend was helping set them on the serving plate with three other types of cookies. She sampled so many, I thought I would run out before the guests arrived. They make an excellent addition to a cookie platter because they are an alternative to chocolate (not everyone likes chocolate) and they have a different shape.
