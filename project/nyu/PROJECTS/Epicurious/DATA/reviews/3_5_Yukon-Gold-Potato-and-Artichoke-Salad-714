I had several problems with this dish. First, it's time-consuming to prepare, even with canned artichokes. Second, it's trying to do too much -- I don't think the flavours blend well, and I suspect it was an unpopular dish at my last party because the guests at the buffet had no idea what it was. Third, the olives stain the potatoes in a most unappetizing way if it sits around at all. To end on a positive note, I'd much prefer the potato salad with green beans and mustard vinaigrette (elsewhere on this site), with the antipasto veggies in another dish entirely.

Loved this salad and so did my family. It is not heavy but light and tasty. I also lessened the oil amount in the dressing and used marinated artichokes to make it easier.

Though modified, this salad provided a great side to an upscale barbecue luncheon - I did reduce the oil to about 1/4 cup, and reduced the red onion by half. I also used marinated artichokes, and omitted the olives and tomatoes (serving picky eaters!); added a sprinkling of salt and pepper to finish. In the future I'd add a kick of cayenne or tabasco for spice, but regardless the flavors are lovely together and provide a welcome change from red bliss and mayo potato salads - AND no cholesterol, since there are no eggs!

I used only 1/2 C oil and less than 1/4 c lemon and that was plenty! Needs salt and lots of pepper or some kind of kick, like cayenne. Texture and flavor are wonderful.

The best potato salad I ever had, even though I used store-bought marinated artichoke hearts. Otherwise, used all the listed ingredients. I can see how this might lend itself to variations in proportion and even the addition of other ingredients. Will definitely do this again.

This was perfect for a hot summer night! I cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup and added about one tablespoon of sherry vinegar. I also used canned artichokes (it was very hot yesterday). It was light and tangy and very delicious! I think that next time i would chop the onion fine and add half the amount called for. Try it!!

The 3/4 cup of oil in the dressing is WAY TOO MUCH! Next time, I'll try a 1/4 cup. Otherwise, a wonderful potato salad.

Guests loved this recipe. I used canned artichoke bottoms, that I carefully trimmed. Also, I added an entire jar of drained capers. Finally, I omitted the tomato. Salad still came out colorful with the red onions. Will make again.

My husband and I loved this recipe! Even working as a team, it was a lot of work making it all in one day. Cooking the potatoes and artichokes the day before will work out much better. Definitely will make again.

Delicious! I also added grated parmesan cheese.

Very good. Great for a spring/summer picnic. Next time I'd cut back to 1/2 cup olive oil in the salad dressing. After tossing it tends to collect at the bottom in an oily soup.
