This soup is good, not great. It could use a little more flavoring and spices, but overall it tastes yummy. I added bamboo shoots, mushrooms, a shredded carrot and julienned red peppers too.

I make this every year after Thanksgiving. If you have good homemade stock, it's delicious. It's so simple and much more interesting than the standard turkey noodle soup.

Delicious and super simple! A nice change of pace in the landscape of turkey leftovers.

Warning bells should go off when every reviewer has a suggestion for modification! This is a bland soup, not flavorful like pho (just got back from Hanoi so can really compare!) - it's not awful but definitely not what you want from the time put in. If you're going to make an Asian soup, try a better recipe.

Wonderful Asian slant to soup. I added a sweet Thai chilli sauce to the ingredients and this added a littl 'zing' to it. I think it needed that little extra something. Next time I'm going to add fresh lemongrass as well.

Some good adjustments for this recipe: When simmering the broth with ginger, I added 1 cinnamon stick, 1 star anise and 5 green peppercorns. Added the fish sauce only when I added the turkey, and threw in some sliced green onion. The cinnamon gave the soup some needed depth of flavor. Served by adding noodles then chicken to the bowl, sprinkling in cilantro, thai basil and mint, adding a few Thai chiles, then finally the broth. Served with limes on the side and some hot sauce on the table. Yum!

I julianned a little carrot and mixed it in for a little more color.

i loved this; as a vietnamese-american, i thought it was very similar to a great bowl of pho. great broth makes these dishes. i will probably also add more spiciness to it next time though.

I think this came out quite well. The broth was VERY tasty. Next time I'll add some more chilis to the mix (it wasn't hot enough for my taste).

I thought this soup was simple and satifying. So the rice noodles don't soak up all the broth, I would add to the bottom of each serving bowl and pour the broth over. This soup was a nice change from traditional turkey noodle soup.

I really enjoyed this. I added the fish sauce at the beginning and loved the subtle flavor. Instead of adding bean sprouts at the end I thinly sliced snap peas and put directly into the soup. It gave it such a wonderful texture. I'd make this again. Quick and easy

Anyone familiar (or not) with Asian cooking should know that fish sauce is only added a minute or two before serving. Cooking it longer than this loses the entire point of the flavour, which is to add a subtle "savoury" accent- it will completely disappear.

Excellent and simple to make.

This recipe is good depending on what you're looking for. You will most likely need to add other ingredients to spruce it up. When I feel like eating soup but don't want to spend much time on it, I will make this dish again.

I agree that this could be a very bland soup, but after reading all the reviews, I did what they suggested and added a few of my own flavorings, and the family loved it! I made it w/ leftover turkey broth that we made from the turkey carcass after Thanksgiving. That made a huge difference, I'm sure. Then I added both fish sauce and soy sauce, and some garlic, too. I put all the condiments on the table (hoisun sauce, cilantro, peppers, limes, bean sprouts) and let everybody decide for themselves what to add. I used reg. linguine noodles as our local market didn't have rice noodles. That wasn't as good. If I did it again, I'd use rice noodles.

I have never rated something that I didn't make BUT I made a soup using these ingredients before I saw the recipe! I made it of course to use up the turkey carcass after Thanksgiving. My version was delicious and a "keeper" at my house. The main thing that I did differently was that I put the ginger in with the carcass while I was making the stock. That added tons of flavor! Plus I used the pan drippings from roasting the turkey. That will take care of the "bland" issue.

It's a good start and you will definitely need to add flavorings to spice it up. I added a couple of tablespoons of hot sauce (Southeast Asian type) and cilantro, and it was tasty. It would probably be really good with lemongrass. Yes, it is bland to start, but you can add whatever you like to it. That's the beauty of this dish.

Good basic soup recipe, but I added waaaay more fish sauce and some soy sauce (could've been because my turkey stock was too blah). Once cooked we treated it like pho with hot sauce, hoisin, and cilantro as well as the lime as condiments.

I too thought this was very bland. The only flavor came from the bites that contained a mint leaf or a slice of chili pepper! I used homemade stock and had high hopes, but alas it's not a keeper.

If comfort food is code for bland, then this is comfort food. I added one sliced pepper to the soup while it was simmering and I still thought it needed more. I ended up adding chili flakes, some lime juice, a pinch of ginger powder, and salt to the finished soup just to bring out some sort of flavor. I won't make this again.

Scrumptious soup recipe. I added small chunks of tofu and bok choy. Comfort food par excellence!

Though I haven't made this exact recipe it is very similar to the one I make. For those who may be wary of trying something new don't be. It is a wonderful comfort food especially on a cold day.
