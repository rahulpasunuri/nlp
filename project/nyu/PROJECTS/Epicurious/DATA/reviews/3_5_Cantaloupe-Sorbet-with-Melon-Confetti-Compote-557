I made this for Easter dinner dessert and it was a hit. Everyone complemented how refreshing it was and the presentation of the melon compote made the dessert look very pretty. It is great if you are looking for something cool and sweet but not too sweet. Plus, it can be made in advance so you do not feel bombarded with too many recipe projects in the kitchen. I could not find Essencia and used another muscat maker instead.

I made this dish in early summer as a contribution to a dinner party. I was nervous about the anise overpowering the fruit but it did not. It was a wonderful visual effect and pleasant complement to the warm summer evening! Very tasty.
