Mortales!!! Estos brownies son justamente lo que buscaba, super moist y suaves. Aunque lo encontre que tenian mucha azucar. Pero definitivamente los mejores!

This is my new favorite brownie recipe! I made them exactly according to the recipe, except added the glaze from the Fudge Walnut brownies (1/2 whipping cream with 3 oz semisweet chocolate) after baking and they were to die for. I agree that this recipe is for those who enjoy dense, fudgey brownies. If you're a fan of cake like brownies, then this one is probably not for you. I served these warm with homemade whipped cream and vanilla ice cream after a mid-winter "picnic" of lobster, cole slaw and potato salad, and they were the perfect finish to an already decadent meal.

I loved how simple these were, but if I did them again I think I would use half unsweetened and half bittersweet or semi-sweet. They were not quite sweet enough for me, although my friends liked them the way they were.

Very simple, very good recipe. Mine came out with a velvety, cake like texture. I accidentally grabbed the salted rather than unsalted butter, but they still came out quite sweet. Can't wait to try again with the right butter!

Very nice brownies. They came out thin and not gooey. A little more like a cake with a strong and rich flavor. The chocolate I used was El Rey.

Oh man, these are fantastic. Be forewarned: some people like cakey brownies and some like slumped, fudgy, damp, flat, melty brownies. If you are in the former camp, look elsewhere. But if you like the latter variety, make this recipe and underbake it slightly, and the world will shine on.

This will be a regular dessert for me. I also used 1 stick of butter and cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and the recipe came out light, chocolaty and delicious! I used Ghiradelli chocolate, which made the difference, I think.

These brownies are hands down the best brownies ever! I use the best chocolate I can get my hands on, and bake them in a round cake pan. They are so moist and wonderful!

Delicious! Mine took about 40 minutes. I microwaved each brownie for about 20 seconds and served it with vanilla bean ice cream.

I know longer need to look for a brownie recipe :) If you don't have unsweetened chocolate on hand, I did dark chocolate bars and reduced the sugar by half. I also reduced the butter by half per another's suggestion and they were still moist and fudgy. Skip all the fat.

This is not your typical brownie recipe. It is a thin, melt-in-your-mouth rendition that at first left me scratching my head. Most brownies are chewy and thick, while these have a delicate texture. I used baker's sugar and next time will try using a really good Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla. So few ingredients...they all need to be good quality. My friends really loved these and said they were the best brownies ever.

These were sort of flat and I didn't think the flavor was anything special at all. I would not bother making them again.

I am wondering what went wrong...It tastes eggy..not enough chocolate...cakey and not fudgy. I made the 1 and half times the orginal could that be the issue?

OH MY GOSH! YUMMMMM! Loved these. Just used cheap Bakers' chocolate and they were wonderful. Great chocolate flavor. Will make again and again.

Fabulous! Will keep as a staple. Easy to make & my husband loved it. Didn't add walnuts but topped with coconut pecan frosting when cooled. Cooked 5 min. longer so it wouldn't be too gooey as well - turned out perfect. Highly recommended.

These are the best brownies ever. I used bittersweet chocolate; maybe that was the reason they were very soft on the inside and were much better the next day. The insides became very fudgy. Also used Plugra butter and no nuts. Everyone loved them.

These brownies are by far the best I have had, and whenever I make them I have to make extra for my choc-a-holic husband if any are to be left for guests!

I fixed this brownie recipe exactly as stated, but was thrilled than some of the other reviewers. I enjoyed them but thought they were good, not great. My husband didn't care for them at all. They were easy to make and I have been to City Cafe in Dallas (which is wonderful) but I don't think I'll make this particular brownie recipe again.

This is the absolute best brownie recipe I have found. I make it at least 3 times/month. I always get requests for this recipe. A real HOME RUN!

Great brownie recipe! I only used about a stick and a fourth of butter - they were really moist, rich, and delicious. This will definently be my staple brownie recipe from now on - easy to adapt, but just delicious as they are!

Rating: 3
Great - with a few changes. I used only 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) of butter, 3 eggs, and 1 cup of sugar. I used 4 oz of unsweetened chocolate and 2 oz of raspberry milk chocolate. The colour was light, and the taste was amazing! A slight raspberry flavour and not sickeningly sweet. Just realized I used a 9x9 square pan ... they turned out great - nice and thick.

The president of the company I work for ate at least three of these brownies at our holiday potluck, and I have just given out this recipe to two collegues. It is the best brownie recipe I have every tried--I won't bother trying any others. If you like fudgey brownies, you will LOVE these.

I make these brownies all the time and I've gotten tons of compliments on them. Last night I was making a batch and used one stick of butter instead of two by accident. The brownies are a bit lighter in color, but otherwise the taste and texture are the same. A lower-fat variation with no sacrifice!

This was a very easy, but very good brownie recipe. I would make this again and again!

Rating: 3
these were very rich, dense, and chocolatey. creamy and smushy, not at all chewy. i think i prefer brownies with a little more lift to them, but they were very good. they might have a bit too much butter, though - i say this not for health reasons, but rather because they seemed to drip with butter.

Ever since moving to Switzerland, my baked goods come out funny. The brownies became a chocolate soufflé and then the top sank and became very hard and crunch. The underneath was the brownie and was very good. Does anyone know why everything I bake here is coming out odd? Even my chocolate chip cookies come out rock hard even when I undercook them! I even imported my chocolate chips.

Incredibly great brownies! Very chocolately, fudgey treats. Gave trays of them as gifts for the holidays and everyone claimed they were the best brownies ever. I added walnuts to the batter as well as sprinkled them on top. I would recommend using really good vanilla and chocolate in this recipe.

I thought that these were very good brownies- my roommates were quite impressed. Since I acquired this recipe as a result of a late night brownie craving, I did have to *adapt* the recipe a little, using chocolate chips and cocoa instead of unsweetened chocolate and cutting down on the sugar (to one cup). I also omitted the nuts since I didn't have any (tehe). It worked out pretty well, for those of you who need brownies right away and don't want to go to the store to get unsweetened chocolate.

I absolutely loved this recipe because in most brownie recipes they don't have enough chocolate but in this one it's just the right amount. I wouldn't chnage anyhting to the recipe, because my family loved it.

Cambié las avellanas por nueces. Agregué una cucharadita de polvo de hornear y quedaron más ligeros, riquísimos.

Mmmm...very dense and fudgy! I made these for my staff, and several people commented on how much better these are than 'boxed' brownies (mixes). They do melt in your mouth. I might consider a light glaze over the top next time, just to add a little something extra. Very delicious.

Rating: 4
Superb taste! Very rich, fun to make. A nice change from the boxed brownies! Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream goes great with it.

Yummy, but I wouldn't recommend this to someone who likes chewy brownies. This is more like a flourless chocolate cake than a brownie. In fact, next time I plan to bake it in two cake pans, freeze one, and serve the other with raspberry sauce.

These brownies are absolutely wonderful, and they aren't difficult to make, either. I actually had someone who didn't think he liked brownies say that he loved these.

These are absolutely delicious and I've made them a number of times. Have taken them to work and the guys who I work for said that I could sell them for alot. Love them because they don't have any icing and you can eat them as is or add whatever. These are my favorite brownies.
