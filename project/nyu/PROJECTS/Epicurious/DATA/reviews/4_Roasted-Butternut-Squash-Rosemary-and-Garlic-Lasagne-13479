I carmelized onions then added chopped swiss chard and a 1/4 cup of white wine to onion pan and cooked mixture further. Then added roasted squash. I didn't have lasagna noodles so cooked penne al dente. Tossed onion, chard, squash mixture with penne then covered with thickened rosemary milk, parmesan cheese and baked. Delicious and was able to skip the steps of layering the lasagna. Will definitely make again.

this recipe is redonk!. everyone will go crazy for it! I do cheat and I buy precut, Trader Joe's butternut squash....saves time. Perfect for parties or special occasions, it is rich. Don't skimp on the salt. I use fresh rosemary and just add a half sprig. It's perfection.

I have made this recipe many times since it was first published in the magazine. It always gets rave reviews from my guests. I don't think the prep is so bad, I buy the cut up squash in the supermarket and I always have the parmesan in my fridge. I leave it chunky just as the recipe prescribes. I often make the the sauce the day before and then assemble the lasagna when I am preparing the meal. Today I served this dish for for lunch guests along with homemade focacia bread and salad with carmelized onions, poached pear slices and chestnuts. And Chardonnay of course. Great meal!

Very good, love the rosemary influence and the buttery texture. But while I do love it, I won't be making it again for one striking reason, serious flatulence, not the best dinner for the boss.

Herbal infused cream sauce just spells comfort food to me. Infused the milk with fresh Rosemary for an hour on simmer. Cutting into 1-in dice & carmelizing the squash does make a difference. Made one with lasagna noodles and added ground pork. Did another without noodles, poured sauce over meatballs (1/2 lb ground pork, 1/2 lb sausage & 1/2c. pumpkin) and baked. Especially appreciate the cream & Parm atop. Makes for true golden brown topping. Very nice harvest dish!

I have read several recipes involving butternut squash that have reviewer complaints about "watery" results...your squash was too ripe! Overripe squash will be watery and also off-flavor.

Rating: 4
Amazing! Tastes so decadent, but the squash, and lack of meat, makes it less sinful, IMHO. As others have noted, there is a lot of prep work involved. If you're going to make this for a dinner party or special evening where you don't want to be stuck at the stove, I suggest cutting up the squash and garlic, grating the parm, and making the cream sauce the day before. My family loved this!

Rating: 4
This is really good just as is. A real treat. Be sure to follow the suggestion of an earlier comment and let the squash start to carelize a little bit. The little golden cubes of squash are beautiful in the finished dish. I think this is meant to be a side dish to be served with roast chicken, etc. I will definitely make this again!

Rating: 1
I really disliked this dish. I felt like the flavors were one-note, and there was no contrast. I also followed the suggestions to mash the squash instead of leave it cubed, which resulted in a textureless, gloppy-looking filling. I ate one serving and threw the rest away.

Loved the flavors in this dish.. but I think I did something wrong, it was very watery and the lasagne did not stay together. still delicious

As this recipe is written it is a three-star recipe. The taste is good but the prep work is brutal. The second time I made the recipe I made a few modifications that to me, made the recipe much better and worth 4 stars. 1) I cut the butternut squash in half and roasted it in the oven with the skin on. Then after it was done (about 50 minutes) I was able to scoop out the flesh and add it to the sauce. This cuts down the prep time dramatically. 2) I grated fresh nutmeg over the top of the completed lasagna. This really added a lot of complexity to the flavors.

Delicious!! Me and the wife loved it and we are big meat eaters. Didn't even miss the meat in this dish. It is a TON of prep though. I did add a layer of carmelized onions and a layer of ricotta per other reviews. Will definitely make again (when I have alot of spare time)

I made this recipe as written and the results were delicious. I will, however, make some changes for next time: reduce the butter by at least a quarter and use sauce on the top layer with only a touch of the cream.

Made the recipe exactly how it was written and really enjoyed it. Will likely make a few changes next time: Add chicken, onion and mushroom; Remove the layer of cream as it did not provide the necessary moisture to prevent the top layer of pasta from drying out and getting crispy. Will definitely make again though as the flavors were so delicious!

I love this recipe. I usually omit the cream topping and use the sauce instead (increase the amount slightly). It saves a step and I actually prefer it this way.

I only had one smaller butternut squash, 1 1/2 lbs so I halved the recipe. It was a pain to peel & dice the squash but it came out SO GOOD. I did use 9 noodles - different size no-cook ones, to use up ones I had. I didn't whip the cream but poured it on top (I had mistakenly put last 1/2 parmesan cheese on last layer, so none on top). Well, the top noodles were crunchy (and I didn't have enough) but otherwise it was FANTASTIC and even my picky son liked it. I will make this again for sure, maybe following directions exactly next time.

This is one my favorite vegetarian entrees, and I've made it many, many times. I find it easiest to peel the squash with a vegetable peeler, cut into large chunks and steam until soft, then I puree in my food processor. So much easier than trying to dice the squash, and the squash sauce comes out velvety smooth. I rarely use the cream topping - I end with the sauce and top with a sprinkling of the parmesan cheese. I like to serve with a butter lettuce salad with sliced Fuyu persimmons and toasted walnuts in the Fall. So pretty!

I made a version based closely on the recipe and the other reviewers suggestions and it was certainly good, but not quite spectacular. Changes/Adaptations: I used whole wheat lasagna noodles; a layer of ricotta mixed with parmesean, fresh basil,fresh rosemary, garlic and 3 eggs; a layer of seriously caramelized red onions; a layer of roasted yellow and green squash cut into slices; a layer of mashed butternut squash with nutmeg, brown sugar, and sea salt; one layer of toasted pine nuts for crunch; topped with a mixture of half/half greek yogurt and ricotta (my substitute for the cream sauce). The must have additions, in my opinion, are the toasted nuts and the caramelized onions. I agree with everyone else that mashing the squash is a much better way to go than using chunks. I forgot to cover the dish with foil while baking and the top got a little too brown, so unless you like a crunchy top, don't skip the foil.

Rating: 3
The top layer of noodles did not cook very well because the sauce/cream ran down through the lasagna, but there was something oddly compelling about those chewy noodle bites. Next time I would mash the squash instead of leaving it chunky, because I think the texture would be better. The rosemary and garlic and cream were all delish together. I also added caramelized onions as suggested by others.

I married into a huge family of vegetarians - though my husband is not, when the family comes to town I'm always looking for something fabulous to serve them. This one was awesome. It was unique, yet familiar, easy to prepare (okay i purchased frozen precut squash and prepared the sauce the day before). I did follow other reviewers' advice and added carmelized onions, a pinch of sugar a pinch of nutmeg, eliminated the cream and instead dotted the top with sliced ovals of mozzarella balls. served with a nice bottle of viogner.

We love this recipe, and it has become our traditional Christmas Eve dinner. It's creamy and comforting, yet very flavorful. We actually make it according to the recipe! (I do get confused when reading reviews and ratings for recipes to which the reviewers have made so many modifications that it seems like they're reviewing a different recipe!)

This was a big hit. I did not use the cream topping but added instead a layer of ricotta cheese mixed with garlic, parsley, parm cheese and some wilted spinach i had left over and layered that on top of the last layer of noodles. I then put some fresh mozzarella cheese on top. I also took the advice of others and added the layer of carmelized onions. To me this made the dish. I aso just threw a big sprig of fresh rosemary to the milk instead of dried, i think this adds a better flavor. I did think it was a bit dry, I might not use as much squash next time.

This was good but very rich. You need to serve it with a strong green vegetable. I recommend kale or broccoli. Its delicious but probably better as a side dish.

Rating: 4
This was superb! Creamy and sweet and savory... In reading the reviews, I decided to make a couple of additions: I roasted bone-in, skin on chicken breast and shredded the meat, adding it to the sauce once completed. I also started the sauce by sauteeing about 8 oz of cremini mushrooms in the butter, and only added the garlic once the mushrooms were cooked through. I also omitted the whipped cream on the top, which I felt would have been overkill. My better half, who doesn't like creamy sauces, LOVED this lasagna and asked me when I can make it again. I think that a pinch of fresh nutmeg in the sauce might add depth of flavor, and a layer of baby spinach would add some nice color. This one is going right to the front of my recipe box!

Rating: 4
When I first started making this years ago I thought it was great but now after my "salsa and jalapeno" period, it seems a bit bland. I found a layer of pesto before baking (not on top) or a layer after baking adds the needed umphh. Of course, maybe a layer of salsa and jalapeno might be good.

Made this recipe with two small changes - added back in some of the strained rosemary for flavor and sprinkled brown sugar on the squash after roasting as it was not as sweet and flavorful as we like. It was delicious and I will be making another for the weekend. This makes a wonderful dinner with a green salad, or could be a great first course. This will be a regular entry in our dinner rotation, especially in the winter...excellent, hearty apres-ski meal.

Delicious. Incorporated many of the previous suggestions: used fresh rosemary, added a layer of caramelized onions and kale, and left off the cream top. We instead saved a little sauce for the top and finished with the parm. We also substituted the no boil lasagne pasta for some fresh pasta sheets we bought at the store. Highly recommend!

Rating: 3
Was a veggie alternative to a Turducken party. Following other reviewers' suggestions I completely abandoned the cream topping. I added an onion/crimini (about a lb each) saute to add another layer. 1 1/2 Tbls garlic. For added color, blended only half my squash with the sauce, using the other half as another, brighter layer. Very pretty dish. Will use 1 Tbls rosemary next time.

I'm perplexed as to why I would dislike such a highly rated recipe. As one other reviewer said, this was a first for me on epicurious. While the rosemary bechamel was delicious I found the overall dish much too stodgy and ended up throwing out all but two portions. I may play with the recipe to see if I can improve it, but will definitely not be making it as written again.

This was a fabulously tasty recipe, one of the nicest lasagne recipes I have come across. I left out the cream topping, it was very rich anyway and the cream on top would have been just too much, and I used a lot less parmesan and still the dish was rich and flavourful and quick and easy to make too.

ate this for the first time years ago at a friend's party - had to have the recipe. Lost it, unfortunately, but this is it! I think her recipe was from Cooking Lite and used a lot less butter, if I remember correctly. So I used 1/2 the butter and it turned out great. Time saving tips - this recipe doubles well, so I always double it, freezing one uncooked without whipped cream. Also, use 6" fresh sprigs of rosemary instead of crumbled dry and simmer as the squash goes in the oven. The extra time in the hot milk intensifies the flavor and all you have to do is toss the sprigs out when you are ready, plus if the milk is hot the bechamel sauce is so much faster.

I would give this 3.5 forks if that were an option; the taste is very good, and the concept unique, but it did take 2 hours to make, including a lot of prep work. As other reviewers had suggested, I doubled the garlic. I also used fresh rosemary instead of dried, and doubled this too. I cut the squash into 4 pieces, and roasted this way. I then scooped out the insides into the sauce. As this looked less than appealing, I decided to blend the sauce. I am really glad I did this. Even though the lasagna was completely orange, I thought that the texture of the sauce was perfect. My husband raved about the dish, and said it was amazing. I would make this again, but on a weekend when I have more time to spare.

This recipe took a long time to make, every bit of 2 hours. However it turned out really good and I would make it again. I added some extras to it to make it more of a meal. I added ricotta cheese, sauteed mushrooms and spinach to the layers and I add a shallot to the sauce for more depth of flavor. I also used a bound bundle of fresh rosemary instead of dried and that saved me the step of straining it.

I made this without the cream topping because I wanted something reasonably healthy after all the holiday excesses. It was merely okay - kind of dry. The much better recipe on this site is the Butternut Squash and Mushroom Lasagna. But it's not as healthy...

Rating: 4
A delicious vegetarian lasagna. As written, I think it is better as a side dish. The flavors, while good, are not varied enough to use as a vegetarian main course. If you are vegetarian, as my family is, I agree with the other cooks - add sauteed fresh mushrooms and slightly wilted baby spinach into every layer.

Rating: 4
Wonderful. I used a couple 6" springs of fresh rosemary in the milk, doubled the garlic, and used 3 oz goat cheese + 4 oz mozzerella in place of the parmesan. The lasagne noodles on top got a bit crunchy during the time they were cooking uncovered, but surprisingly they were just fine that way (though I will be aware of this for next time). I served it with the orange, jicama and watercress salad on this site to counterbalance the richness, and they worked great together. A hit for my family's holiday party.

I really enjoyed this and so did my 7 yr old daughter. It had the texture of velvet. I didn't prepare the squash as the recipe suggests - it's way too much work as written. Instead I simply cut the whole squash into two halves (keep the peel on) and placed cut side down in a roasting pan with a little water. I roasted it at 400 for 45 minutes to an hour, then cooled the squash and scooped it out. The squash mixed into the sauce very easily and it tasted very good. This is a far simpler preparation. I skipped the whip cream step - that seemed unnecessary. Just saved some of the regular sauce and put that on the top layer. I also used skim milk for the sauce and it was just fine. One person suggested adding spinach. I think I'd do that next time and perhaps some sauteed mushrooms as well.

Rating: 3
Tasted great, but did anyone else have the color come out kind of weird? Only real change I made was adding some chopped walnuts to the sauce. The lasagne noodles below the top layer came out with a grey-ish, distinctly unappetizing tint. I used Barilla no-boil noodles. I might try it again if someone can assure me that the walnuts tinted the noodles.

A good friend of mine made this recipe for a baby shower and it was a huge hit. So much so that we all have been making it at home now. Peeling the chopping the butternut squash is a bit tedious but after that is done the recipe is pretty simple and easy. A nice recipe to make for company.

This is a great fall dish. I made it basically as written, with a couple of changes. I didn't use the whipped cream topping as it seemed a little much and wasn't necessary. I added a some blanched spinach for some great color and a little more veg. Though it was really tasty, I thought it was a little bland as is. To "take it up a notch" when eating the leftovers, I made a balsamic reduction and drizzled it over. That really brought it to another level and was a great balance.

Rating: 0
Peeling squash is always laborious, so I substitued it with sweet potato then put in 3 springs of rosemary and doubled the garlic as other reviewers suggested. I find alfredo type sauce rather bland in general, and I thought that the sweet potato gave this recipe a little lift - and it was a huge time saver. Everyone really enjoyed this cozy dish, and my mother-in-law took some leftovers home for lunch. That said, if I had to peel the squash - I don't think I would have done this recipe twice.

I made this last week, and it was delicious. Instead of boiling and then straining the milk with rosemary, I just ground it up in a mortar & pestle and kept all the rosemary in. I used skim milk for the roux, and probably only about half as much parmesan as it called for, but I definitely added more garlic. Instead of the cream topping, I pureed a pkg of silken tofu, and mixed in a few tablespoons of whole milk, garlic, and parmesan cheese, which still made for a nice creamy topping. I also made and assembled it all the day before, and then just popped it in the oven the next day.

I made this last night as I had a lot of butternut squash to use up. The result was fantastic. My husband loved it and so did I. I wish I had read the reviews first as I would have used fresh rosemary and roasted the garlic as others mentioned. I also would have skipped the whipped cream as I felt the calories were too high. For those that don't use the whipped cream - what do you use instead to keep the noodles moist? I really liked the flavours of this recipe and will definitely make it again.

perhaps it's something I did incorrectly, however this did not taste as good as I thot it would given the rave reviews.... please help... the squash was not that good. I baked it quite a bit longer than stated and it was still not as tender as I thot it shud have been. I used the cream topping, however it still left the top noodles dry... not much flavor--- if there are any suggestions, please advise... though I used more rosemary and garlic than required, it still didn't do it for me. Also, the squash wasn't that sweet and very firm.

I've made this recipe twice now and it's great. Both times I've used leftover vegetables rather than strictly squash and roasted some extra garlic. The first time I didn't have any cream since I was just using leftovers, so I left off the top sauce which was fine, but this time I made it with the cream sauce and it's even better! I also added some Ricotta to the cream mixture before putting it together.

I've made this twice and am now making it for a Christmas dinner side dish (and also as a main course for the vegetarians coming for dinner). I pretty much do what everyone else does (double rosemary, garlic, etc.) but I do not do the whipped cream on top. I just pour about a 1/2 cup of half and half over the top, then cover with foil. Delicious - and the smell of the parm when it comes out of the oven is worth making it alone! Btw, someone asked earlier if it could be frozen ahead of time...the answer is YES, and it's just as delicious. Just bake as directed, freeze, and reheat in a 350-degree oven until bubbly.

Excellent--but be prepared for it to be very rich. Doubled rosemary and garlic as others did. It was a nice to indulge, but I can't imagine eating it more than once a year b/c its richness. Think about paring it with a light salad with a simple, fresh dressing. This meal stands alone and doesn't need a lot of extras.

Just made this for a Thanksgiving sidedish. I just loved it, but with everything else on the table it got a little lost. I've been happily eating it warmed up for breakfast! The butternut is so sweet. As advised, I upped the amount of rosemary in the milk mix, and upped the garlic too. I think we could use twice as much squash and half as much caloric milk/rue mixture for a more intense squash flavor. Use REAL parm cheese for the best flavor. This was a terrific recipe that I'll repeat again for sure!

This was an awesome dish. I read all the comments and did what felt right. I used the pre-cubed fresh stuff - from the produce isle here. Added some nutmeg to the squash while roasting. Added a few garlic cloves to the roasting squash as a nice little surpise. And also added a layer of prociutto to the lasagne. Either before or after the cheese. I still think the dish would have been just fine without the adjustments but after all the reading and my own thoughts, these felt right. Really great meal. It turned out great. Oh... and I served this with some roasted brussell sprouts. Nice!

I served this as a side dish with smoked pork chops, and it was "pfg." I did make some changes. I used Trader Joe's pre-cubed butternut squash, which made prep quite easy. I used low-fat milk, but would use skim next time. The dish is quite rich, so the change would cut calories without being noticed. I used whole wheat all-purpose flour, and I used no-boil *rice* lasagne. I did not top the dish with the whipped cream, and really don't feel this step was necessary. This one's a keeper, for sure!

After reading the other reviews I made this pretty much as written, except I increased it by half to better fill a 9x13-inch pan. I used fresh rosemary. I found that 3 pounds of squash (or in my case, 4 1/2 pounds) did not yield the advertised number of cups; I was glad I had bought extra. I love rich food, but because I had 2% milk on hand I used mostly that, with a little whole milk thrown in, and believe me, the recipe did not suffer. After you make the sauce, where it says to salt and pepper to taste, remember that you are going to be adding a lot of salty Parmesan cheese and also a good deal of salt to the cream, so my advice is NOT to add more. You don't want to beat down the sweetness of the squash. It took a lot of time for my milk mixture to get thick; you really have to bring it to a simmer to get it there. After the final 10-minute bake, the cream around the middle was still quite liquid, so I baked longer. Had I not done that, it's possible the cream would have soaked into the rest of the dish anyway, but I didn't want to take the chance of liquid lasagna. Yes, this dish is a lot of work, and next time I will try to find the frozen squash that a few people wrote about. It wasn't available in my store, however.

I have made this many times, since the first time the recipe came out in the 90s. People raved and are still asking for it years later. Even my children love it. I serve it as a side dish as opposed to a main course. While I'm a little iffy about no-boil pasta, it is so much easier that I usually cave and use it - as a previous reviewer said, just make sure you have plenty of sauce/whipped cream to soften the pasta sufficiently and it will be fine. I have made the sauce/squash and combined them a couple of days ahead with no problem, and have also assembled the lasagne a day ahead with fine results. You will not be sorry you made thi dish!

Both hubby and I thought this was very good. I made a few changes after reading other reviews: I roasted a few heads of garlic (peeled and roughly chopped) with the squash, and I used fresh rosemary and did not strain it. I did use the Barilla no-boil noodles that one reviewer said were good, and I found that they worked just fine. I will make this again, I think, but next time I will add sauteed sliced mushrooms -- I felt like the lasagna needed another flavor in there, at least for a main course, which was how I served it. Otherwise, definitely a good dish.

What a fabulously rich lasagna! Wrestling with the butternut squash was the only painful part of the recipe (I have the blisters to prove it!). I followed the recipe as printed but -- I bought 5 lbs of butternut to account for the peel and seeds being thrown away, I used fresh rosemary rather than dried and I parboiled and dried regular lasagna noodles. Roasting the squash in small batches is time consuming but necessary -- and trying not to eat the squash before assembling the lasagna is nearly impossible! Yum. Great recipe!!

After reading the reviews of this recipe, I left out the whipped cream topping, roasted the garlic with the squash, used 2% milk, did not strain out the rosemary, and added mushrooms to the sauce. This dish was very rich -- my family and I enjoyed it and I am glad that I tried it. However, it was a bit too much work for the result and I probably won't make it again.

Rating: 4
I have lots to say about this wonderful recipe. I read most of the reviews before making this, so I made a couple of changes. One, I used three decent sized butternut squashes, halved them and roasted them with two small heads of garlic. This was about 5 lbs of squash, which one reader noted prior was necessary. It was more than I needed, but wait to you hear what I did with left overs. Even though I had a lot of squash, I did not change the liquid so my sauce was quite thick. For the liquid, I simmered three rosemary sprigs and just removed them when ready to add squash and garlic. I made this as a side dish for a small dinner party so I made two 11 X 7 casseroles and froze one (did not bake first). I used the Barilla no-bake pasta, my first time, and it turned out great. I did use the whipped cream and thought it was essential, but probably because I was worried how thick the sauce was. I used a healthy pinch of cayenne pepper in the sauce too. I used grated parmesan between the layers and shredded parmesan on top of the cream layer. Baked as directed. Fantastic and everyone asked for the recipe. Before reporting to you, I baked the frozen casserole too--thawed in fridge overnight, then added the whipped cream and last layer of cheese before baking. It was as perfect as the first one. The leftovers are good for me, but fresh baked is best for company. Finally, I had about four cups of thick squash 'sauce' leftover. I used that to make the winter squash soup with gruyere croutons, also on this site, again to RAVE reviews. I simply simmered the squash with chicken stock, added another pinch of cayenne (I like heat) and when hot, pureed with my hand blender. I did not add anymore cream because of the sauce base. Couldn't have been easier, or faster. So, this is an excellent dish and can be made ahead and frozen. Do try it, you won't regret it!

The flavor was incredible. Made it for a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe! My neighbor even called the next day to see if she could come over for leftovers! I added a little nutmeg which made it that much more yummy but I would have to agree with other reviewers that the no boil pasta is funky and would go the old fashioned route next time. Even my finicky teenager (are there vegetables in it?) loved it!

I had this at a party and loved it so much I begged for the recipe. I made it myself with two differences: I have had such bad luck with no-boil lasagna noodles that I used regular ones and boiled them before baking; and I did not cut up the squash into pieces before roasting but just halved and seeded them, then roasted, cut side down, on a baking sheet for 45 minutes at 375. It was a lot quicker and easier to scoop out the roasted flesh afterward and tasted great. The only thing I found is that if you use already-cooked pasta, you should cut back on the amount of cream used by a third to half, because it was a little bit runny with the full cup of cream, but still FABULOUSLY DELICIOUS. It was even a hit with my finicky husband who doesn't like cream or bechamel. Also, it was surprisingly easy to make, in spite of the lengthy-looking recipe. This one is a keeper!

I have made this recipe "as is" at least 10 times and it always gets raves. I recently tasted a similar version with Italian sausage and thought adding sausage might move this dish from a first course to a main dish. I'm going to try it and serve with a simple salad at our next casual dinner party.

This dish was very rich ... too rich. Not sure what everyone else was raving about. It was OK, not great. If I was going to make it again, I'd probably add more butternut squash adding more substance to the sauce. It did smell good, but was just too much, too creamy.

Rating: 3
Used fresh rosemary and skim milk and it was an elegant blend of simple flavours. Next time I will skip the whipping cream as I don't think it added anything. Perfect for my picky eaters who collectively don't like tomato, vinegar or lemon or lime, vegetarian, nuts and fish. Excellent for a buffet. Will also try to make ahead and freeze in small portions.

I had this dish at a dinner party and cant wait to try it on my own. It was fabulous and very unique tasting. It was great beause baked or unbaked it could "sit" for a while until the cook was ready for it

WOW...That's about all I can say! This recipe was THE BOMB! It was SO tasty! I was a little nervous to prepare it because I've never made butternut squash, but everything about this recipe was wonderful. Fairly simple to prepare, too! Definite keeper of a recipe! Thank you Epicurious!!

In answer to amezella's question (probably not in time!), yes, I have made the sauce ahead of time and there is absolutely no flavor lost. The only thing that will be different is the consistency, the sauce will thicken up considerably after refrigerating thus making it a bit difficult to spread. I pop my sauce in the microwave for a couple of minutes, you don't want to cook it, just warm it enough so that it is spreadable. Also, I made and rated this recipe a few years ago, so those making this for the first time and reading the reviews, I think the cream at the end (on the top) is completely unnecessary and just makes a mess of the lasagna, I skip it all together and do not miss it. This gets rave reviews.

I followed this recipe very closely (the rosemary bechamel, the whipped cream top) except for one key departure. Instead of using butternut squash, I used summer squash and fennel, both of which i sliced thin and roasted in the oven at 450 before using in the lasagne. It was delish.

Has anyone made the sauce ahead of time, as the recipe says is possible. I'm thinking about doing this to bring to a potluck right after work, but I'm nervous something will be lost if the sauce sits over night. Thanks for your advice!

This was great! Used sprigs of fresh rosemary, doubled the garlic, and added nutmeg, which I usually do when making a butternut squash recipe. Also, put parmesan and a little grated four-cheese mix between each layer. The perfect "company" dinner, and it's meatless, which I love.

This lasagne is delicious with minor tweaking, a bit bland as written. The second time: Per other suggestions, I doubled (or slightly more) the garlic, used fresh rosemary, (and left some in after straining), added a dash of cayenne. I also added a little mozzarella, as I like cheese in my lasagne. Vegetarians and non raved. Also, froze left overs, and added a bit more cream on top to moisten, and baked. Great! I think it could be made in advance and frozen, has anyone tried it?

Fabulous! I got rave reviews from all my dinner guests. My only changes were that I roasted the squash with garlic, I used fresh rosemary (about 6 good sized sprigs and I used two cups of whipping cream for the topping. It was really spectacular!

I loved this recipe so much I've made it about 3 or 4 times. I even took it to my bosses house for our x-mas party -- and she's Italian! With that said, i'd like to know if it can be frozen. My bosses dad died and I want to give it to her to use when she returns from Italy.

made this tonight, and my boyfriend & I ate half the dish! it was really that good... like others, i skipped the "topping" and used a mozz/parm mixture which turned out fine... also roasted some garlic with the squash which really added to the flavor. used 2% milk which worked well and added 1/4 of white wine when making the roux... we gave it our highest rating and will make again for sure!

I have made this dish several times, and offer the following tips: I usually use more than the amount of cream called for as a final layer. It's really important to cover the last layer of pasta sheets with cream (otherwise they will be chewy) and I found that the amount called for in the recipe was not enough. I usually double the amount called for, although I admittedly don't use quite that much -- just enough to ensure that the top layer of pasta is generously coated. Second, I have had mixed results with "no-boil" pasta (probably due, in part, to the fact that I had not completely covered the top layer with cream). However, I recently discovered that Barilla makes a no-boil lasagne that seems to be superior to the rest, and I recommend it. Finally, unlike some other lasagne recipes I've tried using no-boil lasagne (like the roasted eggplant lasagne with parsley pesto -- outrageous), this one is not better if you cook it through once, and then re-heat it when you are ready to eat it. It's better, both in taste and preparation, when it's fresh -- the first time around. For this reason, if you are making this dish for company, it's best to assemble it just before your guests arrive (it will hold for an hour or so fully assembled and unbaked) and put it in the oven shortly after your guests arrive.

Delicious variation to traditional 'meat-red sauce' lasagna. This recipe makes a delicious vegetable side-dish and has been enjoyed by both children and adults.

I had never heard of no boil pasta so after searching it out I have to say its AWFUL! ALthough this receipe was otherwise really good, the pasta made it almost not worth eating. I would highly recommend using normal pasta.

This was excellent. I recently served it at a party, doubling the recipe, and didn't have any leftovers. It is really savory and delicious. I used fresh sprigs of rosemary to infuse in the milk, and that way didn't need to pour anything through a strainer. Peeling and chopping the squash is time-consuming. This is not a weeknight meal, but the results are worth the effort. (I looked at Trader Joe's for the frozen squash, and was told that they no longer carry it.) It's a bit of an effort, but absolutely worth it. Several guests asked for the recipe. I will make it again.

Rating: 3
A couple things...I completely agree with the reviewer who insisted that substitutions such as tomato sauce and yellow squash are in no way representative of the intent of this dish. This is a subtle flavored dish that requires the natural sweetness of the butternut squash paired with the herbs and the creaminess of the béchamel sauce. Having said that, there is one change that I think can be made without spoiling the recipe for those more "fat conscious" folks out there. I used 5 cups of skim milk with a little bit more roux and skipped the cream altogether. Also, I have made this where I roasted the squash whole until dark brown on the outside. Then I allowed it to cool and cut it up for the recipe. It worked great, saved a lot of hard chopping and made for an even more intense, concentrated squash flavor.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe and it is very popular with my friends. It is on the bland side, but in that rich creamy comfort food sort of way. I go pretty low fat (only ¼ stick butter, and I do not use the whipped cream as the topping but add some skim milk at the top instead) but it is still very rich and creamy. When I add the 4 cups milk to the roux, my sauce never really thickens but it turns out to be fine anyway. I use fresh rosemary because I have it. Last time I tried about 3/4 Tbsp of fresh, but I think it needed more than that because you could hardly taste the rosemary. I will try 1½ - 2 Tbsp next time. I used much more than 1 Tbsp garlic. Next time I might add some crushed red pepper flakes to add a little kick.

I liked this recipe alot, and I made it AS-IS! My mom used to make me so mad when she'd admonish me to MAKE THE RECIPE EXACTLY AS IT'S WRITTEN THE FIRST TIME. Her point was that you'll never know what a recipe really tastes like unless you actually make the recipe. She was right. The last 3 reviews gave me NO CLUE what this recipe would taste like. Yellow squash is NOTHING LIKE butternut squash. That's like substituting zucchini for pumpkin. And adding tomato sauce? That would completely change the recipe. PLEASE - review the actual recipe! Do try this -- great fall flavors.

I used yellow squash and added some white mushrooms which was what I had on hand. After taking off the foil, I sprinkled some mozarella cheese on top and broiled it to brown the top and it gave it a nice crispy light crust...ABSOLUTELY delicious! My guests couldn't stop raving. I served with the Wilted spinach salad with warm apple cider and bacon dressing...yummy

This recipe is awesome, however, I thought it sounded like it was going to be a bit rich, so I made a tomato sauce and used it alternatively with the cream sauce. The result was a very flavouful lasagne that doesn't leave you feeling like you've just eaten a tub of cream!

omg I am soooo glad I made this prior to ever making it for guests. We are entertaining friends who do not eat meat and if I served it to them, I would be extremely disappointed. It was extraordinarily bland. I love squash, pasta, cheese, garlic and rosemary but this missed the mark by a long shot.

Very yummy! ...and very simple (when using pre-cubed squash from Trader Joe's). It didn't take long at all with the short cut and it was a huge hit at my house...and it was a hit again the next day at work when I brought in left overs!

Great recipe. I suggest one change however. In place of the 4 cups of milk use 3 cups chicken broth and 1 cup milk for a much lighter more flavorful lasagne.

I made this for a dinner party, because of the ease of a pre-cooked entree, but found it much too rich. It was actually difficult to eat for many of my guests. I'm going to try it again but without the cream. Microwaving the b.squash before pealing helps a little. Just for 1 1/2 minutes.

This is an excellent vegetarian lasagne recipe. I kept in the rosemary, as other reviewers had suggested. I also omitted the heavy cream topping mixture. The dish tastes wonderfully rich and is a unique way to use butternut squash (especially if you've grown 2 dozen in your garden!!!)

I roasted one head of garlic with the squash (and for 45 minutes beyond!) and added it to the sauce instead of cooking the garlic with the butter. It gives it a more mellow taste.

This was amazing! A wonderful dish, I had something similar at a restaurant a year ago and wanted to make it. I paired it with the Salmon baked with Spinach Mascarpone (from epicurious) and it was perfect. I looked at the reviews and also added some pinenuts and carmelized onions when I layered it. I will definintely make this again for company!! (soon!)

I had a small dinner party where this VERY rich dish was a huge hit. I servedf it with a simple salad and bread. It can be prepared ahead of time and assembled before going into the oven. Don't worry about how it appears before it goes into the oven -- it will bake into a wonderful creation! I have had two requests for the recipe since. I used 3/4 TBS fresh rosemary with the milk and did not strain it.

This is a fabulous dish. I made it for a vegetarian friend, and she gushed that it was the best thing she'd ever eaten(!) It is quite rich, so save it for a time you want to indulge. I made it with the whipped cream topping and liked the creamy texture that resulted. One time I made it with half butternut squash and half acorn squash, and that was good, too. It is a bit time-consuming to prepare, but it's worth it!

This is just a fabulous, unusual lasagna and always gets raves. I've made this both with and without the whipped cream topping, and I think it is much better with it! It helps make a creamier sauce and gives it a bit more body. It's not soggy if you just spread the cream over the top (it doesn't need to be mounded up, and I don't use the full cup.) Also, I prefer using regular lasagna noodles in this recipe. It works better for me since it doesn't have a very saucy sauce and the precooked are a bit dry and crunchy. Finally, I love the combination of sage and squash, so I use sage instead of rosemary, and carmelize some onions or leeks in with the squash. It's really wonderful. This time I took another reviewer's suggestion, and served it with a sweet and sour cabbage (Swedish Red Cabbage from this site). Great idea, they looked good together and tasted terrific.

I've made this 4 times. My changes to the recipe are: use fat free chicken broth for 1/2 the milk portion, squeeze in 2 full roasted bulbs of garlic to the sauce (to die for, and keep the rosemary in the sauce. Yuumm.

In spite of the reviews I was still surprised at how gourmet and yummy this recipe was. I followed everyones advice and didn't add the cream on top. Mine was perfect when I took the foil off but after 10 minutes uncovered the top dried out and curled up. Next time I would leave the foil on. I put this recipe in MasterCook and I was surprised for a maindish it's not as sinful as it seems when you eat it. I think the roasted squash gives it a very rich flavor without a ton of calories.

This was a fantastic lasagna and a hit with all my dinner guests! I took other reviewer's advice and didn't use the cream topping, but put thin slices of parmesan and regiano cheese on top instead. I tried it with mozzarella, but it came out too watery. Definitely making this again!

This was awesome !!! We'll most likely make it again soon. I omitted the steeping the rosemary in the milk step, and just added chopped rosemary to the sauce with the garlic (it added extra color) and I added a couple extra Tablespoons of flour to the sauce so it wouldn't be too runny. The use of fresh lasagne pasta from a local Italian Deli was great.

This was very average. I used a mixture of roasted butternut squash, sweet potatoes, carrots and grilled zucchini. I eliminated the top layer as suggested by others and used a combination of mozzarella & parmesan. It should have been great but was really so so. Not worth the effort when there are so many excellent lasagne recipes. Back to the drawing board.

This was a rich and delicious lasgne which I will probably make again. One problem I had was that the whipped cream layer turned back to liquid when I baked it and created a wet mess on top. I would recommend eliminating that step.

This was great. We had about half as much butternut squash as the recipe called for, so we added some carrots and potatoes to make up for the difference. I think it was even better this way than if we had just used the butternut squash. It was a big hit here in Egypt, and we are sure to make it again (maybe even as a casserole with some other shape of pasta).

This was fabulous, but cut the fat and the pain: eliminate the cream layer, it's totally unnecessary; use skim milk and low-fat butter/margarine - a few shakes of Molly McButter bring out the butter taste. Also: microwave the squash and save the time and agony of dicing/peeling it raw. Looks beautiful when served so it's great for company.

Absolutely fantastic! Peeling the squash is easier if you microwave it in a glass dish with a little water for about 8 mins. This cuts down roasting time as well.

I was so excited by the reviews for this recipe, and now as I'm submitting mine, I'm skeptical about my tastes, because I hated it! The very sweet squash with the not-at-all sweet white sauce, cheese and pasta just didn't mesh on my palate. I reviewed the recipe again to make sure I hadn't done something wrong, but I can't see anything I missed. I just didn't like, and I normally love unusual combinations. I threw the whole thing away!

This is an outstanding squash lasagne recipe. I served it at a school teacher/staff holiday luncheon and it was a big hit! Virtually everyone wanted seconds. I did alter the recipe a little, based on prior reviews. I used at least 4 1/2-5 lbs. butternut squash; 2 T garlic; 1 2/3 cups Parmesan and only 1/4 tsp salt with the heavy cream. Do make this -- you will love it.

You won't believe how delicious this recipe is! My meat-craving husband went back for seconds. I even used skim milk and cut the butter down to about three tablespoons. I also left off the whipped cream topping -- I'm sure it makes a beautiful presentation, and, for a dinner party, I would add it, but the lasagna was fabulous without it. I just saved a little bit of white sauce to coat the top of the noodles, and put parmesan on top of that. I also added about a quarter of a cup of white wine to the white sauce at the same time I added the milk, and used four big cloves of garlic in the roux. Be sure to salt and pepper the white sauce when you add the butternut squash. I will make this again and again!

A winner from this lifelong vegetarian. Reduce the fat by eliminating the cream on top and just sprinkle with a little cheese instead; the recipe doesn't suffer at all from that. Especially delicious served with something vinegar-y and colorful like Harvard beets or Swedish red cabbage.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes. I have a lot of friends that are vegetarians and when I need something quick and easy this is great.

I got more compliments on this dish than I could believe. It's a recipe to keep! To speed up the cooking process, one can microwave the squash whole to soften and then oven roast the pieces as directed. I have even just used the microwave to cook the squash and skipped the roasting procedure altogether. I also use extra cheese on top of the dish as the squash is quite sweet.
