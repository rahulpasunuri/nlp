I really liked what the yogurt did for this corn bread. I made it in an 8" x 8" pan instead of as muffins, cooked it just 7 minutes longer, reducing the heat down to 350 degrees for the last 10 minutes. I added a cob of fresh corn, and used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. When I took it out of the oven, just drizzled it with honey and covered it with foil until it was time to serve. The fresh corn and honey definitely added a much needed freshness, and sweetness to the bread.

I followed akalish's suggestions from the review below - absolutely yummy! Mine reminded me of of a large fluffy muffin shaped dumpling. They did brown rather dark on the bottom and side, but alas, no burnt taste. Will definitely keep this one.

this was awesome. fast, quick, easy, and yummy...but it left me craving fresh corn and cheddar cheese...maybe parmesan...??? also made me think of these rad chipotle cheddar corn biscuits that made my heart smile :) think about it...

Quite yummy. I made mini muffins- the recipe yielded 42! Just 5-6 minutes to bake in the convection oven.

standard not exceptional but easy and yummy.

I had such high hopes for these, but found them a bit bland. The only saving grace was the cayenne pepper, which added some much needed flavor. I would make these again, but maybe double the amount of chives.

I find these muffins quite bland. To make them again, I would definitely need to modify the recipe somehow for my taste. The muffins need at the same time more savory and sweet flavors for me--so perhaps a cheese with some honey. One modification I did make to this recipe was that I used Splenda instead of sugar as my mother-in-law cannot take sugar. I don't think that's the reason I am disappointed, though, but did want to note it.

These corn muffins had a beautiful texture and flavor. I think, however, that my cayenne was dead--either that or I prefer a bit more. Won't change it and will probably make these again!

Here were my changes: I didn't add the cayenne because I wasn't in the mood for it. I also used 2% fat greek yogurt which is twice as thick, so I added 1.5 cups of 2% milk so it wouldn't be dry. I also used about 1/2 cup chives instead of 1/4 cup and 3 tbsp of sugar. This made 22 muffins. Overall it was absolutely delicious. Next time I'll double the dry ingredients so they're heartier and fluff up more. The greek yogurt was great, though. It made the muffins nice and rich, but also creamy. The way I made it the baking time was perfect at 20min. Next time I'll grease muffins tins, though, instead of using the paper liners, since they were quicky sticky compared to other muffins I've made.

These were good but not exactly what I was looking for. Next time I will increase the sugar or add some honey for a little more sweetness. The yogurt is a nice touch, and the muffins came out very moist.

This is the best corn bread recipe I've ever had. I made them as regular size muffins and they came out nice and browned on the bottom and edges. Very tasty and moist and rich tasting without being a grease bomb. Plus I love to use yogurt in recipes. I have a feeling I will make these for the rest of my life.

I am a good cook, yet I have struggeld to find a corn bread recipe I was happy with. Tonight I went looking for a recipe and I had a clue what I wanted, it should have buttermilk and frozen corn kernels. Why then did I choose this recipe. I had some left over fresh chives in the fridge, plus it just felt right. I made the recipe as written, expect I subbed buttermilk for the yogurt and added about 1/2 cup of frozen corn. It was perfect. A new favorite. Thanks!

This recipe made forty mini muffins! 14 minutes was perfect. I used 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne instead of 1/2 so there was just a hint of spiciness and it didn't overpower the corn and chive taste. Served them with a spicey brisket barbecue -- delish!

I added some chili powder, cumin and ground coriander to augment the savory cayenne/fresh chives. Really tasty. I had no problems with texture. Next time I might up the sugar just a tad, only because I used organic stone ground corn meal which can sometimes be a little bitter even fresh. Oh, and I simply baked in an 8x8 pan, it was done in just under 25 minutes.

Made these this morning to go with a layered taco salad for dinner tonite. I followed everything as noted with two exceptions. I didnt find a small container of plain yogurt so I bought a Yoplait 6 ounce custard style Vanilla and added that. Added a little buttermilk to make it moister (prob. about 1/4 cup) and continued as follows. Turned out GREAT as I've sampled two already! Nice texture. The Cayenne is nice and not too strong. Use fresh chives if available. Will make again!

This was great. Moist and not dry like many corn muffin recipes. Not sweet either so you can serve it with many things.

After all the rave reviews, VERY disappointed with the results of this recipe. Followed the directions to the letter, including not overblending the ingredients. Muffins didn't rise very much, and were quite dry and crumbly. Nice flavour, but very marginal texture. I'll stick with the Cornmeal Cheddar Scones on this site when I want something "corny". Any suggestions on how I could improve would be appreciated.

Wonderful! I made this recipe in an 8 x 8-inch glass baking dish and baked at 425 degrees for approximately 30 minutes (tested for doneness with a knife-blade) and it was perfect. Also, I made the cornbread vegan by using egg substitute and Whole Soy plain soy yogurt. Fantastic. Spicy and moist. I will definitely make this again and again.

These have become a faithful standby for me. My husband is from Texas and loves these at all times of the day - especially with beans! They go with almost any gutsy main course. Very filling.

Great cayenne kick! I found the muffins to be a bit too dry which made them even spicier. Any suggestions? Served with the pork tenderloin with cranberry balsamic sauce and roasted acorn squash.

Looked/smelled/texture beautiful. My mistake was to omit the salt cuz I was using salted butter -- turned out very bland. Next time will be w/ salt and perhaps sour cream (instead of yogurt) to see if that also helps w/ the blandness.

Good, and for once, I don't think any modifications are necessary! I made mini-muffins and, like others, appreciate the texture and the zing.

Great muffins! Very moist and tasty! Loved the yogurt and fresh chive taste. Will be doing again for sure.

We thought these were great. Didn't have fresh chives so used dried which didn't do much to flavor - will definitely use fresh next time. Good texture, didn't fall apart when buttered. And they reheat very well.

I made the mini-muffins as an appetizer for Father's Day brunch last week. They went nicely with orange juice and champagne. Tomorrow, I'm making them again for brunch with a few of my girlfriends. Mmmm! This time though, I'm going to make them sweeter by adding more sugar.

These were a hit at our Mothers' Day Brunch. Very quick and easy to make--which is a definite plus!

I was not sure why these were getting such rave reviews, so i made a batsh last night. YUM! It is the yogurt that gives these muffins the zing. I make corn muffins all the time, and these may just be my favorites. You could easily omit the cayenne. I bet these would be so good for brunch with honey butter.

Made these tasty treats for Easter dinner and they were an unexpected hit. Most of the french bread from the bakery just sat there and ended up being used for a strata the next weekend. I did not include cayenne in the recipe originally because we had everything from seniors to wee little ones at the table. I'm going to add it to the batch I make for brunch next weekend and am looking forward to the results. Bottom line: very tasty, so easy and satisfying.

We served these with smoked brisket and it was the perfect accompaniment. I also used 1 3/4 flour and 3/4 corn meal. When served with garlic chive butter they will compliment most any meal and are a good aleternative to the traditional dinner rolls.

These were very good and different. Great with chili. What's up with the cook from LA? You either use paper liners OR spray the muffin cups. Muffins ALWAYS stick to the paper liners. Jeez!

These were okay...I didn't rewarm them the way the recipe said -- maybe that's why I found them only so-so. I'll definitely try making them one more time, this time rewarming them before serving.

Very good! The cayenne and fresh chives add a nice flavor.

We liked these muffins. I used 1 + 1/4 cups flour and 3/4 cup cornmeal because from experience it produces a muffin that will not crumble when buttered, but still plenty of taste and texture from the cornmeal. I also added more sugar because I ususally serve cornbread or muffins when we are having a somewhat salty main course - barbeque, ham, or chili because I like the contrast. These muffins looked good, had a nice texture, and tasted very good.

I made these muffins for Easter Brunch. They were yummy! If you use paper muffin cups, don't forget to use non-stick spray. I didn't, and the muffins stuck to the paper a little bit. I will definitely make these again.

These were scrumptious. I made them for Easter dinner. I doubled the recipe and they were almost all gone. They would be great for breakfast or brunch as well.
