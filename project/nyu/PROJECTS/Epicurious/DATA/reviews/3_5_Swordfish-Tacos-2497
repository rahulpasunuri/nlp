I made this tonight, exactly as written. My daughter and I thought it was really good, except for the corn tortillas, and we also felt that the swordfish needed a bit more seasoning. Next time, I'll use flour tortillas, and instead of brushing the swordfish with olive oil and then seasoning with salt and pepper, I will mix some garlic, salt, pepper, and cumin into the olive oil and use that mixture to brush the swordfish. The pico de gallo was perfect as is.

Sorry forgot to mention, I did marinate the fish for about an hour before hand. Super easy: use some lime zest, a full lime worth of juice, and use as much olive oil as is needed to coat the fish entirely. Don't forget salt and pepper! When grilling, drizzle the marinade over the fish to pump up the flavor and decrease waste. Delicious!

Delicious and incredibly easy dish. A couple of suggestions: shred and pickle the cabbage, add avocado to your toppings, and grill the fish.

Loved it. This is my new favorite way to eat swordfish. My husband liked it with lettuce, but I adored the cabbage. We both thought it needed a little red onion, avocado and cilantro, but those are details.

I made the tuna as is. However, I did not cook the sauce....we used it cold to top the tacos. I added a bit more spice with lime juice and black pepper. Also, I used soft shells...regular to the kids and red pepper for the adults. It was a very quick and easy meal that everyone enjoyed.

I have now made this recipe twice. The first time it turned out terrible. It's difficult to find thin swordfish steaks, so the cooking time is a lot longer than the recipe says. Also, the fish require a lot of seasoning. The second time I made the dish, it was very good, nice texture. The pico de gallo is also excellent. I will keep experimenting.

This was an easy and different way to use my second favorite fish. It was a big hit with friends and I wouldn't change a thing. I have access to so many different salsas where I live that substituting a bottled version is easier and tastes great. I have made it both ways.

I must be missing something. My taste buds fell asleep on this one. I used link cod, which I marinated with lime, a little white wine, and kosher salt. I added cilantro to the salsa. I was really disappointed because of the great reviews this recipe received. Dare to be different, but I give this a thumbs down.

This recipe is excellent. I love the crunchy cabbage with the fish. Like the other review I like to marinate with lime juice before grilling the fish. I also add a little diced yellow, red, or orange pepper to the pico de gallo. Excellent!

I made this with fresh Alaskan Halibut, very good. I also put fresh lime juice on the fish about an hour before it was grilled, that and alittle fresh herbs made this a real keeper in our house.

Loved the tacos. I did not have fresh swordfish, so I used salmon instead, and they were still delicious. I can't wait to try them again with swordfish.

This is a great recipe, almost the same way I have been making mine. I use diced white onion fresh cilantro in the salsa, instead of the green onion. Also, instead of the sour cream, a great substitute "white sauce", is plain yogurt mixed with an equal amount of good mayonaise. If you can get freshly made corn tortillas from a local tortilleria, this dish is heavenly! Fried or grilled snapper or cod is great for these tacos, too.

I made this recipe with halibut and served with tropical fruit salsa, shredded jicama and cabbage. Make sure to rub the fish liberally with oil or it will stick to the grill. It probably would work with any firm fish.

To my mind, this recipe encapsulates the three ultimates of culinary idealism, ie, seafood, Mexican and bbq (grill). Just go easy with the liquid ( from limes, pico de gallo ), it tends to flow up the shirt sleeves.
