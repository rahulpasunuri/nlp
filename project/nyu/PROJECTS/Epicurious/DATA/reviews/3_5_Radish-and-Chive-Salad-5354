Surprising delicious. I added chopped celery and a little extra sesame oil. The celery gave the dish a nice crunch and varied the texture. Excellent and the answer to what to do with all of those spring radishes!

Omg! This recipe is so good. I never know what to do with radishes and this is the answer. Such a nice light salad with a spicy daikon feel. I used chili sesame oil which gives the dish a nice kick. I will make this often!

Honestly, I didn't think this would be good, but it really was. It sounds to simple to be a recipe, but it works well. I added 1/2 cup canned salmon and 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh red pepper and ate it as a salmon salad and loved it!

Very simple and very delicious. I served this with a teriyaki-marinated grilled swordfish and it couldn't have been a better match.
