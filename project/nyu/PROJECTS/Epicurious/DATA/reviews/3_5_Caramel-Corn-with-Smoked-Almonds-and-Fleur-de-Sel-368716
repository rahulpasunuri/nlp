The first time I made this recipe, it was such a huge hit that everyone asked me to make a second batch the next day for the Superbowl. This time I decided to follow the recipe a little closer, rather than following my intuition, and did not have such successful results (of course, the friends that hadn't tried the first batch still loved it). I cooked the candy for exactly ten minutes, resulting in a light amber color and a somewhat tacky texture (soft crack), whereas last time I cooked it for 12 minutes to a hard crack stage, resulting in a deep caramel color and perfect crunch. Also, I used a generic brand of popcorn from the grocery store, and was not pleased with the size and texture of the kernels, and additionally had a higher rate of uncooked or burnt pieces. Before, I used a white popcorn (bulk at Whole Foods) with beautiful results, and next time I plan to try the "mushroom" popcorn variety, which is probably ideal. (I apologize for the double review, but can't figure out how to edit my past one...)

I had a delicious salted caramel corn recently from a restaurant, and was dying to find a similar recipe! This worked beautifully! I love that the kernels were individual, and crisp. It was a huge hit at my place! I was glad to have read the other reviews ahead of time. I put a little Pam in the mixing bowl, on the wooden spoon, & my hands and had no trouble at all. I also used a Silpat on the tray, which worked beautifully. In the recipe it says to cook the liquid until it reaches a light golden color. I cooked it for almost 12 minutes, and the color was barely beige. But, as soon as I added the butter and soda, it instantly turned to a deep golden brown, and I was glad I took it off when I did! (I was also at a higher altitude, which may account for the longer time; if you're cooking it at the correct temperature, pay closer attention to the time rather than a deepening color) Work fast for the best results! I broke the clusters up into smaller pieces in the bowl with my wooden spoon then used my hands to to break the smaller clusters into individual pieces to set on the Silpat. Also, be sure to put the salt on as soon as possible, because if it starts to cool, it won't properly cool. (I had someone sprinkle it on as I worked with it...) This recipe might be difficult if you're not familiar with making caramels, but if you follow these steps, it should make it easier! Also, as with any cooked sugars, just let the pan an tools sit in hot water for a few minutes and the water will do all the work, completely melting the sugar.

Agreed - this is very messy. It helps to soak everything in hot soapy water for an hour! Also, I forgot to take out the unpopped kernels and thus have to constantly pick them out of the clusters as I eat... not convenient! I used regular smoked almonds and regular sea salt - they added a slight flavor but did not make it overly salty or anything

This was very good, but there are 2 things to keep in mind: 1. cleanup is a BEAR. I oiled things liberally and everything, but the corn still stuck tenaciously. 2. I used regular store-bought smoked almonds (couldn't find marcona) and I think they made the whole thing too salty. I think with Marcona almonds this would be better. If you do use the storebought smoked almonds, taste before you sprinkle the corn with sea salt, or possibly don't salt the corn when you pop it. And I say this as a person who loves salt. However I would make this again.
