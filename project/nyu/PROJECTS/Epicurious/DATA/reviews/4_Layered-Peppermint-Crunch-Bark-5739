End result as I make it is very good; I make it every year. However, I'm not totally sold on the directions as written - especially for people who don't work with chocolate or candy much. For one, it seems odd to me that they specify 110 degrees when melting the chocolate. Since they're refrigerating it to set and store, they don't instruct you to temper it, but why specifically tell you to take it OUT of temper? There's no reason to take the temp, just go until it just melts and you're fine. (In response to a previous comment, if it clumps, it could be because moisture got in, or it could be that you burned it. As soon as it's smooth you're good, don't keep heating it.) For another, the instructions that have the chocolate by weight in the ingredients but then the instructions in post-melted volume is a little annoying. Makes it much harder to gauge if you're trying to scale the recipe or alter the process at all. Personally, I temper the white chocolate. Just make sure you work very quickly to pat those peppermints on or it will set up before you get them to stick! If you find the ganache layer too soft, try cutting back just a little bit on the cream to make a firmer ganache. Given the sweetness of white chocolate and candy, I think you definitely want to go with a very dark chocolate - 70% at minimum; I usually use 72% but have also used 85%.

I wanted to make this recipe go further than 36 pieces (I have many families to gift!) so I didn't do three layers, I stuck with two. My error was that I had liked the idea of the dark chocolate layer on the bottom, white on top. I think because there was cream added to the dark chocolate, it never solidified as much as the white chocolate did. I'm sure this consistency would've made a great middle layer of chewiness!

Made several times. Works best when I follow the recipe exactly and fight my urge to "make it my own." This recipe is genius. If your white chocolate clumps and won't spread, it has "seized" because moisture has gotten in while melting. Perhaps the bowl or spoon was not completely dry or steam from the double boiler managed its way into the chocolate. Sometimes a touch of oil or cream will resolve this. Other times, you have to bust out the back up bag. I try to ALWAYS have a back up. ;) Hope this helps someone!

This recipe is always a big hit with my family and friends during Christmas! I follow the recipe all the way to the end, except for I substitute Peppermint Puffs-which are softer- instead of the harder peppermint candy.

I made this today with my daughters ages 8 &11 for teacher's gifts. The girls loved crushing the peppermint sticks and melting the chocolate (use a ziploc) and crush. The results looked professional, and I didn't have a candy thermometer FYI. However, the bark tasted saccharine sweet--the white chocolate overpowered everything. I think this may have been because I bought Nestle brand white chocolate and not Lindt or Baker's brand. That is all that was available at the store. I read the ingredients after I finished the bark and it contained sugar and palm kernel oils NO cocoa butter like Bakers, Lindt or Ghiardelli. I was upset because the label said premium white chocolate. I was in a hurry and should have read the label at the store.So DO NOT buy Nestle's white chocolate. I would also recommend putting 1/2 the peppermint pieces on the first layer as they all fall off at the end. I would just drizzle white chocolate next time on the last layer using less and I would use 2 tsps of peppermint extract. It was not pepperminty enough. Overall, just okay tasting it didn't hold a candle to Williams Sonoma brand, but at least the girls saw how it is made and we had fun. Try it, but heed my advice about the white chocolate.

This is always a hit over the holidays. I used candy canes instead and 1/2 teaspoon peppermint oil and 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract (the latter is an alcohol solution). I've never reduced the cream but also find it's important to spread the bittersweet chocolate mixture as quickly as possible. Only criticism is that the final three-layered slab is fairly thick, and I prefer thinner, larger pieces of bark to thick chunks. You can actually go pretty thin with the first layer (and not worry about it being too flimsy) as it's going to be bulked up with the additional layers.

Followed recipe exactly. Easy and delicious, but the dark chocolate gets soft quickly at room temp. Is that because of the cream? Comments or opinions?

Rating: 4
Based on other reviews, I omitted the cream - haven't seen a problem with the chocolate becoming mushy at room temperature. I changed the proportions of the recipe somewhat based on what I had: 1 11 ounce bag of Ghirardelli white chocolate chips made my bottom layer and 1 12 ounce bag of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips (with only 3/4 tsp of fresh peppermint extract) made the top layer. I did NOT follow with a second layer of white. In retrospect, I think the crushed candy canes look prettier on a white background - so my next batch will use the 3 layers. Not inexpensive to make, but personal and very tasty!

First time using this recipe and it turned out perfectly. I melted the chocolate in a double boiler on low heat to avoid any possible lumps.Make sure you stir every couple of minutes during melting process and it will be smooth and shiny. I work at Williams-Sonoma, so used a jar of their crushed peppermint candy, which makes everything so much easier. We sell peppermint bark, but I wanted to experience making it...glad I did because it is so fresh. Used half pint clamp jars tied with red ribbon...so pretty! I know my friends and family will be impressed. Thanks.

We thought it was fabulous: I made it as called for, but I did use good quality chocolate chips because I find they melt more evenly - and you have to truly keep the heat low or it will clump.

Followed recipe and had excellent results. Used ghiradelli white and callebaut bittersweet. Use small peppermint candies- unwrapping all those candy canes was really tedious. Would not use the cusinart to crush the candy again. It produces a lot of powder and I prefer the look of the sharper edge crushing gives the peppermint. I cut the finished bark into small trapezoidal shapes with the sides angled in the same direction. Very tasty and not too sweet. Will give as gifts.

I just re-made this tonight after thoroughly reviewing other's posts. My white chocolate melted wonderfully - unlike last time. All I did was not use the premium white chocolate and heeded the manufacter's instructions. No 4 level heat - high on microwave (for the white only). I found that the dark chocolate melted nicely at the 4 level on the microwave. Chilled the chocolate layer for about 30 minutes, then poured the white over it and sprinkled the candy canes on top and pressed in like the previous poster stated. Also, putting the candy canes in a mini-processor was much easier. Just zap a few times and keep your eye on consistency. Less is more - IMHO - I mean less chopping! You do want some candy cane chunks afterall. MUCH easier than bashing w/a rolling pin!!! My batch w/the mint chocolate morsels from Trader Joes had a better flavor - I must say...! If you can find them, seek them out in lieu of the peppermint extract.. But no one would ever know the difference! I took my 1st try "white/dark swirl" batch to a party the other night - GONE! No one knew it was supposed to be perfectly dark and white layered! Delish - no doubt!

Rating: 4
I've made this every year to rave reviews! My only change is to use candy canes instead of the round candies. The execution is a little tricky. In some cases, I've had challenges with the white chocolate getting "pasty" (temp too high?) or not enough dark chocolate layer to cover the first. This year I used real peppermint extract and didn't adjust the quantity (really minty!). But it doesn't seem to matter to my testers!

Rating: 4
I think I am noticing a trend in the reviews: those that did not follow the recipe exactly had less than desirable results. In my case, I did everything by the recipe and had no problems at all. Keep in mind that chocolate is a very temperamental thing. If you skip a step then your chocolate is likely to react negatively. It did take a bit longer for the bittersweet layer to set. But I never had to put anything in my freezer overnight to force it to set. I also didn't have any issues with the bark at room temperature (after the setting process was complete). This bark is a little thinner than bark I have tried in the past, but I think it is great the way it is. This one is going to become a tradition in my household!

i make this every year for friends, family and teachers, the list grows and grows. i use CALBAUT bittersweet and white chocolate. i don't use cream. i break the bark up and use the christmas containers that come out every year and wrap it with personallized ribbon from william sonoma. it's always a big hit and budget friendly!

I just made this according to one of the poster's advice. No cream - microwaved the chocolates. I found mint chocolate chips at Trader Joes. I used those w/no cream and no peppermint extract. The only problem I had was w/the white chocolate. It never got to a consistancy so it would pour. Was clumpy and there was no way it would spread. Didn't want to scald the chocolate so ended up making them more like chocolate swirls w/the peppermint candy bits on top. Refrigerated for about an hour and so before breaking up. Tastes wonderful and so far am not having a problem w/them melting at room temp. Would prefer that the white chocolate worked so i could have that pure white chocolate look but I don't think anyone would even notice that it was not intended to look that way. Would love some advice on how to melt the white chocolate correctly. :) BTW - I used Nestle's premium white chocolate.

Used Bakers white and Scharffen Berger Dark Bittersweet. As I was making it I thought the layers were way too thin. No one else has mentioned this. However, after it is completed, I like the "thin-ness" of this candy (not quite 1/2 inch thick). After the final layer and chilling for 20 minutes, I removed it to cut and it was still too soft to cut without the dark chocolate layer separating. Nearly everyone has said to reduce the amount of cream so the dark chocolate layer will set up and next time I will try that. What made this recipe so incredibly easy was the pre-packaged crushed peppermint candy in 10 oz bags! Does anyone have tips on how to give this as gifts? It seems to start to melt fast right after being removed from the refrigerator. Thanks for all the tips! Would love to hear from anyone who has given these as gifts, I am new to candy-making.

This was a DISASTER! Everything went fine until the part of melting the dark chocolate and adding the extract and cream - We "seized" bag after bag of expensive Ghiradelli chocolate chips trying to get this to work somehow. Finally had to give up and just melted the chocolate without the cream and extract. We're waiting now for it to set before trying the last white chocolate layer. How did you all get yours to work!?! It sounded so easy in review after review???!!!

Excellent recipe. I am not very experienced working with chocolate, and I found that the humidity of the refrigerator affected the chocolate so much that it would "sweat" or be covered with condensation when removed from the fridge. We had to leave it in the icebox until it was all eaten up. Does anyone have any advice on how to let it cool, either inside or outside of the fridge, or a way to alter the recipe so that the chocolate doesn't melt the very moment that someone picks it up off the tray?

Rating: 4
Great, easy recipe. I made it as a gift and it was just so pretty! I did reduce the cream to 3 tbsp. and the chocolate seemed to set up fine. I also increased the peppermint extract to 1 tsp, which really helped with the flavor. The toughest part of the recipe was rough chopping the peppermints; they were ridiculously hard! That problem was solved with a blender, however.

Rating: 4
This is the 2nd year I've made this and everyone always LOVES it. If your white chocolate doesn't turn out it's because you are not watching your temperature. You should not go over 110 degrees or it changes the consistency. If the chocolate doesn't work out, you either don't have good chocolate or your heat is too high.

I make this every year- delicious! I use nestle's bittersweet chocolate and white chocolate chips and they are as good as the gourmet chocolates (Callebaut, etc) in my opinion. And, it is also easier to melt the white chocolate chips in the microwave in two separate batches. It is a little tricky to get the chocolate layers just chilled enough so that the next layer goes on evenly. But it is worth the effort.

Since this recipe was such a hit during the baby shower, I decided to make it again- this time as holiday presents. Unfortunately, I ran into a blip I thought everyone would like to know about. When you pour your chocolate, make sure you rough up the top layer. My three layers have started to come "unglued". I think it you give it a rougher texture, the next layer will have an easier time attaching. I also had a typo in my previous review- I used 1/2 c. heavy cream, not 1/4. But, again it was a good recipe and still met rave reviews. I highly suggest giving this easy recipe a try!

Rating: 4
Great recipe for either Christmas presents or party favors. I used them for a shower honoring a baby girl- perfect being that I finely chopped the peppermint candies, resulting in a pink color. As for following the recipe, I doubled the quantities, using ghiradelli & lindt chocolate. For the middle layer, I used a 1/4 cup of whipping cream and 1 1/4 tsp of peppermint extract. I had the chocolate harden in the freezer between layers but otherwise stored it in a cool dry place. To make breaking the bark a little easier, I covered a cookie sheet with tin foil and buttered it thoroughly. When the bark was finished and still slightly cool, i transferred it to wax paper. From there, it easily cut into triangles. I'm really happy with this recipe and will probably be revisiting it frequently...

used ghirardelli white and bittersweet (60%) chocolate bars. used 4 T. cream which seemed to work okay. cut down the peppermint extract to 1/2 tsp. based on previous review but i think i'll up it back to 1 tsp next time because it didn't taste quite minty enough. used candy cane candies instead of the peppermints (maybe that's why i need more extract). i did just one layer of each so next time will do the dark layer first because the peppermint candies don't show otherwise. not as good as williams sonoma but pretty good!

great and fairly simple recipe although it required some patience waiting as each layer hardened. I've never made this before and it turned out perfectly! Key, it seems, is to follow the recipe by the letter of the law. I wouldn't alter it at all... there are variables to consider when working with chocolate. If the chocolate is melted too quickly or to the wrong temperature it can affect its appearance, texture and the way it hardens. Follow this recipe as directed and you will be pleased with the results.

Great recipe, easy, and a great holiday gift. I made it for all my friends, family, neighbors and clients. It is very tasty and easy to make, a little time consuming but my kids loved crushing up the candy canes. I am a little shocked at the other reviews. I have had no complaints and everyone so far loves it, including myself and immediate family. It is hard to cut but it is bark and not suppose to be cut perfectly. As you start cutting it breaks up just fine. Give it a try if you haven't yet. You can do it in stages if you don't have time to do it all at once. Oh another tip, double the batch, it fills up a whole cookie sheet. Cheers!

This is very tasty and festive. It is a bit time consuming, so have something to do in between the ins and outs of the fridge! You will have problems if you overcook the chocolate; it turns from liquid to thick and clumpy. If you catch it right away, add a little oil and remove from heat, stirring. It should be fine. I will crush the candy more next time. As for the chocolate, Nestle's did a fine job for this first batch for the kiddies.

I haven't made this particular recipe yet, but am planning to and read all the reviews with interest. I noticed some people complained they couldn't cut the bark. I've made a similar layered peppermint bark before and I always break it into pieces vs. cutting it. It's so much easier and the uneven pieces also look much more like bark, I think. Just a suggestion!

I had high hopes for this recipe and wanted to package it for gift giving. I followed the original recipe except for using 1/2 the cream so the chocolate wouldn't be too soft. Really, the end result was melted and re-solidified chips with crushed candy cane. The layers were difficult to spread, and came out too thick (very unlike the Wm and Sonoma bark). I think I'll salvage the ingredients by using the bark in a peppermint brownie recipe or a cookie recipe. There are other Christmas recipes out there to be had, including less intensive peppermint bark recipes (food network and cooks for example).

I've used this recipe many times as written and with some experimentation. I just finished 5 batches last night! I've gotten the best results using Lindt White and Lindt Swiss Bittersweet. I cut back the peppermint extract to 1/2 tsp. and the cream to 5 tbl. I read that several reviewers left out the cream from the bittersweet layer, but doing that makes it too brittle for my taste. I really like the softer truffle-like texture of the bittersweet layer. For those folks who had trouble cutting the bark neatly or keeping the layers together, removing all or too much of the cream will do that. Also, if you chill it too long before cutting (I've done that too many times to count), it will be more difficult to cut. This really is quite tasty. I always get lots of compliments. I just got another request for the recipe today.

I've made two batches now. I used Valrhona chocolate for the bittersweet part and Ghirardelli for the white chocolate. I'd like to try Guittard but I haven't found it yet. Today, I let it sit in the refrigerator too long after the final step. I had a little more trouble cutting the candy. I had a few broken pieces so I think it's important to cut the candy after the 20 minutes the recipe calls for the candy to be chilled. It still tastes fabulous and this will be added to my permanent Christmas collection.

This was a bit labor-intensive but basically pretty easy to make -- and so delicious! My coworkers are steadily picking away at the plate I brought in to work. Like others, I reduced the cream, to 4 tablespoons. I also used 1/4 tsp. peppermint oil because I didn't have extract and the dark layer is just minty enough. Next time I might add another 1/8 tsp for a cool mint taste. I did find the white chocolate didn't completely "reset" again, maybe because the bark was in and out of the fridge? I used half Ghiradelli white bars and half bulk El Rey white chocolate from Wholefoods. I also might go with semisweet in the middle instead of Scharffenberger bittersweet next time, which is very rich. When the layers were set, I cut the slab of bark into 1 1/2-inch strips and then just cut wedges of different sizes from each of those strips. I cut it straight out of the fridge and got nice clean breaks. I'll do this next time too as the soft bark seems like it would be hard to cut cleanly. I'd also recommend crushing the peppermint candies right before you use them because I made this over an afternoon and an evening and by the time I put the second layer of candies on they had softened and clumped together in the ziplock bag I crushed them in. Thanks epicurious -- and all the reader and user tips! This is delicious!

I make a similar version of Peppermint Bark. I used 1-12 oz. bag of Ghiradelli white chips and 1-12 oz. bag of Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips and 10 Hershey's Chocolate Mint Candy Canes. I unwrapped the canes and smashed them in a large zip bag, then sifted the small, sandy granules into a separate bowl. I melted the semi-sweet chocolate in a bowl in the microwave for 1 minute at level 4. Stirred and micro'd for another 30 seconds, stirring until smooth. I then added 2 dashes of peppermint extract to the chocolate and spread it on to a 15x10 pan which I lined with foil and sprayed with non-stick spray. I then melted the white chips the same way as the semi's, stirred in the small sandy candy cane granules and spread over the semi-sweet chocolate. Then I sprinkled the candy cane bits over the top and lightly pressed them into the chocolate. The chocolate set up overnight. It was very easy to cut up and I didn't have any shards or the bottom breaking away from the top, just nice clean cuts. My friends LOVED it. I see no need for cream in the recipe. Try it my way - easy and delicious.

This was outstanding! Made for Christmas gifts and everyone raved. Based on previous reviews, I cut down the amount of whipping cream to 3T in the semi-sweet chocolate layer. I also used white and semi-sweet chocolate chips (Trader Joe's) with good results. I'll be making this again soon!

I use a box of candy canes instead of 30 peppermint candies. One, it makes it easier to crush and two, I can get a finer crush, which in my opinion is much preferable to big chunks of candy... that just detracts from the delicate texture of the chocolates. I make this every year for work, friends, and home, and it always gets raves.

I've lost track of the number of times I've made this. Some tips: The chocolate is easier to work with if you freeze the layers before you put the next one on. Cool the chocolate until it's barely spreadable, and work quickly. Before you cut the chocolate, freeze it until the top layer is solid, then let it warm to room temperature so it doesn't shatter.

I have been making this for years b/c we and all the people I've ever served it to love it and ask for it again. Usually, it takes forever, and involves nasty words at some point in the process. This was the first time I made it since my 2-yr old was born, so I took some shortcuts: 1-Refridgerated the peppermints for a little while, sprayed my mini-chopper w cooking spray, and used that to crush the candies - they came out a little finer than usual, but took 1/2 the time and 1/4 of the mess; 2-Did both chocolates in the microwave, checking the white ever 30 secs and the dark/cream every 10. Came out beautiful and delicious as ever w much less mess and effort!

My 2nd post. A helpful hint to those who are having hard time cutting the bark. After I chill the bark, I let it sit on my kitchen counter for 30 minutes or so. At that point bark is softer, and you can make beautiful cuts. Also I use more white chocolate than the receipe calls. Once again, my bark was a big hit.

I made this recipe last night and it turned out BEAUTIFULLY!!!! We live in an area that seems to be a void for any specialty food item, so we did use peppermint candies, but we were forced to use mint extract for flavoring and it still tasted delicious. I had noticed that people had said that this didn't cut easily and that this resulted in crumbles, we didn't have this problem . . .following the last white chocolate addition we immedietly placed the bark back into the fridge and set a timer for the specified time. I think if the bark cools to long, it will crumble when it is cut. However, we ended up with perfect triangles. . . we increased the final yield by cutting each triangle into two more triangles. Superb results . . .this is definitely a keeper!

Wow!! My husband (who doesn't usually like mint) can't keep his hands out of the bag! The recipe is easy, and delicious as is, but in the future I will cut down on the amount of whipping cream as the bittersweet layer is more like a truffle and doesn't harden very well. I also used Peppermint candy flavoring instead of extract and it turned out great! I'm already being asked for the recipe! Enjoy!

this recipe is almost identical to one I made off the food network website, and let me tell you is it ever delicious. I used lindt 70 % coco and mixed it in with some other good quality dark chocolate and it was just the best thing ever. I ended up having to give ost of it away early because I kept eating so much of it. mmmmmm

I have made this recipe many times and it is always well received. There are a couple of tips that have helped me to get better at making this treat. First, I use my Silpat on an inverted cookie sheet and make a larger amount than a single recipe. The candy slips easily off of the Silpat to the cutting board. Second, temperature is key. Cool your chocolates for the second and third layers to almost room temperature (check frequently to make sure that it is still spreadable). Making this in Michigan in the winter, I have the luxury of a garage that doubles as a frige. I move trays in an out as I proceed. Finally, if your last layer hardens before you can sprinkle it with crushed peppermint, a few seconds under your boriler will soften it. Hold your sheet 10 or 12 inches under the broiler and I really mean a few seconds. I have also found that the candy cuts more neatly if the top layer is a bit soft.

My husband, who never indulges in sweets and doesn't even really like mint, said this was the best thing I have ever made in 10 years and I cook good food a lot!! It is that good! I made it way less fussy - just covered a cookie sheet with wax paper and poured the melted chocolate from onto it and spread it. I omitted the cream entirely and used 1 lb white ghiradelli chocolate and 3/4 lb dark ghiradelli chocolate. Melting the chocolate in the microwave and chilling the first layer in the fridge made this fast, easy and amazing! Everyone who tasted it wanted the recipe! The scraps taste wonderful over vanilla ice cream too :)

Made this for co-workers. They loved it. This did take a little time but it was very easy. Make sure to cool the dark choc. to room temp before layering it on the 1st layer of white choc. also cool the last layer of white choc and work very quickly when spreading it out or else the dark choc will melt. I reduced the cream from 6 to 5 tablespoons. Try this recipe, it it's easy and a great Christmas time treat.

This is a great recipe! It tastes great and makes the perfect gift. I'm giving some to everyone in my family for Christmas! After the first batch, it becomes really easy to make. Although I have not quite mastered the art of cutting it yet--it always seems to crack into little uneven bits. Great recipe though!

I made this last night to give to some friends today, and I was not impressed. The dark chocolate seemed too minty and when I went to cut it, the top layer of white chocolate cracked into many pieces and did not look attractive. I was disappointed. Today however I can hardly stop sneaking little bits of it myself! Delicious! Not too minty! And as for the cracks? Makes it look homemade, not storebought! So what, it's great! Good thing I waited till today to write this review. I hope I have some left to give my friends.

Well I made this last night to bring to some friends today, and I was not impressed. The dark chocolate seemed too pepperminty and when I went to cut it into pieces, the top layer of white chocolate cracked into pieces and did not look at all attractive. Today I changed my mind. I keep sneaking little tastes myself all day - wonderful! Not too minty! Delicious!Cracked? So what? Looks genuinely homemade, not storebought! Good thing I waited till today to write this review.

I have made this bark every year since 1998, and it has become "a must have" on my friends holiday wishlist. I make it for teachers, and neighbors, and they all talk about it, and request some more year after year. It is a bit time consuming, but well worth the smiles it puts on my friends faces.

As I don't ever make candy, I bought inexpensive (Bakers) chocolate for my first try at this recipe. The recipe was very easy and it turned out great. No problems with layers separating. My husband gets Williams-Sonoma bark every year at Christmas. He said this recipe is superior to the commercial product (maybe because he can have it year round). Imagine when I use "the good stuff".

This was utter simplicity! Plus very easy to ad lib. Used 12 oz bag of both white & semi-sweet chocolate chips & kept whipping cream at same amount. All our friends said it tasted like Williams-Sonoma's much more expensive version!

I should have been suspicious since Baker's is NOT "good quality chocolate" and you should never melt chocolate over water- if any sneaks into your chocolate it will seize. This recipe was a pain in the neck to make. I tempered Callebaut chocolate using the microwave and felt it was a waste of chocolate and my time. And it called for WAY too much candy on the top layer- "coarsely crushed" ended up meaning it fell off the chocolate... It was not a pretty sight (the candy and my kitchen) because I couldn't cut the pieces without it breaking to bits. I did give the few properly cut pieces to some friends and they liked it. Go figure, indeed. Incidentally, for the person from Raleigh using white chocolate chips, yes, you are right, you can't use them- they don't melt properly.

We made this Saturday night and it worked out perfectly according to the directions. We did decrease the cream to 4 tablespoons. Can't stop eating it straight from the fridge but it is much better in flavor at room temperature. It still is not as good as William Sonomas peppermint bark but definately meets the bill when you want this flavor combination. Fairly easy to make during watching a movie and setting a timer.

Rating: 3
Delicious and easy. I made a few changes: add a pinch or two of instant espresso powder to the dark chocolate - it enhances the dark chocolate, also I decreased the heavy cream to 3 Tbl instead of 6 otherwise the dark choclolate will never set up solid. Overall a great recipe. Looks pretty, easy to make and tastes delicious.

I found this delicious and amazingly simple to make-when you use the microwave to melt the chocolate. I love the truffle-like dark chocolate layer. Used double chocolate ghirardelli chips for that, and white chocolate from Trader Joe's.

Beautiful Christmas gift wrapped in cellophane! My husband and 2 yr old daughter were instant fans. I used multicolored peppermint candies (Brachs) which I crushed while still in the bag wth a rolling pin .

This was my first time to make this (and any candy for that matter). It turned out beautiful and delicious! I agree with the reviewer below that it is a bit tedious, but it was definitely worth it. Also, I did not use the expensive Lindt white chocolate. I used "Ambrosia" brand white bark, which came in a 24 oz. package (looked like an ice cube tray, with each cube representing 2 oz. of white chocolate). I actually thought this melted much better than any other white chocolate I've tried. Definitely DO NOT use Baker's! To crush the peppermints, I unwrapped them and put them in a ziploc bag and then gently pounded with a meat mallet. I will definitely be making this every year from now on!

Rating: 4
I've been making this recipe as a Christmas staple for six years. Our winter climate is great for setting the trays outside to chill rather than taking refrigerator space. Once the dogs ate the entire batch of fine Lindt white chocolate and I had to resort to making a quick batch with the cheap grocery store almond bark...honestly, couldn't tell the difference. I double the peppermint extract. Keep the candy coarse. It's more fun to eat.

This recipe is loved by all who I have given it to! But one person, who didn't like peppermint candies inspired me to try the same recipe with a twist. I substituted the peppermint candies with coffee beans and added instant coffee/powder instead of peppermint extract and added nuts on top too. She LOVED it and others asked me for the recipe!

Great recipe, a bit tedious, but worth the work. Would reccomend it to any chocolate-peppermint lovers :)

I made this last year and gave it as gifts. Everyone loved it and I've had requests for it this year. I had never worked with chocolate before and it was SO EASY!! It went without a hitch. One hint for crushing the peppermints. Instead of trying to chop them, I put them on a plate, covered them with saran wrap and crushed them with a heavy glass jar. It was actually so satisfying of a crunch that I wished it had taken longer to crush them all. Anyway, this is delish. Having 3 layers, white, chocolate, white, really prevents dark chocolate on the fingers so I'm not sure what the review below meant.

I was real pleased with how this came out. I used the semisweet chocolate. The final product looked nice and tasted great. If I were giving a food gift this would be it. I'm sure this will be an annual "must do" from now on.

Rating: 3
I only made 2 layers of chocolate. White topped by dark so that if it melted on your fingers, it wouldn't make a dark chocolate mess. When I crushed the peppermint, it made a lot of dust. I put the lot in a fine mesh strainer and sifted it over the first layer before it cooled. Couldn't let it go to waste. I used Callebeaut white chocolate chips and El Rey semi-sweet chips. Delicious. Melted the chocolate in the microwave at 50% one minute at a time and cut the cream by half. The only problem I have found is that the peppermint softens over time, so if you are giving this as a gift, I wouldn't make it too early. It doesn't bother me though!

Rating: 4
I was so sad to see the lower review. Ever since I made this a few years ago, it has been an annual request. I have not had any of the problems that others have unless the chocolate was too hot-- but that seems common sense to me. I don't think that it is too much trouble. In fact, I think it's a fun recipe and would highly recommend it to any peppermint chocolate lovers

Really liked the recipe and will make it again - but REALLY wish I had made it with semi sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet. The bittersweet chocolate takes away from the white chocolate. Definitely not a breeze to make - chopping the mints, etc. was kind of a hassle - but definitely something that I would make again.

I have been making this recipe since Bon Appetit first printed it in 1998. It has become a signature dish for the holidays. I use the best quality white chocolate-Lindt and Valhrona for the dark chocolate. It is a always a big hit and it looks like it was made by a professional.

Rating: 4
This is a nice-looking treat that is delicious too! It is best to use good quality chocolate (I used Valrhona) and remember to spread quickly to keep layers separate.

Rating: 4
I include this in my food gifts every year. It's fantatic! This year, for some reason, my white chocolate seized and separated before I could apply the 3rd layer. Since we were in the middle of a snow storm and I couldn't run out to get more, I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips for the 3rd layer thus making my layers 1. white chocolate 2. bittersweet chocolate 3. semi-sweet chocolate. This made it even more perfect (and less "rich")!!! I'll do it that way from now on!!

Rating: 4
I don't normally like minty things but I looove this bark and just made my first batch of the holiday season! I use white chocolate chips since they're much less expensive. I find that the semisweet chocolate layer really has to be firm, and the white chocolate can't be too hot, in order to get a good looking finished product. If either of those fail then I get the mixing problems mentioned below. Having said that, even if I muddy up the white chocolate layer with the dark, I find that by the time I get the crushed candy on top it's really not a noticeable thing... love this!

This is really good, but compared to Williams Sonoma or World Market peppermint bark, this is REALLY rich. I can only eat 1 tiny piece a day. It is also a HUGE Pain to make. I don't see where the fool-proof part is. Granted I'm not a candy maker so I fully understand it might be my lack of skill. I'm going to try it in the microwave to see if I can lessen the pain.

My signature holiday homemade gift for the third year in a row! I use Ghirardelli chocolate and King Leo's peppermint sticks with great results. Although this recipe is quite labor intensive and does not yield a lot, it is well worth it! I always use a lot less crushed peppermint than the recipe calls for and for the first layer use more finely ground bits so it's easier to spread the dark chocolate layer over. Also, to make cutting easier, I take it out of the fridge and let it stand for at least ten minutes so the layers don't separate. My "regulars" eagerly anticipate this bark well before the holidays! =)

Well, I followed the directions pretty much to a "T" but when I added the second layer of white chocolate and tried to spread it, it just melted the dark chocolate and the whole thing was an ugly mess. I will very likely throw it away. The only spot in which I deviated from the directions is in the white chocolate. I could not find white chocolate at my local grocery store, so I substituted white chocolate chips. I suppose this could be the problem, as I believe chocolate chips contain some sort of edible wax that helps them to keep their shape. So perhaps the chips did not melt to as thin a consistency as regular chocolate would have, therefore taking more time to spread and resulting in more melting of the underlying dark chocolate. My guess would be that white chcocolate chips are inappropriate for this recipe. None the less, I doubt I'll give this recipe another whirl without knowing for sure what the problem was, as I'd hate to waste any more of my time and money. For those of you considering making this recipe, I'd say its not foolproof as written, so consider my problems in deciding whether you want to proceed. If you go ahead, may your experience be better than mine!

I am in the process of making lots of this treat for holiday gifts. It is very easy to make and everyone loves it. I did discover one tip today. I was not quite quick enough in spreading the last layer of white chocolate and my crushed peppermint would not stick. I stuck the whole thing about 10 inches below the broiler for about 15 seconds and then pressed the peppermint into the chocolate. It solved the problem.

Easy to do, tastes great and looks good, too. This is first on my list of homemade Christmas treats. I use candy canes rather than the peppermints, just like the flavor better. Good chocolate is the key, look for the bulk bars at gourmet markets like Trader Joes and Cost Plus, or at cake decorating supply stores. This is a fun recipe to do with the kids, send them out to the garage with a bag full of candy canes and a rolling pin to smash them, they'll have a blast!

This recipe was fantastic! All my family and friends just loooooooved it!

This looks very pretty and tastes delicious, although it is quite rich. I reduced the cream to 4 tablespoons, to cut down a bit on the richness. Also used red & green striped candy canes, which looked nice, and tinted the top layer of white chocolate pink. This is just as impressive looking as Williams-Sonoma's version ($19.50 a pound!). Obviously, the better-quality chocolate you use, the better the results. I used Callebaut white & dark chocolate, which worked very well. Will be making again for my next holiday party.

WOW! This was a piece of cake to make....er....should I say a piece of bark? I used Baker's white chocolate, Guittard semi-sweet chocolate chips and Brach's peppermint candies. I had absolutely NO trouble. Other than halfing the recipe for the first tasting (a one time deal after tasting!), I followed the directions exactly. Again, NO problems whatsoever with separating chocolate or in the cutting. I used a good, large chef's knife for cutting. I plan to put this recipe to extensive use over this holiday season!!

I thought this was a very delicious, but rich, recipe. I used Lindt white chocolate and Ghiradelli sweet dark chocolate because I didn't have time to find any bittersweet.Also, I usedKing Leo's peppermint sticks. Perhaps if people are finding it difficult to cut, they might try chilling it a little more. The only trouble I had making this was that I spread the dark chocolate too soon, but it wasn't noticeable at all later. Everyone that I gave it to really loved it and wanted the recipe for themselves!

I made tried this recipe after tasting William and Sonomas version, which I love, and would not make it again. For starters, I feel the addition of cream is unnecessary, but even without it the bark is far too rich to enjoy. Also, like the previous reviewer, my white chocolate also easily separated from the dark while trying to cut it into pieces. I would not make this again.

Rating: 3
These taste great, but mine didn't look very nice. I couldn't cut them without the white chocolate layer breaking. From the reviews it doesn't seem like anyone else had this problem. My white chocolate layers solidified very quickly, but the chocolate layer stays soft so cutting really didn't work too well. I've made two batches now, so it wasn't a one time mistake. Any tips????

I am surprised that this recipe got such rave reviews! I found the finished product to be rather dull and a little tacky! The peppermint candies make it look anything but classy.

Go figure. With all the wonderful holiday goodies out there, I wouldn't waste my time on this.
