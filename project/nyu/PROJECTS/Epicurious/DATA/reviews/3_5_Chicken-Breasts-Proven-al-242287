Simple and delicious! I used canned italian tomatoes (2 small cans) instead of fresh tomatoes. As I didn't have anchovies, I used olive paste. It tasted very good. I served it with boiled red potatoes. I will serve this recipe again.

It had all of the right ingredients but I thought it was just ok. The chicken turned out well. I used canned diced tomatoes and they were pretty tart, should have added sugar. I was expecting the flavors of a slow roasted Provencal or something similar, it wasn't even close. There are better week night recipes for chicken. I'll make the real deal on weekends.

This is a terrific week-night recipe, but it can be made even simpler without sacrificing taste. First, skip the whole tomatoes and use a vac-pac of chopped Italian tomatoes. Up the garlic and anchovies. If you are using the "juice" from the tomatoes you do not have to bother with broth. Skip the butter, skip the basil. Definitely add capers. Serve it over egg noodles. Rave reviews from your family but this is not for guests.

I read the reviews and wanted to avoid the bland complaints. So first I slow roasted the plum tomatoes for 2.5 hours with olive oil, salt, pepper, sugar, fresh oregano and basil. Otherwise I followed the recipe precisely and was quite pleased. Anchovy fillets and black olives are necessary ingredients here!

This is really delicious, I added capers to it, and also use black or green or both olives..The mediterranean flavors are so good. I have made it twice and everyone has loved it, so far!

I enjoyed this recipe. I did make some adjustments. My husband does not like "chunky" sauces, so I used a very good quality organic tomato sauce in place of the fresh tomatoes. Additionally, I added dried Herbes de Provence to the flour dredge as well as the sauce. I think this enhanced the provençal characteristics of this dish. A quick and lovely weeknight meal.

This recipe was a huge disappointment. I was excited when I saw the ingredients and decided to serve it at a dinner party. I followed the recipeprecisely and it turned out to be very bland. My guests did not comment one way or another but when I saw them use the salt and pepper shakers, that confirmed my suspicions.

I love this dish! It is now on regular rotation in my home. I'm sure roasting fresh tomatoes would be even better, but I'm satisfied with substituting canned roasted tomatoes to cut down on time. I also add french herbs to the flour mix.

I'm not entering a rating because I didn't follow exactly -- I used canned Muir Glen fire roasted diced tomatoes and Kalamata olives, and anchovy paste, and I didn't have basil. But this is a winner! Chicken was moist and tender and so flavorful, we were licking our fingers. It's really a keeper.

Rating: 3
Good. Used Kalamata olives instead, because I don't like black. Used anchovy paste. Put over wide egg noodles and roasted asparagus as a side. I also stuffed my chicken as suggested by another reviewer. I used pancetta and provolone.

got out of work at 6.30 and was at the grocery parking lot at 7, after knowing i had to cook for 4, when I found this recipe on my Iphone app. Got out of of the grocery with most of the ingredients at 7.35 was at home cooking at 7.55 had dinner at 8.45 and cooked brussel sprouts and rice as side dishes. It went well with a buttery chardonnay. I mashed 4 anchovies. The dish was a hit. Its now 11.45 and everyones gone but me and some of the dishes.

I really enjoyed this dish. Followed the recipe exactly. I don't think it would be as good without the fresh tomatoes. I also didn't add extra herbs as others have suggested. I don't think it is necessary and I like the very clean tastes that come through. Simple and elegant.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe as is, and it wonderful, but in the handful of times I've made it since, I've used canned, diced tomaotes in place of roasting them myself. This one step turns the recipe into an easy, quick weeknight dish. I omit the anchovy paste and use a little extra chicken broth in place of the white wine if I don't have any. I also add more olives. I don't know how many--just more! I love black olives in this dish.

Rating: 4
Family loved it. I agree with others, can the fresh tomatoes and stick with the canned fire roasted. I also agree with using herb de provence in the flour---I made my own using: fennel seeds, dried thyme, marjoram, savory and little sage, also added some lavender flowers from the garden but original herb de provence didn't use them. I just looked at my "spice Island" Italian Herb Seasoning and it pretty much is the same as I made except no lavender.

This recipe was delicious. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it and has asked for the recipe. I did make a few slight modifications as suggested by other reviewers. Instead of fresh tomatoes I had the Muir Organic Fire roasted tomatoes in my pantry and I used those. I also added a little Herbs de Provence in the flour and then also a little in the sauce. To have it ready for the dinner party I prepared it in advance and put it in a baking dish and then heated it in the oven at 325 for about 15 minutes. The chicken was tender and the sauce was flavorful. I served it with roasted potatoes, steamed broccoli and roasted asparagus. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
A scrumptious dish! I changed the recipe very slightly. I used 3 anchovies ; imported canned Italian Roma(plum) tomatoes instead of fresh, and I left out the butter. I served it with crusty french bread; boiled baby Kale; steamed rice; and avocado slices with a spritz of lemon juice . Try it! I certainly will make this again and again....

first i got whole ripe tomatoes in a can. doubled the amount of olives, doubled anchovies paste from a tube (i got it from Ralphs)doubled garlic powder (i coudnt be bothered) AND a full cup of white wine...chicken provencial is about the earthy flavours. instead of boring chicken i made chicken stuffed with boursin garlic herb cheese, spinach and than wrapped it with bacon. backed it till it was ready and than served the earthy sauce on top of that! DEf***ingliciouse! about an hour and a half to make.

really delicious. i would maybe 86 the blanching and butter for time and calories respectively but the uncomplicated ingredients make it a winner-the flavor/simplicity ratio is high. i would up the anchovies and garlic if you really want that flavor, they get a bit lost in the tomatoness

Rating: 4
I almost feel bad writing a review on this because I changed it quite a bit but it came out DELICIOUS!! My hubby and I don't like tomatoes so I didn't use those (yes I realize that was a large part of the dish but bear with me). Didn't have anchovies, so I didn't put those in. Thought I had olives and to my horror discovered I didn't, so I used canned artichoke hearts instead and it was really good! Definitely will make this again!

Rating: 4
I used the advice of another commenter and used canned fire roasted diced tomatoes. I thinks the anchovies are indispensable. Second time around I had a can of butter beans and put them in the sauce - made a great recipe even better. Serve over angel hair pasta with a nice red wine. yum

Rating: 4
Really really simple dish that seems elaborate and fancy! A great way to impress guests without a lot of time. It's also more forgiving than the recipe may suggest. I had some late dinner guests the second time I made this, so the chicken stewed a bit long in the sauce. It didn't dry out as I'd feared and was nearly as good. High recommended!

Rating: 2
The sauce is good but the chicken (which I sliced into small 1/2 inch strips) was kinda like taking your brother to the prom-- pretty boring. I think were I to make this again, I would go with diced pancetta or crumbled sausage.

Rating: 3
Wasn't sure if I should rate this as a 2 or a 4. As written, this recipe was not great. I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh, but followed all the rest of the instructions, until I tasted the sauce. Somehow, it tasted both bland and very acidic. That's when I made some modifications:I added extra crushed garlic, oregano and crushed red pepper. When it was almost completely reduced I added the butter and basil and 2 heaping teaspoons of sugar to cut the acidity. What a difference. (In the recipe's defense, I think the last few minutes of reduction would have made a big improvement in the taste even without my changes.) I served the chicken topped with the sauce and sprinkled with feta cheese with a side of angel hair and steamed spinach. My husband LOVED this.

Rating: 4
For those who have dissed this dish, I urge you to try it again. This is on the most-requested list and I tend to vary the recipe depending on what I have in the house. I typically use canned diced tomatoes with oregano, plenty of fresh basil, and chop up garlic stuffed olives. I've never use anchovies since my partner detests them and doubt the dish misses it. Serve with some angel hair and a good red wine.

Rating: 1
one fork is for OK...well, it was less than OK and I followed the recipe closely except I cooked the tomato sauce about 15 minutes before adding the sauteed chicken...even opened a tin of anchovies for that ONE little fellow I made into paste and used my own organic chicken stock...could not eat this special dinner

Rating: 2
This dish looked so good, but I was very disappointed. The sauce was just like taking a cup of canned tomatoes and spreading it over the top of the chicken. I added the garlic and the anchoy and one would never know it. I served this with heads of steamed brocolli and steamed red potatoes with butter and fresh dill. The side dishes were better then the entre. I will probably never make this again.

Rating: 3
Very good. Changes I made were to add two cans of diced tomatoes (with their juices) anchovy paste and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Sauce was great and the brininess of the olives might also be good with mussels or shrimp. WIll definitely make again.

Rating: 3
Good, I needed to cook the tomatoes a little more and maybe cook the garlic a little longer before deglazing the pan. I didn't use olives or the anchovies due to other people's dislike for those items. Next time I may add a little something else to the sauce to spice it up a bit, maybe chipotles (like another reader suggested) or some other ethnic spice depending on the cuisine we're making.

I've made this fabulous dish many times. For a change I recently added 2 canned chipolte peppers chopped and about 1 teas. adobo suace. Wow.

It's sometimes hard to make a flavorful chicken dish, but this one is superb! I followed the advice of others, used canned diced tomatoes with juices, and substituted about 2-1/2 T fish sauce for the anchovies. I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil. It does not need much salt, since the olives and fish sauce are both salty. The chicken was not cooked through after browning such a short time, so I cooked it more in the sauce while the sauce was reducing. I omitted the butter by accident and it was still so delicious!

Decidedly gourmet for a Tuesday night! I improvised a bit as other users recommended--I used fish sauce in place of the anchovy, and a can of fire roasted tomatoes (drained). Easy and wonderful for a chilly evening.

Excellent. Used canned tomatoes for convenience and just happened to have Muir Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes and used anchovy paste...convenience again. Served with steamed asparagus with shaved parm. Definitely will make again perhaps next time with some pasta. Give the sauce some time to reduce it is worth it. Also the stock I use is sodium free.

Holy Hannah this was good. I did a good job not touching the breasts, only turning them the once. The sauce was SO flavourful, even though it seemed like there was nothing to it! I used canned tomatoes, and because I didn't have any anchovies, I splashed in some thai fish sauce and some red wine that was kicking around. We ate it with some boiled potatoes and a green salad. I can't wait to make this for company!

I will definitely be making this meal again in the future.

This was very tasty. I did use canned tomatoes because I was pressed for time and I put the olives on my husband's dish at the last minute because I don't like them. I think the anchovy taste was very light and good with this dish. I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful. One change. Used small can of petite-diced tomatoes  squeezing out some of the moisture. Otherwise made as directed with kalamata olives. First time I had fresh basil, another time I did not, so I added a teaspoon of dried to the tomatoes. There is absolutely no need to add thickeners. Whisk in the butter and the sauce is just fine. I cant imagine why anyone would then bake this. The chicken is fully cooked already. I must admit I simmer it about 2 minutes in the sauce just to be sure. I try to use the TJs natural chicken breasts  they are incredibly tender and juicy. I got them first for the convenience - each breast is packaged ready for freezing. With the wrong chicken, this could be tough dish. What is also great about this dish is that you can make it with things may already have on hand. My great niece stopped over last week and I was able put together a very nice impromptu meal with garlic parsley roasted potatoes and TJs haricot vert with toasted almonds.

A very simple recipe with a delicious result. I substituted chopped canned tomatoes, pureed them slightly, added the garlic directly to the tomatoes, and then let the mixture simmer for an hour first before cooking the chicken. (Cooking the tomatoes like this really brings out there sweetness and flavor.) I then followed the recipe as stated. Next time I will try with herbs de Provence to give it an extra kick.

What an excellent recipe! I did make a few changes : a can of drained, diced tomatoes, and Herbs de Provence instead of basil. I used a Chenin Blanc from the Loire valley for the wine and it was a very good match. This was so good that we will be serving it on "Open That Bottle Night" with a white Burgudy we have been saving. I served this with noodles tossed in butter and 2 drops of black truffle oil. I almost licked the plate clean.

This is an excellent dish that I make frequently and always get rave reviews. I use diced, canned tomatoes instead of fresh. I also finish by putting the chicken in the sauce in a large covered casserole and baking it for 30-45 mins. at 350 degrees. The chicken becomes incredibly tender, moist and flavorful. A fabulous dish!

Rating: 3
I going to make this one again because the flavor was excellent. The sauce never got anything close to thickening though, and the texture would have been so much better had it done so. I will used canned dice tomatoes, and perhaps flour and water as a thickening agent or maybe tomatoe paste. I'm sure this is not a stand alone entre, spoon it over pasta.

Rating: 3
Delicious and easy! I didn't have anchovy paste, and substituted oyster sauce. I think the chicken needs to cook a little longer than recomended though especially if the meat is thick.

I made this tonight not knowing if I would like it as I'm not a big fan of olives, but it was delicious and I will definitely make again. I made as written except for using canned diced tomatos. Great recipe.

Rating: 4
This one hit all the important points after some modification: reasonably healthy, quick, few ingredients, and DELICIOUS! First, I used kalamata olives because that's what I had on hand, which I rinsed to cut back on the salt. I also used grapeseed oil which doesn't burn as easily, 1 tsp anchovy paste from a tube and 15 oz canned stewed tomatoes out of convenience. I also used chicken cutlets, which are very thin and so cook very quickly. I let the pan cool almost completely after cooking the chicken and then added more oil before the paste and garlic, since minced garlic burns very easily. Then, I replaced the wine with all broth (less sugar) and omitted the butter altogether. For everyday I would probably also skip the flour, even though it might make the sauce less thick and the chicken a little drier. I served over pasta but I think it could also be good over rice (for everyday I would use whole wheat pasta). Try it! You'll like it!

Wow - this dish was delicious. I made it without the olives and anchovy because my husband doesn't like those items, but it was still wonderful.

I'm not sure weather to rant about how traumatic of an experience I had trying to make this dish or how delicious it was despite all that went wrong.

I will just have to remember to buy a cork-screw and trust the one-flip technique beforehand.

This recipie is delicious! One of my very favorite chicken recipies ever. Just a note, though, if you're using a nice iron pan like I was - make sure you make it on medium when the recipie says medium - high or you will end up with no sauce like I did the first time. Still tasted great, though.

Normally I don't make chicken, but this recipe was actually quite good. It's not difficult to make, either.

This is a very good recipe, and it is quite easy to make. Having good quality plum tomatoes makes the dish taste best. I used anchovy paste, as I did not want to open a can of anchovies for just one fillet. It is important to boil down the sauce to give the desired consistency. The addition of butter at the end rounds out the sauce perfectly. I have already made this dish a few times, and I will certainly make it again.

Very easy and tasted very fresh and comforting. I don't like blanching tomatoes, so I used canned Italian peeled plum tomatoes, and used more olives and anchovies than the recipe calls for, because my family enjoys bold flavors. I will certainly make this again.

I don't know why some reviewers find it necessary to critique other reviewers. Get a life! It IS HELPFUL if someone has left out an ingredient such as garlic (to which my husband is allergic and that the recipe still works! Although, calling anchovies "sardines" is a little weird.

Why are people calling the anchovies in this recipe sardines? While they both stem from the herring family, the two are in fact very different.

Great, recipe. I would make it again, no doubt. I would advise this, keep the sardines (I don't like sardines whatsoever), because they add so much to the sauce. If you're skeptical, only use half.

My recipe omitted garlic (I realized I was out of garlic too late). The sauce was a little too rich to my taste. I was expecting a far lighter texture and a good emphasis on the tomato and basil flavor, but found the saltiness of the olives and anchovies overpowering.

This is so easy to make and delicious. I didn't have any olives so I left it out. It stil tasted great. I didn't have chicken breast but used drumsticks instead and simmered the chicken while the sauce thickened. I cooked some pasta, tossed some of the sauce with it and served the chicken on top. Served it with green salad. Definitely a keeper!! The whole family loved it even my kids who are 8 and 5!
