I forget remove skin from cactuses when make holiday dinner. My family say delicious, but maybe too chewy and sharp spines in mouth. Next thing, have to call ambulance to have needles remove everyone mouth. Next day, call ambulance again when it time to make needles come out other end. Christmas ruined because me stupid mistake. Make sure remove skins and needles before make so you family stay out of hospital for Christmas.

I had a bumper crop of cactus pears so I made 6 batches of this yummy sorbet with lots of experimentation. I recommend halving the amount of simple syrup and adding a splash of cranberry juice for a tarter result.

This is a fun, simple recipe--if you can find cactus pear.
