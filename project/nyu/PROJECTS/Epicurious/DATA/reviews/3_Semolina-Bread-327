This recipe did not work at all for me. There wasn't enough water in the dough, so it seized up my KitchenAid. Then, after I saved the dough with a bit of added water and hand kneading, I put it on the specified "buttered" baking sheets and into a 450 degree oven, which promptly filled the house with the smell of burnt butter, and burnt the bottom of the loaves. I had high hopes, but this recipe did not fulfill them.

This is a great recipe that is forgiving. I divide in half and make it in the food processor. I make bread, use it for pizza dough and calzones. The semolina makes a difference.

I made the biga the day before to simplify. The biga is probably enough for another one or two times. I used bread flour instead of AP flour. The dough could probably use a little more salt as mentioned in another review but I think authentic semolina bread doesn't have much salt anyway. I took the others' suggestions: used an egg wash and sesame seeds. I think this improved the taste and look. Great crusty bread.

I used my own starter that I've had for years, so I didn't have to wait to mix up the recipe. I added about 2 tablespoons of olive oil with the liquid. I think it helps to give some extra flavor. I also brushed the tops with eggwash for a nicely browned color, and sprinkled sesame seeds on top. The loaves came out beautifully, crusty outside with a soft, tasty inside.

It definitely does take time with the Biga (starter) but it turned out a nice soft crusty chewy bread. I couldn't find Semolina flour so I used all all-purpose flour instead. Had only a little sea salt left so I added kosher salt as well. The bread needed more salt than the recipe called for since the plain flour doesn't add too much of its own flavor. Also, I didn't have a baking stone but the heavy baking sheet was enough. The crust was crunchy and just right. I also sprinkled a couple of loaves with sesame seeds. Next time, I will do an egg wash since the color wasn't as bright. All in all, its definitely worth the time. Nice part of an old-fashioned, made with love italian supper.

Although this takes a little ahead-of-time prep, the bread turns out lovely and is great with pasta dishes. For the starter, I used 2 c flour and 1 c water added to the yeast mixture, and 3 c flour/3 c semolina for the bread, plus 1 Tbsp. salt as I had no sea salt. I also just used the remainder of the packet of yeast that I used for the starter. I made 2 oblong loaves and baked them for 35 min. Top the loaves with sesame seeds before baking for an authentic look!
