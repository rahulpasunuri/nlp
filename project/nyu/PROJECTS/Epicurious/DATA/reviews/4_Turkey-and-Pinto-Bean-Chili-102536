This was amazing!! I added 1 jalapeño pepper and 4 chipotle chilies in adobo to really add some kick. I didn't need to add any extra broth, as a matter of fact I only used 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth instead of 3. This is def going to be "game day" chili.

I didn't have any chocolate or bell pepper so I used a can of diced green chilies and added extra chopped fresh tomato and ground white pepper.

Really tasty and easy. To add MORE flavor: add 3 jalapenos chopped, 4T chili powder, 1T chipotle chili pepper powder (or minced chipotle chili in adobo), 2T cumin, 1 bay leaf, pinch of cinnamon. For the chili consistency that I enjoy, I used 2 1/2 lbs ground turkey, 2 cans pinto beans, 2 cups chicken broth, 1 bottle lager beer and 1T corn meal. I also enjoy chopped green onions along with cheese and sour cream as toppings. Good comfort food on a cold winter day.

This is one of my go-to chili recipes. It is hearty and flavorful. I typically add one jalepeno and chipotles in adobe because my family likes spicy chili. The red bell peppers balance the spiciness well with sweetness.

Whole family loved this! Substituted 1/2 of the ground turkey for ground pork chorizo as some reviewers suggested. Completely forgot about adding in the chocolate, didn't miss it, but will try it next time.

Delicious, but not quite special enough for 4 forks. Nothing to complain about.

Really good chili. Be careful with spices if making ahead - the heat intensifies. I agreed with other reviewers; substituting 1/2 the ground turkey for turkey sausage or chorizo is an improvement. The addition of 1 bottle of lager is great as well.

I agreed with other reviewers that this was much better with turkey sausage or chorizo and I also added some chipotle pepper in adobo and used a little mroe tomato than called for. I used 100% cacao and a little mascobado sugar since I don't have semisweet chocolate. Tiny changes, excellent chili.

This is an excellent chili! I have made it on more than several occasions. I add a bit extra chili powder to the meat right as it is cooked to give it that deep flavor and color. I also add a hot pepper such as habenero for a little more kick! I taught my teenage son to make this! The ingredients are inexpensive and it is easy to make and serves many!

Very good - I was looking for a healthier chili that my family would still eat, and this did the trick. It wasn't spicy enough for my husband, but nothing is! I did use more beer for liquid, and had to use chocolate chips.

This chili gets better the longer it reduces and its even better the next day. Made some modifications as well based on what I had on hand. 1 - used 4 tablespoons of chili powder and one tablespoon of chipotle chili powder. 2 - one green, one red bell pepper. 3 - a bottle of beer and 2.5 cups of chicken broth (the other reviewer who said the original recipe doesn't call for enough liquid is right). I used a stout but I may use a lager next time. 4 - I roasted whole cumin seed and then ground it myself in the spice grinder mainly because this is how I prefer my cumin in recipes. It has a stronger, smokier quality to it. Then I let reduce for a little over 2 hours and served with shredded cheese and sour cream. An outstanding chili recipe that's healthy and tastes better the next day.

Rating: 4
Delicious and rather spicy! Made many modifications based on user comments, and my own hunches: 1) Used olive oil instead of cooking spray. 2) Doubled amount of spices, and used 3 TBSP of chipotle chili powder in place of regular chili powder. 3) We had extra ground turkey so used 1.5 lbs. 4) Added 1/2 can of chipotle chiles with adobe. (Great suggestion!) 5) Used a can of black beans, a can of pinto beans, and a can of kidney beans. 6) Used 2/3 bottle of beer in place of chicken broth. 7) Added some decaf espresso. It turned out extremely spicy, but we like it that way.

The first time I made this I used homemade turkey broth left over from the TG turkey carcass and it was incredible. I've made it several times since and it isn't quite as flavorful with chicken broth but still a good, easy, adaptable chili recipe. I use chipotle chili powder to give it that hint of smokiness.

Rating: 4
Nice one! I used bacon drippings instead of oil and added some tomato paste, about 2T. Didn't change anything else, although the chipotles in adobo sauce are sitting on my counter still...but I think it's spicy enough without: my 9 year old may not approve if it's any spicier. Good stuff!

I love love this recipe! I have made this chili 4 times in the last month due to it's popularity among my friends and family! I did tweek the recipe a little to add a kick of spice and flavor...I took the suggestion of a previous review and added chipotle chilis in adobo sauce (adds a great smoke and spice), also added 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne, used crushed tomatoes instead of diced and added 2 more cups of broth and allowed to reduce for an extra hour!

Rating: 3
This is indeed a good starting point for a mild poultry chili. When I make this for my family, I stick close to the recipe. For my taste I use a great deal more chili (several green chilis and some habaneros) to make it spicier. Also, i find that the recipe does not call for enough liquid. I use at least two or three more cups of broth. Finally, if you want to do something special this is wonderful with dried tart cherrys added to it.

Rating: 4
The thing I love about this recipe is that it is so versatile...good base for chili but you can do so much with it depending on your mood and what is on hand in your pantry. Have made this no less than twenty times and it's never the same twice b/c I have stopped measuring the spices. Usually use 1 red and 1 green or yellow pepper. More garlic. More chili powder [probably close to 5 T]. One can each of pinto, kidney and garbanzo beans. More chocolate. Once used a adobo salsa in place of the diced tomatoes. It was smoky and amazing! Will make over and over and over again....

Excellent chili! It is a very classic chili flavor, and absolutely delicious. It isn't too spicy, so we added a little cayenne to kick it up, but the flavor was wonderful if you don't want it too spicy. One member of my household demanded I make it every week.

This is truly an exceptional recipe. I doubled the spices for the whole thing and then divided it in half and followed other reviewer's suggestions to add some ancho chile from the can. Both tasted great. The ancho chile added a smokey flavor, more depth and more heat. The other batch was good for the less spice inclined. A definite keeper. YUM! Also easy to make.

I also added the chipotles in adobo the second time I made it. Even better! I tried to keep the spice down for the kids to enjoy. I just wanted a good old-fashioned chili without all the extra stuff. This is it!

i also made half of this with two cans of beans, instead of the turkey i used two links of chorizo (for half of the recipe) which i sauteed in the pan and reserved before adding the vegetables, also i used half of a chipotle chili in adobo sauce. and it was much improved by using 100% chocolate without sugar. this is a very good chili recpie.

this is a solid recipe. really easy to make and lowfat too.a surprising amount of flavor for so few ingredients. i did add a little extra olive oil when cooking the onions and some extra spices and increased the amount of beans by one half (because I cut the recipe in half and just used 2 cans of beans rather than 1.5).

Best chili ever! I adapted it for a slow cooker and cooked on low for 6 hours. Remember to reduce the spices and use less broth if you use a slow cooker. Also, I didn't used canned beans, rather beans I had cooked myself earlier.

Rating: 3
good but it definitely needs double the cumin,oregano, and chili. i didn't bother with the chicken broth, but i did use half again the amount of tomatoes. also only half of the turkey. i did add the cinnamon but liked it better without, however, it needed a couple of canned chipotles in adobo. i don't think it's the best chili ever but it is a good one and i will make it again. my favorite is roasted corn and black bean chili from recipezaar.com, number 109702.

This is a winter staple in my home. So flavorful and comforting. I add chopped jalapeno peppers for an extra spicy kick.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought the taste and mouth-feel were awful! I usually use ground sirloin for chili so I think I was missing the added flavor of the meat and fat. I doctored the recipe by adding crumbled bacon (4 slices) with pan drippings, which helped a lot.

Rating: 4
this is the best chili I've ever had and i'm constantly getting requests to make it again. i added chipotles in adobo (as suggested by another reviewer) and it rounds out the flavors perfectly. i like it best with spicy italian chicken sausage links (sliced and cooked in the pan before the rest of the ingredients). the sausage feels more substantial and flavorful than ground chili and is still very healthy.

Rating: 4
This is the best stuff I've almost ever had. I never ever follow a recipe exactly and I add stuff until I'm satisfied. But with this I just had to nearly double the chili - and was a bit too generous with the chocolate *coughs* - and this is the tastiest thing I've had in ages. I wanted to note that I also used a sweet onion. Prior to eating I added a dollop of sour cream and some shredded cheddar. YUM! Yes, I will most definately make this again.

Per reviews I doubled spices and found this chili to be good, but can't imagine it would have much flavor had I not increased spices. I used green peppers and two cans pinto and one can white beans - pretty cool.

This has been one of my staple recipes for Chili for a very long time. It is surprisingly tasteful and mild enough for those who do not like too much spice. I always serve with fresh cilantro, sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. Don't forget the hot sauce & extra chili powder for those who like their chilli with an extra kick! Fabulous and healthy!!

My boyfriend and I made this last night with many of the recommended changes and then some--it was excellent! We actually used beef because the store was out of ground turkey. Other changes included adding a half-can of chipotles in adobo, recommended by another rater; a minced serrano pepper; mixture of black and pinto beans; about a half-cup corn; extra garlic; green peppers because store out of red bell peppers; a can of tomato paste; and finally sprinkled it with shredded "Mexican" cheese and green onions sliced thin.

Wow! What an easy, healthy, hearty meal! I was about to make the "Turkey Chili with White Beans" recipe, but I realized I only had pinto beans. I did a quick search for pinto bean chili and this one popped up. I was making the recipe for only two, so I used 1 1/2 lbs of ground turkey, and two cans of pinto beans. I used a whole handful of 60% cacao bean Ghiradelli chocolate chips, and as per everyone's advice I added a little extra seasoning. I didn't double the chili powder, and boy was I relieved, because for my tastes, 3 tbsp of chili powder is plenty. I put 4 heaping tbsp of chili powder, and the chili was tasting way too chili powderish, so I added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce. The chili powder taste was still too strong, so I added a second 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I also took a few ideas from the "Turkey Chili with White Beans" and from reviewers, and added two bay leaves, a pinch of cinnamon, and about five chipotle chilis from a can. I didn't have canned chicken broth, so I used water and chicken bouillon. I didn't have two red bell peppers, so I used orange and green bell peppers. I served it with sour cream, grated cheddar cheese, and chopped cilantro. I also made the "Easy Cornbread" recipe. While I was eating I couldn't believe my tastebuds! This healthy chili is the best I've ever tasted, and it's so easy! I've only made chili (a different recipe) one other time and my husband wasn't too impressed, but he really liked this spicy version. I froze a big container for another day, and put another container in the fridge to make chili dogs with today. It makes a lot, but I don't mind because it's so delicious.

I thought this chili was just ok. It was a little dull. I added a couple chipotle peppers & 2T ancho sauce to spice it up a bit. Next time I might add a serrano chili or 2.

Excellent way to use up the turkey leftovers from thanksgiving. Substituted shreded turkey leftovers for ground turkey. Might need to reduce the quantity of ground turkey from 2 pounds if you make the recipe as-is. I added another 2 cups of broth to get to a acceptable consistency and threw in a little extra chocolate and spice. Everyone loved the results.

Rating: 4
This is fantastic! I didn't have semi sweet chocolate, instead I used 1 teaspoon of cocoa powder and one teaspoon of white sugar. Instead of oil spray, I used 1 tablespoon of lard, and soaked my own pinto beans for 3 days. It didn't seem hot enough, so I added 3 adobe chilis from a can when boiling. I cooked it for 2 hours. I made it a 2nd time, doubled the recipe, froze some, and used it for chili cheese omelets, and chili cheese dogs. Loved it!

I've made this chili many times. I find that it's best with boneless, skinless chicken or turkey thighs, cut into cubes. I also use extra chocolate, and cut the water (or I simmer with the lid off). I've served with to guests with a green salad, made with avocado, lemon juice and olive oil dressing, and sprinkled with sun flower seeds. Corn bread is also nice. Simple, tasty meal.

Wonderful recipe! I followed almost all of the suggestions in the other reviews, and got rave reviews from my company chili cook-off! I had made this recipe before, but this time had the chance to read all the reviews, and they made a big difference. I doubled the spices, added the cinnamon someone suggested, and I used canned diced tomatoes with mild chilis. I used 2 cans of pinto beans, 1 can of black beans, and 1 can of chicken broth, and about 1/2 bottle of beer. I don't like my chili to be too spicy, and I thought this was really flavorful, but not too hot. I still think the best part of this dish is the hint of chocolate. My chili got devoured at the cookoff, so I ended up making another pot the next night for the family!

Super easy and lip-smackingly good. I found the chili to be "wet" enough as is, without having to add more liquid. I used Penzey's Chipotle powder for the chili powder and found it to be quite fiery.

My whole family really enjoyed this. I took the advice of previous viewers and added some sun dried tomato paste, a can of green chiles, and a bottle of beer. I also used pink beans, black beans and kidney beans instead of the pinto. It was very good, and I "did" use all 3 cups of the broth. Next time I'll make it spicier, since I like a little more kick to it. Could use some chipotle peppers.

Just came back on to rerate this and give it a 4 instead of a three. As good as it was when I originally made it, a couple of days later, it is only outstanding! Had to thin it out with a little chicken broth when reheating.... Thanks everyone for all the modifications. Cut the chicken broth to one can, used one can of black beans and two cans of pinto, and doubled the spices as suggested. Then I began to play. Added a small can of chopped green chilis, some sun dried tomato paste (from a tube) which gave it a richer flavor and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. My chili was thick from the get-go so I opened a bottle of beer and slowly began to add (used the whole bottle). When I reheated, I added about 3/4 cp frozen corn kernels (all I had left in a bag) which gave it a nice color and a little crunch. Served it over white rice with sour cream, grated cheddar and sliced green onions. Corn bread and a mushroom cearsar salad along with a cote du rhone wine...wow, what a meal. We were too full for dessert.

This is easy and very, very tasty. I added about 1 1/3+ the amount of dry spices, 2 green peppers and used only 1 can of chicken stock and used canned tomatoes with mild chiles.

Very, very good recipe. I have been using epicurious.com for a few years now, and this is the first time I am writing a review. I just had too. I cook on a regular basis, but never made chili before. We were having a chili cookoff at work, so I needed a recipe. There were SO may chili recipes on-line my head was spinning. Thanks to all the reviews, I decided to make this one. I definitely argree that the spices should be doubles. I also blended a small can of Chipolte chilis and added them to the dish. It made it pretty hot, but I ended up winning a award for hottest chili!! I also drained the tomatoes and only added one can of chicken stock. Came out perfect. Loved the tasted of the chocolate too. If your looking for a chili dish, look no further, this is the one.

This is the first time I made turkey chili and it was absolutely delicious and satisfying. I made it for a New Year's Eve party and everyone loved it. I added a little salt to bring out the flavor and added much more cumin, chili powder and oregano...it's very bland if you don't season it more than what is called for. I also added chopped green chilies and I cut the chicken broth to one 14oz. can. You can always add more if it's too thick. I will never make chili with beef again.....the turkey tastes great and is much more healthy. Great recipe!

I double the spices and add my own secret ingredients: cinnamon and worcestershire sauce. Cheers!

First things first, this will serve 6-8 linebackers from the Philadelphia Eagles, so expect leftovers. But what a great dish on a cold winter day (been freezing here in Baltimore). Following on the suggestions posted here, I reduced the chicken broth to one can and added a small can of tomato paste, which helped to thicken the chili. I upped the seasonings and added about 1/3 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I let it simmer for about three hours and it was excellent. The chocolate gives it a very nice smoky taste. If you have friends who love chili (or football players even), I strongly recommend this. I have seven more ounces of semi-sweet chocolate left, but I'll use them making this again.

Substitute the Chocolate for cocoa powder (a good heaping tablespoon), jack up the garlic, throw in half a can of Chipotles in adobo, double the spices and add some more peppers (anaheim, green bell, poblano...) and this recipe is delicious! Oh, and on the issue of consistency, any self repecting chili-maker knows that you must let it rest for at least a half day if not overnight. High protein and fiber, low fat and great taste (with some adjustments) Yum!

This is a great recipe. Many people have complained that it's not spicy enough or not thick enough, but this may be due to quality of spices and amount of liquid in canned diced tomatoes. I used Frontier Spices chili powder (wonderful flavor, wonderful color), Dean and de Luca oregano, Simply Organic cumin powder, and Muir Glen Organic diced tomatoes. I also used only 1 lb. of ground turkey, and 2 cans black beans, 1 can of pintos. It was thick, delicious, easy and quick: what more can you ask?

I've made several turkey chili recipes, but this was the best. I substituted black beans (2 cans), one drained & one undrained, and added only 2 cups broth. I peeled and chopped 3 large fresh tomatoes instead of canned & added 2 T. "essence" (Emeril Lagasse). Excellent!

One of the best I've ever made. Even though it's July and a little hot for chili, I had some pinto beans I had cooked up and some ground turkey I needed to use. I substituted green peppers and a square of unsweetened chocolate with a teaspoon + of sugar and added a small can of tomato paste as others had already done. Swirl some sour cream in it and it's scrumptious even in the summer (with the air on.)

As a person who seldom has found a chili he didn't like nor a chili recipe that wasn't worth the time for perusal - this chili hits the spot. Not too spicey, not too rich, not too anything; just a good solid, easy, bowl of red. I doubled the chili powder and added a few liberal shakes of ancho chile powder to compliment the chocolate.

Thought this was a very easy and tasty recipe. My husband thought it was a definite repeat. I made a couple of additions.

I usually don't like chili but thought I would give this one a try. It tasted just as good as it sounds. I did add half a can of corn kernels....not necessarily for taste but for color.

Not a bad thing, considering the left over chili was yummy.

Came out excellent, a great recipe that worked as written. I added some cooked bacon and bacon fat near the end to give it a bit richer flavor. While this took away some of the low-fat appeal of the dish, it did help. Also, I added some cinammon and doubled the onion.
