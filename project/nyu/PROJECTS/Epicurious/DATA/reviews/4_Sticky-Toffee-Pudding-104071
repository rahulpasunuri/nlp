I made this for my cousins graduation party and it was scrumptious! Everyone gobbled it up. The sauce is the best part. I will definitely make this a holiday tradition.

This is the best STP recipe I've found, exceptionally delicious and a huge hit every time.

By mistake I only used half the butter, but it was still delicious! I also used a food process to blend the dates after soaking them so that the batter would be consistent. Definitely will make again.

Sigh - can't rate this, but wanted to let others know not to make the same mistake I did. Alright, idiotic I know - but I assumed ground coffee beans (for a coffee maker) were the same thing as instant coffee granules. THEY ARE NOT - ick. Made the whole thing taste yucky and burnt and apperantly they are also carcinogenic! We did not eat it - went in the trash sadly! The rest of it looked super tasty and moist though.

Very nice version -- not as sweet as some. I made in individual portions using a silicon pan in rose shapes. The top held the caramel sauce well because it had ridges. Although another time I think I'd serve on a pool of sauce and just sprinkle the tops with icing sugar for a prettier presentation. Whipped cream isn't really necessary. I might try with vanilla ice cream another time instead of the cream. They were simple to make.

excellent recipe. my goal this winter was to master sticky toffee pudding and i was thrilled to discover that it could not be easier. you can make self-rising flour by adding 1.5 tspns of baking powder and 1/2 tspn of salt per each cup of flour. online cooks differed as to whether you should replace 2 teaspoons of the flour with the baking powder and salt, or if it should be added to make a dry measure of one cup plus 2 teaspoons (hope that makes sense). I decided to replace it (so it was 1 cup minus 2 teaspoons flour, then added to the soda and salt) - and it came out perfectly. the caramel sauce was amazing and mine did not come out thin, as other reviewers' did.

I've made STP from different recipes over the years and this is definitely one of the best to date. The best was given to me by two lovely "Miss Marple" type sisters. Like the reviewer from Newport Beach, I pick up great British ingredients from Harrod's when we're in London - their Food Hall is astonishing and always a must visit location. If STP is made for company, I make the sauce; otherwise, it's rich enough on its own to just serve with vanilla ice cream. The Brits do know desserts!

I just made this today, and followed the recipe exactly. It was wonderful. It was moist and flavorful. Just beautiful. All of my guests raved about it. I will definitely make this again.

I make a version of this from the BBC Good Food website that calls for treacle. It's fabulous! You might want to have a look. It's author is Angela Nilson.

I made this for the first time yesterday. It was out of this world! I only added one more thing...I ground up Skorrs bars in the food processor and sprinkled a tablespoon of this over the plated dessert when serving. A Skorrs Bar is a toffee bar covered in chocolate. Delicious...

I made this for Christmas Dinner dessert and served it with the warm caramel sauce and real whipped cream It was a hit! I was so sad that it was all gone and nothing was left for breakfast the next morning. The addition of the coffee granules give a nice depth.

Wonderful cake! I thought the sauce was a little thin, but it thickened as it cooled. It went amazingly well over the cake. This is a very sweet, very rich dessert. For those that don't know a "pudding" in England and Ireland is actually a cake.

This is delicious. It is light, but every English recipe I've ever seen also calls for self rising flour. If there were no baking powder in it, you'd have a brick. This is supposed to be a sponge pudding, and they are made with self rising. The "sticky" part is from the toffee and dates. The only curiosity is the baking soda: every other recipe I've seen adds the baking soda to the boiling water, to help break down the dates. It's pretty useless added cold. I skipped the coffee and added vanilla.

Love the recipe. Here's my take on a few of the comments (plus some of my own) 1. I prefer the self-rising flour version, as written. I do not agree the dish should be "dense;" rather, rich on the one hand and light on the other -- just don't overbake. The combination of the heavy sauce and the light pudding are one of the pleasures of this dish. Having eaten a lot of STP at restaurants, this is most like it. 2. Agree that poking holes in the pudding before adding the caramel is a great idea. 3. If you use this caramel sauce, add to the recipe extra vanilla and stir in 2 tablespoons of molasses for the perfect flavor. I made the sauce, but omitted the butter -- like the consistency without it. 4. Mejool dates were sweeter and richer than California dates, but any will do in a pinch. 5. I made this in 12 individual ramekins so each guest could have their own cake, served with a side of chantilly cream. 6. I set out a finger bowl filled with fleur de sel and suggested people put 3-6 grains on their pudding -- those who did thought it was sublime. 7. For visual flourish, I used a condiment squeeze bottle filled with chocolate, to make a circular design in the caramel.

Everyone loved this dessert, but it did sink a little being at altitude. When i made it again, i adjusted for altitude and this time, it really sank?! What's up? Still delicious but any suggestions or thoughts from anyone in high altitude places?

I made this just the way the recipe calls. It turned out perfectly moist and scrumptious. I will definitely add this to my repertoire. I'm not easily impressed and this one impressed even me! You will not regret it.

Had STP in Scotland for the first time 2 years ago in a little inn, and was blown away...FANTASTIC! Found a frozen STP in Costco (from the English Pudding Company) which tasted just the same as the one in Scotland, but then I couldn't buy it anymore. I made this recipe and it came out PERFECTLY! Moist and sweet and heavenly, especially with freshly whipped cream. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

I agree with Chicago completely - regular flour gives this recipe a much better consistency.

Needs more cooking time, but I'd make it again.

Really tasty. I definitely suggest adding Drambuie to the whipped cream, as it is served at Nicholson's Tavern and Pub in Cincinnati. Their version of STP may be the best dessert I have ever tasted.

Sooo delicious. I make this often for taking dessert to friends, and it is easy enough to prepare and everybody loves it! I just grease the bottom of the pan and don't line it, as I don't buy parchment paper. It keeps well in the fridge and is delicious warmed up leftover! A FANTASTIC dessert.

My family has requested this many times since I first made it when the recipe first was published. In fact, I haven't been able to try new recipes because they always want me to make the Sticky Toffee Pudding! It is really easy to make and absolutely scrumptious. I have no doubt we will be having it for years to come.

This is perhaps my husband's favourite dessert. Use purchased caramel sauce to speed things along.

This was an excellent recipe. The self-rising flour was not a problem for me. However, I did make a change as follows. Once the cake finished cooking, I poked holes all over and poured 1/2 the sauce all over it. Broiled for a min or 2. Served with additional sauce and ice cream. Yum!

My recipe is from Green's in London. It makes 30 servings, I haven't perfected sizing it down yet. It is made with coffee and with Lyle's Black Treakel. I have yet to find that product here only the Golden Syrup (not the same thing). I bought mine at Harrod's while in London.

This is a fantastic recipe. After having had this dish in restaurants in England, I am of the opinion that the "sticky" in the name comes from the addition of the topping which is served already well soaked into the warm "pudding".

I agree with the cook from Chicago that there must be a mistake on the self-rising flour. The recipe as is definitely renders a cake-like consistency...I would definitely try it again with regular flour--it is very tasty as is, but really it's not sticky! The caramel sauce is delicious and makes a great topping for ice cream just on its own.

Everytime I make this, everyone asks for the recipe. It is the most sinfully rich dish! It always surprises people when I tell them there are dates in it.

There has to be a mistake regarding the self-rising flour. It completely changed the texture. It is supposed to be dense and moist and the self-rising flour made it more cake-like. I will definitely make it again, but I will use all purpose flour.
