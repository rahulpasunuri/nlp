This was very good. I added onions sauteed with mushrooms. Next time I will also add celery. I added a bit of thyme, parsley, season salt, garlic powder and lemon pepper.

This was a huge hit last Thanksgiving and I've been preparing it in some form since then. Many of my guests unfortunately would not eat quinoa otherwise so I told them it was risotto. They did not know it was anything else. A great way to sneak in quinoa to those who may not want to eat it. Also great if you are not eating pasta. I use bottled clam juice and it saves time.

This is a strong recipe based on a proven technique. If you consider the recipe as more of an educational exercise, you start to understand its strength. The weakest part of the recipe is the clam juice/broth, but other broths can be substituted, including seafood broth and vegetable broth. Each changes the flavor. The mushroom/onion is a time-honored addition, and one can also add things like fresh/dried peas, asparagus, carrot, red bell pepper, toasted pine nuts, etc. to add color and texture. We added fresh peas and pine nuts and served it to a special guest with cajun-fried catfish. It was a huge hit & one that we'll make again.

one more thing - as others said, I subbed the clam broth for vegetable broth seasoned with rosemary and bay. I also realized too late that I didn't have cooking wine so I used beef broth instead. Not sure what difference it made in the end but the dish was fantastic.

Delicious!!! This was an easy recipe but was time intensive since it required 45-minutes of constant stirring. I know this is a no-no with risotto but I did end up putting it in a covered casserole dish in a warm oven so I could finish the rest of my meal and it turned out perfectly. I was concerned about having slightly too much liquid after I poured the mushroom and shrimp back in but it cooked down after just a few minutes of simmering. I read the recipe a few times before preparing but somehow missed that I wasn't cooking the shrimp entirely when they get thrown into the oil/butter mixture early on so they were slightly overcooked from having to simmer at the end of the recipe. I cut the recipe in half because I was not serving as a main course. I served alongside sauteed spinach and mushrooms (grabbed some extra when shopping for the risotto) and grilled salmon rubbed in rosemary, basil and sea salt. It made a really nice meal that was pretty easy to put together.

I didn't care for the texture, and the quinoa absorbed the clam juicegiving it a strange flavor. Edible, but not my favorite.

Takes a bit of time, but this is lovely.

I wasn't too crazy about the texture, which was worse the next day.

This was delicious. I used the recipe as more of a guide to make a vegan version. I used vegetable broth simmered with bay and rosemary for the liquid and substituted oil for butter throughout. I didn't have the Spanish spices so just let the flavors of the mushrooms, the quinoa and the broth shine through. Next time I'll definitely seek out aji amarillo to add some extra spice.

Holy deliciousness batman! This was soooo good. Now, I know people hate it when people say "I changed..." but I did - hey - a recipe is a guide. I used veggie broth. I only used portobellos, I added chopped artichoke hearts to the mushroom saute. I added a tsp of tomato paste to the garlic and onion while it was cooking. I didn't use achiote, or aji amarillo and I didn't put the cream in. I think that regardless of what you do, quinoa risotto is absolutely awesome, and that is why this dish is so amazing.

I successfully halved the recipe and created a vegetarian version using homemade veggie broth, omitting the shrimp, and increasing the amount of mushrooms slightly. I added some finely sliced sundried tomato, but it had a negligible effect. The risotto was delicious & smooth even before adding the cream and parmesan, and you could easily decrease the amount of oil & butter used to saute the mushrooms & onions by 1/3 if you want a leaner version.

Delicious! The aji amarillo can be found at most Latin grocers and is worth the hunt. I can't imagine the dish without that kick. The mushrooms' flavor was a little lost in all the spices. I might only go for the cremini next time. Definitely a time-consuming affair. My quinoa still wasn't done after 35 min so I added another cup of liquid, closed the lid and turned off the fire to let it steam for about 10 minutes. That did the trick.

Wow, loved this! Lots of work so plan for a couple hours over a hot stove. I used the shortcut clam broth (bottled clam juice with added water) and couldn't find aji amarillo so just skipped it. Even without it, the flavor is wonderfully deep and rich and the pop of the quinoa in your mouth is delightful (much less gluey and pastey than rice rissoto). Very good, very worth the effort.
