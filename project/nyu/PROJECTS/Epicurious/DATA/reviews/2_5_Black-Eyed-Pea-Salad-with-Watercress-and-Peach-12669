This was OK, but definitely not impressive. My boyfriend didn't finish his, and I had a hard time with mine, because its quite dry. I took the rest to work the next day, though and it was much better after the flavors had ahd time to blend.

This was quick and easy to make, and it satisfied my (usually carnivorous) husband enough to pass as dinner. I had to use canned peaches and baby spinach as my market didn't have any decent fresh peaches or watercress, but the salad still had great flavor.
