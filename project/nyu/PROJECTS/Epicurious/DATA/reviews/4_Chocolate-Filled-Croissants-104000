I get so aggravated looking for good recipes sometimes--this is an excellent recipe for pains au chocolat, but to go to the extremes of ordering specialty chocolate to make them with? A great deal of overkill if you ask me--I've made these several times and the first I used plain semi-sweet Hershey's chocolate morsels and they came out heavenly and have done so since.

Delicious. Tasted like the pains au chocolat I had in France. I made some with the bittersweet chocolate batons and some with white chocolate. They were amazing.

Hi This is my first time attempting this recipe. What does "spritz the oven" mean?

Worth all the effort! These were delicious and a hit on Christmas morning. I used Lindt chocolate as batons were not available.

Very good....left my review on the croissant dough recipe

Since I double the croissant dough recipe to keep croissants in the freezer, I used a half portion to make these. They are wicked, easily the best pains chocolats I've tasted since I left Montreal. Didn't have batons, but an 8-oz bar of Ghirardelli bittersweet is scored to fit perfectly. I used 2 (one stick/pain), and will get proper batons for the next time. Warning: finished product is highly addictive; increase exercise accordingly.

A ton of work for an o.k. result- my croissants didn't come out flaky- more doughy- they still tasted good- You can use bakers chocolate cut up instead of the sticks.

This is a wonderful recipe!! Don't be intimidated by it either. It's much easier than it looks. I didn't have time to get the batons, so I just cut some Dove dark chocolate promises in half. They worked beautifully. YUM!

I'd love to make these for my daughter's first grade class when she's to take snack in next, but it's in the middle of a very busy week for me. Since there is no way I can make them from scratch between now and then, and since I don't want to pay $2.50 per child for the only decent pains au chocolat to be bought in Nashville, TN, I'm wondering about a compromise: Has anyone ever tried making these with Pepperidge Farm puff pastry sheets?

Any luck with locating a store to buy the batons?

This is the most wonderful recipe- I have made it a few times and absolutely love it- it is very easy to make-the first time I made it, I was a bit intimidated as I thought It would be impossible to do well- I think that a few illustrations would have made the process much easier to understand for a newbie, but that aside- it's an amazing recipe.

To the cook in Maine - chocolate batons (also called pain au chocolat sticks) are available from the King Arthur flour website and catalog. They are excellent.

I loved the results of this recipe - as did my family. I plan to make them for Christmas morning - they are very involved but well worth the time! Any suggestions on where I can find the "Chocolate batons" - I have not been successful in any of my internet searches or with any local sources.

What "tent idea" is Phyllis talking about?

The pain au chocolat was Excellent! We had food day in my French class, and this was the big hit. It does take quite some time to make, but it's well worth it. Also, when baking the dough barely rose, that could have to do with the fact that I let the bread sit in the refrigerator a few hours longer than recommended. But overall, the bread was excellent, and I would definately make it again.

This "dish" was very time consuming, as I thought, but very good. I used one half of the croissant dough to make regular croissants and the other one half for these chocolate croissants. They were worth the effort but be prepared to spend one day or a long evening with the dough.

I loved the size and ratio of bread to chocolate for these. I didn't order the batons, instead, I cut up a 3.5 oz bar of Michel Cluizel 72% Cacao Amer chocolate. Bitter, bitter sweet chocolate, and two squares long and half a square wide pieces seemed to work really well. I think any excellent bar of good chocolate could work, but the Cluizel serendipitously seemed the exact right size. It made for an incredibly rich experience with a cup of excellent coffee. I wonder what it would be like with the dark chocolate with orange peel. The tent idea is just too cool for words.
