I'm an American living in Spain. Let me tell you that when fall rolls around, the idea of cornbread sounds amazing. So I decided to embark on the creation and found this recipe. My English boyfriend had not yet tried cornbread so I saw the opportunity to impress and show our great food to him. Well... this recipe was a great disappointment to my surprise! Beautiful to look at, tempting as all hell, but drier than the Sahara! I gave my dog a nibble and he coughed for about 5 minutes! I ended up putting them out in the plaza for the local drunks to munch on. Somehow I feel that was cruel, but then again, it can satisfy hunger. Anyways, this recipe should be removed. Waste of money and time.

These turned out really nice, but I added more buttermilk than specified in the recipe. I used stoneground cornflour and was worried they'd turn out really hard if I did not put in enough liquid. Not sure how much I ended up adding, but the final mixture was quite liquid - similar to the one you'd make for crepes.

Not great - stone ground is not the way to go, as these just were gritty. I added extra liquid based on extra reviews, so avoided the dryness problem. However, you couldn't even taste the cheddar at all. Don't bother with these.

I've loved all things Epicurious for years but this is the first time I'm reviewing as these were just terrible. As one reviewer said, nice to look at but very (!!!!!) dry. Like hard to swallow dry. That said, I did not make it to go with a chili but to be a gluten-free bread at a work Thanksgiving potluck. I was embarrased to bring them. The butter is awesome and helps but few people slather butter on things these days. I have many leftover and will try cubing & drying for stuffing. If you're after a YUMMY savory cornbread, choose this instead http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cheddar-Buttermilk-Corn-Bread-107468?mbid=ipapp

I made this for Thanksgiving and they were a total disaster! I chopped the Jalapenos and added them to the batter and I also topped the muffins with a this slice of jalapenos. They turned out looking great but were super dry (and I added a half cup broth on the suggestions of other reviews that they were dry). I found the stone ground corn meal to add a grittiness to the muffins. I would never make this again : (

This was not my favorite =[ I shared with 3 guests and none of them especially cared for it either. If you like dry cornbread you may like it...

I am 7 weeks pregnant and have been craving really random things. Lately it's been cheddar jalapeno corn muffins, and then there they were in my inbox! They really hit the spot. I minced a jalapeno and put it in the batter, and cut the salt in half since everyone else seemed to think they were too salty. They hit the spot!

I could tell by the batter that these guys would be on the dry side, particularly as I dry fried fresh corn-off-the-cob in Cumin and Coriander seed. To remedy this I added a 1/4 cup of rich corn stock I made during the summer. Perfect. Great with chili.

Well, I never! What kind of person puts sugar in cornbread? I'm clutching my pearls at the apostasy of it all. Can't wait to try it both ways and see for myself.

I would NEVER add sugar, and cornbread is meant to be dry to eat with the juices that it sops up. It's great with chili and beef stew. My jalapeno loving husband loves these!

I have made these three times now - for two separate Thanksgiving celebrations and also for a potluck. I like to think of these divine little muffins as a classic Southern cornbread dressed to impress. As the description states, this a savory recipe and not meant to be sweet. I omitted the salt (the cheese does the trick!) and used canned corn. Fantastic! I cannot wait to make again with a hearty chile.

I agree with the previous comments. I'm more familiar with sweet cornbreads and mexican style cornbread pudding. I read the recipe several times looking to see if I missed an ingredient,sweetening, and next time I will add some. I have an intolerance to peppers so I added some crystalized ginger and poppyseed for the kick-liked that

This was a nice recipe for corn bread but I would leave out the extra salt next time, all the added cheese makes the muffins salty enough. Next time I will add a little more corn for sweetness, maybe a touch of honey and possibly add some of the jalapeno into the mix itself.

Quick and easy and quite delicious. Jalapenos are not to easy to find here so I sprinkled some Cayenne Pepper on top before the cheese.Also used canned corn as suggested. In the file to make and make again. Probably more than enough butter in recipe without adding more with Jalapenos anyway.

These were pretty good and very quick and easy to make. The outside of these muffins crisp up really nicely. Only changes I made to the recipe were omitting the corn and instead of using the jalapeno butter, I finally chopped the jalapeno and added it into the batter. Don't skip the top cheese, and next time I would probably add a bit more than called for. These went great with chili!

My husband made these to go with the "Broiled Chicken, Romaine & Tomato Bruschetta" recipe & they were good. A little dry but good. I think next time use creamed corn?
