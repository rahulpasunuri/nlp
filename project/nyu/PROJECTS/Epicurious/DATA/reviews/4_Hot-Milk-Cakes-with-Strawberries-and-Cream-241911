These little cakes are amazing! They are not too sweet and the texture is light and not spongy. This will be my "go-to" shortcake recipe from now on. Good enough for company!

Yummy....easy, very moist. Added Kahlua to my berries. Added 1.5 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt to my regular flour. Light and moist, since my husband doesn't like biscuits with strawberries.

I made this and baked in an 8x8 glass dish like another reviewer but it didn't turn out at all - didn't rise. Not sure what I did wrong - I used regular flour but added baking powder like others.

This is a foolproof recipe that is always well received. I have shared this with many guests. If I am making this for a party I add 1 tablespoon of calvados or single malt whiskey really adds a kick.

Great little cakes. I made them in a hot air balloon mold, which always makes cakes fun! I also ended up having to use some whole wheat flour because I ran out of all-purpose, but it worked out just fine. I might have added some orange extract or cardamom for some extra spice, but that's just me. Very delicious!

This was an excellent substitute for a traditional strawberry shortcake easter dessert. Delicious, moist, with an old fashioned taste. Very easy to make.

Wow, what a delicious, light dessert. The cake itself isn't very heavily flavored which I liked; it meshed nicely with the strawberries and let the subtle spicing really shine through. Changes: I used just two large eggs instead of extra large, and it seemed to turn out fine. Self rising flower was subbed for 1.5tsp of baking powder. I also sauteed the strawberries lightly with some cinnamon and orange peel, which pushed it over the top.

Very simple and delicious. Cakes come out very moist.I used a large muffin pan and filled about 9 cups with the batter. Didn't have self rising flour so I added 1 and 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt to the flour and mixed that together first. Will try the almond extract and amaretto next time like other reviewers - that sounds wonderful.

Since our strawberry season is Feb. thru July, I'm always looking for a great "shortcake" recipe. I did substitute 1/2 tsp. almond extract for the vanilla in the cake and I also substituted 1 Tbsp. Amaretti for the vanilla in the whipped cream. I think almond is a wonderful compliment to strawberries. Will keep this one!

This is a delightful straberry "shortacke" recipe although I made a few changes just because of personal preference. I used 1/2 tsp. almond extract instead of the vanilla in the cake. I also added 1 Tbsp. Amaretti to the whipped cream since almond is a wonderful compliment to strawberries.

I made this in a 9x9 glass pan and it is delightful. It reminds me of Jewish Marble Sponge Cake. Excellent with the berries and home- made cream! This is a keeper!!!

Really good. I didn't have any extra-large eggs, so I read the reviews in hopes that someone else had to substitute large eggs, and yes! There was the answer. Thanks to the reviewer who helped me out.

So good. I was tempted to use cool whip, but I was so glad I did the fresh whipped cream. It was the perfect touch. My teenage son practically licked the bowl!

This recipe is truly a delectable dessert! The marinated strawberries, the vanilla infused whipping cream & the supper moist, dense cake all make for a dessert worthy to be enjoyed!!! This one we will make again.

Extremely easy and very good. I made these for my kids three times last week. They can be in the oven within a few minutes with very minimal clean- up. The third time I made them as cupcakes--even quicker. I also used regular flour and 1 1/2 t baking powder. I will make these many, many times, I am sure.

This was quick and delicious! I did not use extra-large eggs, but used 2 large and one extra yolk. I also did not have self-rising flour, so added 1 1/2 teas. baking powder and 1/2 teas. salt. Worked beautifully!
