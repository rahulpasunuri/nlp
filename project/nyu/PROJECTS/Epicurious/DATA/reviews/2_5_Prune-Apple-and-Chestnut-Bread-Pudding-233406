not sure how this earned 2 1/2 forks when the only reviewer gave it a one...hmmm.

This recipe was a huge disappointment, especially considering the time and resources involved. It was overly mushy and fatty; the flavor was average at best, and the bacon overwhelmed the other flavors. I would only make this again after drastically altering the recipe.
