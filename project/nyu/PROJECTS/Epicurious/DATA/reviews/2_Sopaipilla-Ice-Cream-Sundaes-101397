Very tasty, but also very time consuming. Fun when you have a lot of spare time, and good for entertaining.

Looking for a made from scratch recipe for sopaipilla, not a fast-food substitue using tortillas

What I don't get about this recipe is why not use real sopaipillas... They're incredibly simple and quick to make, and their texture is much more pleasing than a fried tortilla. Other than that, not bad.
