Amazing! Use Romano cheese if you can't find ricotta salata. But go easy - romano (esp imported) is strong.

Agree with other reviewers - elegant, simple, delicious. Made it for thanksgiving; most people wanted to pass up the salad for the other food, but ended up tasting it, loving it, and then having seconds. Didn't get ricotta salata so used peeled parmasean, which worked very well but I would still like to try it with the ricotta salata next time. And I'll definitely be making it again.

I made this on the fly for myself and a friend for lunch and he was drinking the dressing out of the bowl when we were finished! However, I did add slices of very juicy (and sweet) oranges to the salad - a lovely addition! The flavors worked really well, especially with the lemony-citrus dressing. I, as well, added salt and a little pepper to the dressing and used ricotta salata instead of pecorino. We're doing it again this weekend for a friend's going away dinner for a big Italian feast. I'm sure it will be a hit!

So good. So easy. Comes off as a salad that required a lot of work despite being SO SIMPLE. Enjoy!

As suggested by other reviewers, I added a tsp of dijon to the dressing and added pine nuts toasted with sea salt to the salad. The salad was positively devoured.

I made this to along with a quiche for Easter Brunch. It was perfect. So simple but so delicious. I added pine nuts to the salad and salt and pepper to the vinagrette. I'm making it for dinner this week as well and will add some thin cut up asparagus.

I adore this simple salad-it is my new go-to favorite. I add salt and/or a little dijon mustard to the dressing and lots of black pepper.

This salad is divine. It's quick, easy, and nutritious. I tried to use the jarred shallots in water the second time I made it. BIG MISTAKE! It's not worth the two minutes it takes to chop on shallot. Also, if you have a gourmet grocery, like Bristol Farms & Dean and Deluca, or a local farmers market in your area where you can get fresh ricotta rather than the mass produced pre-packaged ricotta, it is worth its weight in gold. It elevates the salad from good to AMAZING!

A refreshing, zesty salad that is as delicious with quesadillas on a movie night or with roasted leg of lamb at Easter. I used the pecorino Romano, but am eager to try it with the ricotta salata or Manchego.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it with less arugula (one bunch), but added baby spinach. The combination of flavors, esp the ricotta salata, is wonderfully refreshing. My guests loved it.

Hate to be a spoilsport, but I don't understand all the fanfare about this recipe, honestly. I always love arugula, but beyond that, I think this salad is sort of ho hum.

Great salad and easy to make. I used a spring mix and ricotta salata. Great dressing!

I hate to be a bore (since this recipe received such high praise from everyone)...I thought it was OK, but I think it's not for everyone. I love arugula and fennel, but now I've tried 2 salads with this combination of ingredients and I just don't think they marry that well. My favorite arugula salad is Arugula, Pear, and Stilton salad on this site - I've converted confirmed lifetime iceberg lettuce-eaters to arugula with that salad!

This is a terrific salad and very easy to prepare. I added toasted pecans for something crunchy. It gave rave reviews.

This is my new favorite salad. I love it! The arugula and fennel and romano combine to make the most flavorful salad. And it's so easy, yet is perfect for a fancy dinner.

This is definitely a winner -- particularly w/ the cheese (used pecorino romano). My only thought is to use slightly less olive oil or slightly more lemon juice -- whatever you prefer. Also, would highly recommend using baby arugula, or else a mix with other leaves, unless you're serving to a true arugula-loving crowd.

This is a light, refreshing and wonderful salad for when you are serving a heavy meal. This was my Thanksgiving salad this year and it received raves all around the table (my first Thanksgiving). Thanks for helping, epicurious :)

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner as a first course last year and everyone screamed to have it again this year. Having lost the recipe (of course!), I was thrilled to find it in this website. It is perfect for entertaining or for any other occasion.

As the other reviews have said, an outstanding salad. I make it often, sometimes mixing in mustard greens, frisee, etc. - whatever the garden has in excess. And I substitute Calomondin (like small very sour oranges) juice or Key Lime juice for the lemon juice ... so fresh!!

This was so fabulous! I prepped everything separately, to take to a dinner party. I assembled the salad right before we sat down, and just re-wisked the dressing.

Paparazzi Restaurant has a salad similar to this that I love and I have been searching for a recipe. This salad is excellent. Go generous with the cheese, and throw in some salt and pepper. You'll love it!

Truly an exceptional dish. I am amazed by how well the flavors work together. Even though I'm a sworn fennel fan, I was worried that week 2 of my fennel frenzy might weary my taste buds-- not with this recipe! Although the salad looks frighteningly healthful, it tastes absolutely extraordinary. I have to note that I was forced to make an unwelcome substitution: not being able to find bunched arugula, I used a combination of spinach and watercress. I suspect the arugula would add a better flavor, but I won't know that as long as I'm cooking in Pittsburgh. The one minor suggestion I would make is to be generous with the ricotta salata, which has a wonderful flavor that I'm sure to add to other salads now that I know about it.

This was so tasty.... The cheese and fennel were and excellent combination. Everyone raved over this one... I will surly make it again.

Fast, easy and delicious! My husband is not a big lemon fan and he didn't think this was too lemony. I have to admit that I really didn't measure -- I think I used more shallots than called for, one lemon, and a good splash of good olive oil. Since the arugula didn't look good, I substituted baby spinach. Refreshing and excellent.

I had never tasted ricotta salata and was very pleasantly surprised -it's very different and very yummy. It's made with sheep's milk and has an the slight flavor of lamb. Very nice with the dressing. The salad was very good - I've made it twice so far. However, I thought the dressing was a bit too "lemony", so the second time, I substituted the lemon juice with a 12 year old balsamic vinegar, and thought it much nicer with the ricotta salata.

Used pecorino romano and a sprinkling of ground pepper. Simple, elegant and refreshing. Used only 2 T. oil and emulsion was fine.

I served this salad for Valentine's Day along with Lobster tails and it was fantastic. My husband, who hates salads, loved this one and said he could eat it every day! The dressing is fantastic too. Don't substitute for the Ricotta Salata if at all possible...it's superb.

This is a fabulous salad! I served it first with the Short Ribs Provencal and it made for a perfect salad to serve after a rich meat entree. I rate it a 4. Enjoy.

Wow. This salad is now a permanent fixture in my repetoire - it goes well with just about any main course. And it's perfect on its own as a light lunch. Definitely a keeper, and so simple to make!
