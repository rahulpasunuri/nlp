This was just okay. The texture was weird, not like a real pudding. The flavor was better before I mixed the gelatin mixture into the mango mixture.

Amazing! My husband was amazed by the amount of flavor in just one cup! Substituted nonfat vanilla yogurt for sour cream and strawberries for raspberries. Chilled for 2.5 hours - just fine. Delicious, and easy to make!

This dessert is quick and uncomplicated. A great alternative to ice cream. I had superb results using canned Alfonso mangoes and low fat sour cream. I will make this dessert again soon!

Wonderful! Have made it twice, once with fresh mangoes, once with Alfonso puree (canned). With the canned puree, I cut the sugar by half. Took this to a party and it was devoured, once people asked what the "orange stuff" was. Used low-fat sour cream, with no loss of taste.

Great dessert. I actually used a tin of Indian Alfonso mango puree which was really flavourful. I served the pudding in wine glasses adding a little whipping cream and cardamom. Everyone loved it.

This was intensely flavorful and refreshing. I used fat-free sour cream with great results. I wondered if anyone has tried pureeing the mango and straining the puree before including with the other ingredients as I could feel the fibrous quality of the pulp. However, overall it was still a delicious dessert that my dinner guests loved.

Very nice. Make sure you use good mangoes and not those with alot of pith.

Excellent and quick! I used canned Indian mangoes. Turned out almost like a souffle. Cannot wait to try this with real Indian mangoes, that will make it super!

Very light and refreshing! Served with fresh blueberries and the ginger spice cookies also from this site! The crystallized ginger in the cookies made a nice accompaniment to the mangoes. Will do again. My guests enjoyed it also!

Great, fresh tasting dessert. Easy to make, great presentation in glass custard cups. Added a sprig of fresh mint as garnish. Next time I will double the recipe at least. My guests loved it and my family wants more.

I followed recipe but couldn't help substituting the sour cream for plain yogert, whole milk for thicker soy milk and sugar for 1/4 cup honey. Set up fine, tasted fresh and very smooth. I used another fresh mango cut into small chunks for topping. I will double recipe next time.

This dessert is "incredible"!! I don't easily give a recipe a four fork. I used overly ripe Thai Mangos with yellow skins. I followed the recipe and ended up with the smoothest, freshest tasting dessert that I have experienced in a long time. The greatest part was the ease of putting the ingredients together. I have no idea what happened to the previous reviewers recipe, but don't pass up on making this wonderful dessert. It is soooo good.

More like mango jell-o than pudding - yuck.

Turned out great, one of the best pudding recipes I've tried.
