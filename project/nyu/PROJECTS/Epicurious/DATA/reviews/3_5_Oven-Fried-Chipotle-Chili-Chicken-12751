Very good, particularly given how easy it was. I used boneless, skinless breasts, cooked about 15 minutes on each side at 425 (they were quite thick), and three peppers instead of two. Hubby loved it.

My bf and I love this recipe. We make it every 2-3 weeks. We increase the chipotles and add the sauce they come in to the mayonnaise as well. We also use panko instead of breadcrumbs and that really makes the difference. The best part about this recipe (to me, anyway) is the spicy crispies that fall off. We sprinkle the panko/mayonnaise bits that are leftover in the 'breading bowl' along the side of the chicken pieces to creat more of the crispies. Mix those crispies w/ sides of corn and stuffing while you eat...the best!

This recipe was a big hit with my family. I used canned chipotle sauce (which isn't as hot as the whole chilies). Personally, I would like the heat that the chilies bring, but my kids wouldn't like it. So, the sauce seems to be just right. I marinated 24 hours. My husband ate the chicken cold in his lunch the next day and said it was really good.

Love this recipe! As a brand-new mom, cooking is a rare thing. I actually entertained for dinner with this recipe it is that easy. This time around, I forgot the bread-crumb coating, so I literally sprinkled bread crumbs on the chicken halfway through cooking. It was still great. Very easy, big hit with guests, and really enjoyable.

We love chilis in adobo sauce and are always looking for more recipes to use them - this was great. Will try with yogurt next time instead of mayo

Delicious, and so easy. I cut the chicken into bites and served as an appetizer. They disappeared immediately.

I just didn't enjoy it. The recipe was very easy, but the flavor was just so-so.

I cheated even more - used a whole chicken cut-up, 1/2 mayo 1/2 yogurt and several tablespoons of chipotle chili poweder. Turned out veddy, veddy good!

My college son's favorite meal. With the Mexican Corn Risotto. I've made it so often I just eyeball the amount of chiles in adobo that I use and I always marinate overnight. The best!

I used only large trimmed chicken thighs and substituted PANKO for the bread crumbs; returning it to the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes allowing the panko to adhere. Definitely use more Chipotle chili and marinate overnight.

A standard in our house. I generally use boneless chicken breasts which I score before marinating. Leftovers make excellent sandwiches.

I used boneless skinless breasts, upped the amount of chipotles (by 1 1/2 - 2 times), and used some of the adobo sause in with mayo. This was tasty, but so hot, we were unable to finish our portions. Next time, I will cut the chicken breasts up smaller, or maybe use boneless skinless thighs.

Major disappointment! With all the great reviews, this sounded like a fab quick-and-easy weeknight supper for my fire-eating crew. The 'fire' was there (only because I upped the chipotle considerably), but the flavor was sadly lacking. My SIL's Shake 'n Bake has more. Yech!

This was fabulous! A few tweaks: I tripled the chiles in the recipe, used a few tablespoons of the adobo sauce out of the can, and used less mayo. 2 cups of Panko instead of the fresh bread crumbs for the crunch factor. It's lovely with steamed sweet potatoes. Yummmm.

Nice crunch to bread crumb coating. I agree with others that more chipotle chili gives it more flavor and spice. I used skinned chicken pieces. With breasts there's the perennial problem of the nice coating not getting through to the inside. I would slash them in advance or even use the breast meat as kebobs with the coating, so that the chipotle-bread crumb flavor would be present throughout. Also doubled chipotles as suggested by others. I agree. By the way, chipotle chiles in adobo from a can freeze just fine. If you have too many left after cooking this dish, put them into a jar for and freeze for the next time.

This recipe was really good, so easy & fast. Used skinless/boneless chicken breast & thighs, seasoned w/a mixture like BAM, used 3 chipotles & panko. Made extra of the chipotle/mayo for sandwiches tonight, would be great on hamburgers too. Have already passed this recipe on to others.

This was a real treat. I followed a couple of suggestions from other reviews. I doubled the Chipotles, and used Japanese panko (for obvious reasons) vice the bread crumbs. It was a rave hit with my wife and our friends. Nice, lite crunch.

Delish! Used thighs and they turned out so moist and tender. Very easy. Used two more peppers for added zing. Has become one of our favorite dishes for weekday casual or weekend company.

Very good. But you MUST TAKE OFF THE SKIN, because chicken fat is VERY bad for you. You won't miss it in most recipes. Very easy and use all the chili it calls for. I used more cayenne. Good stuff.

very good recipe! Not as spicy as I expected but easily corrected by using more peppers. Will definately make again

An amazingly easy & delicious recipe full of spice & heat. I used chicken tenders, Japanese Panko & a added a bit of oregano & a dash of Tabasco. It came out great, even though I prepared it in an exhausted state & didn't feel like cooking!

The only change I made was to substitute chicken thighs for the legs and wings...otherwise, no substitute needed. This is one of the best chicken recipes I have ever tried. Very tasty and a big hit with my guests from California! This is a keeper!

Wonderful recipe,I make it all the time. Fresh or japanese bread crumbs make a difference, I also found skinning the chicken gets the flavor into the meat and not just into the skin. I like very spicy food and have found that even though this is not that hot the flavor is worth making it for.

Yummy!!! I used Chicken breasts only and marinated them over night. It came out nice and spicy, I made half the recipe, but used two chipolte chillies. I served it with Mexican Confetti Rice and refired beans, my boyfriend loved it!

This was sooo good! Only 1 complaint! I'll use an extra chipotle next time. Don't know where the heat went, but the chicken (bone-in thighs & legs) were just juicy on the inside & crusty on the outside. Also used panko crumbs. Not a crumb left to scrape away!

I used crushed totilla chips as the coating and it was great!!

I'm a big fan of chipotles and this recipe is down my alley. Ten cooks can make a recipe ten different ways, but this one is hard to mess up. Very spicy, tasty, and I'll make it again.

It was easy and delicious and tasty and good cold or hot and I'd say more but I'm drooling all over my keyboard.

One of _the_ most incredible chicken dishes ever. The smokey adobo and chipotle combine to make a wonderfully spiced treat. Add more chilis if you want to kick it up a few notches. Never leftovers!

I was disappointed in this recipe, especially after reading the reviews. The chicken was just OK, nothing special. I've used other recipes for oven fried chicken that were much better.

I departed from the recipe but it was still very good. I purchased bread crumbs, used boneless chicken breasts (next time I'll do the chicken as directed), and substituted plain yogurt for the mayo. I added a little olive oil to the marinade to give it some fat. I liked it because it's easy! (I would also add more chipotles.)

This is a moist, well seasoned, and crispy chicken recipe. The second time I made it, I added more chipotle(about 1/2 Tbls. more), let the chicken sit about 30 min. before baking and wow that kicked it up nicely! It's great with black beans and mexican rice or with a mexican caesar's salad and tortillas.

Agree that more chilies is a good idea - but then I like spicy food. The longer you leave it in the mayo/chipotle coating before cooking, the better. Nice and easy. The hardest part for me was finding the canned chilies.

Rating: 3
The first time I prepared this chicken, I did not have enough time to allow it to sit for 1 to 24 hours, so I baked it after a half hour. I reserved some to make the next day. While the first batch was good, there was very little hint of the chipotle. Only enough to warm my lips. The second batch made after sitting for 24 hours was much spicier. Still only a warming spiciness, not what I would consider hot. Next time I would use more chilis.

Super easy and very tasty! For once my husband did not use hot sauce on his meat (-: I used 2 whole skinless, bonless breasts and did 10 min per side at 425F. Came out perfect! This will be a regular in our house from now on! Thank you Gourmet (-:
