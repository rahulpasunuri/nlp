Simple and delicious. I added to food processor for a whirl after cooking to soften texture.

Tasty (if you like liver), very simple. Cheap too! Might make for my next dinner party.

Yuk! I was hoping this would make me change my mind about liver, but once again, I didn't like it.

Wonderful recipe. Two changes only per my brothers insructions (He worked in a French Bistro for years). I put the livers in the food processor to chop them and after cooking I put the mixture into a fine mesh strainer and forced it through with a spoon (a bit tedious but worth it). The reason for doing this is that sometimes a small stone can become lodged in the chickens liver from feeding in the barnyard and you don't want tot bite down on that. The flavor was wonderful. We actually had this as part of a cheese course that included fois gras with black truffle and this recipe held its own next to that much more expensive offering.

I made this for my Mom,as we had an abundance of sage in our garden.She raved about it and keeps requesting that I make it again. It was rather easy and extremely inexpensive.
