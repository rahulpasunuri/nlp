I like to make the whole recipe from scratch most of the time, but when I read reviews about the blandness of this sauce, I just purchased szechuan sauce from whole foods and used it instead over the asparagus and broccoli, and rice. It was good.

Like this recipe very much with some added spice and liquid to make more of a tasty sauce. To do so, increase sauce and broth ingredients a bit, plus, add some William-Sonoma Kung Pao sauce. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes to taste at the end. Serve with soy sauce and Thai sweet chili sweet sauce on the side. Dresses it up for palates that prefer reasonable zing in their Oriental dishes.

i agree that this is a little bland as written, but you've definitely got something to work with. i use hot (spicy) sesame oil to cook with and then at the end i'll mix in a few more dashes of the hot sesame oil, some crushed red pepper, a few sprinkles of soy sauce, a couple shakes of fish sauce, and a drizzle of chili sauce. i dunno the exact quantities but it comes out GREAT.

My daughter Tina & I made this while I visited her in San Francisco. It was raining and she didn't have asparagus, so she substituted by adding julienned carrots, onions & green peppers. She also added 3 more garlic cloves before sauteing the chicken, plus she grated ginger and added sesame seeds in the last minute or two. I had seconds!

Quick and easy and pretty healthy meal. I doubled the sauce & garlic and added some chopped ginger to the sauce. Nice.

Awesome weeknight dinner. Didnt take too long, but tasted like it took longer! I added a bit more oyster sauce for flavor.

Great weeknight dinner. I doubled the sauce ingredients and garlic and the consistency was perfect. I added a few red pepper flakes to spice it up a little - I'm not sure it needed it.

Doubled the recipe, added cayenne pepper for some zip - very good and quick. The chicken was very tender, also added corn starch to thicken sauce - would definitely make again.

This recipe was great and easy. I added more veggies (water cress, green peppers and pea pods) and added a thai chili pepper for a bit more spice. Also made great left overs!

I substituted beef sirloin and cleaned out my refrigerator of the bits and pieces of fresh veggies that I had. To the oil I added several drops of "Chef Chow's" hot and spicey oil. Very nice blend of flavors! This recipe lends itself to anything that you have on hand!

Easy to make, healthy, and tasty. Great with asian noodles. Try to use low-sodium sauces, or they'll overwhelm the overall dish.

This was a great dish. Flavorful and a great taste everyone can love. Quick and the veggies are perfectly crisp. Other reviewers are adding ginger, but I think I would not and keep the recipe as written. Very satisfying!

I thought this recipe was really delicious,although I did add a little more ginger & garlic.It is light& I don't think the flavors are bland,rather they are subtle more like Cantonese. My children loved it,& my husband & I like the fact that without the salt & sodium of traditional stir-fry, we were'nt bloated the next day. Highly recommend it.

It was good but not great. I served it with rice and I enjoyed it, but my husband did not eat that much, and my kids just picked out the veggies. They usually love chicken. I guess it was just to strong and new a flavor for them. I was disappointed more in the response I got from my family than in the dish itself. Like I said, I enjoyed it but wouldn't make it again -- if I'm the only one who likes it.

Based on other reviews, I spiced up the recipe by adding red pepper flakes, grated ginger and black bean paste. I made more sauce (more stock and wine) and thickened with a little cornstarch. Didn't have broccoli so added sliced red peppers. Stirred in green onions at the end (didn't cook with the chicken,I thought they'd get slimy) and topped with sesame seeds. Yum. I think the oyster sauce and hoisin give a great depth of flavor, and I love black bean paste as a "secret ingredient" in asian dishes.

Whenever my kids eat what I cook for dinner, as they did with this disch, it's a keeper. I did add more garlic.

I agree this dish needs a little somethin' spicy at the end, we added red pepper flakes and some sesame seeds and it was great. We'd make it again with less chicken more veggies

A good dish, quick and easy. I agree that the dish lacks pizzazz -- I ended up adding soy sauce at the table.

Excellent dish. I really loved the flavor and the crispness of the veggies!

It was quick and easy to make, but it lacked pizzazz. A good base recipe to which you could add more garlic, spicy chili oil, more veggies...

Tonight will be the third time I've made this recipe - fast, easy & delish! For my husband and me, I use the full recipe - just a little less of the chicken, & he gobbles it up. I've used boneless thighs as well as breast - whatever I have.
