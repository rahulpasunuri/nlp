These cookies weren't lemony enough. If I made them again I would add lemon extract to solve that problem. Also, I had a hard time working with the dough. Make sure you shape the dough exactly the way you will slice it, as once it's been in the fridge it doesn't manipulate easily. I tried to slice it as thin as possible, but it wasn't easy, and kept breaking, so thicker cookies were the only way I could make to work. The first time I made the filling I had some weird pectin and put in the wrong amounts (boring story, don't ask) and when it came out gritty I thought it was the pectin. I bought normal pectin and re-made it, but it was also gritty, so I guess it's the blueberries? I'm not sure. But once it was in the cookies you couldn't feel the grittiness. My husband said it reads as sugar, which was fine with him, but it bugged me. In any case, I now have a lot of blueberry jam and I'm considering whether it's worth it to make more cookies to use up the jam and try the lemon extract idea.

Excellent cookie. I made the recipe exactly as written (both the cookie recipe and the jam recipe). The cookie is excellent on its own with sugar on top. It does not need to be a sandwich cookie and it doesn't need the jam. I made my cookies much thinner than 1/4 inch. 1/4 inch is way too thick for a sandwich cookie. I don't think the jam recipe is anything special. It is not very sweet (because of using the pectin). As others have said, buy some blueberry jam. The suggestion for lemon curd is also an excellent one. If you like lemon, you will LOVE these cookies.

The cookies were WONDERFUL. I used Blueberry Jam from Uttersdelights.com. My husband thought they were too sweet, but everyone else (I took them to a bar-b-q) loved them. I would also serve the cookies without the jam. Perhaps with blueberry ice cream

These cookies look lovely and are just delicious! I used this recipe for the jam and it worked out perfectly.

I love, love these cookies!!They are delicious and so pretty with the sparkling sugar. Instead of making the jam, I use store bought blueberry jam and lemon curd. It tastes equally good with the lemon.

These are fabulous! The only thing is that you need to significantly reduce the amount of jam sandwiched between the cookies-way too much suggested here. Also, I used the jam recipe in the Certo package-not the one listed here. I don't know how this recipe works out.
