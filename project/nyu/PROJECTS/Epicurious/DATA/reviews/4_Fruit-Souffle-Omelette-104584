Delicious! It can be a bit time consuming, but the result is well worth it!

If you double the ingredients double the time baked

I like making a savory version of this recipe as well, omit all the sugar, zest, vanilla etc - just whip whites and yolks separately, combine, mounding higher on the sides, then bake for 10 min in 350 degree oven, add fillings such as mushrooms, garlic, zucchini, brie etc - thinking about a bechamel sauce next time...

This is excellent! Made it with half the sugar and half the butter and it was still fantastic. Will be making it again soon!

In response to the last review, when I make this, the batter comes up about 2 to 3 inches above the sides of the pan. However, the egg whites make the batter stiff, so it does not drip and there are no problems. you still probably need a slightly bigger pan than what you are currently using if the fruits were soupy, as that probably means it didn't cook all the way through. it should be very puffed up like a souffle when you remove it from the oven, but yes, it will fall immediately, and especially so when you invert it, as the fruits will crush all that puffed up hot air. however, it will still be very airy and cake-y compared to a normal omelet, and the fruits should not be soupy.

Advice, please? The egg mixture didn't look as though it was going to all fit in the 7" omelette pan, especially with the fruit in the bottom taking up half the space, as well. So I slid the fruit from the omelette pan into a wok and placed the egg mix on top. It didn't cook properly -- didn't puff much, and fell immediately upon turning out. Flat, and the fruit side looked soupy. Do you just pile all the egg mix into the 7" pan, letting it stick way up above the sides? It doesn't drip onto the oven floor? It cooks through in 10 minutes? (My 7" pan is that width at the top; the bottom is narrower, probably 6". It's actually a crepe pan, I think.) Thanks for whatever help may be forthcoming! This sounds so good, but wasn't edible on this first attempt.

I've made this a few times with different fruits and it's always delicious, beautiful, and liked by many different people. Some of the fruits do stick to the pan, so you have to put them back in their places in the omelette once inverting.

This was SOOOOO delicious! I added al little extra sugar to the mix and it turned out fantastic! It's a Saturday brunch keeper!

This is great, the extra work is worth it. I experimented the second time i made it, cut out the sugar and making it with onions, mushrooms and pancetta. I did end up whipping a little sugar into the yolks (about a teaspoon) because they weren't getting fluffly enough, then whipped in a dash of salt, some pepper, dried basil and oregano. It puffed up nicely and tasted great!

FYI, "stiff peaks" means that if you dip the mixer into the eggs whites and then pull it out, the whites will stand up in a little peak. If the whites just ooze back down flat, then they are not stiff enough yet.

I wasn't sure what "stiff peaks" meant so i just beat the egg whites until they became bubbly. also, instead of lemon zest, i used grated orange zest. the result was still delicious.

Terrific! A great choice for a special breakfast

Very easy to make and delicious!! Worth the effort and washing all the utensils after whipping the egg white/yolks. I tried the recipe with apples and banana, works well. Will make it again.

I just made this for my bed and breakfast guests and asked them how they liked it. They said, "It's very light and quite delicious." So, it's a keeper. I used nectarines and they turned a little brown so I think I'll use a different fruit next time.

Absolutely delicious! A wonderful sweet/savory combination. I would definately make this again!
