I made this as is except Greek yoghurt instead of sour cream and liked the flavour. Would definitely try some of the review suggestions but the basic recipe is good.

Four forks with the following changes: 8 oz ham instead of 2 oz ham. I substituted chicken broth for water and onion for scallions. Added: 2 Tbs fresh basil, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1 stalk celery chopped, 1/2 tsp ground mustard, 1/2 C dried shitake mushrooms (reconstituted). Served with 2 Tbs of home made Ranch dressing instead of plain sour cream. My husband loved this soup. Lots of flavor. Definitely a keeper for the end of our Minnesota tomato season.

I followed the instructions pretty closely and the soup was too bitter. Then I did various things to try and soften it - add sour cream, some sugar, etc. It was semi-ok but on each bite I had the sensation that was eating vomit. I had to dump it out. I could not imagine serving it to someone and I would never make this again.

We really liked the recipe. I chopped up a small cooked chorizo sausage and sauteed with it the chopped onion, garlic and bay . I then followed the recipe leaving out the pepper. Very tasty. I will make it again. I served with sliced cucumber so no sour cream needed.

Looking at the recipe, it looks rather bland, so I spiced it up, and now it actually tastes pretty good! What I did (firstly, I didn't measure, eh, too much effort) I put a goodly amount of ham dried shitake mushrooms bouillon cube a bunch of herbs and spices (peppercorns, mustard seed, celery seed, Basil, lawry's seasoned salt, and oregeno) I used garlic and onions instead of shallots I cooked it til the tomatoes stopped tasting so gross And I put a dollop of mayonnaise in my bow with the soupy stew.

This was a complete waste of time. The taste was really blah. We didn't eat any more than a spoonful or two. Another one of the CSA members tried it and said the same thing.

A great way to utilize the last of the tomatoes. I used what I had on hand--pancetta and yellow onions--in place of the ham and the scallions. I also used 2 cups broth & 1 cup of water. Added in a can of cannelloni beans, drained and rinsed, to make it more of a meal. No sour cream but I stirred in a bit of half & half when I served it.

EXCELLENT! I made this soup in early November using the last of the green tomatoes from our garden. I was surprised at how great it tasted and how easy it was to make. I liked the test batch so much that I made it again the next day. I used the Black Forest ham and both times the soup was flavorful, especially considering it is made from GREEN tomatoes. I highly recommend this soup.

I adapted the recipe slightly, using non-smoked bacon chunks (in France we call these 'lardons'). When the soup was ready I added a tin of white beans. The result was fabulous - tangy and satisfying. I could have eaten the whole lot, but that would have been greedy!

Okay, so I gave this 4 forks but added some of my own ingredients. Not to say that this was not a great soup, but for me, it was a great start to a great soup. My husband and I are a all-courses-in-one-soup kind of soup lovers. So, we wanted it a little more hearty - the kind that will get you full after one small bowl. I did add a small sweet onion, chopped, 1 lb. of chicken thigh, chopped and browned with bacon (instead of the ham), and about 1 lb. of potato. At the end, I cut some of the acidity with 1 tsp. organic sugar and 1/4 c. lowfat milk, negated the sour cream as a garnish all together. Oh, and the scallions I used as garnish instead, along with just a sprinkle of cheddar cheese. It was AAAmazing and I plan on making it again Sunday for one of our Football night soups with the neighbors!

Mmmmm. . .a BLT in a bowl. This soup is a healthier alternative to the sandwich, for sure. My husband loved it, and I'll make it again with my almost-ripe yellow tomatoes next season.

Pretty good, the tomatoes I had were old and not too acidic. The pork was the dominant flavor of the soup. It was heartier than I expected and I think it could do with some noodles.

The soup was tasty but a bit boring so I added frozen mixed vegetables, and frozen okra mix with celery in it. I also used some leftover ham but it needed more meat. My husband thought it wasn't soupy enough. He was looking for the green tomato soup his Mom used to make, but he can't remember the recipe, but thought it needed just a little sugar to cut the tartness. I made this same soup last season when our garden was harvested. I won't make this one again though.

OK. Not great, better that frying

My tomatoes were sort of half green half pink but I think for me that made the soup. Really green tomatoes are so incredibly sour and in my opinion only good for green tomato pies. This soup was lovely and tart with out puckering me up. I used boar's head bacon instead of the black forest ham. The smokiness gave the whole soup a wonderful flavor. Try this with a grilled sandwich and it's delicious! I will make it every year when I have end of season tomatoes.

I'm a vegetarian, my husband is still working on it, so I made a couple of substitutions/additions that turned out FABULOUS and both of us love this soup! Instead of meat I used baked tofu, cubed it, added 2 tbsps of BBQ sauce (for the smoky flavor) and sauteed it at the same time with the shallots and garlic. I used veggie broth instead of chicken, added a good dash of hot sauce to the soup (I wanted jalapenos but didn't have any on hand), and at the end, when it was almost done I put in a small bunch of chopped parsley. YUM! It was even better the second day.

I had some heirloom tomatoes on my rooftop that just wouldn't ripen, so I thought this recipe would be a good way to use them up. Wasn't the best soup I ever made, but it was quite tasty. Pureed almost all the tomatoes for a thicker texture and garnished it with the fried pancetta and the reserved tomato chunks. Not bad for unripe vegetables! (Well, fruits I guess.)

Very tasty. Not a dish I'd make constantly but a great way to use an excess of green tomatoes.

I was really skeptical but this was fabulous. I used turkey habanero sausage and it was terrific. Easy, too. Now I will pick all of my tomatoes before they ripen.

Like many others who have tried this recipe, I also made some substitutions, using what I already had in my kitchen. First, I substituted bacon for ham. I used some thick-cliced, pretty high-quality bacon ($8/pound), saved the grease and substituted it for the olive oil. I also substitued low-sodium chick stock for all the water. I did finish with the suggested sour cream, but the next time I will use some creme fresh, since it mixes more evenly into the soup, and because it cuts the acidity a bit more. I agree with some of the other posts here, it could use a bit more pepper--definately red (cayenne) or black pepper. Finally for those smaller, harder green tomatoes, you will need to lengthen the cooking time a bit.

I used pancetta and increased broth as recommended by other reviewers. Really delicious.

A much better way to use up those green tomatoes than deep-frying them. Very tasty. It made other foods with it taste strange - do not recommend drinking a glass of milk with it. Substituted bacon for the ham.

Easy and tasty. I used bacon instead of ham, a mix of onions and shallots, and followed the first reviewer's suggestion of 2 cups broth and 1 cup water. Added 2 tablespoons chopped hot pepper. Pureed the whole batch and got a nice texture.

Doubled the recipe and pureed about 1/4 of the tomatoes to thicken up the soup - worked great (you can still use only 2 tbsp of oil). The Black Forest ham makes this a little salty, so watch the seasoning. Served it with a crusty baguette and super creamy cheese - a great pairing. A nice use of those leftover green tomatoes.

A really good dish! The green tomatoes add a nice tartness to the soup. We modified in the follwing ways: used 2C chicken stop, 1C water, added a splash of madeira, substituted onion for scallions (it's what we had on hand) and added 1 fresh cayenne pepper to the mix. We just used ham we had on hand- deli sandwhich meat. And we cooked that in bacon fat instead of oil. We had the soup like this the first night, and then the second night we augmented with macaroni for more substance. Green tomato soup is a great idea!
