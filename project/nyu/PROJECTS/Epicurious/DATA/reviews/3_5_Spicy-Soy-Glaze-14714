This was o.k. I might try it again but baste the top of the fish so it poaches with flavor.

I just made this to dress up grilled arctic char - it will definitely become a staple. So yummy, nice and spicy. I kept everything the same except for the shallots which I did not have, so I used onions. There were still some small pieces of onion and apricot (from the jam) so I pulverized it with my immersion blender, making it a bit thicker without overly-reducing it. It's a very nice weeknight recipe - not difficult at all (I think someone else said it was very involved, but I disagree).

Love this, but seriously, it's a decent amount of effort. Make sure you're going to use it more than once.

lovely caramel-y flavour. I initially forgot to add in the apricot jam and thought it tasted a little too sharp but the jam rounded off the flavour wonderfully. For those who want to tone down the salt content, i used half light soy and half dark soy. Dark soy sauce is less salty and more caramel-y in flavour.

Delicious, but too salty for my family. Actually reversed the garlic and ginger amounts by accident ... and will now do always. Will try to vary the soy sauce to water ratio in hopes of keeping much of the flavor while loosing the salt stick effect.

This is great over any kind of white fish! It makes anything seem fancy!

one of the handful of best recipes we've tried on this site (and we've tried many). made it w/ salmon and the veggies as described in the red snapper recipe. couldn't imagine a better asian style sauce for salmon -- veggies were great also. doubled the sauce recipe and now can't wait to use leftover tonight as dipping sauce w/ dumplings. if anything, the sauce was maybe just a touch too sweet, but not much. low carb folks could easily cut down sweet ingredients w/o sacrificing flavor. don't skimp on the lime zest and make sure to garnish plate w/ a nice lime wedge.

I tried this glaze today. I gave it two forks, though a friend of mine who has seemingly become the beneficiary of all my recipe experiments absolutely raved about it. I think I may have added a bit too much of the lime zest and lime juice. After multiple taste tests, I was convinced that the citrus undertone was strong. I will certainly make this again but I will be mindful of the zest and lime juice the next time around. As another reviewer suggested, I used chili paste and it was just fine.

I have made this glaze more times than I can count. I make it in double batches as it keeps well and is great to have on hand for an instant "big flavor" meal. It is fabulous with grilled salmon, shrimp or pork tenderloin.

I love this recipe! The shallots really make it shine. It is also delicious served over stir-fried kohlrabi and other robust vegetables.

I really enjoyed this. However, it came about on a day when I was preparing a simple lunch for myself with some things that were lying about. I started with a very ripe plum that had been sitting in my fruit bowl. I cut it and spooned out the ripe insides, then set it aside. I then heated some oil and browned a few cloves of garlic. I added to this the soy sauce, sugar, and red pepper, and plum, and then squeezed the lime into it. Better to add the sugar last, so you can do it to taste. I glazed a shrimp, carrot, and shallot medley over a bed of white rice. It was pretty good.

Using the white of scallions instead of shallots and Chinese chile paste instead of red pepper, I made this sauce and then added it to a hot wok with pan-roasted green beans and tossed for thirty seconds--wonderful sidedish to an Asian meal. I think it might be too strong for fish, though I'd make it again with the green beans.
