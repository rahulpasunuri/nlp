I had never liked turkey before due to its dryness. Under my friend's request, I decided to give it a try. I turn to my gourmet cook friend for suggestion. This turkey was the hit. I gave such an impression to my family as well as my friends. They can't stop praising my cooking. I was well pleased too. I almost followed the recipe to the T. I took one suggestion from others. Roasting turkey at 500F for half an hour. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

After reading multiple reviews about how to make the best turkey for Thanksgiving, I learned a little bit. Strategies I read included a)brine it b) oil the skin c) cook it at 500* for 30 minutes, then turn down the heat, and d) cook it breast down for the first 30-60 minutes. I did all 4 and this is what I discovered. If you oil the bird and have your oven on at 500*, the oil (at least I'm assuming) will burn and your oven will have oil splattered all over it. After 10 minutes of cooking at 500*, your oven will be full of smoke and when you open your oven, your house will be full of smoke. Now, I don't know if the same problem would have happened or not if I didn't oil the bird. When reading reviews, it did not appear to be a concern, so I'm assuming the smoke was from the oil. With that said, after the 10 minutes, I turned down the heat to 375ish, then flipped the bird breast side up. The skin was dark, but the turkey was very moist. I did not do the broth, glaze, or gravy as listed here, but the turkey did turn out very moist and I received many compliments. I hope this helps

I tried this turkey this year and was not disappointed. The turkey was moist and delicious and had the most beautiful dark, crunchy skin. I agree with many of the other reviewers as I had to put foil over the turkey very early on (about 2 hours in) to keep it from getting too brown. It was deeply deeply brown when done but not burned. I loved the gravy, although I did simmer the giblets in with the broth because I didn't want to waste them! Also, per Alton Brown I added an onion, apples and a cinnamon stick to the cavity. I will be making this again next year if I have the opportunity!

Our regular turkey chef was unable to attend Thanksgiving this year, giving me the opportunity to make my first-ever turkey. I can honestly say that there is going to be some tension in the family next year, because this recipe was so beyond any turkey anyone had ever had that I might have become the turkey chef for life. I was intimidated about making a turkey but this was easy -- no adjustments or anything fancy necessary. It probably helped that I bought a fresh turkey from a local farm!

It turned a regular Broad Breasted White into something succulent and spectacular. I roasted it at a high temp (510) breast side up for 30 mins with the cavity held wide open with a fork. Then stuffed (hot/cooked stuffing), flipped, and lowered to 350, basting every 30 mins. It was fantastic. I want to try this with a slow, low roasting (225).

I found this recipe two years ago and have used it every time. I have NEVER had a turkey so moist, and I'm just an alright cook! Soooo worth the prep work! The skin does get dark quickly though so I put the foil on earlier than they suggest. Also, I've tried the gravy that goes with it twice, and I think the recipe calls for maybe a little too much brandy. It's a good flavor though.

I have been using this recipe since 2005. Everyone loves it. It is so easy to make and the taste is amazing. I loosely cover the turkey with foil for the first 2 hours to save the color. I start watching the thermometer as I put in the glaze. Sometimes it is ready early. Enjoy!!

If "orgasmic" could ever be applied to a turkey recipe, this would be it. Decadent. Succulent. Dewy. Have tried about 6 other brining recipes, but the cider adds a delicate sweetness that's indescribable.

Loved it. 24hrs in the brine; 12 hrs air chilled. stuffed with apples, onions and sage (cooked a different dressing on the side). I was nervous about putting the bird in dry without any fat on the skin, but I followed the recipe and the skin was gorgeous and the meat moist and flavorful. 15.5lbs took 4hrs at 325 and the first 75 minutes was breast- side down. I did use the sage broth to deglaze and added beurre manie to thicken, but skipped the cream and brandy. I will totally do this again.

Best turkey of many I have cooked! One word of caution--keep a loose covering of foil over it the whole time. The apple cider glaze darkens up way too fast. Keep it covered to keep it golden.

Yesterday was the first time the mothers let me do Thanksgiving. I followed this recipe with a few small tweaks like adding a small bit of thyme to the brine and not using calvados in the gravy and it came out awesome! Both my mother and mother in law said they are going to brine their turkeys for now because it was so moist and it enhanced the birds flavored really nicely!

It is the first time I cook a turkey. My mom has made it always. I did it yesrterday for Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious.I did not do the gravy, I used the turkey juices itself. And have another gravy also. I can say that it is not only the first time cooking a turkey, it is also thefirst juicy turkey I have eaten!!!!!!! I have never dealt or understand with the persons that change the recipes with thousand ingredients, and then do a review. It seems to me awfull. In this case I am going to say a change, only because I live in Ecuator and did not find cider, and someone could turn in a similar situation. I Used 3 cups of juice of apple with 1 cup of apple vinegar for the brine. And for the glaze, 3 cups of apple juice with 1/2 of apple vinegar. Everything else was followed exactly, as always should be when one looks for a recipe. I recommend this recipe it is fabulous

THE best turkey ever! Glaze became a bit dark toward the end but, wow, what flavor and juiciness. I did not make the broth for gravy but toward the end I added 2 cups of cider to the drippings, then strained the dripping, skimmed the fat them and thickened that for gravy.

Love this recipe. We brine in a cooler with a triple plastic lining More work but so worth the effort. We have been able to find a source for fresh turkey that has not been frozen. It is a wonderful combination.

I have made this recipe twice now for Thanksgiving parties of 10 or more. I used a large (25 lb) bird both times. The birds were so big I had to use a cooler lined with bags to brine them. This worked well and I could leave them outside in the cold Montana fall weather. Both times the recipe was a hit and much to my dismay, there are never leftovers for the next day. Along with the great flavor, brining the turkey in this manner gives it an amazing deep brown color when it is finished. I found it very important to continue basting the turkey throughout the process and added small amounts of stock and cider vinegar to the bottom of the pot to keep the turkey moist. It has an mazing sweet and savory flavor with nice hints of apple. Definitely can recommend this one!

Ive always brine my turkeys, this recipe was my best turkey ever! I started the brine 3 days before then I stuffed it with sage, apple and cornbread stuffing. Roasted for 4 1/2 hours. I glazed it every half an hour. AMAZING!

Rating: 4
My turkey was fresh from a local farm and 23 lbs. I think the brining helps it cook a bit quicker, as well as lending great flavor to the drippings. Very moist meat that also made a very flavorful broth for soup and who knows what else when we get the urge for turkey again. I have brined before in a honey brine, but this is now my blue ribbon and anticipate trying it for other recipes.

This recipe is awesome! I followed it exactly and we have NO LEFTOVERS. I would like to say that the reason for this is that I made creative meals the rest of the week with the leftover turkey, but that is not the case. My family literally "gobbled" up the rest directly from the refrigerator.

This was the first time I brined a turkey and it turned out amazing. A few notes since i found instructions like "overnight" extremely vague: a) i brined for only 8 hours because my turkey was 10.44 pounds --- b) i air dried in the fridge for 4 hours --- c) i initially halved the brine amount for my 10.44 turkey but that did not cover it (in a bag in a bucket) so i had to make another 1/4 of the brine - in the future i will make all the brine but not use it all --- d) i made my glaze before putting the turkey in the oven so it would be totally room temp when i was ready for it - as i was dealing with a smaller bird with a shorter cooking time, i started glazing after 45 minutes --- e) 325 is a better temp for a smaller bird in my humble opinion --- f) i added cups of chicken broth and water to the roasting pan every now and then --- g) that part about putting on the lowest rack possible - yeah thats important - mine starting browning on wing tips too soon so i moved it to the lowest point asap --- this turned out tender and juicy and delicious - my only criticism is that the recipe did not account for various bird sizes and was vague on brining time (seriously, is overnight 8 hours or 10 hours or 12 hours??) causing us to do a lot of research before cooking -

This was my first brined turkey and it turned out beautifully. Gorgeous right out of the oven! I only brined it overnight, next time I'll do the two day. I made a version of the stuffing without the apples and parsnips which wouldn't have gone over with teenaged boys. The gravy was somewhat time consuming and tasted rather salty even though I rinsed the turkey well and did not use salted butter in the glaze. I also made this on the plain side because of the kids. This is THE best turkey I've ever had!

I made this for Thanksgiving (my second time hosting and my second turkey ever) and I think that this recipe turned out beautifully. I accidentally didn't add the 4 quarts of water to the brine because I didn't have enough room in the pot, but the turkey wasn't overly salted and it came out crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. I was particularly pleased with the flavors the gravy added, but I actually made two versions of it - one with the brandy and cream and the other without. I personally liked the gravy without better. I am definitely going to keep this recipe around and use it again. It's easy, it's forgiving and it's delicious!!

Best brined turkey I've ever made or eaten. Glaze gives a gorgeous finish. Watch the time; my 22 pound bird cooked in 4 hours with a convection oven and reduced temperature. I'm usually not a stuffing fan, but this one is fabulous; used apple sausage and halved the recipe.

Excellent brining recipe. I've been making turkey using this brine, or very close to it, for years now. Always results in a beautiful, tender and flavorful bird. I've made the brine exactly as the recipe states, and also changed it from cider to orange juice - both received rave reviews. I do brine the turkey for two days or more. And here a tip: don't fuss with trying to wrestle a twenty pound bird into a pot or baggie. I use a cooler: rest the bird on the bottom, pour cooled brine over it and add between 15 and 20 pounds of ice. Works beautifully without taking up your entire refrigerator!

Did this recipe last year and it was a huge hit, people were taking photos of the bird while it was resting before I carved it. I had an encore request to do the same bird for this year, I hesitated because I like to change the turkey each year so that it does not get boring, but people insisted on this one. S0 two 20 lb. birds are in the brine right now, this is not a lot of work so give it a try and then listen to the compliments on Thanksgiving Day.

An addendum- I agree with NicoleMarie regarding temperature. It was getting too brown by about 90 minutes so I dropped the temp to 300 and covered the breast. I brushed on the glaze about every 30 minutes in the last 2 hours. Looked beautiful!

I made this 2 years ago but did not follow the whole recipe. It was good. But this year I really followed it from start to finish (OK, except for the stuffing- made my own) and it was FANTASTIC! This is going to become my default turkey recipe. The cider glaze was easy and incredible. The turkey came out a burnished mahogany and the brining kept it moist throughout. I brined a 19 lb turkey about 24 hours. The gravy was terrific too.

This was a huge hit this year in our hosue at thanksgiving. The turkey was so tender it just fell off the bone! A few modifications: I did not refrigerate the turkey an add'l night after brining. Could've accounted for teperature difficulty. Skin got to crispy on 350 after 30 minutes so I reduced the oven temp to 300 and covered. Great turkey recipe, will definitely make this again next year.

This is the first time I have brined a turkey and it was fantastic...and much easier than I had expected. I just read in another article that one should not use garbage bags to hold the turkey and brine but rather food storage grade bags (Reynolds). Also kosher salt is required. I used the salt I buy to cook fish in a salt crust and it worked fine but I can imagine there are a lot of salts out there that could make a mess of the recipe. I used my favorite stuffing which includes apples and dried fruit and bird, gravy and suffing were all a hit. Juicy and flavorful!

Although I have never used a brine before, I understand why people rave about the process. My turkey was very moist and I could taste a hint of apple and spice in the flavoring. I did not make the gravy, but will definitely make the brine and glaze again. Next time I will increase the salt in the brine to 2 cups. In addition, I brined a boneless turkey breast in order to have extra leftovers. It was delicious as well.

Served this along with a crown roast of pork for T'giving. Wanted to do something outside the traditional box and this fit the bill. It was salty and sweet, and the meat was juicy and tender.

Not sure if all that work for the brine was worth it. I think I'm more of a fan of salty type turkeys, not that this was sweet, but the apple cider undertones wasn't one of my favorites. Overall a good recipe and it was moist & flavorful.

For the first time, a turkey recipe is making a command performance in my household.The bird is soaking in a cider/spice/salt bath as I write. I've roasted, fried, and smoked a few before.I liked that it was brined, but could be stuffed. This one pleased the whole crew. Juicy, beautifully browned, and not too far from "traditional", it pleased all. I made two gravies, one with the homemade stock and the other with the cider flavored pan drippings. Both were fantastic, and I think even the traditionalists would have loved the pan gravy (sans the cream and Calvados). I did not make this stuffing recipe, however, I use a very similar sausage, sage, and apple stuffing recipe. The glaze is fabulous. Be careful not to burn.

Like the other reviewer I made this last year and failed to review. It was absolutly the best brine I have ever used. I usually brine the turkeys as it keeps it moist but have had to be carefull about the salt. This one is perfect. We brined two turkey breasts and then smoked them. The brine gave them the perfect moistness and the smoke flavor was wonderful. We had my husbands family and they are die-hard traditionalists. My husband was concerned about me breaking tradition. No need to fear! They loved the turkey. I will definitly make this again this year, but will roast in the oven.

I cannot believe that I did not review this recipe after last year's Thanksgiving dinner. I made this recipe for my '5th Annual American Thanksgiving in Holland' dinner. It received rave reviews from all my guest. Not a speck of turkey was left after my dinner for leftovers! Please know that my table of 10 guest, looks like the U.N. Family and friends from Holland, South Africa, Spain, Croatia and me, the one token American! Most have never had a whole roasted turkey or stuffing before my dinners. They are thrilled to see the golden bird come out of the oven! Lots of fun. Since, each year I make the traditional dinner, just different recipes for each dish I will be hard pressed to top this turkey recipe. I highly recommend this recipe to all, as it was a fabulous success last year.

Made the turkey and stuffing as directed this past Thanksgiving. Yes, it was delicious, but the brining was a pain. I always roast a big bird, always using something out of the current Bon Appetit magazine, and mine never come out bad. I would pass on making this one again, simply because of the brining, even though is was very tasty.

My family's 3rd Thanksgiving and my 3rd time making the turkey... a 22 pounder was polished off by 12 of my guests. They all loved it! I would recommend partially stuffing the cavity with Granny Smith apples and be wary of burning the glaze. I was about 3 minutes short of that. I'm a mid-westerner currently living in San Diego and I had friends from Texas, Oregon, Chicago, Florida ALL LOVE this bird.

A little late on my review as I made this for Thanksgiving 2008...but darn if it wasn't the best Turkey I have ever cooked! I was a bit worried about the brine...but it made the most delicious and moist turkey ever to come out of my oven. I have my recipe for all future Thanksgivings!

I just don't have good luck when it comes to turkey. I made this turkey for Thanksgiving. It was okay - nothing special when you consider all the time it took to do the brining and basting. For Christmas Eve (they had buy one turkey get one free at the grocery store) I used an Oven Bag to cook my turkey in it was easier and tasted about the same. Next year for the holidays I think I'll do seafood. Hey - the Pilgrims ate fish, too.

I would've liked to have had more of this turkey but it went so fast. It was my first attempt at roasting a turkey too. Even though I only used half the size in the recipe, still the weight of the turkey plus brine broke my fridge shelves! Wish it were cold enough here to leave it outside.

This was my second turkey. My biggest compliment was that my brother, cook extraordinaire, wanted the recipe -- and he's brined many a turkey before! I brined it 20 hours (1 hr/pound) in a 5 gal. plastic bucket outside on my deck since it's cold where I live. I didn't shop enough in advance to find cider on sale, so I used frozen concentrated AJ. I don't know if this made a difference; the turkey had very mild flavor from the juice but it wasn't detectable that it was apple. As for the glaze, I used 1/4 cup concentrate and I did not have to reduce it. I stuffed the bird with a rice mixture and cooked it breast side down, removing the bird at 160. The breast was incredibly moist; some meat near the bone of the dark meat was pink but I didn't worry about that. We had plenty of gravy -- I cooked the roux long enough so that the sauce would have a nice color. Not too salty nor too much apple flavor as some reviewers posted. I look forward to using this recipe for the next turkey I make!

This is the second time I made this turkey and as expected, it came out phenomenal. It's quite a feat to manage a 21 pounder, but well worth it. It's moist, juicy, scrumptious, and all types of absolutely delicious. Mind you, this was only my second time preparing a turkey in my life, this recipe was given to me by a former boss for Thanksgiving '07. Everyone was again floored and I will carry this recipe with me for a lifetime. :p The one thing I did not make out of this recipe was the stuffing. I made a different stuffing and to avoid an empty turkey, I stuffed it with onions, lemons, rosemary, sage, and thyme. The aroma was fantastic and I think it gave the turkey some nice juiciness as well. I couldn't recommend this recipe enough!!

I've prepared and roasted a lot of turkeys, but this was without a doubt the best one ever. It was so moist and the apple cider just enhanced the flavor of the turkey so nicely. I would suggest having someone home to help you set the turkey into the brine as it can be kind of challenging. We made our usual gravy, but again really enjoyed the faint taste of apple cider using the juices from the roasting pan. I'll definitely prepare our turkey again next year using this recipe. Yum!!!

My first turkey, and it came out very well-- the meat was very moist and the cider flavor was subtle.

This is the best brine recipe I have used because it produces a remarkably moist bird without the salty taste. Like reviewer jaconlin from Boston, I too wrongly took the bird out of the oven when the breast was at 160 degrees--it left the interior of the turkey far undercooked. I was going on a cooking show host's advice but my advice is definitely do try this recipe, but absolutely follow the cooking directions. That said, you may find that the gravy tastes more like apple gravy than what one thinks of as traditional turkey gravy; ours was quite blonde and the turkey flavor was mild. I may add some smoked turkey wings to simmer in the sage stock next time for a stronger turkey flavor.

I tested this one (without stuffing) before thanksgiving and found that it did produce a most beautiful turkey, with lovely golden crispy skin. However, i took the bird out at 168 degrees rather than 175 and it was still a little bit dry in breast. I tried again at T-giving and took it out at 160 as advised by a previous review, and it was a bit too pink near the bone. Next time I may try 165. My gravy came out awful the first time, it was super salty. I tried again without additional salt and it was fantastic. The real winner here is the STUFFING. Out of this world. Except it did not come anywhere near 160 degrees (it was 120 after 3 hours) when stuffed in the bird (the temp you need to kill any samonella according to the CDC) so I had to take it out part way and cook it separately.

Hands down the best brining recipe I've found. The cider lends just the slightest hint of sweetness and the meat was ultra-juicy. As other reviewers noted, there's not nearly enough gravy so the next time I'll double the amount. What was there got high marks from all. I omitted the brandy and went light on the cream but it was still fabulous!

To the person in Japan, use apple juice. Cider is similar, a little more earthy maybe as it is made from whole apples that have been pressed. Apple juice will be comparable. Made this turkey last year and it was fabulous! I didn't do the sage broth or the gravy, just made up my own gravy with the pan drippings. But the turkey itself was incredible! A close match is BA's Herb roasted turkey with cider gravy. Both turkeys are amazing.

I also poured some chicken stock in the roasting pan to keep it moist. I will never make another turkey again.

I made this turkey 2 years ago and it was my first attempt at a turkey, and it turned out absolutely beautiful and delicious and juicy. I plan to make it again this year, and I'll let you know how it turns out. I was really writing this because I had a little trick to share with everyone. To solve the challenge of finding a container large enough to brine the turkey in, and to find a place to put it in the fridge, I cleaned out a cooler and brined it directly in that. Instead of adding all water to the cooled brine mixture, I added mostly ice and a little water, put the turkey in, and stuck it on my back porch. It worked like a charm.

Rating: 4
This recipe is absolutely exceptional. I'm on a low carb diet, so omitted the stuffing and left the alcohol and cream out of the gravy. By not stuffing the bird I was able to shorten the overall time ... brined it in the afternoon on the first day, then had it sit in the fridge from early morning to mid- afternoon rather than having to span two nights overall. When it was ready the family dug in ... I've never seen turkey go that fast! This is the third brined turkey recipe I've tried and it's definitely the best.

It turned out so well that my family made me promise to prepare this turkey again next year.

Amazing turkey. My first turkey ever and I'm going to make it for Christmas again. I would suggest brining in a secure container such as a cooler because I used roasting bags as the epicurious video suggested and when my fiance and I took the turkey out of the fridge, the bag broke and the brine sprayed all over my face and shirt. Like something out of a comedy movie. Other than that it was perfect!!!!

I will never cook a turkey anyother way. The white meat was so moist with a hint of apple flavor. I didn't want to have the apple cider over power so I held in liquid for 12 hrs. and drained on paper towles for 6 hrs. I came out fantastic.

2nd year in a row we made this brined turkey--by far the best we've made. The turkey looks like it should be on the cover of a magazine! Brined, then drained for 2 hours then roasted. Since we did not have much gravy last year, we decided to not drain overnight, hoping to capture some of those juices. We also added 1/2 cup of broth every 1/2 hour to ensure we'd have enough gravy. The gravy is to die for--my husband asked during the carving of our 26# bird, if I could do this same meal the following week--and he was serious! We had plenty of gravy to serve our 17 guests--huge success.

Best turkey I've ever eaten - tasted just ever- so-slightly of apples, incredibly juicy. For my 14# turkey I reduced the brine by a third, added 3 cloves, 1 t. crushed peppercorn, and 1/2 cup sugar, and let it sit for 14 hours. Served with the apple parsnip sausage stuffing. Yum.

Made this side by side with the Lemon-Herb Turkey w/ Lemon-Garlic Gravy (BA 11-2007), mostly to experiment between brined vs. compound butter-under- the skin techniques. Used 11 lb., free- range, organic birds in both cases. My guests really liked both, but gave an edge to the brined bird for juiciness and overall appearance. This is the one that I will make in the future. It came out picture perfect, with very little hassle. Also, tested the convection roast function on our oven and it cooked both unstuffed birds to 175F (higher than Id wanted) in less than 1.5 hrs. So, I will adjust my timing next year accordingly&

I made this with a 10 # heritage bird. It was delicious and everyone loved it-- a great brine recipe that is not too salty. Will definitely make it again.

I made this turkey with a 13# bird and it was fantastic. I bought a new plastic bucket (3 gallon) for the brining. I was able to leave the bird outside on my front porch (I lucked out with the weather, it never got below 33 nor above 40 for the 20 hours i brined for). I did not stuff but served the leek and wild mushroom stuffing on this site. The gravy worked very well. Everyone raved about how juicy this turkey was.

I've been brining turkeys for several years now and have made this version twice. It's hands down the best ever. The turkey ends up juicy and tender--and yes, just as bronzed as George! LOL This year I brined it for about 20 hours but spent less time letting it sit after rinsing, and it was terrific. I line a cooler with two garbage bags and squeeze the air out of them, then cover the bags with ice. I leave the cooler in the garage and it's fine. My only real change--I don't make the gravy in this recipe. I use the sage broth as a base for the Ginger Snap gravy that's included with the Molasses Brined Turkey recipe also found on this site. Unbelievably delicious and I'll never make turkey any other way.

This was amazing!!! We called our turkey "George Hamilton" cause it was so tan :) It was incredibly moist and delicious - everybody raved!!! The time it took to prep (brine, wipe off & refrigerate, etc.) was totally worth the effort in the end. I will definitely make this turkey again!!! However, I will have to get a new container for the brining - my 21 qt stock pot could only fit the 20 lb turkey, 4 qts of cider, and only 2 qts of water. For those who use other containers for brining (coolers, garbage cans) - can you brine safely outside of the fridge? Do you just keep bags of ice in the container with the turkey and brine? (Big LOL re: the story of the mastiff in the reviews - we have 2 bullmastiffs, I can only imagine...) LOVE this recipe!

This was the first Thanksgiving turkey I've ever made and it was delicious! The brining does make all the difference. I didn't have quite enough allspice, so I added some cloves to the brine; otherwise, I followed the recipe. None of the three liquor stores I went to had Applejack brandy or Calvados, so I improvised with Kahlua. The gravy was rich and a little sweet, but complimented the turkey nicely. I'd love to try it with the right liquor! This will be my standard turkey recipe from now on.

Fabulous dish! Highly recommended! Like other reviewers said, brined turkey tends to cook faster. Don't overcook it! This recipe was definitely worth the time. It's great if you have a helper. I may have become overwhelmed had I done it myself.

I just wanted to share my little stroke of genius especially for those like me who are fairly new to cooking in general and can't spring $150 for a big pot: I found a $3 styrofoam cooler at the LQ store and my 21 lb turkey fit perfectly. Lined it with that gluey plastic wrap stuff and reinforced it with duct tape just to be safe. Took out a shelf in the fridge and everything worked! Will rate after I cook the thing, assuming I don't drop it getting it out of the fridge... I'm slightly apprehensive.

This was, without a doubt, the BEST turkey I have ever eaten!!! I will never cook another turkey again without brining it first! I doubled the gravy recipe and was very glad I did as the gravy was to die for!!!! I also boiled the neck and giblets and added that broth to the gravy too. I got nothing but rave reviews for this turkey!!!

This is my bar-none favorite turkey recipe, and I've made it many times. I have a clean never used for anything else office size trash can I brine in, just add half a bag of ice and you don't have to refrigerate. BUT...I thought I'd share a thanksgiving day disaster story for the ages with you all that also enlightened me to a great surprise aspect to this recipe. I friend came to visit us from out of state, and brought her dogs with her. I have them too, but mine top out at 30 pounds...hers...a mastiff. I never bothered to consider the fact that a truly LARGE dog could knock over a full trash can and cart off a 25 pound turkey. Silly me. The night before thanksgiving, I re-did the entire brine recipe, the bird only soaked for 8 hours and drained for 4...and it was STILL AWESOME! Another hint: buy a couple of whole roasting chickens and brine them in the solution after removing the turkey...plenty of goodness for two uses!

This is the first time that I have enjoyed turkey! We misread the recipe and didn't allow the turkey enough time to dry out, so we ended up drying it with a hair dryer -- but that worked too. A great recipe!

Although I have eaten some excellent turkeys over the years, this is the first time I have ever brined a turkey. It was certainly the most delicious I have eaten! Everyone of my family and friends who shared our Thanksgiving meal agreed that this turkey was the best ever! It was succulent, juicy, and so-o-o tasty. I removed the turkey from the brine after only around 12 hours because I was concerned that it would become too salty. It was not too salty at all and next year I will let the turkey brine for the full 18 hrs to see if I can improve on perfect!

The best turkey I have ever had, hands down. I bought a large, tall ice chest and submerged the bird in that with plastic bags filled with frozen water. Then I emptied it and dried off the turkey and put it back in the ice chest with more ice filled plastic bags. It worked great. Now I only use that ice chest for the turkey.

I made the entire meal this recipe was included with in the magazine and it was all delicious. I especially liked the gravy. And the cranberries they suggested were perfect - a really nice contrast to the sweeter flavour the meal had. I definitely didn't find it to salty. I agree the turkey was pretty hard to handle in the fridge though.

Turkey with a TANG...not my idea of Thanksgiving. So thankful I didn't have guests. Even the soup I made with the left-overs was tart. I thought the "Barbecued Turkey with Maple-Mustard Glaze", (also brined) from this site was far superior. Of course not everyone has the luxury of grilling outdoors in November like we do here in Arizona.

This turkey got RAVE reviews from everyone at Christmas dinner. It was probably the moistest oven-roasted turkey to ever come out of my kitchen. I also had to tent it early because of browning. I omitted the cream and brandy in the gravy, and didn't feel like I was missing a thing. It was tough to find a container big enough to submerge the turkey (and then it seemed like the shelf in the fridge was going to crack under all the weight, but it held together!) I will *definitely* make this again.

Rating: 4
Everyone raved -- despite the very dark brown skin, which I too experienced. Just don't do an initial high-temp roasting. Served with Major Grey chutney, it was to die for. NB Tightly wrapping the bird in foil for the 30-40 minute rest after coming out of the oven makes all the difference in the world.

Rating: 4
A 10 out of 10. Will definitely make it again...But I have a question -- our turkey smoked from the minute we put it in the oven until we took it out. And not just a little...we had to keep opening the oven door to clear it. Anyone else experience this?

Rating: 4
I have now found the perfect turkey preparation with this recipe - it was fabulous! It looked beautiful, just like the photo (although we actually did have to put the foil around it earlier than suggested because it was browning so quickly), and between the brine, glaze, and gravy, this was the most succulent turkey I have made to date, and I've made many-a-turkey in my time! I will be hard-pressed to top this recipe...

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving and was very disappointed. I even took a picture of mine next to the magazine picture. Everyone got a good laugh. It turned almost black from the sugar I assume in the cider that you baste on it. I even had it covered almost the whole time. It just kept getting darker and darker. This is probably the 35th Thanksgiving turkey I have coooked and it sure didn't look that great. That said, it was very flavorful once you took all the skin off and carved it. Everyone commented on how flavorful it was, but I still wanted it to look more like the picture.

I've brined turkeys before and was very disappointed. This brine added nice flavor and kept the turkey moist and tasty. As usual, it is hard to find a container to brine the turkey in. A large (double) trash bag does work. And, it was fairly easy to prepare (important when you're juggling a lot of dishes). I'm doing it again for Christmas

I've been cooking for 30 years, and have made quite a number of turkeys in my time. But this one takes the prize! My quest for the perfect Thanksgiving Turkey has ended. THIS is IT! Our guests raved about it. Even one guest, who had previously said he hated turkey, couldn't get enough of it!!! If that doesn't say it all, I don't know what does. What amazed me about this recipe was that for the first time, both the dark and the white (breast) meat was very juicy and flavorful. In un-brined turkeys, by the time the dark meat cooks, the breast is inedibly overcooked. Not so in this turkey-- as I carved the breast, juices literally ran out of it. Absolutely fantastic! The best thing about it was that it was super easy-- and foolproof... just time-consuming, but most definitely well worth the time. I also found that this brined turkey cooks faster than un-brined turkeys. You MUST try this recipe-- you'll never look for another, ever again!!

This was the best turkey I've ever had, and my guests agreed. Re apple cider in Canada, I used Presidents Choice Natural Apple Juice from Loblaws--it's unfiltered so is like cider. Delicious!

Clear apple liquid is apple juice Carbonated apple liquid is Sparkling apple juice Alcoholic apple liquid is Hard Cider What this recipe calls for is a brown, opaque liquid. It contains juice from the entire apple and retains much of the fiber, thus giving it its color and full-bodied flavor. It is very popular in the US and can be found in every grocery store. Look in the refrigeration section. Most apple ciders do not contain preservatives and must be refrigerated.

For ex-US cooks - this definition of "cider" I found on the Epicurious site - "Apple cider was a highly popular early American beverage. Cider is made by pressing the juice from fruit (usually apples). It can be drunk straight or diluted with water. Before FERMENTATION, it's referred to as "sweet" cider. It becomes "hard" cider after fermentation, and can range widely in alcohol content. Apple cider is also used to make vinegar and brandy." In the US cider is non-alcoholic. Ex-US cider is usually fermented, therefore alcoholic. Hope this helps.

Can someone tell me what this recipe means by "apple cider"? In Canada, cider is a clear, sparkling, alcoholic drink but I don't think it's very common in the US. Does this recipe want our alcoholic cider, or a clear, sparkling, non-alcoholic cider, or some type of non-carbonated apple juice? I'd like to make this for xmas. Thanks!

This turkey, paired with the apple parsnip sausage dressing, was absolutely outstanding. The bird was a gorgeous dark red color and the meat was succulent. The gravy was unbelievable as well.

This turkey recipe is excellent. I always make a brined turkey, and for last 5 years it has been a Bon Appetit recipe. This year, my guests raved it was the best yet, and I completely agree. I made the Sausage and Apple Stuffing recipe from last year, and it pared very well with the underlying apple cider flavor.

This turkey was phenomenal...tender, juicy and gorgeous. I made another non-brined turkey at the same time and it was considerably more dry and less tasty. Only problem with this was the gravy...it was awful. I followed their directions to a "T" but it was horribly salty. Next time I'll use my other gravy recipes, but the turkey and brine is a keeper.

My family has used the Bon Appetit recipes to determine our Thanksgiving menu for at least 15 years and although we all have our favorites we don't repeat the meal except for other times of the year. This recipe, however, will be the first exception to our rule. Fabulous, delicious, scrumptious, couldn't-get-enough! The skin on this bird, our guest of honor, was perfectly crisp with a sweet and savory crackle. And the color...it looked as if it hopped off the magazine cover onto our dinner table. You won't be disappointed. Be sure to make the gravy, as well.

Rating: 4
BEST TURKEY RECIPE EVER!!! I added zest and juice from 3 oranges and 3 tagerines to the brine, along with some sage leaves, red pepper flakes, terragon and thyme. I also didn't have any whole allspice, so I used ground, and it worked out very well. Soaked it in the brine for 36 hours and only took it out about 2 hours before roasting. Overnight seemed too short a time for such a large bird and I didn't want the juices to leak out prior to roasting. Stuffed the bird with orange halves, a few sprigs of sage and thyme. Also put a few tablespoons of herb butter under the skin of the breat and roasted at 500F for the first 30 minutes on top of a few carrots, celery and onions. Then added a cup of broth and a cup of cider to the bottom of the pan, tented and roasted until done. It was DELICIOUS! Juicy, tender and just a hint of the cider flavor. I was worried it would be too apple-y, but it wasn't at all. We had 13 people to dinner and a 26lb bird and I barely had enough leftovers for 4 sandwiches the next day -- the real test. This is going to be my Thankgiving turkey recipe from now on. The one caution - use a meat thermometer. In my experience, brined turkey always tends to roast faster than I expect. Take it out at 160F and let it sit until you're ready to serve.

This was in fact a very tasty recipe for turkey. I have brined my turkeys for a few years now and I definitely prefer this brine. The way the recipe is writen is wonderful yet if you find you would like just a hint more of the spiced apple flavor (since it is very subtle) You may want to try brining it a bit longer, like 24-36 hours and then letting it dry for only 12 hours in the fridge. This is definitely a recipe all must try. In answer to a previous review in need of help. Yes it is to be in the fridge for two nights. Goodluck and enjoy.

In reading this recipe, I am a bit confused about refrigerating the turkey overnight. Is it done twice, for 2 consecutive nights, or just for one night? Sounds like it's done a second time after draining on the paper towels. Any help?

I think I should NOT have used a prebasted turkey. This made it a little salty, because there is so much salt in the prebasted kind. BUT, I would make it again. I did not use the broth that I cooked for the gravy. I used the juice from the brown 'n bag and there was plenty of juice. That's how I cooked the turkey. I just basted through the slits in the bag. I loved the taste of the gravy even though it was a little salty.

Absolutely the BEST turkey we've had--moist and juicy with just a hint of the apple/spice flavor. The entire family raved! I didn't have whole allspice, so I just threw in some ground allspice and then also added chopped garlic, whole peppercorns and about 1 loosely filled cup of brown sugar. We BBQ'ed the turkey on the Weber, filling the cavity with half a lemon, a carrot and celery stalk, and many stalks of fresh rosemary, sage and marjoram. Rubbed the outside with olive oil only. Discovered that the easiest way to do the brining was to use a big trash bag and fill it with the brine and turkey, squeezing out the air so the whole turkey is well submerged. Then place the bag inside a cooler and throw in some ice. We kept it outside in our nice cold garage until we were ready to rinse and BBQ. No mess, no hassle! I just can't say enough how DELICIOUS this was!

Wonderful recipe for a juicy, flavorful turkey! I'm salt sensitive and was pleased by how lightly salted the meat tasted. My problem: not enough thigh meat to get an accurate thermometer reading. I ended up just waiting until the thigh joint was loose or wiggly enough before deciding my bird was fully cooked.

I made this turkey with a 13# bird and it was BEAUTIFUL! It had an amazing flavor, despite my use of cheap grocery store brand cider. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it cooked in less than 3 hours. It was moist and delicious! I didn't stuff it and took it out of the oven when the thermometer read 160 degrees. This made for a very juicy bird. I highly recommend this recipe!

As other reviewers have written, this was fabulous. My husband said it was the best turkey I've ever made and I've cooked a few. I'm an advocate of high temperature roasting so I tented my 13-pound room-temperature turkey and cooked it at 425 degrees. I took the tent off after 90 minutes, used the glaze and cooked it for another 35 minutes at 400 degrees. It was a beautiful mahogany, moist and succulent. I'm one of those cooks who abhor stuffing a bird so I cooked my own recipe for dressing separately. I agree with the reviewer who wrote there wasn't enough gravy but didn't realize it until it was too late to increase the amount. The only complaint of the dinner was that there wasn't more gravy.

Rating: 4
I changed the recipe slightly. I brined the turkey for 36 hours (instead of just overnight), and took the turkey out of the brining solution about 1.5 hours before cooking (instead of the night before). Because of this, the cider taste was prominent in the turkey meat, which everybody (inclyding the pre-dinner skeptics) really loved. I used a relatively cheap cider--but next time I plan to use Martinelli's or something a little nicer. My wife loved the stuffing recipe that goes along with the brining recipe.

This turkey was AMAZING. It was my first attempt at roasting a big bird for Thanksgiving or any other time, and coming from a family of what I consider to be excellent cooks, I was a bit nervous. When I told my husband I'd be making this recipe, he whined and moaned and said, "Can't we just have PLAIN turkey?! Why do you have to soak it in all of that fruity crap?" Well, after tasting it, he changed his tune. I think his exact words were, "Oh my gosh, this is awesome!" To start, it came out of the oven beautifully...it was the most lovely golden brown. The meat was juicy, tender and had a wonderful flavor. I think I screwed something up on the gravy b/c mine turned out being brown instead of white, but it was still excellent...just wish there had been more of it, so I think I'd up the gravy next time, and there certainly will be a next time! We did a 19.1 pound bird and roasted it for about 4.5 hours to a temp of 170.

Yum! Great brine recipe...our 23# turkey also cooked much much faster than the recipe indicated - about 4 1/2 hours...did not make the glaze or the gravy -- just deglazed the pan with wine and reduced...

This got rave reviews from my Thanksgiving guests tonight. I cooked it unstuffed and a 22 lb bird only took 4 and 1/2 hrs. My only gripe is re: the gravy. The amount to make is absurdly, laughably small! I quadrupled the recipe and still my 14 guests were begging for more. Who doesn't like gravy doesn't like life is my motto, and this should be corrected!

This was my first time cooking our Thanksgiving turkey (or any turkey!) Many of our guests said it was the best turkey they ever tasted. It was truly delicious. I followed the recipe completely, including using the Apple, Sausage, and Parsnip Stuffing with Fresh Sage from the same Nov 2005 issue. As a first-time turkey cook, I could not have been more pleased with the results. The turkey was beautiful, golden brown. The meat was succulent and juicy. The flavor lended by the brining and glazing process was absolutely delicious, yet subtle enough that it wasn't overwhelmingly cider-y. I used a good quality cider - not sure how big of a difference that made, but I would imagine that bad cider=bad turkey. When reducing the cider for the glaze, be sure to watch it closely once you reduce down past about one cup's worth. It went from liquid to thick glaze very quickly at the end. I left the pot for just a few minutes after it had reduced to about 3/4 cup. It had taken quite a while to reduce that far. My husband grabbed the pot and called to me just a minute or two later, and the cider was just starting to carmelize. Just a few moments longer and it would have burned or gotten too stiff to work with. It ended up being the prefect consistency for glazing. The gravy received lots of compliments as well. I thought about omitting the brandy since we didn't have any on hand, but I am really glad we decided to include it. It really lended a special flavor to the end result. I heartily recommend this recipe to both experienced and novice turkey cooks.

I never would have tried this recipe, but I got together with friends last weekend just to try out recipes prior to Thanksgivng. We had this turkey and the Ultimate Turkey from the Nov 2005 issue. Both turkeys were great, but this was really, really wonderful. I was worried it would be too salty or sweet from the cider brine. It was really juicy and the cider flavor was very, very mild. The gravy recipe is wonderful as well...a lot of people turned their nose up at first because it was "white" gravy. After they tried it most said they'd never go back to old, brown gravy. I really recommend you give this a try!

I have NEVER made a turkey before, and, the day I made this, I couldn't find my meat thermometer. This turkey came out SO beautiful, moist, flavorful, and the drippings made for a GREAT GRAVY (I made Alton Browns T-Day gravy from the same issue)
