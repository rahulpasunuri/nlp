This was a really good salad dish. In the summer, I usually grill the chicken and pineapple for a summer twist.

Admittedly, I used shredded cabbage and spinach, combined, instead of arugela because that was what I had around, but I still found this a tasteless, bland dish. I had to add way more salt and pepper and straight vinegar to the final product--I wouldn't make it again unless I used cilantro, and way more of it, instead of the basil, and didn't dilute the dressing with the wine but just deglazed the pan with it straight. No one else really liked it, either.

This was a wonderful, easy to prepare dinner. I didn't have any bottled citrus dressing so I used a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice and orange juice. It was a hit with my guest.
