I didn't make the compote, just the pudding. I was looking for a recipe that didn't require baking or a double boiler. This one is pretty quick, easy, and tasty. Brown sugar makes a decent substitute if you don't have molasses on hand.

easy and good. Could easily use different fruit topping. Liked having nuts/coconut on top.

I love this recipe, and have made it repeatedly. Does not taste low fat at all. A great choice when you don't have the time to make a traditional Indian pudding. The compote is lovely too!

I was quite disappointed in this recipe. The pudding was too strongly molasses-flavored, and the dried fruit compote was sickly sweet. Next time will try the Indian Pudding with Nutmeg Ice Cream . The eggs should be an improvement, as well as the extra cream on top.
