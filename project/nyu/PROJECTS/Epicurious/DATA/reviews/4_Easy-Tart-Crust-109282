Sounds very easy - I'm going to try it but the recipe doesn't say at what temperature of how long it should be baked.

I tried several crust recipes and found this one to be consistently excellent.

I'm new to the professional culinary world, having only a year of experience working in a bakery. I brought this tart crust recipe with me and used it for our daily lunch tarts. My boss (who had been cooking for 15+ years) dubbed me "the tart queen", and asked me for my secret to perfect tart crusts every time... thanks epicurious for a great recipe that's been proven to work over 300 and counting!

I'm giving this a qualified four forks, the qualification being it's exactly what is says, an Easy Tart Crust. It's not going to get you into Le Cordon Bleu but it's fast, simple and pretty hard to screw up. I used it to make the Pear and Chocolate Hazelnut Crostata and it could not have been simpler.
