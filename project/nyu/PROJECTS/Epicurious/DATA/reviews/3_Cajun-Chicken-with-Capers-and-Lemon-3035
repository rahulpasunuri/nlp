This chicken was very easy to prepare, tender, got rave reviews. The only thing I would do differently is to lower the heat or remove from heat before adding broth for the sauce; mine was just a little burned. Still very delicious!

This was such an easy recipe (only took around 20 minutes to make) and was very delicious. I would make this again for sure!!

i love this recipe!! it is the best one i have ever used off of this website. for anyone who makes dinner nightly and wants something fast and good- this is your meal. we sprinkle tabasco sauce on the rice to add a little spice. this is a meal that gets made frequently at my house.

This was an easy, delicious chicken recipe. I didn't want the spice and took out the cajun seasoning - it tasted just as good. The lemon flavor was perfect. Will definitely make this again. My husband will kill me if I don't!
