I agree that this recipe is far too much work... and although I loathe when reviewers alter a recipe too much here is what I do for this one: I use purchased thai-peanut sauce instead of the dressing, but I do use the beef marinade. I also like it served warm over linguine and have added other vegetables like carrots or snap peas- then you eliminate the fresh greens. Love it this way.

This recipe was obviously written by someone who doesn't cook. The preparation instructions are complicated and the directions are disturbingly unclear. I had to reread the thing at least a dozen times and rewrite it by hand to realize what actually had to be done. It was just sooo much work and required a lot of extra time and dishes to sort out what had to get done in what order. I did the following: While the beef is marinating I prepped all the ingredients, chopped the watercress and cilantro(sub for min) the cucumber, the peanuts and the green onion. Then I made the dressing. After the meat had marinated I put it on to cook while I cooked some udon noodles(for about 10 minutes) then I combined everything. It helped to do all the prep work in advance because the recipe ws so badly composed that I didn't have time to read it and cook at the same time. The dish came out great and my friends loved it(loved it!) but it was so much work and my kitchen looked like it had been ransacked by crazed asian chefs. Next time maybe it will be easier but that's only because I took the time to reorganzie the recipe.

Way too much work, dirty dishes and coordination for the mediocre result.

I thought this recipe was missing something; it was lacking zing. The meat was delicious, but sauce just seemed bland to us, even after I put in a heavy dose of hot pepper toasted sesame oil. I think I will try this again with some heavy modifications (rice noodles, cilantro and ???). Or maybe I will just stick to more authentic recipes and ditch the fusion thing.

The dressing is wonderful. I couldn't stop "tasting" it before dinner... we're lucky there was enough left for dinner. :) We thought the cumin in the marinade was too powerful, so next time I will decrease it to just a dash, and put it directly in the dressing, since it does add something to the dressing, it was just too powerful for the meat (We don't like cumin, though). I made this with turkey instead of beef, and subbed a veggie/lettuce salad for the pasta. I also didn't have watercress or mint, so left them out, and thought it was still yum. This dressing will become a staple in our house.

I love this. I make the dressing in the time it takes the pasta water to boil. As a suggestion: I made a vegetarian version of it by combining the marinade ingredients (minus the meat juices obviously) and the ingredients for the dressing. I tossed it with the hot linguine, threw in scallions and some chopped up mesclun that was heavy on the arugula, and it was fabulous. The sauce keeps amazingly well in the refrigerator and tastes better the next day. The only ingredient change I made to the sauce was to substitute some of the honey. I only had a strong flavored, orange blossum. So, I used a tiny bit and added about a tablespoon of dark muscovado sugar. When I want meat, I toss a grilled thai chicken sausage with it.

I make this recipe all the time, think it presents well, with a sprig of mint on top and everyone I serve it to loves it. I substitute cilantro for the watercress in the dressing and do not serve the pasta on a bed of greens. I make everything in advance but do not premix the pasta and dressing- the dressing at least must be served no colder than room temperature. Also I have used black tea & earl grey and both are good. (in ref to an earlier comment, you boil the marinade then add it to the dressing)

I almost went 4 forks, this was really good & worth the time. Not a big mint fan, I was concerned, but the blend of flavors was just right. One question: What were you supposed to use the leftover marinade (boiled 2 min) for?

Excellent! This dish was a big hit in my household (though there are only two of us). I eased up on the peanut butter a bit, and used Sri Lanka tea instead of Chinese--because that's what I had in my cupboard. I agree that this dish is best when warmed *just a bit*. Fresh bean spouts, just a smidge of mint, and lemongrass add to the experience. A very different, very enjoyable meal!

My best friend and I love this recipe! It may take a while to make, but doing it in a group cuts down the time. The only thing that is bad is that it doesn't work well as left overs, and it makes a lot!

This was a little strange--the peanut flavor is strong and cloying, and it's a pretty rich dish. I might consider it as part of a larger Asian buffet, but it's kind of overwhelming to be the center of a meal. Also hard to make attractive.

I thought this recipe was really interesting. The peanut butter was a little overwhelming, i'll probably cut back the next time. but it worked really well. i especially liked it a little warmed up, but not too much.

Excellent - the sauce was wonderful. A big hit with the family.

I also thought this was a lot of work. And I wondered if the recipe needed more editing. Three teabags to make 3/4 c. tea seems a lot. I just made a regular cup of tea. And half of the instruction for the cucumber prep was in the ingredient list, the rest in the instructions, which I missed. It was tasty, but I prefer the beef salad from The Foods of Vietnam by Nicole Routhier--it's always a huge hit and much easier.

Have made this a few times now and it's always a hit. It's flexible and easy, especially if you have most of the ingredients on hand. I've used cilantro instead of watercress for increased Asian influence, added shredded carrot for extra crispness, and served both warm and cold depending on the weather. Always good!

THIS RECIPE IS WAY TOO COMPLICATED THE FLAVORS DON'T MESH AND THE FINAL PRODUCT IS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!

Rating: 1
ENORMOUSLY disappointing. I spent three hours on my feet for this one, and it just did not taste good at all. It makes a huge amount, and I will throw it all away. The peanut butter makes it thick (once it begins to cool), sticky and heavy-sweet. The combination of cayenne, red pepper, ginger, and cumin make it too hot for my taste. But the flavor that overwhelmed and ruined it for me was the peanut butter. I followed the recipe verbatim, and not one person in the family liked it.

Both my husband and I really liked this recipe. It was an easy and quick dinner that we will make again.
