We loved this cake though I had to make a lot of substitutions because I made it on Christmas Day and all the stores were closed. -1 cup pecans and 1/2 cup almonds -4 tablespoons cocoa powder instead of chocolate -Jameson instead of bourbon I baked it for 45 minutes, until the toothpick was almost clean. I was worried about it being dry, with cocoa powder, but its not at all. It's super tasty and I will definitely make it again.

My version was a bit different so I won't rate this but if I did it would be 4 forks. I used all bittersweet chocolate (ghiradelli's 60%), amaretto instead of the bourbon and almonds instead of the pecans. This was a wonderful cake. Instead of dusting it with confectioner's sugar I frosted it with chocolate buttercream. I'll be making this again when company comes 'round.

This cake is just so pleasant! It's quick, easy, impressive and, above all, delicious! It's also an ideal cake to choose if you want to make it at home and bring it somewhere else; because of its simplicity, it transports really well. A new favorite in my book.

This cake is in a class by itself. I have been subscribing to Gourmet for over ten years and have committed only two cake recipes to the 'hall of fame' This is one and the other is Aunt Rose's pound cake. It's great any time of year and can be decorated to suit the occasion. Using a seasonal stencil with the powdered sugar you can create a wreath on top for Christmas, a heart for Valentines, etc.

This is a really elegant cake. And very simple, if you have a stand mixer and food processor. The outside is a bit crispy/chewy, like a meringue cookie, and the inside is moist and light. However, I baked for 40 minutes and if anything, it could have come out two minutes sooner! 50 minutes would make one crunchy cake!

I'm asked to make this so often that I keep a cake mix in the freezer: ground pecans, 3/4 c. suger and flour. That way I don't need to clean the food processor every time I make the cake. For the cooks who find it too dry, decrease the baking time.

This came out awfully dry and was not a big hit. The taste was okay, but I was hoping for something more nutty and moist. Maybe increasing the liquor qunatity would help. Be sure not to over-bake it -- I baked it just the amount specified, and I think it was too long.

I made this cake in a round 9" pan, and after 35 min. it was completley done. It appeared very dense and overcooked. I reluctantly took it to a friends for New Years. I thought the flavor of this cake was undesirable. I used the highest quality chocolate and it was not chocolaty enough. Perhaps more semi-sweet would have made the flavor right on. Based on the rave reviews, I was soooo disappointed. Thank goodness there were other desserts that night.

Great looking easy to cut. I served the cake with Kentucky Bourbon caramel sauce (available at Williams-sonoma) and whipped cream.

An easy and elegant cake. The cake is great by itself. If you have some extra time, make a white chocolate or raspberry sauce just to decorate the plate.

I have made this cake so many times it new name is Rich's cake. It is very light and moist and the nuts give it a very interesting flavor. It is always a big hit.

To die for. Moist yet light. The pecans give a subtle flavor to the cake. Definitely a hit, with family or guests.

I've actually made this cake several times. I've been subscribing to Gourmet for nine years, and I lost the issue in which this cake appears in my most recent move. It's such a hit, I'm asked to bring it whenever a cake is needed!
