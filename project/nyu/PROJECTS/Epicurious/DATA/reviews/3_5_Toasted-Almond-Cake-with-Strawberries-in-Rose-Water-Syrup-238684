This is a great recipe. I didn't have rose water so I used orange blossom water instead, which worked out well. Everyone loved this & I plan on making it again!

This was wonderful. I made it as written, but baked it in a deep 9" pie pan and sliced into wedges to serve. I sliced each wedge horizontally and propped the pieces open (like open scissors) one atop the other and spooned a good scoop of the strawberries and syrup over both with a dollop of cream. I also baked it a day ahead. Delicious! And easy!

Wonderful recipe. If you use the entire pan there will be 16 servings and there were enough strawberries and whipped cream to go around. I served it for a large group but kept all the pieces separate so people could choose what they wanted. This works especially for lactose intolerant people who can't have the whipped cream.

This was a perfect desert! Not too sweet with a delightful texture. I added some rose water in leu of sugar to some whipped cream and topped the cake with the strawberries and rose water whipped cream and it was delicious.

I made this for a dinner party and it was very well received. All of my guests loved it. It is not too heavy, and the fresh berries and rose-water syrup are a perfect compliment. I liked it for entertaining because it was easy to make but the presentation looked beautiful. Next time I will reduce the syrup down to a thicker sauce, and probably reduce the amount of cream by about one-third as I had a lot of whipped cream leftover.

My cake fell in the center when I pulled it from the oven. I added an extra Tbsp of flour for high altitude (about 6,000 ft) - any thoughts on how to prevent it from falling, or high altitude adjustments? It was still delicious by the way and I'll definitely make again

This got rave reviews. The cake's really easy and tastes great. I'll admit that I cheated on the strawberries, though -- I simply tossed the berries with about 1/3 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon of rose water instead of making the syrup.
