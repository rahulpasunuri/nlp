Just reviewed below and forgot to include that I had changed the recipe from bacon to pancetta. Also, I did NOT peel the peppers and they were soft and easy to eat. An unnecessary step in my opinion.

Fabulous recipe, with or without the pancetta. I used tri-color baby bell peppers and the dish was gorgeous. Served it beside a country ham for New Year's Eve dinner.

This salad was amazing! It was so delicious and had great depth with the bacon, roasted peppers, and pine nuts. The wine vinegar gave it a great kick. My only issue was the hassle of roasting and peeling the peppers - it was a real hassle and the peel did not come off easily even though I followed the recipe exactly. For that reason, I would probably not make it again.

OK this was under summer vegtables so I did not expect meat to be a part. What do I substitute for bacon since I am a vegetarian?

My household has enjoyed this recipe for a couple of years. My husband absolutely loves this dish. Somehow, our BBQ does not generate enough heat to char the peppers evenly or quickly. (the BBQ burns gas, not charcoal. I prefer the taste and heat of charcoal or a wood like oak, but my husband prefers the ease and reliability of gas.) I have found that a stovetop burner seems to do work the best for charring. I took this salad to a party last summer and the recipe collected rave reviews.

I didn't have yellow peppers, so I only used red. I also added crumbled blue cheese at the end. Yumm!

I love roasted peppers and knew I would dive in and be in love with this recipe before I made it, and I was in fact, IN LOVE! However, I wasn't sure my husband who is picky about this kind of recipe, would be so thrilled.. But, I've made it twice now. One for a family meal and once I took it to a neighborhood get-to-gether. It is a hit with my family and my husband and the neighbors all wanted the recipe! A really flavorful good salad that is different. It keeps well at room temperatures for a good few hours.

This was a very tasty dish and easy to make!

This is so great! This time I added a bag of baby spinach to the skillet and served over wheatgrain cooked with apples, red onions, and celery.

SOMEHOW, THE PINE NUTS AND THYME DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE...BUT, WITHOUT THE THYME AND WITH ROASTED SUNFLOWER SEEDS, THE DISH WAS DELICIOUS. WAS SERVED WITH A SOUTHERN SMOTHERED STEAK. RECEIVED MANY COMPLIMENTS FROM OUR PARTY OF 10. WILL DEFINATELY BE MAKING THIS AGAIN. PRIOR TO EATING, I HAD ADVISED EVERYONE OF THE INGREDIENT PROBLEM...AFTER EATING, NO ONE COMPLAINED!

very much delicious!

Loved it - Low carb and easy to make. The key for me was using applewood smoked bacon. It gives the dish a completely different flavor from the typical hickory smoked bacon.

I liked this dish, overall, but if I make it again, I would add MUCH more thyme, and maybe use better quality bacon. It seemed like the taste of roasted pepper dominated and little else came through.

Excellent and - even with the effort of roasting the peppers - very easy. Everyone liked the bold flavors. Pair with a slice of ciabatta and a glass of sauvignon blanc...

Excellent! It is well worth the little effort of peeling and seeding the peppers.I personally wouldn't use jarred peppers. A little extra vinegar was needed. Next time I will add a mild feta.My very, very picky husband gave this a 10+. Enjoy!

I couldn't find red peppers, so used orange and yellow ones instead. I'm looking forward to using red ones, but can't imagine how much better this salad could taste.

I'm surprised other reviewers didn't like this as much. I thought it was excellent just the way it was, beautiful colors aside the grilled chicken in spiced yogurt sauce (both recipes came in my mailbox this week from Epicurious). First, to make this 100% easier and faster I used a purchased jar of already-roasted red and yellow peppers, sliced them into a bowl and finished the recipe. The only other thing I changed was to add some crumbled goat cheese on top for added flavor and color - superb!

I thought this recipe had fabulous ingredients but was fairly disappointed with the overall result. The flavor is quite overwhelming, though it became much more agreeable when served over a bed of salad greens. If I were to make this again I would turn the bacon drippings into a more traditional salad dressing and simply use the roasted pepper mixture as a tossed salad topper.

I buy lots of peppers when in season and roast them outside while reading on my deck. I peel them and put them in plastic sandwich bags, and put the sandwich bags in a freezer bag. They freeze beautifully, and take up little room in the freezer. Then you only need to defrost the desired amount, and they are a real treat in the winter.

We do not eat bacon but this recipe can easily be made w/out it. I added some balsamic vinegar instead.

This recipe was a bit labor intensive, (roasting and peeling the peppers, cooking the bacon...) but was very tasty. I'd make it again if for special guests, but not for everyday.
