My family has asked for this one again. The only change I made: substituted capers with a few green olives and a bit of lemon juice.

We make this at least once a month with the following alternations: we use salt-packed anchovies (which we keep on hand), a few tsp capers, add at least an extra TBSP olive oil, use whole Italian tomatoes without the juice in the can. (save and drink ... maybe spiked with vodka ...). Very satisfying.

Like many other reviewers I used anchovies and capers separately, but found that it was just fine. I also think the recipe makes a little more than the servings it suggests which is good! Would also be easy to double the recipe for more people. I'm adding this to the weeknight dinner rotation!

OK, I just re-read it - it said the opposite about the chunks. My bad!

Nice and very easy to prepare. I didn't have the anchovy/caper thing, so I used extra capers and it worked well. Next time I'll break up the tuna a bit more - took "leave in big chunks" too literally!

Great, quick summer dinner. The anchovies melt away but still add a lot of flavor. I used fresh but juicy tomatoes--plenty of liquid.

This was tasty and ridiculously simple to make. I didn't have the special anchovy rolls, but capers from a jar and anchovy fillets worked just fine. Try it; it's fast and delicious...It is simple, though, so make sure the pasta is good quality and al dente!

This is a super easy dish. Only addition I made was 3 tablespoons chopped sundried tomatoes. It took under 1/2 hour from start to finish, always a plus in a busy household

I suggest checking out Martha Stewart's recipe for Tuna and Farfalle Puttanesca. It's very tasty, if you like this kind of recipe, though it won't be as salty without the anchovies. Ugh, adding asparagus and peas sounds like a good way to mow over their delicate flavors with anchovies and capers. Doesn't sound very appealing to me.

If there was a rating between "like it, don't love it" and "delicious" that's where this would fall. It was fast and easy to make after work and I had all the ingredients in the cupboard, so I loved that part of it. I didn't have capers wrapped in anchovies so had to use a few anchovy filets and a spoonful of capers -- I may have overdone the capers a bit.

This was very easy to make and it tasted good. It could have benefited from additional fresh herbs.

This dish has become one of my camping staples. It is great to have something that tastes very good, is quick and easy and consists of shelf-stable ingredients.

All the ingredients I love somehow didn't come together in a friendly way for me, even though I carried out the recipe without any variations. Everything was just fine until I added the tuna! I'm sure that this was just personal taste -- my husband enjoyed it. If I make it again, it will be with a few additional anchovies (rinsed thoroughly so that there isn't too much salt) and more capers. I'll save the tuna for later!

Endless possiblities. I added a leek to the saute; asparagus to the pasta water to cook, then sliced it into the sauce; added a can of small peas. Reheats well in the micro for lunch.

Great recipe for a different and easy pasta dish. We'll follow the suggestion of this being a great gourmet camping dish; we'll make it next month on our annual foliage camping trip in Vermont. If you don't like anchovies, don't worry they only add great flavor. I added a medium chopped onion sauteed along with the shallots.

Salty, fishy, cheesy: Love it. Easy to make, and great as a leftover. Don't be afraid to experiment, either (add some fresh oregano or basil, for instance).

A nice light, easy meal for family that can be made from items you can easily keep on hand.
