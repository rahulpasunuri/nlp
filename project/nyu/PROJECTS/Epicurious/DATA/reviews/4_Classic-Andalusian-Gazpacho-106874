Try it with some fresh corn, off the cob; it's great with leftover corn.

Coriander is an even better spice for this recipe. Make as directed, substituting for cumin 1 teaspoon (or to taste) coriander seed, crushed in a mortar or spice grinder. I don't strain the soup and love the little bursts of flavor from the crushed seeds. Instead of the pepper garnish, top each serving with a light sprinkle of chopped coriander leaves and 5-6 small (1/2 inch) croutons toasted with olive oil. I've served this many times to raves.

Half the salt, half the olive oil and use either homegrown or farmer's market tomatoes and you will have a spectacular Gazpacho

I seeded the tomatoes first, and used half the salt - and we loved it. The sherry vinegar has a distinct flavor profile and I don't think you can really fake it with basalmic.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a good recipe, certainly tasty. I didn't strain it, but my puree in the blender was incredibly smooth so didn't need it. I didn't have sherry vinegar, so like another reviewer below, I did half Champagne and half balsalmic vinegar. I thought the result was a bit on the vinegary side, but I can't really say if this is a problem with the recipe as I subbed vinegars. The yield is pretty small. I ended up with 4 petite servings for my lunch party. If I were going to make this again and wanted it to be the main course of a lunch, I'd double the proportions.

Amazing flavor, really easy recipe! I just throw everything in the blender, don't bother with the smashing or straining. The texture turns out amazing and silky.

SO great. I couldn't find sherry vinegar (horror of horrors!) and subbed equal parts balsamic and red wine vinegars. We loved it, anyway! I made mine in a blender but strained it, anyway, and was glad I did. It really is like silk. (This won't be everyone's preference, of course; my boyfriend, for example, loved it but remarked on the lack of texture. Oh well.) Served it with the Sweet Onion Quesadillas from this site for a summer Southwestern riff on grilled cheese and tomato soup - rounded out by Coronas with lime, it was a wonderful meal that I'll make again.

One more thing - I always make this in the blender and have never tried straining it. I do seed the tomatoes, though.

I have made this recipe many times, always with freshly picked tomatoes, removing some of the seeds. Yesterday, I had several pounds of ripe tomatoes that fell off my tomato plants after hurricane Irene, and made a gallon and a half of soup. My modifications - I don't use any bread (prefer to be gluten free), I use half the olive oil and a little less salt, coconut sugar instead of table sutar, and was out of Sherry vinegar, so I used rice wine vinegar. Still tasted delicous. I will try freezing some and see how it holds up.

I'm systematically trying epicurious gazpachos and so far this is the winner! Couldn't find sherry vinegar, so I used moscatel vinegar. I don't know if that made a difference. I am usually a fan of chunkier gazpachos, but I found I liked the combination of flavors in this one. The neighbors liked it too!

For those of you who didn't strain the gazpacho, do try it. It creates the most wonderful velvety texture. I gave some to a local chef, and he used it as a fish sauce. Said it was a pefet Gazpacho Andaluz.

The tomatoes I had were not juicy enough, so I made the error of adding canned romas--don't do it! too too sweet. The taste before was sublime. After--might as well have been pasta sauce. Boo.

This is fantastic. I love the simplicity of this recipe. The texture is also very nice - not the chunky texture that makes you feel like you are eating cold salsa that restaurant gazpacho sometimes has. I made this with beautiful farmers market tomatoes and garlic which I'm sure contributed to its success. I wouldn't attempt this with the out of season, rock-hard tomato imposters that you get in the grocery store 11 months out of the year. This is a fantastic way to celebrate tomato season! Enjoy!

Fantastic! I had been trying to recreate the gazpacho we recently had in Barcelona and this was it! I used heirloom tomatoes, reserva sherry vinegar and one jalapeno. I did not add the cumin. It was incredible! I found that using the blender (rather than the food processor) without straining it made for an exceptionally, smooth, creamy soup (even though there is no cream in it). I made it for a dinner party and garnished each bowl with a tiny dice of yellow pepper and cucumber-- it was a huge hit. It was so popular that I made it again the next day for my mother.

Great base recipe, you can adjust garnishes to your liking. For those who did not strain, I understand the hassle and it does taste all right, but trust me, you will get a completely different experience if you go through the process of straining - it's totally worth it.

I've made this a lot. The reserva sherry vinegar and Andalusian hojiblanca oil are worth finding. And delicious tomatoes are a must. I find that I get as good results running the puree through a food mill instead of pressing through a sieve.

Just made this precisely as written. Wonderful, flavorful and very smooth. Very similar to the gazpacho at Jaleo's here in Washington. Much simpler than the gazpacho recipes that have you chopping tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, peppers, garlic, etc. Fast, easy and very very good

Unbelievable. The best gazpacho I've ever had.

Rating: 3
Here's the scoop! When you force this soup through a sieve it becomes tomato juice...perhaps my sieve was too fine. So, when I realized I'm going to be serving a fancy tomato juice I added the pulp which the recipe suggests to chuck out (ha are you joking it's delish). I added some of the pulp back into the soup to make it smooth and it was splendid.But of course, will make again. Writing from hot Thailand where cold soups are welcome...your fellow epicurean, Chubbychops.

This is even better the second day! I followed the recipe, but added some stuff to the food processor mixture: a peeled and seeded cucumber and a handful of fresh basil. I also used whole cumin seeds, which I just mashed up into the garlic. Served with crusty baguette. Delicious!!!

This is the closest gazpacho I've found to compete with the heaven I had in Spain a few years ago. I did make a few alterations in lieu of missing ingredients and personal tastes...I only had a nice Sherry wine so used 1T of that and one of red wine vinegar. Also added another garlic clove to increase the subtle kick. Will make this again and again!

Classic or not, this is great. I made it a few times this summer and never had any leftovers. The garlic is strong, so you may wish to reduce it. I did not strain it, originally out of laziness, and then because I enjoyed the texture and body resulting. Also, since I did not have the kind of vinegar called for, I used white balsamic.

This gazpacho was AMAZING!!! I used the ripest heirloom tomatoes in a variety of colors (orange, yellow, green, purple) and it was exactly the recipe needed to highlight the naturally sweet and fresh flavor of the fruit. For those who had trouble with solids I would recommend cutting the tomatoes in half crosswise then rubbing the cut sides of the tomatoes against the large holes of a box grater. Grate into a large bowl, reserving pulp. The skin will not go through and you can discard it without having to boil and peel tomatoes. After pureeing in the food processor I just gently shook the soup through a strainer and the only thing left behind were the seeds. Afterwards, I took others suggestions and tossed some avocado, lemon, oil and a pinch of the garlic/salt paste and pureed separately in a food processor. I then piped the mixture through a pastry bag to create small decorative avocado dollops. I then sprinkled finely minced red and yellow peppers and a bit of cucumber on top. The resulting colors and flavors were a big WOW!

I think this is a good soup, it turned out well even though I accidentally misread the recipe. {Sadly at 44 the eyes aren't what they used to be} and I accidentally added one TABLESPOON sugar, instead of a teaspoon of it. The soup still came out very good even though on the sweet side. Next time I will put in the correct sugar. I used Italian EVOO, its all I had on hand. I'm going to get the Andalusian kind in the future if I can find it.I also toasted the cumin seed before I ground it {as is done in Indian cooking} to bring out the flavor of the cumin. Tonight when I serve this I will use a little minced jalapeno for some kick and to counteract the over sweetness I accidentally created by accidentally adding to much sugar. I blanched the tomatoes, removed skin and used a food mill to de-seed the tomatoes. I put the soup through and ordinary mesh strainer at the very end which resulted in a fine texture.I know I will be making this soup many more times in the future!

As a garnish I used a previous reviewers idea of avocado/lemon puree, and also dropped a little bit of blue cheese into each bowl. So refreshing and delightful!

Super easy, made it twice. Made it once in the blender because my food processor was dirty. Did not strain. Perfection! One time I left out the olive oil and almost liked it better because tomatoes were tip top - then I topped with 2 kinds of olive oil - homemade basil oil and olive oil blended with roasted garlic. My fave gazpacho. Never have done the garnish though I love the silky texture with a toasted baguette.

This was really really good. I added some cayenne pepper before chilling to give it a little kick. This definitely made a difference. Took it to a going away party with about 100 guests, and everyone loved it. Some insisted I give them the recipe. I served it in little individual cups and garnished with avocado, red bell pepper, green onions or cucumber. A big hit!

Excellent results. This also reminded me of my time in Seville, winding the close-circuit, Arabic streets looking for a bar or restaurant with a small, blackboard sign scrawled with "Gazpacho hoy." --Used a water-soaked mini-croissant (2 inches long) instead of the French bread and some organic Italian olive oil (this is only variation I would forego, there is nothing that compares to the subtle, rich taste of Andalusian olive oil) but otherwise stuck to the recipe. As always with gazpacho, only fresh, local, homegrown tomatoes will do.

My changes: I doubled the recipe, but used only 1/2 tsp cumin for the entire batch, added _no_ olive oil, and did not use peppers as a garnish. Now that that's over...This recipe is to DIE for. Like most people, I enjoy a good gazpacho on occasion, but this--this I could live on. Die, live, I realize I'm being contradictory here. Let's put it this way: I want to eat this every day for the rest of my life! Since andalusian gazpacho is meant to highlight olive oil in addition to tomato and sherry vinegar, this is what I did for a garnish: I pureed the flesh from one avocado with a bit of fresh lemon juice and olive oil (enough of each so that both can be tasted in the mixture). Then I dumped it in a ziploc, cut off the tip, and squeezed a pinwheel design onto the center of the soup. In the center of the pinwheel, I put a few drops of olive oil. The result is a less fatty soup that still delivers the fruity punch of a good olive oil. I can guarantee that I'll be making this again and again. You should too. Just be sure to let the tomatoes ripen well before using them, so you can really appreciate this soup!

This was exceptional. I added red pepper flakes and mixed it in a high powered blender (no straining necessary). Used red wine vinegar, didn't have the sherry vinegar. After it chilled I added chopped scallions, green pepper, more tomato in small pieces and cucumber. Delicious!

This is my family's prefered basic Gazpacho. I make this often in the summer. The only change I make is that I set aside 1/4 of the tomatoes, chop them fine and add them to the soup with some finely chopped cucumber and red pepper. If you do this, you don't really need to sieve the soup but, I do sometimes because it looks nicer.

Rating: 4
This is exactly like the gazpacho I ate in Spain. Seeding the tomatoes over a sieve and soaking the bread in the resulting tomato water creates more flavor and no seeds makes the final product easier to sieve. (Seeding and peeling makes the sieving a cinch.) Do try to get sherry vinegar; it makes a huge difference. Also, do sieve it. It really improves the texture. A professional chef tried mine, made exactly to the recipe, and served it in his restaurant.

I'm testing recipes to make a lot of for my wedding (which will be in the peak of summer). I used whole peeled tomatoes from a can, doubled the amount of bread, added 1/2 cucumber and since I couldn't find Sherry vinegar, used 1 tbsp sherry wine and 1 tbsp balsamic. It had a lot of tang which was a hit with my fiancé. It came out a little thicker than I wanted though. Next time, less bread.

This was fabulous! I boiled the tomatoes for 15 seconds as a previous cook suggested to make them easy to peel. Since I was peeling, might as well core them. The only solids I had when straining were seeds. Also reduced the cumin to 1/4 tsp. Added a subtle, but not obvious, flavor. Garnished with cucumbers and avocados. Everyone wanted seconds!

Everyone loves this recipe on hot summer days. There's nothing like fresh farmers' market tomatoes, but canned tomato sauce is decent if you're in a rush or get tired of removing the seeds; sometimes I do half and half to save some time but still have that fresh taste. I don't bother to strain out the bread. I also like to add a small amount of chopped avocados, cucumbers, and red onion for texture and color.

This is a wonderful gazpacho, which should only be made with the freshest, tastiest tomatoes. You won't have any trouble pureeing and straining solids if you first drop the tomatoes in boiling water for 10-15 seconds and then peel them. The strained version is beautiful, but it tastes just as good if you don't bother to strain it. Just remember to peel the tomatoes first.

I made this with some lovely beefsteak tomatoes from the farmers' market. I used a plastic colander to push the solids through (after a messy and unsuccessful attempt with a mesh sieve)...no problem. The soup was wonderful and full of flavor, even without the pepper garnish. My guests raved.

I made this recipe using early season tomatoes from my local farmer's market and it was fabulous! Some posters noted they had trouble with straining the solids but I pureed the soup in a blender (rather than a food processor) and strained it through a metal sifter. The texture was heavenly, smooth and rich. Next time I would add a bit more sherry vinegar, and maybe roast the garlic first to take the slightly bitter edge off the soup. All around, a delicious and easy summer recipe!

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for in a traditional gazpacho. It has strong, clean flavor - perfect for summer. As I read through other reviews I noted the challenge of managing the solids. I am sure I broke some rule somewhere but I found that using a hand held plunger blender that I use for making other soups worked for me. I avoided using the seive and the soup came out smooth enough to me and my guests.

Heaven! Being lazy I had to substitute balsamic for sherry vinegar, reduced the salt and olive oil, skinned tomatoes first and skipped the sieve process. Wonderful flavor--olive oil makes it.

To me this is real gazpacho ... to some V-8 blended with chilantro, cukes, peppers is gazpacho because that is what you get in most american restaurants. This is a great recipe when you have the ingredients - fresh ripe tomatoes and leftover bread. The simplicity of the recipe is what makes it great. Fresh tomatoe with a strong garlic background and subtle sherry balance. This is a smooth soup - great ice cold - but is some work to strain the liquids. Tonight, I think i am gonna try the avacado addition a previous poster recommended - they too are in season. I would order gazpacho out more if it were made like this recipe !

Using fresh organic tomatoes the flavor was superb. I loved the simplicity, texture and color. I used minced yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced cucumbers and fresh coriander for accompaniments. i served a rice/pine-nut/raisin pilaf at the same meal and one guest, after asking if i would mind, started a trend of scooping the pilaf into the soup bowl. it was tasty this way!

This was a winner. I have also made it with canned, diced tomatoes when fresh tomatoes were not available. Two cans of diced tomatoes with juice, two cloves of garlic, and all the other ingredients (minus the cumin)are dumped in a blender and pureed. I have no need to strain. I offer diced green pepper, diced onion and diced cucumber, all in serving dishes, as garnishes. It has been well received by family and guests.

This is an excellent gazpacho recipe. It was pretty easy to make (I pureed my tomatoes in a blender). It has a really Summer flavor and a lovely creamy consistency. I served it with some home made fresh herbed croutons and finely diced cucumber and green onions. If you want a healthy sized portion I would suggest doing 1.5 - 2 X the ingredients for 4.
