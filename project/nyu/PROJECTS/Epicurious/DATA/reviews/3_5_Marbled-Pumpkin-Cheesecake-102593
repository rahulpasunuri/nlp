Was YUMMY!! Made it for my husband's wine club as they were tasting dessert wines. Was a hit! I did bake it in a larger pan so it wasn't quite as tall. Baked at 450 for a while and turned it down. It did crack but cracks didn't deter from the amazing flavour!

This cheesecake has become part of our new Thanksgiving tradition. The only change I've made is to make the crust from gingersnaps, almonds and coconut oil instead of butter. Friends have actually requested that I make this to bring to their holiday gatherings. It's really very easy and a big winner every year!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. 550 degrees cooked the cake to a nice charcoal consistency. It tastes ok and I can see how it would be very delicious, but...I am not going to charbroil it the next time.

This was delicious but the recipe neglects to tell you the size pan to use. I used a 9 inch but nxt time I think I would use 8 inches. Also i think it would be better to reserve more of the plain batter so that the marbling is more apparent

I made this for our company Thanksgiving feast and it was a HUGE hit. The owner of our company, who doesn't like pumpkin, loved it! I think it's pretty darn tasty as well! :) I made litte cheesecakes in muffin papers as they are easier to serve than a whole cake at an event such as this. Yes I baked them at 350 NOT 550 for about 27 min.

I have been making this every year (up to 5 times a year...I know, I know) for the past 9 years. It is one of my best and favorite recipes. It looks gorgeous--I've mastered the knack of making the marbling look like a big flower on top--and it tastes like the best, creamiest pumpkin pie you've ever had. Simply divine. I started out making it precisely as written. Currently the alterations I make are 1) graham cracker crust of 1.5 c crumbs, 5.5 T melted butter, 1/3 c brown sugar; 2) double the spices, 3) bake at 350 (I firmly believe 550 was a typo) for 20 min, then 200 for 1 hr 20 min, then turn off oven and leave in unopened oven for 20 min. I make it in a springform pan, so it's important to loosen the sides with a wet knife as soon as it comes out of the oven then let is slowly cool on the counter to room temp before putting it in the fridge--never cracks that way. I have probably been asked for this recipe almost 2 dozen times. Enjoy.

I have to say first & foremost, I love to experiment with different flavors of cheesecakes. It is my husband's favorite dessert so last night for his birthday I made this cheesecake. It did NOT disappoint :o) I followed the recipe to a T, although when the directions told me to bake the crust until crisp, I ended up baking it a little too long so the edges got burnt. Hate it when that happens! I would only bake it just as long as the recipe says. Don't worry about the crust crisping. I think it will do that on its own as you let it cool.

Simply delicious!!!!! The flavor, texture and look are extraordinary. I places a baking dish with water to prevent cracking and it worked perfectly. TRY IT.

Excellent cheesecake! Glad I read the reviews first and started at a lower temperature. To all the chefs out there - maybe you can help with one question: Why didn't my cheesecake marble? (all the pumpkin part sank to the bottom and the white part all floated to the top).

Love this recipe! I'm a novice at cheesecakes but this was easy! I actually used the Girl Scout Cookie Lemon Cheesecake crust recipe instead of the one suggested, but substituted 1/2 the shortbread for ginger snaps and added a pinch of salt- yum! I also made cupcakes instead of a large cake. I followed the advice to switch the baking time, and only baked them at 300 for 35 minutes since they were cupcakes. And I added the extra cinnamon as a previous review suggested. They were delicious!

My family and I loved this cheesecake. Very easy to make and tastes better than a really expensive one from Cheesecake Factory! I didn't have a problem with a soggy crust and I did follow others' suggestions regarding changing the cooking time slightly. I will be making this one for many more fall dinners to come!

I have made this cheesecake three or four years in a row now for Thanksgiving. I have always followed the directions on the recipe (start at 550) and it's turned out just fine. This year I got nervous and followed the 350 for 20 min and then 300 for 1.5 hrs. The cheesecake doesn't have the same yummy color on top and I'm a little nervous about the middle being cooked... but the edges started to crack. Oh well - I'm sure it will taste great no matter what!

I make this recipe often because people go absolutely nuts over it. Better than any pumpkin pie. I double the spices and forget the foil. I cook 20min at 350, 1h 30min at 200, then turn off oven for another 20min. Cool and chill slowly so it doesn't crack. make sure that center doesn't actually wobble very much or you'll end up with pudding. This recipe is one of my most requested around the holidays.

Excellent! I followed the advice from previous reviewers and cooked at 350F for 20 minutes and then lowered oven to 300F for another 1:30 minutes and it came out great. I used a regular graham cracker crust and served with homemade whipped cream. Was loved by all and I'm planning to make it again soon!!

I made this for our Christmas dinner and it turned out wonderfully. I took into consideration many of the suggestions below, including the cook from Maple Valley's suggestion to add more vanilla and cinnamon, as well as many suggestions to set more plain filling aside than the recipe says. I am also very thankful to all the previous reviews that pointed out the error of the cooking instructions and one in particular that offered something better. It is below, but I will quote it here as well: "Do not bake this as instructed. Instead, do the following: 350F for 20 minutes; then 300F for 1:40 minutes; then crack the oven door, turn the oven off, and let sit for 20 minutes. No need to dome. by lcshih1 from Loren on 11/25/08" This worked beautifully. I have one question, is there a trick to keeping the crust from turning into a slimy mess? Mine looked almost carmelized when I removed the cake from the pan, not really a crumb crust anymore.

Rating: 3
This is one of my favorite recipes and I feel the marbling effect sets it apart from other cheesecakes and is worth the effort. I agree with the too much pumpkin batter and not enough white batter issue so I make it with equal parts of each instead. I also add double the vanilla and triple the cinnamon to my pumpkin batter and it's delicious. As for my crust, I use 1/2 Ginger Snaps and 1/2 Vanilla Wafers crushed together for the most delicious and perfectly balanced (not too spiced like Ginger Snaps alone) flavor. I also drizzle warm caramel sauce over the beautiful, marbled masterpiece when serving for an irresistable holiday favorite. Enjoy!

I also made this for Thanksgiving, using the modified directions below, and it was PERFECT! Everyone liked it so much that I'm making it again today for my sons' birthdays. I mixed the batters instead of marbling (just to save time), convection baked at 350 for 20 minutes, then 300 for 1 hour 20 min. and it was done. I was able to take it out of the oven at that point. You need to test with a toothpick since every oven is a little different. It seems that most people cooked it a bit longer than I did. All I can say is it was delicious! The crumb crust (using gingersnaps) was also easy & tasty.

Rating: 2
The flavor of the batter is delicious and the marbling is a good idea, but as others have noted here, the directions to start it at 550 is way off. I also burnt the top. The poster's directions from Loren below sound right. Start aat 350 for 20 minutes, then at 300 for an 1hr and 40 minutes. That should be just right. I also ended up w/way too much pumpkin batter and not enough of the plain. Try, as the other poster notes below, only reserving 1 adn 3/4 c of the batter to mix w/the pumpkin. I think it's worth trying again, though. But, this recipe's been on this board since 1999 and it clearly needs some editing!

I don't know what happened to my review, but I'm determined to write it again so that everyone will be forewarned. My daughter and I made this our Thanksgiving dessert---and I wouldn't serve it to my dog. DO NOT cook at 500 degrees. DO NOT. The top burned within four minutes. We were so dissapointed. I am going out to buy the ingredients again and will find a different recipe. It's a lot of work for such a dissapointing outcome. Ruined our day when we are busy in the kitchen with so many other things. Shame on this website for not adjusting the cooking temperatures.

What a dissapointment. My daughter and I set out to make this together for our Thanksgiving dessert. With the oven at 500 degrees (what ridiculous instructions) the top completely burned within the first ten minutes. A lot of hard work for a burned cheesecake. I'm going to the store to re-buy the ingredients and find a different recipe. I wouldn't serve this to my dog. We were both pretty sad about it. I am an experienced cook. I should have known better than to put in a cake at over 500 degrees.

Do not bake this as instructed. Instead, do the following: 350F for 20 minutes; then 300F for 1:40 minutes; then crack the oven door, turn the oven off, and let sit for 20 minutes. No need to dome. I decorated the top with the epicurious candied pecans recipe.

Modified baking directions - 20 minutes at 350F, then 1:40 minutes at 300, then leave the oven open a crack. No need to dome. I decorated the top with the candied pecans recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Candied-Pecans-107621) I ended up a lot more pumpkin than white cheesecake. Next time, I will transfer 2.75 cups instead of 2.5 cups.

This was my first cheese cake and I baked it according to the original directions. It's actually a welcome reprieve from the kind of work that I am used to doing for my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. The cheese cake is currently cooling and looks like it will be wonderful. It certainly smell delicious. Although next time I think that I will lower the initial temperature since the top looks a little dark. I made the recipe with splenda so we'll see how the flavor turns out. I'm such a huge fan of cheese cake though that it will have to be a disaster for me not to like it. I will definitely try it again

After reviewing all the baking suggestions, I decided to go with the lady who lives across the Sound from me - Seattle. I followed the baking directions excactly and the cake looked fine when I turned off the oven and opened the door slightly. After 20 minutes, the cake had sunk in the middle and a large crack formed across the top. A day later I bravely removed the sides of the cake pan to find the crust very soggy. I don't have time to try again so will bake a pie and let my guests decide if the cheesecake is eatable. My oven is new so that isn't the problem.

Made this cheesecake for the sole purpose of using up left over pumpkin from the weekend. It's quite tasty. I made the base with graham crumbs only, and chilled it for about two hours prior to cooking (as I do with all cheesecakes). I then followed suggestions made by others and it worked out nicely. I baked it at 350F for 20 min, then at 300F for 1hr 40 min. Then turned the oven off and let the cake sit with the door cracked for 20 more minutes. Many people have cooked the cake this way and it works out well. I think my oven is a little to hot though (top was a little darker than I prefer), and will probably cook it less next time.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving last year in Barcelona, Spain, with a very temperamental oven. I played around with the temperatures (hard when having to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius), and although it took a little longer than expected, it came out great and was a hit with all our friends - Americans, South Americans and Europeans. Such a hit, in fact, that I've been asked to make it for my mother-in-law's Christmas dinner this year!

Brought this into work today and it was a huge success! Followed Seattle's suggested cooking times and not pre-cooking the crust and the consistency was perfect. I did have a little soggy crust on the bottom (the sides stayed crunchy) and the top did crack but it still tasted delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

Here's another endorsement for reading the reviewers' comments prior to baking this cheesecake. We opted for baking at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, then 200 degrees for 1:20 and then 20 minute in the cooling oven). While we avoided the burnt crust disaster, the whole thing was mushy in the end -- it was tasty, but made for a sloppy presentation. We'll give it another shot, futzing with the baking temps and times.

I have been making this cheesecake since the recipe was published in 1999, and my family has come to expeted it on most major holidays. I use regular graham crackers for the crust (not a fan of gingersnaps) and like one of the other reviewers I omit the marbling factor - I simply add the pumpkin to the creamcheese mixture. I've played with the cooking times/temps, and although I haven't used the combos Seattle suggests, that lookas about right. This is a simple, elegant, rich-tasting dessert that belongs in everyone's repertoire.

I'm the one who burned my crust a few messages back. The crust was so burnt, we decided we just couldn't serve it. I was going to try a different (faster) recipe, until we ate the filling. WOW! It was so fantastic, I decided to try again with the temperatures everyone else advised. So, now I'm serving a fabulous "perfect" cheesecake. Made in the wee hours of the morning. I'm tired, but dessert will be terrific!

Okay, so this was my first time cooking from epicurious.com. I didn't scroll down to read the reviews until after I put the cheesecake in the oven. Big Mistake going with the recipe cooking instructions. Crust burnt, sides burnt, top burnt. I was a sad girl, until I decided to scrape off everything burnt, scoop the guts into brulee dishes, and carmelize the tops. So, ladies and gents, if you're like me, and you didn't realize there would be advice on how to cook this cheesecake that wasn't in the recipe, take heart. No one you serve it to will know the difference.

This was the very first cheesecake that I ever made. I am an accomplished chef and I can not even make a boxed cake. Simple and precise easy to follow recipe. After 6 years, have adapted and omitted the marbleing factor. If you do not use a steam bath to cook the cake and it cracks, a white chocolate ganache or simple light cream cheese topping will not hurt but only enhance your final outcome!!!! Absolutely WONDERFUL!!!

IF YOU'RE MAKING THIS FOR THANKSGIVING...be warned! Read all the reviews and adjust your cooking times and temperature! Normally, I do this, but tonight, was in a great hurry to get this done before travelling. I am in the process of making this right now...and have sadly burned my crust to a crisp!! I just came back to check what other reviewers have said, and of course, see that many have recommended a completely different cooking temperature and time! I think the recipe should be adjusted to save people from making a huge mistake. I have no time to make a new dessert, so I'll have to serve this and hope people can overlook the burned black edges... I must say, despite the edges it looks great! Will submit again to let you know how it tastes...

I too used Seattle's cooking times and it came out perfect. I piped whipped cream on top, and then dusted it with pumpkin pie spice. I then drizzled warm caramel topping across it. I took it to work to a potluck and had quite a few people question that it was not store bought! I've promised my kids that we'll have this for Thanksgiving!

This is a great cheesecake...I used Seattle's baking times and it came out perfect.

Everyone loved it!!

Oh wow, is this good! And it has such a beautiful presentation. Do not precook the crust - it will get too hard. I baked it at 350 for 20 min, then at 300 for 1hr 40 min, then I turned the oven off and let the cake sit with the door cracked for 20 more minutes. It came out perfect!

This was great cheesecake! Wonderful flavor and texture! My guests loved it and ate every bit on their plates! The only thing I changed was I made an all-graham cracker crust using 2 cups of crumbs with 1 stick melted butter and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. I baked it for 1 hour at 350 degrees, then opened the oven door and let it sit for another hour before chilling. The cheesecake was a tad soft in the center, so I will bake it an extra 10-15 minutes longer next time. I will definitely make this again!

This cheesecake is always a hit (I usually take it to friends' house during the holidays). I do not follow the baking instructions, either. I typically bake it for 50 minutes at 350 then turn off the oven, prop the door open, and let it sit in there for about an hour as the oven cools. It's come out perfect every single time.

I read the comments on problems with the recipe's baking instructions, and also followed Loren's baking times, and did not use a bain marie. The resulting color, texture, and density was perfect. I also added a handful of crushed pecans in the crust, and used 1 1/4 tsp pumpkin spice in place of the specified spices. It was absolutely delicious. Everybody loved it. The only problem was that the crust was a bit soggy and stuck to the bottom of the springform pan at a few spots, and I couldn't get it to slide off the pan. Would baking the crust before filling it make a difference?

This cheesecake was AWESOME!! I brought it to a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! I used 1 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice than what the spices were in the recipe. You could add more or less depending on taste. Someone said it was even better than Cheesecake Factory. This will have a recurring role at holiday dinners.

I have made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving for the past three years and love the flavors. I have never followed the recipe's baking instructions because they seem to nervewracking. This year I followed Loren's advice, but my cake was very underdone at the end of the the cake's rest in the oven. I baked it at 300 for 40 extra minutes, and then it was fine, even though the crust stuck to the pan in a few places and was soft in others. I wish epicurious would revamp the cooking times, so we could all rely on a sound recipe. I won't give up hope on this one though. My family loves it!

Delicious. The texture was perfect because I followed the instructions given in blue text by the cook from Loren-350 for 20 minutes then 1 hour 20 minutes at 200 then turn oven off and leave cheesecake in for another 20. It was really an excellent flavor and had a nice creaminess.

Rating: 4
This was really delicious - many rave reviews from my coworkers, who are often willing guinea pigs when I try new recipes. I used Sucanat (evaporated cane juice) instead of regular sugar, and the molassass-like flavor of the Sucanat tastes great with the pumpkin and spices. I don't eat a lot of sugar, so it tasted just right to me, although some people commented that they liked it because it wasn't too sweet. I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes and then 200 for an hour and 20 minutes as recommended by several people, and it was very soupy. I ended up putting it back in the oven the next morning at 325 for about 40 minutes and the texture was perfect. I'll have to play around with the cooking times and temps a little more. I don't think I'll be making pumpkin pie again!

Excellent cheesecake. Here are my recommendations after having read all the other reviews: 1) I use 350 for 20 minutes then 200 for 1:20 then leave it to cool in the oven for another 20. You can fast cook it at 350 for one hour, but I find slow cooking to give much better results, unless you're in a rush for some reason. 2) I suspect 550 was to brown the top as to get the effect shown in the picture, but I do not think it is necessary and you're more liable to burn the cheesecake this way. I've never seen any cheesecake (let alone normal) recipe call for scorching it at 550. 3) I baked this twice, once using a waterbath at 325, there was no appreciable difference. Cheescakes aren't particularly picky, there are a hundred variations from other reviewers that all probably should work equally well. 4) Unlike one reviewer, I did not find the cheesecake too sweet with the stated sugar. 5) Add some crushed pecans to the crust. 6) The crust should not crack at all. Just be sure to follow the directions to loosen the cake so that it can bend inward slightly as it cools, this will prevent it from cracking. Do not bake the crust beforehand.

Adjusted temps per others' recommendations and it worked out perfectly. This was my first cheesecake and I was surprised at how easy it was to make.

I am going to have to try the cooking method on this again. I have a convect oven, and usually I can do my cheesecake for one hour and it turns out perfectly. But I thought I would try the 350 and then 200 (adjusted for convection), and it was soupy at the end. So I put it back in for half an hour at 325, and it came out fine. I will go back to just baking my cheesecake for one hour at 325. I did love the taste of the cake, and it was a hit on Thanksgiving. It really tastes alot more like pumpkin pie than cheesecake. I used the gingersnap crust recipe from the pumpkin cheesecake with caramel swirl, and also did the topping that that recipe calls for (the sour cream, sugar, whipped cream, and caramel).

This is a great recipe! The consistency and flavors are wonderful. If you like pumpkin, you will love this. It is very simple to make if you follow the instructions. I agree that the baking times should be 1 hour and 20 min. @ 200 and then follow-up with 20 minutes at 350. Mine looked just like the picture! You will know it is done by the golden color. Highly recommend! Just made it for Thanksgiving 2002! A BIG HIT!!!

The taste was delicious, but I would modify a couple of things before making again. Less sugar (1/4 c less), more spices (1/4 tsp each at least), and MUCH longer cooking time! The texture was super-soft, and the crust was soggy (made it the night before). The swirls make for a nice presentation.

Well, let's just say my once stellar reputation for providing good Thanksgiving dessert is in serious jeopardy after bringing this cheesecake to the party. The crust was well received but the cheesecake itself was soupy despite spending over two hours in the oven on two separate occasions. It probably didn't help matters when the family fox terrier jumped in the middle of the cheesecake and proved its sad softness.

Great dessert! The flavor isn't too sweet and not as heavy as other cheesecakes. I am disappointed in the actual recipe where it says to bake at 550. Being a first time cheesecake maker, I followed the directions to a "tee" and then realized it was burning my crust. I then threw that away and am re-doing the recipe with the tips of 350 for 20 then 200 for an 1:20 etc. It is going to be a Thanksgiving tradition! By the way, you don't need to bake the crust -- it is perfect! HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!

VERY nice!! This is an awesome cheesecake. The combination of pumpkin and cream cheese is fabulous, one I have enjoyed in other types of desserts such as pumpkin roll with cream cheese filling. If you like that sort of thing you will love this. I used the crust from Pumpkin Cheesecake with Bourbon Sour Cream Topping on Epicurious with the 1/2 chopped pecans and 3/4 cup crushed honey grahams. It is the perfect crust to accompany the other flavors when you also add some cinnamon and a little salt. I increased the spices for the filling also. My boyfriend was mad when I told him I was taking the leftovers to my parents for them to sample! I still got a crack right down the middle even though I used the pan of water in the bottom of the oven for steam, but it had no bearing whatsover on the outstanding taste and texture. No burnt crust. Baked at 350 for 1 and a half hours, then let cake cool in turned off oven overnight. My cheesecakes always crack no matter what.

This cheesecake is delicious! A perfect amount of pumpkin flavor mixed in with the cheesecake. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it came out perfect. Definately use the Gingersnap and Pecan crust from the Pumpkin Cheesecake Caramel Swirl recipe on this site. It goes very well with this recipe. As others suggested, I reduced the oven temp to 350 for 15 min. and 300 for another hour. This cheesecake will take center stage on my Thanksgiving table this year.

I had never heard of baking a cheese cake at such a high temp and did not follow the baking directions. I have been baking cheese cake for about 20 yrs and have always placed the spring pan in a larger pan filled with hot water and a little cream of tartar. It keeps the top moist and prevents cracks. This recipe would benefit from it as well.

When I got past the "burned" parts, it was delicious and I'd definitely make it again. My husband is a chef and recomends that someone out there who is responsible for submitting this recipe should make sure that preheating the oven to 550 degrees is revised. He's never heard of any cake, cheese or otherwise, be baked for any amount of time at that temperature. 350 would be more like it.

This is a very good cheesecake. A little sweet. I think I'll cut down on the sugar next time. I ignored the cooking instructions, they seemed too fussy. I started at 350 for 15 minutes. Then I lowered the temperture to 300 for about an hour. Turned out excellent.

Amazingly delicious! I got a little pumkin from the Farmer's market, roasted, pureed and seasoned it. I also used the gingersnap/pecan crust from the caramel swirl pumpkin cheesecake instead. My husband doesn't particularly like cheesecake and has never liked pumpkin but he loved this.

Different from the same-old pumpkin. I've made this twice, once using low-fat cream cheese and once using regular. I actually liked the low-fact better (an extraordinary result for a more-fat-better-taste person like myself). Salt in crust should be 1/8 t. (it's a typo). At 550, the crust burned; 450 was much better.

This was my first cheesecake -- I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect!! only thing was that there was too much batter for my pan -- so I ended up making an additional six cupcakes. It was filling and rich, so cut small slices!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. Do not pre-bake the crust; it isn't necessary.

This came out beautifully. Everyone thought I had bought it and was shocked that I had actually made such a gorgeous AND delicious cake. I used fat free cream cheese and it still came out creamy and smooth. Next time I will use less butter for the crust as it came out a bit mushy. I'll also put more cinnamon in it. It took a lot time and effort to make but was definitely worth it!

This was a great recipe! I used the gingersnap crust recipe and had the same problem of burning my crust. I'll have to try it next time at 500 degree. For those who want to reduce fat, I used 2pks of 8oz low fat cream cheese and 1pk of 8oz fat free cream cheese and the cheesecake turned out great! Still creaming and had strong cheesecake flavor.

Delicious!! What a treat and a nice change from serving a traditional pumpkin pie. There were only 4 of us at Thanksgiving and by Saturday this whole cheesecake was polished off! Great flavor!

Great recipe for Thanksgiving dessert!! one thing I would change: cook the cake for less time for the 550°F temperature... the crust turns black along the baking.

I tried this recipe a number of years when it was originally in the magazine and have been searching for it. I took it to a dinner party and it was a BIG HIT! My picky husband swelled with pride when what he knew to be a disaster turned out to be such a success. Even though I am not a gourmet cook - I found it simple enough to do & now that I have found this recipe again & will make it for my new pumpkin loving husband!

I made this dessert for Thanksgiving - and even my sweetie who has a very very discerning and picky palette loved it. It's very rich so only a little over half was eaten and some even had seconds. I didn't use any salt for the crust and cooked it at 500 instead of 550 for 12 min on the second shelf from the top, then moved it down after the 30 mins at 200. The crust was perfect. I will makes this dish again and again. I was sooooo gooooood.

This was a big hit on Thanksgiving day! (2001) My sister-in-law took a small sliver and asked did you taste this? She said it was the best of both worlds--tasting like cheesecake and pumpkin pie! I also used gingersnaps for the crust and think that it gave it an added zip.

Excellent recipe!! I love all things pumpkin, but my husband doesn't. This recipe however, made his list of favorites. It is now a Thanksgiving must.

This is a good recipe. I make it because I can substitute Splenda for the regular white sugar (versus recipes which call for brandy, carmel, etc..) for my diabetic mother at Thanksgiving. But if you are looking for the end all pumpkin cheesecake, look at the Sour Cream, Bourbon, Pumpkin Cheesecake. My friends literally beg for it at every occasion (even in the summer!). P.S. if you do make the Sour Cream, Bourbon, Pumpkin Cheesecake - try using Grand Marnier instead of Bourbon... to die for.

Fabulous cheesecake. I added some extra pumpkin pie spice and used the crust recipe from Pumpkin Cheesecake with Caramel Swirl, because it sounded more interesting (gingersnaps and pecans). My husband specifically commented on the delicious crust.

This cheesecake was fabulous!!!!! Even the ones who don't like cheesecake loved it. I will definitely make it again this year. Hard to beat.

Excellent and interesting cheesecake. I also encountered problems with the high heat which burned the crust on the bottom. A solution can be to place it higher in the oven or put it on high heat for less time.

I'm amazed that anyone didn't like this cheesecake! If you like cream cheese, you'll LOVE this. I solved the early high temp problem by putting the cake in at 450 for 15 minutes, then bake at 225 for 90 minutes. I've done it twice now and it's worked great. I also use Neufchatel cheese to reduce the guilt. A Thanksgiving must!

This is fantasy fulfilled of the perfect pumpkin cheesecake ever! It was also the first cheesecake I ever made. After heeding the advice of those who have made this recipe before me, I didn't put it in the oven for very long with the high temp. I have made it twice, and both times it was devoured by the hordes. Everyone who has tasted it has begged me for the recipe. It is both elegant and impressive to look at and dwarfs all other desserts. People forget about the other pies and cakes. This is my new secret weapon for Thanksgiving.

This was magnificient. If you like pumpkin and gingersnaps this is defintely a keeper. It was easy to make and received nothing but raves.

I have to agree with the cook from Vancouver. This cheesecake is AWFUL! I took it to Thanksgiving dinner, thinking it would be wonderful. I served it up; we all took a bite and threw the rest of it out! The flavor was horrible. The crust was horrible. Don't waste your time or money on this one.

This cheesecake was great! My non-pumpkin loving husband devoured it as did our other (non American) guests! Definitely would make again. The gingersnap crust received raves as well. Was a bit of an expense given the fact that cream cheese must be imported, but well worth it.

I want to let everyone know that this is an award-winning recipe! I made it for the first time as a contest entry - the only rule of the contest was that it must contain pumpkin. My only experience with pumpkin has been with the traditional pie, and pumpkin bread. At the suggestion of my cousin, I logged onto Epicurious.com to find something new and exciting to enter in the contest. I was totally up in the air as to what I would choose. The cheesecake sounded great, so that was my choice. The cheesecake is time consuming, and a somewhat delicate operation. I say this, because as I was slipping the cake into the refrigerator at the end of the entire process, the cake began to slip from the plate. I had to grab the cake on top with my whole hand to stop it from slipping to the floor. This frantic grab left a huge and deep handprint in the top of the cake. I was just sick about it and almost didn't enter it in the contest. After consulting with friends, decided to do my best to camouflage the sunken in area: Just before judging was to begin, I sprayed "a whole lot" of Reddi-Whip over the hand, and then went around the edges of the cake with the same stuff. Sprinkled chopped pecans and orange and brown sprinkles around the edges also. (I know this sounds tacky but it looked quite nice - contest was just before Halloween too, which worked out well for me. Ha!) Imagine my shock when I was told that I had won first place and comments were made about the delightful blending of flavors and the smooth and rich texture. Go for it! This is a great recipe. (I also made it this past Thanksgiving and it made a big hit with the family.) Bon Appetit! Betty

An easy to make cheesecake with great results. It was a hit at Christmas with my family. My nephew had at least 3 pieces and went home with at least one more!

This was SOOO good. I made it for Christmas instead of the traditional Pumpkin Pie and it has become the new tradition in our family!

I really didn't like this recipe. The crust was soggy and very unappetizing which could be the result of having been stored in the fridge for 3 days (even though the note says you can store for up to one week chilled and covered). The only upside to this recipe was the amazing smell while it was baking - will only make it again once I decide to sell my house. If only it tasted like it smelled!

This was a pretty easy recipe to make and I liked the pumpkin cheesecake flavor - especially with the ginger snap crust. I would slightly increase the spices, however. My only gripe is that the cake kind of all clumped together when cutting it for desert - perhaps it was slightly undercooked, I'm not sure. Would definitely try it again.

Took this to a family gathering. It was a great hit even though I had left the egg yolks out of the pumpkin portion of the recipe and was consequently a tad runny. I topped with sweetened sour cream included in many other recipes and pecan praline included with the pumpkin pecan cheesecake recipe.

Rating: 4
Very easy to make. I made the mistake (even though I read the reviews beforehand) of using the 3/4 teaspoon salt in the crust -- definitely too much! I followed Amy's tips (below) and baked it at 525 for 15 min. then followed the recipe exactly. I baked it in a convection oven and the top browned a little bit too much on one edge but otherwise perfect! A hit with the children and my husband.

This is a very good recipe. I found 550 to be way too high though for the top of the cheesecake - it burns. I instead baked it initially at 450 for 12 minutes which worked much better.

This recipe is wonderful, raves from everyone. However, I also found that the recipe needed much more time in the oven, and that the crust did burn- recipe does need adjustment in the time. I added a bit more spice, and used low-fat cream cheese- worked well. Would make again.

Very good, especially with the gingersnap crust. Easily served twelve - a little goes a long way.

This was really good, I reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups, and didn't add sugar to the gingersnap crust - perfect.

I made this with thanksgiving dinner this year & I thought it was great - the husband, however, wanted plain old pumpkin pie. I won't make it again for just him and I, but perhaps for company next holiday season. It was very easy to make - but took longer in the oven than it said in the recipe. I baked it at 350 for 1 1/2 hours... it turned out great - not dried out at all!

I made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it! It is wonderful and a nice change from pumkin pie. I started it at 500 degrees for 10 min and that worked fine. This is a wonderful desert.

This was one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made.

Like a lot of other cooks, 550 degrees produced a burnt crust. Every other cheesecake recipe I've seen says to start at 350 degress so I wonder if it's a typo? Even WITH the burnt crust, my Thxgiving guests raved about the cake. I think they're the same ones that like burnt marshmallows at a campfire!

This was incredible! Even my husband who doesn't eat dessert loved it. I followed another reviewer's advice and cooked it at 350 for 20 min. and 250 for an hour, then left it in the oven on off for another 20.

This cheesecake sounded like a great alternative to pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving so I tried it but instead of the scary 550 temp. I baked it the same way I have baked my old standby NY style cheesecake for the past 32 years - in a waterbath (outside of 9" springform pan covered in heavyduty foil) in a preheated 325 degree oven for 1 hr. 10 min., then TURN OVEN OFF and let cake sit in oven for 2 hr., then remove and let cool completely on counter, then refrigerate for at least several hrs. or preferably, overnight. Not burned, no cracks, Perfection! Everyone raved! (gingersnap crust - abt. 32 gingersnaps, 1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. melted butter).

TO THE COOK FROM BRIDGEWATER, NJ: The riginal recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of graham cracker crumbs. This particular recipe calls for you to use 3/4 cup of graham cracker crumbs and 3/4 cup of gingersnap crumbs. Hope this will help clarify the directions for you. TO PAT MAZUR: You are correct in thinking that a 10" springform pan would be the best to use.

Rating: 4
I made this last year for the office and it was wonderful. They asked for it again, in fact one of my coworkers offered to pay me to make one for her. I plan on using it again this year for Thanksgiving. One thing missing is the size of the springform pan. I believe I used a 10" pan, and baked it exactly as directed with no problems. Of course, you have to know your oven.

Could someone explain what is meant by "1/2 made with finely ground gingersnaps"? Does this mean use half a recipe? Or does it mean to make it with half gingersnaps and half graham crackers? Or does it mean half finely ground and half just regularly ground?

Rating: 3
I, too, was nervous about the 500 start so baked at 350 for 20 min then an hour or so at 250. I then turned the oven off and let the cake sit in the oven for another 20 minutes or so. Very good!

Fabulous! Everyone from the soccer team loved it! The first time we doubled the recipe and made in an 18X11 inch glass pan, and the crust also burned a touch at 550 for the first 12 minutes. We also had to bake it at least 1/2 hour longer at 200. This time we did the normal size recipe in the same pan at 450, and the exposed part of the crust is already burned. Also, you have to really eyeball when the cake is only a touch wobbly to know when its finished. However, my son is looking forward to it again today!

I utilized a different crust - one which included crushed pecans. In any case, the crust was a bit burnt at the 550 temperature. However, the cheesecake (minus burnt crust) was so delicious that it was eaten within days. I think that a praline topping might make this perfect - or be overkill. These are better than just pumpkin cheesecakes 'cause those just taste like really, really, really rich pumpkin pies. This has a taste of cheesecake with pumpkin pie splashed here and there!

What a cheesecake!! If you love pumpkin and cheesecake this is the recipe to find. A little "fluffy" texture and a whole lot of taste. The only problem I had was it had to be baked 20 min longer in 200 degree. Next time I'll bake for 1 hour at 250 degrees. Loved it!!

I would like to know if other cooks are baking this cheesecake at 550F oven temperature for the first 12 minutes, as advised. I think this is a mistake, to put it lightly. It burnt the entire crust in about 6 minutes. To me, 550F is near broiling, and definitely not for cheesecakes!

I don't know what I did wrong but this was a complete disaster!! I cooked it 30 min. longer than called for, it looked done but when it cooled it was only half cooked. The part that was cooked tasted great and I might try this again when I'm not expecting people over for Canadian Thanksgiving dinner. Should I be taking altitude into consideration??

Absolutely wonderful!! My family loves cheesecake and pumpkin pie so this was a surefire hit. The gingersnap crust did stick to the pan a bit, but I think I might have done a skimpy job greasing the pan. It is a beautiful cake, and so easy to make. Will definately try this again!

This was my 1st cheesecake and it was a complete success. Separating the pumpkin allowed you to savor the pumpkin flavor. Will make again.

This was an outstanding creamy, tasty and decorative cheesecake and a first-rate recipe that worked perfectly exactly as listed. The steam from a shallow pan of water on the bottom shelf of the oven ensured a smooth top surface on the cheesecake that didn't crack. I also "jazzed up" the presentation with autumn leaf-shaped tuiles, and "painted" swirls on the top of the cake and "veins" on the leaf tuiles with edible gold dust. A real crowd-pleaser as an upscale Thanksgiving dinner or buffet dessert -- puts the traditional, boring pumpkin pie to shame!
