I made this for a wedding rehearsal dinner, and it was a HUGE hit. I even heard guests talking about it at the wedding the next day. Delish. The first time I made it, though, I didn't get a smooth enough puree, and the mousse ended up having a tapioca-like texture, so be careful to puree the hell out of the mangoes.

Very delicious. I used an indian variety of mangoes, the Alphonso -Tinned. It pureed easily, and the Alphonso is a beautiful variety of mango for this mousse. I did not frost this mousse cake but i made a mango juice miroir for a beautiful display. Needless to say was a big hit at the potluck i took it to.

Absolutely beautiful. Light, delicate, and so delicious. Be certain that you whip the egg long enough. After 4 minutes it formed thin liquidy little ribbons, so I continued for another 3 minutes or so, and it became very thick and lovely. Maybe this was my error, but 2.5 lbs of mangos was 4, and that didn't make nearly enough puree - barely a cup and a half. Was it supposed to be 2.5 lbs AFTER peeling and slicing??? Thankfully, I'd bought extra mangos and could right the wrong. Lastly, I didn't think that 1 T was enough sugar for the frosting. Added at least twice that. But like I said before, the final product was beyond compare. (ps, the sponge cake is supposed to be very thin. it's great as is, no need to double).

Yipes. Mine was a disaster. I must have gotten the proportions wrong. I wound up with cream of mango soup instead of mango mousse. Maybe I was supposed to chill the mousse to let it set a little before trying to put it on the cake? Also, another difficulty I have with pureeing mangos is, I always seem to wind up with some terribly unpalatable mango chaff, no matter how long I process it. Oh well.

This cake is simple and delicious. It is crucial that the directions are followed in this process (when it says 'fold in' make sure you are folding, make sure the eggs are the right consistancy, make sure to add the batter to the butter and then fold it in) otherwise, it will lose its delicacy. Another important thing is to make sure you are using good quality ingredients ... nice, flavourful mango's ... etc. Overall, very nice - great for summer parties, not overpowering.

I made this two or three years ago and will be making it again this summer. It is a heavenly!! A couple of things you should take note of, however... 1) The star of this cake isn't the actual cake, it's the mousse. The two layers of cake in this recipe are thin, sponge-like cakes that serve to sandwich the mousse. 2) You absolutely must beat the eggs till they "form the ribbon," otherwise, your cakes will fail. 3) If your mangos aren't intoxicatingly ripe and juicy, your mousse isn't going to be as wonderful as it could be. I made this cake once with less than stellar mangos and it was a disappointment. However, if you do things right, this cake is beyond compare. I still salivate at the thought of it.

The mousse is average at best and the cake is just boring. I can't comment on the frosting because I ruined mine by trying to substitute orange juice in place of the liquor, which curdled the whipped cream.

Unlike others, I was disappointed with this cake. Maybe it was becuase it didn't have chocolate or ginger in it, my favourite flavours, but I found it to be a bit blah. Also, don't skimp on the 4 hours in the frige - it needs at least that long to set (especially if you're making other things during this time and keep opening the fridge door!).

this recipe has knocked around on my to-make list for years, and i was thrilled to actually be able to make it for a dinner party last weekend. judging by some of the other reviews, i get the feeling that a lot of people just aren't familiar with mousse cakes. the cakes ARE SUPPOSED to be that flat. the only reason you're baking them in separate pans is to save yourself from torting such thin layers. the majority of the height comes from the volume of the mousse. and the mousse MUST be made with either fresh or fresh-frozen mangoes. if you can't get them, don't even attempt this recipe.

Without a doubt this is the easiest, most presentable dessert I have made to date. I initially hesitated to make it because I didn't think it was "fancy" enough for the engagement party that I was preparing it for; however, I had already made the Mango Tartlets with Lime Curd (incredible dessert, by the way) and so figured I could slack on the second dessert. No way. By the time I finished it looked amazing and tasted even better. Here are the changes I made: *Doubled the recipe for baking ease (I tried the original amount and it was gross) *made SURE that the consistancy was correct (failed that too, at first) *sliced the cakes in half and built the cake taller *used a mixture of frozen and fresh mangos for the mousse--canned mangos were GROSS (tasted like canned peaches). Just writing about it makes me want to make another one. Yum! To the cook from Singapore: This is such a simple cake recipe that it wouldn't hurt to try making it again if you fail the first (or second) time. I'm no professional, but it seems to me that you may not have beat the eggs long enough to get the right consistancy. It took over five minutes for me. Good luck!

Read the reviews and had high expectations for the cake. However, on both times that I tried, the cake failed to rise. The first time I tried, it was nothing more than a pancake. The second, time I tried doubling the recipe but got the same result. Since most people raved about the cake, I am trying to figure out what I did wrong. I believe I folded the ingredients in correctly (re-read my Joy of Cooking). A queston I have though is were we supposed to use 2 eggs and 2 egg WHITES instead of 2 eggs and 2 egg yolks? Reason for this is I read up on sponge cakes after the flops and understand that most of the structure is supposed to come from the egg WHITES. Could someone give me suggestions on how I could achieve the same success they have in this recipe?

I plucked this recipe out of Bon Appettit in 1992 and made it for the first time this summer. Folks, this is a lovely and refreshing summertime dessert. The cake is an excellent spongecake and the mousse is very light and delightfully flavored with mango and a touch of orange. Note that the pureed mango yields much more than you'll need for the mousse and garnish. I used closer to 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar in the frosting. This is a great dessert; one that will DEFINITELY impress!

This was an incredible cake. Delicious, easy and looked fabulous. I doubled the cake recipe and used 3 eight inch pans. There was mousse left over. It was perfect for a small dinner party I had.

Wonderful. I made this for my girlfriend who is from New Guinea. She grew up on mangos and she loved the cake...that or the thought that i tried.....it was really good

This cake was great, light and refreshing! The only criticism that I have for it is that the cake is slightly denser and drier than I would have liked it because the mousse is extremely light. However, overall, it was very good and I will make it again!

This is a wonderful cool refreshing, out-of-the-ordinary dessert. The flavors and textures are subtle and sublime. I would check the cake before 10 minutes, mine was slightly overdone by then.

This was absolutely heavenly. I made it for a housewarming party and everyone loved it. If you love mangos and whipped cream and mousse concoctions, I don't see how you couldn't love this recipe. The cake portion came out perfect; it was very light and sponge-like, but the star of this recipe is definitely the mango mousse.

This was FABULOUS. I just made the mousse and served it in champagne flutes with whipped creme on the top. Served alone it made a wonderful dessert!

A light, elegant cake that's very easy to prepare. Goes beautifully with just about anything. Don't be alarmed that the cake batter barely covers the bottom of the pans; the finished product is two layers of light sponge cake with the mango-orange mousse sandwiched between them. Very classy! Try it...you won't be disappointed.

A lovely light, creamy dessert - just the thing to finish off a spicy or heavy meal, especially when mangoes are plentiful and cheap. Was a big hit with our dinner guests.

Yuck! I couldn't believe the cake dough; barely covered the pan. Resulting cake was a mouthful of nothing. Not just so-so, it was terrible!
