This was a lovely salad with great balance of flavors. The pepper taste of the arugula was nicely balanced by the sweet honey.

This was heavenly. The pine nuts and honey paired perfectly with the lamb, it was both sweet and savory with the gamey-ness of the lamb. I didn't see the accompanying recipe for red wine truffle risotto, but made a saffron risotto to go with, and it was beyond good. I try a lot of recipes, and rarely try things more than once unless it really made an impression on me, or it is a staple. This one did. The honey and pine nut goes very well with pork tenderloin as well.

This was simply superb. I made this with POACHED OYSTERS AND ARTICHOKES WITH CHAMPAGNE CREAM as a starter, and then served the lamb with TRUFFLED RED WINE RISOTTO WITH PARMESAN BROTH. I finished the dinner with POACHED PEARS WITH MARSALA, CINNAMON, AND VANILLA. This was a perfect valentine's day dinner. My husband just raved about the lamb and repeatedly asked me to make this again. Lamb is not his favorite meat. The preparation was easy. This was quick enough to prepare on a week night getting home late from work and elegant enough for a special dinner.

I couldn't find lamb, so I ended up doing the exact same thing except with skinless chicken breasts - and it turned out great! The honey & olive oil work well with chicken.

Delicious. The sweet honey flavour was subtle and very nice with the lamb. Easily good enough to serve to guests.

Excellent...good enough for both Thanksgiving and Christmas in our home. I substituted a boneless roast so we could have leftovers each time. Cooking time and internal temp were varied...but I think the honey and seasoning combination was perfect for this salad preparation. We used mixed greens, arugula is not really necessary.

I didn't like the sweet taste of the honey with the lamb. I would suggest using less honey and more thyme, salt and pepper.

This was a simple and quick preparation for a weeknight meal for two that tasted and looked like a restaurant dish.

This was incredible - we added some crushed garlic to the lamb and our neighbors gave us fresh arugula from their garden. We steamed baby carrots and tossed them in a mixture of butter melted with saffron, chives, salt and pepper. WOW what a meal. I'm getting hungry thinking about it again.
