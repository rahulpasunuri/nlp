Delicious combo: sweet corn and carrots, chewy wild rice, smoky sausage and salty broth. Very easy and delectable.

Simply amazing. I made a box of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice and used that instead of the rice the recipe called for. Delicious soup.

I like to refer to this soup as clean out the fridge/FRZR. As is I say a bland recipe but: I made a 1/2 batch using hmmde veg. chix & turk stock, added to recipe garlic, mushrooms, celery, potato & red bell pepper as this was what I had on hand mixture of leeks, gr. onions 1/2 sweet white onion; needed to use up. had a little Chaurice (cajun version of chorizo) and tasso. Added a parm rind and fresh thyme, marjarom & bay. My husband likes soup with "stuff" in it so this is a winner!

This is a great winter soup. It has good texture and flavor even if you modify it a bit to reduce the fat (use chicken andouille; cut the half and half IN half and blend it with some of the corn). Also, I had only one 4-oz package of wild rice, not 7.5 oz, but that amount seemed sufficient.

Rating: 4
We love this chowder! I've made it many times exactly as written and it's fabulous. My husband asks for it as soon as the weather turns cold. I also make a lighter version after the holidays using turkey stock and a lighter smoked sausage (turkey). Instead of half and half, I either use milk or just skip it and add more pureed corn. It's also good with diced potatoes if not using the dairy. They thicken it up nicely. Great recipe as is or lighted up!

Rating: 4
I didn't use the half and half at all. The food processed corn made the soup creamy enough. I also used smoked keilbasa which was a new way to do somthing other than the sauerkraut combination.

Made this with 'stuff' on hand... didnt have ckn stock, or wild rice, but did have Rice a Roni wild rice mix. Measured water, seasoning mix, added some beef stock paste, frozen corn, can of creamed corn, cumin, cayenne, some garlic, etc. Used emersion blender to cream after brought to boil. Added rice mix and simmered. Browned sausage, onion, added as recipe calls for after blotting with paper towels to absorb fat. Added cream and some milk being careful not to boil. Was good. Even better didnt have to go to store after crazy New Years weekend.

My brother declared this the best soup that he has ever had. It is thick and hearty. I use spicy Chorizo sausages to add kick and serve it on a bed of greens (chopped baby arugula or baby spinach). The heat from the broth wilts the greens, the flavor is a beautiful compliment. I have made this with both frozen corn and fresh roasted corn and did not find a tremendous difference in the taste, so go ahead and save yourself a step and get the frozen veggie.

Rating: 4
Great flavor especially if you use a good sausage and follow the recipe. I processed the corn and stock in my vita mix, so the texture was very creamy and have to assume the 'd-food' comment was because they can't follow directions and processed all of the ingredients combined. Froze some before adding the cream for a future quick dinner and very happy with the result.

Rating: 4
This is a great soup for blustery fall and winter days. I've made it many times as written and subbing smoked salmon, shrimp, crab or what-have-you for the sausage. Also, usually use milk for part or all of half and half.

Rating: 4
This was one of my favorite soups growing up. I have been asking for the "wild rice corn chowder" recipe from my mom for years and finally found it! I made the soup as is only substituting the smoked sausage with a jalapeno one to add some kick and adding only half the cream. YUM!

Rating: 4
This is a keeper!! Love it. The wild rice took much long than 45 minutes to cook and it should be covered while simmering. I used smoked chicken andouille from Trader Joe instead of kielbasa. It had a nice kick to it. No need for salt or pepper. I made sure that I pureed the corn into a smooth consistency otherwise the texture will be rough. I used 2% milk and it was creamy. I will definitely make this yummy soup again and again.

Rating: 4
Love, love this soup. Can use whole milk instead and it's still creamy. This is great for a first course or a hearty main. Add some crusty bread, white wine and you're set.

This was an amazing soup. I substituted andoulle sausage and used 1/2 the cream. My 11 year old loved it. This was the perfect dinner for a rainy, rainy, rainy day in sunny California.

Great fall recipe. Easy to make and always a hit with kids and adults alike. A family favorite to make during the week of Thanksgiving.

Rating: 3
Excellant recipe. The soup is wonderfully flavorful, with a great nuttiness from the wild rice, without letting it overwhelm the rest of the soup. The soup is very sweet (from the corn) when finished, but I seasoned with kosher salt until the soup was much more balanced without being too salty. This may be because I used Penzey's Chicken Base, which is -very- low sodium, rather than canned stock. I also used Andoulie (sp?) sausage and it added a wonderful zest. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
I love this soup! My family loves this soup and I will make it over and over again! I used a combination of stock from a carton and some that I poached chicken tenders in (which I cut up and also added to the soup). I also substituted one of the onions for 3 stalks of celery. I did not add the half and half and the soup came out so creamy and tasted so buttery...YUM!

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful recipe. I followed it to the letter, with the exception of including the carrots, which I didn't have. Critical (in a good way - I've spoiled him!) husband loved this, as did I. Don't know what the folks who came up with the "dog food" description did to the recipe, but it clearly didn't work. This is simple, very flavorful, and company friendly. It will definitely be the first course at my next winter dinner party.

Rating: 4
I/ve made this for years with cajun or spicy sausage w/habaneros as it is usually what I have on hand, then slice & grill. I also add smoked paprika. Sometimes I puree skim milk & leftover potatoes with the corn instead of going to the store just for 1/2 and 1/2. We love it a little spicy.

Rating: 4
Today it's rainy and cool and I looked for a homey, comforting soup to make. This sounded wonderful, but I had no sausage. I decided to substitute 5 slices of thick applewood smoked bacon. (Trader Joe's brand) Everything else in the recipe remained the same; I sauteed the veggies in the rendered bacon fat and put the diced cooked bacon back into the soup for the last 20 minutes or so. WOW! This is awesome! I'll try making it with the sausage next time and I'm sure that it will be equally wonderful. I may also experiment using or not using the half and half. This is a keeper!

Here it is, 2008, and I am calling my sister for the recipe again. This has become of family staple for our Christmas buffet. My 28 year old son is cooking it this year. I'm going to make my own batch, because knowing him as I do, he won't leave any here. This soupd is delicious.

Very good. I forgot to salt, pepper, and garnish with chives and it needed the extra flavors but that was my fault. Nice and creamy and thick soup for a hearty but light weeknight dinner with a simple salad.

Rating: 1
I made this exactly as written, and though it seems to put me in the minority here, I found it really underwhelming. I didn't like the way the flavors came together. I felt like it needed...something...to pull it all together, but I have no idea what that should be. I wouldn't make it again.

Rating: 4
My husband and I have been making this absolutely wonderful soup since it was featured in 1995. It is always a hit. Its great to warm your bones after shovling snow or standing outside at a football game. The bad reviews must be from people who didn't follow the recipe correctly or burned it.

Rating: 4
I made this for the first time last week, after reading all the reviews I was curious. We thought the soup was GREAT, I did leave out the half and half per another reviewers suggestion. Not sure where some came up with their descriptive words-not things I would think of to describe food, hope they haven't really tasted those things.

Rating: 0
There would be mutiny in my home if I didn't make this soup every Thanksgiving! I have made it every year since it appeared in 1995. One huge modification: I do NOT add the half and half. The pureed corn gives it a lovely "creamy" texture without the addtion of the added calories. (I prefer my calories in Thanksgiving desserts - not soup!)

this soup is a thanksgiving day tradition in our house for the past decade. not sure what the bad reviews are about but my guess would be the wild rice wasn't very good or maybe wasn't fully cooked as it can take much longer than 40 minutes.

I have made this soup several times and it turns out better each time. I also use cilantro intead of parsley and it makes a huge difference.

I have made this soup many times, always with Louisiana-style sauage. I have found that it is sure to taste like diarrhea if I forget to use LOW SODIUM broth. If I use boullion cubes or paste, which is NOT low sodium, I have to throw out the whole batch; when I make it right, it cannot be beat, and people ask me for the recipe or kiss me in gratitude. It DOES taste even better with fresh corn, and I try to use as many organic ingredients as possible. You can taste the difference. Give it a try, and if it tastes like dog food just know that something got botched along the way, and that it was probably your broth.

Rating: 1
Alright, here we go. First thing - I registered on this website just to complain about this recipe. One member described it as "dog food." I thought it was a bit worse. Second - Coming from Texas, it sounded like a hearty treat. Couldn't even finish half of the bowl. My girlfriend was disappointed that I didn't like it because it's something her family has done since around 1997, but all I could taste was the sausage. It's gross. Sorry if I'm offending anyone that makes this dish annually, but I will never ever...ever let this recipe be made again in my presence without severe modification. Severe. Never again. Ever. In the world. Yuck. I just reduced myself to a 5 year old, but yuckie. Once again, I apologize. ALSO! I followed the recipe to the letter. Don't do it, folks. Change it up. A lot! Later on.

My wife loved it. I thought the texture a bit chewy, but the flavor good. May try with chorizo next time instead of kielbasa and will probably thin it a bit.

Very good. Threw in a couple tablespoons of butter(figured might as well). If someone thinks that it's not spicy enough,a couple dashes of tabasco added to the serving really spikes it up a bit and adds a nice flavor.

When I first made this soup in 1995 (when I received my Bon Appetit magazine) it became an instant favorite. However, after a year or so, I could not remember where I had gotten the recipe. I just rediscovered it as I was flipping through old magazines - and my husband immediately remembered it and asked me to make it again! It is one of the ehartiest soups I've made, and the combination of flavors is wonderful.

Rating: 2
After reading all the positive reviews, I was really excited to make this, and I served it to friends today at lunch. All five of them enjoyed it - my boyfriend thought it was the best soup he'd ever had - but I was pretty underwhelmed. Maybe my expectations were too high after reading all the praises people lauded on the dish. It might be better the second day, too. But I thought it was kind of bland; I wouldn't necessarily order it instead of standard corn chowder. I think if I make it again, some celery might hope, and I'd roast all the corn instead of half, and use quite a bit less sausage and less cream, and maybe add some more spices (I added some cajun spices, but I don't think it was enough). I did like the rice, however. I wish I'd used 2 cups.

I am not much of a corn soup fan. But WOW, was this excellent. I really did not pay attention to the number of serverings and I doubled the amounts. With a full kettle, I was able to enjoy the soup for months!!! I still have some in the freezer now.

Rating: 4
I thought that the "smoked sausage" or kielbasa-type of sausage would overwhelm this recipe, so I substituted Chicken-cilantro sausage. I also stirred in some chopped fresh cilantro before serving this soup. I served this to a gathering of family members, who are averse to "different" kinds of food. They loved it! The cilantro flavor was enjoyed by all. I think that the subtle flavor of the chicken-cilantro sausage helped preserve the delicate sweetness of the corn and the slight nutty flavor of the wild rice.

Rating: 4
One of my all time favorites to serve to friends and family in the fall and winter. Everyone LOVES it, rants and raves all around. I add some garlic and roast half of the corn to make a smokier flavor. Gotta try this one!

Rating: 2
I liked the combination of flavors, but it wasn't very appetizing to look at and the texture was kind of funky! I thought a simple corn soup with a side of wild rice and sausage would have been more enjoyable. Perhaps I should not have used fresh corn, which has a very different texture than frozen corn when pureed.

Very good---my husband requests this one in the wintertime frequently. I have not tried lower fat versions, but I am going to do that today (use fat free half and half and turkey kielbasa).

I ended up turning this into a Jambalaya type soup because I accidentally picked up Cajun spiced smoked sausage. I just added some chopped chicken, garlic & cajun spices to the soup & it tasted great. Because I have to cook during naptimes, I made mine in the morning & reheated it that evening. It really melded the flavors & gave the pureed corn & the rice a chance to thicken the mixture up. It was a great consistancy & made for a hearty meal.

This is the best soup! A friend made it one year for Thanksgiving and now it is a must every year! Everyone who has ever had this soup demands the recipe. I substitute (like many others) the wild rice with a white and wild rice mixture. Tasty! When making this soup as a main course I also add more smoked sausage!

Rating: 4
Great soup; hearty, complex, the different textures play together well. It's even better the next day when the smoky/spicy flavor of the sausage marries into the creamy broth. I used 1/2 wild rice and 1/2 wehani rice, and fat-free half and half. Added a little celery (without thinking about it...just a part of making soup!).

I'd actually rate this 3.5. A few changes: * Added sauteed red peppers and barley with the rice * Used cream as well as half and half * Used chorizo as well as smoked sausage (which made it a bit spicier) It was terrific as left-overs, too!

Rating: 4
My kids aren't big fans of "real" wild rice (too bird-seedy tasting to them I guess) so I cheated and used a box of Uncle Bens White and Wild blend. This worked out fine and the soup was really terrific. When we had it tonight for dinner all we added were some homemade popovers. I can't wait to have it again for lunch tomorrow, I'm sure it's only going to get even better as it sits overnight in the fridge.

Rating: 4
I have been making this for 8 years; I freeze it, give it as gifts. When I make it, I make a huge vat and have learned some tips over the years: You cannot beat homemade chicken stock. I add sauted red peppers, too. But the secret to the best soup is to use fresh corn from your farmers market, cut it off the cob, and then scrape all the milk out of the cob with the back of your knife and add it to the soup, too. I also put a bit of sherry in the rice and let it boil away. This time I make it I am going to add some fresh scallions. Top it with a dollop of sour cream when serving. It is heaven.

This recipe is terrific!! Great for group during the holidays or today I made it for the NFL Playoffs. It is one of the best soups I have ever tasted. One comment about the wild rice. The first time I made it, the broth did not evaporate after 40 minutes. I realized that I had covered the saucepan. Today, I let the rice cook on medium heat uncovered and the results were perfect. I'm probably the only one that make that mistake!

We make part (the soup, sage butter turkey, bread stuffing w/ mushrooms, green beans with roasted onions!!!)of the whole meal every year and it is a delicious tradition we all look forward to. One twist I have added is that I broil the 2 1/2 cups of corn in the oven for a smoky flavor.

My Husband calls this 'Super Bowl Soup' and requests it every year for his annual bash. His family requests it every Thanksgiving and since his Grandmother still runs it, this is my contribution and everyone LOVES it.

It's just a hearty, warm meal that can be enjoyed from fall to spring.
