Great. I made it with walnut oil and walnuts instead of hazelnuts, though.

Thought this was very nice and light - the strawberries were perfect - didn't change anything. Easy to make.

I really liked this. I followed as closely as I could. No hazelnut oil but, could find walnut oil & walnuts so used that instead. Couldn't find sherry vin. so used white wine. Hope to find some at some point.

I find that arugula has a very specific, unpleasant smell and taste, which other people I know can't detect at all. It turns out that this probably has a genetic component, like people who have a cilantro aversion. I didn't know this before making the salad, so I found it pretty icky. However, I'm giving this 3 stars because my husband really enjoyed it, and when I tasted the individual components without the arugula they were quite good. My husband has asked me to make it again, which was kind of surprising because I thought he wouldn't like the strawberry/hazelnut/goat cheese combo at all, but he loved it. I would have given it 4 stars, but I thought the dressing was a touch meh (maybe could have used some fresh herbs or more shallot). I'll make it again, but with different greens. The farmer's market has lamb's tongue right now, which is probably what I'll sub.

Deliiiicious! Easy to make and everything complimented one another very well.

I made this recipe as part of the BBQ dinner for friends. It is strawberry season in Holland, and the berries are so sweet right now. The sweet berries are a perfect match in this salad combination. The recipe was a hit with our guest and my husband. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using half baby greens and half arugula. Not everyone is a fan of full arugula so I thought it best to use half and half. (Personally I love arugula's strong peppery taste) I highly recommend this recipe to everyone. It is a fabulous summer salad.

Loved this salad! Made a double recipe of the dressing as it is delish. And really liked the goat cheese, feta would be too salty for me in this recipe. Looking forward to making it again.

Really loved this salad! Had friends over for dinner and they raved about it. I only used a 5oz container of baby arugula though and doubled the dressing. Did not have the hazelnut oil so used a little orange olive oil and really good EVOO, tasted great. If I find some hazelnut oil though will buy to have on hand specifically for this salad as I will absolutely make it again!

I substituted grapeseed oil for both of the oils. My friend loved this salad, but I thought it was just pretty good. I think it's key to have top strawberries and arugula; mine were just average. I'm planning to try it again once summer gets on its way. It's definitely worth another go!

Don't worry about not having hazelnut oil- with all the hazelnuts in the salad, you won't miss out on the hazelnut flavor. I've tried the dressing out on all manners of greens and have been quite happy every time.

Even having to do without hazelnut oil, my family loved it. We also added a few extra things: a handful of bay shrimp, mandarin orange segments, and some sliced green onions gave it a little more flavor variety. Well be doing this again before the summer is over. Fantastic!

modified this a good bit based on what is around - red wine vinegar and sunflower seeds - still very good and quick.

Delicious. I used a little more shallot and a whole pound of strawberries. Definitely use a mild goat cheese, not feta. Fantastic salad!

This salad is delicious! The two times I have made it, it has been gobbled up! I have ended up using feta cheese since you can buy it pre-crumbled (a step-saver). Also, this last time I was out of town and had no access to hazelnut oil so I used macadamia oil instead. Although I thought the hazelnut oil was better, the macadamia oil will definitely do in a pinch and it is cheaper. I did a combo of arugula and watercress and it turned out really well!

This is a great salad course for a special summer dinner party. I had hazelnut oil that I had purchased in Southern France. I made with arugula the first time, but have since switched to baby spinach as I have decided I just don't like the taste of arugula that much. I also used feta instead of the goat cheese. Yummy!

a fabulous salad. my husband usually doesn't like arugula, but loves this combination. will make this one regularly for sure.

I made this 1 week ago and wasn't wowed by it. However, I just found the leftover dressing in my refrigerator and used it on a salad of romaine with toasted hazelnuts, feta, and strawberries and it was delicious. Perhaps the dressing is better afer it sits? I'm wanting another serving!

Love this! I am a big fan of salads with fruit and nuts and this one is a keeper. I did use a bag of mixed baby greens in place of the arugula but otherwise made it as written. Don't worry about the hazelnut skins; I barely got any of them off and it was fine.

Excellent! This is my dinner party staple. Everyone always loves it. Just emailed copies to my two sister-in-law. It's equally as good with these substitutions: dried cranberries, toasted walnuts or pecans, mixed greens, raspberry vinegar.

Fantastic! Tried this on a whim, but wasn't sure I was going to like the dressing... but, it all was really delicious. Great combo of flavors. Not a drop left after our dinner party. Will definitely make again.

Love all the ingredients but didn't think they came together quite right, as the end result was rather boring and bland. Easy enough, but I won't bother with this one again as there are so many other spectacular and impressive salad recipes on this site.

This was absolutely awesome and so easy - not a spoonful left. People had to eat every last spoonful - they said we can't throw this salad out - it was too good! I couldn't find sherry vinegar, so I subsituted it with raspberry vinegar. I also used raspberries instead of the strawberries. I doubled the dressing and increased the amount of sugar (in the doubled recipe, I used 4 teaspoons of sugar instead of 2). The grocery store was out of arugula and we found slugs on the watercress I bought (yuck), so I used a bag of the fancier mixed greens. This recipe was unbelievably good and so easy. Enjoy it!

this was the last chance for arugula. i had tried a few different things with arugula and disliked them vehemently. so i tried this on a whim and was very glad i did. dinner party all raved also. don't know how many other arugula recipes i will try, but will definitely keep this in my recipe box

This is phenomenal. It is a super summer salad...something different, refreshing and delicious!

A beautiful, delicious salad. I used all canola oil, which I think worked fine (although I'm sure the additional hazelnut flavor would have been delicious). The flavors of this salad marry beautifully.

I agree with other reviewers that the proportions are a bit off (too much arugula for amount of dressing). I too could not find hazelnut oil and used walnut oil instead. Cut down on the oil anyway (I like a lower oil base for taste as well as health). You don't need much hazelnuts to add richness/crunch. Really a nice salad with great colors, taste and textures. Definitely a repeater.

A hit at Easter dinner. After reading reviews, I was skeptical about finding hazelnut oil, so I went to Williams-Sonoma. They didn't have it. Turns out I didn't have to look so hard. If you have a Cost Plus in your area, hazelnut oil is available for $5.99, Found it also at my market (Von's) for $7.50. I will certainly make again.

this was excellent.\, even tho i used feta cheese. a keeper.

Yes, I had hazelnut oil and sherry vinegar on hand, always do, but I toasted pine nuts instead of hazelnuts and tossed mache instead of arugula. Felt like Alice Waters as I used flavorful French strawberries from Chino's vegetable stand. My husband called it "the best salad ever." Now I know to keep hazelnuts on hand for next time!

The genius of this recipe is the combination of the strawberries and the arugula. I have one small quibble with two of the ingredients. Sherry vinegar ... I have rice, red wine, white wine, apple cider, dark and white basalmic vinegar on hand. Oil? I've got olive, sesame, walnut, peanut, and canola oil. But hazelnut? Man! I can't find these ingredients! The good news is, the recipe still pleased with a combo of white basalmic/rice vinegar and walnut/olive/peanut oil. ... Several weeks of shopping later, I found the the hazelnut oil and sherry vinegar and served this again last night. It's still a great salad, and now I have even more kinds of oil and vinegar in my cupboard!

This is a great salad however! 3/4# of arugula for 4 people?? as a side salad?? I bought the ingredients as called for and used 5 oz of arugula, all of the dressing, half the goat cheese and chopped hazelnuts. Great salad but I think we'll be having it again tomorrow and maybe the next day!

one of my all time favorite recipies. for anyone who is considering susbtituting the hazelnut oil with something else...its worth the effort and money to go find the hazelnut oil. i made this salad throughout the summer and again this december when i found excellent strawberries at the market. this recipie is an all-time keeper!

What a fab summer salad! I was a bit dubious, but so glad I took the plunge. Easy on the eyes, and very yummy. I purchased all the ingredients, although I did use pre-roasted hazelnuts, and cut the arugula with some mixed greens.

What a wonderful recipe when strawberries are at the height of the season. As much as I hated to pay the "hazelnut oil" price, it was worth every penny! A definite "keeper."

I made this salad to go with homemade pasta for dinner guests, and it was wonderful. The only substitute I made was using white wine vinegar in place of sherry vinegar, which worked fine.

Loved this...it was an amazing thing to skewer a salad bite and place it in your mouth, somehow expecting the taste of tomatoes...and surprise! strawberries... So summery...so elegant looking....

Very elegant and delicious! I couldn't find hazelnut oil for making the dressing (although I would have loved to try it), so I just used a good bottled basalmic vinagrette, and found it to be a satisfactory substitution. The salad was a snap to assemble!

An excellent salad, especially for folks like us who like to eat salad after the main course. If you can't get arugula, use watercress.
