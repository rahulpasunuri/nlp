I loved the contrast of tangy yogurt with the natural sweetness of fresh dates, and the fact that the overall texture was light. I think many ice cream recipes call for a bit too much sugar, but in this one, I recommend increasing the dates by a half cup or using 2 tablespoons extra sugar. I also put the dates and the cooling custard into a blender for a rough chop to blend the flavors of the dates more. Lastly used slivered toasted almonds instead of walnuts...just goes better.

This ice cream is OK but I did not love it. I probably won't make it again.

Love this ice cream recipe! It's refreshing and sweet, but not as high in calories as regular ice cream. I use low fat milk and it works great. I highly recommend it!
