My family loved this recipe! I rarely deep fry, but let's be honest, the humble zucchini is great when cooked using this method. Therefore it stands as my exception to what I term ICC (Industrial cooking & Cleaning). I kicked up the cayenne pepper to satisfy my boy's and used up buttermilk (hate to waste) instead of reg. milk and they turned out great! We really didn't notice the bacon so next time I'll do a rough chop as oppose to the recipes fine chop recommendation or maybe I'll go Italian all the way and use pancetta! I agree with Diane, make a double batch of the dipping sauce! YUM!!!

YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! I didn't have jalapenos so I added crushed red peppers, I cooked a whole pound of bacon and chopped it up and added it all. The total zucchini I put in was 8 cups from my garden. This recipe is FANTASTIC! Even my anti-veggie teenager ate and loved it. I made a double batch of the basil mayo because it was so good I knew we'd use it as a dip and spread for other things. YUMMY!

Read the reviews before making and noted some felt the flour was too much. I used larger zucchinis vs. less flour and it turned out well. Upped the heat. Used fresh picked basil, chives, jalapenos, & zucchini, from our garden and although was fried still had a freshness to it. The refreshing basil mayo is what really makes the dish a success.

Love it! Made it for my 12-year old son who doesn't like vegetables or lemon. He couldn't stop eating them. We added garlic to the sauce. A great recipe. Will definitely make again.

I cut 1/4 Cup of the flour and added a bit more cayenne. The sauce was wonderful and I used it on steamed broccoli the next night.

Have made these twice now. The flavors are very good. It seems there is too much flour though, so I hope to cut down the flour and fry thinner fritters to get a crisper result.

I tried this recipe last night and it was delicious. I was a little worried that the bacon would be overpowering, but it was actually quite subtle and and added just the perfect amount of flavour. I threw in some some nasturtium flowers too, and it added a nice spicy kick.

I haven't tried this yet, but it sounds exceptional! Mmm, bacon.

Very good! Everybody loved them even the kids. I prepared the batter and fried them outside on the BBQ side burner to avoid the frying smell in the house and to be with my guests. I had some batter left and used it up the next day and the fritters were as good so I would say it is a good recipe for entertaining since it can be prepared ahead of time.
