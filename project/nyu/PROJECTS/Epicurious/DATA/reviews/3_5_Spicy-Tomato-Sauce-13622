Very Good! I diced some carrots to sneak in veggies. It added a little "meat" to the sauce. I also added a few more herbs than what it called for.

I absolutley LOVE this recipe. I do add a lot more crushed red pepper, bigger onions, and i dont add the thyme. I aso puree it at the end but it makes a great tomato sauce- the best i've ever had and i hope you will enjoy it as well.

Great, tasty tomato sauce, and so easy to make. Definitely a winner.

It seems that Italian Plum tomatoes make for a thicker sauce...also a little wine seems to cut the bite out of the tomatoes.

Good basic recipe. I usually make my sauce from my garden bounty and can it for the year. This is a good substitution. I would definately use fresh basil instead of the thyme. There is no comparison for basil.

Perfect for pizza sauce, and I also use it as a base for Vegetarian sausage (Lite Life brand found at Trader Joe's and Ralphs) and peppers tossed over pasta.

Great with chopped clams!
