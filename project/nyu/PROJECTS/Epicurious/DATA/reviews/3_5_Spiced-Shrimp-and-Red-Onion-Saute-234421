This was good but I wouldn't do it again because there are so many better shrimp recipes out there. I used a 1 pound bag of frozen shrimp; once it was thawed and peeled I had 10 ounces left. The amount of spice was correct for the 10 ounces of peeled, thawed shrimp.

Wonderful recipe, very easy and quick. Made with couscous and served with a side of sauteed zucchini w/ garlic and fresh herbs. Was the first time I cooked for my dining companion and it was quite apparent it would not the last time!!!!

We love this recipe the only change I make is with the whole seeds. I don't use them I used already ground seeds and then toast them in a clean dry skillet.

I make this all the time. I go light on the cardamom. The amount suggested is overwhelming. I also add red bell peppers. Sometimes I serve it over arugula for a very low cal option.

Onions become exceptionally sweet and flavorful this way. I find that this is excellent served with a grilled flatbread, or alternatively with brown rice. Do take care to trim as much as possible of the root end, while leaving them connected. These ends will not soften in cooking.

Caramalized the onion. Instead of chile sauce, I used red pepper flakes. Quick, easy, delicious. Served with a green salad with creamy dressing. Excellent!

We love this and make often for a qucik mid-week meal. I use ground spices and a little more hot sauce, but follow recipe to a tee other than that. Serve over couscous. Very flavorful and quick.

Tried this dish and was so overwhelmed by the spices, even when eaten with plain couscous, I could barely taste the shrimp. Won't make again.

This one didn't work for us. Neither my husband nor I liked it.

Not beyond compare, but very good. Interesting spice mixture (I just used the already ground spices I had), and easy to make. Definitely go with the large shrimp, and serving over plain couscous is perfect.

Delicious but very unusual flavors with the aromatic cardamom. Easy too. Served with a middle-eastern spiced spaghetti squash with chickpeas. Will make again for something different.

The flavors of the spices seemed too heavy and wintery for the delicate taste of the shrimp. Didn't work well together.

p.s. Served it over rice with a salad & creamy dressing. Perfect!

Have to admit. I tried this recipe due to 'sageydog" from Denver. Loved the response of the dinner partner. Can't say either my husband or I was as exuberant, but we enjoyed it. This is the 1st time I went tried something that had all of the elements that my husband & I would not like. Sort of "out of the box" So glad I did! I carmalized the onion. (Had the time). We are whooses when it comes to heat, so I threw in our size pinch of red pepper flakes as suggested by someone else. This is a winner!

Okay- this really is a great recipe and a weekday keeper. The combination of honey, ginger, cumin and cardamom is unusual and made the shrimp delicious. I made a few changes: per another reviewer, I also sliced the onions, cooked them in a tiny bit of olive oil. Also didn't have whole spices,the ground versions worked fine. Used a few red pepper flakes instead of any kind of hot sauce, which was just the right amount of heat. Served the shrimp over toasted Israeli couscous with sliced steamed zucchini. Fantastic.

WOW! We love this dish. Served over couscous as suggested and it was fabulous. We've had it twice now - and did not change anything from the recipe. Spice is perfect, very flavorful and presents nicely. Super fast and easy for a midweek dinner - while also impressive enough to serve to guests. This is a keeper. 4 forks!

After the first bite my first word was "Wow", my dinner companion said "Holy @*$%" and that was a compliment. Outstanding, I'm doing it again tonight. Smells wonderful cooking and looks beautiful on the plate. I did not have whole seeds and just used ground spices. I served just a little plain yogurt on the side which was good too. I served an arugula/chick pea salad on the side as another reviewer had done and it was wonderful.

Delicious! As per suggestion, I served this over couscous, with an arugula & chickpea salad. I wanted to be sure the shrimp wouldn't be too hot so I only used 1 T chili sauce, nxt time will use 2, as recipe suggests. The onion sweetened with the cooking and complimented the tasty shrimp. Recommend!

Excellent. Best shrimp I ever had.Made some changes: I sliced the onions, and added just a dash of balsamic vinegar, when they were done. Served it with lemon wedges and crusty bread.
