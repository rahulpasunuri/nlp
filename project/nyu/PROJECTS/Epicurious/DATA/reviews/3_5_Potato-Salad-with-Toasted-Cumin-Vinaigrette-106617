Been making this potato salad for a few years. It's fantastic. Agree with others .....cut back on cumin and oil. I also make a double batch because I want leftovers. I double everything EXCEPT the dressing. Here's my tweak for that.... 1TBSP plus 1/4Tsp cumin seed 1/4 cup plus 1/8 cup lemon juice 3/4 cup olive oil I make around noon and let it sit out until dinner time. Flavors need more than 2 hours to come together.

I really liked this potato salad. I would make it again. I cut potatoes in half and cooked. After they cooled, cut in smaller pieces. I doubled the green onion. I roughly chopped my roughly chopped egg. Smaller is better with hardboiled eggs. Agreed that it makes too much dressing. Next time I will reduce the amount of cumin. It was a bit strong. NOTE: let this dish sit for several hours before serving. The flavors really come together. I also had some left over, put in the refrig and just had it for lunch. It kept well. This is a keeper and I am making it for our Dog Days of Summer BBQ this weekend.

This got great reviews at a recent birthday party (served it with char-grilled beef tenderloin with three herb chimichurri also on this site - excellent), but I found the cumin overwhelming and only used about 2/3 of the dressing. I used fresh cumin seeds from a spice store, so perhaps they were especially flavorful, but if I make again I would use less cumin. I loved the addition of the pickled jalapeno and wish I had added celery as suggested by other reviewers. Based on guest reviews I would make again, but with some revisions to the dressing to diversify the flavors.

Excellent recipe. I couldn't find fresh cilantro on the market so I added coriander seeds to the toasted cumin. Spiced with flaked chili but added tabasco and served with hot chili on the side for those who like it hotter. Followed reviews to decrease the amount of olive oil. Served cold and my guests loved it. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe got pretty good reviews from the guests. The only suggestion I would make is to use a very light olive oil. I goofed and used a strong and flavorful oil that overwhelmed the cumin and cilantro (which isn't easy o do; it's almost like overwhelming Russia during the winter with a land army). So be warned.

This is awesome. I added extra red onion, chilis and chopped celery. It was a huge hit with my whole family.

I made this the other day, and it was very good. I over cooked the potatoes by accident, but no one complained - they were all so impressed with having a 'spicy' potato salad!

This was a wonderful potato salad, however, I have a few suggestions which I believe will make it outstanding: Firstly, there is too much dressing and egg, so next time I'll cut the dressing by about 1/3 and use only 2 or 3 eggs. Secondly, I think the additional of some chopped celery would be nice. Having said this, the flavor of the dish is fabulous and what should have served 6 was finished by 4 of us (with the exception of the soupy egg mixture left in the bottom of the bowl!)

Great recipe! I just crushed the cumin seeds with the back of a metal spoon, which worked just fine. Used bottled lemon juice, 1/3 cup of olive oil, and 2 Tablespoons of cumin seeds. Left out the spicy jalapenos and juice. The eggs seemed to pull it together, along with a generous dash of salt. Delicious.

i really liked the recipe, but i found it needed just a bit more umph! i added a smidge of dijon to it with some white wine vinegar, wonderful. Loved the jalepenos!

I guess I'm the one person who didnt like this recipe. My husband and I usually love the no-mayo salads...found this one bland. Tried to spice it up and failed. Wouldnt make this salad again.

Very nice, healthy change to the old fashioned potato salad with mayo. I cooked the new red potatoes whole and cut them afterwards. Only thing I will change next time is decrease the olive oil to 1/3 cup. Great side dish with any sandwich or grilled meat.

As written, I thought the recipe was 3 forks plus. When I increased the jalapenos to suit my preference for warmth and added a few dashes of red wine vinegar it was beyond 4 forks. Truly the best potato salad I've ever had in 49 years! I do think the little bit of red wine vinegar really complements the milder lemon.

Best potato salad ever! interesting and fabulous flavours. and i am another reviewer who isn't even keen on potatoes! try this-you won't be sorry. my only piece of advice is to cook the potatoes whole then slice them-that way they never come out "grainy" or mushy on the edges.

This was a nice change from the usual mayo glut. I did drain off a lot of the dressing, because it made a big oily pool at the bottom of the bowl, and I added an extra tablespoon of cumin. Very good!

Outstanding! my new favorite potato salad (and i don't even really like potatoes)! wouldn't change a thing.

Good, nice and simple. Healthy as well. Roasted some cumin seeds, crushed with knife (did not grind). No cilantro as I don't like it. No green onions as per someone else's preference, but still very flavourful. Add some hot sauce if you like spice - the jalapenos don't actually do all that much for all those starchy potatoes! Served with lamb burgers. I noticed afterwards the dressing really pooled at the bottom, making the lower potatoes a bit oily/gucky...maybe try a wide, low serving dish?

I really liked that there was no mayo in this potato salad. It is light tasting and a great summer side dish.

Yum! I was looking for a no-mayo recipe and thought this was great! I made the recipe as directed except I omitted the jalapenos and jalapeno juice. As a note, the cumin flavor seemed to die by the next day so this is definitely a dish that tastes best right away.

Always looking for a good potato salad recipe that doesn't have mayonnaise and this is a winner. I used a little more olive oil than called for to balance out the lemon. I also omitted the jalapenos because I was serving with another spicy dish but the potato salad was still great.

Great! I made this because a guest doesn't eat mayonnaise but now I'll make it because it's delicious. Everyone liked it but they couldn't figure out what made it so distinctive--the cumin!

this is a staple at all of my summer bbq's. rave reviews all around, every time.

This is a great salad--especially for summer parties as it can sit out for a while. It has been a hit whenever I serve it!

I have made this numerous times since May 2002, when the issue came out, and it is fabulous. Have taken it to potlucks, served it with the herb crusted flank steak, and it has received rave reviews every time. One of my summer entertaining staples!

I really didn't like this potato salad (and it seems not many of my guests did either as I served it at a pool party and there was quite a bit left over)

Loved this salad. And I'm not a big fan of potatoe salad. Made it with the "herb-crusted flank steak with cherry tomatoes and olives" from the same issue and we couldn't get enough of it. Will definetely make it again.

I first made this recipe in mid May. Have made it several times since. Our guests have all raved over the great taste. The only suggested changes I have is to omit the eggs if you plan on serving at a picnic. Further, the all ingredients less the potatoes makes a terrific salsa with the addition of another jalapeno pepper (seeds and all).
