I've gotten rave reviews with this recipe, but I make quite a few adjustments, based on comments that are now buried here. First, I double the recipe. I use light or Mexican beer (nothing too dark or heavy.) I replace the beans with 1 can of well-drained black beans and 1 pd. of sausage. I cook the sausage with a little onion or garlic, and drain well. I use light Velveeta. I put everything in the crock pot on low, and still it periodically until everything is melted and combined, then adjust spices. Add the cilantro at the very end. And be sure to use a hearty chip--I like the multigrain Scoops the best. I make this about every-other-year for a Super Bowl party, and even my very foodie friends rave about it. (I've also seen versions of this made with cream cheese if you're too scared of the Velveeta.)

This was not worth the effort. It's the canned beans. Make some homemade refried beans and this will taste just fine, but don't bother if you want to take the easy out and use the canned stuff.

I'm shocked that this gets 3.5 forks. What a waste of time. It was good, but not worth my time for making. I'm not picky when it comes to nachos, but I really expected better than this.

This is a good nacho cheese dip but there are better ones out there. This was a little too thin and the salsa definiely needs to the HOT kind

Since Velveeta does not have to be refrigerated, you can keep all of the ingredients in the pantry for a quick and easy dip for unexpected guests. (I've omitted the cilantro when I've made this recipe and it is still good without it).

Good, but for years have made simply 1 lb Velveeta cubed and mixed with a quality 12-16 oz Salsa (preferably hot), melted in microwave or on stovetop. Serve with tortilla chips and/or veggies. Always gets rave reviews and is so easy.

Rating: 3
Well this recipe proves there's a time & a place for even velveeta! I guess I'm usually a cheese snob, but I made this for a chili party (omitting the beans) & it was a huge hit...no leftovers at all. I kept it warm in a mini crockpot & it was fine all evening

OK, so Velveeta isn't so chic, but I admit it, this is a really tasty, simple recipe. I served it at my daughter's 2nd birthday party, which was attended mostly by adults - among other menu items were grilled PBJ & banana sandwiches and homemade mac & cheese. Kid food with a twist, and everyone loved it!

This was pretty good when made this way, but I would alter a little. Reminds me of the old Rotel & Velveeta dip. The cheese and beans overpowered everything else so I would either add more salsa or use a can of Rotel instead. Also, I'd skip the oregano and substitute chili powder.

The taste of this dip depends on the type of salsa you use. If you can't find a salsa you like in your area, make your own using one of the many good salsa recipes on this website. (Every corner store here has great salsa. We are so lucky.) I use velveeta for this type of dip and for nothing else. Velveeta melts better than cheddar. The cheddar separates and gets clumpy and oily. If you really, really can't bring yourself to use the velveeta, try a jack cheese with peppers. It melts better than cheddar, but not as well as velveeta.

Made this for a party and got great reviews - in foodie NYC! Velveeta-haters will be even more horrified to learn that I had to substitute Cheez Whiz, since Velveeta was unavailable in my local (Spanish) market. Used Corona beer and Newman's salsa; forgot the beans. Leftovers made great chili-cheese hotdog topping.

This recipe is great, but I suggest serving it in a little crock pot. It gets a little solid when it cools.

I don't like to bash a recipe (my previous review is just below) without suggesting an alternative. Here's a similar dip that is always well-received. It's from the January 1984 issue of Gourmet, and it's called "Hot Cheese and Jalapeno Dipping Sauce." It calls for: 1 cup fine fresh bread crumbs (I toss a French roll into the blender or food processor), 1 cup milk, 1/2 lb grated Monterey Jack, 1 1/2 oz grated sharp Cheddar, 1 T Dijon mustard, 1 tsp Worcestershire, 3 T minced fresh parsley (I substitute cilantro), and 4 tsp seeded and minced jalapeno peppers (either fresh or pickled). I also add about 1/2 cup chunky salsa such as Pace (use a less-salty salsa if you prefer), and 1/2 cup chili sauce. I put all the ingredients in a small crockpot and heat for a couple of hours. It yields about 4 cups.

I really tried to like this dish, but to me it seemed no better than canned bean dip. To those who decide to make it and aren't used to buying Velveeta: It's not stocked in the cheese section of the store, probably because it doesn't need to be refrigerated. Check the cracker aisle.

I made this dish twice for mexican themed parties and it went over very well. The second time I used my homemade salsa which already had cilantro so I shouldn't have added the extra. Next time I'll leave it out.

Yum! I, too, was wary of the velveeta so I used half velveeta and half real cheddar. The texture was slightly grainy (not sure if it was the beans or the cheddar) but it tasted great! I will make this again.

Rating: 3
This was a very simple appetizer that was a big hit. I opted to use the croc pot instead of the stove method. I threw all the ingredients in, minus the cilantro, simmered a few hours before our party, then added cilantro when guests arrived. Was a great leftover on burritos the next day too.

There are too few ingredients not to make this correctly, so I don't think it was anything I did wrong that left it tasteless. With the addition of fresh garlic, hamburger and jalapenos it was great.

Have made this dip many times, and it is always a big hit at parties. For those who don't like the beans, try adding a pound of cooked, hot sausage instead. I also add a can of drained, green chilies. Everyone seems to love this dip.

Rating: 3
Great taste! I made the mistake of trying to pour the sauce on tortilla chips and then broiling it for a few minutes (like they serve it at Friday's). It was hard to eat and the chips got soggy. The sauce was too heavy with the beans to serve that way. I used the leftovers as a dip and it was much better.

Rating: 4
The commercial con queso dips in the chip aisle also used processed cheese and cost over $3 for a little bitty jar. This is a dollar stretcher and can be varied to taste so easily. I skipped the oregano and used canned whole black beans (drained) instead of refried beans. If you do use beer, use Old Style, Budweiser, Miller High Life, La Crosse Lager (don't use Coors, too watery). Don't fear the Velveeta, it has its uses!

Well, tease my mullet and go Jeff Gordon, this is really good dip! All kidding aside, I was hesitant about the beans, but they give this dip a really unique taste and texture that is perfect for relaxing with some friends to watch the game. Try it! You'll like it!

Who would think Velveeta would be such an awesome ingredient? This is a fantastic dip recipe for a Super Bowl party or a lazy afternoon watching baseball.

Have the foodies gained complete ascendancy? Let's get real---Velveeta works for nachos. Take a survey of 100 people under the age of 18. Would they prefer this recipe or one that uses Double Gloucester?

Hmmm, how many think that "Cook" was recently dumped by their mullet-wearing lover? Who else would harbor such bitterness toward Velveeta? I agree with the other (letigimate) comments. This dip had good beer flavor (I added extra), and the beans make it interesting. I also added extra (hot) salsa. Overall, it was good but not amazing.

What happened when the lady at the grocery store took my Velveeta by accident...I yelled "hey that's nacho cheese!" (No, I won't give up my day job) This recipe is okay for the beginner cook. There are better recipes for this sort of thing. Only 2 forks up on this.

Every person that has tried it, loves it. I've gotten more requests for this recipe then any other. Changes I made: I sauted in butter small minced vidallia onion with 2 cloves garlic then added beer etc, reduced the cilantro to 1/8 cup, added 1 tbs chili powder.

I made this for a birthday party and although others at the party really liked it, I almost didn't take it because I didn't like the texture. The beans made it grainy and I just didn't care for it. Plus, I added extra salsa to give it punch. Overall, an o.k. dip. Personally, I wouldn't make it again but had to give out the recipe to a couple of people at the party.

I ran across this recipe in the 1999 September Millenium issue. We absolutely loved it everyone asked for the recipe. The only thing I changed was to use a jar of Pace Chipotle Salsa the smokey flavor add a lot umph. Every get together I am asked to make "that" dip. I definitely recommend it (It is also easy, easy) Don't use anyting but fresh cilatro.

Like the cook from Ellington, CT, we also made this for Super Bowl with light Velveeta and nonfat refried beans. I probably shouldn't make this again because I couldn't leave it alone.

I did this with a slight twist. I roasted green anaheim chilis - skinned, seeded and diced them as a replacement for the salsa. Then I added whole organic black beans instead of the refried beans. Although I never made the original recipe, this variation got rave reviews.

We did this dip for the Super Bowl. It was great! So it wouldn't be too much like heart-attack food we used Light Velveeta and no-fat refried beans, Newman's salsa and regular beer. We made it not spicy because of guests not liking hot food...but next time we think we'll make it with some hot peppers or habenero peppers just to kick it up a notch!! ;-)

This was horrible. Normally I tweak recipes, but this one I followed word for word--terrible! It had an overly heavy consistency, and, possibly due to the combination of the kind of beer I used (sam adams?), the kind of refried beans (lime-chilli), and the kind of salsa (chipotle), an absolutely awful taste. None of my guests ate any of this at all, and I wouldn't make any version of this recipe again.

Terrific!!! More bean-y than cheese-y. I made the recipe once with half the amount of cilantro and once with the full amount. We liked it better with half. I used some of the leftover dip in ground beef and cheese burritos topped with hot green chile. My husband pronounced them the best burritos he has ever had.
