Beautiful rice dish that went really well with a saucy chicken tikka masala. Instead of fresh chili I used powdered cayenne pepper, and I also omitted the nuts since I didn't have any, and it still came out great. Super flavorful, really nice texture with the mustard seeds.

Loved the flavor - Surprisingly not spicy but fragrant. Made as directed except omitted cashews, used less turmeric (personal preference) and grated lemon zest instead of strips of peel. This is definitely a keeper.

Flavorful and delicious; a great side for a grilled pork tenderloin and chutney entree. I did not have the chile so made the recipe without it. My rice took more time to cook so consider allowing extra time if you are sequencing your meal prep.
