I found this recipe when I needed vegetarian matzoh ball soup for some vegetarian friends one Passover; it was so much better than any chicken stock I've ever made that we've now switched entirely over. Very hearty and flavorful, and holds up well to extra spices.

Didn't think there'd be much to say about a "humble" vegetable stock, but it is very tasty! Mom always said that a good stock is the secret ingredient to a great soup or meal, so I'm passing this on to her. (Hi, Mom!) Made it as written.

I couldn't find any decent veg. stock in the grocery store and had most of the ingredients at home so I tried it. It's very good. In fact, I may use it even for the Thanksgiving recipes that I was planning on using chicken stock. I didn't have mushrooms (threw in a chopped tomato), too lazy to peel potatoes (quartered a few) and I had a lentil soup mix (instead of plain lentils). Better than I expected.
