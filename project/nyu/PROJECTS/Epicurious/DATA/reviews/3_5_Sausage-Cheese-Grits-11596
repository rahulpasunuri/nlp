I made this for a baby shower brunch and guests are still asking me for the recipe! I too added an additional jalapeno.

I followed the recipe the first time that I made this, and it was adequate. I added more salt, cheddar cheese, dry mustard, paprika, a little milk, and garlic salt to the grits layer. When I prepared the second layer, I sauteed the veggies in garlic olive oil, used 6 eggs, 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and used more cheese than the recipe calls for. This jazzed the recipe up enough that it was very popular at a covered dish meal. I also had a bowl of homemade salsa to use on the casserole as well. It was a good touch.

This certainly has the great taste of South Carolina "Low Country". I used one pepper and removed the seeds. Great with grilled shrimp and/or grilled fish!

I love sausage more than the air that I breathe. If you agree, you'll love this recipe. The hotter the sausage, the better for this dish!!!! My husband complained of heartburn for several days, but said it was worth it.
