Delicious! Refreshing and light with an original flavor. Next time a may even add a little bit more lemon juice for a little more tang.

Taste is refreshing, but so is cold watermelon. Used lime juice and blackberries. Good palate cleanser. Very light.

With my ice cream maker (freezable sleeve type) this turned out pretty grainy/slushy. Still, the flavor is wonderful. I'll have to try it again.
