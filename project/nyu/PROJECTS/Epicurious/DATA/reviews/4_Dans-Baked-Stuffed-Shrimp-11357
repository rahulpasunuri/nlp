Well, as others I took a lot of creative licensing with this one. I put an Italian flair on it. Stuffed the shrimp with scallops sauteed with lots of garlic, basil and parsley. Used Italian breadcrumbs as the binder. Added a generous handful of parmesan cheese. drizzled garlic butter over. Yum!

Easy, fast and incredibly gratifying to serve to company! I followed the recipe, but added siracha for some zing. I have a gluten allergy, so I had to substitute the Ritz crackers for Glutino Original, and I can attest that nobody was the wiser. Paired with roasted asparagus and a great Santa Barbara Winery chardonnay. Definitely a keeper!

Made this for Christmas Eve. I also omitted the mushrooms and buttered the dish. I used whole wheat Ritz crackers instead of regular. I couldn't find crab, so I used lobster and, although it was a tad sweeter with the lobster than with the crab, it worked well with the jumpo shrimp. I would make again.

I prepared this dish for our company Xmas party. It was good and the presentation was great. However, I didn't love it. I thought the stuffing was a little bland and too heavy, rich for the shrimp - maybe just not to my taste. There is a recipe with shrimp in a wine butter basil sauce on this website that I prefer.

From my previous post, also added 1/2 tsp. or so of Old Bay Seasoning.

I was looking for a stuffing to go with baked haddock and sea scallops and from all the reviews, found this to be so versatile. This was better than any baked stuffed seafood I've had at restaurants. I did not use mushrooms (husband doesn't like them) but would if making for others; for the broth I used 2 Tbl each of chix broth, sherry and white wine; and not as many Ritz crackers. From other reviewers, I buttered the dish and also added a little white wine - maybe too much liquid. No doubt this makes a great baked stuff shrimp, mushrooms, etc. Thanks Dan!

YUMMY! Halved the recipe for me & my husband. Used scallops, shallots rather than onion, sauv.blank rather than chicken broth and added old bay. Really needs 'colossal' shirmp.. bought 'jumbo' at whole foods that were about 16-20/lb so not quite ideal. I butterflied then laid them out in dish and spread topping over them. I squirted lemon juice over before drizzling butter. Baked for about 17 minutes.. could have run under broiler a quick sec cause were a bit soggy, but not too bad.. served with sauteed zucchini and summer squash. really tasty.

Transformed this recipe into a baked stuffed haddock recipe. Used scallops and shopped shrimp in the stuffing and omitted the mushrooms. Very good stuffing, though perhaps next time I will blend part of it in the cuisinart to make it a little smoother. Spooned aprox 3 tbsp into 4, 4inch filets of haddock and rolled them over. 20 minutes at 375 was a little too long. Next time I will do 15 minutes at 350, perhaps even a little shorter.

I have made this many times "as is," but last night I did this without any seafood in the stuffing (using 3/4 lb mushrooms) and whole wheat crackers instead of Ritz. Much better the original way, but if you're trying to conserve funds (by replacing the crab meat), it did work! Missed the buttery Ritz goodness, though.

My husband said - I would expect to have this meal at an expensive restaurant in Bermuda!!! Whow, he likes my cooking but not THAT much :). I changed the recipe a bit and used white wine instead of chicken broth, no celery and no parsley + I didn't measure any ingredients for the stuffing, just used loads of crab, loads of shitake & baby bella mushrooms and onions/garlic. I substituted Ritz cracers with the organic version and added fresh ground pepper & seasalt to taste. My husband loved the paprika on top and I baked the extra stuffing separately in the oven and served it on the side. LOVED IT!! Thank you for the phenomenal meal that is sure to become a holiday staple at our house!

I tried this out on my mom before I make it for my boyfriend's birthday this week and it turned out amazing. I think its one of the best things I've ever made. I used fresh crabmeat and definitely more than the recipe called for, 1/2 the ritz crackers, no celery, shallots, white wine for 1/2 the chicken broth, extra garlic and a mix of olive oil and butter. Also, I used added finely minced garlic and a small sliver of butter on top of each shrimp before baking. Delicious. Highly recommended!! Can't wait to make it again!

Only had medium shrimp on hand, which weren't worth stuffing, so layered the butterflied shrimp on the bottom of a casserole dish and then spread the stuffing on top. Sprinkled with a tablespoon of white wine and broiled a few minutes after the 20 minute baking time to get the top nice and golden brown. Easy and delicious. Was able to make with ingredients I aleady had (and almost always have) in my fridge and cupboard. I'l try a little Old Bay per other reviewers suggestions or perhaps drizzle with garlic butter rather than regular butter the next time around. But even "as is," this recipe is a keeper.

I haven't made baked stuffed shrimp in years. Mainly because I just haven't found a recipe that was worth the effort. But recently one of my sons has taken a liking to the dish at a fine restaurant here in New Haven. My husband and I found this recipe and decided to make it for my two sons and their wives. Let me tell you that I only was able to get one shrimp for myself. They were all raving about how good this dish was. Next time I will have to prepare more for this family! Everyone loved it! I made it with the crabmeat. Next time perhaps I will opt for the scallops. I am being told that this recipe wins over the fine New Haven restaurant dish!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. My husband and I are huge seafood lovers, and it is the first time I tried to do stuffed shrimp at home. I didn't have any crab or scallops, but we did sprinkle a few with some shredded swiss cheese before baking. Blended very well with the other flavours. We also used the Old Bay spice as suggested by others. I served the shrimp with a spinach and mushroom salad and garlic rice. We have no leftovers which is unusual for my husband and myself. I am looking forward to serving this at my next dinner party. I know my guests will love it!

OK, so I went a little off the recipe here, but since everyone else is talking about their changes, I thought I'd throw this one out there. I was interested in this recipe for the seafood stuffing more than the shrimp because I wanted to make Baked Stuffed Lobsters and had not yet found a recipe that I really liked. This stuffing was awesome. I used large sea scallops that I quartered and because I wanted the stuffing a little dryer, I omitted the broth and used 2T sherry and 2T white wine. I also used about a teaspoon of a spice mixture called Seafood Blend from a place called the Herb Patch in Vermont. (The spice blend works wonders for Lobster Thermadore.) Anyway, I butter poached the lobster meat using the recipe from the French Laundry cookbook and repacked it into the lobster and then packed the stuffing mix on top and I then drizzled some of the emulsified butter from the lobster poaching on top and baked at 375 for 20 minutes and broiled for 3 minutes to crisp up the stuffing. Absolutley wonderful!

I made the stuffed shrimp last night for my Husband's birthday - Excellent recipe! I used crabmeat (imitation kind, which was fine) and also followed the advice of others to use Old Bay seasoning in the stuffing and sprinkled some on top before baking. I used a slash of sherry and half the chicken broth I replaced with wine, as others did. Oh, and used shallots instead of onion. My only complaint, which is not the recipe's fault, is that I had asked for the jumbo shrimp and they were pretty small for jumbo. The larger ones would of taken the stuffing better and looked nicer than the smaller ones. Great recipe - will make again. Everyone thought they were wonderful.

I would only make this again with some modifications in the stuffing. I thought it was incredibly bland (I useds scallops) in color and in taste.

Hi Iowan: Old Bay is simply a seasoning for seafood (mostly) You will find it in your grocery store with all the rest of the spices. A little goes a long way. I think it's a little rectangular shaped tin, if my memory serves me well.

Rating: 0
Can't rate the recipe, since I made too many modifications to reasonably list. The shrimp and scallops (I used small bay scallops) were lovely together, though. I'm posting this hoping someone can tell me, a land-locked Iowan, what Old Bay seasoning actually is. I've heard of it, but as you might imagine, seafood is not our premier protein here in the Midwest. I know many of you will cringe when I suggest that I always thought throwing "some old bay" into the water to cook fish was, well, a waste of time. Educate me, please, you coastal persons, and thank you for doing so (kindly!).

Had company last night and these went quickly! Stuffing was delicious. I left out the mushrooms and squeezed a lemon over the shrimp and dusted with old Bay before cooking. Also used both scallops and jumbo lump crab in the stuffing. Used the jumbo shrimp - the 16-20 per pound and they were a great size for this kind of thing. Very good - this is definitely one that I will make again.

I wish I had read the reviews closer. I thought the stuffing is a little bland and seemed kind of soggy. The presentation was very nice though. Lots of oohhs when they came out of the oven.

This was so easy and so wonderful.... Did take the advice of others and add Old Bay seasoning and not as many Ritz crackers. WE used Jumbo shrimp and some freshly cooked and picked crab.

My husband said "I think this is the best dish you've ever made." I love to cook and have made a lot of "dishes". I used the stuffing on top of scallops, and chopped up scallop for the stuffing as well. I used Old Bay per the suggestions. I'm so glad I'm the adult and don't have to ask my Mom to make this for me...I can make it any time I want!! : )

First let me say that this is the kind of versatile dish (the stuffing) that lends itself to lots of uses. I had scallops and used the stuffing as a topping pressed onto the raw scallops in a buttered baking dish. I then baked them at 375 for 20 min. and finished them briefly under the broiler. Just fabulous. Also, the stuffing is easily tweaked. I added xtra mushrooms because i had them, as well as a little thyme. I love it when ingredient measuring does not have to be precise. Will definitely make again.

"this is on the money" so says my boyfriend, and this would be is favorite dish. I also agree that it was excellent. I used real crab meat for the stuffing and substituted 1/2 of the chicken broth for white wine.mmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Well, two things seem evident here after having read reviews and made the dish: It's good as is, and it's good with changes. Fresh ingredients always count, and fresh lump crabmeat along with big, fat shrimp add a lot. I, for one, added seasonings to the stuffing mixture: salt, pepper, cayenne, a pinch of thyme, a pinch of Old Bay. I used less crackers, less stock, etc. The wine in the baking pan was a nice touch. Excellent dish; crowd pleaser. 3.6 "forks" if I had to be precise.

Since this appears to be a free-for-all, I made my own changes, grabbing ideas from other cooks. I used clamshell mushrooms (earthy.com), white wine for 1/2 the broth, added about 1/2 tsp of Coleman's mustard and used Old Bay, as well, instead of paprika. I had 23 shrimp and only 7 guests, so I chopped up the 2 extra and added them to the scallop and crab mixture. I, too, used fewer crackers than were called for, and just for giggles, I used half of those new Keebler Baked Cornmeal Crackers instead of all Ritz. I also added the juice of half a lemon to the stuffing and drizzled more on top of the shrimp with the melted butter. Served it with a 5-wild mushroom risotto..I can feel my arteries clogging, hehe.

This recipe is simply fabulous, and absolutely cannot be made to taste or look bad. My guests always rave! I use a pound can of crabmeat from Trader Joe's, then double all the ingredients except the Ritz crackers, which I keep at 32. I use olive oil instead of butter, add Old Bay and 3 tblsp of Sherry. Any left over I use to stuff mushrooms and serve them alongside. Sounds redundant but my guests devour them. Before baking, I sprinkle with olive oil and old bay. I always make ahead of time and refrigerate. 20 minutes or so is still good timing. Enjoy!

Excellent dinner party fare and our company RAVED about it. I substituted shallots for the onions and added ~4 tbsp of sherry and ~1 1/2 tsp of old bay to the stuffing. I tripled the amount of garlic as well. Used lump crabmeat and felt the 32 Ritz crackers called for in the recipe overpowered the crab. Next time I will use less than half of the amount of Ritz crackers. Before baking, I put a small dollop of melted butter, lemon juice and fresh garlic over each shrimp. Outstanding!

Rating: 4
This is a classic. I'd use less of the Ritz crackers to avoid it being too dry. Second time around I used breadcrumbs instead. Also important is if using lump crabmeat, don't skimp and get the cheap one because it's laden cartlidge/shells. Next time I'm going try the imitation crabmeat which I think would be just fine.

This dish was good, but I think my expectations, as a result of the reviews, was much higher. Followed reviewer suggestions re: sherry and shallots.

Made this dish for New Year's eve dinner. I found that even with the added sherry, the stuffing was so-so.

I then melted this paste and drizzled it over the shrimp before baking it. It was delicious!!!!

We made this last night for New Year's eve. It was wonderful!!! I used our local Alaska king crab for the stuffing, replaced the onions w/ shallots as recommended, and splashed the sherry in as well. Just a note: Make sure to count out the 32 crackers, since "2/3 of a 12 ounce package" (as noted in the recipe) would be too many -- almost double.

I made this recipe for company this weekend and it was outstanding. All of my guests raved about the shrimp. I used crabmeat for the stuffing and used shallots instead of onions. I think the onions might have been overwhelming, shallots are mild and sweet. I also used sherry as another cook suggested. You can't go wrong with this dish.

This was a great dish. I used crushed seasoned croutons instead of ritz crackers. I also used a generous amount of grated parmesan/romano cheese. The sherry was a good addition also.

This was one of the best new recipes I've made in years, and I've been cooking for many. Everybody loved it and asked for the recipe. This is a definite "keeper."

FABULOUS!!!! I made this for Christmas Eve dinner for my husband's family and they RAVED about the shrimp. I took another reviewers advice and added 2 tablespoons sherry to my mix. Even better the next day reheated!

We made this recipe with crab meat and it was delicious. Following this recipe is easy enough for any cook to make this dish, and it is truly one to be saved. Can't wait to try it with scallops.

Excellent for a special occasion meal. I made this for my mother's birthday and everyone really liked it. The filling was very buttery and the crackers gave it a slight crispness. Better than a lot of stuffed shrimp I've had in restaurants.

Very easy and good. I would cut down on the butter and add some lemon juice next time. Also, if the shrimp will not immediately be put in the oven, allow the stuffing to cool completely before adding it to the shrimp.

This recipe is nothing short of a gourmet meal. My family and I enjoyed this recipe, from the start of the preparation, to the actual dining experience. The Kicker? We had to go out... and when we returned an hour later, our house still smelled wonderful!

Made this as a first course for a dinner party and found myself with a dilemma. Recipe calls for 32 crackers or 2/3rds of 12 oz pkg. 2/3rds of the package is actually 68 crackers...So, I started with 32, the stuffing seemed wet, so I went to 2/3rds. They got rave reviews from my guests, but I kept wondering if I made them right. Please let me know the correct amount to use for next time....Maybe they could be even more delicious!

I made this dish for a romantic evening with my boyfriend. He loved it! He said it was the best stuffed shrimp he has ever had. He even wants me to cook it when his parents come to visit.

I've made these twice for a dinner party and they were a big hit. The best recipe I've come across yet for baked stuffed shrimp.

Excellent - we loved it. I serve it garnished in individual dishes as an appetizer. (Also very good with baby clams substituted for the scallops.)
