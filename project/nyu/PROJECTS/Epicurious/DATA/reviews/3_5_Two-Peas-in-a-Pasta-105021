This was excellent. Served as a side dish with salmon. Did not have fresh peas, just used frozen. Will definitely make again.

Why is this old recipe under "What's New" and there are only 2 pages of actual new recipes? Frustrating!

Get this recipe off of "What's New" please!

Why is this recipe always under the "new recipes" section? It was printed in 2001!

This was pretty good. Much as I love leeks, I rarely have them in the house so I substituted shallots. Based on reviews, I omitted the water. But the sauce was still very runny. In the future I would omit the water and only use half the amount of chicken broth. I used regular fettuccine (not nests). I nearly omitted the lemon zest but was so glad I added it; it really made the dish better.

I think I've made this recipe once a week for the past month (ever since sugar snap peas were in season). I love it! I don't even bother with the lemon zest or parsley anymore. If I have leeks I'll put them in, but otherwise I just use onions. It makes for a great, simple, weeknight dinner.

I had left over sugar snap peas from a cocktail party and some left over baked salmon so I used this recipe and took the advice of other reviewers I used 1/2 & 1/2 and also reduced the amount of all liquids- I did not use the 3/4 cp of water and added a tablespoon of pesto I had in the freezer when I added the peas, and I added the cooked chunks of salmon into the sauce to warm prior to tossing w/the pasta- it was delicious on the fresh pasta- adding t

We added diced ham to ours but know we would have liked it just as well without.

I thought this was really good. I used the suggestion of another review to use nonfat milk and half & half to decrease the creaminess. I loved the flavors and the fresh summer ingredients. It makes a ton, so we will be having leftovers!

Very yummy and flavorful. I used 1/2 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 and 1/2 cup of skim milk and it was plenty rich. Will do again.

This recipe is soooooo good. I make it all the time. Only change I make is to use frozen peas only and no snow peas. I always have those on hand so it's easier. I add a little grilled chicken sliced up and less pasta and it's a great meal!

Delicious! and easy. I used sugar snap peas instead of snow peas. Put in at same time as regular peas. Used whole milk instead of cream and water but should have cut back total volume to about 1 1/4 cups.

I only had green beans on hand and half and half so I substituted those instead. But this still came out delicious! I also added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up. I think it made a good lower fat alternative!

This recipe is great!! I would just cut down on the peas a little, but my family likes it with all of the peas (which is A LOT!). It is easy and fun to make, and takes no more than 40 minutes. Get the family to help and it will be even quicker. This is a delicious recipe that I have made MANY times. It is perfect and has never let me down!

I love this dish. It's very simple and quick, but doesn't taste it. I use fat-free half-and-half instead of the heavy cream, and it's still wonderful.

Though the taste was fresh, there wasn't a lot of flavor and the sauce was too thin. I added some garlic, which helped.

This is a very yummy fairly light meal. It is very easy to make and I enjoyed the leftovers for a while. When I made this for two people, I still used 1 lb. of pasta but only 1/2 of everything else. A very simple meal that will please almost everyone

This was a great recipe for the beginning of spring -- very refreshing flavors and easy to prepare. I only used half of the chicken broth and heavy cream (to cut down on the fat as the summer approaches!) and added more snap peas and fresh peas. Enjoy!
