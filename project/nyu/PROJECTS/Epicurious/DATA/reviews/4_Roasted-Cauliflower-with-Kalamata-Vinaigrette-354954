Delicious! Like others, I roasted florets instead of the large slices. Wouldn't change anything else about this. I'm just sad that I didn't have more cauliflower, because one medium-sized head wasn't enough to use all of the vinaigrette. I wanted to keeping eating it. The lemon-olive-garlic flavor is addictive. Will definitely make this again.

Fantastic. Made this with purple cauliflower and the crispy golden edges were really striking - I'm for the "steaks" as they're more dramatic and allow for caramelization along the entire flat side (and you'll end up with a few florets anyway). I threw 2 cloves of garlic in with the cauliflower and added the roasted garlic to the vinaigrette -- SO GOOD. I recommend adding the chopped kalamata to taste to keep the vinaigrette balanced.

Awesome way to do cauliflower. I agree that roasting florets works great and is easier. I like this both hot and room temperature, so it is great for a buffet dish. Even people who don't like cauliflower liked this. No leftovers for this one!

Made this last night and my husband and I devoured it. Slicing the cauliflowers into steaks is unnecessary. Just roast the florets and throw the sauce on top. Yum!

This is the best cauliflower recipe ever. I followed the instructions except I cooked the cauliflower in the middle of the oven, not on the lower rack. This allowed the vegetable to caramelize nicely and not burn.

Delicious and so simple. Mainly followed recipe, though sliced the cauliflower thinner and used another kind of black olives.

I don't normally love cauliflower but this was a GREAT way to serve it. I added extra garlic and probably a bit too much on the chopped olive front so sauce was a bit more overpowering than it should have been (read: stick to the measurements in recipe!) but still wonderful. Can obviously make the vinaigrette well ahead of time. Easy to prepare, great as a starter or side.

I served this as a first course at a vegetarian dinner party for 4. The meat-and-potato lover wasn't convinced to like cauliflower, but the rest of us liked it. The roasted cauliflower has a nice savory flavor that is enhanced with the richness of the kalamata olives. It was good for a dinner party because I roasted the cauliflower and made the vinaigrette before everyone arrived, then plated it quickly.

I used "cheddar" cauliflower from the farmers' market. A refreshing light way to prepare cauliflower. Essentially if you like Mediterranean flavors, you will like this dish. The subtle flavor of the cauliflower is easily overwhelmed by the sharper flavors of the dressing - a dressing that is pretty much good on anything that it touches. Good but not memorable.

Rating: 4
I made this and threw in some red peppers that I roasted at the same time. It was pretty darn good, though strong flavors that you should be careful with pairing. I think it didn't match my friend's southern food meal very well!

I used florets instead of slicing the cauliflower, and cooked them on 350 for 35-45 mins. The dressing is good, but not essential if you don't have time, since the cauliflower come out so delicious on their own - very nutty and a little sweet. I added a little OJ to the dressing (~1/2 to 1 tablespoon).

I have never liked cauliflower, but had some given to me from the garden. I found this recipe and figured "what the heck, I love Kalamatas, I can push the cauliflower to the side if it's awful". Well, surprise of all surprises, this recipe is fantastic! I have a new favorite vegetable, and it's roasted cauliflower! Roasting it makes the edges crispy brown and delicious, and then putting the vinegarette on top is the bonus. This recipe is super easy, and is one of those "hidden gems" I love finding on this website!

This is a fantastic recipe....has converted friends who don't like cauliflower to them requesting it. The roasting with the vinaigrette gives this bland vegetable great flavor depth. It's a keeper!

I used extra garlic and extra lemon juice. I served it with vegetarian Italian "sausage in a tomato oregano sauce and quinoa. My husband and I both enjoyed it. He said it is the best cauliflower he's ever had.

Wow! Head of cauliflower in the fridge that needed cooking and looking for something to do that was quick. My husband and I both looked at each other and said "this is definitely a do-over". The olives are salty enough so in our opinion additional salt wasn't necessary. I got the leftovers the next day. Before getting them into the microwave for a re-heat I ate them all at room temp. Just as delicious as the night before if not better.

This is such a fantastic recipe! I would never have paired olives and cauliflower on my own, it's such a delicious suggestion. Oven-roasting imparts such a nice, smoky flavor to the cauliflower, and the vinaigrette is perfection. This is my new favorite way to eat it!

I always roast cauliflower and this recipe is very good way. The kalamata vinaigrette is what sets this apart from other recipes. I did reduce the olive oil, so my 'vinaigrette' was thick, but that did not detract from enjoying this dish. I followed the suggestion of others and used a food processor to blend the garlic, lemon juice, oil and kalamata. This is definitely a keeper.

We have a dear friend who often stays with us for extended visits. As a thank you, she always cooks us her "special" version of Indian cauliflower. We have suffered through weeks of it. The last time she left, alas, there was still one more dreaded head of cauliflower in the fridge. I made this recipe and my husband and I almost ate the entire thing, while only pecking at our accompanying home raised organic lamb chops. The chops were great, but the cauliflower was to die for! I will never NOT have caulflower in the fridge again! Beautiful presentation and delicious. (PS. I went for the little remaining caulifower the next day for a snack and someone had already beaten me to it!)

I did the flowerette cutting option. Cutting the big ones in half lengthwise. I used a food processor for the garlic and olives. Really delicious and easy.

Amazingly savory and easy. It's so good, I don't always make the kalamata sauce. When eaten alone, the cauliflower has a mashed potato taste and quality about it that makes it easy to substitute the starches in anyone's diet!

Simple and fantastic -- will definitely make again. I made the slices, but accidentally ended up with some half-florets, too. The florets ended up being better than the slices -- there was more texture, more to sink your teeth into, and the vinaigrette stuck to them nicer than to the big slices. I also added about a half teaspoon of marjoram for a little sweetness. Would probably be nice with some fresh thyme or rosemary as well.

Yum! Great presentation for cauliflower. Don't toss the slices! They will fall apart. Brush with oil.

Excellent. I sprinkled the cauliflower with herbed sea salt, added more garlic (always), and some Italian parsely, and then coarsely chopped the vinaigrette ingredients. I tossed the cauliflower with the vinaigrette, a rinsed and drained can of garbanzo beans (16 oz.), and 1/2 lb. (before cooking, though 1 lb. would work as well for a more carb-heavy meal, or to feed a few more people) of tagliatelle, and then sprinkled the plates with shredded parmesan to make an entree for 4. My new go-to recipe for cauliflower.

I brushed the olive oil on the slices of cauliflower because I didn't want to break the slices. Forgot to salt and pepper them, added it later and it didn't seem to matter. The vinaigrette was divine, I did mine in the blender, it balanced the sweet, nutty roasted cauliflower perfectly. Cant wait to make this again. Been thinking about it all day!

Superb. It was a hit with my family, and we will definitely make it again. I used a mini Cuisinart to process the dressing; the texture was perfect...I used a fresh Meyer lemon from our tree.

Hubby truly enjoyed this. He loves tangy flavors such as what the dressing in this recipe is and I like the different spin on the same old type of vegetable. Next time I will roast it as instructed but prior to serving cut up the cauliflower into traditional florets then in a bowl toss the florets with the dressing prior to serving.

Yum! Great roasting recipe- cauliflower came out really well. The dressing would have been better if I had puréed it instead of chopping the olives and garlic. Overall, quite tasty.

Grilled cauliflower with olive oil alone was good enough. Next time will add more olive oil and cook at higher temperature for less time. I don't think the kalamata vinaigrette complimented the dish. The lemon juice was a bit runny too.

Wow! So simple yet so fabulous. I hadn't thought cauliflower could hold up so well on it's own (usually roast with combination of veggies), but the olives added the right complexity, and the olive oil allowed it to caramelize ever so slightly in the pan. Definitely use a pan with sides though! I once used my flat baking sheet and almost burned the house down from the olive oil dripping. Oh well, every cook has her ditz moment.

I have made this twice, and really like it. The one problem with this recipe is that with this much oil and this much heat, the kitchen can get pretty smokey. I wonder if panfrying it would be almost as good...

Delicious as is! I've been roasting cauliflower for a while now, so this recipe really isn't "new to me," but it's still delicious and easy! I bet you could easily sub capers for the kalamata olives and have equally delicious results...

Wonderful! I added a bit of balsamic vinegar to it and it turned out fantastic. It went really well with some roasted beer. Full, earthy and with a bite to it. Just don't let the cauliflower get overdone though, or it will get a bit bitter.

Delicious, easy, and appealing looking. One note - the photo is a little misleading. Only the center sections will look like that. The other slices that don't have the core attached will fall apart and look more like sliced florets. They still taste great, just don't look as pretty. The most time consuming part of this recipe is flipping all the little pieces over half-way through cooking.

Great side dish - I couldn't believe it when my husband finished almost the whole dish. I was out of lemon juice so instead I combined the olive oil, kalamata olives, some sun-dried tomatoes and a dollop of creme fraiche. I drizzled it over the top of the cauliflower with some fresh rosemary for the last 5 minutes of cooking. Delicious way to enjoy an otherwise bland vegetable.

I bought the ingredients for the vinagrette but after cooking all the dinner, I must admit I was a little lazy to do it... so I simply roasted the cauliflower. My husband asked me why I made so little!!! He loved the cauliflower as is, and cutting lenghtwise makes it interesting. I will add it to my weekly menu, maybe next time I will do the vinagrette that can only be delicious. How can you go wrong with kalamatas??

I made this with Sicilian green olives because that's what I had on hand, and I was inspired by the recipe for Spaghetti with Cauliflower, Green Olives, and Almonds (on this site) which sounds strange but has become a regular part of my repertoire. Simple and delicious!

This is absolutely delicious. It is so easy. I made it for a starter for dinner, but later in the evening, I had it cold. It was great that way also. I have learned that roasting the cauliflower really enhances the flavor. When I make cream of cauliflower soup I now roast the cauliflower as part of the process.

The combination of cauliflower and Kalamata olive were definitely an unchartered taste in my household but my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. The roasted cauliflower has a subtle sweet flavor which combines well with the saltiness and citrus from the Kalamata vinaigrette. We like garlic a lot so we added one more clove. It's simple, healthy, and delicious. It also looks really nice on a plate!

I am a fan of roasted cauliflower but the Kalamata Vinaigrette took my palate to another level. I did not follow the recipe to the letter regarding measurements so I think I may have added a little more lemon juice than advised. Nonetheless I found it to be a terrific complement to the soft flavor of the cauliflower. Unlike the other reviewer I cooked it for 25 minutes and the texture was perfect, maybe it depends on the oven. Also this is super easy and I imagine would impress a crowd.

just tried this one for dinner tonight, great recipe. of course i had to adjust it because my boyfriend does not like olives, so i just substituted with some nice briny capers for the vinaigrette. i am sure the kalamata olives take it to another dimensions, but i was very happy with the results! notes: i added more lemon juice to thin out the vinaigrette.

I doubled the recipe using the extra vinaigrette over chicken cutlets prepared milanese style (flour, egg, crumb). I crumbed 2 day old sourdough baguette before it turned to stone-this recipe is a keeper.
