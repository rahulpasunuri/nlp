Nice recipe, easy and simple enough to pair along side something a bit more substantial. Understand that two forks is still considered "good"; I prefer to save my "delicious" and "exceptional" forks for dishes that are really out of this world. Carrying on - I was really pleased with the crispness of the dressing, and surprised to learn that I actually enjoy radishes when put with the right other ingredients. (I've harbored somewhat of an aversion to the little red vegetables ever since a lousy food poisoning incident when I was very little. This was something I'm sure you find monumental, and I'm sure something you will be printing with other reviews when you keep this recipe...) Ultimately, yes, I would make this again, but maybe would try another array of greens for the salad (something other than endive; the mâche was quite nice, though). Also, I've since used the dressing for other salads, as it is the real star of the recipe, and have it in my permanent rotation. Enjoy :)

Very good, especially if you like vinegar! I tried it the way the recipe calls but then added a little more acutal champagne ( not the pricey stuff either!) and used spiced pecans.. the difference was notable. Great nonetheless

I found the dressing a little too acidic, but with the addition of about a teaspoon of pure maple syrup, it became delicious. Add a little at a time to taste. I served it over a mixed green salad with candied walnuts and dried cherries.

I used this recipe just for the dressing, which came out delicious and garnered many compliments. Since I made it at the last minute and didn't have shallots or chives, I just used finely chopped scallions. Also I used Trader Joe's orange muscat champagne vinegar which gave the dressing a great flavor, and simply tossed it with a spring mix salad (out of the bag!), chopped, peeled D'Anjou pear, and spiced pecans. Yummy.

I thought this salad dressing was simple and outstanding- the salad itself was okay. I have used the dressing several times on different green salads and it has always been a hit.

I liked this, didn't love it. Very so-so. Presently, I am lacking the creativity to tweak this to deliciousness!

We had this Christmas day, and everyone agreed it was a hit. We've made it several times since then with continued great results.
