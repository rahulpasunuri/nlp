I did a lot of substitutions and it still tasted good. Instead of limes, i used lemons and instead of coconut milk I used whip cream I also added fresh ginger and a splash of wine before adding the cream.

Bland. Nothing else to say.

I tested this with ling cod for a Caribbean themed party and ended up making it with red snapper. Both worked fine but we found the recipe surprisingly bland as written as noted by earlier reviewers. The second time around I added a large tablespoon on minced fresh ginger with the garlic and leek. This seemed to give it just the zip it needed. The ginger didn't overpower the fish, coconut or lime, it just blended beautifully with them. Be sure to let the sauce cook until thickened because the fish will give off quite a bit of liquid. Also, I found that baking the fish 15-17 minutes and letting it rest on top of the counter while you put dinner on the table yielded perfect fish each time.

Oh, did not use Black Cod. Used Atlantic Cod.

I made this for us for valentines day - it is special. I probably upped the lime juice (fresh squeezed) and maybe a bit more coconut milk than called for but basically followed it pretty closely (I'm not one to measure to precisely). We highly recommend it!!

the recipe is a good jump off point. I made a few changes and additions to it and it turned out realy well. Definitely a keeper. I dont like leeks so I skipped those. I dreged the cod in cornmeal to add a bit of texture. plus I sauted the garlic with green onions and tomatoes. I used lemon juice and lemon zest since I had no limes. the seasoning is pretty light in this recipe so I jazzed it up with cracked black pepper, fish sauce, rice vinegar and a tablespoon of sugar to balance the acidity. Very Very Delcious in the end!

I had 2 packages of black cod, neither was big enough for the two of us and both was too much. I decided to make it all and figure out what to do with the leftovers. This made a great taco! I made my own corn tortillas, thickened the sauce and added avocado and my husband thought it was great. Very, very good.

I almost never give 4 forks, but this deserves it. I made it with fresh halibut, the coconut rice, mojo onions (from this site) and a mango and pineapple salsa and it was to die for.

This was delicious and I'll make it again. But NOT with black cod. I was so disappointed!Black cod is such a luscious, buttery (and expensive) fish in its own right; adding the coconut milk was too much of a good thing. The end result was unappealingly "greasy." I will definitely make the recipe again, but using a cheaper, drier fish - perhaps Atlantic cod even.

This was very good. My husband caught black cod in Alaska last summer and we have been trying different ways to cook it and this is a hit. I added crushed red pepper to the sauce because we like chile with lime and coconut.

A great recipe, I added quite a bit more lime juice than it called for, as well as a bit more garlic and lime zest. Very flavorful. Will make again.

Very easy and quick to make, but rather bland as recipe is written. I imagine that this recipe is a good starting point, but needs re-working.

Nice dish, not spectacular, but good and very easy. To be fair, I changed some ingredients. I don't care for leeks and just used green onions, and I used tilapia. Still, it was tasty, quick, easy, and my family cleaned their plates!

I have been doing this new house favorite a few times now and we love it!!! I was surprised by the small amount of sauce to pour on the fish the first time, but don't worryù; the fish will make some juices while cooking that will mix with the sauce and give this very tasty and flavorful dish. I serve this with jasmine rice. A keeper!!!

I thought this was easy and delicious. I used regular cod and light coconut milk. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change anything.

We normally love coconut/lime flavors together, but somehow this just didn't meld well. Maybe the leeks? I followed the directions exactly, and while it wasn't bad, it really was not anything special. Easy, but I still won't bother with this one again.

Very good. I used diced onion instead of leeks and cut the whole thing in half. Nice blend of flavors. Made this with Orange Roughy, since this is what was fresh.

this was really easy and very good. my husband is NOT the fish guy...it's not that he doesn't like fish, but he's a red meat kinda guy. but he said this was the best fish i've made. i was a little skeptical b/c when i tasted the sauce in the pan, it didn't taste all that great, but that was before the lime zest was added. out of the oven, it was fantastic. oh yeah, i also probably added twice as much of the coconut milk (used light).

My husband used to be a chef and is our "fish" guy....so i made this with trepidation. No worry, he declared it "Restaurant quality" . It was fresh, easy and my kids loved it too. I'm making it again!

I will try this recipe. However, a question: tomatoes are mentioned in the blurb about an inspired Dominican recipe. Yet when I googled pescado con coco, none of those recipes contained tomatoes....

I really like Thai food, especially with the coconut and garlic flavor combination. I had high expectations for this (and even added extra garlic, which I always do) but found this bland and boring.I followed the recipe, but it just didn't work well.

I messed up the sauce by cooking it down too much. i made the mistake of watching the clock instead of the sauce. it became kind of a paste which i put on top of the fish and cooked as directed. despite my mistake it was delicious. will definitely make again, hopefully correctly
