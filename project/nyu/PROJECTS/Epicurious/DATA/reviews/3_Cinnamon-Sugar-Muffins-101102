I just want to note for all that this recipe is essentially the basic muffin recipe found in the Joy of Cooking. While it isn't technically plagiarism, it's too similar to be coincidental, IMO! BTW, the Joy's muffins always turn out picturesque, in case you're looking for a no-fail muffin.

tastes good but when I baked them, the batter overflowed and basically "exploded". it ended up looking terrible and the topping made a mess all over the pan because of the "explosion". but yeah, it tastes okay.

These tasted good, but I thought they were too dry. I made 2 batches, the first batch as stated. The second batch I added vanilla and used 1/2 brown sugar. The second batch was tastier.

I really liked these muffins. I replaced half of the regular flour with whole wheat flour and then added a bit more butter to complement the whole wheat flour. They turned out great in the right amount of time, the only thing I didn't like is that the muffins were a tad dry. Also- don't use all of the topping, it's just toooo much.

These muffins are delicious! I did modify based on some of the reviews and we are trying to be healthier- subsituted some oatmeal for flour, added 1T flaxseed meal and 1T brewers yeast, and also added 1t vanilla. Swirled some of the topping into the mix and still didn't use it all. Will use it again next time, because this recipe is going in the book!

Thank you to all the reviewers! You make it SO much easier for us who follow. I made single batch of 24 mini muffins (15 min; conv @350).I dashed in vanilla but otherwise stayed faithful. My twist was to combine 1 1/2 tsp butter with 2 tbls of cin/sugar mix and "paint" the muffins hot from the oven. I'm not a nutmeg fan, but these are melt in your mouth tasty.

These were a good recipe, and I tweaked it a little bit to suit my tastes. I left out the nutmeg (totally by accident) and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup cinnamon chips. They taste similar to cinn/sugar donuts! Very moist, tender and good for a sweet (but not too sweet) snack.

Way too much salt - cut it in half

Perfect for my family; kids loved them. Delicious, easy, quick. Doubled the recipe & made 12; used combo of all-purpose and whole wheat flour, white & brown sugar. The only thing I didn't double is the cinnamon sugar; used the 1/4 cup and not even all of that, and there was plenty. Next time may use another reviewer's idea of sprinkling some in the middle of the batter. Thought these might be a little tough because the batter was very thick, but they're very tender. Happy to find a muffin recipe my kids like.

I would defiantly make these muffins again, but I found that this recipe calls for to much nut meg. It is also a great recipe to try adding some new things to your muffins, such as Honey Bunches of Oats, Just Bunches, Cereal.

Great basic recipe, quick and easy to make with things that are always on hand. I used whole wheat flour, and they still turned out well.

I didn't have any nutmeg so I substituted cardamom and a dash of cinnamon and ground cloves. Delicious! I also used butter spread instead of real butter - worked just fine, and lower fat. Really easy and tasty.

...It's been said that what differentiates a muffin from a cupcake is whether or not it can tolerate a pat of butter without being ridiculous... and these muffins do exactly that. I added a some of the usual fall spices and switched out the white sugar for brown, and added some raisins, used half wheat and half regular flour, and I think they're quite delightful. :-) Not too sweet at all, but also not "un-sweet". A great brunch muffin.

This is really more a review of the reviews, since I made a version heavily influenced by the recommendations below. I used half white, half white whole wheat flour (love this King Arthur product!), half white, half brown sugar, and added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/3 cup of rolled oats to the dry ingredients. I layered a bit of cinnamon sugar in the middle and on top of the muffins - not an amount that even approximates 1/4 cup, though. My husband hates sweet things in the morning, but offered an unsolicited compliment on these - pretty yummy in a simple kind of way. I might add even more oatmeal next time and make a more traditional crumble topping with pecans, oats, etc. Best thing is this is fast and made with things you always have on hand. Not fancy, but a solid go-to option.

Loved this recipe. The perfect grab and go breakfast. I added some oatmeal and used half wheat flour. It's the first muffin not too sweet for my husband.

Rating: 4
My boys LOVED them and so did I. Doubled the recipe. Used half white and half brown sugar when creaming butter. Added a couple of shakes of cinnamon to the flour mixture too. Didn't use all of the topping - sprinkled a little between layers of batter and then a little on top. Only used a couple of teaspoons in total. I added a little raw hawaiian sugar to the top for a little sparkle and crunch. Next time will put some in the middle too!!!

followed the recipe and added some glazed pecans to it. thought it would be much better than it turned out the muffins were dense and the suger topping just didnt work it made the top even harder. i might consider trying this again but then again i might not

Great muffins. Light and fluffy. I made mine convection 350 for 20min. All of the topping falls off so add a little butter it so it sticks to the top better, or mix the topping into the batter. Recipe calls for just the right amount of sugar. Yum!

May sub whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour. Increases fiber content.

I took several suggestions from reviewers: Added 1/3 c. rolled oats, 1/4 t. cinnamon & 1/4 c. sugar to batter. Also added 1/2 c. chpd walnuts to batter. Layered cin/br.sugar mixture with batter. Subbed brown sugar for the white sugar. Pressed a few rolled oats & chpd walnuts on top of each muffin with the cin/brown sugar mixture. Do not overmix batter. May add 1/4 t. baking soda & chpd apples next time. Or try with blueberries. Delicious! Have made several time & will continue.

Rating: 3
Delicious! However, I completely agree with the other cooks who cut down on the sugar topping - I only used about a soupspoonsworth across all six muffins and that was perfect - just sweet enough. I had a few leftover blueberries so just pressed a few into half the batch and the combination of the sweet fruit with the slightly spicy muffin was great. This is also the first muffin recipe I've actually managed to get right - really really easy, even without an electric mixer.

I also used whole wheat flour and almond extract and tried the jelly in the center. I think I would make muffins whole next time and serve with jelly but they were really quite delicious. With the wholewheat and almond tastes very wholesome. I will try with splenda and egg beaters next time.

Well after reading the reviews above, I decided to change it up abit. I used whole wheat flour (just because) and added a sprinkling of oats for texture. I nixed the cinnamon and added almond flavoring instead. Then I layered a drop of strawberry preserves in the centre of the muffin. Very tasty surprise. Few mistakes I made though....I used salted butter and still added the salt (oops) and I definately overmixed they came out flat on top (oops again). BUT they tasted great. Good for home... a better chef than me could probably make it company worthy!

These were good and I'd make again. They remind me of the old Drake's coffee cakes. A lot of the cinnamon sugar came off the muffin tops--I might layer some of it inside next time.

I found this recipe when looking for something simple to have around on busy school mornings. These muffins are easy to make and simple in taste. Not too sweet, not too heavy (not heavy at all, really). I keep a jar of the cinnamon/sugar ready in the pantry. I've found that it works nicely to fill the muffin cups half way, sprinkle a little cinnamon/sugar, then finish filling the cup and adding a dash more of the cinnamon/sugar on top.

My kids love these. They are very quick and easy. I make them the mini size and it is hard to not eat too many. I have even been out of butter and used vegetable oil instead and once even used applesauce in place of a fat. Still turned out great.

these are so light and fluffy..but i agree with other reveiws, they aren't like normal muffins...more like cake. i use whole wheat flour and cut way back on the topping (it's too sweet!! enough to make your teeth scream!) or use brown sugar instead. they are so yummy though....i love how moist and light they are. these are great to make for brunch

I thought this recipe was delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers and added about 1/4 c. more sugar to the batter. I also added 1/8 t. of cinnamon to the batter. The muffins are much lighter than normal muffins. I might try using brown sugar for the topping next time I make them.

I was a little disappointed to find that the muffins weren't very sweet, but they were still good. Lighter and fluffier texture than regular muffins. They came out like little snack cakes. I made them exactly as-is, but cut the amount of topping in half based on previous reviewers comments - this was a good tip from everyone - the recipe calls for WAY too much topping. I will make these muffins again, but will add more sugar to the batter to give them a sweeter flavor.

They were ok, They aren't on my top list of muffins, but my mom loved them. the recipe makes a lot of topping, so halfing it might be a good idea. Also the muffins turned out kind of mushy, there are definalty better muffins out there.

This is a great muffin recipe. We've eliminated a lot of sugar from our food & find this fine. I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon and some raisins to the batter. Then made a variation: Reduced sugar by 2T, added 1/3 cup rolled oats (2/3 cup flour), 1 tsp cinnamon, 2/3 cup chopped apples, 1/4 tsp baking soda.

I was unimpressed with this recipe. The muffins weren't very sweet,the consistency was a little strange. There are great muffin recipes on this site and this sure wasn't one of them.

If you found these muffins to be lackluster then you probably overmixed or overbaked because they are truly a delicious, simple pleasure. If watched and removed at that exact critical moment, before the brown-ness is visible in the oven, they are so moist and tender that you cannot resist their warm goodness. Great with coffee, milk, hot chocolate, or even fruit. One of the recipes I keep laminated in my binder.

I loved this recipe! I was looking for a nice breakfast food...not anything overwhelming or with a strong taste. These muffins were perfect. I agree with many other reviewers that the recipe makes way to much topping, so I mixed most of it in with the muffins (adding all of it made the muffins a bit too thick for my taste - not as light and fluffy). Adding it made them even better!!

I guess I made this recipe cause it looked simple and quick. I would have to agree with others that said they are bland and not very exciting. I followed the recipe exactly as given. However, I think I should have chopped some walnuts and added them to the sugar and cinnamon mixture and sprinkled some as an inside layer to the muffin as well as on top.

I made this yesterday morning for breakfast.. I, too was surprised by some of the negative reviews. I thought they were delicious! No ,they are not sweet but that is okay!! The texture is perfect & I liked the cinnamon/sugar topping. I didn't quite use all of it. I will make again!!

I was surprised to read some of the reviews for this fabulous recipe. These muffins are simple but not boring, and do not need a million additions. When made properly are tinder, light and not greasy at all. My 10 and 12 year olds request this all the time. The only change I make is to cut down on the amount of topping.

The recipe looked a bit plain so I added the grated rind of an orange and some dried cranberries also 1/2 tsp cinnamon along with the nutmeg. It was a very dry mix so I had to add a drop more milk as well. They turned out tasty but were nothing special. I think there are better muffin recipes to use.

This muffin had a nice, light flavor but I was disappointed by the amount of grease that was in the bottom 1/5 of each muffin. When set on a napkin, these definitely left a very dark oil spot. I will make these again - but with half of the butter.

My three year old daughter LOVED these muffins. I like my muffines loaded with goodies, but she always specifies PLAIN - no berries, no nuts, no raisins, etc. And she's not a fan of corn muffins, so these fit the bill perfectly. And the ingredients are always in our pantry, making for a fun, rainy-day activity together!

This is one of my favorite recipes, but I noticed this version has an ingredient, the 1/3 cup sugar on the same line as the butter which may cause someone to miss it. If baking ahead for brunch/breakfast be careful not to overbake - golden brown under the sugar topping looks good but may be a little overdone for the purpose, causing the muffins to be dry and not hold well.

These muffins came out very salty tasting, even with all the cinnamon sugar on top, and they dried out overnight though stored in an airtight container as recommended. Every plate at brunch had part of this muffin left uneaten.
