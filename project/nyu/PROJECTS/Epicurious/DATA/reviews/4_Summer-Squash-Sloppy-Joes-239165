Excellent dinner! I used broccoli slaw in addition to the zucchini and onion. I also added fresh tomatoes, skinned instead of tomato paste. Came out delicious.

I made a vegetarian version of this (it turns out that turkey doesn't keep even in the freezer for two years!), and it was delicious. Concur with other reviews that say to add a little spicy sauce and some ketchup. Delish.

Wish I had paid more attention to those who rated this highly but also added more flavorful ingredients. The recipe as written is awfully bland. I will not make these again but will try to incorporate shredded squash into a tastier recipe.

This is really good. I doubled the recipe using boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I ground in the food processor. I added 2T.cider vinegar, a chipped red bell pepper, some hot sauce and a bit of brown sugar per another rater's suggestion. I love recipes that incorporate a lot of vegetables and aren't overridden by tons of sodium. I let it simmer, covered on the stovetop to soften the vegetables for 30-45 minutes. I could see doing this in the crock pot as well after browning the meat. We'll be making this again.

Wow. I didn't think these would be good at all, but they are. The carrots add the touch of sweetness that Sloppy Joe's are known for, and then using the Morningstar Farms meat substitute crumbles makes this a vegetarian delight. I'm not even a vegetarian, but I think these are great.

great way to make healthy sloppy joes. Great flavor and didn't feel guilty eating it.

Great way to eat vegetables :D Used ground turkey, added a green bell pepper, loaded it with hot paprika & Penzey's Chili 3000, plus a dash of Sriracha. Couldn't believe the flavor... delightful surprise for me, crowd pleaser for the family. Plus, since I'd diced most of the veges the night before, it was a quick turn after a long day at work.

This was definitely very flavorful. It's of course the time of year to find uses for zucchini and this used a half of one that had turned into a baseball bat :-) Nice dish.

I made this to please kids and adults and it did. I felt it needed a little more flavor so I added: 1/2 C Diced roasted red bell peppers (from a jar), 1-2 TBSP apple cider vinegar, 1-2 TBSP Blackstrap Molasses, a dash of tobasco, and used smoked salt rather than Kosher. YUMMY!

Great Recipe, totally worth making! Chopped the veggies into small cubes by hand - it does add a wonderful crunch. My 3-yr loved it as well. And 1-yr old ate it all-right mixed in with some mac-n-cheese.

This makes a great one dish meal.

I modified this recipe a bit by adding the following: about 1/4 C ketchup and 2 Tbsp.brown sugar plus extra chili powder and paprika for more spice/heat. I also add a dash of liquid smoke and a dash of Worchestershire sauce. I shredded all the vegetables in my food processor and it made this an easy meal that can be frozen.

Made tiny cubes out of the veggies instead...I hate grating. Cooked down perfectly, added a nice, light crunch. My old man said it was the best sloppy joes he'd had in years. The recipe is solid, so you can definitely add spices, etc. to taste. Probably could throw in some peppers too.

Great sloppy joes with the added benefit of being healthy. The first time I made it I made it with beef and it turned out better than with the turkey. But, either way it is great. I used zucchini instead of summer squash and minced all the veggies pretty small so they cooked down. Plus I added a T of brown sugar and a little ground red pepper/cayenne for a little extra flavor and spice. My son, husband and I loved it.

Quite tasty. I was worried about the textures being odd but it wasn't an issue at all. I used ground turkey and shredded the vegetables. It all came together very nicely.

I too had a bunch of summer squash on hand and wanted to not only use it but get my 6 1/2 year old to eat some vegetables. This recipe is FANTASTIC! I used ground turkey instead of beef. My 6 1/2 yr old ate the whole thing and asked for me. He had no clue there was anything healthy in this sloppy joe. Now I know what to do with all the summer squash we get!

I made this recipe because I had a bunch of summer squash on hand and wanted to try something different... it was outstanding! It took no time to prepare and was delightful to eat. We used soy fake-meat instead of turkey or beef, but I'm sure it would've been equally delicious with real meat. Give it a try!
