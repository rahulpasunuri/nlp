This is quite nice, and way better than the standard Pisco sour. Many people may not like the egg white here, pasteurized or not. I found it added a nice fizziness, but go sparingly. I found it was better after chilling in the fridge for a while and settling down, so that the egg white is a fizzy layer on top rather than mixed throughout the drink. Definitely use fresh pineapple juice.
