Exceptional, as everyone said - many raves at Thanksgiving (requests were to try something new!). I only had loads of tatsoi, which I left unchopped even though it was large, and it was an elegant lovely dish. I will definitely come back to this with pea shoots and mizuna, which I love, but didn't have.

I,too,would add a little less soy.But what a sauce!

As everyone noted, the sauce is really fantastic... and goes great on any greens you want to make taste asian-y. It's so good I will try to commit the sauce proportions to memory for quick use on any given asian inspired weeknight.

Made this with mizuna and everyone loved it. Simple and easy.

Wonderful! The sauce is perfect; I made bottles of it and gave them to my mother and sister as gifts! Delicious with mizuna and tatsoi (I added pac choy for texture), but would be great over spinach or drizzled over blanched asparagus. Mmm!

The sauce/dressing is quite tasty. I used it on Asian mustard greens. I may up the ginger a bit and reduce the soy. It's a matter of one's preference. The greens wilted and the flavors were nicely married. I will be using this warm dressing again and adding some sesame seeds for crunch.

This is a terrific sauce - my sister and I use it on the bok choy she grows in her garden, but I use it on any combination of cooked greens.
