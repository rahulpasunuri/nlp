I made this for Easter dessert and my family LOVED it! It looked beautiful, like a giant snowball. I rated this 4 forks, but 3 1/2 would be more appropriate. I used Betty Crocker Supermoist Golden Butter cake mix and followed a few of the suggestions from previous reviews. The mix called for 1 cup of water so I used 1/2 cup of Trader Joes Coconut Cream (you must dump it into a bowl and stir thoroughly before measuring)and 1/2 cup of water. My family does not like rum flavoring, so I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract (will not add this next time-it's overkill) and 1 tsp of coconut extract. I followed the baking directions listed in this recipe, but next time I will follow the baking directions on the box. At 375 degrees, the cake cooked lightening fast and I kept a sharp eye on it as I did not want it to over bake and get dry. The texture of the cake itself was outstanding! It was moist and buttery, but not as heavy as a pound cake. I am adding coconut cream to the next cake I bake to see if that is the secret to the texture. For the frosting, I choose to do a standard cream cheese frosting and added coconut cream (2 8oz packages cr. cheese, 1/2 cup unsalted butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp. coconut extract, 2-3 TBSP of coconut cream). I whipped the heck of it with the Kitchenaide and it was light and fluffy and delicious! I will make this recipe again!

I have 2 brothers who are chefs & graduated from the Culinary Institute of Amerca in New York--guess what?! Both use box cakes because why? It's the same dry ingredients you would use from home more or less & they turn out light & tasty. Like Rosé said you just need to make homemade filling/frosting. I agree w Rose saying, "get over yourselves"-- what a bunch of snobs

similar to the "coconut sour cream cake" on this site in that it uses a box of white cake. i preferred the other recipe, this one came out a little dry and crumbly. i used milk instead of water. i made a sheet cake instead of a round layer cake and didn't make the frosting, maybe it was cooked too long? it was good, just thought the other recipe is better, maybe sour cream adds needed moisture

To all the people who are making disparaging comments about box cake recipes. I have news for you: even Alton Brown has stated that it is hard to make a scratch cake that matches the lightness and moist qualities of a box cake. His advice? If you must, make the cake from a box, but do the frosting from scratch. I do most of my cooking from scratch, but I am not averse to a box cake recipe. Get over yourselves.

I know that I am going to get a lot of flack for saying this, but......how does this type of recipe even end up on Epicurious? I look to this website for good, recipes from scratch. I have been very disappointed lately to find a few box cake recipes when I have done searches. I have not made any of them, because, to be honest I would never make a recipe that involves using a box cake. Sorry. Just very disappointed.

Tip: (IMPORTANT!) If you buy a can of Coconut Cream and open the top and just use what you find, it will have the consistency and taste of lard. You must MIX the coconut cream! At the bottom you will find watery fluid; when mixed, the entire thing has the consistency of thick buttermilk. That's what you should use in the recipe.

Past negative reviews are perplexing... I've made this recipe twice now, and everyone's loved it as much as I have. The extra butter in the cake makes the outside slightly crisp, while the rum gives it a nice scent. The recipe makes a lot of frosting, but fistfights will break out just to lick the beaters! The only alteration I made was to bake the cake in one large tube-type pan. All I did was add 10 minutes or so onto the baking time. This cake is moist with a slightly crunchy crust, and the frosting is just coconutty enough. Best of all, this homemade cake is easy to make, without too many ingredients or too much to measure!

Rating: 0
Not a big thrill. I'm giving it a three instead of a two only because it was easy and the results were acceptable. The one change we made was to substitute a bit of vanilla extract for the rum. It turned out okay, and made a nice canvas for a bunny-shaped Easter cake, but the taste/texture was nothing special. I really didn't notice much coconut flavor at all, and wish I'd had some coconut extract to add; that would probably help a lot.

Man, this recipe did not work out at all! Mixing all cake ingredients at once seemed to be the biggest problem; cake turned out tough and flat. Even the "ease" of the cake mix couldn't save this one.

Terrible recipe. Cake was tough, dense, and fallen in the middle. The cake had no coconut flavor. The frosting tasted like sweetened cream cheese. The name is missleading this, is no "old fashioned coconut cake." If you want to enjoy a excellent coconut cake try the "Double-Coconut Cake" by Cooking Light.

After reading many reviews I made this cake with the following changes: I doubled the recipe to make a bigger/taller cake, I substituted the rum for coconut extract and increased the water from 1/3 to 2/3 Cup, I used coco real for the cream of coconut and I sifted the (yellow butter golden  good choice) cake mix. For the frosting I did NOT double the recipe one batch was enough to frost and fill the whole thing: I only used one bar cream cheese and I used 2 cups stiffly whip cream folded in after beating the other ingredients, I used 1 cup powder sugar and I added I teaspoon coconut extract. Finally I toasted about a cup of coconut and sprinkled it on top and at the base of the cake which worked really well for taste and appearance. I had slight dropping in the middle, but it wasnt a problem. As far as the finished cake goes my Dad was delighted! (He requested a coconut cake for his birthday) He said it was what he was exactly what he craving but couldnt articulate. My husband who doesnt really like coconut and was disappointed with my dads pick  had seconds. The cake had a nice coconut taste, good texture and the frosting worked well. Hope this help-

OMG. I haven't tried the cake yet, but the frosting is TO DIE FOR! I did one pack cream cheese and one carton of whipping cream (whipped.) I think I would do half the carton of whipped cream and perhaps half a stick more of cream cheese.

I made this 'just' as instructed. The butter yellow cake mix seemed to be the right choice. It was a very good and very easy recipe. We had fresh strawberries alongside our cake and it was excellent.

I couldn't find cream of coconut, and after 2 supermarkets and 2 liquor stores later I gave up and decided to make my own. You can substitute the cream of coconut with regular coconut milk, let the can of coconut milk settle and separate, simply use the liquid that forms the top layer, an average can of coconut milk will give you about 1-1 1/2 cups of this juice. I also added about 1 Tablespoon of the coconut paste from the bottom of the can, and 3 Tablespoons of sugar, it all worked out wonderfully. The cake was divine. The frosting recipe makes more then enough so we warmed the excess in the microwave for 20sec. to thin it out and used it as a dipping sauce for some fresh melon and strawberries, it too made a wonderfully fresh and light dessert.

Very good cake. I altered a few things in the receipe, I added more cream of coconut to the cake batter. Had I read the reivews I would have used the white cake mix and more water, nonetheless, we will be eating lovely tomorrow :)

I would definitely make this cake over again. I read all the reviews and all the changes that were being made to improve this cake. I found that making it as is was JUST perfect. I made it for my father's 70th birthday and he is THE coconut connoisseur! I had doubled the recipe (so it was 4 layers) and he said it was absolutely delicious and that it was hard to compare to the cake that his aunt made for him as a child. Now that was a serious compliment as she was the best cook in the family! I will admit that instead of Coco Lopez I used a product called "Coco Real" which is a squeeze bottle and that means you don't have to throw the remainder away. It can be used over and over again! Look for it at your liquor store.

correction to my review immediately below. I used a boxed YELLOW cake mix as originally called for, not the white cake mix suggested by others, plus the other changes I indicated. White cake ,to my palate, has a tendency to be sticky and meringuey, which may have affected some cooks' results.

Rating: 3
I essentially made the cake as written, added a little extra water and flavoring. I made this as a Bundt cake with just a glaze and toasted coconut. The three-fork rating reflects my version, which was very well received. Buy an 8.5 oz can of cream of coconut; If you can only find it in a larger can, you wont need all of it. Cake Ingredients: One 18.5 oz box moist white cake mix, sifted (sifting improves the cakes texture), 3 large eggs, 1/3 cup cream of coconut (reserve what remains in the can), 1 stick of unsalted butter, softened, 2/3 cup water, 1 tsp coconut extract, 1 Tbsp rum, coconut rum if you have it. For garnish: 1.5 cups flaked coconut, plus the remaining cream of coconut. Instructions: Preheat oven to 350. Grease a Bundt or 10 tube pan. To make the cake, combine all the cake ingredients in a large bowl, beat on medium to high for 5 minutes batter will become thick. Bake approximately 35-40 minutes or until a tester comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes in the pan, invert onto a rack to finish cooling. While cake is cooling, spread coconut onto a microwaveable plate, and toast in a microwave oven for approximately 1 minute. Use caution: because of the high sugar content, coconut can go from lightly toasted to burned within a few seconds, and it will continue to get browner for a few seconds even after the power is off. Remove plate from oven with caution--it will be very hot. Allow to cool, stirring occasionally to let it all become dry. When cake is cool to the touch, drizzle it with approximately 2/3 cup cream of coconut, and garnish with toasted coconut. Cake stores well, covered, at room temperature.

Followed cook from Chicago's modification and this was great! Used a bit of both the sweetened coconut and the coco extract as it still didn't have enough coconut flavor initially but then it was just right.... I made them for 4th of July with blueberries and rasperies on top of the coconut for decoration. So pretty and festive and the coconut-berry flavor was to die for! Definitely make again especially with the berries!

I made this for my husband and his colleagues from out of town and everyone thought it was great. First, I read the reviews before making this cake so I culled some of the best ideas and had a couple of needed changes of my own. 1) I used a supermoist white cake 2) Increased water to 2/3 c. for the mix-- otherwise it was like GLUE on my mixer. 3) Added 1/3 c. of oil to mix (as directed on box) 4) I skipped the coco lopez in the cake mix --added 1 tsp. coconut extract instead 5) I baked the cake at 350 x 25 min. as directed on the box. In fact, I could have taken the cake out a couple of minutes earlier. 6) For the frosting, I added 1 tsp. of coconut extract. 7) I skipped the 2nd bar of cream cheese (8oz.) and used 2 c. of whipped cream, folding it in after all other ingredients. 8) I toasted the coconut flake before putting it on the cake. All of this sounds like a hassel, but I usually resoundingly FAIL at desserts, and this one was yummy.

I made a few changes after reading all the reviews and the cake was sooooo good. I left the coco lopez out of the cake mix and added 1 tsp of coconut extract instead. For the frosting, I replaced one of the pacakges of cream cheese with 2 cups of whipped cream. I mixed all the other ingredients together, then folded it into the whipped cream. It was light and fluffy. I also added a tsp. of coconut extract to the frosting. Delicious! I will definitely make this again.

Very TASTY! After reading all the reviews and comments I made this cake [with modifications] for our anniversary dinner. I do plan to make this cake again and again because it was a hit. My Modifications: 1. I used a super moist white cake mix instead of yellow. 2. Edges came out a bit browner than I liked so NEXT TIME I will reduce baking time for a few minutes. 3. I did not have any rum but used a rum extract/flavoring. Will use Appleton Rum next time. 4. Icing was a bit tricky to manuever but did cover the cake nicely after I just glopped it on! Let set in fridge to firm a bit. 5. Put Coco Lopez in with coconut flakes but NEXT time I will ADD some Appleton Rum into the mix for more rum flavor. 6. At the table [since cake was a bit dry] we decided to sprinkle a bit of rum [dinner guest brought rum] on the slices! Quite Yummy! Although I am not a baker, this cake came out well [brownish edges and all]. I also placed it on top of a glass cake stand and the presentation was well received. This was a fun and tasty cake and my guests were impressed. Happy Baking!

My Mom loves Coconut Cake so I thought this would be a good surprise for her. The cake is good but not what I had in mind. I think it was too dry and didn't taste like coconut. I think adding more coco lopez to the mix might help and coconut extract in the frosting.

I tried this as an easy alternative to the Cook's Illustrated coconut cake, so maybe my expectations were too high. An easy recipe, but the cake has a strange texture--kind of tough and chewy. I topped with toasted coconut instead, just a personal preference. The cake and frosting don't have much coconut flavor.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday dinner which was held at a very nice restaurant. Everyone loved the cake, in fact, after the cake was served, two of the chefs stopped by the table to tell me how much they enjoyed my cake (they apparently tasted it in the kitchen after it was served). I NEVER cook with mixes...tonight was definately a fluke. Considering the response, I'll certainly make this again. Here are my preparation notes: 1. I made the cakes in 2 8"x3" pans lined with buttered & floured parchment--taller layers with no sticking and no sunken centers. I also sifted the mix. 2. I used a white "super moist" cake mix instead of a yellow. 3. Taking another reviewer's suggestion, I substituted 16oz. stiffly whipped heavy cream for 8 oz of the cream cheese and folded it in after beating the cream cheese/butter/coco lopez mixture. This yielded a very stable and light frosting. I also added 1/2 tsp. coconut extract to the icing mixture. 4. I garnished with chocolate-dipped strawberries--very pretty.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I think the icing needs a bit more icing sugar than the recipe calls for...I just kept adding in until it looked and tasted right.

I took the advice of other reviewers, made the cake mix as directed on the package (substituting butter for the oil for yummy buttery flavor), then drizzled my cake layers with the cream of coconut as they cooled. It worked out really well and looks beautiful...the only thing is that I think I used too much coconut on the top and sides...it takes away a little from the cream cheese icing and the lovely flavor of the cake. Next time I'll use less coconut...but I think the cake's a keeper. Sadly, I think using the cake mix is the best approach for me...my from scratch cakes never seem to be as moist or as tasty as the results I get from the mixes.

A simpler version of this recipe is just baking a white cake (either in a pan or two rounds and following the directions on the box). Then after the cake has cooled poke it with a fork several times and then pour 1/2-3/4 can of Coco Lopez syrup on it. Refridgerate for a couple of hours. Then top with fresh whipped cream and sweetened shredded coconut. This is an awesome cake and a bit easier then the recipe above.

I used a white cake mix and it was great. Next time I will make it two days ahead and take out of the refrig several hour before serving. After baking I brushed each of the layers with the coconut cream,since you don't use the whole can.Still have some left, so I guess I will have to make myself a Pina Colata MMMMMMMMMMM

This is the best coconut cake I have ever eaten! I found if you sift the cake mix, that it will not sink in the center when you take it out of oven. I also skimp by 1 Tbsp the butter in the cake mix and the icing - it's certainly not low-cal, but worth every bite!

i tried this for a birthday party so i doubled the recipe and it was all eaten, and this was so simple to make, but gave the impression of being very time consuming. I also brushed the layers with rum just before frosting for added flavoring.

This cake was incredible and very easy to make. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and everyone raved and asked for the recipe. I used the whisk attachment on my Kitchen Aid to really make the frosting light in texture. As a previous reviewer suggested, I also brushed some Coco Lopez on the cake layers when they were warm for some extra coconut flavor. Careful to really grease and flour the pans well. One of my layers stuck a bit.

I've made this cake several times and loved it. Unlike other reviewers, I don't mind using a mix b/c I live at high altitude and scratch recipes seldom work without making several changes and blending just right (the cakes will fall). I incorporate the high altitude instructions on the cake mix with this recipe and it turns out beautifully. At least there are other ingredients added so that it doesn't taste like a boxed cake. Everyone I served it to thought it was made from scratch. I really wish Bon Appetit would include high altitude instructions in their recipes b/c there are so many recipes I feel like I'm missing out on and I love to bake!

I use this recipe for my catering business and people love it! I did make a couple of additions. I used the leftover cream of coconut as a soaking syrup for the cake layers while they cooled. Also, instead of 2 pkgs of cream cheese, I used one and added 2 cups of whipped cream, whipped to stiff. It made the frosting light and fluffy with a hint of the cream cheese frosting taste. Delicious!!

I have had rave reviews on this cake. I own a coffee shop and make many desserts from Bon Appetit, but surprisingly, this recipe gets the most requests from my customers. The only thing I do differently is sift the cake mix it seems to make the cake lighter. I also found a sweeter, high quality rum makes a huge difference, Appleton Estates Rum is the best one I have tired.

Has the definition of what it means to be "gourmet" changed? It's a crying shame that recipes involving boxed cake mixes & other products/ingredients laden w/ artificial preservatives & colourings are even being considered for publication on this "gourmet" website. Are laziness, lack of pride & absence of selectivity so rampant that they've now invaded the gourmet world? YUCK!

I have made this cake about six times each time it sinks a little in the middle, but I think that's because it is so moist.I use duncan hines butter recipe mix and the cake taste awesome.I changed the icing because I didn't like the tartness of the cream cheese and use a vanilla icing with cocnut added to it. Duncan Hines cocnut icing is pretty good if you are in a pinch.

I read the reviews before making the cake & I don't see why people had a problem. The cake was flat with a little sunken place, but it beat having to slice off a dome in order to make the layers even. It didn't stick at all and it iced beautifully! I added a tsp. of coconut extract to the batter and a quarter tsp. to the icing. The icing was gloppy, so I added a little more than a quarter cup of powdered sugar to the icing. I also added 3 cups of coconut to the icing. Then I toasted a quarter cup of coconut and sprinkled it on top of the finished cake. The cake has been such a hit that former coconut haters are begging me for the recipe.

Rating: 2
I forgot about my cake and cooked it an extra 5-10 minutes. The texture and flavor were really nice, but it was a little more sunken in the middle. I think cake pans with higher sides would have helped. The frosting was tasty, but somewhat runny although it firmed up in the fridge. Toasted coconut on the top and sides of the cake helped to hide the uneveness of the cake and added a great flavor. Altogether, an unattractive but delicious cake.

Boo! Hiss! Horrible. Well like the other reviewers when they came out of the oven they both fell flat in the middle. Also like the other reviewers mine had a really unappealing dark brown exterior. Then upon trying to realease them from the pans (non-stick, greased and floured) I found they had stuck to the bottom where they fell even thought toothpick came out clean! I'm going to have to start all over again, this time from scratch. I've learned my lesson the hard way. Skip this cake and go to Coconut Layer cake B.A. 12/99.

Tried this recipe twice before reading reviews as found it in a Bon Appetit cookbook. My cake turned out horrible BOTH TIMES. It sunk in the middle. Have never had this happen before. Taste was just okay, but it was much too ugly to take to my friend's dinner party! Used Betty Crocker cake mix first try & then Pillsbury. First time had failed to mix up Coco Lopez so thought that was the problem. Second time cake sunk in middle even more! Never tried the frosting & ended up using an old recipe for Italian Cream Cake.

This cake was sinfully delicious - what else to expect from two sticks of butter and 16 oz of cream cheese? I added imitation coconut extract to the batter because the cake itself does not have an overpowering coconut taste. Even with that addition, it still did not. However, between the frosting and the flaked coconut on top, it certainly is a coconut cake. I also decorated the top with some fresh strawberries to give it some contrast.

My first try was a winner - I made this for a coconut lover's birthday. This cake was so incredible that I actually ate 2 slices and I dont care for coconut cake that much. I used everyone's ideas as far as adding coconut extract to the cake mix in addition to the coco lopez. I chilled my frosting and it firmed up on its own so no runny mess. I used 2 boxes of cake mix because I was using 2 - 10 inch round pans. The cake kinda fell in the middle but not enough for deep concern. I filled the cake with a homemade pinapple filling. I wanted decorative piping since I made a double recipe of the frosting,so I beat in 1 cup of powdered sugar after the cake was frosted for a border on the top and bottom of the cake. I also used someone's suggestion for toasted coconut which I placed around the sides. The cake was beautiful and tasted better than I had ever expected.

I was so disappointed in this cake. The layers were very dark on the outside and made for an unattractive cut cake, and the frosting was thick and gummy and tasted just like sweetened cream cheese.

I made this cake for Mother's Day as my Mom loves coconut. The first time I made it was with a Pilsbury cake mix (not my preference, but the store was out of Duncan Hines, me favorite). When I pulled the cake from the oven, both cakes fell flat....the first time this ever happened. I went to another store and used Duncan Hines. Again, the cake fell in the middle, but not as much. I'm wondering if the cake mix was wrong. Both mixes didn't specifically say butter recipe cakes, but I couldn't find any that did. Any suggestions? Otherwise, the cake was find.

I made this for Easter and found the recipe to be trouble-free. No flat cake, sunken middle, or runny icing as others have experienced. The cake was very pretty and I was pleased with the results.

Nonetheless, I will certainly make the recipe again, as the cake did not take long to make, and for the time investment is an excellent "value."

as a pastry chef for a restaurant, I would say that this cake saves me a lot of work. It was excellent! The cake was moist and wonderful. I did substitute the French Vanilla flavor and used coconut rum instead of regular rum. As for the frosting, I left out the butter and used a really thick coconut cream and the texture came out fine. Top the cake with golden flakes of coconut. If you use the recipe for baking times etc, that is on the box, there shouldn't be any problems about timing. Its a real winner!

Well, I made this cake and wasn't impressed at all. I'm surprised at all the positive reviews. My cake was dry, and it sank in the middle. I even made it again to see if I would have better results.

My girlfriends and I made this cake to have with coffee one afternoon and it was very good.

Due to the "overly sweet" comments, I used coconut milk rather than Coco Lopez and used unsweetened coconut, toasted. I loved it! It was not too sweet but was full of flavor and nice contrasts. I did find that using 1 full cup, rather than 3/4 cup powdered sugar created the perfect frosting consistency. In fact, the frosting was wonderful...super creamy and fluffy....I beat all the ingredients but the powdered sugar over a pan of warm water until it was very creamy, then took it out of the water and beat in the sugar--continuing to beat it until it was completely cool and very fluffy.

I added coconut extract to the cake and toasted the coconut. Toasting the coconut makes the cake! It turned out beautiful and tasted great. It was easy and I would make it again. If you are looking for a "real" coconut cake, this isn't it. The name is deceiving. The cake tastes like butter rum with a hint of coconut, and the frosting is cream cheese.

I usually bake from scratch, so I'm not accustomed to box cakes. Therefore, I made the big mistake of not using the "butter" version box cake. It turned out horribly dry. I made it again using the butter-type recipe, and it was delicious. Loved the icing, beautiful presentation with all the coconut.

Thank you for including a boxed cake mix....many of us don't have the time to bake from scratch. Cake was excellent with the changes I made. I added coconut extract to the cake batter and DID NOT add the powdered sugar to the frosting. The frosting did not need the extra sugar. Also, I toasted the coconut. The cake was a big hit and I will make it again.

I thought this was an excellent, easy to make coconut cake. After reading the reviews, I added 1 teaspoon of coconut extract to both the batter and the frosting to add a bit more coconut flavor. I also toasted the coconut for the frosting, which adds a nice flavor and look to the cake.

This is a good easy recipe. I added coconut extract to both the frosting and the cake, and toasted the coconut, which makes the cake look and taste super awesome. I might try using the same frosting with a different cake made from scratch, just because the cake has a little of that wierd from-a-box flavor. I think it would also be cool to make a pineapple cake and use this frosting.

Not the showstopper I hoped for. Cake fell, frosting was rich but not sweet. So-so... guess I'll keep looking for a winner.

As a cake decorator, I was looking for a good tasting (and looking) coconut cake, and didn't think this was it. Although the cake smelled wonderful while baking, I don't feel it had enough coconut flavor (I might add some coconut extract if I make again). Although the icing did taste wonderful, I thought it was too thin to make a really nice presentation. I would only consider making this cake again if someone in my family requested it, but definitely not something I would sell to anyone as is.

I've come on line to find the recipe so I can make it for the second time. First time was awesome. Made for guests as a birthday cake, when all frosted and covered with coconut I put some of the colorful cookie/cupcake sprinkles all over it. A great spring/summer dessert. It came out beautiful as well as YUMMY!!

Real food for real people, a working mom with 3 kids just doesn't have time to cook gourmet meals and bake from scratch 7 days a week.Also a mix is one dirty bowl and beaters, easy cleanup. Lets hear it for Moms with dinner cookng, a load of laundry in the washer, homework needing checked,& kids needing a ride who need something quick and easy.

I made this cake over the weekend. My husband and 3 kids ate it up but I though it was just so-so. Like others, I thought the cream of coconut didn't add enough coconut flavor. Also, agree that for so many fat calories it should have tasted better. I thought the frostine was good though and may keep that recipe for future use.

My cake turned out beautiful, it rose nicely, (had to make altitude adjustments), the icing is good, but as cake mix recipes go, (and I use cake mixes frequently), this recipe was just so-so. I expected the coconut cream to give it more of a coconut flavor, which it didn't. The amount of fat calories consumed isn't worth eating. In other words, if I consume that many fat calories, it needs to be scrumptious!

Just to clarify here in light of recent comments, it is possible to type a comment you think is important and leave the rating section/"would make dish again".... blank. I agree, please don't RATE a recipe if you have not tried it or have changed it beyond all recognition. Comments, however are always welcome even without a rating, we all learn from them.

Rating: 1
Um, Roxanne-- please do not give a three fork rating to a recipe you have not yet tried. It's misleading. I myself was unimpressed with this cake. I agree with the cook who said she would've gotten better results just following the directions on the box for simple golden cake. I had that exact thought the moment I tasted this.

Rating: 1
I made this cake for Easter and was disappointed. I have no problem with cake mixes, in fact, I suspect this cake would have been better if I had simply followed the instructions on the box. The cake was too dry and the Pepe Lopez didn't seem to add anything. Don't Shoot!!

I thought this was FABULOUS! So easy and so tasty. It turned out perfect! I'm replacing my old Coconut Cake recipe with this one. It's a keeper.

I haven't made it yet, but I plan to for Moither's Day. My mom adores coconut, so she should love this. I also don't get what is soo bad about making some stuff from a box. My God! I make stuff from boxes and from sratch too. Both also turn out yummy!

I have not made this yet but I definitely will now! I have to see for myself what kind of cake can possibly stir such intense immotion! But I confess, I agree with the cook from St. John's:I prefer cake mixes myself! I also prefer mashed potatoes from a box!

I must say with all the controversy surronding this recipe I was surprised to find it to be a sub-standard cake. Didnt rise, way to much icing-kinda dissapointing. Not a horrible cake-but not great. Im sure there are better coconut recipes on the sight-Ill be seeking them out.

What is it that you all don't undertand?! The main point being made is that "scratch" doesn't take that much more time than "Box." (TEN MINUES TOPS!) Jeese! Bake whatever you want, just stop CRYING that you don't have the luxury of extra time that the "scratch" bakers have. Nobody is judging. A fact is a fact.

Enjoyed this! Easy to do - have also enjoyed the box vs. scratch controversy - times change and so do we - everyone has to prioritize the time they have and its not our right to judge - if you don't want to use the box find another recipe - it's as simply as that.

This is a great, easy recipe. It is definitely a must for cooks-on-the-go. I believe the baking time is inaccurate, however. I found the cakes in the 9" pans were not done after 25, 30, and 35 minutes. I stuck my oven thermometer in the oven to make sure my oven is working properly. I finally lowered the oven temperature to 350 degrees after 35 minutes and continued the baking process for another 10 minutes. This is definitely moist, easy and tasty.

I also made this for an annual Easter brunch, and it got rave reviews...especially the frosting. I was a bit disappointed that my frosting did not appear as white as the pictured cake (I know, I know, food always looks better in the magazine), and a friend told me that if you beat the cream of coconut, it gets whiter--the more you beat, the whiter it gets. I'm going to try that the next time I make the cake. Also, I had to travel for the brunch, so I made the cake on Friday , cooled it, and wrapped it in plastic wrap...I made the frosting and completed it on Saturday night, and it did not suffer any ill-effects that I could see.

Rating: 2
The cake turned out well. The comment about overbeating is true, the cake was too fine for me. I let it sit covered a day in the fridge, and it becomes more moist, it was good to eat even after 2-3 days. I prefer the COCONUT CAKE WITH SOUR CREAM, also on this site. I like this frosting though, and will use that cake with this frosting on top in the future.

Good grief! Do we have to go through the identical song-and-dance about the virtures of mixes versus scratch every time a recipe calling for a boxed mix comes our way? Come on, cooks, rate the recipe, and go to a chat room if you feel in need of a little conversation. That said, I'll follow my own advice. This cake was tasty AND easy. Period.

I haven't made this yet, but I'm certainly going to. I'm a "from scratch" baker, but I have a couple of "cheat" recipes using cake mixes that are wonderful; this sounds like it might be another. Everyone needs to lighten up a bit. Even the purists among us cannot always cook under optimal circumstances. In other words, sometines we take very selective short-cuts and challenge anyone to sniff them out! Cook and HAVE FUN!!!

I personally welcomed an easy to follow, delicious , yet inexpensive dessert to make for my family. I work and have 2 kids and this is different yet easy to prepare. And I have to admit something, I actually prefer boxed cake mixes over scratch!

This cake was great. I made it in a 9x13 inch pan and cut the icing recipe in half. It made for a quick & portable cake. I often make cakes for the ladies at work and I'll be bringing this cake tomorrow. I have several recipes that have a cake mix as a base and they are all great.

To the cook from New York and in defense of all the other reviewers. New Orleans comments were not so much about baking a cake from scratch rather she was insulting. She basically called people that use boxed cakes "white trash" and suggested they live in trailer parks and were lazy. Her comments were uncalled for.

Coconut cake is my all time favorite, and even though I am an excellent cook, baking and I don't seem to get along. Thanks for this recipe. Looks like the discussion could become as much fun as the Fried Egg Sandwiches, which were also good.

I have not tried the recipe, but read the original article in BA. I thought it had a clever theme - special dessert results with quick and ordinary ingredients. The author acknowledged she is a food snob and would only resort to convenience when pressed. I have great memories of Aunt Irene's cocount cake and i am often pressed for time so I WILL try this !

I had to try this recipe when I read the controversy in the reviews, and it is wonderful. Wasn't aware of Bon Appetit to be a society magazine; however, to the pretentious blow hard who felt this recipe deserved a "1": The rating system is not based on the ingredients, but the taste of the recipe-which was excellent. I suppose you churn your own butter as well! There is nothing wrong with using a cake mix as the base of your recipe~especially in a time crunch.

AMAZING!! My brother made this cake for Easter dinner, and I am thrilled that it showed up in my e-mail this morning, as I didn't get the recipe before I left. Anyway, this cake is fabulous!! I too was so surprised that a cake mix was involved. I would never have known. I will definitely make this again, and share this recipe with some other friends who will be equally suprised by the ingredients. Try it, if you are a coconut lover, you'll love it!!

I haven't made this recipe yet but plan to do so next week for a family members birthday. There is nothing wrong with having several good recipes using cake mixes when you want to whip up a cake in a hurry. I have been doing this for years and always get rave reviews.

Gosh, we are all serious cooks here or we wouldn't be on this site. Let's just get a grip! This cake is as advertised - quick and easy. It is also very delicious, and several dinner guests asked me for the recipe after having it last weekend. For those who want to make a coconut cake from scratch - by all means go ahead! I am sure Epicurious can direct you to an excellent recipe. For the rest of us - this is one yummy cake made in a reasonale amount of time with a reasonable amount of available ingredients. I for one am thankful for that! I know I will make this cake over and over again. Only one suggestion: Beat the cake for no more than 3 minutes. No need for extra effort.

I am reminded of the saying- don't judge a book by its cover. I was surprised to see a box mix in the magazine as well after reading it for 10 years, but, unless you've baked and tasted this one, you've no right to comment. It's delish!

Shame on the cook from New Orleans! I live in a trailer park and no way am white trash! There are times when we all can use a quick dessert in a hurry. This was a perfect ending to Easter dinner. Thank you Bon Appetit and keep the less complicated recipes coming!

I'm sad to see Gourmet use a cake mix in one of their recipes. I was all excited to see a recipe for coconut cake to use up my coconut, and much to my chagrin, it was with a cake mix. I haven't used a mix since I'm 15, and I'm 40 now, so do the math. Basic scratch cakes are easy and I'm sure you could have incorporated one using coconut. A little disappointed with your editing.

Evidently the cook from New Orleans has an abundance of time and never needs a wonderful cake in a hurry. Must be nice!

This cake was simple, delicious, and GONE in a hurry! I think beating the mixture for four minutes was a bit much for me as there was a slight meringue-y crust to my layers. I would also cook the layers a minute or two less, as the edges browned a bit more than I wanted. I'd also make extra frosting because I couldn't keep my fingers out of it while assembling the cake!

I was suprised at the instructions to beat the batter for 4 minutes....WHY? This is not angel food cake, and it's from a mix, not scratch! I did it for about 2 minutes and the texture was still a little too fine for my "old fashioned" taste. The cake did taste very good, but not as moist and yummy as I hoped.

Saw the recipe...sounded great...made it. It was fantastic!!! I promptly cut out the recipe and promptly lost it. Since then I've been checking your website praying it would show up.
