The base recipe for the shortbread is truly fablous! This variation, however, is just okay. Not the least bit attractive. What I ended up doing is incorporating minced candied ginger and toasted, unsweetened coconut in my second batch. Yum! I have also reduced the flour and replaced with cocoa with excellent results.

Very tasty but rather homely. I'll make them again but, next time, I'll blitz the toppings in a blender or food processor to distribute the ginger more evenly and achieve a more uniform appearance.

The basic shortbread rescipe is fabulous, but I would use less chocolate and more candied ginger if I were to do this again.
