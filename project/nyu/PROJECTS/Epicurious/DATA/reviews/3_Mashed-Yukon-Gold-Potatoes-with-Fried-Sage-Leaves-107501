As a working cook, I must say that the effort (such as it is) does to the Christmas dinner table what an evergreen wreath does to a home - not 'needed', but pleasantly appreciated.

Could not see going through the effort to fry the sage leaves just to use as a garnish. A different flavor for mashed potatoes. If you like sage you will enjoy these.

Easy to prepare but nothing special. Will not make again.
