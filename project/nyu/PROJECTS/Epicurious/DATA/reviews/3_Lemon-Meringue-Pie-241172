I made this yesterday and it was delicious and turned out perfectly. I used an extra yolk and 1/3 cup of corn starch to ensure a thick custard and it was just right. I also skipped the 2T butter accidentally but it was fine without it. I used the pate sucree pie dough recipe from Joy of Cooking which is my go-to. Never fails!

I used the zest of the three lemons required for the juice and it was more than the 1 tblspn indicated but made the pudding considerably more fragrant. The pudding texture was fantastic and tart, just as i remember my mom's pie on Easter Sunday.

I should have known as soon as the recipe said to bake the crust for 40 minutes! I've never done that and never would, but stupidly followed the recipe, ending in burnt crust and having to resort to refrigerated crust. I also followed everything else and ended up with lemon meringue soup. The custard didn't set up even though it thickened nicely on the stove. I have no idea what I did but I would never make this again.

This is my "go to" recipe when ripe lemons hit the trees in AZ. It is spectacular and simple to make. I cut the sugar to a max of 2/3C or it's too sweet. Be sure to let the filling really thicken while on the stove top and always chill for at least 6 hrs. before the meringue gets added. This is a keeper.

Fantastic, and a keeper! Though next time, I think I may reduce the lemon juice just a little.

I always use my own crust recipe but I thought the filling was great. I did add a few extra yolks and a bit more corn starch based on other reviews. I would make this again for sure.

This is a luxurious pie. I did however pay attention to the complaints of the runny filling and used 1/3 cup of cornstarch and 2 extra egg yolks. It was absolutely fabulous! It has become one of my star desserts.

I've made lemon meringue pie a number of times and never had this problem - we had lemon soup, not lemon pie! The primary difference between this and the other recipe I have used (Joy of Cooking) is the milk - I will go back to the old recipe next time.

I have just made this pie and haven't tasted it yet. It looks good, but as I was making the Meringue, I saw that it called for 3/4 superfine sugar. Did I miss something? I assumed it is 3/4 cup.

oh bummer - my pie did not set up at all! although it was a delicious runny pie, we ate it in bowls and everyone was still happy. I assumed that the lemon filling would thicken as it cooled, but it didn't. So, I'm assuming that the filling just needed to cook for a while longer. If yours doesn't thicken up when cooking - add more cornstarch or something! The pastry dough was delicious too - I usually use my own recipe but am glad I gave this one a try.

I was always afraid of making lemon meringue pie due to my Mother's history. Sometimes perfect, sometimes a runny mess. This recipe came out perfect! Set up very well and had a good flavor. I used my own pie crust recipe. The meringue was almost too much, but was good.

I'm laughing to myself thinking that people were making the pastry dough from the the pie filling ingredients. Anyway, this is a very good recipe and my meringue did not become runny.

I have to say, I don't know how you could make this pie runny - save you didn't let it cool long enough. I've made this pie three times a year a year for three years running (my husband LOVES lemon meringue, and this is his annual "birthday cake" as well as having it on our anniversary and Thanksgiving) This is the best recipe EVER. I keep the "weepy" issue down by 1) making the meringue via the Italian method (adding in hot simple syrup to "cook" the eggs while whipping) and also by the method someone else mentioned with the cornstarch incorporation. Don't be put off by these reviews - this is an EXCELLENT pie.

Interestingly enough, you will find almost the exact same recipe here on epicurious from Gourmet 1995. It has a rating of 3-1/2 forks and 90% said they would make it again. Very interesting.

This recipe is getting a bum rap. While true, it is not a recipe for the Food Network crowd (nothing comes pre-made in a box), it is an excellent recipe for an old fashioned southern meringue pie. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the pastry dough is a link to a recipe on a different page. For anyone willing to take the time and with a little experience this pie is well worth the effort.

Try this recipe on this site. It is a perfect Lemon Meringue Pie. lemon meringue pie with pecan crust

Having made many of these pies, I could see from the ingredients list that the filling would be a runny mess. I also think a graham cracker crust is not only way more delicious, but quite a bit easier to make.

This was indeed a let down. I think maybe if I added more cornstarch the filling might have set. I'm not sure why it didn't set. Oh well, it's worth another shot for sure. Worst pie I have ever made....although my family begs to differ that the flavor was intense. But who likes a runny pie?

This recipe is the worse lemon pie recipe ever. The pie dough is horrible, the lemon mix is to liquid. If someone has ever served this or ate this I pray for you. Don't waste your time with this.

The best way to avoid a 'weeping' meringue is to incorporate into the beaten egg whites, a cornstarch paste. Mix 1 tb cornstarch & 1 tb sugar with 1/3 cup of water. Bring to a boil, it will become a thick clear paste. Once your egg whites are stiff, put your beater at low speed and incorporate the paste. For those who have the Joy of Cooking Book 1997 edition ,its on page 1012.

I won't make it until I can get tips on reducing meringue 'weeping', but when I click on the link to find out, I get the homepage for Gourmet.com. So, anyone know how to do it? I don't find the recipe ambiguous, but a space between the link for pastry dough and the rest of the ingredients might have eliminated confusion.

Rating should be a 0: Lemon Meringue is not a milk-based pie. I am not able to have milk, and I thought that this was one of the "safe" pies for me to eat. I guess I will just have to make it with my own non-milk recipe.

strangest recipe for pastry dough I've ever seen!!

Rating: 4
This recipe is virtually identical (when making the adjustment suggested to reduce "weeping") to one that we have developed over a number of years and that we regard as superior. We hate to see the low ratings and negative comments based on the lack of understanding of the recipe format (i.e., that the line Pastry Dough, [underlined and in green] is the link for the separtate recipe for the pasttry dough and the balace of the ingredients are for the filling.

The pastry is a seperate recipe. Click on "Pastry Dough" (1st item on the list of ingredients) and you will be taken to the recipe. It DOES use flour!

Very strange receipe that does not break out filling from pastry

Haven't tried this recipe yet because it seems like there's something missing....flour?

i did not care for this recipe. have had many, many better tasting lemon meringue pies. my filling was a bit runny and overly sweet which overwhelmed the lemon flavor. did not care for the meringue either, but that was possibly my fault - i may have overbeat a tad. i will not make this recipe again.
