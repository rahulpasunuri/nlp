Follow the directions very carefully on this one, and be sure the chocolate is really just lukewarm, or else you'll have an expensive mess on your hands. I used store-bought ice cream instead of making the ones here, and was unable to get them into balls, ending up instead with mounds. Not as pretty, but still looks nice once covered with chocolate. Remove the toothpicks just before you dip them into the white chocolate, as it will mess up the chocolate less than if you do it as suggested. I served these with homemade brownies and they were quite impressive looking.
