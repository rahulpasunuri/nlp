Is there an ingredient missing from this recipe? I am an experienced cook and have never had a cake turn out like this. Not only did it fall, but it tastes like squished chocolate egg bread. The icing tastes good. Now I'm off to make a new cake to put it on.

OK PEOPLE- I just want to advise anyone looking here: If I can make this chocolate bliss cake & have it come out as fantastic as it did, anyone can!! Played by the rules & it came out perfect- the only tweak was a generous spoonful of coffee crystals into the first step of the frosting recipe b/c my daughter (for whom this 16th birthday cake was being made) requested coffee icing. DELICIOUS & WORTH THE BIT OF FUSS!!

My all time favorite American-style chocolate cake. Easy to make. The best frosting. Make the cake the day before and let it sit overnight for the best texture and taste.

I had not baked a cake in over 20 years and I have to say it was FABULOUS! I followed the directions exactly as written and would NOT change a thing. I baked it for a special Christmas dinner with friends and will most definitely bake it again!

Nice texture, but it's too sweet. If I made this cake again, I would definitely make some adjustments; perhaps I would substitute unsweetened chocolate for the semisweet chocolate. This definitely not the best chocolate cake recipe that I've made from this site.

This is the best chocolate cake I make and is now the only cake I make.

I have been making this recipe for years and it's consistently a huge hit. The secret here is to make it a day ahead. It's really substantially better when it's been made at least 24 hours in advance of serving. Furthermore, I find it best to simply store it at room temp under a cake dome or plastic wrap rather than refrigerate it as refrigeration tends to ruin the frosting, in my opinion.

I have made this recipe so many times. It is such the right balance of chocolate and sweetness. Not too sweet and not so chocolaty that you smack your tongue. The cake melts in your mouth! Everyone we have ever served it to (and there have been many) have asked for the recipe.

DO NOT make this cake! It was a flavorless, mishappen mess. I had to cut the cake into a square to ice it and make it look nice.

this is my second try at devils food and i don't know what the heck i am doing wrong. It has overflown the pan both times and i used a larger pan this time. After overflowing it falls into almost nothing. It tastes good but I am doing somehthing wrong any advice on what i am missing?

I will give this cake a second try. My wife and son loved it. I added 1/3 cup moist shreaded coconut to the cake. 1/2 of the center I covered in my rasberry perserves and the other in the chocolate frosting. The frosting is like rich fudge. Whipped cream is a must.

I liked this. I would prefer it sweeter, so next time I will use milk chocolate for the cake and semi sweet for the frosting.

I have make this cake at least once a year, w/ rave reviews from everyone. I made it the other day w/ my 8 yr.old daughter who had been begging to bake w/ me. It turned out the BEST I think it has ever come out! I used silicone baking dishes (just under 9"). The cakes were moist and dense almost fudge like, no "sinking" or crumbling like I've had in the past. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary except sift the flour about 3 times. For the frosting I did ADD 2 tsp. triple sec and some (a whole orange) of orange zest...OMG it is DELICIOUS! Like I said this was the best time it has turned out for me, and it looks pretty when you add sliced strawberries or put orchids on it for parties

It has been a while since I had made this cake- I made it this weekend for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I made a few revisions...added 1 cup water 1/2 cup coffee liquer and used super fine sugar in the cake mix. I also sifted the flour 3 times to add extra air. For the frosting I again used super fine sugar and used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract. I contimplated putting in orange zest and decided that I would next time. I will also next time try using the silicone cake pan, mine are the dark aluminum and the edges got a little well done. The cake came out moist and the frosting a perfect fudge like consistancy. It was beautiful and I garnished it with orchids. Two thumbs up!

Love the texture of this cake-- defintely a big hit! Chewy and toothy, great flavor too! A family of chocolate lovers all raved! I didn't use the frosting recipe, so can't comment on that part.

We have served this cake at least ten times during the past year. We think it is the quintisential, old fashioned chocolate cake. We don't make any adjustments, just follow the directions. Perfect!

The key to this cake is to eat it the next day. Make sure you keep it covered so it stays moist. The only thing I did not put in was the vinager. I did not have it on hand. Also, I made cupcakes instead of a cake. My boyfriend ate 3 of them within 40 mins. Needless to say they were a hit!!!

i thought this frosting was amazing! best frosting i have ever made! however, the cake itself did not turn out so well. it was very, very dry, but we followed the recipe exactly, it was so easy there, wasn't much room for mistakes. so, i would reccomend this frosing any day, but i would not reccomed the cake.

RAVE reviews from guests. When I used 9 inch pans, the layers sank in the middle so use 8 inch pans if you got'em. I've made this cake twice. BOTH times, the frosting has turned out runny. I returned the frosting to the pan; cooked it over medium heat without stirring until it was close to soft-ball stage; cooled to about 110 degrees by placing the bottom of the pan in cold water; stirred it with a wooden spoon for 5-10 minutes THEN put it in the refrigerator to chill. This remedied the problem but it was labor intensive and added to the preparation time. Does anybody else have a solution for runny frosting?!?

I made this cake for an award dinner -- and just put it in the garbage. I had all the ingredients, followed the recipe and it flopped. It was very dry, flat, not rich and dark like I was expecting. I now have to go to the store and buy a cake. I would appreciate any comments on where I may have gone wrong. I made the Chocolate Raspberry cake for my son's birthday the other day . . and as a day old cake it was absolutely fabulous . . unfortunately I didn't have the right ingredients or I would have made that one.

I made a couple of revisions to avoid a trip to the store: Ghirardelli unsweetened baking chocolate, salted butter- changed salt to 1/8 tsp. and added 1/2 cup sour cream to the butter, chocolate mix thereby eliminating the last step completely.It simplified the whole thing. The result was a wonderful dense crumb. I am still looking for the perfect quality chocolate. I used Lindt 70% sem-sweet choc for the frosting, cut sugar by 1/2 cup, in error threw some almond extract in- frosting got rave reviews. I used sweet butter for the frosting. Great cake!

I loved the texture of the cake - it got lots of complements from my family members, all of whom are baking folk. The frosting was also extremely nice and rich, though to be honest I think that the two don't go soundly well together. I think perhaps a light chocolate buttercream would be more appropriate. However, I will most certainly make both cake and icing again. (you also can't beat this recipe for ease)

I made this cake for a friend's birthday and everyone really loved it. I guess I didn't take seriously the reviewers who said that it was very rich, moist and fudgelike, because I was suprised at the denseness of the cake. I'm a college student with minimal access to ingredient, so I used plain old Toll House chips for the cake, but I did find Ghiradelli's for the frosting. The cakes tasted wonderful, but I worried because they developed a crust and collapsed a bit. I'm not certain what I did wrong. The frosting was very dense, and fudge-like/ganache-like. It was a little too intense for the cake. Overall, I found this recipe very easy to make and it got sound approval all around.

This cake was a huge hit at a baby shower brunch. Not a crumb left! this will definitely become my chocolate cake of choice. I actually made this as a bundt cake and left off the frosting. The cake is so moist and chocolate-y with out it. I added an ounce extra of semi-sweet chocolate and 2 tablespoons of brewed strong coffee. It needed a little extra time in the oven as a bundt. We just dusted it with a little cocoa and confectioners sugar. Wow!

Like some other reviewers, I think whether or not you like this recipe is a matter of taste. The cake turned out super moist. It was really dense. While I liked the texture, I felt the flavor fell a bit short for me--it just wasn't chocolatey enough. The frosting was fudge-like (it is closer to a ganache than a buttercream). It takes a while to firm up, and my husband was getting anxious for me to finish the recipe, so I rushed the process. I ended up with a runny frosting. We just drizzled our slices with the frosting, like a syrup. I put the extra frosting back in the fridge, and it firmed up just fine. So, be sure to let it cool sufficiently. I don't plan to make this again, because it wasn't to my liking, but it makes a nice cake for people who like a dense cake with a fudge-like frosting.

I made this cake for my father's birthday...everyone (kids and adults) loved it and I thought it was really easy to make. I followed the directions/ingredients exactly and will do the same next time. I served fresh raspberries with it as well - they complemented the very chocolately flavors nicely.

CAVEAT! I only used the frosting portion of this recipe. I was looking for a cream/chocolate based frosting that spread and tasted like a miracle. This wasn't it. I let the frosting cool for 7 hours. It wasn't spreadable; more toward runny lavacake type frosting. I tried again 24 hours later, same thing, not quite as runny. I continue my search for the ultimate creamy chocolate frosting...

I would never make a chocolate cake from a mix now that I've found this easy and reasonably quick to make cake. I substituted buttermilk for the sour milk and found this cake to be moist and full of chocolate flavor. I used a good quality chocolate which I think makes a difference in this case. I used a different frosting recipe so I won't comment on that. This recipe will go into my recipe box.

I enjoy making cakes and was most disappointed in the cake. I'm not sure if it was the water content or what, but the cake was a rubbery texture and without a great chocolate flavor. As for the icing, I was expecting a fudge type icing that is popular in the South, but it was not a fudge texture. The icing was good, but more like a ganache. The icing and cake were really not compatible.

I really loved this cake! My husband, who does not normally like any cakes, ate an entire mini loaf of this recipe I baked. The rest of the batter I used for cupcakes.

Although I was tentative about making this recipe (melt chocolate with butter and WATER?? and boiling the cream and sugar??) I tried it and it was great! Toothsome is right...this cake is moist and has a great chocolate taste. I made it for a discerning group of friends and they all loved it and requested the recipe! I had the leftovers for breakfast this morning!

I do not understand why there are so many possitive reviews. I bake often and I found this cake awful, poor of chocolate. Or must I have used a very strong chocolate?

This cake was very moist and chocolatey. Excellent frosting in terms of flavour and consistency (I didn't find it grainy at all). A very attractive homemade cake. And so easy and quick to put together. Will definitely become my be-all and end-all chocolate cake recipe. BTW, I used buttermilk instead of soured milk, and I cut down the amount of sugar in the cake to 1 1/2c, and in the frosting to 1 1/4c, and the results were excellent. I don't think sour cream would be a great idea, I think it is the liquid that makes this cake so moist.

Rating: 0
Question: Could sour cream be used as a sub for the milk/vinegar? Also, I never heard of adding water to chocolate before melting. It won't seize up? Please, somebody reassure me before I tackle this one! (pls note suekoma@aol no longer my e-mail address) Thanks.

I thought the cake was a bit messy to make but well worth the effort. Very moist, great flavor, with excellent frosting. Looked good, too. Almost as good on day 4... A huge success with on my beloved's birthday. Might consider adding some chopped nuts to the icing exterior for added fun.
