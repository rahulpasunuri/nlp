I made two of these for Easter Sunday. One with mushrooms, bacon and shallots and one with just bacon and shallots. They were huge hits. Even my 9 year old niece wanted more. Everyone raved about them.

Just made this quiche recipe with a few adjustments for a girls brunch. Everyone loved it! My creation was an ASPARAGUS and CHIVE QUICHE with SAUTÉED ONIONS and SHARP WHITE CHEDDAR CHEESE. I used heavy cream in this recipe instead of creme fraiche and it set up brilliantly. I used my own pate brisee (pie crust recipe) and the egg to cream ratio as listed on this recipe but then added: 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp mustard powder, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1-tbsp butter, 1/2 small onion finely diced, 2 cloves garlic crushed, 1/2-3/4 cup asparagus, 1/3 cup finely minced chives, 1/2-3/4 cup sharp white cheddar cheese grated. I did pre-cook the asparagus and cut it in 1-inch slices, I also sautéed the onion and garlic in 1 tbsp butter. I whisked the seasoning into the egg/cream mixture and then added the veggies and cheese and whisked again. Poured it into my (pre-cooked) pampered chef pie crusts and covered the edges of the pie crusts so they wouldn't burn. I made this a day ahead so the pie would set up nicely. I will definitely make this again...very nice crowd pleasing recipe and so many filling variations.

Love..love this recipe. Used 2% milk and no cream at all. Added bacon. My husband does not like quiche, but loved this one. Did not freeze the crust first, but it still came out crisp and flaky. Just as good second day reheated in microwave. This was the lightest and fluffiest quiche I have ever had.

I love this recipe and have used many different vegetables and cheeses in the filling. I blogged a variation with sweet potato in my blog roadrunnergourmet.wordpress.com

Fabulous traditional quiche. Made as directed, excepted added chopped pancetta for the bacon variation. Don't forget to allow enough time to freeze the crust after rolling. Also, layer the ingredients. Layered the fried pancetta, then the shredded gruyere and topped with the egg mixture. Freshly grated nutmeg on the top brings out the nutty flavor of the gruyere. DefiNitely a keeper.

Easy recipe for a fairly quick, light dinner. I had refrigerated pie crust, so I used that. I didn't have anything to weight the pie crust down with, but poking a few holes seemed to work fine to keep it from puffing up. The directions seem to be a bit out of order, i.e., "Turn the mixture into the pre-baked pastry, and spread out the cheese evenly over the bottom of the pastry", as well as salt and pepper missing from the recipe. But I (and I'm sure others) intuitively knew to layer the cheese first, and add s & p, especially since creme fraiche is a bit bland. I used gruyere, and didn't add anything else in, but the next time I will try bacon, spinach and caramelized onions. My 8 and 10 year old gave it a good review, and I thought it was really very good. I will definitely make it again.

I live in France 4 months out of the year and I can honestly say that this recipe is probably better than most quiche I've tasted here. I just love it and do all kinds of variations. I make it in a big tart pan and use 5 eggs ( XL) instead of the 6 and it works great. I leave out the pastry weights and aluminum foil step and it seems to work fine. Thanks so much!

Great quiche texture and was beautiful right out of the oven. I followed the recipe exactly and used 8oz gruyere as well as the nutmeg and creme fraiche. I had to add salt and pepper after it was cooked. I may add a touch more nutmeg as well next time. I did cheat and use a pre-made crust so I am wondering if that will also impart more flavor to the quiche.

Rating: 4
This is a great basic recipe however I found the custard too eggy - liking a creamier texture myself - and bland. I spiked it up with a splash of worcestershire, tbsp of dijon, fresh thyme, lots of ground pepper, and a dash of soya sauce. I reduced the eggs to 5. Try adding bacon, carmelized onions, shallots or sauteed leeks. Also note that the filling amounts for this recipe will fill 2 9" deep-dish pre-made pie crusts. Best to be made with whole milk and cream as directed.

I made the swiss & onion for a bridal shower, it was easy and delicious. I cut the swiss into small cubes. When you take a bite, you get these great little nuggets of melted swiss mixed in with the creamy egg and onion mixture. My only note, is I will add a small amount of salt to the egg mixture next time. It was a hit and a keeper!

Rating: 3
There's a major flaw in the recipe - it fails to mention that the temperature should be reduced to 375 once you put the quiche in. This resulted in me burning my crust terribly the first time. Also, my quiche took 55 minutes (at 425) to finish cooking. I may have overfilled since I used a smaller pie dish than the 10.5" stated. Other than these issues, the quiche is delicious and rich and I will certainly try it again with some modification to the cooking time and temperature.

perfect, custard quiche. make as presented.

I have made this quiche several times, and just noticed why several people (including me) have had minor issues with the amount of filling and the cooking times; the recipe for the pastry dough makes "enough dough for a 10 1/2 inch tart pan," while the actual recipe calls for a "10-1/2 inch glass or metal pie plate (not removable bottom)." The volumes are obviously very different! Maybe once we take these points into account while cooking, we can concentrate on the flavor,which IS very good.

I LOVED this quiche, but I did make some adjustments to the fillings. I added some fresh rosemary and manchego as the "fillings". The consistency of the filling and the crust were perfect. And I made it in the morning and served it several hours later at room temp as part of a brunch. Rave reviews.

Made this recipe exactly as written (used cream, not creme fraiche). I think it was very good, but not great. It may have been the gruyere. I may try another cheese next time.

This is the best quiche recipe I have ever found and has the creamy richness I want from my quiche. Do not make any modifications to the ratio of eggs/cream/milk in the recipe - it works like magic every time. I vary the cheese and veggie combination, but always try to keep the amount down to let the custard shine through. For the crust, I use my favorite pie dough recipe and bake it in a 10" spring form pan. Lining the outside of the pan with foil prevents any liquid from the quiche from leaking through the cracks in the crust. Also, depending on the oven, it can take anywhere from 30 to 50 minutes to bake through. Always delicious!

Just to share a trick on blind baking a crust with custard filling. When you take out the pie weights and before returning to the oven, brush the crust with one of the egg whites. It will seal the crust (especially where you have pricked) and be much flakier without absorbing the wet custard mixture.

Rating: 4
Made this for dinner tonight with crust recipe suggested - did add more salt as recommended by other reviewers - found it to be a nice, substantial, yet flaky pastry that held up to the filling well. Didn't have a 10.5 in pie pan so I used the 9.5 in deep dish and rolled the dough to 10.5 in. crimped the crust level with the top of the pie pan and covered edges the entire time. Followed the recipe for the filling, using gruyere cheese, 4 oz applewood smoked bacon, and 1 T minced shallots sauted in the bacon grease. Also added 1/4 C chopped fresh broccoli (gave nice color!), and probably 1 tsp sea salt and 2 tsp pepper. There was more filling than I could put into the pie shell so I baked it separately in a greased (olive oiled) small rectangular baking dish. Both were done in 25 min (golden, puffy, with no wiggle) My kids were skeptical, but son had 2 servings! Daughter not hungry now, and DH not home yet, so will have to post any other responses later. I personally LOVED it!! It was creamy (although I might take it out a bit sooner next time), yet light and very flavorful. I don't know that I would bother with another crust recipe - I thought this one was well suited (with extra salt). I will definitely make this again!!

Rating: 4
This was delicious and super easy to make! I used gruyere cheese, and added sauted leeks and mushrooms. I had some filling left over and made it into a little frittata. Since I made it a day ahead, I re-heated it in the oven for about 30 min at 325. It came out perfectly!

GREAT recipe. I make it as is except add 3/4 tsp salt and one bunch of asparagus (chopped up pretty small and not pre-cooked). Use a good gruyere and this tastes like the perfect quiche - simple, perfect consistency, perfect flavor.

Wow! This was restaurant quality and very easy to make. I used store crust and prepared per the instructions minus pie weights (forgot to use them). I baked the quiche in my Emile Henry ceramic pie pan and it turned out beautifully. This pie pan is very tall and I did not have much left over ingredients - no way I could have baked a second quiche. For some reason, the 2 on my oven is not working, so I baked it at 415 degrees instead of 425 - and it took about 40 minutes to bake. After about 20 minutes, the top of the quiche was brown so I covered the entire thing with foil (covered just the edges to start) for the last 20 minutes. I prepared the quiche a few hours in advance of lunch and I strongly suggest this is the best way to serve the quiche as it was a bit runny and wet straight out of the oven. 3 hours after coming out of the oven, it was perfect. Per other reviewer's suggestions, I put a thin layer of stone ground mustard on the bottom of the crust before adding a layer of sauteed leeks and then a second layer of mushrooms sauteed with rosemary and black pepper. I used a combo of emmenthaler and gruyere and I added the nutmeg on top even though I'm not sure it made a difference. I did not adjust the proportion of milk/cream (and it tasted like I had used the real stuff!), but I will lighten it up next time with skim milk and a lot less cream. Lastly, I added 1 tsp of salt to the egg mixture and I salted the leeks/mushroom layers separately as well. It was perfectly salted for my taste. I would love to try this with a whole wheat crust or the wild rice crust mentioned in another review since the white flour store crust was a bit too "refined" for me and the creaminess of the quiche would compliment a heartier crust.

I make this quiche often and it always gets gobbled up. I think the key is to use good to great cheese.

Nice recipe but BE CAREFUL! Nowhere does it advise you to drop the temperature to 375 degrees while it bakes in the oven. At 425, you'll end up with a burnt crust after the 30 minutes baking time.

I think this is the perfect basic quiche recipe - very dense custard, but not too heavy, and easily adapted. I used a higher proportion of cream, as I only had low fat milk, added bacon, white cheddar and sauteed onions and it was incredible. Don't forget the nutmeg - it adds a subtle touch. We ate this every day for lunch until it was gone, so I am getting ready to make another.

Usually I can rely on epicurious reviews to lead me in the right direction. This recipe, however, failed to deliver. It was really quite bland (I used ementhal). Four of us tried it and one person's response was "lose this recipe". I had such high hopes that I might just try it again and try adding more nutmeg, salt and pepper. I can't believe so many would be so wrong...:(

For me, something like quiche that consists of about 25% custard and 75% fillings is ideal. The idea is a lower fat, protein-based vessel for bits of savory flavors. Clearly, this is not quiche at all, just a mess, but the outcome tastes delicious. I made asparagus, broccoli, bacon, leeks & onions, and English Cheddar "quiche" on gluten-free crust. Mostly fillings suspended in a lighter egg mixture. A pinch of cayenne pepper is a *spectacular* flavor addition to filled "quiche". Produces a tiny flash of heat that mellows and spreads gently across a lot of different fillings.

I really suggest you do not change the milk/cream ratio. I tried to make it with just milk to make it healthier and it was horrible. I did all cream once to make it extra rich and it was awful. The ratio they have is perfect! Perhaps adding a bit more cheese would make it richer. I love this recipe and coming up with new flavors. Chicken and asparagus is my personal favorite while my boyfriend prefers just spinach.

My husband and I had Quiche, at a family owned bakery a few days ago while on a three day weedend in Paris. I was determined to find the recipe! This is close. I made it today. This is what I would change to perfect it. 1. The dough suggested is not the right quantity for the filling. I used a tart pan which was perfect for the quantity of filling however, I will up the dough to 1 1/2 times as it should be about a 1/4 inch thick. The dough is as it should be crusty not fluffy. 2. Regarding the filling I used medium eggs not large. 3. I will not use any milk only cream for the full quanity of the liquids suggested. The quiche I tasted in Paris was richer. 4. I will reduce the cheese to 6oz. 5. Finally I folded in 5 oz of smoked sliced ham and cut into squares. I believe these changes should resemble the real French Quiche of last weekend!

This is far and away the best quiche I've ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, including the wonderful crust, and made 2 bacon and cheese quiches. I served this to a group of 12 ladies for lunch. There was not a morsel left on any plate. I can't wait to serve it again.

To A Cook From Richmond: You just grate the cheese and stir it into the egg mixture. I have made this recipe at least 5 times, sometimes with crust from scratch and sometimes with pre-made; either way it is amazing! (My brother-in-law hates quiche, but he loved this.) I use bacon, broccoli and spinach, and a mix of cheddar and other cheeses. But even just fresh herbs would be amazing - it is a perfect custard to work with! When adding fillings, as other cooks mentioned, you end up with A LOT left-over - you can bake it in a greased dish without crust if necessary to use up the filling.

made this and really enjoyed it...added in bacon, onion, fennel, and thyme and oregano. Think it needed a tad more cheese and a bit more bacon to make the flavors truly marry. Was a lovely brunch we truly enjoyed.

The short cut that I made during this recipe was using a local organic fresh savory pie crust. Before adding the milk/egg/cream/cheese mixture, I spread the crust with roasted elephant garlic and mushrooms and onions sauteed in butter sprinkled with dried herbs. This was so easy (again, helped to have the frozen crust) and the veggies added depth. It was my first time making quiche and I would do it again and again! I served it to my kids (my 12 year old helped make it) and a friend for breakfast and subsequently thought about the rest of the day! One note: it took more like 50 minutes and was not nearly done at 30. Enjoy!

Great recipe - but here is my advice. I used frozen 9" pie crusts and the recipe, as is, is enough for about 1.5 - so double the recipe and make 3. Like others add half-teaspoon of salt. ALSO, like all quiche, the favor and texture is much better if the pie is let to cool and then eaten the next day after reheating. This allows for a firmer, less watery consistency.

An excellent recipe. I caramelized slices from 2 onions and briefly sauted 1.5 cups of chopped fresh spinach. I put both at the bottom of the pie pan and poured the filling on top. It needed more like 35 minutes to cook completely in my oven. And the pastry recipe is fabulous, too. My new standard quiche recipe, for sure.

Mon dieu! This is the best quiche I have ever eaten - and a single woman's best friend! I almost think you could add a little sugar, lemon zest and juice and have a "dessert quiche", it is so light and fluffy! I used a packaged pie crust but blind-baked it as instructed, after putting it in the freezer. I also used imported gruyere. I then added spinach and ham and ended up with a full meal in one crust I can eat for three more days! What's not to love?!

This recipe achieves exactly the creamy consistency I was hoping for. I added sauteed Hen of the Woods mushrooms on top - the flavor permeated the custardy filling, and was the best quiche I've ever eaten, even though the crust was slightly thick and tough. I am going to go to the kitchen and eat the whole pie now. I used 3/4 cup whole milk, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 5 eggs and 6 oz cheese. Still had filling left over when using 9in pie pan. Cooked for 40 min at 425, until it puffed and then I immediately took it out.

I made this for a New Year's brunch and it was a hit! I only had a 9" pie pan so I did bake it for longer as suggested. The only problem was that the top got too brown.

I've made many quiches before, but this one really is a great base recipe, which is what I was looking for. The ratio of eggs/cream/milk yields a perfectly textured, not too light, not too heavy filling. But it's also flexible. I used 2/3 cup 2% milk and 1 cup heavy cream. I made 2 quiches w/ double the recipe. 1 with spinach, cooked crumbled sausage, and pepper jack cheese; and the other w/ broccoli & cheddar. Kids and adults loved it. I use my own pate brisee crust.

I really liked this crust - easy to make and tasty with a nice texture. The quiche filling was made as written and was way too cheesy for our taste. About 1/4 that much cheese would have been comparable to the delicious quiches we had while recently in Paris. The custard was tasty and a nice texture but I will have to adjust the filling additions before making it again. I used gruyere with bacon as recommended.

yeah, this is definitely the recipe. quiche isn't hard to make at all, but the right mix of ingredients is, of course, important.

gawd, I love this quiche. I love the texture, and it works so well with any filling. the only problem is my bf doesn't love quiche, so I'm left to eat the whole thing.

I've used this basic reicpe many times. I am always asked to bring my wild rice quiche to Thanksgiving dinner which is basically this filling with a plain wild rice crust.

I have made this base recipe numerous times, with multiple variations on fillings, all with excellent results. Spinach/gruyere, bacon/onion/cheese. ham/cheese, etc. The key, as far as I"m concerned is the dairy quantity, making the filling a very pale yellow and SO creamy. This is a GREAT keeper recipe. Baking times have varied according to the filling amounts, I've found, but you just need to keep an eye on it, and understand that the center will appear slightly "jiggly" even when it's done.

Did I do this wrong? Although my quiche puffed up beautifully, once it went back down it sort of tasted like scrambled eggs in a pie dish. I admit, I didn't use cream - I used sour cream, since that's kind of like creme fraiche. Maybe that messed it up, but I was disappointed it didn't come out as creamy as the other reviews! :( Lesson learned: Sour Cream doesn't really work very well as a substitution.

The basic pastry is delicious and flaky - a quick favorite which I have adopted. The basic quiche recipe is DIVINE. (I'm a convert from the Julia Child method.) If you bake it in the top of the oven and cook closer to 375 it will almost "souffle" and get puffy and just the right amount of brown (you have to keep an eye on it). If baked at 350, it comes out so light, fluffy/creamy and delicious. Obviously it comes out best made with whole milk and heavy cream. I always use what I have in the fridge. Today was red pepper, green onion and sharp cheddar - yummy! Since you have to saute additions in butter, the whole thing turns in to a bit of an indulgence, but well worth it.

I have made this many times and love the soft consistency of it. I use a 9 1/2 (24cm) pyrex pie plate and making a bit less pastry I take the pastry to the top of the dish and find that I can accomodate all of the filling if the additions are not too bulky. I use whatever cheese I have on hand - often mozzarella adding a piece of blue cheese for additional flavor. Personally I don't like too strong a cheese flavor and never use the whole 8 ounces called for. I use 2% milk as that is what we have in the house and whipping cream and bake at 375 with no crust burning even though I fully prebake the crust (hate soggy undercrusts). I add whatever I have in the house at the time and slightly cook any vegetables like chopped peppers or onions before adding them. For the pastry I use half whole wheat flour and for the fat half butter/half earth balance (I think it is) - the non trans fat shortening you get at Whole Foods. Delicious and just as good made in advance and reheated or eaten cold.

I LOVED this quiche! I made it with pancetta and cave aged gruyere (from Trader Joes) and some onions sautéed with a dash of white truffle oil. Cest magnifique!

Perfect. A hit at a baby shower I hosted this weekend. Using store-bought mini tart shells, kept frozen until filling and popping in the oven (on a cookie sheet, 400F, 20-25 min.), produced a golden crust. With mini- quiches, it is easiest to first put all ingredients, including the cheese, directly in the tart shell, then ladle in the custard.

Definitely use whole milk- it makes it taste like a "real" quiche. I tried using 1% and it wasn't nearly as good. My favorite is a combination of shallots, spinach, and Vermont's Cabot cheddar cheese.

This quiche is perfect. If you eat it straight out of the oven, it's light and fluffy. it gets a little denser if you refrigerate it. I just ate a piece that was 4 days old and it was still quite good. Try smoked gouda and bacon combo.

The only thing I did different was to make the crust with whole wheat flour. My local healthfood deli does this with their quiche and I have always loved it. This is awesome. The gruyere is a must...and the nutmeg...sooo good!!

Supremely wonderful recipe. I used a cave-aged gruyere, no nutmeg and whole milk for the milk and the cream. I also used a store-bought crust since I was in a hurry. Lastly, I also just stirred the gruyere right into the liquids and it worked fine. My 10 inch quich dish was definitly a little small, so be sure to go with a larger one, or roll out your dough to go fully up the sides of the dish so there is no overflow. The only improvement I would suggest is to actually whip the eggs instead of a little whisking. It might be a little more souffle-like if you do that, but personally I felt the mixture could have used a little more air in it. Anyway, make this. You'll be exceptionally happy, as will your guests.

This was fantastic! I used gruyere and did the onion version. I also add 3 strips of crumbled bacon. I brought it to the party & the best chef there said it was "sublime." I had some extra filling (I used a smaller pan), I put the extra cheese/filling (no bacon or onions) into two small ramkins (no crust) and cooked them for about 20 minutes--oh so good!!!

This is a great basic recipe which can be easily embellished to make something even more fantastic. Thanks to everyone else's reviews, I added more salt to my pastry crust (a good move). I also separately fried up 2 gloves of minced garlic, 1 shallot, and 2 large handfuls of spinach (enough to line the bottom of the pastry, once cooked) with salt, pepper, and butter. I then drained the veggies, and put them at the bottom of my cooked pastry. I used emmenthal cheese (no nutmeg), and because I had 2% milk on me, used 1 cup of cream, and 3/4 cup 2% milk. The quiche turned out GREAT! Only concern was that because I added spinach, there was a bit too much filling for my pie plate. I also did not need to cook the quiche for 30 minutes (more like 25).

This was the first quiche I have ever made and I was surprised just how easy it was. I used the basic pastry recipe, following directions and avoiding too much hand contact. It turned out rich and flaky. I made two quiches using milk and heavy cream: spinach/onion/emmenthal er and bacon/cheddar. Both were excellent. I will be making this again, but as a rare treat, since it is exceptionally high in cholesterol!

I'm writing this review as I reprint this favorite recipe. I have been making this quiche for six years. I am so happy with it. I've gained a lot of confidence in making crusts thanks to the detailed tips. The cheese makes all the difference in how it tastes. I prefer to use Gruyere. But often use half Gruyere half Cheddar to suit the Filipino palate. My teenage sons' friends like it with ordinary Cheddar and bacon.

I usually use a quiche recipe from Julia Child's cookbook, but since this one had such high ratings I decided to try it. I found it far heavier than I like quiche to be, and quite bland (although the blandness could be the the fault of the cheese I used). I will be going back to Julia's recipe and not using this one again.

Excellent quiche.. Made it in a springform pan and didn't have to prebake the crust (did use Pillsbury pie crust and rolled out to about 10"). The results are delicious and make a beautiful presentation. Top was a little dark. Will cover with foil next time for part of the baking time.

I don't know how many times I have used this recipe (usually as a basis for some 'twist' of my own); it's wonderful! Most recently, my mother (who has Celiac disease) opined that one dish she missed the most since adopting a gluten-free diet, was quiche. After a bit of experimentation, I found the following adjustments made for a dream-come-true for Mom.

Wonderful recipe just as written. Rich, creamy, flavorful filling without being too heavy. I would recommend leaving the crust edges covered most of the time it is in the oven. I have made this several times and find that at 425 the edges of the crust burn unless well covered with foil from the start, including blind baking.

On my first try this recipe came out wonderfully. I followed the recipe exactly with following exceptions: Used 9" glass pie plate with roll out store bought crust, added sauteed onions and mushrooms before pouring egg mixture. I baked at 425 for 35 minutes for perfect results. I served this at a lunch party of 8 people and all loved it. I did have approx 1.5 cups of excess filling that I baked in a small souffle dish. To prevent excess next time I will try halving the amount of cheese used, eliminating 1 egg, and reducing liquids by approx 1/4 for a 9 inch pie plate. Will definitely keep this recipe in my back pocket for future use.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed. With the 10 1/2 inch metal pie pan and no substitutions, it was finished in 30 minutes (did not take longer as many reviewers noted.) The crust was very easy to work with, but a little bland. The filling was nice and creamy, but also was a little bland. Because we had a lot of picky eaters coming for this meal, I did not make it with the variations. I'd like to try this again using extra ingredients and a mix of cheeses for more flavour.

This was my first quiche, and it was AMAZING! I'm usually pretty critical of my own cooking, but this was stupendous!!! I made the quiche with spinach, vidalia onions, and mushrooms, and it was a major hit. I'm making it again for the second time in a month. I followed some of the suggestions... subbed in four eggs with eggbeaters and cut back a bit with light cream. I also covered the crust with foil and baked a bit longer. Sooooo yummy. Enjoy! :)

I usually find that recipes here that have great reviews are pretty right on. But this was a very disappointing recipe. I've made lots of quiches and this has to be the most bland tasting one I've ever had. I even used sauteed onion in it and had Maderia reduced in the onions and it was STILL blah! The crust was the most tasteless crust I've ever made...I'm really surprised, b/c I figured that making it with butter would make it better, but not so. I normally use Crisco shortening and will continue to do so..for some reason, it makes a much nicer crust. I'm not sure if it was just that it called for a "pinch" of salt (I usually use a tsp. in my crust) or what that made it so tasteless, but the entire product was in need of 'something'. Won't make this one again.

Fabulous! Unlike most quiche recipes, this makes a firm, non-watery quiche that is simple and flavourful. I used heavy cream in place of the milk for a richer taste (it was heavenly!), organic valley raw milk swiss cheese, and added in caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms and a bit of baby spinach. Mine cooked in exactly the time stated in the recipe. Quiche doesn't get better than this.

We just finished dinner and this was the BIGGEST HIT! My son (9) and mother-in-law (88) both loved it. My husband and I loved it also. It's hard to please everyone in my household, so this is definitely a dish I will make again. Some people had trouble getting the center to cook, but mine was done in 35 minutes; I did cover the edges so they didn't burn. Overall I would give this 5 forks if I could.

I used a pre-made deep dish crust which was able to hold all of the filling. I had a problem with the top of the quiche and the crust browning too quickly, had to use foil as others did. In addition, turned the oven down to 375 after 30 minutes. Overall, had to bake for a LOT longer than indicated, but the end product was delish.

To keep the foil on, insert toothpicks into the crust, just not too deeply.

A great standard quiche recipe. I made one with a creamy gorgonzola and carmelized onion. What a hit! I was a little nervous about the gorgonzola but YUM! Cooking time obviously depends on the depth of your dish. I'll use this over and over again.

I used the mini phyllo cups and the quiche filling. As for keeping the foil on the crust. Put the whole thing on a cooking sheet so you don't have to touch the foil. That is the only thing I can think of. The low-fat milk probably lengthened your cooking time, as did the addition of the vegetables. Next time, if you have to use low-fat milk... use a bit less and add a couple more egg whites. I may help firm up the filling a bit faster before your crust burns.

Rating: 3
Definitely takes longer than 30 minutes. I added bacon, shrooms and onioins (sauteed the shrooms and onions in a bit of bacon grease) and used swiss cheese. I was also forced to sub low fat for the whole milk. Put foil around the edges after the first 30 minutes. Does anyone have an easy trick for getting the foil to stay put? I'm pretty bad at it. Good quiche.

This was our night before the Thanksgiving feast supper. My pie crusts(my own recipe)came out a little less attractive than I had hoped and I didn't want them to go to waste. I only had cheap shredded Swiss, but it was great. I did use two regular crusts for the whole recipe and there was plenty filling. I put some of the cheese in the bottom and then mixed the rest in with the filling. I used the exact milk to cream ratio called for but baked at 375 for 25 minutes and was perfectly done.

Easy recipe, and fantastic result!! I added four chopped green onions for depth of flavor, and mixed guyere and ementhale cheeses. Try a foil ring around the crust, as mine got a little too dark, but was delicious, fluffy, and my husband loved it! This will certainly become my standard quiche recipe.

this was my first quiche ever, and overall i must say, it worked out great. luckily i read many of the comments before going into it, so i modified a few things. here's what i changed/did: -used a proper quiche pan (ceramic), which i would guess has a lot to do with the fact that it cooked very evenly and wasnt underdone in the middle. -because of that same comment made by others, i cooked it at 425 for 40 minutes (note, i am at sea level). -only used 5 eggs instead of 6. -the pastry crust came out great consistency-wise, but was slightly bitter (but i'm guessing that maybe my flour was just overdue/old?). - i did not have any problems with the crust burning at all, and i pre-cooked it as instructed. again, i thought this was very good, i added spinach, mushrooms (was sure to drain them before adding) and sliced prosciutto. also used gruyere, heavy whipping cream and 2% milk.

Thank you! Whether this is a good recipe on it's own is not important. The fact that it may be used as a basic recipe, substituting ingredients, is. I can imagine putting anything I want in this quiche and having it work out. I had two 9-inch pie plates, two Pillsbury crusts that you unroll, extra sharp cheddar cheese, some fresh tomato and sweet Vidalia onions. I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 i.e. 9 eggs, 1.5 c. milk, 1 c. cream and made two smaller quiches. It worked out beautifully. I did need to cover crust with foil after 20 minutes, but, hey, a small price to pay for a terrific looking set of quiches. Now, whether three young boys and my husband (the 80's were very bad for "manly men" and quiche) will eat it along with me is another story entirely. I'll assume it's good the next day, and the next, and the...

This is a great recipe. I'm sure it's delicious made precisely as directed, but I used it as a guide to make my first quiche, which turned out great. Yes, the French use heavy cream and whole milk, but they also substitute lighter ingredients all the time, so don't think that it won't "work" or be authentic if you do the same. I used some half-and-half and some 2% milk. I added crumbled goat cheese, roasted red peppers, a little roasted garlic, and about a tablespoon of pesto, swirled across the top for color and flavor. Delicious out of the fridge (reheated in the microwave) the next day. Not so great out of the freezer (quiche was yummy, but crust was soggy).

I have to agree with the few dissenters here. This was just okay. The baking time had to be increased significantly to firm up the center and by then, the edge of my crust had burned. If I ever do it again, I'll be sure to cover the edges with foil and expect the longer baking time. The result was a bit heavy for my taste. I love cheese, but by the time I finished a piece of this quiche, I felt as though I had just eaten a big block of gruyere (and I actually only used 6.5-7.0 ounces rather than the full 8!). In fact, I was the only one that ate it at all - the husband and kids finished their side dishes and then made themselves sandwiches while the leftovers of this quiche went in the trash. Not a big hit here, to say the least.

I used the recipe for this quiche and added the filling from the Arugula and Bacon quiche recipe. I also used a store bought crust and cheaped out and used swiss cheese. It all worked out great.

I don't usually try a recipe to change it, but my husband is doing the low carb thing. I have made this omitting the crust, and using Hood Carb Countdown Dairy Beverage in place of the milk. I bake it the same amount of time, refridgerate and microwave for about 1 minute in the morning. This is much cheaper than the low carb quiche offered in the local grocery store. I have made spinach, mushroom, asparagus, ham and cheddar and the onion & bacon.

Best quiche ever. I used a mix of gruyere and jarlsberg cheeses. Used half and half instead of whole milk. I also cut back to just 5 eggs.

The quintessential quiche - absolutely perfect. Very dense. Made mine a day ahead and added fresh herbs from the garden. Served at room temp and it was wonderful. Very easy to make, just follow the directions for the crust. I did lower temperature as suggested by others and it took about 1 hour to bake.

made this before as the recipe says - but today i was out of cream, so i just used 1 percent milk as a replacement for all of the cream and the whole milk, and though i had to cook it a little longer, it came out terrific!!! So if you don't have cream on hand or can't eat something that rich, go with milk with a little fat in it. Seriously, it really came out fabulous - I made mine with shallots, mushrooms, and bacon.

I specially paid attention to the resting and freezing of the pastry dough as other reviewers suggested. I also lowered the temperature to 375 (also previously suggested). It took 45 minutes at that temperature, but it was perfect. I didn't even need to put tin foil on the edges.

This is an excellent recipe. I did not have a 10-1/2 pan so I used a 9-inch deep dish, cut the liquid down to 1 cup, added sauteed mushrooms, carmelized onions, and dropped the temp to 375 and baked it for 30 minutes. It came out perfectly. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I have already made it 3 times. Rave reviews from all, even those who had never tried quiche. This is definitely a keeper.

I tried this recipe twice before reviewing, and I don't think that par-baking the crust is vital. (although the freezing of the crust is)Instead, simply place the quiche on a sheet pan on the lower/lowest rack of the oven to bake, and it will brown nicely. Depositing the cheese on the bottom also helps form a protective layer between the crust and the custard. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and I felt it needed some salt.

This recipe gave me the basics for making an excellent quiche for my first time. The recipe makes a lot more than I expected. The first time I made this, it filled two shallow pie crusts. The second time I made it, it filled 1 deep springform pan lined with pastry. I made a spinach and mushroom filling which went excellent with the cheese used in the recipe. My guests loved it. Husband loves it. Its easy and fun to make.

Very good~! I carmelized onions and sauteed mushrooms for a good 30 minutes, then made two quiches-- each with this lining the crust. In one quiche I used the crust provided with this recipe (good, flakey, a little clumpy) and the other used a store bought crust (more moist). Both were good-- if you're short on time the pre-prepared is fine. In one I added broccoli, the other roasted tomato (roasted for an hour at low heat until it became very sweet and dry). Both fillings were good-- next time I'll add more veggies. Used Emmentaler and medium cheddar-- next time I'll try Gruyere. The cheese combo could've been better. But overall, a good base recipe that I'll return to. The nutmeg was vrey srange and a bad idea-- would definitely not do that again.

Fabulous! Okay, I cheated and used a Marie Callendar (sp?) pie crust, baked it, then baked the quiche. The recipe actually made two quiches since I used the frozen pie crust.

What a mess. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and the middle of this quiche was a messy pool of raw egg!!! I had to leave it in the over 4x as long as the recipe stated.

I just whipped this up for an impromptu lunch and it was terrific. I added some breakfast ham and carmelized onions to it and the result was wonderful.

This recipe was great. I made it for a pre-theatre brunch and it was a hit. I was a little apprehensive to make the pie crust, so I made one the the day before just to test it out. It was the easist pie crust recipe to make not to mention the quiche itself. No more store bought pie crust for me. I also added spinich, onion and bacon to the quiche. To avoid the edges of the crust from getting too brown, I covered the edges of the pie crust with a strip of foil when baking the quiche for the remaining 30 minutes.

I doubled everything and made two -- one with bacon, spinach and mushrooms, and one with roasted red pepper, onion and zucchini. Cooked the former for dinner tonight, froze the latter. I heeded my fellow Epicures' advice and baked the whole shebang at 325 for 40 minutes, and it was DELICIOUS. My husband inhaled three slices and declared it the best quiche he'd ever eaten in his life. It is calorie-intensive, but worth it. If you follow the original recipe to the letter, be prepared to hunt down the absolute best ingredients you can. It's so simple that it won't fly with ordinary supermarket cheese and eggs.

I just attempted to make this recipe for mother's day. The only reason I can think of as to why it was a disaster is that I used a ceramic (le crueset) dish instead of glass or metal. I followed the recipe to the letter and after 45 minutes in the oven at 425 the edges were burning but the center was still a pool of liquid. I will not use this quiche recipe again!

Terrific quiche! The best I've ever tasted and so simple to make. I made if for a Breakfast Tea I was having for my girlfriends. They all said it was absolutely delicious and ate every bite. I made the bacon and onion variation of the recipe and added a layer of spinach, 8 c. fresh baby spinach sauteed in olive oil and squeezed dry. I will definitely make this recipe for years to come!

Wonderful, to save time I use frozen pie crusts, added brocolli and mushrooms to one and onions and mushrooms to the other. Also mixed in some sharp cheddar with the swiss.

I loved this recipe! It was quite simple to make and my family loved it. I would definitely make this again.

Excellently flavorful and very easy. Portions in the recipe are perfect. This is a luxurious-tasting yet simple dish that allows you to use whatever cheese/veg/meat you have to hand. Hence, this classic recipe allows new twists every time in my house. I up the cooking time considerably as the shake test confounds me and I am a perennial worrier where matters of salmonella are concerned.

This is THE BEST quiche recipe ever! I've had to log onto my computer two times now bc I couldn't find the recipe I'd printed out. Definitely a keeper, and I've always used whatever cheese I have in my fridge. I've doubled the recipe and made enough for a post-wedding brunch - incredibly easy and tasty! I highly recommend this (and I use frozen pie crusts...)

I made this quiche with bacon and it was delicious. The comment I got from one of my guests is that it had the texture of a custard (popular amongst my family). I used a store-bought pie crust which was just as good. I also did not use gruyere, but rather regular swiss. This dish is rich, but delicious and easy to prepare.

Rating: 4
This recipe made for a wonderful Christmas brunch. I made 2 quiches one with the bacon and the other with onions and red and green pepper which made it look very festive. I also froze the quiches a few days ahead to help me in the preparation and it still turned out perfectly. Definately a keeper.

I made this quiche and the spinach, red pepper and feta quiche for Xmas brunch. This was my first time making quiche so I was pleasantly surprised with the results and ease of these recipies. I had always been intimidated by the thought of making my own pastry shell but no more. My crust was so light and flaky. I was impressed! I should clarify why I said I would not make this dish again. I found the filling to be too rich and custard like. Maybe using less cream and more milk might change the texture, or is it the half pound of gruyere!?

Rating: 4
Unbelievably excellent recipe!!!! i did, however, substitute the big dish pie crust into little tiny (petite) pie crusts. I also added spinach sauteed with garlic and olive oil into the recipe (drained, of course). Baked 7at a time in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes! PERFECTION! I would recommend adding a bit more salt and definitely add the nutmeg into the wet mixture before adding into the pie crusts. Definitely a dish beyond compare! Watch your guests devour this in minutes!

I have made this quiche for the past two years for christmas brunch and it has been a hit both years. I make several variations, a pancetta with carmelized onions, sausage and peppers with mozzarella, and a spinach and red pepper with either feta or guyere.

Rating: 4
Fabulous and simple! I've also made this with spinach and portabello mushrooms, which were great additions. For the mushrooms, I sauteed the extra moisture off in a pan and then dried on paper towels before adding to the quiche. Spinach should also be cooked and squeezed dry before adding.

Rating: 4
It was delicious. However, I made a few changes to the original recipe. I used 2 frozen pastry shells instead of making my own. Added more onions. Used 5 eggs instead of 6 and a little more cream than milk (I had bought the large heavy cream container by mistake). I also turned down oven to 400 and let it bake a little longer. I will do it again.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Used half emmenthal/half gruyere cheese and added some shallots and spinach. I used only 5 eggs and it fit nicely into the baking dish. I cooked it for about 45-50 minutues at 375 degrees and it came out great! I would keep an eye out for the crust and cover it if it looks like it's getting too brown. Made it for lunch for some friends and they loved it!

Rating: 4
This was really fabulous! I used a combo of emmenthaler and gryuere cheeses. Also chopped and pan fried some bacon. This was the first time making a pie crust for me and it was PERFECT! I will use it always. I had to cook the quiche for twice as long - could have been because I live at 9600 feet, but who knows. My dad was so happy - he is a real man and he LOVES quiche.

Amazingly good. I used an extra onion on top plus added chard. A sure winner to all who dined on it.

Forget about buying store bought quiche!. This one was excellent. I did everything as the recipe said and added the sauteed onions, sauteed with olive oil. Then for the liquid mixtured I substituted 2% milk for whole milk and it came out great!. I also added the onions and the cheese to the egg mixture, wich added the flavours to the egg mixture. Here is a little tip; Instead of using aluminium to bake the shell, use parchment paper. It helps it from sticking and it's safer to use as well. Enjoy!

The quiche turned out amazing (with sauteed onions). Everyone loved it. I made it one day, left it out of the fridge covered in foil, then heated it up in a very slow oven the next day and it came out great. I'm making this one again for my birhtday in a huge baking pan!

This is the best quiche I have ever made. Impressed all my English relatives! I have always been of the life is too short to make pie crust, but never again will I buy one! This is excellent!

This quiche is fabulous! I used cheap Emmenthal cheese, which was all I had on hand, and spread first a layer of caramelized onions and then swiss chard sauteed with garlic before topping with the custard. Next time I will use gruyere, as I think it will be even better. My boyfriend and I ate almost the entire thing!

Just delicious! I followed the recipe to the letter and I got rave reviews. It was definitely rich, though.

Rating: 4
GREAT! Tried 3 variations-bacon, red pepper/sausage, and spinach/onion (all had gruyere cheese) The spinach was by far the favorite! Just saute onion, then spinach, and be sure to squeeze the h20 out. Also- I kept foil over the crust for all but about 7 minutes of baking time. First attempt was to well done for my taste. Enjoy...you won't regret this one! P.S. Why have I been buying prepared pie crusts when they're so easy???

I have never attempted a quiche before, and in fact, I have never made pastry before. It was very easy to make, and the results were spectacular. I can't wait to make this again.

It's to die for! I've made the onion variety several times with Finnish Valio Red Emmenthal and I could not think a picnic without "my quiche". Neither can my friends who always request it. Lately I've used good quality blue cheese (I've used Finnish Aura, it's inexpensive here) instead of emmenthal and it turned out really great. I've even impressed my gourmet food-loving American inlaws with the blue cheese quiche. A classic in my family!

This is an excellent recipe - simple and perfect. With such basic ingredients, this is one of those dishes that the quality of the ingredients really MATTERS. I followed the recipe exactly, it actually made 1 deep dish quiche, plus about 1/4 of one, left over (crust AND filling), which I made in a ramekin as a "taster" as I was taking the completed dish to share. DO make the scratch pastry - so worth it. Next time, I might add spinach, maybe a little more cheese, and a little pepper for kick. The nutmeg is an important ingredient. I also might do an egg-white wash over all at the end of baking, just for shine and visual appeal. Anyone can make a great quiche with an excellent recipe, like this. My guests raved over this one.

This my first attempt at quiche and it was delicious!! I followed the recipe but lowered the temperature to 375 and cooked it for about one hour. It turned out fluffy and picture perfect. I've made it with bacon and cheese as well as with mushrooms and cheese. The only thing is if you use the mushrooms, saute them before putting them in the quiche and drain them so your quiche doesn't become mushy. Great recipe!!!

Rating: 4
I used the cream, 2% milk, onion, cheese, and apple smoked bacon and it was delish. A bit mushy inside so I may have cooked it longer at a lower temp - although I did lower it to 375 degrees already. A perfect quiche for all tastebuds.

My first effort at a quiche and it was far better than I had hoped! However, my husband harrassed me so much about all the artery-clogging potential of this dish, I was forced to "low fat" it. While I hate reading reviews where the dish was fantastic, "but I changed everything about it", please be assured I kept the original ingredients, but substituted a lower in fat version of each (definitely recommended). Whole milk was replaced by 99% fat free, heavy cream by lite cream and half the Emmental by low fat ricotta. I would highly suggest the ricotta, it makes for a very light and fluffy dish. The pastry turned out great, I'm glad I resisted the very great urge to buy a pre-baked one! We served with a lovely endive salad, great for an Australian summer evening! My Mum is going to ask for the recipe for sure!

This was great but I couldn't fit all the filling in one pie shell so I split it into two and then it browned a little too much on top. Other than that it's great. My 19 month old son ate an entire slice!

This was a great quiche recipe - we did cut back on some things - used more egg whites, light cream and skim milk. We used gruyere which was flavorful enough. I know this is unorthodox for classic French cooking, but it was less rich. We also did the onion version - cut the onions into thin curls and leave some loopy circles, place some on top before you back it and it looks nice too.

Rating: 4
Yum! This is the best quiche that I've ever made. I made the onion and cheese version, and used 2% milk. I started to use a "store bought" pastry, but am glad that I didn't. The basic pastry recipe is both easy to make and superb in taste. Next time, I'll make the quiche in exactly the same way.

Simple and delicious! I used the heavy cream that was recommended but substituted 2% for whole milk and the result was creamy and delicious. Next time I may substitute egg whites for 2 of the yolks to try and cut back on the cholesterol. This is an excellent recipe as is or it can be used as a base to add other ingredients.

I cooked it about 10 min longer than recommended, let it sit for about 20 min before serving it, and it was still mushy inside (raw eggs and cream - ick!!). After reading the other reviews, I guess I should have baked it twice as long as recommended......So, I will try it again because it had a delicious flavor (even though we couldn't eat it).

This was my first attempt at making a quiche. It turned out just brilliantly. The extra effort for making the crust is definitely worth it.

Rating: 4
What a great crust! I used 6 ounces of swiss, 8 strips of bacon, 10 ounces of well-drained chopped spinach, one jar of pimentos for color, and lots of nutmeg and cardomen as well as salt and pepper, with a sprinkling of Parmesean on top for color. Delicious. I wonder if brushing the crust with egg white for the last five minutes of cooking would improve it, and if leaving out one of the eggs would make it even more tender or if we need that egg to hold it together. I did not have any problem with the crust as did the cook below.

Rating: 3
don't bake the crust longer than 5 minutes to set it in the initial cooking phase or it turns black by the time the cooking process is complete.

I added spinich, red peppers, green onions and shallots. This is the best quiche I have ever made. Our musicians loved it, and they say that real men don't eat quiche. Yes, I will make it again using variations.

This is really a 3.5 (with 4 for spectacular...) -- a superb recipe and one I will use again many times. Because of the simplicity of the ingredients and preparation use top-quality ingredients (packaged crust? life is too short to waste on such mediocrity!) and you will not be disappointed. This quiche will reward you if you start with very fresh farmers' market eggs, fine gruyere, and your best crust recipe, made with the finest european butter you can get your hands on. And don't skip the fresh nutmeg! The cooking time was perfect for me, not a minute more or less. The result was an ideal quiche. It was amazingly light and delicious.

Rating: 3
Great receipe, however, even with a brand new oven it took 20 minutes longer to cook. Once I noticed the crust beginning to brown, I protected it with a foil ring. My brunch guests loved the dish and went back for seconds. It's a great basic recipe and I'll try other ingredients.

Absolutely delicious! I made the Bacon-Cheese variation, and besides a little too much browning, this was the perfect quiche! I served it to some ladies from church at our luncheon, and got many raves. It was gone before I knew it!

I used a Pillsbury frozen crust and it turned out fine. A word to the wise, though. My pie pans were all being used during the holidays, so I tried to make the quiche in a 6x9x2 baking dish. it was way too deep, and the middle of the quiche took too long to cook. I also agree that the heat should be turned down, as my top burned. My version used chopped-up canadian bacon, onions, and gruyere. Very tasty, and I'll try adding red bell peppers next time. One final word - better get on the treadmill after you get done eating this one!!

This was quiche? It was delicious! After reading the reviews I decided almost anything would work. I used 2 Marie Callender deep dish pie crusts, baked them slightly at 425 & reserved. I only had skim milk so I used 1 1/3 cups heavy cream and 1/3 cup skim milk. I placed 1/2 cup of diced Cumberland, Ky. ham in the bottom of each crust. To the custard I stirred in 8 oz of shredded swiss and divided among the two crusts topping with the ground nutmeg (NOT optional!). Lowered the oven to 375 and baked for 40 minutes. Since this makes 16 slices this way I didn't feel quilty about eating 3!

Rating: 3
Tasty and easy, however, the recipe suggests baking the quiche at 425 which is WAY too high. I burned the crust and the top of the quiche at this temperature. Would lower to around 375 next time. I filled it with leeks and swiss chard, instead of just onions. To die for!

This is the best quiche I've ever made or eaten!! I'm planning a brunch this month and wanted to test this quiche on my family before serving it to guests. I made the onion version and it was fantastic. The basic pastry recipe recommended in this recipe is a must--very flakey and buttery!! I can't wait to serve this to my guests!!

This was absolutely delicious, and much easier than I expected. To save time, I used a ready-made (Pillsbury) crust, which worked just fine. I made the variation with gruyere cheese and ham, and my finisky fiancee eats 2 or three slices at a sitting. This only lasts a day or so in my house before it's all gone! Also reheats well, even in the microwave.

This was my second attempt with pastry dough (the first was a complete failure). I followed the recipe precisely (with the exception of cutting back on the butter to 6-1/2 T vs. 8). The dough was perfect and the quiche was delicious. For the filling I used whatever I already had in the fridge without a problem. Ingredients were 4 eggs, 1 c. half and half, 5 slices bacon, 1 pkg. shredded monterey jack, onions and mushrooms (sauted first). I highly recommend this recipe.

This turned out well. I made the crust twice, as the first trial seemed to need more flour with all that butter involved. So I add another 1/4 cup of flour. The filling is very rich-too much cheese if you are adding more ingredients. Otherwise this was quite easy to make and it turned out golden and rich.

Finally! A recipe for quiche that tastes like a creation, not a quick custard with added cheese. Like another reviewer, I added the bacon and onions. For garnish, I snipped some fresh chives from my garden and propped them in the middle of the pie after it was baked and cooled. Everyone wanted the recipe.

The real secret to this recipe is the crust. Use the pastry weights and chill the dough. Wow! I am so proud to have conquered pie crust! I will never buy store-bought again. The quiche itself is remarkably cellulite inducing and delicious. I'll think I'll just wear pants.
