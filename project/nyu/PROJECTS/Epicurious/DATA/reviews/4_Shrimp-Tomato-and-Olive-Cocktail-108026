I've made this recipe a number of times and it's ALWAYS a hit! I add mango and avocado and I slice the olives. I've served this as a cocktail mixture but I've also served it as a dip with Tostitos Scoops and my favorite is to use it as the filling for soft tacos, which I top with cheese and sour cream. Absolutely wonderful! Highly recommend!

Wow! Delicious exactly as written (I sliced the olives, though). No avocado needed. I was worried about all the raw onion being too sharp, but the lime mellowed it. A keeper.

Served in martini glasses, this is a perfect start to a summer outdoor menu. The lime and cilantro make the dish taste like an authentic Peruvian-like ceviche presentation, delicious!

Wonderful flavors and nice presentation. This would be ideal on a hot summer day with white wine and a loaf of crusty bread.

I've made this dish countless times and it's always a hit. Bright fresh flavors. Great as an appetizer or spooned over a salad. There is enough marinade that you can use a 2 lb bag of Costco shrimp and not change the proportions.

served this for a family bbq and everyone loved this! I think I will be making this many more times. My sister gives 31/2 forks simply because of the cilantro !and needed more avocado!

A wonderful recipe that you will make again and again. We do have incredible shrimp out East but a recipe like this brings out the best!

This was awesome. My pepper was very hot, should have used a little less. Otherwise, everyone loved this. Served Christmas Eve as an appetizer before standing rib roast. Will definatley make again. Served in tall wine glasses with lime garnish...a show stoper in presentation and flavor!

This is a great, easy, tasty, impressive dish. We add mango and used already cooked prawns. This was a huge hit on a camping trip this summer served in plastic drinking cups.

Fabulous!! Very mexican. I made it for friends that came over for dinner. we all raved and they asked for the recipe. I used jumbo shrimp because that's what I had on hand. After it was spooned into martini glasses I threw some cubes of avacado on top and served it with coctail forks. It wasn't alot of trouble to make, either. It's-a-keeper!

Refreshing! I served this a long side a tortilla tort. I added avocado just before serving. (I scooped the avocado into melon ball shapes. I layered the tomatoes, avocado and cilantro and shrimp mixture into chilled shrimp cocktail dishes and voila! Delicious and looks lovely, too.

Made this for a small dinner party and it was a huge hit!! I cut the shrimp into small pieces and sauted the garlic with the shrimp. I served it in one of those large martini glasses with tortilla strips where guests could "scoop out" the ceviche. Might add chopped avocado next time. Will definately make it again!!

I made this for a Fourth of July party. I was going with a Tex-Mex theme to the food. My guests absolutely loved it. I made it exactly as written...and made sure I didn't put the tomatoes in too early. It is definitely a keeper

Just tried this using fresh key lime juice out of bottle and frozen shrimp -- it worked well and everyone loved it. Definite repeater!

I made this dish a little less "spicy" by sauteeing the onions before adding them to the dish. Quite delicious!

I made this for my husband's birthday party and served it in martini glasses as the recipe suggests. The only alteration I made was to use a very small amount of a dried habenero chile which gave the recipe a great kick. Everyone loved it! Will keep this for another occassion.

I made this for my husband's birthday party and served it in martini glasses just like it suggests but substituted a dry habenero to the seasoning to give it a very slight kick. It was SOOOO good! Everyone raved. Definitely keep for a great presentation and taste.

This appetizer is fantastic. I made it for my boyfriend's parents and they loved it. I gave his mom the recipe and she has since made it for dinner guests. Usually I make alterations to recipes, but this one is perfect just the way it is. YUMMY.

This is a great recipe for those on the Atkins or South Beach diets. It's easy to make and has a great mix of flavors. I served it at a dinner party with friends and everyone loved it. I did toss in a diced avocado, which I thought really added an extra flavor touch. I had a small bit leftover that I couldn't bear to toss, but was worried since the recipe said to serve within two hours. This dish held up nicely the next day and was just as delicious.

As a Mexican who has tried many ceviches this one was not only delicious but easy to make. I sauteed the minced garlic with the shrimp which gave the shrimp a great flavor. Also added avocado slices just before serving. Husband loved it and loved me more for making it for him.

I made this for a couple that do catering and they have started making it for their events. It's an amazing dish. I suggest chopping the shrimp in half to make it easier to eat. Serving in a martini glass was a huge hit!

Very different from other Mexican shrimp cocktails I've had, but lovely. My limes weren't very juicy, giving only half the required juice, so I supplemented with lemon juice. The lime zest added a delicious flavor. Couldn't get good plum tomatoes, so used quartered grape tomatoes, with great results. Not all that spicy with only one serrano chile. Will use more next time. A diced avocado stirred in just before serving was a delicious variation, but not essential.

Made this for a special birthday dinner and though eveything was really good, this was the hands-down favorite item. Making it again next weekend for another birthday dinner. Use martini glasses. It just makes the presentation more sassy!

Delightful and fresh. Everyone asked for this recipe and I will make this treat for all our summer guests.

I made this as an appetizer for a Latin-themed Christmas Eve dinner this year. It was a tremendous hit!! I will be making it again for a New Year's Eve party.

I loved this dish. It was just light enough, but full of flavor! I did chop the shrimp, though, because it was too chunky. Serve it with tortilla chips for a great mex flavor at your next get together.

I'd actually give it 3.9 forks!! The men made this appetizer last night and served it in martini glasses to the ladies. A huge hit among big time food lovers!

Had I followed directions this might have been better. I used large shrimp and the lime marinade did not fully penetrate and flavor them. I served this as a main course salad, with tortillas, and it was not substantial enough for my family. I will try again with medium shrimp, as a starter or side salad.

I made this for a party, and have not been left alone about it since. Beware, if you make this recipe for your friends, you may find yourself making it again...and again...and again...

This is outstanding! Made some changes though - used jalapeno's instead of serranos, red onion instead of white, and added avocado. Just a wonderful summertime dish to go with a frosty Margarita.

Delicious. Beautiful presentation.

I cut the recipe in half and made it for a special anniversary dinner for my husband and me, along with Margaritas. We loved it. I made the full recipe a second time and served as the main course for two with guacamole and chips on the side. Instead of pimento olives from the jar, I purchased olives stuffed with sun dried tomatoes from the gourmet olive section at my grocer's deli. It is a great summer dish whether as an appetizer or main dish.

After seeing the picture, I insisted that we make this for my mother's 70th birthday party. My fellow-foodie brother wanted something more dramatic, but conceded. I was right. This was beyond fabulous; we were licking out martini glasses. It's in the "Too Busy to Cook" section, which is a laugh, when making for 8; lots of prep. We also added avocado. We repeated for our anniversary and just made 2 with 10 shrimp, which felt much simpler. This is the perfect ceviche in my book.

Delish! I added some chili sauce and avacado - the fam loved it.
