Great combination of flavors. Do take the time to prepare the sauce ahead of time. It actually needs to cook longer to reduce and thicken.

I tried this with thick, juicy pork chops and it was fantastic! I made half the amount of sauce, and pan-fried the chops in a cast iron pan. I finished them in the oven topped with the garlic and fresh thyme. I sliced up the pork chops and served them topped with the plums and sauce. Yummy!

Afraid my plums may have sabotaged me. I think they are satsumas (red fleshed)and their skins are just too bitter. Should have peeled them, I guess. Also, my star anise might be too old- although they smell great. Yielded little flavor. Am tempted to finish the sauce with some butter to see if it can be saved.

The pork loin was good, but I found the plums to be disgusting; however, i did enjoy the sauce.

Yum. Personally, I think the sauce needed to be thickened slightly before adding the plums and serving. As it stands, the sauce is quite runny, and mixes with other flavours on the plate . . . okay if you plan for it . . . I actually soaked my plums in the alcohol for 24 hours before poaching and it was still fine. Quite yummy.

OK. So I did a different version of this pork using my slow cooker. I made the sauce as written, but didn't strain or reduce. Took 1/2 the mixture and put it in the cooker with my pork. Cooked it on low overnight. In the morning I took the pork out and dumped the juice/sauce. I then strained and reduced the other 1/2 of the sauce, pulled the pork, and put them back in the slow cooker for an hour to fuse. The results were fabulous! Even my kids loved it! And... so easy. Enjoy!

I have made this twice now and both times it has been very good. The sauce is a nice complement, but the pork is delicious without it.

Simply amazing! Easily one of the best meals I've ever had. Restaurant quality!

Amazing recipe! The star anise added such an interesting component to the sauce flavor - great combination of savory with just a bit of sweet. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. My husband declared it "holiday worthy"!

I made just half of this recipe for three of us. That was a mistake. It was so good that I think we could have eaten the whole amount. Served with Rosemary Roasted Yams and a green veggie. Really good meal !

A great recipe. The sweetness and richness of the prunes works excellently with the pork. I made a few amendments stricly based on the lack of certain ingredients at the time of cooking the meal. I used a Pinot Blanc instead of the Pinot Gris and combined the thyme with some tarragon which paired nicely. I also only had regular anise to work with, although I believe it would worked better with star anise. All in all it was a great recipe. I will definitely make this dish again

I made this together with the cornbread stuffing and the combination was great. I added sage to both recipes and couldn't find star anise in time to make it. Besides adding sage, the only other change I made was to use Port wine instead of red wine, and I think it gave it a great flavor. It was a very easy recipe and delicious!

This was really delicious. The poached plums were fantastic, beautiful color. I also only strained the sauce at the end. Easy to make.

This was very tasty and easy to do, though the sauce does take a little time to do. The pork was very tender and moist. Only strained the sauce once at the end. A keeper!

The sauce and poached plums were far superior to the pork, which just served as something to put the sauce on. Regarding the sauce, only strain it once at the end so as to allow more flavor to brew.

I grilled the pork instead of roasting. This was a wonderful meal paired with a Santa Barbara County pinot noir.

This was delicious. I usually don't like when people write about all the substitutions they made, but we used a California Sauvignon Blanc for the white and were a bit short on the broth--other than that, it was the same. I mention it only because when we reduced to the 1 cup level, it was a bit thin and lacking. Once we continued reducing, it got syrupy and was so yummy. Be patient, and it will be worth it!
