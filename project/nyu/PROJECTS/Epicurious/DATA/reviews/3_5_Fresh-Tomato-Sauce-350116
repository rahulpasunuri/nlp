Spoiler alert: This is one of those reviews where I tell you all the changes I made, but bear in mind they were mostly out of necessity... This was really delicious and easy to make. If you've never deal with peeling tomatoes before, I'd suggest blanching them before peeling. I didn't have any dried basil or rosemary, so I substituted 1.5tsp dried oregano for both spices. My kids don't like chunky sauce, so I blended the sauce. Also, I crushed a garlic clove and cooked it in a tablespoon of olive oil and then stirred that into the sauce. Great solution to my abundance of plum tomatoes.
