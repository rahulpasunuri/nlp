Yum! I love the texture of these brownies!! The inside is a gooey delight! This is an easy recipe, will make again for sure.

These brownies were delish! They have deep undertone flavors of chocolate..and I even forgot to put in the mocha. I toasted some walnuts, chopped them up and threw them into the batter. These brownies turned out absolutely divine! However, since they had a crispy shell on top, it was difficult to present them neatly for company..so I may hesitate to make them for guests. But that means...more brownies for ME time!

This is my ultimate, never-fail or let-me-down brownie recipe. It's amazingly good, but not for the faint of heart. It's incredibly rich & decadent & worth every calorie. I even omit the espresso powder & it's just as good, promise!!

I, too had the 'crust', but it didn't bother me. Recipe was good, just not great. Cut the recipe in 1/2 successfully.

Heather Ho was the pastry chef at Windows on the World in the WTC and was killed on Sept 11 2001. She was talented and a fine person, and finding this record of her life and accomplishments was sad and sweet. Think of peace on earth when you make these brownies. Thank you Heather.

Wonderful brownies! The crunchy shell was a bit messy, but that won't deter me from making them again. I went to the site looking for a moist brownie. I brought them to church and received compliments on the pudding-like texure. The only problem was there weren't enough to go around.

This recipe is delish! Everybody loves it and raves about it. I usually omit the espresso powder and it turns out terrific, perfect for any chocolate lover. Get your glass of milk ready, you'll need it.

I baked this at 350 for 30-35 minutes and it turned out fine.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I was making these brownies as a gift, but was unable to give them because when I tried to slice them the "shell" on top just crumbled revealing a gooey mess underneath. I am an experienced baker and have never had a recipe turn out so badly.

I found this recipe real easy to make, my 6 year old son loves to cook and enjoyed helping. I made it for a church social event and hope it will be a great success.My only complaint was it didn't have a strong espresso taste to it (which I would have prefered). So I guess I will have to experement with it a little for isn't that the fun of baking?

I have yet to try this recipe, however the comments about smoking in the oven were curious to me. I think the recipe author uses "waxed" paper as opposed to "wax" paper, which would definitely not be great in the oven because of the amount of wax. Instead of waxed paper, use parchment paper.

i made this for treats at work. It went over well and even had one of our male workers ask for the receipe. The oven did smoke. The taste is excellent and will definately be making them again

Not only did I get the shell, but the brownies would not come off the wax paper. I used a nonstick pan and sprayed it as the instructions directed, but should have just stopped there, I think they would have comeo out without the wax paper. But the hard flaky shell was disappointing. I have better brownie recipes.

It tasted really good, and I don't really enjoy something that has coffe in it.

I, too, used a glass baking dish. My problem was the wax paper--it got kind of burnt and caused some smoke, and I guess was responsible for the bottom corners to be burnt. Overall, the taste was OK, but my brownies looked nothing like the photo!

I, too, got the "shell" on top of these brownies. Compared to the older recipe for Mocha Brownies, these have much less coffee and are less obviously Mocha. I prefer the others.

I love brownies and thought these were some of the best I have ever had! The hint of mocha was a nice change from usual brownies. I didn't add nuts and I baked them in a glass dish with non-stick cooking spray and they came out perfect.

Good, but not the best. Probably wouldn't recommend them if asked about brownie recipes. Mine developed the "shell" on top as well.

This brownies were really great. I think I did something wrong because they developed a hard shell on the top while baking. Still tasty, but I prefer them without the shell. Any ideas why that happened?

One of the very best brownie recipes I have ever had! They are so moist and everyone raved.

Very good and moist brownie with the sour cream being an intriguing addition. I would double the espresso powder since the mocha flavor is too subtle for us, and also double the sour cream just because I like it!!! Would probably cover the brownie with foil near the end since we end up with more black side crust and top crust than we'd like.

Not the best brownie I've ever had but very good.

Maybe the best brownies I've ever had. The mocha taste is very subtle. The texture was very creamy and decadent.
