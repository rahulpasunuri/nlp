We loved these. Our guests devoured them. The recipe is very forgiving (I didn't follow all the instructions accurately and they still came out great). I made them up a few days in advance of the event and kept them in an airtight container. They remained crisp and delicious.

These were a big hit with all my guests! Would definately make again.
