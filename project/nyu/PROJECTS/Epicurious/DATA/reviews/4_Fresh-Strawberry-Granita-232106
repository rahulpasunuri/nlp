This recipe was delicious, I used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was plenty. I will probably try 1/3 cup next time to make it even healthier. This is a truly delicious and healthy dessert. It is a great way to use up old strawberries :)

Excellent granita - perfect on a hot summer day. I used 1/2 cup of sugar, grated zest and juice of 1 medium/large lemon. It's tart, but very refreshing.

I added 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom for a little kick. Delicious!

An amazingly easy recipe to which I am now addicted. I used strawberries that were on their way out - they looked terrible and were overripe. This recipe saved them! I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, added the zest of one lemon to the strawberry puree, and was generous with the lemon juice. The result was not the least bit tart, nor too sweet, but had an amazing strawberry-lemon flavor I can't get enough of.

Really yummy. Next time I can probably do with less sugar for a healthier snack.

A fresh and delicious dessert that's so easy to make! I used Splenda instead of sugar to make it diabetic-friendly, and I only used 1/2 cup - next time I would reduce it to 1/3 cup to let the fruit shine a little more. I also added an extra tablespoon of lemon. Goes well with a glass of Francis Coppola chardonnay, but I would also try pouring vodka overtop and serving as a cocktail.

I used a mix of berries (strawberries, blackberries and blueberries) and added the zest and flesh of one orange and a tablespoon of good balsamic vinegar. Delicious.

very good and easy. I actually forgot about it after I put it in the freezer and didn't stir it until about 2 hours later. It still turned out fine. I served in in drinking glasses over a scoop of vanilla ice cream and with a butter cookie on the rim.

what a great way to use fresh fruit! we had a ton of fresh strawberries from the farmer's market - more than we would have been able to eat before they spoiled. this is a wonderful, refreshing, easy treat! based on previous reviewers, i reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 and it was perfect!

It was great- the mint infused syrup was wonderful. Next time, I would use maybe 2/3 the amount of mascarpone to make it a little less creamy and a little more sorbet like.

Delicious! A little less sugar would probably be just fine. Tons of flavor. Everyone loved it!

Delicious and easy. I dissolved the sugar and water on stove. Maybe a little less sugar for others though I like mine sweet.

A wonderful, light dessert! I made it for dessert after lasagna-perfectly sweet and not too heavy after a meal like that. I actually chilled martini glasses and drizzled chilled vodka over the top with the lemon curl as a garnish, also very good! I also used frozen strawberries and they still tasted wonderful!
