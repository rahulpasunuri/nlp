My favorite way to use fresh corn. I have been making this since I 1st saw the recipe 4 years ago. Just follow the recipe, and only use Fresh corn, right off the cobb, don't even entertain using frozen. I may try it with the shrimp, that another reviewer mentioned.

This is very tasty, solid side dish. I added two small chili peppers, and the dish came out perfectly spicy. Would definitely make this again.

I made a recipe for 2 and it was skimpy and think the recipe would be best serving 4. I used frozen corn and I think that fresh would be better. All in all I didn't think this was a great recipe.

I think fresh corn is really key in this recipe. Made exactly as printed and served with spicy fish tacos. My family loved it.

I used fresh corn on the cob which I caramelized on a charcoal grill first rather than in the pan. I just husked them, lightly oiled them, then threw them on the grill earlier in the day when I was grilling something for lunch anyway. Then I let them cool, and cut the corn from the cobs. A little bit before I was ready to serve, I softened the onion and peppers in the pan per the recipe. Then just put the grilled corn in to heat through. My plan is to grill up a bit of corn while it's still in season, cut it from the cob and freeze it. That way I can get the nice smokey grilled flavor to the corn even when its not corn on the cob season.

I used frozen corn and cooked it for a long time until it was really browned because I really like the flavor of roasted corn on the cob. I was disappointed that this recipe didn't have that flavor I expected. My husband said 'never again' and I have to agree.

This was a different spin on corn, but nothing to write home about. We liked it but really nothing all that special. I will make it again if we are really craving corn.

I've made this both as written, and also with marinated shrimp that I added towards the end of cooking. With or without, this is by far one of my favorite ways to cook corn, and a welcome treat from the usual boiled corn on the cob.

Would like to try it next time with fresh corn (v. frozen). The carmelized corn wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be. Although I thought it was just okay, my husband and son really enjoyed it.

Nice and sweet. Used the correct amount of corn, but I'm a little bit more liberal with the onion, garlic, pepper, and cilantro. When serving I added a spritz of lime juice, a bit of chopped avocado, and a dab of sour cream.

Added cooked asparagus. It was quite good.

Very nice corn dish. The caramalizing process made it smell so good.

This is a favorite, and it received rave reviews this week at Thanksgiving dinner. Like others here, I've increased the chili powder. Don't be afraid to let the corn brown a bit; it's the carmelized/roasted flavor that really makes this sing.

What a wonderful summer dish! I happened to have lots of fresh corn, and was tired of boiling it, I am so glad I found this recipe.Eating it felt like I was at a great restaurant!

I usually like my summer corn just plain with lots of butter and salt, but I'll make an exception for this dish. It was really good. I roasted and skinned the peppers. It was a great combination of flavors which did not mask the sweetness of the corn.

A delicious, festive dish that received raves last night. I'll be making it all summer long!

Very tasty and easy to make. I will double the chili pepper the next time I make it, since I couldn't even tell it was in the recipe.

I fixed this last night. Agree with other reviewers. Also no wonder that all of us previous reviewers used frozen corn with it being winter yet. :) Next time I would add more garlic. I left out the cilantro due to out of time.

I agree. this was a surprisingly delicious recipe. The frozen corn was fine and the cilantro added a nice flavor (even though I normally hate it!).

This was really good. I also used frozen corn. I was hesitant about using the cilantro since it's not one of my favorites. I'm so glad I used it. It really complemented everything. I halved the chili powder,(child in the house), but you couldn't really taste it so I would use it all next time.
