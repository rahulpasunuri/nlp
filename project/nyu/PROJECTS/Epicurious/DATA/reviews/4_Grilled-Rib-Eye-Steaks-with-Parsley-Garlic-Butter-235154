Excellent addition to any steak. I used white wine instead of cognac.

Excellent recipe; the butter is fabulous on the steak, and the leftover butter is phenomenal with steamed broccoli, grilled chicken, and probably just about anything! Try this recipe!

Used a good quality rib-eye and everyone in our group of five went on and on about the addition of the parsley-garlic butter. Added a wonderful flavor. We also spread the same butter on corn on the cob and it was perfect for that as well.

We had a large BBQ last night and served a combination of filet mignon and rib-eyes and used the butter on both. Even the purists (and dieters) couldn't resist!

Simple and delightful. I paired with the suggested Kanonkop Pinotage and it was a hit at a dinner party I threw recently. The smoky flavor paired very well with the parsley-garlic butter.

Didn't have cognac, used white wine instead, but this came out great! The flavored butter tastes fresh and clean, and didn't overpower the flavor of the steak. My fiancee, who is a true red meat addict, loved this!

This recipe is a great way to make use of an expensive cut of meat. Medium-rare is definitely the way to go. Made more butter-herb mixture and used it for baked chicken. Delicious!

Whatever kind of steak you serve, this butter is going to make it 1000% better. Delish! Make extra to freeze it for later.

We made this for father's day and it was a perfect steak and potatoes meal. The butter was delicious and I loved the element the cognac added. Made it for four people and we wound up with way too much butter, but it would be great used again.

Excellent dish, and I have never cooked a steak much more ordered one at a restaurant! I have definitely been converted.

I loved this tonight. Everybody loved this! I have never been to Ruth Chris Steakhouse, but two of the guests tonight said this was very similiar to what they have had there. One small note-I was cooking on a TEK grill that is able to get to 1500 degrees or so. This is so simple and such a great touch to a great dinner. We did use Filet Mignon. I would recommend this to all who are considering trying it. Wow!

Because I'm vegetarian, I didn't eat this myself, but made it for guests, and they loved it. Very easy and quick - I used flank steak instead of rib-eye.

This was a very good dish. I don't think I added enough garlic to the butter mixture though (I really love garlic). Also, I think next time I will try basil instead of parsley or some other aromatic herb.

This was very tasty right off the grill. Even the kids enjoyed the rich butter taste. I substituted shallots for green onions and wished I had sauted them a bit. Elegant and simple. Used the butter for steamed broccoli, yum.

My family and guests just raved about this meal. Served with grilled baby potatoes (also found on epicurious) and buttered green beans. Very simple meal, but delicious...perfect for a quick company meal! Rib-eye steaks are always a special treat and the parsley-garlic butter makes them extra-special and also tastes great on the potatoes.

Haven't made this, but the photo I'm looking at looks like a ribeye or maybe a strip steak, definitely not a porterhouse. A porterhouse looks like a t-bone w/ extra meat on it. Can't wait to try this recipe!

This recipe sounds delicious and I plan to prepare it...but I am a little confused with the photo accompanying the recipe. That cut of meat doesn't resemble the ribeye steaks I see in my markets. It looks more like a porterhouse. Does the term "ribeye" cover a variety of cuts? Can someone please educate me?

The parsley-garlic butter for this recipe is delicious. My daughter-in-law suggested that I use some of the leftover butter on the new baby potatoes I was serving with the steak and it was delicious on them as well. A definite keeper.

Excellent dish. The parsley butter was extremely tasty... you can also use it to make a nice garlic bread. I loved the rib eyes, but next time would use sirloin or a filet to cut down on fat.

Deeeee licioussss! This recipe really made up for a bad day at work. My parents came over and oo they lovedddd it!

Simple and delicious! I was glad the main course was wonderful to compensate for the berry layer cake (from the same issue) which was really disappointing! For this one, I substituted thick top sirloins, and everyone at the party had seconds!
