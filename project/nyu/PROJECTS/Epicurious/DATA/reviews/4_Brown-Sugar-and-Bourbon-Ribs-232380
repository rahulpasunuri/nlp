One of the best rib recipes ever! Juicy, fall off the bone ribs with a change from the usual barbeque sauce. I'm making them again.

Not a big griller (or a cook), and never made ribs before. I followed this recipe and changed the oven temp/ time per the review suggestions. And BAM! Was delish!! Definately going to make again.

Absolutely fantastic. We didn't follow the recipe exactly, and had to use Jack Daniels whiskey instead of bourbon, but the ribs came out great. Can't wait to do a variation on my BGE.

The first time I made this recipe, I didn't have bourbon so I substituted with rum. It was great, so I was looking forward to making it even better with Bourbon. Well, it was good, but not as good as the rum. So third time's the charm. I turned the oven down to 275, baked them for 3 hours, and then used rum instead of bourbon. And I'll never go back. The rum in the sauce is amazing, and this is an amazing recipe!

I've been making these several times a year since 2005. My family,a large crowd, demands them on the 4th. My only tweak is to really get the ribs where they fall off the bone is to cook 2 1/2 to 2 hours and 45 mins.

Love the sauce! This was the first time I ever made ribs and they tasted great! Will be making them again.

As with many other reviewers, I substituted apple sauce for the apple butter and apple juice for the cider. Spare ribs worked perfectly with this recipe and the last minute scorch on the grill gave a smoky, crackly crust and toasted up the remaining fat on the racks. No sauce needed for these; the tender, juicy meat fell off the bones and the zip of mustard and ginger in the glaze was a great counterpoint to the apple flavor that penetrated the meat during it's time in the oven. This recipe is also great for feeding a crowd, as you only need a few minutes of work at the grill rather than spending several hours monitoring the heat.

Came out really good with a couple of tweaks. Couldn't find apple butter so I used cinnamon honey butter instead. Also couldn't find apple cider so I used apple juice and a tiny bit of OJ. Instead of bourbon, I used half Jack Daniels green label and half Jack Daniels Honey. Reduced temp to 275 and cooked for 3 hours.

I made this a second time and let me say that the meat was perfect. It fell right off the bone, in fact i just used a fork to eat it. the trick is to be sure that you tightly cover the pan when you cook in the oven, the key is to steam the ribs. when i made it the first time i don't think the foil was sealed well.

I discovered this recipe when it first came out and have been using it almost exclusively ever since. In the past 5 years or so, I've tweaked the amount of cayenne to cut the sweetness of the basting sauce, but have kept everything else the same. Always a favorite.

Rating: 3
i didn't have apple cider so i used white wine and honey instead. the flavors were excellent and recommend it. my only issue was the meat seemed a tad dry even on a slow cook. next time i do this i will probably cook at 250F for 3-4 hours.

I only used the rub from this recipe, but it was outstanding. Paired it with the Bourbon and Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce recipe here on epicurious, and put it on ribs. Highly recommend.

Really really tasty. Everyone loved them. Wasn't crazing about the basting sauce, didn't serve it on the side ater the ribs were cooked. But I did use the basting sauce when grilling. Some of the best ribs!!!!

I made this twice and the last time for 20 people- and it was a smashing hit- I didn't think it was too sweet w/the brown sugar...couldn't find apple cider, so just used apple juice (w/o HFCS), so perhaps that helped. Very delicious, be sure to use a good whiskey ,or otherwise you will lack flavor. I have to say, it was quite a bit of work for 20 people- but worth it in the end- the rub was perfect...

I thought these ribs were delicious and easy. I didn't use any brown sugar in the glaze after other reviewers commented that it was too sweet. I found it to be just fine without it.

This was too sweet for me. A hot spicy taste would be my choice. I!m surprised so many gave this a high rating. Must admit we ate all of it.

Rating: 2
I would give this a 2 1/2 Forks if possible. The ribs are good, very tender, and moist but IMHO lacked flavor. The basting sauce didn't 'glaze' and didn't do a lot for the result. Adding BBQ sauce would have made an odd flavor. The recipe is simple to prepare but there are better ones out there.

Soooooo good...I will definitely make these again. I used orange juice instead of apple cider since that is what I had, and it was delicious. Try these; you will not be disappointed!

Made this last night for a group of friends. Got rave reviews from everyone Must have done something wrong with the basting sauce as it never turned into a "glaze" but the results were still great. This recipe is a keeper!

Fabulous. I made this while on vacation. I made up the rub at home and sealed it in a plastic bag. Then pulled it out to apply to ribs at vacation spot--didn't have to buy all the separate ingredients. It was ready-to-go. Substituted orange juice for apple cider because I didn't have the latter. Used bottled BBQ sauce and added bourbon. Baked in the oven at 325 as indicated and finished off on the barbeque. Rave reviews.

Made this with boneless pork ribs and we really liked it. I cooked the ribs in the oven for hour and a half and then placed the ribs on the bbq:)I will put this in keep file.(used less ground thyme and dry mustard)

Our company said these were the best ribs they had ever eaten. My husband and I agree! So much fun preparing them! Basting sauce could be a new kind of drink! DELICIOUS!

This is by far my husband's favorite dish...I've made it several times and it's always a hit. I rub the ribs and let them marinate for at least a day...then I slowly BBQ them on low, continually basting with the sauce. I skip the baking step and go straight for the grill. They are delicious, finger-lickin' good ribs!

This by far has been the best rib recipe ever! I finish them off in the broiler if I'm not up to BBQ-ing.

I followed the directions to the letter, and they were a huge Father's Day hit. I tripled the sauce recipe and cooked the remaining sauce to burn off a little of the bourbon. It lasted for a couple of months in the fridge, too. I did have to make some extra dry-rub, though.

The BEST rib recipe ever! It's become our "favorite 4th" recipe!

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe and I've made it many times. I buy the baby back ribs, 3- pack, at Costco. I use a bottled BBQ sauce, Famous Dave's, and add some bourbon. Here's a time- saving tip: Rip the membrane from the ribs by loosening one end and grabbing the loose end in a pair of pliers. It works like a charm, just remember to thoroughly clean and santize after use.

Rating: 4
Awesome ribs. Made some adjustments: had regular "long end" pork ribs vs. baby back; used fresh thyme instead of dry (didn't have any) and ended up having to shave pieces of ginger vs. rounds. Cooked 2 hours and were falling off the bone. Ran out of time and so used some BBQ sauce we had on-hand (Jack Stack Original). Next time, will be certain to make the glaze in the recipe.

Rating: 4
I just made these for a group of friends and they got RAVE reviews. I made the following small adjustments: -I used apple juice instead of cider -I omitted the fresh ginger from the roasting pans because I didn't have any. I added some powdered ginger to compensate. -I tripled the recipe and used half pork loin ribs and half baby back (as called for). Oh my god, the apple-flavor in the sauce is delicious and they were so tender that two racks fell apart when I was turning them on the grill. Eating them also proved a delicious challenge because the bones just FELL OUT, they were so tender. A definite keeper.

These ribs were incredible. My boyfriend bought 2 racks of ribs (we used pork) and assumed that there would be leftovers. Unfortunately, we ate ALL of it. My only complaint is that the ribs were very sweet. Next time I might cut back on the sugar or add a bit of tomato to the sauce. I'll definitely be making these ribs for my family.

Changed nothing. Used an inexpensive porc rib. Guests licked their chops and asked for more.

This is keeper..The glaze is successfully understated, which compliments the dry- rub. Very easy, and a great finished product!

Really, really good. I used apple sauce, because I couldn't find apple butter. The sauce was plenty sweet as is, so I think I'll make again with this 1 modification. I also used brandy, instead of bourbon, because it was the only spirit I had in the house, and I was too lazy to go shopping. I will try whiskey next time, but probably not bourbon.

Excellent flavor with the dry rub on the meat. So tasty! I suggest adding cayenne pepper to the sauce to give it a little bite. This is a really great recipe.

Rating: 4
We had them for a pre-4th of July BBQ, and absolutley loved them. I changed the recipe a bit. First, there is no bourbon to be found in my town, so I just added more apple cider and cider vinegar. And the point to bbq is not to heat up the house in 110 degree weather so I cooked the ribs in the crock pot on low for 6-7 hours. They grilled up perfectly with the meat just falling of the bone. I didn't take the membrane off and still the meat was very tender. We ate them along side a rack of store bought ribs. These were much more tender and had much better flavor. Not your classic rib flavor, but just so finger licking good. We served them with grilled cantaloupe and all were heaven. I will definitely make them again.

These ribs are phenomenal! Sweet and flavorful. My father-in-law raved about them, and he's a tough one to please (especially when I am doing the cooking!). I didn't have a cinnamon stick on hand, so I just omitted it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe faithfully. I'll definitely make these again!

I've been looking for a more "southern" rib recipe (i.e., no tomatoes involved!), and this was it. Scored rave reviews at our last cookout.

Rating: 4
My family LOVES this ribs recipe. Removing the membrane is a great tip and makes the rib-eating experience easier and more enjoyable. Especially for my kids. The flavors are a little unique but they WORK!! The only thing I have ever tweaked is adding more liquid to the pan when I roast the ribs in the oven. I have dumped a beer in there when I have run out of other appropriate basting materials. I've also ommitted the apple butter because I didn't have any on hand and dumped in one of my kid's applesauces. It still works!

Rating: 4
I've made this dish several times. I didn't use the bourbon or apple butter. The cinnamon with pork is wonderful. My mom and young one really enjoyed them because they were so tender. The last time I made them, my oldest son and one of his friends said that they were "the truth". That's a compliment coming from them.

This was the first time I've ever made ribs, and it was soooooo good! In fact, my sister has special-requested I make them for her birthday barbecue. This one is a true "keeper"!

The recipe was not that good. And the cinnamin is horrid. I did a few switches. Made a double batch, use the first as a marinade, then took the second and added ketchup to make a sauce. Basted with that and put some on the side for use at dinner. It was fantastic then. I also used it to marinade and then sauce chicken. WOW!!! As is though, it was just ok.

Very tender and good.

I've made this dish twice now, the first time following the recipe exactly and the second time with a few changes. My family didn't like the cinnamon flavor on both the rub and roasting over cinnamon sticks gave, so I omitted. Second, I didn't have apple cider, so I substituted beef broth the second time around. Third, I didn't feel like making the basting sauce, so I just used BBQ sauce right out of the bottle and it worked great. I would definitely make again and wouldn't hesitate to use store-bought BBQ sauce again if I was pressed for time. Enjoy-finger-licking good!!!

These are awesome ribs! Not your traditional ribs with bbq sauce, but a delicious applely brown sugar glaze. The ribs absolutely melt off the bone. I let mine sit in the oven for 2 hours after the 2 hours of cooking at 325. Perfect.

My husband loves ribs but we never make them at home b/c he is usually dissapointed with the results -- not this time! These were tender, and a very unique taste and easy to prepare the day before and pop in the oven. Just make sure to score/remove as much of the membrane as suggested -- they will then fall right off the bone!

Rating: 1
The rub has too much thyme which didn't seem to go well with ribs & not enough other flavors. The sauce has too much vinagar taste, and yet is overly sweet at the same time. Very dissappointing taste - pretty bland. Off the shelf BBQ sauces & rubs are better than this recipe.

My son has requested this for his Birthday dinner from now on. Very good flavor and texture.

Superb -- we love it! Normally I will want to change a few things in a recipe. This recipe, however, is perfect as-is. I made it twice, the second time for a large pot luck dinner and folks tracked me down for the recipe. It is an especially flavorful alternative to tomoato based BBQ sauce for ribs.

Finding pork ribs and apple butter at the supermarkets in Athens, Greece has been a challenge. I make the apple butter from scratch and special order the ribs. WHY? Because this is a great recipe! My guests do lick their fingers!! Thanks a lot!

Rating: 3
Have to say I cheated a bit... I just made the dry rub and used some BBQ sauce I already made for another recipe. The dry rub is excellent, but the sauce seems like too much work for a casual BBQ. My guests loved it w/ just the dry rub and a more traditional BBQ sauce- I cooked the ribs for an hour, then basted the sauce on for the last 15 or 20 minutes. Came out great.

Apple butter makes all the difference in basting these ribs. A true hit with everyone I served it to. And although I got a different Pinot it still brought out many of the favors you couldn't taste in the ribs alone.

Rating: 4
These ribs were amazing. Although I tweaked the recipe a bit: I added some cumin in the rub and some chopped chipotle in the basting sauce, it did moderate the sweetness some others had complained about. The only thing I will do next time is cut down on the liquids in the sauce, since it was a bit too runny.

Rating: 2
Although the friends I made this for raved, Ihave to say that I personally found it very sweet; too sweet, and this was after I had tweaked the basting sauce [after tasting] with cumin, paprika, habenero... anything to give it a kick. The basting sauce as written was way too sweet, in my opinion.

Best ribs we have ever had. We cooked them in the slow cooker for about six hours instead of in the oven. Then we grilled them with the basting sauce. Delicious and oh so tender.

We really liked this rub a lot, but the sauce was a little too vinegar-y for us. The roasting made the ribs really tender, and of course the grill made the flavor perfect.

To the previous reviewer - you should be able to find apple butter with the jams and jellies in the supermarket. I hate to tell you but it is more like a thick, well-spiced applesauce. There isn't any butter in it. It's more a term like "peanut butter".

This is an awesomely good recipe. We couldn't find apple butter, so we put apple slices and butter in a blender with the rest of the ingredients for the sauce. Everyone loved it we have made it twice already.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. I passed the recipe on to my brother who served it to his buddies. It was a hit there as well. Easy and delicious.

This was a refreshing change from regular BBQ ribs. But -- having said that -- I thought the sauce was very cloying, even after letting it meld for a day. I add freshly-ground pepper and some chipotle sauce to zip it up. Next time, I'll add even more heat.

Excellent. Make sure you actually remove the membrane, dont just score it. Keep them in the oven for a bit longer and let them rest for a good 4 hours as it helps them release from the bone.

Great recipe. Bought more ribs than I needed so cooked them over two days. The sauce is definitly much better after sitting overnight so definitly make ahead. The first outing we didn't put the cider in with the onions and ginger in the roasting pan. Have to say that the resulting carmelized onions rivaled the ribs. Used the cider the second time around and the ribs were much the same but the onions didn't compare.

Rating: 4
My husband and I loved this recipe! The ribs were the most tender I have ever had. Yes, the pan is a mess to clean up, but it is worth it. We grilled this time, but next time I will probably reheat in the oven or broiler with the sauce poured on top! Delicious!

I don't like ribs but made this as my husband has wanted ribs all summer. I loved it and will definitely make again. Our guests asked for the recipe too.

Rating: 4
These just might be the best ribs I've ever tasted! Besides the rich flavor, they were moist and tender. To avoid using my oven during the heat of the summer day, I marinated the ribs overnight, baked them the next morning, and grilled them that evening outdoors. I halved the recipe except for the apple cider, as suggested by another reader, to avoid burning up my pan. Next time I will also oil the baking pan or cover it with non-stick foil to make the cleanup easier.

To the cook from New Zealand: I would make spoon bread to go with your dinner. There's a spoon bread recipe on Epicurious from James Beard (House & Garden, January 1965) that is close to one I make. Pork and spoon bread is a classic Southern combination.

Made this recipe for fathers day, and everyone loved it. Even my sister, who doesn't particularly like barbecue, went back for seconds. The basting sauce is a little on the sweet side, so use sparingly. I boiled down the extra sauce to thicken it and served it at the table (cut with just a little extra vinegar). It was great.

I made this for an 8 person dinner party and had rave reviews. One of my guests, a native southerner, announced he was a rib connoisseur and they rated in the top 5 he has eaten. I followed the recipe as stated and chilled the ribs w/ the rub for 24 hours.

My 21 year-old son and my husband thought these ribs were great. This is a good recipe for something other than hot and spicy (as people seem to prefer or expect). A delicious change...rich and sticky. I always use loin back ribs because they're so meaty, but St.Louis style is OK too.

I agree with Tulsa. OK. I prefer the following rub which has a little more kick: 2 TBS Salt, 4 TBS Sugar, 2 TBS Ground Cumin, 2 TBS Fresh Ground Black Pepper, 2 TBS Chili Powder, 4 TBS Paprika. I'm not sure, but I believe this recipe comes from the East Coast Bar & Grill in Cambridge, MA. I've been using it for years and have yet to find one I like better!
