Much too much salt.

I made this polenta to go with the veal chop in olive jus recipe that also is on this site. I added in quite a bit of grated parmesan cheese and it was dee-lish!

My mother used to make this for me, I made it for my children, and now I make it for myself. It's fabulous; however, it has always been a breakfast hot cereal in my family. Also, what might seem yucky to most people, I eat it with cottage cheese.
