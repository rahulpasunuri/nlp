This recipe is an absolute hit!!! Time-consuming but worth it. One thing I will do differently next time is either cut the (non-cheese) ingredients finely, or even puree the mixes - the large pieces of tomato, rosemary, mushroom, etc made it difficult to share. Definitely just go ahead and take the rosemary leaves off the stems. As far as serving, I just put them in 3 separate shallow dishes and served with crackers, toasts, and bread.

One of the most complimented appitizers I've ever made!

The review seems to be missing a very important piece of information - how to actually serve the cheeses. I scooped them onto small plates and just spooned some of the other stuff down around them and let everyone do their own thing. The porcini mushroom cheese was the clear winner, but all were enjoyed, especially with the "toppings" added.
