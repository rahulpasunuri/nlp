This soup is great and my 10 year old loves it. I do puree everything to make it a bit more creamy. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

I think it seemed a bit thin. Just be aware when processing the 5 cups of soup. I filled the bowl too high and had a mess all over my machine and kitchen. I omitted the prosciutto, but I think pancetta or bacon would also work wonderfully. Served with croutons and grated parmesan on top.

Very good. Great for winter time.

Pureeing makes a huge difference - I tasted it before I pureed all but a couple cups, and it was watery and not great, but after pureeing, it's delicious and a perfect creamy consistency.

I had high hopes for this recipe, because I love cannellini beans and I love Parmesan. Unfortunately, I found this soup way too bland. If I made it again, I would use bacon for a more "smoked" flavor, and increase the sage.

This soup was terrible. It was so bland and watery. I threw it down the sink. My husband, who eats absolutely everything and has never refused to eat anything I've served in three years, refused to eat it.

A few changes only because I was too lazy to go out on the first cold day of our New England Autumn...Used Red Onion, No Carrot, 1 Belgium Endive since I didn't have any celery in the house, rosemary instead of the sage and last but not least turkey bacon instead of the prosciutto and it came out absolutely delicious. Improvising...seems to always work out! Enjoy....FYI serving with Chicken Sausage with Pesto and a side salad.

Delicious and hearty! First time I tried it, I omitted the cheese rinds and added grated parmigiano cheese. That did not turn out as tasty as with the rinds. I also place the soup in a blender since I'm not one for chunky soup. This is a keeper recipe.

I am eleven, and my brother is nine, and we both love it, and we ask our mom to make it all the time. Even my picky brother can't get enough of it.Yum! My mom uses an immersion blender to partially puree the soup.

I followed the recipe closely, and thought that this soup was good. I wasn't wow'ed by it like most of the previous reviewers, I just thought it was good. Having said that, it's a quick, easy, healthy soup. A good recipe to have on hand.

I didn't have any sage in the pantry, so I used a combination of dried thyme and rosemary with good results.

This is just about the best tasting soup I can make myself. I have made it a few times though and still can't get the ratio of liquid just right - I've reduced the liquid, added more beans, simmered longer, and it still comes out a little brothier than I would like. However, because it tastes so great, I will keep trying to perfect it.

We enjoyed this soup very much. A few changes: rather than using canned beans, I soaked some dried beans overnight and cooked those, then used them as the recipe recommends for canned beans. I used my own turkey broth rather than chicken broth. I used more Parmesan rinds...maybe 3 or 4. I used finely chopped ham instead of prosciutto (had it on hand). In addition to the sage, I made a sage oil by blending and straining sage in olive oil. I used it to squiggle over the soup after it was ladled into bowls. Very pretty, and the left over oil was used in a salad dressing later. Think this recipe works fairly well as written, although it obviously is tolerant of tweaking to fit what is in your cabinet. The resulting soup is a little thinner than I expected, but that turned out just fine when we floated some crostini on it.

Delicious! A little too much liquid though. I didnt blend any of it, maybe that would have helped. But overall, a great soup. Does anyone know how to keep the prosciutto from clumping together?

Great base recipe, but made some changes: omitted carrots, substituted 2 c. chicken stock for 2 c. water, 1 can Great Northern beans for 1 can cannellini, and 1.5 TB dried ground sage for 2 tsp. fresh. Added: 2 cloves garlic, bay leaf, 1/3 c. white wine, pinch ground thyme. I topped each serving with a generous amt of fresh cracked black pepper and grated parmigiano-reggiano. Delish w/garlic bread! When I make this again, I will add more prosciutto and possibly a handful of elbow pasta to thicken it up.

I loved this soup. It was awesome! I used more parmesan then called for (three rinds instead of two) and pancetta instead of prosciutto. It was great! I floated parmesan crisps in it.

This is a great soup! My husband is now under strict instructions never to throw away parmesan rinds, as I will make this soup each time we have them.

Its the best, so rich tasting. On one occasion I added escarole which was delicioius, but this soup really stands on its own

Truly excellent soup. Added this to my special "these are really great" recipe book. Will definitely make again. Will, like other cooks add another can of beans to make it a little thicker however. I did use bacon instead of proiscuto (sp) and rubbed sage (large pinch) since I didn't have called for ingredients. Will keep changes, but I think it would be excellent either way.

A good use for all those left over parmesan rinds (I hate to waste things with such good flavor potential)and except for the fresh sage in winter every ingredient is usually in the pantry or refrigerator. It wasn't a soup that my family raved over, but for something quick on a week night it fits the bill. If you have an immersion blender it is a breeze to make with nothing more than one pot,a cutting board, knife and the blender head to clean. As with most soups like this the flavor was better on the second day. A bit of garlic would be a good addition.

What you mean "bland"? This soup is excellent. Very flavorful, very easy and very quick. I did not have fresh sage, so I substituted dry. Will make this again and again.

Very bland and ordinary soup. I was hoping for more because of the reviews but felt it came out flat.

Rating: 4
Super easy and very delicious!!! Even though it seems extreme, try to use the imported prosciutto, it does make a difference, much mellower flavor and not as salty as the domestic, I agree with the reviewer that it's even better on the second day. Give it a try!!!

This is a great and easy soup. We doubled the recipe and it could have used more beans. I would just use an extra can next time. We will definitely make this again. The cheese rinds really did the trick.

Very flavorful for a bean soup. easy to make, my husband loved it... it will become a mainstay in the winter months.

I used this dish for a catering job that I did for a household. It was very well recieved! It paired perfectly with the rest of the Italien meal that I prepared and the family happened to be Parmesian lovers!

Delicious Soup!! Easy too! I thought it was even better the second day after the flavors melded together more. I do wish this soup was a touch thicker. I love very thick, hearty soups. It was a little thicker the next day. Used a handheld mixer and will try adding additional white beans at the end next time. This is a keeper for this winter!

Very tasty and easy. Everyone in the family, and also my daughter's 9-year-old friend, ate with gusto and asked for seconds. We love parmesan so I blended the softened rinds into soup--mine might have been smaller than recipe calls for--and I left more of soup chunky. Worked great.
