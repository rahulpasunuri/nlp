Once having a bread pudding in an upscale restaurant, they served it with a warm, sort of mildly sweet vanilla 'sauce' & it was soooo good!! Does anyone have a recipe for a vanilla sauce thats not too terribly sweet?

I wonder if they used a round baking dish. A 12" in diameter dish would be equivalent to a 9 x 12 pan

Delicious. I made with challah and used about 1 tablespoon vanilla extract in place of the vanilla beans.It was delicate and rich but not overly sweet. I used a 9x13 pyrex - I think it would be too watery for a springform pan, especially in the water bath (which was a pain to deal with anyway but worth it I guess). Also, I cooked the day before and reheated as directed. Came out perfectly reheated. Took about 45 minutes I think. Another note to a previous reviewer: I used golden raisins and they browned once cooked.

Be careful using springform pans for this recipe. This custard seems rather liquid, and it may just leak through the bottom of the springform pan. I remember making a huge mess some years ago when this happened to me. To achieve the look here, I would use individual molds and unmold them cold so they better hold their shape. Good luck!

I really want to make this pudding, but could someone clear up the instructions that call for "5 small, soft round rolls" and the preparation notes to "butter one side of each bread slice and arrange the bread slices, in one layer." How can you butter soft round rolls that have been cut to 1- inch slices. And it appears they have used dark raisins rather than golden, which would be alright. Sorry for not understanding how the bread instructions should be.

It does look pretty in the round shape. I bet you could use a springform pan. Give it a try!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but traditionally bread pudding is made with stale bread. So keep all your bread left overs. Just make sure it doesn't get moldy. And when you have enough, make bread pudding. Depending on the type of bread you use, the flavour will differ. But you can use whole grain bread if you like a more rustic pudding. There are lots of recipes around like this. Here in Belgium we have our own. We serve it with a sugar glaze or chocolate glaze on top. You don't need apricot jam in the recipe (in case you don't have any around and you still want to make the pudding). YOu can also flavour with eg orange zest, cinnamon, chocolate chips, ...

The comment about the round look is a good point. I wonder if it is cut out of the pan, or if they used ramkins to make small servings. Any thoughts as to which would work better?

Why is the picture showing a beautiful round pudding, but the recipe instructs us to use a 9 x 13 rectangular pan? I want mine to look like the picture!

My mother made this for us for special occasions. She called it "Queen's Pudding" and we simply loved it. It's rich and creamy and a favorite in our family. Now I know why she called it "Queen's Pudding". Try it, you're guaranteed to enjoy it!
