Super easy weeknight meal, which I will surely be making again. I did make some modifications: doubled the garlic, added smoked paprika, cayenne (we like spicy) and oregano to the parmesan, used shredded mozzarella instead of fresh. Served with roasted brussels sprouts and a mediterranean quinoa salad. Delish!

We made this with sauced ravioli served alongside. Double the garlic, combining with oil, salt, oregano, and crushed red pepper to coat chicken. Omit grape tomatoes. Coat with shredded parmesan. Prepared with frozen chicken, bake at 375F for 45 minutes. In last 15 minutes add a generous coating of panko breadcrumbs, topped with a sprinkle of shredded parmesan. Top with mozzarella just before plating. Irresistible!

This is really good!! Like others, I added more Italian seasonings (and extra garlic), and it was very tasty and light. I cooked it at 400 degrees at the top of the oven and it was terrific; no smoking and yet cooked quickly.

So simple and a definite success with the family. I chose to brown the chicken just a little first. Used tyme in place of oregano....worked great.

Loved this, but I think it needs more green herbs. I would add dried basil to the olive oil mix or garnish with fresh basil. I followed the advice of earlier reviewers by using the top third of the oven and had no problems with smoke. The chicken breasts I used were larger, so I added about 3-4 minutes of cook time. I will definitely make this again. It's quick and easy and pairs nicely with a simple green salad.

One fork for "okay." I followed the recipe exactly. For the calories, we didn't find it very tasty or interesting. The roasted tomatoes were great but the chicken was bland. Perhaps salting and peppering the chicken would help or perhaps smoked mozzarella would add some flavor.

Always very good, great for guests as it looks very presentable and colorful.

i followed the recipe to the T and the chicken didn't get cooked through but the fresh mozzarella on top was completely charred! i suggest cooking the chicken in the pan first, then put all together in over. add fresh mozzarella the last three minutes so it doesn't get burned.

I use Grapeseed Oil for this recipe. It has a much higher smoke point and should reduce the smoke problem for those that have them.

I am a vegetarian, so I made this with Quorn Naked Cutlets, which are a great chicken substitute (available at most Whole Foods and select grocery stores). They are sold frozen, so I put them on a plate with a bit of water, and microwaved them for 3-4 minutes. I then followed the recipe, adding a bit more crushed red pepper because I like my food spicy! This is an absolutely delicious dinner, any night of the week. I serve it with lemon/olive oil/salt/pepper tossed orzo and cooked fresh spinach with garlic. Yum!

super fast, easy, tasty. i was happily surprised that the chicken turned out so juicy. high heat is a great call. i halved the recipe for 2 pp. it likely would have been just as good with a little less fresh mozzarella. and no smoking issues cooking in the top third of the oven.

This has become a staple in our house. Easy and a dish everyone of all ages enjoys.

To the Cook from San Diego: Try cooking in the upper third of the oven, and you will eliminate the smoke.

Second review: I made this for the second time; I did not have grape tomatoes handy so I used a 14.5 ounce can of petite chopped tomatoes, drained, otherwise made no changes. My family preferred it with the chopped tomatoes - really delicious, and the tomatoes had a very nice flavor.

Rating: 3
I love how easy this is to make. I like to add a dab of pesto under (or instead of) the mozzarella and yellow squash and zucchini in addition to the grape tomatoes. I find the oregano and red pepper sufficient flavor for the veggies but have also added a little balsamic vinegar.

This dish was too bland for my taste. The tomatoes were nice but just couldn't save the dish. And the calories/fat added by the cheese.. just not worth it.

Good stuff. Didn't make the tomatoes but followed the recipe for the chicken and served it alongside pasta. Good alternative to breading.

This recipie is awesome!! Every time I serve it, all rave!! Served it up this time with garlicy rabes... too delish!!!!

Loved the simplicity of this - both ingredients and instructions. Who doesn't love a one-pan dinner? I used cut up tomatoes, as I didn't have grape tomatoes handy, and they roasted up nicely, collapsing to add to a light sauce of the linguine with which I paired it. I've already shared this one, and will make it one of my quick favorites.

DEEElicious! OK, I used 3 leftover Roma tomatoes instead of grape (quartered, seeded), but otherwise tried to follow the recipe as written. My oven (DCS, fantastic stovetop, a little unreliable oven temp) is slow; I ended up turning on the convection to make sure the chicken was fully cooked and it took about 20 minutes to reach 160 degrees by my Polder thermometer. I put this together while listening to our new President Obama speak to Congress (ok, I am a huge fan) after a long day at work, with ingredients I had on hand (just happened to have fresh mozzarella leftover from weekend Oscar's party). I couldn't ask for a simpler, more delicious dinner. I served this with roasted little potatoes and broccoli, the family was quite pleased, and I practically licked my plate clean. I will absolutely make this again!

Very good recipe. It adds something special to the meal, without being extremely rich. we love it with roasted potato's or pasta.

Delicious, definitely use more tomatoes than called for as they are fantastic. I've made this twice and both times had spatter in the oven and filled the kitchen with smoke. The first time i blamed the cheapo baking sheet which warped in the high heat. The second time smoked just as much though...Won't be making this again until i figure out what i'm doing wrong.

Very simple and tasty. I too omitted the mozzarella. It does spatter a bit in the oven, at this high temperature. I did not find that the breasts were quite cooked through after ten minutes, and so I lowered the temp. to 425 and cooked them for 5 more minutes.

This recipe is surprisingly delicious. I would highly recommend trying it and it's very easy to play with the ingredients. I've actually used the tomatoes in the oil mixture with quite a few other things that I've roasted in the oven. It's just a great, light flavor. Such a refreshing change from your standard chicken parm! Didn't have the mozzarella on hand, but I literally didn't miss it at all surprisingly. A great, simple, light but extremely flavorful little dish that easily lends itself to substitutions!

Good...as some others mentioned, I sliced some fresh basil & scattered over all at the end for extra flavor and color. Next time I think I'll try broiling for a bit of browning on the cheese; last time it tasted nice but was a little colorless.

Rating: 4
We really liked this dish. The tomatoes were excellent, I did however cut back on some of the mozzarella and I think when I make it again I will cut back even more to half of what they said. I made this with rice and veggies. The extra juice was delightful on the rice!

Yum! I used really thin-sliced mozzarella from my favorite deli and tomatoes and free-range chicken from the farmer's market, and it was out of this world. I agree with another reviewer who used fresh basil as an additional garnish--I used tomatoes and sprinkled fresh basil from the garden all over everything, and it was delish. DEFINITELY will make again.

Tt was good and easy to make...would make it again. I used a bit too much mozzarella cheese and there was way to much liquid in the pan. I also wanted the cheese to get slightly browned so I broiled it for a few minutes. Even my young daughter gave it a thumbs up.

Rating: 3
This is super easy, light and a wonderful use of the seasons best vegetables. I have tried this dish with the mozzarella and without. I think it's better without the mozzarella(and healthier) and with twice the tomatoes the recipe calls for. The chicken is unbelievably moist and the tomatoes are bursting with flavor.

Rating: 3
Yum! Took me longer than 15 minutes, but still very easy. I'll be faster next time. :-) I cooked the tomatoes close to the chicken. After it was done, I then put the broth/juice on some pasta on the side. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great way to have chicken parmesan. I used fresh basil as a garnish and instead of plum tomatoes I made a sauce and placed the chicken on top of it. Delicious!

Fantastic!!!! Easy!!!! What more do you want. I have followed the recipe, I have done the chicken in a frying pan and put a cover on to melt the mozzarella - either way - A KEEPER!!!

I have to admit that I had my doubts about this recipe but was pleasantly surprised. This dish was delish! The only change I made was to substitute basil for the oregano. The chicken was perfectly done and juicy and tasty! Definitely a keeper!

I have made many recipes from this site, but this is the first one that "wowed" me enough to write a review. This was so easy to make and SOOO tasty. I doubled the amount of tomatoes as others had mentioned, and it was perfect. My husband loved it as much as I did. I'll definitely make it again :)

This was great! I added the oregano and red crushed peppers to the garlic oil and used it to coat the chicken. This gave it a great flavor!

This was wonderful! I added minced garlic and oregano to the chicken. When you add the fresh mozzarella, put it under the broiler so that it browns nicely.

This is a very easy and quick dinner without all the fuss! The kids enjoyed it with some jarred sauce but the grape tomatoes were a surprising and fresh highlight. I think the addition of fresh garlic adds some great flavor! It's well worth the extra cost to use some fresh quality cheese!

Simple weeknight meal that my whole family enjoyed.

Delicous! My husband said it was restaurant quality. Followed all the suggestions. Used half italian seasoning, half oregeno for tomatoes. Added panko and italian seasoning to the parmesan for the chicken crust and that was amazing!! It made the meal. Thanks to all for those modifications. Going in the rotation for sure!

Tried this one again and instead added some italian seasonings to the oil along with minced garlic to punch up the chicken a bit. Added some panko crumbs to the cheese to get back the crunch and a nice golden brown look to the finished product. Doubled the tomatoes and red pepper flakes. We'll make this one again!

We thought this was great--and fast and easy. We used semi-flattened chicken, added some extra garlic, used extra virgin olive oil and used a high quality parmesan. Make sure the garlic is between the chicken and the parmesan and your chicken should be bursting with flavor.

Fairly simple to make but bland and boring. I agree with the reviewer from San Diego that it's a waste of cheese.

I substituted Italian seasoning for the oregano. Added red pepper & Ital seas. to Parm coating on the chicken. Tossed the roasted tomatoes & oil with some thin spaghetti. My husband and I loved it! Would definitely make this again... Thinking about trying it without the mozzarella and maybe adding some Asiago to the grated Parmesan for a different flavor...

My husband loved this dish and wants me to make it again for sure. He likes bland more so that pizazz like myself. The tomatoes were very good and gave the chicken more flavor. I too thought the chicken was a bit too bland and the cheese on top was flavorless but had a good consistency. I liked the garlic, basil and olive oil which the tomatoes gave it a nice flavor. Worth trying once.

I disagree with the other cooks: I thought the chicken was flavorful and moist. I did not miss the breadcrumbs one bit! I definitely agree the tomatoes are incredibly tasty, and I could see serving them as a side all on their own. But I served this last night with orzo and I thought it was very, very tasty. And deceptively easy.

The chicken gets one fork and the tomatoes get three forks, for an overall average of two forks. The chicken was too cheesey and very bland. The tomatoes were tasty. My husband said not to make this again.

Somehow all the parmesan flavor melted away while the chicken was roasting. The tomatoes were yummy, but overall this was a waste of precious parmesan.

The tomatoes were incredible, but I agree that the chciken was blandd. I found myself missing the crunchy, herby breading of a traditional parm. Next time, I'm going to make twice as much tomotoes and skip the chicken!

This recipe was really easy to make. The tomato topping was really delicious, but the chicken parmesan itself was a little bland - it could use some additional seasonings (some of the peppers and oregano from the tomato topping)
