Delicious! I roasted the asparagus on the grill. Didn't have fresh tarragon so subbed half a teaspoon of dried. Served with a grilled chicken breast and grilled tomatoes from the garden. Great low carb, easy dinner.

The mushroom fircassee was perfect. I made it for mother's day, and it was a huge hit! For the asperagus though, I added some lemon and balsamic vinegar to liven it up. I also forgot the tarragon for the mushrooms, but it worked out well. What really perfects it though is using a mix of mushrooms, don't skimp and go just for the mini bellas!

Loved the mushroom/asparagus combination. I made the mushrooms up ahead of time, then warmed them up in a small skillet. Yummy!!

Terrific basic recipe. I made it pretty much as written but with a bit more shallot and some garlic, left out the tarragon and mixed it with penne topped with lots of Parmigiana-Reggiano.

The mushrooms (I used portabellas for costs sake) tasted like filet mignon. So, so, so good!

Delicious, easy, and healthy! I served mine over brown rice and added some fresh lemon juice to the asparagus. I will definitely make this again!

Quite simply, this rocked. I pan seared a piece of mahi-mahi, and served it with this recipe. Used olive oil instead of butter, shiitake mushrooms, and quite a lot more shallot, and added garlic as well. Served with a riesling. Delicious.

Excellent dish with a beautiful presentation. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 2 lb. of asparagus and made the mushrooms according to the recipe (I used 12 oz. of baby bellas). It was excellent, and every bit was gone. Next year I will use 3 lbs. of asparagus and the same amount of mushrooms. I also think it would be fine to use dried tarragon, because it is simmered for so long in the wine (it took about 10 minutes). BTW, I put a cookie sheet on my outdoor grill because my other dishes were baking at 350, and it worked out beautifully.

very good. used more asparagus (maybe 1.5 - 2 lbs) and less mushrooms (8 oz) and thought the proportions were right.

Made as directed, except cut up asparagus after roasting and served over brown rice. Very tasty.

I'll admit right up front I made quite a few changes. It came out delicious, but I'm sure the recipe as written would be good as well. I made the asparagus as written and it was terrific. I will definitely be making it this way again. I wanted to serve it all with chicken, so to reduce the number of pans I cooked the chicken on the stove for about ten minutes, then added in the onions and mushrooms a minute later. After the chicken was done I removed it from the pan and added the wine to the onions and shrooms and proceeded according to directions, though I substituted lavender for tarragon. I served it all with wild rice as other reviewers suggested. It was a beautiful presentation.

This is wonderful, and a SURE crowd pleaser. I have served this mostly with a pork tenderloin or chop, and wild rice. I have never heard anything but raves about it, and it's super easy.

I actually make the fricassee to put over chicken... first I cook boneless breasts in a frying pan with butter, salt, pepper and tarragon, then serve it with the topped with the fricassee and a side of wild rice... very very good. I've made it a number of times this way and guests always love it.

We eat asparagus often and this was a great way to prepare it. The mushrooms were especially good and would be great by themselves too.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving two years ago and make it all the time. My guests always love it. I make it exactly as the recipe suggests. Sometime i omit the mushrooms. Its great both ways.

You can make the mushrooms a day ahead, just add a bit more wine to reheat.

Really reall good. We made it with shiitakes we grew ourselves from a table top farm - excellent!

This is an excellent recipe. Don't change anything. Company has loved it each time. Leftovers (if there are any) are terrific in an omelet with feta or chopped up in a salad.

Awesome dish! My husband raved - And he is a very picky gourmet food snob.

It makes a stunning presentation and it tastes great ! I used several types of mushrooms and per the recommendations, used only 8 oz of mushrooms to 2 lbs of asparagus.

This is a relatively easy dish to prepare and has big "wow" factor. Even if you don't like asparagus much give it a try, because the roasting sweetens them up. Feel free to substiture any mushroom you have. Lastly, the recommended wines don't include Pinot Noir, which goes wonderfully... usually I wouldn't pair red with asparagus, but the roasting and the mushrooms make it a wine and food pairing homerun.

This was simple and delicious. Great combination of flavors. Easily a recipe to serve to guests.

I feared the asparagus might get dry, so used more olive oil. When lifted from the pan, undersides seemed "very" brown. However, far from "burnt", asaparagus had a rich , nutty flavor that was wonderful! Along with the mushrooms, this dish IS fantastic.

My boyfriend and I often come back to this recipe as a sure 'win'. It is very flavorful and versatile, in that, you can serve it with many different dishes. The tarragon is a great compliment to the mushrooms. Definitely something to keep in your recipe box...and by the way my boyfriend says "Mmmmmmm....good."

WOW- what a great recipe! I served this New Years Eve with a lobster newburg and it was de-lish! Absolutly will make again. Very easy and great tasting! I bought my main ingrediants at an Asian market and spent half of what is charged in the regular supermarkets.(i.e Aspragus $2.00 vs. $3.99 per lbs) :~)

This is a real winner! I didn't change a thing and I thought it was just wonderful. It always gets rave reviews when I make it. We like it with roasted salmon the best, but try it with anything.. It's YUMMIE!

This was delicious, and I don't think it was too much trouble. I doubled the recipe and ended up with waaaaaay too much of the mushroom mixture (crimini/shitake). The original mushroom mixture amount would be plenty for two pounds of asparagus.

Rating: 4
YUM! I didn't have shallots so I used a mild white onion and a clove of garlic; didn't have Italian parsley and fresh tarragon so I used regular fresh parsley and fresh thyme, and a rather flat champagne. I used crimini and portobello mushrooms. It was fabulous! Next time I'll try it with shallot and tarragon.

The asparagus came out delicious. The only reason why I wouldn't make this recipe again is because the mushroom fricassee takes a lot more work and it doesn't add much to the flavor. Stick to just the asparagus for this recipe--it's devine!

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. Roasting the asparagus worked out fine and the flavor of the mushrooms was wonderful but overall I didn't think it had a lot of flavor. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned the ratio of asparagus to mushrooms is too small. IF I make this again I will reduce the amount of mushrooms. I halved the recipe and served this as a side dish for 2.

We had never roasted asparagus before, so were wondering about the results. It was wonderful! The mushrooms added a tasty touch. Served this at New Year's dinner and it was a real hit with the diners! Will definitely make this again and again.

I love just about anything with asparagus or wild mushrooms, so a combination of the two takes me to food heaven. I've made the dish several times and shared it with friends.

Roasting is a GREAT way to make asparagus. Easy, no mess and all spears cook evenly..which doesn't always happen when I steam or grill. I substituted sherry for 1/2 the wine as sherry and mushrooms are a classic combo and it intensified the flavors a bit. The dish can be made ahead for a crowd.

Made as a side dish with a grilled beef tenderloin. Will make again. Drizzeled a little truffle oil over. Tasted great.

This is a fantastic recipe--the asparagus is cooked perfectly (although some of the oil burned on the pan while in the stove and it got a little smoky). The mushrooms are fantastic--we used shiitakes and morels. YUM.

Have made this dish three times and each time it received rave reviews. Suggest that you check the asparagus after 6 or 7 minutes - 10 minutes was too long for my taste.

Expanded this recipe to serve 14 with no problems. The "Casual Dinner Club" loved it and I would make it again.

This recipe was really great! The ratio of mushrooms to asparagus was very generous, so it would be ok to add extra asparagus if you want. Could have used a little more salt and pepper. Next time I will add 1 Tablespoon of Asian Oyster Sauce.

The mushrooms in this recipe are absolutely delicious. Be carefull not to over cook the asparagus. I had red wine available and used it instead of white wine and it turned out good too.
