If you love mashed potatoes, you'll love this dish. I used crumbled rice cake (because I didn't have any bread crumbs), and it was lovely. I'm so glad I finally found a way to cook turnips! One warning: Be conservative with the horseradish.

this was ok i wouldnt make it again, the turnips werent done when the potatoes were cooked, and i had to put them back in the pot and cook them some more. and even after another 15 minutes, they didnt really lend themselves to this recipe. ive had much better luck with other preparations of turnips, and would not try this again.

Second set of ingredients are for a Roasted Orange Molasses Sweet Potato recipe that ran in the same issue. Just ignore. I'm going to make the turnip horseradish one tonight.

This recipe makes no sense... it is two recipes, not one.

This turned out just fine. It's great way to use turnips. A good, comfort dish that I will make again, but it's nothing exceptional.

I would not make this again. If I did I would increase the turnips and add chives. My company gobbled up box mashed potatos with gravy and pretty much left this receipe alone. It was like kissing your sister, not too bad but certainly not great.

Tasty and simple, I omitted the bread crumb topping and made it with about 1/2 potato and 1/2 turnips. Also threw a large carrot in the pot, which added a little sweetness and color. This is an excellent way to fool your kids into eating more veggies.

This dish was OK, but I prefer more of a turnip taste. If you do as well, I suggest more turnips and less white potatoes. Naturally there is a type-o with the 2nd list of ingredients!

very tasty- i cut the recipe in half for the four of us- cut back on the potatoes- still a very nice potato flavor, turnips weren't overpowering. i may cut back even more on the spuds next time!

We LOVED this recipe. Had to ask someone at the supermarket what a turnip looked like and now I'll never forget since I'll have to make this again.
