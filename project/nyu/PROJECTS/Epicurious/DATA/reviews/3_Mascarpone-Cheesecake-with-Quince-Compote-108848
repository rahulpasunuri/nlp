I found this cheesecake truly delightful however the recipe seemed to miss something OR my interpretation of it anyway. It wasn't texturally like panna cotta by any stretch. I think that warming ALL the cream would go along way to solve that. I WILL make this again and the quince compote was sensational.

This is one of my go-to recipes. It's extremely decadent but not too sweet. Very much like panna cotta. I usually change the toppings based on the frozen fruit I buy (cook it down, add a little sugar and pour over the cake). A beautiful dessert.

This is actually a fantastic dessert. It's not very sweet -- it tastes like a panna cotta -- and yes, mascarpone is a slightly more expensive ingredient than cream cheese. But it's definitely worth it. This dessert has subtle flavors -- you're probably not going to like it if you're into supersweet things. But you can create a different topping (like a chocolate sauce or raspberry coulis, etc.) to sweeten it up. My recommendation to save on the cost: cut the recipe in half. You'll get something that looks more like a torte (besides, no one needs THAT much cheesecake!)

This was just a little too bland for my taste. The crust was fabulous and the cheesecake would have been great with a more tart fruit. Maybe raspberries or blackberries.

Wonderfully light cheesecake with a decadent nut brittle crust.

With four 8-oz. containers of mascarpone cheese at $4 each, this dessert was too expensive to make to be as so-so as it was. The crust was great, but the filling just tasted like milk. The quince was too strong of vanilla, and I had lots left over. Try some other recipe.
