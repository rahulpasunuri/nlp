Loved this. Great 'crumb' feel in the mouth and not too sweet. The cake held together beautifully and looked just like the picture. Simple recipe with a great result. I have to confess I didn't have enough polenta so topped it up with almond meal - not sure if this made much of a difference. I'm just sorry we can't get fresh plums all year around as my family loved this recipe.
