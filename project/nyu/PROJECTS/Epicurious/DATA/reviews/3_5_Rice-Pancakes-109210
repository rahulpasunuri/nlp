These are a great alternative to plain old pancakes. Tender, with a melty cottage cheese bonus. A good way to use left over take-out rice. They seem to be more nutritious too - would love to have more nutrition info with all Epi recipes.

Great way to use leftover rice. I also added some leftover canned corn.

Fabulous texture. The melting cottage cheese is to die for.

These were very interesting and good pancakes (I made them with Chinese take-out rice leftover), a very different way to use rice!
