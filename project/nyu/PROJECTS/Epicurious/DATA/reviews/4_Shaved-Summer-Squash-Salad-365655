easy and delicious. totally satisfying textures. I even used prepared lemon and garlic (sinful, i know!) in a pinch, and it still came out really good. tender fresh squash and nice arugula help. I didn't even add cheese. I would throw in mint and tomatoe next time to try a new combo, but the amonds and shaved squash are so good!

I've made this salad on several occasions, once for a friend who is a restauranteur. Always get rave reviews. It's a nice change from your typical summer salad with attractive presentation, different textures.

I changed this recipe a little bit based on what I had on the fridge. The summer squash marinated its the star of it and its great! I used spinach/walnuts and shaved parmesan instead. Great summer lunch!

I made this salad with squash and arugula from my garden. I did not add almonds due to allergies but I can't imagine that the almonds were the star ingredient here. Would they have made this salad the winner it should have been? The flavors were weak and muddled. A waste of good food in my opinion.

This is delicious and looks beautiful. However, you have to eat right away or the squash will become soupy. After plating it we took just a couple minutes to get some other things together before sitting down to eat, and I felt the squash had already become a bit too soft and wet by then. So unfortunately I think this can't be a company dish.

I love this salad...there's a similar version made with asparagus and parmesan that's fabulous too. Which reminds me, I like it even better with a really good shaved parmesan. Awesome!

Be Careful that the garlic doesn't overwhelm the dish. I wish I had put less.

Perfect for a summer evening. The longer the shaved squash marinates, the zestier it becomes.

A wonderful new way to use all the squash coming out of the garden. I used sliced almonds and just discarded the seedy centers.

While it is time-consuming to shave the sqaush with a vegetable peeler, the finished salad was delicious. I couldn't find arugula and served the squash without it. The raw garlic gives it plenty of flavor and the finished product is colorful and perfect for a summer weeknight side.

I love new salads and this was a winner! This was so simple and fresh, and a wonderful new and different salad. I added a little more lemon than the recipe called for, and it was great. Don't let the squash sit in the dressing more than a few minutes or you start to get juice/liquid in the bottom of the bowl.

We made this as a first course last night for our gourmet group - excellent summer salad. Everyone loved it and we all determined we would make it again.
