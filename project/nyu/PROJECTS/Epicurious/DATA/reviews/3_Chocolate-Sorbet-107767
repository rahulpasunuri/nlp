Wonderful sorbet! Smooth, sweet, chocolatey, and easy to make. It's better than other chocolate sorbets I've made - as someone else said, I think caramelizing the sugar makes the difference. I only chilled it for about 45 minutes, and even so it only took about 40 minutes to freeze in my ice cream maker.

This is my go to elegant chocolate recipe. I have added chopped up banana truffles and garnished with mint and fresh banana. Another time I added some fresh passion fruit. I garnished with a very light white chocolate glaze.

When I first made this sorbet, it came out pretty gritty, which I think was partly because I didn't bring the water to a full boil to dissolve the cocoa. (The recipe could have been clearer on that point.) We ate some of it with strawberry sauce, and then I melted down the rest, brought it to a proper boil, and refroze it the next day. The second time it was much smoother, but the cocoa texture could still be detected.

This was the best chocolate sorbet we've ever had. Well worth the extra time taken to caramelize the sugar. Chilled the mixture overnight, made it in the AM, and ate it after lunch. Very dark, chocolatey, smooth.

We thought this was very good--very chocolately. It was a great, fat-free Valentine's treat. I had no problem with the freezing process. I made the recipe the day before, and refrigerated it overnight before putting it in the ice cream maker.

This worked great in my krups ice cream maker. I used Dutch cocoa has instructed. Color was great, consistency was perfect and taste was chocolate, chocolate,chocolate. I followed directions and let my mixture chill overnight in the fridge before making. It was fabulous.

Perhaps I did something incorrectly, but my sorbet was far to sweet/chocolaty (never thought that could be possible). For the work involved, I would be much better off with Ben, Jerry or Edy's.

Not sure I agree with the "not too sweet" bit. Next time I use a bit less sugar. Otherwise, perfect.

What appeared to be a chocoholic's delight, turned out to be a disaster. I am an experienced ice cream and sorbet maker, and after two freezings with two frozen Cuisinart canisters, I had cold soup. After 24 hours in the freezer, it hadn't made it to the "soft-serve" stage. Glad I hadn't planned it for a dinner party.

Really easy to make, surprisingly creamy (not icy at all)! Not too sweet--definitely for those who prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate
