This cake IS a bitch. What's up with constantly moving the very light cake around? I wish it just said to put it on the rack to BEGIN with to save me the effort of a crumbling cake. I'd also like to mention I was in PATISSERIE SCHOOL. The icing is not enough to cover the entire cake, the mousse never whipped properly and I had to add more cream later, 4 cinnamon sticks is way too much and if you make the icing exactly, it seizes - use a ban-marie. The ONLY decent thing about the recipe is the light fluffy cake itself - the filling and icing can go. 2 forks for flavour, otherwise prep and mess alone would make it 0, if 0 were possible. Disspointed!

A big and beautiful hit!!! Did not have cherry jam so subbed strawberry, which was great! I took the suggestions to cool the glaze a bit, but was sorry. It did not spread smoothly. Next time I will follow the directions. Simply divine!

This cake. Is. A BITCH. The end result is definitely tasty, but not as beautiful as the picture. (Well maybe, unless you are a professional chef.) Not worth all the time and advance planning!

The mousse and the glaze were quite tasty, but I agree with the others that the cake itself was not worth the effort. Unnecessarily complicated recipe that made a very thin cake in a 9 inch round pan. Everything else was spot on.

I haven't made this recipe, but wanted to share a tip on the heart pan. If you don't have one, you can use 1 square pan and 1 round pan and create your own heart. You will have to double the recipe, but who doesn't love extra cake? Just cut your round cake in half and turn your square cake so it looks like a diamond. Then put each half of the round cake on adjacent sides of the square, and there's your heart.

A Cook, The elusive fourth tablespoon is used to coat the foil as described in the first paragraph.

The recipe calls for 4 Tbl of butter, but then uses only 3. Is the extra tablespoon for good luck, or am I missing something?

I was wondering how it would turn out in round pans instead of a heart pan?

Exceptional recipe. Make sure to plan ahead for the cinnamon cream! The glaze takes much more than 30 minutes to cool enough to coat the cake. I always end up doing multiple layers of glaze. It is a hit every single time I make it and all my friends request it for their birthdays. I prefer raspberry or blackberry seedless jam with Chambord, instead of the cherry.

I made this cake for a birthday party at work. The cake was a success and the flavors were a nice surprise. The cake itself deflated after I removed it from the oven. I did not have an 8in pan so I used and 8.5 inch cheese cake pan. I don't know if the additional half inch was a contributing factor. Aside from that the cake was wonderful and I would make it again. The finished product looked like a professional made it.

This was a good cake, but it didn't look as nice as the picture. The cake was nice and moist. I make a strawberry syrup/ jelly instead of using the cherry jam and this made the cake especially moist. The cinnamon mousse is not sweet, but the combined flavors are great. The one thing I would change is the ganache - mine did not solidify. Instead of the receipe listed here I would simply scald 3/4 cup cream and then pour over 1/2 pound milk chocolate, stirring until mixture is even. Chill until spreadable.

This was delicious!!! I am 12 years old and I was able to make this all by myself. What I mean is, this is not a difficult recipe, it is just time consuming. The ganache is GREAT!

I am now obsessed with this cake. I made it way easier on myself and used a box cake mix and then did everything else as stated in the recipe, although I probably put on more of the jelly than they called for, I wanted enough to cover both half. It was so delicious, my roommates and I can't stop eating it.

This was absolutely worth the effort. It was so beautiful and the flavors blended perfectly. I bake often and my boyfriend was definitely impressed by this cake.

The taste of this cake was outstanding!! I used black cherry jam since I couldn't find regular cherry jam and I used chai green tea since I had trouble locating black chai tea. The texture of my cake came out fine and not dry as mentioned by other reviewers. Maybe they overmixed the batter. I served the cake with fresh raspberries and it was all gone in less than 15 minutes. Will definitely make again.

whoo-boy was this cake dry! I'm in the process of making it right now. the jury is still out on the mousse since it's not made yet, but the chai glaze is exceptional. i'm using a different batter to re-make the cake, and i'm going to use the glaze and mousse. we'll see how it goes.

I thought this was a wonderful cake. I must say that the first time I made it the cake was too dry, However when I reviewed my steps I realized that I could have done a few things differently. 1. I bought fresh dutch processed cocoa. (The first used hersheys) 2. I bought really fresh eggs from the farmers market. 3. Baked in 2 tart pans for 12 minutes. These three things changed the consistancy and texture of the cake dramatically. I could see the difference even when mixing the batter. Finally this must be made 1 day ahead and refrigerated for the optimum flavor. This recipe got amazing reviews from family and friends!!!!!

Delicious.

For someone VERY special, as it is very time-consuming, but incredible and will be the star of the show. The chai glaze is especially fantastic. For sligthly easier assembly, you can just make it as version of Double Chocolate Torte, with the glaze http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/104512.

This cake just took way too long to make and I really didn't think it was worth the time. It seemed to me to be a deluxe version of a black forest cake but not as moist. There are many recipes I prefer to this one.

It's worth the work. Best chocolate cake in my reperatoire!

Rating: 4
My family's favorite chocolate cake. I've never had a problem with dryness, it always comes out delicious as long as I follow the instructions carefuly. It looks beautiful with this glaze, it's hard to believe I can make something so fancy-looking! It is a lot of work to make, but worth it if you have time.

This cake is serious WORK, but it is so good that you won't mind. I made it for a work function and everyone still talks about it almost a year later. Sidebar: if you ever have the chance to eat at Citzen Cake (where this recipe comes from), DO IT.

Stunning result both taste-wise and appearance-wise. Cake cooking time is right on and not a minute longer. Will use the tea leaves inside a tea bag next time because hard to strain them out even using a coffee filter.

I made this very pretty cake for my best friend's birthday... Everyone agreed the glaze was AMAZING! However, no one was really impressed with the cake itself. A moister replacement would fix this, and perhaps a different fruit perserve (raspberry?). I'm sure glad I had left over glaze though... wow!

I made this for my Recipe Exchange group for our Valentine's luncheon. Everyone loved the complexity of the flavors but a few found the cake some what dry. I had problems with it also, I used two 8" rounds @ 400°F but it rose to fast and then dropped a bit. A lot of trouble but I'd make it again, it's certainly impressive.

I made the cake in 2 heart pans for the 2 layers. Shortened the bake time by 5 min and it came out fine. Really chilled the layers (on the porch - it's about 10 degrees F here) before glazing as well. Maybe that would help?

I gave this cake a high rating because the combination of flavors was delicious and I received lots of praise. However, I did have a bit of difficulty with the cake. . .it never completely set in the center which made slicing it impossible. I ended up leaving it one layer, pouring the glaze over it and mounding the mousse in the middle surrounded by a ring of raspberries. It still looked (and tasted) wonderful but I was a little dissapointed. Did anyone else experience this trouble?

Wonderful cake - rich, complex flavors that blend well yet are distinct. Time consuming, not difficult, worth every minute of production! I wish we had leftovers!
