I added a clove of garlic and then pureed the garlic and anchovies in the food processor. I added the egg and juice of one whole lemon and then slowly added 3/4 cup of olive oil through the top of the processor (the little hole in the top of the white piece was perfect for adding the oil slowly). I then flavored the dressing with fleur de sel and yummy!

This recipe is great, but I increased the garlic to 3 cloves, and I skipped the raw egg.

Though the flavors did blend after chilling for a while, I didn't love the fishy-ness of the dressing. I would use fewer anchovies.

The croutons soaked up almost all of the oil making this recipe extremely fattening (and the croutons were really heavy). I felt it was necessary to add some dijon mustard to give the dressing a bit more kick.

This is the only recipe for Caesar Salad I make now. It is wonderful.

Great Caesar, however, If I were to do it over again, I would cut the romaine into little pieces, this gives the lettuce more sauce. I used 4 anchovies and 4 garlic cloves. I didn't realize how fattening a caesar salad was until I made it!

Loved this recipe. Used 3 cloves and chopped the browned cloves and added to the dressing. this makes plenty of dressing for future use!

Great Caesar Salad Recipe. Husband loved it. I would do everything the same except use at least 3 cloves of garlic. This is the recipe I will use when making Caesar Salad again.

This recipe is excellent. I am making it for the second time tonight for a dinner party. Isn't it funny how people who hate anchoves usually love caesar salad?

Very tasty! My sister asked for the recipe and was surprised that there were anchovies in it and she still liked it. I had intentionally kept the anchovies on the down low for that very reason.

This dressing was a hit. I used a bit more garlic and cheese. I also added spinach to the salad mixture.

Am making this tonight for the second time and will use more garlic. Used all the anchovies the 1st time, and will do it again tonight. That's what makes the salad for us.

This was great and pretty easy! I only used 4 anchovies (half the amount in recipe) and used 1 cup reggiano (twice as much as the recipe calls for). I also used 3 cloves of garlic when making the croutons instead of 1clove. I will definitely make this one again!
