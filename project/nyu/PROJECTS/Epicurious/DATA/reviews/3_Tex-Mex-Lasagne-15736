This recipe is a family favorite. I love it and it always pleases a crowd. I have made it many times. I buy soft corn tortillas so there is no need to fry them. I have also made a vegetarian version by omitting the chicken and icreasing the peppers.

I did not think this was all that time consuming.....of course I skipped the refried beans and tortillas part.....I made the recipe up to the reduce sauce part....threw the chicken in the bottom of cassarole dish - sauce on top and then will add cheese later when I get ready to stick it in the oven....I'm putting it over mexican rice..just like that....looks good and tastes god so far.

Totally delicious, with some changes. I used flour torillas (and did not fry them) in place of the corn tortillas. I replaced the refried beans with black beans and the salsa with enchilada sauce.

I've made this 3x and everyone loves it. Like I read - i cut down the liquid ingredients. I use the large flour tortillas (2 per layer) and cut the sides to fit the pan, overlapping in the centre. I also use a spicey packaged soy chicken substitute for my veg friends and it was so good my meat-loving boyfriend only wants it the veg way. It's the same sort of consistency as ground chicken - just a bit softer.

This was very good. But I thought it was a lot of work. I should have skipped frying the tortillas in oil like another person suggested. It did make a lot of food!

This made a great main dish for a Christmas lunch. I substituted chicken broth for the beer to make it completely gluten-free for one friend. It was fairly time consuming with all the grating and chopping, but the step I'll eliminate next time is softening the tortillas in hot oil; they'll be soft enough warmed up in the microwave!

I absolutely loved this dish... good Tex-Mex is so hard to make on your own, and this was surprisingly simple. I made it a few weeks ago, and I have had cravings ever since. Pair with the "Mexican Rice" on Epicurious for an outstanding meal!

Made this for a beach party ("hot vegetable") Who would have thought, refried beans in Epicurious? It was very good even w/o the chicken part (beer, etc.)! The corn tortilla preparation was perfectly described and I topped with enchillata (sp) sauce (somewhere in there). Not a bit left. Now for making the entire recipe.

This satisfied my craving for 'tex-mex' that just can't be met in English resturants! I reduced the beer, as I was pregnant, had my husband make it! We had to use flour tortilla's(all that is available in the UK) and all the American ex-pats we made it for LOVED IT!

My son and I made this last night and the whole family loved it. Since I don't have the specified pan, we used a bigger one and consequently more tortillas. The consistency was just right and the flavor excellent (we'd substituted extra sharp cheddar for the Colby cheese). It fed four generously and we still have an entire dinner's worth of leftovers!

I thought it was well worth the effort, but it was quite an effort. My main criticism would be that the layering of tortillas that do not cover the corners yet overlap so much in the center is not necessary. Next time I make this dish I will cut the tortillas to cover more the baking pan more evenly.

I made this recipe with several modifications. I cut the salsa and beer in half (to avoid the 'sloppy texture' referenced in another review), skipped the coriander and cayenne, substituted cheddar in place of colby, and 1 lb. ground beef in place of chicken. Also, I further modified this dish by using a black bean salsa purchased from a specialty store. The consistency and flavor were perfect for me and my family.

My husband compared this to being like "bean dip with chicken in it." The texture was very sloppy--almost liquid. The flavor was good, but I think I'd rather have something a little less runny.

Once i had converted ounces into grams etc. this was very easy too make, i made this will alot or left-overs (i didn't have a few things like the cider vinegar) and used borito cases instead of tortilla ones, they are the same aren't they ? Overall i thinkthis is a great quick 'n' easy to make dish tasty etc. but i am stilling trying to figure out how i could serve this in a restaurant. any suggestions ?

Flavor was good, texture was sorta mushy...as the recipe indicated, the tortillas don't completely cover each layer. Maybe adding 6 more tortillas (6 per layer instead of 4) would help?

this is my favorite large-crowd dish. everyone loves it -- esp. with condiments. can be made veggie, too (just double the peppers). i've also made it with flour instead of corn tortillas which is almost better.

This was great for weekday or entertaining. Much easier than I thought and delicious. The flavors blended very well and it was a definte hit! A salad and some Margueritas and you are all set.

I didn't care for it. Seemed to be mushy, and all ingredients mixed together with the baking.

Quite an excellent dish, not as hard to prepare as it initially looked. All of the flavors came together quite nicely after it was cooked.
