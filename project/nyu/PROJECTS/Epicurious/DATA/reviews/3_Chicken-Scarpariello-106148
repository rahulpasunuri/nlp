Like the last reviewer stated, I'm not a big fan of this recipe either. No depth of flavor and too many bell pepper undertones.

Made this wonderful recipe last night. Brought me back to my Grandmothers house on Sundays of yore. Highly recommend this honest Scarpariello chicken recipe. My favorite chicken dish.

Oh OK. I'm a hero. This is very good, and easy. They scraped the platter clean.

Had this dish for the first time ever at a fine Italian restaurant, loved it, and then went hunting for a recipe..... I used boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs, added 1 lb. of sweet Italian sausage cut into 1 inch chunks (and cooked along with the chicken) and 1/2 lb. of sliced white mushrooms (cooked along with the other vegatables)and increased the wine and chicken broth to 1/2 cup each. DELICIOUS!! Worthy of being served at the finest Italian restaurant! Whatever you do, do yourself a big favor and be sure to add the Italian sausage. It will take this dish over the top!!

Stellar recipe. Real chicken Scarpariello uses sausage, so I sauteed 1lb. hot Italian turkey sausage, then cooked the thighs in the drippings. Another (time-saving) tweak - added 4 tbsp. B&G chopped hot cherry peppers. Would definitely NOT use skinless, boneless breasts...not much flavor and they'd become tough and dry. Served it over parmesan orzo and everyone was fighting over the leftovers the next day. From now on I'll double the recipe. :)

All of you boneless-skinless-chicken breast people, no wonder you thought it needed improvement. Might as well have used shoe leather. Bone-in thighs are the only way this comes out with any flavor. If you really can't eat hot food the cherry tomatoes are a good substitute. My family likes it hot so I crank up the heat a little. Served with either either rice or noodles its' good comfort food.

This definitely needs improvements. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts (that's what I had in the refrig), hot italian turkey sausage, juice of 1 lemon and a sprinkle of capers. In place of the hot peppers, I had "pepperdew" red peppers from the supermarket olive bar. I know this is a lot of changes but it really came out delicious made as is. It was so good, I'm serving my version at a dinner party next weekend. Served over egg noodles. My version was a combination of this recipe and one from the internet.

The ingredients were fine but it did need some help. I used sliced boneless breast dredged in flour and then fried. Also As I wanted this over penne I went with 1/2 cup of wine and 1/2 cup of broth and add just a touch of roux at the end to give it some thickness

I included chunks of Italian Style mild Turkey sausage and coarsely chopped black olives, and omitted the bell and hot peppers. It was wonderful, but next time I will not salt the chicken.

Bleah! Really really did not enjoy this. Bland in flavor, chicken skin was wobbly and gross, and needed way more cooking time. Would not bother with this one again, there are so many great chicken recipes out there!

The recipe I have for Pollo Scarpariello uses stewed tomatoes, balsamic vinegar (not red wine vinegar), pepperocinis (not cherry peppers) and (optional) sausage. This is good, but mine is surely better than an 82% review.

I already rated this, but just made it again using a few hints from "Bay Area's" post. I added about a 1/4 cup of marsala and a tablespoon of chopped fresh rosemary along with the same modifications I made last go-around. I must say, it was truly delicious! I'll make this a lot.

This is fine for a weekday dinner. It's easy and has a nice flavour. The kids liked it. I wouldn't serve it for guests and I would say that it closely resembles a meal you would find on the Campbell's Soup site - except for the kick of the the peppers.

This dish was a solid and tasty dish. Made if for my wife on Valentines Day and it was good with Italian bread and a salad. Very simple but tastes wonderful!

Have to disagree with this rendition of Chicken Scarpiello. *Real* Scarpiello features both sausage and (copious amounts of) rosemary. This is a nice chicken dish, but NOT Scarpiello. My suggestions: Use boneless instead of bone-in chicken. Cut the chicken into large cubes before cooking. Add equal parts of hot italian sausage. Use LOTS of garlic for frying the meat. Add LOTs of rosemary to the dish about 2/3 of the way through the cooking process. Leave out the peppers. You'll get all the heat you need from the sausages.

Kalaidiascope of flavors jump from the plate with this dish. So simple that my 8 year old can make it with astonishing--to her-- gourmet results.

Made this dish for a family style Italian dinner alongside lasagne. Very easy and makes a great presentation. I used the red pepper flakes, doubled the recipe and used legs and breasts as well as thighs (but did not have a cleaver for cutting small pieces therefore needed to cook longer.) Everyone raved. Will cut smaller pieces next time to speed cooking.

Fabulous recipe! To cut down on the fat, I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and not a bit of flavor was sacrificed. I added two more garlic cloves than the recipe calls for as we really love garlic. Served over orzo with parmesan and minced green onions. A definite keeper!

This is the first chicken dish I've cooked solo (without being in a cooking class), and it was perfection!

This is a keeper. Quite delicious and simple enough for any night. I,too,substituted red pepper flakes for the cherry peppers... simply because all I could find was mild peppers. No point in that. Served the chicken over orzo, tossed with olive oil, fresh lemon juice and parsley. Light and oh so good. Molto bene!

Yummy... Replaced the cherry peppers thing with red pepper flakes so it won't be too spicy. It was so yummy, we ate it with rice and salad..

Excellent dish! Rich enough to be a real meal, but light enough that you're not out for the count. Use a really sweet onion and make sure the peppers really ARE "peppery." I served it with orzo with chives and olive oil mixed in and it was a really good dinner. One of the things I liked about it is that there is enough to do that you really can have someone help out in the kitchen (assuming space, of course).

Wonderfully flavorful, as you can imagine. Hot and spicey without being too much so. It is a taste I have never created myself, so I am quite proud of myself as well as this site!

This was an awesome recipie. I marianted the chicken overnight and then pat the pieces dry. Also added some chopped shallots and served over saffron rice. Excellent! My dinner guest raved that this was my best meal yet and told me to send him the recipie so I would not lose it!

Wow! This is fantastic. I can't eat hot foods, so I used cherry tomatoes instead of the peppers. I cut the thighs in half myself, and found the bone splinters a bit, so you have to be careful when eating it. My husband just loved it. I will surely make it again.
