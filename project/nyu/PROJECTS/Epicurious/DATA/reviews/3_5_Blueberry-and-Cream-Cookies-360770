Again, these sounded awesome but my family said "what's the big deal?" They came out flat and crispy, although softened up in the cookie jar. Next time I will just use my regular chocolate chip cookie recipe and simply substitute dried blueberries and white chocolate chips!

For a recipe like this, the ingredients should be listed by weight not volume. Important to note that those who had problems with height of cookies .... Check both your over for proper temp as well as use fresh baking powder.

Really good cookie. I found that it needed a lot more blueberries - now I put in more than 2 cups. Also, they bake up really nice in a smaller size, I usually use a 2 Tbsp scoop.

Excellent cookies!!!! My neighbors all loved them. First batch baked-20 in was too long. Second batch-I lessened the cooking time and just eyeballed them and pulled them out when they were slightly golden on edges and still a tad undercooked in the middle. Much better crispy edges w/chewy centers. I will make these over and over.

When I first saw these in the magazine over the summer, I thought they sounded amazing. I just baked them today, and they were a major disappointment. It's such an enormous batch that the kitchen aid mixer couldn't handle it - the dough was so dense the blade got stuck. They taste okay, and if someone gave me or sold me the cookie, I would probably think it was good, but for the effort I spent baking them, I was expecting the delicious looking things in the photo, and I got cookies that look like scones, and are a little too done on the bottom (despite reducing the cooking time to under 20 minute). Note: there is another version of this recipe out there (the chef was on Martha Stewart) that uses glucose instead of corn syrup and does call for a little melted white chocolate in the milk crumbs. I wonder if that might make them more true to the restaurant version.

Best cookies I've ever made!!! Everyone asks for the recipe, and I've had a few people ask when I'll be making them again. I've also tried a few variations: dried cherries, and cranberry & pecan.

Excellent cookies! I made these twice - following the recipe precisely each time. The second time, I baked for 20 minutes resulting in a crunchy outside and slightly chewy center - everyone loved them both times but my family prefers the softer center. A couple of my friends have commented that these cookies are the best cookies they have EVER tasted.

These cookies are absolutely addictive and worth the considerable time in making them-- I have received more compliments and recipe requests for these than any any other cookie! My recommedation for everyone is to really follow the directions carefully-- the only thing I changed was use a smaller scoop and reduced the cooking time accordingly-- perfect every time!

I don't know what's going on, but I've been baking these all morning and I keep turning down the temperature and reducing the baking time, but they continue to spread a lot and come out crispy instead of chewy. The flavor is fine, but I followed the recipe EXACTLY and can't figure out the problem. Maybe my 1/4 cup disher is a little small? Still, they don't look at all like the picture. Also, I got 48 cookies out of this recipe. That's a lot of cookies, and they're kind of greasy.

I found these cookies to be too sweet and buttery for my taste. I had high hopes this was going to be an exceptional recipe, but its not going to be a keeper for me. The version of the recipe on the Martha Stewart web site looked much more appealing to me as the recipe was both scaled down in size and the butter content cut in half.

I just made these cookies and what a yum!!!! Mine stayed plump though and didn't spread. They more looked like a scone. I didn't find the recipe any trouble and I bake with butter anyway. The best way to get that fulfilling flavor and this cookie made for a real cookie fix. I will be shipping off these cookies to one of my soldiers and I sure hope they love every bite as much as I enjoyed baking them. This is a keeper and well worth making over and over.

Okay. I am all about eating yummy things regardless of fat content, but if this makes 35 cookies in just one cookie -there is over 1 Tablespoon of butter each!! Just seeing that was what made me not want to go through the trouble. The idea sound delicious. But... Maybe we can send this recipe to Cooking light so they can make it over?

Very good, don't have that many alternatives to chocolate type cookies, this is a keeper.

I thought the cookies were great. I had a lot of family over when I baked them and everyone agreed. ONE QUESTION: Why do some of you mention white chocolate when I don't notice it in the milk crumbs recipe on this website??

I was totally intrigued by this recipe and felt compelled to give it a try. As soon as I got started, though, I knew that the editors hadn't gone over the recipe carefully enough. A pound of butter? I don't think they bothered to scale it down to non-restaurant proportions. Sure, I ended up with a boatload of pretty good cookies...but they absolutely weren't worth the enormous expense of both time and money it took to make them. As a devout epicurious fan and avid baker, I consider a recipe like this the perfect example of too much trouble for too little in results.

0 forks. this recipe is terrible. i feared that it would be, from the start all the ratios seemed extremely off but i thought i would make the recipe as it was written first to see how it came out. such a waste of time and money. i should have just stuck with my gut and trusted my own knowledge. with some provisions i am sure these cookies could be lovely though. also, i interestingly enough found another recipe for them at http://www.marthastewart.com/portal/site/mslo/menuitem.fc77a0dbc44dd1611e3bf410b5900aa0/?vgnextoid=6b0fdd785d91f110VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default the ratios are much more logical, maybe i will try them again.

A very true representation of the actual cookies at Milk Bar. Made them exactly as written and they came out exactly right. (To LLightning from Australia, I don't believe there is white chocolate in the recipe? Maybe that's why yours were too sweet? Mine had a good salty bite to them, just like the ones at Milk Bar.)

I decreased both sugars by one half cup, but otherwise followed the recipe. With two kinds of sugar, plus corn syrup, plus white chcolate which is also very sweet, I found these cookies made my teeth hurt. The dried blueberries and the milk crumbs were the best parts and I might tinker with these elements in my own version of this recipe.

This is my favorite cookie ever and very much like the real thing from Momofuku Milk Bar. The perfect way to christen my new KitchenAid 600. I can't wait to try the Crack Pie recipe! Now if we could just get the Cereal Milk Ice Cream recipe- please.

Question On milk crumbs... Are they suppose to be in clumps? Or small crumbs....

Addictively good. Can't stop eating them! Highly recommend making them to anyone. I cut the baking time by about 2 minutes, because the cookies were coming out too crunchy. Amazing! The recipe makes a LOT of big cookies!

Also...if you notice, the recipe is from a restaurant/bar. That's pretty much the way all that food we eat when we're out is made. It's horrible for you, but it tastes soooo good. Don't make it if you don't want to consume the fat...

Are you kidding me? Anyone can read the ingredients in this recipe and decide if they want to make it for themselves without your judgement. And you didn't count the butter in the milk crumbs ;)
