This recipe was very easy to make. I found the flours and hot pepper at Whole Foods. I personally don't like sherry vinegar so I used cider vinegar. The pancake and yogurt cheese work really well together and I added chicken breast to the salad for more protein. I would definitely do it again. I would even use the pancake with other recipes of mine. Enjoy!!
