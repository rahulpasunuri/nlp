I agree about adding some spice. I made this dish again and combined it with a recipe for lobster fra diablo by adding tomatoes and lots of spice. It came out incredible.

I thought this was a great dish. Add the pepper if you like, but if prepared properly a good lobster will make this a dish to remember.

This recipe is very good, but it needs work. After I added the cream, I added a few shakes of ground red pepper, a pinch of paprika, a teaspoon of tarragon and a little parm cheese at the end to help thicken it up.

This recipe was very bland. I think it needed an extra kick maybe some hot pepper flakes. I wouldn't make it again.
