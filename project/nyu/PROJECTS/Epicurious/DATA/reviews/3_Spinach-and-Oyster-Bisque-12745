Not a fan. The only thing I changed was using canned oysters rather than fresh so I guess it requires fresh. I ended up having to add about a cup of lemon juice and a bunch of salt to make it taste edible.

I don't want to say this is a recipe for connoisseurs, but I will say this: If you don't get a vision in your head of what it's supposed to taste like, don't try it. It's absolutely excellent! Use the measurements in the recipe as a start. When you get to the end, expect to have to tweak a bit to get the flavor to come into its own. You should be able to taste the nutmeg and lemon individually if you think about it, but it should also blend into the whole if you don't. Go slowly and taste it often as you flavor it.

not worth the trouble. Only saving grace is that the oysters were self-harvested. That may have been the issue; all we tasted was a VERY strong oyster flavor. Needed something to balance it.

Delicious recipe. Can be done in about 25-30 minutes. Make sure that the blender you work with is strong, the spinach-and-oyster compbination need to be really creamed. Use 2-3 spoonfuls of flour. Also, use clam broth instead of water to complement the oyster juice. And use half-and-half (think of your choronaries..). Easy on the tarragon, lots of pepper. You can skip the lemon zest. Enjoy!

If you can get past the bright green color of this dish and add LOTS of garlic and salt and pepper you may enjoy it. It isn't terrible, but definately not one of the better things we have tryed. It is too expensive for the outcome.
