BF thought it was great! I normally find zucchini to be bland, and I thought this recipe was one of the better zucchini recipes I've tried - not spectacular (for me), but decent.

I've made this several times. Its quick and with the zucchini cut into ribbons looks attractive. Its a light and fresh side dish.

I hate zucchini, but am trying to eat a wider variety of vegetables. The thought of eating it chunks makes my skin crawl. But this recipe saved me!! I didn't have any lemon zest but otherwise followed the recipe with only one zucchini. I added toasted pine nuts and it made for a delicious lunch for one. Flavorful, good texture and nutritious. All my goals met!

Simply delicious... a nice twist to zuke's... The lemon adds a great touch... don't leave it out.

great, simple zucchini stir fry to have on the side or all over the plate with rice is nice. lime rind tastes great too.

I skipped the lemon zest, but otherwise this is a nice side dish.
