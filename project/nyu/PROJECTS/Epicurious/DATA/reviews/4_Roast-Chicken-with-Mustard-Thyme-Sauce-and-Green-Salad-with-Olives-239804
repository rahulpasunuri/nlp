I made the sauce again, but changed the flour by roasted flour, and the result was much better, it tasted better, didn't have this booger texture and the color was a warm brown instead of grey

The sauce was terrible, but the chicken the best I've ever ate, so moist!

The brine step helped make for some very fragrant and tasty chicken. The mustard sauce was really unremarkable and bland, does nobody like spice(s) around here?

This brining gave the chicken a wonderful aroma. Though I had to add more sugar because of my background in cooking, Southern Vietnamese food tend to have more sugar in their cooking as opposed to my Northern Vietnamese heritage...

Loved it. Have made this 3 times in the last month. The six hour brine, 2-24 hr resting time, and added chicken broth ensures an incredibly moist and flavorful chicken with a crispy exterior. My only tip is to make sure that you buy enough chicken broth...I usually get 4 cups worth and am left with very little. Like anything, good quality ingredients helps (i.e. Swanson, Grey Poupon, etc.).

Without a doubt, the best chicken I have ever made. Possibly the best chicken I've ever eaten! It was SO moist and flavorful. I followed the advice of another review and stuffed the chicken with fresh rosemary, thyme, smashed garlic, sliced lemon slices, and slices 1/2 onion before cooking. Incredible! The sauce was a little too mustardy for me (I'm not a big mustard fan) but was very flavorful. I think next time, I'll just use a little less mustard. Even without the sauce, the chicken was fantastic.

My husband and son both liked it. I'd like to give a more through review, but I can't eat chicken so I can't.

I have used this brine for a BBQ chicken that I cooked on a Big Green Egg. The brine was pretty easy and my chicken came out tasty! At some point I will make the chicken with the sauce:-)

delicious chicken. brine was easy to do, as for the sauce, it is on the thin side so i added more flour to make it thicker and reduced it more.

We make roast chicken all of the time and this was superior. However, was pushed for time, heated the brining ingredients with 1/2 the water, then added the other half when done so that it would cook down quicker. Also ended up blow-drying the chicken for 10 minutes as I didn't read that it had to dry. Served with the salad, boiled new potatoes and green beans. Fantastic.

I'm not convinced about brining; a well-roasted bird tastes just as moist and flavorful to me as a brined one. So I skipped that whole step and found the meal quite delicious.

The chicken was good, but I was expecting better based on the 4 forks rating. I think the sauce was too thin and not very flavorful. Next time I would go with 1 1/2 cups of juices and broth, reduce it by 50% and then add the normal amount of the remaining ingredients. I made the salad again the next day and served it with some of the chicken breast, cold. It was delicious.

I never roasted a chicken before this one... I'm seriously impressed with myself for making something SO DELICIOUS! The chicken was the juciest chicken I've ever tasted...and the SAUCE- words can't describe. If you're reading these reviews to help you decide, take it from me. It's perfect. It's a shame I made it for just me :/ Will be great for guests!! This one went directly into the recipe box!

Made this for dinner with friends last night. Oh my goodness, was this chicken flavorful! I marinated it a little longer than suggested: from 11 pm Saturday night until 7 am Sunday morning. And I added a little more flour for the sauce to make it more gravy-ish. It was a wild success, and I'm definitely doing this again soon!

This was excellent. Very moist and flavorful. I didn't get as much juice in the pan as I would have liked though so I might add a little more broth to the pan next time. But overall, great recipe that I will use again. The salad with olives was a perfect pairing.

This was the best chicken I have ever made. No joke. I now get this whole brining thing. The sauce was absolutely delicious and the salad could not have been a more perfect pairing.

Make this recipe next time you have a couple of friends that you want to treat to a great homecooked meal. I made a few modifications, which I think increased and enhanced the flavor of the bird and sauce, so I will share them here. Followed directions to the letter until it came time to dress the bird. I filled the cavity with a slice of lemon, fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, some smashed garlic cloves, and half an onion-sliced.The house smelled fantastic and the chicken was so moist and flavorful. I served the meat with the green salad and olives suggested in the recipe and also had garlic parmesan mashed potatoes. A white and wild rice combo would also be nice. Final note: I realized at the last minute that I didn't have whole grain mustard on hand, so I used dijon. It was delicious, but I suspect whole grain could have made it even better. Happy cooking and eating!

I followed this recipe exactly, and wouldn't change a thing. It was the juiciest roast chicken we've ever had. We served it with a loaf of rosemary bread which was perfect for dunking in the delicious sauce.

This is the best roast chicken recipe that I have ever used.The sauce is pretty awesome too. I had leftover sauce and two days later, I sauteed chicken scallops with mushrooms and then added the sauce--we had another delicious meal.

This is so good. I made it just like the recipe with the salad and everyone loved it. I will keep this forever to serve to guest. It turned plain chicken gourmet.
