Haven't made the recipe yet, but wondering about the strange comment in the intro to the recipe- how can fennel be considered a legume? Legumes make seed pods (with peas or beans inside), fennel is in the Umbellifereae (has a flower like an umbrella) family (also known as Apiaceae) which includes vegetables - parsnips, celery, carrots and lovage, and herbs- dill, cilantro, anise, asafoetida, cumin, and others among several thousand species so I'm wondering if the term legume is being mistakenly substituted...

I thought this was OK, but not something I'd want to make again. For some reason, I was expecting something sweeter.

easy to prepare and delicous, have made this three times, most recently with low sodium chicken broth (Swanson) and am very satisfied.

We're adventurous eaters and have had a hard time finding good fennel recipes. I used this recipe as a basis for a meal when we got a bulb of fennel in our CSA box this week--cooked one medium bulb of the fennel per the recipe then added shrimp at the last minute (which I guess would make this a completely un-kosher meal), served with a salad and bread. Even before the shrimp was added, there wasnt really a "sauce" as much as a glaze, but the recipe got 3 forks from both myself and my husband, who grew up in Italy.

While not to my taste this was a very big hit with my Israeli in-laws. "Just like Mom's" which is high praise indeed. The recipe makes a lot, I used 4 fennels cut into 6 wedges each and it was enough for 8-10 as a side dish. I reserved the garlic and returned it to the pot at the end. The fennel turns greyish when cooked but that seems unpreventable (?).
