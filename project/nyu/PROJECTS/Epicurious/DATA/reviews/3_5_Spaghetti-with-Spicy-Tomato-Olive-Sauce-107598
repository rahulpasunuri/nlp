I didn't have olives, so I substituted capers, and left out the extra salt. I also added extra garlic. Delicious, quick and easy.

Just a great little dish. Light and very tasty. I served it to 4 people and two of them had seconds. Will make this one again often.

I used green chili instead of the red pepper. Next time I think I would use diced tomatoes and add my own onions because the tomato chunks were large and did not break up easily.

Last night I used 2 cans of no-salt added diced tomatoes, so 1/2 tsp. of dried hot pepper flakes was almost too much heat. Replaced any salt with 4 anchovy filets. Added a sprinkle of dried oregano (can't imagine a spaghetti sauce without it). Added the olives and 3 oz. of sliced fresh button mushrooms at the very end of the cooking time so that they wouldn't disintegrate. Twelve ounces of dry spaghetti was more than enough. A very quick and easy weeknight meal when served with a green salad. Definitely 4 forks!!

A little shallot, butter, white wine and sugar and this recipe is then good. To basic for me. the shallot and wine adds a complexity, the sugar takes care of the acidity and the butter helps the pasta coat and gives a velvety texture.

Very easy and quick meal, good eating. I did miss a bit of flavour though, the tomato-pepper tast is very nice but gets a bit old about halfway, maybe some more herbs in the mix next time, oregano or thyme maybe?

This isn't very good. It tastes largely like canned tomatoes and gets dry after the first day.

what a great recipe to have up our sleeves!

Excellent quick fix when realization hit that we had no sauce in the house. Added extra peppers...we like it hot! Added my own meatballs to simmer for a long while, had good bread, better wine. Definitely will make again.

I used kalamata olives instead as my husband and I prefer those. This is an awesome sauce. It may even prompt me to stop buying canned sauce all together.

Very easy to make. I've served it to company and got rave reviews. I do not use 3/4 teaspoon of hot pepper. I use 1/4 teaspoon and let each person add more if they desire.

I added about a pound of lean ground beef to this recipe to entice my boyfriend to give it a chance, he really enjoyed it! I also accidentally added 3/4 TBSP red pepper flakes instead of 3/4 TSP - this actually was very good and not too hot. I would definitely make this again.

The sauce had a wonderful deep smoky flavor that surprised me, considering how few ingredients were in it. I made less pasta than was called for, 12 ounces instead of 16 ounces. I will just make 8 ounces next time. Very quick and easy. The only work was pitting the olives.

Fantastic sauce! Quick and very yummy, much better than what you would find in the store. Even friends who don't care for olives loved it.

I thought this was a tasty and easy sauce, but I will not mix in a whole pound of spaghetti next time. I prefer a greater sauce to spaghetti ratio. Besides, for whom does 1 lb of spaghetti yield only 4 servings???

This was good--perfect for a night when you want something fast and easy. Everybody cleaned their plates. The stewed tomatoes make put this on the sweet side, so be warned if you like your tomato sauces purely savory. I reduced the olive oil to just a splash and I'll keep it that way next time since we don't like oily pasta. I would have given it two forks since I like it but don't love it quite as much as some of the previous reviewers, but it gets brownie points for being fast, really easy, and inexpensive to boot!

I made this for the gang last night and just loved it;its healthy and flavorful; definately a keeper!!

This is a terrific recipe! My husband doesn't like olives so I just use green peppers instead. I also add about a 1/4 lb. of turkey sausage. It's hard to believe that such a simple recipe is so deliciously satisfying. I usually don't like a sauce with a thinner consistency but this one is great and packed with flavor.

Much as I hate to be the lone dissenting voice, we really didn't like this very much. My husband and kids asked that I don't make it again. I followed the recipe as written.

Rating: 3
I didn't believe, until my husband made this, that such a simple recipe could be so delicious. Normally he tinkers around with recipes but for once agreed to do it 'by the book',just to satisfy my curiosity. What a great mid-week meal! We'll be making this again and again. Just needs a crisp green salad, crusty bread and some robust red wine and you could serve this to anyone.

Rating: 3
how easy can you get? I had friends over for an impromptu mid-week dinner and this sauce practically made itself as I chatted away in the kitchen. After breaking up the tomatoes, I left it to simmer and the consistency was great. It was a little hot for me, so I might decrease the red pepper flakes, yet I didn't really measure, so shame on me! Much better than bottled sauce with minimal effort.

This was quick, easy, good. Leftovers were good also. Topped with toasted pine nuts, will make again for sure.

Easy to fix, very tasty. Try a little extra red pepper to really spice it up.

I agree that adding anchovies and capers would be a nice, traditional touch for another night, although this was simple and delicious as is. You may also wish to consider using Pecorino-Romano cheese rather than Parmesan - Pecorino is stronger, more pungent, and better able to stand up to big flavors like those found in this dish. The only change I made otherwise was using whole no-salt-added tomatoes packed in juice (crushed before adding to the pan and maybe compensating with more spices/minced garlic/salt) instead of stewed tomatoes: this way, you can control the saltiness, spicing and texture of the sauce, and have the satisfaction of knowing exactly what went into your dinner.

Made this last night for supper. Boy is it good! I cut amount of red pepper flakes in half because the family has a sensitive palate. Easy tasty weeknight meal using stuff that I usually have on the shelf.

What a delicious recipe! We are trying to lower the fat in our diets and are (usually) die hard meat eaters. This recipe is delicious and I felt like I cooked a gourmet recipe. I too, added a few fresh mushrooms and served with fresh french bread and tossed salad.

Yeah, emilii, you must be an excellent cook because being an excellent cook has nothing to do with understanding ingredients, and their merits. And, making fun of their people according to their geography is not small-minded? Please.

This simple recipe was delightful.And this is a person who likes meat. Added a little white wine before the sauce thickened. Have made it again and shared the recipe with friends. Thank you

Dear (typical small-minded flatlander) Chicago: nothing is "essential" to any recipe. Creative people know that. Substitution of ingredients to improve recipe is the sign of an excellent cook. Something which you most certainly are not.

This had much more flavor than it would seem. Of course, I did follow suggestions and added onion, more garlic, mushrooms, capers, anchovy paste and a little tomato paste. Still very easy to make, with pantry ingredients. Will be making again.

My boyfriend made this in no time this weekend. It was so flavourful and so easy to make. So few ingredients and very little work. This looks to be a classic at our house. We stemmed fresh mussels as an accompaniment.

I'm no gourmet chef by any means, but I like to pretend like I'm one. This recipe helps me maintain my cover. It's quick, easy, elegant and tasty. Those are the most important elements for me (emphasis on the first two). Really good. Thank you.

I served this to company, and they loved it. I used kalamata olives and I agree that sliced mushrooms are an added touch. I did add Italian tomato paste, which resulted in a thicker consistency that I prefer.

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious and very simple! I made it as written, with only the addition of a bit of anchovy paste. I served it over Spinach Linguini which was wonderful and pretty. To Mahwah, NJ: if you want to thicken the sauce you might try adding Italian Tomato Paste until you reach the desired thickness. Although that will change the flavor of this recipe it should still be very good. I would think regular Tomato Paste might add too much sweetness.

Made this for the first time tonight. Instead of any anchovies, I first fried 1/2 pound of Jimmy Dean's pork sausage in a non-stick skillet, and broke it up as it cooked; then added water to the broken up cooked sausage, and fried this mixture again. Drained it very well to get rid of excess fat. Then added the garlic, red pepper, olives to the skillet,and fried this mixture until the garlic was golden brown. Never needed to use any oil, or any added salt. Used 1 can regular diced tomatoes and 1 can of no-salt added tomatoes (which I had to chop). I feel that this version of the original recipe is a bit lower in sodium and fat than the original recipe, and it was WONDERFUL!!! Yum, Yum

This had a great flavor, the olives were a nice touch. But, the consistancy of the sauce was missing something, maybe i just like a thicker sauce. Tastes great, but next time, I don't know, does anyone have ideas?

I loved it. I added 2 anchovy filets, while sauteing the garlic and olives. Used Greek cracked olives and drizzled Ravida olive oil over the top of each dish prior to serving....mmmmm.

I would actually give this 2 1/2 forks if I could, but not 3. I didn't find it THAT wonderful, but it is a good sauce that you can whip up quickly. (I followed the recipe exactly.) I tried it as a pizza sauce, and it worked wonderfully for that.

Rating: 4
Very easy, very tasty. I definately would go with the anchovies. They add a flavour that combines well with the olives and other ingredients. I would however; use a richer wine with it. Crusty bread and a rich reserva rioja or valpolicello rather than something sharp. The flavour of the ingredients are sharp enough and the rich wines balance.

Rating: 4
WOW!!! was this good. Very simple but GREAT tasting. I did substitute anchovies, 3 filets, for the salt. I added ½ lb of ground beef and a few extra olives. My wife thought it was a little hot. She asks that the next time I cut back on the pepper flakes. 4 forks up!!!

I agree with those who suggested turning this into a puttanesca sauce with the addition of anchovies and capers. I made a further addition: a good teaspoon of whole green peppercorns, the kind that come packed in vinegar. With the anchovies, you'll want to omit the salt (at least till you taste it), and maybe the cheese, too. Don't skimp on the olives, in quality or quantity! Of course, this is no dish for a subtle wine. Maybe a slightly-too-young Chianti Classico, still a bit on the harsh side, or a young Barbera. A green salad before, and something rich and chocolate for dessert (since the meal is otherwise reasonably low in fat, especially of the saturated variety), and everyone should be happy.

Easy, DELICIOUS and full of rich flavor! I was expecting good, and thought, "yeh, I've done this many times; I know how it will taste. So what's new?" Man, was I wrong! The flavors were well-balanced for our palates, with nothing competing over the other for dominance. It "came together" in the most agreeable way! A salad, maybe French or Italian bread, and, (poof) a classic, fast, flavor-rich dinner. Don't be fooled by the simplicity!

Good sauce but the original and best is still a savory puttanesca (or meretrice) sauce prepared with all the above ingredients plus some chopped anchovies and capers, true Neapolitan style.

Rating: 3
This pasta sauce is good, but is even BETTER if you add some chopped anchovy fillets after the garlic/chili has been sauted. Also add capers in w/ the tomatoe and simmer for a long time.
