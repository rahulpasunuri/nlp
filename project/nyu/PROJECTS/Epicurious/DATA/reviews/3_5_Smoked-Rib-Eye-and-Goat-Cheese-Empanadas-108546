I've made this a couple of times. Once for a party, and once for family. Turned out great both times. My only complaint is that the first time they were a little doughy. No biggie, just rolled the dough a litle thinner and larger (more filling = yummy in the tummy) I may try to deep fry them next time to see what happens!

This recipe was a great starter for empanadas. I refrigerated the dough for at least 30 minutes and it held together beautifully. I used Special Crabmeat instead of the steak. My only comment would be to not roll the dough TOO thick. It was a little hard to roll the dough any thinner than 1/4 of an inch and after baking time, I felt there was too much dough and not enough filling. the flavors were great and I love the color the paprika added to the dough. I will use this recipe again for any kind of empananda my clients may want!

The flavor was okay, but for the labor involved, not worth it. The dough kept falling apart, so I refrigerated it and then it held together to get them made.

This is a great recipe, but I think I would have liked them better if I had added more cheese.

They were excellent. I did not own a grill at the time so broiled the meat in the oven. The empanadas were still wonderful, even good the next day!

I made this the other day and used sheets of phylo dough (from the freezer section) What a breeze! The kids were pleased! And now if I could only stop the sneezes (pollen count high) I also tossed a few capers in the Cuis. along with a dashes of fresh cilantro and ginger (now available in tooth paste tube format) Life is good out in the hood. I may try anchovie paste next.

This is my first 4 fork rating. I've made them twice and everyone loves them. Must marinate over night and use wood chips to smoke the meat. Cook the meat to rare, as it will cook more when it is in the skillet. I prefer bigger chucks of meat, so I chop, not dice, the meat. Use high quality tomato paste (you can taste the difference). To save a little time, I use butter flavored biscuits dough instead of making them from scratch. The goat cheese makes it different which makes it memorable.

Similar to the first reviewer, I have never made empanadas. These turned out fantastic! The recipe was easy to follow and the dough was very easy to work with. My only suggestion is to mix the dough in your food processor in two portions, unless you have a very big one. The flavors were fantastic and the presentation was beautiful! Letting the steak marinate in the spices is definitely key!!! I didn't even use angus or NY prime and the steak was very juicy. Will make again and again!

This was my first time making empanadas, and I when I read this recipe, I thought that they would be difficult to make. It wasn't at all. They were so flavorful and actually easy to make. I should have rolled out the dough a little bit thinner, but other than that, they were superb! I think the key steps are to marinate the meat over night, and to use the mesquite woodchips to bbq the meat. My guests loved them.
