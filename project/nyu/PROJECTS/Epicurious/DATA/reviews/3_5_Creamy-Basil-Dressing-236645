We used slightly more vinegar and left out the salt. Even the 7 year old thought it was great.

This was surprisingly good for a dressing with no oil. I am impressed. I didn't have white balsamic, so I used regular balsamic. As soon as I saw the strange color of brown that this turned the dressing, I see why the recipe calls for white, but it tasted great regardless!

We really enjoyed this recipe. Used low-fat, Greek-style yogurt, maybe this helped smooth out the acid flavors.

Too watery and too sour. the yogurt has some tang to begin with I would cut the acid way back on this recipe the flavor was flat.

Great flavor, fat free and only 8 calories. The fresh basil and balsamic are a great marriage. I take salad for lunch every day. This will be a staple.

I must disagree with the previous reviewer. When made with very fresh herbs, this is a delicious low fat dressing. I recommend using low rather than non fat yogurt.
