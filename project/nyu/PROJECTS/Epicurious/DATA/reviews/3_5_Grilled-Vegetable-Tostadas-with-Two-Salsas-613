I've made this twice, now; once according to the recipe, and once completely differently -- I just made the oil mixture, put it on veggies (I used little italian eggplant, long green peppers, and onions), grilled 'em, and served them on nice hamburger rolls with a spicy mayonaise. (I use mayo mixed with chili garlic sauce, but anything would work).

I loved this dish. Two changes I made: Instead of the ancho chilies - a few dashes of tabasco sauce. I sauted instead of grilling. Make the salsas the night before. I still crave it!

When I first read the ingredients for the recipe I was a bit skeptical that it wouldn't be very flavorful. But I was wrong! This is definitely a keeper! I didn't make the Tomato Chili Sauce and instead made a Spinach Picante Pesto. I served it with mexican rice and black beans. And I followed the other reviewers recommendation of throwing the tortillas on the grill. DELISH!

A very good recipe for outdoor entertaining. Don't let the length of the instructions deter you. Make the salsas ahead, grill veggie and keep warm in a foil pan on the edge of the grill. Brush tortillas with a little oil and throw on the grill, no need to run in and out or mess with the oven.
