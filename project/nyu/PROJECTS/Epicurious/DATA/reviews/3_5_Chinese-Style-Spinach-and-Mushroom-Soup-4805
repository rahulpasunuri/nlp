Gave it 4 forks because it scores well on 3 key metrics - it's easy, delicious, and healthy. And I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Made exactly per recipe except I saw too late that I was supposed to add just half the bag of spinach and dumped the whole thing in. Won't do that again - a little too leafy but still yummy.

Yummy soup. No rating because I made a number of changes. I used chicken stock instead of veg stock. I used thinly sliced chicken instead of tofo. I added chinese noodles during last 5 minutes of cooking. I added snow pea during last couple of minutes of cooking. I added just 2 tsp of sesame oil during last 2 minutes of cooking.

Excellent soup - made as is written, but added the sesame oil at the end. The perfect blend of tastes that I'm looking for in Chinese food, but a better experience because I made it at home!

Made this exactly as is except I omitted the tofu. It was very tasty!

This was just very delicious and couldn't be easier. I am surprised by how truly tasting and filling it was. I did use frozen spinach and I added frozen corn as well which worked beautifully. Perfect for an easy after work dinner and just delish.

To Cook from New Delhi... it sounds like the problem was with the spinach you used--the best recipes can be ruined by old or inadequate ingredients.

After reading all the fabulous reviews I decided to make this soup but it turned out to be really bitter. I used home made vegetable stock and Kikoman soy sauce. I didn't have rice vinegar so I didn't put it in and I added the sesame oil at the end as suggested. I chopped the spinach before I put it in - could that be that reason it turned out so bitter? Absolutely terrible!

As a regular user of this site, I've made many recipes from it that I've been exceptionally pleased with, but this amazingly tasty soup has finally moved me to write a review. I followed the recipe, using Better Than Bouillon vegetable base and also rice vinegar (cider vinegar does not have an Asian-enough flavor to me). I used regular Kikkoman soy sauce and my husband, who is sensitive to too much salt, had no complaints about that and loved the soup as much as I did. Because the one thing I didn't have on hand was tofu, I substituted a few vegetable pot sticker dumplings that I'd had in the freezer, which worked perfectly and, for us, are much more appealing than tofu. I can't believe how delicious and nourishing this soup is, especially considering how easy it is to make.

Based on the reviews here, I used chicken broth, lite soy sauce, 1 Tb of rice vinegar, bok choy and added sesame oil at the end. No tofu and I forgot to buy pork/shrimp so it was just veggies.Using an entire head of bok choy and 8 oz of mushrooms made it a nice chunky soup. My husband, who is not a big fan of soup, could not stop raving about it.

This is a light quick soup. I added a thinly sliced carrot and a 1/2 package of "Chinese noodles". I don't know the name of the noodles, they were white and just said "Chinese Noodles".

I was amazed at how simple the preparation was, and how nourishing the result. A definitive "do-over" on chilly winter days.

We loved this soup! Sometimes you don't need anything elaborate or difficult, you need something simple, easy and quick to make and nourishing. This was it.

We thought this soup was delicious. As some other reviewers suggested we used bok choy instead of spinach which was a great suggestion.We also added some red pepper flakes for some heat.

I've made this soup a dozen times, each time adding a new ingredient (i.e. boc choy, different kinds of mushrooms, edamame, udon noodles, kale, etc.), and it's always delicious. The broth base is really perfect for any kind of asian vegetable combo. It's also cheap and easy to make, and everyone I've made it for has loved it.

Needed to bring the soup course to a Chinese Murder Mystery dinner...my husband and I being the only non-meat eaters attending - thought I'd introduce tofu to the crowd! The soup was good, not great, but fit the bill! Interesting reaction to the tofu!!!

Leave out the spinach and use bok choy!! It is much heartier and stands up to the intense heat and makes this soup perfect. Used light soy sauce and had no problems with the salt. Nice with a dash of red pepper flakes too.

Enjoyed this light tasting soup. Will try to find a way to reduce saltiness next time (different broth or less soya). A few shiitakes are also a nice addition.

Absolutely delicious, and so easy! I didn't use the canned broth either, just veggie bouillion cubes and the required amount of liquids. A keeper for sure.

This dish was okay, but the broth developed a bitter flavor that was not entirely pleasant. Very quick & easy, but not really worth eating.

Rating: 4
Really easy and delicious. I used bok choy because that was what I had and added the sesame at the very end. I didn't mind the salt, but it might have been the soy sauce I had, and the fat-free vegetable broth made it very diet friendly.

Rating: 2
The taste of soy sauce was overwhelming even though I used the milder reduced-sodium version. I would recommend cutting the soy sauce down to 2 tsp - 1 Tb to prevent it from overtaking the entire dish. Otherwise, this recipe offers much potential and room for creativity.

This soup was amazing! It completely made up for the disgusting Long Bean Salad (a real yuck-o; also on this site) I made to go with it! Next time I might use extra vinegar even.

A little salty for my taste, despite using both reduced sodium soy sauce and reduced sodium chicken broth. (Didn't have vegetable.) Nevertheless quite tasty and easy to make.

Just made this with mushroom broth and it's excellent. Also, I recommend rice wine vinegar over apple cider vinegar - the latter gives it a funny taste.

I would leave out the spinach next time b/c they got too wilted and actually slimy, but otherwise this is delicious and easy!!! Especially good with a 1/2 t of hot chili-garlic paste and some added salt/pepper. Yum!

I really loved this soup! I used shiitake and regular button mushrooms. I also added a handful of soba noodles. YUM!

A wonderful, easy to make dish. We have Taiwanese friends who are vegetarian and eat no garlic or onions, and this was still and excellent soup, even minus the garlic and onion. Would recommend this to anyone. PMH

I loved this recipe! I served it with a more vietnamese style by having a plate of lime wedges, basil leaves and bean sprouts available to add as desired. I also added some rice noodles. Delicious!

Served this as a first course for a Chinese New Year dinner party and it was a big hit. Have since had it as a main course for a family dinner. Wonderful flavors. Love the ginger! As suggested, I added the sesame oil at the end....perfect.

I would rate this "three forks" if it didn't have the tofu. I'm not a big fan of it and this recipe certainly didn't change my mind. I would make it again with shrimp. Other than that, the recipe is very flavourful, quick and easy. I incorporated a few suggestions such as cutting back on the rice vinegar and soy sauce as well as adding the sesame oil last.

I love this recipe. My dad (who is an excellent cook,) couldn't stop raving. I left out the tofu.

I made this by the recipe; except added the oil at the end. I was surprised by how much I loved it. Fabulous flavor and not difficult to make. Great main course soup - perfect for the next dinner party with your veggie friends.

We make this in Chinatown East (Flushing, NY)every day. This is not the way to make this dish. Some lo-fan must have written this. Use Thin Soy (low salt soy) to begin with. Use 1 tbsp vinegar. Use no more than a tsp of sesame oil, add it last, and to taste. NEVER use spin.-in-a-bag. Use fresh spinach or Bok Choy or Bat Choy (cleaned well and julianed or thinly sliced).

This soup was great, but it wasn't as low-key as I had hoped. I think it calls for too much vinegar and sesame seed oil. I was also surprised that the recipe said to put the sesame seed oil in so early as Chinese cooks usually put it in last. Guess what? The Chinese cooks are right. I would try putting it in with the tofu and spinach. I also added a lot more of the large ingredients than was called for, and that was very nice. All in all, this was wonderful.

I've made this dish a few times with several variations. One change I will always make: chicken broth, not vegetable broth. Also, to make it more of a one-dish meal, I add rice noodles towards the end. Be careful not to water it down.

I was very excited about this recipe upon reading the reviews but found that it did not deliver- I substituted shrimp for the tofu but I think the problem was that I did not like the soy sauce taste in the soup- I was a little heavy for such a delicate soup.

We had guests from the orient and they said this was Americanized but we all loved it. Everyone took secounds. I had extra mushrooms so I threw them all in. I used a broth that was made from a vegaterian base, Plantaforce veggie boullion. I thought about the delicate taste of the ginger in this soup for days. A must repeat.

Yummy, I did add more of almost all the non-liquid ingredients - I like more soup chunky. It could also use some spice, but adding more ginger and garlic help.

I really liked this soup. I used chicken broth as I can't stand canned vegetable broth, but I thought the results were great. I added extra mushrooms and a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes for some heat. I will make this one again.

I added 1/2c merlot and simmered that with the white wine before adding about 1/2c chopped, smoked salmon. I think the combination added the boost in flavor that was lacking.

A real husband-pleaser. Used chicken broth, and being non-vegetarian instead of tofu used saute'd strips of lean pork, and added handful of cooked bay shrimp at end. Great alone or over scoop of rice. I insisted Hubby taste before his usual dose of hot sauce, and he didn't want to add anything!

Using chicken broth is a must! We also add either chili/garlic paste or just chili paste. Gotta have the spice!

This is a staple in my repetoire now. A quick, tasty, very good for you soup. And I have always made it with chicken broth as it is great flavor enhancer; canned vegetable broth is awful, homemade vegetable broth would probably work well though.

I thought this soup was rather bland and sexless. If I ever make it again, I think I would try it with chicken or beef broth, perhaps more ginger, and maybe the addition of some red pepper flakes.

This soup was great!! I accidentally made it with arugula instead of spinach and it tasted fantastic. The arugula added just the right flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

I found this recipe very satisfying. I know this is not "traditional", but to make it into more of a meal, I added about 1/2 cup cooked brown rice to 1 cup of soup. I also mixed fresh collard greens in with the spinach which I found superior in flavor and texture once cooked.

It was fast, easy and accurate. I've made it with both homemeade and store-bought stock and found it was richer with homemade, but still good with store-bought. It's a teriffic companion to stir-frys and curries.
