Easy and excellent results. I did not use premium cocoa nor did I sift it. It still came out great. Kids and adults loved it. It makes a lot of chocolate fondue - I mistakenly doubled it and had way too much for 10 people (although it was delicious as left-overs). Definitely will make this again.

Loved this! Made it for a children's party and it made everyone happy, including the adults. I added about 1/8 cup of extra heavy cream, stirred constantly and it came out smooth--- not too thick.

I was glad for the info on heating the corn syrup mixture to 220 degrees. The flavor of this fondue is rich and super chocolatey. But I wasn't 100% enthusiastic about the mouthfeel, a bit too slippery for my taste. Clearly the corn syrup method isn't my favorite.

Made it exactly to recipe (except I used tap water instead of spring water) and it was really terrific.

Yum, yum, yum - and easy! I was following another reviewer's suggestion to simmer until the temp reached 220 degrees, but it was taking a really long time, so I gave up around 205 degrees, which worked out perfect. We had it with strawberries, bananas, and marshmallows (for the kids) - big success with the friends we had over for dinner.

A classic recipe. I will definitely make this again, but would pay more attention to the consistency of the chocolate. Noone noticed but it was a teeny bit lumpy (which I credit to me and NOT this wonderful recipe)...

Made this at Christmas for the kids -- only with dark chocolate (same brand) -- and it was outstanding. Rave reviews from kids and adults alike - and very easy! We're making it again today for the Super Bowl. Go Steelers!

Absolutely delicious - sinfully rich! Made this for New Year's Eve and used Valhrona cocoa powder and Callebaut 60% chocolate (as it is significantly cheaper than Scharffen Berger and I don't think it compromises quality at all). Boiled sugar syrup until 210 degrees before adding cream. Consistency was perfect for dipping fruit and homemade marshmallows.

Rating: 2
I read previous reviews and cooked the sugar syrup until it reached 220 degrees as suggested...maybe my thermometer was faulty? It had a very thick consistency. I had to turn the temperature on the electric fondue pot up really high so the chocolate would have a thin consistency to dip fruit in, but then the chocolate was so hot that everyone burned their tongue. Bummer. We ended up spooning the chocolate over the fruit onto plates...tasted wonderful but defeated the purpose of fondue. Would not cook sugar as long next time. You can always add more chocolate to make it thicker, but thinning it out is a challenge.

I've made this recipe several times, and it is fantastic! I like to add about 1/4 cup of pear brandy and flambe it just before serving. It makes GREAT leftover chocolate sauce for icecream too :-)

This is a great recipe. The cook below who gave it only one fork has obviously made it wrong. The chewy texture is due to cooking the sugar syrup to too high of a temperature. Candymaking can be difficult that way, but that is the obvious problem for that reviewer.

In the interest of being a do-gooder, I wanted to respond to the cook from Alexandria. I have found the chocolate fondue holy grail, and will pass it on to you. It is Michael Chiarello's chocolate fondue recipe on foodtv.com. Bittersweet chocolate, cream, wine...it is heaven. Not to take away from this recipe which I'm sure is a good one, I hope I'm not being a traitor to epicurious! I have given the same rating as alexandria so as not to affect the overall rating of this recipe.

Rating: 4
I too reduced the syrup for about 12 minutes until about 220 degrees and everything worked like a charm. Here's a little bit of advice for those dealing with food allergies. The Scharffen Berger chocolate is perfect b/c it contains no dairy and is not processed with nuts, dairy, etc. (**important: this is only the case when you buy the 9 oz. baking bars. The smaller bars are wrapped on machines that also wrap nut/dairy products). My daughter has severe food allergies, but we were able to make this using the Scharffen Berger and simply substituting the cream for soy milk. I am sure it is not quite as good this way, but I am a major foodie without allergies and it tasted great to me too. I finished it with a bit of good quality vanilla extract and I think that balanced out any residual soy flavor (there wasn't much anyway with the intensity of the chocolate).

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC! I followed the 220 degree advice and it turned out perfect. I think going with the superior chocolate is worth it. Also, in addition to the usual strawberries, bananas, etc., I made coconut balls (shredded coconut held together with sweetened condensed milk), peanut butter balls (those of you in the mid-west will know the Buckeye recipe), and rice krispie treats cut to bite size (I just bought those) The leftovers are wonderful - take a spoonful right out of the fridge...did I say that? Yummmmm.

I brought this fondue to an informal NYE party, and everyone loved it. It was very good, and I used high-quality chocolate, but I've made better and I can't seem to find the recipe (I swore it was on Epicurious). I'll make it again if I still can't find the holy chocolate grail. Edited to add: Thank you to the reviewers who recommended the perfect temperature -- I do not think that the sugar mixture would have turned out well if I hadn't followed your advice :)

Following the directions, I had a perfect fondue. I added the recommendation to heat until 220-just before the sugar syrup phase, it took a while on medium heat, around 20+ mins. I suspect it would have been runny had I not done this. The Sharffenberger semisweet dark chocolate definitely adds complexity. I made it a day ahead with no problems--my kids cleaned up the pot with satsumas--yum.

I can't believe people didn't like this recipe. I can only conclude from thier texture complaints that they made it incorrectly. I followed the previous reviews suggestion and made sure the temp reached 220 degrees. The consistancy is wonderful and flavor decadent.

Exceeded the expectations of a gourmet foodie. Doubled the recipe and served a party of 40 with a bit leftover. Find the scharfenberger chocolate - it takes the dish to a superior level. Cook the sugar syrup until 220 degrees and follow the rest of the recipe exactly to get perfect results. Can prepare a day before event and reheat on the stove, or in the micro, without sacrificing quality.

Rating: 4
The fondue came out nice and rich and thick. Delicious. Served it with strawberries cut in half. Used ghiardelli semi-sweet dark chocolate and cocoa. Took suggestions from other reviewers and cooked the syrup longer (17 mins) until it had a thicker consistency. Presented the strawberries with sifted powdered sugar on top. 5 of us ate it and had left overs.

Rating: 4
This was incredibly fabulous! Be sure to follow the other comment about cooking the sugar syrup long enough. I've made this twice and it's to die for! Perfect thick texture, coats the fruit and goodies perfectly. Also, lasts almost forever in the frig, so whatever you don't use immediately, save it and reheat for later.

Love this chocolate recipe!! I've never tasted such pure fine chocolate flavor. I splurged for the expensive choc blocks, and a medium splurge for the choc powder - it was worth every last cent. I made it directly in my electric fondue pot. It does make enough for at least 10.

This is a fabulous recipe. And yes, it freezes beautifully. And do be prepared to freeze it. One batch easily can feed 12 people and if other dessert items are around would probably feed 20. I made a double batch for a party of 35 and then we used it as topping for ice cream for 10 people and I still have a lot in the freezer. ANd I sent at least a pint off with a friend. But it very very tasty.

This was the best chocolate fondue I ever had. It came out so much better than those recipes that are just melted chocolate and cream. It makes a ton though. I halved the recipe and still me and my husband were eating it for 3 days!

This is a great recipe and quite easy to prepare. I substituted different brands of good quality chocolate. The only problem I had was that it made far more than indicated. I doubled the recipe for my 12 person dinner (including a lot of chocolate loving kids) and I could have easily served another 15 people. I hope it freezes well.

This was creamy, thick, rich and smooth, just the way a chocolate fundue should be. I added the zest of an orange to add a little complexity, and used ghirardelli chocolate & cocoa powder. We dipped "Wendy's Biscotti" (also from this site), along with cubed french bread (YUM), apples and bananas. De-lish!

I made this with strawberries for a potluck at work and EVERYONE loved it. I love chocolate, especially dark chocolate, and decided to try the recipe exactly with the premium chocolate and cocoa (why not huh? which by the way, they sell at Safeway). If you love chocolate, this will be the richest and most amazing thing you'll ever eat.

this is excellent as fondue but also makes a perfect hot chocolate sauce for ice cream or cakes. i've used this recipe repeatedly because an encore is so frequently requested by those who've tried it.

Rating: 4
I think the trick with this recipe to ensure it is not thin, is cooking the sugar syrup mixture long enough - you need to do it until it reduces and thickens (and reaches the appropriate temperature). Sort of similar to making caramel or other sugar cookery. If you don't cook caramel long enough, you just get thin sugar syrup. Keep cooking the syrup mix until you get the right consistency otherwise it will never thicken later in the recipe. YUM! I need another excuse to make this!

I had same experience as previous reviewer. Ok, a little thin...and more steps/ingredients than maybe necessary? Next time I'll try one of the simpler versions on foodnetwork.com.

This was a hit at my New Year's Eve party!!! I just recieved my grandmother's fondue pot so I wanted something tasty and fun. I didn't have the forks so I made it to go with biscotti and french vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it! I used Hersheys cocoa powder and Giridelli semi-sweet chocolate. Out standing dish and I plan on making this again. I know my friends will be expecting it again! You could even make this ahead of time but it was fun doing it while our friends were visiting in the kitchen! Wouldn't change a thing!

I made this for a New Year's Eve party and it was a HUGE hit!! Very yummy with a variety of foods - marshmallows, pretzels, bananas, apples, pound cake.

Outstanding! Made this for Christmas Eve and it was delicious. But you must use good chocolate. We used Scharffen Berger because one family member is lactose intolerant and that chocolate is dairy free. Our family loves their chocolate. Also, we used lactaid free whole milk in place of heavy cream with great results. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
Tasty, but not memorable. We used regular chocolate, so maybe that made a difference (Hershey's cocoa and Trader Joe's chocolate chips). My husband commented that it was somehow "dry" -- maybe this was because of the cocoa? We halved the recipe and made this as an easy weeknight dessert for two of us, with strawberries and canned pineapple for dipping. We had plenty left over.

Rating: 4
Wow!! Easy and so delicious. I used Lindt 70% chocolate, Droste dutch cocoa and Cadbury milk chocolate (as there were children, so that was my token "non-richness" gesture!). Mine actually turned out too thick, but it was easy to add water at the end to thin it out. It was nearly black and tasted fantastic with a range of fruit ... can't wait to get home tonight and eat the left overs! (I only made 1/2 the recipe and that was more than enough for 4 adults & 2 children!). It beats just melting some chocolate to dip in, and don't even compare chocolate syrup from a bottle with this piece of heaven in a dish!!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I used Ghiradelli chocolate and premium cocoa. I substituted half and half for the heavy cream. I added 2 tsp. orange liqueur--very subtle--add more if want more flavor. Also, this made a huge batch--probably enough for 8-10. I served it with strawberries, raspberries, and angel food cake squares. Very romantic!

I've made easier chocolate fondue recipes, but none that tasted as good! I've done it twice, and I can say the Scharffen Berger chocolate and cocoa defintely make a difference if you're a chocolate connoisseur! I served it with strawberries, pound cake pieces, banana slices and almond biscotti.

I really enjoyed this recipe, however I altered it a little and it came out delicious. I used 1/2 semi-sweet choc. chips and 1/2 milk choc. chips and substituted fat free half and half instead of whipping cream.

We made this as specified in the recipe, with the change of hersheys cocoa in place of the fancy cocoa. Everyone thought it was incredible. If you love dark chocolate, then I don't think you can go wrong with that fancy SB chocolate! It does have the consistancy of a thick chocolate sauce, but I thought that made it great for dipping. You don't have to worry about it turning hard as it gets cold etc. We used fruit and little dutch carmel waffles for dipping. Next time I think I will also try little biscotti!

Very big hit on Valentine's Day! A hint to get the consistency correct: Boil the sugar, corn syrup and water mixture to 220°F. This will make the recipe easily repeatable.

This was very good. I rarely follow a recipe exactly, but I did stay pretty true to this one, with the exception of not using the expensive chocolates and using drinking water from our water filtration system. I used Hershey's cocoa and Baker's semi sweet chocolate. It came out nicely thick. Perhaps the people who had trouble with it coming out thin didn't cook the syrup hot enough before continuing with the other ingredients?? We dipped ice cream balls, pineapple, strawberries, bananas, angel food cake, (plus marshmallows for the kids). Everyone enjoyed this immensely.

I had such high hopes for this recipe. I didn't even panic when it was a little too thin. I waited for it to thicken up overnight and it didn't happen. I even added flour. No dice. The taste was good but it was a drippy mess (all over my tablecloth). The kids ate a lot of it, but I threw a ton away. Crushing.

This recipe is a definite winner! We skimped a bit on the ingredients...in fact, we didn't have any of them, so we opened up a bottle of Hershey's chocolate syrup (the kind with the easy pour top) and it worked out great! We had it at a bridal shower and the guests can't stop talking about it. YUM!

This recipe was easy and fun. I cheated though and used milk chocolate chips instead of fine chocolate. I also used a whole bag of chips which made it wonderfully thick.

I liked this recipe, but wasn't overly impressed. The final result was something akin to a bittersweet hershey's syrup. I think I'll keep looking for other chocolate fondue recipes to see if I can find something that is a little more like melted chocolate instead of like chocolate syrup. To me this is almost more appropriate as a warm desert sauce... In fact, I'm keeping the leftovers for use on ice cream tomorrow!

Rating: 3
Take heart, Seattle, you are not alone. I cooked the sugar syrup for 10 minutes, and the end product looked like Hershey's chocolate syrup. I repeated the process, cooking the sugar syrup for 15 minutes, and got the same results. Interestingly, I preferred the taste of the second combination of chocolates - Ghirardelli sweet cocoa and Baker's bittersweet baking squares, what I had on the shelf - vs. the premium. After sitting overnight, they did indeed reheat well, and the consistency was perfect! Caveat: Plan ahead.

I am not sure if it was the recipe or our cooking techniques, but this did not turn out well for us at all. It came out watery and never quite congealed. I did use the suggested type of chocolate and the spring water. (For Northwesterners, it can be found at Larry's market.) Part of the problem might have been when we cooked it, we decided to give the fondue a head start by first heating it on the stove. I think the choclate might have gotten to warm and the situation just went down hill from there.

This was delicious!!! I was surprised at how filling this was. I used poundcake, marshmallows, pineapple and cheesecake as dippers. The fondue was made the day before and I reheated it the next day.
