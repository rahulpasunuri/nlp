We made this recipe as written and loved it. Next time we would omit the tomatoes as they are a "typical" salad ingredient and did not really add anything unique to this salad. We liked some of the others' suggestions of different ingredients and also thought toasted walnuts would be really good to try. Also made our own dressing (balsamic, olive oil, splash of maple syrup and pepper).

Yum! I omitted the tomatoes and made the balsamic vinaigrette from scratch. This is a keeper, and so easy!

Yummy! Definately make your own vinaigrette-as another reviewer said, it literally takes three minutes and is soooo much better! Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Oh I almost forgot, I did add diced avocado and a little fresh chopped dill. Highly recommended!!

Excellent...I followed one of the other reviews and made my own balsamic dressing. Did not add the peppers, and thought the dish was fabulous. Will definitely make this one again!

Delicious and simple. I used a champagne vinagrette instead of a balsamic. I sliced the hearts of palm, and let them marinate in the dressing while I assembled the salads. I didn't have peppers, but I did add the eggs that had been pickled with the beets. Very yummy. We will be making this again.

I served this as a first course for 4 last Saturday nite. My guests do not like blue cheese so I made this with coarsely grated Asiago. I also used arugula instead of mized greens, and used 4c loosely packed. I made my own vinaigrette: 2T good balsamic, 3T ev olive oil, 1t grainy dijon, 1T finely chopped shallots, s&p. They were crazy about the salad and wanted the recipe!

Easy and delicious. I used yellow bell pepper for great color.

I enjoyed the recipe. I made my own balsamic vinaigrette and I'm sure it made a positive difference. Making a dressing from scratch ALWAYS results in a better product and literally takes 3 minutes.

Super easy and great. I made it for a dinner party when I was spending so much time on the main course that I didn't want to bother with a complicated side dish. I made this with bagged salad greens, canned hearts of palm, jarred beets and pre-crumbles blue cheese (very lazy). Everyone at the party loved it and asked for print-outs for themselves with extras for friends and family. (I can't even remember what the fancy main course was!)

Excellent salad. My husband refuses to eat beets so I left them out and added them to mine - fantastic combination of flavors! I unsuccessfully tried to convince him it was worth trying. I'm making this again tonight.

My husband who likes just the basics kept saying "I cant beleive I'm eating beets, this is really good".

Absolutely delicious - I wouldn't change a thing. My family raved about it. Have made it many times! I used Maytag blue cheese and found it superior.

A fun blend of tastes. I will definitely be making this salad again.
