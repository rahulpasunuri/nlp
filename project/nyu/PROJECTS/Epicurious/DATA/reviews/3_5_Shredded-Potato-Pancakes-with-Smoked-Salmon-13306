It was good. Only, I added the smoked salmon to the potato mix before frying, as well as cut up green onion. We ate it as a go-along with eggs benny. Excalent!

Don't know what the big deal is. Seems like a big waste of time. Faster, tastier and much much easier to toast up a baguette and spread whipped cream cheese + salmon. Add red onions, capers, lemon zest, whatever if you want.

Delicious. Looks like the mixture will fall apart when you are frying the potatoes, but it doesn't. My guests loved them!

Great comfort food. I, too, added an egg for binder, as well as added fresh dill and lemon zest. I added lemon juice, capers, and fresh dill to the sour cream, and used hot smoked salmon because that's what I had.

What a simple, yet fabulous recipe! It's now become a tradition in our family. I use one egg per pound of potatoes to help bind them together. A few finely chopped green onions on the sour cream looks nice & tastes great. I need to make a double batch to keep them from disappearing too quickly!

This recipe has become a tradition in our house as a New Years Eve appetizer. Even folks who say they don't like smoked salmon or caviar scrape their plates. Can't be beat for sophisticated taste and dazzling presentaton. Can't wait til 2003 when I can make it again. PS Making my own creme fraiche was a bust. Just stick with sour cream.

Simple and delicious. Watch the temperature, they may have a tendency to burn if you leave the heat at medium-high. Use a well-seasoned cast iron pan and they won't stick at all.

My mom made this years ago, from that original issue of Gourmet! It was really good--she sprinkled red caviar on top, which added color and flavor. My family also adds an egg to the potato pancake mixture when we make them.

Deee-licious! Made it as an apetizer for dinneron New Year's Eve 2000 and it was quite festive and tasty. Served it with a dollop of caviar.

Yummy! Gotta love that Jewish comfort food. I added an egg to the potatos to help bind them together. Additional serving suggestions: applesauce; sliced cucumbers tossed with plain yogurt and fresh dill.

Another big hit from Epicurious. I used hot smoked salmon instead of lox and put the sour cream on the side with a small amount of capers. Everyone gobbled them up. Make sure your oil is plenty hot or they will stick to the pan.
