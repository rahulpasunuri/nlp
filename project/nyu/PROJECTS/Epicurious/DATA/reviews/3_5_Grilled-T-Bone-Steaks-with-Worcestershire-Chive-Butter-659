I am a big fan of herbed butter so I was very excited to find this recipe. I didn't merinate the steaks, I just seasoned them with sea salt and fresh ground pepper and grilled them with hickory chips for smoke and charcoal. Made the butter with thyme instead of chives for a more herbed flavor and put a spoonfull on top of the steaks fresh off the grill, then sprinkled fresh grated parmesiano reggiano. I also grilled portabello caps stuffed with garlic and treated them the same as the steaks fresh off the grill. This went wonderfully with a fresh spinach salad and merlot. YUM!!

we hated this recipe. we are disappointed that we must put "one fork" and can't put zero. we like other recipes from this site (esp. steaks w/ shallot sauce) but this was so bad we threw away the butter and drowned the steaks in salt and pepper. my boyfriend said, "i've never tasted anything so bad in my entire life." we ruined our 10month anniversary dinner with this recipe. don't let that happen to you.

Wasn't awful, but way too much butter for my taste; the steak doesn't need it. (And this is coming from someone who loves butter.) May try to work with these seasonings again without the butter.

Yum! This was so good and simple.

I usually rub mustard into my steaks before grilling. The Worcestershire sauce and mustard makes a nice flavor on the grill. Regretfully, I was so excited to taste the steak, I forgot the butter... Next time I make steak on the grill, or even in the broiler, I will make a note here. HOW could I forget the BUTTER????

Ignore the part of this recipie on the steaks. Just choose your favorite piece of beef for the grill & grill it the way you like it. What makes this spectacular is the butter!!!! We thought it was a perfect amount of worcstichire sauce. I've used the butter over & over with all types of steaks and it gets rave reviews every time. For special dinners for guests I place the butter in molds or use a cookie dough press. So simple & they're always impressed!

Love this. The butter was very good. May try a little more mustard next time. Good & easy recipe.

In essence, the steak will be as good as the quality of meat that you select...BUT...the worcestershire-chive butter will lift it to the top of the "favorites" list - GUARANTEED! Easy to make, the butter adds an extraordinary flavor to the meat. A favorite with my husband. TRY IT!!!

I gave this 4 forks because not only was it very flavorful it was easy and can be made in advance. I served the steaks for dinner guests last night and everyone loved the flavor of the butter. I brushed the mustard/worcestershie mixture on both sides of the meat and let it sit in the refrigerator for several hours before we ready to start cooking. We have a very hot grill so searing the steaks sealed in the juices/flavor of the meat - they were wonderful and so tender. I used 1" thick porterhouse and only cooked them for 3 minutes/side for medium rare and they bordered on medium.

EZ recipe. I agree w the critique that said a little too much worstershire taste. I wonder how it would be w steak sauce substituted - the sweet would balance the mustard real well. Will try that next time. And, as said before, the quality (and thickness) of the meat determines the outcome.

As others have pointed out, this recipe is entirely dependent on the quality of the steak! Here in Birmingham, I have difficulty buying steak that has much flavor. Definitely not like what I grew up with in Kansas! The butter mixture is flavorful and adds a depth to the steak, without making too much of itself. I used some of it, with a little peanut oil, to fry potatoes to accompany the steak--terrific! Probably my use of this recipe will be the butter sauce as an ingredient with veggies.

Was quite tasty -- the butter though was difficult to cut without crumbling -- I'll probably take it out of the fridge a bit before cutting next time. My husband thought it was a winner!!

Easy and as good as the cut of meat you use. My husband really liked the flavor. I served it with polenta and he slathered some of the butter on that, too. If you don't have chives, green onions work well.

Very good tasting meal,but I fried the steak instead of grilling it.The worster taste was a little too strong but still very good. Try this one its a winner.

The herb butter in this recipe made the steak. We served it as the main entree at our gourmet club dinner. I used unsalted butter in the recipe and coate the steaks with our favorite Montreal beef seasoning first.

Excellent...excellent...excellent. My husband made this for our New Year's Eve dinner for just the two of us...it was better than anything I think we could have had at a restaurant.

Made this dish for my boyfriend on Valentine's day. He raved about it forever and it is one of our favorite dishes. Very tasty, and fun to make.

Very tasty. I recommend doubleing the butter mix if you plan on more than 4 people.
