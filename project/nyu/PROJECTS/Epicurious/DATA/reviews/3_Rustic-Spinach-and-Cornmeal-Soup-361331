I made this with a generous dose of roasted garlic which gave it a wonderful flavor. This is a filling comfort food - perfect for a cold winter day - and very easy to make.

I would not add any more salt than is in even low salt broth. I tasted it first, knowing how easily polenta absorbs the saltiness. It was a little too salty for me. Aside from being salty, slightly bland. But I added a shake of cayenne pepper and a tiny dash of nutmeg and it really made a difference...like a subtle cajun flavor. Probably won't make again, but good enough that I will finish the leftovers. Will say, if you are like me and keep most of these things as staples, it was a cheap meal to make.

This soup was delicious and easy to make. I definitely seasoned with salt and pepper to make it exactly how I like it. The texture was great. Very much like grits with spinach. I loved it. I would make it again for a winter dinner get together and I'll have it on hand for cold nights.

Extremely simple soup with good flavors. Makes a perfect saturday or sunday lunch when you don't have much time.

The taste was pretty good, although a bit bland, but the texture was like egg-drop soup, a little slimy. One of my guests really enjoyed it, but I probably wouldn't make it again.
