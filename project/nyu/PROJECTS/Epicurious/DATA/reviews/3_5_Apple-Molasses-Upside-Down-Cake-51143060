Made the cake and reviewed two days ago. Wanted to comment on how it 'keeps'. It's two days from when I made it and it's keeping just fine for me. I enjoyed a small piece for breakfast today. I have stored it in the refrigerator and maybe this helps the longevity. Mine isn't mushy under the apples, just moist and delicious.

My guests and I enjoyed this cake & it was relatively easy to make. I thought the batter seemed awfully dry so added some extra sour cream & milk. Even so, I thought the cake a little dry. I used 12 apple pieces & they shrunk during baking leaving a lot of empty space on top. I should have used at least one more apple. I mixed up some extra caramel sauce and added some apple pieces & served that on the side along with whipped cream. I agree with another reviewer -- you can add more spice. I added clove too. I also only had dark molasses on hand so used that and it tasted fine but I like dark molasses and it is a rather strong taste. But everyone said they liked it.

Made today for a dinner party tonight, everyone loved it served with a lightly sweetened whipped cream. I enjoyed making this dessert, really quite easy as I had the exact right cast iron pan for the recipe. I am a sucker for molasses-ginger cakes and I thought the favors of this version paired with the tart- sweet pink lady's was wonderful. All our guests enjoyed as well. Really moist and will make again!

I would add one more teaspoon of ginger.

I had some pink lady apples to use up, so decided to try this cake. It went together easily enough. The only thing to be careful of -- my pan was 10-1/2" (so 1/2" larger than required), and I barely avoided a spillover. I was nervous enough about it that I slipped a piece of foil on the bottom rack part way through. The cake had a nice flavor, and I liked how the apple pieces were so large. It's best eaten soon after it comes out of the oven. It didn't keep well at all -- the moisture from the apples caused the texture of the cake to become gummy. Although I didn't dislike this cake, I probably won't make it again. I prefer cakes that keep for at least a day (so I don't have an excuse to eat 3 pieces for dessert), and the taste wasn't fabulous enough to make up for the fact that this one doesn't.
