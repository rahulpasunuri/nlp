Basically needed something to stuff 2 acorn squash that I had with turkey Italian sausage. This recipe was a great step off point for my meal. Folded some fresh mozzarella and goat cheese into the mixture. Oh nom.

Made this last night but misunderstood the instructions because I was making stuffed eggplant at the same time. Instead of the raw sausage I cooked it with the veggies. TO THOSE WHO THINK MOLASSES IS STRONG: Based on the description, I believe they are not refering to molasses that is dark and found in New England. In Pennsylvania we use something called King Syrup and we call it molasses. It is lighter, almost like a dark corn syrup. It addes sweetness but no bitterness.

I added apples, onion, goat cheese, and mozzarella instead of the green onion and bell pepper just trying to use what I had on hand. Delicious!

This turned out better than expected. Not something I would make very often, but I would make it again. Next time I might try reduced fat sausage or chicken sausage... I used regular this time and it was heavy, had a fatty mouthfeel. But its worth playing with a little bit.

So we liked this recipe but found it really difficult to eat when using a half squash instead of rings. I can't see serving it to guests and watching them struggle with it. Any serving suggestions when using half-squashes? Thanks!

This was delicious. I thought it was a bit of a pain to cut the acorn. As per previous suggestion, I used the halves of the squash, rather than rings. I also used the maple/molasses combo. I double the filing amount, and used jimmy dean hot. Perfect comfort fall food!

My entire family enjoyed this. I am not a huge beef broth fan, so I used chicken broth instead. I used regular molasses for the first brushing and then maple syrup for the second brushing. Delicious and easy.

This was delicious! I made only a few changes to the original recipe: I made this vegetarian by using Morningstar's "sausage meal starters." I also added about 1/4 C. of diced onion. I utilized the entire squash by stuffing the halves of each squash. After cutting them in half I baked them for 20 minutes first (cut-side down on greased tinfoil). I then stuffed them and baked for 15 minutes, then another 10 minutes after the second coating of molasses. It turned out excellent!

My husband and I love this recipe! I follow it exactly and it's a great blend of sweet and savory.

I used celery instead of red bell pepper but otherwise followed the recipe. It was ok, but the taste of the molasses was prominent. If I were sure I liked molasses, I'd give this 1 fork, but I suspect that people who really like that ingredient will probably like the recipe better than I did, so I won't skew the ratings.

A great recipe with wonderful presentation. Have made this using sweet turkey sausage and ground lamb. I think the sausage is a better fit although the lamb is delicious, too. Don't skimp on the molasses!

LOVE this. My acorn squash was bad, so I had to toss it, but I used cubed butternut and just formed circles instead. Used the Chicken-apple sausage from Trader Joe's. This was the perfect amount of sweet and savory. A big-time keeper.

I sort of hate it when people rate recipes and haven't really followed them, so sorry...but this was really delicious with not TOO many changes. Instead of buying bulk sausage, I made Emeril's recipe for Chicken-Apple-Fennel sausage. I also didn't have a red pepper, so I added some sauteed celery. Just had to share as the Chicken sausage was wonderful in this dish. Perfect fall dish with a small herb salad.

Pretty awesome. no bell pepper so I used an apple instead- which was good with the molasses.

I made this today as a Thanksgiving side dish and it was a hit! I had another recipe that I was able to use the ends for, so it worked out well. I did not have molasses so I mixed some beef broth (from another review) and some Karo dark syrup. It worked terrific! I did have to cook this about an hour at 350. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this several times as an appetizer course for Thanksgiving, and every year I receive lots of compliments on the dish. I usually use a fresh chicken or pork sausage from Whole Foods for the stuffing, and I have also made portions with vegetarian sausage and vegetable broth for my vegetarian guests. I agree with other reviewers that lining the baking sheet with foil is a must. I've also found that the dish requires an extra 10 to 15 minutes beyond what the recipe states to cook fully.

Simple but delicious. Ideal fall supper. Agree that it needs more baking time -- I left it in about 50 minutes

Loved this recipe; I added mushrooms, and used sun dried tomato chicken sausage; otherwise, didn't change a thing. We "previewed" it as a candidate for Thanksgiving, and it's easily a keeper! It was yummy exactly as is! Easy, easy, easy.

Wow, that's good! All four people at dinner loved this dish. I made it with all natural pork sausage, and the slight spiciness paired very well with the sweetish molasses. By the way, "light" molasses is the same as regular molasses (I didn't know and had to look it up). I used a whole red bell pepper (about twice the amount called for), some leftover chopped onion from a different dish, and all the rest of the ingredients. Definitely use foil to line your baking sheet. Great fall meal paired with a light salad!

This was a real big hit in my family. I used chicken sausage, delicata squash and celery, instead of bell pepper. The flavor was incredible. What a satisfying Fall meal!

Rating: 4
Wonderful fall dish. I used turkey sausage (sweet) and also added celery and fresh herbs (sage, parsley and thyme). I only had dark molasses so I drizzled sparingly. As like the other reviewers, I agree with the foil lined pan and at least 50 min for baking.

Absolutely delicious... just followed the recipe exactly. I found the overall cook time to be around 40-50 minutes. Foil-lined pan imperative!

Delicious! We took the advice of other reviewers and lined the baking pan with tin foil so cleanup was easy. Even my squash-hating housemate had seconds. We used 1 cup of matzoh meal instead of bread crumbs and that seemed to work very well.

I changed a lot in this recipe based on what I had on hand, but it was excellent, and I'm pretty sure the original recipe would have been great too. I split the squashes in half, and baked the stuffing inside for a main course. I aslo subbed yellow onions and celery for pepper and green onions, and used spicy keilbasa chicken sausage with the casing removed. I also scraped the cooked squash out of the shell and mixed it with the stuffing, then put it all babck in the shell and baked it again. I got the idea for this from the "acorn squash stuffed with wild rice, hazelnuts and dried cranberries" recipe. i skimped on the breadcrumbs and I wish I had used more, this ended up being VERY rich and flavorful and Isome more bread to cut the richness would have been nice.

This recipe had great flavor and presentation for the amount of effort it took.

This was absolutely divine. I deviated from the recipe quite a bit, but covered the basics. I used sausage from a local farm, and kind of threw in everything I had on the shelves: black mission figs, a zucchini, some chopped pistachios, used a yellow onion, and couscous instead of the rice. It is great all on its own. I ended up cooking it a bit longer than required (maybe because my oven is finnicky) because I like squash to be of a stringy, melty consistency when it is stuffed. All in all, great!

great weekday recipe- prep is really 10 minutes and then in the oven for 40. I think the recipe does better with regular onions as the sweetness of the molasses could use a little competition. Also, sub in hot italian sausage to give it some kick. Great as a main dish, though I paired it with a side of wax beans with toasted almonds.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit with everyone, including some that don't eat vegetables. The molasses turned very dark when cooking, so it was not as pretty as the picture in the magazine.

This dish is just wonderful. I didin't have any bell peppers so I combined what I had around the pantry and it still turned out great. Used turkey sausage, whole wheat cuscus instead of white bread crumbs, peas, onions,walnuts and cramberries. Also used maple syrup instead of molasses. My husband would't stop eating! A total keeper!

What a hit! My 22 year old daughter enjoyed squash for the first time ever! I used elk Italian sausage in the stuffing, and the spicy taste was a great compliment to the sweet, fruity sauce accompanying the pork loin entree.

Had this as part of our Thanksgiving feast; very tasty, although I have to admit I'd enjoy this as a meal on its own. The sausage stuffing alone is good to eat (I confess to helping myself beforehand...)

This is a great recipe. I substituted celery for green pepper and that gave it a wonderful stuffing flavor. I also basted with beef broth instead of molasses. We will definitely make this again.

This is by far my favorite squash dish. I just wanted to leave a little comment to save some clean up time as the molasses burns to the bottom of the pan. Place a layer of tin foil at the bottom to trap the molasses. Wish I would have thought about it this before cooking, but oh is it worth it. Enjoy

It's a great fall dish. We've tried several other recipes for acorn squash, but this one remains our favorite! Making it the day before doesn't compromise the flavor.

Fantastic! I actually made this with finely chopped turkey sausage and it was still absolutely wonderful. I don't like molasses so I used a mixture of maple syrup and beef broth for the glaze. Will do this one again and again.

I am a vegetarian, so I used a soy sausage instead, added mushrooms and Italian parsley and the filling turned out wonderful. However, all the molasses ran off the squash and burnt to a lava like consistency on the bottom of my casserole dish.

I have to agree with Natalie. This recipe really needs to be followed exactly to get the best results. You can change it up all you want, but it's not the same dish at all. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I used very little sausage stuffing so it could remain a vegetable dish. Stuffing just accents it. It is truly a wonderful side!

Rating: 3
I took a cue from a previous reviewer and baked the stuffing in acorn squash halves for a complete meal rather than a side dish. I baked the halves first for about 30 min covered and prepared the stuffing substituting mild Italian sausage and adding plenty of chopped yellow onion and diced mushrooms. I also fully cooked the sausage with the vegetables and thus only needed to complete cooking the squash after stuffing. I added a TB of maple syrup to the stuffing and brushed the squash with maple syrup just prior to stuffing. This dish reheats fabulously well.

Yummy Yummy Yummy! I made this dish last fall for a brunch with friends, and it was a hit. It's so easy to make, and it can be served as a side dish or main course.

This was a unique recipe with a lovely presentation. I used the squash halves whole, rather than sliced and served this as a main course. I used Turkey sausage so there was not a lot of fat accumulated in the squash. I liked it so well that I had the Marriott Hotel chef prepare it for hundreds of women for an event I run. They enjoyed the unique banquet food and the chef loved doing something different.
