Though the beet/horseradish combo normally works very well, this was very bland despite using more salt and horseradish and chicken stock (instead of H2O).

This is a regular in our home. My husband and I both love it. It's quick easy and a great way to use beets. Try it.

Pretty bland. Not tasty enough to be a main course. Also be warned that your poop will be very interesting the next day.

This is a great recipe that goes together relatively quickly. Horseradish and beets complement each other very nicely and this dish is gorgeous when served with parsley and a small dollop of sour cream. Yum!

This dish was just great. I substituted sour cream for the regular cream and omitted the horesradish altogether. Serve the pasta plain, with a large scoop of the beat sauce and a dollop of extra sour cream on top. This lets guests swirl the sauce and pasta together themselves, resulting in a glorious bright majenta dish that tastes wonderful. The sauce should not taste bitter...if it does, your beets have gone bad.

I completely disagree with the reader from San Jose. This dish was wonderful! It was simple, full of flavor, and an unusual way to use one of my favorite veggies. Serve it with a simple salad, and a basket of bread for an easy weeknight meal. I plan to make it again and again while beets are in season!

I rely on Epicurious for a lot of wonderful recipes. Everyone that I've made has been delicious. This was absolutely horrible. It was very sour and bitter, kind of like that red cabbage stuff in German food restaurants. I LOVE beets and I LOVE horseradish. They DO NOT belong together. Now I see why I'm the only person to have made this! Chef be warned!
