Super quick and easy. But... too crumbly like other reviewers. Maybe reduce the flour to butter ratio may help. I deliberately under baked them at 19 minutes to see if that would help with them falling apart. Only made them because of the ingredients I had on hand and wanted to bake a treat. Flavor is fairly good with pronounced chocolate tones. Not a keeper.

I followed previous posters recommendations and added the extra flour and cornstarch. The cookies are fine, deep chocolate flavor and they didn't crumble. I rolled them into a log and chilled then sliced and baked.

This recipe was great! Like some of the earlier reviewers, i added cornstarch and extra flour, about a tablespoon of each, and everything stayed together perfectly. The shortbread had such rich flavor, all my friends and family loved it. I served it with fresh fruit and whipped cream, which balanced out the shortbread's rich flavor. I would definitely make this again!

I took another reviewer's suggestion and added 2 Tbsp cornstarch and extra 2 Tbsp flour. These came out great! I made the dough in the food processor and chilled it rolled into a log in the fridge for a half hour. Then I cut them into circles and baked on a silpat. Let cool on the baking sheet before moving them - otherwise they will fall apart. This also makes a great tasting raw cookie dough. And I used cheap cocoa - hershey brand.

What a bloody disaster! Never, ever again! It spread all over the place and turned into chocolate sand. I wish we could give negative forks...

Used a mixer and the recipe worked perfectly. Deep chocolate buttery flavor.

I am really disappointed. The flavor is good, but anything using such good cocoa would be. Even as I very carefully moved the cut pieces from cookie sheet to rack, they started to crumble and break. I would never serve these; it would be like grasping at straws if people tried to pick them up. And they aren't very attractive.

I had great success with this recipe last holiday season by adding 2T of cornstarch and 2T of flour. Otherwise it is just too fragile. I also press the dough into a pie pan and smooth like traditional shortbread. Doubling the recipe makes enough for three pie pans.

Chill the cookies after patting out for at least 2 hours before you bake them. You might also want to add about 2 TB of cornstarch. You will eliminate the spreading problem.

i decided to use this as a base for a chocolate layer cheesecake. very good, turned out just as expected. for those of us who enjoy dark, bitter chocolate - this is our special treat. sublime and delicious!

Ack! These were a disaster. I'll try them again, perhaps, but my first attempt spread all over the pan and got too thin at the edges, subsequently burning and then crumbling to unservability. I ate the results, but they were more like a well-done chocolate-flavored pie crust than cookies. I've never had so much trouble with a pie crust, though . . .

I pushed the dough into heart shaped cookie cutters, and they were very cute and very good. But it only made about five 3" diameter cookies. If I were to make it again, I would double the ingredients.

The taste was ok, but it's nothing special. I had the same crumbly problem that others had. The fork pricks melted away during baking too. The shortbread baked into just an unattractive mass (though very edible).

This was really easy to prepare and a great idea, but I also had the crumbly problem. If that could be solved, I'd definitely make it again. Also, the end result tasted notably like an Oreo cookie wafer. It's like the good news and the bad news: I mean, Oreos are yummy, but you kind of hope you can do better than Nabisco when you bake something, you know?

The shortbread turned out dry & crumbly.

Absolutely decadent, and SOOO SIMPLE! I had no problems whatsoever, and these shortbread were divine - the hit of the party! I dipped half of the wedges into semi-sweet chocolate, which was a special treat. I have no reservations about this recipe whatsoever.

When it came time to remove the shortbread from the baking sheet, the wedges broke into pieces. I followed the directions exactly, including using an ungreased baking sheet.

this turned out terrible, not the texture it should be at all. dough was sticky before baking.

Absolutely decadent! I used regular sugar instead of superfine. I recommend increasing the sugar if you are a fan of sweet cookies -- these are more chocolate than sweet.
