I was quite pleased with this recipe. I did use pumpkin seeds instead of sunflower and put in a sprinkling of golden raisins. I also used Lyle's Golden Syrup instead of corn syrup as I had made the British Flapjack recipe previously and had that on hand. Even though I have changed this recipe a bit, I think this is also good as written. Also, it is very important to let these cool in the pan or they will completely crumble. The nut and seed combination has quite an interesting flavor and I will be happy to make them again. I love that they are so easy to make as well.

Despite the crappy review I tried these out as a snack for my 20 month old daughter, who absolutely adores them... as does my 34 year old husband. They have a really good, dense flapjack consistency - I'm guessing the previous reviewer's problems came from substituting melted chocolate for 1/3 of the solid ingredients. Not really fair to write such a negative review when you deviate from the recipe so extremely... but anyway. I make these almost every week, and have now tweaked them to use grated apple for the sugar and honey for the syrup, plus a little cinnamon for a kick, and they have gone from great to PERFECT. They freeze really well, too.

I didn't use either of the nuts, instead mixing chocolate chips into the recipe (who doesn't love a chocolate dipped flapjack?) ... and the butter sugar mix immediately melted them all over the place. Not a problem, just kind of a *smack head* moment. 25 minutes was 5 minutes too long in my oven, at 20 they had already started crisping to black around the edges. Maybe I can blame the chocolate, but they didn't stay together at all, even after completely cooling. I've had better luck making an oatmeal cookie recipe, substituting oatmeal for nearly all the flour, smooshing it into a pan to cook and just calling it flapjacks.
