I'm intrigued. I make rice balls quite a bit and my kids devour them. Great technique tip here: http://justbento.com/handbook/bento-basics/making-onigiri-with-a-plastic-bag

I doubled the recipe since it was for a large party. Very time consuming to make and not worth the effort. I put a lot of extra ginger and wasabi in the rice to spice it up. The dipping sauce was very good but when you dipped the rice ball it fell to pieces so they were not finger food. I would make the sauce again to use with something different.

This appetizer looks so great plated and I heard so many raves. All of my guests were awed by the fact that I had made this. It was actually much easier than the recipie; I would suggest doing a practice batch to look for short cuts and test your own dexterity with the spoon and sticky little balls.

This dish is not worth the time

I just wanted to answer the reviewer's question about wasabi paste vs. powder. Actually both are often mixed with other ingredients, such as regular horseradish and mustard powder, and really whichever you use is a matter of preference. Most sushi bars use the powder and mix it themselves. The real wasabi is fresh and very hard to come by here in the states. There is one place to order it from, based in Oregon. They actually sell the roots, so you can grow it yourself, but they advise that you need exactly the right climate. I personally just use the powder, but I have tasted the fresh and it really is a whole different thing.

This was an interesting dish--it didn't take all that long to form, and if you're used to the process of making sushi rice was really very easy. The red bell pepper sauce was _amazingly_ good--very nice, rounded flavor; I thickened it slightly with arrowroot, and I would make it again as a dipping sauce for other things. The onigiri (rice balls) themselves were fine--a nice idea for a combination of flavors, and did look very nice, but most people at my party didn't eat more than one of them.

I made a bunch of these for a birthday party last weekend and they went over just so so. The combination of tastes just didn't seem quite right. However, they do make for an impressive appetizer visually.

Loved this because it has no frozen this/ canned that/ short cuts - reminds me of food made by friends in Tokyo. Very nuanced and interesting tastes.

I made these rice balls for a recent party, and despite the fact that they really didn't go well with the offerings others brought, people seemed to really enjoy them, and ate every last one. A word to the wise - the assembly is every bit as tricky as the directions make it sound, and it does take almost two hours to get everything party-ready. Also, I had to use wasabi powder because I was unable to find the real thing in my local market. I understand that real wasabi has a much more complex taste than the powder (which is not even real wasabi?). Any ideas on where to get the real thing?

This recipe was really wonderful! It is a little (ok, a lot) spicy, because wasabi has a massive kick to it, for everyone with a delicate palate. I made these for a party, in three batches...One spicy, one so-so, and one with no wasabi at all. Try cutting the wasabi in half if you don't like spicy foods. Good for clearing the sinuses!
