Delicious! You can also soak the cardoons with white wine vinegar for a shorter time and it prevents turning color. The batter as described is excellent. Grapeseed oil is also good for frying!

This was the first time I had cardoons. The recipe was fine, but the cardoons themselves are very bland. I've been wanting to try them for a while. They were disappointing.

If you have a pressure cooker, it is much easier to cook the cardoons this way. Put them in with a a few inches of water and let it steam for 15 minutes. Also, we always add herbs, i.e. basil oregano to the flour mixture.
