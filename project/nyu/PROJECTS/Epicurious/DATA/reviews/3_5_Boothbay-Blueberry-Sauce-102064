I just got the idea to make a blueberry sauce randomly and didn't have the amounts required for this recipe on hand, so I did a rough version of this sauce and it's amazing. I left out the orange rind and the powdered clove and I substituted corn starch for pectin. I will definitely be making this again to go over waffles and pancakes in the future!

I did not care for the cinnamon and cloves flavor. It also did not set up for me.

I made a lesser quantity (and left out the pectin), but have to say that the lemon juice makes the sauce. This is definitely a keeper.

This sauce was easy to make and went great with New York Cheesecake. I would reduce the amount of orangejuice next time by half and substitute with 3 more tbsps. of sugar and water. I thought that the juice took too much blueberry flavor away.

Simple. Used Chinese 5 spice instead of clove & cinnamon. Excellent with my homemade NY cheesecake.

Made a 1/6 portion for pound cake topping. I was worried that the clove/cinnamon flavor was too strong, but people loved it and piled more on their cake, then had the rest with waffles the next morning. Very good mix of flavors.

Just a teaspoon-full of this sauce added to a bowl of plain vanilla ice cream made a gourmet dessert !! Makes a great dipping sauce for homemade biscuits, too. I have made several pints to give away at Christmas. Highly recommended!!!

The orange and cinnamon flavors go well with the blueberries. It was easy to prepare and I find that it tastes great on waffles.
