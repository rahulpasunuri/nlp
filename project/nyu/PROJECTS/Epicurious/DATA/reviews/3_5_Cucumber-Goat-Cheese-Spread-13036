fabulous! Didn't have tarragon so used fresh basil and served as a dip with large shrimp. Also used as a topping for roasted beets. A keeper!

I have made this several times and it is always a big hit. I add 2 teaspoons lemon basil which really help punch up the lemon flavor, and I also serve it with crostini instead of crackers. I think it's really better when made a day ahead so the flavors can develop.

I have an excellent rendition of this recipe that my Grandmother makes: 1 Cucumber, 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 vidalia onion diced , salt and pepper and a little tobasco. Mix all ingredients together and serve over stoned wheat crackers. Absolutely delicious!

I agree that this recipe is very bland. I served it at a party and I overheard someone tell someone else it wasn't worth trying! Since I agreed with her assessment, I won't make it again.

I made this for a wine tasting, and it was gone in no time. I used mild montrachet and pureed more of the cucumber than the recipe called for. I also used dried tarragon and a touch of sea salt. Very good, indeed....even those who don't care for goat cheese enjoyed it. If you worry about extra flavor, try the spread on bruschetta toasted with garlic, olive oil and black pepper.

This was awesome! I think that this recipe calls for a decent goat cheese, not a standard store brand. Mine was very flavorful and my friends and I polished it off in record time. Definitely a keeper.

Very bland - I added more onion and lemon juice and some salt just to try to get more flavor out of it. It wasn't terrible, just not very good. Not worth the time and ingredients to make.
