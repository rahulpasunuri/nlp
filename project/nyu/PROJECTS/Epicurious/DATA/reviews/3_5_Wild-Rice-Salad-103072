I doubled this recipe and took it to a potluck for 30. There was plenty and it got great reviews! I agree with those who say that good quality olive oil is essential. I used California Olive Branch "Miller's Blend" and put in the full amount. It was perfect - not too oily at all. I added the mint others have suggested which gives it a nice fresh kick.

I liked this recipe. It did not overwhelm the rest of the meal which was simply BBQ'd marinated chicken . I liked the nutty & sweet flavors enhanced by some orange zest... But go easy. I emulsified the dressing in a minichop and used half the oil. If you want some zip, add some minced jalapeño to taste.

This recipe sounds like it should be really good. I took the reviews into account - the suggestion of mint is a good one - but overall the dish was still underwhelming.

Rating: 4
This dish is served throughout the year. Even my children love it. I use pumpkin seeds instead of pecans and add fresh coriander. I have had to copy this recipe everytime we have had guests because they all love it. Each time I make there are barely, if any leftovers.

I didn't have orange juice, so I used orange marmalade, about the same amount as mustard. I used a grainy mustard instead of Dijon. I used walnuts and didn't use apricots. I also added green onions. It was great warm and cold and room temp. This salad is a hit and is very adaptable.

So glad when I read the reviews before making. I followed some of the suggestions and substitutions. Only added 1/2 the oil, which was a good idea. Added a 1/2 more oj and a lot of mint. Used sherry vinegar since I didn't have balsamic in the house (what kind of cook am I?). Also used a wild rice/brown rice blend that was nice and mello. And the final result is that it's really good. Flavorful, but not overwhelming, but not bland.

I usually don't like reviews that start by saying how much they liked the recipe but then say they changed 12 things...but in this case I think many of the reviews are correct about the blandness so I thought I'd contribute what I do about this problem. This recipe is a good base, BUT it needs help and I couldn't find a good replacement. 1. 1 1/4 cups of parsley is crazy. It's too strong. Use 1/2 c of parsley and 1/2 c of mint. Mint makes a big difference. 2. only 3/4 of the dressing is necessary. Use extra orange juice if you taste the result and find it too dry (this is a great 2nd day dish, but it dries out. OJ and a bit of EVOO help) 3. I use jasmine white rice for more flavor 4. For the pecans, 2 cups is excessive and I use Epi's sweet and spicy nut recipe with added cayenne pepper (make a big batch, everyone loves them). Taste as you go. Serve room temp.

great salad. I made extra rice for dinner and then made the salad the next day. I will do this again.

I was a bit leery after reading some of the negative comments, but I went ahead and made this as a Thanksgiving side dish anyway. I cut back on the oil a little, added chopped kale (slightly steamed, about 1 minute) thus using less parsley, plus cranberries that I'd had soaking in bourbon for over a year, and added some grated orange rind, toasted pine nuts instead of pecans, and left out the white rice. Come to think of it, I guess that's a whole new recipe! And no one can say it's boring or lacking in taste this way. I liked the vinaigrette for it, as stated above. I love this way of using wild rice, and it's a great vegetarian dish for lunch.

Rating: 1
Boring, bland and generally blech. I duly noted all rave reviews and still got nothing worth serving for Christmas dinner and tons of leftovers to boot. Cut the amount of rice, doubled the dressing, added more fruits and celery for some kick and I can't think it's any better than a one forker. Not to mention that this has to be the most expensive salad I've ever made! Ended up freezing the leftovers (of which there were tons) b/c I can't bear to throw away good money. Would I make it again? No way!

Rating: 4
Did a test run for Thanksgiving and brought it in to my work. Everybody loved it (really, everyone - the hunter, the vegan, the owner, the suburbanites, the city folk - I couldn't believe the wide appeal). I believe there are 5 coworkers who are preparing it for their own Thanksgiving tables. I did all wild rice. Serving it at room temperature is definitely the way to go. And it makes a ton.

Rating: 3
i'd really give this 3 1/2 forks - it's really great - i used royal rice blend with lentils in place of the white and wild rice - i also used toasted black walnuts a couple of times - this is a great and is wonderful to take for a sick friend as well!

This salad was bland and tasteless - I had to triple the vinaigrette and add LOTS of salt to make it just OK.

Rating: 4
This recipe was so easy to make and so yummy! A crowd- pleaser at Christmas dinner. I suggest that, if at all possible, you serve it directly after making it (so it is still somewhat warm) rather than chilling it. I freshly toasted raw pecans in the oven. This recipe yields a ton of rice, so next time I plan to halve the recipe.

This is so pretty. I serve it as an hors d'ourvre inside a white belgium endive boat. Very delicious

I made the viniagrette as the recipe says, but i used a high quality extra virgin olive oil. It tastes great and is in no way too oily. I did change the rice used a bit, cooking up a 16 oz. pkg of Lundberg Black Japonica rice and a 4 oz. pkg of Wild Rice and that seemed like the right amount.

So delicious - big hit every time. I do not add the white rice.

Whenever I make this for a large party or family gathering it is a hit-especially with the men! Rather than using plain wild rice I use a blend of a wild/brown rice with the white rice. I also heeded other reviews, cut done significantly on the oil and added more organe juice. It does make a lot!

Rating: 3
Different salad. Added candied pecans with butter and maple sugar also added some maple syrup to the dressing as the initial recipe tated a bit to sour. After that it was very enjoyable.

Rating: 2
I was underwhelmed by this. I thought there was too much parsley (for my taste, although I do like it, just too much). I also thought it need more depth and punch, so I added a touch of maple syrup, an extra shallot, and some orange zest. After all that, I liked it pretty well. It makes SO much, I wish I would have had extra cranberries. Did add a few extra pecans. Took another reviewers rec. and used wheatberries, wild rice, and brown rice, glad I did, liked those 3 grains together a lot! PLus they can all cook in same pot!

Rating: 4
I made some modifications. I only used 1/2 pound wild rice and a full cup of white rice (seemed like a lot of rice). Made the rice a bit al dente. When assembling, I made the vinegrette without oil and then drizzled oil over the mixed salad after combining. I used probably less than 1/4 cup oil. Needs lots of salt and pepper. The salad tasted light and very flavourful. I used dried cherries, cranberries and apricot. The nuts are great..give great crunch that lasts as long as the salad does. Keeps several days. Made it for a BBQ which was great since I made it the day before and diddn't have to do anything but stir. Made enough for 10.

Rating: 2
It is not totally fair that I am rating this, given that I dislike wild rice, but still, as far as wild rice dishes go, I thought this was OK...perhaps if I actually liked the rice I would give it three forks. Definitely better after marinating 24 hours

I would not make this dish again. I found it to be bland, no matter what I added to it - and the dressing (which there was way too much of) contained too much oil. So it made a somewhat oily, bland rice salad.

Rating: 4
Delicious!!! Omitted white rice. Another time used 1 C wild rice medley because there was too much dressing. To toast pecans, spread in single layer in 350 oven for 8 min, stir once. Also, don't cook wild rice for more than 1 hr or it will get mushy. Rinse wild rice with cold water after cooking to get rid of any residual water.

Rating: 4
This was the hit of the bbq. I used wild rice, brown basmati and wheat berries (since that is what I had in the house). Makes a lot of dressing so you may not want to make the whole recipe. Tasted great the next day too. Use whatever dried fruit, veggies and nuts you want - I used pecans, red onion, cherries and fresh nectarines.

Rating: 4
I really enjoyed this dish and so did my company. I substituted a rice trilogy combination for the white rice, and added more wild rice. The colors were great with the multi-colored rice and the parsley, cranberries and apricots. The tastes were a good compliment to a pork with fig dish I also found on epicurious.

Rating: 3
I halved the recipe and used dried blueberries instead of cranberries, which was really yummy. I also think that chopped hazelnuts would be a nice substitute for the pecans. This dish requires a lot of salt and pepper. I also increased the amount of balsamic vinegar for added flavor. Great summer recipe!

Delicious. Perfect for winter side dish.

Best wild rice recipe I've tried!! I used 2 cups wild rice: 6 cups water in my rice cooker, which turned out perfectly. I did not make the white rice as suggested. Also, didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used champagne vinegar, which was great! Because I like to limit the amount of oil in my recipes, I made the entire vinaigrette recipe, but only ended up using half. Try a little, then taste before adding the entire vinaigrette. This recipe pairs nicely with the mango salad w/grilled shrimp recipe on this site (which is a 10++). Will definitely make this rice recipe over and over!!!

I made this for a potluck last weekend and everyone loved it. I am making it again for a BBQ this weekend as well. It is nutty and delicious. It does not need about half the dressing that it calls for...but the dressing keeps well. Also, I added some Laura Chevre goat cheese and it was quite the wonderful flavor combination! :)

This makes tons; I wonder if the 1 lb wild rice is a typo. I doubled the amount of dressing and was glad that I did. I served this to 22 women at a shower luncheon, and there were leftovers. If I were making this for a smaller group, I would try 1 Cup wild rice, keeping dressing as is. It did get rave reviews!

This was a hit at a recent potluck dinner. The flavours blend well together and create a truly delicious and refreshing salad. I did not add the white rice as others suggested since it makes plenty using just the wild rice. I will certainly be making this again as friends and family raved. It's good heated too! Definitely give this one a try! It's excellent.

Fabulous recipe that I will make forever more! I use equal parts of white and wild rice. This is a year-round dish -- I served it at a cookout this summer (without the cranberries) as well as at our Thanksgiving buffet. Talk about rave reviews! It is delicious, and folks appreciate the flavorful 'treasure trove' of ingredients that work so well together. Yes it makes a lot, but that's great -- more left overs for me!!

Great salad. I will make again, but not for awhile. It makes a TON of food. Asked 1 person if she thought it would feed 12. She laughed & said "Yes, but they couldn't have eaten for a week & wouldn't be having anything else. As suggested below--eliminate the white rice, cut the wild to 1/2 a pound (about 1 1/4 cups) and double the dressing to serve 12 people. I premade the rice & froze. Thawed & mixed up the night before. Poured about 3/4 of the dressing on when making & the last 1/4 just before serving. Hint for cooking wild rice: Heat oven to 450 degrees. Rinse rice several times. Spread rice in 9x12 cake pan. For EVERY 1 cup of rice, add 3 cups of boiling water. I usually make it with beef or chicken stock. Cover tightly with foil. Place pan in oven. Turn oven off & leave over night. Perfect fluffy rice every time. UPDATE FROM 7/28/03: I froze some salad just to see how it would do. Couldn't find a reason not to. Just thawed some out for lunch. Perfect. Just like the day I made it! What a salad!

I've made this salad several times, all to rave reviews. I've made a couple of minor changes. I use 2 Tbs of balsamic and 2-3 Tbs of red wine vinegar to give a little more kick. The balsamic alone was bland. I also use Trader Joes California Medley (basmati, brown and wild) rather than the long grain white rice. This is a phenomenal recipe, but it is definitely for a party. It makes enough to serve an army.

It was a perfect salad with a cookout and great sub for the good old roasted potatoes... I recommend to half the wild rice, drop the white rice, and leave the dressing as is, without halfing it, and add a hand full of golden raisens.

I have now made this five or six times for large parties. It is not only delicious but beautiful. I put in half again as much dried fruit than is called for. I also make half again as much dressing because the rice soaks it up. It is a perfect recipe for a large crowd and I, too, had many requests for the recipe. With grilled salmon in an orange glaze sauce, it is gorgeous on the plate along with a citrus cole slaw, the perfect meal for family and guests.

This is a terrific recipe! Try using 1 cup instead of 1 pound of wild rice -- it may be a typo in the recipe. I used about 1-1/2 cups wild rice and it made more than enough. Rave reviews from my guests and my husband (good thing, as we ate it for days after the party).

Truly awesome!! I made this as part of a birthday buffet for 100 people, and it was perfect. Ditto to the reviewers that said this makes a ton -- it's perfect for large gatherings. Got many requests for the recipe. I just used apricots - no cranberries (couldn't find them in bulk). I also used a little less oil in the dressing, more OJ, and a little sugar. The dressing is so good I could eat it with a spoon! Made it in the blender and the shallots were pureed which gave it a great consistency. I mounded it on a big platter and garnished with lots of whole apricots and whole pecans on top! Delish!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's bithday dinner, and it turned out great. I couldn't find shallots in my local grocery store, so I used spanish onion for a similar flavor.

This is a great salad that works well with a variety of entrees. I use only wild rice (the brand I use includes the useful tip to stop cooking the rice when it looks like a just-opened hot dog bun) and add a chopped red pepper and a sliced scallion (in lieu of the shallot).

This salad is really great, but I wish the wild rice amount was specified in cooked cups, because wild rice can really vary on how much it expands in cooking. My one pound made way too much rice, and I kept out about four cups before continuing with the recipe. I also just put thinly sliced shallots in with the rice instead of the dressing.
