I made this because of the great reviews it received, but I was not impressed and several of my guests left most of it on their plates.

Tried this and really liked it. But, it was rustic. I wanted to prepare it as a first course for a more sophisticated dinner party so I modified it (frenchified it!). I added 2 bay leaves, the chilies, and the garlic to 2 bottles of Rioja, plus one bottle of clam juice. I then boiled off the alchohol and added that to a couple of pounds of slightly salted, pork neck bones browned in olive oil. That simmered for about 3 hours, uncovered and until reduced by 3/4, and then was sieved over the raw, cubed pork - in this case, cubed pork roast, and let rest overnight. The next day I removed the fat, and I simmered the pork in the marinade, plus paprika and salt, until tender, and then removed the pork. I added crushed tomatoes and let the liquid come to a simmer, and then cool. This liquid was sieved to remove the pulp. I adjusted the seasonings, added the pork, the clams, and mussels (a guest was allergic to shrimp), then the olives (halved, lengthwise) and the parsley. I added some chopped tomato. It was served over rustic italian bread crutes, rubed with garlic, and with additional bread. Was it better than the original? For the presentation I wanted, yes. The taste was a bit more wine than tomatoes. The essence of clam was also excentuated - a good thing. Everybody loved it!

This is ridiculously good considering how easy it is. i skimped on the marinade time and substituted frozen scallops for the clams - nonetheless it was surprisingly excellent.

Very simple. I used frozen chopped clams instead of clams in the shell. And increase the amount of shrimp. Also, it helps to brown the pork before you simmer it. Just reduce the cooking time afterward.

The cook from Georgetown must have been crazy. Every time I make this, I get rave reviews (I must have made it 7 or 8 times by now). Sometimes I make a wonderful French bread to go with, and I often serve it with couscous to sop up the juice. Even my kids love it (2, 5, and 7), so be brave and try it out.

Disgusting. It might have been the wine, but I'm not going to try again to find out.

I wasn't so sure about this recipie when I read it but since I had all the ingredients on hand, I decided to give it a try. I was very impressed at how well the flavors melded together. Delicious and very Mediterranean, I served this hearty stew with crusty french bread.. will definitely make again
