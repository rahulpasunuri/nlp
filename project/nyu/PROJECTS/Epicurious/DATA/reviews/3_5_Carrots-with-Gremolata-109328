What a flavorful surprise for my guests when they crunched into these colorful carrots! A perfect side for a spicy meatloaf.

Made this last night as part of an experimental dinner - Only variated it by roasting the garlic first. I thought fresh garlic would be an overkill based on what I was serving it with. Everyone loved it and I look forward to making it as the recipe calls for.

I'll be making this again. I liked the lemon zest and garlic flavors.
