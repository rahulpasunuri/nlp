Such a simple recipe. Made this with my 2 year old granddaughter and she thoroughly enjoyed cooking. I was concerned that it would be too sweet; it was perfect, a little sweet, but that is a matter of taste and a lovely texture. This however is a cake and not a bread:)

Great recipe! Made this banana bread on my lunch break (it was THAT easy) and it came out perfectly. This will definitely be my go-to recipe for banana bread from now on. :)

Rating: 4
This is the best banana bread I have ever tasted! I took some of the reviewers' suggestions and used 1/2-cup granulated sugar and 1/2-cup light brown sugar (C&H). Then, I added 1-3/4 cups mashed banana and 1-teaspoon vanilla with the egg. Also, when baking at high altitude, you have to add more seasonings for extra flavor. So, I added 1/2-teaspoon baking powder to the dry ingredients, as well as 3/4-teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2-teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg. I also opted to use 1-1/2 cups chopped pecans instead of chocolate chips. Finally, I sprayed the loaf pan generously with Pam with flour and sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top of the dough, along with some finely chopped pecans before baking the bread. Delicious!

This recipe is easy-peasy and delicious, and I didn't even put in the chocolate chips. Instead, I sprinkled in some nutmeg and allspice (like another reviewer suggested), and I added a 1/4 cup of pecans for interest. To increase moisture I added a 1/4 cup of plain greek yogurt. I only had 3 bananas, but it was fine! It is the best banana bread I've ever made to date, and I've been searching for the perfect recipe for the past couple years - moist, flavorful, and awesome.

Amazing as muffins, with toasted walnuts

Rating: 4
I was looking for a quick recipe with ingredients I had available at the moment (butter, unfortunately, not being one of them). I substituted the butter with vegetable oil, used only 3/4 cup sugar, added cinnamon, and 1/4 cup flax seed. Afraid it might be a little dry, I added a "healthy" Tablespoon of applesauce. I did not add chocolate chips. I made muffins instead, so the cook time varied greatly 15-20 mins. I think they turned out great. They were moist and flavorful and as flax and cinnamon are good for you, they're a little on the healthy side.

My go to banana bread recipe that always receives rave reviews.. thanks for sharing!

i toss in a little bit of oatmeal to add to the health factor. not too much - or its gets dry. maybe 1/4 a cup? and i follow other advice - lighten up on sugar, use a bit of whole wheat flour in place of white. when i add choc chips - i do so at the end when the batter is in the pan. i sprinkle them in middle, then use a knife or toothpick to blend in. why? i found if the chips touch the glass side of the pan, or remain on top of they batter they tend to burn. this way i make sure they are spread within the batter, but don't touch the bottom or sides.

2 years later and still my most requested goodie. Thought I would share my twist..( I already do 1/2 brown and white sugar - scant; 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a whisper of almond extract) Sub applesauce for bananas, a cup of finely diced apples, add Hersheys cinnamon chips ( I never measured - say 1/2 a cup) and top it with a vanilla glaze when it is warm from the oven = Cinnamon Roll bread. They fight for this too!! Enjoy.

Add my vote for flexible. I made this with my young children, so we had several modifications: 1) only 3 bananas, two brown, one firm, 2) used about 2/3 a cup of mixed brown and regular sugar, a squeeze of honey and 2 shakes of the cinnamon jar, 3) 1/4 cup of canola oil rather than butter, 4) two small eggs, and 5) (by mistake) we used baking powder rather than soda. Sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top and baked for 1 hour even. 75% eaten by 5 people in less than 12 hours. I really think this recipe is hard to mess up.

Amazing and simple! I make this for work, gatherings, or just because.... and it goes fast. My one word of advice, I've never used bananas that were too black. They were 3+ months old, shrunken, and almost pure liquid. They honestly curled in the bowl as I squeezed them out of their skins. Brown piles of.... Well, it was a risk. But it was the best batch ever. I now regularly keep 5-10 blackened bananas in the fridge. Friends comment that I need to clean out the fridge, but only until they taste the amazing bread. (Yes, I know you can freeze them, but they only get better as they age.) I always use 4 bananas, reduce the sugar slightly, and sometimes add a dash of nutmeg or other warm spice.

Funny story...after this bread was in the oven, I found the melted butter in the microwave - completely forgot to add it. And STILL this turned out to be delicious and moist. It only took 45 minutes.

Absolutely excellent, in fact better, using gluten free flour. Try dried fruit that's been soaked in water or your favorite tipple in place of the chips. DOES STICK when doing gluten free; grease and flour pans well, and protect with foil after first 15 minutes.

This is a wonderful and super easy recipe! My 3 year old daughter and I make it all the time with the following healthful modifications. Whole wheat flour, half the sugar, coconut oil instead of butter, 1 tsp. Of cinnamon, chopped walnuts and topped with a light dusting of flaxseed meal. It's probably a little more dense this way, but delicious. Top with peanut or almond butter for a satisfying snack or easy breakfast.

I didn't have enough bananas so I substituted greek yoghurt (a few scoops) and added an extra egg. I also added the almond extract, as suggested by another user, and some walnuts because I didn't have chocolate chips. It was the best banana bread I've ever made! Not dry and good flavor.

A great simple Banana bread recipe that uses only ingredients that are always in the pantry. I made as instructed but cut the sugar by 1/3 of a cup as others have suggested and plenty sweet. My 3 year old helped, this is a very quick simple recipe that is great to have kids participate in. Perfect go-to Banana bread recipe.

Excellent recipe. I sometimes add slivered almonds to the batter for a little extra crunch and a taste/texture that is different from walnuts. It's always met with rave reviews. You can feel comfortable reducing the sugar a bit - particularly if you're adding the chocolate chips. You really can't go wrong with this one.

This is an exceptionally easy recipe! I had a new friend coming over for tea in an hour, looked in my cupboard and found I had nothing to serve. This recipe was a savior at the last minute, and it turned out great! I added 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips (put in too much because I was in a rush!) and didn't bother with nuts (because I was afraid my friend might have a nut allergy, which turned out to be the case). I think I'll cut back on the chocolate chips next time I make this. It's so ridiculously easy to make, it will now be my go-to recipe when my bananas are ripening too quickly!

This is my second most requested treat..my twist is: no choc; scant 1/2 cup each brown and white sugar. 1 tsp vanilla = a drop or two of almond ext.

I used to use this recipe, but found the recipe "banana bread" from Gourmet magazine in 2003 to be much better. The bread come out with much better texture simply with an additional egg and some slightly different instructions (which I think made the difference).

This is THE BEST banana bread ever. My 4 year old grandson started every day with a piece during his last visit. Just to make it slightly healthier I reduced the sugar to 3/4cup, substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for part of flour and added a handful of chopped roasted walnuts to the batter.

I have tried so many banana bread recipes, and they were all "okay." However this one truly is amazing. It is so moist and so easy, I will make it again and again. Because of personal preference, I added 3/4 Tablespoon cinnamon, and then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top. Will return to this recipe again and again.

Rating: 4
Great recipe and very simple! So moist. Other than substituting half the flour with wheat flour, I made this according to the recipe. Next time I will leave out the chocolate chips and add nuts and raisins or cranberries (maybe coconut). Not that the chocolate wasn't good, I am just not a fan of chocolate in the morning :) I would rather taste the banana flavor more, the chips made it taste too much like chocolate cake - which isn't a bad thing, if that's what you want. I'll bet it would make a great bread pudding served hot with a nice caramel sauce (or ice cream on top).

Just about the best banana bead I have had. I added about 3/4 cup of pecans. I think I will reduce the sugar next time.

Not sure why but it is either feast or famine at my house for bananas. We go through periods where I cannot keep enough of them in the house alternated with periods where they just sit and sit. When that happens I always pull out this recipe. Fast and easy and the kids absolutely love it.

Excellent recipe and so easy to make. I cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup because the bananas and chocolate chips make it sweet enough. Also I make it as muffins instead of in a loaf pan - bake for 25 mins in a 350 oven. Delicious - my kids snarf them down!

The beauty of this one is its simplicity. It's nearly as easy to follow this one-bowl recipe as it is throw out those brown bananas! I took it to work, and it disappeared into the mouths of my very grateful co-workers. If you want to, add a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses for a richer flavor. But, really, it's delicious just the way it is.

Agree with others. This is a great Banana Bread Recipe and so easy to make. My loaf pan is a emile henry stoneware and seems to cook hotter than metal. So I preheated oven to 350. Put in bread and turned down to 340 for 40 minutes then turned up to to 350 and baked another 25 minutes. It was perfect!! I used 4 bananas. My nanna's were not quite ripe enough so I put then in a brown bag with an apple and folded over the top. In 4 hours the bananas ripened to the right level. The apple trick I found on the web...something about a gas that emits from the apple. It works.

This is the easiest and best banana bread! I grew up with my mom making banana bread every week and I threw her recipe out the window after making this one! Definetly use 4 bananas and check your bread around 40 minutes- mine is usually perfectly browned and moist around that time.

I LOVE this recipe! So simple but so delish! I've never made it with chocolate chips, but instead use fruit (fresh or frozen) and nuts. The banana size makes a difference in the texture, ranging from light and fluffy to dense and chewy, but it has turned out great every time. Mango and pecan are the current faves... I have to buy extra nanas to guarantee over-ripes for this recipe...

This is a great easy recipe that I've been using for sometime now. Just this weekend, I made this with two very ripe bananas and about 2 cups of frozen blueberries, into a muffin pan and baked for 25 minutes. It never fails. Next time I'll try it with bread flour as one reviewer suggests.

I added 1 tsp of vanilla, one tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. A scant cup of chp walnuts finished it off. You can really play with the flavors.

I keep meaning to review this recipe - I've been using it for about a year, and make it at least twice a month! No need to change anything, it's perfect as is. I have tweaked a couple of things to personal preference as I've gone along, but absolutely not necessary. It works best with 4 bananas, and I've cut back to 1/2 - 3/4 c sugar depending on how ripe the fruit is without really sacrificing taste. I omit the chips too. Lately have been using bread flour and I like the consistency a little better. I've made them as muffins too, 20-25 min and they're perfect. My go-to recipe :)

I made this recipe on a whim, not wanting to waste a few bananas that were becoming too ripe. I choose this recipe because I happened to have all ingredients on hand. Thinking it was too simple I was wowed at how great this bread came out. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding a dash of Cinnamon. Took 10 mins to put the batter together and get it into muffin pans. Baked it for about 25 mins. The final product smelled great, tasted even better. Loved the crunchy top and softness of the inside of the muffin. Tasted as if the recipe should have been more complicated. Loved it!

thanks to all the folks who recommended adding a dash of nutmeg. Cinnamon and vanilla of course too. I took it a step further with a teensy dash of cloves. A great fall inspired banana bread. I also divided the batter and added dark cocoa powder to half then created a marbled effect. yum!

this banana bread was delicious! nice and light inside-i'm not a fan of dense, oily breads. i added half a tsp of cinnamon, a few shakes of nutmeg, and a half cup of toasted pecans. i also halved the sugar...i think it would be extremely sweet with the whole cup! overall a great recipe. has anyone done it with half applesauce/half butter to make it healthy?

I make a batch of these muffins nearly every week because it's now the only muffin my family will eat. They are so easy to make. I do however, make the following changes to improve the nutritional value: 1) substitute whole wheat pastry flour for white flour 2) use only 1/2 cup of sugar 3) use 1/2 the butter and add 2 TB applesauce 4) add chopped walnuts. Muffins take about 20 minutes to bake and freeze well.

Totally yummy. More like a cake than a bread - it is very sweet. The seasonings looked bland in the recipe, so I used 1/2 light brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, added some cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and VANILLA. I never bake without vanillas. Will definitely make this again.

I think I've memorized this recipe by now, the number of times I've made it. When I see overripe bananas, it's sort of an instict to absentmindedly turn on the oven and put some butter to melt. I literally have this in the oven before it's done preheating and even realize I've made anything! Also great to do with kids. I do halve the sugar...particularly if you add chocolate, it's really quite sweet enough with the ripe bananas. However, I've also substituted canned pumpkin in place of the banana and in that case I go for the full cup of sugar. Freezes beautifully, but rarely is there any left around to freeze. Many times I've made mini- muffins with this if short on baking time.

So incredibly easy to make and comes out unbelievably moist and delicious. I made 2 batches (1 with walnuts, 1 without). I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup with 1 batch when I used 5 bananas and I used 3/4 cup sugar when I used 4 bananas. Balances out the sweetness. Next batch I'm making, I'll be adding chocolate chips. But it's looking like this will be a weekly tradition at my house.

This was very easy and excellent. Because my husband is not allowed butter, I used vegetable oil (corn oil) instead of the melted butter and I did not use chocolate chips (though I know it must be excellent).

Extremely simple recipe, great results. I just made it for the second time. I doubled it, and made half into muffins (only baked those for half an hour) and half in a bread pan. I realized halfway through the mixing that I am out of eggs, so I subbed a little bit of cornstarch for binding and a couple of tablespoons of sour cream for moisture and it still turned out great.

I have been to Australia many times and always look forward to my Oz banana bread. I have tried to make it back home but nothing comes close, until now!!! My daughter, who is very much a beginner in cooking, has just made this Banana Bread and it is the best tasting bread outside of Oz. In fact, it is almost as go as. We left out the chocolate chips but added a teaspoon of cinnamon. Really tasty. As linder023 said, made this in a round cake tin. Nice one, will def make again, probably when this one has gone. Later tonight then, might add walnut bits!

I had low expectations making this recipe, but had some extra bananas so figured I'd try it out. Wow!!! What a great banana bread recipe. This is the first banana bread I've ever made that has great flavor and doesn't burn on the edges. I didn't have a bread pan, so I actually made this in a round cake pan @350 for 30-35 min. Turned out perfect!

THE BEST banana bread ever! (Minus the chocolate chips) So quick to make (in one bowl, by hand) that it's often ready before my oven is preheated! The most difficult part of the recipe is waiting for the bread to cool before slicing!

I agree with reviewer sarah: 'alarmingly easy' and so good! I add nuts instead of chocolate, and I have never had any leftovers for a second day. My 3 boys (11-15) can't get enough of it. I have bought extra bananas specifically to ripen them for this bread. Yum!

Rating: 4
It's almost alarming how easy this is. I did it with a four year old and we got many measurements slightly off and it still came out great. Instead of 4 bananas we used 6, about 3/4 cup choc chips and baked in a round pan for 55 minutes for family movie night and it was a huge hit! Produced a dense, not too sweet just right "banana cake" Highly recommend it as a kid activity.

followed everything except I was short by 1 banana... quick and easy - if you need a good enough banana bread in a hurry to feed that craving or to save that banana from going bad - this is it...

Excellent and easy. I omitted the choc chips and took another reviewer's advice and sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top to make a nice crust. I like that it's not a soggy banana bread, but firm on the top and moist on the inside.

I too added cinnamon and sprinkled the top with brown sugar after reading other reviews. In addition I made 3 other changes: (1) I also used only 1 banana but (2) added 10 medjool dates, chopped then mashed after soaking them in boiling water which I poured off. My final change was (3) the addition 1/2 cup of coarsely ground pecans. Incredibly delicious!

This is delicious, simple, quick, capable of many variations. Great banana flavour, nice crumb, not "wet".

Great recipe! Like others, I added some cinnamon, and substituted 1/3 cup whole wheat flour. I used white chocolate chips, which were great with the banana flavor. Next time, I'll reduce the amount of sugar used.

Based on other comments, I also added a tsp of cinnamon and used 1/2 c. sugar and heaping 1/3 c. of brown sugar. I omitted the chocolate chips though and it was still delicious - not too sweet, but tasty.

Very easy recipe! So moist that it would make a great cake by adding a chocolate ganache to the middle and top...just have to double the recipe. I added a lot of chococolate to the batter and I am salivating as I write this.

I've made this twice, and have tweaked it after reading some reviews. It is so simple, delicious and fluffy! For the sugar, I used a half-half ratio (white & brown), which turned out perfectly sweetened. I put in 3 handfuls of chocolate chips, 3.5 bananas (they were broken up and frozen to keep!) and 1 tsp of cinnamon. I also sifted a thin layer of brown sugar on top, which made it crusty and wonderful! :) I'm thinking of putting the batter in a muffin tin (like how other reviewers did), and I will definitely be making many loaves for Christmas as gifts! :)

Fantastic! I modified the recipe just a little - added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and only used 1/2 cup organic sugar and 1/4 cup packed brown sugar. Also added a dash of cinnamon and allspice. Didn't have chocolate chips on hand and it was still glorious!! Highly recommend this recipe - not too oily, still moist, and simply delicious!

Super easy and delicious. I prefer using walnuts instead of the choc chips (surprisingly). I also use 3/4 c sugar instead of a full cup.

Wow- this was exceptional! And so simple! I used 3/4 cup light brown sugar instead of the 1 cup white sugar. Also, I used 4 bananas: 1 very very soft overripe brown banana that liquified and three freckled bananas that I broke-up and left in chunks. I followed someone else's comment and added the flour last so as not to over-mix, and sprinkled more of the light brown sugar on top before baking. The results were amazing!

We are obsessed with banana bread in our house. This recipe is our new favorite. It is delicious, super-easy to make, plus it uses ingredients that you already have in your pantry (especially if you keep leftover ripe bananas in your freezer, like we do).

Delicious! I was looking for a 1-egg recipe because that's all I had in my fridge and it was just as moist and wonderful as my normal go-to banana bread. I used 3 bananas, added walnuts, chocolate chips and some lemon juice (I squeezed half a somewhat "dry" lemon, whatever that yields) I'm at altitude too, and so I just started checking mine with a toothpick at 45 minutes but didn't make any other adjustments besides adding the above ingredients. I'm new to altitude baking, but I've heard citrus (like lemon juice) is helpful to counter whatever chemistry changes occur to baking soda & water higher up.

I was looking for a traditional banana bread recipe and saw how simple this one was and decided to try it. Used 4 very ripe bananas and instead of chocolate chips, added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Will make this again and probably add 1/2 tsp of vanilla just to jazz it up a bit.

Rating: 4
This recipe is way too sweet (I use half the sugar) but after some adjustments, the kids gobble them down. I've made this a few times and here are my suggestions... 1)double recipe because it doesn't seem worth going thru all the trouble of baking and come out with only 1 dozen muffins.2)If doubling, use 2 c. flour and the last cup half wheat germ and half quick oats. then only use 1c. of sugar. 3)Mix all the dry ingredients together before mixing it into the wet ingredients (and only use 25 strokes) 4)Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top instead of mixing in.

Rating: 3
Great results, although I have never followed the recipe. I substituted the butter for about a cup of applesauce, the white flour for wheat, white sugar for brown, and included vanilla extract and cinnamon. First time I used only half a cup of brown sugar and chocolate chips (delicious!). Second time I used more like 3/4 cup of brown sugar and blackberries (also delicious!). Took more than an hour to bake though. Once it was actually in the oven for about an hour and a half but never set up, although it still tasted yummy. I think that it would have been too sweet and too greasy for me if I had followed the recipe exactly though.

Poured the batter into a 12-muffin pan - added mini chocolate chips to half of them and we had fresh muffins for breakfast! Fast, easy and delicious!

Rating: 4
I made the recipe as is, except I normally don't like chocolate in my breads so I left that out. However, after reading the reviews and tasting a tiny square when it came out, I decided to try an experiment. I took a slice while it was still hot and melted a square of 60% dark chocolate filled with cognac on top. Wow. Next time I think I'll make slits in the bread about 15 minutes before it's finished and insert the pieces of chocolate so the cognac soaks through the bread.

Tonight I made this banana bread because I had some bananas I needed to use before they went bad. I searched on epicurious for something to do with my bananas. I found this recipe and thought it looked great. I added some nutmeg, cinnamon and about two hand fuels of chocolate chips. I double the recipe and made 12 banana bread muffins and put the rest of the batch in a loaf pan. I put chocolate chips on top.YUM!!

Oh. My. God. The moistest, sweetest, bananayest banana bread on planet earth. I usually dislike chocolate chips in things, but they totally add to the recipe. And the best part about it is it is the easiest thing to make ever. Totally, completely, whole-heartedly recommend.

This was my first attempt at a banana bread and my target audience (the boyfriend) LOVED it! I followed the recipe but in the last minutes of baking I added 100 grams of dark chocolate on top, which melted slightly and could then be smoothed over when the cake came out of the oven. Next time I'll put in a bit more banana and a thicker layer of chocolate, but otherwise it's perfect.

My family LOVED this recipe. I followed the advice of others and used vanilla extract and walnut halves. How yummy. I used 2 small loaf pans which I started checking about 30 minutes into it. Left the bananas a little chuny so that you got some mush banana in your bread. Super easy and super delicious!

Wow! I made this "by the book" except for using brown sugar and leaving out the chocolate chips. It's going to be a miracle if there's any left by the time my wife gets home. The only change I might make next time would be to use a little less sugar. With the overripe bananas I had, it's pretty sweet. Also, it took a long time to bake - 1:10 or so, but my oven runs a little cool.

Sooooooooooo easy to make. I love anything I can bake that comes from one bowl and doesn't require a mixer. I made two separate loaves, one with blue berries and one with semi-sweet choc chips. I like the blueberry combination better. I also added walnuts to both for the extra crunch.

This is the perfect recipe for banana bread, the only one I will use forever more! I adhered to the recipe itself but mixed the dry ingredients seperately, skipped the chocolate chips and used walnuts, added vanilla and baked it in a nine inch cake pan because I don't like loaf pans, they just don't bake right in them. Came out perfect in thirty minutes. Thank you to grazzidad from Ann Arbor for the tip about the chunks of banana, it really made a huge difference with the texture. And thank you Aunt Holly! Absolutely will make again and again!

The recipe, as is, is very simple and quick! I love that it only calls for items that most people have on hand at any time, which further speaks to its simplicity. I chose to spice it up, literally, and added curry, allspice, a dash of ground cloves and some vanilla extract. I also used cake flour for a portion of the base recipe, so I added some bread flour, another egg, some sour cream and another teaspoon of baking soda. It came out great! I ended up with two shorter loaves, but it's delicious... especially with a little cream cheese spread on a slice!

i agree with everyone else. Super easy recipe. No electric mixers, etc required. Mine baked for an hour and could have staying in a couple minutes longer.

Will definitely come back to this again and again.

OMG! Can EVERY baking recipe be this easy please?! I love to cook; but am not so good at baking (that whole measuring thing gets in the way). I had 4 browned bananas and a heap of blueberries that I needed to use and this recipe was the ticket!

wow! made this recipe into muffins in the less than 15mins i had available! modified the recipe to make it more muffiny by (1) only using 2 bananas; (2) adding 1 cup fresh redcurrants; (3) using self-raising flour; (4) replacing the 1/2 cup of flour with 1/2 cup oats; (5) using 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of caster sugar; (6) adding some poppy seeds. The result was an amazinly moist, fruity but wholesome muffin!

Superb and Easy... with some modifications. I've made this 5 times now, and it comes out very well, if you are careful about a few things: (1) the recipe is exceedingly imprecise about the quantity of bananas. If you use three, they had better be VERY large. I use five medium bananas, completely liquefying four, and saving the fifth for the end; (2) use less sugar (3/4 cup), but also add a BIT of either or both of honey and maple syrup, which adds a darker, richer flavor; (3) consider adding a very small amount of both vanilla and cinnamon; (4) mix all ingredients EXCEPT the flour together well, then add the flour at the end, mixing as little as possible, to avoid toughness; (5) break the last banana into very small pieces, but avoid liquefying it, and add it at the very end. This will add some actual fruitiness to it, as well as help it retain some additional moistness. No matter what, this is VERY easy, and guaranteed to come out well. [I do add one tablespoon more butter, incidentally, but fat- conscious cooks will avoid that.]

This is one of the easiest recipes I have ever made and it is delicious too. I did alter it slightly. I cut the sugar down 2/3 c, added 1/2 c. chocolate chips, about 1/2 c. chopped walnuts, and 1 t vanilla. It's moist deliciousness that makes me very happy that I saved my overly ripened bananas. I will make this again without a doubt.

I did a variation on this recipe ... 5 bananas (small ones), 3/4 brown sugar only, I did not use the egg or butter, but added a little less than a cup of applesauce. Used whole wheat flour and added oats for texture, as well as cinnamon and vanilla. I tossed in some blueberries that I needed to use instead of adding chocolate chips. Baked at 350 for about 35 minutes in a square tin pan. Just had a square and it turned out great!!

So easy and so good! I have been making banana bread for twenty years, and this simple recipe turned out one of the best loaves I've ever made. I followed suggestions from other reviewers and used 4 bananas, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. If you add the chips, you could really reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup total (50/50 white and brown).

Look no further...this IS the ultimate banana bread. I doubled the recipe to use 7 bananas from a gift fruit basket. Per reviewer suggestions I added vanilla and used 50/50 white/brown sugar. It is a little sweet, so I would reduce sugar 25% next time. Moist, dense and addictive. Everyone raved.

Eating it now, all warm and gooey. I replaced half the butter with coconut oil and the other half with flaxseed meal. I used a combo of oat and spelt flours, added walnuts, cinnamon, an extra banana and chocolate chips. I also halved the sugar after reading other reviews. It turned out great. I'd definitely make it again. It's a great base to experiment with.

This recipe rocks! It takes two seconds to make, calls for ingredients you pretty much already have on hand and tastes delicious. My 7 year old loves it. I make a healthier version by using whole wheat pastry flour, fructose or sucanat instead of sugar and flaxseed meal instead of butter - yes, it really does work - use 3x as much....this recipe calls for 1/4 c. butter so I use 3/4 c. flaxseed meal. I encourage you to try it. And if you love it, I have another great recipe on my website for chocolate muffins! http://www.deepredcellar.com

I only had 3 bananas, so wasn't sure if that would give the recipe enough banana flavor, but it was perfect. Very nice texture and super moist as well. Mine didn't cook within the 60 minute time frame; the outside was getting dark while the inside wasn't baked yet, so I covered it with foil and cooked for additional time, and it came out great. Be sure to grease the pan very well; ours stuck but still tasted delicious. The chocolate chips are a nice touch. We'll make this one again.

I baked @ 350F for 45 mins. using convection in a metal loaf pan & it was a little dark, so next time will reduce temp. to 325F and check doneness after 50 mins. I also added 1 scant cup of chocolate chips that I'll reduce as well.

This is an excellent version of banana bread. I made a few edits, which make it a little moister and makes for rave reviews from the friends n family. Add 1/2 cup applesauce to the banana mixture. Add 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla For a super sweet topping, make a brown sugar oatmeal crust. Its simple- just mix softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and quick oats until you have about 1 cup of crumbly topping. Add on top of banana bread before baking. It makes the bread even better- if thats possible.

i really like this recipe and have made it several times as is.

It doesn't get any faster or easier for a quick, good banana bread. This is fool proof and can be easily modified (and baking is NOT my strength). I only had 2 ripe bananas, so I added a cup of applesauce, still tasted really banana-y. Also, I subbed dark brown sugar for sugar (just lazy) and it was really good. No choco chips but added a bunch of chopped pecans and a few shakes of cinnamon.

i've made this recipe many times to make muffins... it is SO easy and SO yummy. a few changes: i use 1/3 cup brown and 1/3 cup white sugar (or less); sometimes add 1 teaspoon vanilla; sometimes substitute a teaspoon of applesauce for one of the teaspoons of butter; and bake for about 20 minutes in a greased muffin tin. i often freeze bananas that are on their last legs and defrost them just enough in the microwave to mash them. it seems like it would be gross but the muffins come out amazing! i've only used chocolate chips once; raisins are a nice addition. a true winner of a recipe on all counts.

This is the best banana bread recipe I've erver used. I always used the one from Joy of Cooking before, which is good, but this is great! On a few I added brown sugar and walnuts on the top, but they really didn't need it, delicious!

Rating: 4
Delicious, easy recipe. I made the recipe as written, except that I used half whole wheat baking flour and half white flour. Used four bananas because that's what I had on hand; would have been even more delicious with five. I slightly reduced the amount of sugar (to approx. 3/4 C.) because I was adding the chocolate chips.

Rating: 4
I was short on bananas, so added some grated rind and juice from one tangerine, reduced the sugar and flour by 1/4 c each, and added chopped walnuts. I also used egg substitute for the egg. End result tasted great--the orange added a nice subtle complexity. I also liked the texture: the top came out in sort of a glazed crust, while the inside baked to a cake texture.

This is a great basic recipe for banana bread! Based on my mood/taste, I will sometimes add pumpkin pie spice, walnuts and/or chocolate chips to give it something extra. Always a hit.

Delicious, easy and so moist! I used 4 large very ripe bananas, brown sugar and added vanilla. No chocolate chips or nuts were added to my version. Took mere minutes to mix together but seemed like forever to get out of the oven...was worth the wait!

I have made this with slight changes for years and everyone loves it. I use four mashed bananas and one thinly sliced banana added to the batter. One teaspoon vanilla and pecans/walnuts instead of chocolate chips. Oh, and I used brown sugar. People say it's to die for. Very little work. Lasts forever.

This is my go-to banana bread recipe, so simple and oh soooo good. I followed the advice of others and used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. My last touch is to top it with chopped pecans before it goes into the oven. I first tried it with the chocolate chips and the family care for it, so I omit those.

Have been on this site a long time and this is my 1st review. Compelled to comment on this super easy recipe with great results - great fun to make with kids. Dump and mix - a real keeper. We get a lot of bananas here and I have made a number of different banana bread recipes which can be as stodgy as door stops. This one is a failsafe. Did not add the chocolate chips.......Pecans would be great (although most kids aren't crazy about texture). Next time may add some spice.....

As others stated cut down on the sugar depending on how ready and ripe your bananas are. Mine were spotty so I simply cut down on the sugar by a quarter of a cup. Also, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and baked everything for an hour. It came out great (ive tried about 3 diff banana bread recipies prior to this and this one was great and df. had me craving more!) Although its great, its probaly not the best, however for the amount of time this one requires (little to none!) and the simplicity of the ingredients its worth the four forks.

This was the first banana bread I'd ever made, and it truly is wonderful. I definitely would follow other reviewers' advice, and bring the banana total used to 6. I now make this on a weekly basis, using Splenda for baking, for my husband, son, and myself as a breakfast item. And while I did try freezing old bananas for future use, the defrosted results are just so nasty looking as they swim in yellowish water, that I would never try using them in this recipe, for fear of the results! :)

Takes literally 5 minutes to prepare and toss in the oven. Moist, dense, and delicious banana bread. I like to toss a light layer of chocolate chips on the top for presentation, as well as a few througout. It is a bit sweet so 3/4 cup sugar is best as everyone is saying .

I think this will be my new default banana MUFFIN recipe. I make muffins all the time, and my boyfriend said this was his favorite yet.

great recipe and very adaptable. i also reduced sugar to 3/4 cup. I made it in July, so i did not want to turn the oven on, so i baked in our gas grill. just googled baking on grill and found lots of tips. it turned out great, just need to keep an eye on the heat.

So, when does a recipe retain enough of its essence to be its own, rather than someone else's? I took lots of the advice given by other reviewers, and changed almost everything. But, to me, this recipe's success is due to its ability to handle all the changes. Here are mine, for 2 breads: Combine well in mixer: 6-7 overripe bananas; 1 cup white sugar; 1/2 cup brown sugar; 2 Tbsp. honey; 2 eggs; 1/4 cup melted unsalted butter; 1/4 cup vegetable oil; 2 tsp vanilla extract. Add the following dry ingredients: 3 cups flour; 2 tsp baking soda; 1 tsp kosher salt; 1 heaping tsp. cinnamon. Mix until just combined. Place in two greased bread loaf pans. Sprinkle generously with cinnamon sugar. Bake at 350 approx. 50 minutes until knife comes out clean. Very moist and delicious.

This disappeared very quickly. I used 3/4 cup sugar, 4 bananas, and added 1 tbsp ground flaxseed and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I did not add chocolate chips. I used a 9 x 5 loaf pan. It came out perfectly at 55 minutes and was gone the same day.

There may be better banana bread recipes but I don't know of one that is this good AND this easy-- ingredients you have on hand (no buttermilk, etc.), one bowl, mix everything together,bake. Bingo! Very moist. I used three large bananas and followed others' advice to substitute brown sugar for some of the white. I will throw out my other banana bread recipes -- they aren't worth the trouble when there's a recipe this easy.

Great basic recipe that I'm sure I'll be able to play with a bit. I used about 1/4 the amount of butter and made up the rest with canola oil, so even more healthy. Very moist. Will try again with less sugar. I also added about 1 1/2 cup of thawed black cherries. Delicious.

This has become my staple banana bread recipe and is so easy to make. I like it better when made with 4 bananas rather than 3 and I've never added the chocolate chips. I also decrease the sugar to 3/4 cups. Makes a great breakfast bread. Family loves it.

I've only made this once, but can tell this is one of those recipes that is a classic, and works well as a jumping off point for your own variations. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and left out the chocolate chips -- sooooo good and amazingly moist, even though there's only a 1/4c butter. I will definitely be making this again!

I use salted butter and omit the salt. I add 1 tsp of vanilla & skip the chocolate chips and I have reduced the sugar to 100grams (less than half this recipe: 175gms = 3/4 cup) and instead added 1 tblsp of runny honey. I also use the flour with the most grains in it and then throw in another 30gms of sesame seeds. It's so versatile! I've added Chopped dried apricots for a fruity zing which makes a lovely change.

This is just fabulous! I used three average-sized bananas that were brown but still soft, ripe, and sweet. Had to bake for about 10 extra minutes, but that could've been my pan. Instead of chocolate chips, I added a handful of chopped walnuts. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing; this is perfect just as is and super-easy to make! You could try adding a streusel topping if you wanted to get really fancy.

had one large banana and 3 small ones. was concerned considering other comments that it might be too chewy, so used four mini loaf pans and it turned out great. with about 20 -25 mins in the oven. agree that it was too much sugar. maybe use 1/2 the amount in brown sugar and a little more flour next time?

This was an extremely easy recipe, perfect for a last minute loaf to take to a team practice.

This was a bit sweet for me, but everyone else liked it. Will reduce the sugar next time - maybe 1/3 cup white & 1/3 cup brown. I also added 1 tsp vanilla & 1 tsp cinnamon and left out the chips. Three banannas were plenty - I was a bit concerned as the top was getting brown while the inside was still underdone. Would add a 1/2 star for convenience if I could.

Fabulous basic recipe for any "bread" you want to make. The banana is great and today I subbed mango puree for the banana and I love it! Not too wet, not too dry, just enough butter; I halved the sugar as I do in all my baking because you can taste past the sugar that way! Add vanilla and any spice you want to accompany the fruit and create your own masterpiece!

This really IS an exceptional banana bread. I tried it 2 ways--as written and with some of the variations other reviewers suggested. The original is delicious, moist as promised, less sweet. My other loaf substituted 1/2 c. brown sugar, and 1/2 c.plain white sugar for the 1 c. sugar, added some white chocolate chips, 1 tsp. of vanilla,and 1 tsp. of cinnamon. I think my own standard version of this going forward will omit the chocolate chips (they all melted down in the bread anyhow and just added a bit too much sweet and wasted calories), but continue using the mixture of white and brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon which gave a lovely caramel-ly flavor to the loaf. Yum. We'll do this often--very good!

I adulterated this recipe with a teaspoon of cinnamon, teaspoon of vanilla, three quarters of a cup or so of raisins and chocolate chips each.

As for the one I did... somewhere between three and four stars. My boyfriend loved it!

This was really, really good and SUPER easy to make. I love when I can only use ONE bowl! I only gave it 3 forks and not 4 because I think the 1 cup of sugar is excessive. The bananas are sweet enough when they are ripe that the sugar was a little overwhelming. I would cut back to about 1/2 cup or 3/4 (at the most) next time. I also added in 1 teaspoon of vanilla and about a teaspoon of cinnamon. DELICIOUS!

This came out really well, and was definitely easy--just five or so minutes to throw it all together. I made a few variations on the recipe: I used only two bananas, mixed 1/3 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup regular sugar, and then 1 cup regular flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour. To finish it off, I chopped up some semi-sweet chocolate and threw it in the mix. Enjoy!

Super simple! As recommended by others, I added handful of pecans, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg plus 1/2 a bar of crushed dark chocolate (not chips!).

Can't imagine anything easier. Took less than ten minutes to throw together; my 6 year old did most of the mashing and cooking and had a ball. This is a great kid's recipe.

I would give it a 3 1/2 if that was an option. It was so easy and maybe if I followed the recipe exactly I would have rated it 4 forks. Because of the comments I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup and the bread turned out just a tad not sweet enough. But, everything else was great, moist inside, crispy on top. I'm going to use this as a base and try some variations.

Wow amazing recipe. I believe it is foolproof. I am far from a baker and just trying to use up some bananas too mushy to eat and found this recipe.. I accidentally used 1c of melted butter and 1/2c of sugar and baked in my silicone round with some chocolate chips and it came out fantastic! It turned golden brown after 30min so I took it out and that's when I realized I goofed up the recipe. After cooling off and tasting it I have to say really tasty. Very impressed! Will make again possibly even the right way next time!

I have tried many banana bread recipes, and they almost always turn out dry. This is the moistest banana bread I've ever made; my kids and I ate too much after we made it this afternoon. I left out the chocolate chips and still reduced the sugar (1/3 c brown, 1/3 c white as someone else had suggested), and it was plenty sweet. I also had no butter on hand (!) so used canola oil, and I added 3 tbsp of buttermilk since it was going to go to waste otherwise. It's very tasty!

Great banana bread recipe. The batter seemed a little dry, so I added 3 Tbsp plain yogurt, and the result was fantastic. You can cut down substantially on the sugar to no ill effect: I used 1/3 c brown sugar and 1/3 c white sugar. In addition to the chocolate chips, I threw in a dash of vanilla and some coconut flakes for fun. Decadent and delicious - I'd definitely make this again.

Danger! Danger! After trying this recipe a few weeks ago, bananas barely stand a chance at ripening in our house any more. This recipe is ridiculously easy, and produces great results, even without nuts or chocolate chips. I've been making it in the Cuisinart, which makes it even easier and faster. You can have it in the oven in less than 5 minutes, including clean up. As I said- a dangerous recipe: too good and too easy!

This is SOOO yummy and easy. I have cut down the sugar to 2/3 cup with no difference. I do bake it in mini cupcake pans so the kids have "two-bite" banana breads. They disappear in no time

I made this for my daughter's preschool and they gobbled up the whole loaf. The teachers also asked for the recipe. Made as written w/the addition of chocolate chips and walnuts. Very moist and not sickeningly sweet. A keeper.

I have some fig puree sitting around and trying to figure out what t do with it so I thought I'd try it in this bread. Really turned out great. I adjusted: used two bananas and instead of butter used fig puree. Also, used 1/2 medium brown sugar and 1/2 regular. Added a dash of cinnamon, allspice, clove and ginger. Loving it! Very easy to play with the recipe.

This was very easy to make and tastes YUMMY too. The only thing I did that was different is I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. This recipe is so easy I am going to use it for after school cooking class I teach with elementry kids. No beaters!! LOL

Gosh, this is probably one of the worst banana breads I have tasted. Everyone hated it, including the kids. I would not bother trying this again.

I hate to bake, but I have made this at least three times in the past month because it is so easy and so good. I also add a bit of cinnamon and some vanilla. It's very good!

This is one easy (very, very easy!) recipe that tastes great too! I cut the sugar in half and save a bit to sprinkle with cinnamon on top before baking.

Very nice for such a simple recipe. I used just under 3/4 cup brown sugar with another teaspoon sprinkled over the top. No nuts or chips, but a little bit of real vanilla essence and a good pinch of fresh nutmeg.

To make this non-dairy, I used margarine and only used half the amount called for. It still came out moist and yummy. I also added one tablespoon vanilla extract. I used brown sugar and would reduce it to 3/4 cup next time. It was just a tad too sweet for my taste. Very tasty, though, would definitely make it again.

This is an excellent bannana bread and so easy to make! I incorporated many of the suggestions made by others. You can modify the recipe in multiple ways (more chips, other kinds of chips, nuts, trail mix, applesauce instead of butter etc.). Don't discard those over- ripe bananas! Bake this bread!

it was so easy to make, followed some of the chefs notations to use less sugar and it came out yummy...would make it again next time with nuts or chocolate chips

Easily the best banana bread I've tried, and I've tried a few.

I embellished recipe with addition of about 1/2 tsp cinnamon,1/4 tsp ground ginger and a dash of cardamom. I crushed walnuts and threw in about 1 1/4 cups of the nuts (I tend to not measure) in lieu of chocolate chips. Moist and delicious.

Great banana bread. The chocolate chips add so much to this, that I actually was able to cut some of the sugar out because of the added sugar from the chocolate chips. I also substituted applesauce for the margarine and even my picky fiance couldn't tell the difference. Two thumbs up!!!

This was my first attempt to bake anything and it turned out great. I substituted 3/4 cup brown sugar, used 4 bananas and cooked for 70 minutes. Not too sweet and good consistency.

Substituted 1/2 cup cake flour, instead of chocolate chips, crushed two squares of bittersweet chocolate, and added 3/4 cup walnuts. I pretoasted the walnuts, yummy...:)

Considering how easy is to put this bread together and that uses only one egg and very little fat is a good recipe. Given the previous reviews I also cut the sugar, using only 125 grams (1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons) sugar.

Nice, easy recipe - I sub'd choc chips for 1/2 cup walnuts...Nice!

I've made this recipe as directed many times and have always enjoyed the outcome (and the fact that it's easy enough for my little ones to help)! We made some changes tonight and again, thrilled with the outcome - we replaced the flour with wheat flour, oil with applesauce, sugar with splenda (reduced to 3/4 c.) and egg beaters for the egg - higher in fiber, less fat, sugar and calories than the original yet still yummy!!

I decided to finish up whatever was in my cupboard, so added a handful of butterscotch chips, hickory nuts and dried pineapple, and some chocolate shavings. I used three bananas and rounded up the baking soda, and used slightly less sugar. It came out delicious and could not have been easier to make. Definite repeat.

I thought it was great... even better and easier than my usual recipe. Maybe a little sweet, but I was short one banana, so that might make up for it.

Very easy to make, the kids loved it. I cut the sugar slightly - still a great recipe.

My man and I saw that our bananas were going bad, so we thought we would bake up some bread. I didn't have baking soda so I quadrupled with baking powder. I also had some amazing vanilla from Haiti, so I added a little of that too. I through in some white chocolate chips and some dark chocolate as well with some almond slivers. I let it bake for 45 minutes. The end product was super yummy!

A little spongy, but pretty good considering there is no dairy, which is why I picked the recipe. I don't love super sweet stuff so I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and it is still plenty sweet.

Great bread

It's hard to go wrong with bananas and chocolate chips but..this recipe did. It had a really rubbery texture. On the plus side it was really easy. I would not make it again.

I wasn't happy with this recipe. I thought I would try a new one, and I have tried many. The flavor is fine and it was easy to make, but it's spongy. I won;t make this again.

I have baked this banana bread several times and it always turns out delicious. Very easy recipe. I do add nuts to it because my husband loves banana bread with nuts. I also add a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. Great recipe!

I used 3 small bananas, and yet the center of my loaf came out gooey, even though the outside was brown and crusty. The flavour was nice, but perhaps a bit too sweet. I might try it again.

Perfect. Everyone raved about it! I used four bananas and it did take a bit longer than the 55-60 minutes for me; it took another 10 minutes for the toothpick to come out clean. Worth the wait!

This recipe is incredibly easy, quick, and relies on everyday ingredients. A good recipe for the working mother.

If the finished product is as good as the raw mix was, then I should think this is a great recipe. I had to stop myself from eating it, yummm.

Simple and delicious! I halved the recipe once, and doubled it on another occasion, and in both cases the results were great!

As a professional chef for 20 years this recipe is good, quick and easy to modify. This is banana BREAD not banana cake (and as we all know) good bread should not be as moist as cake.

The bread was not moist enough. The recipe could be much better if it included, say, 1/4 cup yogurt. This recipe is simple, but there are other recipes that are so much better for the little extra effort they require.

The smell from this baking is amazing. I added walnuts, and baked them in a muffin tin. Yum!

This was a very easy and delicious quick bread. I served it to my bridge club (and leftovers to my family)and the next day my son asked me to bake another loaf. I used pumpkin pie spice and pecans for added flavor. Delicious!

Easy and simple foundation recipe that you can modify so many different ways... I know my husband enjoyed the "loaf" as he came home the next day with 16 ripe bananas! I added chopped glazed ginger which gives the loaf a little zing! Ths recipe is a keeper.

My husband and Dad both loved this easy and simple cake more than some more complicated ones. I did add pecans too and that made it a little more special...

This was a very easy and delicious bread. I used 4 bananas and tossed in some pecans for extra texture. Everyone loved it and it took no time to make.
