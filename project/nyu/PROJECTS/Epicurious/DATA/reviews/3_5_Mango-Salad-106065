Also I just added Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette a jalapeno,and grape tomatoes,and omitted the cilantro---PERFECTO! EVERYONE WAS PLEASED:)

Made this salad and boy, it was scrumptious! As one of the reviewers mentioned, I added a little bit of dijon mustard to make it tasted better. Scored!

Love, love, LOVE this recipe! I've made it several times and each time, it's a hit. I usually prepare it as a side to chicken curry and rice. Adds a very refreshing aspect to the meal. I would just watch the ripeness of the mangoes though...better to use ripe but firm ones.

A unique offering. Served with jerk chicken. I felt there was too much dressing and will cut it down next time.

I made this up as a luncheon for 2. I felt that the dressing needed some Dijon mustard to balance the flavor! I added mixed salad greens, sweet white onion, cherry tomatos, avocado, mango, dried blueberries, Havariti cheese and grilled prawns (based with the dressing). I served this with buttermilk drop biscuits. This was very colourful to look at and it made such a satisfying meal. Loved it!!! I would do this one again!

This salad was so refreshing. It had lovely meld of flavors that is unexpected when looking at the ingredient list. The only changes I made was to use sherry balsamic vinegar and cherry tomatoes from my garden. Lovely salad, and definitely now in my keeper file.

AMAZING flavors, EASY to make and a GREAT HIT!! Added chopped basil and a little grated ginger to bring some spice to the dish. Also used cherry tomatos (halved). The visual presentation of all the ingredients was beautiful.

Can you say mango-rrific!!! This is unusually enjoyable.

The surprising compatibility of the red onion with the mango is as beautiful as the vibrant colors of this recipe. I have been making this recipe since it first appeared in Gourmet. At least three people always ask for the recipe - and I'm pleased to pass it along each time! This is one of my favorites. I do suggest the reminder to toss well several times before serving to stir up the flavors.

I made this dish for my Spanish class for extra credit and they all loved it, including my teacher. I normally don't like mango but this was great!

Absolutely delicious! Served with Caribbean Chicken Breasts recipe at this site as part of a Caribbean dinner for my book club. We read Shopgirl by Steve Martin. The characters had their second date at Cha Cha Cha in Los Angeles so I served this in keeping with with theme. It was divine. Have served it several times since, always with positive reviews. Rather exotic! Very tasty.

This recipe is simple, but wonderful with spicy entrees. I've made it twice, once with a tandoori mixed grill and the other with cumin spiced scallops with a jalapeno-cilantro pesto. The flavors are complex without stealing the show from a good entree. This one is a keeper.

This was delicious, although I have to say the portions turned out a little skimpy -- next time I'll use two mangoes. Because the tomatoes available in New York City tend to be tasteless, I used little cherry tomatoes from a farmers' market, which turned out to be perfect. The recipre was a great accompaniment to soft shell crabs.

Ooops... Please disregard my review below. I wondered why no one mentioned this problem, but it turns out I read it wrong and used tbsps instead of tsps!

Great taste, but the recipe made a lot of liquid for the solids. Maybe next time I'll half the dressing.

This was a great salad - so easy to make and very fresh in taste. i made this salad as an accopmaniment to a caribbean dinner with friends (chicken stew & rice). and this salad was a hit!

So easy. I think it really depends on the quality of mango and tomato you use. Mine were really good and ripe. I added a bit of lettuce to make it less intense. Could go with a lot of different things.

This was delicious. I made for a dinner party and it was a perfect salad course. Easy to make as well.

This was a nice along with the Jerked Shrimp elsewhere on this site. It's nice to have a recipe for a salad that uses fruit well, but isn't a 'fruit salad', per se.

I have made this for many dinner parties - and someone always asks for the recipe. Fast and delicious! I always increase the mango and only use vine-ripened tomatoes. The better the tomato the better the dish. Enjoy!!

I made this because I happened to have almost all the ingredients on hand. This was a very nice salad with a good combination of flavours and textures. I substituted red pepper for the tomato and julienned all the ingredients and served over lettuce. Easy to make and delicious.

This was an excellent salad and got rave reviews from my guests. I did add one avocado which I think really added a lot. I would definitely make it again!

Great recipe. I substitute red pepper for the tomatoes, and julienne the mango and the pepper. Have made it several times and always get rave reviews. Be careful that your mango isn't too ripe - it's best if it's still a little firm.

Wonderful with tomatoes fresh from the garden. Simple and elegant.

Found this recipe to be refreshing and delicious. Everyone liked it and it went perfect with baked white fish from the waters of Lake Superior. Have made it many time and plan to make it again today.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I added avacado as one reader suggested and I think it added a lot to the flavor range. I am using this for my suppere club dinner with a Caribbean theme. I doubled the recipe but because it is a cooking light supper club I used four table spoons of oil instead of doubling it with the rest of the ingredients.I am sure everyone will love it. I hope it will be enough!

would be better with garlic finely chopped, no sugar and 1 table spoon of basilic...

This salad did not bring out the flavor of the mango, instead it seemed to mask the flavor of the mango. As a sort of condiment, I think it would be great-- but will not make this again the next time I'm looking for a great savory use of mangoes.

Made this salad last night for dinner guests. It was great. I did add an avocado as one reviewer suggested and served it on Boston lettuce leaves. Delicious.
