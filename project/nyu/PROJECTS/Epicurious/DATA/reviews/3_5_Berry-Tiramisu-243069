Easy, and colorful, but just not very delicious. I thought perhaps an additional layer of the cream between berry and ladyfinger layers might smooth out the intense berry flavor, but the recipe is just disappointingly grainy. I recommend a classic tiramisu recipe or a berry pie instead.

This dish just got better with time. I recommend making it a day or more in advance. The fresh berry flavor is to die for, and especially a treat during these cold New England winters. Berries were expensive this time of year, but well worth it. I will halve the recipe next time, unless I'm serving for a party. A+++++

Loves this. Fund to made and turned out beautiful

Very yummy, and so easy. I made it the day before and it set perfectly, and I added the Stars and Stripes on top in blueberries and small pieces of strawberries to make it a 4th of July dessert. Substituted half of the mascarpone with a 50/50 cream cheese and sour cream combination and that worked well. Would definitely make it again!

Loved this recipe. Fun to make and even more fun to eat. Found the mascarpone. Really worth making. I would use the hard lady fingers next time. My husband bought the soft ones. Still yummy.

delicious! I think we should have used the lady fingers that are very hard but it still turned out wonderful. Followed the recipe exactly.

I have to agree with the other reviewers, this is a great summertime version of tiramisu. It makes a lot! I used fresh blueberries and a bag of frozen mixed berries. I also highly recommend using a substitute for marscapone too. Google it and find lots of subs. The one I use uses sour cream instead of butter as in the one suggested by the other reviewer. I also drizzled the ladyfingers with a little limoncello for a nice little kick...no one noticed so I may use a little more next time.

Looks like a simple recipe. I'd imagine that since you're cooking the berries (never understood why people do that with yummy FRESH berries!), you could use good frozen berries here. Will try this soon.

I made this yesterday for group of 8. It makes plenty for 16 good sized servings and there was only 1 serving left. Everyone loved it. It's light, not too sweet and beautiful to look at. I made no changes to the recipe. The ingredients are spendy...probably close to $30 with all the fresh berries. I also wish I'd made it the day before as it needs PLENTY of time for the cheese mixture to set up. It was cuttable after 12 hours, but would have had a nicer appearance if it was allowed to chill for an additional 8-10 hrs.

This recipe cost more than expected to prepare. The cheese mixture seemed a little thin when first preparing the recipe, before I let it set overnight. Don't worry - it set nicely. Also, I usually use a "marscapone substitute" recipe instead of the regular Marscapone when making tiramisu. The substitute worked well here too. Marscapone cheese can be difficult to find and rather expensive. The substitute works fine. Marscapone Substitute (yields 2 lb.): 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese; 2 tablespoons butter; 1/2 cup unwhipped whipping cream. Half the tiramisu recipe was enough to impress a group of 20+.
