I've made this puree a number of times, and it's always a huge hit. It is unbelievably creamy and good, but you do need to monitor the salt, garlic, etc. to make sure that it ends up to your taste. I add some dried red pepper flakes to give it just a little kick.

I make this with sauteed spinach and it is one of my husband's favorites - calls it spinach and beans...

Here are a few suggestions - canned white cannelini beans can be substituted for dried. Heat gently with a mix of clarified butter (normal butter also does the trick!)and a drop of olive oil. Add garlic (fresh or roasted) to taste, fresh ground pepper, salt and good quality grated parmesan and stir to mix. When heated through mash ingredients together and serve on crostini. Good for cooks who like to wing it a little. Just make sure to use the mixture pronto, or else it gets dry. Also good if you use good canned lentils and pancetta ham!

This recipe was pretty blah when I was making it. I decided to add a few roasted red peppers. This really improved the taste.

I didn't make this as a dip; instead, I used it as a base for braised pot roast. I did the quick-soak method (bring beans to boil for 2 minutes then let sit for 3 hours) and used only dried herbs. It was great for soaking up braising juices, and different than basic mashed potatoes. I'll definetly add this to the rotation.

I was rather disappointed in this as well. It sounded like a great recipe when I read it. But barely anyone touched it when I served it at a party.

Despite using fresh rosemary and sage, a fair amount of extra lemon juice and lots of salt and pepper, my husband and I found this quite bland. There are better white bean dip recipes out there. I wouldn't bother with this again, although it was simple.

The recipe was pretty easy but the result was fairly blah. It needs something to add some zing but I'm not sure what. I don't think that I would make it again.

Wonderful, probably healthy. I made it with fresh sage and rosemary and farmers market garlic. It was wonderful with crisp breadsticks. Good as a vegetarian protein.
