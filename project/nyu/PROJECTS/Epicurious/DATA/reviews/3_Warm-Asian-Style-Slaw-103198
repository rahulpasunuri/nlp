We loved this slaw! I left out the cucumber and chopped the cabbage and carrots in a food processor, then added them the heated oil in a dutch oven and took the pot off heat immediately. This just barely wilted the veggies, so they were still crisp but warm enough to melt the peanut butter and make it easier to incorporate. I did add a few tbs. of water to the dressing, since all I had was a natural-type, chunky PB and it seemed rather thick. I also used Asian Chili Garlic Paste that comes in a jar. I will make this again and again!

Pretty good, my kids ate a few bites without complaining, which is saying a lot for something with cabbage as a main ingredient. I made it quick & easy with a food processor so only sauteed a couple of minutes. Added lime, soy sauce and scallion. Skipped the chile paste and cukes (didn't have any) and I thought it was quite tasty and a bit out of the ordinary. Nice compliment to the Hosin 5-Spice Chicken.

This slaw is a nice way to add variety to the winter veggies rotation. One reviewer asked if this works without sauteing the veggies; the answer is yes if you cut the veggies as for raw slaw, and substitute something crunchy, like bell pepper, for the cuke, to better match the raw cabbage texture. I also added a little chopped cilantro with the dressing. (This would be nice sprinkled on the warm slaw, too.) I used Trader Joe's Sriracha for the chile paste, but the dressing lacked depth and heat, so I added a few drops of Dave's Gourmet Insanity Sauce and some raw finely minced garlic, as well as the lime juice other cooks mentioned. That made it just right to our taste. I had my food processor out to shred the veggies, so I made a double sauce recipe. There's no problem mixing natural p.b. with liquid using power tools!

I liked this recipe and will make it again, but next time will reduce the cucumber (perhaps I used too much?), and add scallions, the lime as suggested, and maybe even some edamame. I loved the sauce, and did not cut down on the peanut butter as other reviewers recommended because I like peanut butter. If you like peanut butter, there's no reason to cut down on it.

Overall, lackluster, rather disappointing. Reduced the peanut butter (used creamy but old-fashioned type -- just peanuts/salt) as some of the other reviewers suggested to 2 Tbsp in the sauce. Also added 1 Tbsp. of fresh lime juice since it seemed to need brightness and this helped the consistency greatly. Liked the sauce very much on it's own after it sat for a bit. Didn't like it once it was tossed with the warm veggies. I'll keep the sauce recipe and use it for dipping sugar snap peas, fresh cabbage, carrots, grilled chicken.

I tried it using broccoli slaw and some finely cut collard greens from the garden and a little leftover red bell pepper and deleted the cucumber. I also cut the peanut butter in half and used a little more soy sauce and a squeeze of lime. Absolutley fabulous!!

I used a combination of white and red cabbage. I served it with an Asian-flavored beef brisket and the Jasmine Rice with Peas and Lemon from this site. Excellent!

I wonder what kind of "Asian chili paste" is recommended here. Chinese? Thai? Korean? Now that we're familiar with Asian cuisines, it's time for more specific and varied ingredients in Asian recipes - more than just "red curry" in Thai dishes, for example. I'll try this dish with Thai chili paste.

Best slaw my husband ever had. The only thing we may change is the peanut butter. We used Organic (nothing added) peanut butter which tends to clump when added to the other dressing ingredients. Did anyone use regular Skippy or Jiffy type peanut butter and did they react it same way?

This was good--I'd give it 2.5 forks if I could. It went well with the hoisin chicken, and I'm sure would go well with other Asian-flavored dishes.

I also used bagged cole slaw which saved a lot of time. 2 tbsp peanut butter was perfect. This was a simple, satisfying side to the Chinese style roasted chicken thighs and was different than simply stir frying some veggies. My boyfriend loved it. Will make again.

This was okay. Saved lots of time by using the bagged cole slaw mix which included cabbage and carrots. Added some red pepper for colour. I was only making 1/2 the recipe so cut the peanut butter to 1 Tbs. This was nice along side the spicy hoisin chicken and jasmine rice also on this site. Three quick recipes with distinct tastes.

This was pretty good, though I too cut the peanut butter to about 2-3 tbsp. I'm not a huge peanut butter fan so I'm not sure if I will make this again, but I thought overall that the flavors were good and it was easy to put together.

I really liked this dish; I served it with Griled FIve Spice Chicken (Also on Epicurious, which I felt was lighter than the hoisin chieck suggested. I will definitely make it again, but with 2 modifications: (1) I used 1/4 cup peanut butter, as called for in the orginal recipe in Gourmet. However, I found it a little too peanut-buttery, so added in another tbsp soy sauce and 2 tbsp vinegar to compensate. Next time I will just use 2-3 tbsp peanut butter to start. (2) I will add only about half the toal dressing to the slaw. (Leftover dressing would be great on cooked noodles!) I'd also like to try this as an uncooked slaw in the summer. Any ideas if it would work if I just mixed the carrots, cabbage and vegetables together without cooking? Maybe with a sliced granny smith apple thrown in? I had fun doing the julienne, and the dish looked spectacular.

I loved this recipe!I would describe it as more of a stirfry type dish than a slaw.I also added the peanut butter to taste.I did'nt waste time julienning(sp)the ingredients so it came together quickly and the presentation was just as nice.

I started with a few spoonfuls of peanutbutter and added one more generous tablespoon to add some sweet. I did not have Asian chili paste so I subsituted bottled szcheuan sauce and red pepper flakes. I skipped the cucumber altogether and it was still tasty. It turned out very well. I would use chuncky peanut butter next time.

Very tasty side dish. My only change was to use crushed peanuts instead of peanut butter (which I was out of). This was a simple and delicious side dish to the hoisin five-spice chicken legs. Actually, I found that the side dish outshined the main course.

The recipe in Gourmet lists 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter.

In reply to the question posed by a reader, I would suggest you start with a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter and keep adding it in those amounts until you get the right sort of consistency. Some butters are runnier than others, and a specific measurement can be iffy.
