I have made this recipe many times and love it. I have also used the marinade (cooked down) as a sauce to spoon over stuffed sweet peppers as they cook. It glazes really well and spices up the filling.

I have been looking for a good sweet flank steak marinate and I have found it. I used reduced sodium soy sauce which seems to control the salt level just fine. I marinated this for about 7 or 8 hours, but if you used reduced sodium soy I can't believe overnight would be a problem. As far as making, the sauce all I have to say is "Come on cooks! Stick a spoon into the saucepan, taste the sauce and adjust!". I cooked the steak under a broiler and poured the drippings from the meat into the sauce pan with the leftover marinade. I cooked down the liquid and added some honey to taste. This works well because my wife and I find that sweet helps balance hot spice perfectly. I also substituted ketchup for tomato paste. For those who don't like too much spice, definitely cut back on the creole seasoning. You can always add some seasoning back when making the sauce, but you will have to stick your spoon in the saucepan to taste and make adjustments.

Marinated overnight, like others found it too salty and used reduced sodium soy sauce, perhaps should not have marinated so long? Would not bother making again

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I didn't care for the sauce (I don't like spicy) but that could be because the only creole seasoning I could find was Emeril's, which may be more spicy. I didn't use flank steak, but top sirloin because it was on sale, and it was soooooo yummy! Rave reviews from my 12 yr old, so we'll be adding this dish to our monthly menu.

we thought that the steak was great. not so much for the reduced marinade, it was way to briny. we would use another sauce.

I made this last night after reading the reviews and it was truly excellent. We loved it. Did not have tomato paste so substituted ketchup and that was fine. Don't forget to make the sauce. Marinated the steak about 4 hours. I had 2 identical flank steaks and used a different marinade for the first one and it was not nearly as tender and flavorful. This will be my standard from now on. Great!

An unlikely combo of ingredients that works - this is really juicy and full-flavored. I too marinated it for 5 hours, which was plenty. Also took a shortcut on the garlic: Instead of mincing, I just threw a handful of peeled cloves right in the plastic bag, gave them a few good whacks with a heavy measuring cup, and then poured in everything else. Much simpler.

The flavors were wonderful on this dish. I only marinated it for 5 hours and the strenght of the flavor was perfect, not over powering. I did serve the extra sauce on the side (sauce gives it any extra kick). My daughter doesn't care for spicy foods, and after grilling, she didn't say it was spicy at all! Great sliced up as left-overs on a salad.

I tried this as a way to branch our from my typical Asian soy/ginger/garlic marinade for flank steak. While we enjoy strong flavors, and liked the flavor of the marinade/sauce, we felt it overpowered the beef flavor of the steak.

This has to be one of the best flank steak recipes we've ever had! I used low sodium soy sauce and sherry . The steak was very tender and flavorful and the sauce was fabulous. The comments about salty or spicy didn't apply to us. Although, if you're a little heat sensitive, the sauce was about a 3.5 out of 5 on the heat scale. So if you don't like that much spice, try reducing the Creole seasoning by half. I'm sure you'll enjoy! Our guests also loved it!

Have to marinate for at least 6 hours to taste really good. Best with mashed potatoes. I put slightly less creole seasoning so not too spicy.

Yum-my! My whole family loved this - even picky 11-yr old, he said, "This is a keeper!" I made it exactly as the recipe stated, but used low-sodium soy sauce. Outstanding recipe and so simple!

I served this for dinner last night and the fanily loved it including my 14 year old son who thinks fine dining is a cheeseburger! I only used 1/2 the soy sauce to elimnate some of the sodium and substituted BBQ sauce for the tomato sauce. Also marinated the steak overnight.

OMG this is SO GOOD. Doubled the recipe last night since I had a larger group, and had just enough leftovers for 2 very delicious sandwiches. Will make again and again. Astounding how good that sauce is, given how simple the recipe is. I froze the leftover sauce and will use next time we're grilling a sirloin.

I swapped out the creole seasoning for Texas BBQ seasoning, and halved the soy sauce (added some water to make up for the other half). It was yummy, great reviews.

Simply yum!

I loved it, and my girlfriend did too! I made it without the tomato paste, with just a little granulated sugar instead of brown, and low- sodium soy sauce. Although I'd never thought to add cajun seasoning to a marinade before, it worked well. I'll certainly make this again.

I liked the marinade, but it was a bit too salty for me and I used low-sodium soy sauce. I think the problem is the creole seasoning and will try the Tabasco substituion next time.

While the flavor has potential - i made it exactly as it called for - and it was FAR too salty - and i am not usually sensitive to salty things. would be a great Jerky recipe...BAM!

I would kick it up a notch with some fresh Chili or serrano peppers finely chopped and marinate for a minimum of 6 hours,or double up on the Creole seasoning.Regardless it tastes great.Be sure your grill is as hot as it can go.Do not worry if it tends to char the outside.When you slice it thin this makes the flavor.This is one dish that is not to be overcooked.when it comes off the grill and it seems rare,cover with foil for 5 minutes on your cutting board(a lot of juice will drain off so use a cutting board with a fluid groove)and it will be perfect.Besides it gives you a chance to set up all your sides ,the table and pour a glass of Shiraz!

Prepared according to directions. Has potential. Worked okay as a marinade but much too salty as a reduction. As others have suggested I would definitely go with low salt soy sauce. I would add a dash of cayenne, too, if your Creole seasoning is on the mild side.

This marinade was incredible!!! My family loved it, including my children. However, I did not have creole seasoning at hand, so I subsituted tabasco sauce as others did. Would definately make this over and over.....

I made this recipe with dry red cooking wine and tobasco sauce. Everyone loved it! I grilled it 6 minutes per side on low/medium heat on a preheated grill and it was done to perfection. It's a simple, yet delicious, recipe that I'll make again.

Really good! I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, and green jalepeno, but I think red would be fine. I also left out the tomato paste, but this recipe was still incredible. I ate the entire flank steak myself! The leftover sauce was good days beyond the flank steak!

I made this with no subsitutions. Anyone with any sodium problems should use Low Salt Soy Sauce and not add any additional salt (test kitchen Emeril's Essense Subsitution) It was too salty for me which overpowered the rest of the flavors. BF liked it, but I will try the tabasco the next time. Watch cooking time, I needed more then 6 mins per side to get to rare.

Fabulous AND easy. I marinated the steak overnight and used tobassco instead of creole seasoning per recommendations. Everyone loved the sauce. We'll have this one again soon.

This was outstanding! I, too, used tabassco instead of the creole and everything turned out great. I had to cook my steak 13 minutes on a side just to get it up to rare - anything less than that would have been raw. This recipe is a keeper!

What a fabulous recipe! I selected the sherry option, seared this with olive oil and butter on the stove, finished it in the oven and served it over Yukon gold mashed potatoes. The recipe notes to re-use the sauce, I would suggest heating the sauce to boiling first as it has been used for the marinade.

This was ok- try the Garlic and Rosemary marinade, it's much better than this. Boring.

I made this for a dinner party. It was great! All the ingredients were a perfect fit. I didn't think they would work at first when I tasted the marinade, but boy was I wrong! I will definitely make this again. Bam!

Everything was delicious, except for the creole seasoning. I don't think that it blends well with the sherry. Use some tobassco in its place.
