This is one of my keepers. I've made it four or five times now. I use ground beef (we got a quarter side of beef, so we have a lot) and non-fat Greek yogurt. The first time, it was extremely time-consuming, but it has gotten quicker. I definitely recommend making the sauce a day in advance. I didn't do that last night, and had to leave for a meeting, but it was delicious tonight! A little work, yes, but well worth it. One suggestion: be careful not to overcook the meat.

This was really delicious, but not quick. I would make this every week if I were a chef with a kitchen full of equipment & a posse of dishwashers. I will make it again & try to simplify to make it a more reasonable weeknight meal. I followed it pretty exactly, except that I accidentally doubled the spices. After finishing the sauce I realized I was supposed to save some for the meat. Since the sauce tasted awesome at that point, i decided to just duplicate the spices for the meat. I think the spices make the recipe. Of course you could make this with beef or lamb, or some combination. But bison is so delicious & healthy, & they sell 1-lb packages at Costco :)

I'm surprised this wasn't super awesome. It's got all the great ingredients but it just didn't wow me. It's good enough, but I wouldn't serve it to guest.

Excellent. Used gr.moose instead of the buffalo but works great.Also, have to go dairy free so used coconut milk 'cream' in place of the yogurt and milk. The sauce would be much better with a clove or two of garlic in it. Threw the extra toasted spices in with some hummus and a little olive oil drizzled on top which we ate with pita bread. Saffron rice made it a meal. Felt it was too light with just the pita and meatballs.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, didn't substitute anything, and threw a few meatballs and a couple dollops of sauce in some pita bread. It was deeeeelicious. It took maybe 45 minutes from start to finishI'd say 10 or so for the sauce and 30-35 to assemble, shape, and fry the meatballs. Serve alongside a summer salad (we had http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Tomato-and-Cucumber-Salad-with-Pita-Bread-and-Zaatar-103394) and you're good to go!

Wow!!! This is a keeper. The meatballs with the sauce was amazing. I used fat free Greek yogurt and it was still fabulous.

This tasted great! I doubled the recipe and didn't have the time to toast and grind the fennel and cumin seeds. Still tasted great. Warning - this recipe does take a lot of time. Listen to the suggestion and make the yogurt sauce one day ahead. I served it with a greek salad - tomatoes, cucumbers, feta cheese, olive oil, salt amd pepper - and the meal was amazing. My husnband loved it and I we're so excited we have leftovers for tomorrow's dinner!

This was very good and a nice change from the Italian style meatballs that I am used to making. If you don't have mint or some of the dry spices, don't worry. Just add more garlic and cilantro and you should be good to go. That's what I did and everyone loved it.

I made this almost to a t, but doubling the meat part. The first batch, i made it according to the recipe. I let the meatballs rest in the freezer for a bit in hopes that they would hold up. They did, but still hard to handle. The meatballs by themselves were very good, but not as good in comparison to the amount of work. The second batch I made with 85/15 beef in a meatloaf format. Now we are talking! The flavors went perfect with the sauce (bison was overpowered by it). Much easier to put together and better tasting. Delicious. Served with pita bread and cucumber feta salad.

This is delicious!!! I will definitely make it again. The flavor combination is phenomenal. Taking heed of others' whose meatballs fell apart, I used an oiled mini-muffin pan to bake the little suckers; and they turned out great. Double or triple the recipe for a family main course(do it as a meatloaf!) or freeze the seasoned meat for later use. We served it with a cucumber salad for a well-rounded meal.

Made this recipe with ground beef rather than bison, it was delicious! Usd the leftovers on salmon, and had rave reviews. Will use this as a sauce for many dishes now. Thanks!

Quite tasty! Made as described and served over brown rice. Was able to cook the meatball on the stove top, just had to exercise car when flipping them over. Not sure if I would make again though as they were fairly labor intensive.

Very good, but quite a lot of work.

Very good recipe. I made it with bison. My meatballs also fell apart in the pan. Next time, I will cook them in the oven as others have done. But I have to say that the browned parts of the meat from frying them in the pan were quite good.

I make deer/turkey burger meatballs and keep them in the freezer. I put this over baked naan bread (found at Trader Joes or Indian Market.) Most importantly, add as much mint as cilantro to the yoghurt. The other herbs aren't as important (sage)

Until I made this recipe, I was not too sure about it. All the spices were not ones that I normally use. But, I must tell you this is absolutely delicious. I didn't bother grinding up the spices. I just put them in my blender along with the other ingredents. I did use fresh sage, mint,jalepeno, cilantro and of course garlic. I did use less breadcrumbs to save calories and non fat yogurt too. I just drain the liquid off the yogurt first to make it thicker. I shall make this again and again

Until I made this recipe, I was sure I hated cilantro! I had no mint - it's still good without it - and substituted ground turkey for bison. Lovely dish! Not quite as complicated as it looks - an immersion blender and a food processor make it a snap. Next time, I'll definitely make it as written.

this was a fairly time consuming and ingredient heavy, but the result was very good. my first time with bison, and from what i understand it's very lean and therefore needs alot for flavor. so, with his in mind, i think the recipe probably did wonders for a potentially dry meat. the flavors were very good. and the sauce delicious/ necessary. definitely added more yogurt to the sauce and probably also to the meatballs than called for... did not use fresh breadcrumbs, used a natural brand of plain breadcrumbs and did mix w. a bit of milk to soften them. did not fry on stovetop, but instead baked on a greased tray at 400F.

Very good recipe, but I recommend two changes (this is why this recipe merits 3 forks and not 4): first, don't use an entire 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs or your meatballs will have a mushy bland consistency. Use about 2-3 T instead. Second, don't puree the onions, breadcrumbs etc. first before adding them to the meat. If you chop the onion fine enough, you can put it straight into to the mixture without pureeing it. This will also improve the consistency of the meatballs. Overall, the flavor is very good and the yogurt sauce is excellent.

My daughter (who doesn't cook!) made this recipe for the family and it was phenomenal! She served it on a platter with the (whole wheat naan) flatbread cut in wedges and the bright green cilantro dip in a bowl...Our two guests each took the recipe home to make for future entertaining. She cooked the meatballs in the oven at 400F for 20 minutes rather than frying them and they were delicious. The dipping sauce was fresh tasting and complemented the seasoned meatballs very well. Using the bison meat which is naturally lean made this a great new years treat that felt like it was keeping within the healthy eating plan!

Made this recipe for a holiday party, and it turned out great. I used beef instead of bison, but the combination of spices and flavoring was very tasty and popular at the party. I thought the sauce needed a little more kick, so i threw in a garlic glove while blending.

Flavorful and a fun way to prepare bison. Fairly labor intensive though so I'm glad I doubled the recipe and froze two thirds of the uncooked meatballs. And, yes, it is middle eastern. Hence the title "Middle Eastern Bison Meatballs w/ Cilantro-Yogurt Sauce".

This recipe is delicious! We have it with pitas and hummus and it always tastes great!!

We made this exactly as written in the recipe. The pros: Delicious combination of flavors. The meatballs were very moist. The cons: The first batch of meatballs fell apart when we cooked them as directed. For the second batch, we baked them in a 400 degree oven for 12-15 minutes, which worked better. This is a fairly labor intensive recipe. Also I think I would describe it as Middle Eastern inspired rather than authentic. Very good, but I'm not sure I'll make again because of the effort involved and because they didn't hold together very well.

Both the meatballs and sauce were excellent. I used ground beef instead of bison.

I thought these meatballs were a bit dry, but with good flavor. The dipping sauce is delicious. They kept well for left-overs. Whole Foods usually has ground bison.

These meatballs were excellent. I made them with ground turkey instead of bison but kept everything else the same. They are really tender and full of flavor.
