Tasty and colorful. I'm always on the lookout for an appetizer/hors d'ouevre that is a bit different from the tired crudites and dip. This is a keeper. It's definitely time consuming to peel the tomatoes, but it's worth the effort. My guests were very appreciative.

What a fun, and delicious, dish. Yep, it is a bit time-consuming to peel the little tomatoes, but really a flavorful and fun dish. I did add just a pinch of red pepper flakes to the marinade to add a bit more spice.

My husband and I have a hard time waiting for the fresh cherry and grape tomatoes to appear at the Farmers Market. They have, and we're doing it tonight. We love this recipe. To the people who found it too salty - did you put the salt in the marinade? The salt is only supposed to be used for dipping after the tomatoes have marinated. You then control how much salt and pepper you pick up on the tomato when you dip. A little (me), a lot (him).

I made this with yellow and red cherry tomatoes, and it's the prettiest thing I've ever seen. These would be a great garnish - they're beautiful, not to mention delicious and a snap to prepare. Do try for the contrast in color if you can - so lovely to look at! I will definitely make these again and again!

i tried this and it was very disappointing. Sounded better than it was. Not worth the effort.

I had some extra cherry tomatoes and was hoping to like this recipe because it was so simple. Unfortunately, I don't think it worked. I was left with a bunch of tomatoes swimming in a pool of salty vodka. I can't imagine draining them and serving them as an appetizer, nor did they make a good side dish. The tomatoes would have been better had I just poured them in a bowl and served them raw.

This was a fun recipe. Except for the salt. It was much too salty. Next time I'd cut it back to 3 teaspoons, not Tablespoons
