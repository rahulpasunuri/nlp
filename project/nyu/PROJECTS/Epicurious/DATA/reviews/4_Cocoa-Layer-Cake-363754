Hmmm - I really expected more given the high marks on this recipe. First of all, the cake tastes flat and needs salt. The texture is fantastic, but the layers are so sticky to the touch that it's hard to assemble the cake. This was my first attempt at making a buttermilk chocolate cake (though I've eaten it before and loved it), and I will look for another recipe. Or make this as a sheet cake so I don't have to take the layers out of the pans. Like I said, the texture is GREAT, and flavor would be with the addition of salt to the cake batter.

I too found this to be an exceptional cake. I followed the recipe as written, with just one exception: I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream in the fronsting. We were pleased with both the cake and the frosting. The cake has a wonderful, chocolatey taste.

The four forks are for the frosting, which was outstanding. The cake was just meh--something about the brown sugar I didn't like. It gave the batter--and the cake--a weird consistency.

Have made this twice- no question it's worth every calorie. I forgot to put in the 2nd 1/2 c of water (found the recipe cumbersome) and it still was lucious. I also just use two cake pans and adjust the timing. My homemade raspberry jam between layers (at my son's request) made it sensational. The icing is over the top delicious! I usually send the leftover cake home with the birthday kid of the day, but had to keep some back for us to enjoy the next day. We like it because it is bittersweet- as we don't like sickening sweet icing.

Perfect! Everyone loved it. And surprisingly simple to make.

I will never make another chocolate cake again. Since this was in the Feb 2011 issue of BA I've made it for 5 birthdays and a wedding. The recipe is straight forward and the chocolate icing is the best ever. The only additions I have made are cinnamon and chili powder to the icing-which worked really well. It's moist, chocolatey and can be made in less than 2 hours. What's not to love?

Where did I go wrong? I am an experienced "amateur" baker. But, considering all the great reviews this recipe has had, it must be a great cake. So I can't figure out what I did wrong. The cake layers came out nice and it looked good after I finished the cake. But the frosting was way too bitter. The frosting did not taste like a yummy cake. This cake's frosting really that difficult to make. I appreciate any suggestions or ideas.

Yummy! Good crumb! Had to substitute almond extract in frosting since I ran out of vanilla. That proved to be the right touch. This will be my go to chocolate cake.

Love it! One of my family's favorite chocolate cake recipes. Most moist chocolate cake ever. Be careful moving the layers but believe me you can cover any breaks with icing and it still tastes amazing. Making it again tonight, made it for the first time back in Feb 2011. Yummy.

This is a very good cake and the frosting is rich and delicious. The cake texture is very tender and light. But for my taste, I prefer a denser-textured chocolate cake and the deeper, smoother chocolate flavor that comes with using quality chocolate. Cooking notes: Baking time for me was 12-13 minutes. The 3 layers are very thin. They easily released from the pan (I used parchment), but the layers are somewhat fragile and delicate. If the icing is just slightly too thick, the cake will tear while frosting it. So don't overchill the icing; it should be very spreadable. I also didn't have enough icing to frost the sides, which was fine because I think anymore icing would have overpowered the cake. I like the idea from another writer to increase the recipe by 1/2 so that the layers are not so thin. Or bake it in 2 pans instead. I think that the cake was not sturdy enough for the frosting. For the frosting, I ran out of cocoa so used 4 oz. of Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate. It worked just fine. This is a delicious spoon-licking frosting! The cake comes together easily and bakes quickly, so you don't have to wait too long to taste!

I doubled this recipe to make a large double layer cake for a party. It was the hit of the party! Too many comments to write them down, but people wholeheartedly agreed it was the best chocolate cake they ever had, including the frosting. I did not have buttermilk on hand, so I substituted in the homemade plain yogurt I have on hand.

no idea WHAT I did wrong except I didn't realize until too late I had raw sugar instead of brown sugar. I guess you can never be 100% sure you followed a recipe correctly but i was surprised that substitution would make the batter so liquid. I only had a side closure pan and it was so soupy it leaked all over the oven, I took it out and added a ton more flour until it was thick enough and put it back in the oven. AND IT WAS STILL AWESOME.

I made this as a wedding cake layered with the banana layer cake recipe and the fudge frosting recipe both found here and got rave reviews. This is a very moist and tasty cake.

I followed directions exactly with the exception of adding instant coffee instead of expresso powder. Decacdent fudgy cake, and the frosting was awesome, but I think next time I'll cut the coffee back a bit more....it was VERY strong.

I have made this cake twice, and every time it turned out delicious and rich. The first time I made this, I found that the espresso powder kind of made the icing not as good as I thought. The second time I made the cake was for one of my relatives birthday. That time, I left out the espresso powder, and put home made whipped cream (I bought a 500ml whipping cream instead of just a 250ml) and raspberries in between each layer. It was a HUGE hit!!! It was rich, flavourful and delicious! Icing the cake was a bit harder due to the whipped cream coming out the sides of the layers. Another tip is that yo make the cakes a day before. You can put them on a plate with a cake cover over top. Or, just put them on separate plates, cover with plastic wrap and leave in the fridge until about 10 minutes before icing. My version is a bit more kid friendly and for people who don't like strong coffee.

Made this cake today in two 9-inch pans instead of 3 with great success. The cake is extremely moist, and I am glad I used instant cofee instead of expresso for the frosting since it was very prominent. But overall, it was a HUGE hit. Comments included, "This is rich!" and "I usually don't eat frosting..." I expect that I will make the cake again...sooner than later.

This was a delicious cake. I made the cake in two round pans, and it worked perfectly. I layered the frosting in 3 layers between the halved cakes, and it was great! The mocha flavour was a bit strong though. I put a buttercream icing to cut the chocolate a bit, and garnished with raspberries. Divine.

Possibly the best chocolate cake I have ever baked or eaten. The frosting alone was to die for. The cake was still moist two weeks later (and yes, it did last that long in my house as there are only the two of us and we always have about five or six different desserts to choose from!). I baked the cake in 8" pans instead of 9" and just greased and floured them, didn't bother with non-stick paper, and it worked just fine. In fact, I think it made the cakes slightly less delicate than the recipe implied, I had no trouble releasing them from the pans after cooling for only 15 minutes. Definitely one to make repeatedly.

I used to have a legendary chocolate cake recipe and I lost it years ago. I have continued to search through the years for a similar recipe(the frosting was unique and that is what "made" the cake. It even made a boxed cake taste like it was from scratch!). THIS IS IT!! I am thrilled! I made the recipe as written and it was the best chocolate cake I've had in years. When making the frosting, I thought it may have had too much espresso powder,but when married with the cake, it was delicious. I may reduce the espresso powder to 1 tsp. if I am using the frosting with another cake. I will definitely NOT lose this recipe. One hint: If you don't wish to wait 1 1/2+ hours for the frosting to thicken in the fridge, place the bowl of frosting inside a larger bowl with ice and some water and stir until thickened. This is how my old recipe did it. Thanks BA!

Always found from-scratch baking to be a dicey proposition. This cake -- this glorious cake! -- has offered a glimmer of hope to this sometime baker. Fantabulous result, following directions exactly. (Must have been good if I hunted down the recipe months later by an internet search engine, right?) This will be my forever chocolate cake. Amen.

Excellent cake recipe, a little goes a long ways, I filled the layers with a creamy white buttercream flavored with peppermint; the ganache was excellent, not too sweet; everyone loved it and I have had a lot of requests for the recipe...going to be a "staple" for my home based catering business

Made this as part of a Valentine's Day wine dinner for 6. The reviews across the table were in a word "WOW". Super intense chocolate/coffee flavor with a wonderfull moist cake. Served with a Ruby Port Wine and fresh brewed coffee. It does not get much better than this !

I baked this cake on Sunday for Valentine's Day. Two modifications to the recipe: - I didn't have any instant espresso, so I made a 4-shot cup of espresso and reduced it to less than an ounce. - When I served the slices, I drizzled a spoonful of sour cream over each slice, providing for a wonderful tart touch. This cake is very good and simple to make.

Great Cake! It stores well. It was still moist 3 days later. Definitely a "do again recipe".

1. I didn't read the part where I was supposed to alternately add flour and then buttermilk to the mixture correctly. Instead I put all the flour in (in three additions) and then put the buttermilk in (in two additions). It did not affect the batter at all! 2. Had my cakes in for 18 minutes. I did not line my pans with parchment paper; so when banging out my cakes to cool, they literally tore into two pieces. I was able to meticulously put their respective pieces together but I would strongly recommend putting the parchment paper down in the pan since this cake is super moist! 3. I added exactly 2 teaspoons of expresso powder, tasted like the right amount to me. BUT to be fair, my expresso powder is old. This recipe also uses a lot of bowls! Pretty straight-forward though, would make this again!

This is a very moist chocolate cake with terrific flavor. The batter is very wet, but it works. I increase the recipe by 1/2 to make 3 layers. Otherwise, I would make a two layer cake with the recipe as is. I also was not up for chocolate on chocolate, so I paired it with vanilla frosting. This is my new go-to chocolate cake. Note that 1/4 tsp salt is mentioned in the instructions, but is not on the ingredients list for some reason.

Best chocolate cake ever! Followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out perfectly. I was concerned about the thin layers but it worked well. Served it for dessert last night and everyone went crazy over it. Almost had to beat my wife to keep her away from the frosting as I was assembling the cake.

Incredible! So soft & tender, and intense bittersweet/dark chocolate flavor. Since some reviewers said cake layers were really thin, and I only have 2 cake pans, I just divided the batter between two pans, and it worked out quite well. I also used instant coffee instead of instant espresso with no problem. The cake looked beautiful too. Will definitely make again.

Very yummy chocolate cake. The cake is very tender, but I didn't have any trouble with it falling apart. I felt the frosting, though delicious, was a tad too strong for the cake- next time I'll only add 1 tsp. espresso powder. A big hit!

Made this for Sunday night dinner. My children and grandchildren voted it their favorite chocolate cake ever, even better than their previous favorite, Bittersweet Chocolate Cake. I made it a day ahead and it was perfect, if a bit tender.

A very fragile cake, my second layer fell apart as I was stacking it for frosting. I pieced it back together. The frosting seemed too bold for a delicate cake. But, it sure looked good.

I couldn't believe how tasty this was. I made it as a birthday cake for my sister-in-law and the cake disappeared. Even my fussy son had 2 huge pieces! It's moist and the icing is fun to make and eat!

This cake moved me to write my first review. It is a GREAT cake! My husband who is not a chocolate lover like I am, really enjoyed this cake too. The layers are light and the frosting decadent. Use the recipe as is. I wouldn't change a thing! When I removed the cake from the pans I found it easier & safer to invert onto a plate and then slide onto the frosted layers.

If you want CHOCOLATE + CHOCOLATE... this is your recipe. The cake is moist and the frosting is decadently rich, but there was an unanticipated outcome. I was expecting a "layer cake" but this is more like a torte or European- style cake. When I was reviewing the recipe, I noted that the volume of batter seemed somewhat scant for three 9-inch cake pans, so I used 8-inch cake pans. Even so, the layers were only 1/2-inch high. Next time I would double the batter for deeper layers which I think would create a better balance for the overwhelmingly rich frosting.

Made this for my chocolate-loving son's birthday and he loved it. I made it one day ahead and it was still moist and perfect. Looked great too. The frosting is very easy and delicious. Great chocolate cake.
