I made this last night for tonight's Valentines dinner... tasted it this morning and it is AMAZING! Can't wait until tonight!

This is my fist time reviewing... I'd have to say that I love the flavor. Only made this recipe twice... and so far I've had trouble both times with the texture. I pulled it out of the fridge 12 hours later and there is a liquidy layer under the fluffiness??? I'm wondering from other reviews written if perhaps I over cooked the egg yolk & choc. mixture a bit? Otherwise I used good fresh eggs, nice chocolate, was careful to not break down the whites etc etc etc... Help!

Divine. Made for a bridal shower (bride loves her chocolate dark and bitter!) and topped with a variation on the Balsamic Strawberries with Whipped Mascarpone Cheese recipe also on this site. Spooned smaller servings into nine cups, wish I'd just doubled it because every cup was licked clean. Yum.

To the cook from Washington DC...I don't think it's as much to do with less-potent cooling systems as it is the high humidity. Here in Guam, where it's sweltering year-round, it's difficult to make anything involving yeast, meringue, or mousse.

As a first timer, maybe I shouldn´t have tried out the recipe while on vacation in steamy Brazil. Everything seemed fine, but when I went to serve the mousse 15 hours after putting it in the fridge, after breaking the sponge-y surface, it looked more like a runny pudding underneath. Is the cooling system in the tropics less potent? What did i do wrong?!

I love this recipe, but I find it a little too sweet as it is, even using bittersweet chocolate. Try reducing the sugar by at least one tablespoon (I cut it in half!).

This was good but not great. Being a huge chocolate fan, I enjoyed it but I think it was too rich for many of my guests.

A great recipe. The first time I tried it I didn't whip the whites enough and it turned out a little too dense. Try using Chambord or another raspberry flavoured liquor instead of vanilla extract, garnishing with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and fresh raspberries. I've successfully tripled the recipe for a larger dinner party without too much difficulty.

to the cook who made the mousse on 1/28/04: The rubbery bits in your mousse may have come from letting the sugar sit in the eggs when you added it. Sugar is hygroscopic (meaning it absorbs liquid) and will absorb some of the egg's liquid if it sits in it at all, thereby making those nasty little specks. WHISK immediately anytime you add sugar to eggs for at least 30 seconds to prevent it.

I made this twice, and the second time was better than the first. The first time I beat the egg whites ahead - big mistake, since it separated a bit and was hard on top. Hence a floppy mousse that did not have that light texture. The second time it came out better. The only trouble we had was a few tiny chewy pieces of what looked like egg white. Not sure why that happened. The kind of chocolate you use will ultimately affect the taste - we used Ghiradelli, which has a slightly nutty flavour.

This is a fabulous, traditional chocolate mousse recipe! I serve it often at dinner parties and my guests ALWAYS remark that it is the best they have ever been served. If it is to heavy....I fear that you allowed the eggs and milk to either cook to long, or over to high of heat.

I have never reviewed an epicurious recipe, but I feel I must warn all of you that this recipe is very underwhelming - this is not dense mousse with little flavor other than what comes from the chocolate. I definitely believe that mousse benefits from the edition of espresso or liqueur -find a better recipe - this one is awful.

I substituted heavy/whipping cream for whole milk (since I already bought the cream to serve this with fresh-whipped cream), and it turned out even more delicious!

Easy mousse recipe, although it was denser than I would have expected for a mousse. It was still delicious and everyone raved about it. Definitely use good chocolate for this recipe.

This was a nice easy dessert that definately satiated my chocolate craving. It was almost too much though. I love dark chocolate, but I thought it needed a lot of whipping cream and that made it ultra rich and filling.

Very rich. Used good, quality chocolate with great results. Topped with homemade whipped cream to break up the heaviness a bit.

Great recipe, worked perfect for my first attempt ever at mousse. I just followed the instructions and was careful not to heat the yolk mixture too much as a previous reviewer mentioned. If you over cook it (as I did at a later time), it can alter the texture of the final product. That said, it still tasted great. I used Callebaut chocolate, for an intense flavour.

Excellent! I was a first time mousse maker and I found this receipe to be easy and rich in flavor. I made it a day ahead and added fresh whipped cream and chocolate shavings just before serving and found it to be as pretty as it was tasty. Enjoy.

This is such an easy recipe. It's very sweet, but not too heavy on the fat. I would cut back slightly on the sugar, but overall, this is a wonderful ending to a fabulous meal. Serve with a few raspberries and some whipped cream.

Simple and gorgeus.

I loved the rich flavor of this recipe and will definitely make it again. One problem I had, which fortunately didn't affect the taste, was a layer of liquid at the bottom of the glass dish in which I chilled the mousse. Can anyone tell me why this happened? Perhaps I didn't whip the egg whites enough?

This was delicious - very deep and dark chocolate tasting. At first I thought it was going to be runny, but after some time in the frig, it held its shape nicely. I used it to fill creme puff shells and it was a taste sensation!

Wow! I am a chocoholic and this DID ME IN! Very chocolatey, great texture...a great dinner party dessert.

I made this for my 9th grade french class and it was a total smash!!! Everyone loved it and it even boosted my grade. I should point out that I can barely make boxed mac and cheese but this recipe is so quick and easy even I had no trouble.

This was GREAT!!! I had made chocolate mousse before but it was a DISASTER!! Don't ever make it if the recipe calls for unflavored gelatin! :} But this recipe was wonderful!! It was quite sweet, I made whipped cream to put on top that added a good flavor to it. I'm going to make it again!! Only thing I did was I used semi-sweet chocolate not bittersweet.

Just made this for the first time. It tastes very good, but not as good as the other cooks were able to make it. It said it serves 6. I served it in martini glasses -- about 3/4"-1" from the top, and I just barely had 4 servings. In fairness, I am not a dessert maker. Perhaps my egg whites were not fluffy enough (less volume) and it wasn't as light as it should have been. Still -- great reviews from guests, and I will be trying this again.

Fabulous! I just made it for a dinner party and everyone was raving. They all want the recipe. It was very easy. I made it in the morning, transferred it to goblets and let it chill all day in the fridge. I served it with a dollap of whipped cream and shaved chocolate. Beautiful!

Excellent & extremely easy. This recipie performs everytime. Most important detail - make at least 6 hours ahead.

Meets all my qualifications....good, easy, and can be done in advance!

This was incredibly easy, fast and everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe and filled 12 Champagne glasses half way, topped it with whipped cream, shavings and spiral shaped cookie. My hint for success, DO NOT over cook when you add the egg yolk to the chocolate. If you are not careful with the heat, you'll get mini cooked egg bits and the texture will not be smooth. Other than that it's almost a guaranteed success!!

This recipe is very easy to make. It was a big hit with my family. Will make this for next dinner party.

Best made the day before, to allow the eggs to mellow. I use Valhrona chocolate, which imparts a fruity subtlty to this dish. Any orange flavored liquor, or frangelico added to the whipped cream adds another dimension to this satisfying dessert; one to two tablespoons is sufficient of the liquor.
