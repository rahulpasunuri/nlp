I love this hummus recipe. And, if you put it on Great Harvest Dakota bread, this recipe is a WOW.

OK but nothing great to wow a crowd or even your family

Tasty for sure and great for lunch. Followed recipe mostly, but used goat cheese instead of feta, and store bought hummus instead of recipe version. I will try adding thinly sliced red onion, sprouts, or maybe olives next time.

Definitely needed more olive oil to get the right consistency in the hummus- even aiming for a thick spread. I used Pepperidge farm 15 grain bread and topped with feta, cucumbers and alfalfa sprouts. Who needs meat in a sandwich when this is so delicious?

The Hummus & Feta Sandwiches are wonderfully healthy and enjoyable to the taste buds! Plus, so easy to make with my Cuisinart emergent blender. I find the hummus truly delicious on fresh vegetable sticks,whole grain crackers, and on wrap sandwiches too!

I absolutely love this sandwhich and have made it again and again. The combination of flavors is right on for me. The freshness of the mint and cucumber with the earthiness of the humus all rounded out with the salty, tang from the feta- Yum! I love spicy so I add an extra jalapeno and sometimes slice up avocado as well. A keeper for sure but I do see how this might not suit everyone's palate.

Pretty basic folks. Make it as is. Very good and healthy. Try using different beans for variety.

I love hummus and feta on whole wheat bread. This recipe was just so-so. But with more flavor and textures, this can be really tasty and healthy too! I also added sliced red onion and sprouts as sandwich fillers.

wow was this terrible. it might have been better if i hadn't tried to make the home-made hummus (which had entirely too much garlic in it). my husband eats *anything* and he couldn't eat more than a bite of this.

A good mix of flavours and textures. I used lime juice (I didn't have any lemons) and put more than the recipe and put more olive oil than the recipe also. I liked the jalapeno in it also.

It was very good. A good mix of flavors. Instead of using the cilantro I used parsley. I left the jalapeno's out of the recipe because I didn't have any. I would make it again!

I didn't have high hopes for this sandwich but it is one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. I used Trader Joe's "Six Grain Bread with Pumpkin Seeds" which is thick and chewy and slightly sweet. The combination of the jalapeno hummus, the aalty feta and the mildly sweet bread was just delicious. This will become a staple recipe. One note: I did have to add 2 teaspoons of water to the hummus because it was too thick for my taste. I highly recommend this.
