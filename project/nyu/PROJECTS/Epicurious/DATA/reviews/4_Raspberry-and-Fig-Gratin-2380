So easy and delicious. I used plain no-fat yogurt instead of sour cream. I prepared separate ramekins for each person.

Love a dessert that tastes this good and takes all of 10 minutes! I just put 7-8 raspberries at the bottom of each ramekin, topped with fig slices (1/4 inch - slices layer better than quarters), sour cream and brown sugar. Definitely serve this right out of the oven. The brightness of the raspberry and the creamy rich goodness of figs and sour cream was a huge hit at our house. Excellent way to serve fresh figs quickly.

It needed just a little more sweetness so I added a touch of orange blossom honey right before serving. It was a hit.

Super good use of ripe figs. Cooked it a bit long more like 15 minutes. I served it over vanilla ice cream. So the runny factor was nice ;-) Prob could skip the sour cream next time if we do the ice cream again.

Really easy dish for when figs are are in season. It was a crowd pleaser at my dinner party.

In my garden, the blackberries are ripe the same time as the figs. This is great with blackberries instead of raspberries.

Made this last night in large tart dish -it was delicious and loved by everyone. Next time I will make in individual ramekins. Plating was a little messy looking. Individual servings would be more elegant. Can't get any easier.

What a simple and delicious dessert. I used figs only from my potted tree, 'petite negra' variety, the first crop of significant quantity. The lovely juice made me think that it would be good served over a cookie or shortcake, next time maybe.

This sounded great but I didn't have raspberries on hand so I used fresh blueberries. It was wonderful. I have a fig tree and this is a quick and easy way to use them. Try this you will love it.

I make this in individual ramekins. I put a layer of raspberries on the bottom, creme fraiche, cover with slices of fresh figs, top with brown sugar, broil until the sugar caramelizes on the figs. I found the original recipe delicious but a little watery in the larger dish and not as easy to serve.
