If I could give 0 forks, I would have done it here! This recipe is terrible. Firstly, the amounts make no sense - I doubled the juice and barely had 20. But I was glad when I tasted them that I didn't have any more - if I wanted Jello, I'd make it, and without having to buy expensive fruit nectars!! This is the first epi recipe I've ever made (and I make lots) that I think is truly awful. It does not deserve a place on this site.

I used agar agar, because we are vegetarian, and they came out nicely.

Kind of disappointing. They look so beautiful in the photo and they look beautiful when made, but the texture isn't as palatable as the appearance. I might try with different nectars. Perhaps lighter in color or translucent. I used blackcurrant, peach and blood orange. I think I might try watermelon, honeydew and pear.
