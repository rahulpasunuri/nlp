I cooked it down a LOT more, came out great! Better than anything off the store shelf. Might try it with a savory herb in the mix next time.

I am a jam-making novice, and wish I had tried a different recipe. I carefully made this recipe twice today. I now have multiple jars of very sweet strawberry sauce. By the way, if you follow the recipe on the amount of strawberries, you will end up with WAY more than 4 cups - the second time I made this, I ended up filling 8 half-pint jars!

The only problem I have with this recipe is the quantity of strawberries. why on earth would it call for 4 1/2 pints. so irritating to figure the proportions of sugar and lemon for preparing a flat of strawberries (8 quarts). I'm certainly preventing alzheimer's with this one!

This was my firat attempt at making real jam, and I have to say this recipe is both easy and delicious. It turned not-so flavorful grocery store strawberries into a wonderful jam.

This is the first jam recipe I've used without adding sure-jell or extra pectin and I was pleasantly surprised at the results. I did have to cook it for about an extra 25 minutes before the consistancy was correct. Very tasty!

A note on food safety....boiling in water bath is necessary for safe storage. Having warm jars does not seal the jam. Once the jars have been processed, and cooled, the lid will indent...the sign that a safe seal has been made. Also - directions were not given for sterilizing jars, as one reviewer thought...for sterilizing jars, boil for 10 minutes minimum. Sealing parts of lids should be boiled for 5 minutes to prepare seal. Also, lids cannot be reused.

There is no need to process the jam in pressure cooker. Alternative is to boil the jars and tops before making the jam, keep them warm on a cookie sheet in a 200 degree oven. Then when the jam is finished cooking, fill the jars and seal them..when they cool, tighten the lids and you are all set.

Loved it! I have made two batches already and I have to make a third -- my family and friends keep asking for it.

This is the best jam ever. I have made about 4 batches in the last two years and it is gorgeous. Follow recipe to the letter except I let boil/simmer for 30 mins. I did not put in water bath rather I had my jars go through the dishwasher on sani cycle and timed them to be ready the same time that the jam was ready. I made this jam with organic strawberries. Wonderful;

I'd never made jam before, and yet this jam is tremendous. I especially appreciated the inclusion of the directions for sterilizing jars.
