Ok, this was extremely good. Would be happy to get this in any 4* restaurant. I made one big change and one minor one. First, I used salmon, instead of red snapper. I blackened it in a very hot pan, but I am sure you oould poach or broil it. The sauce is what made it delicious. Second, I sliced the sweet potatoes as directed, but roasted them with a small amount of olive oil and sea salt in a 400 degree oven. Rest of recipe as directed. Very good!

The taste is great and light. I will make this again. However, I agree with those who think there is needless work in this recipe. Next time, I'll either just saute or bake the fish, and in a separate pan, I'll stirfry the vegetables. And I'll probably skip the sweet potatoes which didn't seem to add much, and put the whole thing over rice.

In the U.S. Coriander known as Cilantro.

i substituted talipia since both grouper and red snapper are currently on the national seafood watch (avoid) list. also the boiled potatoes were a waste of time so the second time i julienned them and added them to the peppers in the stir fry. i made the sauce and stir fried the vegetables and held them on plates in a warm oven, then just fried the fish and put it on top. it was much easier and the flavor was unchanged, still excellent.

The spicy soy glaze is good but the recipe as a whole is way to involved. I would make the glaze for a stir fry, maybe the fish and skip the sweet potatoes: serve over rice.

this recipe was delicious! i used a different selection of vegetables, simply fresh green beans and carrots, with the same dressing and fresh red snapper. the combination of the coriander and vinegar and the soy glaze complement the fish extraordinarily well. i will definitely make this recipe again.

I think this recipe had too much going on to really work for me. The fish was very good and I liked the glaze (although I thought it had too many shallots. The vegetables were good, but it was just too much with the sweet potatoes. Maybe if it had just the sweet potatoes...I just don't think I'd make it again.

this sauce was awesome, but does NOT need 1/2 c soy sauce (waaaay too salty), just use 1/4 c soy and 1/4 c water or chx stock. i used a mix of shallots, onions, and garlic and substituted peach preserves for the apricot/plum. i also added a couple squeezes of blood orange to balance out the saltiness. i skipped the potato thing altogether and just grilled the snapper and veggies and served w/sauce over rice.

I forgot to add that I reduced the soy sauce in the glaze to 1/4 cup because I ran out & made up the difference with water. I was glad I did--it would have been too salty otherwise and it allowed the flavor of the lime to come out.

I'd make this all the time if it didn't involve so much chopping! Very delicious, light and healthy--just be prepared to spend some time in the kitchen. Don't skip the sweet potatoes, but I made mine in the microwave to simplify things a bit.

This was an excellent combination of flavors. The only change I would make would be to use a low salt soy sauce for the glaze, as it was a litte too salty for my taste.

This was really good. The only change I would make is that I would eliminate the carrots - they seemed to overpower the rest of the vegetables. I had glaze and vegetables left over, so I added some bok choy and had excellent vegetable leftovers the second day.

This was my first experience cooking fish, and on top of that, I didn't even have all of the proper ingredients for the sauce. Amazingly, it STILL turned out wonderfully!

I guess I'm the only negative vote here. I thought the sauce was good but I felt it TOTALLY overpowered the dish. I would prefer to use the sauce on chicken or pork. I used grouper - maybe that was the problem? I will say the dish presents beautifully. I did not use any potatoes at all.

Wonderful combination of textures and flavors -- and the sauce ties it all together perfectly. Would definitely recommend these recipes. Really high quality fare.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The sweet potatoes were an interesting and delicious touch and the glaze was fabulous.

Delicious, but would leave out the sweet potato next time--just doesn't go well with the rest of the dish--too sweet.

I couldn't find red snapper, so I used tuna instead. This recipe was delicious! It even got my husband to eat the healthy dish. The glaze is excellent.

Quite time consuming but tasty and very impressive-looking if you can manage it.

This is a great dish to make if you really want to impress your friends. It's time consuming, but the result is a beautiful looking dish that is delicious.

Very good. I coated the snapper with rice flour and pan sauteed the fish then finished it off in the oven. I made a wild mushroom lemon risotto and used it instead of the sweet potatoes. I added asparagus tips to the vegetables.

i've been making this recipe since it first came out in gourmet. as i was scrolling thru the fish recipes, came across this and was reminded how much i enjoy it! Looking forward to making it soon.

Good but not fabulous. I love sweet potatoes but think it would have been better with rice and the soy glaze was a bit on the salty side. Maybe use low-salt soy sauce.

I was a little hesitant to make this because there were so many ingredients (with the spicy soy glaze) - it turned out fantastic. I substituted swordfish for red snapper, cilantro for coriander, and Savoy (??) cabbage for Napa cabbage. The only subsitutue I used that I was not crazy about is the cabbage...it did not get soft enough no matter how long I cooked it. All in all, an excellent dish with a little spice to it and an Asian flare.

Great combination of flavours. I did make some changes, grouper for the snapper, brown sugar for white, I pureed the Soy glaze (I thought that the original glaze competed in texture with the veggies) Next time I will serve it on mashed potatoes possibly with rutabaga, instead of the sweet. Definitely a keeper, and something to build on.

Really tasty! I actually used swordfish steaks instead, and it was just as good!

Exotic, worthy of an expensive restaurant describes this recipe, including the glaze. I substituted some items (scallions for shallots, Georgia peach butter for plum jam, regular cabbage for whatever Napa cabbage is, fresh grouper fillet for snapper). It has a delicious mildly spicy, Asian flavor and would probably be excellent with grilled fresh, medium rare tuna as a substitiute for snapper or grouper. Be sure to cook the fillets longer than recommended if they are more than about 1/2 inch thick. Next time I'd probably dispense with the skin. Often a "fishy" flavor derives from the dark meat along the lateral line or adjacent to the skin; dark flesh should always be removed in any fish recipe. USE FRESH FISH. Fabulous!
