I've tried this twice now with my own sauerkraut and duck confit and it curdled both times. It was somewhat tasty, but the texture--no thanks. I can't think of how to save this from breaking (I followed the recipe both times) so I will not make this again. Ever.

This was a little too solid for my taste. Next time I will cook it in a bain marie and take it out while it still wobbles. I will also use whole milk instead of cream. There's an awful lot of fat in this dish and I've had good luck with quiche fillings using milk only.

I substituted one of the cups of cream for 1/2 cup of whole milk and 1/2 cup plain yogurt. The dish turned out great.

Wonderful dish! Had to sub light for heavy cream and the result was sublime. Highly recommended.

I couldn't get duck, so added some crumbled bacon to the dish, and added a little more bacon to the top, at the end of cooking, to give a bit of crunch to the dish. Also, added bread crumbs at the end. A yummy, hearty, but not overwhelming side dish. I served it with schnitzel and greens salad.

Wonderful dish! Missed out on the cracklings as I had shredded my confit for storage weeks earlier. Subbed with rye breadcrumbs toasted in butter.

The duck cracklings are even better than bacon!

Initially this combination seemed a little odd, but I'm very glad to have taken a chance on it! Like the first reviewer, I used the duck confit that Costco carries. I substituted some gin for the juniper berries during the onion cooking stage. The dish super tasty and the sauerkrat plays well and just makes it really interesting. Next time I'll back off the heavy cream a bit more and see how light it can go without compromising the taste.

I made this twice using Costco duck confit, and to rave reviews, even from kids (5-17). It is wonderfully scrumptious with a nice balance of duck/gratin richness balanced by the slightly piquant sauerkraut. Great dinner party fare, I made an hour ahead and served at room temp.
