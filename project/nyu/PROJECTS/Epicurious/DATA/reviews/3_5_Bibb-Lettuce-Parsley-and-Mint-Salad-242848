Nice and light; dressing is simple and easy. I used Bibb and green leaf lettuce; have also added a bit of fresh ground pepper and sea salt right before serving.

Sorry to be the dissenter. I've had some excellent mint salads, but, this is not one of them. Though I am not sure what, this salad is definitely missing something.

We made nearly everything on the SprigTime menu. The parsley and mint were a surprisingly excellent combo. Tastes and looks like summer. Try it!

This salad absolutely took me by surprise. You must make this or you have missed one of the tastiest salads.

Any firm lettuce can be used...escarole is great also.. finely diced onion gives it a bite.
