This was such a lovely dish. My husband is a vegetarian, and I'm not. I've caught the cooking bug and this is often an issue. However, I made this recipe with a few changes (I used Crimini and Porcini mushrooms, a non-chicken broth and organic white wine. I did have the truffle oil, which was beautiful!) It was such an amazing dish - my husband ate 3 servings. Thank you for this!!!

This is a delicious recipe, grat for vegetarians. I was suprised at the complex flavors. Definitly use the truffle oil at the end.

The flavours are really well balanced. Nice earthiness from the mushrooms which plays well with the herbs. The nicest thing about this recipe is that you can walk away from it, unlike most risotto recipes which require constant attention.

This is phenomenal. It was my first risotto attempt and I am addicted to them now! I added the broth slowly. I agree, it took well over 20 minutes for the broth adding process so start early for dinner parties. I drizzled with truffle oil which really deepened the earthy taste of the mushrooms. Be patient, enjoy the process, and you can have a great meal with this recipe!

DELICIOUS!!! We substituted baby portabella mushrooms for crimin and used chicken stock instead of vegetable.Agree, a little stock at a time, let it absorb in. We used all frea sh herbs and added the truffle oil at the end. We loved it!

Why don't chefs include the most important ingredient when giving a recipe? ie: TIME! Risotto is all about time, patience and without being didactic TIME. Good god. It's not complicated you guys, the recipe is adequate but frankly uninspiring! Risotto needs to be carressed, all the stock in one go! frankly.... Time you guys, give your risotto time, thats all it needs, and a little love and respect!

i also added the vegetable stock slowly and let the rice absorb it. Took longer than expected but made it more tender. I also added fresh asparagus, which I boiled and immersed in ice water separately. Then added in at the end with cheese and butter. The dish was tasty but very heavy. Got thick quickly. Not as creamy as I expected, but still good.

No wonder this turned into a porridge mess for one of the reviewers. I've never even heard of a risotto recipe that calls for all of the broth to be added at once. That's simply not risotto by any definition. PS I AM Italian and am certainly not misinformed regarding this issue.

to the cook from chicago: hey, i was taught by an italian to make risotto. plus, every single recipe for risotto i've ever *seen* calls for broth mixture to be added gradually, usually 1/2 c at a time. when i first made it (before i was taught properly), i added liquid all at once, but that's because i made it from a box. risotto, when made properly, is creamy and delectable.

I agree that it is much better to add the stock slowly, not all at once. Risotto rice is much different to ordinary rice, and the creaminess should be developed by adding stock slowly, and by stirring to 'massage' the grains, encouraging the creamy texture to form. Also, it is best to *not* cook the mushrooms in the risotto base, but to cook them seperately and add them towards the end. Otherwise. the mushrooms are very well done, and can even tend towards chewiness. But of couse it's all down to personal preference in the end. My preference is this way, as I find much more consistent results. Enjoy!

To the cook from San Antonio del Mar, Mexico... I've watched my grandmother and mother make Risotto many times, and neither of them added the broth slowly nor, did they saute' the mushrooms separately. Maybe the person who wrote the recipe isn't cracked or lazy, maybe you're just misinformed.

You don't make risotto by tossing in the broth all at once. That's rice, not risotto. Risotto achieves its traditional creamy and al dente texture by adding the broth slowly and stirring until it's almost completely absorbed. The best Italian chefs recommend only 1/2 cup at a time. I've gotten lazy and used 3/4 cup at a time, but it does somewhat affect the texture. It will use all of the broth that way. To a cup of arborio, I use 5 cups of broth and a 1/2 cup of whatever wine I'm going to use. No WAY should you add the mushrooms at the beginning of the cooking. They should be sauteed separately and added with the last portion of broth. They'd overcook if they were added at first. Also, to give this more depth, pre-soak a package of dried porcinis, chop them and add them to the other mushrooms when sauteeing. Save and strain the soaking liquid through cheesecloth and add it right after the wine. The porcinis make a HUGE difference in the taste of a wild mushroom dish. Made the traditional way, you wouldn't need more than 1 cup of rice for 4 main course servings. The person that wrote this recipe is lazy or cracked or both.

I really enjoyed this recipe; however, my husband didn't care for it. It's very rich and creamy - I would make it again.

We loved this dish, however we made the following mods: We substituted Chicken broth for Vegeta ble broth, and added it "as needed". We ended up usingn less than 4 cups, where the Recipe calls for 5 1/2. We also used some dried morels and a few slices of truffle, along with our wild mushrooms.

ALthough some of the previous comments made me wary, I made this dish for a dinner party last night. It was great!! I used crimini, button and shitake mushrooms. The only thing I did differently than proscribed was to add the broth slowly, letting the rice soak it up each time instead of adding it all at once. Two thumbs up!

I didn't make this recipe but I think if you make a smaller batch it comes out better. 2 cups of rice in one pan seems like a lot.

Good mushroom flavour. Recipe halves easily.

This was my first time making risotto. It was just like a thick chinese porridge with herbs and cheese. It was nothing special. I probably won't be making this dish again.

Lovely recipe. Easy to make and very tasty. Nice, creamy risotto that my family loved. I recommend it highly to anyone who likes risotto and mushrooms--great combination!
