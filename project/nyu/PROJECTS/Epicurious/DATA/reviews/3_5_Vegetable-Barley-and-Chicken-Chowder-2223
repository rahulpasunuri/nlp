Lots of flavor here. I'm allergic to corn so I left that out. I used a can of drained garbanzo beans in place of the lima beans. Added 2 minced cloves of garlic. Used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock. Instead of cooked chicken, I cooked a chicken breast on top, then removed the skin and bones and chopped up the meat and threw that in at the end. The juices that came off that breast added a lot to the flavor I think. This one's a keeper!

This makes enough to feed an army which is a great thing with a yummy soup. Mine tasted strange like a canned taste. I make soup several times a week and I was really disappointed. Next time I'll try adding some Parmesan rinds in the beginning. To fix the current vat I pureed 3 chiptoles en adobo with their liquid and now my husband is wolfing it down. Start with 1 and work your way up to get just the right spicy-ness.

I just finished making and eating this recipe. Husband and I both liked it. I followed the recipe except for using Edamame beans instead of lima beans and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I was very surprised that not frying onions worked just fine. I always thought I HAD to fry them first. Live and learn. I cooked up a couple of chicken breasts/backs. I will definitely make this soup again. I think it's actually good for us! A winner!

I make this soup frequently and it is a family favorite. I saute onions and carrots first in a little olive oil, and then throw in the rest of the ingredients. Never use the chicken, however I do use chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth. Rarely use the red pepper. Often use fresh corn I cut off the cob. Delicious!

Quick, easy and healthy. Left out the Lima Beans. Used Turkey and homemade turkey broth. Added some chopped turnip. Used about 1 tsp of thyme and 1 tbs of sage and lots of ground pepper.

Foolproof and delicious. Make it exactly as written, or use it as a basic stew recipe and make substitutions. I often heat onion and garlic in olive oil first and then throw in everything else. Sometimes I skip broth and just use water and it still comes out amazing. Good w/ halved new potatoes. I always put 2/3 cups barley and very often leave out the bell pepper.

How is this soup so yummy? I used what I had at home: edamame instead of lima beans, canned lentils instead of dried, rice instead of split peas. I used turkey and homemade turkey stock. On top of being delicious, this has got to be so healthy!

What a good soup, not sure I'd call it a chowder. Perfect for a very snowy night in Maine. We will make this again.

Fantastic! I substituted edamame for the lima beans, and although I did add grilled chicken breast, I think beef or lamb would have been better. Regardless, it was delectable. The split peas thickened the broth, and the flavors and textures were so satisfying. Add some crusty bread and you have a perfect New England winter meal.

I made this recipe as a first course for a winter dinner party I was having (6 people) and had enough left overs for 3.5 lunch servings. The guests at the party requested the recipe because they thought it was so good and even when I heated it up for lunch at work, 6 people at work said it smelled so good they wanted the recipe as well! It is a surprisingly satisfiying and TASTY soup.

I made this soup because it looked tasty & hardy enough for a cold New England night, plus I had all the veggies in the house (& wouldn't have to go out into that cold New England weather). It turned out just OK, the whole being less that the sum of its many tasty ingredients.

My husband hates lima beans, so I left them out and also left out the split peas, but increased the lentils and barley to about 1/3 cup each. Now this is our favorite hearty soup!

I left out the lima beans and the split peas and doubled the barley. The soup was edible, nothing special and a bit gummy.

One of my favorite soups. I add a splash or two of shiraz while cooking for a full bodied taste. The addition of parm. cheese on top for serving is an added taste. Good even without the chicken.

I thought this soup was great. I subsistuted chicken broth for the vegetable broth, used all barley instead of the split peas and lentils. I also added a teaspoon of minced garlic. It added flavor. The soup tasted hearty and healthy. I would definitely make it again.

I thought this soup was rather blah. It was certainly hearty, but all of those different textures need to be matched with different flavors. Plus, this soup tastes too "healthy." We were far too aware that we were eating our vegetables.

My husband raves about and craves this soup. I substituted cannellini beans for the lima beans and replaced the split peas by doubling the barley. The barley absorbs lots of liquid so I increased the broth by 2 cups. The soup is thick and very satisfying!

This is a good, basic soup that is incredibly easy to make. I certainly wouldn't make it if I was trying to impress a guest, but it is great to have for an everyday lunch or supper now and again. I added 50% more of the peas and barley to make it heartier.

This was a big hit with my family. Hearty and flavorful. Will definitely make this again!

Loved this recipe. Instead of chicken I added a chopped thick slice of smoked chicken from the deli. I thought it enhanced the flavour tremendously!

WOW!"Delicious soup sweetheart" says my husband tonight and I agree. So easy and such a pleasure to stir while cooking. Very attractive and comforting on a rainy,cold night. I'll be making this often, so as to try and store some in the freezer. Gotta have cornbread with it!

Made this recipe tonight - my husband loved it, I thought it was pretty good too. I substituted cannellini beans for the lima, used homemade chicken stock and used one 14 oz can of whole tomatoes, one 14 oz can of diced. I like sage, so I used a whole tablespoon, and added thyme too. It seemed a little bit tomatoey, and perhaps a little light on the barley/lentils, but overall a nice flavor and colorful. Went well with corn bread.

This recipe made a rich, stew like chowder that was very flavorful. I substituted white kidney beans for the lima beans, and used creamed corn instead of regular frozen corn. I also sauteed the onion, celery and leek in about 1 tbsp of olive oil for 7 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients - released the sweet flavor of each. Also reduced the sage to 1 tsp, and threw in some thyme. Tasted amazing.

Nice, rich flavor, and the finished product looked appetizing. I thought 1½ Tbs of sage was a little much, so I reduced it to 1 tsp, which seemed to work out just fine. I added some grated parmesan cheese on top of each serving, and served it with cornbread.
