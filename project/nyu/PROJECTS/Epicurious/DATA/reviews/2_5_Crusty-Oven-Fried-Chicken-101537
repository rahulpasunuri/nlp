This recipe was actually pretty good... but it's not anything like a real piece of fried chicken. If you're looking for a low fat alternative to the real McCoy, this could be it. I took the cue from some previous reviews and kicked things up a few notches by adding garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and some thyme to the flour/cornmeal mixture. Skipped the lemon zest. Didn't have any buttermilk so i just used 1% milk and some light sour cream for the soaking mixture. Stick to the timing in the recipeor else you'll get dried out chicken. My wife liked it enough to ask that I make it again. The kids were a little less enthusiasticbut they're not worrying about their weight or cholesterol.

I really can't figure out why my husband loves this so much. We had some leftovers so he put it in a tortilla with salad and Caesar dressing the next day and hasn't stopped asking for it ever since. I found it very boring myself.

I much preferred the "Spicy Oven-Fried Chicken" recipe on this site. I would like to try this recipe again on fish instead of chicken.

I've come up with a great name for this recipe: Chicken Cookies. Everything cooked up beautifully but you really don't want a lemon/sweet corn combo where chicken is concerned, right? Kinda gross. Skip the lemon, add some red pepper, and you'll be fine.

Don't make this unless you have a wonderful, tasty sauce to go over it. It is very boring on its own. I followed the recipe and cook time to a T and it was dry and tasteless.

I also left out the lemon zest, and I added a little extra hot pepper sauce. The chicken was nice and crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside. Because it was so easy, this is definitely something I'll be making regularly...

I love this recipe. I've made this dish several times. It's tasty, easy and quick to prepare. I omit the lemon zest. I also substitute skinless chicken legs and thighs for the breasts.

I skipped the lemon zest completely, as it seemed that was better suited to fish. Recipe still turned out well, very juicy and just enough flavor & spice. Husband loved it!

This was pretty good, but didn't match the results of a very similar recipe I have been using for years that uses cornflake crumbs instead of cornmeal. I also use skinned chicken piece that are still on the bone for extra flavor.

Very tasty and the family enjoyed it. Chicken was so moist is actually squirted juices when cut. I did bake it an extra 10 minutes however to ensure it was completely cooked.

The only positive thing I can say about this recipe is the chicken was moist. No one liked it.

It was easy. It was juicy. We just didn't care for it. The flour, corn meal & lemon made me think it was more for fish than chicken. Bet that would be good!

Wonderfully juicy (especially for oven-fried boneless chicken)! I sliced the breasts into "nuggets"; the cooking time was 15 mins (convection bake). I used a cornbread mix (no cornmeal on hand) and it added a nice sweetness to balance the spicy pepper (I added TONS of black pepper to the coating). This dish is great with a creamy potato salad or homemade macaroni & cheese :-)

Made this dish w/ ideas from previous reviews (yogurt instead of buttermilk - vanilla instead of plain for sweeter batter and garlic instead of lemon flavor). Whole family loved the meal (served w/ green beans and new potatoes), but needs ~ 30-35 minutes to cook, not 20 minutes...

Nice change of pace. I liked the flavor, the hint of "heat", texture of the coating, AND the tenderness of the chicken breast. Was also fairly quick to prepare. Served with Scalloped Potatoes and Green Beans. Will definitely make again!

I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk, and it turned out great. I'm surprised to see the negative comments--this is a favorite, and I passed it to my father (who used it with fish instead of chicken and said it was excellent). The squeeze of lemon is a must.

I read the reviews before starting this recipe and made some adjustments accordingly. I crushed a clove of garlic into the buttermilk sauce and was generous with the liquid hot pepper(tabasco). I gave the flour mix 1/2 teaspoon each of cayenne and salt. use a good quality canola oil and be a bit more generous than 1 tablespoon, even coverage is key. tent the chicken with aluminum foil for most of the cooking time to keep it moist, remove foil for last 5 minutes or so to crisp the coating. my husband and I really enjoyed it.

This is a godd "basic" recipie. I myself eat exciting food. I used my own seasoned flour, instead of plain & also left out the lemon. All chicken should be seasoned with garlic powder, oregano, onion powder, salt & a small amount of chile powder.Use a spritzer to spray oil on the bird, it will be more uniform.

This recipe has potential but needs help. I used unsalted matzo meal instead of the cornmeal (a substitution I make frequently), but I don't think that's why the breasts came out pale and chalky. The flavor is quite good but it seems there's not enough fat for the coating to actually fry...instead it just hardens. This recipe might work better with skin-on chicken pieces or with a little oil spritzed onto the coating before baking.

Not what I expected - the children ate it but no one said anything exceptional - I felt it needed salt or something exciting. The kids noticed the spice and did not appreciate it. I did not add this to my online recipe file.

Kind of uninteresting. I prefer a little more flavor to my chicken. I will most likely go back to my old oven fried chicken recipe.

Very simple recipe. The chicken was especially juicy.

It's different from your basic oven fried chicken, but I love baked chicken breast halves. I enjoyed it!
