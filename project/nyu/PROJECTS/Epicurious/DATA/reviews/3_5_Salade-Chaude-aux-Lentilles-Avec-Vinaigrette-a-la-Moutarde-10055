We enjoyed this thoroughly without bacon and with more white wine vinegar. I usually add cherry tomatoes but forgo this time. It really does taste better the next day. Yummy.

Very tasty -- I think the lentils were helped by cooking with the bacon, so I just took some of it out before serving it.

This salad was delicious! Because of the other reviews I read, I sauteed the bacon separately and added it to the lentils at the end (I used italian pancetta) It kept its crispy texture that way. Great accompaniment with fish!

If you have a crowd that digs lentils, this is a really satisfying dish - but fussy eaters won't like it. A good substitute for bacon is, frankly - Bacos - just tie them into a bag of cheesecloth and take them out when the lentils are cooked. And I agree that french green lentils are the best ones to use. Also - it's worth taking the time to cook the carrots separately and add them at the end - the color combination is gorgeous.

This was a very good lentil salad. I would omit the bacon, it became chewy and that's not what texture bacon should be. I would add a bit more mustard.

I love lentils - but this recipe just didn't do anything for me. One thing - when done, the bacon is soft and chewy and fatty. It would have been better had the bacon been cooked in advance.

This is a very satisfying dish for someone who is trying to eat less meat and more legumes. It's even better after a day or two, when the vinegar has really soaked in. The difference in flavor and texture between this dish, made with French lentils, and the dal I made last week using red lentils, is amazing.

This is so easy, quick and impressive. Everyone I know loved it and I've made it many times. It goes really well with grilled fish, delicately flavored meats and even tofu. Sometimes i saute leeks and shallots until wilted finishing with some cream and white pepper, mounding it on top of the lentils. Use the green french lentils if you can find them.
