Delicious with crusty bread and a glass of Riesling. The sunchokes give such a nice, nutty flavor; don't leave them out! Instead of parmesan, we used Gruyere - more authentically Swiss. I cut the recipe in half. Served two for dinner, with two bowls for lunch the next day.

Of the hundreds of recipes I've pulled off epicurious over the years this is my family's #1 favorite! Absolutely amazing layering of flavors. I left out the sunchokes because I couldn't find them locally this time of year but didn't miss it at all.

This was excelllent. I'm not motivated to write reviews, normally. A versatile soup, I used Red Russian Kale and chopped into thin strips. The texture is like noodles when cooked. The thyme and bay leaf was nice.

i love soups and the reviews on this one were so good that i had to try it. it's a fine root vegetable soup but i didn't find it to be exceptional. too much work for such an ordinary result

Exceptional! Easy! Chopping everything is the hardest part. So Madame Cuisinart is your best friend with this surprisingly wonderful recipe.

It may be "just soup" but it may also be the best soup I ever had anywhere. It does require a significant amount of chopping & peeling. As I was preparing it, I thought "this better be good; I'm not doing it again." However... it was fantastic and I'll certainly do it again. I used slightly less of almost everything but it took the entire 2 quarts of stock to cover with about an inch to spare. I also took out most of the rendered bacon fat and oil (left about a Tablespoon). I didn't have any special oil to put on top but did top with the Parmesan which I found was not at all necessary. Very healthy, very hearty, very delicious...a wonderful combination of flavors. I will definitely make it again.

I know it's just soup, but this recipe is terrific. Perfect if you have a winter farmer's market. I've made this 3 times now, and it's my fave recipe of this winter by far. Just some chopping/peeling. Otherwise, it's a breeze. Andrew's recipe seems more centered around the flavor combo, not technique, so I'd encourage you to mix up the veggies a bit...I've added some parsnips, and cut down the potato. The Jerusalem Artichokes (Sunchokes) rock, but will take the longest to cook, so keep those slices thin. Also found deglazing the pan after the bacon/onion is done with a little dry sherry, or a lighter Madeira is terrific. My only quibble is when Andrew mentions Potage, that must be French for 'not a lot of broth.' So if you're like me, have some extra ready in case you'd like to soup it up a bit more. Per Andrew's comment, I had some Pumpkin Seed Oil around to finish the bowl -- It's an inspired suggestion. Please go for it if you have the inclination to buy a bottle. I also tried a bit of smoked sea salt on the finish and really enjoyed that. Wasn't as into the grated cheese, but that's just me. You may love it. Overall, go for it. This is really tasty.
