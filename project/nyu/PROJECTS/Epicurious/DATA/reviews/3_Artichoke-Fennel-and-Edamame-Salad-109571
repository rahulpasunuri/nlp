This is a very good salad, a great do-ahead for company with a unique and fresh mix of flavors. My guests cleaned their plates. I used frozen edamame which worked fine--no need to open all those pods. While I usually subscribe to "fresh is better", I may try roasting canned artichoke hearts, tossed withn olive oil, briefly next time. I could not find the authentic baby artichokes, but I did find some very small purple ones--they were delicious roasted, but awkward in a salad format. We will have this again..it's a lovely and interesting dish.
