I thought this recipe was quite good. Light and just sweet enough. Followed recipe exactly. My guests loved it! I will make it again!

Delicious. Made my own crust.

I like the balance of everything in this basic recipe; it allows me to modify it to my liking. In the most recent version I made, I used honey instead of maple syrup and I added freshly grated ginger root. I also used my own spice blend, which was cinnamon, allspice, cardamom, clove, and fenugreek. I finished it off with a magical drop of oud. Oh snap!

I agree that the maple flavor is a little subtle, even though I used good-quality syrup. I have a maple custard recipe that calls for reducing the syrup before adding to the mixture, and I wonder if that would intensify the flavor here. I also added my own spices, I think the 1.5 tsp of pie spice is a little scant. But otherwise very good, standard pumpkin pie. And standard isn't such a bad thing around Thanksgiving time.

I reduced the amount of brown sugar by half (3 Tbs instead of 6) and used dark brown sugar. I made it for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. The flavors really come through when it's served chilled as opposed to room temperature. The texture and consistency were perfect.

The maple is very subtle and the recipe is very sweet, but I appreciate both of the above! My mistake was to bake the crust as the recipe says: I used a thawed Trader Joe's crust and baking it before adding the filling made the crust crunchy. I guess to each his/her own, I think next time I'll skip the baking of the crust.

This is good... if you like pumpkin also check out this funny website www.ilovepumpkins.com it gave me lots of good ideas. They do a lot of ratings. I prefer the semifreddo by the way - that is a great pumpkin recipe although this one's OK too.

Not bad at all. I usually make the Spirited Pumpkin Pie but thought I'd try it. My husband and son really really enjoyed this pie. I don't believe I changed anything except added spices separately (mace, allspice,ginger yada yada)

Simple and wonderful, though I'm not a fan of frozenpie crust, so chose to use my own. It can make all the difference, but then again, there are so many wonderful pre-made crusts out there, I'm sure you can find a good one with a few tries.

I've made this 2x now! I love it. I bought some good syrup at the store but I wouldn't say it's the best, and it still came out good. I also used real pumpkin (not from a can!). I will definitely be using this recipe as my pumpkin pie recipe for a while!

Love the pumpkin and maple combination. I used grade B maple syrup, and a prepared graham cracker crust, and the entire prep. time was under 10 minutes. A keeper!

This is a wonderful pumpkin pie recipe; however, next time I will use more maple syrup. My husband loved it!

I love pumpkin pies and this was one of the best I have tasted - the texture was extremely smooth. This pie disappeared immediately at my Thanksgiving dinner.

I'm not too much a fan of pumpkin pie, but this recipe is great. I made it for a thanksgiving party, and it was a big . I added a bit of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream and hmm... Yummy!!I will definitely make it again.

This is the BEST pumpkin receipe that I have ever made--and I don't really like pumpkin pie! I added 1/2 tsp of maple extract to enhance the maple flavor and whipping cream instead of half and half. The flaky crust recipe in epicurious complimented this pie immensely.

This was a good recipe for a JUST STARTING OUT cook, I'm sure a 9 year old could make it!

A fine, typical pumpkin pie.

i really like this recipe, and i have made it several times since it's publication. my family is really fond of maple syrup, so each time i've adjusted the amount of the maple syrup, without much success. this last time i used "grade b" maple syrup (in the amount that the original recipe calls for),which has a very strong maple flavour that stands up to baking. what a difference!

I made this for Canadian Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I would bake it less next time as it got really brown and almost burned, although it was still tasty.

Easy for an amateur pie maker, and consistent result.

I really enjoyed making this version of pumpkin pie and found that it baked very nicely. It had a subtle maple taste and I received a lot of compliments on that.

This was really great and dead-easy. People in my family who don't like pumpkin pie liked it. One of the recipies I was sorting through suggested mixing the ingrediants in a food processor to make the mixture lighter tasting. Anywhere that said "whisk" in this recipe, I processed instead. the results were great, although I don't know if it made any difference.

I thought this was good -- nice and smooth -- but not great. I'm still looking for that pumpkin pie recipe with a little something extra.

The BEST pumpkin pie recipe! Those that don't enjoy pumpkin pie (me included) will love this!
