I made it to the recipe with blueberries and loved it. It is nicely spiced and a great dessert for a winter dinner.

Because of the bad reviews, I followed another Chicago cook's advice and made the Blueberry Grunt recipe contained in the Feb 1998 issue that is not in the archives. It was quite normal and edible, unlike this one seems to be. So I recommend you try that. Unfortunately, by definition, it wouldn't be a grunt, but a buckle as the batter is poured atop the berries and baked. A grunt has to be steamed on the stovetop.

Disgusting. I made it exactly as the recipe specified. No one in my family would eat it, including my dog, due to the overwhelming taste of cloves.

Made exactly as recipe specified. Flavor of cloves overwhelmed blueberries. Dumplings were tender. No one in my family would eat the grunt because it tasted like pure cloves. I would never make again.

I thought this was just dreadful. Agree with others about not needing to simmer the berries as long as advised. The cloves overpowered the taste of the berries and the dumplings were gluey.

I'm surprised by the reviews here. I've made this several times and it is a hit, even with my 17 & 19 year olds that aren't berry lovers. It's never dried out on me but I use high quality cookware & am lucky to have a terrific cooktop. It's a great follow up to anything on the barbecue & the tri-color slaw. I wouldn't argue with adding more liquid, it would cut down the tart & put more moisture into the dumplings. I'm not the biggest blueberry fan, but this grunt has me hooked!

I gave this 3 forks because it has a lot of potential, but the recipe as written was not a crowd pleaser. It simply got so reduced and concentrated that it was almost impossible to eat. The molasses and spices makes a pleasing, early-American-cooking flavor to this but the reviews calling for more liquid, etc. are spot on. Here is what I would highly recommend doing (WITHOUT even trying the recipe as written first!): *Increase the amount of Liquid: if your stove cooks hot or your pan is thin and shallow, go up to twice even. Start with 1/2 cup more liquid. *Cover pan with a lid after simmering for 10 or 15 minutes. The dumplings will cook nicely with a lid on, you will conserve precious moisture plus reduce cooking time. * Reduce Molasses to 1 or 2 TBS to start, see how you like it and adjust next time you make it. *No need to pre-simmer berries before adding dumpling dough, let them just start to bubble, then plop in the dough and turn heat down to keep at a gentle simmer. When I made this, I automatically reduced the molasses to sugar ratio but did not increase liquid and did not pre-simmer. I used a 10" simmer pan, cooked it for about 30 minutes, the last 10 of which had a lid--because I was going to lose all the fruit before the dumplings got cooked if I did't put a lid on. Cooked it on low for 85% of cook time. Like I said, this could be REALLY good, and I will be making it again, using my own suggestions, because the potential was so high. I just think the recipe is inherently flawed and other reviews you can read here say the same thing.

I was looking forward to making this dessert, but was very disappointed. Although I followed the directions, the blueberries cooked up to nothing by the time the dumplings were cooked through. For those who attempt this recipe, you do not need to simmer the blueberries for the amount of time stated. Unfortunately it was a waste of good bluberries.

This was a fun dessert, so easy to make on the stovetop, and I was impressed at how good the cake tasted considering it was just dropped in like that. However, with all the delicious desserts out there, this one seems pretty average. The spice in the blueberry was really nice and could be used for crisps and pies as well. I think you must serve this grunt with ice cream!

A bit disappointing. Bottom berry layer was too dry by the time the dumplings were done. Not a pretty presentation in the end, either. I will stick with the blueberry grunt recipe featured in Feb. 1998. It is not in the "Epicurious archives", but if you still have your old BonAppetit copy, it's worth a look!

Great with wild blueberries! Only let blueberry mixture simmer for 10 mins. as the dumplings absorb a lot of the fluid in the final simmer stage.

The dumplings were excellent, but the filling was a bit too sweet and the mollasses seemed to muddle the freshness of the blueberries. I'd recommend reducing the amount of sugar if you have sweet berries.

This is a perfect quick summer dessert. I loved the addition of cloves and nutmeg.

In all fairness, I only had 1/2 the fruit needed and I didn't read carefully enough and used blackstrap molasses. Interesting flavour. Not bad, very surprising. Will make this again with correct proportions and ingredients.

This was probably the best blueberry dessert I've ever had. Don't change anything, just make this as soon as you can.
