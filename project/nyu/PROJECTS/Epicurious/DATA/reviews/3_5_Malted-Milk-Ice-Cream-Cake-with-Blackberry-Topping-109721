While I didn't make the actual ice cream, I used the recipe to make the cake it recommended, and I made it twice to have two different cake layers. The cake worked very well for the ice cream cake I made. It wasn't too sweet or soft, just the right size and texture for an ice cream cake!

Perfect! Tried this recipe in preparation for my son's birthday--great twist on just regular old cake. Based on reviews, I cut both the brown and white sugar to 1/2 c each. That seemed to be just the right amount for us. The blackberry topping makes the taste of this cake more sophisticated as well as stunningly beautiful. FYI: I didn't have to "shave" the cake layer at all since it measured out to 1/2 inch after baking.

So amazingly delicious, while it was rather time consuming, I already own my own ice cream maker so it wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be. The ice cream was rather sweet, but the end result was so delicious, it all balanced out. I made this for my mother for her birthday last week and it was so popular, my neighbor is paying me to make it for them.

This was fantastic.My guests all loved it. I do not have an ice cream maker (not about to buy one). I bought French Vanilla ice cream, then softened it slightly, added the malted milk powder and bourbon. Then continued the recipe from there. I will certainly make this again for special occasions.

This cake was very delicious, however very time consuming. I started at about 5 one day, finished the actual baking at 9, but wasn't done letting it sit until the next day. But all in all a very delicious and impressive cake!

Cake batter was really thick and sweet (i used homemade vanilla, not malted milk) so I added 1 Tbsp of lemon zest and 1/4 c lemon juice to batter. It all came together beautfully and so delicious! Topped with lemon frosting (just a few squirts for decoration, not whole thing, it's already a sugar bomb!) and blackberries for stylish presentation.

I served this today to a diverse group of people. All liked it. If you are to make this, please make the blackberry topping. It is the combination of the sweet ice cream and the slight tartness of the blackberries which make this a very flavor-filled dish.

I only made the ice cream and it was ridiculously sweet! I made it for a friend whose favorite ice cream is malted milk ball but I don't think I'll ever make it again. If I do or if you do, cut down on the sugar! I'm thinking it might taste different and less sweet with the blackberry topping but still, beware!

I liked this cake. I doubled the cake recipe and cut in half so I had 2 cake layers and 2 ice cream layers. The sauce was wonderful. I also added homemade whip cream, which was probably over the top since I was entertaining that night, but it was deliciouse. Everyone came back for more! I will make this again because it's really simple.
