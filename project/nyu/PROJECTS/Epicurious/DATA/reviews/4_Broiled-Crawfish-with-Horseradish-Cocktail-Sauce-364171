Excellent! Used shrimp instead of crawfish. My nephews sure enjoyed them.

Mouth-watering recipe! Dish makes really different if you put some cocktails on it! I love mixing cocktails with our dishes where I found at http://www.zcocktails.com I'm sure you will love this site!

The flavors in the crawfish boil were very tasty. I used Old Bay Seasoning in place of Zatarian's. The sauce went perfectly and we paired the crawfish with an Owen Roe Reisling. The only change I recommend is the portion size. Four pounds of crawfish for 10 servings is an APPETIZER sized serving, not a main course serving. I reccomend 1-2 lbs. per person for a main course serving.
