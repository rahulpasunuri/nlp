Finally I made this recipe! I would give it 3.5 stars, if I could. I made it with the mango and pineapple, but substituted (local) peaches for the papaya. It is delicious and refeshing on a hot day - and fun for a group to make with all the last minute shaved ice. One thing - make sure you make and eat this outside, while sitting in the shade, on a hot, hot, hot day. it doesn't taste the same if eaten in a climate controlled environment.

Saw this recipe while looking through a search on papaya and had to comment. I believe this is an adaptation of a Filipino dessert called "Halo-Halo" which I was told litterly means mix-mix. What a delicious concoction to enjoy on a hot day, which they alway seem to be in Manila. The only thing missing in this recipe is a big scoop of Ube ice cream. (Ube is a purple root that makes a tasty ice cream, but strawberry will do in a pinch) Then all you do is mix-mix and enjoy...Heaven!

I live 2 blocks away from Uwajimaya in Seattle, where shaved ice with fruit (they call it slush ice in the International District here) is everywhere. The rage here is also tea and fruit drinks with pearl tapioca. If you are thinking about making this, but aren't sure--treat yourself! The tapioca is fabulous. Here they make 1/2 tea, 1/2 milk, blended with tapioca cooked with brown sugar in the bottom, to chew as you go. Fabulous!
