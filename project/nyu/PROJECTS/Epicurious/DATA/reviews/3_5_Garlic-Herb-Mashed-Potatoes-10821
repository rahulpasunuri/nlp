So yummy and easy! My kids (3 & 5) are not big on Mashed Potatoes (I know my kids are weird!), but even they ate their given portion without much fuss. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed them and I'll definitely be making these again!

Quadrupled the recipe and made ahead for Christmas dinner. It reheated beautifully in the microwave and everyone raved about them.

I used just half of the potatoes but all of the Boursin. It was enough for two of us. Lovely with a steak, try it.

I doubled the recipe and used 150 gm package of Boursin cheese. I did not peel all of my potatoes, so they were more smashed than mashed. I also added a few cloves of garlic to the cooking water and mashed those into the poatoes as suggested by another poster. This is a very easy recipe and a rich one.

add some extra whole garlic cloves when boiling the potatoes for some extra creamy garlic flavor. they will mash in with the potatoes beautifully. so good!

Excellent. I 'held' the potatoes in a covered pot for about 1/2 hour after draining & before mashing. I heated the milk and then mixed it in w/the potatoes & cheese on low heat. Turned out great!! Yum!

These potatoes are absolutely wonderful!!! Creamy and flavorful are just a few words to describe the taste. Not to mention how easy and quick to prepare. I used a full 4 ounce container of the Boursin "light" soft cheese... all the flavor, minus the excess fat. They are definitely a keeper!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year, and my 15 guests raved about its flavor. I added fresh parsley and left the potatoes unpeeled. It was a hit!!

I made this last night...it was absolute heaven. I actually doubled the recipe (2 lbs. of potatoes), however, I discovered that 1 Boursin was plenty and the 1/3 c. of milk was also fine with the extra potatoes. I added salt and lots of black pepper...everyone raved about these potatoes. My fiance and I kept sneaking bites while we were waiting for the rest of our dinner to finish!

This was a great tasting and fast recipe. I loved this with my pot roast. Per recommendations from the other reviewers, I also added the full package of cheese and it tasted wonderful. Would definitely make this again.

I've made this several times, and it's easy and delicious. I upped the Boursin amount (just threw in the whole package), which resulted in creamier, more flavorful potatoes.

A simple but elegant addition to any menu. I added almost twice as much cheese as the recipe called for as well as some fresh chives, salt and freshly ground pepper.

Agree with the others. Had it with grilled standing rib roast and porcini mushroom sauce. My husband mixed in some horseradish at the table and loved it.

Very good and super easy. I tried this once with low fat Alloutte (sp?) and did not enjoy it as much as I did when I made this with Boursin.

Used Alouette cheese as suggested by one reviewer. Very good. Guests raved about it. They couldn't believe how easy it was to prepare.

I have made this so many times now I have perfecte this one. Leave the cheese out to soften a bit before dumping it into the hot potatoes. I use a potato ricer and cream instead of milk. They are light fluffy and VERY tasty.

This recipe is so easy (no roasting garlic, sauteing shallots, or chopping herbs) and so delicious. It works well with prime rib and filet mignon, and because it is so easy, you can spend more time on a sauce for the meat. I make the potatoes with Aloutte reduced fat cheese and 1% milk
