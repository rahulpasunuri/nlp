I skipped making this crust do to all the "tough" comments. I also followed the advice of using 1/2 cup brown sugar, scant 1/4 cup of white (and people thought it was maybe a tad too sweet), 3/4tsp of cinnamon, 1/8 of cardamom and 1/8 of powdered ginger. People were crazy about the pie, which was still warm from baking an hour and a half before. I would make this again, but opt for just 1/2 cup of brown sugar and then offer up some ice cream when serving.

This was a very, very good pie. I used a store-bought crust. I'll make just about anything from scratch, but if there's one thing I hate to make, it's a pie crust. Otherwise I followed the recipe for the filling except I used nectarines instead of peaches because that's what was available here, and I also took other reviewers' advice and minimized the cardamom. I then multiplied the filling by one-and-a-half and made a 10-inch deep-dish pie instead of a 9-inch. The pie came out great, and the filling was indeed delicious. My only complaint is that it took about an hour just to blanch, peel, and slice the 16 nectarines that it needed!

My partner called this "exquisite" and ate four slices. I chopped the peaches a little smaller than called for and added a teaspoon of ground ginger. I wasn't in love with the crust but overall, very good summer pie.

Update to review of 7/08 I used 1/8 of cardamon and 3/4 cinnamon. The peach filling is incredibly good. The crust is not good. I didn't overwork it, but it was tough. I will use my own crust next time.

This pie rocks! I made a few minor adjustments which worked out really well. First, I used 1/4 C. tapioca instead of flour and the consistency was perfect. I also took the suggestions of previous reviews and did 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar. Also, 1/8 t. cardamom plus 1/8 t. nutmeg and 1/2 t. vanilla. I made two of these pies for a 4th of July party and recieved tons of compliments. This pie has a really nice flavor because the spices compliment the peaches perfectly.

This was delicious! We had a bunch of ripe summer peaches and the fruits really made the pie. I didn't have any cardamon, so I used a little more cinnamon e a dash of nutmeg. Will make it again.

Great Pie, a classic done well!!

This is a good easy summer pie. I reduced the cardamon by half after reading some reviews that it over-powered the peaches and I upped the cinnamon just a tad. The filling was perfect actually: flavorful, not too sweet, the peaches came through and the consistency was terrific. The crust, well this was another story.In all fairness, I think I over-worked it a bit; however it wass not flaky and was a bit tough. It did however roll out so easily that I will try this crust again.

I make numerous peach pies during the summer and even assemble and freeze unbaked a couple pies for the winter months. I never put cardamon with peaches, as it overpowers the delicate peach flavor. Usually I use my own pie crust recipe, but decided to give this one a try. The dough goes together and rolls out nicely, but I didn't find it as flaky as my regular. Maybe that was because I had only the trans fat free version of Crisco on hand.

i am a huge fan of peach pie because I LOVE the flavor of peaches. I am also a big fan of spices (have a cupboard full of the makings for various curries and sauces). I thought the two would marry well but I felt that these spices overwhelmed the delicate lusciousness of the peaches. delicious all the same, but not a good showcase for excellent summer peaches.

I have made this pie many times and it's always a hit. I must admit I didn't use lard, only butter and it came out great. Also didn't have the cardomom, still great. Can't wait for ripe peaches again!

This is the best peach pie I've ever had. I am always nervous about making pie crust but this came together easily and was delicious. As a matter of fact this will be the only pie crust recipe I'll ever use again. Can't wait to try the crust in a blueberry pie! You won't be disappointed, give this pie a try.

I'm a pastry chef who had never made a pie crust with lard before. I happened to have some lard at work one day and decided I should see what all the fuss is about, and I used this recipe. OH MAN. It was as crispy and flakey as a ritz cracker. It definitely has a slight pork flavor, but the butter in this recipe helps mellow that. I can't imagine ever just happening to have lard again, but if I ever do, I'm making another pie! I did not use this filling recipe.

I didn't use the crust recipe, but the filling was great. The consistency was perfect - not runny at all. (I used ripe peaches.) The addition of cardomom was unusual but very good.

Forgot to mention in my review below - I subbed cornstarch for flour as the thickening agent.

I'd say three forks, but the crowd I made it for would likely give it four (it disappeared from the pot luck table in about 10 minutes). To note: I did not use the crust recipe, but my tried and true pastry recipe from Regan Daley's book, "In the Sweet Kitchen". I also made the following small changes to the filling: I used half brown sugar, and half white; I added about 1/8 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg; I added one tbsp of brandy (which goes well with both peaches and brown sugar); I added about an extra tsp of cornstarch. This is a *big* pie - I used 4 lbs peaches, and the filling was too much for the standard 9" pie plate. I would use a deep dish to be safe next time, or else use a bit less fruit. I also didn't bother to blanch the peaches before peeling them. The pie was nice and juicy, but not runny. A winner.

This is my absolute favorite peach pie recipe. The crust is tender and tasty and the filling has a great flavor. The filling is a bit runny if eaten out of the oven, but the pie gels after cooling in the fridge. I make this pie a couple of times every year - to rave reviews!

The taste of the pie was great! I received a lot of compliments, but the filling ran all over the place. I had really ripe peaches and they created a lot of juice. I added the seeds from a vanilla bean, and next time I'll try to use cornstarch instead of flour to gell the filling more and perhaps a little spiced rum. The crust was good, but nothing to write home about.

The cardomom is perfect with the peaches, excellent flavour. I think a dash of brandy would also be good in the filling.

My pie crusts have turned out so tough in the past that I had almost given up on making pie, but this recipe is a WINNER. I have made it three times and each time, the crust has turned out beautiful and flaky. I used European-style butter last time, which added more delicious flavor and texture. The last two times I made it, I did it by hand. I cut the butter into very small pieces before adding it to the flour mixture and then I mixed it until it was just starting to get smooth. When I rolled it out, there were pretty large balls of butter rolling out, too, and I was not sure about that, but the crust turned out so incredible that I made the next crust the exact same way. I didn't have a problem with the filling being runny-- it was deelish, too. I did not use cardamom any of the times I made it, as I don't ever have it on hand, and I thought it still tasted great.

One thing to consider is the type of peach and the season... That can be why some people are getting so much more liqued then others... The same type of peach in different parts of the country and different times of the season can result in differt amounts of natural juice...

Loved the pie crust - so easy and handled better than other pastries I've made. Next time I would increase the cinnamon and add some vanilla. Aluminum foil under the pie is always a good idea - my pies always run over!

The pie was exellent. Loved the crust. However, the pie is on the juicy side. I found that lining the bottom of the oven with heavy duty foil helped with cleanup. Serve pie with a dollop of good vanilla ice cream. Happy Eating!

I was disappointed. I used 4lb of peaches, weighed them and everything, and there was just way too much juice. The pie was oozing liquid before I even got it into the oven, and of course the whole time it baked. The crust was fine, but not what one usually thinks of as pie pastry- not flaky at all, tender but almost bready. There was a much better peach pie recipe in Bon Appetit, in the Aug. 1996 issue (pg. 79) that isn't on this web site. It calls for even more peaches (4 1/4 lb.!) but they don't sit as long, exuding liquid before baking. That recipe is worth finding.

this is a wonderful recipe! it's the only one i use anymore. it's very easy to make the crust. often, i add extra spices and a vanilla bean

I really liked this recipe. So easy, and it tastes great. Plus, I think the crust was especially tasty. The only addition I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract to the peach pie filling. What a treat! A pie I've added to my collection.

Not too crazy about this pie. Too much cardamon and very runny, I added tapioca to the recipe but it didn't help. The flavor and consistency improved by the next day.

pretty and tasty! what a combo, I found the crust to be excellent, not at all tough, I made it by hand as I do not own a food processor, maybe that is the difference, any pie crust will get tough if over worked and I think it would be easy to over work it in the processor as I rely on touch to know when things are right. I liked the filling, not at all runny.

This was the first pie I'd ever baked. It was simple, easy and delicious. My family still requests "my famous peach pie." I would definitly make it again.

I've never made a pie before and this one was pretty easy to make! The filling was absolutely delicious. I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the peach mixture and it was the perfect consistency. Keep a close eye on the over-hanging crust part and definitely cover it with foil or it will get dry and hard! Otherwise, its a great pie. Mine was devoured by my co-workers in about 15 minutes.

This pie has wonderful flavor the hint of cardamom is just right and sets it apart from the average peach pie. If I make it again I will add a bit of tapioca to tighten up the filling. I loved the crust it was flaky and a bit tangy, easy to roll and looked beautiful.

I HAVE NEVER MADE A PIE BEFORE...THIS RECIPE WAS VERY EASY FOR MY FIRST TIME. NOT TO MENTION DELICIOUS. THE SPICES WERE WONDERFUL. SINCE PEACHES ARE NOT IN SEASON RIGHT NOW I USED CANNED PEACHES WHICH WORKED FINE. I'M THINKING OF MAKING THIS FOR THANKSGIVING.

This was a wonderful recipe, and so easy! The spices really put it above and beyond other Peach Pies. The crust was very easy to make as long as you were using a food processor, although I've had flakier crusts, the buttermilk was anice compliment. It won rave reviews from family and friends.

I really liked this recipe, because it turned out one of the most beautiful pies I had ever made. The next week I couldn't find the magazine (forgot about the website), and made a recipe from another magazine. The pie was terribly ugly, but the crust was much flakier. I think this is a great pie to make if you are looking for presentation and good (not great) flavor. Good for the first-time pie baker.

This pie looked beautiful, but it was too runny. In addition, the crust was not flaky. It actually came out tough. It surprised me that a pie could look that great, but not be good.

It worked! As a first-time pie maker, I was shocked that the pie I made looked so much like the picture. It tasted fabulous too. One tip: chill the dough as long as possible. Mine was still too flimsy to work with after only an hour of chilling.

Being new to the mysterious art of pie making, this recipe was delightfully simple and surprisingly successful. This pie is best eaten warm, since the spiced, baked peaches are a soothing treat. Thank you for the excellent cooking class in your last issue!
