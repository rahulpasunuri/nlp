Maybe others didn't use high quality chocolate and that's why they were disappointed. My torte turned out very chocolatey and light and delicious. I will definitely make this recipe again and send the link to my gluten free friends. I loved it!

It was alright. Not hard to make. Smells incredible when baking, but with all the other fabulous dishes out there to wow your guests with, this one was just not worth doing again.

Loved this ending to a Mexican-themed meal. Be careful not to overbake it, or it will be dry. If you decide not to use the glaze, slightly sweetened whipped cream with a bit of cinnamon is a good accompaniment.

Definitely delicious. A rich chocolate cinnamon affair with a good nutty texture to the cake. Don't bother trying to whisk the egg whites in; use a rubber spatula to work the first third of the whites in thoroughly, then gently fold in the rest of the whites. Check at 30 minutes; mine was done when first checked at 35 min. I skipped the icing and served this torte with a dollop of whipped cream and slices of fresh mango. Yummy!

This is one of the most delicious and impressive and easy dishes I have ever made. We had a Mexican themed party and this was a perfectly light ending to a heavy meal of Mexican dishes. It was also my first time using a springform pan, which until this recipe sat in the back of my kitchen cabinet. I now keep my springform handy just for this heavenly dessert!

This was very disappointing. For all its great ingredients, it really wasn't up to par. I thought this torte would have a very rich deep chocolatey taste, but it wasn't even close. The only deep chocolatey part was probably the glaze, which I didn't even bother to make. I don't like tortes or cakes that depend on the glaze or frosting to give them the intensity, depth and flavor they should have on their own. There are much better, richer, deeper, more luscious chocolate tortes and cakes around. Try the Mexican Chocolate Icebox Cake on this website - It's outstanding!

This cake turned out beautiful and delicious. The glaze recipe is superb, though I thought the cake was a little dry. For a melt-in-your-mouth cake recipe, try the Double Chocolate Torte on this site.

I don't know what happened, but the chocolate-egg-almond mixture was SO thick that it couldn't be whisked into the meringue. Instead, I beat it in and the torte was flat and dry.

When you eat this cake, you will think you died and went to heaven! This cake has an INTENSE chocolate flavor--it is very rich, but not at all dense--a very light cake. I didn't do the frosting at all. Instead, I sifted powdered sugar over the top of the cake and, since our raspberries were in abundance, I encircle the edge of the cake with raspberries. Everyone at our dinner party raved over this cake and, to my dismay, there were no leftovers!

This tort is soooo easy to make and is fabulous. My dinner guest enjoyed it, even the non-dessert eaters were completely captivated by this recipe. I let the glaze cool and frosted the tort instead of pouring the warm glaze over the tort. Next time I'll make chocolate leaves and top the tort w/ them. Yummy!!!!

Interesting texture. Everyone who said they should't eat chocolate had 2 pieces of this heavenly torte. Easy to prepare. I use Saigon cinnamon, it makes a difference when cinnamon is a key ingredient.

I made this cake for a"Margarita Night"(every friday at my neighbors). Everyone loved it. When i tried to make the icing for decorating, it did not turn out right. So I didnt bother. I decorated instead with Cinnamon sticks and fresh mint leaves. It was simple and elegant.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo, for the folks in my office. It was a hit! Very nice cinnamon and chocolate flavor. I added about 1/4 tsp. of orange extract to my batter, and that perked up the other flavors a bit, I think. I just used a small tube of supermarket-variety white decorator icing to finish off the cake (after it was glazed). Easier than making up your own, proper-consistency decorator frosting.
