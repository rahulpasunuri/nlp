This was so easy and so wonderful! I don't think I will ever attempt another chocolate souffle recipe again since this once is perfect. The caramel sauce adds the perfect decadence to this dessert.

Anyone who didn't like this either can't cook or used cheap chocolate. Very easy to make and can be made the day before or that morning and then baked following dinner. Plenty of caramel sauce which can be used over ice cream for several days. Impresses people who think souffles are difficult.

I found these souffles underwhelming. They simply aren't chocolatey enough or rich enough. The caramel sauce doesn't have anything to stand up to. I thought they tasted like a fluffy, mildly flavored brownie.

We found the souffles a little too bitter for our tastes. Perhaps it would have helped if we served it with the caramel sauce or vanilla ice-cream. The next time I try this recipe, I would use a combination of semi-sweet and bitter-sweet choc as the bitter taste was overwhelming.

Everyone is impressed when you can make a souffle. It's not hard, just time consuming. Very rich and delicious - and of course, heavy and filling. It's worth making the creamy caramel sauce, but I am curious to what other sauces would go well with this. I imagine times will vary from oven to oven. Mine could go a minute or two over the recommended time here.

A dessert this good that can be made ahead is a killer find. Had one left over, and gave it to my boyfriend to bake and eat later; he was so crazy for it that he didn't bother to bake it, and ate it raw! (He said it was still delicious). Lovely served with a sprinkling of powdered sugar on top, the caramel sauce, a few strawberries on the side, and a scoop of the ginger-brown sugar ice cream from this site.

Love everything about this recipe. Love that you can make it a day ahead (and people are always "wowed" by souffle". Love that it is super easy. And I use the caramel sauce for everything.

I would give this five forks!! I made the souffles and sauce a day in advance. Everyone RAVED about them at our Christmas dinner!!

What a great recipe -- both the souffles and caramel sauce were easy to make and delicious. Made it for New Years' Eve dinner -- a perfect start to the new year. Great for dinner parties since it can be made in advance. Can't wait to use the sauce on other desserts.

I've made this in the past to great success. Recently, I made it all in one six cup souffle dish and it was not enough batter to rise far above the height of the dish, so I would stick with the individual servings. I froze it a few hours before baking and that did not harm it, even as a large souffle.

Tasty, chocolately decadence without overwhelming effort! I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to pull off this recipe, including the caramel sauce. I too, would recommend making everything ahead of time. The souffles refrigerate beatifully and don't seem to be affected by being made early and baked later.

This recipe is a winner. Delicious, elegant, and not too complicated. And, I made them the day before and refrigerated them, so all I had to do was pop them in the oven the day I was serving them. The caramel is delicious, and really enhanced the chocolate flavor. I'd definitely recommend making the camamel--it came together easily.

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make. I've made this dish twice and added more chocolate to the second making (9.7 oz Scharfenberger bittersweet bar) and it was even better (for those chocolate lovers). My carmel sauce bombed the first time so I did not attempt the second time. I served it with a raspberry sauce and whipped cream. Just heavenly!

This souffle is fool-proof. Actually it is not hard to make it after dinner while "others" are cleaning up :) To make it even easier skip the caramel sauce. I prefer, and do countless others, to serve the souffles at the table, ask the guests/family to cut a 2" slit across the top of the souffle and then put a medium scoop of premium vanilla ice cream into the top. The ice cream added to the hot souffle is incredible!

I have to admit that the first time I made it only one of the 6 stayed up.

This souffle recipe is the most foolproof I've ever used. The "Creamy Caramel Sauce is not only delicious, but very easy to make. I did notice it took longer than I had expected for the sauce to finally come together,but that might have been caused by the weather or some other unknown reason.All in all these recipes are excellant and I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.

This recipe is fabulous, and a bit forgiving ... the first time I made it, I absent-mindedly forgot to add the sugar, and it still turned out great. It was a bit tastier with all ingredients though!!

My daughter forwarded this receipe to me. She made it for friends that LOVE chocolate desserts. It is fabulous! A souffle that you can make ahead of time is a wonderful discovery. I made it twice, once without the carmel sauce. Still terrific. Definitely use the chocolate they recommend.

These souffles were so good - they reminded me a lot of what of chocolate angle food cake would be like if it were served warm. Yum. They looked like too much for one person in the one cup dished, but they are really quite light and it wasn't hard to finish them. I made the carmel sauce, which turned out very well, but I couldn't tell what it did for the souffle - if anything it made it a bit creamier tasting. Very good with or without!

Very nice and easy! Can make ahead up to one day and bake off before serving. I served this with chocolate sauce as well as the caramel sauce. Also like it with a Java chip ice cream or Vanilla Bean. Very caloric and worth every last calorie!

I wish I would have had this recipe when I was in culinary school.. I would have passed my test!! This is great for dinner parties when you want to make as much as you can ahead of time. I do find that I have to cook them an extra 5 minutes or so.

I love this recipe and make it all the time. I like to serve it with strawberry whip cream during the summer, it makes it lighter. Absotutely fantastice!

This is an easy yet elegant dessert! You can make the souffles ahead, refrigerate them and stick them in the oven for 20 minutes before serving. I've made them several times always with great results - they rise beautifully and the caramel sauce is a perfect accompaniment. I highly recommend this for chocolate lovers!

I've made this time and again. It's always wonderful, and very easy! I always make the base ahead, and beat the egg whites just before cooking. You have to rewarm the base slightly to ensure even mixing, but I think it works better than making the entire recipe ahead.

We made this in 8 4 oz ramekins, and more really isn't necessary! This is the ultimate expression of chocolate -- why it was put on earth, how it was meant to be eaten. Am I exaggerating? Make it and see for yourself.

This is a wonderful "do-ahead" recipe which is simple to prepare, yet very elegant. Perfect for a dinner party. Your guests are bound to be impressed!
