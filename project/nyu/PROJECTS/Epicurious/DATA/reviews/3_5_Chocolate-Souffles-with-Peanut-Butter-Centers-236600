I expected this to be more of a warm chocolate cake, but it was truly a souffles. I used all peanut butter pastry cream in the cakes, instead of just 1 Tbls, I also cooked for an extra two minutes, and probably could have cooked another two minutes. It was good, but not amazing.

This was good, but the refrigerated, sunken, remaining souffles were outstanding! The recipe made way more peanut butter pastry cream than needed.

very good! made in 4 oz ramekins. Could use a bit longer cook time. Delicious! increase amount of PB in centers.
