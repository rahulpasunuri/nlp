I have made this recipe a few times now with the change of making it more like a true gratin of layering the raw potatoes in a pan with the mushrooms and adding some gruyere cheese. Then I boil equal amounts of cream and chicken stock and pour over the potatoes. Bake at 400 until crispy on top. Delicious. Every one of my customers has given raves when served with the pink and green peppercorn prime rib roast. For dessert... My own Chocolate Cherry Buche de Noel.

As tasty now as it was when I first made it 10 years ago! OK to substitute other quality, dried mushrooms.

I frequently serve this dish for buffets. I have reduced some of the fat content by using a combination of skim milk and reduced fat cream cheese instead of whole milk and heavy cream. Add them to the sauteed mushrooms before the remaining ingredients. Stir them well to be sure the cheese is melted and completely blended with the milk.

I made this dish when it first came out in the magazine years ago (together with the peppercorn crusted prime rib) and it has become one of our absolute favorites! We've had it many Christmases and celebrations and is always requested by those who have had it with us before. The porcini flavor just makes it so rich and wonderful.

I made this for Thanksgiving and we didn't love it. I love porcini but I think the taste was too strong in this dish. Maybe omitting the porcini broth would help.

Very flavorful-be careful not to fill gratin dish to tippy top as it will bubble over. Added 1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper. Would be good with just about any kind of meat.

This was part of our 1999 Xmas dinner and although the porcini are very expensive it was delicious, easy to make and got raves at the dinner table.I covered the dish with foil at the end of the cooking time so it wouldn't get too brown.
