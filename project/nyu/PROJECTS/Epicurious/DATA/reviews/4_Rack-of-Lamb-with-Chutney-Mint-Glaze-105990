Served for Christmas. Easy, and a nice alternative to my usual rack of lamb recipe. Didn't serve the sauce on the side as it would have been too sweet.

I have made this twice and I am making again tonight. Both times it came out absolutely perfect and amazing. I have been an epicurious member for years and this is the first recipe I have rated. It's that good.

This was so good! My husband raved so much that we will definately be doing it again.

I cut the racks up into two-rib pieces and grilled them (with a little sauce toward the end)and in retrospect would grill them whole next time. Either way, the sauce was great and couldn't have been easier. Baking them probably would have made better use of the sauce during cooking.

Won't make rack of lamb any other way- easy and fantastic taste.

Easy, easy, easy- but so flavorful.

Living in the Caribbean, I used locally made chutney that has a touch of hot pepper in it. I marinated the loin chops with garlic salt, pepper and olive oil for an hour or so before grilling and applying the glaze to both sides about 2 minutes before serving. Great and I have sent the recipe out to friends.

Once you try this, you want nothing else. Trust me.

This was by far the best Rack of Lamb I've ever had! I quickly seared the lamb before baking. It was delicious! I can't wait to make it again. This was the first time I've make Rack of Lamb and it was so simple. Loved the Chutney & mint jelly sauce!

We nade this on the BBQ on skewers and served it with wildrice/mushroom rice pilaf side dish (Epicurious.com) We shared a spicy German wine with it. You'be think you were dining at the Chart House in Carmel it was that good. Gewertzraminer I think the wine was. Outstanding combo. Indirect on BBK with apple wood chips for the coals.

First time I made lamb and I could not be happier. My buddy from CO thought it was the best he has ever had!!!

I will skip the extra sauce next time. It's much too sweet, and with the delicious glaze, the lambe doesn't need anything else.

Easy to make since the ingredients (mint & chutney) are usually in the refrigerator. Fed 2 adults with 1-1/2 lb of lamb. Served with baked cauliflower, which made a great addition.

We love lamb and order it out, but this was the first time preparing it ourselves. The glaze was simple and made the dish. Our guests were licking their plates. Served it at Easter with tiny steamed red potatoes, dressed with butter and fresh parley, steamed fresh baby carrots and sweetpeas in pods. The leftovers were great reheated, can't wait to make it again. Will try it with couscous next time.

Deceptively simple but absolutely delicious! I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was an absolute hit! I plan on using it again for Easter. I have also used the sauce with lamb chops instead of a rack.

Excellent and would not change a thing.
