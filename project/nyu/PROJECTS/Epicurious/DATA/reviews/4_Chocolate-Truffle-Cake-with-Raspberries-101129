In a word.....YUMM!! My son asked for a raspberry chocolate cake for his birthday, so I chose this. I am not a baker and it turned out great. I didn't have access to Lindt, so used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips and don't plan on using anything else. I baked the cake for only 30 minutes and it was perfect, left the cake whole and did spread a thin layer of raspberry jam before spreading the ganache and fresh raspberries. My girlfriend saw the cake and is already requesting it next month for her birthday!

Took this to a party last night and it was a major crowd pleaser. The ganache totally made it. I provided a link here for party members and wanted to share my very minor changes. If possible, I would actually rate the cake 3.5 forks. While it looked beautiful, I think the fabulous ganache compensated for an okay cake. Next time,I might try making this ganache with a flourless cake. That said, everyone at the party loved the cake so maybe it's just me. My little tweaks were: I skipped adding liqueur. I left the cake whole. I put some raspberries on the top before the ganache set. I baked the cake around 35 minutes b/c of reviews I read here. p.s. Another plus is this is an easy "make the same day" recipe. I only chose it b/c I had Lindt in the house and my go-to recipes all require many hours of refrigeration.

Made it for my son's birthday who is an athlete and doesn't eat sweets. He raved over the taste, texture and presentation. Very colorful cake with the ganache and raspberries. I will make again. Expensive to make, but worth it!

This is a dense, chocolate lovers paradise. My two favorite desserts are chocolate and raspberries, so this was definitely a hit. I actually increased the cake by 1-1/2 and baked it in an 8" cake pan. After cooling, I cut in half and spread with a Raspberry and Chambord sauce, covered with a pint of raspberries and then added ganache. Put the 2nd layer on top and covered with remaining ganache and garnished with another pint of raspberries. Served with heated raspberry sauce under each slice. Divine.

Yes, if you like CHOCOLATE and more CHOCOLATE, this is the dessert for you. Very very rich. Way too many steps, but make it more than once and it's easier...very delicious.

I made this cake for the first time for my mother in laws birthday party, and got rave reviews from the whole family. I took everyones advice and checked it at 30 minutes, and it was perfect at 35. We used generic bakers chocolate ("chocolate de taza") since that was all we could find here in Argentina. We also used strawberries instead of raspberries - I put a layer of homemade strawberry jam in the middle before I poured on the ganache, substitued strawberry liquer for the grand marnier, and piled fresh strawberriws on top, and it turned out really nice. I would very highly reccomend this recipe for a birthday cake, since its pretty easy to make with very imprewssive results.

I've made this cake three times and it gets rave reviews everytime. The only thing I do differently is that I make an additional half recipe of cake batter and then pour the batter into two nine inch cake pans. There is enough ganache if you make the cake this way. I put ganache and raspberries between the two layers of cake and then I pour ganache over the stacked two layer cake and garnish with raspberries. It's beautiful and delicious.

I've made this cake for several of my friends on special occasions, and I've had more than a couple offers of marriage come of it! A surefire aphrodisiac, enhanced by the intense flavor of that espresso-spiked ganache. I agree that the baking time should be cut down--no more than 30 min. at the temp. specified. I'd love to get my hands on the recipe for Valentino's blood orange sauce.

I selected this dessert for our annual New Year's dinner party, as one of my guests requested something other than a cheesecake. Following the recipe exactly, except for keeping the cake intact as a whole until serving time, I found the cake itself on the dry side after 45 minutes at 350. I should have checked it sooner. The ganache was superb, once I dumped the first batch which failed to emulsify and took more care with the second. Considering the cost of Valrhona chocolate and 3 1/2 pints of rasperries, I expected more stupendous results -- a fudgier texture to the cake. If I ever try this again, will use a 9" pan for a taller cake layer, and check on the doneness sooner.

Wow!!! This is great. I don't particularly like chocolate cake (to the great dismay of my family), and even I enjoyed this. I didn't use the espresso (it was for my son's birthday, and he doesn't like coffee flavor), but will definitely try it that way next time. I did leave the cake whole, rather than cutting it, and glazed the whole thing. That worked great. I served it with sweetened raspberries alongside, and Godiva white chocolate raspberry icecream. Unbeatable.

I used Baker's chocolate, that's all Safway had. It worked fine. I tasted it right after it was done and the cake was so moist and chocolaty. I then refrigerated it for next day, it got denser overnight in the fridge. It's still great, but not as good as the day it was made. I gave it a whipped cream and raspberry filling before I covered it in ganach. It's worth all the effort.

It was definitely worth the time and effort to make this. You can probably cut it into 12 to 16 pieces. We used Ghirardelli chocolate which worked out fine. It is very dense, and smooth, but not too sweet.

This was a delicious creation, very fudgy and a fabulous flavor! I can't wait to try it with the blood orange sauce. Sounds yummy!
