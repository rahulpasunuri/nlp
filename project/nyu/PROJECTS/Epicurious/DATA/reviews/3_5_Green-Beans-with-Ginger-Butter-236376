I do not know how anyone could say this recipe was bland, but then I did not skimp on the ginger. One could add a touch of capsicum to the recipe to give it a little heat. The touch of lemon from the zest gave it a little zip. Lovely recipe. Served with salmon with a cherry ginger sauce and a Pinot Noir from Carneros. Went beautifully. Will definitely make this easy recipe again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. It was a hit! Everyone raved about it. The beans were perfect and the ginger and hint of lemon was so refreshing. I made the butter and ginger mixture earlier and brought the cooked beans and mixture to our family's house to heat up the last part. There was something very sweet about hand drying the beans!

I served this for the first time for guests last night and it was wonderful. I used frozen haricots vert and let them get to room temperature before adding them to the recipe. I also used a mandolin with the "matchstick" blade for the ginger, which made this recipe a snap. Great for entertaining!

Wonderful. It was a nice balance to heavier dishes. I served it with baked ham and scalloped potatoes. My dinner guests loved it.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve Dinner 2007 and actually had family members asking me to bring the leftovers (I made a quadruple batch) to sister-in-law's house the next day! Was very tasty; a great side! I'll be making this again for Easter Sunday, too!

Just three words for this one "light and lovely". Of course, I'll make it again.

I made this last Thanksgiving (2006) and got rave reviews. Sister in-law requested I make this for Thanksgiving 2007. Makes a nice lighter side dish to a regular "heavy" Thanksgiving meal.

This recipe is quick and tasty as is. Nice idea from other reviewer to replace butter with toasted sesame oil. I added a bit of soy sauce. It has become "how we do green beans" at our house.

Delicious with just the right amount of flavor; definitely isn't over-powering on the palate. Works well even if adding carrots & the like.

If you like ginger, you will definitely love this dish. I'm trying to avoid butter in my cooking, so I would recommend trying some garlic olive oil in place of it.

This is a very flavorful side dish, I just love it. I modified it just a bit by omitting the butter and replacing it with a quarter-sized amount of toasted sesame seed oil. Very tasty and enhances the ginger spice of the green beans.

I made these for Thanksgiving and again last night. I really like the bright flavor of the ginger. Very refreshing and worth frequent repeating.

This was a nice change to accompany the turkey. I think that maybe the rest of the menu overpowered the beans, as they seemed too subtle. Not bad by any means, just not very memorable.

This is a great recipe. I used frozen petite green beans and the recipe worked just fine. It has a very delicate flavor, which works so well with the heavy flavors of Thanksgiving.

This recipe really deserves 3 1/2 forks - delish. I used haricot verts and took the recommendation to boil them the day before (2 1/2 to 3 mintues was perfect) to cut down on the Thanksgiving day madness - worked beautifully. I used about 2 inches of fresh ginger and the zest of one lemon and found the balance to be quite nice: simple and clean.

I made this for potluck type Thanksgiving and got lots of compliments! The light citrus and interesting ginger flavor was a great departure from the heavy casseroles and mashed potatoes. Delicious and easy to make.

Very good. A great complement to an otherwise heavy meal. I suggest going easy on the ginger... at least to start, as it can be overpowering.

My family was ambivalent about this receipe- some people liked it, others didn't. I would use about half the amount of ginger, maybe cut into small dice instead of matchsticks. The full amount of ginger seemed overwhelming. The lemon provided a subtle hint of flavor without being overwhelming. The recipe was also very easy and the ingredients could all be cleaned and prepared the previous night.

This was wonderful! The ginger and lemon peel was not overwhleming, but added just enough flavor to perk up the beans. Starting this year, this will be my Christmas bean recipe.

I gave this a test run for pre-Thanksgiving and did not care for it. I used way less ginger than the recipe called for and it was still too much for me. The ginger over-powered the french green beans.
