hey, we love this recipe and although I might have reviewed it in the past-I couldn't find it. I do double the butter/spice recipe for a normal sized squash. it is great for night of and left overs. Don't need the fresh cilantro if you don't have it. Our itty bitty micro wave takes about 2x as long.

A 4 lb spaghetti squash? Where do you find one of those? Or the pickup truck to cart it home in? I did this with the largest squash in my market, which was 1 lb. There is something seriously off in the proportions here. I cut the spices down proportionately, but 1/8 stick of butter was not nearly enough. And the cayenne was still too heavy. I want to taste squash, not just cayenne.

I never thought spaghetti squash could be so good! I cut the large squash in half and scooped out the seeds before putting in microwave. Just seems easier. 7 mins, turn, 8 more mins. Squash comes right out with a fork. Used 1T butter and 1T olive oil for a good sized squash and it was plenty of fat. Doubled the spices as suggested, and added 1/3 c. raisins to the butter/spice to soften them. Topped with some toasted pine nuts. Non-veggie eaters loved this and are impressed you can turn a squash into something this good! Very, very easy to make.

I had a small squash, so I halved the other ingredients...except the salt--whoops. Other than being way too salty (kosher rock salt, no less), it was super yummy. I added a few black sesame seeds for fun.

After eating the left overs I had to amend my review of this recipe -- the left overs were so good! The flavor had a chance to meld -- what a difference! I will definitely make again. Much better the second day.

I had never eaten spaghetti squash before so I was apprehensive about preparing it. I thought it would taste watery and mushy like steamed vegetables. I am so glad to have been proven wrong! This was amazing. I cut it in half and roasted it in the oven at 375 for about 35 minutes. I followed reviewer suggestions and only used a 1/2 tablespoon butter, less than 2 tablespoons olive oil, and I added a snack size box of purple raisins as well as toasted pine nuts. I kept the spices exact (my squash was 3.1 pounds). I could not stop eating this dish. It is the perfect combination of spicy, salty, sweet and buttery. I look forward to making it again next week!

Stumbled upon this recipe while browsing for thanksgiving recipes; reminded me of a Spaghetti squash that bought awhile ago. Decided to make it for a quick/easy dinner. Was very good and added some chickpeas and dried cranberries based on previous suggestions. Microwaving worked well, and I let the squash sit a little bit longer so that more steam would escape, it was still very warm. Didn't have cilantro on hand and I think I was a little heavy handed with the spices but still very good and happy I found.

I used a 3lb squash and only needed half the butter, the flavor is rich like good Indian Food. We ate it with garlic naan bread. Next time I will serve it on top of quinoa. I love how easy and simple this recipe is.

Wow! That was great! I tried spaghetti squash several years ago and didn't like it so I thought I would give it another try. I was going to use Arrabbiata but saw this recipe and decided to give it a try. What a lovely dish for a rainy, damp, fall evening. I added toasted almonds and golden raisins. I didn't have cilantro and it would have been better with it but it was very yummy. I bought a large squash so I only used half of it for this recipe and will try the other half with something else tomorrow. This is a keeper!

I have not read all reviews, so apologize in advance if this has been posted before. However, what I want to say is that it is much easier to halve the squash lengthwise and remove the seeds before it is cooked You are not dealing with a hot squash and you have less cooking time. 9 minutes total on high at one time with a 2 1/4 lb squash was more than enough. Also nice touch to squeeze a little fresh lemon, lime, or grate some zest on the cleaned squash. Very nice, classy, simple dish. Sauce rocks.

I tried this recipe and it became an immediate fav. I was getting bored with the two ways that I have seasoned spaghetti squash for years. I added 1 diced chicken breast for protein. Other than the 1 1/2 hours baking in the oven, it is quick dish to put together. In the future I'll cook the squash a day ahead or try the microwave method.

Our squash was just over 2 lbs, and I added 3/4 lb chicken breast, 1 C peas, 8 oz sliced mushrooms, 2 chopped onions, increased the garlic to about 5 cloves and doubled the spices - I also added about 1/2 tsp fenugreek. We skipped the cilantro (raining & no one wanted to venture out to the garden). I subbed about 3/4 C evap skim milk for the butter. So yummy!

I'm not much of a microwaver... and the hissing and spitting noise it made towards the end of the cooking was a bit disconcerting! I decided it was "done" after 2 minutes of the noisy bit of cooking (it was softer to the touch), but it was probably a bit firmer than I would have liked. I bumped up the spices & garlic because I like "gutsy" (strong?) flavors. Following the recommendations of others, I mixed olive oil and butter... and turned it into the main dish by adding a can of chick peas. It was a hit! Will definitely make it again... it was quick, easy and very tasty.

I find spaghetti squash as something I want to eat about once or twice each fall but after this dish, I will seek it out! After reading a few reviews I did add a few things and am encouraged by all future possibilities. I added red onions and greens and served it alongside pistachio-coated chicken. Perfect! I would strongly recommend pistachios if serving as a main dish. It's absolutely worth trying at least once and throwing in whatever else you have around.

Very delicious recipe. My husband said it made the squash taste better- as a rule spaghetti squash is not his favorite. :) I followed the recipe but didn't have cilantro. I added golden raisins, broccoli and cashews. I also went less on the red pepper. I so appreciate all the tips in the reviews.

Rating: 4
I really like the recipe and would definitely make it again. I made a few additions/substitutions following some of the other reviewer's suggestions. I substituted olive oil for butter, added red onion with the garlic, added cumin seeds, black pepper, cloves, and nutmeg to the spices, and added chick peas. I ended up stir-frying the oil, garlic, onions, spices, and chick peas together in a wok. At the end, I turned off the stove and tossed the squash and cilantro into wok to mix everything together. It turned out great.

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious and incredibly easy and quick to make once the squash is ready. (I baked mine in the oven since I don't have a microwave. Personally I think squash is much better baked if you have the time.) Loved the spices. I added pine nuts, golden raisins and chickpeas as other reviews suggested and I think it really made the dish. I didn't have any cilantro on hand, but I think with the added extras it really didn't need it. I liked this dish so much, and it was so simple to prepare, that I made it twice in the same week!

This is the first recipe with spaghetti squash I ever made; my husband and I had our doubts, we almost said, forget it, we will eat the leftover pizza. So glad we did not - this is terrific. I did add almonds (which I toasted in the pan after pouring the butter and spice mixture over the squash) and raisins, which I think are critical for both flavor and texture. I used half butter and half olive oil. Could have done 1/4 and 3/4. I roasted the spaghetti squash in the oven because I read (here?) that the strands would separate more, but made it early in the day, and reheated the strands in the microwave. Thanks to all who made suggestions and gave advice; those comments encouraged me and I am so glad to have this added to my recipe box!

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. I found the microwave didn't work for me; either the squash was too big or my microwave is too weak. If you have a slow cooker, you can apparently cook it in there all day; will try this next time. Handy tip for taking out the seeds and guts: use tongs and an oven mitt - this is SO much easier than trying to do it with a fork. The spices are delicious, and if you throw in some canned beans it's a meal unto itself.

Rating: 4
Huge hit! I was skeptical about the microwave but, in fact, it was quick and effective as promised. I also used both butter and olive oil and doubled the spiced oil/butter mixture for my larger than average squash. Lastly due to a penchant for the sweet in my house I added a touch of brown sugar. GREAT!!

Aroma was wonderful, and tasted great (with a little additional salt) as a meal. Even better if you use it as a base.

This was fantastic. I made two additions, sauteed chicken breast and peas. I started by sauteing the chicken breast (about 1 pound) in olive oil, then added the garlic and spices (I tripled the amounts) to the chicken, added the spaghetti sqaush cooked as per the recipe, half a bag of frozen peas, and the half stick of butter in the recipe. An excellent dinner I will definitely make again!

I also accidentally (way) overcooked the garlic. I would recommend removing the pan from the heat immediately after the garlic's 1 min. in the butter. As far as taste goes, it was too much butter, in my opinion. Next time, I might either use less butter or try the olive oil suggestion. I also used only 1/2 tsp of salt and instead of adding nutmeg in for more Moroccan flavor, I added about 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Spaghetti squash is fun!

I walked into my house one day, walked past the microwave and was stunned to see a whole spagetti squash rotating around inside. I immediately freaked and asked my novice-cook-boyfriend what he was doing and is that thing going to explode in there?! But he shoved the recipe under my nose and I calmed down. Never heard of cooking the whole squash in the microwave before. Must say, this has good flavor and easy to put together. Our squash was a little bit bigger, so the amount of butter wasn't too much. Have made it again and really didn't measure accurately - heaped the coriander, cumin, garlic and cilantro - yum.

This was my first attempt at spaghetti squash. I baked it whole as another reviewer recommended and that worked well. It probably deserves a third fork, but I accidentally overcooked the garlic. The butter ended up feeling too heavy, too. Next time I'll use olive oil and a more attentive eye!

Loved this! I followed the previous suggestions to increase garlic and spices, substituted mostly oil for butter and added toasted pine nuts as one person did.

I also added crumbled French feta at the end and thought it was wonderful. Am looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow!

Wow - this was great! Tried spaghetti squash for the first time to find a South Beach friendly "substitute" for starches and I'm glad I did. Even the kids didn't object too strongly. Substituted 2 Tbs olive oil for 1/2 the butter. Will try all olive oil next time around. Doubled, maybe even tripled the cilantro with great results. Try this one!

Like many others, I loaded up on the garlic for this recipe and loved it. Also, I didn't want to put all that butter b/c of cholesterol concerns, so I just melted a little pat and used a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to make the garlic and spice dressing, then poured more cold olive oil on the squash when I mixed it up. This will now be our standard recipe for spaghetti squash.

A small (4-6") squash in a 400 degree oven will cook in approximately 20-35 minutes. Place the pierced squash directly on the rack, with a pan on the rack below to collect any juices should you overcook it a little. It doesn't matter if you do, as it's quite forgiving. The skin will darken & a fork to the skin will poke through when it's very done. At that stage it is quite easy to pull the strings into spaghetti-like bits with a fork. Bonus of using an oven: You pull the seeds out directly into a sieve, rince them with water & then a little salt & put them right back into the oven with a little light oil. Just like pumpkin seeds, and your oven is already on.

I loved the taste combination in this recipe BUT there is a way to make it SO much easier and much more healthy too. The amount of butter is way too much... My suggestion: use butter to taste, then forget the garlic and use garlic salt instead of regular salt. Mix all the spices, garlic salt and cilantro in a small bowl. After scraping out the squash and adding a bit of butter, sprinkle the spices and cilantro over the squash little by little as you toss it. I think it will be perfect then!!!!

Haven't tried this recipe yet, but thought I'd share my 'normal' spaghetti squash recipe. I split the squash length-wise, clean it out, and then put the following into each half: pumpkin pie spice, dash of cloves, brown sugar, pat of butter (or a little apple juice), and crystalized ginger. I cover each half with plastic wrap and microwave until tender. I never measure so you'll have to use your imagination as far as amounts. This works well with butternut squash, too. :) Enjoy!

Because there aren't many spaghetti squash recipes, I am rating this although I did make it in the oven. (I was roasting a chicken at the same time.)

Served the chicken on top with cilantro garnish.
