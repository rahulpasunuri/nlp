This is one of my favorite steak recipes for casual dinner parties. I generally make it without the sauce and get rave reviews every time.

This is a GREAT recipe that, when left over, I made into sandwiches with thin rye bread, sharp mustard and a lot of butter.

Really tasty, husband wanted more sauce, next time I'll probably double it. Again Fantastic!

Love this recipe - it is very easy yet has an unusual flavor for a marinated steak - I also make it with the Stir-Fried Sesame Asparagus and the two dishes make a very nice pairing.

My friends and I thought the amount of marinade made was not enough to infuse the meat. More is needed.

This is one of my favorite easy meals. I serve with rice and broccoli. Delicious and easy. I usually double the marinade for extra sauce. Makes great lunch leftovers.

Great and easy recipe! The first time I made this, I only marinated 4 to 5 hours and used flank steak. The 2nd time I made it I marinated for a day and a half and used Petite Rounds. The thicker rounds definitely worked better, but both were good. Made it for friends and got rave reviews. A keeper.

I marinated this overnight, and wow - such flavor! I used New York steak - the thickest I could find (about 2+ inches) and after grilling, sliced it and plated it with the marinade spooned over it - after boiling the marinade. It was so flavorful. Our guests really loved it. Now that I think of it, those leftovers are calling to me right now...

For the Sesame Oil referred to in this recipe, be sure to use the dark, aromatic, oriental sesame seed oil (toasted), not a light (untoasted) sesame oil. Both are made from sesame seeds; the light oil is good for cooking (has a high burn point) and the dark is better for flavoring (has a low burn point and more intense flavor). Use the dark sesame oil here.

Great flavor..have made twice. Marinated overnight..not overpowering or too salty; I used low- salt Tamari. Served with suggested stir- fried asparagus and jasmine rice.. good enough for company

Really good, I would use flank steak next time instead of the sirloin. It was a hit with my kids

I made this recipe several times over the summer; it's fantastic. Easy, delicious, versatile. This should be a staple in everyone's repertoire, except of course you veggies!

Definitely would make again. I marinated overnight and the leftover marinade boiled and seved with the steak was out of this world. Yummy!

Easy but very, very good. The marinade really has a wonderful flavor...it works better on slightly thicker steaks and try to marinate overnight. Yummy1

Wow!!! What a winning meal. Made this for husband and friends and they raved. I was skeptical at first but trusted the reviewers and they were right on the money! Easy too.

I used the marinade on flat iron steaks. They were excellent!

Wonderful. I served it with mashed root vegetables with horseradish (from this site) and roasted vegetables. Our guests had seconds and thirds. This will be our regular marinate for grilled steaks.

I used beef cubes. My soy sauce was very salty, so I only used 4 T., also added 2 tsp brown sugar. Marinated about 3-4 hours. It was good, next time I will try it with a london broil.

I made this for a dinner party of 15 people and it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe exactly, but made another batch of the marinade for sauce, as most of it had been absorbed during the 20 hours that I let it sit and marinade. The extra sauce was a huge hit.

Our favorite (reasonably priced) steak dinner! Serve with sushi rice salad and broccoli.

Rating: 3
Great for a casual bbq with friends. I've made this twice this summer - and my guests really loved it. I found that using a thicker cut of steak is better - as opposed to a thinner 1 inch that the recipe suggests. I also added a tsp. of brown sugar to the marinade - which I loved & used half of the amount of soy sauce (low-sodium). A definite keeper.

This recipe is awesome and easy. One of my favorites for beef. A real keeper!

Very delicious and easy to prepare. My only change was to add garlic to the marinade. I doubled the recipe and used half on a 1.5 lb sirloin, and the other half on large boneless chicken breasts. Our guests raved and gobbled it up. Served with coconut rice and salad - voila!

Very good and very easy! The ginger gave it a nice touch and the meat was absolutely wonderful in terms of tenderness.

Rating: 4
This is the perfect recipe! Simple, quick and full of flavor.I took the 1" thick top sirloin and sliced into 1" wide "logs" to marinade. When I removed to grill, I added 1/4 c of orange juice to boil (which did thicken the sauce nicely). Only needed about 3 minutes a side to make medium. Served with a grill-roastd herbed potato hobo pack and stir-fried veggies...Excellent summer fare. This is truly a keeper!!

Rating: 4
this is very tasty and easy. but if you are grilling the steak, you may as well baste the (left whole) asparagus and green onions with the marinade and grill them too. lightly toast some sesame seeds in a dry skillet for more flavor. if the sauce is too salty, sweeten with pineapple juice.

yum yum yum. Very simple and very tasty. My steaks only marinated about 2 hours. Sauce was fabulous serverd with steak, plain rice and sesame asparagus. A definite keeper. I'm sure it would be wonderful grilled on the barbecue....

This marinade and sauce works great! I used small filet mignons with the asparagus and paired it with lobster tails. Made for a great Valentines Day dinner. Would not recommend with porterhouse, prime rib, or other well marbled cuts because the true steak taste is over powered.

Used sirlion steaks and only marinated for 5 hours. The steaks were terrific and tasty. My five year old even liked it. This is a winner will be making again for company.

We marinated the meat over night. It was so tender and just delicious. Will definitely be making this again

I made this using 1" thick NY Strip Steaks. My family & friends loved it. When I shared the source and described the review process, everyone at the table gave this 4 forks.

Rating: 4
Excellent - my husband loved it and I'm making it again for company tonight. I used NY strip steaks, and the next time I will strain the sauce since the green onions turned brown and wasn't very attractive on the plate. Marinating over night is very important - don't bother if you only have a few hours. No other variations on the recipe. Served with wasabi mashed potatoes and an asian salad. Steaks were large, so I made lunch wraps with the leftovers (potatoes, steak and sauce). Great with champagne. Enjoy!!

This marinade was DELICIOUS! The whole family loved it. I did not puree as it suggested but dumped it all in a ziplock bag for an hour and it was wonderful. We used Skirt steak (may take a bit longer for a london broil, etc.) I think I'll try it on Salmon Fillet next time. Yum!

These steaks are really good! I made these and my mother-in-law, who is an amazing cook, made her own recipe and everyone preferred these hands down! Definitely marinate overnight if you can. Save some bread for dipping in the sauce....

Great! I even used powdered ginger, but I would certainly use fresh ginger next time. And yes, use low-sodium soy sauce if you are cutting back on your sodium intake. My very inexpensive cut of steak was tender and delicious.

Rating: 4
To the cook from Naperville: try low sodium soy sauce. Many recipes are too salty for me, so I use it almost exclusively.

It was a hit. I used rib-eye steaks and it came out so tender that a fork was able to cut it up. Easy, tasty, juicy and tender - this one is definitely worth making again.

Fabulous. Easy, and incredibly tasty. I'd be thrilled to get this out at a top restaurant, so being able to make and serve it at home is a real treat.

Rating: 4
This recipe is definitely a keeper -- easy to prepare and the results are delicious! I used London Broil and it turned out fine. Next time, I will marinate the meat longer (I only had 4 hours this time), and will double the amount of marinade. It is incredibly tasty; the flavors go together unbelievably well. I'll also try the suggested side dishes; I think they'd be the perfect complement.

Rating: 2
This was extremely salty for my taste. I can't quite imagine making extra marinade, as another reviewer suggested. Maybe Kikkoman is saltier than most soy sauces, but I don't think so. If I were to make it again, I'd probably cut the soy sauce in half.

Rating: 4
This was a HIT! Everyone loved it! I served it with the recommended Stir Fired Sesame Asparagus and those were amazing as well. All the flavors really worked well together. This is one that my family asks me to make. And this is one that I will continue to make at least once a month.

I, too, served this dish with wasabi mashed potatoes and the stir fried asparagus. I served the mango-curry shrimp in wonton shells as an app. I used london broil instead of steak. The marinade was great! I should have cut the london broil on more of a bias. However, the meal was a success and I'll use the marinade again!

This recipe is EXCELLENT! Two tongues up! I can't wait to make it again! I would probably double the yummy marinade so I would have more sauce. Served it with wasabi mashed potatoes and stir-fry asparagus! You won't be disappointed!

Outstanding!! One of the best marinates I've ever used and makes an UNBELIEVABLE sauce. I used tenderloin steaks, added 1T minced garlic and a little Thai chili pepper. Served with the yummy Wasabi Mashed Potatoes from this website. Definitely a keeper!

Yummy and simple. Served it with the recommended asparagus recipe and white rice -- which was great with the sauce.

I've got three words for this dish: De - Li -Cious! My girlfriend and I marinated the meat for about 24 hours before throwing it on the grill. The best thing about this recipe is that it doesn't take long to prepare at all. We made it with the sesame stir-fry asparagus as suggested which was wonderful. As an appetizer, we made coconut tiger shrimp with an apricot dipping sauce. We had a great white wine with the appetizer and a wonderful red wine with the main course. We then topped it all off with a peanut butter mousse pie and a couple of nice cigars.

A great ginger beef recipe! Marinated for 8 hours and the steaks were very tender and flavorful. I did add 3 cloves of grated garlic and 3 tbsp honey to the marinade, otherwise followed the recipe. Served with stir fried snow peas, mushrooms and onions, along with steamed new potatoes. The marinade/sauce was excellent with the potatoes. Very easy to make and oh so yummy! Will go into my favorites file!

This was great! I also substituted the shallots for the onion and marinated for a little over 24 hours. Great taste, easy to make. Definitely a keeper!

This is a good ginger/sesame/soy marinade. I added a bit of chili oil (a.k.a. "hot oil") for a little kick and liked it alot. I pan fried the steak, set the meat aside, poured the marinade in the pan to let it boil for a bit, sliced the steak, added the meat back to the now thickened marinade, and tossed it all together. I then picked the meat out of the sauce and served with the "Sesame Asparagus" (which rocks btw!) on the side.

Rating: 4
The marinade is easy to prepare with ingrediants that most people have around the kitchen. The flavors blend well with none of them overpowering the finished product. Even though we enjoy a well done steak, we found the 24 hour marinade made it both moist and juicy. Will use again!

I've made this recipe a few times and we have always enjoyed it. I have used different cuts of meat from sirloin to strip steaks to tenderloin. All are good! I've tried a few variations on the marinade but I think the original recipe is the best - I usually double the recipe, measure exact and don't change a thing!

I surprised my boyfriend with this dish, and he went crazy for it. The marinade is just fantastic, and we found that it was even more delicious the next day as leftovers. Absolutely easy to make. Will make it again- soon!

It's a simple and good tasting recipe. Great for a weeknight meal. I actually didn't like the marinade served over the steak; I thought the steak stood better by itself.

I substituted shallots for the onions (just because I was out of them), added a dash of dry marsala (why not?) and then marinated my top loin steaks overnight before grilling them on the barby. It's an excellent and simple recipe that I'll certainly make again. Even my wife, who has a strong distaste for beef, thought they were delicious.

A very good, rather easy to make main course, this being the first reciepe I've tried on this site. I grilled the steak on the barbecue, which was a definate plus, and after slicing the steak, poured some of the sauce over it. I would definately make this again. The girlfriend loves it, and she usually hates beef. If I could only get her to eat veal...

this was very tasty and tender. i used tri-tip steaks and marinated them for 24 hours. once before i had only marinated the steaks for 4 hours and i do think the steaks need at least 24 hours for a full flavor. the sauce is awesome on the steak and on the rice. i also made the sesame asparagas and that too was also a hit!

Delicious! And so easy. I let the meat marinate for about 36 hours, and it was tender and wonderfully flavored. I served this with stir-fried sesame asparagus and sauteed mushrooms diane (both recipes recommended here) and my friends think I'm a great cook now!

This was rather so-so for me. The marinade wasn't very flavorful as I had hoped, even though it was marinading for several hours. I may try it one more time, otherwise I'll pull it from my recipe book.

Great flavor and easy. To serve 2 I used the full mainade recipe but only 1/2 cup of the green onions which worked out fine. The longer you marinate the better the flavor. I served this with Marbleized Root Vegetable Puree and Grilled Pear Salad with Bacon, Roquefort and Port Vinaigrette both on this site.
