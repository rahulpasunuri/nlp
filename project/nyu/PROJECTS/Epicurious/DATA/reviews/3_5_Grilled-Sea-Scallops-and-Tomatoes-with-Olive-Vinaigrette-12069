I added grilled zucchini to the grilled scallops on the outdoor grill and added another hot element to the dish. It added some balance and flavor. I think it's fine to omit the roasted red pepper and use any kind of lettuce you have.

Great first course. The vinagrette is very tasty. This dish really dresses up your usually grilled meal! I skewered the scallops and also made some shrimp for a friend who won't eat scallops and it was perfect. OK to add some other interesting greens as well to salad. Agree that the tomatoes are a must.

Obviously, the scallops are not the star of this recipe, but the vinaigrette is very nice and rounds out a very healthy dish with an interesting blend of flavors and textures. The presentation can be beautiful, as well. the recipe can serve a number of roles, including a wonderful salad course, or simply a nice, light evening meal.

This is a surprisingly tasty dish, and I'll definitely make it again. The only change I made was to double the amount of arugula (to reduce your prep time, look for pre-washed bags of arugula at the store). The recipe produces plenty of vinaigrette, so dont make any extra. Also, if you plan to serve this to guests, I'd recommend that you not toss the vinaigrette with the arugula; it will look prettier. Instead, simply drizzle some of the vinaigrette over the greens and scallops once they are plated. Serve the remaining vinaigrette on the side.

We made it as written, but served with green beans since we didn't have arugula. I loved the vinaigrette.

super easy, super tasty and attractive too! Like the olive vinagrette, not too olive

I may have expected too much. We don't often have sea scallops. I was hoping for a show-stopper, but this wasn't it. It was good, but not exciting. A little bland.

Definitely a do again dish. It sure doesn't take 45 minutes, which was great. All of the favours work well together. Next time I may use endive and place the scallops on one for a pretty presentation.

This recipe was fabulous! The olive vinaigrette was very flavourful. I agree with the earlier comment that the tomatoes are a must with this dish. Do not omit! I also sprinkled the scallops with thyme before grilling. If you like scallops and olives, you must try this dish!

What a great recipe. Unusual combination of flavors. Well worth the experience of standing in 30degree weather using the grill. I would use a little less of the olives next time, however.

Great recipe, easy to prepare. Could not believe I had all of the ingredients in the house.

Wonderful flavor combination. Don't be tempted to omit tomatoes, even if you don't usually like tomatoes with fish. Their acidity really brightens the dish. I would suggest slicing the scallops in half, if they are large, for faster grilling. The portion size stated was sparse for 2, unless this is a luncheon or first course. I tripled everything, and served 3 as a dinner entree.

The vinaigrette dressing in this recipe was delicious. Instead of chopping, I just threw all the ingredients into the food processor. (I also doubled the olives, but that's my preference!) I served the scallops, tomatoes, and dressing over mixed greens -- it was quite a hit that night!!
