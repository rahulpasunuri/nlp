Wow! Can't believe it's taken me this long to make this wonderful recipe! I cut it down to serve just the 2 of us, so reduced the sauce as well and used canola oil instead of safflower. I also didn't have any mint, but didn't miss it, although I'd like to try it next time. Served over arugula and drizzled sauce over it and the chicken. Made a side of sauteed yellow squash, so plate was very pretty, esp w/ drizzled sauce on white plate. Will be making this again!

I wish I could give this five forks! This is one of our favorite dinners. Powerfully flavorful, the sweetness of the raspberry sauce balances the peppery kick of the coating. I serve it over a bed of spinach, don't bother to butterfly the chicken, and make 6 chicken breast halves rather than 4 (the coating recipe as written makes plenty for 6).

would definitely make this again ,but instead of dipping the cutlets in mustard mix, I just brushed it on the cutlets, and than dipped in the panko mixture. Came out much lighter. Instead of white wine vinegar in the sauce ,used raspberry vinegar instead.

This is an exceptional dish. Stunning, sophisticated, and will impress guests. The richness of the chicken pairs with the light fruit and salad greens. A show stopper!

Messed up the sauce, burned the crust off the chicken a little bit, bought the wrong kind of wine vinegar, and with all that, it still turned out delicious! Be sure to save some raspberries for the plate itself, and add some fancy dancy cheese - I used goat cheese.

I do not recommend this dish. It is extremely heavy and, at least if you prepare it as described, the flavors do not end up standing out and simply all merge into an indistinguishable mush. Before you prepare this recipe, take a good look at the ingredients. 1/4 cup of mayo, 1/3 cup honey mustard, plus 1 tablespoon of dijon mustard. Oh, and some chopped fresh mint in there too, but trust me, you won't be able to taste it. And that's just what you coat the chicken in before you even get to the hazlenut, panko, salt, and pepper coating. If you like heavy, salty, fatty dishes, you may enjoy this. Personally, I found the dish to be overpoweringly heavy, and only gave off the flavor of "salt" and "fat" with a bit of crunchy texture which is otherwise flavorless. The raspberry sauce likewise is heavy and only serves to add "sweet" to the mix of "fat" and "salt" sensations. If none of this bothers you -- and I recognize my tastes may differ from others -- then I at least recommend that you serve this with a full bodied red to help bring some much-needed tartness and acidity to the affair.

This dish came out perfect! We used boysenberries and macadamia nuts as substitutes. Would highly recommend this dish to anyone entertaining.

I agree with another reviewer that said this recipe seemed like a bunch of ingredients thrown together. This was served with the Clementine Jicama Salad from this website and the salad stole the show (it was amazing). The flavors got lost when served with anything else. When I tried the leftovers the next day, the crunch from the hazelnuts is nice, but certainly not my favorite recipe. I don't think I will make this again. I will use components of the recipe, but not in it's entirety.

I substituted walnuts for hazelnuts, and used a Tbl of honey to approximately 1/4 cup of Dijon (no honey mustard in the pantry). Upped the mayo just a tad to get a good consistency, and used dried mint instead of fresh (winter comes early to the U.P.!). Panko is just the emperor's new clothes as far as breadcrumbs go. I just smashed my homemade crumbs a little finer than usual. I used frozen raspberry puree (berries from the summer garden), and backed off on the oil in the raspberry sauce. The recipe was awesome! Chicken was good even without the sauce! Will definitely make this again.

This is my "go-to" dish for company. It is both easy to make and delicious. I added a little goat cheese on top of the encrusted chicken in the oven and it was a perfect addition to an already stellar dish. You can also separate some of the raspberry sauce (unsalted) and add more sugar to it to use for drizzling over a dessert.

Stupendous dish! I have made it twice and it is foolproof. I am not the most exact cook, and it came out delicious each time. My guests were so impressed.

I used pecans instead of hazelnuts but I thought this dish was too sweet. The flavors didn't mix - it just seemed like a whole lot of thrown together ingredients.

Good recipe. Too salty so I would reduce the amount (I even used unsalted hazelnuts and it was still too salty). The crust got soggy on the bottom so bake it on a grate and let it rest on the grate.

Very good eat! I added a little milk to the sauce i found it to be very vinigery . I also used frozen raspberry's due to the late season. It still was amazing. The mint on the chicken is especially delicious.

For those of you who've served this at a dinner party: is it ok to brown the chicken on the stove in advance of the guests' arrival and "hold" it in the oven longer than the 15 minutes recommended in the recipe? I don't want to be cooking when my guests are here, but I don't want the chicken to dry out.

fantastic! I had to use frozen mango this time instead of the raspberry (all I had on hand) and it was even better then when I made it the first time with the exact ingredients. it is truely a terrific dinner -party dish as indicated.

Just made this recipe with a few slight revisions. The mustard made it quite salty so next time will not add the additional salt. I was out of hazelnuts so used pecans. I served it with, rather than on, mixed greens. I didn't have fresh raspberries so used some nice whole frozen ones and cooked the sauce a little then strained some of the seeds out. Used honey rather than sugar. and butter rather than oil and at the end added a little Framboise liqueur. It still had the taste of fresh summer raspberries. Yum It is a beautiful dish and looked especially attractive next to the dark colored greens. I also butterflied the chicken as the recipe directed but cut them into large scallops to make the size more attractive on the plate.

I have made this recipe twice now, exactly per the ingredient list and agree with all reviewers that this is a top-notch dish, one that wowed everyone I've served it to including kids. Do watch the color on the browning as the coating can darken quickly. I've used only the best organic chicken and taken it out of the oven at exacty 170. One of the nicest things about this recipe is how moist the meat is, so don't over do it. I've also found that the presentation is best when the chicken breasts are sliced about 1" thick and layered over the mixed greens before you drizzle the sauce. After all, it's a pretty high-fat dish and an entire half-breast is a sizable portion.

This chicken was delicious!! I substituted dried basil for the fresh mint,and the flavor combination was terrific. I also didn't have the nuts so left them out, but we didn't miss them; the coating was nice and crunchy. (I used whole wheat panko, which had great flavor, as well as crunch.)The spiciness of the mustard is balanced out so well with the sweetness of the raspberry sauce in the finished product. The only thing I would change is to cook the chicken at a lower temp because it did get a bit dark during the saute.

I forgot to add that sauce really is the most beautiful pink and is quite impressive - don't be scared, pink can taste wonderful! I turned a raspberry hater into a raspberry lover with this sauce and meal. The salty hazelnuts with the sweet raspberries was just divine!

Oh my. This is the best thing I've made in a while. Definitely my favorite recipe of the year! I'm thanking my lucky stars for finding it. You will not be disappointed! Great and simple to prepare for company as well. The raspberry sauce is so delicious, I've made it several times on it's own. The only thing you could possibly change is a tad less salt. This is so delicious my mouth is watering already!

Flavors were excellent...but I am surprised no one commented on the color of the sauce. After plating it, I drizzled the sauce over the greens and a bit on the chicken. The bright pink of the sauce looked a little too garish and unappealing on the chicken breast itself. Maybe should have served alongside like the recipe said, not overtop.

Oh my! What an absolutely Awesome dish with a capital "A!" A little scary with all the different flavors of mint, mustard, black pepper, etc. but they all work in concert for an exciting dish. Served it for a dinner party and was a hit and the recipe was in quick demand. When dish assembly was finished, I ground a little (emphasize little) extra coarse sea salt on top before serving to make it perfect. So juicy, flavorful and fun, you'll forget you're eating chicken!

I halved the recipe and it made a nice dinner for two (plus leftovers for me). And I made the full amount of raspberry sauce and used it for salad dressing the rest of the week... for pics and additional comments, see: http://megan- deliciousdishings.bl ogspot.com/2008/07/h azelnut-crusted- chicken-with- raspberry.html

This was succulent and delicious. I subbed blueberries for raspberries since they were at the farmer's market, and macademia nuts for hazelnuts. I also recommend using medium hit on the stove before popping them in the oven.

Great except that my crust fell off the chicken. I will use a mustard, egg, mint wash rather than mayo next time, and will dip chicken in flour first.

I LOVED this recipe! My future husband is not real keen on chicken, but he ate every last bite of this dish. I am a chef/mate on a yacht and will definately add this to the menu. I could not find hazelnuts, so I substitued with macadamia nuts I chopped fine in a food processer first. I also added an additional TBSP of sugar to the raspberry sauce for a little sweeter taste. The chicken needs to be cooked at medium in the pan, as it browns way too dark at a higher temp. I found the chicken to stay nice and juicy, and very flavorful. A GREAT dish.

All the flavors in this dish come together in a really delicious way, and it's not too difficult or time-consuming to make. I ground up the hazelnuts in a food processor and they didn't grind evenly, so my hazelnuts ranged from a powder to small chunks. This worked well because the powder adhered to the chicken better and didn't burn as easily, but I still got the crunch from the nut chunks. You do have to watch the chicken breasts closely as you saute them though, as the nuts burn quickly. My husband really liked this, and it will definitely be a dish we make repeatedly.

Made this for a Sunday family dinner and everyone loved it. I used sour cream instead of mayo and more sugar to the raspberry sauce, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. The only issue I had was that the coating didn't adhere to the chicken perfectly, even after time in the oven. Served with roasted potatoes with herbs. Next time will add some goat cheese to the greens.

This dish was an excellent blend of flavors and a beautiful presentation.I followed the recipe exactly as written but substituted pecans for the hazelnuts. The chicken was very moist with great flavor(the fresh mint had me a bit nervous but ended up a perfect compliment to the other flavors).The chicken needs to be cooked at a lower temp though because it tends to brown deeply very fast. Overall...restaurant quality and a dish I will definitely add to my permanent file!

This is fantastic. My husband kept saying, "Wow! This is great!" I served the chicken over mesculin mix with manouri cheese and fresh raspberries around the side. With the chicken on top and the beautiful raspberry sauce on the chicken it was gorgeous! I substituted nonfat yogurt for the mayo for a lighter version and dried mint for the fresh and it worked great. The mint adds a really intersting flavor to the raspberry and mustard. I also chose to hand- chop the hazelnuts rather than pulverize them in the FP. Having the smaller chunks of the crunchy nuts was one of the things that made the dish.

absolutely delicious. easy to make and what a beautiful presentation!

I made this as written and felt it was very tasty. A little too fussy for a weeknight unless you make the sauce and marinate the chicken in the honey mustard sauce ahead of time. I think this would be a nice healthy-ish choice for a casual dinner party, but it's an even better family dinner. At heart, it's chicken on a salad. The raspberries make it very nice. One tip I would strongly suggest would be to make sure your hazelnut chunks are very small, otherwise they don't adhere well and burn in the pan (something I unfortunately learned the hard way). I think when I make this next time, I'll pulverize most of the hazelnuts, but set back a portion of them chopped larger or barely chopped, saute them in a little butter and add those over the top for added crunch on the salad portion. Overall, I give it three forks because it's a lovely dish, but not absolutely fantastic. I will definitely make it again and again, though.

Sooo yummy! It was much easier than expected to make. The mixture of the mustards, mayo, mint and hazelnuts was scrumptuous and smelled so good while cooking. Would definitely make it again!

So good! My grocery store didn't have hazelnuts or fresh mint, so I substitued macadamia nuts and left out the mint. I made the raspberry sauce, but we didn't use it. The mustard sauce and coating kept the chicken very moist. This was a huge success!! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is really easy and great! The coating gives the chicken good flavor and keeps the moisture in while it roast. I used less oil for the raspberry sauce -- and it was still great.
