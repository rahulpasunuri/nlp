I made this for friends and it was excellent. The combination of ingredients really works. I did a modified version because my baguette got too hard from sitting out overnight!! I just served it as a spread for special bread and crackers. I mistakenly added double the blue cheese and it was okay but I think I would like it better as written as it was a little stronger than I like.

Delicious!!!! Served at a Girls Night Movie night and received rave reviews!!!

This was a quick appetizer. I chose it because I had company coming for snacks and wine without much notice and I had some blue cheese and prosciutto in the fridge. I am not a big fan of blue cheese but the combination with the prosciutto was nicely balanced. I did not have crimini mushrooms so used the same quantities of shiitake and button mushrooms. That was the only change I made. I did not have parsley and it would have been nice visually as it does look a bit colourless on the plate. It is also very rich, a little goes a long way. I drizzled the baguette slices in olive oil before broiling. Next time I would probably rub them with garlic as well.

excellent and easy to do in advance, I might sprinkle a little chopped thyme or parsley on before serving to give it some grean but otherwise a big hit!

Great recipe. It's hard to find a good appetizer that can be assembled quickly, last minute and still taste great. I cut the blue cheese in 1/2, too overpowering. Plus, agreed with another reviewer to chop the mushrooms into a larger sized bite. It's much more appealing on the crostini.

Excellent! I have used this mixture to top grilled rib-eye steaks, used a little less liquid and made phyllo purses out of, also made beef wellington with the mixture.....could eat it by the spoonful!

Rating: 3
I made this as written and is was delicious, but feel that the blue cheese was overkill and could barely be distinguished amongst the other rich ingredients. Next time, I will omit and add a spot of cognac to the nushrooms prior to adding the cream. Also, I think prosciutto can be omitted without compromising on flavor (for those with vegetarian guests...)

Will be making this again this New Year's Eve-- always a hit...try it!

Wonderful recipe and very easy! Like another reviewer mentioned, I kept the mushrooms a little chunky and that makes for a better texture! I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and added the prosciutto just after the 1/2 & 1/2 to let that cook a little bit. I made just before company arrived and left in the pan on the stove, covered. Then broiled slices of seeded baguette, spooned the warm mushroom mixture onto the toasted baguettes and served right away. No need to bake it again. Was a big hit!

This turns out amazing. It does not matter that it looks a little dull. It tastes amazing. I used fresh shiitake and crimini mushrooms that were of amazing quality I purchased at a gourmet shop. This is a real crowd pleaser. I used leftovers the next and put with arugula, made it a light lunch for guests.

Simple, speedy and superb!Who could ask for anything more from a recipe? Liked the idea someone suggested of substituting fat free 1/2 and 1/2 for the whipping cream, so since the rest of my menu was rather rich, thought this would be a kind gesture to my guests. It turned out so phenomenal a flavor, I can't imagine the necessity for actual whipping cream. I saw nothing but delighted faces on my guests and heard nothing but muffled "Wow! This is awesome"'s as they were all gobbled up! Once again, with the aid of Epicurious, I impressed my guests!

I just made these for the first time for an Italian themed dinner party. It was great having a appetizer that could be made ahead of time and quickly assembled. I love blue cheese so I did not think the flavor was overpowering- I noticed more the woody flavor of the mushrooms. I do think it helps to dice the mushrooms into kind of big chunks helps with the appearance- they cook down a lot so some texture helps. I think they are addictive rather than really good- if that makes sense! My friends also all liked them.

I have not made this so I do not know if this is possible, but would it work to cook the mushrooms w/ the garlic butter and cream, and then let them cool. Then toss with diced prosciutto and crumbled blue cheese? I just wondered if this would help with the presentation?

I made this the way other reviewers suggested: half the blue cheese. I used Point Reyes Bleu Cheese, which is mild and could have used a little more. I also added a few drops of Black Truffle Oil to the crostini after they came out of the oven, as another reviewer suggested. My husband helped me to assemble the crostini with topping before putting them in the oven. I wasn't watching and he wasn't generous enough with the topping. Don't be afraid to give each crostini a big portion. It doesn't melt down like he thought it would. Even with a small about of topping, the guests loved it.

This is spectacular! Tastes so so good! I made it once for a girls' night - where we atnad around eating and talking for hours - so I didn't want to assemble and bake as it would be cold. I put it into a small crock pot and kept the mushroom mix warm, then people assembled their own. I know serving in the crock pot isn't the most elegant, but it kept it warm and delicious all night!

Definitely a crowd-pleaser. Topped off with chives and parsley and it looked much better. Also spiked the flavors upward with a dash or two of grated parmesan reggiano at the very end of the cooking process.

I also used the phyllo cups instead of crostini(thanks for the tip). I left out the garlic (we have an allergy in our group). I also used the "less is more" theory with the blue cheese. My guests raved. And this is one tough crowd to please!

at a holiday party this was everyone's favorite item. i used cabrales (spanish blue cheese) and the combination of that flavor with the mushrooms made it taste like there was truffle oil involved, even though there wasn't.

My guests loved these and were fighting over the last few on the platter. I used a fairly mild blue cheese which cut down on the extreme richness other reviewers talked about. In the future I may try suggesstions from previous reviewers and use a goat cheese mixture. All in all, this is definitely a keeper.

i was nervous because i was making this recipe for an italian dinner party. the other guests/cooks were people who lived in and/or travelled to italy on a regular basis, many even speak italian and all are great cooks. i was stunned to discover that this dish was the hit of the party! everyone raved about it and they ate every single one of a double batch. i followed the advice of some other reviewers and cut back on the bleu cheese by 50%, used fat free half-and-half instead of heavy cream, and sliced the mushrooms (i used baby bellas instead of shiitakes) instead of chopping them to improve the appearance of the dish. i also sprinkled chopped parsley over the whole thing. and i did use black truffle oil as well, but i just sprinkled a couple of drops of it onto each crostini. needless to say, i will be making this again and again. i've done a pretty good amount of gourmet cooking, but i've never gotten such rave reviews from such a tough crowd!

Watch the blue cheese - I doubled recipe but still reduced the blue cheese by half - but too strong. Also - found it didnt cook well when doubled cream doesnt cook down well. Next time would make as 2 seperate batches. Will try goat cheese next time - seems to have a broader appeal to people vs blue cheese

Great appetizer! Made this for guests up at the cottage last weekend - they raved about it! As suggested by another reviewer, I cooked the proscuitto with the mushrooms and garlic. This added a nice depth to the mixture. I also used button mushrooms instead of the cremini (they were out of cremini).Will be making it again this weekend. Delicious! Enjoy!

This rocks! Make sure you use a loose 1/2 cup of blue cheese. In other words, don't pack the cheese into 1/2 cup. A light 1/2 cup is best. Do this and you will be very happy. One of the tings that's great about this is it is great to make ahead of time and keep in the fridge. When you're ready to eat, simply spread and bake.

This is so easy, and unbelievably delicious. I am always told that this is what I MUST bring whenever there's a get-together. That's how much people love it. A few tips. I sprinkle with parmesan cheese before heating. This is a great make the night before dish. Pop into a baggie, then spoon onto bread slices and bake the next day. Lastly, I accidentally had to use fat free half and half once, and now that's the only way I make this...it improved the overall creaminess/texture, without the fat from cream.... Oh, as someone else said, I also add about half of the chopped proscuitto to the cooking mix to deepen the flavor.

Rating: 4
This is so easy and so incredibly decadent. I made 2 slight changes: I added the prosciutto while sauteeing the mushooms to cook it through, which also added prosciutto flavor throughout. Also, I added about a teaspoon of black truffle olive oil to the butter... yum! One thing I wonder is if the cream is really necessary. I may eliminate it the next time, for calorie-counting's sake, to see what happens. I will make this over and over, I can imagine it would be unbelievable on pasta or as a topping on a rib eye or New York strip!

This is very good, but very rich. You have to LOVE blue cheese, though. I think I would cut back a bit on the cheese, as it seemed to overpower the mushrooms and proscuitto. Also, this does not make a very attractive presentation; in fact, it's pretty ugly looking. So if you're out to impress, you might want to try other, more colorful bruschetta recipes on this site.

I've made this many times and my husband keeps asking for more. All my guests have loved it, even one who doesn't like bleu cheese very much. I've made this with bleu cheese and gorgonzola. I prefer a strong bleu cheese but both were delicious. Easy to make and can be mostly made ahead.

Yes, the recipe is as good as everyone says it is! However, I had a hard time getting guests to eat it because they thought it looked "weird" (it is not the most beautiful of appetizers). If you are going to serve this, make sure it is to open-minded people. And if you make it in advance, DON'T let anyone see it when it comes out of the fridge - the grayness of it will frighten them away! Once it is reheated and topped with parsley, it looks better.

Well, so far I have already made this recipe 3 times! Start to finish in less than 30 minutes, very quick and easy. Each time I have been asked for the recipe as well. I have made a few moderations that seem to improve the dish....use half and half instead of the cream. Cut back a little on the blue cheese or gorgonzola..have used both and can be a little overpowering. It is very good on the bagquettes, but very filling. We liked it better on tiny one inch square toasts that you can buy in a box at the supermarket. Makes the perfect bite size appetizer. Lastly, I sprinkled them with parmesan before baking....these are soooo good.
