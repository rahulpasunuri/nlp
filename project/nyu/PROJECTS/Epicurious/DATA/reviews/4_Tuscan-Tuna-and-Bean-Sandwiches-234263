This is one of my all-time favorite recipes. I'm not a big sandwich person, but this is a dinner staple in the spring/summer. Also great in a pita or on top of lettuce for salad. Extra yummy with asparagus on the side. As other have said the lemon is a must.

It's decent. I wasn't blown away, though. If you're looking for a healthy tuna-like sandwich like this, I would recommend Alton Brown's sardine avocado sandwich. Just Google it. If you're not familiar with canned sardines, they really taste a lot like tuna. Not too fishy. Just get a can thats half decent... not the 89 cent can. I usually pay about 2-3 bucks per tin. Try it! I always feel great after eating a sardine-avo sandwich!

Excellent recipe to use as a starting point -- it is versatile enough to hold up to changes. I had romano beans on hand, had smoked tuna fillets, and no olives. I substituted the herbs and seasonings also, but I don't think it made a huge difference to the outcome. My teenaged son said it was "really nice" and ate almost the whole recipe at one sitting. The beans make a wonderful substitution for mayonaise. Try it!!

I tossed the bean and tuna mixture together without mashing the beans. With a nice bread and the watercress on the side, it was a more salad-y but equally satisfying meal. Regular water-packed tuna works just fine. Delish!

Let's just say I'm craving it now. A great twist on a classic sandwich...yet I would say this has become a creation all it's own. The lemon is a must.

I really enjoyed this as a change of pace. The bean salad was a super nice complement, and would stand well on it's own. (did add a little chopped celery and red onion to it, but not much.) I made both with parsley, but definitely want to try the basil as well. Light, but filling. Will make again. Whoops! Just read the directions and I made a tuna sandwich with the beans on the side. It was really good so I will make the same way next time.

Very yummy taste combination! Quick and satisfying. Alterations: Had no greens, so I quickly steamed some asparagus. Used warmed naan instead of italian bread. Threw in a slice of provolone for a little somethin' extra. The core bean/tuna flavors are what is key and it is fab.

For extra decadence, we enjoy spreading a nice little layer of mascarpone on the bottom slice of bread. Gratuitous but worth it.

I made this yesterday for the first time and my wife and I loved it.... delicious and healthy! We put a thin slice of sweet onion on half of the sandwich and it was a good addition. Tomato would be good, too, although the original recope is fine. I will probably use tuna packed in water next time, however.

This is excellent! Wow. What a fantastic lunch for an outdoor party. And healthy to boot. I blanked at the grocery store and forgot the onion AND celery.. still absolutely delish. Will make again and again.

Tasty and good looking gourmet sandwich. Next time I would use half the olive oil and garlic, though.

Rating: 4
This recipe is outstanding! It is fantastic as is but even better with an extra Tbs of lemon juice in the beans. I was a little worried that so much raw garlic would be overpowering but it was perfect. (I was mostly concerned with what it can do to your breath afterward but no one has complained so far!) As watercress is usually not available in my local market, I substitute arugula. I've also used lime juice instead of lemon and it is equally as good. This is definitely going into regular rotation on my menu list!

Used the basil instead of parsley (preference) and the overall flavor is a knockout. The beans would even be suitable as a dip for pita chips. Delish!

One of my regular favorites! I never have watercress handy so I omit that, and I use cilantro instead of parsley as I think it adds more flavor. I also toss in a bit of red pepper for an added kick!!!

Rating: 4
This was so delicious! I made the recipie and made half into sandwiches and the other half I made into salad with the tomato, potato, and green bean as was recommended by another review. Both were good but the sandwich won my vote hands down. I will definitely made this again- very soon! I added capers to the tuna part and I do suggest it. It just added a little something extra that I thought was really good. I might also double the bean part just because it was so good and easy. One can just wasn't enough for me.

I was feeling sad because we didn't have much to eat in the house. Staring at a can of tuna, I remembered seeing this recipe... We did not have onions and celery and I substituted arugula for the watercress. I also added a touch of Dijon on the bread. Delicious!

I love this recipe. I make it a couple times a month now. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. I've started improvising and now I add capers and roasted red peppers to the tuna. I've taken out the greens from the beans -- they don't add much. In addition to being very flavorful, it is a great diet food -- flavorful and satisfying.

this sandwich is delicious! we had it for dinner, so we "grilled" ours tuna melt-style using thinly sliced wheat sourdough and added some sliced jack to make it easier to flip. it was fantastic.

While I still love my tuna salad with mayo, this is an elegant option for lunch that I love to introduce to friends and family. I don't like olives, so I omit those and occasionally add the capers instead like a number of other reviewers. Arugula is my choice of green to garnish and is easier to find in my neighbourhood. I regularly place the ingredients on a salad of romaine and arugula with grape tomatoes, haricots verts, fingerling potatoes and drizzle the whole thing with a really great quality olive oil. Yum!

I've tried this with pita bread instead of tuscan bread and sometimes omit ingredients if I don't happen to have them on hand (like olives). Still tastes good and it's a great sandwich to take to work stuffed inside pitas since it's not messy to eat. Good quality tuna makes a difference.

Made this last night, delish ! Did not have olives & celery on hand but it was perfect. Will definitely make again. The key is to use very good tuna and very good beans !

Delicious, healthy, and simple to prepare with modest ingredients. I used flour tortillas to make wraps with the tuna, beans, and lettuce.

This recipe is fantastic. I changed nothing, we absolutley loved it. I made it a second time and used it on top of crostini's and served with a homemade Tuscan soup. The third time I put it on ciabatta bread sliced length wise, did add a little mayo to the tuna this time, added a slice of prov. cheese and put it in the panini maker, delicious!

I was looking for a fresh tuna recipe and this sounded great. Just sliced the fresh tuna to make easier to eat. I would also bake the garlic before using to take that very strong taste out. I didn't mix the fish but kept all but the beans separate to make a bit more kid friendly.

This was a great recipe to make for my parents with health issues. I used twice the amount of herbs, tuna packed in water, and more lemon juice. I served it with the addition of some ripe heirloom tomatoes on whole wheat olive bead and carrot sticks on the side.

This was one on the all-time greatest sandwiches I've eaten. The tuna and bean flavours are so well-suited to each other, especially with the watercress. We used capers instead of olives and it was lovely.

This was delicious. I made it exactly as written. My hubby and I have only ever eaten tuna fish with mayo (sandwich form). I didn't think we'd like this at all. However the ingredients all come together with a really great taste. I will be adding this recipe to my list of regulars.

I love this tuna. I too also use capers instead of olives. Went to a cooking class sponsered by a famous Spanish chef a couple of weeks ago and he made this with the addition of a few anchovies and chopped hard boiled egg. Awesome!!!

Only complaint is that the tuna is way too salty, but I used albacore in salted water, perhaps that is why?

Wow...this was really, really good! I will never make tuna with mayo again. One change I made was using capers in place of olives. Other than that I followed the recipe as written.

Rating: 3
This recipe is almost there. The beans are terrific, but do require a little more olive oil. The tuna has to be made with the best imported tuna-in-oil you can afford and needs to be topped with ripe tomato slices. Even then, it isn't quite exceptional enough for 4 forks. A little more oil, some smooth dijon mustard and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar improves it mightily.

just made this again today for the second time and it was great. very easy to put together with things laying around the house. Like everyone else has already noted the bean dip is great on its own as well. The only things i did diffrently was i left the garlic out of the bean dip just because i do not like the taste of raw garlic. and i also did not use the watercress so i just ended up putting some cucumbers on the sandwich.

Rating: 3
I saved this recipe in my recipe box to make "one day". Today was the day and it was yummy! I did add a bit more lemon juice for more tang but served as an open- faced sandwich, it was great! I added a slice of tomato and some arugula instead of watercress. Can't wait to have lunch tomorrow!

This is the best tuna salad I've tasted and also incredibly easy to throw together. I followed the recipe for the beans and tuna salad as directed, then replaced the watercress with baby spinach in the sandwich. I agree with other reviewers that the bean spread is very versatile- particularly given that it tastes so good and is soooo easy to make- and could be eaten just on its own, spread over crackers.

Rating: 3
The beans alone almost deserve 4Forks (the next day on cracker with Cherry tomatoes. Yum!). I didn' think the tuna was that great. followed the recipe(replacing celery with carrot and upping the lemon a bit) and I found it to be lacking. I couldn't figure out what to add to fix it up. I'll definitely make the beans again.

I love beans and black olives, and this combination was scrumptious. I was a little concerned about adding more oil to oil packed tuna, but it was not an issue. It wasn't too oily or overpowering. I used parsely, rather than basil, in the tuna. My only criticism is that the tuna could have used a little more zing--maybe I should have added more olives or capers might be a good addition. I also only used one slice of bread. This makes a good open faced sandwich. I used artisan bread with sunflower seeds, which was very yummy with this sandwich combination. I'll definitely make this again, and agree that old tuna and mayo combination is no comparison to this.

Wow, what a great combo of flavors. I served this on Calamata bread. Yummy!!

I had avoided this recipe because tuna without mayo sounded dry to me. But my husband convinced me to try it, and it was amazing! The white bean spread adds a lot, and I'd make it by itself to use as a dip. I agree with a previous reviewer that the olives add plenty of salt; no additional salt is necessary. Enjoy!

This makes a wonderfully flavorful sandwich. I increased the lemon to give it some extra zing, but the flavor combination was great regardless. I'd try throwing any italian herb in there next time.

Made this as a very casual lunch for a friend, and she is still talking about it. Made no substitutions. Delish. Even made the bean portion by itself a few days later, and ate it straight out of the bowl with a spoon!

Like another reviewer I mixed all ingredients together and ditched the bread. Omitted the watercress and added diced yellow and orange bell peppers. Used less olive oil and more lemon and lime juices. Also, used basil instead of parsley. Yippie, no mayo. Most outstanding.

This was an awesome lunch. I had some bean salad left over which was made of the same ingredients, different proportions, (it was the bean part of the bean and asparagus salad on this site) so I used that, and I made the tuna without celery, because I don't like it. I had it as an open faced sandwich with a fork, which I highly recommend. Great mix of flavours, and I love the lemon... makes me feel like it's summertime!

This is a great dish. Like the cook from Milwaukee, I made a couple of substitutions...Instead of the tuna, I used steak, and instead of the parsley I used roasted aparagus, and instead of the beans I used some paper-thin sliced potatoes that I grilled, and instead of the olive oil, I used HP (A1) Sauce. With those small changes this recipe was outstanding and I would recommend it to anyone! : )

This came to the rescue when I had odd ingredients on hand and dinner needed to be made. I used rotisserie chicken instead of tuna, and skipped the olives (I should have thought of capers), and it was SO good! It would be great for a ladies' luncheon.

quick and easy, and it tasted great. one thing i'd try next time is not adding any straight salt, because the tuna, beans, and olives seemed to have just enough already.

Forget the sandwich! I put all of the ingredients in a food processor [except the bread and the watercress] and it was a delicious spread on crackers.

I followed this recipe exactly (a rare thing for me) and thought it was delicious. My only minor complaint was that it had less "zing" than I expected, so next time I would probably add more lemon juice to the tuna.
