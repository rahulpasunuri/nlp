This recipe is a conundrum. The Italian word is Sugo - Salsa is Spanish. So we're in for an adventure. One of the other reviewers said that the sauce was "missing something." As I was preparing it, the thing that struck me was: mint. Peas are often cooked with mint, and there's mint in the ravioli. So I added half a dozen mint leaves. With that one modification, this sauce was beautiful. (Next time I'll start with less salt - I thought the salt shifted the bright fresh pea flavor a little to the warm & cozy side.) My wife and I are looking for more ways to use it! (Scallops?) I noticed that the picture had some flourishes not mentioned in the recipe. So I sliced some snap pea pods and a couple of asparagus spears, and cooked them for a couple of minutes in the sauce just before serving it all up. We liked the textural variation.

This is great! The ravioli with the mint and asparagus is beyond compare. I did tinker quite a bit with the sauce. I sauteed shallots and garlic in butter and olive oil, and then added the peas with white wine and broth instead of water.

The egg pasta was very nice, but I was dissappointed in the rest of the recipe. While it had a simple spring taste, it was missing something.
