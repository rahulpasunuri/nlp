I've been making this recipe for two years now using fresh figs from my very proliferative fig tree and canning the sauce. When using fresh figs, liquid is an important issue. I remove the stems and skins, then boil the figs down to reduce the excess juice. This takes a while (for about 80 figs per batch). Also, though using about 10 times the number of figs, I multiply the rest of the recipe by about 6. While the figs are reducing, I make the caramel. I've made this using both caramel and sugar, and the caramel flavor is more complex and worth the effort when I'm making about 15 cups per batch. Sugar is simple syrup (it's called that for a reason), caramel isn't, and you can taste the difference. But dumping everything altogether tastes Just Fine too and if I was making only a small batch for one meal, I'd use the dump method.

I liked the ingredients in this a lot, but I found the recipe unnecessarily complex. Like another reviewer, I think it would be fine just to put all the ingredients in a pot together and reduce the heck out of it. I used white balsamic vinegar because I had some lying around. I also strained the seeds out. I served this warm over a field greens and salmon salad with goat cheese, dried fruit and candied pecans. I had also cooked the salmon in some of the sauce. The basic flavor was excellent, but the recipe itself was a pain. I also think it would have been better with less white sugar and more figs cut into smaller pieces.

This is amazing... I strained out the fig and seeds, and stuffed savory crepes with that, grated gruyere cheese, and thin-sliced rosemary roasted ham. Served the crepes with the strained sauce for dipping. It was a HUGE hit!

I revised this recipe to suit the ingredients I had on hand. I eliminated the mustard. I also threw in all the ingredients together. Served with duck, it was delicious and so easy!

This recipe is a bit fussy, but well worth the effort! I used fresh organic figs and added a final step at the end of pureeing the completed sauce in the blender before serving it warm over chicken breasts. Absolutely brilliant and unique blend of flavors perfect for any meat or fish.

This was pure alchemy. After pouring the water into the melted sugar, everything turned into a hard glass-like glob which didn't seem like it would break down. It took far longer then the 6 minutes the recipe indicated, but it did indeed loosen up. I added extra mustard and a some honey to cut the vinegar some more. I marinated a pork loin some of the sauce and then cooked the sauce down to thicken it more and server it on the side of the pork. Everyone kept ladling more on.

I've actually made this sauce numerous time, particularly when I can get fresh figs, and it has ALWAYS been a huge hit. I've used on ostrich, fish, cornish hens, salad, and even over vanilla ice cream.

This was not a success. Used idea from previous reviewer and served over goat cheese, everyone who tried it gave it a thumbs down. It was very sour. I used good quality balsamic, not sure what the difference from other reviewer. Will throw out the remaining sauce.

I didn't carmelize the sugar. I just dumped everything together and cooked it. This is fabulous and is extra good over goat cheese served with crackers or bread. I've made this to have on hand and for gifts since 3/99
