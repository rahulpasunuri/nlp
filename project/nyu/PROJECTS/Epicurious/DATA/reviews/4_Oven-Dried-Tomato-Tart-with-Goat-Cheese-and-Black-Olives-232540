Used halved cherry toms and whole garlic cloves.Im a vegetarian so used a mix of hard and soft goats cheese which I mashed with the roasted garlic cloves and followed the rest of the reciepe. Only cristism I have is that the puff pastry was way too burnt before the cheeses topping had set peoperly. Does it really need to go in and out the oven so much?

Excellent! I served this tart as an appetizer (12 servings) and it quickly disappeared. I used a half whole wheat/half AP flour crust and substituted smoked mozzarella and ricotta for the cheeses (what I had). It took 50 minutes to test done. I'll definitely make this again.

Just made this and it is great. I used dried thyme. Forgot to seed the tomatoes, which I will definitely remember to do next time, as it made it a wee bit runny. Wonderful flavor. Definitely a keeper

Somewhat time-consuming but absolutely delicious and well-received by all of our guests. Even when tomatoes are out of season, Roma tomatoes slow-dried in the oven are tasty in this unique tart. Freezes well, also. B.J. Harrick

I made 2 of these tarts for a bridal shower a couple of weeks ago-made them with skim milk mozzarella and puff pastry. I cut each tart into 12 wedges- a huge hit! I have made this at least once a year since it was published. I cut Roma tomatoes into thirds and roast them on parchment paper with a drizzle of olive oil. I made the tarts the night before this last time and warmed them, covered with foil, in a 300 oven for ~ 30 minutes. Sometimes I use a regular crust- it's still delicious. I understand the concern about the fat calories and the cream, eggs and cheese, but a sliver once a year is worth it!

Very good recipe. I added prochutto. Also a little warning: No need to drizzle a 1/4 cup over the tomatoes, that'll be way too much. Just drizzle maybe half that. Looks good... Tastes great...I will definitely make it again.

This tart is exceptionally easy and filled with flavor. I took it to a party and it disappeared in minutes with rave reviews. I also continue to make the tomatoes since they are so readily available in the summertime and eat them like candy. I recommend, however roasting them at 250 degrees F for more intense flavor.

I thought this dish was good, but I didn't love it as much as some of the other reviewers. My husband and I polished off the entire tart. But I also did 3 hours of work for a tart that ended up looking like....... a pizza. To cut down on fat and cholesterol, I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used low-fat mozzarella, used half the cream the recipe called for and substituted low-fat milk for the other half, and only used one egg.

ohmygoodness, this is YUMMY! Instead of oven dried tomatoes, we put fresh tomatoes tossed with olive oil and garlic on in the last 15 min. of cooking. Added the olives then too (greek olives). Very pretty, very yummy. Served with green leaf lettuce, feta, and olive oil and garlic and lemon juice. And a wonderful bottle of Cabernet. Will make this again for Christmas Eve.

Definintely not low fat - but extremely delicious! My husband, who is a VERY picky eater, didn't want to try it. He ended up devouring half the tart for dinner. Served it with a side salad with balsamic vinegar and a glass of Savignon Blanc. It's very rich and heavy, yet resembles the taste of a gourmet pizza. The oven dried tomatoes give it tons of flavor. This would make a lovely appetizer at a dinner party. Serve it in small portions.

Very tasty but my crust did not need as much time as the recipe says and I did not watch so it was somewhat too brown which affected the taste of the tart. I made it again the next day and this time I was very careful and it came out wonderfully. I had some imported gruyere so I added that to the cheeses, wonderful!

Looks like lots of people loved this as much as I did. I passed it on to a friend at work and she said her guests licked their plates. She used sun dried tomatoes (in oil for 30 mns)so I tried it that way too - it's faster, different, but still delicious.

I thought this was really good too. I used fresh garden tomatoes and roasted them the day before. Used part-skim mozzarella and skim milk (instead of cream) to lighten the fat a bit. Still tasted great. Also, used a premade regular pie crust instead of puff pastry and pitted calamata olives. The whole thing reminded me of a yummy pizza, complete with crust!

I thought this was a beautiful, delicious brunch dish. It was a great way to use my garden tomatoes. To the reviewer from 9/1 Perhaps you need another hobby. Ridiculing people and deeming them "stupid" because they want to share opinions is simply rude. Personally, I value other people's comments. I'm not looking for anyone to make "culinary decisions" for me. I come here for the advice, and I'm happy to have access to other's insights and experience. If you find this site to be so "below" you then I assume that you have the intelligence to find the exit door (and don't let it smack you on your way out). And please, excuse any grammatical or spelling errors. Or get a "chuckle" out of them. Alas, it seems that I am an idiot. You can have your chortle over a perfectly delicious tomato tart :)

I thought the flavors in this tart were fantastic. The key is to use high-quality cheeses. To the fat police: this is exactly the kind of dish my French host mother would make for me about once a week and we all ate with relish. Never mind the fact that we're all thin and healthy, we know the key to life is to live moderately and indulge occasionally. Otherwise, what's the point???

To those who have complained about the nutrition, I wasted some time and put the ingredients through my Living Cookbook software. This dish, based on 8 servings, is not a heart-attack-on-a-plate, as some have inferred. Calories per serving based on 8 servings: 418; fat: 33g; monounsaturated: 16g. Switch to low moisture part-skim mozzarella and you cut the fat to 29g, with 15 monounsaturated and 3 polyunsaturated. Obviously a great source of calcium, vitamin A (797 IU), not to mention lycopene from the tomato skins. Also, trans-fat free. Indeed, this is one thing I wish would be included in the recipes...at least some of them! I also think that the filling would make a great spread for crackers as an appetizer.

The baked tomatoes had a wonderful flavor. I would definitely use this method again. However, the cheese portion of the tart was overly heavy (and caloric). Next time I will use the tomatoes in a classic quiche recipe with some goat cheese to top it off. I also baked a portion of the filling sans crust for my gluten-intolerant guests and it was still tasty.

Great for a brunch/light lunch. Tomatoes were easy. Using peppered goat cheese (or herb coated) is a good idea which I will try next time. Definitely use marinated olives (I didn't and the flavor of the olives kinda got lost).

This tart is fantastic! Easy too...just put the tomatoes in the over and forget them for a couple of hours. I skipped the olives and used a peppered goat cheese. Definately will make this again!

to quicken and lighten this receipe you can try adjusting as follows: 1) to reduce prep time and avoid the sogginess tomatoes can inflict on the pastry, try simply slicing the tomatoes and layering them btwn sheets of papertowel for ten minutes before adding adding them to the tarte (as opposed to oven-drying), once i discovered this trick my pastry always comes out crispy and the tomatoes are not too dry. 2) to lighten fat/calorie content try using only goat cheese and blend it with some fresh squeezed lemon juice. Adds plesant citrus zing and for many the simple spread of goatcheese on pastry delivers a tasty yet less fattening tarte

In defense of the cook in Stamford, CT, this recipe has over 34 grams of fat per serving (1/8 of the recipe). It also has over 95mg of cholesterol. Not to mention the sodium content. The recipe says light lunch but there is nothing light about this recipe. A McDonald's Big Mac plain hamburger only has 10 1/2 grams of fat and 60mg of cholesterol. Seeing that a Big Mac is a better choice healthwise doesn't say much for this recipe. I'll pass on both.

I made this to bring as an appetizer for a Labor Day BBQ. Instead of a circular tart pan, I doubled the recipe and made it in two rectangular tart pans. (Better for handling.) I sliced it up horizontally and then once vertically, down the middle. I set one out so people could start eating and before I could finish cutting up the second tart, the first one was already gone! I will definitely make this again and am looking forward to the next opportunity.

This was really good. Instead of getting a package of puff pastry, I sliced two extra boiled potatoes (I was boiling potatoes, anyway) and laid them in the bottom of the pan. It was a less rich this way, but still tasty. The combination of potato and cheese flavors is always good.

This tart was amazing. I made it for my boyfriend and the meeting of his parents, and they all loved it. Make the tomatoes in advance for sure, and after that and the pastry baking which takes some time it is a breeze. Simple and fantastic.

Fantastic. I only made a few minor modifications. When roasting the tomatoes, I added fresh basil and a finely chopped 'Hungarian black' chili from my garden. (When grown in my area, the Hungarian black chili is fairly mild.) For the cheese mixture, instead of 1 cup mozzarella, I used a half cup of mozzarella and a half cup of sharp provolone (per altemail from NYC, NY). To the cheese mixture I added some chopped chives from the garden. I took Ottawa's suggestion and spread some Dijon mustard on the bottom of the crust before filling the tart. I plan on using the left over tomatoes in the recipe for "Pasta with Chicken, Sun-dried Tomatoes, Gorgonzola and Pine Nuts". This recipe was so good, it made only 4 servings for us, instead of the suggested 6-8 servings. Note to Cook from Stamford, CT: don't worry, even figured at 4 servings, you are only getting a tablespoon of cream, an ounce of goat cheese, a quarter cup coarsely grated cheese, and half an egg per serving. The good cholesterol in the olive oil and a glass of nice red wine will balance things out. ;-) Enjoy!

Loved this....the tomatoes roasting was the most heavenly aroma! I used half and half instead of whipping cream and it worked fine (I used really good quality cheeses though)... The puff pastry I used was about 8 inches square and I could only roll it out to just under 10 inches...I should have used the whole package but had only thawed out half. I had to do some piecing for the edge so it was not real pretty but still tastey. You may want to thaw the whole pkg of puff pastry just in case. Also..I agree with another poster who suggested making extra tomatoes...we were thinking they would be divine on a crusty french stick with a glass of white wine!

Absolutely delicious. Not to time consuming if you make the tomatoes ahead.

Not sure if I should review this as I made many changes - just followed the concept! I did the tomatoes as written, but for the tart I used a combination of mascarpone cheese, cream cheese, parmesan and cottage cheese as I didn't have any mozzarella/goats cheese or olives. The outcome was really nice anyway :-) ! I reheated it and served it for lunch and it was lovely (though I did forget to pre-bake the pastry and is still turned out fine!). An addition I thought would have enhanced it was some fresh herbs (something like basil) on top.

I have not made the tart, only the tomatoes. My husband loved the first batch of tomatoes which I served with an egg dish so much that I made another batch. I found the second time that when I used the convention oven, lowered the heat to 275 and baked them a bit longer the garlic did not become so hard and bitter. The slower cooking seems to do more for the flavour of the tomatoes as well.

Like many, I've been making this dish for years: a tart with pre-roasted tomatoes and salty cheeses. Good sharp Italian provolone, not the supermild sandwich stuff from the delis, is a good cheese to use too. Sometimes I like to put anchovies and/or capers and/or caramalized shallots on there too. If you do the shallots thing, you can make a little sauce to drizzle over the top before it goes in the oven by deglazing the pan with some dry white. Dry vermouth does fine. Whatever you do though, make sure to remember to keep your stats straight. See, I figure this recipe gets a Positive Basic Fork Coefficient of 12 (i.e., highest fork rating times the number of basic variations you can make) and a Positive Flexibile Cuisine Coefficient of 8 (i.e., highest fork rating times the number of basic cuisines the dish goes with, here southern mediterranean or CA). Now as for your Basic Health Coefficient, well, as many readers know, that's a matter of some dispute. Let's just say you might not want to make this dish in Connecticut. Personally, a little cheese, a little creme fraiche or cream-top plain yogurt as a softner (that's another half point for the PBFC [Positive Basic Fork Coefficient]), it's alot better than that foot long cheese steak with the works and a mixed side of rings & fries I could be snarfing on down at Fat Sal's, you know what I'm saying? Anyway, it's one of the finest tarts you'll ever meet, comes from a good family, I hope you all get along real well.

To the reader commenting about "stats" -many users of the site (myself included) look at the percent who would make it again as a quick way of winnowing out recipes during a search. Many of us don't have time to read the reviews for a chuckle- we rely on the site for recipes and may be searching through several versions of tart recipes looking for the best ones. We rely on our fellow cooks for suggestions/additions/improvements. So when the "stats are thrown off" it does indeed affect those of us doing recipe searches (although I have never seen the comment you describe, it I do admit it could sound a little sniffy). However, I have learned that when a recipe sounds good to me but has poor rating, I should take the time to browse the reviews, because, quite often, people rate the recipe negatively who have never actually made it.

I've been reading comments on this site for years, mostly for entertainment. I like to laugh at the pedantic food snobs and their need for self-aggrandizement. I enjoy the proselytizing of the animal-rights activists. I get a chuckle from the grammar and spelling-challenged folks. I am particularly entertained by the wannabe comics who must believe that their lame and obvious remarks are so clever. The only group of commentors that I find truly stupid, however, are the subset who get so bent out of shape over comments that are not "reviews." Are these people really relying on this website to make their culinary decisions? Have the yahoos who post regularly been given the status of "taste-makers?" Do these people really care that "Kitchenwitch from St. Louis" thinks that recipe X "is a real keeper," or that "Grillman from Long Island" says that recipe Y is "not as good as my Grandmother's version?" The remark from these self-doubting lemings that really makes me shake my head in disgust and amazement is "your non-reviews are throwing off the stats!" STATS??!!?? Are these people serious?

Hello heaven... this was excellent. I loved it. Would I eat it every day, no, but it was definitely a treat. BTW, the CT cook... who obviously isn't really a cook, b/c most cooks will try new things at least once, and not shun them just for calorie-sake. Indulgent, yes... forbidden, it shouldn't be. It's called moderation. I think if you make it, share it with a bunch of people and don't eat the WHOLE thing yourself... god won't strike you dead for having a little bit of pleasure. It's called 90-10... eat healthy 90% of the time, indulge the other 10%. This would be a 10% time for sure, but oh is it worth it. BTW... I am 5-3, 110 lbs, very athletic, perfect blood pressure, perfect cholesterol, and guess what, every now and then I eat stuff like this. GASP!!! Maybe you should just try it.

I've made a variation of this recipe that eliminated the eggs and whipping cream. In order to soften the goats cheese, I mix it with some mayonnaise. Before putting the mixture on the puff pastry, I add a layer of dijon mustard which complements the cheese and tomatoes nicely. Serve a slice of tart with a spring mix salad and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and you have a beautiful lunch.

Made the tart for two different dinner parties over the same weekend, and won rave reviews at both. I cooked the tart about 10 minutes longer than what the recipe stated - until the parmesean cheese formed a nice golden crust. Also cooled the tart a little longer on the second attempt, allowing it to "set" a little better. Enjoy!
