This was excellent with the chipotle meatballs (Gourmet, November 2008), in fact it "made" the meatballs. I added the lime juice to the mayonnaise and chiles.

Great sauce and so versatile. I like it this way on corn with some parmesan cheese, but if I'm serving it as a dip for (sweet) potato fries or veggies, I thin with a little sour cream and add more adobo sauce for a punch. Easy to prepare and always everyone's favorite.
