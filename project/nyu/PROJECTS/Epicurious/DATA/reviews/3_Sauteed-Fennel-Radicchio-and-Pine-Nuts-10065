I have made this dish a couple of times already. Always a hit with my Italian friends & family. I add a dash of white wine to keep it moist before adding the Raddichio

This is just personal taste, but make sure you actually like the bitter taste of both radicchio and fennel before trying this, or any other recipe with these items. I thought it would sweeten a bit, but it didn't. If you like the taste, it is probably a good one.

Since I like to prepare and try different dishes this really caught my eye. I prepared it to serve with some simple grilled lamb chops. It was outstanding. A very different flavor that went very well with the lamb. I will be making it again. It was also very easy to do.
