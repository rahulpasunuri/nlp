I made this recipe exactly how it was written....absolutely delicious....my boyfriend said the sauce was tangy and that it was really good. Will definitely make this one again....on a side note....make your own croutons, it is really easy and perfect the dish. Enjoy :)

FYI -- I tried to do a half batch of the dressing and did not work -- not enough liquid to blend properly. Otherwise it tasted pretty good.

I actually deconstructed this recipe and turned it into a wrap. I used a spinach wrap, put the grilled chicken on it, added the dressing and grated some cheese over it. As long as you use enough dressing (the recipe is definitely enough) it's delicious! I thought the dressing was a perfect version of a lighter ceaser.

Although a classic, this recipe needs some modernizing. It's just lettuce, caesar dressing and chicken. It didn't blow my skirt up. Next time I will try marinating the chicken for a few hours before grilling and then add some flair, like diced red pepper or capers.

I've been making this Ceasar for years in a blender with Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sometimes with egg yolk like cook from Brooklyn. I don't like croutons in my salad, for a healthy version substitute sliced button mushrooms.

This was very easy and quite refreshing for a Spring dinner. It was light and healthy and with good flavor. My fiance' hardly ever eats salad and he sure ate this one.

I decided to try making a caesar salad from a recipe as a change from the very sharp one I have made for years (without chicken) just to see the difference. I really wanted to follow the recipe but realized I didn't have a lemon so substituted 3Tbsp. of wine vinegar. When I finished making the dressing, it didn't seem enough to coat the romaine - I had cut up a huge head of romaine since my store didn't have the bagged type - so I added in an additional 1/4 cup of oil - using corn oil for the additional oil so that the dressing didn't taste too heavy. Lastly, I forgot to put in the cheese!! So, I did change this recipe but the results were so good. It was a delicious, clean tasting Caesar which was particularly easy to make using the anchovy paste.
