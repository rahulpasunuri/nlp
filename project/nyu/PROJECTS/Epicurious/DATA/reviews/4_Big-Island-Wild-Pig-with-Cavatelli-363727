I've been dying to try this recipe since I got my February issue of Bon Appetit, and I'm so glad I finally got around to trying it out. Very tasty, and it got rave reviews from dinner guests. It's not very difficult - it just takes a long time to braise in the oven. I got a 7 lb piece of pork shoulder (with bone in), since we don't have wild boar at the grocery store. I tripled the spice rub, and braised it for 3 hrs, 15 min, turning it every hour, in 5 cups of chicken broth. I had to substitute the arugula with baby spinach since it didn't look great at the market, but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. You're going to want leftovers!

Great recipe! Like the other reviewers I didn't have access to wild boar, but pork shoulder was a great substitute. The braising liquid seemed very spicy and I was worried it would make the whole dish too spicy, but it worked well in the pasta.

I made this for a small dinner party, and everyone just loved it. I used an almost-6-lb pork shoulder (with bone), so I doubled the spice- rub recipe, used under 1/4 c oil, and 2 14-oz cans of broth. I braised the meat for 3 hrs in all, turning it each hour. This made for perfectly cooked, succulent meat that I cut into tender chunks and shreds. My husband at first wanted to eat the meat separately--not really letting it blend with the pasta; but when he tried it as a whole dish, he agreed that it really was better that way. Very flavorful, and LOTS of leftovers--a winning combination. I'd love to serve the extra pork over polenta or farro, or maybe even mashed potatoes.

I used pork shoulder and followed the recipe exactly. It was amazing, tasted like it was served in restaurant in Italy. Will be making this for a dinner party soon.

I like the food so much! I enjoyed eating it while I was doing my dissertation paper. I would definitely try it again if I do have the time!

I really wanted to try this recipe and didn't have wild boar on hand (imagine that!) so I made it with pork shoulder. The pork tasted like spicy, yummy sausage and the goat cheese was a nice, creamy contrast. There was a little too much liquid with the pork so next time I'll try to reduce it and see how it turns out. Very good and hearty!
