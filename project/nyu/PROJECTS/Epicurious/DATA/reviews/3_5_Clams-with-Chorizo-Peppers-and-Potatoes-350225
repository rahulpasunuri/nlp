Made this last night and followed recipe. This dish does not work with the proportions of ingredients listed. 1 1/2 pounds of potatoes is A LOT of potatoes. I can see maybe 1/2 pounds (or 2 potatoes total). With that many potatoes, I had modify the recipe by doubling the clams and doubling the chorizo and increasing wine to at least 3/4 cup. Even then, there was not much liquid left. Tasted good but the potatoes completely overpowered this dish. I would not make this recipe again as published.

We make this frequently, for both starter and main courses. If I have piquillo peppers, I substitute them to make the dish even more "Spanish." They don't need to be cooked so I just add them at the end. Fantastic, easy dish.

I added more (about 40) clams (about 1/4 don't open) for 3 of us and added minced garlic to the addition of wine stage and also added about twice the amount of chorizo and it turned out to be one of the best meals I have ever prepared. I had never even made clams before and they are one of my favorite foods. Focaccia bread is a really great bread to add to this recipe to soak up the leftover juices. Seriously amazing and I would recommend it to anyone, anywhere.

Can't wait to make this again! Such a tasty, perfect winter meal. I had to cook my stew for extra time to get the clams to open, but this ended up working well because the potatoes got a little mushy-er and helped make the dish into a nice thick stew. Amazing with some crusty bread.

Wonderful and easy. Used baby Yukons, 2 links of Goya chorizo and 3/4 cup white wine. The taste was amazing, this recipe is a keeper, can't wait to make again.

This is good, y'all. Elegant and delicious for very little effort. I'll reinforce - don't add salt. Also, crusty bread is key...

The red pepper, parsley, chorizo and the clams create such an attractive presentation of different shapes and colors! The clams and chorizo give a lots of taste, so salt isn't necessary at all. And I love that it's such a simple recipe and easy on the kitchen (no big mess to clean up!).

A great change of pace recipe. Quick to make and most ingredients you have at home just need to get the clams. All made in one pan so easy clean up as well. I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough for a nice dinner for 2; also just special enough for a simple winter dinner party.
