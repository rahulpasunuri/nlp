This is fundamentally delicious. However, the broth separated for me. Considering the ingredients, it's amazing more haven't had this problem. I used a fairly robust lemon, and it was a little too dominant.

This looks good, has anyone ever tried using tinned salmon? I know it will change the flavour but wonder just the same if it might work.

This was delicious! I used fish stock and it was so good.

Ran across this recipe today and I don't think I ever came back to review it - I made in 9/8/09 - and we both loved it. Unusual because my husband is not usually a salmon nor a fish 'soup' fan, but even he liked it. Now that I've found the recipe again, I'll be making it!!

This soup is a regular in our house. We use fresh corn when it's in season, and frozen the rest of the year. We also use 1% milk, not cream, to lighten it up. Definitely makes it more of a soupy than a chowdery consistency, but still delicious. Only complaint is that the white pepper always sticks to the bottom of the pot (we use a Le Creuset enamel dutch oven) and starts to burn before the liquid is added. Not sure the best way around that.

really nice. I started the recipe the night before up to the point where the potatoes were cooked, then chilled it. The next night I added the cream, salmon, and lemon for an fast weeknight meal. Next time will ask to have salmon skinned at the fish counter, because I am unskilled at skinning fish. Used dried dill and frozen corn. Made on stovetop not campfire.

Salmon didn't really help this, my kids liked shrimp better. I added Orizon noodles to it & carrots

Amazingly good, easy and quick to make. It will become a regular dish at home.

Great dish! Simple, yummy, refreshing, easy to make, and easy to clean. I made just a few modifications. I added 3/4 cup of chopped carrots with the celery, and added in a few sprigs of fresh thyme during the boil (pulled them out right before adding the cream). The recipe doesn't specify how much of the 4 cups of stock to use. I used all 4 and the consistency was very soupy, which is what I wanted. For a thicker soup, add more stock and more cream and boil it down before adding the salmon and the corn. Enjoy!

This recipe was very easy and most of the ingredients I hed. I used frozen corn and dried dill.I also used Silk. Would make again maybe this time adding some kind of shellfish so too have a nice fish stock.

WOW I made this last night. I had some cooked salmon fillet left over from the night before so used that, it didn't look enough so I threw in some tiger prawns, that I peeled and made a stock out of the shells. It was GOOD. Will make this again for sure.

Awesome recipe, so tasty. I would only use one quarter lemon's juice. I also added 4 oz. smoked, peppered salmon for a smokier flavor. I also semi-blended it after the potatoes softened, but prior to adding salmon. I used 2/3 C half-and-half, to cut calories and fat down a little. It was plenty creamy with the blending.

Being a born Mainer...I am reluctant to call this chowder. HOWEVER, it was super delicious and my husband and teenage son ate it right up. I made a few subs to keep the fat calories and salt content low. tsk tsk to heavy cream. I used Silk Creamer. I also used Low Sodium Free Range Chicken Stock. The salmon was key. Fresh Wild Caught Salmon....yum yum (benefit of living in Washington). Overall, a fabulous fall stew sans the chowdah guilt.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Used Silk unsweetened instead of cream because of a milk allergy and it turned out really nicely. Will definitely make it again. Added in some warmed sourdough bread and a nice pinot noir and it was a great way to warm up a chilly fall evening.

This was really simple to make and tasted superb! I used leftover cooked salmon and added it right at the end. I added an onion and a red pepper with the celery as I didn't have any corn on hand. The lemon makes it so delicious! This recipe is a keeper!!

Excellent! I used fresh salmon and fresh dill, but substituded frozen corn for fresh, and thought that was fine. Also, I found and used fish stock vs. chicken stock--and I think that makes a positive difference. I recommend the full four cups of stock, and might even add a fifth next time. Hearty and stick-to-your-ribs good!

Was looking for a hearty winter chowder and this one hits the spot. Only change was to reduce broth from 4 to 3 cups. Hubby loved it!

This was a delicious chowder for those of us who don't eat shellfish but still love the taste of chowder on a crisp fall day. Used wild pacific spring salmon, one of the joys of living on the west coast. A good piece a fish makes all the difference!

This chowder was delicious! I changed a lot, though, based on what I had on hand. I used frozen corn and frozen salmon (thawed first of course). I also added about 8 strips of good bacon, which I fried first and then used the bacon grease instead of the olive oil. I added 4 minced cloves of garlic, and increased the veggies by about 50%, even though I had only one pound of salmon--still, the proportions for me were perfect! I ended up using about 3 cups of the broth. I used half & half since I didn't have cream, but in the end it wasn't creamy enough for me, so I added about 4 oz of sour cream (or let people add a dollop into their bowl, that was good too). Didn't have fresh dill so I tossed in some dried dill (don't skip the dill). Do not skip the lemon juice either-- it adds a wonderful fresh taste to this soup. So wonderful, and the leftovers are great too!

The taste was quite good, but I found the texture of this to be more like a soup than a chowder. The liquid was like broth--very thin. Next time I may try to mash up some of the potatoes to thicken the soup.

WOW. Well, I didn't cook this over a wood fire and it still turned out amazing. This chowder had a nice "buttery" taste even though no butter was used. This was very tasty.

This soup ws great!..I made some changes, I did not used fresh salmon, I used canned Salmon ( the one sold at Costco is excellent), but it was delicious. I also used dry dill and evaporated milk instead of heavy cream, that way I reduced the fat content. It was very easy and tasty!

This was fabulous. I added a splash of brandy as suggested, only 3 cups of seafood broth and not even a whole pound of salmon. Delicious!

This recipe inspired me when I read it and the results were excellent! I used bacon fat from breakfast instead of olive oil, a regular onion instead of green, added some garlic, fennel, and paprika, used veggie broth and water instead of fish stock and used 1/2 cup of whole milk and 1/2 cup of half and half instead of cream. I also used less fish. next time -I will cook it longer before adding the dairy, more corn and I won't forget the lemon :)

Very good as is but even better with a hefty splash of brandy added during the last few minutes...Brandy makes any chowder sing.

This was a very tasty recipe though I would have liked for more of the corn flavor to have come through. I will make it again with whole milk next time instead of cream.

Easy to make and very tasty. I used orange roughy instead of salmon, and milk instead of heavy cream and the chowder turned out great. Next time, i'll use a little bit less lemon.
