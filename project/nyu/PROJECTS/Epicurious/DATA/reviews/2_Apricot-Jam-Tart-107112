I also found the pastry very difficult to work with. It was too soft to roll out and I had to press it into the tart pan. Even pressing the pastry into the pan was challenging because it was so sticky. I've made many, many tarts and I've NEVER had such problems with the pastry. In the end, the tart's flavor was lovely and subtle and my guests were happy. But this tart it nowhere near good enough to put up with the problems with the pastry.

I found the dough way too soft to roll out - had to press into pan and couldn't do latttice strips at all. Also, if you try this, don't use the egg wash: with five minutes baking time left to go, the tart shell was almost too dark, even without the glaze.

This is a great one. I have however substituted the macaroons with a thin layer of marzipan or almond paste I make from almond flour, sugar and egg whites. This gives it a more intense almond flavor that goes so well with the appricot jam.
