Very good Ice Cream, a couple of tips: 1. DO NOT USE ground cinnamon (cinnamon is a bark from a tree, and will never dissolve, so you'll end up with a grainy taste. 2. When pressing through the sieve, use a large ladle to press through, and continue to scrape the sides down with a spatula. ENJOY

This is some exceptional ice cream! The flavor is like a non-chemical version of the milk left over after eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch (which is an awesome flavor to have). The crunchy bits of toast set this apart from other ice cream - they're so good that it's tough to let them cool and sit on the counter while you finish the rest of it. One batch is surprisingly small, but it's because even with a sieve, I couldn't recover more than 1 cup of milk after soaking the toasted crumbs. Losing that other 1 cup of milk in the process explains the outcome.

We made a double batch and it made about 1.75 quarts. This was really great in that it truly takes advantage of making fresh ice cream at home: No Haagen Dazs is ever going to have crisp bits of cinnamon toast in it, because it would get soggy after a couple days. So it is a very unusual texture to have as a "mix-in" to your ice cream, and it's a lovely one. Totally worth it just for that, if you're an ice cream lover. Downsides: pushing the steeped milk through a fine mesh sieve sucks, especially if, like me, you only have a tiny fine mesh sieve. We also felt it could have had more depth of flavor, given all the effort. Maybe more cinnamon? Saigon cinnamon might come through better? A little more molasses? Some vanilla? We will definitely make it again, though, and attempt to amp up the flavor. The whole concept is wonderful

Soooo good. Totally worth the work. Mine came out to 1 1/4 quarts. Just delicious.

First off, the recipe is time consuming... that being said, it is one of my top crowd pleasers. I can only manage to make it a few times a year but everyone who has tried it begs for more! It is amazing how all the qualities of warm buttery toast get infused into the ice cream. truly unique and special.

This recipe is a new family favorite! Definitely worth the trouble. The second time I made this I saved some hassle by using ground cinnamon and skipping the first milk boiling. I also only heated the milk before soaking with the breadcrumbs. I only boiled the milk when I needed it hot for the egg yolks. The ice cream came out just as good cutting these corners. I have also made this recipe using both white sandwich bread and an Italian loaf, delicious either way!

Was such a wonderful flavor! Didn't make 1 1/4 quarts for us though... would consider doubling in the future! The toast bits truly did keep their crunch. I usually doctor the seasonings, but I made this one "as written," and it was perfectly balanced. FROZEN CREAMY LOVE! I also ignored the thermometer and used the "path on the back of the spoon" test. This has now been added to the Thanksgiving feast line-up.

YUM!!! Loved, loved, loved this ice cream. I will definitely double the recipe next time. To be honest, I didn't find it too labor intensive, especially for the amazing results. This was gulped down by my nieces and nephews as well aunts and uncles! This has already been requested for future holiday celebrations. And I have to say that I was skeptical about the toast staying crunchy, but it did. Although, there were no leftovers, so I can only speak for it lasting 1 day!!

I noticed alot of people complaining that this recipe takes a long time to make, so I thought I'd help everyone with a much quicker version. (I am the chef at a popular D.C. based Ice Cream Factory). The only reason you really need to heat the milk is to cook the egg yolks and release the flavor of the cinnamon. Two easy shortcuts are to eliminate the yolks (or use pasteurized egg yolks) and to replace the stick cinnamon with ground. Here are the cons: Without the egg yolks, the ice cream won't be as rich, and the ground cinnamon will create a slightly grainy mouthfeel. But this eliminates the need to heat the cream. But if you're willing to make those sacrifices, then go for it.

I thought this ice cream tasted great. I was very disappointed to find after all the work the recipe yielded very little ice cream. Not the 1 1/4 quarts it said.

I forgot to mention that the cinnamon croutons were crunchy for two days after making the ice cream. Hitting day three they were iffy. Day four (with only a little left), they were best avoided as they had gone all spongey and off tasting.

This is VERY good ice cream. It does taste surprisingly like cinnamon toast which is a bit disconcering since it's, well, ice cold. It's yummy though. That said, it really took 2 and a half hours to make (not including the churning). You bring the milk to a boil no less than three times! So, will I make it again? Well, I think I might play with the recipe some. I don't really want to spend two hours hard labor for it. I'd like to see if I could streamline the recipe to some extent but it IS delicious and it won't disappoint. BTW, after putting the bread crumb mixture through the sieve, I ended up with a thick breadcrumb paste (not something that would have come to a boil, or mixed with the eggs) so I added another cup of milk. Worked just fine. Guess I wasn't supposed to push THAT hard on the solids...

OK, so when I mentioned the flavor and that it actually had toast in it I got a lot of groans, however it was a smash hit at the table, the crunchy toast bits are great, now a permanent favorite. One warning though, it does take almost 2 hous start to finish (not including freezing time) so be prepared.

This is the first ice cream I have ever made, and turned out to be the best I've ever eaten. All my guests were happy too. If you like ice cream, you must make this recipe.

This was really great! The flavors were just like cinnamon toast. I froze it for two days and then took it to a picnic. The toasted bits were still crunchy. The only negative was the lengthy prep time.

HUGE hit! really delicious. next time I'd add a little less of the bread cubes as it was a little too crunchy, but everyone loved it
