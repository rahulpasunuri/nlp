An excellent an easy recipe. I've now made it twice--once exactly according to directions, and once substituting acai pulp for passionfruit. The latter was a *huge* hit, particularly given the relative novelty of the fruit (I found the pulp frozen at Whole Foods; I've also seen the juice heavily marketed towards the antioxidant-loving health-food-store crowd) and its taste.

This recipe is fantastic. I used agar-agar instead of gelatine without a hitch. Perfectly light, creamy, and addictive!
