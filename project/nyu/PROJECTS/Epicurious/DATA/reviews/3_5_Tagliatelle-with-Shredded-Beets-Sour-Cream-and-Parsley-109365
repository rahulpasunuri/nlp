Meh. Neither loved nor disliked this recipe. It's a quick, inexpensive midweek meal that uses ingredients likely to be in your fridge. I made basically as follows - didn't love the cayenne - and I usually like spicy foods. Next time, I'd add more beets - I found a lot of the beet flavour was overwhelmed by the sour cream and pasta.

This was a great recipe! However, I followed the advice of some other readers: I added shallot with the garlic and I added horse radish to the sour cream. Save some of the pasta cooking water to add at the end. Very different look and taste!

Added some leftover pieces of salmon to the pasta & some more chili to the beets. Simple, quick, tastfull. Will make it again.

I love beets, and even pasta with dumplings, but listen to some of the other reviews - it was pretty bland. The flavors didn't blend all that well. I added more cayenne to give it a kick, but to no avail. I wouldn't try it again without serious modification.

I'm happy that I needed to get rid of some sour cream because that's how I came across this recipe. It was fast and simple to make. I used garlic flavored linguine instead of tagliatelle,it came out wonderful. I needed some protein though, so I added sauteed prawns. I heated 2 tbls olive oil, added two minced garlic cloves until golden brown. Added the prawns (about 24, 6 per person using the 4 serving suggestion) Cooked about 1 minute on each side, then added 2 tbls lemon juice (from the left over lemon I had). Arranged the prawns on top of the beet dish and it was delicious! My husband and friends loved it. I will definitely be making this again. I'm big into calorie counting, so for this recipe (4 servings) each serving was 430 calories. If you add the shrimp like I did then it is 555 calories. Not bad for a nice dinner. I used regular sour cream, but if you use 'light' sour cream (not reduced fat) subtract 44 calories to a serving.

If you don't like the color, an easy solution is to use golden beets, which I did. I took a previous reviewer's advice and also did a version with grated carrot and leftover shredded beet. Used dill and low-fat sour cream, and it was delicious and attractive!

Great for all tastes... I used whole wheat four cheese ravioli with the beet concoction (needed more garlic for my taste) and it was gobbled up by a one year old and the rest of the family!

Well I modified this a little and it came out really great! I added a chopped shallot to the garlic, added a tablespoon of prepared horseradish to the sour cream, threw in some toasted pecans at the end, and omitted the parsley entirely. Yummy! Will definately make again!

At the last minute we almost got too weirded out to go through with this recipe...thankfully, we did. Delicious, simple, surprising, and oddly beautiful! It was very rich, even though we used less than the recommended amount of sour cream--when I make it again I'll serve it as a first course, rather than a main.

Love it! I used whole yogurt instead of sour cream, it was so good. I used narrower pasta and lime instead of lemon as I live in Mexico and there aren't lemons, didn't seem weird at all. Makes a huge amount so I gave some to my neighbors and they loved it too. They said it was very unique. In a good way.

All of my guests loved this pasta. I thought the color was beautiful. I used low fat sour cream and it was so rich despite being suprisingly low in fat and calories. Delicious!

This is now part of my quick meals repertoire! I used half the recommended amount of sour cream to no ill effect. I have developed a variation that uses carrots instead of beets, sometimes switching the spice to cumin too. A good variation when beets are not in season.

Surprisingly good, once you accept the shocking pink color. Made with roasted beets, thinly sliced and sauteed with garlic, oil, butter. Loved the cayenne and the splash of lemon. My husband loved it and I will make it again.

This is a great beet recipe for cooking beets in the summer (since no oven is required). We've already made this 3 times in the past 2 months and it has a great spicy/creamy taste and a fun fuschia color. It tastes just as good when I substituted 2% greek strained yogurt (Fage), and I liked it better without the lemon juice.

Great and unique way with beets...add a little more cayenne pepper and the dish would be a nice accompaniment to creamy paprika chicken....Made it twice and everyone scraped the bowls....

I made this recipe as is (x4) for a halloween party this past Saturday and everyone loved it! I chose to make it because it looked very ghoulish, and it turned out that way. I shredded the beets with food processor (nice and wormy) and added just half the sour cream so that it would remain even more bloody looking. The cayenne pepper was the perfect addition. Beets are such a beautiful vegetable! Will definately make again.

I ditched the cayenne pepper and added the beet greens (thanks to a previous reviewer), a leek, and dill (about a half cup). We also added a bit of pasta cooking liquid since we like our dishes wet. Yummy.

For those of you that think this is a bit bland or plain, use less hot sauce: Sauté pancetta until crisp, remove, drain and crumble, set aside. Sauté the beet greens in the rendered pancetta grease and set aside. Use less hot sauce and add the pancetta and greens after making the recipe.

Truly weird: A more accurate title would be (a la Star Trek) "Klingon Blood Worms with Lemon and Parsley."

we really liked this dish - it's slightly tangy/spicy and the sour cream marries well with the beets. it may be too pasta-y to be served solo, esp for those looking for low-carb meals!

I love beets, and their color, but I found the sauce of mainly sour cream, with some cayenne (and I confess I used less than 1/2 t. for my family), uninspired.

It may be the very first time I found myself gazing into the dish a few minutes too long before trying the first bite, only to glance up and realize my partner doing the same; Its appearance succeeded in utterly distracting us. Before I say anything about its taste, I must say that if you're cooking for open-minded people looking for a scintillatingly red side dish, or a festive accent to an otherwise bland meal, this is a perfect dish to try. The taste is memorable and exotic, yet you nearly have to close your eyes to enjoy it fully.

Whoa... this dish convinces that beets are indeed an iconoclastic vegetable. The purple/pink was very attractive/extreme, but I would not serve this again as a main dish, as I did.

Is this supposed to be served cold or hot? I ask because it seems like adding all that sour cream would cool the pasta, but it doesn't say to heat through after adding it. Just curious!

This was great! The color was amazing. I will definitely make it again. I enjoyed the spiciness, but if I made it for guests I might halve the cayenne.

The cayenne pepper made the dish quite hot. I'll use about half as much next time. The appearance is a little startling, too. I thought the hot pink with flecks of green was beautiful in a funky sort of way; my roommate said it was "interesting."

Delicious! Just as good or better the second day!

Wow, how easy and different! I love this and have made it several times for a quick dinner just for myself. If you love fresh beets, you will love this. And if you think you don't like beets, try this recipe - you'll be surprised! The sour cream is great, and the dish is so pretty to look at!
