Love this dessert. The nut mixture will run off a silpat/cookie sheet... LOL. Maybe I would peel the pears? And does anyone know where to buy slivered almonds with skins on? Definitely love it!

This is a simple, elegant and healthy dessert. I'm making it again today for the 3rd time - it's what I make when my company likes to eat clean.

This is a great dessert. Easy to make, inexpensive, and really tasty. It's important to spread the almonds to the edges of the pan leaving none in the middle (if you don't, the edges burn and the middle won't toast). You need to watch the cooking times...my pears took a little longer to bake (thus making the sauce a little thicker) and the almonds took way less time than suggested. Watch them carefully! I served the pears with vanilla frozen yogurt. Next time I may add a little nutmeg or cinnamon for added flavour.

I had to cook the pears longer than it called for but they were a hit. My most- requested dessert.

The pears did not get cooked all the way through. The sauce tasted great but I wish It was thicker so that it was more of a glaze rather than a syrup. The almond crunch was not impressive. Overall, I would not recommend this dish.

This was a wonderful surprise. I was looking for something fairly simple, light, and do-ahead for a small dinner party. I had a bit of trouble with the almond crunch. Parts began to burn before all the nuts were toasty brown. But I just threw away the too-dark parts and crumbled the rest up and it was fine. It added a tasty and welcoming texture to the soft pear. I used the mascarpone option, and it was a great touch, especially when drizzled with the Amaretto-flavored caramel. My guests suggested it would make a terrific holiday dessert and I think they're right. I'll probably make this for Thanksgiving dinner.
