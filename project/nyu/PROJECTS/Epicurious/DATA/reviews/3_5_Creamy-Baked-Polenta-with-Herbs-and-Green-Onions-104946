I substituted 2 cups of water with 2 cups of whole milk. Otherwise recipe was as written. Did not need extra time to get creamy. Reheated the next day in microwave for 10 minutes. Perfect and everyone loved it as a nice side with beef tenderloin.

Delicious. I noticed a couple of reviewers commented on runniness, so I added a little corn flour. (I was a little short on cornmeal anyhow.) It was done perfectly at the end of the 40 minutes. The herbs and cheese are just perfect.

Delicious and not difficult. I often make polenta the traditional, stovetop way, but don't season it other than with cheese and oil or butter--it works well as a complement to dishes with sauce or vibrant seasoning of their own. This is the opposite--you can serve this with a roast or grilled entree and make the whole meal more interesting. I served this with a glazed ham over the holidays, and it was great. It did need to cook longer than indicated, although I also doubled the recipe for a larger crowd and can't say proportionately how much longer for this size.

This was so easy. I used grated parmesan and goat cheese for flavoring. So much easier than stirring it in the pot. Be sure to whisk the polenta and water mix when when you first put it in the oven.

Easy and tasty. I scaled down the recipe to serve 2 and it got a little more dried out than I would have liked, but still delicious!

Made this with leeks and parmesan cheese. Baked an extra 10 minutes, which gave it an OK consistency. It was certainly good, but I lost the flavors somewhere along the line. I went a little heavier on the parsley, cream, and cheese, and maybe that knocked out the thyme and lemon. I'm wondering if green onions were the right call like the recipe says, instead of leeks. Or maybe it is what it is. I'm looking forward to the leftovers, in any event.

As a previous reviewer noted, this comes out too runny. I baked for an extra 15 minutes, and it was a little better. Tasted great! The next day, the consistency was perfect.

Super delicious and very easy to make!

This is a tried and true keeper! I took the polenta out of the oven after the 40 minutes, stirred in the other ingredients (I used leeks, not green onions, I also used 1/3 cup of whipping cream rather then the 1/4) and then put it in the fridge. I took it out of the refridge right as the guests came and put it back in the oven for about 45 minutes (it was cold and needed to thicken up quite a bit). It was perfect. So easy!

Very delicious; however, I would have preferred it to be a little less runny. I made it the day before and let it set, but it still was not as thick as I would have liked. Next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will use less water - maybe four- and-a-half or five cups.

This was a wonderful dish. Super easy and can be made ahead as stated by another member. I too used 2 cups of milk to add more richness and used shallots instead of green onions. All of my guests loved it.

This was just wonderful. Though I served it with the Rabbit Ragu recipe from this site, I think it would be lovely with some grilled Italian sausages.

Great way to make polenta if you don't have the time to constantly stir. I sauteed shallots and garlic to add to the polenta and forgot to add the cheese, and it was still very good. Served with seared salmon on a bed of baby spinach and roasted mushrooms because I think nothing goes better with polenta than spinach and mushrooms.

This is one of the better polenta recipes out there. The fresh herbs really enhanced this dish. Next time, I will add one more tablespoon of butter and increase the cream to 1/3 of a cup as I like my polenta a little more creamier. Nonetheless, this was an excellent side dish.

A great polenta preparation - easy and very tasty. As others have suggessted, it can be varied greatly. I often use "left over" cheese of any kind. Texture is very good.

This was delicious! So easy to make ahead of time. The amount of fresh thyme and parsley was just right. Maybe the previous reviewer used dried instead of fresh? Maybe her thyme was just extra strong? One caveat, I could not bring myself to use green onions, so I substituted minced and sauteed shallots. I think that this is deal breaker on this dish. Green onion would be too harsh and the flavor off. I used regular Jack cheese instead of dried. The result was creammy and flavorful. The other reviewers were right about letting it sit for a while to firm up. I made the dish in the afternoon, chilled it, then re-heated. It was perfect under venison chops. The next day for breakfast, it was a hit under soft-boiled eggs!

Love this method for polenta. MUCH too much, thyme, however, in this recipe. Can make all kinds of variations.

This is the best method for polenta I've ever used, both easy and delicious. I use the base polenta recipe and add a variety of other ingredients like spinach or broccoli with cheeses. Try different ideas.

I agree with other reviewers--this dish is far better with leeks (abundant and cheap in this part of the world). It came out perfect and took very little time to prepare.

The first time I followed the recipe. It was good but I didn't like the green onions. Next time I used leeks instead and it was perfect! It got rave reviews at a dinner party for over 30 people. Many had never tried polenta and fell in love with it. A winner!

Unbelievably easy and delicious! I've made this many times, and everyone always loves it.

Simply delicious. Much better than ordinary polenta. I didn't have green onions, so I used chopped leeks instead. The fresh herbs gave it a wonderful flavor. My S.O. had two servings. He thought it was that good.

Very tasty with a nice texture. My toddler loved it too!

I admit I was skeptical, I'd always made polenta in the traditional way. This came out just as good. The herbs and green onions gave it a very nice flavor indeed. The whole family loves it. I used it as a base for a pork, prune and carmelized onion stew..fabulous!

The first time I made this it was very good, the second time I made it I got carried away with fresh onions from my garden which turned out to be too strong - so be warned, use the recomended amount of onions. I will make it again I am sure.

This is a great technique. I used sauteed zuchinni and cremini mushrooms. My husband and six-year-old loved it.

Rating: 3
I really liked this technique too. I agree that it would work with any polenta recipe and will probably vary the ingredients next time. I also noticed that the polenta solidified by the end of the meal which is more to my liking. Next time I will probably make it ahead, let it stand, and reheat it right before the meal.

I really liked this oven method. This is a good technique that could be adapted to any polenta recipe. I used 4 cups water & 2 cups chicken broth for more flavor. Will try grated lemon peel as garnish next time.
