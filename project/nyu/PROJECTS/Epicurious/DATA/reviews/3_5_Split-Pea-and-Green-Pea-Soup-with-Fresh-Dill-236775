I like to do a fairly traditional split pea with ham variation of this recipe. Instead of broth, I start with the ham bone. Boil it, cool it, skim the fat and cut the ham off, use the ham broth then add the ham to the recipe at the end. I do use some bullion cubes for extra flavor and garlic cloves when I boil the ham. Other than that I follow this recipe. It makes for the best split pea and ham soup ever!

I followed the recipe almost to the letter. I decreased the vegetable broth by 3/4 cup since I only had 5 cups, but felt that was plenty of liquid. The soup is fresh tasting and delicious! I will definitely be making this again - I might even try adding my Easter ham bone to it!

Would NOT make this again, wish I hadn't the first time around. Too much dill, and the other flavors were really bland. Waste of money/time.

Oops - it was not water I used, but 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 veg. so 5 cups liquid, and that was plenty, even with increasing the peas to 1.5.

Used 5 cups of water, 1.5 cups split peas, and about 2 3/4 cups of leek (1 large). Tasty - starts with the sweetness of pea and finishes with the freshness of the dill. Definitely recommend for a lighter, hamless, but satisfying pea soup.

I make this for my family on a weekly basis. The kids ask for it all the time. It is simple to make and absolutely delicious. Even when I don't have fresh dill on hand I add loads of dry dill and it does the trick.

This soup takes no time to make and is delicious and hearty! I used frozen edamame instead of the petite green peas. Not only did it give it a bit more consistency, but more protein too!

My husband LOVED this, but I thought I've had better. I blended 3 cups of the split pea mixture with one cup of fresh peas so it was completely smooth. Pretty green color. Added some cumin and cayenne too. I also sprinkled a bit of goat cheese on top with the fresh dill. It blended really well.

Surprising good- I used only 4 cups of water, about 1.25 cups of split peas, some extra frozen peas, and tons of dill. I'd definitely make this again.

This is one of the most memorable soups I've ever had  really! The combination of the savory split peas and the sweet frozen peas (I used flash frozen peas in a bag that were thawed in the microwave - no sauce, just peas) was exceptional. I used about 1.5 cups of split peas and soaked them for four hours which added bulk. After reading the comments here, I upped the peas and used about 5 cups of broth. Instead of a regular blender, I used an immersion blender and blended about half, so the split peas were pretty well blended and the frozen peas and leaks were still whole. Fabulous, easy recipe.

I love this soup. So easy, so additive, perfect flavor balance and texture. I like peas and I like dill. This soup loves them too.

Based on other reviews, I used 1.5 cups split peas and 2 leeks, reduced the dill to 4 TB, and kept the amount of broth the same. I also added some chopped up red pepper at the end of the simmer time to give it some color and texture variety. This soup was surprisingly delicious given the amount of effort that went into it (virtually none aside from chopping the leeks)-- really flavorful, with a nice texture. The leftovers were delicious as well. This is definitely going into our regular weeknight roster!

Simple and delicious though I must say that next time I will use less broth. It was a little on the watery side, but it was still delicious.

it was easy. I only wished I'd had soaked the split peas a little longer. Very good,healthy,and superfilling

This soup was tasty and the dill brought a lot of flavor in the end. I like my split pea soup without meat so I will probably keep this recipe around.

So simple and so good. I caved and added a little bit of ham which worked very well. Also used low sodium chicken broth. The dill puts it over the top.

I did not get a good result at all for some reason. The soup was entirely too brothy; the two cups or so of puree was almost undetectable in the four cups of chicken broth (subbed for veg broth). So the whole thing ended up very watery, not creamy.

Great soup for cold days. I made a few substitutions. I omitted the leak and used 3 cloves of garlic and a medium onion. Instead of the frozen petite green peas, I used a can of drained sweet peas. The dill and the puree added to the soup was just perfect. The dill made this dish. Will make again and wife loved it.

I was attempting to use up some items in the fridge and pantry. The split pea soup seem to fit the bill except it did not seem to be that exciting based on the recipe. Being practical and using the items won out over my perception and I was really glad. This soup is fantastic and so tasty. My wife asked why I would make split pea soup without a ham bone. After tasting the soup and before having a second helping, she answered her own question saying she now understood.

I doubled the recipe, added garlic and shallots, mixed two types of broth and only used a little oil. It was very nice and very easy!

I cut back the olive oil to 3 tablespoons & used a medium onion instead of the leek. Also substituted chix stock for the veggy broth & deleted the frozen peas. You may want to cut back on the fresh dill by @ least a tbsp.

Simple yet delicious. Puree gives soup a velvet smooth texture and green peas add color and flavor. Used chicken broth, and substituted less quantity of dry dill and tarragon for the fresh dill.

A really nice, hearty, simple soup. The dill works surprisingly well.

Very tasty. Skipped the dill.

Used Parmigiano Reggiano butter to sauté the leeks, and chicken broth for better flavor. This soup was really lovely!

Thick puree of powerful pea and dill flavour, which worked well together. Used chicken stock rather than vegetable stock, which I think resulted in a better flavor.

I did not puree all of the fresh peas. It gave the soup extra flavour and substance. Definitely liked by all. Excellent recipe.

Healthy but lacked substance. Would rather try new recipes than make this again.
