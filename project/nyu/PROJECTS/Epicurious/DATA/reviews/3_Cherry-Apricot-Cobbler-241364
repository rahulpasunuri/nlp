Just wanted to add that whisking dry ingredients evenly distributes leavening & salt into the flour. I recommend sifting baking soda, powder & salt into flour, then whisking to avoid lumps, & uneven leavening. I prefer fresh seasonal fruits to reconstituted ones. Try making this in the late spring :)

I thought this recipe turned out great. Instead of whole milk I used 3/4 reduced fat and 1/4 heavy cream. Also, I soaked the apricots in the cherry water from one of the cans for about 10 minutes. I served with cinnamon dulce de leche ice cream. It was a hit! People asked for more.

The first reviewer suggested the instructions are incorrect regarding whisking of dry ingredients. This is a common step to take with the dry ingredients of a recipe. The purpose is to remove lumps without having to trouble oneself with sifting. The recipe is not in error.

We liked this a lot. The only change I would make is to add a little ginger rather than allspice and bake it in an 11x17 pan for a little more depth.

The first 5 ingredients are filling, with the remainder for the topping. I have a friend that can not have flour so I substituted the topping floor with ground almonds. Also for the dried apricots I soaked them for a good 40 minutes before I cut them up with scissors. Also I substituted heavy whipping cream for the milk in the topping. Everyone loved the dish and I have three people ask for seconds.

I didn't have any trouble with the liquid, I drained the canned cherries but they still gave off enough juice to be bubbly. Didn't enjoy the flavor imparted by the allspice, would probably skip that in the future and rely on the fruit flavors.

The instructions lead you to believe you will have lots of juice bubbling after 50 minutes. But how can you when you have dry fruit and are asked to entirely drain the water from the tinned cherries? It's ok but very dry. Next time I'd use a smaller glass dish and maybe play with different fruits.

This recipe went over pretty well, although there were no raves. It is a good pantry recipe, in that it can be made with no perishable goods other than what you can pick up at the convenience store. Please note, however, that the recipe instructions are incorrect and should be fixed. I'd hate to see some newbie cook trying to whisk flour ;)
