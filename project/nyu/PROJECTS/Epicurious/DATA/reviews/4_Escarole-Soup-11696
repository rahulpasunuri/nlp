I wouldn't say excellent, but a solid "very good" - I added some red pepper flakes for some kick which was nice.

Excellent. I added more egg whites for extra protein and it was delicious.

Fabulous! Perfect! This is going into my arsenal of fall-back recipes for sure....can't wait to do this for a dinner party. I used the Snow Day Menu and my husband adored this soup and the Bibb salad with garlic-butter dressing. I would have doubled the amount of the tiny pasta.

This is one of our favorite soups and I have made it many times. If we are going to eat it as a main dish, I occasionally add turkey meatballs. Either way it's great. The only thing that I do differently than the recipe is that I add two well beatened raw eggs at the end and swirl them in, let the them cook a minute or two and then I add the cheese. The raw eggs add richness and body to the soup.

Easy and delicious. The escarole really adds flavor to the broth.

I made this recipe because I was bored. Everybody loved it! I added little meatballs to it and it was awesome. Now my sister in law wants me to make it for my nephews christening!
