So good. Made on stove with grill pan. Best burgers I've made inside, ever.

Good idea for burgers with a bit of a difference. After reading these reviews I cut the very sharp cheese I was using into squares about 1 1/2" square and 1/2" thick, and molded the burger mixture around them. I lightly floured the outside of the finished burger and chilled them well to help them hold together for the barbecue. Some minor problems with cheese leaking at the very end but otherwise pretty good. It inspired me to make a batch of meatballs mixing grated parmesan in with the meat as well as putting a small cube in the middle - -excellent. Can never have too much cheese!

Even though I, too, had a messy cheese issue, I would make this again and be more careful assembling the burgers. The recipe easily doubled although, for personal tase, I would add a little less onion. Good, clean flavor. This recipe is a keeper.

A creative way to add more cheese to my burger!

Awesome and easy to prepare. Next time we will try blue cheese. Lots of possibilities with this recipe.

This recipe and the reviews inspired me to use the idea to make cheese stuffed meatballs. I added some finely chopped garlic, some fresh breadcrumbs and an egg yolk to the meat mix, then formed balls, pushing a cube of cheese inside each one. I chilled them for half an hour before cooking them and I had no cheese leaks. Taste great with or without pasta and kids love 'em!

so good. i used pepper jack cheese, cut into small chunks. i added a bit more seasonings, some hot pepper. it was delicious, perfect summer fare!

When I make them again, I would likely use a little less Worcestershire. Otherwise they were great.

Last night I made 28 patties with this recipe for an impromptu end of summer party. They received rave reviews even from those that were not hamburger eaters. These will become a staple for our grill. A food processor is a must for the large quantity though! I cut back on the onion a bit, too. We had an assembly line of stuffing. My husband made loosely shaped patties and my neighbor and I stuffed. She stuffs a lot of breads and things and she suggested we start from the center of the flat side of the pattie and form a large well (almost a basket), fill with cheese, fold the sides over, pinch together and pat and gently toss with light hands to form the pattie. It really worked well, went fast, and no cheese leaked on the grill.

Instead of trying to form a hole in the patties and covering it back up, I made 4 thin patties, put the cheese on one and sealed with another. Added crumbled cooked bacon to the meat for an extra flavor treat.

We are not hamburger eaters -- in fact, we couldn't recall the last time we grilled hamburgers in the 20 years we've lived here. That will now change. These hamburgers were awesome, and no doubt this recipe will become a barbecue standard at our house. Even my 16 year old daughter ate three -- without buns, of course. One concern was that we used a mere fraction of the cheese called for, so we must have done something wrong. The recipe calls for "dividing the meat into two sections" and stuffing with cheese. That didn't make a lot of sense to us, so we made two equal sized balls of hamburger, stuffed each with cheese, and then married them together into a pattie. One note: we didn't use the English muffins, but instead substituted Pepperidge Farm whole wheat buns with sesame seeds that were terrific. A+ overall!

Just watch out! The cheddar will probably leak out onto your grill/bbq and make a mess. Just be prepared for the cleanup! I tried to use less cheese to prevent the "fallout" of cheese, but it still didn't help. I found it easier to split your burger ball into twos and flatten both sides. Dig an indentation into the larger of the patties and insert the cheese. Then cover the patty with the remaining patty and seal it. This way, the cheese will stay inside the patty when you flatten it out.

Wonderful "burger" recipe...used lean ground beef and added some chopped garlic then BBQ'd on charcoal grill...easy and delicious

I am usually not a big burger fan but these are great. I made them exactly how the recipe said to. I have had many repeat requests from my family to make the burgers again and again!

This was terrific!!!! Wasn't sure you could improve on the basic burger, but I'll be doing these from now on. However, I'm skipping stuffing the cheese, as you can't put too much without it falling out. I'll put it on top instead. Also wasn't sure I'd like the English muffins, but again, it was a nice, unexpected change. Delicious!

I thought it was so-so, but a friend at the BBQ described it as "orgasmic". Certainly a nice and easy change from a simple burger. Needs more zip...very sharp cheese, lots of garlic, maybe double the worcester sauce

The cheese fell out on me, too. I would make these again, but more carefully, to keep the cheese inside. (I didn't think that I did a horrible job of it, but it fell out anyway.) We also added the rest of the cheese as a topping. I wasn't too impressed with the taste--it seemed rather bland, so we'll be dressing it up a little more next time. But this seems like a good basic starter.

I'm converted. Until now, I've been a purist about hamburgers: nothing but beef in the patties. But these were really great, and not at all complicated. Even easier if you use a food processor to chop the onions and parsley. Didn't have enough red onion, so I mixed it with Vidalia, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Everyone loved this fabulous variation.

I used pepper-jack cheese instead of cheddar for an added bite. Not as difficult to make as I expected.

Good, but added garlic, hot sauce and Dale's Marinade to add flavor. Left out the onions and used onion powder instead. Could do without the parsley. Topped with left over shredded cheese. Served with grilled corn with lime butter and grilled zucchini and squash....great summer meal.

these burgers made me the hit of the bbq. I used a stinkier cheese, like gorgonzola i think it was. I also added minced garlic to the mix. They were awesome and needed very little in the way of condiments or toppings. I bet pickled red onions would be nice on top.

These were great. A nice break from regular burgers on the grill. I had no problem with leaking cheese.

Used a grill pan instead of a BBQ and these turned out great, although I, too, had problems with the cheese leaking out a bit. Not a big deal, just made for slightly messier clean-up. Couldn't fit the amount of cheese called for into the burgers, so sprinkled some on top. Will be making these again very soon--yum!

I had the same problem with the cheese dripping out (only on one of the two burgers). I will try to be extra-careful to mold the burger meat around the cheese. I also added shredded cheese on top of the burger--never can have too much cheese on a burger!

THis was very good considering the fact that if you overcooked the burgers, they wouldn't end up all dry in the middle, but if you like cheeseburgers, put some more cheese on top of your burger. It needed more cheese.

Made these with "Bacon and Molasses Beans" (really good, found on this site). Didn't have a problem with the cheese which i shredded very finely, however the burgers were a bit bland. I'm going to try these again adding more spice to the mix.

This was delicious!!! I made these burgers according to the recipe and I had no problem with the cheese leaking out....they turned out just perfect! Would recommend these burgers to anyone! Try them!

I've made this twice and it has come out great both times. Delicious dish.

I thought this easy,tasty and moist. Had no problem with cheese because after reading other comments, I decided to use diced cheese instead of grated. It was less work, melted more slowly and didn't run out.

The burgers were delicious. If closed tightly enough, the cheese will not leak out. The cheese just melts in your mouth. It is a keeper.

I just made them and they came out great. I was careful to put the cheese in the way center and seal it all around, using the finger method. Also made sure the grill was very hot to sear it. I also minced the onions really fine. The cheese started to drip out a little bit at the end. I'll make them again!

Very tasty. I used both methods for getting the cheese in the burger--one burger stuffing, one burger w/ two patties--and found the stuffing method worked better.

The two-patty approach suggested by the NJ chef works much better than the directions. Also, substituting granulated onion makes the meat mix less likely to crumble and leak cheese, especially if the burger is carefully shifted soon after being placed on the grill.

The concept is good. However, in practice the cheese leaks out during grilling and doesn't have a cheese flavor as a result. I've tried it twice with the same results. Disappointing.

They're tasty burgers but no matter how careful I am molding the meat, the cheese leaks out and flares up the bbq.

Delicious recipe! These are my new favorite burgers!! Sometimes the cheddar drips out into the grill so keep your eyes on them!

A good burger. The mixture was quite moist and kept falling apart when I tried to "poke a deep hole". I found it easier to divide each portion into two patties, putting the cheese on one patty then topping it with the other patty and pinching the edges tightly together.

Absoulutely wonderful. It's so easy to make and incredibly tasty.
