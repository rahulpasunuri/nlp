Tried this recipe for thanksgiving and it was a hit. Made a few tweaks after reading reviews. Don't know if it made a difference but here is what I did and it came out delicious. Used two cans of black beans and one can of white beans. I also used a second can of pumpkin puree. It still tasted mostly like bean soup but gave it a hint of pumpkin that other reviewers found lacking. Also, between those two changes, the color of the soup was orangish/blackish and didn't look disgusting like other reviewers complained. I also did not use cumin, but added a splash of chili powder and nutmeg. My husband tasted the soup before and after the addition of the sherry vinegar and personally preferred it without the sherry vinegar. My guests all loved it! Will put this in my permanent recipe file and would make again.

This is now in the winter rotation menu. Tasty, good for you and very satisfying. Enjoy!

I cheated and just cooked all the ingredients in a crockpot together, then pureed at the end-- it turned out really well. I followed the suggestions in many reviews about not adding ham. Next time I might also follow suggestions to add more spice (cayenne or chipotle in adobo). Great with sour cream and cilantro garnish. Will definitely make again.

Been making this for about 10 years - one of the first recipes I found on epicurious. We've modified it a lot over the years - here are our suggestions: We skip the shallots (just use more onions), use 1 T only of cumin, use 1-2 T of olive oil instead of the butter, chicken or veg broth instead of beef broth. Originally, we substituted turkey bacon for the ham, but then omitted in completely without much loss. We add 2-3 t. chipotles in adobe sauce and that lifts the soup to another level. Also, we usually use an immersion blender to puree the soup at the end rather than blending the beans & tomatoes at the beginning (much easier). If you still want whole beans in the soup, use a slotted spoon to scoop out a bunch before you puree. Our version is easier and healthier (and spicier) than the original; make it 2-3 times every winter and we never fail (kids and adults) to appreciate its greatness!

This soup was served as a first course for our Thanksgiving dinner this year (2011). It is such a delicious soup that I immediately asked for the recipe. I will make this soup often because it's the perfect comfort food for the winter months.

I made this for a Halloween pot luck party and served it in a pumpkin tureen. I made it exactly as written and it is very good and pretty easy to make. You can't really pick up any pumpkin flavor though. I guess all the ingredients just melded well. The sour cream and toasted pumpkin seeds are a must. Chopped cilantro may also be a nice garnish as well.

Lovely, complex taste and very easy to make. I left one can of beans whole for a chunkier texture,and sub'd balsamic for the sherry vinegar. The ham didn't add much in my opinion, and I might leave it out next time.

I originally received this recipe from a friend who saw it in Gourmet magazine. It always gets 'wow's' at diner parties and people always have seconds. It also makes a lot! Sometimes I add a fourth can of beans at the end and keep them whole. It stretches it a bit more and makes it chunkier.

I can't believe I have been making this recipe since 1996. It is the first soup that is made every fall. Originally I had no ham so I made it without. I reduced the sherry vinegar to 1T. That is how I ALWAYS make this sensational recipe!

Lovely soup. I made several alterations. Fresh cooked acorn squash instead of pumpkin. No shallots, Sherry, ham, or Sherry vinegar. Vegetable stock instead of beef broth. Did everything else the same. So filling - wonderful comfort food. I'm looking forward to trying some of the suggestions from other reviewers as well, just to mix it up a bit.

Rating: 3
Definitely substitute WHITE beans for the black!! I had been hesitating making this until NathaliePDX suggested it. I toasted 1 tsp whole cumin in the pan first, used a masher on the beans only, 1 can of petite diced tomatoes w/ chiles, , a heaping tsp of chipotle in adobo puree, a mixture of stocks. No butter (canola), sherry, ham or vinegar. The smokiness & heat from the chipotles was excellent. I bet this really rocks tomorrow! Don't worry about exact measurements- the recipe is a starting point.

I'm eating this soup right now for lunch & LOVE it with the tweaks I made to the recipe. I did not have shallots, so I increased the onion & doubled the garlic. Added 2 drained & rinsed cans of corn. Used 2 c. beef stock & 2 c. chicken stock. Added a quart of half & half and seasoned with Tapatio & cayenne pepper to kick up the spice.

I've made this every fall for the last few years. From the beginning, I made several substitutions: I use white beans instead of black--helps with vile color--I sub fresh roasted pumpkin for canned (no brainer), I deglaze the onions with Chardonnay instead of sherry, and finally, I skip the ham. I guess all this makes a completely different soup. It's pretty tasty, though. :)

This didn't work well as a vegetarian recipe at all. The sherry was overpowering and the color and consistency of the soup was gross.

Rating: 3
I considered altering the recipe before I made it (less cumin, no ham) based on what others wrote, but I didn't. I made it as is. So based on that, I can say 1) the cumin is fine. Whoever said it was overpowering must be sensitive to the taste of cumin. 2) the ham is worthless. Yes, it goes great with the soup, but 8oz is barely noticeable for a soup that yields 9 cups. Either increase or don't bother. 3) Pumpkin soup? You might as well call this bean soup. You won't notice the pumpkin. 4) Great soup, but like I noted, it's bean soup. Nice flavor, especially if you let it sit overnight or longer. Next time I'm looking for a bean soup to make, I'll consider using this recipe.

We don't eat much beef or pork in our house so I made this with part chicken stock, part half and half. Roasted my own pumpkin and used part fresh stewed and part canned stewed tomatoes. Added a hint of cinnamon, more cumin and salt and finished with wthe white wine vinegar I had in the cabinet. The flavor done that way is just GREAT!

This is really a good soup. Will add more spice next time, though. Having a field of pumpkins, I was glad to find a new use for this good veggie.

Great! We serve this frequently on ski and hiking trips. I don't get too worried about proportions of the various ingredients, it all works. I leave about 1/3 of the beans out when I blend it and I leave it reasonably chunky. Garnish is cheddar cheese. Low(ish) fat, healthy, mostly able to make it from the pantry, quick, and always great. What is not to love.

This is an unusual and delicious soup that I would absolutely recommend. I did make two changes to the recipe: First, I used turkey bacon (four slices) instead of ham. Second, I substituted red wine vinegar for sherry vinegar, because it turned out I didn't have that. Still, it turned out great!

i made this today, wanting to use some canned pumpkin i had left after the holidays. it was great and my friend loved it too. i was out of cumin, so used garam masala instead and it was wonderful. i think the additional spices included were perfect. I also decided to add a can of light coconut milk - it did not make the soup creamy, but did give it a nice mellow note. i also added a sprinkling of red pepper flakes. will definitely make again. i think it would be good with any poultry, white fish, or shrimp, instead of ham, if desired.

This soup was amazing. I used pancetta instead of hame and sauteed it with the onions. Then I used vegetable stock instead of beef stock and topped it with plain yogurt at the end. It was delicious and I would definitely make it again!

The black beans dominate in this recipe, so if you're looking for a pumpkin soup, better try another recipe. With a dash of nutmeg, though, the soup is pretty yummy, especially with the ham. Appearance-wise, though, it's bland looking with its all brown color. Maybe with the sour cream garnish it's okay. Not the prettiest soup.

I make this all the time - it's simple and tasty, and the sherry and vinegar really makes the dish. One of my guests ate 4 bowls in 24 hours, including a bowl for breakfast the next day! Excellent whether vegetarian (I use veggie stock, don't drain tomatoes, and increase the onions and garlic to boost flavor) or with ham & beef broth as written. I really enjoy it with one more can of pumpkin to bring out a little more pumpkin flavor and achieve an even more velvety texture.

Rating: 3
very nice and easy. you could make this on a weeknight for sure. I would leave out the ham next time as I don't think it really adds anything but some meat to the recipe. very nice with pumpkin seeds and sour cream though. I wouldn't leave that detail out. It will be made again at my house.

Rating: 4
Very well balanced and delicous recipe. I used 2 tbs of cumin, and I think it should have had a touch less as the recipe calls for. I did not have ham, so added some pancetta as I was sauteing the onions and shallots. The sherry and beef broth add important flavors. I used 3 tbs of sherry vinegar as the recipe calls for but I think 2 would have been better. Delicious soup. I will definitely make it again. Very healthy as well, incorporates 3 "superfoods" (i.e. tomatoes, black beans, and pumpkin).

This sounds like one of those recipes that can take a certain amount of adaptation and still be delicious. On a snowy MN winter day I made it from a previously baked and frozen white pumpkin. I had no shallots, no unsalted butter, no ham, no sherry or sherry vinegar, no garnishes and one teaspoon of sour cream. It was fabulous with my changes, which included white wine, red wine vinegar and plain yogurt. After I first tasted it, I couldn't wait for it to cook the 25 min. I had two bowlfuls. It really is bracing and wonderful.

Loved it! I used only one can of beans though, because I am a secret bean hater. Didn't drain the tomatoes, only 2 c of broth. Also, to my dismay, i was nearly out of cumin, so i subbed all kinds of chili powders I keep on hand for a Mexican spice rub i like to make. I used a small amount of olive oil, 1 c pumpkin from our Halloween jack-o-lantern. Also, to help make up for the lack of cumin, i used about 1 tsp of the Tabasco jalapeno sauce and 1 tsp of their chipotle sauce. Served it with a spoonful of cilantro pesto on top and plain whole wheat quesadillas on the side. Delicious on a cold rainy nite.

Delicious soup, and super-easy to make. Especially if you use the cuisenart to first mince the garlic and shallots, throw in the onions to dice and then just wipe it out for the beans and tomatoes. I had 2 cans of black and a can of kidney beans and it was great. To make it vegetarian we used veg broth and skipped the ham. Served with some cilantro, cheddar cheese and hot sauce - awesome!

Delicious, chunky, complex: this one's a winner that holds up to one's own (reasonable) changes. I started with dry beans and ended up with only about 2 1/2 cups cooked, but kept it at that amount. Had a small pumpkin hanging around, so I steamed that and scraped and chopped what I needed. And like many other cooks, I used all onion (no shallots on hand this time). However, I did use a local beer (Furthermore Fallen Apple, a cream ale brewed with apple juice) in place of the sherry, and lime juice in place of sherry vinegar. The ham was Christmas leftovers, and isn't it fun to make a few slices go a long way? Overall, this soup turned out complex, yet somewhat subtle, and the health benefits packed into one bowl are outstanding. Made a batch of cornmeal scones (sparked with cayenne and cinnamon) to accompany. Perfect.

This was delicious! Being a vegetarian, I used vegetable stock in place of beef. I had no shallot so did all onion instead and no sherry, used white wine. I added the ham to my boyfriend's portion only and omitted the vinegar. He raved over it! Served w/crusty sour dough bread--this was a great meal for a cold Sunday afternoon.

I agree with other "one-fork" voters -- the cumin was overpowering, and the pumpkin faded completely into the background. And the combination of flavors never really "married" into a scrumptious whole. I didn't want ham, so I omitted it. Maybe that was the problem, but I couldn't see how 8 ounces of ham was going to save this soup.

Made this last night, as a change from my favorite Black Bean & Chorizo soup on this site. Spouse and guest loved it. I thought it a schoche bland. Made it as per directions, except for subbing balsamic vinegar for sherry (I didn't have any) and extra onion for the shallot (mine were unuseable). Next time, I'll omit the vinegar (couldn't see that it added anything to the flavor), saute' the onions & garlic in EVOO, as I thought the butter flavor out of place with the cumin. I'd also add crumbled bacon instead of the ham, as I couldn't even taste the ham. And my secret ingredient for a wonderful bean soup - 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves. Possibly some Tabasco sauce, also. But I loved the consistency and the ease of the soup, as well as the fact that I had most of the ingredients on hand. I think a good honey jalapeno cornbread would be a nice side with this.

This was very well-received at the soup luncheon after Good Friday services. It was a perfect soup for this occasion because it has depth of flavor, is relatively simple to prepare, can be made ahead of time, and is easy to transport. It would also be great to serve at home. I awarded four forks for versatility as much as for flavor. Instead of canned black beans, I cooked dried black beans (which had been soaked overnight) and also used canned tomatoes with green chilis instead of plain canned tomatoes. Otherwise I made the recipe as written.

oh my, was this a surprising winner! "Wowsers!", as DangerMouse used to say. i was completely unprepared for how delicious and complex the soup turned out to be. my only prior experience with using canned pumpkin (other than for baking) was in a MS/EL enchilada recipe last year, and it left me with the clear impression that the pumpkin has, basically, zero flavor. turns out this is not the case, but i've also since learned that not every can of pumpkin tastes identical. i was determined to try this because any recipe with 160+ primarily positive reviews here over the years is certainly worth a go, but also because i have a sweet potato and black bean soup recipe that is to die for, and thought this would falter by comparison. (wrong) i had major misgivings putting in all the cumin, a truly huge amount, imo, but in the end it was not at all overpowering. there are so many other flavors that come forth, including the sweetness, whether from the pumpkin or butter or both. the tomatoes come through, too. i did my best to stay true to the recipe, but had to make a few changes: 1) did not puree beans & tomatoes, but did smash one can's worth by hand with a fork (i like my soups with texture); 2) used Better'n'Bouillon Vegetable base/broth; 3) omittted ham, because a pre-finishing taste test saw no need for it. 4) used only 1/2 tsp. salt, and it did not need any at table, nor pepper -- a truly rare experience.

Try this soup-it's easy and really delicious.I have been making this every fall and winter since I first found it in the magazine. People always ask me for the recipe and can't believe there's pumpkin in it. It is not the most appealing looking soup but it is hearty and delicious when the weather is cold. I sometimes substitute wine or port for the sherry but you really should use something. Also don't leave out the vinegar before serving. Use what you have. It gives it a nice little tang. The sour cream garnish is also very good if you have it around.

Mmmmm, I'm eating the leftovers right now! I was a little skeptical at first with the pumpkin, but like another reviewer said, you can't really taste it. It does, however, add to the wonderful texture and gives it a nutty sweetness. Left 1/3 of the beans whole for substance and used 3 cups veg broth instead of 4...also did not use ham. I don't recommend trying to skimp by w/o the sherry -- it plays an integral role. Put several dashes of tabasco on mine, which I think was absolutely essential but the heat-phobic husband disagreed. He filled his soup with crumbled cornbread and deemed it "unbelievable."

Great recipe! Exactly what I was looking for in a black bean soup. I love that it has ingredients that are so healthy ie. pumpkin- high in anti- oxidents as well the black beans. I omitted the ham and bacon and did not miss them at all. I also used chix stock instead of beef and it was great. I added a few chiplotes for a bit of smoked flavor and then removed them before serving as my husband does not like spicy. This will be a staple this winter in our home! LOVED IT!

Excellent soup! I used 2 black bean soup cans from the Goya section, an entire can of tomatoes, and tripled the amount of cumin and pepper. It turned out great! Perfect for a cold rainy day. I would also suggest adding 2 T of cayenne for those who like it a little extra spicy. I omitted the vinegar since I didn't think it was needed. The only thing that surprised me was that I didn't taste any pumpkin at all. But it still is delicious.

I LOVE this soup!! Perfect fall comfort food. I followed the recipe completely, but omitted the ham. I followed the advice of one cook and added chipolte peppers. YUM!!

First made this recipe a couple of years ago and it has become one of our winter staples. We always have canned pumpkin in the house now. Following some of the other reviewer's suggestions and our own proclivities, we have made the following changes. No beef or ham - we made it at first with turkey bacon, but decided to try it without and never missed it. We used veg or chicken broth (depending on our audience) instead of beef broth and omitted the sherry (but not the vinegar). Instead, we add the chipotles in adobe sauce - what an intense, spicy, smokey flavor! We've been using them for years for our homemade, long simmered salsa and have discovered they are a magic ingredient. Anyway, they soup as we've adapted it is truly marvellous and doesn't miss the delted ingredients at all.

Absolutely delicious! Loved by adults and teens alike. I followed others advice -- I used chicken broth, used more tomatoes (Rotel style) and did not puree all the beans or tomatoes to give the soup more texture. I did not add the vinegar, because it was so good without it (but the Sherry is a MUST!). I also did not use any ham or bacon. An extremely flavorful soup and easy to make. It freezes well, too. I will make this as standard fall-fare.

Fabulous twist on the common bean soup recipe. The sherry and vinegar really set off the flavors. I have cooked it twice and both times got rave reviews.

I really thought this was a waste of ingredients. Made just as written except didn't puree totally smooth, left a little chunky.

This was OK, but not really great. My kids weren't enthusiastic at all, and the adults thought it was so-so. I made it pretty much as the recipe said with minor taste adjustments. I MUCH prefer the Brazilian black bean soup recipe from the Moosewood cookbook - now that is a true star! Everyone always compliments me on that one and any leftovers cook down into a great dip.

Rating: 4
Rarely do I rate a recipe 4 forks, but this is truly special. I have been preparing this soup since it was published and is usually the first hot soup to be made in the fall. It is truly wonderful. I have made it both with the ham and without and it is equally supberb. Serve it with a crusty bread and a great salad.

I *love* this soup. And this is the only way to get it, now. Larry's has made it vegetarian, and not only cut out the broth and ham, but also the sherry vinegar, and sherry. Ruined it, IMHO. Their new version is just another bean soup. Just another *boring* bean soup. The original was a *spiritual* experience! ;o)

This is a GREAT wintertime soup! Followed other reviewers' suggestions and used a 32oz. can of pumpkin and left 1 can of beans whole. Have made with sliced hotlinks (yum), mild italian sausage and smoked beek sausage. Make the whole recipe and freeze 1/2 for later use (if it lasts that long.)

I made it without the ham, using chicken broth instead of beef, so my vegitarian daughter would eat it. It was quite a hit with her and my meat-eating husband.

Great way to use Christmas leftovers: ham and butternut squash, which I subsituted for the pumpkin. Also added some sundried tomatoes and one chipolte pepper to the bean puree. Used beer instead of sherry and white wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, both due to a blank spot in the pantry. I also cut way down on the amount of butter.

Yum! I used Andouille sausage instead of ham to give it a little kick. I was out of sherry, so used cognac (1/2 the amount), made it very rich & delicious.

Rating: 3
Loved it! I added an extra can of pumkin hoping to get more of the pumpkin flavor to come out. It didn't work, but did make the texture much more creamy. I left one of the cans of beans whole to add texture, but sometime will make it with all the ingredients pureed. I also could not find sherry vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and that seemed to work fine. I will definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
Excellent! Pretty much stuck with it as written, just doubled the tomatos (and made 'em Rotel,) plus upped the ham and added some boudin and cilantro from the fridge. Thanks to the sherry, there are some complex tastes going on there in the end!

excellent,although I made only one-third (a one person household).Since I do not eat pork,I used smoked chicken instead,which went very well.

Okay, I just now realized that I totally forgot to add the sherry. It was delicious nonetheless and got rave reviews. I'll try adding a little sherry when reheating the leftovers.

Rating: 3
Since I had only 2 cans of black beans, I substituted one can of white. Taking the advice of others, I used my immersion blender for pureeing, after sauteeing the onions, garlic & shallots, leaving one can of black beans "whole". No ham in the house, so I substituted some slab bacon -- I fried the bacon (diced) first (with a teenie bit of EVOO - the bacon was extremely lean), removed the bacon and sauteed the aromatics. After all remaining ingredients (except the vinegar) were added, I put the (drained) bacon back in. I can't find sherry vinegar ANYWHERE around here :(, so I used 1T balsamic and 2T red wine. (the vinegar reminded me a little of lime) Just scrumptious!

I've made this recipe three times. The first two times I halved everything except the spices and the tomatoes and thought is was wonderful. Last night I finally made it as written and I'm not that happy with it. I would suggest an even ratio of tomatoes to pumpkin, and up the cumin a bit, perhaps even adding some coriander or fresh cilantro. A good base recipe, but needs to be tweaked a bit.

Rating: 3
This is a great version of black bean soup. We were out of canned tomatoes so we use Rotel. This added the perfect amount of spice and extra flavor. We also used chicken broth instead of beef. We served it with cilantro and sliced avacado. It will be added to our recipe box!

Great soup, and really easy for a mid-week meal. Don't let the "pumpkin" concern you, it's a regular black bean soup. My husband was shocked when I told him (after dinner) that it had pumpkin. I used the ham, and thought it was yummy.

I liked this soup, but without the changes I made, I'm not so sure. I didn't puree in the beginning, I left it until the end and did a few swoops with the emersion blender. I added about 10 oz of frozen corn, a large sweet potato (microwaved for a couple of minutes to soften up), I skipped the vinegar and ham and added a few tablespoons of Franks Red Hot...I found it needing salt, and the hot sauce did the trick. Very hearty and filling, added some diced chicken breast the next day to my bowl along with some shredded cheddar--what a meal!

Loved this soup--my whole family did!! I replaced one can of white bean for black. I only used one tablespoon of cumin. I did not use ham at all. Also, I used chicken broth, and water, instead of beef broth. I added one cup more of the broth. The kids are always excited when we have this soup!!

I've made this soup several times now and it has become one of the fast, tasty, basic recipes in my soup repertoire. Just love it. Can be put together in 30 minutes. My changes - used 2 cans black beans and 1 pinquitos, 1 can diced tomatoes, added a bit of cayenne pepper, chicken broth instead of beef, used 2 T olive oil instead of butter and skipped the ham, salt and vinegar. Yummy, easy and healthy. Great for during the week. Pureed the whole thing in my Cuisinart with steel knife.

Rating: 3
I switched out the ready canned beans and used a 10-Bean dry soup mix (Buckeye Beans) instead without the seasoning packet. I had to greatly increase the simmer time because of the dry beans plus I felt that it needed a lot more pumpkin so I doubled that ingredient. It was a hit at Thanksgiving and well worth the extra cooking time.

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful wonderful soup. It has such a unique flavor and I could taste the pumpkin. It is very subtle but still there. As much as I loved this though I will not make it again because it gave the the worst heartburn I have ever had in my life. Great soup but be forwarned if you have a tender tummy.

Rating: 3
Wonderful fall/winter soup. After reading earlier reviews I decided to just barely puree the beans and the tomatoes to get a slightly crunchy texture. It worked well. I added only 1/2 the salt and found it still a bit too salty. Otherwise, a super soup we will have again.

Wonderful, earthy and satisfying.My husband turned up his nose when I told him the name of the soup. Pumpkin did not interest him but he had come down with a miserable cold and felt much much better after eating the soup. The kids loved it also. Definately a keeper.

I have made this recipe four times now. I puree only 3/4 of the beans and do not puree the chopped tomatoes at all. For even more textute, I cube the ham at 1/2 inch. The last time, I served it with a dash of Tabasco and grated Parmesan cheese on top. WOW!

This soup has become my seasonal favorite. I have made this soup every year since it was published in 1996. It marks the beginning of autumn for me. It is wonderful for those casual evening dinners with friends. Just add a salad, wonderful bread and a great glass of wine.

This was great!!! I used 5&1/2 cups black beans to use up the whole bag. I used 1&1/2 lbs ham, 2 small onions,1 can tomato sauce instead of tomatoes, and apple cider vinegar (it was what I had...). My husband raved on and on about it. I served green onion tops and sour cream as optional garnish. Really terrific fall meal. Next time I'll probably leave about 3/4 cup beans whole for texture.

Rating: 4
Superb even though I altered slightly. Used mix of butter and olive oil to saute onions, etc in (often do this with no problem). Had dried beans, so soaked overnight, then simmered with bay leaves and beef stock, pureed this, then added other ingredients less the stock. Used more pumpkin like others and had only med. sherry on hand (used a bit more than called for, accn'dg to taste), as well as no sherry vinegar so used a cider vinegar. Also skipped the ham but would work well with chorizo or like hearty sausage. Still turned out well. Topped with chopped cilantro and drizzled sour cream. Since was thick, used some of the soup next day in lieu of refried bean mixture for some tortillas and was excellent as well.

Oh my god, this soup is so good! This may be the first recipe I've given four forks. I just made it with leftover xmas ham, two cans of beans (one whole), 2.5 cups of beef broth and no sherry. I can definitely taste the pumpkin, and the cumin gives it an awesome earthy taste. I have cilantro and Tabasco ready but I don't think we'll need it, it's perfect right now. Okay, I have to go eat.

Note that this is a Black Bean soup with pumpkin, not the other way. And the pumpkin is wasted because you can't taste it in the end. It took a great deal of time to make. It tasted good, but I wouldn't bother again expecially with all the sieving and transfering of ingredients.

This recipe has also gone into our "keeper" list.

My husband (a very picky eater) and I loved this soup. This one is going into my "favorites" book immediately! Out of necessity (a bare cupboard), I used 2 cups of vegetable broth and 2 cups of beef, only 1 can of black beans and 2 cans of White Northern white beans and did not use the Sherry vinegar. Also cut the cumin back to just one tablespoon, but I would do it exactly the same next time, because it was great. I won't use the salt next time, though: there is plenty of sodium in the canned broth already. A sour cream, cilantro and tabasco sauce garnish is absolutely necessary and the perfect finish.

Not knowing if we would like this soup and having a half can of pumpkin left from making the pumpkin bread I decided to cut the recipe in half. Used one can of black beans, but 1/2 of everything else. I did not have any sherry wine vinegar so I just left it out, as well as the pumpkin seeds. The soup was outstanding & I will make it again and definately have some toasted pumpkin seeds on hand as I knew it was missing something at presentation and upon tasting, knew it was the seeds. Great winter fare!

I made a vegetarian version of this soup and it was a big hit. I substituted vegetable broth and vegetarian bacon (instead of ham) and left one can of beans whole.

Pumpkin soup has always been the traditional first course for our Thanksgiving dinner, whether cooking at home or away in the kitchen of a good friend. I do as much advance prep work as possible, and always make the soup the night before. While I have a particular fondness for anything with black beans, this dish failed both the taste and eye-appeal tests with my husband and teenage son. Fearing it would go over badly with our guests as well, I rushed out to the market for more canned pumpkin to whip up our favorite pumpkin soup from 21 Club (Gourmet, 11/95). This is always a huge hit, and works superbly with 3-4 cans of prepared pumpkin instead of the ordeal of starting with fresh. (The dog and I enjoyed the original batch of soup throughout the following week).

YUM

I found the IDEA of black bean pumpkin soup more exciting than this dish. It was quite good, but I agree with some other reviewers that the cumin and black beans overpowered the pumpkin. I should note that I didn't use the sherry or ham, so maybe that affected the outcome. If I hadn't sprinkled the top with toasted pumpkin seeds (very tasty, btw!), I might have forgotten that this soup contained pumpkin and though it was chili.

Rating: 4
This soup was wonderful. Even though I somehow forgot the onions?? I did take cues from some of the other reviewers and made the soup with bacon. I used only 1 tbls. of cumin. I didn't have sherry on hand and I think it probably would give the soup a bit of a punch, as I found another recipe of mine for black bean soup that also called for sherry. My kids even liked it!

Rating: 4
This soup was the hit of my dinner party enjoyed by several cooks I would consider a gourmet cook. The only change that I would make to the recipe is I would use 1 tablespoon ground cumin instead of 1 1/2 tablespoons. One guest described the soup as "dynamite". I would agree.

This is a lucsious and beautifully colored soup for fall & winter.I used dried beans(soaked first)and didn't puree anything.I personally wouldn't use shallots for this because of the strong flavors of the other ingredients;onions work just fine.Also, sherry vinegar is nice , but certainly not essential -however the addition of the sherry adds a wonderful flavor to the soup.I double the recipe since it freezes very well.

Living in Lima, Peru there are no canned ingredients available! I soaked and cooked 500 grams of black beans and processed with 5 diced, fresh italian plum tomatoes and I cooked fresh squash. Results of using fresh ingredients were well worth the extra time.... As another reader suggested I substituted 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar for the sherry vinegar and reserved 1 cup of whole beans - otherwise ingreditents remained the same! My husband is not a pumpkin fan - he didn't even know it was in the recipe!

Not that my review will make any difference(look at all those reviews!), but this is great! My husband made me throw away my other black bean recipes and replace them with this one alone. We omitted ham (because I personally don't like it, but I'm sure it gives it a nice flavor) and added shrimp (as to have a one pot meal). We left one can out when purreeing and added it in later so the soup was chunky. Yum!

I made this recipe for lunch today from ingredients I had in the pantry. Like other readers, I left one can of beans whole.

This hearty soup is very tasty and I may, in fact, make it for Thanksgiving. I modified it, however, by reducing the beans to two cans and reducing the cumin by 1 teaspoon.

I made this soup for the first time on a cold, rainy November day, and it was just the thing to eat while sitting curled up under a blanket with a tray on your lap and the remote in your hand! I left out the ham in an effort to cut down on the fat, and I didn't bother with the pumpkin seeds. It's very flavorful, and I am planning to make it again tonight now that it's become cold in the DC area once again. It was very easy to make, and it's one of those things that if you were having people over, it would be a good seasonal dish or starter. If you were going to serve something else with it, I would suggest a beef dish because of the intense flavor.
