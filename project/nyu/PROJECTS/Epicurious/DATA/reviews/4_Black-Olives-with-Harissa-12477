Made the Harissa sauce for a rub for some beef (did not use olives). I have not had Harissa before but this was FANTASTIC and would look no further for a harissa recipe. I used dried ancho chilies. This would also be great on pork or chicken.

Didn't have a pepper, so substituted 1 Tblsp paprika and some hot sauce. Still great.

I find that the oil-cured olives are better with harissa than green ones. I used chiles de arbol and added an extra one for a bit more heat.

Not rating this dish just putting my 2 cents in. I've had this as a salad/app. with orange segments and sliced red onion which was very nice. I personally like this with the spicy olive mix from Whole Foods because of the medley of flavors and textures.

Have been waiting to find a source online for the olives, as there are no Middle Eastern markets to be found in Wyoming. Gave up and made this with plain old canned black olives and both bell and hot peppers from my garden yesterday. This will be my newest food addiction I think! It is very flavorful and so delicious! Have eaten the olives, have spread it on bread which I then dipped in herbed tomato & garbanzo soup and am loving every bite! My only alteration was to littlely toast the spices before grinding them. A lady from India suggests it makes the spices more fragrant and tasty--it definitely does.

Haven't tried it yet, BUT for an ancient 87-year old, the processor is not only a time saver, but it also saves my energy!

I had a tube of harissa which I promptly threw out after tasting this yummy recipe. I served it in the giant mortar and pestle I used to make the harissa with and it was a big hit with my house guests and my husband. I've never used my mortar and pestle this way and it was really gratifying once I got the hang of it (makes a very different texture than processor.) Like kneading bread you can use this to vent any frustration!

Fantastic! And very pretty. I was a little short on oil-cured black olives, so I used a few jalapeno-stuffed green ones. Very good. The harissa mixture is tasty; I will use it again on other things. These were pretty, here in the month of Halloween, with the orange of the Moroccan-Style Carrots (in the Epicurious recipe file).

We served this to friends from Africa and they complimented it's authentic flavor. We loved them and they will be a frequent condiment in our household from now on!

Many years ago my husband and I holidayed in North Africa, and fell in love with harissa. I have rediscovered it again in your recipe, thank you. It was delicious. I remember in the hotel it was used to fry eggs in - it was called something like "brick" ??.
