Delish! Like other reviewers, I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for white flour; otherwise, this recipe is easy to get great results. My family gobbled up the entire platter of these scones in a flash. BTW, my favorite dried cranberries are Kirkland brand from Costco.

First time making scones, came out very good. I didn't follow the recipe exactly and they came out wonderfully. I substituted creme fraiche with yogurt, I also used fresh fruit (that's what I had). The end result was two different flavors, lemon black-raspberry with almond and orange strawberry with almond. Moreover, I used a little less butter and sugar then called for and I substituted half a cup of all purpose flour with whole wheat flour. Very Tasty, will have to make them again for sure!

Easy to make and quite tasty. They do not rise at all in the oven so be sure to pat them out to the thickness you want prior to baking. Wonderful change from orange!

Amazing! They taste perfect they look perfect. They are a beautiful breakfast, as well as, a go-to bake gift to give. With GE Profile gas oven I found they needed 20 minutes of cook time to brown.

Fantastic and quick. This is the first time I've made scones and they were perfect.

Very Tasty and quick! I blend all the ingredients in the food processor and then turn the dough out onto a boad to knead. This makes them even easier to make.

I really normally don't like scones unless I am drinking a huge cup of coffee with them to distill the intense dryness, but this recipe produces infinitely more moist scones that my family and I could not stop eating them. They are a super comfort food that can be made year-round.

First time making scones and they turned out lovely (soft and light texture). Would use a bit more tangerine peel next time as I could not taste it at all.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Having made scones moistened with butter and yoghurt/buttermilk for years, thinking it more traditional, I was skeptical about the addition of egg. Now that I've made this recipe and tasted the excellent texture, I'm likely never going back to the old way. So much lighter, but still not cakey. Otherwise, the flavors are nice. I didn't have cranberries, so used the tangerine flavoring plus walnuts, and the flavor was tasty. As others have said, the dough would be a good base for any other scone flavor combination.

Rating: 4
These came out wonderful! The scones are very light and tender - much better than a lot of other scones I've had. I'll definitely use this recipe again and maybe try different fruit for variety.

Rating: 3
These are very good scones. I was pleased that they lived up to the rave reviews. The recipe easily serves as a base for any fruit combo you can dream up - blueberry / lemon, apricot / almond, etc etc. The dough combined easily and was easy to knead and shape. Baking time is pretty accurate so watch closely.

I followed the directions exactly and I'm a pretty good cook so I can't explain why mine didn't turn out as well as other reviewers'. I much prefer the moistness and texture of the Raisin Scone recipe on this website. I only substitute chopped dried pears instead of raisins.

It's key to soak the cranberries in hot water (drain thoroughly) before using. Really plumps up the cranberries.

I have made these several times using orange juice and zest instead of tangerine. They are always a hit. I agree fully with the reviewer who said, "these scones could cause someone to fall in love with you."

Rating: 4
These scones could probably make somebody fall in love with you. They're mindblowing, easily as good the best I've had in proper bakeries. The texture of these scones is incredible, lighter than usual but crumbles well. For me, it was just a touch sweet and I will try slightly reducing the sugar next time. But I thought the tangerine flavor was just right, unlike some other reviewers, even as I was a little light on microplaned zest.

Rating: 4
Loved the recipe. I used orange peel and juice as that is what I had on hand. I kneaded fresh cranberries (roughly chopped) into half of the dough so I had both orange scones and orange/cranberry scones. Both were liked, but the orange/cranberry won the prize. This recipe is very versatile. I would love to try lemon blueberry scones. I bet a handful of chocolate chips/chunks would be good for those who like orange and chocolate.

Rating: 4
Now and forever -- the very best scone recipe. I often substitute orange for tangerine -- still delicious, have also done a lemon-dried blueberry version that works as well. Unlike the other review, I think cutting the butter in with your hands makes all the difference. A true winner!

Rating: 4
Delicious and very fast. If you use a pastry blender (v. your fingertips), you'll get a better result.

Rating: 4
These were exceptional! The scones were light, with just the right crumb. I doubled (or more) the tangerine zest (zesting 1/2 with a fine microplane and 1/2 with a medium.) The resulting flavor was still subtle - delicious, but subtle. The scones have the right amount of sweetness to stand on their own or work well with a nice jam. We served homemade raspberry jam on the side (for our second scone!) and it worked nicely. You could easily adapt the recipe to use different fruits (lemon and blueberry, for example). DELISH!

I am a physical therapist at a nursing home and we have a cooking group every Friday. If my little old ladies can make these scones amazing anyone can!! They were light and very tasty. We used regular sugar on the top, but that was way too sweet with the strawberry jam we served with them (homemade of course). I would suggest if you prefer more of an orangy flavor use an oil based orange flavoring used for chocolates. Just a little will do. We used orange instead of tangerine with excellent results. Two YUM's up!!

Very easy to make and DELICOUS! I used dried cherries in place of cranberries.

Rating: 3
These are delicious. Lighter texture than a typical scone. The combination of cranberry and tangerine is scrumptious. Disagree with those who say there isn't enough tangerine flavor --- I thought it was just right. I microplaned the peel off of 4 tangerines which gave me just a bit over 2 tablespoons. I also diced the cranberries up a bit (as suggested by others) -- good move, helped distribute them evenly through the scones. I used creme fraiche -- readily available at stores such as Whole Foods. I would really recommend sticking with tangerines rather than using oranges. Note to Stumbler: Baking Soda and Baking Powder are not really interchangeable. You can substitute Soda for Powder but you need to add an equal measure of cornstarch and twice as much of cream of tartar. Use about 1/4 the amount of baking soda as the recipe calls for baking powder and then scale the cornstarch and cream of tartar accordingly.

Rating: 4
These are delicious! I do agree that there is not quite enough tangerine flavor...maybe I didn't add enough of the peel. I would like to add additional cranberries also, maybe using fresh berries. My boyfriend loved them also. They make a great breakfast for a fraction of the cost of Starbucks!

Rating: 4
Incredible breakfast treat! I brushed the scones with leftover tangerine juice along with the butter to give the scones a more pungent orange flavor. I will definitely make these again.

Rating: 4
I have to disagree with the last reviewer - yogurt changes the texture of these scones quite a bit. I make them with sour cream all the time but tried using plain yogurt today. That melt-in-your-mouth quality of these scones is from the sour cream. Lately I have been substituting fresh cranberries for dried (and adding a little extra sugar) - I do like them better with the fresh berries.

Rating: 4
These are delicious. I make them all the time. I use a 1 full cup of cranberries and I substitute lowfat yogurt for the sour cream. You can't tell the difference.

Don't listen to the reviewers that talk about the subtle orange flavor. The scone recipe is perfect. The use of additional orange juice is going to cause the scones to have the wrong texture. Plus it covers the subtle flavors of the cranberries and creme fraiche (sour cream). I've used the recipe just as listed several times and it is terrific. It turns-out the perfect texture everytime whether you are a good baker or not. Great recipe! I highly recommend it.

Delicious! Served as part of Mother's Day brunch, and they were a big hit. Substituted orange juice and zest for tangerine and used salted butter since I had it on hand. Turned out great and will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
Excellent combination of flavors. They are rich but not overly rich. (The ginger scones recipe on this site is more like dessert - not that I'm complaining!) Anyway, if you're looking for a pronounced tangerine/orange flavor - use o.j. out of the can but make it very concentrated. That works well.

Rating: 3
I thought the scones were scrumptious- but the tangering flavour was indiscernible.

Rating: 3
I thought these scones were good...but not as yummy as the ginger scones on this site. That said, they were pleasantly light and not too sweet. The only change I made was to use half cornmeal instead of plain flour. Personal preference, as I think the combination of corn and orange is very nice!

Rating: 4
This recipe needs more citrus flavor. I tried it again after my first time. I know I did not use tangerine, but I used a LOT of OJ (about half a cup). It was TOO subtle with 2 tbsp of juice. Be very liberal with the citrus!

Rating: 4
I was very apprehensive about this recipe as I have never baked before. I used navel orange instead of tangerine. I had no zester or grater and just made tiny peelings of orange skin using a veg. peeler, plus a little lemon peel. I used 4 tbsp of juice instead of 3. I used baking soda instead of powder. I had no sour cream, so I mixed 2 tbsp of plain yogurt with some buttermilk. I used blueberries in place of cranberries. I refrigerated the dough for 5 minutes before baking. I had no idea what it meant to "fork and toss" the dough as I "gradually added" the egg. My dough was a sticky messy lump (NOT smooth) for some reason, so my scones were misshapen glops when I put the dough on the baking sheet. I cooked them for 11 minutes at 410 degrees. My rack was very close to the top of the oven. IT STILL TURNED OUT GREAT. It certainly wasn't because of me! You just can't go wrong with a stick of butter in anything! The batter tasted great too! 8 pieces from the dough is too big. I made 10 and they still were plenty big and dark brown on the edges, even before the insides were done. Other than that, perfect...and I can't complain considering my inexperience.

Another delicious scone recipe from epicurious. A great scone to serve at an autumn brunch. I used orange juice and they were still great.

My husband and I agree; these were the best scones we've ever had. So far from the typical nasty dry hockey puck masquerading as a scone, these were more like a crunchy, light muffin.

I used orange juice/peel instead of tangerine and baked for 18 minutes instead of 12 (they were still anemic at the 12-min point). This got a "very good" rating from my husband, who is a big fan of scones on Sunday morning. This recipe is a keeper!

My whole family really enjoys these scones. These scones are time consuming but well worth it. I have made these scones for at least 3 years and will continue to make them. When you find a winner stick with it. It is a perfect treat to make anytime. The only difference I triple the recipe.

A little bit time-consuming to make, but worth it, especially for a special occasion. Delicious, distinct flavors of tangerine and cranberry blend with luscious butter and sugar to make a tender scone.

Rating: 3
This was my first attempt at making scones, so I followed the recipe very closely and had great results. They're delicious! I took another reviewer's advice and chopped up the dried cranberries and I also used sour cream. The only problem I had was at the kneading stage the dough was very gooey, so I just sprinkled the top with extra flour and that helped a great deal. Has anyone else had this happen? I will make again for sure!

Rating: 3
This is not a scone; this is a rock bun! Rock buns have more fat and sugar than scones do. No wonder...much juicier. They are meant to be eaten plane, without cream or butter. So enjoy them as much as you can( I do as well), but do not compare them to scones!!

Rating: 4
ONG!!! These were fabulous. I followed the recipe EXACTLY! Thanking the poster who "chopped her cranberries for better distribution"..I also used my food processor for the dry ingriedients and butter..and then used a bowl to incorporate the rest. A tip that I use is when I add cold butter to flour in a food processor I gently coat before I process the butter so it does not stick to either the bowl or blades...and I did this with the cranberries as well. I used tangerines. What sold me on these was the ability to freeze them. I plan on wrapping two together and giving them out before our guests leave to go home from our New Years Party.

This recipe is fantastic and pretty easy. My husband, who is British, called them Rock Cakes (not exactly an appealing name) but he flipped over them and can't wait to make them again. Yum, yum, yum. Serve warm with butter.

These scones are delicious. I made them for my mom for Mother's Day and she loved them. I had a hard time getting any peel from the tangerine, so I used orange, but used tangerine juice as called for. I will definitely make these again.

I agree with the most recent review -- dried tart (not Bing) cherries also work very well in this recipe.

I was looking for a tangerine recipe since I have a tree full of them and have gotten tired of just eating them by themselves. I used dried tart montgomery cherries instead of cranberries because I prefer them and the scones turned out delicious. The tangerine is very flavorful in this recipe. The only thing I think I would do differently is use a bit more sugar because I prefer a sweeter scone. I also took the advice of another entry and went to Starbucks, purchased some coffee and snagged some extra raw sugar packets.

Rating: 3
Have made this twice, first time threw in some fresh cranberries because I only had a small amt of dried; it was delicious. Used tangerine ce but orange zest as I couldn't get enough zest from my tangerines. They popped with flavor. Second time used only fresh cranberries, maybe should have used a bit more sugar on top this way. They're so delicate this way, with none of the chewy dried fruit. Also made it with orange instead of tangerine second time, and regular sugar as opposed to raw. All good.

Used regular sugar and it was great.

I know many posters hate it when people do this, but I actually made the orange-cranberry scone recipe (also on this site)--because I had buttermilk and not sour cream--but made it with tangerine. The result was fabulous. The tangerine definitely has a "sweeter" aroma and flavor.

Rating: 3
A great source for the raw sugar in this recipe is one packet of "sugar in the raw" snagged from the local coffee cart or Starbucks. Very yummy for treat for guests.

Rating: 4
Phenomenal taste and texture. These disappear with frightening speed. Question 1: The recipe calls for 1/4 cup creme fraiche or sour cream. On a container of creme fraiche at the store, the instructions say to use one-third to one-half of the amount of creme fraiche when substituting it for sour cream in recipes. Can anyone explain this discrepancy? Is it OK to use the same amount of both? I made them with sour cream. Question 2: Do you recommend using sweetened or unsweetened dried cranberries? Both are available.

Rating: 4
This is an easy, quick scone to make with delicious results. I made them to take to a meeting last nght, but when my husband tasted one he said I had to leave them home, they were too good to take. I like NOT getting out the food processor for step one - I think I would have spent the time saved washing and putting it away.

I have made these twice in the last week and plan onmaking them again tomorrow. I went through the trouble of making the creme fraiche which is very simple and used fresh blueberries for one of the batches. Everyone keeps raving about how these things just melt in your mouth. Definitely a new Sunday morning favorite.

I think this recipe is excellent. I have made it five times in the last three weeks. I plan to make it again tomorrow. Everyone really enjoys it. I find it extra special to serve it when it comes out of the oven.The only thing that I did different was I doubled the recipe I found it didn't make enough.

The previous reviewer has committed one of my pet peeves: please do not criticize a recipe that you have not followed accurately! I've made these scones several times now and they are always a huge hit. While I'm sure substituting oranges would still make a fine scone, it's the tangerines that make this scone recipe so distinctive -hence the four well-deserved forks!

Rating: 4
WOW!!! These are the best scones I have ever made. Moist, flavorful. Absolutely delicious.

Four forks? A dish BEYOUND compare? I don't think so but it is a really good recipe. My 8 year old daughter and I made these and really like them. However, the store in the little town we live in didn't have tangerines, so we used a mandarin orange instead and that worked really well. We will definitely make them again.

These are so light and moist, they can hardly be called a scone. There's something elegant about the notion of tangerines in batter so this is a nice breakfast for guests. I'm sending this recipe to everyone!

Rating: 4
Excellent! Very light and fluffy for a scone. Reheats well the next day. I used orange instead of tangerine (the grated peel of one large orange was enough--about one tablespoon). Didn't have parchment, just baked them on my airbake cookie sheet and that worked fine. Blended the butter into the dry ingredients in the food processor as did a previous reviewer. It's easy, works well.

I made these as a post Thanksgiving breakfast for my in laws and they were a HUGE hit! I baked them 1 week ahead and froze. Warmed them up in 200 degree oven for 25 minutes.

Excellent, easy, and not too sweet. I chopped up the dried cranberries for more even distribution throughout the scone and also added an extra tablespoon of tangerine juice. For those who like ginger, these would be even better with very finely-chopped crystallized ginger sprinkled on top.

An excellent scone recipe! I switched out the tangerine peel and juice for orange and the results were delicious. I also added 1 tsp orange extract for some extra orange kick. Didn't get a chance to freeze any, as they were gobbled up too quickly!

This is a great scone recipe! Even people in my family who do not like scones like these. I substituted oranges for tangerines because that's what I had. I made it another time and put dried cherries instead of cranberries - I like the cranberries better because of the tartness, but the cherries are good. One time saver is to put the dry ingredients in a food processor and pulse in the pieces of butter. It works really well! YUM!

Best scone recipe I have ever made. Not dry at all, a problem with many scones, I agree. These are tender, wonderful and not too sweet.

Rating: 4
This recipe was very delicious and I would definately make it again. I made 16 smaller scones instead of the larger 8. Watch scones carefully during baking, otherwise the bottoms will brown quickly, making them drier than they already are.
