This recipe is wonderful, a fresh twist for chicken soup. The ginger, turnip and watercress gives the soup its flavor. I modified the recipe a bit, added an extra carrot, doubled the ginger, doubled the scallions, used 2 cups of chicken stock and two cups of veggie stock. That made enough for 2 large bowls of soup with a little left over to have for lunch tomorrow. I love it and will definitely make it again.
