The crème fraîche and lemon curd "frosting" is quite good...however, the cake itself is disgusting. The flavor was okay, but the texture was so bad I threw out the rest of the cake after serving it for my mother's birthday. When the cake came out of the oven, I poked the holes in the top and went ahead and poured all the syrup on it--in several additions so it would absorb as the recipe instructs. Well, like one reviewer commented, this results in a very wet (not moist) "soaked" type of cake. When other reviewers wrote that the syrup "all soaked in," I now realize they meant that it disappears into the cake without pooling at the bottom--which is true-- but what they didn't say is that the cake that results is like a mouth of lemony mush. And I note for those of you wondering, yes, my cake rose just fine--no sagging in the middle like some other reviewers. I just can't get over the fact that some people enjoy this soggy textured cake. It needs another name I think, because "cake" is not fitting.

I made this for a dinner party, to serve after a spicy Indian meal, it was the perfect palate-cleansing finish. Some notes that might help: 1) I wanted creme fraiche but the market was out. I used a mixture of heavy whipping cream and yogurt, with store bought lemon curd mixed in. It was extremely fast and delicious. 2) I used salted butter because I tend to think that almost everything needs a little salt. This didn't. I'll go unsalted next time. 3) It's a little scary spooning all that liquid over the cake, you think you're turning your cake to mush. But it does all soak up nicely -- I didn't use all of my syrup and wished I had.

wonderful - the cake can stand on its own but the lemon cream is to die for!

This lemony cake is amazing. I am a huge fan of citrusy deserts, and this one takes the cake. I've designated it my annual birthday cake and have no desire to look elsewhere. The tangy lemon is perfect and is complemented by the creamy curd which rounds out the flavors creating a well rounded oral experience. Mmm, salivating now.

The cake is a go-to recipe for me. Simple, simple yet folks always rave.I find the curd and cream topping superfluous. I top with only powdered sugar. Always comes out perfect (I use the magazine suggested flour amount of 1-1/4 cup). For better presentation, use a parchment sling. Definitely make this cake.

I thought it sounded a little too lemony for my taste, so I altered the syrup: I dissolved half a cup of sugar in a full cup of creme de cassis, then marinated the sliced strawberries in the syrup for a couple of hours at room temp. I spooned the syrup over the cake, as instructed...it took a few rounds to get all the syrup soaked up but in the end the cake stood up to the challenge. I served the cake topped with the curd, then the marinated berries, and a whole fresh strawberry and a mint sprig for garnish. YUM.

Loved this recipe! I don't know what people were talking about w/ the flour/cake falling/etc. I used all purpose flour and it was perfect. I did not make the curd, but instead I mixed about 3/4 cup of creme fraise with 1T of sugar and a few drops of rose water. The combo of lemon with the rose cream was so gorgeous. I will definitely make again.

Fantastic. I love citrus desserts. This will probably become my annual birthday cake. It was incredibly moist and delicious. I added a little extra lemon here and there, because I find most recipes could use more for my taste, but even if I hadn't it still would have been amazing.

I made this cake for a colleague's birthday one year ... and I got so much praise for it! It was worth the fuss with the topping and berries just for the looks on their faces when my workmates ate it. I had to double the recipe and make it in an oversized tin which might explain why it took longer to bake than the recipe says and it looked a bit browner than the photograph on the website whence it came. I also had to skimp a bit on the lemon zest and I use sour cream instead of crème fraîche (which I couldn't get). It makes a moist and sticky cake that tastes pretty good - and the lemon curd (also known as lemon butter) is incredible! (I love lemon butter on toast mmmmmmm!) I made a double quantity of the curd but I ended up only using half of it - and about half the quantity of sour cream specified for one batch. That tastes pretty good too. I made it dairy free in the end (replaced the butter with dairy free margarine) and kept a slice aside for one of the guys in my team who is lactose intolerant - I put plain lemon butter on it. He was almost in tears he was so thrilled that someone had thought to do that for him. He said that he never gets to eat cake - had almost forgotten what it tastes like - so this was amazing for him. I almost felt guilty because it wasn't nearly as hard to do as he thought *laugh*.

to mgratzer- a tablespoon of baking powder is *way* too much for this amount of flour, about 1 teaspoon would be about right. The cake fell because you used too much leavening. That is the culprit here, not this recipe (which you did not make "exactly as stated"). Let's all give fair reviews-

I made this recipe exactly as stated. I did not have self rising flour, so after a little searching I added a scant tablespoon of baking powder and a scant teaspoon of salt to the flour. The cake had risen nicely at 25 minutes, but was still jiggling in the middle and wet. After another 5 minutes, it was still moist. After another 3 minutes, it was cooked through but half of the cake (a good portion of the middle) had fallen to a totally dense 1/2" thick. This is the first time I've ever had something fall on me. It's not serveable to guests and it will have to be scrapped. Too bad, because the (very thick) batter sure tasted good.

I served this last night for a spring BBQ. It was the perfect ending to a heavy meal. I made 1-8 inch cake and 4 cupcakes. I think next time I will make all cupcakes. I made only a third of the lemon curd and there is definately enough "frosting" for the cake. As some reviewers mentioned the cake getting soggy, I added the yougurt/curd mixture right before serving. Great!

I used the self rising flour and it still fell. This was mostly because I did not bake it long enough. I am not too exciting about the frosting. I think that I will try french vanilla yogart or whip cream. The curd was too strong for me.

To update my previous review: The cake turned out very well. My favorite part was the lemony, buttery, delicious crust. It was about the thickest cake batter I've ever made--and I've made hundreds--but it turned out fine. I did use the 1 3/4 cups of flour, and since I never buy self-rising flour, I added 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder to unbleached white flour. This baked up fine in two 8- inch round cake pans, which also resulted in more yummy crust. I'm not sure I'd combine the curd with whipped cream again as a frosting, delicious as that is, just because it softened the crust, especially over the several days it took for four adults to consume this extravagant treat.

Why make so much lemon curd if you only use a half cup? Haven't yet tried the cake--it's sitting in the fridge. I used the reviewer from Portland's tip about making two layers, combining lemon curd with whipped cream, and layering with berries.

Rating: 0
There seems to be a question of whether to use 1 3/4 cups of 1 1/4 cups of self-rising flour. Which is it? This recipe sounds great and I would love to try it, but it would help to know how much flour to use. thanks to anyone who responds.

This is a fabulous lemon cake recipe! I made several changes: I baked the cake in two 8 in rounds, made a frosting of the lemon curd and freshly whipped cream, layered fresh strawberries in the center of the cake, and topped the two layer cake with Oregon raspberries and blueberries. My guests loved it!

For those whose cake fell, maybe you didn't use self rising flour. This recipe was so very good and a snap to make if you use store bought lemon curd. I followed the suggestions shown earlier and used a spring form pan and extra lemon curd spread on the cake. A pretty display of strawberries on top really dressed this dessert up. So lemony, so good and if you are lucky, the cold leftovers are even better.

This cake was awesome, very moist and lemony. My family raved about it, and I should have made two of them because it was eaten up immediately. I used whipping cream instead of the curd and it was indeed awesome. The lemon in the strawberries was perfect too. Will definitely make again.

I had the same experience as a few others - my cake fell flat in the middle. 25 minutes wasn't nearly enough time. I was nervous about over-baking so I think all of the checking and poking might have contributed to the fall. With that said...I will be making this over and over because if what I had was imperfect, I can't imagine how great it will be when I get it right. It is so intensely lemony and in combination with the unbelievable sauce and the strawberries, it is a party in your mouth.

Friends ask me to make this lemon cake all of the time!! I originally made this in baby bundt pans and served it with tea, but it's great as a dessert as well. In fact, it has been requested for this year's Thanksgiving! (so much for pumpkin pie :-( )The long plane grater/zester by Microplane is an awesome tool for those who strugle with the zesting.

Given the good reviews, I was surprised by how poorly this cake turned out. The batter did have the consistency of cookie dough, and the amount of syrup was totally out of proportion to the cake - the end result was wet and soggy with lemon juice. The lemon curd in the microwave turned out surprisingly well, however, although next time I would strain the curd before chilling... and I'll skip the cake entirely.

This was delicious! Really moist, and the sauce was great! I was surprised when i read the recipe -- I thought the cake would be quite dry, given how cookie-like the ingredient list is. But with the syrup, it turned out perfectly moist and delicious. I made the sauce with bought curd and plain yogurt, though, and it was a bit runny (but still great!), but i'll probably go with creme fraiche next time.

To New Jersey, from across Manhattan: I too hate zesting all that peel. So I de-pulped the lemon with a spoon and chucked the peel in the food processor. Now I have zest for the next month. And otherwise, this is the perfect warm-weather dish -- sweet and tart with an excellent balance in consistencies. Wow.

Delicious. The lemon curd is easy to make but tiring to grate all that peel. I also confess to using purchased curd and quickly mixing it will either cream, sour cream or plain yogurt. For a quick "home-made" dessert, I've substituted with purchased angel food cake too.

I did not have the metal (8x8x2) pan recommended, instead I used a 10" springform pan and made the following changes: I used 2 sticks of butter, increased sugar for the cake to 1 1/4 cups, 2 teaspoons of lemon peel and a dash of salt. I baked the cake for approx 27 minutes. After adding lemon syryp and cooling, I used purchased lemon curd and spread over entire top of cake. Served as slices rather than squares. Cake looked beautiful and tasted great.

I first served this for company, exactly as the recipe indicated. I used creme fraiche. The recipe was delicious. I had lots of the curd, minus the fraiche left over, so I tried it again, using low fat sour cream. It was delicious! I definitely make this again.

Cake and curd cream are delicious. However, I had the same problem with the cake being deflated in the middle. The recipe in the magazine calls for 1 1/4 cups of flour, but online, it calls for 1 3/4 cups of flour. Which is it? Maybe that's the problem! Also, I made just 1/3 of the curd recipe which was enough for one recipe with no leftovers.

To the cook from MI--it sounds like the edges of your cake are cooking too fast--your oven may be too hot, or try baking it in a water bath to regulate the temperature.

I made this cake for my family on Memorial Day. I served it with blueberries. Everybody loved the dessert, and I loved how easy it was to prepare. Several people asked for the recipe! I will definitely make this cake again. I had none of the aforementioned problems with this recipe. My cake turned out perfect.

thought this recipe was great! I made it for my womens group and all wanted the recipe. I did bake the cake for about 8 minutes additional, still quite liquid in the middle. I was also flying by the seat of my pants, so I used a purchased lemon curd (gasp!) but was still delicious.

My sister-in-law made this last weekend. It was wonderful. I loved the dense "brownie-like" lemon cake. It was buttery and lemony all at once, and very delicious. I am looking forward to making it myself!

I agree the lemon curd in the microwave is the best. I have made this cake 3 times because it is wonderful. But....every single time the whole center of the cake fell. (that is the only reason for 3 forks) I had a thick 3 inch rim all around and then it was thin in the middle. Did anyone else have the same problem or is it my oven?

The microwave method for lemon curd is the best part of this recipe! Cake was easy, too. Stored cake in the pan covered with plastic wrap for 2 days before serving, and it was fabulous served with the lemon-curd/creme fraiche and berries.
