This recipe is amazingly delicious but it could use a few tiny tweaks. It ended up almost too creamy and sweet, leaving that fatty film in your mouth. I'll cut down on the cream and sugar next time for it to be perfect. I'm not sure about the quantity issues others we're having. I have a 2 quart bucket and it was nearly coming over the top.

This was very yummy and easy to make. This is the first time I made homemade ice cream and it was a hit. I used skim milk instead of whole milk and it turned out very creamy.

Was looking for a good nothing fancy recipe and found this one in my files. Must tell you it's the best vanilla ice cream I have ever made. Two things, it didn't begin to turn to the ice crystals most homemade ice creams do. But can either Gourmet or anyone tell me why when it gives 1 1/2 qts quantity, it really produces about half of that.

This recipe actually makes significantly less ice cream than the 1.5 qt indicated. I have a 1 qt ice cream maker and therefore multiplied the ingredients by 2/3rds, to get a maximum of 1 qt. The resulting ice cream was actually about 1/4 to 1/3 qt. This also was a very thick, custardy ice cream. 1 egg was enough, even multiplying the ingredients by 2/3rds. Still, a very tasty french vanilla ice cream. Not much required for serving, since it is so rich and flavorful. I would make it again, but perhaps add more milk to balance the cream, and thin the base.

I agree with the previous reviewer that this ice cream is eggy tasting. It's ok ice cream but I would cut back to one egg in the future.

This was my first attempt at making homemade ice cream, and it's absolutely delicious! As suggested by another user, I substituted 1 T. of vanilla extract for the vanilla beans, and it came out beautifully. To cut the carb content a bit, I used Splenda's sugar blend (halving the amount of sugar, according to Splenda's directions)--came out great! Creamy, rich, but not overwhelming. This is some of the best ice cream ever. Can't wait to make it with some cinnamon!

We make ice cream for guests fairly often, and have to say this one was one of the best. I'd run out of vanilla beans so used a tablespoon of vanilla extract - a fine substitution.

This was a very rich and creamy recipe. Very good with peach cobbler and apple pie!

This is absolutely the very best ice cream EVER. I made the custard 24 hours in advance (couldn't quit licking the bowl) and froze it in my cuisinart ice cream maker. It turned into the smoothest, creamiest ice cream I've ever seen from scratch. It rivaled the best frozen custard from every famous little stand. Even using just plain pure vanilla extract instead of the beans results in a superb ice cream. This recipe will be the only one I ever make from now on. It can't get any better.

Yummy! Super vanilla! Try Penezy's for vanilla pods - good prices.

To Alamogordo- The notes do mean that it can be chilled for 24 hours prior to freezing it. It's always best to make sure it's well chilled before putting it in the ice cream machine. Most homemade ice creams are best the day they're made and tend to get icy over time, but I've found the higher fat ones (like this recipe) have a longer shelf life in the freezer and still are quite tasty and have good texture up to 3-4 days.

I have a question for all you people out there who are experienced ice cream makers, since I am a novice. When the cook's notes in this recipe say that the custard can be chilled for 24 hrs., I presume that this means that one can chill the custard for 24 hours prior to freezing it in the ice cream maker?? The cook's note does not mean that the ice cream can only be frozen for 24 hrs., does it?? Any help would be appreciated. Tnank you.

To the pre-made ice cream buyer from the Midwest, I agree with the cook from Wisconsin. Buy an ice cream maker and you will never buy store bought again. If you're too lazy to make the custard style, you can make good old fashioned vanilla with cream, milk, sugar, and vanilla. So good.

Wonderfully creamy and full of flavor. Although expensive, the 3 vanilla beans were well worth it. I personally didn't find it "eggy" and wouldn't change a thing, though it is rich enough to where one less egg wouldn't be missed. By the way, to Midwest, Edy's is very good, but still cannot compare to this recipe. And with a good ice cream maker, making this ice cream is a breeze and well worth the effort.

This ice cream is so creamy! I will try it with only one egg next time -- found the taste to be a little "eggy" with two. Just beware, each 1/2 cup serving has approx. 326 calories, 22 grams of fat BUT the taste and texture is worth the extra sit-ups!!!!

I was never completely satisfied with a store-bought vanilla ice cream until we tried Edy's Dreamery Vanilla (just the plain vanilla flavor). Much better than HagenDaaz or Ben and Jerry's. Try it and save yourself the work. Neither I nor anyone I know has any affiliation with Edy's.

I found this recipe on epicurious about a year ago and have followed it numerous times since. It is a huge favorite with all our friends. The thermometer was my saviour, as I previously had trouble stopping before the mix boiled and curdled. It is very rich and works well with light cream rather than heavy. The vanilla beans are great, but extract works too.

I have found a great alternative for vanilla beans (and much more affordable), it is vanilla paste. You can find it at a gourmet specialty store or online. It gives you all the flavor of the vanilla beans but it is alot easier and a good sized bottle is a fraction of the cost.

I have started making my own ice cream over the last few months and have made a similar recipe. If price is no object the use of three vanilla beans is a wonderful idea, but at $3-5 each, this is a fairly pricey recipe for 1 quart. As a less expensive, yet just as tasty alternative, substitute 2 teaspoon of high quality vanilla and for a little richer custard-type tase add another egg yolk. Combine the eggs and sugar until frothy about 2 minutes before adding the scalded cream milk.
