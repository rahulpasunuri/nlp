This is my favorite salsa recipe (though to me, it is more of a chunky guacamole)! It is basic, but delicious, and I even got my non-avocado liking family to try and love it. I usually just eyeball the ingredients and it comes out great, plus like other reviewers have done it is easy to add beans etc. to make it a little different. My family asks me to bring it to every cook out! I've made it a few times when corn is out of season, and though it is still tasty, it is definitely better with fresh corn off the cob (and I do grill mine because I like the smokiness).

This recipe was a good starting point -- used 1/2 avocado, 2 medium heirloom tomatoes, 1 ear of *steamed* (not raw as the recipe suggests) corn on the cob, juice of 1/2 lime, 1/2 can of drained black beans, 1 habanero, 1/2 cup of diced roasted red peppers, 1/2 cup of diced red onion, some leftover chopped scallions, handful of fresh cilantro from the garden, salt to taste. I would def make this again, as it held up much better the next day than regular homemade salsa does. Have fun with this recipe!

Great recipe! Just a few alterations. I added chili powder, 1 minced chipotle in adobe and doubled the corn.

We loved this salsa and had it alongside chicken quesadillas on a very hot humid day. It was very refreshing and went perfectly with the quesadillas and a beer. It looked great on the plate too -- served a heaped spoonful in the center of the plate and a small dollop of sour cream.

Yum! Great as a topping for grilled steak tacos. I doubled the amount of corn in the recipe, and was happy with the results.

It was too late for fresh corn, but the frozen corn worked. Delicious with cold shrimp at a picnic.

Absolutely declicious with the chilli rubbed shrimp recipe on the site, even though I had no cilantro or jalapenos and I used canned corn. Will defintely make this again!

My guests really liked it, I think people appreciate it because it tastes fresh. It wasn't exciting enough for me as-is so I took some of the reviewer tips and doctored it with a few dashes of Cholula, salt, extra limes.

I won first place in my company's summer picnic salsa competition with this recipe! Ok, some slight alterations were made..added chili powder, garlic and a dash of Cholula hot sauce. I think the key is using avocado that is firm enough to keep it's shape so it doesn't turn into a guacamole of sorts. Also, don't be shy with the salt. Good stuff!

This was one of the best ways I've ever had fresh sweet corn! The comment preceding the recipe is key - the quality of the ingredients makes a huge difference. The final salsa was sweet, creamy, salty, spicy and acidic all in one bite. I served with grilled chicken, black beans and arepas. I will definitely make again but only with the freshest raw sweet corn - I can't imagine it with frozen or canned corn - you'd lose the sweetness and crunch that are so appealing.

Quick, easy, and delicious. I first used it as an addition to Raichlen's grilled chili-rubbed shrimp (also wonderful), and it was such a hit that I've started using it in tacos and also as a stand alone appetizer. Everyone requests that I bring "that awesome guacamole salsa" to parties. I learned the hard way not to add more lime juice (it was way too overpowering), but I always use a little extra cilantro. This is possibly my favorite Epi recipe ever.

Loved by kids, & adults. I added adzuki beans sitting in the fridge and they added good color and flavor. I omitted the onion and only added scallions (kids don't love onions). I'm making it again for this weekend! An awesome snack!!!

It just didn't make it for me...there are far better salsa recipes.

So good, especially using all those fresh ingredients. My only suggestion is to make sure that the avocado is on the firm side so that it holds together in cube shape after stirring; it wouldn't be as appetizing if it got mushy. Loved it.

This was a delicious salsa. I added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed).

i made this to go with the ancho-chili rubbed shrimp on this site, which were also excellent. a perfect salsa - easy, simple, colorful and full of flavor. who says eating healthy has to hurt?

Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, however I didn't seed the jalepeno, which was a mistake. It turned out a little too hot for my taste, but I still couldn't stop eating it.

This is a very tasty salsa, but I think next time i will be swapping the scallions for red onions. But the original recipe is still very good!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this salsa; and I usually do not like salsa at all! Fearing terrible heartburn, I did reduce the jalapeno to 1/2 a pepper, and still found it to have a nice spice. I think it could use a bit more tomato, so I added about 1/2 of an extra.

Delicious and very easy to make! A refreshing salsa on a hot summer day. I served it with the chili-rubbed shrimp and received raves and multiple requests for the recipe.

This salsa is excellent. So light, fresh and delicious! It can be a great base to add other items such as black beans and shallots. It's great with simple chicken tacos and chips, but would also be terrific with grilled items.

This is the best summer dip ever!! Definitely use fresh corn and even better with black beans.

I am so glad it's fresh corn season so I can make this again. Even if you're a skeptic, try the uncooked corn. Your family and guests will love it! This time, I added black beans and it was great!

This was delicious! We had to used canned corn instead, but it still tasted great. I also added black beans and extra scallions. Will definitely make over and over again.

Great salsa. I used frozen corn but will try it with fresh next time.

Unbelievable salsa, even people who do not like avocado love this. The fresh corn right off the cob is the key. I use young white Jersey corn....The best!

just a tip to keep the shape of the avocado. Once it's ripe, put it in the refrigerator and it will stay ripe longer as well as hold its shape better once cut.

Wow-I am a salsa freak and I loved this one. It was easy to throw together. My guests gobbled it up even when the shrimp were all gone. I did cheat and used Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn but it added a nice flavor. I am making it again this weekend for a cookout (but making extra to keep at home for myself)!!

So delish! I doubled the lime juice and added a little Tapatio hot sauce and this was to die for. I cooked the corn since I'm not a big raw corn fan and thought the taste and texture was phenomenal! I served it with the Grilled Spicy Skirt Steak from this site and some tortillas and we could not have been happier. Will definitely be making again!

This is so simple and so good, the key is to make it in the summer when all the produce is fresh. This is a keeper for summer cook outs and parties

This was so good. The raw corn is key, and worth the effort for the crunchy result.

This has become my standard salsa recipe. I have made it at least 10 times now, following the recipe exactly as it is written. Don't mess with it, it's perfect as is. :) The raw corn is really what makes this salsa stand out.

I used canned corn, added cooked medium Shrimp and tossed it with a little hot sauce. Then served it over green leaf lettuce as a chilled summer salad. It was great!

Delicious! Simple. Fresh. I've made this several times for various summer get togethers and dinner parties-- it is always well-remarked and the first thing to be eaten up entirely!

I made this for a football party, and everyone loved it! The avocados were so ripe that they turned to goo when I stirred it, so I would add them at the last minute next time. Be sure to use fresh corn - it is a lot of work, but is worth it!

Excellent, refreshing and tasty salsa. My guests loved it. I used freshly squeezed lime juice, which gave it a nice kick. I also sprinkled some cumin.

Used this with the chile rubbed shrimp and we LOVED this salsa. I forgot to squeeze additonal lime before serving, and it could've used it, but it was still great. Anything with avocado, lime, and cilantro is a winner in my book!

If I had to use one word to sum up this recipe it would be , "refreshing." The first time making this I was out of fresh cilantro so I used dried oregano instead - it still worked! Also, I would suggest adding one tablespoon of high quality olive oil. For garnish I broil a few strips of bacon, which I crumbled into the salad for a southwestern feel. A great side when grilling.

This was very good, and I made it just as the recipe stated. Served with the grilled shrimp, and then had again the following day with grilled salmon. As good as this recipe is, though, I still prefer the Tri-color Salsa recipe here at this site. That one tastes a little better and has some oil in it. But, this was very good for someone dieting too. I added extra jalapenos for kick as well.

Not half bad! I made this to accompany some grilled tuna steaks, and the salsa was still vanishing, along with the bread, even after the tuna was long gone. This was a nice, light, refreshing salsa that would probably go well either alone as a dip or paired with many of the more robust types of fish. Good balance of flavours and textures - like other reviewers before me, I enjoyed the crunch of the raw corn as a counterpoint to the tomatoes and ripe avocado; on the other side of things, the scallions, jalapeno, and lime all worked well, both together and to balance the sweetness of the other ingredients. Great for multi-purpose summer usage, and it's in my little book of 'keeper' recipes. My only modification: I held back on the cilantro, adding only about 2/3rds of what was called for. I liked the result - however, I'm not a huge fan of cilantro, so YMMV.

I like this dish except I found it too limey (and I used the low end of the tablespoon suggestions). To counter that, I added some cumin. Also, I found the avacado loses its shape after just a few stirs, so I'd recommend covering the avacado in lime juice in one bowl, doing everything else in another, then combing just once at the end to keep the chunks of avacado chunky.

A really easy, delicious and satifsying dish. It's colorful and is great for a party. I left the cilantro out and added more jalapenos. So good!

Ditto - this is GREAT! I served this at a party and it was gone in minutes. It's really, really delicious, and festive, too! Perfect summer dish and easy to make.

I agree, incredible. The crunch of the raw corn and the fresh avocados made the dish. It was easy to fix, and what few leftovers there were also tasted great the next day. I served it over black bean burgers, but it was terrific as a side dish on its own. Also great with chips.

This was INCREDIBLE! I cant believe that no one else has bothered to review it! I hostessed a cocktail party over Memorial weekend and this was a hit with all my guests. I made a double batch and the bowl was licked clean! I gave the recipe to 3 people! A very nice change from traditional Avocado Dips (ie Guacamole). Next time, I might even add a few tsp of chipotle seasoning, to add a smokier flavor. But it was great all on it's own!
