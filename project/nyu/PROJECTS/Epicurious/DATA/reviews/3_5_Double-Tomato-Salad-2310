A superb salad.

To decrease the fat content and calories, I use a combination of oil-packed and regular dry sun-dried tomatoes and leave out the extra oil. I chop all the ingredients for the dressing together, adding about half a minced shallot and some Kosher salt. Works wonderfully.

Mince the olives, add one large finely minced shallot. To make this in the winter: Peel two grocery store tomatoes per person, cut in half horizontally. Place, cut-side-up, on foil-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle lightly with dark brown sugar, coarse salt, and pepper. Roast at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. Turn tomatoes over, lower oven temp to 250 and continue roasting until most of the tomato juice has evaporated. Use in place of sliced tomatoes. You can plate this salad hours ahead of time.

Very fresh summer salad. I liked the mixture of sun-dried and natural tomatoes, and the capers and olives added kick. A great companion to quiche!
