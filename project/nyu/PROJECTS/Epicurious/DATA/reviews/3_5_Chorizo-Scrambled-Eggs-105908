The recipe is simplicity itself, no need to complicate matters. As the sausage is quite salty, add neither salt nor pepper. Some grated goat or farmer cheese is nice at the end. Cilantro is an authentic touch, and so is fresh chopped oregano. In the Mexican highlands, I learned to eat it using only tortilla pieces, forsaking flatware, much to the amusement of my dear campesino hosts. If you prefer sauces, try it with the green salsa as in most places it has a shadow of vinegar to bring out the sweetness of the sausage. Enjoy! +Bishop Joel

I grew up, waking up to the sound of the rolling pin of my nana making fresh flour tortillas in the morning and it was always chorizo y huevito in the morning. just some advice if you are buying in the states look for longaniza, it should be firm to touch, and it wont be as greasy as the chorizo they sell in the states, and more similar to the chorizo they sell in mexico.

This was so easy and delicious! I actually used the Soyrizo and this into breakfast burritos by wrapping the egg mixture in warm flour tortillas. I like my eggs with a little more kick than the soyrizo offered so I added a bit of hot salsa.

We make this at home, but use Soyrizo for a great Friday and Lenten meal. Serve with a side of refried beans sprinkled with cheese(jack, chihuahua, or your favorite), even red sauce or salsa too. This is an authentic Tex-Mex meal for breakfast, brunch, or any other time of the day.

I used 8 oz of Mexican Chorizo for the first time in my life. It has quite an interesting taste. I also used the 10 eggs and some diced onion in this receipe. I added salt. That was a big mistake. I'll follow the directions much more carefully the next time I make this concoction.

This dish is very delicious, i've tried a couple variations (through my past boyfriend)- compare the taste between pork chorizo and beef chorizo- a very good meal the day after drinking- very satisfying.

It was okay. A bit much for breakfast- much better for brunch. I wonder if Spaniards eat chorizo early in the morning? I associate it with a tapas bar, and felt like reaching for a sangria.

Mt Portuguese grandmother made a dish very similar to this. She added diced pre-cooked potatoes, sautéed onions, and a diced green pepper to the chorizo and then when heated in a skillet, added the eggs. Delicious and my mouth waters from just thinking of this dish.

Best with homemade bulk chorizo. While eggs are still fairly loose, fold in some grated cheese, (I prefer longhorn cheddar) as little or as much as you like. Plate and sprinkle with chopped dill weed. Serve with salsa and warm flour tortillas.

I have eaten chorizo all my life, first Spanish chorizo and later in America Mexican chorizo. The recipe describes exactly how i remember it being prepared and I agree it is the best breakfast. Even when I could not eat eggs I was always able to eat them with chorizo.

I've been eating chorizo and eggs for many years and it is my all-time favorite breakfast. I would add that the oil is not really necessary as most chorizo is quite oily on its own. The best chorizo actually comes from Portugal so use it when you can, although the mexican variety is ok. Try to avoid the vacuum packaged chorizo as it is always quite fatty. I always eat it with 'Crystal' hot sauce.
