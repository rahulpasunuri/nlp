We followed some of the recommendations in the reviews and used 4 oz of goat cheese instead of the 3.5 and we felt like it was the perfect amount. The cheese was not overbearing, and the cakes were wonderful. We also don't have a ricer, so we just mashed the potatoes with a handheld masher and we loved the texture of the cakes. We also had some extra panko on hand, so we used that and couldn't tell the difference from regular bread crumbs. We will definitely make these tasty cakes again!

We love these potato cakes. The recipe is great as written (which is how I made it last night, to serve with fish) - but you can also gently brown the shallots first, then fold them into the mashed potato and goat cheese. Have used homemade crumbs and panko crumbs - both good. An added benefit is they can be made early in the day, fried, then placed on a cookie sheet, covered with a tea towel and stored until you need to serve - just pop in the oven for about 20 minutes. I sometimes make several small cakes instead of 4 large ones, you should be able to get 8 or 9 - great for company! Leftovers, if there are any, are great served with a poached egg on top and a piece of Canadian back bacon underneath, for breakfast!

I've been making these for years. Absolutely delicious. Always good with almost anything. Everyone I've made them for faves and the recipe has been passed on to so many others. Trust - it's great and easy.

We liked this a lot. It was like a rich mashed potato (as someone already noted) with a crispy crust. I had no trouble keeping it together; if anything it was a tad dry. It would be a great accompiment to any dish with a rich sauce or gravy.

Added too much goats cheese - result: the cake would not fry through, just brown a bit on the bottom, falling apart when I tried to flip it over. Served it anyway, the mixture being like a tasty mash 'tattie.

This was good, but not great. The goat cheese was a nice addition, but our kids found it to be too strong. This recipe would be good for a rainy night, fill your stomach kind of night.

Great recipe but I add more goat cheese, garlic and shallots to it. I also use the scallions instead of chives - adds more of a kick. Great with a roasted chicken. You can make it ahead of time and brown at the last minute.

Excellent side dish. I'd use a little extra cheese and get a little creative with the spices. If you follow the recipe exactly, it would be too bland.

I couldn't really taste the goat cheese. It was okay

A great side dish to fill in the necessary starch.
