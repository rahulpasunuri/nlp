Yow. Excellent dahl recipe. Wonderful flavors - more than most I've had - and not too hot. I used twice the turmeric (because it's so healthy I can't get enough!) and powdered coconut milk. It's not thick like some versions, so it's more like a soup. I could have eaten the whole pot myself. Make a double recipe!

My husband is Bangladeshi and this is very similar to the way that he makes red dhal. It is easy and delish. He doesn't usually add coconut milk but it is very rich and yummy with it. As to the reviewer that said that it was too watery--it is traditional in many parts of South Asia to have soupy dhal which you mix with rice. They say that soupy dhal is healthy and easy to digest. But you can cook it longer to thicken it a bit.

I made this for a vegetarian dinner that also included an eggplant curry and saffron rice. I loved the flavors of the recipe. My only issue was too much liquid which I remedied by draining the lentils. Don't know if anyone else had this problem, but next time I will reduce the liquid to 1 1/2 or 2 cups.

Good although it needed...something else. I added a little fresh grated ginger and a handful of dried apricots which added a little more interest. I'll make this again, but I'm still looking for a better dal recipe.

Oops, I meant hardened, not hollow. Te contents of the coconut milk...

I knew I had a can of coconut milk in my pantry, but when I went to open it the contents was hollow and I realized it had expired about 8 months ago. :/ I proceeded with the recipe anyways as my lentils were already cooking. I didn't have the whole seeds so I used the ground version of spices. Other than that and the coconut milk, I followed the recipe and it actually turned out great. A simple, flavorful lentil side. I can only imagine how over the top the coconut milk would have made this dish.

What a simple recipe with excellent flavor. As suggested by another reviewer I reduced the oil to 1 Tbsp, which I think was a smart move due to the splattering. Definitely have a pan lid ready to cover the seeds as I found them all over my kitchen cleaning up. My seeds were ready in less than a minute, maybe because my pan was really hot.

Loved this! Very simple and delicious - my husband brought home fresh coconut milk instead of canned and I just used a little bit less and let it cook a little longer.

I've made this twice in the past week. Excellent recipe! Very easy and very tasty. I decreased the amount of oil required to toast the spices. Both times, it took longer than 1 minute for the mustard seeds to turn a grayish, taupe color. Be careful with this particular step of the procedure--popping seeds mean popping oil that can land in painful splashes on your skin. The danger (I'm exaggerating) is worth it. This is one of those recipes that will be a regular. This dish goes great with basmati rice.

Used 2 tsp kosher salt instead of table salt - use caution when stirring hot oil/seed mixture to cooked lentils - hot oil/water don't mix well and will pop a bit.
