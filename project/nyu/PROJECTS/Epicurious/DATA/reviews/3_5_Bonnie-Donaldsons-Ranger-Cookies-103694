It has been a few years since I made these. Delicious!!!!!! So glad that I reconnected with this recipe.

I LOVED these cookies! I made a few revisions: I used unsalted butter instead of shortening because I prefer the taste of butter. I also happened to have unsweetened flaked coconut on hand and really enjoyed the nice coconut flavor and texture without the extra sugar (the cookies are plenty sweet.) I also had mini chocolate chips on hand and these were really easy to incorporate into the dense dough. I'd like to make them again and add walnuts or pecans. I really recommend trying these. They are so different from anything I've tried. Enjoy!

This is the BEST cookie. I made it several times with great success! I recommend making large batches and rolling it into a tube shape to freeze it. The dough freezes and bakes well. I've had frozen cookie dough lasting over a year if you vac u- seal it. Its always good to have yummy cookies ready to go.

I thought that I had lost this recipe and panic ensued. Thank heavens it was on this site as I have a group of people who would be devastated if they didn't get these cookies each year. I was so relieved to find it here that I read all of the reviews this time and was shocked at the number of cooks who didn't find them wonderful since I have never served them to anyone who wasn't looking for more. I guess that's what makes horse races. I think I'll make a batch of the just Ranger Cookies this Christmas to compare.

These cookies are huge! They have a lot of great ingredients like the chocolate chips, oatmeal, and cereal. I hate coconut, so I omitted that ingredient. They are not a dainty cookie, but would be great for camping and picnics!

I saw this recipe 4 years ago in the Sugar & Spice column and decided to try it, based on Bonnie's very funny letter. First attempts were a little dry, but I cut down the cooking time to suit my oven, and further attempts were fantastic! I used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand, and my kids loved them! I make these all the time now, people always ask for this recipe. Thanks, Bonnie!

I've made this several times, altering the amounts of cereal and coconut, and adding nuts. The last time I made it, I left out the nuts and found it to be a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I will cut back on the sugars per another reviewer's recommendation. This is a good cookie. Whenever I bring it to potlucks, people always ask, "Who made the cookies?"

Forgot to mention, you can add fruit loops, any colorful cereal, and it comes out really unique. The cereal is still crunchy too. I've made this recipe about 40+ times!

These were okay. If I were making them for kids, they may have received a better review. I feel there are more complex recipes on this site, if you are looking for something "different" that are far more worthy of my efforts. (ie the six spice oatmeal or brown sugar ginger crisps)

I haven't maid this cookie yet but I found the rice-crispies-substitution-tip very witty. I think you can make this cookie with all sorts of cereals!!

I have made them twice now. I can't keep them in the house. I brought some to work and everyone there loved them. Very good with a nice cup of coffee.

Being a huge fan of Ranger cookies, I was excited to try this version but in the end, found them disappointing. I followed the advice of the cook who recommended reducing both sugars to 3/4 cup each, so perhaps I should give them another go around following the original measurements. The best version of Ranger cookies I've ever found comes from "The All-American Cookie Book" by Nancy Baggett, and no,I am not she.

I make cookies very often, and found these to be a worthy addition to my repertoire. The amount of additions are numerous, yes, but that's what makes these cookies so much fun to eat. The Special K addition really makes for a perfect crispy/chewy combination. The only change I am going to experiment with is 3/4 cup each of granulated and brown sugar instead of the suggested 1 cup each - they were a bit too sweet. I would gladly make these again!

Rating: 3
These were great. You can't really detect the Special K cereal, but it adds a certain lightness and crispness to the cookies. I used 18 oz choc chips as suggested by a reviewer below ( she soggested 24 oz!) but I think the 12 oz the recipe calls for is plenty. I enjoyed these!!

Good cookies, though the bake time was a little too long for my oven and they were easily over-browned.

Yummy. These are very good cookies. I used Rice Krispies because that's what I had on hand, and they turned out great. One comment: double the chocolate chips. You'll like them!

I would probably make these again if I were making an assortment of cookies. They were OK, not spectacular and not horrible. I enjoyed the texture and the different flavors, but one of my tasters found the multiple flavors to be too much. I had a friend whose Mom used to make "K Bars" with special K cereal. Those were phenomenal, and I was hoping these would taste like her cookies. Sadly, they didn't.

I could barely find the cookie for all the fillings in these- but still good anyway. I made these along with wookie cookies, and although I thought everyone would go for the rangers, they devoured those first. Still, you should give them a try, they are very unique.

Very good and chewy! I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, and was out of oatmeal, so replaced it with one extra cup of corn flakes and one extra cup of coconut, and then used 1/2 c. choco. chips and 1/2 c. butterscotch chips. They come out flatter, but very chewy. They were gone in my office in minutes.

Mmmm. What an interesting cookie. I cut down on the fat by using 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup applesauce, and they turned out great. I also cut both sugars to 3/4 cup. I didn't have regular Special K, but I did have the red berries variation, which has what looks like freeze-dried strawberry pieces in it. It added a bit of tartness that works well with the other flavors. It also adds a bit of color. You could probably get the same effect with dried cranberries. These aren't particularly attractive cookies, but they would be fun with M&M's instead of choco chips as one reviewer suggested.

Made this recipe as written and found these cookies to be delicious. Everyone really liked them and they kept well for about a week. I found the dough easier to work with if I refridgerated it first, otherwise it was a little sticky.

Very tasty, interesting texture.But I followed the recipe on the Durkee Coconut package which called for butter or margarine,Cornflakes, 2 eggs,more coconut,and nuts raisins or chips are optional 1C. Opt for nuts adds to texture. Also,reduced cooking time, and keep cookies big.

If you cream the fat and sugar until fluffy, the cookies turn out surprisingly light.

Have made these cookies 3 times now. The latest version I substitued the Special K with granola, and added 1 cup of chopped walnuts. Magnificient!

Excellent cookies. Perhaps for the cookie purists who prefer a lighter texture and simpler flavour combinations these might not be their style, however I found them to be absolutely delicious. My family adored them also.

Sorry to say, even as a cookie lover, I didn't like these cookies. They were way too busy. Most of the ingredients are a waste of time to use, you can't even taste them. They are also way too crunchy.

These cookies were fabulous. Each bite has many different textures and flavors. I substituted regular oatmeal (not quick-cook), which I would not recommend (a bit too chewy).

sorry, but i can't agree with the other reviewers. these cookies had too much going on. too many flavors and textures. wouldn't make these again.

I love this receipe. I've made it about 7 times since I read it in Gourmet and my friends and family finish them up in just a few days. I bake them for 12 minutes and added a 1/4 cup more of chocolate chips. They are extremely easy to make.

These are excellent cookies, I added 1 1/2 C nuts, which made them even better. Definitly a keeper.

Yum. There is nothing more to say.

Have made these several times since this appeared in Gourmet and they are some of the best cookies I have ever had. The crunchiness of the cereal flakes make a really nice addition to the texture and there really are chips in every bite.

These were very good, I substituted Rice Crispies for the Special K and used dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate, and made them slightly smaller. I cooked them for aprox 9 minutes - golden on the bottom and the tops only slightly set for a chewier cookie. I made them yesterday and they are all gone now.

While the cookies were great right out of the oven I found that once they cooled they were much harder than I care for.

Imagine MY surprise when I discovered Bonnie Donaldson and Gwen Bradford's Ranger cookies are straight from the Dirkee Cocoanut Bag! They are delicious. But we need to give credit where it is due.

I loved these cookies. The first batch I made I forgot to put in the oatmeal (oops). Wasn't bad without the oatmeal either. Tastes even better with it though. I used semisweet chocolate morsels instead of the milk chocolate. Very tasty and crisp tasting with the Special K.

These cookies were enjoyed by my office mates, who ate them right up with their morning coffee. My husband called the recipe a "keeper". I have to admit that I made a slight modification to the recipe: I used Kellogg's Choco Krispies cereal instead of Special K because that's all I could find at the Kaiser supermarket here in Budapest, Hungary. Nevertheless, the cookies were real good and I will make them again. Thanks, Bonnie Donalson, for your version of Ranger Cookies.
