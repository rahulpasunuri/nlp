I made the recipe as directed with the exception of ciabatta bread. I found it to be very soggy and thought it needed more flavor-I think the addition of pesto would be great and maybe a little garlic..

This was an awesome sandwich. Made it for a boating trip. Really nice that you can make it ahead of time and it only gets better. The only change I made was to use ciabatta bread. Highly recommend. Very little effort for spectacular results.

Spread pesto on both sides of the bread. Made this the night before a picnic and stored in the frige overnight, everyone loved it.

Really fantastic! It's very easy to spice up too with a few fresh leaves of basil or other complimentary herbs. Very fresh tasting.
