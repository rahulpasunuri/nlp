Okay the first objective review. I've never heard of Speidies or lived in NY. I made this recipe as written and marinated sirloin, chicken and shrimp for about 2 hours. It didn't penetrate the beef very much but did add flavor. The shrimp was great and the chicken was good with the marinade. It kept it moist. I made kabobs and no pita bread. Baby potatoes, mushrooms and onion wedges rounded out the kabobs with corn on the cob as another side. Great dinner and very easy. But I have to say, I am now curious about the 'real' speidies!!

Wow! I haven't heard anyone mention Sharkey's and Lupo's in a long time. They definitely have the best spiedies and they have to be on Roma's Italian bread. I'm excited to try the recipe from Otsiningo Park - it looks great. And for anyone who is transplanted to the NC area, just fyi, the Harris Teeter and Lowes grocery stores do carry Salamida's State Fair Speidie sauce which is pretty good!

I agree - spiedies were introduced by Italian immigrants and the original Spiedie was always lamb. Being a third generation native of Endicott I cant even imagine a beef spiedie - ugh. The trend for chicken and beef spiedies started , I believe, in the later part of the 1970's while I was at Union Endicott High School.If anyone remembers the old man "Bootsie" that grilled spiedies out front of Kelly's bar and grill on Page Ave. (60's-70's) in Endicott - I would say his marinade was by far the best and was his own family recipe. Of the restaraunts I would vote Sharkey's the best and Lupo's a close second. As chance may have it I purchased one gallon of Lupo's marinade online and I purchased a boneless leg of lamb at the local food chain in order to grill spiedies for my 82 year old dad tomorrow. Oh - if only I had a loaf of Roma's bread !! Happy Fathers Day !!

I agree with others, this cook drank too much sherry before writing the above recipe. Here is the truth: In the Binghamton area pork and chicken spiedies are the most popular, even though lamb is original and beef, venison or other meats can be used. I like Sharkeys much better than Lupos. Here is the marinade for pork spedies from one of the yearly cooking contests at Otsiningo Park, NY: 4 lbs 1 1/2"cubed pork lion, 1 1/2 cups olive oil, 1/2 cup dry white wine, 1/2 cup vinegar, juice 1 lemon, 2 tsp season salt, 2 tsp blk pepper, at least 5 cloves minced garlic, 2 tbl fresh mint, 2 tbl fresh oregano, 3 tbl fresh basil. Marinate (4) four days stiring every day. Skewer and grill, basting as you go. Eat on chewy italian bread. Enjoy

I hate to pile on poor Charlie, but as a resident of Binghamton and particiapant in last week's Spiedie and Balloon Fest Spiedie Cooking Contest, I have to agree with the purests. Also, they were introduced by Italian immigrants and the original Spiedie was always lamb.

The fact is that you just can't duplicate the original recipe. As one who has tried many "copy-cats", it just can't be done. LUPO'S is the only way to go if you can't get to the Binghamton area.

I'm also a transplant from Binghamton and rarely get back to the area to replenish my speidi marinade stash. This recipe is ok but I have found that marinating the meat in a good store bought greek salad dressing gives me just the right flavor.

we make occasional pilgrimages to BGM for business(spiedies) but when faced with the cravings and no business to be done we make our own with lupo's spiedie sauce, available at supermarkets and also by mail from their spiedie.com site. Some things just shouldn't be messed with. and of course, they should be served naked(no veges-you can always have a salad) on the cottony kind of bread that used to be called "Italian"

The mystery of spiedies isn't all that much of a mystery. As the ex-wife of a Binghamtonian, I tasted both beef and chicken spiedies many times. It was one of my fondest memories of the area. Well, from what I can tell, this is actually a Portuguese tradition based on a dish called Espedatas. I made them for a cookout, and a total stranger came over begging me for the recipe. He was an ex-Binghamtonian too. I think the secret is the marinade, which must include bay leaf and kosher salt. It's really quite simple. If you want the recipe for Espedatas a la Portuguese, e-mail me.

Hey, c'mon now, folks....take it easy. Remember, the man has four small children.... Being from Massachusetts, I've heard of speidies, but have never had it. The name sounds Greek. Can anyone lend some insight as to what the missing ingredient(s) might be? The impassioned outrage to this recipe has really piqued my curiosity!

There were tears on my pillow ( I mean grill ), after I tested this recipe. Many Sunday afternoons I have longed for a speidie, foundation of my youth in Johnson City, and alas I thought I had found holy grail with this recipe. I should have been tipped off by the vegetable and pita bread hint. Blasphemous! If I'm not mistaken, it is illegal in Binghamton to use the word vegetable and speidie in the same sentence. Charlie better start running....

this was a good recipe but i was disappointed that it didn't leap out and yell "speidies!" to me. haven't had one in probably 30 years. in separate baggies, i marinated both lamb and chicken--and please note that he said more than once, that the veggies and pita bread were optional. i too served it on slices of italian bread. but what i'd like to know is how to improve this recipe? i haven't figured out just what is missing from this recipe...

I have to agree with the cook from Binghamton. I too grew up in the Binghamton area and lived on speidies during the summer. It would be unheard of to grill speidies with vegetables and serve in pita pockets. Also, anyone that's ever had a speidie knows that the trick is marinate the meat for a minimum of 24 hours and preferably longer. This recipe is for a basic marinated kebob - and should not be confused with a speidie.

This recipe really upsets me. I was shocked to come across it on this web site, because spiedies (a very regional specialty) are virtually unknown outside the southern tier area of upstate New York where I am from. Spiedies are fabulous food, but this is not a fabulous recipe. Charlie is right -- most people don't make their own spiedie marinade, because only a chosen few know how to work that secret magic which is the difference between the truly incredible spiedie and ordinary grilled chicken, lamb etc. Unfortunately, Charlie is not one of those people. If you want to try spiedies, order the marinade online from Lupo's or Caber Bros. Marinades (www.spiedies.com or http://bridgeware-systems.com/caber/), marinate your meat for 24-72 hours minimum, cook it on the GRILL, and serve them in a slice of Italian bread. This is how it is done. Pita bread and vegetables have nothing to do with the original spiedie sandwich. If you try this recipe you will probably not be impressed and no doubt wonder "so what's the big deal about spiedies?", but if you take my advice you'll understand quite well. I hope you do. You'll love them. I promise.
