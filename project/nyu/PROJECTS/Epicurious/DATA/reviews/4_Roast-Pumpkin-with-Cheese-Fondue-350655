I loved this recipe, with the previously noted additions of white wine and garlic flavored croutons. Has anyone ever tried this with a squash, say Blue Hubbard? Pumpkins, esp sugar pumpkins, are gone from the markets, and I want to serve this at Thanksgiving.

I have made this several times and each time it has been a hit. It is great just as stated. There are a couple of variations that are also quite good. A sugar or pie pumpkin has the best flavor. Rub the inside of the pumpkin with honey to add a little sweetness. I cut the bread into 1" square croutons for easier serving. I layer the bread and the cream and then add an healthy drizzle of honey to each layer. After baking according to directions. I line a slow cooker with foil. I ease the cooked pumpkin into the slow cooker and cook on low another 60-90 minutes. This gets the pulp soft and tender. Serve a scoop of pulp with the cheese fondue. My sister said "leave it to you to make pumpkin taste good". Even those that don't think they like pumpkin enjoyed this.

Quick to prepare, easy to make and was a huge hit at our dinner last night. Everyone loved it when I took the pumpkin out of the oven and lifted the lid to show the bubbling cheese inside. In fact I did the lid lifting a few more times it was so impressive. I used a 3.5 lb pumpkin (thinking I was making it for 5 people) and it only took one hour to bake. Turns out four more people showed and it was still plenty. I didn't experience the weird burning smell everyone else mentioned. In fact, everytime I opened the oven it smelled sweet like pumpkin pie. The top outside burned just like a roasted pepper but the inside was untouched. Definitely gonna make the larger pumpkin version for an upcoming holiday party.

So very good! The pumpkin started to smell odd (burnt?) about 30 minutes into baking and I started to get worried. But, I read the reviews and stuck with the baking temperature and it worked really well. I actually ended up using both a 4 lb and a 5 lb sugar pumpkin. We had bought a bit extra and had enough to fill 2 small ones. A huge hit at the party.

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe and has become one of our family's Thanksgiving standards. Last year we went on a looong walk while it was cooking and returned to find that the skin was black! No problem, every bit of that pumpkin was devoured!

One more thing...my oven runs hot, so I roast it a little longer at a lower temp. The first time I made it, my pumpkin got a little too dark, but a lower slower roasting time/temp helps with the roasting of the actual pumpkin flesh.

I've made this every year since the recipe was first issued. Every year it is fantastic. You have to make sure you use a Pie Pumpkin, or a Sugar Pumpkin, in order to get amazing pumpkin flavor, also salt the inside of your pumpkin very generously. This year I used all my chicken stock in a soup, so I used a local Fall beer (Otter Creek) instead of the chicken stock and it was FANTASTIC!! Hey, use a pumpkin from your local Farmer's Market too, I bet those will be way better than one from the grocery store!! I know mine was!

Spectacular, but you need to use a flavourful pumpkin if you want it to taste of more than just unctuous gooey cheese and bread (not a bad taste at all, mind, and well worth striving for). I've made this twice, once following the recipe exactly using a McPumpkin from the supermarket, and it was really, really good. The next time, I used a hideous thing from our farmer's market, with lumps and warts and a grey skin, and tried the suggestions for a salt, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg and garlic spice rub, with a little chipotle added in, and did croutons instead of slices of bread. It was divine, just the perfect food, and I'm salivating just remembering it.

Rating: 2
The flavor was pretty good, but the texture of the cheese mixture in the center makes this a thoroughly unimpressive dish. I expected a creamy, fondue-like filing. Instead, it was more like a pumpkin filled with cheesy bread. Perhaps using breadcrumbs, or at least removing the bread crusts, would help.

Update to my previous review -- this time I used a larger pie pumpkin and aggressively seasoned it w/ a spice rub of S,P, cinnamon, nutmeg, and chopped garlic. I also cooked the filled pumpkin at 320 for 2.5 hours. It came out a gorgeous burnished color with the cheese mix puffing out the top. And the pumpkin was richly flavored w/ a luscious texture. 8 of us finished off a 6# pumpkin. We served it with sliced apples and toasted baguettes.

Heres the rest of my review: (had to split it up because Epi doesnt like long reviews) 6. You dont want to transfer the hot pumpkin out of its baking dish to serve it, so bake it in a pretty baking dish or pyrex pie plate. The pumpkin skin isnt exciting to eat (though its probably edible) so diners will need knife and fork to eat this dish. 7. I do recommend making croutons of the bread, instead of slices. I layered croutons and cheeses and then poured liquid in until it was just showing near the top. Leave a little room to expand at the top  the filling will puff up and get brown on top after you remove the top of the pumpkin. 8. The dish works better with pumpkins at least 4  5 pounds in size. A really small pumpkin (like to serve only hubby and me) has a very small cavity which makes it difficult to fill. 9. Amounts for a 4-5 pound pumpkin: no more than one baguette (probably less), 2  2.5 cups of grated cheese and 2 - 2.5 cups of liquid. Two of these easily served 16 women as main dish at a luncheon, with salad and bread, (and appetizers and dessert). 10. Overall, this is a festive fall dish that makes a dramatic presentation for a special occasion and it was successful for my daughters shower . The filling is yummy but even though I used sugar pumpkins from a local farm stand, the pumpkin didnt have a lot of flavor, so I ended up rating it only a three.

I made this dish twice experimentally, then served it over Thanksgiving-weekend at my vegetarian daughters baby shower. Here's what I learned: 1. It can be bland, so use liberal amounts of salt, garlic and nutmeg for flavor, and maybe other things (the suggestions for carmelized shallots and cayenne pepper have appeared in reviews since I last checked the site  Id use one or both ideas next time. Also might try adding crumbled cooked bacon if not making it for vegetarians.) 2. Dont substitute for the heavy cream  you need it for flavor. 3. The main flavor comes from the cheese, so choose well. I used Gruyere and Jarlsberg because my store didnt have any Emmental. 4. Do substitute white wine for some (maybe even all) of the broth 5. It is crucial for the pumpkin to get fully cooked, but its hard to check for doneness because if you poke into it, some of the liquidy filling runs out the hole. You can press on the side of the pumpkin with the back of a large spoon to see if its tender. Also look for the burnished color of the pumpkin. If it has not turned darker in color, it definitely is not done yet. I used sugar pumpkins, approx 4 to 5 lbs each, and pre-cooked them in the microwave for five minutes after they were hollowed out, but before I stuffed them. After stuffing them, I baked them at 425 for an hour and a quarter  with tops removed for the last 45 minutes, and even then one of the three was not as done as I would have liked. I would not recommend lowering the temperature at all.

Rating: 3
I actually served the "fondue" right out of the pumpkin, thus the presentation was a conversation starter. The bread I used was a bit hard, but I was pleasantly surprised by how soft it was thanks to the cream mixture. I would probably trade the emmental cheese for mozzerella.

This was amazing! I made it as a Thanksgiving Day appetizer and it was a huge hit. Not only was it gorgeous and festive, it tasted amazing. Even members of my family who don't like pumpkin tried it and thought it was delicious. I've already been asked to make it again. I wouldn't change a think about the recipe!

Rating: 3
The filling was spectacular, unbelievably delicious. I didn't use broth and instead used white wine in its place. I added garlic to the bread and make it more like croutons instead of toasts. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper to the cream sauce. My problem was the pumpkin. I used a 5# pie pumpkin, filled it almost to the top, and baked for 1.5 hours at 400. The flesh was soft and cooked, but it was light in flavor and stringy in texture. I seasoned the pumpkin flesh liberally w/ S,P and garlic before filling, but that didn't seem to work. Did I use the wrong pumpkin?

Rating: 4
I have made this about 4 times and it is just wonderful. The only modification that I made, was that I bake it about 3 or 4 hours at 300. Cooking it at a lower temperture brings allows the pumpkin flesh to become very soft. I serve this as an appetizer on crostini. I tell the guests to be sure to scrape some of the pumpkin flesh on the crostini to enjoy with the fondue. The sweetness of the pumpkin goes so well with the fondue.

Rating: 4
this was a hit! i took some of the other reviewers' suggestions like subbing wine for half of the broth. i also made stovetop croutons with herbs and garlic out of the bread, and added carmelized shallots to the cream mixture. i couldn't find a small enough pumpkin so i had to use a 14 pounder, but it turned out fine. the presentation is very nice - beautiful and dramatic. great for a party.

Rating: 3
Not quite as spectacular as I had hoped and expected after reading the reviews, but good nonetheless. I also used 1/2 wine for the broth and added garlic, both of which I loved and would definitely recommend. I used an acorn squash because it's just me and my husband, and also because there were no pumpkins at the store. I have to admit that if I made this again, I wouldn't worry about using super-high quality cheese; I think an average swiss would be fine, and a single variety as well. I tried blending the leftovers with broth as suggested by another reviewer, and it came out pretty well for a simple lunch the next day. I would lean toward making this as an appetizer served with crudités and crackers rather than the main course. Oh also, because I had extra filling ingredients after I filled the squash, I layered them as directed into a bowl and nuked it for about 10 minutes on 50% power, and lo and behold it was actually pretty good. I munched on that with some baby carrots waiting for the real thing to bake. ha

This was delicious but didn't get completely gobbled up. It was so rich and I didn't have that many guests. The pumpkin got a little watery after roasting and kind of mushed up the fondue.

Absolutely outstanding. Substituting 1/2 cup wine for 1/2 broth was key. You can taste a hint of the wine that adds a little more complexity to the flavor. Delicious!

Rating: 3
Very good. I didn't have any of the problems with the oven temperature either. I took the top off the pumpkin for the last few minutes to help thicken the cheese/cream mixture based on suggestions. Also think the 1/2 chicken stock 1/2 white wine was brilliant. My only complaint was that the nutmeg was a little strong. Maybe it's because I used pretty fresh nutmeg but it kind of overpowered the whole recipe. I think I'd cut it back to 1/4 tsp. in the future. Takes a while to bake but really nice. Went really well with some chicken sausages.

I made this recipe last year for my little sister's birthday, and it got such rave reviews that I'm making it for four different dinner parties in November (I refuse to make it any other time of the year, or we'd all die!). I make about a half recipe in a 3 or 4 lb sugar pumpkin.

Rating: 0
I didn't make the recipe exactly as suggested, but it was so great I wanted to share: I omitted the bread and added ~6oz raclette cheese and 1 T cornstarch to the mixture and baked the pumpkin to be enjoyed as an appetizer fondue/cheese dip. Before serving, I started scraping pumpkin into the melted cheese mixture, and more could also be scraped from the sides or those who wanted more pumpkin. It was mostly eaten with baguette and Epicurious Spiced Pumpkin-Seed Flatbread for dipping. It was beautiful and completely devoured by the end of the party!

This was GREAT! I made 3 small ones LAST year & sent 1 home w/ my daughter & 1 w/ our grandkids. When grandkids came back, they begged & pleaded for more, but pumkins were out of season by then. I WILL make this again! Great way to get kids to eat more good foods! Even the grandson who ONLY likes candy & junk food!

I was going to make this using smaller sugar pumpkins (thought individual pumpkins would make for a great presentation), but I had to substitute with a regular pumpkin at the last minute. I followed the recipe, but I cooked for one hour with the lid on, then another 20 minutes without the lid. I would have liked to cook longer to get more puffiness with the filling, but the pumpkin was done and I was worried it would collapse with more cooking. This turned out GREAT. I ladeled into bowls and then carved sections from the top so that it never fell into itself and spilled into the roasting pan. Everyone loved this, and the pumpkin roasted nicely. I brushed olive oil inside when I seasoned it, as well as outside, which made for a nice crisp.

I had a Iron Chef Squash Party at my house and made this! I got raved reviews and it took second place over someone making butternut squash risotto with bacon. I think it was the bacon that got everyone's vote:) Certainly will make this again and again! The flavors were wonderful and the pumpkin gave it unique flavors and a beautiful presentation!

I made this for my Sunday "supper club". Usually the same people that are in my running club, so I wasn't sure how this would be received (high calorie). Well, I shouldn't have worried... it was devoured. It turned out beautifully, though a bit of a mess. I think having very high quality cheese makes a huge difference, I got mine from the cheese counter at Whole Foods - it was worth the cost. I wouldn't change a thing.

Sooo good. I added some ground chipotle as well for some heat. We had leftovers, so I pureed them with good chicken stock into a soup, which was fabulous.

This was not very good. And certainly not worth the calories. I'm not unwilling to make and eat rich foods but they really need to taste good. I rubbed the toasts with a cut clove of garlic. Even this didn't help with the blandness. Maybe some mustard mixed into the cream would help? The idea and presentation are good ones but the recipe needs some major revisions for me to ever make this again.

Frankly this couldn't have turned out to be more of a mess, but the hilarious look on my Italian boyfriend's face when he saw the half-burnt, half-raw, runny-fondue-filled pumpkin come out of the oven was absolutely worth it... basically the whole thing cooked unevenly, probably because I could only find a "fairytale pumpkin" here and it was oddly-shaped. Will definitely try again because it sounds like it could be so good -- but with lower oven temp and a properly shaped pumpkin...

This came out fantastic for me with a few modifications. The purists among you may complain, but the dish really was superb and in my view these were only minor changes which enhanced the recipe. I substituted a Pinot Grigio for half of the stock, and as I'm not keen on soggy bread, I used a day old baguette to make large garlic croutons instead of just toasted bread. I tossed chunks cut from the baguette with olive oil, crushed garlic and a little salt before toasting them in the oven. My pumpkin was smaller than called for (about the size of your average honeydew melon), so I roasted at 325 for a little more than an hour and increased the temp at the end to maybe 375. I took inspiration from kstancik and took the 'lid' off for the last 20 minutes or so and the top layers browned nicely (the lid came out really nutty and tasty too). I served it up by letting it rest a few moments, then cutting large wedges which I was able to spoon into wide bowls. Really pretty coming out of the oven, and in the bowls. The garlic and wine really worked well to bring out the 'fondue' flavours from the filling and the pumpkin was lovely, tender and hearty. Perfect early winter meal!

Four forks for presentation- it was a work of art. Followed recipe exactly, and no one at Thanksgiving went for seconds. Boring. Nutmeg overwhelmed everything, and the flavors didn't seem to mesh. I really like pumpkin, but it was bland and a little acidic. Love gruyere, and you couldn't discern the flavor. I wish Ruth Reichl would rework the recipe, since it was hers.

I am making this tonight for the third time. It is amazing. I used 1/2 and 1/2 and subsitute allspice for the nutmeg. I served it with chicken sausages and a huge salad. This is really one of those dishes that makes you look like an amazing cook, even though you have done very little.

Woah - this is an incredibly good thing! I don't think I've ever had a more delicious pumpkin before. Next time I'd try it with white wine, as other reviewers suggested. It's rich, even though I had an extra small pumpkin and only about a third of the other ingredients fit in, it fed three people for dinner. Teenage daughter loved it, too!!

Fantastic idea and easy to execute. I used emmenthaler and fontina in a 3-lb. red kuri squash and it was divine. Eyeballed the liquids at a 50/50 ratio just till I could see it peaking through the mounds of bread and cheese. Baked at 350 for two hours. The squash split about 45 minutes into it, but if this happens to you, don't despair: you really don't need the liquid you'll lose, and any cheese/bread that pours out will get lovely and crunchy and brown. Loved those parts so much I put the whole thing back minus the top and broiled it for 5 minutes to crisp up the rest. Perfect fall/winter meal, especially with a side of prosciutto and a good mustard.

THIS IS AWESOME. We all kept giving it praise at the table. However, after reading the above reviews I changed the recipe - and it was perfect. I decreased the amount of liquid, using only one cup of cream and 3/4 cup of white wine in place of the chicken broth. I used two smaller pumpkins and roasted them at 400 for an hour, then increased the temp to 425 for about another 10 - 15 minutes. I'm thinking that I will want to make this at times other than when pumpkins are available, and it would probably be great made in individual acorn squashes!

Friends of ours bought this over the other night as an appetizer for our impromptu dinner party. It was Fabulous! They were testing it out to make for Thanksgiving. Since it was so delicious, we'll be having it on our Table as well. It is absolutely stunning, visually and it tastes Heavenly. They did say that it smoked up their house, so I may try cooking it at 400º for a bit longer.

LOVED it! Only change I made was to use Jarlsburg cheese instead of the Gruyere. When looking for the right size pumpkin, it's about the size of a bowling ball. I baked mine in a pretty ceramic pie dish, so I served it without having to move it into a different plate. Rave reviews, I'll be making this for Thanksgiving appetizers.

Just made this and served it for dinner with sliced flank steak and spinach/tomato salad - yum! Followed the recipe exactly with exception of using regular chicken broth which, along with the salt called for seemed just right. Also, when I ran out of toasted baguette slices and need a few more to fill the space, I used a hunk of stale french bread that I cut in slices -it seemed to do the trick. I baked it at 450 F for about 70 minutes in a stainless steel baking dish - the pumpkin was glossy and tender and the "fondue" a good consistency. The leftovers will go fast - the whole family gave it 4 stars (picky eaters, too!)

Rating: 3
I halved the recipe and used a smaller pumpkin. I also tried to reduce the amount of cream: I used about 1/4 cup of cream and the balance of the liquid was milk. But when I cut the pumpkin, a lot of the milk ran out. I think one way to make it lower in fat but not runny would be to use just a little milk to moisten the bread. Like the other reviewers, I thought that 450 was too high, and my smoke alarm went off. So next time I might try 400 degrees. But it did taste good.

Rating: 2
the bread needs to be well toasted as it can get soggy in the baking process. Be liberal with the salt and pepper as the pumpkin itself can be rather bland. The dish is a show-stopper!! John in New York

This recipe has a few problems, and I had a sneaking suspicion as I preheated the oven last night. 450 degrees for 90 minutes like the recipe calls for would have produced a cremated pumpkin... after only being in the oven for 4 minutes at 450, my oven started smoking. So, I turned it down to 350, and let it go for the whole 90 minutes. Once done, it looked gorgeous, but the pumpkin was not tender enough to eat. The filling was delicious, rich, and more than enough for 8 people.

Rating: 4
This was delicious - definitely exceeded expectations, and a great festive centerpiece or side dish. After reading other reviews about how rich it was, I used whole milk instead of heavy cream, and think you would be fine w/ lowfat milk even. Also, I used 2 small pumpkins (was what we had left over from Halloween decorations), and just divided the filling b/w them.

I LOVE this recipe! I made it as an appetizer for a party and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe as is, except I didn't have emmental, so I substituted a different high quality swiss cheese. The flavor didn't seem to be sacrificed by the substitution. The only difficulty I encountered was removing the roasted pumpkin from the roasting pan into a serving dish. My pumpkin had split during roasting so it was difficult to lift without losing a little of the filling. Next time I make this recipe I will watch it closer in the oven and hopefully remove it before any splitting occurs.

Rating: 4
Very good. I also found the fondue a little runny so I stuck it back in the oven for a little while with the pumpkin top removed. Also next time, I might incorporate a small amount of lightly cooked garlic, or rub the inside of the pumpkin with cut garlic. Will also try cooking at a lower heat for longer as suggested.

Very tasty! I just made this as an appetizer for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. Each person got a small plate with scooped-out pumpkin and fondue. The pumpkin looks beautiful and impressive when it comes out of the oven. The flavor combination of the pumpkin and fondue is what everyone liked most. I made just one small change. I used regular chicken broth instead of low- sodium broth, but then skipped adding the salt later in the recipe. Also, I did not have any bread or cheese left over (despite what the recipe says).

What a beautiful dish to serve company! I served it as an appetizer, and it was plenty for 8 adults (with a bit left for a snack another day). Everyone loved it. Because we're trying to watch our fat intake, I used regular milk instead of the cream. It turned out to be a bit too runny as another reviewer noted. I'll try it with a little less liquid next time, and there will definitely be several next times!

I've made this twice so far. My first attempt the pumpkin got too dark on the outside and a little too firm on the inside,and the fondue was a little runny. The flavor is amazing though. The second time I reduced the temp and roasted for a half hour longer. This time the pumpkin flesh was just right and the fondue was still a bit runny, but delicious nonetheless. We ate it for dinner with salad one night and as a snack with pumpkin beer. I'll be making it again for Thanksgiving, it's so good.
