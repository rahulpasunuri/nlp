Made this for Easter dinner tonight, and it was exceptional. I used a semi-boned leg of lamb that was 2lbs and cooked it for about 55 minutes. It was delicious and earned the highest praise from my husband.

This is some of the best lamb I've every made. I couldn't find spanish onions so I used a red onion and cut back on the salt. This was easy and oh so good! Everyone loved it.

This is my all time favorite leg of lamb recipe! Sliced the leg ans served family style over a basic ridotto! Pure deliciousness to have the onions and tomatoes dripping into the risotto! Paired well with a strong Merlot (which isnt typically my favorite wine) and a basic arugula salad.

Excellent. Best lamb recipe I have tried to date. My only changes were 1) doubled the garlic 2)let the mustard mixture sit on the lamb for a few hours before cooking 3) reduced the honey by 1/2.

This really is a fantastic recipe, probably my best find from this site. I couldn't get hold of spanish onions so used red onions instead - delicious. Also I used vine tomatoes, quartered - sweet and gorgeous. What I love about this is that it goes so well with simple vegetables like mashed potato and sauteed spinach. Have made twice already and will definitely make regularly!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it was still delicious. My boneless leg of lamb was only about 4lbs, but I followed the recipe amounts for the marinade for the meat. I used whole fresh vine ripened cherry tomatoes and I also had some left over leek, shallots and white onion that I combined with the spanish onions and herbs. Because I had more veges, I gauged the amount of marinade for the veges by sight and used more than the recipe. Roasted as per recipe instructions and it came out perfectly pink! There was a lot of pan juices, which I strained and thickened to make a gravy. My dinner party guests raved about this dish, so easy, so yummy!

I'm throwing a dinner party just so I can show off with this!!! I bought a leg at Wegman's, and asked them to cut it in half because a whole one was too big. But I didn't cut the other ingredients in half. I tend to overgarlic things; so, I used three times the garlic than the recipe calls for. AMAZING and really delicious.

Absolutely wonderful. Made this for a dinner party, and got raves. And it was so easy!

Agree with all the rave reviews. Such a delicious meal. I used New Zealand Spring Lamb which I find so flavourful to begin with, without adding anything to it so the dijon dressing was nice, but didn't add a tonne of interest for me. However, the onion/tomato "sauce" is simply amazing! If I was using Ontario Lamb the dijon dressing would definitely add something. Strongly recommend this recipe. Really not that tough either.

Remember to shear the lamb before slaughter, otherwise, the wool becomes unusable.

I had never seen a recipe with such unanimous rave reviews, so I just had to try it. I made half of a semi boneless let, just to try it out before making it for a larger dinner party. The only problem with it is that it is so good it may not feed as many people as you think, unless you serve a lot of other dishes! It is hard to stop eating it.

This Ina Garten's recipe for leg of lamb comes out succulent and with depth of flavour that I did not think was possible in such a short amount of "cooking time". I have followed the recipe to a t and it was wonderful served with garlic mashed potatoes and the sauce. Impressive results with very little effort will make your guests think you truly are a gourmet cook! It is even great the next day warmed up if you are lucky enough to have leftovers.

I made this with chicken instead of lamb to test it out. First night I thought: Not bad - but don't know if I'd make this again. Second night..very tasty. Gotta try it with lamb. Sauce has a nice tang due to the mustard..and how can you go wrong with with slow roasted tomatoes (my favorite) and, of course...onions.

I wonder where I went wrong, with all the raves. Perhaps I used a pan that was too small, so that the veggie mixture was 3/4 up the side of the bone in lamb leg. I missed the crispiness of the outside of a leg of lamb that I love so much. One thing I did that was a hit with the diners was to reduce the pan drippings and serve as a kind of sauce.

Easy, quick and delicious. Leg of lamb was pretty pricey, so we bought a lamb shank (about 1.5lbs), 450 for 20mins and then 350 for 30mins. Cut all the ingredients in half. A bit salty, so would cut that even more, but otherwise very good.

Exceptional - easy, delicious and it has inspired me to have another dinner party!

The store didn't have leg of lamb so I used lamb shank instead. Meat tasted great and the sauce was great, but the texture was awful. Next time I'll order a leg.

Had to use dried instead of fresh rosemary and stone-ground vs. dijon mustard. But turned out very nice. My guests loved it. It was a great dinner party entree. I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. Easy.

My local grocer only had boneless leg, and ti worked well. The recipe is indeed easy and I'd make it again for a special occasion.

Delicious! Variation: I made this with cut-up chicken also, and it is just as good.

Ditto, ditto, ditto again. This was one of the most delicous dishes I've ever made. Company raved...easy...can't say enough stuff about how good it was. Added the potatoes...yum

Made it with boneless leg (straight from costco), canned diced tomatoes (3 15 oz cans) and dried thyme. Cut way down on salt, pefect. Served over noodles.

Wonderful and easy. Made it for Christmas Day with simple roasted veg and mashed potato. Next time, I will add more tomato around the pan. We ran out of sauce for the leftovers. And also buy it without the bone so it's easier to carve.

made this for christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. Used boneless lamb for ease, threw in fingerling potatoes near the end as other reviewers suggested.

OMG-this recipe is fabulous! I followed directions to the tee and all came out perfect...although, I would recommend a longer cooking time for those who don't like meat so rare. Also, liked other reviewers, I added fingerling potatoes. The result was delicious and had the table asking for the recipe! Next time, I think will try it with boneless...just for simplicity's sake.

One of the best lamb dishes we have ever made, and surprisingly easy! It actually ends up kind of like a stew when the lamb is sliced and the vegetables/sauce is poured over it. We followed the previous user's review and added potatoes during the last 40 minutes - perfect. Served it with Epicurious' Honey-Roasted Pear Salad with Thyme Verjus Dressing and both were a huge hit among the friends we had for dinner. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!!

This recipe was exceptional, the mustard and honey combined to a perfect crust on the lamb and the tomatoes and herbs were delicious. I halved some yellow potatoes and threw them in for the last 40 minutes or so. Will definitely use this recipe again.
