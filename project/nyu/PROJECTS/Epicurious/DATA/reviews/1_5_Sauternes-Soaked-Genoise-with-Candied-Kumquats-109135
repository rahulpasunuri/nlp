I'm in the same boat as the previous poster. I also found it in the new cookbook and made it for an Easter gathering. The friend who asked me to bring dessert has a large kumquat tree, so it made sense to utilize the resources. It looked terrific, but was profoundly disappointing in taste.

I saw this in the _Gourmet Cookbook_ and thought, "Wow! That's a definite for my next tea party." It was easy to make, but I strongly recommend using (a) a standing mixer, and (b) a Magic Cake strip. The result was handsome enough (though I forgot to top with the almonds), but the taste was just not winning. The genoise tasted very eggy, and the $12 worth of sauternes kind of amplified it, I think. I had a lot left over. In sum, I found it underwhelming for such an expensive project.
