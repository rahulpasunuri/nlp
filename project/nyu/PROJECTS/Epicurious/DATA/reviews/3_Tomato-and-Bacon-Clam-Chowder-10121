I'm getting ready to make this for the second time. This time, I'm making extra to freeze. It's very good and very easy.

This was good because it is different than the run of the mill clam chowder. It was a nice change

This was delicious and fairly easy to make. Clams here are always fresh, so there was no clam liquor or juice to be had, so I substituted mirin and nam ploy fish sauce, and it turned out really well. I also added scallops and crab, which fit in well, but turned the soup into more of a stew.

clients loved it, they want it again for their soup at dinner
