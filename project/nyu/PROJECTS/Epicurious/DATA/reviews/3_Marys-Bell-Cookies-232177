Meh - I make 20-30 kinds of cookies for the holidays, and these don't make the cut. Lots of work for something that just wasn't that special

A similar recipe has been in my family for years. We use cinnamon instead of ginger (but I think the ginger would give the cookies an added punch) and butter instead of shortening. We don't use the instant coffee/espresso powder, but that could only add good taste to the recipe. They are great cookies, but a tad labor intensive. They would look pretty on any table and they're great for a cookie exchange. Candied cherries instead of the marachino also work for the clappers.
