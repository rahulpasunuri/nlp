Excellent recipe. I added a couple of ingredients to make this a very sophisticated offering. I roasted carrots tossed in olive oil until dark spots began to appear, then pureed them with a bit of butter, salt, white pepper and Greek yogurt. The long (thick) cod pieces were cut in half and placed on either side of the escarole on the plate. The fish was napped with Beurre blanc and the roasted carrot puree layered on the side. The sweetness of the carrots play well with the slight tartness of the beurre blanc and the escarole. Also, the color combination is very beautiful. The reviews were stellar.

Instead of escarole, I mistakenly bought and used radicchio. It was bitter (the radicchio) and so would the escarole from what I read. Make sure that is the taste you are going for with his recipe. My husband likes sour but who likes bitter? Vegetarians maybe? The salmon was ok but not the est I eer had (got that right) I served with Wild Rice with Wild mushrooms (on this site) which is excellant. Won't make this again although I don't want to rate it too low and bring down the rating forthosewho like the bitter taste. (Thinking this is a small group though).

i followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. i used salmon and the skin was so crisp and delicious. I pared this with the Asian Glazed Salmon glaze before putting in oven and it worked out nicely. will absolutely make again.

I made this with Salmon, and served with the Miso glaze from Miso Glazed Sea Bass also on this site. It was INSANE. This method makes the salmon delicious, it tastes like a salmon skin roll sushi.

The previous reviewer has mistaken the purpose of salting the fish. Although some salt may season the fish, the main purpose is to tighten the flesh of the fish and create a denser, chewy texture. As long as the fish is rinsed thoroughly before cooking (as the recipe suggests), the added salt will be minimal. This recipe is simple, delicious and healthy, even for those with sodium-sensitive hypertension. Happy eating!
