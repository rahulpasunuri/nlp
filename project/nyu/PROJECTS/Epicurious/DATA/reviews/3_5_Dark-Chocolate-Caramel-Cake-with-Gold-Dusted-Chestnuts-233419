I don't know why some folks think this is a huge amount of work. I had it all made and assembled in less than three hours, and without an inordinate amount of washing up to do. There is no need to chill the ganache overnight, just chill it until it is set enough to spread. The glaze makes for a lovely presentation, even without gilded chestnuts. Everybody loved it. I may adapt a few things the next time I make it, but as written this works just fine. I used the roasted chestnuts now available in foil bags, often found in kosher markets for some reason.

I made changes to this recipe so I won't rate it, but wanted to offer my variation, which I thought was quite delicious. I made the cake in 2 9"-round pans, split them in half, and brushed them with the syrup. I only made half of the caramel-chocolate ganache recipe. I made the bittersweet cream glaze, but omitted the extra sugar and water (used the Cake Bible recipe). I also made a half recipe of the Chestnut Whipped Cream from the Cake Bible. I layered one cake half, topped with a thin layer of chocolate-caramel, topped with another cake half, topped with all the chestnut whipped cream, topped with the third cake half, spread the rest of the chocolate-caramel, topped with the final cake half, then covered with whole thing with bittersweet chocolate glaze. The bittersweet chocolate and whipped cream helped balance the extreme sweetness of the cake and chocolate-caramel. I would make my variation again, but would not make the recipe as printed because it's so sweet.

For those looking for gold, try an art supply store. In the gilding section. Gold is edible in small quantity, you will find gold dust or extremely thin gold leaves. This gold is no different from the one you could find elsewhere.

Although time consuming, my family loved it. Therefore, it is on my list of fav recipes for special occasions. I kept a close eye on the layers, and they were moist and delicious. Finding the chestnut spread was only difficult in that many people working at the stores did not know that they DID have it, and in which isle it could be found. Looking forward to sharing it again this holiday season!

This is a great cake but I concur, it's quite time-consuming. I also made a few modifications to cut down the cost: no gold dust, no brandy syrup, and no chestnuts inbetween layers. In retrospect, it definitely could have stood for the brandy syrup, as the cake layers were a bit dry (also baked them in 2x 9" round pans, so that could've contributed.) It is definitely worth another shot, though. I'll try this one again, with the brandy syrup, however.

I think that my dinner guests would have fainted if they knew how much this cake cost to bake and how difficult is was to find all the ingredients. I live in the Los Angeles area, where we have many specialty food markets, and I ended up having my mother bring me the chestnut spread from Arizona. I never did find the gold dust,and I called no less than 5 stores. I don't mind spending the money for the highest quality ingredients, but the end result should taste like it! Like other cooks reported, I have made just as difficult and costly recipies before, and I just felt that the end result wasn't worth it. My guests enjoyed it, but I wouldn't make it again.

Thanks to the lady from Venice for her advice on ganache. I did not put any butter in it, and it was fine: thick, dark and beautiful. I found that keeping the glaze on the hob for good 10 minutes after adding chocolate made the colour deep, but would agree with others that ganache without butter can work as a glaze as well. Chestnuts are dispensable to my mind, apart from the decoration. I think that the ganache is the best and most useful part of this recipe, and will use it for other cakes.

I made this cake for a Thanksgiving party, and it was a huge hit, although definitely a pain to find the ingredients and assemble. I ended up finely chopping the nuts in a food processor to spread between the layers of the cake, and next time I will do the same thing (maybe with pralines?) but ice either side of the layers with ganache to hold the cake together better. I agree with the other cooks that the chocolate glaze is unnecessary, and will just finish the cake with the ganache next time.

Next time I make this recipe I will make a few changes - the addition of orange zest to the cake batter should complement the flavors, I will use either a chopped praline between the layers or finely chopped toasted walnuts, and a thinner, more pourable glaze (I'm sure I have a recipe somewhere in my archives!). Loved the cake, it was beautiful.

I made this cake for Christmas, and had some of the same problems as the other reviewers. The cake was pretty, but for the the amount of money(about $50) and time I spent, it was not worth it. I went to three specialty food stores, and no one had ever heard of gold dust, let alone have it in stock, so I poured the glaze over the chestnuts, and then sprinkled them with red sugar. I was not able to detect any benefit to having the chestnuts spread in-between the cake layers. My sister was able to detect the different types of frosting, but I don't think the glaze added anything except expense and time. The next time I see a recipe that requires that much expensive chocolate - I will bypass it.

I have made more impressive cakes, and more time-consuming, and more complicated, but not more expensive. The ganache had a spectacular caramel flavour and I would like to have been able to taste it. All that came through was the chocolate glaze. And the puree in the body of the cake was lost as well. If I HAD to do it again, I would leave the glaze off and use the ganache as the final enrobing. There were lovely delicate flavours that were just overpowered, making the cake just not worth it to me, especially at a cost of $50. Looks like a lot of us found this one here for Christmas dinner.

Absolutely agree with all the other reviews. Fantastically beautiful and delicious cake. Everyone at dinner said it was the most delicious cake they had ever eaten! It is a very big time commitment...I have not been to pastry school - if I had a candy thermometer it would have been easier to judge if the caramel was on track. Same comments as the other review on the ganache, I realized taking it out of the fridge directly was not going to work and put it in the microwave. I was too late to find edible gold dust, so dipped the chestnuts in cocoa powder for a similar, but clearly less pretty effect.

I totally agree that this cake is a commitment! I've been to cooking school, too, (although culinary, not pastry), and this saved me from a half-disaster. The cake looks beautiful, although the glaze does NOT come out as 'shiny' as in the picture. Keep in mind that the recipe is written assuming everyone already knows how to bake & work with chocolate. For instance, the fact that the 'overnight refrigerated ganache' should be brought back to room temperature (do it in the microwave, by the way, 20 sec. at a time) before spreading it on the cake, is taken for granted. Also, unless you're used to make it, it's always better to use a candy thermometer when making caramel, and the recipe should mention the temperature to reach. Bottom line: good recipe, 'impressive' look, but if it's intended for every Bon Appetit-inspired baker, details should not be given for granted!

Delicious, but a comitment. I've been to pastry school and new how to organize my time. You'll save your self from hours in the kitchen if you make the ganache and glaze the day before (refridgerate ganache, and put it in a standing mixer with paddle attachment before you want to use it and just leave the glaze out, but covered -- it will be fine overnight.) Then you just have to make the cake and the brandy syrup. It's really good and a beautiful treat for the holidays. The gold dust is available at most specialty food/kitchen stores and is about $3.00 for a little container - it goes a long way.
