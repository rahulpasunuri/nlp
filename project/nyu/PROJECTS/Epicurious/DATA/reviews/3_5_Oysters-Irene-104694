This was delicious. These were very attractive and colourful. I almost gave the recipe a "4" but I think that it could use a little extra zing - possibly a dash of cayenne? We like crispy bacon so I cooked the bacon first, assembled the oysters and broiled them 9 inches from the broiler element for 7 minutes.

The ingredients in this recipe came together well. It also looked very pretty when I served it.
