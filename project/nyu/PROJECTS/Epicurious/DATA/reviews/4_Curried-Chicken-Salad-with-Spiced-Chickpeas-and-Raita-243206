As is, I think this recipe is only okay. The chicken did get mushy as other reviewers have said, and I found the chickpeas were too dry. I would have like to stew them to soften them up. But the flavor in the chicken is great - just skip the yogurt or mix it in right before serving. The raita is heavenly. The red grapes are a nice touch of sweetness and freshness. With some adaptations, this could be a very nice recipe. But it's not quite there yet as is.

This recipe is so delicious, with ingredients exactly as written. BUT--to avoid the mushy texture referred to by others, do not add any of the yogurt to the chicken salad. Instead, make extra raita and serve it as a topping. Use thick (Greek-style) yogurt, which holds up well to the cucumbers.

Absolutely LOVED this. Perfect picnic dish. I subbed sultanas for grapes since I didn't have any, and just mixed them right in to the salad. I'm glad I did. It keeps the dish from becoming too watery. I also added some fresh celery for crunch, and eyeballed the yogurt in the chicken mixture, not nearly as much as called for. I layered the chicken on the bottom, the chick peas, and then the raita. I think that also helps with the moisture. Also, be sure to take the seeds out of the cucumber - that keeps it crunchy. Am making again next weekend for a sailing trip.

I especially like the chickpeas, and I've made them by themselves for use on green salads. I've also served this dish hot (with cold raita on the side), and it was equally good.

Loved this recipe for lunches. To make it more lunch friendly, I put the Raita on the bottom, under the grapes to keep it from sogging out the chickpeas. I also moved the almonds to the chicken salad (excellent) and I added fresh green beans to the raita to up the veggie factor. Wonderful lunches for almost the entire week.

When I first read the recipe I was not thrilled by the grapes but after tasting it, it gives a great taste. It's an excellent recipe.

Very yummy! Made a few adjustments. Since many reviewers mentioned the mushiness of the chicken, and said the raita didn't add much, I omitted the raita, and instead used a layer of chopped cucumbers for a little crunchiness. In addition, I used extra chopped almonds, and mixed them into the chicken layer for extra crunch. With these changes, the texture was lovely, with little bursts of crunch. Lots of layers of flavor too. And pretty easy to put together. Will definitely make again!

Love this - have made many, many times. Skip the raita - it isn't needed and creates the mushiness others have complained about. For those of you who don't like cilantro (like myself) the recipe is just as good without. It is my go-to chicken salad recipe now.

Even in you're not picnicking, I highly recommend finding some glass bowls to layer and serve this salad in individual portionsit's beautiful, and truly adds to the enjoyment of the dish. I followed the recipe pretty much as is. Like many other reviewers, I probably will increase the spice amounts next time. To be fair, I wouldn't blame the recipe, but the fact that many of us probably have spices that are a bit old and faded in their potency. Don't skip the almonds, no matter what you dothey make a huge difference to the texture.

This was good.... but,.. i agree with another reviewer that the chicken mix was a bit "mushy" The chickpeas were amaze, i could eat a bowl of them on their own. So right now its a "perhaps" make again. oh, and it didn't seem long to prepare, about 45 min and everything was in the fridge cooling.

I thought this was a really great idea, and made all the parts and served together, however I didn't think the various parts contributed much to each other. The chicken curry recipe itself was delicious - well balanced and flavorful - but the other layers seemed extraneous. When I make this again I will make just the chicken curry and serve over grapes or cubes of mango, perhaps with rice as well.

Yum. I don't know how long it took to make this dish because I took a generous taste after each step. Every time I thought it was perfect until I reached the next one.

I made this exactly as printed, except doubled it and roasted chicken breasts and thighs (a la Ina) for the meat. Didn't use the jars, but displayed it on a large platter in layers with naan on the side and paired it with a fresh fruit salad and some lovely Sauvignon Blanc. Guests were fainting in ecstasy! (well, almost). Will make this again! And again!

Love this because it's a chicken salad recipe without mayonnaise. Plus, it's infinitely adaptable (leave out the grapes or almonds, switch around the herbs, mix everything together, etc. etc. etc.)

Rating: 4
I am a huge fan of this recipe. It takes a lot of prep but I like that everything can be done ahead of time. I have left out the grapes and/or almonds and it still tastes great. I also prefer cilantro in the raita instead of mint (but I love cilantro). If I don't have a rotisserie chicken, I have used chicken breasts and/or thighs and just cooked them in the oven first with some of the spices. I decreased the amount of yogurt in the chicken layer.

This is just terrific! It takes a lot of prep, but I've always found that when I've a made a recipe a few times it gets quicker and easier. I did double the ginger, garlic and cilantro, but that is a matter of taste. Also used half the cayenne because one of my guests is wary of "spicy" foods. I used a heaping half cup of 2% Greek yogurt in the salad and the same yogurt in the raita Finally, halved the salt in the raita because I thought it was not needed. I put a bed of red leaf lettuce on a big glass plate, piled the salad on that, sprinkled on the chickpeas and put the raita on that. Spread the grapes around the edge. It was very pretty, each layer slightly smaller that the one underneath. Everyone loved it. Even my sister, who is not fond of curry, thought it was wonderful. HIghly recommend this and will make it throughout the spring and summer.

I hate to be the voice of opposition but I really didn't like this at all. The chicken salad seemed very 'mushy' and something that should have been prepared as a warm dish not a cold salad. I ended up not making the raita and adding the mint and almonds to the chicken as well as the grapes (quartered) for texture. I also added raw chopped onion and more seasonings to liven it up. The chickpeas were good toasted in the oven.

I should add that I put way more ginger, onion, garlic than the recipe called for - to taste! use your taste!

I'm giving 3 forks - not as impressed - yet; giving another day to see if maybe the flavors marinated more. I followed recipe fairly close however, I agree with other reviewers to cut down the yogurt in the chicken salad part. I added too much I think. There are lots of flavors going on so your mouth gets alot stimulus! It does taste pretty good but there's something not quite right. I did not do the chickpeas - just didn't have any. I recommend in a pita. Tastes very healthy! oh, and this DOES take a while to make if you're shredding the chicken and doing all the other work.

I won't rate the recipe since I only made the chicken salad part. It was delicious! I did use only 1/2 cup of yogurt. Next time I would also cut down the salt. I think it would be even better eaten warm.

I don't know how long it takes to actually assemble this recipe -- I was interrupted frequently and had to abandon what I was doing every couple of steps. That sort of thing can spell disaster in the kitchen. Not so for this delicious flavorful dish. I came together very easily and looked so beautiful when assembled. But how it tastes?! Amazing. Even if you have to bumble around the kitchen, this comes together and won't disappoint. (I opted for a low-salt rotisserie chicken.)

Excellent! I used red onion which added a little kick and also added cilantro to the raita. Very good dish, will definitely be making it again!

I've made this on several occasions now, and every time it's the same response, "Wow! I want this recipe!". It's THAT good! I have made it exactly as the recipe calls every time, and it's great. Perhaps if I made the changes the other reviewers suggested it would be even better. Wait....is that even possible?! I would NOT, however, omit the grapes or the almonds. They both add a sweetness and texture that really pull the dish together.

The yogurt for the raita should be a very high M.F. 5% or higher. I used 2% MF and the Raita ended up being very watery and everything below it got soggy. Otherwise its a simple and delicious recipe!

This is a great recipe! I ate it both cold and hot. Omitted the grapes and didn't use the cilantro, since the bf hates it. Very good. Will probably add a serrano in next time for more heat.

This is a refreshing change from the usual summer chicken salad. Next time I would cut the yogurt in the salad (not in the raita) to 1/2-3/4 cup to avoid mushiness. I skipped the almonds and didn't miss them.

Loved it. Omitted a few things - did not make the raita and did not use almonds or cilantro. Still turned out great. I am from the Caribbean and am used to eating hot curried chicken so I was a bit hesitant to try it but it was really good. My son could not get used to the fact that it was a curry dish being served cold. I served it with avocado, brocolli slaw and crackers/pita chips. The avocado goes really nice with it. Had it 3 days in a row!

I took a lot of hints from previous reviewers: leftover roast chicken, increase mint in riata portion (used non-fat Greek style yogurt), increase cilantro, garlic, ginger and curry powder in chicken salad, decreased amount of yogurt in chicken salad (thankfully too--I can see it getting way too mushy!). Diligently shred the chicken. Bigger chunks don't absorb everything. Can eat this for days! It was exceptional! Served it on naan (but pita would work). Tried to crisp the chickpeas. Don't omit the almonds-they add a great texture. Don't skip the grapes either-helps get your fruit servings in each day! Make everything a day ahead and let the flavors develop (we at this on and off for 3 days). Seriously yum!

Wonderful recipe, and certainly not quite as time-consuming as anticipated. I used turkey instead of chicken, but otherwise followed it as written. I will make it again. Will be great for tupperwared lunches to take to work.

Good chicken salad recipe. I used my own raita recipe (basically the same, but add chopped green onions, cilantro, salt, lime zest & juice), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Excellent for snacking on and a great lunch. Will make again, as I usually have most of the ingredients on hand.

Rating: 4
Really delicious and easy to make. Does not take 1 1/4 hours as the recipe mentions either (and I added a step by poaching skinless chicken breasts for 20 minutes instead of using rotisserie chicken). Other changes, I forgot to buy grapes and used dried currants instead. I think this was a wise choice as the texture of the dried fruit went well with the rest of the salad. Hopefully this tastes as good for lunch tomorrow as it did for dinner. I also substituted roasted cashews for almonds since I had them on hand. I will definitely make this again.

I usually follow exactly BUT... I was in a hurry and love curry so, for the chicken mixture, I used garlic powder, onion powder and the rest of the spices and used light mayo instead of oil and yogurt. It's a fantastic spin on regular ol' chicken salad and my husband found it to be divine. Was a great answer to some leftover Thanksgiving turkey as well. I skipped the Raita portion and served i up in toasted pitas. All that being said, I'm sure the recipe, in it's true, original form is super yummy.

Yum! I made a few changes to the recipe, and it came out wonderfully. Used only 1/2 cup yogurt and extra cilantro. Thanks to previous reviewers for those suggestions. Omitted the raita and almonds. Mixed chicken, chickpeas, and grapes in a large bowl and served with pita bread and salad. A little time consuming, but delicious and healthy. Took me about an hour to make, including all chopping (didn't start with anything pre-chopped & took my time while listening to radio). Seems a little long for chicken salad, but good nonetheless.

This was delicious. Made it for a girlfriend who came for lunch. I did find it time- consuming. Fortunately I started it the night before which left just a couple steps the next morning. Not sure it's a dish for a "steak and potatoes" type person (my husband wouldn't touch this) but my girlfriend loves middle-eastern flavors so she raved about it.

This is a fantastic dish, and will leave your house smelling like warm curry for days (a good thing in my book). The first time I prepared the dish, I made all components as described in the recipe. Since then, I have twice made the chicken salad on its own for a quick meal, with addition of chopped grapes and/or cucumbers. I never repeat recipes this often, but this one is a new favorite!

Really really good! I used a turkey breast instead of chicken since the store was out of chickens. Put it in one large bowl instead of individuals. Otherwise went by the recipe and it was a huge hit with my husband and friends. After assembly I had it in the fridge for a few hours & I think it helped it really come together. Served it with whole wheat pita bread (most stuck it inside the pita).

I doubled this recipe and made it for eight friends last night, following the recipe exactly - although I just put it into a big glass bowl instead of fiddling with individual servings. It was a huge hit; two people asked if they could take the leftovers home, which I think has to be the ultimate compliment to a cook!

Delish. I would definitely make this one again; it's even company worthy. I followed the recipe for the most part, but as I often do I looked for some lower fat alternatives. I used the fat free greek style yogurt (it was extra creamy that way), I used breast only rotisserie, and I also cut the oil in half. Still really really good.

Amazing. The only change I made was serving over shredded romaine lettuce. Since we weren't taking it on a picnic, I arranged it on a platter with the lettuce as the bottom layer and the grapes sprinkled around the edge. It was beautiful and tasty enough for company.

This is a super recipe. Ticks all the right boxes! Delicious combination of textures and flavours. I halved the recipe for two of us, but will make in larger quantity for guests. Used some leftover roast chicken, and dry roasted peanuts instead of almonds, as they were to hand. Looks good served in a glass bowl if you're eating at home! Served naan bread with it.

Tired of traditional sandwiches and wraps, I made this to bring for lunch. I skipped the grapes and the riata (would be a nice addition, but certainly not neccesary), otherwise I made this recipe as written. It is delicious - works great wrapped in pita bread (or naan). Yummy!

Made this for a picnic over the weekend. Everybody loved the presentation! It was delicious. Next time I would increase the cilantro and mint, and I would add only 1/2 cup of yogurt to the chicken at first. I thought the whole cup made the salad a bit mushy.

Amazing! As the previous reviewer said, this would also be good warm with rice or naan. I omitted the grapes (don't care for fruit in my chicken salad) and the almonds (forgot to buy some). This is very flavorful and came together quickly. I'll definitely be making this many more times!

I found this recipe to be very bland, even after I added more curry powder and cumin. I also added some diced fresh pineapple (didn't have grapes) and cashews, and alot more cilantro, but it was only OK. It might have been better with some coconut, but didn't think of that until after. The chickpeas were OK, but added some garlic powder. The Raita was fine, but left out the almonds--just didn't feel right with the recipe.Added more mint as well, and some salt and a touch of cumin and cayenne.
