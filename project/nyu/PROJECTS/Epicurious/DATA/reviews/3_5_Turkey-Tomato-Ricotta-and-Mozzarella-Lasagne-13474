We've made this three times and love it. The spices really add interest to the dish (especially the allspice). Enjoy!

Excellent recipe. I used fresh herbs, more garlic and added more tomato sauce. The recipe is fab! A silence fell over my home are all the minions devoured the wonderful lasagne.

This lasagne recipe is one of my family mainstays. I've made it over and over again and it is always delicious. All the lasagne recipes from this issue of Gourmet (1995) are excellent. Having discovered the no-boil lasagne, I would never return to regular lasagne pasta.

this is a really great recipe for those who don't want to use beef or other red meat. I recommend using a bit more ground turkey and tomato for the sauce as well as a bit more pepper and red pepper and onion to spice it up a bit... but it is fantastic. Even my 1/4 italian mom said it was better than hers!

Excellent recipe. Added mushrooms, tomato paste and used 1 pound ground turkey, plus one half pound spicey Italian sausage. Very good!

This is fine, but not nearly as good as the wild mushroom lasagne recipe that's also on this site. I kept wishing it had a stronger, more intensely flavored ingredient.

Yummers!Subsituted crimini mushrooms for the carrots, doubled the amount of spices and herbs, added tomato paste for a thicker sauce, added a cup of cottage cheese to cheese mixture, used more garlic. The wine is what makes this such a flavorful dish. Next time will add black olives.

This was the best lasagne I ever made. I used regular lasagne noodles instead of no-bake. I do recommend cooking carrots with the onion and garlice to making they are cooked, if they are too hard they add a weird consistency to the sauce.

My three-fork review is based on two changes to the recipe. Having read the prior reviews, I substituted hot Italian sausage for the turkey and (because I had it) fresh thyme instead of dried. I slit the sausage skins and mixed the loose ground meat into the saucepan as directed. I made this for a casual dinner party with a green salad and caprese. Dont' believe the serving recomendations. My eight guests all wanted more than the recipe made.

This was a pretty good lasagne recipe. I used beef instead of turkey and it was fine. I agree with the other reviewers that you should add much more spice than is recommended. I added more basil, garlic and a couple bay leaves. I also thru in some chopped fennel with the onions, and a little left over spaghetti sauce I had in the fridge.

As pointed out by other reviewers, this recipe is a bit bland as written. I essentially doubled the amount of spices (and added about 1tsp of crushed anise). It was superb. I would strongly urge anybody making this to season the sauce to taste after it has been simmering with the recommended spices for 30 minutes. I also diverged from the recipe in adding 1/2 again as much ricotta and using crushed tomatoes.

I added whole tomatoes and a can of tomato paste. Delicious!!

Lots of work, but worth it! I mixed spicy Italian sausage with the ground turkey to give it some punch, and substituted cottage cheese for ricotta, mushrooms as suggested instead of carrots, and it turned out great! Coworkers liked it too...

This just wasn't for us. It was bland and uninteresting. Ditto on the other advice re: the tomato paste, it needs it. It still came out just sitting in broth, though. We'll stick to our more traditional "meat" and "veggie" lasagnes in the future.

I doubled the ricotta mixture and used puree per some of the prior recommendations and we really liked this. I used some turkey Italian sausage in place of the ground turkey and next time I will use half turkey sausage/half turkey.

This was the best lasagna I've ever made. Even my incredibly picky husband loved it. My guests went home with the recipe. I did take the advice of other reviewers and doubled the ricotta mixture and used tomato puree instead of the whole tomatoes. Came out great.

This was the first lasagne I ever made. In fact, when it was first published in December (was it really 1995?) I made the sauce that Friday night, assembled it Saturday afternoon and served it that night to g/friends. Delish!!! I've made it a bunch of times and everybody so far has loved it.

Delicious variation on a traditional lasagne. Allows one to overcome the non- beef eater problem of serving lasagne. Rave reviews by all who have tried it. - Twice made. Freezes well too.

Excellent dish. Very tasty. I made some great points with future in-laws by serving this dish. I doubled, maybe tripled the ricotta as others suggested (otherwise there would not have been enough for all the layers). I also used two red peppers. Although the carrots were nice, I may substitute or add mushrooms next time. I also used pureed tomatos instead of the whole ones. I forgot to add the All Spice, too.

I thought this dish was mediocre, nothing to rave about. More of a casserol than a lasagne. I wish I had taken the advice to add more ricotta it did need it.

Tried this for the first time last night. Excellent results. I did use the following variations, however: Instead of ground turkey, I used fresh ground chicken; I omitted the carrots; I added two cups of sliced fresh mushrooms; I used two red bell peppers, not one; I added an 8 oz can of tomato paste; and instead of the whole tomato (I don't like the taste/texture of the tomatos), I used two 15 oz cans of tomato sauce. I also goosed the ricotta/mozzarella/parmesan cheese content by perhaps a quarter. I know these are a lot of changes, but the results were great. Try it with chicken instead of turkey, for sure!

Have made this recipe twice now, and have had rave reviews from all who have tried it. I did omit the carrots, and added an extra red pepper, but also added mushrooms. Will definitely keep this one at the front of the recipe box.

I did not use the puree from the whole tomatoes and added to small cans of tomato paste. It was excellant.

Excellent... a slightly different take on the usual! Next time, I'll use two red peppers, and also add a can of tomato paste, even though it's kind of tomatoy as is. I found that I didn't have very much ricotta mixture so I'll double it.

I agree with the cook from Annapolis - plan on adding a few tablespoons of tomato paste. I also added a layer of chopped spinach & it turned out great (if you use a pkg of frozen, press the liquid out of it VERY WELL).

Very tasty, but I'd prefer more of a tomato-based sauce

By far the best lasagne recipe I have made (tho if you make Lasagne for kids, this may be more flavourful than they are used to). I have made it with minced beef as well, and that is tasty.
