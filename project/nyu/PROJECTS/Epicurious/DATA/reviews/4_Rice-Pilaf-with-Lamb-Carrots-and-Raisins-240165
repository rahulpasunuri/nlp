Beautifully complex flavors, this is an authentic recipe. I have been to Kazakhstan and eaten this, served by Uzbeks, and I can tell you this recipe will yield the same flavors. Do allow the onions to brown a bit. Also adding coriander is authentic.

I made 1/3 of this because I had 1lb of lamb and used brown rice. It took me in total 5 hours from start to finish. It's good but I don't know if the 5 hours were worth it. I had to lift the cover so the water could evaporate in the end. I served with tzatziki which is the Greek version of the Turkish garlic sauce (cacik)

I have a freezer full of left over lamb shwarma from a birthday party. This recipe was a huge hit with the family. Rave reviews from the kids and they didn't like the lamb the first time around. I got totally confused with the tea towel wrapped around the lid. Just put the bloody lid on the pot and don't worry about tea towel until it's time to wash up.

Absolutely simple and great. I omitted the raisins because my husband does not like them, and it's still fantastic!

Don't dismiss this recipe due to lack of spices in the pilaf, the yogurt sauce takes it to another dimension! It makes a gorgeous meal: carmelised onion infused morsels of lamb with sweet plump raisins and carrots. This is something to be savored! Variations we've done: using brown rice, making the yogurt sauce with mint, cilantro and salt (no garlic - great with or without). This is definitely a keeper, and reheats well for a belly-warming breakfast!

I make a very similar recipe and everybody loves it. For more flavor I use chicken stock instead of water. Sometimes I change it up by adding turmeric, cumin and whole cloves of garlic. Sometimes I add cubed quince or granny smith apple instead of raisins.
