This salad was a perfect side dish and delicious! I used good frozen corn and that worked. I definitely agree that the recipe would be better with less oil and less cooking time for the scallions.

I really enjoyed this rich and sweet salad and its was a beautiful presentation because I used a selection of different colored tomatoes. Some found it too rich if creamy wasn't their taste but for what it was, I think it was great. Fresh corn does make a difference I feel, in contrast to other reviewers.

The first recipe I've ever given a "no" to. I really tried to like this because when I look at the recipe and I look at it made it's a very colorful, lots of potential recipe. The first time I made it as the recipe calls for a tailgate party and while we were running out of the chili and running out of meatball sandwiches everyone had plenty of this left on their plates. But for some reason I really wanted to like this salad. The second time I followed the suggestions, cut down the oil, sour cream, etc. (and no, Ontario, I didn't miss the S&P part) and it was just blah...I tried adding dill, I tried adding basil and nothing. I'm glad there are people who liked it but this one's deleting from the recipe file for me.

Used Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn. Added soo much. Used it as a relish/salsa for taco's, everyone loved it.

Fast and easy, especially since I used frozen corn (results are identical). Heeded other reviewers' advice and went easy on the dressing; had almost one cup in reserve! Also had some good, zippy jicama that I cut up and added to the mix for a little more crunch. A big hit, and I'll certainly serve this again.

Would make again with few small changes - less oi, less cooking time on the onions, frozen corn!

I cut down on the oil as the other reviewers suggested and found that the dressing was still too much. I felt the creamy flavor tainted the wonderful tastes of the corn, tomatoes, and onions. I will make it again without the sourcream,even less oil, and extra onions.

A cross between a salad and a veggie side dish which works well with a lot of entrees. I served this with Sauteed Pork Chops with Mushrooms, Dill, & Sour Cream and Mashed Potatoes with Green Onions & Parmesan both on this website. I halved the dressing and did 1/3 of the veggies for 2 people. My husband tossed all the dressing with the veggies and it too much dressing. Fortunately the flavor was great.

I've made this recipe twice for large groups, the last time for a holiday party with 70 people. The fall salad has been popular both times, with people asking for the recipe, and is a wonderful timesaver as you can make it ahead. Plus, the color is a wonderful addition to a buffet table.

I have made this 4 times and made two adjustments to the above recipe- use rice wine vinegar and fresh italian parsley or basil- not so much fall as it is spring/summer. If you have great tomatoes and corn you cant mess it up but I found I LOVE the vinagrette w/ rice wine. If you find that the dressing is bland- try cutting the olive oil to 1/2 cup.

I made this salad as a side dish for a tea/luncheon with various small sandwiches, and it was delicious. I used frozen corn instead of fresh, and my guests loved it

I thought this was terrific! Simple, flavorful and delicious, this salad was a snap and will go wonderfully with lots of light meals. Who could say no to this!?

This was a great salad. Guess the last couple of reviewers missed the "season with salt and pepper" to taste instructions. I used a good quality frozen corn and will definitely make again.

This was very bland and, as the previous reviewer, my guests ended up adding salt and pepper - I did too. There are other "fall" salads out there, but - even better - some great fall soups. I would pass on this one.

It is difficult to find fresh corn in season this time of year(fall) in Colorado. The salad turned out to be very bland and the dinner guests were adding lots of salt and pepper to it. I don't think this will cross my dinner table again.

Everyone loved this salad, we cooked it according to directions and the corn was still crunchy. It will become a staple at our house!

After reading the other review I decreased the cooking time of the corn, dropped the oven temperature to 400 and only roasted the onions for 8 minutes. While that added in some texture, a few homemade croutons drizzled with olive oil were the final ticket. Definitely an hit with our guests!

It needed a little crunch.
