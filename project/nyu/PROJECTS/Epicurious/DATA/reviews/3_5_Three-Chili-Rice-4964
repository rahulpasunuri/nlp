I think this goes well with the chicken and green olive enchiladas, although I use black olives instead. It takes some time, but worth the effort. It's not what I call a "Big Flavor" recipe that stands alone, but works great as a side dish, as what it should do.

This dish was delicious although I made many modifications. While I generally get annoyed when people review a recipe which they've changed substantially, I think its good to know that you can make this successfully with replacement ingredients. i used only poblanos not having a jalapeno handy. Very good but too spicy with three poblanos...2 would have been better. I used a mixture of brown and wild rice. Very good but takes longer to cook. We love spicy food so this was a hit and will be a repeat production in my kitchen.

This recipe could have a bit more zing. I've made the recipe twice and it is a bit labor intensive for what ends up being a rather regular rice dish.

Good, but not worth the effort.

This dish had fantastic flavor and aroma. I used corn kernels instead of peas and it was definitly a huge pleaser at my table.

Although I changed the recipe around, I can tell it would still be very good as is. I took a simpler route and omitted the chiles since I had them in another part of the meal. I used brown rice which needed to cook longer. It is a moist dish so it is actually quite good the next day reheated.

Made this for a dinner party to go with chicken and green olive enchiladas. Everyone loved it! So even though it's labor-intensive, it's well worth the effort. Even my husband, who isn't the biggest rice fan in the world,and definitely isn't the biggest fan of green peas loved it and ate the leftovers!

Made this for a crowd and it was a pleaser. I don't usually like rice leftover but took another reviewers advice and made this the day before. It was still moist even after reheating and very good.

I reduced this recipe to half as there are only two of us, and we combined these leftovers with the leftovers from the Spicy Tofu Burritos recipe for breakfast burritos. Nutritious and delicious.

Well worth the effort. Tastes great hot from the stove and even better warmed two days later. After the first time you can adjust the flavor to your personal tastes.

I find it hard to believe that any Mexican food lover would not like this recipe! This is absolutely delicious and an excellent side dish to the chicken and green olive enchiladas. Definately use the chicken broth left over from the enchiladas; it imparts a richer flavor to the dish. I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. Ole!

I love rice dishes, but found this to lack the pazazz I had hoped for. It wasn't bad, but I don't think it was worth the effort.
