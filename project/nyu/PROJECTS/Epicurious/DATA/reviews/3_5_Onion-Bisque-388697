Boring flavor and lots of work. Not worth it.

This is an amazing recipe! It's low effort and calls for ingredients I always have on hand. For those reasons, I FAR prefer this to French onion soup at home! I made a half- batch, skipped the bacon, subbed in dried thyme, and blended in more bread to taste with my immersion blender. Once simmering with stock and thyme, the aroma will bring you to religion. The sprinkling of goat cheese isn't mandatory, but stirred in and melting, it elevates the soup to something luxurious. I served it as a light entree, but it was far richer than I expected and can certainly stand alone. I've never reviewed a recipe on Epi before, but I can't stop talking about this one! Make this, make this, make this!

I made this ALMOST as is except that I only pureed some of the soup and left the rest in chunks ( like soups that have body). It is DROP DEAD DELISH!

I loved this soup, and will definitely be making it again! Its one of my new favorites. I followed the recipe closely, except for a few deviations. First, I hate thyme, so I used a tiny bit of dried thyme, then added rosemary and sage to taste. I also seasoned with some chicken stock (in addition to the chicken broth). And I doubled the amount of bread that it asked for. I didn't have bacon, so I garnished with prosciutto instead. The soup that I ended up with was probably thicker than the recipe would make, but the texture and taste was amazing. I couldn't believe how thick and creamy it was without having any cream in it.
