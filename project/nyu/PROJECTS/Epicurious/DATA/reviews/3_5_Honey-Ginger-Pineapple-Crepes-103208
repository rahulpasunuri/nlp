Very tasty. I had trouble getting the honey/OJ mix to thicken... perhaps it's because I used light agave instead of honey. Ginger is strong so make sure not to over-do it, but really tastes great with the other flavors. I used fresh pineapple (not canned) and made my crepes using sugar-free pancake mix, replacing eggs and oil with fat-free yogurt. If you're short on time, you can just use the ready-made crepes from the store. I was going to top w/ whipped cream, but it was so sweet I just ate it as-is.

Yum!! Excellent, although I couldn't get the honey-orange juice mixture to thicken into a syrup!

I used half the amount of pineapples because I added in a ripe mango I want to use up. I also added a tablespoon of rum being that the ingredients remind me of the caribean. It was delicious! I really liked the mango in it. I could've made more of the filling because it was so good.

I really loved this recipe. The crepe itself was very light and the pineapple marmalade inside was delicious. It's great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This was a great dessert that was loved by everyone. The pineapples and orange juice balanced the ginger nicely. The crepe batter worked well. I will use the recipe for the batter whenever I make crepes.

I served this for breakfast and there wasn't a scrap left - I guess they liked it! I didn't have fresh ginger but I did have fresh pineapple. Next time I'm going to try sauteing the pineapple in a cast iron pan, I didn't get mine to carmelize at all.

I didn't have any pineapples, so I did just the crepes. The crepes tasted very good, but they were coming apart too easily. I would make this recipe again, with pineapples. I had the crepes with jam, and tea, and it was delicious.
