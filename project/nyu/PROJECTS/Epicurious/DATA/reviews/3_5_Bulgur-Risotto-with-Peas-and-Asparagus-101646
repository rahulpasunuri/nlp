I made this pretty much just as written and it was delicious. I found the bulgur absorbed the chicken stock as it was added pretty quickly. A great whole-grain risotto option (if you get whole-grain bulgur)

Wow, I don't know what these other reviewers did with this recipe to make it good, but I followed it as written and it was pretty bad. Bitter, mushy, and flavorless. Even my husband, who will eat almost anything, could barely put it down. To me, it had all the ingredients of risotto (except white wine and rice), and had none of the good things that risotto has (like a wonderful delicate flavor). The only thing I can think of that I might have done wrong was that perhaps you are supposed to wash off the bulgur wheat before you cook it. Since the dish came out with a weird bitter flavor, I could imagine that a little rinsing might have gone a long way. But the recipe says nothing about that. Maybe another reviewer can inform. Whatever you do, don't cook this for guests the first time you make it.

it is quite good: readers might like to try my version: I added the garlic about 3 minutes after the onions and added the stock just after the aroma of the garlic came through: also I used my own stock: you need to simmer about a kilo of chicken bones and trimmings in a heavy stock pot for about 2 hours at medium heat skimming frequently and then put the pot in a basket lined with plenty of news paper overnight. I have to say it is quite original, even my wife agrees!

To Bubba3151: "Unthawed" peas are frozen peas that have not been thawed. The recipe wants them to be used in their frozen state. Pretty straightforward.

in all my risotto dishes I start out with butter chicken stock and white wine it is always perfectly seasoned.If you have to add too much salt its time to start over again.

This was very good but needed a little fine tuning first of all, I used an organic vegetable broth, so I found it very bland at first --had to add tons of salt and a little "Spike". I added a little fruity Sauv. Blanc in the end to keep it moist and it complemented it well. I had a few slices of bacon laying around so I fried those up to begin with poured out about half the grease put the bacon aside and then started the recipe with less butter. I added the crumbled bacon when I put in the "frozen" peas. I also used the tarragon and thought it was the perfect herb, but I like a little spiciness so I also added cayenne. I always use aged Parmesan Regianno as I think it is miles above regular permesan. I also thought I was fattening enough with the butter, so I used 2% milk instead of whipping cream. I agree with the earlier reviewer who said bulgur is a nice change from white rice, but with that said it is a bit chewy. All in all, a great risotto.

This was freaking delicious! Asparagus was too expensive, so I substituted some roasted butternut squash. I used fresh thyme in place of tarragon, and left out the cream and butter altogether (used olive oil instead) - what a fabulous dish!

This is a great way to use bulgur, and is much healthier than the usual white rice risotto. I used olive oil instead of butter, and it turned out great.

Surprisingly good! The asparugus really stood out very positively against the rest. The bulgur together with the peas had a nice texture, and the tarragon (I used dried) was exactly the right herb to use. I only left out the whipping cream as I was afraid it might become too creamy and moist. On the side I served a chicken breast marinated in gin, lemon juice, juniper berries, tarragon and basil, which went very well with it. This combination will probably become one of my staples.

What I learned from this recipe- don't try to double it! I burned the bottom of the risotto because I couldn't keep up with the volume in the pan. And those 6 servings aren't wimpy ones. Despite the burning- the risotto was very tasty, I left out the Tarragon and used chives instead since I'm not a fan of Tarragon.

The way I read it unthawed means "do not thaw." So I added frozen peas. The result was good but better, I think, when using short grain rice. Risotto is rice bulghur is something else.

This turned out really well! Bulgar has a slightly chewy texture and works well as a substitute for rice in risotto. Felt like it was a healthy version...quite easiy to make and very forgiving of some in attention. We had it as a side for baked chicken.

the recipe calls for frozen peas "unthawed". Must mean "thawed", otherwise we are asked to freeze already frozen peas!
