Lovely. I omitted the cinnamon & salt from the topping and baked while eating our Autumn dinner of Swedish meatballs & pumpkin puree. Lovely way to incorporate the variety of pears in season just now.

This is an excellent dessert with homemade whipped cream on top. I've received rave reviews and now it's a standard go-to recipe when I have to provide a dessert.

Excellent recipe. I more than doubled the crystallized ginger and it still did not seem strong enough, but it met rave reviews. Chopped pecans mixed into the topping was well received, but not necessary.

Excellent! Added about 2 1/2 times the called for amount of crystallized ginger to the filling (Trader Joe's). Everyone loved this recipe. It's pretty foolproof -- the only time consuming part is peeling the pears and slicing them thinly.

I made this for Thanksgiving and the fruit lovers gave it a big thumbs up. It was easy, quick, and delicious. I also added more ginger (shy of doubled) but doubled would not be overpowering. The lemon was very complimentary,also. With vanilla ice cream - Yumm!

This is an excellent, simple recipe we use all the time. Usually add more cinnamon and increase the crystallized ginger. Also cut down the butter (i've also tried making crumble with almond oil, which is a healthier alternative that works ok). Adding blackberries, strawberries, or peaches makes this dessert even better.

Yummy!!!!!!!! Just moved to a new house with a Pear tree in the yard, so I was looking for pear recipes. This one will be returning again and again!! The ginger adds a great kick! I used 5 Tbs - because I love it! Never made a "crumble" before, so I'm not sure if the consistency was correct - but the taste was right on! Fab!

Delicious! I added 1/2 t. cinnamon to the pears, 1 t. crystallized ginger and 1/2 c. pecans to the topping. It only took 35 mins. to bake. I served it with cinnamon dulche de leche ice cream. Wow!

Yummy! Made it almost exactly as the recipe stated, except ran short of pears so added one Honeycrisp apple, and added a handful of sliced almonds to the topping. Great! Next time, I may double the crystallized ginger as other reviewers have done.

I have a friend which is allergic to flour, so I substituted the almonds ground in a food process for the flour. Below were the changes which I made to the recipe. Everyone loved the dessert. Changes - Topping replaced flour with 1 1/2 cups ground almonds; not 2/3 cups of brown sugar but 1/2 cup; not 1 t cinnamon but 1/2 t cinnamon & 1/2 t crystallized ginger. Added 3/4 c toasted pecans, 3/4 c semi-sweet chocolate chips. Filling not 1/3 c sugar - but 1/4 c sugar; not 1 1/2 T unbleached all purpose flour but 1 1/2 T ground almonds. Added 1 t pumpkin pie spice; 1/2 c dried cranberrys, lemon zest from whole lemon, and 1 T of bourbon.

I made 2 batches of this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit - none left over. This is now one of my favorite desserts. It's familiar enough for people shy to try new things, but different enough so it's not the same old thing.

This recipe is delicious, my husband is very picky and loved it! I substituted the crystallized ginger with fresh, it was great!

Great dessert. I made this on the spur of the moments so I did not have the crystallized ginger or the oats. I used powdered ginger instead, but I will try with crystallized ginger next time. Instead of oats, I crushed up some oat biscuits I found and reduced the sugar in the recipe. I think this was a great change and will do it this way again. Easy to make, would have been great with vanilla ice cream.

Such a hit! I made 2 batches for a 16 person dinner party and only had one serving left over. Not as sweet as apple crisp. I used 1/2 t cinnamon & 1/2 t minced crystallized ginger in the topping. Personally, I love ginger and might use more it if I were making this just for me. But a woman at the party who doesn't really like ginger thought this was just fine. So easy to make. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

This was very easy and so delicious! I made only half the recipe for my husband and me and then my daughter brought her friends over and they emptied the serving dish! Wish I had made the whole recipe! Next time I might add a bit more crystalized ginger for a more pronouced flavor but really it was just wonderful as is!!

Really lovely fall dessert. I baked in individual ramekins (adding chocolate to the topping) and served topped with fresh unsweetened whip cream and grated orange peel. A hit.

Very good use of ripe pears. I didn't have any crystallized ginger, so I substituted 1tsp or so of fresh grated ginger, which tasted good. Next time, I'd cut back on the sugar a bit--the sweetness overpowered the delicate pear flavor a bit.

The friend I made this for proclaimed this was her favorite Pear crisp of all time...and I knows she's tasted quite a few! Taking tips from other reviewers, I too used 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ground ginger in the topping and added lemon zest to the filling. In addition, I folded in a handful of sliced almonds into the topping which added a nice texture.

This recipe was SO simple and tasted so delicious. I don't like ginger so I didn't include it, still turned out great!

Easy way to make use of pears from our tree. Mixed Bartletts with Comice. Added twice as much candied ginger. Excellent with ice cream.

This was so good. I'm only 14 and my whole family loved it. We had so many pears, we went to the farmers market and for twelve dollars we got the biggest thing of pears imaginable, and this was a great way to use them. I did as another reviewer suggested and used 1/2 cinnamon 1/2 ginger in the topping. I also added 1/2 cup of nuts to the topping. Will definitely make again

I make this often and usually don't change a thing, which is unusual for me. I occasionally add more ginger which gives it a nice kick. This one is always a hit.

We have a pear tree in our yard. The past 2 years we've canned all the pears (pear halves, pear butter, pear ginger jam, pear chutney, pear mincemeat, pearsauce...) but this was the first year we actually made desserts with the fresh pears. Wow, this one is good. We have the sweetest pears so it was very flavorful. We also added the dried cranberries & made it in 2 8x8 pans so we could give on to our new neighbors as a house warming gift. Very good reviews from all.

I was not that impressed with this recipe. It was easy and tasted fine, but it was not as flavorful as I would have liked. I would use more ginger and more lemon juice. This was a fine recipe, but nothing amazing. I would try a different recipe next time around.

I made a few additions to this recipe. First, I tossed in some dried cranberries & zest of one lemon to the filling which added a tangy tart flavor to the fruit. I also added a tsp of ginger powder & pumpkin pie spice which lent that extra gingery-punch I was looking for. The crumble topping is very sweet, so I added 1/2 cup chopped roasted pecans to balance the sweet with a touch of salty. I loved this topped with vanilla ice cream and some extra crystallized ginger for garnish.

Super easy. I halved the topping and made 4 indiviual servings. This would be a quick and easy ending to any meal!

Excellent recipe! Assuming nothing can't be improved with nuts, I added walnuts to the topping (toasted almonds would be nice also). This made a great ending to a hearty fall meal of kasha varnishkas and orange-romaine-chick pea salad for our vegetarian friends. Was good cold the next day, too.

Fabulous! The only changes I made were to use quick oats (worked fine!) and I added 2 Granny Smith apples to the 3 D'anjou pears, and threw in some sweetened dried cranberries. It made a superb fall treat. I made in two 8x8 pans, so I could give one to my grandmother, and she was so impressed! The crumble topping is the best I've had, and the ginger is a great addition to the fruit mixture. Could be easily adapted for all my fruit crisp recipes!

Very good! I made the crumble in the food processor and it was very easy ... but I made a mistake. Next time, I would mix everything for the crumble in the processor except the oats ... the oats got ground up (dumb, I know), and I had to stir more oats in at the end to get that crumble effect.

Easy & delicious. I replaced half of the cinnamon with ground ginger and served with unsweetened whipped cream. A keeper!

I used plain yoghurt as sauce and no ice cream (calories!) and I used Benecol instead of butter to improve the cholesterol level of my husband. The result was absolutely delicious with a very refreshing yoghurtsauce

Wow. The best use (aside from eating out of hand) for pears I've come across. I lacked ice cream, so poured plain milk over it...perfect.

This dish was wonderful. I used honey instead of sugar to sweeten the pears and regular ginger instead of the crystallized giner (althought I think it would be even better with the crystallized ginger). I will definitely be making this again!
