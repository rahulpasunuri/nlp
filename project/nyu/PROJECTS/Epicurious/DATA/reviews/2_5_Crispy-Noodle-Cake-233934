This is no more bland than plain linguine! I served this with the Lamb Stew with Lemon and Figs. The crunchy texture was great with the stew.

We liked the texture and taste of this dish although it didn't stay together as a cake. Next time we would add an egg. We refried it in a cast iron skillet with a smaller cast iron skillet pressing it down on top. As suggested, we made this to go along with lamb and fig stew.

Of course this is bland. It's meant to be served along side the Lamb stew with lemon & figs. Or spicy asian food. Bet none of you eat tofu out of the box. Same idea.

If it's got carbs and is fried I want way better than this ....

A number of other commenters said this recipe was dull, and on its own I suppose it is. But I don't think it's meant to be served stand-alone--it was good with the accompanying lamb stew recipe (though plain noodles would do just as well). If you do try this, use your largest frying pan to maximize the surface area.

Honestly, this recipe is bland and lifeless. It lacks soul. I have prepared numerous crispy noodles cakes with umph to it, be it the addition of super fine slivers of sun-dried tomatoes and super finely grated parmesan reggiano and MORE olive oil or Vietnamese style with raw crushed garlic, fish sauce and butter. If you do attempt this simple side dish, well...add something. Anything. Enough said.

I've made a similar recipe only using leftover spaghetti and sauce, eggs and grated cheese. The pasta gets crispy on the outside and soft inside. The flavor is amazing and everyone loves it!

WHY would anyone make this when wonderful pasta recipes are available? Potato pancakes made this way are delicious, but NOT PASTA!!

I didn't make this one, but have made a similer one for years, except rather than parsley to flavor the noodles, you use soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. It's not a side dish, you use it under your stir fry instead of rice.

My mom used to make fried noodles. She didn't make a pancake and only used margarine. The noodles were all mixed with soft parts and crispy edges. I made this for my girls when they wre young and they loved it. Works best with flat egg noodles, more places to crisp. VERY GOOD for a carb addict.

Unremarkable--in fact plain buttered noodles are better and a lot less trouble. The reviews that suggested egg and parm sound much more appealing.

What would you serve this with? It seems a little dull on its own!

I've been making this for years, using an old Jane Brody recipe. However this one is a little dull. Brody's recipe calls for mixing the pasta with one beaten egg and 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan Reggiano cheese, which adds flavor and helps keep the pasta together. Then follow the rest of the recipe. Great for left over spaghetti or linguini, my son loves this.

This has been a staple in my house for years. We usual add an egg and grated cheese. This is also great with left over chopped vegatables mixed within.
