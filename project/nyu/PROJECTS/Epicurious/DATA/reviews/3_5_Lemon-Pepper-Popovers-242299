Easy to put together and delicious. Served at breakfast. The pepper gives them a little kick, so I served them with the Pear Caramel Butter from this site to make it sweet and spicy.

Great popovers! I used a cup + 2 tbsp of 2% milk instead of the water/whole milk combo, and skimped a little on the flour, as I like popovers even less doughy than this recipe would yield. The consistency of these was perfect. I also added about 1 tbsp of a pine nut / mushroom / cheese blend to the center of each popover before they were cooked, which really turned out great! Seems like you could add almost anything with similar results.

I made those popovers yesterday and we all loved them, but they fell, they were so flat when I put them on the table, I was ashamed, WHY....

Easy to make & was flavorful, but I found it a bit dull. I think I'll try a cheese flavored popover recipe next time.

I love popovers and make them year round. I think this is one of my new favorite recipes. I made this last night and we loved them. A nice balance of pepper and lemon. This recipe is so quick and easy I am going to experiment with sage and I'll try the skim instead of whole milk/water.

to mango19 - it's the eggs... by beating them, whether separate OR together, you're incorporating air into them. and as the popovers bake, those air pockets are heated and thus they expand, making the popover "rise".

Also to Lakeville: While I haven't tried this recipe, I make popovers all the time with #2 milk and they are perfection (if I do say so myself lol). I follow the more standard combo of 1 c milk, 1 c flour, 2 eggs, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tbsp melted butter (I always use "I can't believe it's not butter" FYI). Fill almost to top if using a regular muffin tin, bake 15 min. in preheated 450 oven and lower heat without opening door to 350. Bake 20 min more. I also use Pam spray. You would never know these weren't made with whole milk and butter and I've never had a failure yet!!! By filling that much it produces a spectacular, over sized popover w/no special pan needed. I'm sure if you wanted to adapt them to lemon pepper it would work as well. So good luck to my MA neighbor!

Educate me, why will this rise without any leavening and/or eggs that were beaten separately? The science of baking has eluded me yet again!

To Lakeville: The conversion is 1c whole milk = 1c skim milk + 2 tsp melted butter. Keep the milk and water proportions, just add a little fat.

These popovers are the first I've ever made and, I dare say, the most simple yet exquisite! My husband and I ate the experimental batch in no time as we could not stop! Made them again 2 nights later for our neighbors when they came over for vegetarian chili. Used muffin cups . . amazingly delicious and light!

This is one of the easiest and best tasting recipes I think I've made in 25 years of cooking! These popovers are as light as a feather yet they offer a marvelous texture and a slightly crisp top! Delicious!!

Can I use 1 cup of skim milk instead of 3/4 c of whole milk and 1/4 c of water? Can't find anything on internet to convert whole milk + water = skim milk
