This is delicious and ridiculously easy. I cooked the asparagus in the oven, I'd love some tips on this. Also, my boyfriend doesn't like asparagus so I put some mache on his plate.

I'm having this for dinner tonight. And when it's cold outside, roasting the asparagus in the oven is perfect. So delicious!

LOVE it. I love to make this for friends about once a month. Sinfully delicious.

We made this today and it was fantastic. We couldn't find the muffin tins so we poached the eggs on the cook top. The two-step asparagus prep was worth it. Our new favorite breakfast. Will double the portions next time!
