Simple to make and delicious to eat: I used regular lemon as noted in the variation because no Meyer lemons were available. Lumpy, as noted by one reviewer, but not impossible with a spreader.

A very disappointing recipe as written. The crab meat and butter together is lumpy and without any taste. The cost of the lump crab meat made this a very expensive blunder. We experimented and added cream cheese to a portion and mayonnaise to a second portion. The second won easily

I am making this for my Easter dinner. It doesn't look anything like the picture! The added harissa gives it a pinkish tinge. And the crab to butter ratio creates a much lumpier, crabbier texture. I haven't tasted it yet, but don't think it can be served with a spreader as shown.
