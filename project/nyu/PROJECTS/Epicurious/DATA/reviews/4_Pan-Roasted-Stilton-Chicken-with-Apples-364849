This was excellent. I'm teaching myself to cook, and even I was able to manage this one. I'm not a huge fan of cooked fruit, so the trick of this recipe is not to over sauté the fruit before putting it in the oven. I also used a very flavorful apple, a honeycrisp, as suggested. As a side, I sautéd a few slices of polenta in the same pan used to brown the chicken and sauté the apples. I think it could have used a bit more Stilton, but I'm a big Stilton fan.

Nice but not outstanding. Will make again. Liked the Honeycrisp apples that I hadn't eatenbefore.

I wish this recipe had more reviews! It truly is exceptional - and so easy- with no modification. Use the extra cheese for a cranberry/almond salad and it's a delicious, fast meal.

I used boneless chicken thighs, with onions and 4 peeled apples. Per reviewer suggestions, I made it entirely on the stovetop and deglazed the pan with a good amount of sherry. Didn't have blue cheese so used feta. My husband was thrilled :)

easy to make as i also sauteed without using the oven. i added extra butter, onion and sherry and topped with chèvre (goat cheese) instead of stilton. terrific flavors!

This dish is AWESOME and really easy! I've made it several times. Tonight I pan seared the chicken cutlets, put them on a plate while I sautéed the apples until they were deep golden brown. I then added the chicken back to the pan with the apples all around and some on top of the chicken, splashed in some pear brandy (or sherry or any light wine) and covered it with gorgonzola cheese and let it simmer for a few minutes, uncovered. No need to heat the oven. It made an incredible sauce. Would have preferred stilton but it's not easy to get here; any sort of blue veined cheese works. LOVE IT!

This dish is SO GOOD and easy to make! We made a sauce by frying up Pancetta, putting it to the side, and then added garlic, white wine, chicken broth, and butter to the pan to top the chicken off. I will make this next time we have company - it's so elegant and yummy.

I anticipate this is a recipe I will make again and again. You can't beat the ease of this dish, especially when considering the end result. Of course, I'm also a huge Stilton fan. I used dried rosemary, and it worked, but I would use fresh next time. Paired it with sauteed delicata squash and beet parsley salad for a delightful and colorful fall meal.

Very easy to make and very tasty. My picky 6 and 8 year old boys even liked it!

Delicious recipe! The sweetness of the apples compliments the salty tang of the stilton perfectly. It is a divine dish for cool autumn evenings.

This was truly excellent. I used ricotta salata cheese and served over egg noodles. Dried rosemary works just fine on this dish.

This was fantastic and simple. The only change is I indulged in 4 oz of blue cheese. Fresh picked rosemary from my garden was a plus.

This recipe is exceptional and very easy to prepare. I substituted a Blue Cheese for the Stilton. It was delicious. Will defiantly make again!

This is delicious and easy! I didn't have Stilton so used Roquefort--it was a great combination!

I think what kind of apples here is important. They mellow out really well w the cheese (used feta), but you dont want the super sweet kind. I used a spiral apple cutter, it made the whole thing a piece o cake. This dish could be served to guests or just keep it in the family. Its really good,easy, and has a beautiful presentation. Served it w spinnach tortellini.
