This is a pretty straight-forward recipe. I found the taste flawless, but the pie became more crumbly than gooey the second day. I would also note here that you'll want a heavy-duty mixer to make both pies. I have a KitchenAid Professional mixer with the 6-quart bowl instead of the typical Artisan with the 4-quart bowl. I definitely needed all of the power and capacity of the Professional mixer to handle 2 pies with all the ingredients mixed in.

I have been baking chocolate chip cookies for forever, and never found the right ratio of butter and shortening to give me a cookie that is soft on the inside, while a bit crunchy on the outside. This recipe is it without the hassle of figuring out the ratio and dropping cookies. Its like a giant cookie for sure, not really a pie except for the pie plate you cook it in, but who cares, it was great and I got rave reviews without a crumb left. I cut the recipe in half since I only wanted one pie (using 1 egg) and it was fabulous. This one is a keeper.

Leave it to the Deen family to nail down good ole comfort food. My kids were amazed. Heck I was amazed. Perfect recipe for picnics, superbowl parties, casual gatherings or a big snow day with kids in the house. Thanks to all who commented on not overcooking the pie. p.s. I added 1 cup of pecans instead of the walnuts. yum

I should have read the reviews first...my middles would not bake, so I covered with foil and baked and baked! Now I know that the centers were meant to be gooey! As a result, my bottoms and edges were too done, but it was still gobbled up and loved by all! Next time I'll know!

I Love this recipe!! I made it once, and I plan on making it again. I brought it to a neighbors house and she and her family love it. I put the remaining pie in the freezer for when I need a sweet treat. I will definatley make this for casual parties! I didnt do the whipped cream because I thought that it would be too much. When I tried the pie I realized I was right, and with the whipped cream it would have been too sweet.v

I've made this several times now, most recently for the 4th of July, and it's wonderful. Even when I don't think it comes out quite right (through my own error) my friends love it.

It looks really good, smells good but is the middle suppose to be gooey like? I feel like if I had baked it anymore it would have turned into a chocolate chip cookie cake.

Technically, this isn't a pie at all, there is no pastry. But it's so good, I don't think anyone will argue. It's delicious. The whipped cream is a nice bonus.
