Very good, unusual dip. Went over well with everyone. Served with a variety of crackers, cheeses, etc. Also used small canned shrimp and did not put them in the processor. I am going to try it without the shrimp and serve with crab cakes, next.

I made this for a Christmas party last year and it was a big hit. I had several people request the recipe. I didnt put the shrimp in the food processor as directed, but instead chopped and then folded them into the dressing. I used low-fat mayo and a bit of sour cream instead of the 1/4 cup of oil, which seemed a bit excessive. I also added a small amount of hot pepper sauce. Other than that, i followed the ingredients as written. I served it as a spread on crostini seasoned with salt and pepper. Truly delicious. I will be making it again to take to the cottage this weekend.

Excellent dip, made for superbowl party and it was well received. Made 1/2 the recipe and there was lots. Left out the dill (didn't have any), put celery salt in instead of celery seeds and salt (again I didn't have celery seeds), used 1 tbspn sour cream instead of oil, used 1 tbspn combo of ketchup and hot chili sauce instead of reg.chili sauce. Then added a bit more hot chili sauce and it tasted great!

It was a popular dish at my party but I thought it could use a little more flavor. Next time I will add some hot sauce and not put the shrimp in the food processor, chunks of shrimp would be better.

This recipe worked very well with herbed melba rounds. Very popular party dish!

This was a hit at my coffee morning. I served it on thin slices of french bread. I did not use the safflower oil (I agree...yuck!) and instead used 2-3 tablespoons of a nice extra virgin olive oil. I also did not have any celery seed...it would have been nice with it...but was fine without. And I used twice as much chili sauce.

This appetizer caused a sensation at a recent party --people ran right past the other appetizers to get a second taste. Used pre-cooked shrimp from the supermarket whizzed up in the food processor. Used catsup and hot sauce instead of chili sauce (didn't have any) and substituted 2 Tablesp sour cream for the oil (Oil??? Yuck!) Served it alongside homemade melba toast: slice up a day-old baguette into thin slices, paint with a little margarine and put into a 300 degree oven till brown. That's it. This would make a sensational tea sandwich on thin slices of lightly-buttered black bread. Note: This makes a LOT of spread --enough to charm 10-12 hungry people, with other hors d'oevres. Maybe you should think about making a half recipe. It cuts in half really well.

This dish was a huge hit at two different holiday parties we threw last year. People raved about it! Simple to prepare and delicious. (I left the shrimp whole.)

I've made this recipe several times because it is easy to prepare and is not as heavy as other dips or spreads. Guest love it and it's a great addition for a party.
