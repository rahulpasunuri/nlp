Forget the salsa & skewers all together...too much work. I just used the marinade on whole chicken thighs and BBQ'd them. The marinade is off the hook and my dinner guests were raving about it!!!

Made this for some dinner guests and they went crazy for the flavors. By itself, the salsa has an odd flavor, but once you combine it with the chicken it is a burst of citrus flavor. The marinade on the chicken is delicious as well - don't skip the tumeric. It adds a lot. And cooking it on the grill definitely beats the broiler. I served this on a bed of rice with a side dollup of greek yogurt for dipping and with a side of grilled baby peppers. Can't wait to make it again!

This was kind of "meh" for the amount of effort. I didn't have meyer lemons so I used 4 regular lemons and added some extra pepper for more spice. All in all, it was kind of bland but the salsa was really tasty and would be fantastic with some grilled fish or something.

I reduced the number of lemons to 4 and added a little lemon zest. I also substituted a couple of tablespoons of green sauce for the chile which gave the salsa a little kick but didn't over power it. The marinade was made exactly as specified in the recipe and the result was a hit with my wife. The salsa is a bit of work but it was such a distinctive flavor and good combination with the chicken that we will probably make it again and invite some friends to join us.

I made this last night for my husband and two small children and served with coconut rice. The chicken was great though I should have used metal skewers as my wooden ones almost burned up! The salsa was flaming hot with just 3/4 of a serrano chile. I added pineapple to the salsa because I only had regular lemons and thought this might make up some of the sweetness of Meyer lemons. The pineapple helped a lot, but the heat prevented my children from even trying it. I'd make it again, but only with adaptations.

WORST RECIPE EVER. let me start off by saying that im a that im a total citrus fiend, so despite the terrible reviews below, i was determined to test this one out myself. BIG MISTAKE. i made everything to recipe and the chicken is extremely bland, at best. the salsa is completely disgusting, too tart to ever be considered edible (and that's after a full teaspoon of sugar). if, for whatever reason you decide to completely ignore these reviews, please make sure you're capable of eating all of the salsa in one sitting because if you try to keep it overnight, it just turns into a liquidy bowl of disgustingness. PLEASE heed this warning: if you're even thinking about making this recipe, please close down your computer, run away fast, run away FAR. DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE UNLESS YOU'RE A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT AND JUST LOVE WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY.

I have to agree with the review that states it isn't good enough for the effort. At first, I followed the receipe to the T, and it just didn't wow me. I found the salsa too tart, so i added a few oranges and jalapeno. While it was refreshing, I doubt I'll make this again.

Very yummy and not difficult to make, although will need to plan more time for prep. Sectioning the lemons took quite a bit of time. Wasn't able to find the chili pepper, but no-one seemed to miss it. Makes a really nice presentation at dinner on a colorful platter.

I had just bought a big box of Meyer lemons at Costco, and I was wondering what to do with them, after I preserved some of them. This recipe was a perfect way to use them. Yes, it was a little more time consuming than I had anticipated, but the result was very refreshing. The marinade was really good, and the salsa went perfectly well with it. I did seed the cucumber to make the salsa less watery. I used the leftover salsa a few days later in a salmon salad, and it was perfect (canned salmon, chopped cucumber, capers, a little vinaigrette, and the lemon salsa). I will certainly make it again when Meyers will be plentiful.

Lemon cucumber and serrano chile? Try and make that flavor combination work?

My husband and I both loved this! I only used 6 lemons and I would cut it down to 4 next time. There was a bit too much lemon compared with the scallion and pepper. This was such a bright, fresh tasting dish. Yum!

This recipe has wonderful complimentary flavors. However, it's not good enough for the effort and expense of the lemons. I think the marinade is average, and liked the salsa a lot, though fussy to make. You want to use Meyer lemons at least 3" wide to have segments that don't fall apart. The lemons have lots of small seeds you'll need to pick out for best results. Also, remove the seeds from cucumbers to avoid watery salsa.

[4 stars for the chicken, 3 stars for the salsa.] The chicken is easy and delicious: I successfully doubled the recipe with no problems, which made enough for 6 people (I question whether the original recipe is really enough for 6 people as suggested). The salsa is more work but I think that it is worth it. Prepping the lemons isn't that bad if you have some proficiency with segmenting citrus (it took me about 15 minutes). The salsa IS very lemony, and doesn't stand alone well, however it goes really nicely with the chicken as the recipe intended.

I agree. The time spent segmenting the lemons was tediously never-ending. Even after straining the juice, it was just too much liquid with the juice of the cucumber, which, looking back, I should have hand chopped rather than chop in the processor. If there is a plus to losing so much time segmenting lemons, I do have a full ice cube tray of fresh lemon juice to use later. I also agree that the marinade was good but will forego the time-consuming salsa in the future.

this would be 2.5 forks. 3 for the chicken and 1 for the sauce. I doubled the recipe. let me just say that for $12 and 45 minutes of segmenting the meyer lemons this was utter disappointment. too much juice, no texture, and not much flavor but the lemon... chicken marinade on the other hand was fast and quite good. coriander seeds are very nice. garlicky. would make the chicken again but not the supposedly versatile sauce.

Easy, tasty, healthy. Very nice.
