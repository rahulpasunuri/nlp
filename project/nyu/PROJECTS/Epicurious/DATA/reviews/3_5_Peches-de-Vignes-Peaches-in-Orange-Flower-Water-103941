I have not tried this one but it does look wonderful. But just to let everyone know you can now by Peches de vegnes in America now. they are hard to find, and they ripen at the end of summer, august september unlike common varieties, they really are blood colored and very sweet and fragrant. Try local farmers markets. the other name is indian blood peach, and I have even found places where you can buy seed for those of you with yards.

please advise: how exactly does one prepare orange flower water? Or, can it be bought already prepared somewhere? Thanks!

A recipe for those with sophisticated taste. Simple yet so elegant. Perhaps an addition, if you dare to experiment? Maybe a drizzle of wine for colour or taste. Use as topping over a vanilla ice cream and voila another dessert variation. Or perhaps, add candied flowers as a garnish or a sprig of mint. Remember, the flower water is the perfume of this recipe. Chill recipe well for warmer weather. Accompany this dish with a turkish coffee or wine. Remember, less is more. Vicious delicious...A.S.K.

This is a bit silly. The only variable here is the quality of the fruit. Why not rate strawberries dusted with confectioners sugar, or raspberries topped with whipped cream? Buy inferior fruit, it gets a 1; great fruit merits a 4.
