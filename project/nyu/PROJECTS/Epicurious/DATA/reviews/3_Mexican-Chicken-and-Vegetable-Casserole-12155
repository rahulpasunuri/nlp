Great recipe! I like that its a casserole without rice or noodles. I juiced it up with some jalapeñoes - It says Mexican after all. I also used okra instead of corn - just my preference.

Really good and didn't take long to make. Although when I think of casserole I think of something you put together and then cook in the oven, but this was more of a make it and just finish it quick in the oven so was more time consuming on that front.

Fast and tasty.

This recipe has a great flavor. I use cut up chicken breasts so that more of the paste coats them, then I cook it in the oven on a broiling pan. I sub in canned diced tomatos to make it easier. You can skip adding the broth. There are enough juices without it. I often make this dish and freeze it for a night I don't want to cook. It reheats very well. I serve it with corn bread.

Delicious! The leftovers were even better. I don't think it needs necessarily needs the broth, the vegetables get quite liquidy from stewing on their own.

I took the advice of LLarador and added diced tomatoes, mild chili's and1/2 the zucchini. Yummy....it's a keeper.

I added canned diced tomatoes w/mild chili's and half the zucchini. I did not have white wine vinnagar so I used white wine I had left over in the fridge. The meal was awsome. It had a wonderful warm flavour, the entire family liked it. I would serve it next time with garlic toast! This is a keeper!

This was good but by the time you got to the middle of dinner you noticed how bland it was. I might try it again with twice the chicken paste and half the vegtables.

This recipe was deceptively yummy. Once I started cooking it, it seemed really boring, but the taste was wonderful. Like other reviewers, I used chicken breasts, just for ease of grilling indoors. I also jazzed it up with some Trader Joe's tomotoless corn salsa instead of frozen corn. And I also added lots of mushrooms. It took a lot longer to make than I'd planned, but was really easy to make. When I finished it, I was sure everyone in my family would turn up their noses and ask where the real dinner was, but not at all. Everyone went back for thirds !!!! I was in shock as this never happens unless my Morroccan grandmother is making her famous cous cous. I also added some canelloni beans in the last ten minutes on the stove. I'd make this recipe again, but would add more tomatoes and would use pablano chiles instead of all red bell pepper. The spice mixture that was rubbed on the chicken was confusing, it added flavor but it seemed like there needed to be something more....just not sure what

Great dish with some fixes to make it easier, more healthful and more flavorful: used 2 lbs cut-up chicken breast instead of thighs, diced canned Mexican-flavored tomatoes instead of fresh, jarred chopped garlic instead of fresh minced, added chili powder & cumin to veggies. Much less prep and lots of flavor. Cutting up the chicken into smaller pieces gives more surface area for the rub, thus more flavor overall. I worried about the chicken drying out, so might consider doing the final minutes of cooking once it's mixed in with the veggies. Overall, a hit!

The secret to this dish is to use tomatoes and zucchini straight out of the garden. Those tasteless store-bought tomatoes just won't do. Made with home grown vegetables, this is just delicious. I followed the recipe exactly.

The end result here is really not worth all the chopping, measuring, and other prepping that is required. I made it with boneless, skinless breasts I sliced up before adding to the vegetables, and have to say that using whole pieces of chicken would have yeilded even *less* satisfying resutls. The final product is really just bland, and was saved at my house only by liberal scoops of guacamole. There are way more interesting chicken recipes out there.

This is a keeper! Wonderful mixture of spices. I prepared the chicken, then baked it at 350 degrees until done. Then I added the cooked veggies, cheese, and baked another 5 minutes. Just great!

Very delicious! I added mushrooms to the vegetable mix and fresh cilantro at the end. The seasoning for the chicken is fantastic and tastes great in fajitas. I will definitely be making this again.

As was noted, this is not strictly a casserole. I used chicken legs with backs attached and they needed a lot longer than 30 min. to cook through. It's a decent recipe though and the family liked it.

This is a nice, warm dish to start with. I added rice to the vegetable mixture, extra garlic and jalepenos and topped it off with jalepeno monteray jack cheese. For those who like it spicy I definately recommend adding more spices and peppers to your liking. Adding the rice finished the dish off nicely. MCS

This recipe is lovely and very tasty,yet I wouldn't call it a "casserole." Basically, you cook everything separately and then throw it in a casserole dish just to melt the cheese! I wanted a simple one dish meal...this isn't it. Still, it was YUMMY! I'll make it again and again.

Made some adjustments to suit the tastes of the guests. Was a hit with one and all! Will take this recipe on our family ski week to have after a long day on the slopes!

Works well with chicken breasts, too. I made the veggie casserole separately. A big hit with my family.

Excellent! Use my tomatoes from the garden and zucchini. My family loved it. I loved the rub and the way the kitchen smelled when I broiled the chicken. This is a keeper, will make it as a pot luck dish or when having a casual get together!

This is a great and easy-to-do recipe. I didn't have any mozzarella then I used Smoked Cheddar. GREAT!

This is worth trying. It's not spectacular, but it has some subtle deliciousness to it. My whole family liked it. It heats up well as leftovers. Using good chicken is worth it, and might make the difference between good and so-so.

I made this casserole for a Mexican Pot Luck Dinner. For those who say it is fast and easy - do you know what a New York minute is? Carefully read the receipe and you'll realize there are far too many steps creating this so-so casserole. Make the rub, cut the vegies, grill the meat, get the sauce going, bake the thing, add the cheese! I love to cook and do not mind labor-intensive or ingredient intensive cooking, but the outcome had best be worth it. This casserole is NOT worth all of the effort and time!

These were some of the best vegetables I've ever eaten. I used a broiler instead of a grill, fresh jalapeno instead of pickled & mozzarella instead of jack. Delicious! Even my 3 year-old liked it.

I used one 4oz can chopped Green Mild Chilies instead of the minced pickled jalapeno pepper. Very tasty and a great way to use up summer zucchini.

This dish was quick and easy to prepare, used the abundance of summer vegetables I have in my garden, but I found it, over all, to be just O.K.

The best part of this recipe is the Spice Paste you make to coat the chicken. This is a wonderful rub for prepairing chicken with a Mexican/Southwestern flair. Grilled/broiled/slowcooked the chicken takes on an incredible flavor perfect for tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc... I found the casserole slightly above average for casseroles.

I've made this dish a few times now and my husband says it's the best dish I've made with chicken. It's easy, fast and very tasty. When I first made it I was in a hurry and forgot to do the last part which is to add the Monterey Jack and broil the mixture and it was still wonderful... and less fattening.
