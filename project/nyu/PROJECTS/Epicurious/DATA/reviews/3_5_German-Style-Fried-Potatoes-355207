Made this yesterday to go with bratwurst and boy was it a hit. I probably could have doubled the recipe and it would have disappeared. Followed directions exactly using olive oil instead of lard for browning potatoes. Wonderful dish, everybody loved it.

Meh. Ok for fried potatoes, but for the work involved, would rather go for regular German Potato Salad

Wonderful accompanying German sausages. Don't over cook the potatoes before you chill them or they will get too mushy. I think you can brown the potatoes fully before you add the onions and beer. I let the onions caramelize fully on low. I took the potatoes off the heat and then added them to the pan with the German sausages just as they were close to done to reheat the potatoes. I thought we were back in Germany.

Made it and liked it a lot. I added some mustard when I prepared the onions, to give them a chance to soak up the flavor. Be careful not to boil the potatoes too long beforehand, overwise they might have a slightly mushy texture.

Was not crazy about these. The taste was ok but nothing to write home about. So many good potato recipes out there, I won't be making this recipe again.

I liked the taste of these potatoes a lot, but couldn't figure out how to brown them without them sticking to the pan and turning mushy. Anybody have any ideas? I tried both a cast iron skillet and a non-stick pan. Same problem with both pans--all the golden, crusty bits got stuck to the bottom of the pan.

Wow, this was so good and the left overs were great with eggs for brunch. I did as another reviewer suggested and cooked the potatoes then put them in the freezer for about an hour, turned out great!! I also used olive oil rather than lard and the flavor was still wonderful.

These potatoes are wonderful, I've made them more than once and find that they serve 8 with a few left for the next days breakfast. Yum

Everyone loved this. I did not have time to refrigerate overnight and I used a mix of yukon gold and red skinned potatoes because I did not have enough red skinned potatoes. It still tasted great!

If you've traveled through Germany these are the potatoes to die for over there! Perfect! Frying in the pan gives them the brown crispy edges that you want.

Fantastic, in the future I would make more as every last scrap went quickly.

This dish is simply amazing. I decided not to keep the potatoes overnight in the refrigerator. Instead I put them in the freezer for 30 minutes and they came out just fine. I didnt have any bacon fat available so I used the olive oil as suggested. I thought I would miss the richness from the bacon fat, but olive oil was just fine and didnt take away from the flavor whatsoever. I like my potatoes a bit tangy so I added more malt vinegar. Yum! I highly recommend this dish for your Oktoberfest celebration!

These were very tasty. I cooked them in the oven with some bacon drippings. They browned nicely at 425. I will make these again.

Very Good! Made 1/2 recipe for breakfast for 2. Made along with fried tomatoes. The juice, as well as runny egg yolks was great mixed in with the potatoes.
