Easily made for an impromptu dinner party for 8. Huge hit -- all asked for recipe. Only substitution was dry dill in place of fresh which was not on hand.

Very good recipe for a weeknight meal. My kids even loved it. I used FAGE 0% plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I used 1/4 c. dried dill as we love the taste of this herb and we didn't have any fresh available.

I halved the recipe and used 2 6oz wild salmon filets with skin. I also used low fat sour cream, just barely a Tb Dijon, & 1 1/2 Tb dried dill instead of fresh (didn't have it on hand). The sauce was a little flat at that point, so I added just a splash of white wine and a sprinkle of lemon pepper and garlic salt, which perked it up nicely. I also allowed the salmon to sit with the garlic, sea salt, and lemon pepper in the fridge while the sauce ingredients came together. I covered liberally with sauce (using probably about a 1/4 cup per piece) and after 20 minutes, the salmon was slightly warm in the center, but not fully cooked. I added an additional 10 minutes which ended up being a bit too much - salmon was slightly firmer than I would have liked. Enjoyed the flavor and would probably try again with fresh dill and 25 minutes of cooking time.

I rated this recipe as just "good" because I thought it could have been much better. I used a very nice French dijon, dill from my own patch, and ended up doubling the dill, still, after baking, it seemed too faint. The dijon was there perfectly, but the rest was almost entirely lost. I think I would have done better to make a basic baked salmon with lemon and dill instead. So, I guess it was "good" for what it was, but I was hoping for much more. Simple-yes, easy-yes, but in the end, just pretty ok.

My husband and I loved this! He's Gluten Free so it was the perfect meal for him ... and still managed to appeal to my "eat anything" sensibilities. Like one other reviewer, I used shallots instead of onion and changed the mustard to 1 1/2 tbsp. We also had to cook the salmon longer in our oven (perhaps our piece was thicker vs longer?) Great dish!

Loved the mustard dill sauce. Seems like it will go good with a lot of fish dishes.

This recipe couldn't get any more simple yet delicious with dinner ready in under a half hour. I used shallots instead of onion which turned out quite good.

excellent recipe. I also did it a third time but substituted yoghurt for the sour cream and chives for the dill as my husband didn't like the dill. I liked this version even better but both are really good. served this with smashed mini potatoes mixed in with olive oil and lemon juice and lemon zest and an arugula salad with same olive oil/lemon juice dressing and shaved parmesan and pine nuts. the whole thing was very summery and light..

Great recipe. Simple, elegant, and quite tasty. Only change I would make would be to up the dill a bit. Will definitely make this a regular!

I substituted some olive oil instead of the sour cream and it still turned out great.

I made this recipe exactly as written. The fish was moist and delicious, and I loved the sauce. I do agree with other reviewers about the mustard being a little over powering. I will probably reduce the amount next time, otherwise, a great, simple dish!

This is the best salmon recipe I've done. It's easy and delicious. The 20 minutes baking time is right on. Maybe people's ovens are not the right temperature? The sauce kept the fish moist. I would definitely reommend it.

Tried this tonite and was very pleased with the result. The topping keeps the salmon moist. We used some sauce with the finished product as well. Delicious!

I forgot the garlic and it was fine without, don't skimp on the dill. Simple and tasty-the freshness and quality of the products used help this recipe shine.

Rating: 4
So simple yet delicious! My husband went crazy for this recipe. I marinated the salmon in a couple tbsps of fresh lemon & lime juice for about a half hour, and added chili powder to the salt/pepper/garlic sprinkle. Also upped the onion to 4 tbsps. D-lish!

This salmon was so easy and was delicious. I didn't have time for the sauce to sit but it was still great. Used low fat sour cream for an extra healthy version. It is very green though so if your kids are fussy, this might not be the best choice

Rating: 4
I served this salmon to my in-laws who live by the sea, and they said it was beyond compare! I substituted the sour cream with a low fat version, and it went without notice. The last 8 mins of baking, I put a bunch of asparagus (drizzled with olive oil, rock salt, and reg-parmasean) in the oven to serve at the same time. Fantastic!

Rating: 3
This was a bit too rich for my taste, but my husband liked it a lot. Based on earlier reviews, I baked it 30 minutes but it was way too done for my taste (I like salmon barely warm in the center). BUT, it's extremely easy to make and quite tasty.

Rating: 3
So so easy and so so good. Have also used it on halibut and other fish. Great weeknight dish and even the three year old loves it.

Rating: 3
I tripled this recipe and made it for a dinner party of 12. It was really tasty, and best of all, was easy to make mostly ahead of time and just baked while I got to hang out with our guests. After reading other review, I slathered the fish with lots of sauce, and put a small bowl of extra on the table for a garnish. The sauce kept the fish very moist while baking. FYI, I too found it took more like 35-40 minutes to cook just right, and with all that sauce there was no worry of over-drying. Served with asparagus and rice pilaf -- yum.

Just ok. Pretty boring. Was easy though.

Agree with prior review that 20 minutes is off. I cooked closer to 40 and it turned out well.

Rating: 3
I found no problems with this dish. Easy to prepare and delicious, it is perfect for a quick dinner night. I found that the key to this dish is the salt one sprinkles on to the salmon before topping it with the sauce. It rounded out the flavor very nicely. One issue however- 20 minutes is far off from the needed baking time. It was closer to 30. All the same, the salmon tasted marvelous and I will most definitely be making it again.

BTW - this sauce is great with chips as well. Try it out!! You'll be pleasantly surprised!! Happy cooking!!

Rating: 4
This was EXCELLENT!! I didn't allow the sour cream to come to room temp, just plopped it right onto the salmon fillet. BTW, my fillet didn't have the skin anymore. I remedied that by slipping a few pats of butter underneath & on top before putting on the sauce. Didn't have onions, but substituted with garlic & garlic salt. Added a bit of ground pepper & more fresh dilled than called for. The sauce was incredible & kept the salmon from drying out while baking. I don't know why others thought it was bland. If you run into blandness, just 'kick it up a notch' & try adding a few spices. Salt & pepper always adds flavor. Happy cooking!!

This one was a disappointment, after reading the reviews and deciding to make it. I found it bland. There are better ways to prepare salmon listed on this site.

Rating: 4
Prepared it with no fat sour cream for a nice light dinner. One of the best recipes I've tried - definitely a keeper. Salmon was moist enough without extra sauce so we set it aside. My husband loved the sauce so much, he finished it with chips and said it was the best chip dip he's ever had.

Rating: 3
Great stuff, easy enough for an 18-year-old student ;). Didn't let the sauce sit 1 hour because of time constraints, but it still turned out awesome. The sauce is simple enough to play around with and is good for more than just salmon; I like to spread it on Wasa crackers or dip bread in it.

Rating: 3
The sauce is best when baked entirely with the salmon; I add the last third portion with ten minutes of time left in the oven.

This is a great quick and easy salmon dish. The extra sauce isn't really necessary, in fact I prefer the baked on sauce to the uncooked. This is now in our regular rotation. I use Sockeye or Coho, frozen if not in season.

This was a great dish. I made the salmon, and put it over salad greens. It was easy to make & feeds and is healthy. I used non-fat sour cream, and the result was still very good. I like it because it's different.

I prepared this as directed and was very pleased. To the cook concerned about amounts: The amount of salmon is one one and one half pound of salmon fillet, not 11 one half pound pieces.

This recipe was pretty good. But the quantity of fish suggested for 4-6 people is surely a typo?? Half a pound per person is more standard (not two pounds per person!). I prepared as directed in the original recipe, except I cut the mustard in half because I'm not all that fond of mustard. My fiance and I liked the extra sauce applied after cooking.

I served this to a family with 4 children (who were going to "try" it), and they just loved it. They still talk about the special salmon dish they had. .

This was easy and very tasty! The salmon was moist and the dill topping was plenty and I didn't have any reason to add any more.

I've never cooked with dill before, but this was surprisingly tasty. When you say dill, I think of pickles, and pickles and salmon didn't seem to go together. This dish is quick and worth you trying it.

I grilled instead of baked my salmon with only a little olive oil, then I just squeezed some lemon on it, perfect. Then for the sauce, I used low fat sour cream, fresh dill, a little lemon juice, some Dijon mustard and a little sugar and it was to die for! Skipped the onions and garlic and it was devoured by my family. Yummy!

The absolut best recipe for Salmon!!!! Not only is it perfect & delicious, but it's one step cooking. I just love making this over & over again.

Rating: 2
Upon tasting this, I experienced an epiphany: grilled salmon is simply better than baked salmon. Accordingly, should you find yourself with a salmon but no grill, you could safely rely on this recipe for instructions on baking a piece of your fish and garnishing it with a pleasant (but ordinary) sour cream and dill sauce.

This recipe was wonderful! The sauce is great warm, but it is just so-so cold. When I make it again, I will use it all when I bake the salmon. I also used light sour cream, but it didn't seem to take away from the sauce.

I thought this recipe was great!!! I used bold and spicy mustard instead of dijon and used shallots instead of onions. It was divine. I also baked the fish with lemon slices on top it made a fantastic dinner.

I did not like this recipe. It was okay at best. The sauce was too thick and had a gravy-like consistency. I don't like gravy with salmon. I took the suggestion to heat the sauce to thin it out, but that did not help. Salmon is so delicious and there are so many better recipes for it.

This dish was super yummy! I substituted Knudson Fat Free sour cream and it was fantastic. Ditto on putting all of the sauce on the salmon before baking instead...the sauce is better hot. I would definitely make this again.

This is a delicious and simple. Added a little fresh lemon to the sauce. Used a French poupon mustard and I think fresh dill is imperative. Will definitely make this again.

This was a delicious recipe (and I wasn't able to get the fresh dill at the time...I substituted with dried dill) My husband is very iffy about fish and dislikes salmon so I used trout. It worked beautifully. He raved about it; probably his favorite fish recipe now. Next time I'll definitely use fresh dill.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I followed the advice of the reviewers and added 2 Tbs of lemon juice to the fish, & I also put only a little of the sauce on the fish, for the last 5 minutes of baking. I used dried dill (about 2 tbs to 2 1/2 tbs) and it worked fine and tasted great.

This went over very well for all three of us eating last night. It was really easy to make and had enough flavor. I added some lemon juice to it, but might add a little more next time. Only problem was we left the extra sauce out and too near the stove, so it was curdled by the time the fish was ready. Will chill it next time.

The sauce for the salmon is delicious. This is very easy to make with impressive results. I also saved more sauce on the side to eat as a dip for the fish when it is served.

I am a simple cook and this is a simply wonderful salmon recipe! Just a few hints for those who have not yet made this... Use some lemon in the sauce if you like a little more zest, and if you're trying to lose weight (or maintain) use low-fat sour cream (it will not affect the flavor of the sauce). My sister and main man were actually fighting over who got the last piece! Enjoy...

If I saw this recipe in a magazine alone without the review I doubt if I would have tried it. I am so glad I did! This was an excellent dish and I followed all the reviewers' tips adding the lemon juice and the sauce toward the end of the cooking time. I loved the taste of the minced fresh garlic. This definitely could be a company dish. Three and a half stars!!!

This is a boring recipe. Though the dill sauce was pretty good, you can do better by marinading the salmon in soysauce, some lemon juice, garlic, etc. If I did make this recipe again, I would change a lot of things.

I did not have grainy mustard on hand so used Dijon and backed off a little on the quantity...very good. To some who may not have liked the sauce, I think the key is a light hand...the sauce is very good but very strong. A slight drizzle with a portion on the side is best. This is also great cold for lunch the next day!

This doesn't rank in the top three of our favorite salmon preparations, but it might be fourth. It certainly was easy. Next time I'll try the suggestions regarding the lemon juice and the bread crumbs.

After making this dish a few times and taking the suggestions of the reviewers, I'll add my "2 cents Worth." We liked it best rubbed with lemon and adding the sauce during the last 5 minutes of cooking. I'm glad the reviewer from West Vancouve made note not to forget the garlic because I did once, and liked it a lot better when it was added. I did find that we were able to do nicely with 1/2 the amount of sauce.

Rating: 3
I too rubbed lemon onto the fish prior to baking. I rubbed a little sauce on during the last couple of minutes. It definitely discolored the fish. Most intriguing is that I inadvertantly did not include the mustard and it was still delicious. I can't wait to try it again the proper way

This recipe was not only easy to make, but delicious as well! Everyone went nuts over the salmon!! I rubbed some lemon juice in the salmon before cooking to keep it moist and did not add the sauce until the last few minutes of cooking and then served on the side. I can not wait to make this one again!

You can't get much easier than this recipe. I have made it many times and it's always a success. I actually use a little extra mustard for added zip and I too don't like to bake the fish with the sauce spread on. Wait until the last few minutes of cooking or until you serve. It's much tastier. Don't let this one pass you by!

Rating: 3
Sooooo easy... Very nice, especially if you like to use a lot of dill. I went easy on the mustard and it was still tasty. The garlic adds zip and would be missed if it were omitted... I brushed a little bit of the sauce over the salmon before baking and that worked very well rather than spreading it on. Enjoy!

Don't put the sauce on before baking-it doesn't look good or improve the flavor in any way. Serve it with the sauce and enjoy--it is fabulous, easy and delicious!

THIS IS A QUICK, EASY AND DELICIOUS RECIPE. Perfect for company or when there is little time to cook. Preparation is minimal. Don't spread the sauce over the fish before baking. I think it is too much and it does not bake well either. Spoon sauce over the fish before serving only. A perfect recipe.
