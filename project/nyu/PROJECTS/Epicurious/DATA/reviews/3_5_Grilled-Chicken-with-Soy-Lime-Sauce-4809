Easy and delicious. Added 1T honey as other reviewers mentioned and skipped the curry powder (hubs doesn't like curry). Great week night throw together meal. Made with grilled veggies and israeli couscous. Yum!

This was delicious! My husband actually said it was a taste explosion. I used slightly less lime juice than the recipe said, plus added in honey to the marinade. I also added chopped fresh cilantro. Before boiling the sauce, I added 1 Tablespoon brown sugar. We served with steamed brown rice and steamed sugar snap peas.

Deeeeelish!!! I love the mismatched harmony of the flavours. I didn't add the curry, though. The children in my house can't stomach it. Will definitely make it again.

what a repellent mish-mash of flavors. it's a good thing i've got a rep as a good cook to my boyfriend or i might have had some trouble living this one down. i've been airing out the house all day and the sour stink still permeates. 1/4 cup of lime juice and that much curry powder? either i've got waaaay too strong a spice in my cupboard or i was eyeballs-deep into cocktail hour when this recipe sounded like a good idea. not even 2 Tbsp of honey could alleviate the bitter goo that i boiled up while the chicken was on the grill. in a word: gross.

Added a little brown sugar to the marinade instead of honey as some reviews suggusted. This is a great low cal tasty dish.

This recipe was a big hit and even my daughter (normally very fussy) enjoyed it. I added 1.5 tsp of honey as someone had suggested but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I would reduce the chicken stock next time to get a thicker stock and might add a bit more honey during the sauce stage ... while the marinade was fabulous on the chicken, in the sauce it was a bit too tart. Still, for the quality of the chicken alone it earns 4 stars.

Loved this chicken as did my family. Quick and easy yet interesting flavors. Always looking for something to make with Curry powder. The curry was not too over powering. Didn't make the sauce as i didn't read the whole recipe. Will try next time. This will be a staple for the grill. Can't wait to try w/ beef!

I made this dish recently and it was a big hit with everyone. I made some changes like other reviewers had recomended. Used less sodium soy sauce and more garlic. I let it marinate overnight and also I didnt strain the sauce. I added some corn starch to thicken it. This dish is well balanced the way it is but if one likes stonger flavours more garlic and curry can make it a bit more interesting.

Another summer staple for us, I usually dispense with the sauce.

I loved this! I tasted the marinade before putting it on the meat and agreed with some of the other reviewers that it was a little sour, so I added a few teaspoons of honey. I cut some chicken thighs and also some beef tri tip into bite size pieces, marinated for an hour, then made kebabs and grilled them. The flavor of the marinade was great for both the chicken and the beef. The texture of the chicken was divine - very tender, but not mushy - and the beef was perfect. I didn't have any trouble reducing the leftover marinade with the chicken stock to make a great sauce. I served it with a coucous pilaf and the meal was fantastic!

I really wanted to love this, but didn't. It was so easy, and had flavors I love-and was healthy, to boot. But it really tasted only sour to me. I'll give two forks cause DH liked it.

My fiance loves curry but I find it can be overwhelming so I hardly ever make anything with it. I was surprised at how great this turned out!! Like other reviewers, I did not strain the sauce. I was only cooking for two so used 1/3 can chicken broth and 1 tsp of curry. I did use a whole onion though, so the 'sauce' became more of an curry-onion-smothered type thing when boiled for a while. The flavors were really great, will make again for sure!!

I second what Redwop said. Take care not to overmarinate it, and discard maybe half of the marinade before reducing it with the chicken broth.

Rating: 2
i thought this had great potential, but the results were overwhelming. i followed the recipe as is, just doubled it. the lime was too strong, the curry, garlic and ginger combo was overkill (maybe eliminate the curry), and it lacked something a little sweet to cut the saltiness and acidity. i still think it could be good, but it needs alterations. also, the sauce didn't thicken so maybe adding cornstarch like a lot of the comments say would be a good idea. could it be i over-marinated?

Rating: 3
I have made this almost every week since finding the recipe a couple of months ago. I buy the family pack of bone/skinless chicken thighs, rinse and pat them dry and put them in a Ziplok bag with the marinade for a couple of days. Come serving time, I broil them for six minutes on each side and brush them with the reduced marinade. Makes a great brownbag lunch ....

Rating: 4
Marinated & barbequed skinned thighs & legs slowly over mesquite & covered w/foil to rest in low oven. Used marinade as baste & then poured tiny bit left on top before oven. Everything perfect, looked spectacular, aroma fantastic & tasted great. Read comments, will heat curry powder in oil before adding to marinade next time & double or more the sauce so I have something to serve for dipping or rice. I would never strain all that garlic or ginger. So easy!

Rating: 2
Pretty good; had no limes, so used lemon instead. Marinated 1 hour; no problem with saltiness. Did not strain, but unable to thicken sauce. Had good flavor. Next time I think I'll buy thin chicken cutlets and try. Thicker bonesless breasts tend to be too dry for our taste.

After years of ho-hum chicken dishes, this one was out of this world! Being that we are not fans of curry and ginger, we substituted cilantro and cumin instead. We also did not strain it as it was great to have the added texture in the sauce. We will be using this recipe again and again!

Too salty for our taste. Took FOREVER to thicken and just wasn't worth it in the end. Maybe with low sodium tamari sauce it might be better, but not worth the try anytime soon.

Delicious and simple! This was the perfect recipe for the first grilling night of the spring. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a tad more lime juice. I also grilled the onions, and they really made a statement in this dish. I served over brown rice and with sugar snap peas and carrots. Very good, and I'll be making it again for sure.

I have made this dish several times, and we really enjoy this recipe. Very easy, and it turns out very tender and pleasant to the pallet if you are a fan of subtle Thai flavors. I used a mallet on the chicken breasts to about a 1/2 inch, did go over the marinade time by an hour (which didn't hurt it), and used an indoor grill. Grilling or broiling is definitely necessary for this recipe. I did not strain the marinade, but did emulsify it along with a bit of olive oil, and sauteed it for a few minutes prior to adding the broth. I also added generous black pepper and a bit of course salt. This last time I decided to add some sour cream (out of whipped) to the sauce for a creamier consistancy since I wasn't eating rice (low carb). Served it with some nice fresh green beans, and it was very good too. There's really no screwing this one up.

I didn't like the sauce at all. It was very mediocre and I threw it out. The chicken was not bad, so I used it in salads. Plenty of really good grilled chicken recipes way better than this one.

This is a great way to spice up frozen chicken breasts or tenders. Didn't strain the marinade as well and accidentally unloaded a whole can of chicken broth which worried me. But in the end the sauce reduced perfectly in exactly the time indicated and was fine. Paired with a simple romaine and cilantro salad dressed with rice wine vinegar and lime juice. Light and tasty.

This dish was very popular with my picky family. It barbecued beautifully and was very tender! I followed the common advice to not strain the sauce and might even add more to it next time. I also did as suggested by serving with rice, adding sauteed vegetables and parsley to it at the end for a little colour. Delicious!

Rating: 4
I agree with the other reviewers - this was easy & delicious. I'm also in agreement with Stephanie from Baton Rouge who "didn't strain the sauce" - I didn't either, nor did I add the canned chicken broth - I boiled the marinade, then pureed it with a hand blender, which resulted in a thick, tasty sauce for the chicken. Brilliant. I used 16 chicken tenders in place of the breast halves & cooked them in the broiler, since we don't have a grill. It was still fabulous. A definite keeper!

My advice: DON'T STRAIN THE SAUCE!! This was really quite good, and easy to make, but to me what really took it up a notch was not straining the sauce. Having those nice marinated, sliced onions, bits of garlic and spicy ginger not only made it taste very, very good, but it looked prettier served with the onions too.....otherwise, I think it might have been a little boring. Easy, quick and good!

I really like this dish. It was much spicier than I expected which was a pleasant surprise! A quick note to everyone saying how salty the soy sauce is.. did you know that soy sauce should be consumed within 2 weeks of opening the bottle? the older it is, the saltier it becomes.. I used Kikkoman soy sauce.. the entire 1/4 cup.. and it wasn't a salty sauce at all!

This was a very good dish. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and it was still a little salty. I served it with curry rice and some steamed vegetables which complemented the sauce very well. I too, didn't strain the sauce and added more garlic which I think helped a lot.

Michelle from Austin, TX was right! I added the extra lime and garlic and wow! The flavors are unbelievable - I wasn't sure I'd like this, I'm so glad we tried it - it's now one of our favorite things to do on the grill. Don't bother to strain the sauce, it's better with the chunks. Serve it over basmati rice, it's nice and sticky and it soaks up all the delicious sauce.

My boyfriend and I really loved this recipe. I did change it a lot, though: I added nearly twice the amount of lime juice specified, and more garlic. Due to time contraints I didn't marinate the chicken as long as specified; however I used my brand new George Foreman grill (!) and that kept everything juicy, tender, and tasty. I like a chunky sauce so I didn't strain the marinade, I just boiled it all and then added some corn starch to thicken. The result was so tasty we ended up eating every single bit, using rice and bread to soak up extra sauce... YUM!

I'm not exactly sure if I can even qualify to rate this recipe because I changed it so much, but I liked the results so I thought I'd share. For starters, I don't like grilled boneless chicken; I like chicken on the bone with the skin on, nevertheless the ingredients sounded good so I decided to try this recipe as marinade and basting sauce. I made the recipe as per the instructions except that I omitted the onions and the chicken broth but added some oil. I marinated the chicken for a 1/2 hour or so and then used the sauce to baste with while cooking. I thought the flavor was great and I would definitely make it again.

We use a lot of marinades and have found this one for chicken to beautifully enhance the meat while cooking outdoors. If cooking w/mesquite chips it compliments the marinade. Enjoy w/a nice Sauvignon Blanc.

I needed more marinade, so I added a portion of lemon juice and a portion of Mirin equal to the lime and Soy sauce. I also added a couple of drops of sesame oil and some green curry paste. After I marinaded the chicken, I boiled it, strained it, added some honey and thickened it with some arrowroot to make a velvety sweet and sour sauce. (This cuts down the salt ratio, so saltiness wasn't a problem). I'm trying it with pork chops tonight (I had leftover sauce) and I think this would be GREAT with Chicken wings.

Rating: 1
This dish is quite overrated. The soy sauce overpowered the chicken and made the dish extremely salty, as I had anticipated. 1/2 the amount would have been sufficient. The soy-lime sauce tasted like gritty soy sauce. Everyone knows that curry doesn't give off its true intense flavor until cooked (i.e. with a small amount of oil, by itself, in the bottom of a pot). Boiling it in the sauce does not help. The curry did not fully dissolve in the sauce and was enjoyable.

I love this dish! I agree, curry should be added to the title of this recipe. It's so flavorful and easy. I also double the marinade recipe and add 2 tbsp of honey. I serve this over rice with a garnish of fresh chopped cilantro and chopped peanuts. It's delicious with beef too.

I have made this recipe several times, and each time it came out delicious. Each time I made rice as an accompaniment. This time however, I laid a layer of mashed potatoes under the chicken and drizzled the sauce on top. I thought that you could not make this dish taste any better--until now. Try the mashed potatoes--it soaks up the delicious sauce so nicely.

Rating: 3
I thought that this was a very tasty dish. I took the sliced onions used in the marinade and grilled them along side the chicken and then added them to the boiled sauce. I think the sauce could use a little corn starch; it was a little thin. I did double the sauce which gave me enough sauce to drizzle over the rice. I used madras curry powder (hot) and it gave an extra kick to the dish, but I do think adding some red pepper flakes would be good as well.
