This is a great recipe. I have been making these every year since the recipe appeared in the November 2004 issue, usually searching high and low for the recipe. I follow the recipe and they turn out great every time.

I read the reviews and partly cooked them in the microwave first and I also used both cinnamon and chinese five spice powder. These carrots were great!

Excellent as part of a middle eastern meal. I added more lemon juice and cayenne, and sprinkled with chopped cilantro.

Sliced carrots on the diagonal and did as other suggested and parboiled them in the microwave first. Then followed the recipe - FABULOUS! Great alternative as a vegtable, will definitely make again!

I agreed with the cook who used the five spice powder, and I used a bit less sugar than called for. The flavors or the 5 spice powder enriched the dish much more than just cinnamon. It was delicous and will be served at our Canadian Thanksgiving in a week!

These get four forks the second time I made them - with the following modifications: steamed the carrots before sauteeing them to soften them up; and did not add water. The first time I made these according to the recipe, and the water really diluted the flavor (and took forever to reduce - never did, really).

I think this will become my new standby recipe for carrots! This was and extremely easy and delicious way to prepare carrots.

Nice and easy to make with a interesting and successful reach of flavor. I recommend adding even more flavor than called for in the recipe though.

Whoa! I loved this recipe! The flavors were incredible and the dish was simple and easy to prepare. This dish is definitely sweet, but has such a unique blend of flavors -- especially liked the cinnamon.

Very tasty but the carrots are a bit too sweet for my taste. I would still make it again but with a bit less sugar.

I'm lazy, so used bagged baby carrots. This was so easy and really good! Carrots will definitely be in our meals again.

Easy recipe that adds a great sweet flavor to contrast spicy foods. I served it with the "Moroccan slow- cooked lamb - it was great!

Looking for a way to use up some carrots, I found this quick and easy recipe. Carrots aren't really my favorite vegetable and since I was only making them because I had nothing else, I wasn't expecting too much. The dish, however, turned out to be very tasty. I didn't have any lemon or cinammon so I used Chinese five spice powder and cayenne, which was probably better anyway. The dish was a bit sweet but I didn't find it overly sweet. In any case, it was a good counterpoint to my pork chop. This will become a staple carrot recipe for those times when there are no other vegetables in my fridge. I highly recommend using the five-spice powder.

Was I the only one who found the glaze to be too sweet? I added extra cayenne & lemon juice, hoping to counter it, but it dulled the flavor of the carrots. The kitchen did smell wonderful as they were cooking, but somehow the flavors didn't blend the way I'd hoped. I don't think I'll make this again, but if I do, I'll definitely be using less sugar.

This was a hit with my family members! Everyone raved about the sweet yet spicy flavour of the carrots and most of all, the wonderful glaze made from it. Add more cayenne for more heat if you like but it is a wicked dish and I've made it a few times by request now.

This is a simple dish with complex flavors. We loved it alongside spiced quinoa timbales. Be careful not to overcook as the slight crunch is nice!

Different way to do carrots, with a little more kick. A winner!

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a big hit. No one ever expects the carrots to be spicy and it always seems to be a nice suprise. Cutting the carrots lengthwise seemed to be a lot of work for no reason but I tried it once just slicing them and for some reason it just wasn't as good. I have found that the volume of carrots reduces substantially. I made 2 pounds for 6 people the first time I made this, and it barely seemed enough for 3 people. I double the recommended amount now. I also add a dash of crushed red pepper, as I and my family love spicy food.

These carrots are great! The bite of the cayenne is a nice counterpoint to the sweetness of the glaze.

These are the only cooked carrots my carrot-hating kids will eat. Just a hint of the Middle East and very slightly sweet. Yummy!

Good carrot recipe. I agree with a previous reveiwer's comment about adding more cayenne. Even using peeled, baby carrots, I spent 25 minutes slicing them lengthwise. It was well received but I think a bit labor intensive for such a simple side dish.

These disappeared quickly at a potluck gathering. I added an extra 1/8 teaspoon of red pepper because spicy is good. During the last step, watch carefully because the glaze burns easily.

Very easy with a nice zip! I recommend using a chopping tool. Doing this by hand took forever!

If you're looking for a side dish that's a bit sweet this one has nice flavor. Being simple to prepare is always a bonus.

Very good. Perhaps I had very tough, carrots, but I thought making the carrot sticks was quite a bit of work. It took me almost a half hour just to peel and cut up the carrots into the little sticks called for in the dish. (A food processor or mandoline that juliennes would be fine, though.) I'd either just slice into rounds or use baby carrots cut in two instead. Very flavorful with a nice kick. This also made far more than the servings suggested. It easily serves six and possibly eight if you are serving other sides.

this was one of the best side dishes I've ever served at Thanksgiving -- sweet but with enough of a kick to keep it from being cloying. Very easy to make as well. This will become a regular on holiday menus

This was fantastic... the cayenne adds such great flavor. I actually put in a little extra - gave it a great kick.
