This recipe was surprisingly good. I made it a month ago for a party attended by serious "foodies" and am still getting compliments. Like other reviewers I added unsweetened shredded coconut and would do so again. I intended to add some Caribbean spices as some reviewers recommend but, after tasting, the BF and I decided it was delicious as is. Used real fresh crab which has such a wonderful flavor- wouldn't bother with the fake stuff.

This is wonderful! I use this in our catering all the time for Caribbean themed events. Tweaked it a little by adding in some more Caribbean spices as well as using imitation crab w/ the lump crab (gives it color and a little sweetness w/ the spicy). Seasoned up the plantain chips as well. Yum!

If I ever make crab dip this is it. I've never gotten anything but compliments on it, though I serve it with crusty bread rather than the plantains. Yum.

Utterly DISGUSTING!! I will never make this again. I would've given it no forks, but it's not an option. For the amount of time & effort that I put in you could taste each individual ingredient. UGH!!

This was light and tasted of fresh crab but I think it could use a flavor boost. I served it with plantain chips and it went nicely with our carribian theme.

i have made this several times and think it is a nice change from the more typical heavy mayo-based crab dip recipes. like other reviewers, i add unsweetened shredded coconut and more jalepeno. intead of the plantain chips, i serve it with sweet potato chips and rice crackers (sesame and wasabi are both nice).

Even with all the great suggestions offered by other reviews this is really so-so and and expensive one at that. It was much better on the tortilla chips than the crackers, didn't opt for the plaintain chips after the reviews. I added 2 whole jalepenos and it still had little zip to it. Added a cup of freshly shredded coconut (a lot of work with little results!). If you really love crab you might like this. Maybe some curry powder would help it along?

I made this dish with the alterations listed below. Although I had high hopes for it, I found it bland and definitely nothing special. I don't think the variations caused the problem, I just think it's missing something. I might try it as a salad with chunks of pineapple, but I did not like it as a dip (neither did my guests).

I run a catering business and this dip is one of my best sellers. I add small diced mangoes and some more red chili peppers so its both sweet and spicy. Great combination of flavors.

This is an easy and delicious dip. People at our dinner party loved it!!! Definite keeper. I did follow the advice of a few of the other reviews with the lime juice.

Although this didn't have much of a tropical flavor -- the coconut milk was indiscernable -- this was a bit hit at a recent dinner party. Since I made it in advance, I held off on all of the lime juice just to see how the flavors melded. For my taste, more jalapeno would have been fine, but it depends on your guests. Definitely worth making again.

I made this for a weddng shower for 30 people last weekend paired with Carr's water crackers. I used 1 and a half jalapenos and 2 T. of lime juice. I also added 1 C. of coconut flakes. It was a big hit!

This recipe got great reviews at our party. It was nearly gone by the end of the night- that says a lot! However, most of us couldn't really sense the "Caribbean flavor" to this. It just tasted great with good ol' tortilla chips and bread.

This came out very good, with a nice refreshing taste. Was good with the plantain chips and equally good with good quality corn tortilla chips. I suggest using twice the amount of jalapeno pepper and cutting the lime juice back to 2 tbs. Otherwise, this is a hit.

Hate to say it, but this recipe made me add more mayo - which I normally try and avoid. Next time I'll use my precious Dungeness crab in my old standby - Hot Artichoke Crab Dip!!

This was a BIG hit with lots of requests for the recipe. Fresh crab added to the great tast. I think I will add some raw coconut to give it just a little more coconut flavor.

A hit at the party! I followed the suggestions from the SanFran cook, except I did use a whole pound of crabmeat. I used backfin, so I bet it would be even better if I chose Jumbo Lump meat. I agree that adding coconut shreds is good for flavor and thickening. Crab meat is expensive, so I didn't double or triple it, which was fine! It came out to be more than enough as a side appetizer at a party for about 40-50 people. You get lots of dip from this!

I have made this dip several times and always follow the recipe exactly. It always turns out great. I have friends who want me to make it whenever we have dinner party. It is simple to double and triple for a crowd - I've made it for 30 people at a Caribbean-themed party. I never fry plaintans. I serve with tortilla chips and Carr's water crackers. Highly recommend!

A HUGE hit at our Caribbean theme party. I made some changes, too. Increased coconut milk and mayo. Reduced lime juice. Added coconut extract and sugar. Changes I'll make next time: increase jalapeno, reduce onion and lime (even more). All is not lost if you don't like cilantro; I left it out altogether and it was still a delicious dip. Received many rave reviews on this one.

This recipe just needs a little modifying to go from ok to incredible. Increase the coconut milk to 2/3 of a can. Increase the mayonaise (use light which is less overpowering) to 3/4 cup. Cut the lime juice to 2Tbs. Add unsweetened grated coconut. You can also use 1/4 pd of crab (which cuts the cost) and 1/4 pound of shrimp. The shredded coconut thickens the dip so you don't need as much seafood. I served it this way and it received raves. The coconut flavor came through wonderfully.

I agree with other reviewers, I thought this was kind of bland. I toasted some coconut flakes and put them on top. I also added more lime juice and more jalapeno, which made a big improvement. With the extra kick, everybody enjoyed this.

This recipe was a success at a party I recently had, though I did doctor it up a little based on previous reviewers comments. I added some coconut extract to enhance the flavor, as well as adding some sweetened shredded coconut.

Disaster...thought the flavors in the dip were very bland. I took the time to fry the plantain chips a couple hours before serving them. They were nice and crispy right after frying, but, after storing them in tupperware, they became soggy. Would not make this dish again.

You don't really taste the coconut. Maybe garnishing with shaved coconut would enhance the flavor. Not delicious enough to warrant the expense of making it!

I made this salad with imitation crab meat and it turned out great. my husband loves it and i have already made it three times. i have also served it in a tortilla wrap with fresh spinach. it is really good and pretty with sliced oranges.

I made this dish as a final exam in my cooking class and substituted lobster for the crab. Unfortunately, when it was time to mix it in the blender, it was nowhere to be found. So, the dip wasn't as creamy as it should've been, but was chunky instead, like a salad. I let it sit in the walk-in for 2 days and brought it out on potluck night, and the flavors had blended wonderfully. Not even a drop was left when I went back for seconds! It's a beautiful dish that I would try again, maybe this time with a blender!

This is one of the best seafood recipes you will EVER find. I substituted lobster meat (which I bought frozen and simply pulsed it in a food processor) and I don't think people at my parties want to eat anything else! You MUST try this!

I thought this was wonderful and beautiful as well. The plantains are a great choice for something different to dip into crab dishes and they are very easy to make ahead of time. Living along the Gulf of Mexico provides us with the most beautiful, fresh, jumbo lump crab meat and many wonderful crab dishes. (I can't even fathom the one viewer using canned crab but do understand if you're in say...South Dakota, that you don't have much choice).One crab dish you see quite often at parties is called West Indies Salad. It is fabulous but one can get tired of seeing it all the time. This coconut, crab dip is a wonderful new replacement and so incredibly easy to make. I can't wait to introduce to the people around here.

This was outstanding. Used fresh lump crab and was really surprised that you could taste the crab. I agree with the earlier reviewer--you can't taste the coconut milk at all. Next time I may puree some fresh coconut in the milk before adding. Didn't feel up to making the plantain chips, so tried commercial. Wrong. Water crackers were much better.

This recipe was easy to make and interesting in color. When I looked at the picture I realized that mine was very different. I used canned crab and followed the directions closely but my dip was a green color and the picture was not. It was obviously from the cilantro being pureed with the mayo. I let it set overnight and the flavors really came alive. I think I might add a little coconut extract next time. You can barely taste the coconut milk. Oh well, it tasted great.
