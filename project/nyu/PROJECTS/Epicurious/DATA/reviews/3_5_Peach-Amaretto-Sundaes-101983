Great recipe! I needed a quick dessert and this was perfect! I used soy vanilla ice cream. The flavors were amazing. Not just for summer!

Great recipe! The flavors of brandy and amaretto are not overwhelming (I thought they would be), but subtle. Looks elegant, but so easy.

Excellent and so easy. Great for a light summer desert. I used low-fat ice cream.

I used a combination of fresh rasperries and blckberries instead of peaches, so I could make ahead and not worry about fruit turning color. It was very easy and yummy.
