I gave this recipe 4 forks because I will make it again. I reduced the amount of port and sugar. I used 250ml port and 1/2 C sugar, and think that the amount could be even further reduced. I added the zest of one lemon before baking. I made this to serve with homemade vanilla ice cream. The honey-whiskey ice cream was not well reviewed by other cooks.

Hardly need a recipe for this! I broiled them instead of baking and served with whipped cream/mascarpone/lemon zest. Simple and cozy.

I used honey instead of brown sugar and this came out great. Would prob cook it a little less, because the caramelized reduction of the honey and the port became thin and baked against the glass plate I used. But will definitely make again. :)
