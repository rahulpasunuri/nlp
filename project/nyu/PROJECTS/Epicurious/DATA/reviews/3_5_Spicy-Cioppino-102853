My beau raved about this. Also, very adaptable (chili-garlic sauce and clam juice still produced a great dish, had to use dried marjoram--1/3 tbsp, and changed seafood ingredients to what I found at the wholesaler). Outside of prepping the seafood, the dish takes little time. I plan to make this again, and again, and again.

A wonderful recipe that, while not quick, is certainly easy. It took me about an hour start to table. I couldn't find harissa paste where I live so used a chili garlic paste instead. The name says "spicy", but the result is a mild spicy. So if you are worried about hot dishes, don't be afraid of this one. A few comments on things I learned from other reviews. Do the anchovies. Even if you think you, or your loved one don't like them, do them anyway. My wife hates anchovies. She saw me put them in and raised an eyebrow. They do not impart an anchovy taste, but the end result is wonderful, and most importantly, she loved the dish. As to wine, I used a middle of the road Sauvignon Blanc added to the dish, and to drink along with. The wine was right for the dish, but a more full bodied wine would have been better to drink with it. I used the technique of adding the fish and shrimp then immediately turning off the heat. The pot sat for 5 or 10 minutes while I got the table, bread, etc. ready. The shrimp was perfect. So don't follow the directions and simmer after the fish and shrimp. Just turn it off and wait.

First off, I agree, the home-made fish stock makes this recipe. I made it once with clam juice and it was not nearly as good. Second, don't be close-minded and omit the anchovies - they bring a lot of depth to the dish, something that simple salt could not replace. Think about anchovies as fish sauce in Thai food - they replace salt (note how the recipe does not call for salt). As a native of the mediterranean, I use anchovies in a lot of dishes (osso buco, sauteed broccoli, etc.) and no one can tell I did so, but everyone comments on the depth - it's my secret ingredient. I also use fresh tomatoes - canned tomatoes have added citric acid that ruins the taste for me. I prefer a more buttery soft rather than acidic taste to the broth, so that the taste of seafood becomes the highlight of the dish not the tomatoes. I do not use squid often because it is easy to overcook it (the soup remains hot long after you have turned off the stove, and this may overcook the squid). I turn off the stove the moment I add shrimp, white fish, and squid, and leave the pot covered. The heat of the stock will cook the fish just enough. This is a trick I borrowed from my cajun mother-in-law, who makes excellent shrimp creole and other seafood dishes without ever overcooking a thing. Finally, the wine has to be dry - I used an oaky sweet chardonnay once and I could taste No. 2 pencil.... In sum, I may have made this dish a few dozen times and have always impressed guests. It is comparable to or better than many cioppino variations that I have tasted in the Bay Area (where I live).

This is an outstanding and very easy (although somewhat expensive) dish. The harissa/chili amounts make this relatively spicy. Much thanks to Shannan from Florida for the amusing and verbose crash-course in fish stock. I enjoy reviews from people who haven't bothered to make the dish, and use the word YUCK.

I addded some chick peas-a North African touch in keeping with the harissa sauce, and used the more traditional red wine. Skipped the anchovies because my wife does not abide them. Also, harissa sauce varies in strength substantially by brand, so be careful. I used about a teaspoon and it was quite warm. Caveat taster.

I have made this before but never used anchovies - they were a nice addition and gave a very rich flavor to the broth. I din't use quite as much though and also used red pepper flakes and a little chopped red bell pepper instead of harissa or chili sauce. Great hearty dish with nice flavor on cold nights.

A delicious San Francisco cioppino. The anchovies add lots of flavor and the right amount of salt.

Okay, FIRST of all... people who don't bother to make the recipe need to keep their uninformed opinions to themsleves! SECONDLY.. the anchovies were a delicious, spicy touch... And the whole crab added plenty of flavor to the stock (I ALWAYS use some clam juice, fresh or bottled, in the stock)... I liked this cioppino a LOT and it was a whole lot easier to make than the more "refined" one where you have to chop and saute and strain and food-mill... and oh yes, i added a touch of saffron... and all kinds of clams, lobster, etc., to the finished product. Not only did I make this recipe---i ATE it too.

We beg to differ with the previous reviews. We had this dish at the Rose Pistola and it was outstanding - our own attempts to reproduce the experience following this recipe have been quite successful. Lacking access to good fresh crab (even though we know its not real cioppino without crab) we tend to up the fish quanity using monkfish. Try serving this with Rose Pistola-style roasted brussel sprouts with lemon and pancetta.

OK I am cheating a bit here... I have not actually tried this recipe, but I have read it and I make cioppino pretty frequently and know what great looks like (and tastes like)! A few notes: NEVER use clam juice. YUCK! If you are going to bother with cioppino make a fish stock. Ask your fish market for freshly fileted, non-oily fish carcasses (including head). It should NOT smell fishy. Remove gills and all guts, blood, skin (except for head),and the vein that sometimes runs over the top of the spine. Cut into 3" pieces (about). Sweat chopped veggies (onion, carrot, celery and fennel branches) in the stock pot you intend to use for the stock. Add the fish skeleton pieces and cook over med. for about 5 minutes until you start to smell it. Add COLD water until it comes near the top of the contents (about 2-3" below). Add some white wine to bring the liquid up an inch. Simmer , don't boil. Occasionally skim off scum. Add boquet garni (bay leaf, parsley and tarragon)continue to simmer for about an hour. Don't stir it up. Strain it through a fine strainer so no bits or bones go through. Then start the Cioppino. The stock is the base. THE key to good cioppino. What you put in is up to you. It should be absolutely fresh whatever it is. I use lobster. Crab pieces might get lost in the crowd of chunkier pieces of seafood The expense of it might me lost because it might be mistaken for renegade fish pieces that sink to the bottom of your serving bowl! Serve your cioppino with crusty french bread to sop up every drop of that wonderful broth!

This lady has probably never had a nice cioppino before, so I can see where this would intrigue her, but, a cioppino without lobster tails and clams and fennel bulb just ain't all there (in my book). Anyone who puts anchovies into a thing of beauty such as cioppino, needs to be fed on bread and water for a week, taken out back, field dressed and BBQd immediately.

I did vary the mussels, used prawns instead, did not use marjorium. We enjoyed it very much
