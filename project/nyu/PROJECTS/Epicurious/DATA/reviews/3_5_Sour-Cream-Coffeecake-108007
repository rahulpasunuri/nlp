Taste was fine, but had texture issues. I had a different pan, so made 1 layer of cake and put streusel in top ... It doesn't really stay on. Also, the cake crumb is too shaggy. If I were to remake it, I would decrease baking soda and increase baking powder (instead, 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder), and definitely put the streusel in a middle layer.

This recipe is easy and turns out delicious! I am not an experienced cook and it still turned out great. This will be my go to recipe for any coffee hour desert or office meeting. I made it with and without nuts and I think the non-nut version is much better. I added about 1/4 cup more brown sugar to the topping/filling mix instead of the nuts.

This is a great sour cream coffeecake. I spent an hour trying to find my old recipe and am so glad I didn't find it! After reading other reviews, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar for the filling/topping. The cake is moist and flavorful - this recipe has definitely replaced my old one.

Lovely. Like others, I also used brown sugar for the filling and put it in the middle of the cake. I recommend making extra filling so there is still some for the top of the cake. The cake itself is light, moist and rich! Also, I didn't actually have any walnuts or pecans in the house, so I ground hazelnuts instead and mixed them in with the filling. The hazelnuts gave the cake a very sophisticated, subtle nutty flavor.

Great, moist cake. I use brown sugar for the middle and put all the filling in the center. Also grate some orange peel into the cake mixture. It just adds some additional subtle flavor and depth.

I made this cake for my house mate, who is a sour cream addict. It was moist and delicious. I put all of the filling in the middle layer of the cake so it was more of a surprise, and I added a fistful of dried cranberries to the mix, as well. I agree with everyone else in that it does improve with age, making it an excellent breakfast cake...

When I first tasted this, I thought it was OK, but that I wouldn't make it again. Then I tasted it for the next couple days, and boy, did it get better. Everyone else thought so too. So, I really think this is one of those recipes that needs time to develop flavor. I also would add more of the cinnamon, sugar and nut mixture to the center. A lot of the mixture stuck to my bundt pan, so I'd definitely reserve most of it for the center.

Yum, yum! I was a bit short of sour cream so I used Greek-style plain yogurt, which worked fine. And, like others, I used pecans instead of walnuts. The cooking time is a tad long.

I made this cake in a springform pan and it turned out very well. I put a layer of chocolate chips in the middle (along with some reviewers'suggestions to use brown sugar instead of white) and mixed into the batter at the very end about a cup of frozen blueberries (defrosted at room temperature). It turned out extremely moist and had a wonderfully subtle taste. I put some (very little) powdered sugar on top just for decoration and it looked beautiful. My cake took the full time to cook. The only reservation I have is the brown sugar as a replacement for the white. It was a bit too granular and added another texture I didn't want with this smooth moist cake.

This is the sour cream coffeecake I have been looking for ever since I had a similar one years ago. I look forward to trying reviewers' suggested variations.

This was just OK. There was a bit of a strange aftertaste and the cake was rather on the dry side -- not considerably, but enough to ensure that I'll look elsewhere for a moister and tastier coffeecake.

A wonderful, simple coffeecake. I didn't have a bundt pan, so I made do with a rectangular casserole dish. With the large dish, I could only do one layer of batter, then sprinkled the topping on top. I was a little worried about how it would turn out, but was very pleased with the result.

I loved this coffee cake, and made it fairly close to the recipe - I always improvise on spices and the like, so it's hard to say if I followed it exactly. I loved the light batter but at the last moment I added a bag + of Trader Joe's Dried Montgomerey Tart Cherries. WOW. It is a sweet batter and the cherries added another dimension to it. Yum! Husband's co-workers sucked it down in 30 minutes.

Great recipe! I added 1-2 t. cinnamon to the batter as well as baking it in a 9 x 13 pan (1/2 batter, 1/2 topping, repeat. Baked for 30-35 mins.

This was really good. The best part for me is that it wasn't too sweet. I substituted non-fat plain yogurt for the sour cream, didn't bother with toasting the walnuts...definitely let everything come to room temperature (yogurt, eggs, butter)...chopped and mixed the nuts by hand... didn't sprinkle the nuts on the bottom of the pan directly because i was afraid that it would stick to the pan...so i made an additional layer of nuts in the middle of the cake instead. Was planning to use brown sugar for the cake but figured that it would made the cake yellowish and less pretty. Overall it is a definite keeper. My boyfriend who doesn't like coffee cakes in general said it was delicious. I will be making this cake over and over again.

I will definately be making this again. But it made me wish that I had a stand up mixer ;-) I lowered the amount of nuts and added about 1/2 cup of chocoloate chips to the nut mixture (as suggested by other reviewers). I also ended up making it with non-fat sour cream because it's what I had at hand, and it worked well. I also agree that it was even better the next day.

I just made this coffeecake last night and it went over great. I made it in a 9-inch spring form pan and put the nuts on the top and bottom. It's wonderfully moist and light, without being too sweet. It's great with coffee or tea, and I recommend that everyone makes the recipe. It's also the easiest coffeecake I've ever made.

I made this to bring to my friend's house at Easter. It was great -- not too sweet with a wonderful texture. I then made some to bring to work and it dissapeared quickly and got plenty of complements. I added a little lemon zest to the batter to zip it up a little: fabulous! Definetely will make again.

"In England, coffee cake would be called that because it was coffee-flavoured." Cook from Essex, CT on 4/21: It's called coffee cake because it's served with coffee. In exactly the same way the English have "tea cakes" that aren't tea-flavored. Similarly, I find that English "Yorkshire Pudding" and "Spotted Dick" contains neither pudding (custard or dessert) nor dick, respectively.

Don't know if it is because I use kosher salt, and it tends to have more flavor in general, but our whole family found this to be too salty. Not hugely salty, but just enough to be unpleasant, it sat in the kitchen for three days, being nibbled on, before I threw it away. No one hated it, but I certainly didn't get any requests for it either. Not worth my cup of coffee. Won't make again.

No, I don't think the cook from London was joking. I'm a Brit too, and I had exactly the same problem with 'coffee-cake' when I first came to live in the US. I couldn't understand why it was called this when there was no coffee flavouring in it. In England, coffee cake would be called that because it was coffee-flavoured. Just another instance of the same word meaning different things. That being said, this was a perfectly OK cake, reliable but nothing out of the ordinary. I might make it again because it was easy and good, but I think there are better recipes out there.

Has anyone considered that London's comment may have been a joke? Who's to say he/she is even posting from London. That does not excuse the childish, jingoistic and rude comment made on 4/18, however. And we wonder why the rest of the world thinks of us Americans as boorish, selfish and arrogant?!

Rating: 0
I would like to add my apologies to the London cook. It's really sad that there are still people in this day and age that cannot comprehend the cultural differences (and embrace them!), but rather, must put down anyone who is different than you, and therefore makes you feel uncomfortable due to your lack of open-mindedness. A note toTracy; you should be able to omit the nuts completely, as they seem to be a sort of streusel, rather than an integral component of the cake batter. I routinely leave out nuts in my grandmother's coffee cake streusel, because the kids won't eat it otherwise (maybe that's not a bad thing....) You might want to increase the other ingredients proportionately to compensate. Hope this helps.

Tracey- try substituting different combinations of the following to equal 1 cup total: shredded coconut, drained crushed pineapple, raisins, dried cranberries or dried cherries. If the pineapple if really well drained, it shouldn't affect the composition of the cake.

My former Mother-in-Law gave me this recipe 30 yrs ago. It's a wondeful cake, but watch it carefully as to not to overbake it. It dries out quickly. This easy Coffee Cake travels wonderfully & is great to take a a Hostess gift, for a Brunch, Baby/marriage showers,Pot-Luck suppers, and it's even gone to the family's house for a funeral or 2. Always remember to bring the recipe with you, someone will always ask for it! I like the idea of drizzling the top with a Glaze, as it does seems to need a "little" something to dress it up a bit to make it look as delicious as it really is.

Just cooled the cake and had my first bite. It was delicious and will be added to my file. I increased the amount of nuts (and melted butter as well) I also added cinnamon to the dry ingredients. Since we are nut lovers, the net time I do it, I'll use two cups of nuts. For company, I'll drizzle it with confectionery sugar icing

I agree with another reviewer; I would substitute brown sugar for white sugar in the nut mixture.
