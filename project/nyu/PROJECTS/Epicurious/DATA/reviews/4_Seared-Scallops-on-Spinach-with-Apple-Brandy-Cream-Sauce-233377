Wonderful, and light despite using heavy whipping cream. I served it with lightly roasted asparagus and it was a total hit with company. I will definitely do this one again. If you are having a more involved dinner party, then using this as an appetizer or an early course is a great idea.

I did not like this dish at all! The sauce was way to sweet for the delicate scallops. And watch out when adding the liquor--it most definitely will ignite.

Excellent scallop dish. I used apple cider and Apple Jack, and I quadrupled the spinach without adding more cream. With the larger volume of spinach this can be a one-dish entree. I already have plans to make it again.

Served with a simple salad and quality ice cream for dessert, this makes an excellent easily prepared supper for two. Using DRY SCALLOPS is essential.

This simple but elegant dish was the starter of our 7 course Wine Dinner. I prepared 2 Scallops per plate and it was a hit! The Calvados was not readily available and thought about changing to Apple Jacks (American version) but changed my mind when I realized it's not a product I will use often. Substituted a French Cognac with equal part Cognac & Apple Cider. It was perfect! Would make again as an appetizer or entree!

Made this last night for dinner for myself - used 4 large scallops, and also used 1/3 cup unpasteurized apple cider instead of bland apple juice. **Instead of flouring the scallops to help browning, I suggest that the scallops are laid on several layers of paper towels to dry. Dry scallops will brown; wet ones won't. Also lay several layers of towels on top, and make sure you blot dry. Let them sit for about 15 minutes on each side on the toweling. There shouldn't be any liquid visible on the outside of the scallop. Then make sure the pan is hot before placing the scallops in the oil. They'll brown very nicely *without* using flour - that is really unnecessary.*** I also cut back on the amt. of heavy cream as others have suggested - about 1/3 cup? - and reduced the sauce base for a much longer time than recommended in the recipe; probably for about 15 minutes or so. Using apple cider and reducing helped intensify the apple flavor.

Made this as a first course last Christmas for one of my dinner parties. Truly amazing dish; but, keep it small. Very rich.

I could not get unfiltered apple juice, but used regular apple juice instead. not much flavor overall. I will try concentrated apple juice next time and increase the garlic in the spinach.

This is wonderful. I do recommend cooking down the sauce much more then directed. Paired with a butternut squash risotto and more scallops per person this was an absolutely wonderful meal.

My husband and I made this dish for New Year's Eve, and it was exceptional. We used regular brandy with apple juice because Calvados was not available. We also dusted the scallops with flour to brown them just a bit. The sweet sauce and garlic spinach provide an incredible contrast in taste. We served it with a side of risotto, but both agreed that a butternut squash ravioli would be much better. Risotto is too heavy. This recipe made our top 10 list!

This is great with Maine Dry Scallops and the Calvados is a must. The unfiltered apple juice adds some nice flavor. I make this all the time with the spinach and steamed rice. Fry scallops in a metal saute pan for better browning and sauce. The non stick is not as good - my opinion.

The garlic in the spinach balances the sweetness of the sauce and provides a whole new dimension of flavor. Served it over some butternut squash ravioli.

This is a fabulous recipe just as it is writen. My only comments are that for an entree for two I used 8 scallops (four each) and kept all other proportions the same, even to weighing out 9 oz of spinach from a large Costco bag. That provided a generous amount of spinach for each of us. The sauce really needs to be boiled down to thicken--which I failed to do but will in the future. I served this with butternut squash risotto-a great combo.

This recipe is GREAT! We made it as a main dish for our gourmet group and it was excellent. I think you need to increase the quantity of scallops though. Two per person was not enough for a main course. I will absolutely make this recipe again.

I did not have the apple juice or calvados. I substituted apricot brandy and cooked figs. The result was wonderful!

Excellent! Cooked garlic with scallops and not the spinach. Served over rice to absorb the extra sauce.

I don't know what went wrong but this was not good. The sauce had no flavor. Scraped it off and ate the scallops and spinach.

My husband makes this every so often and it is wonderful!!! He uses organic Pear necter as thatis what he had in the fridge the first time he made it. This is a lovely dish :) YUM!

Couldn't find Calvados so used Applejack brandy. This recipe is DIVINE! The sauce and spinach bring out the natural sweetness of the scallops. Can't wait to make this again!

Excellent flavors & easy. I lightly floured the scallops for better browning.

The spinach and sauce were delicious, I agree, but I don't think the scallops mingled with the other flavors in order to be showcased well. (Another rater said you could also use the sauce on chicken, so it's not special enough for scallops!) We far prefer two other recipes from this site. Consider comparing this recipe to: Scallop Salad with New Potatoes in Creamy Vinaigrette, and Scallops with Mushrooms in White-Wine Sauce (this one is to die for!)

THis was really simple and great. I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and it still was wonderful. I will make this again for sure.

Delicious, fresh scallops make a difference, would prefer the sauce a little thicker, might add a little corn starch next time.

After trying this dish at a Christmas dinner, I had to make it myself. Short of ingredients, I used Bourbon instead of Brandy and a dash of Sauvingon Blanc instead of apple juice. Both versions turned out great, with the substitutions working better if you shy away from a sweeter main course.

Loved the easy elegance of the dish and the wonderful flavors of the sauce. Good Calvados is the key. I added more than it called for and served Calvados in brandy snifters as well. Everyone loved it. The sauce also works fabulously on pecan encrusted chicken filets or whitefish.

I made this as a main course but found that the apple flavour was lost in all the cream. Much as I LOVE cream, I will reduce the amount of it next time I make it and hopefully, more of the apple flavour will come through.

Rating: 4
Excellent. The subtle flavors blend well. The next time I make it I'll use a little less cream, it didn't allow the apple flavors to come through as much as I was hoping for. Also, it needs a fair amount of salt. I loved the fact that this was very simple but very elegant.

Very good dish, though a little too saucy for me. Next time I'll cut down on the amount of cream.

I thought this dish was very good. The apple taste was sweet and interesting but didn't have a real kick to it (good for guests who might like different but not crazy tastes). We made this for a crowd of 12, which was not hard to do. The only thing that I didn't anticipate is that in our area of the country (Colorado) the scallops were about $20 per pound (for the large ones). That was about 10 scallops per pound. We did buy very good ones from Whole Foods, but scallops are such a specialty item, it might be hard to find fresh ones elsewhere. I would have liked to have served about 3 scallops on each plate, but that was cost prohibitive. Our soloution: We served one big scallop on each plate and then several large shrimp that we had cooked in the sauce for a few minutes. The funny thing was, everyone liked the shrimp just as much, if not more. I agreed that the sauce and spinach mix blended just as well with the shrimp as the scallops. One more thing, when we fried the scallops, we did it in coconut oil. That was a yummy choice. Overall, a good, but pricey dish.

We loved the apple-brandy sauce. Our guests were quite impressed with the dish, and my husband didn't even sear the scallops correctly. I would definitely serve this to company again.

This is excellent! I make this as a main course - and serve over linguini YUM. Also I have substitutes regular brandy and had no problems. just make sure the pan is HOT so you reduce it well

Made this the first course at a dinner party -- everyone loved it. Used Apple Jack Brandy (liquor store suggestion $15 vs. $30) in place of Calvados. My mother made the same recipe couldn't find Calvados or Apple Jack Brandy used regular Brandy (BIG mistake). Would make again in a "heartbeat".

I made it as a first course for New Year's Eve. It received rave reviews. I'm making it again tonight. I couldn't find unfiltered apple juice so I substituted apple cider. It was still great. I give this two thumbs, way up!

I made this dish as is for a first course and it was outta this world. Make sure you sear your scallops so that they get caramelized. The sauce is delicious, slightly sweet, but not overpowering. Not too heavy, either. Everyone loved it. My sister doesnt like the texture of scallops, but she loved these. It's all in the searing of the scallops. I'm telling you!

Fabulous! I made this as a main course for me and my husband. I didn't find "fresh unfiltered apple juice" at my local grocery store, but I did find fresh pressed juice by Motts in the bottled juice aisle which worked out great.

thought it was absolutely wonderful. i served as an appetizer to a main course. i also made once with marsala and once with calvados. odd as it seems, the marsala had a touch more flavor. guests loved it!

Excellent and so easy. I made this as a main course from my husband and I. I didn't change a thing and served it with crusty bread. I used a 6 ounce bag of spinach and more would have even been better.

We loved this dish - it is rare that we cook anything exactly as published - but this time we did - however, instead of an appetizer, we served it as a main course for 2 - sauce and scallops were left over, but we used all of the spinach - served with smashed red potatoes on the side, made with a little Skim milk and butter & S&P
