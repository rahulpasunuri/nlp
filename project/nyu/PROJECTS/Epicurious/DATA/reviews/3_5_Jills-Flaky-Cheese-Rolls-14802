In the spirit of the (Super Bowl) season, I had to write that my college-age son always requests these specifically for the big game! I use Allouette w/ garlic and herbs. I'm lucky if I can get one of these out of a batch.

This was very good. It wasn't the fanciest recipe in the world but we were looking for Super Bowl finger food and everyone loved it. I'd make it again for a casual get-together.

Okay folks, it doesn't get any easier than these tasty little rolls. So easy and a nice little "surprise" when they bite in and get the cheesy center. I used Kraft spreadable Garden Vegetable cream cheese. Enjoy! KIMBER

We thought these were kind of 'iffy', but I think I used too much cheese--the rolls were soggy! So, I would advise restraint...a little goes a long way.

I didn't have croissants, so made them with refrigerator biscuits (rolled out like discs, then rolled up again) - and they were delicious.

Made this for a party for my son's class party. All of the two-year-olds loved them - and they were the least sweet thing on the table.

Very flaky and moist.
