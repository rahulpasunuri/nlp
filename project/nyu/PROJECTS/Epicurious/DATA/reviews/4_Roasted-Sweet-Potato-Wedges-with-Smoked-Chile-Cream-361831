Yes, this is simple. It's also one of the most delicious things I've ever made from this website. I have literally made it 5 times in the past 5 weeks (for different dinner guests, family, etc..) I double the sauce, but otherwise make it as is. Yum.

I appear to be in the minority here, but I didn't love this. I really like sweet potatoes and like the cooking method, but didn't think the sauce elevated them. For now, I'll stick with just plain old baked sweet potato wedges.

Loved the cumin with the potatoes! The cream was nice as well. Felt like something was lacking flavor wise. Would make again but might roast with a little more spice.

This recipe was easy and delicious! I didn't care for the sauce by itself, but found it to be a perfect compliment to the sweet potato. The only modification I made was to cook the potatoes longer...almost 40 minutes total, flipping them part way.

Just made the potatoes, no sauce. The cumin, salt and pepper nicely complimented the flavour of the potatoes and the prep couldn't be easier. Will definitely make this again, hopefully with the sauce next time.

I made this with the Easter ham. The potatos and sauce was a huge hit nad everyone asked for a copy of the recipe. I had to make it again this evening. Yum.

Cannot wait to make this again. didn't have chipotle hot sauce, so we used the liquid from a can of chipotles in adobo sauce and it was great.

Very simple. Loved the smoked chile cream (and so did my son). I made sweet potato wedges and regular potato wedges and the sauce worked well with both. Definitely making this again.

Delicious and fast! Definately my new favorite way to eat sweet potatoes!

Sauce is so simple. I agree that it would be great on other vegetables (and ham too)

I made these last night and they were a big hit. The sauce is delicious and I agree with the previous reviewer: it would be great with other veggies; roast beets, potatoes...I cooked the potatoes longer than 20 mins though because I like them to get crisp and caramelize a little bit. They re-crisped up nicely for my girls when they came home later for dinner. These are good enough for company. Yum!

The dipping sauce is a keeper! Would be great for cut veggies of all sorts. Delicious recipe.
