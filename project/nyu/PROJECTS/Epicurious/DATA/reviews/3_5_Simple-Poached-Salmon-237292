This is an EXCELLENT recipe! However, I do not use a crock pot. I simply put everything in a sauté pan and poach for 4 minutes (varying on thickness of salmon). You do NOT want to over cook your salmon. I also use a twist of fresh ground peppercorns. I serve this over a Broccoli Cheese Rice or Wild Rice w/Vegetables and Fresh Steamed Broccoli. YUM!

95 degree day, downstairs air is out. Coho salmon is running. What a perfect summer recipe. I also doubled the liquids in the recipe and added asparagus to steam halfway through.

I ended up using a different set o ingredients but I like the crock pot method. It was my first experience with making poached salmon and on one had I had a very complicated recipe with a lot of ingredients and on the other hand I had a very simple recipe with a few. So, I compromised and used this cooking method and the other ingredients. Have made it twice now and the family and friends were quite pleased.

I gave this 4 forks even though I didn't get any because my brotherinlaw ate it all. I made this for him for Thanksgiving because I told him we were having Prime Rib and he said he was sick of meat. It was easy to throw this into theCrockPot and forget about it and because he ate it all, thats good enough for me because he's picky

Really disappointing - bland. I had some salmon at Jean Georges in NY and was hoping that this would be infused with flavor like that. This was no better than cooking in the microwave. On the upside - it was easy, but I won't make it again. Does anyone have a method of cooking salmon that would infuse it with flavor?

Great concept, needs some tweaks. The biggie, this is nowhere near enough liquid for a typical sized crock pot. I doubled it and it worked pretty well.

Everyone enjoyed this salmon recipe. Using a good fish like a wild coho is the best. You can really taste the beautiful flavor of a good fish with a simple recipe like this.

Why not try it? I made it exactly as directed, and it was very very good. I heated the poaching liquid for the max time listed, and poached for the max time also. Delicious!

Poaching fish in a crock-pot doesn't make any sense to me. You're just increasing the cook time from 10 min to 40 or 50. Why do it at all?

I followed the directions and the salmon was still very pink after 20 minutes. I waited 10 more minutes and it was still very undone. I was in somewhat of a hurry due to an appt. I had to make so I ended up broiling it for another 7 minutes or so. I wouldn't try salmon in a slow cooker ever again! (It was good after I broiled it!)

I never thought of using my slow cooker for poaching fish. This was fast, easy and very delicious. I slurged on some really good wild-caught Alaskan salmon and it was well worth it! We had it with horseradish sauce, mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Yum.
