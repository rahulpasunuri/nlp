Delicious. Tender shortbread cookie. Holds shape well and is a nice change from usual. Emily, Michigan cook

I am partial to cornmeal and I thought these cookies were good. I rolled them out thinner to 1/2" and baked them as stated.

We really liked these. I used very coarsely ground polenta meal and served them w/ vanilla gelato. Next time I'd use more lemon zest, maybe 2+ tsp. and serve them as the "shortcake" w/ some berries & pastry cream. These didn't spread too much so I also put more on each sheet than called for. Will absolutely make them again.

SO EASY. Made per recipe except made squares. They were a big hit with all ages -- had trouble having enough to take to the potluck I made them for! Got lots of recipe requests.

This was a very easy recipe to make. I ended up using about a tablespoon more water to get the right consistency of dough, but made no additions other than that. It's a very subtly-flavored cookie, and happily not too sweet. It is a bit coarser than fine shortbread might be - though I'm sure there's finer cornmeal available if a different texture is preferred. The cookies don't change in size and shape in the oven, and so I'd fit more onto a sheet next time.

These were as hoped--crunchy little shortbreads, slightly different than the usual. The cornmeal kept the bottoms from burning, even on my dark cookie sheet. The dough is very manageable, and I used a star cookie cutter for some, b/c my diamonds kept turning out more like squares or triangles. But these cookies taste good enough to overcome irregular looks!
