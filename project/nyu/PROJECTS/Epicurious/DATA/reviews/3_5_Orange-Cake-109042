I used this to make cupcakes over the weekend, with the orange cream cheese frosting also found on epicurious. It made 18 cupcakes for me and the results were delicious! I will definitely be making these again.

Such a moist and flavorful cake! I added two extra teaspoons of orange zest.I didn't have sour cream so I used plain yogurt instead. Turned out perfect!

Just made this into little cupcakes tonight with the orange cream cheese frosting also found on epicurious. My husband and mother-in-law loved them, as did I. I thought the cake should be perhaps a bit more moist, but the other than that, the flavor was terrific, and not overbearing at all. Will definitely make again.

This was a good recipe with a nice little kick to it. The cake was good by itself but was even better with the orange cream cheese frosting recipe (also on Epicurious.com).

Because my husband likes raisins I add them to the receipe and ice the cake with carmel icing. Sweet but delious

Really lovely cake, and so simple to make. I topped it with lightly sweetend whipped cream sprinkled with orange zest. This is definitely a keeper!

excellent cake! great texture, not too sweet, very fresh and delicious. i made it as cupcakes with a simple chocolate ganache for frosting (just semi sweet and heavy cream melted together). i added a little vanilla extract and extra orange zest to the cake (and baked for about 18-19 mins for cupcakes).

I made this for our anniversary as our wedding cake was an orange cake. It was spectacular!! I highly recommend it. It doesn't even need the confectionery sugar dusting, it is pretty just plain!

This is a 4-star cake, given how easy it is. It's the perfect cake for people who don't like super-sweet desserts (i.e., Europeans). I make it in a bundt pan (25 mins) and serve with fresh whipped cream and berries.

This cake is easy and delicious! It was a nice finish to a casual dinner with friends. The texture was light and tender. The orange comes through more as an aroma than a taste on your tongue -- subtle, yet definitely there. I topped it with drained vanilla yogurt (aka "yogurt cheese") folded into sweetened whipped cream. The result was similar to creme fraiche, and it went beautifully with the cake. I'll definitely make this again.

Made this recipe, cut it up hot, disappeared in mere minutes! Really delicious and moist, will make it again and again.

All in all, a good cake. I baked it a bit too long and ended up with some air pockets. I topped it with a mocha butter cream frosting, so it needed a bit more orange flavor to match the strong frosting.

We made these as cupcakes, used orange flavoring, stuffed them with an orange whipped cream,and made an orange-chocolate frosting. The class devoured them! I, Graham Cohen will make these again!

I used this recipe for cupcakes, and frosted them with a dark chocolate buttercream. They were a huge hit, and my husband especially loved the delicate orange flavor to the cake.

This cake is so easy to make and is always a big hit at casual parties. I think it's better as a tea cake than a full-blown dessert. Follow the recipe exactly (maybe use just a bit less sugar than called for) and you can't go wrong - the sour cream gives a wonderful, moist texture. Next time I might try using lemon juice and peel instead of orange.

This is a surprisingly delicious cake; it is buttery and tender. I also added a little orange glaze (1/8 cup orange juice and 1/2 cup sugar dissolved over low heat). This would make a great breakfast or picnic treat.

I started off making a big basic mistake with this cake. Instead of beating the butter with the sugar, I added the sugar (half sugar, half Splenda) at the beginning to the other dry ingredients. So I was left to beat the sugar and zest, then added the eggs and so forth. I used my electric hand mixer (instead of a whisk) on low speed through the entire procedure, adding at the end the sifted dry ingredients in four parts. To make a long story short, this was one of the best cakes ever! I'll make it again, and I'm almost afraid to vary from my errors. Just goes to show....By the way, for those who found the cake on the dry side (mine was very moist), check it at 30 minutes. Mine was perfectly done at that stage.

I thought the cake was very good. I used light sour cream and 1/2 the orange zest.

A nice, homey, old-fashioned cake. My batter was quite thick, almost like for drop biscuits, which might account for the "homey" texture. I tasted it and it was fine -- but I went ahead and added an orange syrup anyway. (I think you can't really go wrong with a syrup on these cakes.) Is yummy. I'll make again, and will also try the interesting chocolate variation below.

I followed the suggestion of a reviewer and added an ounce of unsweetened chocolate to the batter; I also brushed on the orange juice syrup after baking. It was delicious served with chocolate ice cream. Very nice flavor and moist crumb.

I had some oranges that were about to go bad and decided to try this recipe. I love chocolate so I added one melted square of Bakers chocolate to the mix. I also feared it would not be moist enough so I poured on top a homemade syrup with 1 orange (juice) 1 tbsp sugar and 2 tbsp cacao liquor, boiled for 3 minutes. The end result: something out of this world, very moist and yummy tasting.

I made this cake for a special Valentine's afternoon tea with my friends. Everyone loved the cake. It was not dry or bland, just very good. I wanted to make it again, and so went in search of the recipe, which I failed to keep. Thank you for finding it for me. Kate

I have made this cake probably 20 times, but I just came up with an excellent variation. Instead of the orange, use the peel and juice of a whole lemon. After adding the sour cream and juice, add in a small handful (not too many) of quality chocolate chips. You want a hint of chocolate, not crunch. Also, cook it in an 8 inch round pan with a removable bottom. It should cook in 35 minutes.

My husband ordered "gateau a l'orange" for his birthday cake, and this was the closest I could find. I would agree with the previous commenters that the beauty in this cake is it's simplicity. Since a couple commenters alluded that it might be dry, I peeled some orange sections and let them soak in just a bit of sugar for the afternoon. I presented the cake on a glass pedastal with lots of pastel candles (no one counted how many) and then served each piece with a dollop of the sugared oranges. Someone brought apricot brandy served in miniature chocolate "glasses", and we discovered that this was the perfect complement.

The texture and the look of the cake were really great but the cake was a bit bland (maybe I didn't put enought orange zest?).

I glazed it with a syrup made from the juice of 2 oranges. We loved it.

This delicous cake is perfect for afternoon tea. It's very moist, the texture is similar to pound cake, and very aromatic. Icing it would ruin the simplicity of the flavor.

Unless your taste buds are European, this cake will be plain, yes. But do yourself a favor, cut sugar in half to bring out the orange flavor (vs sweetness). Serve it with warm custard made with orange liqueur (1 cup whole milk, 1 cup skim, 2 T sugar scalded, 2 eggs added, cooked til thick enough to cover metal spoon, splash Gran Marnier). This makes it very special, very unusual. And to boot, made from ingredients you're likely to have on hand -- no extra trip to the grocery!! PS Tangerine was a fine substitute for orange.

After just moving to the "Sunshine State" and having access to all the fresh citrus, I made this cake. While it was tasty, it needed something to make it special. Hubby wanted cream cheese frosting, but I served it with sliced fresh peaches. Next time I will try poking holes in it and dizzeling/soaking it with a little Cointreau and fresh squeezed o.j.

After salivating through the assembly, we were disappointed at the final result. The kids each took one bite and pushed it away, and my husband said, "it needs vanilla frosting." It would be better suited for a tea cake than a full-blown dessert. I much prefer the orange yogurt cake from Gourmet at least 5 years ago, which unfortunately isn't showing up on the search! Also simple, but more flavorful and moist.

I thought this was an excellent recipe with a wonderful flavor and texture. It did take the full 40 minutes to cook but it was worth it. The next time I make it I may try a drizzle of bittersweet chocolate on top, I believe the two flavors would work well together.

I baked it for 34 minutes. It had a nice bright orange flavor and was moist and very good for family desserts. I doubt that I would make this one company though, because it had a coarser crumb...like a coffee cake. Otherwise, very nice.

I didn't have any trouble making this recipe. I used 1 1/2t dried orange peel instead of fresh and store bought juice so the orange flavor may not have been as strong. It had a nice buttery flavor and a soft rich texture. Very easy.

I'm not sure why the previous reviewer ended up with something resembling a creme brulee-like filling, but I followed the directions exactly and came out with a moist, sweet and delicious orange-flavored yellow cake that everyone -- kids and adults alike -- raved about. This easy-to-make cake keeps well and is a wonderful dessert for casual get-togethers or weeknight family dinners.

It was much too sweet and more like creme brulee than cake. I might use it as filling between layers of plain white or yellow cake.
