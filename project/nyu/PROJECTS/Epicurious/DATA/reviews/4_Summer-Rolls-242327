The first time I made these I followed the recipe as described, but the second time I left out the turkey and the eggs and actually liked it much more that way - as a light snack. Quick and easy to make.

I used leftover pork tenderloin cut into small strips reheated with 1-2 tbsps soy sauce, 1-2 tsps sesame oil, 1-2 tsps fish sauce and green onions. Fresh Basil leaves take these salad rolls to another level. I just used julienned carrot, red pepper, cucumber, iceberg lettuce, the noodles,basil, meat. Excellent summer lunch!

I have made these before, and I think turkey is a great alternative, especially if you have to watch your fat intake. I have made these rolls with lettuce and tuna or egg salad. They are delicious.

Turkey in a summer roll is just all wrong. Try shrimp, shredded pork or fried tofu (or a combination of any of the three) instead for a much more satisfactory result. Red peppers and mushrooms are out of place here also. Julienned carrots, mung beans and a little green leaf lettuce are all the vegetables you need. Liven up the flavor by including any combination of mint, thai basil and cilantro.

I was looking for something quick, different and healthy and this was it! Once I got the hang of the rice paper rolling, I had no problem making beautiful little summer rolls. Dipped in a little tamari sauce, my boyfriend and I both really enjoyed them.
