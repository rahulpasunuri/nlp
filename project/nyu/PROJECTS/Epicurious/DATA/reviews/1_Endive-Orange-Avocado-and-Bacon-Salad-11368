The dressing was great, and with the avocado only, the salad is good. But, the endive adds and unpleasant bitterness that is accentuated by the oranges. Must be made fresh. Cannot sit for anytime at all without becoming "soggy". This recipe tasted good in theory, but reality was a big disappointment.
