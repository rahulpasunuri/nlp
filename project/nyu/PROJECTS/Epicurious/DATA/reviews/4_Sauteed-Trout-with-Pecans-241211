My whole family loved this recipe. I used 2T of butter to saute the trout, and 2T to saute the pecans. I substituted cilantro for parsley since that's what I had. I served it with steamed Swiss chard, fresh corn on the cob and wheat rolls.

Excellent, but with a slight modification. Rather than Pecans I used 1 cup of Pistachios, crushed in a plastic bag, then added the flour for coating. Also used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter rather than all the butter the original recipe called for.

Made this for my wife for Valentine's Day. She did say there was too much butter for her taste. This is a good recipe just the same. Enjoyed it with rice and pan fried brussel sprouts with olive oil, salt and pepper.

Yummy. Maybe the best trout recipe I have had for store bought trout. Really fresh trout.. some salt, pepper, butter and a frying pan. But I haven't had that in years. I did cut the butter about 50% and it was still delicious. I like the lemon and parsley in with the pecans. The browning developed a nice sweetness to the pecans a compliment but not overpowering. I will keep my sugar with the pecans in my pie thanks.

Excellent and unique. A little too much butter. I also used salted butter and added a little brown sugar to the pecans.

Delicious! I also cut back on the butter. I cut back the butter to 1/3 stick, and then used about 1/4 cup olive oil for saute and the sauce. That was plenty! The other change I made was to mix the cayenne, salt and pepper into the flour and then coat the fish. Much easier than trying to coat fish with spices and then flour. Will make again...

My man and I LOVED this, I used less butter as sujested and added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar with the lemon. Served it with the apple, dried cherry, and walnut salad with maple dressing from this site and wild rice pilaf. YUM!

I quite liked this. I followed the recipe as written except for the 1/2 butter that eveyone else suggest. The recipe was very quick and tasted delicious. I'm going to try with a little less butter or perhaps olive oil next time. This is a keeper.

I chose this recipe for freshly caught trout;I reduced the butter, omitted the lemon, and added brown sugar. I paired with fresh sweet corn, and a green salad with artichoke hearts, avocado, cucumber, strawberries, cherries, banana chips, a few pecans, and a rasberry walnut dressing. FABULOUS! I loved the sweet in each dish; with the variety of textures and colors it was perfect!

Sprinkled some brown sugar with pecans. Sooooooooooooo good!!! served with green beans and cous cous. Didnt like it with lemon juice. Tried a few bites with lemon juice.

This was great, quick and easy. I recommend adding brown sugar to the lemon butter pecan sauce. And you can get away with about 1/2 the butter the recipe calls for.

I love this recipe...it was easy, quick and simple ingredients. My husband usually doesn't like trout but he LOVED this dish.I wished I had had a group to feed tonight.

Meh. We liked the pan-friend trout, but not with the sauce on it. I was doubtful about how I would like pecans and lemon juice together, but decided to try the recipe after reading all the great reviews. Well, I was right after all. We didn't enjoy the flavour of the two together...buttery, lemony and pecans...I actually scraped the sauce off most of my piece. Will try another trout recipe next time.

Made this last night and it was amazing. Love Rainbow Trout anyway and this gave it extra dimension and texture. Took the advice or other reviewers and used less butter for the Pecans. Served with Lemon Rice from this site and steamed snow peas. A keeper for sure.

I made this last night with rainbow trout. My husband and I thought it was fabulous! It seemed like way too much butter so I used what I thought it needed which was about half. This is now my favorite trout recipe and it looks amazing also! Great for entertaining and very easy.

I made this dish last night at the spur of the moment. I had trout fillets with skin and I was tired of the wine/lemon juice prep. I found this recipe and decided to make it because I had all the ingredients at hand. It was pretty good; the only thing I would do next time is decrease the butter by half. I would also increase the parsley a bit.

Used almonds instead of pecans, but very easy, very tasty. I don't like to work with my fish much, but this was delicious!

I actually made this version and another with mahi mahi and pine nuts. Both were good, but the trout w/ pecans was better. Got rave reviews from my husband, who is very particular about his fish.

This looks wodnerful, but I wonder how it would work with olive oil instead of butter. Any thoughts form those who have made it.

I used tilapia instead of trout and pine nuts instead of pecans because that is what I had on hand. My husband and I agree that this is a marvelous dish--a real keeper!

This was absolutely delicious but I cooked the fish in a non stick frying pan to reduce amount of butter in the recipe. Turned out really good. A keeper.

While simple and very easy, this was delicious and a real "keeper". The cayenne is the real secret...a nice mild kick with the pecans and lemon juice. This may become my favorite trout recipe.

Quick, tasty, easy weeknight main course. I used talapia instead of trout, and it was great.
