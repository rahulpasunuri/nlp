Made these as meatballs, as another reviewer suggested, and they were a hit at New Year's Eve. The recipe makes WAY too much relish, but it had a second life in a stir-fry sauce later in the week. A hit.

These were delicious! I made them into smaller meat balls rather than large patties. They would be great appetizers for a party. Unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan of the relish. I would probably skip it next time.

I made this exactly as written and it was amazing. Do NOT skip the relish: the sweet, tart, salty, and gamey flavors all play off each other to perfection.

I used red peppers and was very pleased with color contract they provided against the whites of the apple, which I did not peel. I simmered until very tender, then took a masher to half the batch, leaving the rest intact. I would definately make this again and perhaps try pears instead of apples. The relish compliments the patties very well. Recommended!

This is my husband's favorite lamb dish - with a few changes. I use goat cheese instead of the feta, and depending on what is in my garden, use a combination of mint, parsley and cilantro instead of just mint. We broil the patties on a grill - 4 min each side. For the sauce, I melt homemade hot pepper jelley with chopped mint. Yum, and easy!

This was great! Super quick and low effort, as promised (the relish boiled down while we made and cooked the patties). Don't skip the relish-- I'm not a big fan of relish in general, but this one was excellent and an excellent balance for the patties. If I'd change anything it'd be to put a bit more feta in next time.

This is fantastic. I had my dad over for Fathers Day and asked him what he would NOT eat. He said broccoli rabe and lamb. Well, I served him these without disclosing what type of meat they were and he had extra helpings.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. Paired with the Heirloom Tomato Salad (also from Epicurious), wild rice salad and garlic bread, it made for a lovely summer meal.

I didnt make the relish and had my boyfriend bbq them - really simple & delicious. I used a mint sauce which is just minced mint & vinegar instead of fresh as all of the grocer's in my area were mysteriously out of mint!!

Great stuff! I must say though the relish that I made was completely different from the recipe. I didn't have raisins or apples in my larder at the time so I substituted dried cranberries and a pear and it worked great! Try that as a variant!

I served these as small meatballs (fried in olive oil instead of done under the grill) at a cocktail party; everyone loved them.

Followed the recipes exactly & everyone liked it (some liked it a WHOLE lot). I tend to like my lamb plain & would personally have given this a "2 forks", but the rest of the family strongly voted me down. :D

The patties were very good, although we thought that the relish completely over-powered the lamb and it wasn't all that interesting. Will keep the recipe and make again; but will pass on the relish. We had this w/the Spaghetti Squash w/Moroccan spices in Gourmet, February 2002. Excellent!

my husband made this recipe with a few addes ingredients, however, the relish was outstanding if a little bit spicy and the lamb is best grilled! otherwise very tasty!
