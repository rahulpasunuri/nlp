Pretty bad recipe here. The timing and temperature were wrong. The proportions seemed off too...and overall the flavor wasn't even good....

This is definitely a keeper! However, 10 minutes was plenty of roasting time- nice and rare, but I live with an avid carnivore. If you are serving this to guests, particularily some who may be less meat inclined, I suggest perhaps a nice red wine sauce or some-such. For those of you who have never made lamb before and are considering this recipe, it is well worth it (don't worry about the type of breadcrumbs) the presentation is attractive, and although no one will remember what you served with it, garlic mashed potatoes are fab, and just about anything green. Good Luck!

Tried to satisfy differing tolerances for "doneness." Well done set off the smoke alarm. The finished appearance was unappealing.

This is a great dish! A little time consuming to prep - but worth it.

First time making Lamb Chops and this was easy and delicious. My husband asked me to make it again. Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. YUM YUM

We've had this dish at least three times already. I think this is a superior recipe, so simple to prepare and delicious. I doubled the recipe and used prepared, store-bought toasted breadcrumbs, which worked fine. Nice-n-easy!

Could not come to terms with this recipe,the "parsley mixture" formed into a ball! due to the moisture in the garlic, parsley and shallots and therefore would not readily form a "crust" that would adhere to the chops. THERE ARE MUCH BETTER RECIPES FOR LAMB CHOPS ON THIS WEB-SITE.

What a wonderful recipe! Just like many others who reviewed this recipe, this was the first time I had ever made lamb--and what a success it was! I used already made dijon mustard, added more garlic and ommitted the shallot!It was scrumptious! My partner and I ate the lamb with asparagus and broccoli and enjoyed every morsel! This recipe is quick and delicious--a definite keeper.

I'd never made lamb before and was quite pleased with the results and with how easy it was.

This is a great recipe for lamb. I have made it twice now and both times substituted loin chops, 2/person--delicious. I used dijon mustard instead of dry mustard because I didn't have it on hand, and ended up having to cook them about 5-7 minutes longer than the recipe instructed. The first time I made this dish was the first time I had ever cooked lamb, and I couldn't believe how simple it was and how perfectly the chops turned out.

This was so delicious...I don't have a rack to cook this in, so I cut down on the cooking time and broiled the dish at the end to crisp up the soggy breading. It helped a little but was tastly nonetheless.

This was great! I used panko instead of sourdough crumbs, added way more garlic and substituted chopped freah rosemary for the parsley. This one's a keeper.

I made this dish for a dinner party this past weekend and everyone loved it. I served it with scalloped potatoes and grilled asparagus. Everyone asked me for the recipe. I melted the butter in advance and added the spices.I also dried the breadcrumbs and prepared the other ingredients prior to the guests arriving. It took just a few minutes to bread the lamb prior to baking. Great recipe for entertaining.

Excellent! I didn't have any sourdough bread, used plan old white bread. Also used loin chops. A little greasy next time all probably use milk instead of butter. Other than that wonderful!

Outstanding!! Served it with Stuffed Baked Potatoes with Rosemary and Roquefort (also from Epicurious.com) and hours later guests are still commenting on what a great meal the combination made. The great part is that these gourmet restaurant-quality dishes are simple and easy to prepare.

Nice flavor. Take the advice of the first reviewer and heat the breadcrumbs for no more than 2 minutes.

VERY GOOD. MARINATED THE CHOPS FIRST. WOULD MAKE AGAIN.

Just wonderful! I could only find Lamb Loin chops instead of the rib chops and they worked out fine. I replaced the shallots with finely chopped red onion. Served with spinch soufle and pan fried diced potato/galic and parsley. My husband raved over the lamb and it's crust.

I didn't have shallots, so substituted leeks, also added more cayenne. Delicious

I made this dish last night and it is going into my "easy recipes that make guests think I slaved over a hot stove" category. The lamb was SO tender, I was just amazed. I actually added rosemary and rubbed sage to the butter mixture and coated the lamb chops in that before pressing on the breadcrumbs and since I was out of regular parsley, I used Italian flat leaf parsley. I poured the remaining butter over the chops before I put them in the oven. This dish was really, really good and will be a standard at our house from now on!

A superb receipe and so easy and quick to prepare. I substituted filet of lamb for the chops and cut it into 3/4 inch steaks. I served it with fresh 4 cheese and basil tortellini which were smothered in ratatouille.

Just like the lamb ribs I had at the HudSon grill in New York. Keep 'em plenty pink in the middle (of course) and don't use store-bought breadcrumbs. The lamb was sacrificed for a good cause.

This was a total success. I did add fresh thyme and rosemary to the crust, which are two of my favorite flavors with lamb.

This recipe has become one of our favorite way of preparing lamb chops. The chops come out juicy and delicious and go with anything that we prepare as side dishes. A good bottle of Sangiovese provides the final touch.

I used a T. of dijon mustard instead of the dry mustard and substituted French bread because sourdough wasn't available. The results were great! The chops make a beatiful presentation crossed over mashed potatoes with celery root, also from Epicurious.

This is a great recpie, but watch the oven when baking the crumbs. It took only two minutes to get them mdry, but three minutes to watch them burn.
