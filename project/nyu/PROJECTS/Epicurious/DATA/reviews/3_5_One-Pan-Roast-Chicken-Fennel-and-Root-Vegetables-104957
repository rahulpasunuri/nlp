Simple and absolutely delicious. One of my favorite Sunday evening meals. I made the veggies exactly as directed (though will add onion to the mix, next time) and they came out wonderfully caramelized. I changed the chicken slightly to do it as I always do, sprinkled with dried thyme and dill in addition to lemon pepper and freshly minced garlic instead of oregano, stuffed with halved or quartered lemons.

I've made a similar recipe to this for several years, having seen a version of this in my local paper. A few suggestions:

This was exactly what I was looking for...roasted chicken with root veggies. I didn't do fennel but was bang on the rest. A good go-to recipe.

OK but nothing special; a bit bland for my taste. At least with my (gas) oven, the vegetables were still a bit underdone when the chicken (which tasted good) was done; I didn't get any browning. I think if I made this again I'd put everything into the oven together.

If you want a really great roast chicken, do the "Roast Chicken and Root Vegetables with Mustard-Rosemary Sauce" on this site. This chicken is alright, but nothing spectacular.

Excellent! The fennel gave it a lovely taste! Easy to make. Fennel fronds make a nice garnish.

I added a few parsnips, one of my favorite veggies, peeled and cut as the carrots were. Very yummy.

This was definitely comfort food! Will make it again for sure.

Eh. Nothing special about this. It's a good recipe if you've, uh, never roasted a chicken, but as other reviewers have pointed out, you can substitute and add many things to this to make it more interesting.

I made no changes on the main recipes and it turned out fantastic. I added some chicken broth to the pan and used some indonesian soya and sour cream to make the gravy more festive and it was definitely a meal fit for royalty,

I do like this. It's easy to do. It's good. But I would call it more something for the family than a meal for company.

Delicious, versatile, and EASY! I used a cut-up chicken, and, as I didn't have any fennel on hand, substituted 1/2 onion (a prior reader's suggestion). It worked out beautifully. DEFINITELY a keeper!

Fantastic! I left out the garlic powder and oregano (was out) and seasoned very generously with kosher salt and pepper. Threw in some whole garlic cloves (with peel on) and used some baby red potatoes I had on hand along with the fennel and carrots. They all came out soft and caramelized. Added a splash of hard cider that I happened to have on hand and it added a nice, slightly acidic kick. I'd use it again. It was also my first time using a completely organic chicken and I couldn't have been more pleased. Even at twice the price of the reg. ones, it was WELL worth it in both taste and texture. It made the meal!

This receipe is very easy and so versatile. I;ve made this recipe twice, the first time I added half a cut up turnip to the veggies. The pan drippings make an excellent gravey. The second time I got a lttle braver and rubbed some extra spices including parsley, sage, roseemary and thyme along with some olive oil over the skin before placing the chicken in the oven. I also put about half a cup of dry white wine in the bottom of the pan as it roasted. Very tasty, indeed.

This was so easy and delicious!! I did make a pan gravy with the juices to make it more decadent.

This recipe was delicious! My store was out of fennel so I quartered an onion, which was just as good. I also used the pan juices to make a gravy to go along with it. My husband said this was a definite "make again" recipe.

This was so quick and so delicious. I think I added a little more carrots and potatoes than the recipe called for, but other than that, followed it exactly, and it was superb.

What a user friendly recipe!! You could use whatever you want/have. I used fennel (a must), red onions, potatoes, garlic cloves & Italian seasoning. It was soo good! Just as good at room temp as hot! I suspect the review before me was for something else. No broth in this. Or gravy. One thing to keep in mind: I made this for 2 people & used 1 large cookie sheet. If I were to do this for 4, I'd use 2 pans so that things roast better.

This was easy and quick when you are trying to feed four kids. I added a TBS of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of dry white wine to the broth, and doubled the amount of oregano and broth, which I think improved the flavors. The next day, I made a gravy with the remaining broth mixture and my 5, 4, and 1 and a half year olds ate it again!
