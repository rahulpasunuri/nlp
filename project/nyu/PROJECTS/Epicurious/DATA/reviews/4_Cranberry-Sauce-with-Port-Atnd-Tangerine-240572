I made this recipe as written and it was pretty tasty. That said, I prefer "Cranberry Sauce with Port and Dried Figs" on this site much more. I am tempted to try this recipe one more time and double the port, tangerine zest, and tangerine juice and reduce it further before adding the cranberries. This just wasn't different enough from a normal cranberry sauce  I could barely discern the port or the tangerine in the sauce.

made it without the tangerine strips.I don't prefer when citrus overpower the other flavors. It was a success. Should have doubled. went to the store today to make more for leftovers. Must try this.

Loved it! Great twist on my favorite Thanksgiving side. I used orange zest- about 2 T and 1/4 c each of port and petite syrah. Yummy!

Another one that made it into the family's lit of required dishes on Thanksgiving Day!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and, despite the typo in the title, will definitely be making it again this year. And possibly another batch for the fridge and my spoon. The tangerine flavor comes through well and really complements the cranberries, and the port gives it a subtle sweetness. It's also fantastic over ice cream.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about this recipe. I made (gulp) 10 pints of it this past Christmas for gifts...and reluctantly gave the recipe, too. This is perfectly spiced, a cinch to make, looks spectacular and gets rave reviews. Who needs anything more?!

excellent, easy alternative to store-bought cranberry sauce. holds up well in fridge overnight, so don't be afraid to do this as a do-ahead step.

I doubled this recipe to serve 14. The tangerine was way too pronounced and overpowered the whole thing. I'm eager to try next year with less tangerine juice (or none at all possibly)

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it so I have had requests to do it again this year. I don't usually like cranberry sauce but this ia a winner.

Rich flavors. So much better than store bought. Next time I will use less tangerine though.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was the best cranberry sauce we've ever had. I just saved it to my recipe box, so that I can make it again this year.

Everyone loved this! Not a teaspoon left over. : )

Delicious and simple! Can be made days ahead of time. Only change, used zest of 2 tangerines.

My whole family loved this. I used orange instead of tangerine, and grated 1 tsp of zest instead of using strips. It needed more like 15 minutes on my stove.

Unbelievably good! So easy to make (used an orange because I couldn't find tangerines). I have never been a fan of cranberry/orange relish, but will make this one for more than just holidays.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. It was terrific and super easy.

This is truly an exceptional recipe. Simple ingredients, fast prep. I've never seen the cranberry sauce serving piece emptied at the Thanksgiving table, but this did the trick! I had to make a second batch the next day to have with leftovers. It's perfection!

This was pretty good, a little wetter than I usually like cranberry sauce. It didn't wow me in any way and I'm not sure I'd make it again.

Good flavor blend. I like tart, not sweet, sauce. Port adds depth. I used oranges and added double the zest for more citrus taste. I have another recipe I like better [which I can't find at the moment, so looked for a new one], but this one is good.

Straight-forward and good, but nothing spectacular.

I, too, made this today. I used orange instead of tangerine. At first, I did not like the powerful taste of the port (even though I used VERY expensive port). I added 1/4 tsp of orange oil to the mix and it brightened considerably and is really, really good. I think the issue may be getting enough of the citrus...being certain that the zest has enough flavor. Looking forward to having this with our turkey.

I tried this recipe today based on all the raves and I really don't like it. It's way too tart for my taste and while the port did lend an interesting flavor I felt it was overwhelming in the quantity called for. Of my roommates, one loved it and one hated it. Tried adding a few ingredients to save it, but am glad I still have a few bags of cranberries left--I'll probably just start over. Maybe if you like your cranberry sauce to be quite tart you'll like this but if you like sweet then look elsewhere.

Wonderful result - a much more sophisticated dish than the typical cranberry sauce. Inspires me to try other combinations under the same ratios - like lime and ginger or orange and cinnamon.

Wow. I cooked this a bit more than called for and used 1/3 cup fresh orange juice (didn't have tangerines). SUPER. It forms a jelled sauce with great flavor. I will certainly make it again.

Mine is still warm, too! I want to eat it all now! Definitely takes the ol' cran sauce up a significant notch. And now what to do with the rest of that bottle of ruby port? ;)

I just finished this. As a matter of fact it's still warm on the stove. It is fantastic and definitely will be an addition to my holiday menus! I can't wait to try it after it's had a chance to cool.

I always make a cranberry with orange sauce for Thanksgiving and decided to try this sauce instead. I found it to be a lttle tart and would use less zest next time. Although the port added depth I would also use less as it was a little overwhelming.

It's all been said, but I'll repeat. The flavor combination is subtle and delicious. Perfect degree of sweetness. Note to earlier reviewer who left out the ruby port... I think that was a mistake as it's a defining ingredient.

Delicious! Rich and more interesting than traditional cranberry sauce, not a lot of work, keep the recipe as-is.

Really enjoyed the hint of port in the sauce. It just gives it an extra zing without being over the top. A new favorite for me.

My holiday tradition has been to make the easiest cranberry sauce ever. 1 bag cranberries, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water. Put in microwave safe bowl, cover with wax paper, microwave on high 3 minutes. Stir. recover then microwave another 4-5 minutes on high until skins pop. So decided to try this recipe using same technique. Substituted the water for 1/2 cup port, added the tangerine zest and juice, and increased the sugar to 1 cup. Put all the ingredients in the bowl and microwaved as per the above. It was wonderful and flavorful. A new holiday tradition with lots more flavor!

This recipe was easy and really zesty. I used kirsch instead of port, because that's what I had on hand, and it turned out wonderful.
