I agree. The best cake in the world. I have so many cans of condensed sweetened milk from Indian commodities that I decided to enrich the frosting with it. I whipped it up with butter and 3 egg whites so it was as light as whipped cream. Then I folded this mixture into the original frosting already made. It was delicious. And so much lighter and fluffier that a heavy cream cheese frosting. Try it!

Absolutely the ideal carrot cake - I'll never use another recipe.

This cake was perfect as is with no ingredient modifications. Made it in 2 round pans and cooked for maybe 40 minutes. I candied some orange peels for the top of the cake and that turned out better than I expected--it was a really pretty cake. Made this for my husband's birthday last night and all 12 people there said it was the best cake THAT THEY HAD EVER HAD. This from a range of ages from 81 to 10. These are people who love to eat, who cook, who bake, who love me,and have NO PROBLEM being totally honest, so I trust them. The frosting was really good--make the whole frosting recipe-- its a CAKE for goodness sake!!

If you love carrot cake, you will want to marry this version! I was afraid to mess with such a classic, but the hint of orange in the cake and the fresh zing in the icing make for a show-stopping dessert. It also worked well for me when I made a large sheet cake for a baby shower -- I garnished it with some orange zest and carrot shavings and it was beautiful!

Because this was Christmas dessert, I had lots of fun with this. Did the 1/3 butter, applesauce and oil, used jumbo raisins, adjusted the leavening and amount of flour for the altitude and then cut the cake into 4 layers after baking in 2 9" pans. After reading the reviews on the icing, I did the regular frosting recipe and then folded 1 1/2 c whipped cream. It made a ton of awesome frosting. Everybody loved it and will definitely make this again. I definitely could see problems with the icing being too runny even before I added the whipped cream. Also I used 1 t of gelatin to stabilize the whipped cream which helped as well. Thank you Epicurious reviewers for all your feedback. Happy 2010!

I made this cake today for a small party at the college I attend. It was a huge hit! It's a very moist cake and the flavours are wonderful. I made it in a 9" round cake tin, and I baked it for around 1hr 20mins at gas mark 3 (maybe it takes longer in a gas oven?) I supplemented the cream cheese frosting for more of a glaze, which was still really nice. I just couldn't justify five cups of icing sugar!

This is the most incredible carrot cake I have ever eaten. The orange flavor is brilliant. I agree that the frosting recipe makes an overwhelming amount, but who doesn't naughtily like to enjoy the leftovers?! Honestly, I don't like my cake or frosting as sweet as the recipe calls for, so I cut the sugar nearly in half but the cake is absolutely scrumptious!

Rating: 4
Great cake. I did what another reviewer did by only adding 3/4 cup of both sugars. Used 1/2 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup of butter. Turned out great. Everyone loved it. The only thing I will not make again is the icing. But if you do make it - add the cream cheese, butter, icing sugar THEN the orange juice slowly while it's mixing. Then you can judge the texture. I halved the icing recipe and it turned out more like a glaze than icing. Kept it in the fridge for a few hours and it was still a glaze. Added more icing sugar but that didn't help. It was still very tasty but next time I'm going to make my regular butter icing.

Rating: 4
I used some of the suggestions below and came up with great results. For the cake, I substitued half of the oil with apple sauce. Baked it in a 9" round pan, and cut the cake into three layers after it cooled. For the frositng, I used 16 oz cream cheese, 8 oz neufchatel and 8 oz butter, reduced the sugar to sligthly more than 2 cups and added the orange juice and zest. This made for a lower fat version, admittedly a little thinner than ideal, however still very usable. The cake was very moist and very well received.

After trying this recipe for guests at home and thinking that they were being overly gracious with their reviews I tried it for my kids school. A hit, once again I made it for a community function, people were short of asking for an autograph. Great recipe. If one can follow directions. I also made a couple of adjuctments adding cranberries. Moist, orange and carrots go perfectly in this recipe. Thank you.

The proportions to this recipe are all out of whack! It is unfortunate that I didn't read the other recipes before making this because the first batch of cupcakes I made from this turned out way too oily, sweet, and limp. I ended up adding more of all the dry ingredients (but halved) and an extra cup of carrots to help balance it out and give more lift. It is really not appropriate to give this recipe 4 forks if you had to make so many modifications.

This cake is delicious, although next time I would grate the carrots more coarsely as they seemed to melt away in the cake, and I like it when the cake says carrot by itself. And I wonder why my cream cheese frosting always comes out so runny - is it because I cut down on the sugar? Would it get better from folding in some whipped cream?

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Got rave reviews, had to make a few modifications though. Following the other reviewers' advice I replaced half the oil with apple sauce, only used about 1/4 cup raisins, used 4 cups grated carrot peel and only made half the frosting, with half the sugar, and still had enough left over to frost about 40 cookies.

Rating: 4
The cake was fantastic. Everyone loved it. I did use a different filling/icing as I wanted to keep the cake on the lighter, fluffier side so I 1 package of cream cheese, 1/2 cup unsalter butter, 6 TBS of orange juice, 2 tsp of the orange peel and 2 cups of confectioner's sugar and then folder in 1 1/2 cups of whipped cream. Will be making this again and again.

This is, without a doubt, my favorite carrot cake recipe! I made it for a work party and even so-called "non-carrot-cake-lovers" really really liked it and asked for the recipe!! LOVE the taste of orange - I'm a citrus freak!!

I have been looking, for a long time, for a carrot cake recipe that didn't lose "that certain something" by ommission of nuts, since I have an allergy. This is not only the best carrot cake recipe I've found, it's now one of my favorite cake recipes. The frosting recipe is a bit huge, so next time I'll reduce it by half. I made the cake in a tube pan and pulled it slightly earlier than the recipe calls for. I've also used this same recipe in a mini-cupcake pan with excellent results. The second time, I increased the amount of orange zest to try to bring out the orange flavor a little more.

I made this cake at the request of one of my 6-yr twins. He--and everyone--at the party loved it and the frosting: they were a perfect pair. My other favorite--and previously only carrot cake--has both nuts and pineapple in it and the twins are not yet into loving nuts. However since this cake received such accolades, I guess I now have two favorite carrot cake recipes! Since it was a Bcake, I made two 9-in layers and baked them for 43 minutes--perfect.

This is carrot cake to die for! This is better than any I've ever had at a bakery or restaurant. I've made this recipe several times and I always get rave reviews. The cake is moist and juicy with nuggets of delicious raisins. I love the addition of orange peel and juice and the frosting is sinfully rich. This one is definitely worth the effort!

Rating: 3
I have made this twice, to rave reviews. Baked in 2 9-inch pans instead of a large one (too lazy to cut cake in half) and worked out fine. Following other reviewers, I changed the amount of fat to 1/3 applesauce, 1/3 oil and 1/3 melted butter. THe butter adds a much richer flavor to the cake. The frosting gave me some problems the second time I made it - it wouldn't firm up even after 5 hours in the fridge. I think maybe next time I'll reduce the butter a bit as after being out for a while the frosting tends to soften too much and ends up sliding off the cake (which is why I only gave it 3 forks). Taste-wise it is awesome; a friend of mine even said that it's the BEST carrot cake she has ever had!

Rating: 4
I got rave reviews on this one! Made substitutions/changes as per suggestions: used half-cup each of oil and applesauce, cut down the sugars by a quarter cup each and added about 3/4 cup extra carrots. Also used 1 cup of walnuts instead of raisins. The cake was moist and flavorful -- just the way carrot cake should be. I found the orange flavor a bit too subtle and while the frosting was manageable and delicious, it was a bit too runny (I cut the sugar down to 2 1/2 cups and as other said, it was plenty sweet). I baked the cakes in two round pans and didn't need the wax paper and they came out without more than a solid knock. Try this if you like carrot cake!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a pretty good recipe. It had a little bit too much of an orange flavor and I kind of felt like instead of complimenting it, it kind-of took over. So I would recommend maybe putting in a little less orange juice then it says. But other than that it is delicious.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Turned out moist and beautiful-especially when cut. Instead of a square pan, I used two 9 in. round springform pans - no need for wax paper. 2 1/2 to 3 cups powdered sugar for the icing is PLENTY! I also used walnuts instead of raisins, like the other reviewers. Made for mothers day, was a big hit. Mom said I should take one to our local coffee shop, she is sure they would want to start selling it!

I loved this cake! However, I did bake it in a bunt cake pan and then i added about a cup to two of more orange juice to the frosting to make it into a nice glaze. It turned out wonderfully.

Rating: 4
The cake is perfect--I add walnuts though. The frosting is not nearly proportional to what you'll need though. Make only half, and use only half the called-for powdered sugar, and you'll still probably have more than enough frosting--enough to top both layers and sides, and it WILL be sweet enough. I don't see how they managed to use 5 cups of sugar without just dying of a sudden-onset diabetes coma. Also, I accidentally doubled the OJ in the frosting, and though it thinned it, it still tasted great. And it's thick enough if you really let it sit in the fridge. I'm making this cake again as cupcakes to get rid of all the extra frosting I made.

Rating: 4
Delicious cake that got rave reviews! Based on advice from previous cooks, I used only 1 C oil in the cake, and reduced the sugar in the frosting adding it cautiously until I liked the sweetness. The ginger was a surprise ingredient, but it tasted great. I added walnuts, and next time I will reduce the amount of raisins by at least half. I made this for an open house and then put some in the freezer for later use and it was still great.

The best carrot cake and cream cheese frosting I have ever tasted. Period.

Rating: 3
The only reason that I didn't give this a 4 was because so many modifications were made to the original recipe. All of the suggestions people made are great. here's what I did in my most recent attempt: Use 3/4 cup oil and then 3/4 cup UNSWEETENED apple sauce for the other half of the oil requirement. I've also tried using only applesauce, but I thought it was better with some oil. Reduce the sugars by 1/4 cup each. I used closer to 4 cups of carrots and it was fine. At least do 3 solidly packed cups, but more is good too. Use about 2 cups powdered sugar in the frosting. This keeps it a bit tangy. I don't know what people are talking about with making only half a frosting recipe. I made a full recipe --had plenty left over, but I would not say gobs, and it's so good you will just want to eat it with a spoon anyway. Make sure and use fresh-squeezed OJ. I LOVE THIS CAKE. Every time I make it people are almost frantic because it's so good.

I very rarely give recipes 4 stars but this one is definitely deserving.

This was THE best carrot cake we have ever had. With just a hint of orange, no one could figure out what made this such a great recipe. Easy to make..I added walnuts and raisins. Be sure to your carrots are not dripping with water from washing (dry them off) otherwise the batter is very fluid and all the raisins float to the bottom. It was moist and buttery and the rec to use only half the recipe for the frosting was true true true. I keep getting requests for this recipe..it's a definte crowd pleaser!!!!

This recipe is exceptionale - very moist and flavorful! I made it for a board meeting held at my home - and everybody carried on about how wonderful it was. My colleagues loved it, I loved it, my husband loved it and even my kids loved it. This is a definite keeper. I made the recipe exactly as indicated with the exception of omitting the raisins. Instead of a 13" x 9" pan I put the batter in two 9" round pans. The presentation was beautiful. You can easily get away with making only half of the frosting - even then I had leftovers. Try this recipe!!!

Made this a month ago as written. Was really worried how it would go over as it came out so dense and moist--it hardly rises...It was fabulous! Today I made it into cupcakes--I was able to get 24 cupcakes out of it. This time I soaked the raisins in bourbon, sub'd half the oil for applesauce and reduced the sugars by a 1/4 cup each, and I went ahead and poured in the leftover bourbon from the raisins (abt 1/8 cup). This is a cake that is better the next day so I recommend planning ahead rather than making and eating on the same day.

I was disappointed with this carrot cake. I felt that the ginger really threw off the taste and simply does not belong in a carrot cake- My favorite carrot cakes are usually simple, not too sweet, with only cinnamon and a dash of something else to set off the flavor (maybe nutmeg, cloves, or some coconut?)- to complement nice sweet carrots. I also found the texture a bit too dense/moist. Will definitely not make again!

I brought this carrot cake to a dinner party and before everyone ws served, they were coming back for seconds. It is easy and delicious. I cut the cake in half and frosted it, then refrigerated it overnight. It served 14 people and not a drop was left. This is a WINNER!

The cake was delicious (I made the recipe with no changes), but what a lot of frosting! If you see carrot cake as nothing but a vehicle for cream cheese frosting, this is definitely your recipe. The layer of frosting was almost as thick as the cake, and it overpowered it, making it hard to taste the orange and spices in the cake. Next time I will halve the frosting recipe.

This is the best carrot cake I've ever had. Even my friends who are not fans of carrot cake love it. The orange really makes the cake.

Moist and easy cake. Following advice from other reviewers I subbed one cup of applesauce for one of the cups of oil and halved the frosting recipe. Otherwise I made it according the recipe and it was great. I'm not really that fond of raisens in general so I think next time I'll use coconut and pecans instead.

I doubled the recipe, but only made 1 1/2 the amount of frosting and still had more than I needed. Made 1/2 into cupcakes which were a huge hit at my husband's office. Definitely a keeper. Took suggestetions about using 1/2 raisins (I used golden) and 1/2 nuts (pecans) and cutting way back on the sugar for the frosting. Thanks for those suggestions. I cooked the cupcakes for about 23 minutes, and they turned out fine.

This cake is great! Only three forks great because I modified it a tad to my own taste: Left out raisins, added coconut (half cup?) used apple-sauce, butter and oil rather than just oil (only 1/4c oil the rest applesauce and butter.) I used the sweetest organic carrots I could find and baked in two 9 inch rounds for 35 -40 min. It was sooooo moist and yummy. Oh - i left out the orange peel too. For the frosting i used only one stick butter, no peel, maybe two cups sugar at the most, half the OJ and it was pretty yummy. (not the best crm chs frosting i've had, but good. This cake is best chilled. My partner doesn't like carrot cake and is picky and he loved it! (he's really picky). The hardest part was grating the carrots - this is a fool proof recipe! Chill the frosting a tad for easier spreading - just a tad tho or it gets too hard. Happy baking!

I loved this! I've tried most of the carrot cake recipes on this site and they're all pretty good - it's hard to mess up carrot cake. But, I thought the orange added a nice twist to this old classic. And the orange zest on top was quite pretty. Fabulously moist.

I made some adjustments, and the cake turned out awesome.

Wonderful - everyone loved it! The first carrot cake I've ever made and I'm sticking with this recipe. I made some changes: * reduced the amount of oil to 1c * left out the raisins * added some nuts * added some chopped dried apricot (won't do that again as the taste was very sharp) * fiddled with the spices (I think I used pumpkin pie spice instead) * made up my own icing recipe (about 1c sugar to 1 tub cream cheese plus some orange juice), and used low-fat smooth cottage cheese instead of cream cheese * did not cut into layers (it came out fairly flat in a large spring-form pan) * only iced the top - it was rich and moist enough without doing the sides too

Great cake! A dessert to be proud of. I baked 2 9-in rounds, and cut each of those in half to make a pretty 4 layer cake (iced between layers and on top). Will definitely make again. Would probably cut amount of oil next time, per the earlier reviewers.

I've made this twice now and received rave reviews (which is quite remarkable the only cakes I've ever baked have come from the box). I agree with one of the reviewers who said to use 1 c. of oil instead of 1.5 cup. The cake came out very moist, even when I doubled the recipe (I used 2.25 cups then). Also, for the frosting, I suggest adding the powdered sugar to taste - 5 cups is way too sweet for me. I ended up using about 1.5 cups for a single cake.

Best carrot cake I ever ate and easy to make. Works well at mile-high altitude. I had enough batter for 3-8 inch layers.

This is by far the best recipe for carrot cake that I have used or tasted. My husband who is self proclaimed carrot cake expert raves about this cake.

This moist carrot cake is the best I have ever eaten or made. I changed a few things which might have added to the moisture but I'm not sure. In any event the results were truly incredible. Please don't pass this recipe up! I reduced oil to 1 cup. Used 3/4 cup raisins but added 1/4 cup flaked coconut and used freshly squeezed orange juice. I placed batter in two 8" cake rounds. I made the GINGER CREAM CHEESE ICING(which by the way was fabulous in itself), and cut the cakes to equal 4 layers. Iced between layers and topped off with icing. You don't need to ice the sides! The result was truly wonderful. My guests were just awed by the cake and each went home with the recipes.

Awesome was one of the comments! I made this for the first time for our Birthday Club, and every- one agreed that it was a "keeper". I made the cake in 2 9" round pans and then sliced in halves for a 4-layer cake. Really nice and great pre- sentation. However, I only put in not quite 4 cups of the sugar in the icing, and I substituted 1/2 grated pecans and 1/2 cup raising rather than the 1 cup of raisins - just enough of each. I also decorated the entire cake with icing, but next time I will only ice between layers and the top. This makes a prettier cake. Also, long slices of carrot looped on the top help decorate.

This is a fabulous carrot cake. Moist & delicious - the orange flavor gives it an extra boost and the cream cheese icing is divine!

I've been making this cake for the past three years, and everyone who has tasted it has sworn that it's the best carrot cake they've ever tasted. I haven't had any trouble with the frosting being runny, but the cake needs to be completely cooled, or you will have problems. I don't add orange peel to it, and use fresh-squeezed orange juice, rather than concentrate.

The basic recipe was very easy. it gave a lovely, flavourful moist cake the frosting was another matter. I found that after adding the orange juice I got a runny mess that did not stay on the cake once it was iced. On discussing this with my mother (A Cordon Bleu cook) she said that you shouldn't mix orange juice with cream cheese as it curdled. I think next time I would mix the Cream Cheese with orange peel and sugar. Maybe I did something wrong please let me know. My overall impression was that of good as it was my first time in making carrot cake Henrietta Jones

Maybe my oven is too hot, but the cake was overdone, and I took it out 10 minutes early. This made it very difficult to remove the waxed paper, so I'd watch the cooking time after about 30 minutes.

Sugar content could be reduced by 1/2 cup. increase the orange zest x2 carrot should not be grated fine, but would be improved if julienned... (longer thinner pcs) would make the cake more fiberous.
