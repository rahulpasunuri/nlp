Try the sauce from Coffee Rubbed Cheeseburgers with Texas BBQ sauce on this site. You can safely put it on cardboard with good results.

I agree with some of the others the sauce is a little bland when prepared exactly as written. Once tweaked a bit and combined with the turkey and slaw on a bun though it really comes together and is a nice unique way to use leftover turkey. I suggest playing around with the sauce making it your own. The slaw is yummy!

Great idea but this sauce is not good. We'll use a different sauce recipe and try this concept again.

I agree with the some of the other reviewers regarding the sauce, so I added some Trader Joe's BBQ sauce and it ended up quite tasty. I thought the slaw was fine, but I did add a little agave syrup to cut the acidity. The family really enjoyed this and I would definitely make this again. It was nice change for turkey leftovers.

I added about a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce to the BBQ. I served the turkey with mashed potatos -- no sandwich or slaw. It was a delicious easy recipe. It sure made the left-over turkey taste great!

I supplemented he cumin for some smoked paprika and added a shot of Balsamic vinegar once it was simmering: AWESOME !

I'm with the cook from Oxford OH. Pretty much a bore of a lunch. I like to cook, but the barbecue sauce was so bland I couldn't help but wonder why I wouldn't just buy a jar of factory produced gunk BBQ sauce -- at least it would have some flavor. Big disappointment this one.

If any one can think of a better way to use up left over T.G.turkey - let it be known!!

OK Recipe. Sauce is the key to this and it was just OK different. Slaw is OK but could use tweeking to a more personal taste, but good base to start with. Poker Guys like spice so we added some good Jalepeno to the sauce to spice it up a bit and a few other secret Poker guy ingredients and bang hit the Mother Lode on the taste buds. This recipe is an easy one to change to your own taste or as it is will do as well.

Wow...I was not expecting much...and in the interest of full disclosure, I did not make the slaw....even as I was making the BBQ sauce, I was pondering how to zip it up. But I decided to let it sit for awhile on the leftover chicken I poured it over and to doctor it just before serving....put it in the refrigerator for the afternoon. I am SO glad I didn't "fix" it (though I did add 1 tsp. of salt when I first prepared)--the sauce is amazing after it has had time to soak into the poultry and all the flavors have had time to marry. Smokey, bacon-y, tart and a little bit sweet--this was awesome! I know what we'll be doing with the leftover turkey next week. I grilled some plain white sesame seed buns with a small pat of butter to pile the BBQ on--perfect.

I did not enjoy this at all. I love BBQ and thought this had all the components for a simple and delicious quick meal. The slaw was bland and the BBQ was terrible. The recipe, followed strictly, produced something more akin to marinara sauce than BBQ. It lacked the tangy and spicy components that are normally associated with good BBQ sauce. The turkey was a passable substitute for pork, but the entire dish ultimately fell flat.
