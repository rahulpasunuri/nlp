Favorite cookout dish ever! My aunt has been making this recipe since it came out in Gourmet Magazine in 1991. It is always a huge hit and the leftovers are AMAZING in Calzone, just add a little extra mozzarella and roll up in pizza dough.

I served this as part of a buffet at a recent housewarming, and it was quite a hit! The beauty of antipasto is you can allow yourself to be inspired-as I was inspired by the olive and antipasto bar at my local Whole Foods. I did not use the carrots, but added additional olives (kalamata and green garlic-stuffed). Half the fun was putting together the ingredients on my own.

I took this to Easter dinner and it was a huge hit. The only thing I changed was to use roasted red peppers from a jar, and omit the yellow (to save time). So great to make the night before and just dump on a big white platter with sliced baguette on the side - beautiful and delicious!

An oldie but goodie! Invited to Easter dinner and the hostess specifically asked me to bring this dish. She remembered it from a family party about six years ago! I did not have a copy so am very happy to still find it on Epicurious. Thats a good recipe!

I made this for my husband's birthday party and it was a HUGE hit. Dressing was so good that we dipped baguette slices in to soak it up when the veggies were all gone. Everyone wanted the recipe. I can't wait to make it again (next time I'll make more and save some for leftovers).

Great Recipe. Some amendments. I took 1/2 cup of Costco Kirkland brand balsamic and boiled it down, adding a tablespoon of brown sugar. Voila, it looked and tasted like aged vinegar. Other than that (and some aged wine vinegar), I didn't change this wonderful recipe. Don't jumble the ingredients up, design a plate of beauty out of them.

Highly recommend this recipe...have been making it for years and always to rave reviews. Feel confident to substitute when you don't have all the ingredients...it is very forgiving. Recommend that you stay true to the marinade

Well, this was an expensive one for sure, but my pantry was pretty bare, so I needed to buy almost everything and I chose to buy at a more expensive grocery store for convenience's sake, so I was expecting that. This was to be the salad that would accompany various types of pizzas, and it was the perfect complement...I served it in a bowl and we scooped it (for me, it is a bit too oily to serve as finger food). At the last minute, I added baby field greens that I had on hand, and those served to soak up a bit of that extra dressing and they just added a nice layer of almost bitterness that counteracted with the sweetness of the roasted peppers and the fennel. We all loved this, and by the end of the night, our party of six had eaten it all! Served with prosecco, this was a really nice start to dinner. Fantastic marinade, beautiful presentation and just perfect for our pizza party.

I've made this recipe many times to rave reviews. If you can't find fresh mozarella, or if you want to save a few $, try cubes of aged provolone. I use half the meat recommended (also to save $) and it is still Excellent! Also, cherry tomatoes and button mushrooms are great additions. Don't skip the olives, sun-dried tomatoes or artichokes, because I think they really make the dish. The marinade is so good and so easy that I double the recipe for that and use the extra as salad dressing.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I left out the meat and used block mozzerella to save $$. This recipe was expensive to make! I used jarred roasted peppers to save time and added hearts of palm. Everyone loved it. It made a huge recipe. Our dinner party of 9 ate only half of it.

I just made this for a baby shower the other day and everyone raved. I had a couple people even ask me if I was Italian! I am not that big a fan of fennel and almost left it out but am glad that I didn't. After blanching it and marinating with the other ingredients, it really added something special to the salad. Delicious!!!

This got rave reviews. I skipped the carrots and sundried tomatoes, and first roasted the fennel and roma tomatoes (which were left over from our summer garden-brought in green and wrapped). Also skipped the meat. Beautiful presentation and everyone loved it. Would certainly make it again.

MaMia! 'sgood! At least that's what I think my Italian predesers would say. This is as time consuming as you choose it to be. I used canned red & yellow roasted peppers, (some with garlic) canned artichokes, canned sliced black olives, blanched green beans for 4 minutes, blanched carrots for 2 minutes,--and then it was a case of drain & dump. Oh ya! Had 1/2 bottle of mixed olives I had to pit. And I have a pitter. You know--one of those things you use maybe twice a year but are so grateful you have it. And can find it. I would have had to drive 45 miles to get the marinated mozzerala balls. So I just used brick cheese. I did not drain the sun-dried tomatoes. Doesn't make sense to drain them & then make a marinate of olive oil & herbs. This is one of those wonderful recipes that says "so what do you have in your cupboard?". This is almost a no-brainer. Just follow the basic suggestions. And have lots of really good good hard crusted bread to go with it.

An expensive recipie - save this for a special occasion - very impressive for special guests however. This was devoured when I made it. Marinated all of the vegetables, poured them in a pile in the middle of the platter, surrounded them with the bocconcini (drained) and lined the outside edge of the platter with 1/2 sandwich pepperoni and 1/2 soppressata. Yummmmm...

We liked this recipe so much that we served it to guests two weekends in a row. Its nice that you can change up the meat and vegetables as desired. We left out the fennel and added cubed chicken, pickled asparagus and canned hearts of palm. Make extra - its great for leftovers too.

This turned out so well, we made it for 2 parties on successive weekends. In addition to the recipe, we added pickled asparagus, jarred hearts of palm, and grilled chicken chunks for our crowd. We put the meats around the edge of the plate, soppressata on one side, chicken on the other, making it easier for people who did not eat one or both.

Rating: 4
I have made this a number of times to rave reviews. The only thing I do differently is to take out the meat. I marinate it over night, and then mound the whole thing on a platter (leaving behind the marinade) and put garlic toasts around it. I find that it keeps for a couple days in the fridge, and since it makes a lot, that is a a good thing.

I love this recipe so much, that I am afraid that I will be like the countless millions before that took it with them to the grave.

Like many who rated this recipe, I give it two thumbs way up! It is addictive. My guests returned to the platter throughout the meal and after dessert!

My guests raved over this! I used 1/4 # each of proscuitto,sopressata, capicola, thinly sliced. I did not marinate the meats but surrounded the edge of a large platter with the meats rolled up like cigarettes, alternating with slices of store bought marinated mozzarella. I did marinate the veggies,doubling the marinade and using less olive oil than called for. I piled the marinated veggies in the middle of the platter.(Carrots, green beans, fennel,black and green olives,sundried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, fresh mushrooms)I put the platter on the coffee table in the den where guests helped themselves to this first course along with chianti and toasted baguette slices. We later retired to the dining room for lasagne. THIS TASTES WONDERFUL and LOOKS IMPRESSIVE.

I've made this recipe about 8 times, and it's always a big hit. Easy to have the ingredients in the pantry for last minute preparation, and the cheese I sometimes keep in the freezer.

I made this for a luncheon and guests went back for seconds & thirds, and then served themselves more of it instead of the green salad I had prepared to accompany wild mushroom lasagna. The recipe makes a tremendous quantity. I served 6 and still have leftovers to use for several meals, and that is after I cut back on some of the ingredients. This recipe lends itself well to tailoring it to your own or your guests' tastes. I had Italian seasoning on hand so I used it instead of the individual dried herbs that were listed.

Wow, what a hit. We followed suggestions below. We were making alot so at least doubled (tripled?) the marinade. Dijon and lots of S&P were needed. We did carrots (marinated) and asparagus (unmarinated but blanded and drizzled with garlic-infused olive oil and sesame seeds) on the side and then combined these for the main platter: canned roasted red papper, green olives stuffed with garlic, soppressata, fresh mozzarella, sun-dried tomato and artichoke hearts. Wouldn't change a BITE for the next time. Absolutely fabulous -- wondered how guests would react to a very sensual, Italian-type finger food but the ATE it up. Wow!! For our large party, also did a second antipasto platter with folded proscuitto, manchego slices and black olives with sliced olive bread on the side. Both were hits.

I made this recipe for a dinner party of 30 (quadrupled the recipe but tripling would have been more than enough). Also, keeping the garlic at the one recipe amount instead of doubling for each double recipe was perfect). Everyone loved the dish so much I made it again the following week for a buffet dinner for different group of 45 - again, a favorite. The fennel was a big hit even with those (my husband included) who said they don't like fennel. I think the recipe would be great with or without the meat.

This recipe was simple and delicious. It was perfect as an appetizer served with bread to sop up the yummy flavors. I omitted the fennel and suggest adding cut up pieces of salami and provologne cheese to the mix. It was a big hit with my holiday dinner!

This recipe is great! I have made it 7 or 8 times now and everyone raves and wants the recipe!I add a bunch of blanched asparagus to the mix and always let the antipasto marinate overnight. Another trick for those fennel skeptics is to blanch the fennel until it is a little softer (not mushy)then submerge it in ice cold water. The flavor mellows and most people who eat it always say "wow, what is this". A little on the expensive side though after you finish buying all the ingredients, but well worth it!To save a little time, try using a really good quality bottled balsamic vinaigrette. It cuts a little time and mess!A+++++

Wow, this is a great recipe. I made this in a double batch for a staff potluck at work and for a dinner party the same night...made it the night before and let it sit. Flavors are marvelous and the dish itself is gorgeous. I also used the tortellini in place of the cheese and the meat. I would say the downside is that the ingredients were a bit expensive....I spent about $53 to make the double batch. Ouch. But it was worth it.

This is a great dish to make for a crowd. It's very easy to prepare (if you buy roasted pepper) and the veggies taste fantastic together. One hint: don't add the parsley until the last minute. It starts to look old when it chills in the fridge for a couple of hours.

I am not a fennel fan so left it and the meat and the mozzarella balls out altogether. What I did put in was cheese tortellini! I used a little of the marinade on the veggies(added portabello 'shrooms) the nite before and after cooking and cooling the tortellini, added it to the veggies with the rest of the marinade and served it at an Italian wine tasting at the wine store where I work. Gosh, it was to die and was totally gone. Sometimes you just work with what you have and everything works out well! I cant wait to make this again-the marinade is an awesome "dressing".

This was a hit. I also added marinated mini-portabella mushrooms and I used an aged basalmic vinegar - expensive but worth it. The flavor improved considerably with longer marination time - I let mine marinate for 10 hours. I thought the fennel was great - no anti-fennel comments.

Great antipasto. Guests are impressed by the presentation of this dish - looks like you've gone to a lot of trouble. I laid it out on a big platter, separating out the different items. The variety of colors is very pretty. It seemed like a lot of food but it went quickly both times I have made it. I served the meat on the side since my company included vegetarians. Could have skipped the meat entirely. Used high quality bottled roasted peppers to save time, and increased the amount of carrots - since they are a favorite and inexpensive relative to the other ingredients. I also broiled mushrooms and added them to the marinade and they went very quickly. I would say the fennel was the least appreciated by my guests, but worth making as it is quite good,easy to prepare and a bit exotic.

I doubled this recipe for a dinner party for 14 ravenous people and it was much more than enough. That said, it was a huge hit and we all loved it. The colors are beautiful and the flavor fantastic. I would have put more fresh mozzarella in there though as it was the first item picked out. Fennel-haters ate it not knowing they were eating fennel as the blanching process really helped make fennel less anise-tasting, which is great for this purpose!

We have made this antipasto MANY times, and each time we have had the same results - people LOVE this dish! The adjustments we have made: we double (and sometimes triple) the marinade and use more garlic - maybe 4 cloves. We also add cauliflower. Finally, do not mix the items all together. Instead, serve it in a clear glass large flat dish (like a 9x13 pan) and put the carrots all together and the peppers, olives, etc. This gives a nice presentation of the colors.

I presented this dish at a welcome party for out of towners. They had never eaten antipasto before and just loved it, as did all the party guests. I did serve it anchovy toast which was a big hit.

This recipe is wonderful. It was first introduced at our Neighborhood Gourmet Group. I have made it 3 times since with rave reviews. I used every ingredient as listed and wouldn't omit a thing. The fennel is perfect - even if you think you don't like fennel. As we all know, presentation is key. I serve this salad/antipasta over a loaf/roll of goat cheese in a low serving dish or bowl. Then, I surround the bowl with slices of baguette in a cloth lined basket. I would highly recommend this with a bottle of nice red wine, such a chianti or merlot, for lunch or a light dinner. I love to have it as an appetizer. I use the leftovers tossed with pasta either cold, as a salad, or warm. My review ~ Yummy!!!!!
