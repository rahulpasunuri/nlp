Baked this cake for my fathers 71st. I needed to use 9" pans, refrigerated the 2 cakes overnight and had no problem cutting the layers in half. I decided to crumb coat and refrigerate then add the final frosting. Used minichips between layers and they did add a nice dimension to the cake. The cake tasted great and was dense, very chocolatey and yummy. The frosting is good, but it's really just chocolate whipped cream. FYI - frosting is light in color - not a dark chocolate frosting. Was asked if it was cool whip since it's light and fluffy.

The ratio of wet ingredients to dry seemed a little off in this recipe; almost as if the liquids were compensating for a lack of fat. I was unable to cream the ingredients to achieve the beautiful lift that comes from slowly emulsifying the fats/eggs. As a result, my cake ended up slightly soggy and sagged in the middle after cooling. The cake was also too crumbly - fell apart when I tried to transfer from the cake pan to a plate. The Double Chocolate Layer Cake on this site remains undefeated as my ultimate chocolate cake.

We followed the instructions exactly, although we made it into cupcakes (about 18 minutes of baking time) instead of a cake. They were awesome! I couldn't find mini-chips at our local store, so I chopped up regular ones and it worked fine. Don't leave out the chips from the icing -- they're really great. We used Hershey's to make it peanut-safe, and they're still really good!

My family loved this cake, with my husband even calling it "perfect". I layered the chocolate chips between each layer instead of adding to the frosting. I also added a tsp of vanilla to the batter just because I had too! Both of my kids said they wouldn't have liked the chips in the frosting as frosting should be smooth.

This cake was easy and delicious! I used dental floss to slice through the cake layers and it worked great. I sprinkled the mini chips between the layers but didn't put any on top. There was some leftover icing and my daughter and I decadently each had a bowlfull!!!

This is a great recipe. Don't deviate at all from the recipe given here. It's perfect the way it is. Chocolatey goodness. I made it as a birthday cake and everyone loved it.

This is a good, simple, quick chocolate cake. I've made it 4+ times and never changed anything about the recipe. Every time the reviews have been raves. The cake is moist. The chocolate chips in the icing work; don't be scared of them. As a basic chocolate cake, this recipe is really, really good. Highly recommend it.

The frosting was great although I did add the mini chips and my discriminating (read-opininated) family thought they should have been left out. We made this cake for Father's day and are always searching for the lovely moist chocoalte cake, but this is not it. A bit too dry even thought followed the recipe except added a drizzle of Italian Almond Roca syrup to a few layers before adding the frosting.

FEB: Great! For cake, followed directions exactly except added 2 t Penzeys cake spice (a remarkable spice blend), a nice addition. Very moist and texture/weight made it a breeze to cut and frost. The icing is WONDERFUL! Also added 1 t cake spice, and sprinkled a few MINI chips on top as well along with a few tiny red/pink/white valentine's hearts so quite festive. Great fun with a six-year old assistant! MARCH UPDATE: Used the fabulous whipped cream icing with a bit of lavender added on the Devil's Food Cake (BA Mar 04, not yet online) and also mixed 10 oz frozen raspberries (miked and drained a bit) with big dollops of whipped cream for the middle layers. VERY grown-up for anyone worried about a 'kid' factor. But the kids loved it this way too ...

It was awsome! Moist, dense, chocolatey, and the frosting was really a dessert all onto itself. I do think the chocolate chips should be reserved for a child's cake. Hands down the best chocolate cake I've made--and eaten!

Great recipe for chocolate cake when you are looking to make a more traditional cake. Very moist and the frosting is T-A-S-T-E-Y!

The frosting definitely makes this cake, and that it's so simple to make, makes it that much more delectable. Looking for a short-cut? I've subtituted a devil's food box cake mix and got equally rave reviews. Can't wait to make it again.

Yummy cake and frosting! Added about 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and wasn't overwhelming. Do try and refrigerate at least 1 hour to get the best texture of the frosting. I didn't have time the first time and tasted like chocolate whipping cream instead of mousse!

I make the cake only and frost with coconut pecan frosting. The cake is delicious!

What makes this cake absolutely delectable is the frosting; the cake itself is terrific as well, but I did make some modifications to both cake and frosting. Small thing to the cake: after buttering the pans, I used dutch process cocoa to dust, rather than flour. With the frosting, I skipped the mini-chocolate chips and did not fold any chocolate into the frosting. Instead, after frosting each layer, I sprinkled a lavish amount of JUST white chocolate shavings (use a vegetable peeler on room temp chocolate). Then frosted the whole cake and threw a bunch more shavings all over it, some spilling around the edge of the cake and it was gorgeous and scrumptious. The only thing I would modify about that treatment is that the layers did not stay stuck together as reliably as usual, once a slice was cut, b/c of the white shavings. So next time, I'll either just use shavings on the final application of frosting, or fold in shavings to some of the frosting, reserved for application to the inner layers of the cake. The frosting itself is very "mousse-like", as another reviewer mentioned, and would easily work as a dessert (in a very tiny dish -very rich!) all by itself! I will be using this recipe 20 years from now for family birthdays and any other excuse I can conjure up to make it again and again. Fantastic! p.s. the mini chips or some other tiny candies would make for a great modification for a child's bday cake! I decided that the shavings gave it a little more sophistication and better quality chocolate bits (buying a chunk of high quality white chocolate).

What a wonderful cake! I made this for my husband's birthday and he just loved it. The frosting is so good and easy to make. I did cut back on the amount of mini chocolate chips that I added to the frosting though ... just 1 cup. I'll definitely make this again.

I forgot to slice the layers in half (that portion of the recipe printed out on a 2nd page, which I missed), so my cake turned out just slightly dry. I believe cream frosting between additional layers would solve the problem, so I still give this recipe 4 forks. I also used the mini chips as a garnish instead of folding them into the frosting (and sprinkled some between layers as someone else suggested). The simple chocolate cream frosting recipe is a definite keeper, I know I'll be making that one again and again! This cake was the hit of the party, and I know that next time I make it with the correct number of layers it will be even better. I also wouldn't hesitate to make this recipe without the chocolate chips, they are completely optional.

Absolutely amazing. I follow the directions exactly, though sometimes with less chocolate chips (the texture and taste of the frosting doesn't need them) and there are never any leftovers.

This cake was absolutely delicious!!! It was a really big hit. I have already made it twice. The first time I folded the chocolate chips into the frosting as per the instructions. It was great but a little too chocolatey for my taste. The next time I sprinkled chocolate chips between the layers as one of the other reviewers recommended. I liked it better that way.

Good cake-dense and chocolatey, which is just fine with me. I used a 13x9 pan, and it worked out okay. It was too thin for me to cut it horizonally, so I just cut it in half, and it worked out for me. The frosting works really well with this cake (minus the choc. chips)-nice and light, so a good balance for this intense and rich cake.

I was not confident of my ability to split the layers, so I used 3 9-inch cake pans. The layers were done in about 15 minutes, and although they did not rise very high, the cake was nice and chocolatey. The chocolate cream frosting (without chips) was a big hit, and very easy.

I made this cake for a chocoholics birthday. She raved about it for days. The cake is so moist and the whipped cream frosting makes it so light and cool and the crunch of the little chocolate chips---all I can say is OH MY GAWD!!! The remainder of the group of people I served this to were a mixed bag in their opinions about chocolate. The two that can take chocolate or leave it both said that this is without a doubt the best chocolate anything they have ever eaten. That is extremely high marks from these two!! I will be making this cake many more times for sure. My mother is the queen of all chocolate lovers so I am planning to make this for her birthday. Used recipe exactly as written.

The cake is the most moist delicious chocolate cake I have ever made. I have not only used the recipe as is, but I have also made the cake with buttercream frosting. Rave reviews either way.

This cake is mediocre. Do not put the chocolate chips in the frosting. Good chocolate flavor.

Am I the only one who found there to be too much baking soda in this cake? It overwhelmed the chocolate flavour. Cream topping & filling was very good though...will make it again, but not the cake. Jake

Very good and easy. This cake is particularly tasty with fresh raspberries, which I always use to decorate the top and sometimes around the bottom, too. I'm ambivalent about the mini-chips. I've put them in the frosting and in the cake, and find them uninteresting. Next time, I think I'll leave them out altogether.

I made this cake for a family gathering and it was a huge hit. I must admit, I omitted the minichips between the layers; it just didn't sound like they would add anything special except little nuggets of unpleasantly hard texture. A couple of previous reviewers said their cake layers came out dry so I almost didn't try this recipe but boy, am I glad I did. Mine came out very moist, and the chocolate whipped cream was fabulous. It made the cake taste rich yet light at the same time. Even a day later, straight from the fridge, the cake was still very moist and luscious. I didn't bother decorating it with chocolate shavings, either. Four layers of cake and cream were pretty impressive on their own. Suggestion: I found a product in my supermarket called Whip It made by Oetker. You add the powder to heavy cream before whipping and it stabilizes it and keeps it from separating over time. Worked great in this recipe.

This cake has a wonderfully sophisticated taste. Rich and chocolatey, but not overly sweet. The recipe is easy and quick with the only difficulty being slicing the cakes in half.

AWESOME!! Made the cake a day ahead and drove 3 hours. Put it all together for a 40th bash including choc shavings and fresh sliced strawberries. I won the prize for most thoughtful gift. 2 layers and tons of frosting is all people need! Followed exactly...WILL make again!! YUM!

I tried this recipe for a small birthday gathering (of adults), and decided to halve the recipe, using just one cake pan. I also omitted the chocolate chips in the frosting. I decorated it with store-bought chocolate letters and chocolate shavings. It was a big hit--light but very chocolatey--and was perfect to follow a big meal. Champagne suited it well as an accompaniment.

I love this recipe but agree with Elizabeth from San Francisco-the smooth cream frosting seems to work better. I sliced the layers thin (I finally had 5!) and added a thin coating of raspberry jam between the layers.

This is a somewhat good idea, but the minichips in the cocoa-whipped-cream is a bit gritty. I think the chips should be in the cake itself, and the frosting to be smooth cream. The layers didn't raise very high, but they are a good chocolate-buttermilk cake. It was fine, but not nearly as spectacular as it sounded.

Quite delicious and even better the next day. My cake was quite dense and instead of cooking it in two pans I split into 3. Decorated the cake with edible flowers and blackberries from our garden

Absolutely yummy. I made this for a work birthday party and it received rave reviews. I think the cake could be a little more moist (but I live in a dry climate, so it could just be the air). I covered the cake and frosting with ganache instead of the shavings. Worth the calories!

Awesome!! I made this cake for my grandmother's 84th b'day and she keeps asking me for the recipe. Rave reviews! I did not use any parchment paper, just butter and floured the pans and it was perfect, topped with strawberries! I do not have an electric mixer either and had no problems. Definately a chocolate lovers dream!

Easy to make. A good standard cake to please everyone. I followed the recipie exactly, except I reduced the baking time by 5 minutes (and I could have cut it by a little more.) The frosting was dense and had just the right amount of sweetness. The cake part was light and airy. The combination produced a rich cake. Wasn't too chocolatey. Can serve 12 easily. Note: It was worthwhile to use parchment paper instead of springform pans.

very good=frosting very good. I found the cake slightly dry but I possibly could have overcooked by a tad. Im definitley going to try again to see how it works out. Im leaving the chips out of the frosting this time and adding them to the cake mix instead.
