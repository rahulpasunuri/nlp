These were disgusting. I followed the directions to an anal-retentive T and came up with awful little play-dough-flavored biscuits. These are the kinds of cookies your tasteless neighbor gave to your family at Christmas time when you were a kid. Your mom would graciously accept them and leave them on the counter for one night, just to give the rest of her family the benefit of the doubt. When they weren't touched in the morning, your mother would just quietly toss them into the trash, wash the plate, and graciously return them to the neighbor (knowing full well she'd have to do it again next year). Your mother was a very gracious woman. You should call her and tell her you love her. And also, warn her against this awful little recipe.

Warning: this is a tea cookie, NOT an oatmeal cookie. Never the less, they are delicious. I left out the cranberry, but added extra zest. I also replaced 2 tsp of vanilla with 1 tsp of nutmeg. I will certainly be making these again

This and the other ecipes from the master dough recipe have been staples for me at the holidays since they were featured in 1995. Excellent flavor and the variations make it easy to make 1 dough and have several varieties.

definitely NOT an oatmeal cookie, at least not a traditional version of one. flavors are good and it makes a refined and subtle cookie. i served them at a picnic and didn't get the response i had hoped for, just an ambivalent one. i would add more oats and cranberries to give them more depth. also, yield was more like 5 dozen.

While these are tasty, they are at heart a **butter** cookie, not an oatmeal cookie. I should have known better, since they're made from the "Basic Butter Cookie Dough" recipe, but I was aiming for an oatmeal cookie, so I was disappointed. However, they are really quite tasty and have been popular with my cookie-gift recipients.

This is the 3rd year that I have taken this recipe to a 'Cookies & Carols' pre-Christmas gathering and, once again, I got several requests for the recipe. It is my very favorite Christmas cookie. I do adjust it slightly by increasing the cranberries to 1 1/2 Cups and the zest to the total amount from one whole orange. I also add 1/2 Cup of finely chopped pecans.

This is an all time favorite of ours for the holidays. Easy to make, oatmeal makes the cookie healthy with great crumb and the orange and cranberry is a great combination. I make this every year.

This is the best cranberry orange cookie I've ever had. I've made others that were too soft and the oats added nice body. I only got about 3 dozen cookies, I did't need 7 dozen anyway.

i made these cookies for my family and they really enjoyed them. Although they were not the best oatmeal cookies i have ever made, they were still delicious.

These cookies are not worth making! Very little taste, very bland. There are so many good cookie recipes, that these ones just aren't worth your time or ingredients. Would not make these cookies again, and I would not recommend this recipe at all

great recipe...but i used the entire egg in the butter cookie dough and beat the butter and sugar until very pale. it was light as a feather. someone suggested soaking the cranberries in triple sec which i did for one batch with an addition of the orange zest. the other batch i used another's suggestion for almond extract and added some ground almonds. both were fantastic!

These are surprisingly delicate and crisp. Colorful on a plate of cookies, too. But I noticed that nobody really went for them, but I liked them.

We love these whether made the original way or by adding the white chocolate chips and a splash of amaretto. Just made a big batch for a benefit for a mom with metastatic breast cancer. One thing you need to do to get really good, light results is to cream together the butter and sugar until light a fluffy. I gave this recipe to a friend to try, and they also baked cookies that tasted like rocks, nearly inedible.

Yummy, have made it without any changes. But also have made it using a roll of refrigerated sugar cookie dough. Tasted the same and SUPER easy! I halved the amounts of the add-ins (cranberries, oats and orange zest). Honestly could not tell the differnce and it took me about 5 minutes to make the dough. Was inspired from teh ***Cookie Dough Delights*** (a book on doctoring rolls of sugar and chocolate cookie dough). Awesome recipes in it, even better than this!

Took this to a cookie exchange and it was wonderful. Very tasty and not too sweet. Made the basic cookie dough and used 1/2 for this recipe.

This recipe was featured in my local (suburban Philly) paper, so I decided to try it.I laid wax paper over the cookies and flatteend them with the glass before coating in sugar, and baked them on parchment paper. I got exactly 6 dozen 2" cookies. They're great as a snack with hot tea! In future I'd add more orange zest and chop the cranberries more finely.

I have made these every year for our cookie exchange and still get requests for the recipe.

i love this recipe! i just altered it slightly - i added a large handful of chocolate chips, doubled the amount of cranberries, added 1/8 cup of chopped candied ginger and then added a dash or two of nutmeg and cinnamon. everyone loves them :0)

These are good, but I'd definitely add more cranberries. Mine were small and I didn't get 7doz cookies. I soaked my cranberries in Triple Sec instead of water and added orange extract as well. Also added walnuts. Good, but next time will use 1.5 or twice the amount of cranberries.

I don't really know what I did wrong, but my cookies look and taste like rocks. I have read the recipe about five times since I made them, but I am fairly sure I followed it exactly. My brother said that they are too dry and I agree.

Loved these cookies, but beware of the yield. I barely made four dozen, many of which were much smaller than 2 inches, from this recipe. I also added a bit of orange extract for a bit more flavor.

Like the cook from Clayton, I added more cranberries and orange zest. I also added a tablespoon of Chambord Liquer. The rasberry taste really gave them zing. And instead of using wax paper on the glass, I dipped it in the sugar to keep from sticking. Great recipe.

My cookies tasted almost salty??? I measured everything exactly and after reading the reviews, added some more cranberries and orange zest, and halved the vanilla and put in some Triple Sec. I liked the basic recipe, but not very happy with the Cranberry Orange variation. Also, I didn't get anywhere near the stated quantity.

Great recipe, I've made these for several years, and always get requests for more. I recommend adding a little extra zest as well as cranberries to give them more flavor. Dried cherries and nuts are also a good variation.

I have made these year after year as part of my Christmas baking, and they are a great counterpart to the sweeter and richer flavors of some of the other recipes. Don't leave out the step of coating them in sugar, it adds a lot to their flavor - I think because of the oatmeal they are a bit bland without it. I don't find any need to add extracts, etc. with the cranberries and orange zest.

I altered the recipe as well. I omitted the oatmeal [as the standard sugar cookie recipe was a bit dry], added orange oil, and orange-flavored dried cranberries. The result was an amazing moist and flavorful cookie. I will definitely make it again, especially around the holidays.

Here I go to yet another cookie exchange and these are always a big hit! I too doctor them up a bit with pecans and extra zest. We love these cookies

I saw this recipe and did not feel it had enough oomph, so I added 2/3 small bottle of orange extract and a cup of chopped walnuts. I also rehydrated the berries w/ hot water. Results "WOW", everyone wants the recipe!!

Added the white chocolate chips and drizzeld icing made with orange juice and 10x sugar. Great hit at work. Only thing with the recipe I was able to make 48 cookies. (a little less than expected). Will definately make again.

This is a good recipe, but needs some tweaking - I used twice the orange zest, and added 1/2 tsp. almond extract. Orange or lemon extract would also work well. What I got was a nice, subtle "grown-up" cookie. These would be wonderful served with after dinner coffee, and for something a little bit different, accompanied by marmalade or cranberry relish for dipping. They would also make a nice garnish for ice cream with fruit compote.

I just make this recipe, however I added white chocolate chunks and a tsp. of orange oil. They turned out to be a very fragrant shortbread type cookie. I think would be very nice for the holidays. And they were no trouble at all, I doubled the recipe and yielded about 120 cookies.

Red Cranberries rolled with green sugar made a very Christmas type cookie

while this smells wonderful cooking, not sure where you get 7 dozen out of this recipe. we only got 32 cookies (1 inch like the recipe says). what's up with that eh?

Very unique - could use a tad more orange zest.

The cranberry and orange flavors in this cookie are really great, together with the oatmeal. This would make a great Christmas cookie or something different for a cookie exchange. I added white chocolate chips to my second batch and they were also good.
