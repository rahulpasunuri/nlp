I made this yesterday and absolutly love the flavor. However it has a strong scent of witch hazel. Ideas anyone? Thanks

Great recipe. You can use a salad spinner too. Chop tomatoes and toss with salt. Let sit in salad spinner basket for an hour or so. Spin. Strain tomato water and use the tomatoes for salsa or any other recipe calling for chopped tomatoes.

I've been interested in trying this recipe. Just a thought - I wonder if the solids would make a good paste if you dehydrate them in a low oven and then passed through a food mill...maybe not worth the effort, but seems like a nice opportunity to be resourceful.

Amazing, intense flavor. I found that this freezes quite well (in ice cube trays), but loses flavor if you refrigerate instead of freezing.

This stuff is great. I use it to make tomato martinis. I rub a fresh basil leave on the rim of the glass and garnish with a small tomato, mozarella cheese ball and basil leaf. The question about freezing...I've tried it and it looses almost all of its flavor, so wouldn't suggest freezing.
