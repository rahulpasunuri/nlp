We all love this recipe. I've actually made it with corn I froze from the garden, added a little chopped red pepper for color, cut the butter in half, for herbs used basil, parsley, cilantro, dill and a little thyme.

this was great. I didn't follow the measurements very well but it still turned out great

there is way too much going on in this recipe. If you cut the herbs in half measurements and add a little lemon juice, it comes out very tasty

Great side. Went for seconds. Easy to make and would be great to make a larger quantity for a group bbq.

I had this last night at a friend's dinner party. It is fabulous - everyone had seconds and one guest said "this gives corn a whole new meaning!"

Fabulous! My partner and I tried out this recipe on our faithful guinea-pig guest. He and we loved it, and we're making it again this weekend for a larger group. The cumin seed adds a wonderful flavor to this dish, and I may up it slightly next time. Also, watch the shallots to make sure they don't over-brown.

This was really good. Thought that the herbs would be overpowering but not so. Also was worried that the dill would drown out the other flavours but it didn't. Seconds for everyone.

Very yummy and easy. I did not have cumin seeds, but sprinkled some ground cumin. Used basil, parsley, dill, mint and oregano and very tasty. Added 1 squeeze of fresh lime for the heck of it.

This was really tasty. Made it with another spinach dish & crusty bread for a great summer vegetarian dinner. The dill was a little overwhelming so I would probably use less.

Loved this! Thought the flavor were delicious. Fresh summer corn was extremely sweet. Nice alternative to corn on the cob, especially for a group of women.

fresh ingredients is what makes this sooo delicious. it's a very forgiving recipe and hard to mess up.

A really fabulous dish that appeased both kids and adults alike. I like that you can alter the types and amounts of fresh herbs that you use in this recipe, yet still have a tasty dish in the end. I didn't use any tarragon the second time I made it, but it still came out delicious. Definitely a new part of my dinnertime rotation!

My husband went ape over this. Served it with sliced tomatoes and the zucchini ribbon salad in the August BA where this recipe was. An excellent veggie supper on a hot day. Used a little olive oil instead of butter, minced garlic instead of shallots (what I had on hand.) Used basil, tarragon, fennel, oregano, rosemary, parsley, and lemon balm from the garden. Didn't have any dill, I bet it would have been nice. Won't add rosemary next time, even though I added just a little bit to the overall mix it still came through too strongly.

Very easy to make. We used dried chives and tarragon because I couldn't find fresh at the last minute, but it was still good. Next time I would omit the salt from the original list of ingredients and add salt to taste afterward.

surprisingly delicious for such a simple dish. any herbs you choose would go well. i will make this often.

This was a great recipe, we really enjoyed it. I used fresh parsley, basil, tarragon and chives and threw in a pinch of dried dill along with the cumin and shallots. Really good, really flexible. Definitely going into heavy rotation.

I did it with caramelized onions, basil, tarragon, oregano, sea salt and course pepper, forget the butter. Definitely a nice way to enjoy fresh corn off the cob

I really liked the shallot with this recipe. It added sweetness. I loved it with just the butter, shallot and cumin seed. I did not add the tarragon as I don't like tarragon. I think this recipe is pretty flexible. Add the herbs you like best. My boyfriend went for seconds. I definitely recommend getting fresh, sweet corn.
