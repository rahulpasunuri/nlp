This is our go-to side dish for pork or lamb. It's bright and delicious. I dramatically decrease the oil, and sub aprictos for the currants. I've also begun to make it with quinoa. The texture isn't as good, but it's so healthy and still delicious. Enjoy!

Delicious. Definitely half the oil as suggested by previous reviewers. I used bulk pistachio nuts and shelled and toasted them my self which was quite a pain, as I multiplied the recipe by five to serve at a party. However, It was worth it. I got rave reviews from guests, and the leftovers were great served as a complete meal with grilled chicken mixed in. It was an unusual, but surprisingly tasty mix of flavors.

There just seemed to be so much going on with this dish. I was planning to serve a Moroccan chicken stew over it, and between the veggies and spices in the stew and the fruits, nuts, and herbs in the couscous, it was just too much. Maybe as a stand-alone side?

Very tasty and simple recipe. I added a bunch of chopped up fresh mint instead of the parsley. Excellent as an accompaniement to grilled meat or poultry.

Made this two months ago,"as is", and served it with the Island Pork tenderloin on this site. Loved it. In fact, will be making it again this week. Can't wait. Different and flavorful.

I made it with whole wheat couscous and it was great! Everyone enjoyed it.

This was easy, pretty on the plate, and delicious, but you don't need to use nearly as much oil as called for; that makes it a bit greasy. I halved it, and the dish didn't suffer in the slightest.

This is a great little recipe. It's simple and yet the flavors are fantastic. And the timbales are an easy way to add a fancy presentation to this quick-to-make dish.

This is one of those outstanding recipes that is as delicious and attractive as it is quick and easy. I make it often, and I usually use dried apricots instead of currants. If the apricots are soft and tender, it's not even necessary to soak them, and I find the flavor is brighter and more assertive than that of the currants. In any case, the recipe pairs particularly well with lamb or pork.

A wonderful reliable dinner-party dish. Can be easily molded with any type of ramekin or even an ice cream scoop. Looks beautiful on wilted greens or surrounded by orange and/or pear slices.

This is a delicious dish, the currants are a great addition to the couscous. I served it with Moroccon Cornish Hens, and the combination won raves from our guests. As I write this, I'm preparing this dish for company for the second time!

I tripled this and served it as a side dish with grilled pork tenderloin. Huge hit. It looks great and is easy to prepare. I don't even like couscous much - this was delicious.

I did this with toasted pine nuts instead of pistachios, and did not make it as a timbale. It was very nice. Not a "wow" at first, but I realized I couldn't stop eating it. I plan to make it for a dinner party for 100 next month.

I make this dish quite often for dinner parties, but not as timbales--I quadruple the recipe and serve it as a side dish. It is great with pork roast, and also makes a tasty cold salad.
