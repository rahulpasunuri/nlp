This is one of my "go to" recipes for a special occasion cake that never fails to please. Not too difficult and the results have always been beautiful and delicious. I love the combination of flavors.

This cake was A LOT of work, but that does not factor into my opinion of it at all. The cake was alright, good...not great. The flavors were extremely light and reminded me of a cake that should be served at a garden tea party in the middle of summer. Not worth the high praise it has received, in *my* opinion.

While reviewing comments prior to baking, I compared the magazine recipe to the online and found the missing frosting coffee crystals measurement which is 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon instant coffee crystals. I am looking forward to baking the torte. As for the frosting not thickening as it should, try using an old fudge making hint to stir chocolate mixtures with a wooden spoon. I do not understand why, but it works.

WONDERFUL!!! I made this for a dinner party hosted by my inlaws and everyone raved. However the process is very time-consuming, but worth it. I did thicken the sauce a bit before adding to the layers. I loved the chocolate whipped frosting and plan to use it on other desserts. By the way, hasn't anyone heard of using toothpicks to keep the layers from sliding? Problem solved. Just be careful when serving. I had no problem transporting this dessert.

Very tender and moist. My boyfriend and I made it for a friend's birthday, and it was a big hit. I gave the frosting a little twist by adding some raspberry syrup to it and skipping the mysterious "coffee crystals" specified in the recipe; it gave the frosting a wonderful berry tang. The layers did slip and slide a bit as my boyfriend frosted it, but transporting it wasn't a problem as we made sure to chill the whole cake overnight. However, good as this cake is, I feel that there's something missing--some kind of zip or zing that I was looking for. I'll definitely make this torte again, time consuming though it is, but I'll keep tweaking it until I get the taste down to my satisfaction.

Agreed! It's outstanding and on a scale of 1-10 is a 6 to make -- more fussy than hard. I solved the soft frosting issue with a tablespoon of gelatin - softened in 3 T. water and melted - added to the cream when it's whipped. Next time I will double the frosting. I made this for a dinner party and had to cut off part of the torte so the frosting would cover.

This is absolutely great. It takes awhile to make since you have to work in stages. That's the only drawback.

There's no amount listed for coffee crystals in the frosting, so I added 1 tsp. My frosting wasn't nearly thick enough (sat in the fridge overnight so definitely was fully chilled before use) and the poor cake slid all around while in transit to VT. This cake was moist and delicate and delicious. Next time I'll try to get the filling stickier & the frosting stiffer so it can survive transport.

The cake was delicious! Be sure to chill the frosting well before decorating, makes it a lot easier. Instead of instant coffee crystals, I used some strong espresso and added it to the cake batter, it worked just as well.

Absolutely scrumptious!!! No other word for it.(And not too difficult to prepare)
