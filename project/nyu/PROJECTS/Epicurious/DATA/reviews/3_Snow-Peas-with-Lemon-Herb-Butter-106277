Agree with previous reviewer - you never boil snow peas. There are much better recipes out there for snow peas - they are too delicious to waste on this one.

I also felt these were a bit greasy and the ratio to the lemon butter and peas were a little off. This was just 'okay' and I dont think I'll be making them again though.

Good flavor and very easy side dish. I felt there was a little too much of the butter mixture for the amount of snow peas, though - they tasted a little greasy to me. Next time, I will either cut back on the amount of butter or increase the amount of peas.

I love snow peas just plain and uncooked so I don't usually think of cooking them for dinner. I made this recipe to accompany Salmon with Soy-Honey and Wasabi Sauces and felt that it went very well with the menu.

No way do you boil snow peas. Steam 'em lightly or saute' them in the butter mixture. Wonderful, easy, flavor combo.
