Made this once for a large party and it went over well as an "interesting" item. I have since made it with sweet potatos instead of parsnips, substituting some cinnamon for the pepper, and they have always been raved over.

Delicious! Made several times since 1995, but have streamlined procedure. I oven roast the match stick size parsnips, make the choux paste as directed, unless in a pince for time. Occassionally, I just beat the eggs by hand and fold in either the pureed parsnips. Chopping roasted parsnips eliminates a dish to clean and adds an interesting texture. PS Sometimes the roasted parsnips disappear, thus I've learned to make extras. They are a great flavor served alone. Bon Appetite!
