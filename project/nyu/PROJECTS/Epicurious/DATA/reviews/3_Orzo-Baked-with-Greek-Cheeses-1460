i made this for supper club last night. one of the things i love about this site is everyone's reviews; i added the wilted spinach and increased the amount of cream. everyone raved; i thought it was pretty good. also, i made a separate dish using jasmine rice (i am a celiac).

I have made this recipe many times. I feel it is important to use the listed ingredients to enjoy the best flavor. Trader Joe's has a great Authentic Feta packed in brine, and always use fresh dill. The only adjustments I have made is adding water to the cooling pasta. This will allow the pasta to absorb the water rather then all of the cream, which can leave the side dish "dry". I also cover the dish with foil while baking....I find that this keeps the moisture in as well....as I like the dish to be creamy. I use this alot at "pot lucks" as everyone seems to love this "turn" on "mac & cheese"... Yes I said it... MAC & CHEESE...

Very good, very easy to make. My supper club loved it. I took previous advice and used 1 1/2 tsp of Greek seasoning (spice isle) instead of the dill. Also wilted a 1 lb bag of spinach, squeezed out the excess water and chopped. Added a little color as well as some nutrients. Will make again.

oliandy - you are so right. The first time I made it, I used a ??Trader Joe brand and DeChecco pasta. Almost did not make it again but I was desperate for a dill recipe. This time, fresh (bulk)french feta from a deli and the Rustichella brand orzo, which is larger than the inexpensive brands.

Good stuff. To the reviewers below who thought this was just okay -- I think the success of this dish depends especially on the quality of the ingredients. I used French feta (President brand), which I really like, and dill from our herb garden. So good -- the feta melted gently and the dill really popped in your mouth. Served this with a little hummus with halved cherry tomatoes for a fresh, summery Mediterranean feeling. Will make this again.

I make this often and everyone likes it. But, I do add an additional half cup of cream, otherwise it is a too dry.

For all the cheese and cream in this dish, I would expect more bang for my buck. This was good, not great. I wouldn't make it again. I followed the recipe exactly, and both my husband and I thought it was really bland.

I made this recently as a side dish to grilled salmon. My guests couldn't get enough of it! I followed the recipe exactly. Simple and delicious. I will make this often.

This dish is a staple in my household. I use Romano, not Kasseri. The dish is easy to put together and is great with grilled meats and any Greek dish.

These days, mac and cheese runs the gamut from elbows with orange cheddar to penne with mornay sauce, so I have no problem labeling this a mac and cheese dish. Very good as written; however, next time I make it I will substitute traditional Greek seasoning (read: lemon, oregano, garlic) for the dill (Penzeys makes a good Greek blend) and go with half and half instead of cream.

This went well as a side dish to Greek salad. No, this is not a classic (read: overladen with artery clogging cheeezy, cream sauce) macaroni dish. I liked that it was flavorful and light.

I have made this recipe about 4 times to go with lamb kebobs, and a Greek salad. I made some changes: I added chicken bouillion to the water instead of a can of chicken broth, used FF cream, and I also added crushed garlic instead of dill. I know, too many changes to compare the recipe, but have to watch the fat. Very good.

I don't know why people are comparing this to mac and cheese. It is not a mac and cheese dish. This is a pasta dish with a great flavor: exciting seasoning, pungent cheeses, and a great compliment to a red meat. I servered it with steak and roasted vegetables. My dinner party loved it. Easy to make and a great taste treat. We didn't even bake it. We mixed the cheese and seasoning with the cooked and drained pasta and served it right away. I was very impressed by this orzo dish and look forward to making it again. One note of caution: one pound of orzo is a heck of a lot of food. I suggest cutting the recipe back for smaller portions. I will have leftovers for days!

I really liked this dish as a side to a flavorful meat entree. The pasta and cheese mixture is not too overpowering. It could stand some spicing up, which I will try next time I make it.

My husband and I love this dish. It's an elegant side dish to accompany a Greek meal and using slightly less feta makes the taste subtle. My Greek friends love it too.

I was skeptical, but I tried this anyway. It just wasn't very interesting. It reminded me more of a rice dish than a pasta dish. In fact, the reason I won't make it again is that I have a recipe for feta risotto that is similar to this but much better. Don't make this if you want a variation of macaroni and cheese- you will be disappointed.

I found this dish really bland. Maybe it could be spiced up a bit? Any suggestions?

I thought the recipe was "fine" but only one of 8 guests liked it. Made it with 3 other mac and cheese dishes and it definitely paled in comparison.

I served this dish to my husband's Greek family to rave reviews. While all of the ingredients are familiar, the combination is new! In my experience, Kasseri cheese is too soft to be successfully grated, therefore I selected Greek Kefalotiri cheese at the local Greek market. While fresh dill would probably been better, dried dill worked fine, too.

Nice, even if kasseri isn't available. Careful if you're serving with Greek shrimp, though, as this is very pungent.

I omitted the whipping cream and it still turned out delicious. I served it with the Greek-style chicken and some steamed broccoli and everyone loved it! I will definitely make it again and again
