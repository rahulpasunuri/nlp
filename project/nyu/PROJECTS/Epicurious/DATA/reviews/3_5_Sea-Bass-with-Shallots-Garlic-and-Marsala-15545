Great flavor for an easy recipe. Didn't change the recipe. Made with 2 6oz Sea Bass fillets so halved the shallots,garlic mixture. I doubled the sauce which I recommend. This is definitely a keeper.

My husband loved this dish. I, however, thought it was just okay. If I were to prepare it again I would use pepitas instead of pinenuts, as I believe an earlier reviewer mentioned. Good - just didn't rock me.

ohmygosh! I followed directions to the letter; delicious and easy. double the sauce, for sure.

I made this with tilapia and served it on a bed of lightly sauteed homegrown spinach and with brown rice. Like others, subbed chicken stock for pricer clam juice - didn't miss the clam juice. Doubling the sauce is crucial. I admit that I chuckled that someone had grabbed the hot handle of the pan after it had come out of the oven and then, even though I'd carefully laid out a pot holder, sure enough I grabbed that handle and burned myself. Beware! Great dish, will make it again.

This is a great recipe exactly as prepared. I have had it both with Sea Bass and Halibut, and guests absolutely rave!!!

The only change I made was to sub cod fillets for the sea bass. Produced an easy, inexpensive and tasty main course.

I haven't really cooked much in my life so I was looking for a dish that would be good for a beginner but tasted gourmet. This was it! My new boyfriend loved it! I will definitely make it again. I followed the recipe almost exactly but I made a little more of the Marsala wine sauce.

I shopped at the last minute, so when the supermarket I went to didn't have bass, I bought frozen orange roughy instead. I also had sherry on hand instead of marsala. Even with these substitutions, the dish was so tasty. I can only imagine how good it will be next time with some fresh chilean sea bass. I will definetely double the sauce next time. It was very good, but sparse. I also put it under the broiler at the very end for less than a minute. It was really delicious.

Wonderful fish dish!! My husband and I loved it! We followed the recipe almost exactly except we could not get fresh sea bass so we used orange roughy. I would not reduce the sauce down too much - we would have liked to have a little more sauce over the fish, but otherwise it was great! Don't skimp on the pine nuts eihter . . . they added a wonderful touch of flavor. Very simple and easy - can't wait to make it for our guests!

I thought this was delicious! I added mushrooms to the shallots and we loved the flavor. Be judicious with the red pepper flakes. A very little goes a long way. I will definitely make this again and perhaps try other mild white fish.

This was fabulous, simply put. Easy, quick, light but so incredibly flavorful. The sweet nuttiness of the marsala and shallots was perfectly complimented with the pine nut topping at the end -- dry sherry would have worked well, or even bourbon. I also highly recommend using oven mitts! I forgot the handles were hot and have blisters to prove it - ouch. Some ice and a glass of cold chard and I still LOVED this dish, as did my hubby. Company-worthy for sure. I can't wait to make it again, as we love chilean sea bass, although I would also make it with tilapia or red snapper or any firm white fish.

This was very delicious- I had to leave out the clam juice, didn't have any. It still turned out wonderful.

I made this for the two of us and used the full amount of sauce, which was just adequate. If I were making it for 4 people, I would double the sauce. I had first quality Chiliean sea bass to work with and that makes a difference. It is a wonderful recipe and I didn't change much. I did use just a bit less Marsala and a bit more clam juice but other than that, I followed the recipe. The shallots and Marsala complement the fish perfectly. We will have this over and over, I'm sure.

This was so easy and delicious. I marinated the fish in the shallot mixture for about 30 minutes to empart additional flavor. Also I used a high quality Marsala wine in the sauce- very rich and flavorful.

Incredible! This was so tasty and better yet, so easy... Like the last reviewer, my sea bass took 15+ minutes in the oven (and I hate overcooked fish). I doubled the sauce and served this over a bed of orzo. Beautiful presentation. Will definitely make this for any guests I want to impress--

This was really delicious. I used alittle over a pound of sea bass and made the whole amount of sauce...we liked having the extra sauce. I found it took more like 20 minutes to cook in the oven and other than that I followed the recipe exactly. This is definitely one of the better sea bass recipes I've tried.

I used halibut instead of sea bass and substituted a tablespoon of dijon mustard for the vinegar. The result was good enough to serve for guests and fast enough for a weeknight meal. I think I will try this preparation with halibut cheeks when the season comes around.

Our local Costco now sells Chilean Sea Bass (frozen) in individual servings. I cooked this and served it with wild rice. I thought it was an excellent dish; easy prep, easy cooking. The fish turned out beautifully.

It also great with cod. Replaced clam juice w/ vegetable broth cube.

I took the suggestions of some viewers and made some adjustments myself, and voila, this dish is delicious! Here is exactly what I did: (1) Cut the amount of fish and spices in half (for two people) but left the amount of sauce as is. I substituted dry marsala with a quarter cup of marsala wine. Note, do not overdoze with marsala wine because its flavor is pretty strong. I also took the suggestion of one viewer and used some heavy cream as described below. (2) Season the seabass with a little salt and a generous amount of black pepper. (3) Sautee seabass in olive oil till it's done. Then sautee the shallot, garlic and crushed red pepper mix till it becomes flavorful. Next, pour in marsala wine, clam juice and white wine vinegar. Finally pour in about 1/5 to 1/4 cup of heavy cream and wait till the mixture thickens to a very smooth texture. (3) Pour the whole thing over seabass. Serve with Carolina saffron yellow rice mix and vegetables. This was one of the best!

Easy and delicious. I made 2 servings of fish (tilapia) but made the entire recipe of sauce, and it was just enough. It is so light and tasty, and easy to do after work. I served it with asparagus glazed with some of the marsala and butter, and brown rice. Very nice.

This is the first time that I have cooked sea bass. This recipe is deee-lish! I made a few changes, though. First I seared the fish in olive oil (skin side down first) and kept it warm under foil in the oven. Next I sauteed the shallots garlic and pepper in the same pan, adding the liquids after a few minutes. I added the cream as this mixture reduced to get a velvety texture. Pour sauce over the fish, sprinkle with pine nuts and voila! A masterpiece!

My dad made this recipe for me the first time I had it and it was sooo good I literally prayed to God in bed that night with complete reverence for having been so fortunate to each such a dish! I later tried it myself for some friends and used a chardonnay and fresh grouper (my father also used grouper, it was amazing) and doubled the sauce amount and still could have maybe made even more as my guests raved about it and would have liked extra I think (however my father's cooking was even more delicious! His was a definate 4 forks!) Overall it is a fantastic, easy to prepare entree, a definate crowd pleaser!

Neither my husband nor I liked this at all. The sauce totally overpowers the fish. I love chicken or veal marsala, but just didn't like it with fish. Obviously, however, we are in the minority on our opinion.

This was the first time I had prepared Sea Bass. I found it to be perfect! The sauce did not overpower the delicate flavour of the fish. I followed anothers suggestion to add butter at the reducing stage and it was delicious. I served with Saffron Orzo and green bean bundles.

A great dinner party entree, easy to prepare and cooks quickly. (I entertained 8 people).I used all suggested ingrediants and found the shallots (6) had alot of waste - only about 1/2 went onto fish when baked. I drained the balance of pan sauce off, & discarded the shallots. Also, suggest baking for time suggested, then slide fish under broiler till shallots/fish browned slightly. After fish is baked, much easier to de- bone as well.

I made this a while back. Tasty and easy.

This is great, but I'd like to make some comments. I think onions would be just fine and less expensive than the shallots (which I did use). I also think if you have everything except the clam juice, don't make a special trip to the store, just use chicken broth. Good fish makes a real difference here, and the pine nuts are wonderful. I used sherry instead of marsala and would use more liquor next time. I'd also stir in a bit of butter at the final reducing stage just to give it a little extra richness. But this is a very nice recipe.

I used chilean sea bass for this recipe. It was absolutely delicious. It was easy and would be a great company dinner. The pine nuts were a perfect addition.

I'm always a little skeptical when a recipe is rated 3.5 forks but this recipe definitely deserves it! I followed someone's advice about making the full amount of garlic and shallots for one pound of chilean sea bass. Unfortunately my stove broke before I could make the marsala sauce, so I wasn't able to reduce it but ended up spooning some on the fish anyway. I served it with the Risotto Milanese recipe and steamed asparagus. YUMMY!!!

Wow! What a dish!! Best Sea Bass I've ever eaten. I was making dinner for a special friend and myself so I only cooked a pound of fish (which was way more than enough) but I did follow the advice of others and used the whole amount of shallots, marsala and other ingredients called for in the recipe and I'm glad I did... the sauce was HEAVEN! This was a winner!!

I agree with everyone- great dish. I used Angler fish (monkfish) which required sl. longer roasting. Next time I would probably make more sauce- really delicious and not really enough to go around.

Very nice way to prepare Sea Bass, and really simple. I had dinner on the table in 45 mintues, start to finish. The recipe would probably also work well with halibut, swordfish, or any other firm flesh mild fish. This recipe is quite similar to a chicken dish in Penelope Casas' book - Foods & Wines of Spain, so you could probably use this recipe for chicken as well, which makes it pretty versatile and why I gave it 4 forks. Not to mention it tastes good. I used Sherry instead of Marsala as well since I had it on hand and prefer Sherry to the sweetness of Marsala. The Sherry gave it a very soft, subtle flavor that complimented the fish and the pine nuts really well.

This was great! I did make a number of modifications though. I used half salmon and half sea bass. I grilled the fish and then added the sauce at the end. I also added mushrooms and had to substitute chicken soup for the clam sauce. This worked well with the dark grained nutty rice and grilled asparagus that I served with it. It was also really easy and would be a great company dish.

Wonderful, elegant dish. The marsala and shallots work beautifullly together. I had to substitute chicken broth, but next time will use the clam broth for sure.

Rating: 3
Terrific and easy! I agree ... the mushrooms are a great addition ... next time I will double the amount of sauce so there is extra to pass. I think I'll also coarsely chop the toasted pine nuts instead of leaving them whole, and throw on some chopped parsley before serving.

Good and easy to make recipe. I added mushrooms as was suggested by one reviewer and liked it that way. I probably was a little heavy handed on the red pepper flakes and I will be more careful next time. The heat from the red pepper took away from the overall enjoyment of the dish.

Wonderful flavors! I made some substitutions and an addition. No shallots, used thin sliced onions instead; also used chicken broth instead of clam juice. The addition was mushrooms, making it more like a marsala. The result was really delicious.
