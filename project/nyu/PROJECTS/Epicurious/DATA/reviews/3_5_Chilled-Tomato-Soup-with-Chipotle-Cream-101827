A lovely summer take-to-work lunch soup, and a good change from gaspacho :)

This soup was great! It had great spice - it hits you different places on your tongue with the horseradish, chili and then black pepper. My local store was out of jalapenos, so I used a serrano instead and it still turned out great. I made a big batch so I can freeze some - I'll definitely be making this again!

Last of the year garden tomatoes made this fab. I substituted some tomato sauce and water for the tomato juice which was fine. I served it warm since it was cold out :) NOTE: you *must* run this through a course sieve to get rid of the skins.

This soup was delicious. I did add a tiny bit of sugar to sweetening it. The chipotle cream was wonderful. 5 people, most of who are not big fans of chilled soups, loved it.

We winced with every bite. Entirely too intense and bitter - we much prefer soothing soups.

I truly enjoyed this soup. Great flavor and spicy hot.

I often make this recipe as an appetizer for my family gatherings. Many of my relatives are vegetarians & my husband loves chilled soups. I make two chiptole creams, one more spicy so that everyone can season the soup to their liking. It's always a big hit.

I thought this was a very refreshing, yet rich soup for summer. It was a big hit; different from gazpacho and the chipotle cream was a nice touch of heat.

Had to mix the chipotle cream through the soup completely because the soup alone just seemed to be lacking something.

This was a huge success last night at our Gourmet Club dinner! I wouldn't do a thing differently!

I subbed a #2 can of whole tomatoes, a toasted/rehydrated dried chipotle for the jalapeno, and sprinkled a tablespoon of chopped cilantro on top of each serving. Made the crema sans chipotle with buttermilk/sour cream swirled in with a toothpick. Raves from my guests. Make a bunch, it's a great leftover for you!

Loved this soup--the horseradish is a nice touch. And the chipotle cream is divine. I used V-8 juice in place of plain tomato juice for more flavor. Makes a very refreshing summertime dish.
