I marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts, then grilled. Results: moist, mild flavor. Not a "wow", but decent.

Wonderful recipe. I used chicken cutlets and cut them into strips. And instead of poultry seasoning, I used dried oregano. I marinated for 4 hours since the strips were thinner than chicken parts. My kids ate every last bit!

On a cold NJ spring evening, this was a welcomed glimpse of summer. Easy, delicious and little boys ate it all (no small feat). I'd also serve for company with a gutsy side (for spice fans).

My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this chicken. The flavour was lovely and it was relatively easy to prepare.

Delicious. The marinade is really easy to make, my boyfriend and I grilled this with veggies and loved it. Very flavorful and easy.

This was easy and my husband and I both found it very tasty. I used chicken leg quarters with skin, which I think is important to the flavor. I did not measure all the ingredients. I made about half the marinade recipe. I used the zest from a whole large lemon and all its juice, plus a little juice from part of another lemon to make up 1/4 cup. I guessed at the salt -probably put in more than 1/2 the recipe. Didn't have poultry seasoning so just added some sage and thyme, didn't have white pepper so just shook in some black pepper. Didn't even marinate it long - maybe half an hour? Then my husband grilled it and it was DELISH!! I think I put in extra salt and probably extra lemon zest, and that might have pepped it up a bit from the standard recipe. You can overdo the salt, but I think it's hard to overdo the lemon flavor. So I'd recommend squirting on extra lemon if you're afraid it will be a bit bland.

This was fantastic. I used adobo seasoning which enhanced the citrus flavor nicely. I will definitely make this again because it was so easy to make.

I just finished grilling this recipe, using both lemon zest and juice (on half of the chicken) and orange zest and juice (on the other half of the chicken). The marinade is super easy to make. The orange and lemon flavors came through favorably, however the overall flavor is lacking something. I won't go so far as to say the flavor was bland, but this recipe definitely needs some UMPHH. I had 6 friends over for dinner, and all had the same input. Maybe some roasted red peppers, finely ground or even some cayenne added to the marinade? I don't think I would try the chiles just yet. Have you ever experimented with added some kick to this recipe? If so, what were your results?

My only deviation from the orig recipe was that I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, rather than a whole chicken. And lacking a grill of any kind (or even a yard for that matter) I cooked them in the oven. The end result was BORING, dry chicken without a whole lot of flavor. Perhaps this is one of those recipes best suited to its orig purpose: a whole chicken with the skin (for fat & flavor) + the searing heat of an outdoor grill. Otherwise, there are far better chicken marinades in the world for plain breasts than this one.

I tried this last night and was very impressed. I rated it 4 forks based on the ease of preparation, the small number of ingredients involved (some marinades are complicated *and* expensive), and the light, fresh taste. I used boneless, skinless breast halves and marinated about 5 hours. The amount of lemon taste was perfect. I served with potato salad, sliced tomatoes and toasted French bread. It's not the best thing I've ever tasted, but it was really good - I'd easily serve it to company. Great easy dish.

Its very good on the grill and my kids asked for seconds. This is the moistest chicken I have had on the grill, so I'll make it again. I felt the lemon flavor was too weak, probably because I used a Meyer lemon from my backyard tree and the Meyers have a more subtle flavor. I'll double the lemon next time.

Made this using some modifications - most importantly, used chicken breasts as I didn't have a whole chicken on hand. I marinated overnight and it was probably the best grilled chicken I've ever had. Moist, tender, and very flavorful. We're making it again tonight!

This one is gorgeous, and though we had it last summer, i'm looking forward to the weather heating up again here so I can make it once more. We don't have a grill unfortunately, so had to go with the grill pan and oven option. It still was yummy and fresh and the lemon flavor really held its own. Serving with potato salad is a good idea, but we also had a great cherry tomato, yellow pepper and green bean salad drizzed with a rosemary and basil infused olive oil that was fantastic too.

We made this for Father's Day (because you have to grill on FD, but my dad doesn't love red meat) and it was yummy, yummy, yummy. The recipie is easy and fast... we marinaded overnight and I probably wouldn't do it for any less next time. Enjoy!!

My family LOVED this recipe and it was an easy make-ahead dish for me. It also taught me how to cook chicken with skin well on my grill. My husband actually asked me if I'd fried it!

Made it for a BBQ party. We all liked it a lot! The lemen taste was very distinct without being too strong. I expect the amount of zest will have a strong effect. I had a full tablespoon but didn't compact it so I didn't have as much as there could have been. I used a ziploc bag for the marinating to avoid leaching any odd flavors from the container. I used a gas grill. My understanding is that using coals with lighter fluid or self-starting briquettes can result in unpleasant tastes. As a BBQ novice I especially appreciated the detailed guidance on what to do.

I usually do not rate recipes. And I usually do not modify them. However, I am doing both to this recipe. My whole family loved this recipe!! The marinade was great!! Several weeks ago we tried beer-can chicken and found this cooking method to be the easiest way to cook chicken on the grill. You just put it on the grill and do not have to turn it or check on it. With this recipe I made the marinade exactly as stated. But, I used a whole chicken. I put some of the marinade under the skin of both the breasts and thighs. When it was time to cook, I drained the marinade from the chicken and then poured the excess marinade into an empty beer can with 2 additional holes punched in the top. I then filled the beer can with beer to 3/4 full. Then I placed the chicken on the beer can and grilled over indirect heat for about 45 minutes for a 3.5 pound chicken. It was incredibly tasty, and incredibly easy. I will be using the beer-can method with all the grilled chicken recipes from now on. I can't wait to try this method with my other favorite marinades.

Big hit with my entire family tonight. The grilling took a long time on a gas grill, but so worth it! Although, the chicken was delicious (especially the skin!) I could barely taste any lemon! I marinated it for 24 hours in a ziploc bag, turning it occasionally. Real keeper, I used very large split chicken breasts and drumsticks.

This is a keeper. I used boneless, skinless breasts, but am sure it would be excellent with chicken pieces too. It gave a nice crispy crust and a great lemon flavor. Very easy. My marinade didn't get really thick though, just foamy--but it did emulsify.

I have made this twice - we love it, so simple and very tasty (I use olive oil).

This was fairly good but nothing special. Made with boneless-skinless chicken breasts grilled on gas BBQ. Tender and moist with a nice lemon tang but found they had a peculiar and bitter after-taste. Perhaps my lemons were especially sour? Made chicken salad sandwiches with the leftovers the next day and must admit they were very tasty. All in all, a decent recipe but don't think I will make it again.

Made this recipe with boneless, skinless chicken breasts which marinated for 8 hours. The chicken was very good, it was moist, had a nice flavor, and everyone enjoyed it.

My friends raved about this recipe! I also added some fresh lemon thyme to the marinade to increase the flavor. I seared the chicken in an iron skillet and then cooked as directed for 20 min in the oven. It was moist and flavorful. I added only 1/2 the salt and increased the pepper. This would be great to make ahead of time to take on a picnic or to the beach.

Very good. The flavor of the chicken is not smothered by any strong flavors-just a nice hint of lemon. I would make this again also because it is so quick to make the marinade in the morning.

I haven't rated this yet because I haven't tried it, but reading the existing comments, I have to say, Whoa. We're talking about food here right, not politics. Lighten up, people. This is one of the spots I have to escape from conflict.

This recipe was great, and I would make it again. It caught my eye because without the lemon it bears a strong resemblance to Cornell Barbecue Sauce invented in 1946 by Dr. Bob Baker of Ithaca, NY. In western New York, that recipe is synonymous with grilled chicken. The addition of lemon gives it a nice zing.

Once again Fairfield, CT, where is YOUR review? Stop policing and start reviewing. I didn't have enough time to marinate the chicken this time around, but it was still delicious. Can only imagine how good it will be the next time I make it.

I used additional juice because Meyer lemons are milder, and olive oil. Have no idea the point to the egg.....seems like one could just add lemon and herbs to mayo. Personnally prefer a nice lemon marinade. Wouldn't bother with this messy and not very exciting recipe again.

cook from CT... yes you can use boneless breasts. My father uses a marinade like this , but adds a splash of vinegar. I marinade overnight ans that seems to keep the chicken nice and moist. This is a great grilling recipe

This was very easy and delicious. I used a kosher chicken and marinated overnight. The only change I made was to use less salt, since kosher chickens are already a little salty. Tasty and very moist.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I had it for a company dinner and our guests raved about it. I quartered a chicken and marinated it for over 24 hours which really enhanced the lemon flavor. I also cooked it on cast iron grill in the kitchen with a weight on the sections. It was somewhat messy, but I will make this over and over and have shared it with many family members and friends.

Oh, also Penelope, mayo makes a really nice crisp crust. I cook for a living and a friend of mine was over to my house one day and asked to make a grilled cheese sandwich. I told him sure. He proceeded to thinly spread mayonaise instead of butter on the bread and I asked if he was friggen NUTS?!? He just smiled and said to watch. Anyway, the sandwich came out very nice and when I thought about it I could see that mayo is basically just egg yolks and olive oil with a little lemon juice and salt. I know, there is whole egg mayo and mayo with vinegar...but ANYWAY, the mayo made a very nice and CRISP grilled cheese, so I would imagine the above recipe would turn out very nicely indeed :) Slow cooking as suggested is the key. Brining the chicken isn't necessary....in fact it is one too many steps for grilled chicken. I am not saying it wouldn't be a good idea, but brining is generally reserved for tougher/dryer cuts of meat and a good old American fryer/roaster will NOT be tough. Save the brining for your Thanksgiving turkey :)

Hey Ms. Dallas, It sounded a bit rude with your "affect/effect" correction and her name is Penelope not Penelopeb! Chill out!

Penelopeb: The egg is a powerful emulsifier, which will bind the oil and liquid in the marinade and help keep them from separating. You wouldn't need it but for the oil in the marinade. You don't have scrambled eggs hanging off your pancakes or waffles, or in your ceasar dressing, for the same reason. And it's "affect," not "effect." Oh, and always brine that chicken first. Given the acid in the marinade, I'd suggest about a 12 hour brine followed by the same duration marinade.

No, Penelope......the oil, egg, and lemon etc.. are just mayonaise. Nothing more, nothing less. The lemon zest is really the only difference...well, there IS a whole lot of lemon juice, too...but just the same, this is just a mayo recipe with added spice :)

This is not a comment on the recipe - but rather a QUESTION: wouldn't the egg effect the marinate in some way? I can only imagine the chicken would have scrambled egg hanging off it????? Smart cooks please advise
