This is absolutely delicious! It tastes so special, you'd think it was time-consuming to make. So EASY - I highly recommend it.

This is a long-standing favorite in our house--especially for the cook as it is extraordinarily easy given the return on flavor. I am surprised more haven't tried it, I have used it for years as a last-minute dessert, but also to impress guests. Baked bananas do indeed have a very deep flavor that constrasts so well with the glaze of (good quality) bitter orange marmalade.

Very tasty and couldn't be easier! Fresh taste with almost liqueur-like overtones (baked bananas?) This made a lovely finish to a Thai meal on a cold, snowy night in Chicago. Wanted something fruity but somehow fresh mangos and sorbet wasn't right in those temperatures. Admitted change (alert substitution police): I thought that jar in the back of the fridge was marmalade but it was apricot jam - added 1/2 t. lemon juice to the glaze for some acid. Do cut the bananas on a diagonal and layer for visual appeal.

I loved this dessert and so did everyone else! I made the tarts a little smaller than the recipe suggested, and they were still very filling. I also topped them with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. mmm... might try with apples next time. i loved the way the glaze turned out.

This is a simple, delicious dessert. I substituted crescent roll dough for the phyllo, and it was so easy. Serve with vanilla ice cream on top. My guests thought I was Martha Stewart!
