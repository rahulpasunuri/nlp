If you like chocolate, these cookies are the best. These were the favorite out of 10 different cookies using chocolate chips. I will make these for Valentine gifts to give to friends and family.

These cookies are quite good, chocolaty and rich. I originally sought out the recipe because of the mocha filling, but it's tricky. The cookies slide all over the place. I made the cookies twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, however I thought the cookies were a wee bit too sweet. So, on the second round, I lessened the amount of sugar. I used 1/2 Cup powdered sugar in the filling. Then 1/2 Cup brown sugar and 6 oz chocolate chips in the cookie. Also, I ran out of all purpose flour, so I substituted wheat flour (however, I prefer the all purpose in this recipe). The reduction in sugar and chips was perfect. Also, I highly recommend making the mocha filling, it's delicious even if it is a little too saucy.

OMG..... These are unbelievable! Full disclosure: I goofed up the filling: Did not have cream so I used skim milk.... I should have known better, but did it anyway. The filling came out grainy and very soft. I refrigerated it, whipped it up the next day in the mixer: still not good. Added a bunch more powdered sugar, but then it was too, too sweet, so I added a bunch more instant coffee powder to counteract the sweetness, and a pinch of salt. Perfect, and wonderful with the cookies. I cut them in half to make little half-moon cookies. Love, love, love them. They should be listed in the top ten cookie recipes on this web site.

AMAZING!! Made these exactly as recipe says. They were delicious, I had no issues with the filling and thought it was an ease to make. I'll follow the advice of the previous reviewers and add some extra flour next time as these were a little on the flat side. They were so rich I'm not sure they need to be any bigger :)

I just wrote a review, see below. I wanted to add this: I baked these cookies to sell in my baking business. That is why I made them so large. We sell big 4 oz. cookies - family sized. I just read through all the reviews and decided that I will decrease the cream in the filling instead of adding more powdered sugar. This way I won't lose all the flavah! These cookies will make you a chocolate lover! I can't imagine them without the filling! One person wrote that she piped the filling on top of the cookie and then sprinkled them with graham crackers Why not sprinkle them with their own crumbs? I loved the idea about presenting them on a platter lined with coffee beans! There are some incredibly creative cooks on this site! :-)

These cookies are the bomb! I, too, increased the flour. The dough is very stiff. I used a scale to make 2 oz. cookies. Then I used a 1 oz. scoop for the filling. I added more powdered sugar to the filling. Otherwise it would have oozed out of the cookie as you bit down. We bake with spelt flour and dehydrated cane sugar juice, which we subbed cup for cup. No problems. The only thing you need to be careful of is DO NOT COOK THEM TOO MUCH. As soon as the tops feel firm and look crackled take them out.

These cookies were really good. I brought them to a party and they disappeared within minutes. The mocha filling was especially tasty.

I just made a double batch of these and they're great. I added the extra flour and refrigerated the dough overnight. The filling recipe was enough for a double cookie recipe. I left out the nuts because of an allergic guest, but I think they would be a wonderful addition. I also made them slightly smaller than suggested with my cookie scooper. They are so rich that I can't see eating anything bigger!

Taking the suggestion of other reviewers, I added 1/4 cup flour to the cookie dough. The dough was very stiff. The cookies turned out like the picture though. It was also suggested to roll the dough into tablespoon sized balls. That works well, but is pretty messy. I ended up with 23 cookies instead of 20. I made the mocha as written and no problem with it being too thin or melting. The taste of the mocha is excellent.

My cookies didn't puff up as much as pictured, but were still awesome. Make sure you completely chill the filling. I adapted this recipe to be gluten-free: http://www.heythatta stesgood.com/2008/10 /chocolate- chocolate-chip- mocha-sandwich.html

I substituted half of the semi-sweet chocolate chips for dark chocolate chips - was just divine. I found I had a lot of filling leftover so next time I would make just about half of the filling asked for in the recipe. A rich and wonderful dessert!

Rating: 4
Taste deserves 5 forks but I had to keep these in the freezer - that way they don't melt and get messy and they are like deliciously rich ice cream sandwiches. Next time I might try making them as thumbprints and piping a little filling into an indented middle to keep it contained. Also, I'd recommend using less cream to thicken the filling like others have commented.

These were very good, cookies were tender and chewy. Based on other reviewers' comments about thin, spreading cookies added another 1/4 cup flour. Did the trick, cookies were perfect, looked just like the photo.

I made these for a bake sale and everyone loved and hated them (heartattack) BUT the cookies came out too flat. Can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong? The frosting is great and i used regular coffee cause it is for a group of caffine addicts in my office. it is too soft though- i frosted them and kept them in the fridge... ideas? jeniyo@hotmail.com

I haven't made the filling yet but the cookies are amazing! I added a drop of extra flour, since people said it was too sticky. I also rolled the cookies in my hands into balls so they would come out uniform for the sandwiches. They look more professional this way than dropping them with the spoon.

Easy to make and a tasty hit. Two pointers: Tip # 1: Use decaf coffee grounds or you and the kids will be up for a week. Tip # 2: For a real "wow" from your guests, arrange cookies on a white serving plate atop a pool of coffee beans. Extra special tip: Drizzle the tops and bottoms of cookies with the filling and then shake in a bag with crushed graham crackers. Just what the recipe needed for texture and appeal. Have fun!

The cookies didn't hold their shape at all - they turned into flat thin crisps, despite following the recipe exactly. I put the second batch in the refrigerator before cooking them, thinking that the butter was too warm, causing the flat-cookie effect, but it didn't help much. What did I do wrong?

these coockies are really good. I replaced 1 tbsp of reg unsweetened cocoa powder with dark cocoa powder. and only used half a stick of butter and 1/4 cup of canola oil. that actually make the cookie puff up more.

These cookies were great, and my husband said they're the best cookies I've ever made. They are a little large though when they're sandwiched together, so I cut all the sandwiches in half to make the servings a bit smaller.

The cookie itself was really great, but I wouldn't add the mocha cream filling again. I think it was just to much for the type of cookie it is.

I was worried that these would be too crunchy when I took them out of the oven, but upon cooling they're quite light and crispy. Extremely rich at the same time, too, though. I only put in half the chocolate chips in the batter because I was using mini chips, it's still plenty of chocolate, believe me. The filling doesn't hold them together like the recipe suggests they should, but it's definitely good. And I think it's necessary to offset the crispiness of the cookie. Delicious. Might try adding orange next time. or more coffee. I can taste it in the filling but not in the cookie.

Rating: 0
These were great! Didn't look too much like the picture, though, because they flattened out considerably. I used spelt flour instead of regular, and since I don't like chunks of nuts in cookies, I used ground hazlenuts to replace the pecans. Given the comments about the filling, I reduced the cream by half; it keeps a nice consistency that way, and still tastes great. Even with the size reduced to a teaspoon, they end up being about an inch and a half in diameter, so one sandwich is a lot of cookie!

Anyone who isn't a certified chocoholic may not be able to eat more than a bite. But even chocoholics may have trouble eating more than one "sandwich". While very delicious (and sweet), this recipe posed one major challenge. I followed others' advice and made teaspoon-size cookies. I also cut back on the chips (just a little over a cup) and omitted the nuts. I tried a couple cookies straight out of the oven and thought they were delish. I made the filling and chilled it for a half hour. After I put it on two cookies and topped the filling with cookies, the filling melted and the top cookies slid off. My kitchen may be warmer than your average kitchen but it's not 90 degrees. I chilled the cookies and filling for a while longer and managed to assemble most of the sandwiches before meltage recurred but now realize I will not be able to take these to work -- unless hours of chilling makes a big difference, they will fall apart in minutes. Make sure you have a cooler if you need to take these anywhere. I don't have one.

I have made these cookies several times and always get asked for the recipe. I have made them as a gift and also just brought them into work as they are the perfect acompaniment to a morning cup of java. I used walnuts instead of pecans and made smaller cookies. These are very rich. Definitely keep chilled otherwise the fillings melts and gets very messy. Tastes better when chilled and the filling is more mouselike.

Very, VERY good. I made the filling but decided not to use it. The cookies are great by themselves. Threw in some butterscotch chips I had on hand; they added great contrast to the choc chips. Even better next day.

Delicious (without the filling)! I liked how the coffee enhanced the bittersweet chocolate, the texture was nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The lower oven temp was good, I also turn the pan around halfway through baking (my mom does it). The abundance of choc chips is great! My husband is not a cookie monster, but was impressed with this one.

I found these cookies, when made into sandwiches, just disgustingly sweet. I could only manage about 1/2 a sandwich. My boyfriend, being a trooper, ate a whole one.

As noted by everyone else, these cookies are incredible and pleasantly rich. I did, however, change one thing. I did not do the sandwhich style. Instead, I followed the recipe and used 1 tbs of dough to have the larger cookie. I then took the filling and piped a zig-zag design across the top of the cookie. Unfortunately, I have a hard time eating just one. These cookies are addictive! Enjoy!

Really delicious and easy. Left out coffee from both filling and cookies (kids...), but still great. Consistencies exactly as they should be; I agree with dropping dough by teaspoon (not Tblsp.). Had extra filling so put a dollop on top of each cookie - pretty. I think I would double recipe next time. Highly recommended recipe

Loved these cookies! I have a boss that is the worst chocohalic ever and he is always challenging me to come up with chocolate dessert recipes. Well, I think I have found the ultimate recipe. He LOVED these cookies and so did everyone else. Thanks for the suggestion on dropping the batter by 1 teaspoon onto the cookie sheets. The smaller cookie looks so much better on a platter then larger ones. And besides that they are so rich in this case smaller is better. Also, I piped the filling using a star tip making it much easier and it looked nicer than just spreading the filling. Difinetly serve them chilled for best flavor.

i cannot recommend these cookies enough! a definite recipe for chocolate lovers. I had no problems with the recipe, but the only thing i can suggest is to make sure when you drop the cookies onto the pan to use only a teaspoonful of the dough (otherwise you'll end up with giant cookie sandwiches). oh and definately make the filling- it's one of the best parts of the cookie.

To the cook from Southwest Washington: To prevent cookies from flattening out during baking, try to chill the dough first.

Absolutely fantastic! Other reviewers wrote that these cookies were too rich and some didn't use the filling. I wanted the filling, so I left the chocolate chips out of the cookies - I didn't miss them at all. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. They are still incredibly rich, though. One thing, I used my cookie dough scoop and the dough spread a great deal so I ended up with extremely flat cookies about 4-5 inches in diameter (was it supposed to spread that much?). Two of those with the filling would be too much, so I cut each cookie in half and ended up with half-circle sandwiches. Eat one with a glass of milk or a small dish of vanilla ice cream - heaven! P.S. I think my baking soda might have gone bad. Bought some new so I'll try it with that.

These are great cookies. The chocolate and the nuts are a great combo with the mocha flavor. Definitely make sure the filling is chilled before putting it on the cookies, even if it's a little stiff, otherwise it gets messy and the cookies slide off of each other. Also, make sure to serve the cookies chilled, so they're a bit more solidifed, but overall, an excellent cookie.

These are soooo good. A little labor intensive, but they are a special cookie---not your everyday cookie! I would make these again for company. I too had too much filling left over, so next time I will double the cookies and keep the amount of filling the same.

An excellent cookie recipe - I had trouble just keeping my fingers out of the batter. These cookies are super rich. As others have suggested, try spooning them by 1/2 TBS rather than fulls. It's difficult, but a smaller cookie would be better suited.

They are very good, although the preparation process was a little bit messy. For the next time I won't prepare that much filling, I still have more than half of it in the fridge and I don't know what to do with it!. Probably next time I would try using nutella instead of the mocha filling.

These cookies are FANTASTIC! I would suggest, like the other reviewer, that you use a 1/2 Tbs measurement for the cookies or they turn out to big. Also, when I make these again (which I will) I'm going to add 6 oz (1/2 bag) of chocolate chips. 12oz kind of overwhelm the cookie. These are magnificent!

Well, I guess there's always one, and today it's me... but I thought these cookies were just too hard after being refrigerated, and mine didn't flatten out much, so to bite through the sandwich, it's just too hard. The filling now though, OH MY WORD!!!!! this would be awesome as the filling of a cake. It does make more than you need for the cookies. Over all though I won't make these again. I also thought they were just too sweet. Kinda sends you into sugar shock. Oh yeah, I used Bakers chocolate chunks, which could be part of the thickness and hardness problem. Maybe choc chips would be fine.

Incredible! I typically don't like mocha flavored desserts, but these were quite amazing. Definitely serve them cold! I didn't have any filling left over, go figure...I did use a very small ice cream scoop for the dough so maybe I did more smaller cookies which took more filling? They were the perfect size though.

To be honest--these were too rich for me. I felt that the amounts used for the filling could be cut in half. I ended up throwing away a lot of the filling--however, I took these to a party and before I could turn around they were gone. My teenagers could not believe that I didn't make enough for us at home.

These are, hands down, the best chocolate chip cookies ever. The cream filling should NOT be omitted, but you might want to keep a few cookies un-creamed because it is RICH. Also--take care to bake long enough so they don't fall apart when you attempt to sandwich them up.

These cookies were delicious and very rich. I could eat them everyday! The coffee gives them an adult taste. My kids (4,6, and 8, certified chocoholics) weren't crazy about them due to the coffee. But all the adults loved them. I left out the nuts because my husband doesn't like nuts in his desserts. If you heap your spoons when dropping then the cookies should be dropped with a heaping teaspoon rather than a tablespoon. They got too big during the cooking time and took longer to cook. Also, I got 34 instead of 40 cookies. Yummy and I will make again for sure.
