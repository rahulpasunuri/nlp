My absolute favorite sweet potato recipe - I've been making it for about 5yrs now. Only thing I'd pass on is to eat it all when you serve it. It does not make a good leftover.

We loved this side dish. We made it all in one pan with no problem, using jar garlic and very thin onion. Added fresh rosemary and cheese as directed at the end. Very easy to make after work with left over sweet potatoes-took less than an hour.

Really good and easy. Put it in the oven just before started serving appetizers for my dinner party and it was just perfect in time for main entree.

I'd cut wayyyy back on the salt. Mine came out too salty even though I used only 2tsp of salt. I'll try only 1 tsp next time and add more after it's done if needed. Taste was great...complex w/ the roasted onions and rosemary. Also cooked using duck fat instead of olive oil for a double whammy :-) I mixed the sweet potatoes and onions together...no problem with them getting dry at all w/ the fat and onions sweating juices in the pan. I actually had a hard time getting crusty skins on the sweet potatoes so ended up cooking it at 400F half the time (45min so more than recommended already) and even fired up the broiler for a few minutes.

I made this recipe for my annual Thanksgiving dinner with family and friends, here in Holland. Since some guest had never eaten sweet potatoes, it was exciting to see what they thought. They liked the taste of this recipe. It is a lovely savory dish, that appealed to all. I must admit I did read the reviews and took some of the comments to heart. I just roasted the sweet potatoes and the onions together. I also added the rosemary prior to roasting. Lastly it did take a little longer to cook than stated, so I added an additional 10 minutes on baking time. I highly recommend this dish.

Good flavours but the sweet potatoes became very dry as they sat for about 30 minutes before serving.

I followed this exactly. After many years of searching for a savory sweet potato recipe, I think this might be The One.

Very good, but I needed to double the roasting time for the onions to really get them going. Also, the potatoes got overcooked before reaching a nice gold color so I broiled them quickly at the end to firm them up with some crust. Overall the recipe was very simple and very good.

I had a recipe similar to this last year that I can't find now :( The recipe I had, had you put the cooked ingredients into a puff pastry cut like a studel. It was amazing as I'm sure this dish must be. If I can't find last years recipe I'll try this one in the puff.

I loved the flavors of this dish. I roasted the onions for close to an hour though, and they still weren't quite soft enough for me. Next time I might try caramelizing them in a saute pan rather than roasting, or using halved or quartered shallots instead.

I so surprised others didn't love this recipe- it's one of my favorites and it always gets excellent reviews from friends and family. I have simplified the process a little by only using sweet potatoes and putting all the ingredients into one baking dish at the same time- then bake it all for about 40 minutes- the potatoes really get infused with the rosemary this way.

Everyone raved about this recipe. It was very good. Only downside is for some reason, it doesn't taste as good reheated. The garlic becomes too strong the next day or something.

Of all the Thanksgiving dishes I made last year, this one has been on my mind the whole year. We devoured the leftovers! The only note I have is that the recipe as is makes about 10 servings. It can be easily reduced by half.

This will be a staple side dish when my Vegan daughter in-law visits. I like that it has a fried hash brown taste, without the last minute prep. I upped the temp. to 400 degrees when baking. I also did not use the cheese or the rosemary, I made this with the slow cooked hoisin pork roast (modified) also from this site.........Good recipes!

Made this as part of our New Year's Eve dinner with the following changes: I used one pan, a 9"x13" glass dish; cut the sweet potatoes ( I only had the orange kind) into cubes about 1/2" to 3/4", chopped the onion, 4 cloves garlic, sprinkled on salt and black pepper, drizzled on light olive oil, gave it all a good stir and popped it into the middle of the oven. I turned the vegetables a couple of times during cooking and then after about 30 minutes I added chopped fresh rosemary for the last 10 minutes. I split the dish into two bowls, one was served as-is and to the other I added parm.-reggiano cheese and dried cranberries. They were both great. Hubby said he could eat it/them every day and thought the one with cheese and cranberries tasted more "festive". I have a slight preference for the one without cheese and cranberries. Because we liked it so much I made it again last night with sweet potatoes, yellow onions, and added carrots and russet potatoes...still good!

Great dish!! Really hits the spot without being too heavy. Instead of cutting sweet potatoes into cubes, I washed them and kept skins on, then sliced them into approx 1/4 inch thick slices (a la potato chips), then laid them onto baking sheet. Instead of stirring cube size pieces, just had to turn them over onto other side once, halfway thru roasting in oven. Only thing I would do differently next time is use a little less garlic. The onion, garlic and salt & pepper flavor was enough for me -- didn't have to add the rosemary or parmesan. Definitely a recipe to repeat!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was wonderful. Following the other reviews, I skipped the cheese and the rosemary. I used elephant garlic - almost a whole head - and it was delicious. I doubled the recipe, which extended the cooking time. My only problem was that the red onions did not brown or carmelize. I think that I had too many in the pan and they ended up "steaming" rather than really roasting. But that aside, it was delicious; a great change from the sugar/candied sweet potato dishes. I will definately make this again.

I love this recipe and have made it for three years running for my family on Thanksgiving. It's a nice alternative to super-sweet dishes like souflee and sweet potatoes with marshmallows, and very easy to do. I find that if you check on the orange potatoes you can prevent them from getting too mushy, and I wouldn't skip the rosemary and cheese-they're what give the dish such a unique flavor. Adjust them to taste, but take a risk and try them. My only tip would be to lessen the oil a bit to prevent the dish from getting greasy. Yum!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but based on the reviews I think I will. I get a cold sweet potato salad from Wild Oats that has the same ingredients WITH dried cranberries? I am wondering how they'd go with the warm potatoes? I'd add them when finished roasting. Just a thought.

I've made this recipe 2 different ways. I'd give the recipe as is a 2 fork rating - I found that the rosemary and cheese overpowered the dish. It's a 4 fork dish for me without those 2 ingredients. I love how the sweet potato and roasted onion flavours meld with the garlic - it's so easy and so delicious! I'd eat the whole thing myself if my husband didn't like it as much as I did!

I just had some Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Caramelized Onions at Whole Foods this weekend and loved the dish. I wanted to try this on my own and was able to search for this recipe. I made this recipe today and absolutely love it. I will definitely make it for Thanksgiving this year. I roasted the Sweet Potatoes (Garnett) for 30 minutes and roasted YELLOW onions for 50 minutes until lightly caramelized (like Whole Foods). I omitted the garlic, rosemary, and cheese because I wanted to taste exactly like how Whole Foods did their sweet potato dish. Well...it tasted exactly the same and now I don't have to spend $5.99/lb. for that dish. After reading the reviews, I will try it the next time with the garlic and rosemary...but not the cheese because I'm using the Garnett variety.

This was awesome! I only had one large sweet potato so I added a regular red potato. It was really quite a hit! I used half the oil, and used extra virgin olive oil instead. It was really quite a hit!

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe several times - keep getting repeat requests, so have made short-cuts. I mix extra-virgin olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper in a plastic bag, toss the sweet potatoes in it, and put the mix onto a cookie sheet into the oven, along with the onions. Works out beautifully, and no great effort involved. But it is very important to remember to use the yellow rather than the deep orange sweet potatoes as the texture of the yellow is firmer - necessary for this recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving and was extremely disappointed. As per the recipe, I roasted the (white) sweet potatoes and red onions 4 hours in advance; they turned an unappealing shade of grey. The dish had way too much salt, black pepper, and rosemary. After the meal, I dumped the leftovers down the garbage disposal. Next year I'll stick with candied yams.

Wonderful recipe and an excellent alternative to the usual ultra-sweet marshmallow topped sweet potato casserole. I followed the advice from previous reviews and cooked everything in the same pan with olive oil. Next time I will make sure the onions are cut to the same size as the potatoes - mine were larger and didn't cook quite as much as I would have liked. Also, I will be sure to have only a single layer on my baking sheet for maximum caramelization. Terrific combination of flavors.

I really like this recipe, more than anything else I've made on this site. I wish I'd taken the use-a-pan-with-sides advice, as the oil dripped off my cookie sheet and the whole house filled with smoke! The only thing I'd do differently is maybe cut the oil almost in half.

This recipe goes over well as a side dish (for my meat-loving friends) or as a main-course offering for all us vegetarians. I found that the onions tend to cook faster than the sweet potatoes, so I waited a little bit longer to add them in.

This was outstanding. The mix of flavors was too tasty for words. I would cut the sweet potatoes smaller and cut down on cooking time 5-10 minutes. And make sure to monitor and turn to help carmelize both veggies.

A wonderful recipe. Definitely a keeper. I added a pinch of sugar to the onions tohelp carmelize them and also threw in some large halved mushrooms to the potatoes when I added the rosemary about 20 minutes before the end. Not necessary but they were a welcome addition.

I agree with the other cooks before me that this is a fabulous recipe. It is extremely easy to make and so very excellent. I used two types of sweet potatoes in my dish for the variety in flavor and color (orange and tawny colored ones). I have already shared this recipe with good friends. Yum!

A great combination of flavors...this is delicious! I chose to use olive oil instead of canola, and I also threw in the rosemary with the potatoes about 10 or 15 minutes before taking them out. I find that it gives a little of the roasted flavor to the rosemary and smooths out what can otherwise be a somewhat overpowering taste...allowing me to use more like two tablespoons of one of my favorite herbs. And, if it's parmesan, make it reggiano! This is a keeper.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving because I love sweet potatoes but I have decided to not eat sweets anymore. Everyone loved it. I did cut down just a bit on the salt and pepper with the idea that I could add more later, but didn't have to. I recommend adjusting the seasoning to your personal taste. I found that the onions took longer to cook than the recipe indicated, but I also cooked them to almost carmelized because I like that flavor. The sweet potato cubes cooked through quickly but were not browned (roasted on the edges) so I raised the temp a bit at the end to brown them a bit. I recommending using a flat spatula to turn the potatoes because they are tender and a spoon can easily bruise them. I had forgotten to buy the fresh rosemary so I crushed some dried rosemary and soaked it in water to soften. I added this and the parmesan cheese just before serving. This recipe is very easy and it is great to be able to make it ahead. I will definitely make it again. It is going in my permanent recipe file.

I made this recipe about 6 hours before serving and it turned out wonderfully. It is an excellent way to reduce the amount of sugar in the traditional Thanksgiving meal. Some people missed the traditional sweet potato dish, but everybody liked this. I used yams instead of sweet potatoes, olive oil, and 2 large red onions. I didn't quite use all of the onion, because I didn't want the onion to overpower the yams. The overall flavor was wonderful, the roasted onions, black pepper, and rosemary were a wonderful combination, yet did not overpower the flavor of the yams. I would recommend using a pan with sides rather than a cookie sheet for roasting. Some of the oil dripped off the sheet.

Used for Thanksgiving-Everyone raved- made a few changes- Used red pearl onions! made a day before. After cooking as recipe called for on sheets I put all together in raosting-casserole pan. Filled 1/2 way added some parm and rosemary then put rest of potatoes and onions on top. Added some savory and sage to taste to make it even more flavorful. Reheated in oven uncovered. Excellent alternative to the syrupy sweet recipes!

I don't like sweet potato or parmesan cheese and there were great. Everyone who ate them remarked how nice it was to eat sweet potato in a different way. Would be a great change from the standard brown sugar and marshmallow glop most of us think when we envision sweet potato. Took a little longer to cook than indicated but not a big deal
