Had this at an Artist Reception last night and it was very good. A lot of other people thought so, too, because it was devoured. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could but 4 is more fair than 3 stars. No, I didn't make it but probably will now that I know about the recipe.

Excellent! A dash of cinnimon sugar and kids will love it. A cook from New Your City! Git a rope!

This is simple and delicious! Sweet and salt is all the rage now and this recipe was around long before all you ignoramuses got to pontificate on something you have not tried or know anything about. As explained to us in Barcelona at a restaurant where we had a superb version of this treat, this recipe dates back to after the war. Spanish mothers desperate to fatten their emaciated children fed them exactly this recipe. Suffice it to say that if in need of a quick sweet fix these are ingredients most of us would have in the pantry and can easily impress with.

To all you nitwits who review recipes without ever having prepared them, just stop! We don't want to hear from you. Save your comments for the recipes you actually prepared. It's a lot more constructive.

A Cook from Milwaukee, Wi - Nutella 'seems' faster? Duh, it's already premade and contains hydrogenated fats.

A Cook from NYC - don't read this site or make anything from it if you are so perfect. Most of the best dishes are simple.

a cook from Long Island - First off, dark chocolate's health benefits are now well established. Olive oil? We all know the health benefits of that luscious foodstuff. Bread? Only been around for a few thousand years helping sustain us and supplying the necessary carbohydrates for energy. What's NOT healthy about this recipe? Plus, it sounds pretty tasty.

bread, chocolate and olive oil = carbs & fat - how healthy is that?

Loved this recipe. Not so obvious as the prior reviewers thought. Salt makes it amazing.

This is perfect. Unlike the other two reviewers who must be much more savvy than I when it comes to serving a dessert I never would have come up with on my own, I needed the nudge toward the idea. Simple, elegant, fairly healthy and room for ellaboration if one chooses. Thanks.

Do we really need a recipe telling us how to melt chocolate on toast?

This is a recipe? What's next? A peanut butter & jelly sandwich recipe? Rerading this was a waste of time.
