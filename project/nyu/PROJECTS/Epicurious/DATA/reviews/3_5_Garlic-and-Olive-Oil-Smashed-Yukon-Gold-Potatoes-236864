So simple! I did everything as suggested, except I didn't smash the potatoes. I mixed them around and some got a little beat up, but it looked beautiful served in a bowl for a 3yo (or any age) b-day party. I also suggest using kosher salt and a bit more garlic.

Ever since I have developed a negative reaction to milk products, I've held back from one of my favorite foods: Mashed Potatoes. How can mashed potatoes taste good without butter or milk? Well, this recipe was my answer and I was absolutely thrilled with the results. In fact, I think I like it even better than "normal" mashed potatoes that use milk products. From now on, this will be my tried and true mashed potato recipe.

Nice change from mashed potatoes -- great flavor from the olive oil, garlic and the onions (I sauteed some minced onions with the garlic). But I did find them alittle dry, but wonderful with some of the sauce from a veal dish that they were served with. The little bit of sauce pushed these potatoes into very satisfying 'comfort' food!

I had thought I would use the onions, but somehow that went by the wayside. The dish is great and easy. I did allow the potatoes to sit in the frying pan and brown a bit. I did not use all the oil called for and I added a little bit of butter at the end.

These potatoes are delicious. I took the previous reviewer's suggestion of sauting onions, which add a nice flavor. Because the potatoes had to wait between being boiled (I didn't have a steamer on hand) and being added to the skillet, they got a little dry. And so I added some pats of butter. But ultimately, these potatoes are easy to make and would highly recommend this over the panfried smashed potatoes on the site.

This is so easy it's crazy. Really good flavor from garlic and tyme. I also added half a cup of chopped spanish onion.

As written the recipe was a bit bland. I agree with Scott, sauteed onion would have added a bit more flavor and definitely steam potatoes for 20 minutes. I'll try it again but with modifications.

We really enjoyed this, but consider the following. In addition to the garlic, I chopped a small yellow onion and sauteed that with the garlic. It added an excellent flavor. I also used less olive oil and steamed the potatoes for about 20 minutes to get them good and soft. This is a fantastic, delicious, and healthy side. We served it with grilled pork chops.

Great and very easy potato recipe. The olive oil gives it a different flavor and the usual mashed potato. We all loved it!

oily, but nice alternative to lots of dairy. Cut down a bit on the oil add s + p, you're golden.

I really liked it-but there are few potato recipes that I don't and after being on South Beach lifestyle for a while they taste particulary good! The family still prefers traditional mashed, but these were a very good accompaniment to the rack of lamb and cherry tomato recipe they were featured with.
