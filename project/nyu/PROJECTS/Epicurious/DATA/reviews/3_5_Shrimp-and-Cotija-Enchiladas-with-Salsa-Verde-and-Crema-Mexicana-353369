I absolutely LOVED this!! The salsa verde was delicious! This is such a healthy recipe! The only things I did differently was that I added more garlic (which I always do) and used dried oregano instead of fresh (forgot to buy fresh:/) My husband loved it and I'll definetely make it again!

Overall it was pretty good. I usually avoid making enchiladas because they are so heavy and cheesy. These enchiladas were light and fresh-tasting, which I really liked. My major complaint with this dish was that they fell apart so easily when served. It tasted good but the presentation and texture were kind of gross. I'm not sure if I will make this dish again. It was a LOT of work for only 3 forks. I had my husband help me with the shrimp peeling and deveining otherwise it would have taken all evening to make.

Nice taste, but the sauce was a little too spicy for our taste.

After reading a few reviews about the prep time, I elected to cut some corners which didn't seem to alter the taste as it was still exceptional. I used salsa verde-Herdez makes a good one. I also used a mixture of feta and cotija. I found the corn tortillas a little heavy or thick and would probably try flour tortillas next time. This would also be good with chicken but the shrimp is great for a change!

I am so excited to report a solution to the soggy tortillas that have a tendency to tear when building the enchiladas and virtually disintegrate when reheating the leftovers. La Tortilla Factory makes a "hand made style corn tortilla" that is a blend of corn and wheat. You get the flexibility of flour tortillas but with the flavor of corn. I have made this dish 3 times with rave reviews, but this is the first time with these tortillas. I highly recommend them. This recipe is fabulous, too. I use a combination of cotija and feta and get a little more depth of cheese flavor.

Good recipe. It didn't take as long as I expected to make, and since I didn't have tomatillos I just used hot house tomatoes-the enchiladas still turned out great. I also left off the cheese and no one missed it. My only complaint about this recipe is that it doesn't reheat very well, so it's not good for leftovers.

Sorry, forgot to add that I did NOT dip the tortillas in the salsa verde and did NOT microwave them with the damp paper towels after reading the reviews on here. I was initially worried b/c the tortillas cracked as I filled them and put them into the baking dish. But I spread a little salsa and a good helping of cheese on top, and voila! They came out just fine. Not wrapped as neatly as a burrito, but definitely identifiable as enchiladas and individually scoop-able with a spatula.

Absolutely delicious! I only gave this three forks because I was lazy and cut some corners, but the end result was still fantastic. After reading all the complaints about prep time on here, I decided to use store-bought salsa verde (Rosa Mexicana brand, so I felt it would do the trick!) The DH and I also love spicy food, so in addition to using the Hot salsa verde, I added several chiles. I also indulged by sprinkling a good coating of cheese on top of the enchiladas and finished it off with the cilantro and a few squeezes of lime on top before baking. It still took about 30 min. of prep, but well worth it!

Husband, friends, firefighting son all agreed that these were the best enchiladas they had ever eaten. Reading the other reviews, I guess they did fall apart- but no one mentioned it or cared at all. Delicious. We added lime and chipotle hot sauce at the table. Everyone was delighted that the enchiladas had a light bright flavor and were not the usual 'gloppy, cheesy, heavy' enchiladas you get at restaurants. The second time I made them, I roasted poblanos and tomatillos the night before, while watching TV.. much less work the next evening!

Delicious. I would give it 3.5 stars though because the enchiladas do fall apart and the salsa needed a little more kick (I add one half of a jalapeno). The flavors are all terrific though.

This was excellent, I didn't have the problem with the enchiladas being soggy. I made some enchiladas with chorizo for the meat eaters in my crowd and it didn't disappoint. Everyone raved! Other than that, I followed this recipe exactly.

Made this after one look at the picture. Certainly time consuming because of all the prep work, but worth it. Ours too was a bit soggy but didn't impact overall flavor. Leftovers the day after tasted even better!

My family loved this. I think next time I'll cut my shrimp into 3 or 4 pieces. The sauce is incredible.

I thought this was amazing. I made it last night and my husband has been talking about it all day! I added lime juice to the filling, along with some chopped tomato. Used pepper jack cheese (couldn't find cojito) and made a sauce of thick fat-free Greek yogurt with lots of lime juice and cayenne pepper. We LOVED it and it is so worth the effort.

Made it this weekend! Really good! I'm not a huge salsa vedre fan, but this recipe was pretty great - i added some seeds from the poblanos to give it a little more of a kick. I found however that when I microwaved the tortillas in the damp paper towel, they still weren't moist enough. I had to go old school and dip them in heated oil. Worked much better. It does take longer, but I would recommend it instead of wasting time and paper towels that route. Other than that - very good! Oh - it does take a LOT of prep time though - so be prepared and make sure you have the time before you start them!

I made these for a dinner party this week, and my guests raved about them. I did, however, make a few substitutions. I used chicken thighs instead of shrimp and seasoned with S&P, cumin, and cayenne. I toasted the tortillas lightly in the oven prior to dipping in the salsa verde and this solved the soggy problem other reviewers had. I also made them casserole style instead of rolled. I followed salsa verde recipe exactly but next time would use a jalapeno and maybe some paprika or cayenne to add a little kick. Otherwise... yummy.

Very good! Not a huge fan of shrimp but loved it in this recipe. It is time consuming. Used anaheim chilies in place of poblano due to availability and they worked well. Cotija cheese is a must. Over stuffed my enchiladas but they did not fall apart as others struggled with, nor was the corn tortilla soggy. I have learned not to over steam and to work quickly. Cook immediately not allowing the enchilada to sit long. Flavors work nicely with bites of avacodo and a light drizzle of crema. Nice recipe

I had high hopes and was disappointed, it took longer than expected and was only okay. I did not have the soggy issue, toasted the tortilla's first. Like the flavor of the Cotija cheese, but it really needed to also have a cheese that melts, the filling was too chunky. For leftovers, I added some more liquid salsa verde of my own and topped with shredded cheddar cheese and they were much better. Sour Cream or Crema is a must. For the amount of time, I'd rather make Tyler Florence's Ultimate Chicken Enchilada's (shrimp could substituted) with roasted tomatillo sauce.

My only change was to add about a half a jalapeno since poblanos are very mild. Very tasty but mushy, probably since my tortillas were fresh from the bakery and still warm when I purchased. Definitely turns into a casserole but a delish one that I'd make again.

These were very tasty. It made way to much salsa, but it will be nice a nice salsa for chips. I did not dip them in the salsa but just spooned some on the inside and they were still very soggy, or at least I couldn't scoop out a single enchilada rather it was more casserole like. All in all my family enjoyed it.

Oh, I wanted to comment on the soggy factor. I didn't dip the tortillas in the salsa verde. I microwaved them first, spread about a tablespoon on each tortilla, then filled them. No sogginess at all.

Excellent shrimp enchiladas, and I have tried many recipes. My only changes...I halved the shrimp lengthwise, and I couldn't find Cotija cheese, had to use Feta. A little bit of work, but well worth it. I served these with the Zucchini & Red Bell Pepper Rice from this issue.

I think the next time I make this I will briefly cook the tortillas in oil like I usually do, rather than microwave them in damp paper towels. The enchiladas ended up being too soggy. Otherwise they were delicious. Don't forget to serve with slices of avocado.

I loved the flavors in this recipe, especially the tomatillo sauce. I decided to fry my tortillas before using them and they still went soggy. Not sure why. Maybe I'll try flour tortillas next time. I really liked the cotija cheese with this recipe--haven't ever used it before.

I am definitely going to try this one. All this talk of mushy tortillas by reviewers - the way to do them right for any enchiladas is to steam the tortillas 1 or 2 at a time, 15 seconds per side. A little time consuming but worth it for the great corn flavor, texture and right amount of moisture; healthy too.

My husband raved about this recipe. We presented it just as the cover did and they disappeared! I used Feta (Greek) and it was excellent. It is worth the time.

This recipe is excellent, just needs some tweaking. Doctor up jarred salsa verda with roasted tomatillos, roated garlic, and chopped green onions. I used anaheim chilis to keep it mild, so you can add additional heat at serving. Just line the dish with the salsa, and wet the corn tortillas. My tortillas were a little dry but that is better than mushy. I may try flour next time. Couldn't find Cojito so I used Feta, just lessened the amount. The avacado at serving is a must!

I did not like this recipe at all. It was very time consuming to put together. The tortillas were so soggy that I couldn't get them onto the plate! It didn't resemble an enchilada at all in the end. I didn't think the flavor was great... not worth the effort.

I made this for a dinner party last night, and we were disappointed. It is very time-intensive and not all that good. I followed the recipe to the letter, but they just weren't that great. The main problem was that they got all mushy and completely fell apart when I served them. They ended up looking like mush on a plate with garnishes...oh well. On a brighter note, I did make the chile-corn custard squares, black beans and the rice from the same issue and they were the hit of the party.

This recipe needs lime juice...we splashed it on the individual servings this time but I'll add it to the sauce next time. We thought this was great, added the jalapenos because we live in the SW and need the heat. I have also made the sauce using my NM hot roasted green chili and added smoked pork shoulder and made a great chili verde. I even talked my husband into putting a tomatillo plant on the patio so we can keep trying this recipe. Also, my family's tradition is to slightly fry corn tortillas so I did this too did not bother to roll, as a NM native, we loved our stacked enchiladas and that's what I did using a whole tortilla, next time I'll cut the tortilla in quarters and layer like a casserole. The flavors were awesome and we will keep making this.

Just finished this for supper and family all agreed it was absolutely delicious. I must admit that because I couldn't find tomatillos or cotija I used jarred salsa verde (President's Choice) and feta cheese and I used jalapenos instead of poblano. Definitely a keeper!!

I give this a very mixed review. The flavors are excellent. The two complaints I have are that it is very time consuming and the tortillas get soggy. I will make a variation the next time. I will saute the shrimp with the onions, poblanos and spices. I will then make soft tacos; steam the tortillas and top with shrimp mixture, cheese, salsa and sour cream. If I'm pressed for time I can use a jarred salsa verde.

I enjoyed this but will use a different cheese next time. The cotija I used just didn't help the flavors meld. The feta really wouldn't have worked.

Great mix of flavors using feta. You have leftover salsa verde to use for chips. My enchiladas fell apart when serving but everyone gobbled them up.

Rating: 4
I loved this. Jalepenos are a must though, because this was not spicy at ALL. I pre-made the enchiladas and rewarmed them in the oven before serving. Don't skimp on the cotija either, feta would just not work with these flavor combinations.

Outstanding! I had recently had very disappointing seafood enchiladas at a local restaurant and I knew I could do better. This recipe is it. The salsa verde is easy to make and has a wonderful bright taste. Great on its own with chips. The enchiladas were delicious. I'm looking forward to making them again, maybe substituting dungeness crab for half of the shrimp.
