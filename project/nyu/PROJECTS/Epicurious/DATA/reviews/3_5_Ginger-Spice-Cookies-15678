I added about 1/3 cup of crystallized ginger and doubled the spices, also used dark molasses. I really like them. Great texture!

i doubled the cinnamon and also included a couple tablespoons of minced crystalized ginger. really delicious - a little crispy and chewy in the middle. i made sandwiches out of them with vanilla frosting in the middle.

This is a really solid recipe. Not too spicy but pleasant and lovely with a cup of tea. I rolled the cookies in a combo or organic turbinado and cane sugar before baking which resulted in a nice light crunch to the exterior. I only had regular dark molasses but that seemed to deepen the flavor. I will be adding these to my cookie give away this year.

These cookies needed more spice and texture, so I added minced crystalized ginger about 1/2 cup and doubled the spice as well. now they are the cookie of the season.

I am 2 years old and my mom and I made these cookies - I loved them but mom and dad found them B L A N D - where is the spice? I say double the amount of spice otherwise all you get is a sweet cookie that appeals to a 2 year olds palate - which is great if that is what you are looking for....

I loved these ginger-flavored cookies! An absolute keeper. Not only was the flavor delicious, but I'm especially pleased that the ingredients do not include shortening as do many cookie recipes. I took advice from the reviewer named 'A Cook from Houston, TX' who suggested adding an additional quarter tsp of each spice and also dark molasses (I used dark molasses 3 to 1 when I doubled the recipe). I didn't have enough white flour so included almond meal (can subsitute almond meal for up to 50% of white flour called for in most recipes; instructions on pkg). Using vegetable spray on the bottom of the glass for flattening the rolled cookies on the cookie sheet worked very well, respraying the glass every three cookies or so. Pressing hard made thin cookies, pressing lightly made thick cookies. I sprinkled additional sugar over the flattened cookies before baking them on parchment paper (colored sugar crystals might be interesting to try). Next time I plan to substitute some of the butter with ground flaxseed (instructions on pkg) to eliminate a little of the fat.

Very yummy cookies. If you want a crisper cookie, just bake a few minutes longer at lower temp. I bake all my cookies on parchment. To keep the dough from sticking to the bottom of the glass, wrap a small piece of parchment along the bottom, and you're sticky-free! This recipe is by far a Christmas Keeper

These are perfect cookies!!!! Chewy, lot's of flavour, I have given more people the link to this recipe, than any other!!! Almost exactly like the "Ginger Mollassus Cookie" at "Starbucks".

I found this cookie's texture too soft, akin to a toll house cookie, and too mild in flavor.

If you try no other cookie recipe this year, you must make this one. I delighted and astounded my family by sharing a batch of these monster, crispy, yet chewy, and sinfully delicious cookies at our Thanksgiving celebration in 2002. Regretfully, I lost the November 2002 issue of Bon Appetite and only recovered the recipe, this afternoon. MAKE it your New Year's resolution, to astound the self appointed recipe gurus(snobs) in your circle of friends(?) You will be bombarded for your secret. Never tell. You have earned the right to shine. "Let them eat cake!" - Marie Antoinette

I made this recipe the day before Christmas Eve. I had them baking as my guests were arriving for a Christmas Eve Open House the next day. Not only did it make my house smell festive, but everyone loved them! I added more spices as some other people did. I also like the fact that it doesn't contain shortening like most ginger cookies.

The cookies turned out very flat and gummy. I checked the recipe again, and I'd done it all right. I'm not going to try again... the smell was wonderful, but the cookies were not :(

I started looking for a ginger cookie to make for xmas back in Oct. Tried a few, and this was the best one (and the first one i found). I like the fact that they come out soft. I've been cutting them into men, and trees and hearts....and decorating them when they cool. Everybody loves them and they make a really cute gift. One change i made was i added a bit more of each spice just for more of a kick. Definately a keeper in my repetoire.

These cookies are delicious! The only thing is mine seem to turn out quite flat. Could that be because I'm taking shortcuts and not flattening them with the glass and the sugar??

I really enjoyed this recipe, as did my friends and family. I always prefer cookie recipes that don't call for shortening, so I like this better than the other ginger spice cookie recipe listed on this site. I also got about 35 cookies from this recipe, but in the future I'd still double it, since they disappeared so fast!

These are great cookies. They were easy to make and came out soft in the middle. I doubled the recipe when I made them for Christmas but neglected to notice that the recipe only made 28 so I didn't have nearly as many as I planned. The cookies stuck to the glass when pressing them out. I dipped the glass in the sugar before pressing and it solved the problem.

Super easy and soft and delicious. Especially good I found when some nutmeg and allspice is added. Delish.

This is a good alternative to chocloate chip all the time. Chill in a plastic container and use an ice cream scoop to form balls of dough.
