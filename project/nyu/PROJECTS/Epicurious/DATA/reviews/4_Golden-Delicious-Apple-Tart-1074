I found this to be an easy, delicious recipe! I used 5 haralson apples. Also used greek yogurt instead of whipping cream. And apple sauce instead of apple juice concentrate. (Both substitutions were because of what i had on hand.)

I love this tart; I'm always tempted to double the apple custard, or make some extra for other dessert purposes... I found that the most time consuming part was peeling, coring and slicing the apples -- but that's standard for almost any apple dessert. If you anticipate that you might be crunched for time, I'd recommend making and baking the tart crust a day before, along with the custard (it needs to cool in the fridge anyway), and then making the apple filling and baking the whole, complete tart the next day. The "devil's" in the prep-work, not the overall tart.

This recipe was very time consuming as the other reviews also noted. I followed the directions completely and found the tart to be just ok. I have made many tarts in the past but found that the end result was not worth the effort.

Very good. We had surprise guests and I needed a dessert that I could make quickly with stuff I had on hand. I skipped almost all of the steps listed for the crust--just mixed the ingredients in my food processer, pressed into the pan, and baked 15 minutes sans foil or pie weights. Maybe not the most gorgeous-looking crust this way, but it had its own rustic appeal. I didn't have cream, so I used lowfat milk, and it was fine. I did take the precaution of bringing just the milk (not the apple juice) to a boil and then adding the egg yolk mixture and then the apple juice to keep the juice from curdling the milk. The custard was still great, and lower-fat than using the cream. I used Macintosh apples, which were fine, and I was running out of time (and had a baby on one hip) so I just dumped them over the custard rather than arranging them in concentric circles. Even with these alterations the dessert was fabulous, and I got lots of compliments.

So delicious and lovely to look at. DO NOT make the mistake of thinking you need to serve with ice cream or cream...the custard stands alone, but is subtle. Made the crust in cuisinart. Think I'll try pressing it immediately into the pan from the processor and then the freezer. Shouldn't be too warm straight from the processor.

this recipe was fabulous, and i got some really great compliments. i didn't find it that time-consuming, but maybe this means i don't have enough to do. pretty straightforward and easy for a pie novice.

I was so proud of this dessert! It was excellent and looked fantastic as well. It was time consuming but I plan on making it many more times!

This recipe is really delicious, but EXTREMELY time consuming. I have made other tarts that are just as good, in half the time. Why do you need to freeze the crust? I probably wouldn't make this again because of the time involved.

Fantastic but time-consuming. Do all of the make-aheads or else you won't have time for the entree.

A classic French style apple custard tart. I definitely recommend that golden delicious apples be used. I top with toasted sliced almonds.

Fabulous! I a big hit! I used granny smith apples instead, buttery sweet crust with tart filling.... what better?

This was one of the best desserts I've ever made. A real keeper--very sophisticated in taste and presentation, yet easy to make. If your trying to decide if you want to try it--just do it! You'll be very pleased with the results.

Soooo good. I used granny smiths instead of golden delicious and was glad for the extra kick. It took me forever to make, but it was great in the end (I guess I cook slow since it's actually supposed to be speedy). The crust is fabulous and flavorful and the custard is delicious. It had a great presentation and was reminiscent of a lemon bar recipe I hold dear to my heart and tummy. I got huge compliments on this one from my boyfriend and his sister. I think the pan I used was too big, though, because my crust had no lip. It still looked good flat, though--nothing ran over the edges or anything, so it was still pretty.

This was delicious. I made it for Mother's Day and there was none left. People were sharing the last few bits. This one is a keeper.

I made this tart for Thanksgiving dinner instead of traditional apple pie, and it was a huge hit! The recipe is a little time-consuming, but easy. Definitely worth the trouble because it looked stunning for serving time! Tastes as good as it looks--a keeper!

Absolutely yummy but definately time consuming...it was the only thing that actually was finished at Thanksgiving dinner...lighter than the pumpkin cheesecake pie which was also great!

Easy to make and delicious. I think I'll try a different crust because I've had better, but over all it was very nice and beautiful dessert to serve to company. Keep in mind that it takes some time to make.

I have made this delicious, light dessert many times. I have used apples, pears or nectarines, with the nectarines probably the most superb. I usually puree some fresh fruit and add to the cream instead of the orange juice.
