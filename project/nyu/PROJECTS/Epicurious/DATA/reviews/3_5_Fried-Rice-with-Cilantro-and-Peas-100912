Good and easy. I would substitute sesame oil as well and maybe use sesame seeds instead of cumin. The cumin competes with the soy sauce maybe. Or maybe it's because I just have never used cumin and soy sauce in the same dish before. Next time I will try it without cumin and see how it goes.

This is easy and really yummy. I made it with two cups of brown rice and doubled the soy sauce and vinegar, served with baked salmon topped with lime butter sauce (changed it to lime olive oil sauce) from this site and spinach salad. Great easy meal.

Eeeee-zzzzz! I, too, used sesame oil, added a few more scallions, doubled the soy sauce and vinegar, plus added some left-over BBQ pork roast diced and a half cup of chicken stock. Will absolutely do again -- maybe adding a bit of fresh garlic to the oil and cumin seeds.

Quick, Easy & Yummy!! I added egg in the beginning, fried until lightly brown, then added rice, steamed carrots, peas and a touch of sesame oil at the end. Turned out great! This recipe is super versatile.

Really quick and easy. Added some leftover chicken at the same time as rice. Found that I needed to double soy sauce and vinegar. Other than that, followed procedure and it came out great!

I made this recipe recently, never having made any kind of fried Rice before. I added some chicken and carrots (because I had them, and to make it more of an entree than a side dish). It was fabulous!!! The cumin and cilantro combo is really great. I was upset w/my husband last week for using up some leftover rice, as I planned to make this again and couldn't. So last night, I cooked up a batch of rice and put it in the fridge, JUST so that we could have this tonight -- silly but true. Yummy!

This simple dish was a surprisingly delightful side at dinner tonight. I substituted brown rice, and it was splendid!

Loved the lighter side of this rice. I would cut the cilantro portion in half next time. I added two eggs and additional soy sauce. Try adding cooking the rice next time in bacon grease and cut up the bacon into the rice. Not so good for you, but delicious. also add sliced mushrooms, bean sprouts. It is my mom's trick for her famous fried rice, sorry mom!

Super easy, quite delicious, a really good recipe to utilize leftover rice.

OMG! This recipe rocks! Slightly modified by adding some stuff I had in the fridge - few stalks of fresh asparagus, white mushrooms, egg and also a can of sliced water chestnuts. Did not add the rice vinegar but went with 2 Tbl oil and probably 4 Tbl of soy sauce. Frozen peas at the end so they do not get mushy! Very good and much better than high fat take out.

Overall, pretty good! Needs more soy sauce and rice vinegar...easy and fast, good way to use up leftovers.

We have tried many different fried rice recipes, and this one is by far the best.

I add a few marinated spicy chicken breasts cut into strips and this makes a perfect entree!

A very good quick weeknight dish. We added teriyaki/garlic marinated New York strip on top. And we used shelled edamame instead of peas. Nice fresh flavor, we'll definitely make it again.

OK, not worth the clean-up. Would probably be almost as good just tossing the ingredients with steamed rice. Also would increase the seasonings (soy sauce, etc.).

I never knew making friend rice could be so easy. I did modify the recipe with what I had on hand - (peas, carrots, onions instead of scallions, and less cilantro. I added ginger and chiles to the soy sauce. The cumin and cilantro really add a great kick.

this was take-out fried rice without the grease! it was great, as my boyfriend said, "click-add to favorites". I used the Chinese-style rice recipe on this site to make the rice and then stuck it in the freezer to chill because I hadn't made it ahead. I didn't use the vinegar and added a dollop of hoison to the soy and probably used more than a tablespoon of soy. I used sugar snap instead of regular peas, and added a couple dashes of a spice I have called asian pepper market from C&B. When it was done, I sprinkled it with toasted sesame oil. Served it with a marinated roast asian pork. It was yummy and having it for lunch again today!

I didn't think this was that great--I liked the cumin, but the vinegar gave it a sour taste. If I made it again, I'd probably delete the vinegar altogether and add something spicy, like chili flakes.

Very good dish, but it needs the fried egg and extra soy sauce other reviewers have mentioned. There's really too much cilantro for my taste; and I added just a little fresh ginger to give the dish some zing.

This fried rice was delicious. We added some fried egg and more soy sauce.

This was very good and quite tasty. I used frozen peas and carrots and had to add more soy sauce and vinegar. Needs fenugreek or thai peppers. Would make again. Very very easy for a quick midweek meal.

This dish was great. I cooked this as a meal for my family, and they loved just as much as I did. I think I put a little to much cilantro in, but it still came out great.

I was surprised at how much my family loved this dish! I made it exactly as the recipe said, except that I accidently forgot to use any oil and it was fine, although did stick to the fry pan a little.

Very simple and very delicious! This has gone into our vault 'o recipes. Even the picky spoilt brat next door liked it! Definitely a keeper.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe. I did not use cilantro because neither of us like it very much, but I think it would have added to the combination of flavors. I think I added too much soy sauce and vinegar because I read the other reviews. But he loved it so maybe not.

Everyone liked this recipe and it was easy. I did double the rice vinegar and soy sauce, plus I added a little bit of Chinese hot oil and sesame oil. I used ground cumin instead of seeds.

Just wonderful! Easy, flavorful, great use for leftover rice (I always make sure I had leftover rice now - just for this recipe)

mmmm. My mother is Asian and made fried rice for me as a child. I make it today with chinese style sausage (Chinese or Vietnamese markets). I add leftovers like ham, chicken, shrimp, broccoli. I always use a little onion and add more soy sauce than is called for in this recipe. This is the first time I have added cilantro! It was good.

Nice to have a variation of fried rice that doesn't have egg in it... I added quite a bit more soy and r/w vinegar for more zing. I love peas, and cilantro, so this is right up my taste bud alley. Wonderful for leftover rice, and it's very fast to make - under 10 min. Next time, I'll add shrimp to make it a meal.

I added some leftover chicken and made it a main dish for two. I made a double batch of basmati in the rice cooker for the previous night's meal. I only had ground cumin but it worked fine. The whole meal took me about 5 minutes to make and it was very yummy. This super quick meal will become a regular.
