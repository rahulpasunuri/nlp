Easy and good. Make sure you use a good *nonstick* pan!

No mustard greens in sight so I used baby spinach--completely yummy. So good and fast and easy and HEALTHY (if your cholesterol is okay).

Yummy way to use mustard greens! I used havarti cheese instead of fontina and it worked fine. I also cooked the eggs on the stovetop first, then put the fritatta under the broiler. With crusty bread and a salad, it was terrific.
