has excellent flavor but the sauce was definitely sticky! if the sauce was thinner it would be perfect! great with green beans and rice.

Very surprised at how this came out given the reviews. Made as written, the sauce struck me as dull and muddy, with a very one-note peanut butter taste. Use a very light hand when measuring out the peanut butter. Followed some others' notes and added lots of extra citrus (mostly lime juice), some chili-garlic sauce, more soy sauce, more scallions, a handful of minced cilantro, and extra water to thin the consistency. The additions helped to perk up the sauce but still, I found it a bit sweet and one-dimensional. I have to believe there are better peanut sauces to be found.

Its so easy and I will definitely make it again. I would suggest doubling the water they recommend,to make the sauce less thick. I did not fry the shrimp either and it tasted great.

With all due respect to everyone who raved about this one, I thought it was just okay. I made the sauce by the recipe and tasted it and it was VERY sweet, then I tried adding more soy and lemon as suggested and then it tasted VERY sweet AND a bit too salty. In the end, I ended up also adding a handful of cilantro - I think it added some nice flavor. I think I want to try this one again with unsweetened peanut butter.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this recipe turned out considering how simple it is! Instead of deep frying, I sauteed the prawns in some olive oil, sea salt, flour and pepper and they came out great. Served over a bed of brown rice topped with the sauce and it was de-lish!

I almost never deep-fry anything, so next time I will stir-fry instead to lighten it up. Sauce could be thiner but what a great taste. Other sides should be somewhat less pungent I think since this dish should be the feature.

Used asian chili-garlic sauce in place of jalapeno for sauce. Doubled sauce recipe for 2# of prawns. Sauce recipe was easy, and quite good and tasty. Don't care for deep fried foods so I pan seared the prawns, added the sauce, then tossed in the scallions toward the end. Served with steamed jasmine rice and a cucumber, red onion, and mint thai style salad (also on site). Easy for a mid-week dinner. Daughter commented that the shrimp was better the day after. Flavors may have penetrated the prawns more.

This is the 1st recipe I have liked on this web site. Yummy! Added extra cayenne but pretty much stayed with original recipe. This is a bit heavier of a sauce than in Thai cooking, but still good.

This was absolutely delicious and just a comment to the ONE person who said this was disgusting? and bland? I'm gonna go ahead and assume the only thing that isn't bland to you is a salt lick. Tell me what is bland about peanut butter, soy sauce, lemon and cayene?

EXCELLENT! And so easy. This is a restaurant-quality sauce that is asked for over and over. Now I make it with whatever hot item is handy -chinese chili paste, mongolian hot oil, etc... FYI: I butterflied and oil-marinated the shrimp then broiled them for 2 min. each side. Try this sauce, you'll love it!

Delicious, delicious. Easy to make with things around the kitchen. I also stir-fried the shrimp instead of deep frying it, and added a bit more soy sauce and cayenne. My fiance loved every bite - and even stole more shrimp off of my plate! Definitely a sauce to have in my arsenal.

The fried shrimp alone were very good, but that sauce was digusting! I followed the directions exactly at first and I found it to be very bland. Then I added more lemon juice and soy sauce, as the other reviewers recommended, which made it even more disgusting. I will never make this again!

I didn't fry the shrimp instead pan seared. The sauce was the best I've tried so far. Though I tweeked the recipe mightly. I used lime not lemon and tripled the amount of juice. I also added 1 tsp fish sauce and zest from the lime. As you can see this recipe can easily be manipulated to suit your tastes. Enjoy!

The sauce was amazing. I took others advice and added more lemon juice and more soy. I also added a bit of water as it was still a little thick. Everyone loved it!

This dish was delicious and so quick. I added some stir-fried veggies too and it turned out great. Definitely a keeper!!

I have tried many peanut sauces and this was definitely the best! Instead of frying the shrimp, I butterflied them a cooked them on the grill. I then stir fried red peppers, snow peas and mushrooms, placed the veggies and shrimp over rice and poured the sauce on top. Had to add water to get it to the right consistency but once I did, the dish was perfect!!

This sauce WAS awesome! Thanks to the other reviews, I sauteed the shrimp rather than frying and would recommend this. I increased the water, increased the lemon juice and was generous with the cayenne pepper. With the sauce thinned out, I put the shrimp in it before serving and poured it all over rice. Delicious!!

This is a hit. The sauce is completely versatile. I made more the very next evening and poured it over sauteed chicken breast served with rice and broccoli. Some changes: I used Vietnamese chili/garlic sauce instead of cayenne, a bit more lemon and a bit more soy. The peanut heaviness was a bit much with the stated amounts of these two ingredients. Fantastic.

I thought the peanut sauce was fabulous! I agree with most, frying the shrimp is not recommended with the accompanying sauce. Instead, I grilled the shrimp on skewers and dipped them into the sauce. My husband and I loved it! An ideal appetizer for a party!

Really delicious recipe, but a bit salty. Next time, I would decrease the soy sauce and increase the water. It was very easy to make and tasted great with a cucumber salad on the side and served over white rice.

Quite nice. Threw in some vegies that were around (red pepper and snap peas) and served over steamed rice. But would also be good just stand alone. I agree - saute the shrimp, and be sure not to overcook.

Awesome! I sauted the shrimp and it worked great! I served it over angel hair pasta and with garlic bread. It got rave reviews! It's a diffenent keeper!

Loved it! Made it with my mother (sauteed shrimp instead of fried) and we both agreed that we could add lots of heat and a little extra liquid to make it slightly thinner. We're going to experiment with it several times. I'm hoping that, depending on our mood, we can make it a four alarm fire, or milder for soft mouthed guests.

Good dish, but frying the shrimp may not have been the best option. As noted above, saute might have been better. I would definitely make it again, though.

Very easy and the peanut sauce was magnificent. However, I don't think I'll go to the trouble of frying thr shrimp next time. It didn't really seem to fit and sauteed they would be great with the sauce and rice.

Sounds yummy, but I don't think 275 is hot enough to cook the shrimp properly.
