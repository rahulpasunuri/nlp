There are better recipes. And to the idiot who let "the mutt" eat it, chocolate is lethal to dogs. Perhaps you should learn a few basics before cooking for anyone or anything.

I made a double batch of this to dip my pretzels into during the football game on T.V. last Sunday. I didn't like the texture, though, and ended up just letting the mutt eat it. Although he finished the whole thing, the dog laid in the corner and didn't move for the next day and half. I suppose it didn't fit his fancy, either.

Use your favorite dark chocolate and you will have an exquisite sauce in a matter of minutes. It can elevate an ordinary bowl of ice cream or poached fruit to an extraordinary dessert.
