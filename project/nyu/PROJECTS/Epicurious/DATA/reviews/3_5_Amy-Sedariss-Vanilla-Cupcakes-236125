The cornbread comments didn't make any sense...until I made this these cupcakes. They somehow did end up like cornbread, not quite what was looking for ina cupcake. I didn't follow the instructions as written bjt like others used the typical method of alternating wet and dry. Maybe that was my mistake. Will not try these again.

I tried a Kara's vanilla cupcake today, and was surprised that it wasn't very good. So I looked up on Epicurious and found this recipe and decided to give it a try. It worked beautifully, though I took some of my own liberties. Noting the comments about 'corn muffin' similarities, I decided to be pre-emptive. I sifted the flour well and beat the egg whites separately to a soft peak, before adding to the mixture. I also reduced the sugar to just a little over a cup. I pulled them out at 18 minutes and they were delicious, moist, yet delicate.

This is a great recipe. One I will use again. The only improvement would be to scrape vanilla bean seeds, or paste into the batter. It could use a more intense vanilla flavor.

Amy Sedaris is a comedienne. Her cookbook is called "I Like You: Hospitality Under the Influence" - It is supposed to be funny. Regardless, this is my go-to cupcake recipe and I follow it exactly (minus the silly antics) and I get perfect cupcakes every time. I even use this as a base recipe for other flavors. Citrus modifications have been great. My friends and family have described these as tasting like "heaven" or "air" and "better than sex". Follow the directions. This recipe is spot on. I do not find them dense at all. Soooooo much better than a boxed mix.

I just made these cupcakes, and I loved them! They taste great even without icing. I don't really understand the comparison to corn bread since there is no corn meal in it lol! They are a little more dense than other cupcakes, but that's what makes them so good, and they are certainly not heavy. I made it exactly as it says, but at the end you do want to alternate the flour and the milk in about three batches. That's baking 101, so if you have never made a baked good in your life, yes that would be confusing. They taste like vanilla cupcakes! Fantastic ones!

Just made these for a friend's birthday, and although they too remind me of corn muffins, I happen to like corn muffins and thus it didn't bother me. I find her directions to be very confusing if one doesn't know the general baking process, but fortunately other reviewers have added their two bits, which I followed as well - room temp ingredients, cream butter and sugar well, then mix in eggs well one by one. Add flour mixture, alternately with the milk, in three additions. Simple, tasty, and no special ingredients required. Though I prefer chocolate cupcakes, my 4 year old insisted upon vanilla. I'd make these again.

The kids and I love this. I'll never buy a box cake mix again! The key to this recipe is mixing the ingredients in the right order. Follow Amy's instructions until you get to the eggs. After the eggs, add the vanilla. Mix the dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the butter/sugar/eggs/vanilla mixture. Then add 1/2 of the milk. Alternate the dry ingredients and the milk until done. You'll have a light fluffy batter that makes 24 perfect cupcakes!

I am going to try and make these cupcakes. I have one thing to say. What the hell is this Amy Sedaris going on about in this recipe? She sounds like a scatter brain and you would have to be a chef to translate it into a proper recipe. Who ever has a problem with it, its not you its the writer of the recipe. http://www.areyoubeingservedcatering.com

Anyone who found these cupcakes to be dry and crumbly has obviously missed lesson #1 on cupcake baking: PUT THE FLOUR IN LAST! The more you beat flour, the more gluten is released, and that is what makes cupcakes dry/tough/dense. I think the downside to this recipe is the lack of directions. I put the flour in last and while they weren't the best cupcakes ever, they're moist and yummy. I topped them with chocolate cheesecake icing and my coworkers loved them!

I made these cupcakes for the National Guard troops who are helping with flood relief efforts in my hometown in North Dakota. There are 1,000 troops here, so I obviously can't make that many cupcakes, but I doubled this batch and came out with well over 48 cupcakes. And get this; these cupcakes came out great because-I can only think of one answer-I followed the directions!! I did everything as it said and didn't substitute anything for anything else. I will definitely make these cupcakes again, and I'm sure they'll continue to be great. That's generally what happens when you follow a recipe by Miss Sedaris.

Based upon what many people said during their reviews I felt this recipe was worth the effort to at least try it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in how it turned out. As several people stated, it was very heavy and dense, even after using a cake flour to lighten it up. Now, I am the only person in the house who will eat these as my daughter was sent out to buy replacements at a local cupcake store. I seriously doubt I will make this one again.

I was craving something sweet so I thought i would give this recipe a try. I did not read any of the reviews which is odd for me..I just went for it. I am glad I did. My cupcakes came out moist and fluffy. The texture was perfect. My first thought was they did taste a bit like corn muffins..but many scratch recipes do. Can't wait to make again.

These cupcakes were too dense and not that flavorful. In the future I'd definitely opt for a fluffier recipe using oil instead of butter...

Rating: 4
I love this recipe and based off of some of the comments I made a few adjustments. I used about 1 2/3 c. sugar, 1 tbs of vanilla, and I used sifted cake flour. Also, I creamed the butter and sugar according to the directions and then mixed in all of the wet ingredients. In a separate bowl I mixed all the dry ingredients and then stirred in the dry to the wet by hand. If you over mix your cupcake batter they become very dry and dense (possibly resulting in the hockey puck cupcakes that others got). Also, like Amy I made 18 cupcakes. To make them even more moist, after letting them cool, I wrapped them and put them in the fridge over night - for some reason this helps make them more moist. Then I iced them the next day with a version of a wilton buttercream icing that I tweaked.

Love these cupcakes. I've made this recipe twice now, both a big hit. I made them with my own simple buttercream frosting. Not too dense, but not too light either. Them come out perfect every time. I usually get 21, not 24..I'm not quite sure why. Anyways, I'm about to go and make another batch now!

This has become one of my staple recipes. I make it with the buttercream frosting but I honestly think these cakes are at their best eaten warm out of the oven, they have a velvety texture that is sooo good and is lost once they're cooled and iced. Either way, these are a winner.

Great recipe: fast, simple, delicious and funny. I think the key is to not overbeat the mixture after the flour is added otherwise the texture just doesn't come out right. It also goes really well with mocha-mascarpone frosting (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/352096).

I made these cupcakes for Easter. Instead of the buttercream, I used a 7 minute frosting, topped them with green coconut and placed jelly beans on top to look like little Easter baskets. I also added a little coconut extract to the batter and to the frosting. They were very, very good!

Great recipe and really easy. I just made two batches. It comes out better if you divide the batter between 18 cup vs 24. They are bigger and more even in size at 18. I used a hand better and it was fine. I did not try the icing. This is a definate keeper

These cupcakes are fabulous! I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews here but needed a cupcake recipe desperately. There was a bake sale at school I forgot I signed up for!! Using suggestions from the reviews, I changed the recipe a bit by using cake flour (sifted) and reducing the sugar to 1 1/3 C. I was able to make 24 domed cupcakes that are light and fluffy (no weird results, as reviewed). And, the best part is that these cupcakes are good enough to feed to adults, too!

these cupcakes were absolutely awesome. I made them last night and my family loved them and they are all gone in one day! I will be making them again tonight to bring to a special dinner. I haven't tried the icing yet, I hope it is as good as the cupcakes. Also, for those of you who are complaining about the density/texture/etc: this could be cause by a variation in altitude or many other things to keep in mind when baking

these were wonderful. I paid attention to the notes and added a smidge of cinnamon to the batter just in case they came out bland. worked out great. i made another batch by adding dry vanilla pudding mix from trader joe's and added enough milk until it "looked right" and it just gives it a richness. not exactly soft as a box/chemical infused case, but added a another dimension of flavor and texture. adding the pudding mix/milk adds to the volume as well and i got 30 cupcakes out of it. good way to stretch the ingredients.

I made these last weekend for a bake sale and am making them again today for another bake sale (quadrupled recipe!) Not making any changes to recipe, but plan to in the future (citrus zest or triple sec). They have been turning out perfect. Only change is baking them at 350 for 20 minutes instead of 375 seemed to hot.

I made these cupcakes last night and was quite disappointed with the flavor and texture. The taste was a bit bland, certainly not what comes to my mind when i think cupcake. I thought the cake was a bit dense and way too crumbly. Also, and this may be the oven or baking tray I use, but the cake browns on the bottom and shows through the cupcake liner which just looks odd since the cupcake tops were a stark white. All in all, these were just okay. I'll keep searching for the perfect vanilla cupcake recipe.

I liked these cupcakes - very light and moist, really nice. However, they did not dome up at all and stayed very flat so will not look stellar when frosted. I followed the recipe exactly, but have a gas oven, so the temperature is a bit up and down so may account for lack of rise. Taste good, though, and will try again.

It's difficult to find a good recipe for vanilla cupcakes, and even after trying this one, my search goes on. The flavor of these were simply "okay", but my biggest disappointment was the texture: sticky, somewhat crunchy tops, along with a sticky-ish interior that seemed like it had bits of zest in it (although it didn't). It was nicely moist, but I prefer my cupcakes to be pure fluff, and not sticky-textured... :-(

I've only made the cake part so far, and they're good, easy to make, and relatively inexpensive because they lack some expensive ingredients like other vanilla cupcakes on this site (like white chocolate!) I wanted to point out, though, that if you look at the recipe on her website, it has 1 3/4 cups of sugar: http://www.amysedarisrocks.com/recipes.htm#amy

OK. I made 144 of these cupcakes today. Used sifted cake flour and really good vanilla. 350 for 20 minutes. Also tried 325 convection for 20 minutes and they were a little too brown, but OK. Perhaps 17 minutes? Used ice cream scoop to portion and got 24 with each batch. They are WONDERFUL. Don't double the recipe though- the texture is off. I can't imagine why anyone could call these "hockey pucks" or " scones." They are delicate and perfect for my daughter's wedding.

Cupcakes came out dense and flat. Not sure where I messed up, because I followed the recipe nearly exactly. I read previous reviews which said their cupcakes turned out like hockey pucks, so I made sure to whip a lot of air into the batter, hoping it would come out fluffy, but perhaps I overmixed it. Will not be making these again :(

These were great - light and fluffy and not dense at all. I was worried after reading the reviews but I think the key was to bake them only at 350 for 20 min. Also, I had the patience this time to make sure that all the liquid ingredients were room temperature before starting. I think it really made a difference. I like my cakes on the less sweet side so I'm glad I didn't put in any additional sugar. Frosted them with the Chocolate Whipped Cream Icing from another recipe - just delish.

I read all the great review before I decided to make these cupcakes for a baby shower. When they came out of the oven I was shocked to see little hockey pucks. I made a second batch following the instructions exactly, again. These are just VERY dense cupcakes. Good flavor but would not try again. We'll see if they like them at the shower.

I have been searching for a while for the best vanilla cupcake recipe. I think this is the best recipe yet. The cupcake is moist, non-greasy and fairly firm to ice. Keeps well. The first time in a long while that the children want the cake before the icing is on and eat all of the cake when the icing is on! I did reduce the temp. down to 350 and baked for 25 minutes as I made larger cupcakes. I have made this recipe several times now and yield about 18 larger cakes.

These cupcakes were awesome. I expected them to be dry as many cakes from scratch are, but they weren't dry at all! The cupcakes were very moist and fluffy, yet firm enough to hold frosting/fondant decoration. The flavor was perfectly light, and they were so addicting I gave myself a sugar-headache... Because I made "jumbo" sized cupcakes, I lowered the cooking temperature to 325 degrees F in order to ensure even cooking throughout the cupcakes. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This recipe is definitely worth a try. So simple, but soooo tasty :)

I want to tell you what fun I had with this recipe. I have been having a debate with my boyfriend as to what is the best vanilla extract and used this recipe to settle the "argument". I doubled the recipe and divided the dough into 4 parts prior to adding the vanilla. Into each section, I added a different type of vanilla extract. I used Mexican, Tihitian, Madagascar and the regular blend of "pure vanilla" available on the store shelves, referred to as "Commercial Blend". I then had a vanilla taste test party and everyone got a chance to test the different cupcakes with the different vanillas. The Comerical Blend, was the hands down looser as being bland and taseless in comparison. The winners were a tie between the Tihitian and Mexican flavors. Both were very unique and made the cupcakes shine. Moral of the story, these cupcakes are fantastic, if you use really good vanilla!

A very easy recipe - the cupcakes came out delicious. I decorated with a vanilla-and-Grand Marnier buttercream frosting (with a pinch of allspice and 5 tbsps. of whipping cream instead of milk), and skipped the extra 1/2 cup of sugar. I will bake on 350 the next time, though - in a day or two, I think they'll reach scone-like consistency, which is fine, but not something I'm looking for in my cupcakes. I'll definitely be using this recipe again, though.

The lower oven temperature would have made a difference in mine because the tops were too brown before the rest of the cupcake could finish cooking. Also I felt the texture was too reminscent of a corn bread muffin, maybe that was my fault on the ingridents side, but I also felt the vanilla flavor was lacking. I am willing to make it again, but I am going to try using a pure vanilla bean paste and lower the temperature. :]

This is a lovely formula for cupcakes (I used half-and-half for milk and upped the salt to a scant half-teaspoon). I baked them for about 20 minutes at 350 (oven temp. missing from recipe). The cupcakes are tender but not overly delicate: delicious! My batch yielded 20.
