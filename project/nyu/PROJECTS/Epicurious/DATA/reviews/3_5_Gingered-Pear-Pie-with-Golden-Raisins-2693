Also good substituting currants for the golden raisins.

I've made this twice, the first time with golden raisins, the second time I substituted dried tart cherries. Both were delicious. The pie with the tart cherries was particularly nice. I always use bosc pears for baking.

I get raves everytime I make this, and it has become a tradition.

Delicious--I've made it for Thanksgiving several years. It's a crowd pleaser--a great alternative to the standard old apple pie. Works best with home made vanilla ice cream, by the way.

According to my husband, the best pie I ever made! Easy, delicious. Used Comice pears. Didn't have any problem with the runniness like others -- it was perfect texture. When I added the ginger/raisin mixture, I didn't add the little liquid left -- maybe that helped.

This is a recipe that people will remember you for! You can actually be famous for your ginger pear pie. I always bring this pie to Thanksgiving dinner. If you're an inexperienced pie maker, do have HELP on hand for the buttermilk crust. I'm NOT an experienced baker and do sometimes have trouble with it. I use a variety of pears (a couple of each type found in the grocery store) for a great mix of interesting tastes and textures. This tip, from an experienced cook...Lastly buy your pears about 3 days before you make the pie. I always have to hide the pears to prevent them from being eaten.

I guess this one was my fault, i think i got the wrong kind of tapioca, b/c it didn't cook and left the inside soupy. still, it tasted great, just not much to look at. i added 1/4 t. ground ginger and it gave it a nice kick.

Delicious. The crust was a little hard to work with (definitely use plastic wrap; it's sticky) but patched up fine and came out so flaky and fabulous. I'll definitely use it again. I could barely taste the ginger, however. Maybe next time some powdered ginger to amp it up?

My boyfriend claims he is a pie monster and listed this pie as one of his new favorites. I bought Bartletts and let then ripen for a few days before using them. I'll definitely make this again.

Tasty, and easy to assemble. I only baked this for 45 minutes, I recommend watching the pie closely around 45 minutes into the baking time. If you like this, you will also like Pear Crumble with Crystallized Ginger (also on Epi)

Wonderful! This pie looked beautiful and tasted even better. I was very nervous--I hardly ever bake, but needed to make a pie for a party. The butermilk crust was incredible--so flaky and good. As for the pie itself, it was spicy and sweet (but not overpoweringly so). The raisins and ginger paired together nicely. One thing I did that was pretty dumb (but you may not know to do this either if you haven't baked a pie before)--I didn't brush the egg/milk mixture on the outside crust--just on the top of the pie. Didn't realize that's what kept it from burning. I ended up breaking off the burnt outer part, and it still looked fine. I'm so glad that I decided to make not buy a pie for the party!

Delicious. I used fresh ginger, chopped and cooked with sugar and some water until soft. The bite of the fresh ginger nicely offset the sweetness of the raisins.

This was a treat. My mother made pear pie for me when I was a child in the 50's. It was my request and was always met with, "Pear what". I made this recipe for a birthday and it was beyond compare. The ginger and golden raisins are not as sweet and powerful as you may first think. I used fresh bartlet pears. The only addition I will try is it to add a little rum to the simmering liquid for the raisins and the ginger for another layer of flavor. This was a treat.
