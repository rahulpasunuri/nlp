This was a delicious, nicely different and easy potato recipe.

Not so special and definitely needs more salt and pepper. Not worth effort or fat and calories.

I've made this many times because I can freeze four of them and use them at later times. I like the hint of thyme and bay leafs that flavors the sauce, and the apples work well. I don't understand why some people think this needs a "kick" or improving.

This is a wonderful recipe!!!!A really big hit for the birthday dinner, served along with GRILLED SALMON FILETS WITH HORSERADISH SAUCE, July 03 issue. Really great flavor and very easy for prepare.

Just like my comments on the roast pork that goes with this, I thought this was good and has potential. Again, I did changes and will do further changes next time around: 1) I sliced the potatoes and apple (separately) with the 1 mm blade in the food processor 2) after cooking the potatoes with the cream, I spooned the potatoe cream mixture into the ramekins alternately with the apples (layers) 3) after cooking with the foil, I took the foil off and broiled it to give it color I would certainly do those changes again. In addition I would use more salt and pepper (potatoes just "soak" up salt) and I would infuse it with more thyme and bayleaf.

Nothing spectacular here. I made these ahead, baked then broiled the tops while the meat rested. I don't know, seemed like a lot of fat and calories, for not so special results. The apples were an interesting addition that went really well with the sauce on the accompanying pork chops. Flavors tied together well, but failed to burst. These potatos were missing something...needed a little kick.

These were great, and can be made ahead. Great for company, and the apple is very unusual for a potato dish.

Used a combination of heavy cream, half and half and milk. This was a dish that I thought my kids would love and they didn't. My husband and I appreciated the subtle flavors of the thyme and bay leaf, though. We both agreed that next time we'll thinly slice the potatoes with a mandolin instead of grating them. And, I would agree that popping them under the broiler for a minute to finish would help with the appearance.

gratin; gratinée [GRAH-tn (Fr. gra-TAN ); grah-tee-NAY] A gratin is any dish that is topped with cheese or bread crumbs mixed with bits of butter, then heated in the oven or under the broiler until brown and crispy. The terms au gratin or gratinée refer to any dish prepared in such a manner. Special round or oval gratin pans and dishes are ovenproof and shallow, which increases a dish's surface area, thereby insuring a larger crispy portion for each serving.

Very simple and very tasty! We'd prefer a crunchy top, so perhaps we'll remove the foil towards the end next time (and turn the broiler on?). We used heavy cream but regular whipping cream would be fine, too. Good flavor from the bay leaf- & thyme-steeped cream.

This is a very yummy dish,I got rave reviews from my dinner guests. I also thought it would go really well with a sprinkle of blue cheese after the apple. Also maybe for fun a grate of nutmeg in the potato cream mixture. Maybe another time add a grate of swiss to the potato cream mixture. A very fun and delicious side dish.

Gratin doesn't mean cheese.
