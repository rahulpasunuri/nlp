This was a very tasty Sunday dinner. I served them with herbed green lentils, broccoli and a Pinot noir

Amazing. I didn't puree anything I just used a knife. I'm 20 and I had my whole family (very harsh critics) saying "this is as good as lamb gets". Very easy, very tasty, very fun to make.

I just used the recipe for the Dry Rub based on other people's comments. It was so good. I put the rub on 2 hours before grilling and it was just delicious. I also served it w/ grilled zucchini & tomatos w/ feta sauce (epicurious recipe) and some potatoes as was recommended by another reviewer. It paired amazingly well to the lamb and the feta sauce was great with the lamb too. Will definitely make this one again.

Used the rub on 1/2" pork chops - skipped the sauce after reading some of the reviews, and didn't need it. The chops were tender and juicy. Served w/ grilled zucchini & tomatos w/ feta sauce and Greek roast potatos (both o n Epicurious). Family loved it. Will make again.

The rub was great as was the porcini mushroom mixture. I'm not a huge mustard fan so I added small amounts until I thought the sauce was balanced.

Made this as an appetizer for friends last night and we all loved them. I made the recipe as written in spite of reviews. We loved the rub AND the sauce. They worked together wonderfully. For those that didn't think the flavors worked together - maybe you don't like porcini??

I wish that I would have read the reviews before making the lamb chops. Yes, both the rub and the mustard are good but they don't need to be together.

I made this with pork chops instead of lamb. I agree with everyone else - the rub is absolutely delicious. The mustard/mushroom sauce may be good, but not with the meat. My guests loved the meal. I will make this (especially the rub) again and again.

Totally agree with the other reviewers in that the mustard sauce overwhelms the lamb except in the minutest of portions. Think it might be better with about 1/2 of the mustard and yes, some cream to smooth it out. The porcinis themselves are a worthy adjunct to lamb but must be paired with appropriate portions of flavors to make magic on the tongue. The rub for the lamb was outstanding.

Delicious lamb chops because of the outstanding rub. I agree with the previous reviewer that the mustard sauce overwhelms the lamb. I had sauce and rub left over, so I cooked more chops the next night. This time I added several tablespoons of heavy cream to the sauce for a smoother texture and taste that I thought was an improvement.

This is a recipe in two distinct parts, both of which are excellent, but which don't go together. The basic rub for the chops is very good, and brings out alt he flavours nicely. I will be using it or variations of it for lamb chops from now on. The porcini mustard sauce is a great combination too but the meatiness of the porcini completely overwhelms the lamb, even if you use it more as a dipping sauce (as I did). However, it is a good sauce and I can imagine it will be excellent with meatier dishes which have a lot of texture but need their taste enhancing rather than smothering, such as fillet steak (beef tenderloin steak), or perhaps other cuts of lamb. Although this review may appear negative, I don't really mean it to be as I will be using the two parts of it a lot in future - just not together.
