These were very good, but a little on the sweet side. That may be the point, but I'm going to make them again, cutting some of the sweet and WAY upping the crab.

Extremely time consuming but worth it. I followed other's advice and did just more than half of what the recipe called for and still had plenty left over. A unique addition to Christmas dinner.

I love this recipe. I have made it several times it has always been a great hit. I reduce the recipe by 1/2 and like other review it still makes a lot.

I love these. I have made them 3 times and they are always the hit of the party (along with the hundred corner shrimp balls from this site). I reduced the recipe by a third and it still makes so many! I also just use one won ton wrapper and make them in to a triangle. It makes it an easier finger food.

I have made this multiple times and it is always a hit. I have swapped out the crab for other seafood like lobster and shrimp. Wonderful and adaptable recipe!

This is ONE FANTASTIC recipe! A huge hit - have made a couple of times, both with rave reviews. I serve these stacked on black plates, garnished with a few fresh chive flowers, and the whole works drizzled with the cranberry-teriyaki glaze. Absolutely wonderful

Definitely going to try this one! I lost a similar one made with fresh blueberries and served with a blended blueberry/honey dip. It was wonderful, so this is as close as I have seen, and I will just substitute the blueberries for the cranberries. Thanks!

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and it is always a huge hit. I don't put the crabmeat in and people just love it that way. No one misses the crab at all. The vegetarians love it!

Great recipe, definitely will make again. Made them for a party and they were all gone quickly. One note is this recipe easily calls for 3 packages of wonton wraps as I found I had plenty of the crab mix left over after the 2nd package.

I have made this recipe many many times because everyone LOVES them. It is a dish that can be served hot or cold but I must say hot is better.

This recipe is fabulous. Used 1# most succulent jumbo lump crab available, gently broken, and tweaked other measurements accordingly. Served w/Cran-Teriyaki Glaze recommended. HUGE FLAVOUR!
