This was wonderful, though I added a couple things: tossed a cube of Dorot frozen garlic (from Trader Joe's) into the noodle water in their last couple minutes of cooking (just to get the smallest hint of garlic) then drained it out. Then I added a couple handfuls of pine nuts into the browning butter - - this toasted them beautifully. I used a little less butter and added extra virgin olive oil to the butter after it was browned and had cooled a bit. Added sauteed portobello mushrooms and a couple cubes of frozen Dorot basil (again from TJs) with the browned butter/evoo/pinenut mixture. The basil melted in and was in such a small quantity, it wasnt seen and was barely detectable but added to the overall flavor. A sprinkle of salt and it was one of the best things Ive ever made. It gets tastier as it sits - - the leftovers have been terrific. Sorry Im giving four forks to an altered recipe - - I know that sends some people over the cliff!! But I like reading about the variations you all come up with and Im probably not going to make the recipe as written.

Not bad at all! I made mine with a clove of minced garlic, 2 tbsp of minced shallots, 3 tbsp minced italian parsley. When I make it again, I think I'll try adding a tbsp of tomato paste, and cutting the butter in half. Boyfriend isn't crazy about feta, but once he tried a bite, he asked for a bowl and scarfed it down.

Surprisingly good, considering its simplicity. We always add cooked asparagus, to round out a meal with meat. Try this even if you are not a bit feta fan. It is subtle, and just seems to add a slightly tangy creaminess.

easy and delicious side pasta. I usually add green onions or parsley to this.

This WAS good! I used a bit less butter and minced garlic like the others. I also added about a 1/2 c. chopped fresh spinach. It paired nicely with the feta, yummy.

This is wonderful and so easy. The feta really makes this interesting. Like one of the other reviewers suggested, I added some chopped garlic to the browned butter at the end. I also added a little chopped fresh parley at the very end. My husband scarfed it up like he was going to the electric chair, turned to me and said, "This is great! What's different?" When I told him the ingredients, he said he was glad I told him after the fact, because he probably wouldn't have tried it if he knew. He's a real purist when it comes to some things, like "buttered" noodles. He also said I should make them again -- soon and often.

This is so delicious - it is a typical Greek dish which I grew up on with the exception that I have never seen it with Feta but rather with another Greek cheese which is so delicious, called Mitzithra which you grate - I will make it tonight - brings back memories!

This is delicious with Plugra butter and good quality feta.

This dish is sooooo good! I've made it twice and got multiple requests for the recipe. It couldn't be easier. I splurged and used a double cream feta and an imported french butter. OMG! A definite keeper!

My husband, kids(5, 2, and 1 year old) and I all loved this! The only change I made was tossing in steamed, cut asparagus spears. I served it with grilled mango/chicken sausages and it rounded out the quick and easy, family-friendly meal perfectly!

Very good. Nothing not to like about noodles mixed with butter and feta cheese. No need to add salt either. But next time I make it I may saute some minced garlic in the butter (right before it's browned) and rosemary as one of the reviewers mentionned. Also add maybe 1/2 to 1 tsp hot sauce. I served the dish with meatloaf! Delish!

This was another recipe I was drawn to because it only takes a few ingredients. It was ok for what it was, better when i added pepper. Just kind of plain, probably wouldn't make it again unless I was desperate and had all the ingredients on hand.

The only thing better than the taste of this is the ease of preparation. I make this often, sometimes adding sauted chicken or seafood.

Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful! I didn't bother layering, just mixed it all together. It was a huge hit with everyone, including the kids. This is a keeper!

i grew up eating grilled feta cheese sandwiches - and this to me was pure heaven. the ultimate comfort food. made it last night for a solo dinner that was truly enjoyable. served with an arugula salad and greek red wine. it was fabulous and i can't wait for leftovers.

Wonderful recipe. I made it even simpler. I didn't layer anything. I melted the butter and mixed it with the noodles. Than I mixed the buttered noodles with the feta. I needed to keep the noodles warm for about two hours after I made them and kept them in the oven at 200F. I was concerned that they would dry out. No such thing. They came up perfect!!!! Big hit.

I love this dish! I make it often as an entree and serve it with french bread. If you put just a little rosemary in with the butter as you're browning it, it gives it just a little extra flavor. My whole family loves this dish!

A simple and very tasty dish. I added some sauteed mushrooms and served it with broiled grouper.
