I have been making lamb lentil stew for our family for a couple of years now. The first time I made it there were two recipes on this site and neither seemed quite right, so I sort of improvised my way between them. It is delicious, and the changes improve the color (for those concerned with presentation). I slow cook it but you could also cook it conventionally: 1 pound lamb shoulder, cubed 1 med/large yellow onion, diced 1/4-1/3 cub red wine vinegar 2-3 very large garlic cloves, minced (prob 3-5 T) 1 sq inch fresh ginger, finely chopped 1 T ground cumin 1 T curry powder 1/2 T garam masala 1/2 t ground cardamom 1/2 t ground dry mustard 1/4 t ground cloves 1/4-1/2 t cayenne pepper a few twists freshly ground black pepper 2-3 carrots, roughly chopped 1 C green lentils (dried) 2 C water or low so chicken broth 1 can no salt added diced tomatoes I browned the onions and lamb in a pan over high heat first to carmelize (be sure to heat the pan with a small amount of olive oil first, and then add when hot). put that in a slow cooker. pour the water or chicken broth into the pan to deglaze and then into the slow cooker too. Add everything else. stir around well. cover and cook for 6-8 hours on low. I served it with some (no sodium) sour cream.

My husband & I loved it. My son thought it was too hot -- it might do to cut the cumin in half. I've also made it in the crockpot and with the addition of three carrots diced and a small head of cauliflower cut in bite-sized pieces. This is a very adaptable recipe.

I would actually give this 2 1/2 forks - the secret is overcooking. I turn up the oven a bit and let more liquid bake off; it not only thickens the stew - it concentrates the flavor. I think the tomato mint chutney is a MUST with it.

Wanted to like it, didn't. Just didn't come together, taste that good.

I followed the directions here to a T, and it was just horribly gingery. I like ginger quite a bit, as does my boyfriend, but it was just too much for us. It also needed way more than a measly half cup of lentils. I had a lot of water left in the dish when it came out of the oven and I needed to thicken it up with cornstarch - extra lentils would have taken care of this...in general, with less ginger and more lentils this might have been good, but for the cost of the lamb I used and all the prep time (I even made the chutney too, which was good but couldn't save this recipe) it's just not worth it for me to try again.

I have to confess; I didn't buy the cardamom but still found this dish delicious. It was a bit tart though, so I might also try cutting back on the vinegar next time.

I made this dish with absolutely no modifications. Here are the modifications I'll make the second time: 1) decrease the amount of vinegar to about 1/4 - 1/3 cup. The final product was very tart. 2.) decrease the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon. The final dish was very, very HOT. 3.) attempt to do something to make the dish more visually appealing. Lamb + lentils = completely brown dish. The tomato chutney would have added some additional color. I did use a sprinkling of chopped cilantro for some green. The flavor combinations are great...just need a little modification for our tastes.

The second time I made this I used cinnamon instead of cloves. I have also made it on the stove top with twice as much liquid (as so much of it cooked off), carrots, and cauliflower. Very different but very tasty!

This was fabulous!! I liked the vinegar - didn't find it too strong. Unfortunately, it's not pretty -muddy brown with green lentils- but it tastes great.

Delish!I loved the vinegary spicy combination. Made it with chicken the second time - was just as good.

This dish is good, and very easy to prepare. Note that it's also low in fat. The ample gravy is very spicy, and we like it that way, but for those who are a bit timid, I'd suggest caution when adding the cayenne pepper. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and cut back on the vinegar, using 1/3 cup rather than the 1/2 cup called for. I served my lamb and lentils with plain basmati rice, and the tomato and red onion chutney recommended above (I reviewed the chutney recipe separately). I'd definitely make this again, especially when I have frozen lamb chunks (uncooked)in the freezer from a previous leg of lamb.

All the measurements were great for me. I used a lftover lamb steak. I served it with pine nut cous cous, and will make it again soon.

This dish had a very good flavor from the various spices. However, I thought that the vinegar was a bit too aggressive and the next time I made it I would only use half as much.

I thought this recipe was great!! I served it with plain couscous.
