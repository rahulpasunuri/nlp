The only thing this recipe needs (in my humble opinion) is about 2 Tbs tamari added to the sauteed onions, prior to adding the liquids. This cuts the sweetness described in a couple other reviews, adding a bit of meat-like umami depth to the flavor. You may prefer more or less tamari. If you're sensitive to salt, this will also most likely decrease the amount of salt you'll want to add.

The ratio of onion to broth was nice and hearty. However, it was a bit sweet and bland. We ended up having to add miso paste (soy sauce would also be better and add more depth than salt), sherry, and some balsamic vinegar to balance it. Overall it ended up quite nice, but too many modifications were needed.

I really wanted this to work because I've missed onion soup since I've been trying to eat more vegetarian. Like other reviewers, I found it too sweet. I'd love to figure out how to make it work though.

We made this for Christmas dinner for a first course. We loved it, so did all the dinner guests. It easily makes enough for 8 people. We made it the day before which made a huge difference, as one reviewer noted, there was a very suttle bitter after taste, but chilling the soup and then reheating it the next day took that away and the soup was perfect. We made it just as written, I actually doubled it, this worked out great too. I used a round sourdough loaf cut it into disks, brushed them with garlic butter and baked them until crisp, cut them up into large bite size croutons for the soup, topped them with grated gruyere cheese. We will make this again for sure.

I followed the recipe exactly and feel that there is not adequate broth for the amount of onions. I would reduce the onions by one since the broth is flavorful but I'm having to dilute it with water after broiling the crouton/cheese topping. I do like the soup, but I haven't decided whether I like this recipe better than the Moosewood Cookbook Onion Soup I usually make.

I followed the recipe exactly and it ended up way too sweet for my taste--between the onions, the beer, and the vegetable stock, there are a lot of natural sugars there. (Even after adding quite a bit of kosher salt.) Since I don't have concerns about adding meat, I'll try it with beef stock next time.

Great recipe, but the beer makes it a bit too bitter for me. A bit of sugar fixes things.

Delicious! I have found that a good substitute for the Chimay Blue is Blue Moon, which is available in most grocery stores these days. Also, a bit of grated orange rind on top of the hot cheese or into the soup directly just prior to serving adds a joyous note.

They explain in the description the Chimay Blue is a Belgian ale. http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/215/2512

Wow, delicious. I've been missing French onion soup since I stopped eating meat... the beer in this recipe gives it terrific flavor. I had no veggie broth so just used water--even so, richly flavored. Yum!
