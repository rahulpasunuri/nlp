These were just ok. The pastry was flaky and crispy but I thought it needed more salt. I was able to blend the pastry in the food processor and that saved some time. As for the filling... well, I thought it was dry and lacking in flavor. I used Spanish chorizo fyi. Next time I will use this dough but change of the filling. More meat, no potatoes and maybe add some gravy to keep them moist.

I'd like to correct the spelling of the title: in the word "empanadas" there is no tilda over the in (in other words, there is no "ñ". It's just "empanadas". :-)

I used Mexican chorizo and took it to a party where there were many Mexicans. They were a huge hit. My 12 year old insisted I make more the next day. I used Spanish chorizo this time and they were equally as good.

This was good. I used a 9cm round container to cut out the pastry rounds for smaller empanadas. I also used my pasta machine to roll out the dough (to setting 5).

I only made the dough and used my own filling. It was alright, the taste was okay and they looked gorgeous very flaky and golden, but I dont know about the smell. I continue my search for the perfect empanada dough.

To the cook from Los Altos, it sounds like you bought Mexican chorizo rather than Spanish. There is a big difference in texture. See if you can find the Spanish (which is much more firm and dry). I haven't tried this yet, so can't comment whether that will help the flavor! Good luck.

This was an easy recipe to prepare but the end result was disappointing. I don't think it is flavorful enough. Also, not sure if I used the right chorizo (I purchased it in the grocery store) but it wasn't pieces that you remove with a slotted spoon. More creamy consistency. Could not find the empandadas discs anywhere as a reviewer below suggested.

Takes time, but fairly Easy. Better than the ones I have been buying from a local market.

These turned out really well, and actually looked as great as they tasted. I used a meat substitute instead of the chorizo, and was very pleased with the results. The linked dough recipe is also excellent, though it doesn't really yield twelve empanadas; closer to nine or ten with a bit of the filling left over. Very good though.

Hi there, sorry for my spelling, Im from caribbean and I have a tip for you. Sometimes you want to eat "empanadas" but lazy to do it, specially the dough, go to a spanish store and ask for "Discos para Empanadas" it is the dough already done, you just have to fill it. Also try deep fried until golden brown, they taste better, after fried just put the empanadas over wax paper to get off the oil, they are delicious, also you can fill it with ground beef and raisins and regular fried.

Try it with soyrizo. Tastes just like chorizo but no meat in it. Great for all us vegetarians!

Ahem... the recipe for the empanada dough is right there. Just click the words "empanada dough" and you will be sent to the recipe. Couldn't find Spanish chorizo and Mexican chorizo is too moist. Had to use smoked sausage instead.

The recipe for the dough is a link! I've made chorizo empanadas before (my recipe) and they are great, but then again anything in an empanada is great! Curry with chicken and potatoes sounds great, but I'd hesistate to add it to the flavors already in chorizo.

Recipe needs FLOUR for the dough. Where is your editor?

Did I miss something? The only thing in the dough is Eggs with WATER? Or are you supposed to use a premade disk?
