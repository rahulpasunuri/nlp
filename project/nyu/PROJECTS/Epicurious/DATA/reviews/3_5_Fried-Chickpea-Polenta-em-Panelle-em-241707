The polenta was tasty with a lovely texture, but I don't feel it was worth the whisking (it took me 30 mins) and frying (messy). If you haven't, I highly recommend making socca (Mark Bittman's recipe is amazing: http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/19/dining/191mrex.html). It's a baked/broiled pancake made with chickpea flour that is easier, quicker, and has more taste than this does. Also, in case you were wondering, 1/2 lb of chickpea flour = 1 and 4/5 cups

I lived in Sicily in high school and remember loving penelle. These, sadly, did not come close. The texture and shape were correct, but they were entirely lacking in flavor. I used Bob's Red Mill Garbanzo Bean flour, and added chopped parsley. I tried them fried and baked. They were fun to make, but not worth the effort.

Made the chickpea batter the night before, and let it chill overnight. Great way to cut carbs. I served with ratatouille. I'm going vegetarian lo-carb for the next few weeks and I don't think my family will even notice if I can find more recipes like this!

Lacking in flavor.

This has become a staple at my house. I use it as a high protein pasta. However, I don't buy chickpea flour. I just buy whole dry chickpeas & grind them up in the blender to make the flour.

I found chickpea flour in the east indian food section of the grocery store (chana flour) so I don't know if I should have looked for an Italian type of chickpea flour or what, but...this was awful. They had a bitter taste that I couldn't get past, and I ended up throwing them out. I would not make this again, unless it was a poor quality flour or something.

I made this recipe two ways: last night I fried as directed, and today I baked the rest, and both versions were delicious. I baked for 15 minutes at 350, flipping once, and then broiled for a couple of minutes to brown. I also made a dipping sauce out of mayo, garlic, chili powder...so good! Will make often.

This is delicious. But, you do have to stir stir stir *forever* just like with polenta.

I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED THIS DISH. I COULD ONLY SAMPLE THIS IN A SELECT FEW RESTARAUNTS. NOW MY FAMILY AND I CAN ENJOY IT ANYTIME. THANKS LIDIA

Wonderful! In my native Ethiopia, the Lenten season for Orthodox Christians is signfied by abstinence of all animal products - meat, eggs, milk and milk products etc. We make a variety of vegetarian dishes, one of which is a similar dish (which translates into faux scrambled eggs) that is made almost in a similar manner. I love watching Lidia's show on PBS. Love this dish!
