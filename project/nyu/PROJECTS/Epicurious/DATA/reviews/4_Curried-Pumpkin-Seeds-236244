I just made these for the 5th straight year and for the last 3 they've been a huge hit with friends and my now 6 year old nephew (who just threw a fit because I wasn't there to make them this year). I guess I can say they've become a tradition.

Every time I make this for a party, I get request for the recipe. It has a strong flavor but is so good with cocktails and beer.

I love love LOVE these and make them every year. I can't believe I haven't reviewed them before. I use a bag of the raw pepitas from Trader Joes and snack on these all throughout the fall. They are delicious on salads, or just with cocktails, especially for a Halloween party. I find them completely addicting!

WOW! I normally don't like pumpkin seeds at all, but this recipe is amazing. I did make a few pantry changes, I used lemon juice instead of lime and brown sugar instead of granulated. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I didn't have quite enough pumpkin seeds so I threw a few pretzels in the left over mix. It was awesome. I think I've found a new recipe for Chex Mix.

Holy Pumpkin Party! These are quite tasty and very easy. I get requests for them every year. The only drawback is that it will make your house smell like curry for days. I like curry, but it the smell gets old.

Easy and quick to make. Loved the flavor. Will definitely make this on a regular basis. Notes I made to my recipe: 1TB lime juice requires 1/2 a lime, 12 oz pumpkin seeds is approx 350g

Delish, and so easy. We live in a small flat in London and the whole place did smell like curry for days! I think these would be nice in a pretty jar with a ribbon to present to a host of a party as a little gift.

I love this recipe! I wasn't exact on the measurements and added a tad more cayenne. They were a big hit on Thanksgiving Day. I made more and have been putting them on salads!

I made these using a garam masala spice rub from Seattle chef Tom Douglas. I doubled the recipe and these were fabulous. Everyone wants them again.

Oh my goodness these are good. I just made them and they are still warm. I used raw pepitas (hulled pumpkin seeds) and it actually took the full time --- I stirred several times. Love them.

Delicious, and a nice kick!

I am not a fan of pumpkin seeds, but I really liked this. I served it at Thanksgiving, and again this week (March, 2007) for a simple snack to have with drinks. Everyone loved it. Gave the recipe away to one guest. Would probably not bake as long in the oven. But great flavor and (I hope) a healthy alternative.

Love these...I made them as a pre-dinner munchy for Thanksgiving day & I came back today to find the recipe again so I can make some more. Even the people in my family who claim not to like curry enjoyed them too. Super easy to prepare & I agree with some previous posters that a little less time in the oven is just fine.

Everyone at the party loved these and asked for recipe. Easy to make and wonderful.

I liked the recipe. Perhaps other people's curry powder was old? It can lose a lot of flavor if it is stale. Anyway, everyone liked it at our Thanksgiving get together--they were good munchies. Agree with everyone else that 24 minutes is too long. Also, that person who made it with marcona almonds...almonds cook faster than pumpkin seeds, different density and all that. If you are going to change the recipe, allow for the different ingredients by adjusting your cooking time, as needed.

Agree with other reviewers. This definitely does not need to be in the oven for 24 minutes. 15 - 20 would be fine.

Easy to make but I expect more taste. I think I will add some more items to it and make it again.

This recipe is a nice variation on spiced nuts for entertaining, and open to all sorts of improvisation: add Garam Masala, lime zest, up the pepper, use Marcona Almonds, BUT WATCH THE TIMING IN THE OVEN. It must be a typo... maybe it should read 2 to 4 minutes? Still seems a bit short, but after about 10 at that temperature the seeds and egg whites will burn.
