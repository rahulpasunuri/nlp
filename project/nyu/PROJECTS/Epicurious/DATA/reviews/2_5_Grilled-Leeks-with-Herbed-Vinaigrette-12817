It's important to pre-cook these a bit before grilling -- I had several really large/thick leeks, so I increased the boiling time to about 10 minutes. One warning: Keep that heat moderate (I had several leeks where a layer burned to a crisp). But I agree with another reviewer that you're easily on your own after that. I brushed these while grilling with a garlic olive oil, then served them dressed lightly with a homemade Greek dressing -- scrumptious!

We prepared the leeks as the recipe directs, but served them with just a bit of a basic dijon vinaigrette. Much less work and very good as a side with any grilled meat.

This was okay, but not a keeper. I think leeks taste better complimenting other food not as their own dish.
