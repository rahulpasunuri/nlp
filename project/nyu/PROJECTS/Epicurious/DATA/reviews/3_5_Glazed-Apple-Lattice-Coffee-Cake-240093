I made this recipie with honeycrisp apples which provided WAY too much juice within the pan, I had to boil the apples down for a bit longer than asked for. I also added a sprinkling of sharp cheddar cheese on the top of the filling. The dough rose as the directions stated and the overall result was DELICIOUS! The cake was a big hit at the church potluck. I will be making this recipe again in the near future!

I just attempted this recipe to bring to a holiday brunch event. The dough was definitely tricky. After waiting for 2 1/2 hours with no notable result after the first rise, I scrapped it and made it again from scratch, thinking I did something wrong to kill the yeast. After trying again and leaving it overnight covered and over a hot water bath the 2nd time around, I found it worked and the dough did double in size...nothing notable after 2 hours, but ~6 hours later, I had the result I was looking for. I put it together the morning of the brunch...didn't really see any notable difference after the second rise when looking for "light and puffy." But it came together well and looked quite professional...tasted fine and was easily done after 30 min. in the oven. I had dry ladyfingers on hand and crushed those up, and opted not using all the juices from the apple mixture. Tasted very good overall...not knock your socks off, but good. Nice addition to the table.

While waiting for tropical storm Ida to arrive I decided to try this recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfectly...almost as pretty as the picture. Tasted delicious. My husband's exact word was fabulous.

Nice recipe, though not stellar. I've made it twice- funny that I had no troubles the first time around, and it rose pretty quickly then too. The second time the dough was way sticky and I ended up using much more flour than called for. But this is a sweet dough, so it is sticky. And yes, it does take a l-o-n-g time to rise...just be patient. I had some frozen apples from my Gravenstein tree, and had quite a bit of juice in the filling. I poured that off and cooked it down with a little cornstarch before adding it back to the apples. I think the orange peel and cardamon do much for the flavor of this coffee cake. Now that we've tried it twice, I'll keep it for the file but I 'm ready to try something else.

We LOVED this. I used Gala apples instead of Golden Delicious, because they have more flavor to me, but I followed the recipe exactly in all other ways, and it was both beautiful and delicious. The citrus plus the spices combined with the caramelly apple flavor was divine. I can't imagine putting more spices in it, as some reviewers suggest, because it would overpower the balance of flavors. You want spice cake, make that instead, this is something different. The dough did take a long time, so next time, (if I wanted to eat this for brunch and not dessert) I would prepare the dough and stick it in the fridge overnight for its FIRST rising, then take it out and make the filling plus do the second rise in the morning. Without glaze it wouldn't be very sweet, so you can control sweetness with how much glaze you put on. (oh, yeah, I guess there is another thing I modified; I made a plain glaze with a little vanila, not orange juice, because I didn't want such a powerful orange flavor) Would be great with some good plain European yogurt and nice dark roast Cafe Au Lait.

I made this last year when I received the magazine. It looks perfect when it comes out. I found the taste to be rather blander than I would have liked. I would try to make it again after increasing the spices.

This was an excellent recipe. It does take time, as the recipe states, so just be patient. Sweet doughs are always slower to rise. I made mine and formed it the night before, put it in the fridge and baked it in the morning. Mine turned out looking just like the picture. The cardamom was subtle, but added an interesting flavor--my guests noticed something good and different, but not sure what. I will definitely make this again.

I made this dish with frozen berries. Unfortunately I didn't get the desired rise out of my dough as I forgot the proper conversion of yeast packets to yeast teaspoons. So my dough was more of a crust. I did not do any glaze either as it is just way too much sugar for me. I may try to do it again sometime.

The main downside to this recipe is the amount of time required for the dough to rise. I made the mistake of thinking I could make it in one evening. I think the recipe needs more apples, and only about half the amount of glaze.

A nice recipe - the cardamom and orange and lemon zest really make it special. We had no problems getting the dough to rise - left it out for two hours, then stuck it in the fridge overnight before assembling the next morning. We found the apple filling to be MUCH TOO SWEET - all that brown sugar totally overwhelmed the more subtle flavors. Next time we'll probably cut the sugar back by 50-75%. It looks great, and would be a nice thing to bring if invited to spend a weekend with friends.

I loved this recipe! The dough was rich, but not overly sweet or heavy. I would probably put more apples in the center next time and roll the dough out thinner. I loved the cardamom in the dough. I didn't have any problems getting the dough to rise, although it is a very slow process. Also, I nixed the glaze - instead I washed the top with milk and sprinkled it with turbinado sugar. Wonderful!

Whew! Took some work to get this dough to rise. Be sure to use high-glutin flour (like bread flour) and find a warm place for the dough to rise and it should work. Wonderful result! Definitely will make again.

Excellent cake. I waited almost half an hour for the milk mixture to cool before adding the yeast, and the dough rose very well. The cake is even better the next day. Many thanks to those who translated the yeast amounts.

Excellent. Hint: pinch of powdered ginger in yeast always helps start rising. Really played with recipe: water instead of milk, 2 whole eggs, 1 cup whole wheat & 1 cup white flour - got horrible sticky mess, kept adding white flour - about 1 cup more. Part way through first rise had to go out, so put in refrigerator - continued later - rose extremely well. Suspect problems others had may be milk solution too hot when adding yeast, or only rising 'normal' yeast bread times - this recipe calls for almost double usual time. [Would start in evening and refrigerate overnight next time -finish next day.] Husband put apricot jam on his pieces instead of glaze - delicious.

This is a great recipe. I have started making my bread doughs in my bread machine. Put all ingredients for the dough in a bread machine (with a dough cycle).BE SURE TO PUT THE DRY YEAST IN LAST. Run this through the complete cycle then make the cake.

I attempted to make this cake twice and it never rose so I never got to step two with the apples. I thought it would be too doughy. I was glad to read that it didn't rise for anyone else. Any suggestions on ways to improve the dough part?

I haven't made this yet, but am adding 3 fork rating so that I don't upset the user rating. For the cook asking about the yeast packets: I envelope of dry yeast is 1/4 ounce and equals 2 1/4 tsps or 1 cake of fresh yeast (0.6oz). Hope this helps!

I`ve been using fresh yeast for a long time/using warm milk/water+ sugar and yeast/, but as it`s easier to keep the dry yeast on hand all the time I started using the dry one. I have been advised to make sure that it`s active, even with proper storage etc. it is possible it`s dead. So I do so every time, using a bit of sugar and warm water. I admit water temperature can be tricky but I really don`t think there is something wrong with my suggestion of putting sugar in water with yeast&almost all the recipes ask for the same thing and from my experience it makes it easier for me, just to be sure. I`m not a professional baker as  A cook from Australia but I do bake quite frequently. I made this cake with apricots as well and it turned out to be fantastic too. Next I'm going to try a chocolate walnut filling.Can`t wait.:-) THERE IS 1/4 OZ ( 7Grams) in 1 US package.

How much yeast is there is one US package?

Disregard what "A Baker" below says about having to add sugar or honey to activate the yeast. This is patently untrue. I am a professioanl baker and the only reason many recipes do ask you to add sugar to the yeast and water mixture is in order to determine within a few minutes whether the yeast is alive or not. If the yeast you are using is not past its sell by date and has been refrigerated then it should allow the dough to rise regardless if there is sugar or not. Perhaps those who had poor results used water that was too hot and in doing so, killed the yeast before it could rise.

This wasn't as rich or as satisfying as I'd hoped it would be. I'm going to make this again but try putting another egg and more sugar in the dough and reserving some of the carmel from the apples to drizzle on top.

It didn't rise that much for me either. I tried a couple of tricks from making regular pizza dough, but still not a 2x rise. It did puff some. Next time I will bake it on parchment instead of foil. Some of you real cooks may have been smart enough to spray the sheet pan as well; I just follow directions.

when working with yeast you need some sugar or honey to active it, the recipe says only to put yeast in warm water so if you add some sugar/1 tsp-1tbl/ it should work and the dough should rise. good luck.

(OK, Epicurious, your "edit" function doesn't work--I am having to complete retype my review.) This is a great cake with awesome flavors & wonderful texture, but like Treeshar, mine didn't rise at all. The flavors are unique--spicy, but not your usual apple pie spices--I think it's the cardamom. The vanilla wafers in the middle are also a good idea, because there is a LOT of juice generated by this recipe, and they help to absorb some of them. Still, I had runoff, but it still ended up being yummy. If I make this again, I am going to make two, because it was gobbled up in like 30 seconds. This one is a definite keeper.

This is really rich, everyone raved at how professional it looked (and mine didn't look nearly as good as the one in the picture) but for some reason I couldn't get it to rise. Still delicious. I've made it twice and it's not even October 2007 yet.
