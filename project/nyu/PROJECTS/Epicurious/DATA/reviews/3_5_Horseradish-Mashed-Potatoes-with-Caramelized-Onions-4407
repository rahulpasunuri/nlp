Excellent recipe. I'm not sure why the note refers to sweet onions and the recipe calls for white?? Regardless, the result is company worthy.

Quite disappointing. There was a time when I could plan a fabulous meal based on the rating and reviews of epicurious cooks. But it is clear to me that the caliber of cook reviewing recipes at this site has declined.

This dish was fabulous! I added more butter and milk than recommended and it was just lovely. I also made it heavy with horseradish and it really gave it a kick. The onions gave the whole dish a very very nice touch.

Incredibly good! This actually came together very quickly -- within 40 minutes including prep and cook time. For those who had trouble with the caramelized onions, yes, the cast iron skillet is very helpful. It's also critical to refrain from stirring them frequently -- try to leave them alone for at least a few minutes at a time. We had this with steamed spinach and sauteed turkey andouille sausage. The only bad news is that there are no leftovers!

I made this with butter-substitute and low-fat milk, and they still turned out fantastic. I agree with previous reviewers, double the onions because they go fast!

I made a double batch of the onions to snack on because I knew these were going to be awesome! They were! I served these during Christmas dinner and my guests LOVED them. Since I'm staying away from dairy, I substituted plain, unsweetened soy milk for the milk with fabulous results. Don't hesitate to try this recipe.

Horseradish is a lovely addition to potatoes, and added to carmalized onions is just divine. I prefer just normal carmalized onions rather than the balsamic and thyme addition however.

I made the carmelized onions and thought they were delicious with the potatoes. I would also add 3-4 Tbsp butter when you mash them. The onions made it out of this world.

Served with lamb for Christmas dinner. Horseradish adds subtle flavor. Onions are INCREDIBLE! Pair amazingly with the potatoes. Had compliments from the whole table!

The caramelized onions are to die for. They'd also be great as a topping for meat, fish, or chicken.

Disappointing dish. The vinegar I thought totally out of place and I didn't like the horseradish together with the potatoes. Try the Mustard and Spring Onion Mash from this site. Really much better.

I would make the Caramelized Onion portion of this recipe as the family loved that part of this recipe. However we enjoyed the Horseradish Mashed Potatoes dated September 1998 on this same website. It has more horseradish and is a little richer. Though it has whipping cream, we don't have mashed potatoes that often to warrant substitution.

Pretty borning recipe. I juiced it up as much as I could, but still, boring. Bummer, because the previous reviews were so good and it LOOKED good, but boring. Even after trying to spice it and season, still blah. Would be good for someone whose tastes run bland.

A favorite that we do every year for Thanksgiving (along with traditional mashed for those who don't like horseradish). Easiest way to thinly slice the onions is by using the slicer blade in a food processor. Recipe works great with White Rose potatoes, and you don't need to peel them (that's where all the nutrients are, anyway).

Yum, these were so good! The carmelized onions were a perfect topping and really made the dish. Had never added horseradish to mashed before but it was fantastic. Also threw in some freshly grated parmesan. Will never make regular mashed again.

Very good twist to ordinary mashed potatoes. Turning the heat up to get the onions to caramelize faster doesn't harm them one bit (see recent issue of Cook's Illustrated). Added white cheddar, garlic, a bit of cream, and paprika to yukon golds. Everyone loved it.

Personally, I didn't have anything against the potatoes, but my family didn't care for them at all. The caramelized onions though, were delicious. We all agreed on that. I had no trouble getting them to caramelize within the 30 minutes indicated by the recipe. I think the clue was in using a cast iron skillet instead of a non-stick one. Things tend to brown better in this old-fashioned cooking utensil.

These potatoes are even better when made with Yukon Gold Potatoes. The last time I made this dish, I added whipped cream cheese, a beaten egg, and heavy cream to the potatoes - DELICIOUS! I made the potatoes a day early, and, after bringing to room temperature, baked for 40 minutes at 375. I also made the onions a day early, warmed them in the microwave and added them to the potatoes. This dish makes a great accompaniment to Varkenshaas (Pork Tenderloin with Mustard Sauce) which you can find in the September, 1996, issue of Gourmet or on Epicurious.

DELICIOUS!!! I made these potatoes for Thanksgiving and they were certainly a crowd favorite. Be prepared - the onions take a long time to cook. I made them a day ahead of time and would reccomend that to anyone making this recipe. Also, to get the onions very thin I used a mandoline slicer. An absolutely delicious and different mashed potato recipe.

I would defintely make this dish again. My mother chopped up the leftover onions and mixed them in with the mashed potatoes. If there is a person that does not like onions that may be a problem, and I think it looks much prettier when served the original way but they tasted great the second night, also! Just a suggestion for someone that is older and may have trouble chewing.

Excellent recipe. Just to be sure to double (or triple) the amount of time it says to take to carmelize the onions.

Rating: 4
Made these potatoes to go along with Peter Kelly's Easter ham. It was fantastic. Have to admit, I cheated and used Idahoan butter and herbed packaged mashed potatoes because I had a lot of other cooking to do. The potatoes still turned out super. Carmelizing the onions took me 1 1/4 hrs. so be prepared.

Fantastic! This dish was wonderful with my corned beef this year. I'd recommend it to accompany any roast. The onions do take some time to nicely carmelize. And I added all the milk plus a cup of sour cream to the potatoes for extra richness. I'd also recommend buttering the dish well. A make-ahead favorite.

I made this dish to complement Bon Appetit's December 2000 recipe for Garlic Herb Crusted New York Strip Roast. I served both to about 16 family members on Christmas Eve--and it was the BOMB!! The carmelized onions were the best and my pan was left completely empty. The horseradish amount in the potatoes was just enough to lend zing without being over-powering--and it was PERFECT for the beef!! My immediate family has been begging me to make it again ever since! I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who wants an awesome side dish to complement beef!!

ZOWIE!!!! Unbelievably good! It took a lot longer than 30 minutes to caramelize the onions, but well worth the extra time.

We first used this recipe as part of our "millenium meal". A year later, it remains a favorite of my two teenagers. The onions and horseradish elevate this dish to greatness!

Don't make it if you want leftovers; it is really that good. I did not add the horseradish and it was still excellent.

I made this for Thanksgiving alonside an old family favorite and this one clearly won. Once when reheating a frozen batch I also broiled the top which gave the onions a lightly crunchy crust which we all enjoyed.

I didn't have fresh thyme or balsamic vinegar so I used brown sugar and white wine vinegar. I served it with the filet mignon w/ merlot sauce recipe that I also found on this site. Delicious

The carmalized red onions on this were fabulous! If you like horseradish, be careful! Too much can be overpowering with the potatoes.

This so good!! It is better than the other Bon Appetit recipe in Sep 98. This has SOOOOO much more flavor!!! Another keeper.

We made these potatoes as a part of our Christmas meal - with "Rib Roast with Roasted-Garlic Thyme Sauce" (check that out too). They very good, and complimented the beef perfectly. The onion part was so good that when I make it again, I think I'll probaly increase the onion-mix amount by 50 percent. Also, it was really nice to have this "out of the way" during the final prep time in the kitchen.

I made this recipe on New Years Day, and it was a hit! I love mashed potatoes, and this went very well with the Honey Mustard and Rosemary Pork Roast. It was even better that I could make it ahead of time! A definate crowd pleaser!

Absolutely loved these potatoes! My guests thought they were great. I like the recipe because you can make it ahead of time. I added extra butter because it seemed to need it. The horseradish flavor is excellent.

The recipe got rave reviews. We used red potatoes instead of regular potatoes so we wouldn't have to peel them. They still came out wonderful.

The onions make this dish. I thought the potatoes needed a bit more butter for flavor so before heating in the oven I added a few pats of butter.

I did these potatoes for Thanksgiving and everyone liked them. I used red bliss potatoes. I read reviews and made the onions the night before, it worked out well. Thanks. I would serve this again.

Great side dish, which goes particularly well with mustard rack of lamb. Quite handy because it can be made in advance of guests arriving, and heated in a 350 oven - one less thing to worry about. Also, good to vary the amount of horseradish to taste - I typically use about 1.5X the specified amount.

delicious side dish, the onions give off an excellent contrast, however it is a lot of onions to slice, but worth shedding a few tears while preparing.

The horseradish is surprisingly subtle.
