I read the rave reviews of this recipe and thought it must be good. I did take note of 1/2 cup of vinegar? I made the dressing and it was horrible tasting...something like mustard flavored vinegar. I cut the vinegar to less than 1/4 cup and the mustard to a teaspoon and it was very good. I rolled my goat cheese in breadcrumbs (from a box) and then egg white and again in bread crumbs. They held together very nicely during the cooking. I also did not like the taste of so much watercress.

I haven't made this yet but it sounds wonderful and the reviews are very helpful. Living abroad has its advantages when buying certain things such as goat cheese. It already comes in small portions ready to brown in a skillet. Maybe at some specialty shops you could find pre-portioned goat cheese. Good luck!

This salad was so good and easy to make. Will buy different goat cheese next time, the one i used lost its shape quickly and made a mess - but was still delicious! The dressing really compliments the sweetness of the pear. Very good!

Well, I actually haven't made the recipe but DID eat at Chives in Brookings and must report that the meal we had was delicious including the Pear, Watercress & Endive salad. I've replicated the dressing at home and served it with a similar (but not exact) salad and the results were just as good without the excitement...while I enjoyed my meal at Chives, my husband ended up in anaphalactic (did I spell that right?) shock and was quite miserable the remainder of the evening. He blames it on the watercress but it could have been any number of items he had that evening. Oh well...

The taste, texture and presentation are very pleasant. Non-stick skillet a must for the cheese! The goat cheese stuck to the pan (I did not use non-stick skillet) and I had a terrible time getting them to keep shape. The cheese dried out and was crumbly, though still quite tasty.
