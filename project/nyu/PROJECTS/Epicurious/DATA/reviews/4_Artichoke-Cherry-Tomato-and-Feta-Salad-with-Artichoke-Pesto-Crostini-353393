This salad & crostini was a little bit of work but worth it. You can make much of it ahead of time and then just assemble when your guests arrive. I definitely followed the others and reduced the oil considerably. I made the dressing the same day but it was pretty strong. I would make it the day before and keep in the fridge to allow the flavours to mellow a bit. I definitely will make this again.

Lovely salad that goes with lots and lots of dishes while adding something to the meal in its own right.Next time I may add more garlic or something to the pesto to give it a little more kick. I also agree with a previous comment that there is probably a bit too much oil in the recipe. I reduced it to 1/2 a cup and could've reduced it even more for my taste - especially since some of the artichokesI used were marinated in oil. It went down very very well even for people who don't usually eat a lot of salad.

I really liked this! Refreshing change from the same-old same-old side salad. It also made a ton of extra dressing. Only qualm I have is that the salad dressing could've used less oil - I don't think it needed to be QUITE so heavy.

This salad dressing is marvelous. I made the dressing the night before, then doubled the salad ingredients to serve to my garden club's Christmas luncheon. A big success!

I have made this salad three times or so and it really is delicious! I found that adding pine nuts to the pesto really added to the flavor. I threw in a handful, maybe 2-3 tbs. Also using a food processor makes it better. The first time I used the Tupperware Quick Chef which is hand powered.(it is awesome for chopping onions) Much better results for this with a food processor as recommended. On the Crostini I added a lttle Smart Balance spread and garlic salt or powder. Really good! One time made it w/o the crostini/pesto and my husband wanted the crostini.

I love this salad. I could eat it every day. The salad dressing is SOOO good and blends nicely with the other ingredients. I have served it at several parties and it is always a big hit. My friends and I fight over the leftovers. Oh, IMHO, skip the artichoke pesto/crostini. Lots of work, no one knew what they were, and not worth the effort. Without them, this recipe is easy, easy.

Salad was very easy to make. Extremely tasty. Was not too impressed with the Artichoke pesto. So had the salad with the crostini themselves. Was great. The guests loved it ...

The salad dressing is great and the presentation is pretty. Also, loved the crostini. They will be a regular in my appetizer rotation. I tried broiling a few of the toasts with the pesto and both may husband and I preferred the unbroiled version. For what it's worth!

This is a really simple, delicious recipe. Everyone raved over the artichoke pesto and the dressing.

The whole eco-chic menu was yummy, but this was the best part. The salad dressing was yummy and the crostini was a great idea. Will definitely save the dressing for other salads. I will be making this salad again.
