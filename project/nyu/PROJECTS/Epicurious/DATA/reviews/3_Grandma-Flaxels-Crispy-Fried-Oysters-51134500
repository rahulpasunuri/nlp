This was very disappointing. I love fried oysters and I was excited when I saw this but all my guests and I tasted was the coating....not the oysters. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fine...just not the yummy oyster tasting fried oysters I and my guests were expecting.

Simple and declious, served with a creole remoulade.
