Before I tried this dish, I'd only had radishes in my salads. My girlfriend cannot stand raw radishes, so I tried this dish (had TONS of radishes in the garden). Although she was very skeptical, she (and I) really liked the dish. I would double the sugar next time.

I love this recipe and have been passing it along to friends left and right. I also made it with some white turnips and it was delicious.

Like others, I've never had cooked radishes before. We have a bumper crop from the garden this year so I was just searching to see if there was anything that could be done other than slicing for salads. We liked this recipe a lot and will be making it again. It added some nice color to the plate also.

A wonderful recipe for using our garden's abundance of radishes. Tastes like a cross between turnip and squash. My husband really liked this dish. We will most definately make this again.

I've made these several times now. They don't even remotely taste like radishes. No bite at all! I used a little less radishes and tweaked the sugar up to 2 teaspoons. I also find that if you brown them slightly they taste even better.

My 1st esperience eating cooked radishes. Very tasty - much milder than raw. Recipe can easily be downsized & definitely a keeper

I would never eat raw radished but these sauteed radishes are absolutely delicious. The cooking tames the bite and the sugar makes them just very slightly sweet. I think they should be eaten immediately, not left over or warmed up. Delicious.
