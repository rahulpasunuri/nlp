This soup is all of the above and below, but mostly it is one of my very best friends - loved and treasured.

This is my go-to onion soup recipe. Yes, the onions take a lot longer to caramelize than stated here. I was told by a local chef that they microwave the cheese a little (not too much) before they put it in the oven so the cheese melts down the sides of the bowls. Pulling that crispy cheese of the bowl is my husbands favorite part. I've also used Provolone for the cheese if I don't have Gruyere on hand.

Good, but it takes way longer than 25 minutes to caramelize onions--more like an hour and a half! I made my soup with half yellow onions and half sweet vidalia. I wish I'd omitted the water or added less--once I started tasting the soup after the addition of the broth and water, I realized it was overly watery and threw in some extra caramelized onions I had in the freezer. I'd also suggest adding more salt to the onions in the beginning to suck out the water and speed the caramelization.

You know how that last French Onion Soup really disappointed you? This one will not! I used more thyme, 50% vidalia onions/50% yellow onions, and about a half a stick of butter. Those are the only changes I made. I wanted the extra sugar from the vidalia's to caramelize the onions, without going too sweet on the soup. It was a good balance. Great recipe.

Excellent! The broth is flavorful and easy to make, and the cheese is perfect. I would agree with another reviewer that you need to make sure the soup is very hot before adding the cheese and putting it under the broiler.

Very good. Definitely took at least an hour to caramelize the onions. I found the sweet onions to be a bit too sweet for the recipe. Would like to try it with regular onions next time.

Rating: 4
After simmering, don't forget to crank up the heat on the soup prior to topping with the Gruyere so it has the excellent hotness that you break through to. By just putting it under the broiler, it won't heat up sufficiently before the cheese is ready to pull out of the oven. Otherwise, this recipe is spot on. Agree to the caramelizing but it's been said so often I'll let it go without further saying.

I keep coming back to this recipe...AMAZING. The caramelized onions are worth the wait. I usually double or triple the recipe.

This was good! It was easy to make and made the kitchen smell fantastic! I also added some chopped garlic to the onions, and instead of a whole bay leaf, I used chopped bay leaves, very good and already gave the recipe to my sister-in-law to try! For another great soup recipe, try this one: http://www.gourmetrecipe.com/recipes/acorn-squash-soup for creamy and full of rich soup.

This has become my "go to" French Onion Soup recipe and I routinely double it. The quality of the soup is greatly enhanced by using homemade beef stock and caramelizing the onions. Carmelizing takes patience but is well worth the effort. I recommend using sweet onions if you can find them, milder in flavor and I find they seem to caramelize easier. You can enhance the richness of store bought stock by whisking in a couple Tbsps of beef base. Get the best Gruyere you can find.

A fantastic dinner for two. Easy yet so rewarding! We will definitely make it again.

Excellent soup, do let the onions carmelize for at least an hour. Fantastic, and loved by everyone who tried it.

Rating: 4
This is authentic French onion soup - delicious. I doubled the recipe but used 3 pounds of onions and extra fresh thyme. I omitted the water and used beef stock for all of the liquid. As other reviewers have recommended, I carmelized the onions for an hour, first over medium heat and then low heat for the last 15 minutes. Carmelizing onions takes much longer than 25 to 30 minutes! Even picky DH loved it.

Rating: 4
I made this pretty much as written, but took 1 1/4 hours to carmelize the onions, and honestly, they could have gone longer, and I added a splash of cognac. Will make again, although will double the recipe, as this was a little short for my onion soup bowls.

Rating: 4
Making all those onions correctly takes way longer than the recipe says it does. WAY longer. However, I'm so happy it's getting cold again, so I can make this. That's all you really need to know about my opinion of this soup.

DEEEEE-licious!!! I was looking to find a way to use the thyme I'm growing, this was a fantastic way. Just yummy. Changes I made: I used 1 1/2 T butter since the amount wasn't listed. Also skipped the water and used 3 cups of beef broth instead, also used a medium-oaky Chard (Gloria Ferrer) and used 3/4. It was fantastic, I also ate both servings myself

Delicious. And so thankful for the suggestion to really, really caramelize the onions. SO flavorful and easy.

This was delicious. I am reading other reviews and see that I should have let the onions caramelize and cook longer than I did. I followed the directions and my onions weren't deep amber so I thought I did something wrong. I love this soup, though!

This is the onion soup recipe I've been looking for! Was looking for something to do with the gallons of broth left over from making corned beef & cabbage; onion soup seemed perfect but I wasn't crazy about any of the recipes I've tried before. (I think another commentor was in the same boat.) Anyway, whether it's the broth or the recipe, I'll be making this onion soup after every corned beef dinner from now on!

When I try a recipe for the first time that's gotten stellar Epicurious reviews, I try to take said reviews with a grain of salt (as it were) since I've found that reviewers on this site tend to go all hyperbolic when they find something they like (myself included). However, the enthusiasm for this recipe is well deserved; the soup totally delivers on its promise of awesomeness. The boyfriend declared it "maybe the best thing" I've ever made, and that's saying something, since I cook a lot! The only thing to be wary of is the cook time for the onions; as others have noted, it takes closer to an hour to get them to really caramelize. The recipe took me almost exactly two hours, start to finish. The good news is that it's very straightforward and everything cooks for so long that the only prep you actually have to do before you start cooking is slicing the onions; I grated the cheese and prepped my mise en place while the onions caramelized, then warmed the oven and toasted the bread while the soup simmered. I even got some dishes done while I waited. And most importantly, the results were exactly what I'd hoped for - warm, gooey, full-flavored comfort food. The only change I'd make for next time would be to make it a double batch!

Made this with leftover stock from St. Paddy's Day corned beef. The thyme added nice earthiness to the broth. I also added a tablespoon or so of sherry to give the broth a bit more depth. The ciabatta was a bit, well, large, but ate the leftovers with some homemade croutons and shredded gruyere. Delish!

Rating: 4
This was a great weeknight dinner, so filling we didn't need anything else. Yes, the onions did take longer to carmelize than 25 mintues, but it was well worth the wait- we just enjoyed a second glass of wine while they continued to cook. This one is a keeper.

Rating: 3
Really delicious soup. The onions did take ages to carmelize, but definitely worth it. Make sure your bowls/crocks are the appropriate size. Mine were too big, meaning the cheese didn't form the bubbly layer it's supposed to. The bread should be squeezed against the sides of the bowl.

Rating: 4
This was excellent. I doubled the recipe to serve as an appetizer for a French themed dinner, and got rave revies. The key is really to let the onions caramelize fully. This can't be rushed. Took me close to a full hour. Use real gruyere as well - worth the expense.

Super tasty. I did make two little changes - I used vegetable broth instead of the beef, and I used a stout instead of white wine. Definitely a different take on the soup, but highly recommended

This is a delicious light choice if you go easy on the cheese. We had flank steak with it -- wonderful dunked in the soup. Next time I will try putting the cheese crostini in a flat bowl, thin slices of flank steak over that and a big ladleful of the soup on top.

just finished eating my first bowl of this wonderful soup. I cooked the onions for 45 minutes and used 6 cups of low sodium chicken broth. I also used 1/2 Parmesan and 1/2 Gruyere. It's a lot of work, but well worth it.

Rating: 3
Even with several changes this recipe held up beautifully. I don't like beef broth (I know, I know) so I used a combo of chicken and veggie. I didn't have ciabatta so I used french. I had a combo of Gruyere and Emmental on hand so I used both. I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dry. Frankly, even with all the changes, my husband and I were still delighted.

Rating: 4
The onions do need to be caramelized, which takes some time; I've found that dividing the onions into a couple pans works well. IME, if there are too many onions in a pot, they will steam rather than caramelize. I usually double or triple this recipe anyway, so I use 2 or 3 saute pans and divide the butter and herbs between them, deglazing each pan as it's ready. I cut the bread into smaller pieces, as I find it easier to eat that way, and increase the beef broth and decrease the water, just my preference. This is a great soup, and the leftovers are, too. I make this soup frequently during the colder months.

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. I followed the recipe as written and made sure to carmelize the onions. I used a very large spanish onion as opposed to yellow onions as I'd heard they are the classic onion for onion soup. Be sure to taste while seasoning as some beef stocks can be salty. I topped it with a cave aged Gruyere and it was easy and delicious.

You must caramelize the onions, which definitely takes more time than suggested. I followed instructions the first time and result was very blah, but I strained the onions and continued cooking them and it made a world of difference. I recommend doubling recipe, but not the onions. the current recipe made 6 small bowls and everyone was looking for more broth.

This is an excellent recipe for French Onion Soup! I've made it several times and I absolutely love it. It received rave reviews throughout the meal. *Like other reviewers, I agree that the suggested cooking time of 30 minutes is not long enough. I cooked the onions for 45 minutes and they were perfect.

Wow! Took me an hr to get the onions to brown, and I used a "better than bouillon" vegetable base instead of beef stock plus extra thyme. Amazing :)

This was VERY yummy! I stayed true to the recipe except instead of dry white wine I used an apple white wine I had open and instead of Swiss Gruyere I uses smoked Gruyere. The onions do take more time to caramelize then they tell you here. All in all I will definitely make this again! Yum!

wow. i was so incredibly underwhelmed by this recipe. first, i spent an hour and a half caramelizing the onions (on a medium/low heat- -low heat would have taken 3 or 4 hours, not the 25-30 minutes the recipe stated). after all that time i was really looking forward to something special. the end result was unpleasant in taste and texture--my boyfriend said it reminded him of dirty sock water and i agreed. i've had far better french onion soups out of a can.

Lovely and very straight-forward to make. I will probably puree some of the soup next time as we found that there were too many onion pieces for our liking.

Really, really good! My hubby said it was better than any restaurant soup (and he loves French Onion!). I accidentally used a lot more butter than recommended (not advised, stick with the suggested amount), so I was forced to double the recipe. Yes, the onions take a long time, but it's worth it. Cook them down to a slimy, sweet brown mess and prepare to fall in love. I added a squirt of dijon mustard to the onions to deepen the flavor and used a little bit of cognac at the end for extra umph...perfect! I also used a lot more cracked pepper, thyme and bay leaves than suggested because I like a lot of flavor. I used veggie stock and there was still so much deep flavor that I don't see how it could be any better with beef broth. For the crostini, I used a artisan load of parmesean bread and broiled it on both sides before topping the toast with both Gruyere and Emmental and broiling again. For the onions, I used standard Vidalia and I think that it was the perfect choice. Brown onions would be too much like gravy and Maui onions in this quantity would be gross. The cooks who ended up with "brown water" did something wrong because this soup was far from it! My advice is to commit to the caramelization of the onions (at least an hour) and add some kind of cognac or sherry. Lastly, since my husband is a big eater, I had originally planned to make this soup as part of a larger dinner for the two of us, but the soup was enough. I made a bunch of extra cheese toasts and he was quite full and happy. I'm glad I didn't waste the time making a "main course" because the soup is filling enough for sure.

Without a doubt, the BEST French Onion soup I have ever had! The thyme and basil makes the soup have a rich, smoky flavor and all of the ingredients combined leave for a truly one-of-a-kind soup! It does take a while to make but it's all worth the time and effort at the end! Good thing I ate it all to myself! =]

This was a real winner. Simple and yummy. The only thing better than the smell of slow cooked onions is the taste of them. Pulled some thyme from my herb garden and had a fantastic meal in no time at all. I'm going to have to triple this recipe next time because I couldn't stop thinking about it for days!

This was delicious! I have pretty small footed oven safe soup bowls so I divided this into four small servings instead of two large which is perfect for an appetizer. I added two teaspoons of flour instead of one but that was the only change I made. This was really amazing, great recipe!!!

Great Soup- one of my favorites- it wasn't very thyme-y- so 5 minute prior to serving i added another 5 sprigs of thyme and let them cook in until i served- YUMM! this is now on the rotation- oh- to caramelize the onions- you really need to plan on a full hour-

Rating: 4
This was excellent, even though the onion-cooking part seemed to take forever. Loved that this was a recipe for two...I ate it one night, then got to have leftovers the next day. :o) I don't have ovenproof bowls, so I just toasted sliced baguette, with the grated cheese on top, in my toaster oven and then put them in the bowls and poured the hot soup over it. YUM!

This has become a family favourite - so much so that my sister gave me proper French Onion Soup bowls for xmas! (Until now I have been taking my chances with regular non oven proof crockery). I make a triple batch every time and follow the recipe as written. The only exception is in taking liberties on the 'giant crostini' and substituting in whatever is handy at the time, boxed croutons, sliced up baguette etc. Make sure you slice the onions as directed. It makes for super fine cut and consistency.

Good and easy. Note that this serves only two if portions are extremely generous. As a first course, it could serve 3-4.

The soup's a winner. I'm vegetarian, so I used veggie broth (and added an extra bay leaf to give it a bit of depth). Next time, I'm going to add a bit of Marmite to get a hearty undertone to the broth.

Absolutly delicious! the flavors meld beautifuly and give the broth several layers of flavor. the only alteration I made is I choped up the toasted bread because I think it makes it easier to eat than just having a big hunk of bread. other than I wouldn't change a thing.

Mmmm...simple and delicious! This was my first time making french onion soup. Unfortunately I did not have any white wine around, so I had to use red (a Shiraz/Cab blend...so not the same, i know, haha) and I don't eat beef so instead of going with an imitation beef broth, I just used chicken broth. Again, not the same, but it worked. Overall it turned out wonderful. The red wine gave it a darker color that the beef broth would have. I love that thyme flavor too! This is a keeper.

I have never made french onion soup before and was surprised at how easy it was. I added 1 1/2 tbl of dry sherry and some cornstarch to thicken the broth. I also didn't have beef stock and used chicken. I found it to be less salty than I usually have in restaurants which was great; though I added more salt in for seasoning.
