Fantastic! I make this soup every summer and it goes very quickly.

I've made this recipe several times and it's just great. If you're considering using canned tomatoes, go find another recipe. Instead of breadsticks, I like using a more rustic loaf to share.

Lovely refreshing soup for a summer night's dinner! Roasting the tomatoes on the bbq is a definite bonus and gives a subtle flavor. I would make it again and puree in a blender for a finer texture next time- was too coarse in the mixer. V8 would have spoiled the taste, so I used an organic tomatoe juice instead. The pesto was a 5 star item and all our guests raved about it. Next time I would play a bit with some added spice in the soup - cayenne maybe. Try this, it's worth a little effort!

The cook from Chicago sounded so enthusiastic, I give her version a try, and I must disagree. The Muir Woods tomatoes were definitely not acceptable (what canned tomato would be agreeable uncooked and straight from the can?) Tasted like a pot of raw tomato sauce. Happily, I was serving two other cold soups that day that were exceptional. I may try the ample remainders of this one on pizza or pasta.

This was a simple recipe and was a great first course for dinner. We cheated in that we used canned Muir Glen Fire Roasted tomatos and a spicy pesto from Galena Canning Company, with an awesome outcome and time savings. We also toasted and dried out some slices of sourdough baguette and placed one on top of each bowl of soup as opposed to serving with bread sticks. This will become a standard on our recipe list. Next time we will try it the same way but add some goat cheese to the giant crouton with the pesto on top of that.

This tastes...fine. It's really quite good. But for the effort--which is not major but not inconsiderable, either--I'd expect something better. Especially since I started with pretty good tomatoes: the best I've had this season. I might try it again but skip the V-8 altogether. That way the roasted tomato flavor, which was quite nice, might come through.

I roasted a couple of serano chilies along with the red bell pepper and used spicey hot V8 juice. Therefor, mine was anything but bland. I love this recipe. Roasting the tomatoes makes them a little sweeter, and it is such an easy, healthy soup. I make it all through tomato season.

I would just like to suggest maybe using the spicy V-8 juice to make the soup less bland. I plan on trying this myself.

THis was a great success with my family and company. I thought the pesto was a very nice aesthetic touch, as well as culinary/taste one. I didn't find it too bland- cold tomato soups are rather subtle. Anyway, I will definitely make it again.

I served this dish at the Ch. Ste. Michelle picnic and concert over the Labor Day weekend. It was very easy to prepare (the day before), and was perfect being transported in a thermos. My guests were upset that there wasn't any more. An acquaintance, John Sarich, Culinary Foods Director of Ch. Ste. Michelle tried a bowl, and pronounced it wonderful. I would prepare it again and again!

I agree with the cook from Chicago, this is a very bland soup, especially for one that requires this much work. I'd find a good gazpacho recipe instead of making this again.

Why go to the bother of using lovely fresh tomatoes if you are then going to mix them with canned tomato juice? Modified the recipe to use more fresh tomatoes, juiced, and increased the seasoning to compensate for absence of V-8. Then, I would make it again.

I found this soup to be very bland. Maybe I was expecting it to taste more like gazpacho. Anyway, not worth the effort to make again.

This recipe is relatively easy to make and is very refreshing on hot summer days. I was a little confused when it came to making the soup, as it is not specified which tomatoes go where etc... I more or less played it by ear and it came out great! I'll definitely be making this again.
