Havent made these but the so-so reviews made me want to point out how WONDERFUL the "Peanut Butter And Jelly Bars" recipe is on here, instead. It's probably more of what you will be hoping for.

My coworkers gave these a 6 out of 10. Everything about themflavor, texture, appearancewas just kinda OK. There was nothing to make them stand out. Maybe they could have used more jelly or a different flavor. (I used grape.) I made 1.5 times the recipe for a 9x13 pan, and that worked well. The jelly stuck to the foil a bit, so be careful around the edges. Watch the cooking time too; mine were done at about 26 minutes.

I think these are great when you need a quick cookie as all the ingredients are staples. I used seedless raspberry jam for the filling and next time I might add a little more jam. I would make these again. Quick and easy!

I made these for a family gathering and they were a huge hit. I substitued raspberry jelly for grape and even with a double batch there were barely any left at the end of the night.

These were amazingly sweet, then again, I don't eat things with much sugar in it. My friend loved them but she's a PB&J fanatic so I don't know if she can be trusted =P

I've made this recipe twice, and both kids and adults liked them. The second time, I substituted 1/2 C. dark brown sugar and 1/2 C. granulated sugar for the light brown sugar, resulting in a sweeter dough; increased the grape jelly to 3/4 C. for a more gooey filling; and, added a layer of chopped peanuts on top of the jelly for more peanut flavor. A really easy, tasty and fun addition to my cookie recipe file!

I thought these were very good. They were definitely dry but also tender. I did add chocolate chips on top-- I was worried that would make it too sweet but it just made them better!

I definitely liked these better than the other reviewers, but my PB&J-loving husband didn't. He said they were fine, but he prefers regular-old peanut butter cookies. If you have the ingredients in your cupboard, I'd give them a try, though. They're super easy and just the thing to throw together in a sweet-starved state.

These were definitely good, but not outrageous. I think they would be more decadent if there was some sweet peanut butter sauce drizzled on top. The 1 cup of dough crumbled on top tastes just like the dough on the bottom, so a contrast between the two would have been better.

I made this recipe because my kids LOVE PB&J's. The cookie bar is really dense and you definitely need a glass of milk with them. They taste exactly like PB&J sandwiches. Not exactly my favorite thing, and, my PB&J-loving kids didn't really like them either. Oh well.
