Made this in 2002 when the recipe first came out in Bon Appetit. My family has insisted that this will be our Thanksgiving turkey and gravy recipe forever. They are also a huge fan of the mushroom stuffing recipe from the same issue. As with most turkey recipes, it really helps to brine the bird first - I use the vegetable stock based brine suggested by Alton Brown.

This will be my fourth year preparing this recipe for Thanksgiving and each time I have received rave reviews. Soaking the bird for 24 hours in dissolved sea salt adds significant flavor and retains moisture. I use Rainwater Madeira wine for the gravy. I look forward to making this dish every year.

This recipe is perfect for Thanksgiving dinner. Every year, I get rave reviews for this. I even have an aunt his dislikes mushrooms, but loves this recipe! It's time-consuming, but well worth it for once a year. ;-)

I used a different recipe for the turkey but the gravy was awesome. Will make it again. I added more stock and did what I could to strech it. Youll need all you can get!!! Used a combination of wolfgang puck and Alton brown for the turkey.

this was the first turkey my husband and I have ever made. The porcini rub yielded no difference in taste- would not use it again. The gravy was delicious- moreso due to the homemade turkey stock I feel than the mushrooms- but would add mushrooms again next time, since my dad liked them, however not use the rub. Turkey was moist.

This was delicious and surprisingly easy to make. My whole family loved it so much they asked me to make it again just a couple weeks after Thanksgiving!

Wonderful! Everyone loved it. I also took some of the powdered porcinis and added them to some butter and garlic and put it up under the skin of the turkey.

Loved the gravy! There was a lot left over...it made more than I had expected. Like previous reviewers, I did not think the porcini rub made any difference. The turkey did turn our moist, and the gravy was 5 star!

Yummmmm!!! this was the Tday table consensus. Found the porcini butter difficult to work with - ended up smearing it under the skin and basting more often than recipe stated. Gravy was five star! Cut the butter in the gravy in half; the mushrooms don't need butter release their liquid. Served this with wild rice stuffing w/carmelized pearl onions, dried cranberries and currants which was perfect.

I must agree about the porcini rub. I don't know that it made that much difference. The gravy was excellent, but it seems like I had alot more gravy at the end than I expected. I brined my turkey for the first time using the receipe from the same issue of BOn Appetit and it really made the turkey moist and tender. Even the leftovers are moist!

I didn't think the Porcini rub made any difference to the turkey. Any bastiing would have produced the same juicy bird, however the gravy was superb!

Excellent turkey! The best gravy I have ever prepared!

Fabulous!!! It was the juiciest turkey we've ever tasted. Instead of rubbing the turkey w/butter I browned the butter, added the mushroom powder, and then brushed it on the turkey. The result was that the juices were sealed in the turkey when the skin browned in the first hour. I also used Marsala instead of Madiera and a different type of bolete mushroom. Since I had no fresh shitake, I used dried. Roasting the turkey breast side down also made it very juicy.

Although I am Michael's cousin, and could be partially biased, the Shiitake-Madeira Gravy is absolutely the BEST I've ever tasted. When you make this recipe, you'll want to make more gravy, as it will disappear before your eyes. Michael was truly a genius.
