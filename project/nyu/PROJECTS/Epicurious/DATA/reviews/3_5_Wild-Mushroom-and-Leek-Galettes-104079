I've made this recipe several times and it always gets raves! Usually I use 4" tart tins (for improved structural integrity) versus the free-form suggested in the recipe. Yesterday I made 24 mini tarts for h'ors d'oeuvres (used 1.5x the quantity of ingredients listed & same half package of frozen puff pastry). I often substitute half of the portobello mushrooms with shitake mushrooms for added variety. I often make extra filling as it's great in omelets or as a topping on roasted pork and chicken; once I even used it as filling in lasagna! Delicious and easy to make.

Beautiful, elegant and tasty! I made this with chopped portabellos and shitake mushrooms, and it was delicious. You definitely need some sort of support for the pastry dough, otherwise it'll flatten out and the filling will run out. I made rings out of heavy duty foil, and placed the pastry rounds onto the rings and then spooned in the goat cheese and filling. Large muffin tins are a great idea, I'll try that next time.

This is truely a GOURMET recipe! All the flavor come together perfectly and the puff pastry adds a little crunch. Next time I will either take others suggestion and use puff pastry shells or make 6-inch circles instead of 4. I had lots of extra filling. I may add all the goat cheese to the filling rather than spread it on the pastry.

I substituted ready made phyllo cups for the pastry. Superb!

Loved the recipe - used matsutake and fresh chanterelles. Took the advice of other reviewers here and pre-baked the puff pastry a bit. Also shaped the puff pastry in to "boxes" with sides to hold the filling in. Served these larger portions as entrees. Also, if doing this recipe again, I would avoid goat cheese (made the texture of the sauce grainy) and use creme fraiche, mascapone, or cream instead.

i made this last weekend for my dinner club. i used the peppridge farm puff pastry and stuffed them into large muffin tins which worked nicely. these tarts tasted just ok. i didn't parbake the pastry. i think it neede a little more oomph.

This was a lovely appetizer. It is very simple to make but elegant to serve. Well received by the guests. There is a great deal of mushroom mixture left over. You could easily double the number served. We used the leftover mixture in pasta the next day.

When I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, I used crimini mushrooms instead of the Chantrelles. The results were fantastic. I just used Pepperidge Farms frozen puff pastry, and it handled great.

This dish was a HUGE success at my last dinner party. I had leftover filling and my husband enjoyed it all week as a sort of pate. I used hen-of-the-woods and baby portobellos instead. Hint to the cook from Dallas: I used fillo dough instead and pushed them into well buttered muffin tins to ensure they held there shape.

If you like goat cheese, this is great. I added several different kinds of mushrooms to make it more interesting, and used it as an appetizer. It is a little time consuming to make in addition to a dinner, though.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I made one modification, I added finely chopped Andouille sausage to the mushroom, leek mixture. My husband has something against vegetarian food... it turned out wonderful! And it was relatively easy to prepare.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was very difficult to turn the pastry dough edges up so the mushroom mixture stayed inside the dough area. Besides, this recipe made enough mushrooms to double the amount of dough needed. Also, I thought the mushroom mixture was very bland. Thank goodness for the goat cheese, otherwise this dish would not have been edible.
