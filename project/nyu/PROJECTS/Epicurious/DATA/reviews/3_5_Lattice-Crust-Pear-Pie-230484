I really liked this pie, but I felt that next time I would tweak it a bit. I'd add more spice and sugar to the filling, and I will I use my own crust recipe. Regardless, with a little whipped cream on top it was a crowd pleaser.

This is now my standard recipe for apple pie. I use 3-4 granny smith and 3-4 of any other cooking apple. I've made this three times and we love it! I realize that I need to try this with pears to give a most accurate response, but it's also perfect with apples!

I give this 3 forks only because I use my own double crust. The filling is worth 4! Perfect flavor, perfect texture.

I did not make this exact recipe, but found pretty much the same one in another book. Also adding ground cloves with the nutmeg gives it more flavor, as well as dotting with butter. Can also be baked at 400 for 35 minutes.

Easy and delicious. Used ground nutmeg and ready to use crusts to save time and it still came out wonderfully.

A good pear pie, I followed the recipe exactly. Dense and flavorful.

I'm not a big pie baker, but this one was fairly quick and easy. While it was good just as baked, we served it with a bit of Stilton cheese and a glass of port. The blue cheese and the wine really complimented the taste of the pears. I'll make it again!

A good basic pear pie recipe. I would add some cinnamon, and maybe some allspice, for variety. Another good variation would be a layer of cheddar cheese in the middle!
