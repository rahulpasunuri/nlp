I made this for Easter and it was light and fluffy and delicious. The crust was crunchy and a nice complement to the creamy cake. I used a 9 inch pan, because that's what I had, and had a good bit of filling left over. I recommend being prepared with an extra small pan with some of the crust mixture(the recipe makes plenty) if using a smaller pan.

I love this cheesecake. It is always a hit and people always ask for the recipe because it isn't like a traditional cheesecake. My only issue is the baking time. I think it requires more baking time than is indicated. There has never been a time I've taken it out of the oven after the amount of time indicated in the recipe.

I have made this cheesecake every year for Easter since it came out in 1996! My whole family loves it but loves it the most if I use real Greek honey. What a difference it makes to the taste.

Good but all that honey doesn't let the cheese taste shine through somehow.

This didn't taste bad, in part because it barely tasted at all. Very bland; better to try the Stilton Cheesecake or the Mascarpone Cheesecake with Balsamic Strawberries.

I used light cream cheese and ricotta and it still tasted rich and creamy - I did try it right out of the oven which was a mistake, definitely was better after refrigeration.

Fabulous - creamny, rich, not too sweet and not as heavy as a NY style cake. I added ground lemon peel to the filling and served it with sliced strawberries drizzled with Amaretto. A huge hit.

This cheesecake is incredible!!!! My guests had "died and went to heaven". The honey makes it so smooth and creamy.
