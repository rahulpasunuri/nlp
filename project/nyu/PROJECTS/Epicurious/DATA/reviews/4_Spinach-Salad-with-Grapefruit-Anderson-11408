The first time I made this salad I thought the bacon dressing was far too greasy. Because the other reviews were so positive, the second time I microwaved the bacon first, saved some of the bacon fat to saute the onions, and then continued with the printed directions. For us, this was much better.

Delicious. A surprisingly great blend of flavors- if you're wondering if it's going to be as good as the reviews, it is. For a summer version, I would suggest raw onion, draining the grapefruit and cooking the bacon in the microwave (cheating), so everything stays a bit more crisp. I'll make it again!

Great salad! I followed other reviewers' advice and mixed spinach with bacon mixture and half the dressing before topping with grapefruit and more dressing. I had a ripe avocado on hand so I added that along with the grapefruit. My boyfriend and I ate the whole thing in one very happy night. Will definitely make again and again.

I made this for a wedding shower in June and enjoyed the different flavors. I didn't saute the onion and prepared the bacon in the oven instead. The bacon looks a lot nicer and is less greasy prepared in the oven and I didn't saute the onions because it would made the salad heavy for an afternoon buffet. The dressing is great and I've made it again by itself. Over all - the salad got rave reviews from a variety of women. Definitely a great salad to make for larger groups.

This was delicious and has now become my new spinach salad recipe. The grapefruit works so well in the salad - not a hint of sourness!! Also, the dressing is awesome but it did make a lot - next time I will half the dressing recipe.

I did not think the grapefruit complemented the other flavours in the salad but otherwise I liked it. Next time I would leave the grapefruit out and add mushrooms or another ingredient

So yummy! I ommited both the bacon (don't really like it) and the sesame seeds (not available) and it was still the best spinach salad I've ever had! My hubby and I ate the whole thing in one setting!

The recipe says "1/4 sesame seeds." But not a quarter what, teaspoon, cup???

Can't get my boyfriend to eat any fruits or veggies. He loved this salad. He asked me to make it for him again tonight.

A wonderful wintertime salad to take advantage of the Texas Ruby Red grapefruit harvest. I used sping greens in place of the spinach and added 1/2 c. dried cranberries. I've also omitted the onion, bacon and sesame seeds and still like the results. A wonderful salad.

Agree with the chef from ElPaso, red or pink grapefruit is great with this salad which is delicious and terrific with this simple dressing. Do add grapefruit last.

This is an excellent salad recipe. I have used it on numerous occasions always to rave reviews. I served it at a summer BBQ today and the guests liked it. To avoid excessive dampness (as reported by some other reviewers) I made sure to drain the grapefruit sections well prior to tossing them in.

Tasty and refreshing. Will select leaner bacon next time. Used black sesame seeds (sushi leftovers), which provided a nice visual contrast. Serve immediately, it being a rather watery salad.

Everyone in my family loved this salad. The sesame seeds add flavor and crunch. I tossed the spinach with about half the dressing and the bacon mixture, plated it, then added the grapefruit on top to avoid breaking up the sections, followed by another drizzle of dressing. Top notch!

Wonderful and refreshing salad! How did I miss this recipe for so long? I used Texas Ruby Red's, as they are sweeter than white grapefruit. The dressing is exquisite! One word of advice...don't toss the grapefruit with the salad, just add it on top of the greens and add additional dressing. The segments can tend to break up when tossing. I'm a Personal/Private Chef and served this at a formal dinner party. It was a huge hit!

We prepared this salad for a wine club dinner to be served with a cornish hen main course, and it was the hit of the evening. The dressing is outstanding and we have used if for other salads. We will definitely use the dressing and salad again -- many times.
