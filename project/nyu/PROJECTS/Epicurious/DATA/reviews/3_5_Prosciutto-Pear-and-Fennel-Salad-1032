Wow. I've been using epicurious.com for years, and never felt the need to post a review for a recipe. That changed today. I wasn't really sure what to do with the fennel that magically appeared in my refrigerator and tried this recipe. It is AMAZING! And I haven't even tried it with the proscuitto yet.

I found this to be somewhat underseasoned. If I were to make again, I would look for some way to enliven it.

Substituted goat cheese for proscuitto to make it vegetarian but keep the salty flavor. One tablespoon each of oil and vinegar was fine. Delicious!

Perhaps the salad on it's own would not be especially memorable, but it made an Excellent accompaniment to roast venison. The pear sweet, the fresh fennel mild, and the vineagrette seem to be so refreshing with roasted and grilled meats. Used that way, I left the prosciutto off. Simple but Very tasty.

What great press for a just so-so dish. There's nothing wrong with it. It's just not special or memorable.

Excellent dish. I made this for a large dinner party paired with a pork roast and even those who oppose pears in general liked this salad.

This is a definite keeper. I served it as a first course and got rave reviews from some normally picky eaters. The only change I made was to add a little diced Asian pear to the Bartlett...added a nice touch. Might cut down a little on the oil next time, although that certainly wasn't a limiting factor.

I thought this was very refreshing. I used apple cider vinegar because I did not have Sherry wine vinegar and it was delicious. Some members of my family whom I didn't think would even eat this, tried it and loved it. I will make this again.

Excellent! The only thing I would change would be to use a little less olive oil. I also added just a touch of romaine lettuce to increase the portions.
