This galette was a huge hit at a dinner party last night. There were 8 of us, and although the recipe says serves 8-10, I'd say it really serves 6. Everyone was clamoring for more. I absolutely loved the buttery crust - it had just the right texture. It wasn't too sweet and paired off nicely with the bittersweet chocolate. The only small problem I encountered was with the marbling. I let the dark chocolate cool 45 minutes like it said, but that turned out to be too much. By then it was too thick to marbleize properly. I also found I needed to add 4 tablespoons of ice water to the pastry dough to get the right consistency. I would definitely make this again and am considering using the dough for other tarts.

I chose to use this dessert for a rehersal dinner for a wedding. From making several testers before the event, i found it was more efficient and better looking to shingle(slice strawberries thinly and lay one over another) rather than take entire halves and line them up. An apricot glaze suited it better aso, becasue of the trancparency of the glaze and the effect of almost gluing the berries to the crust. Very good recipie overall, and it was fun to play with and modify it. Definitley would make again for an event if time constraints were not an issue

I made this dessert for Easter Dinner and it was a big hit. It looked beautiful and tasted fantastic. It was a perfect blend of flavors and was a great dessert to follow a large meal. It satisfies your sweet tooth without being too heavy. Everyone loved it and I would definitely make it again.

I disagree with the other reviewers. I thought this dessert was both beautiful and delicious. I was not alone -- my guests asked for the recipe! I would definitely make this again.

This galette was good, but only if you have the time and patience. If you want eye candy, go for this one. Not good if you want something nice and simple.

This dessert looked pretty, but it didn't taste that great. For the time and effort involved to roll out the dough, melt the chocolate, slice the strawberrries,etc., I was hoping for a richer finish. If you're looking for an impressive LOOKING dessert, add this to your table. But if you want a delicious dessert that everyone compliments, this isn't the one.
