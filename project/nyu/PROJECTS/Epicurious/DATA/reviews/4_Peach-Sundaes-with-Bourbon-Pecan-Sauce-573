This is great either warm or cold. I usually add more peaches and just a little more bourbon than called for.

Love this dessert! You can make the sauce ahead of time and put everything together when it's time to serve. It's cold, creamy and crunchy!

I first made this 20 years ago when it came out in Bon Appetit. Lost the magazine and have been looking for it ever since it was so good! Stumbled on it this morning, can't wait to make it again.

Very easy to prepare, wonderful taste. I added freshly whipped cream on top of the Sunday. My guest loved it.
