I was looking for a cream of watercress soup recipe and came across this. I adapted it to use ingredients I had. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and the white and light green parts of one large leek instead of onion. I didnt measure the watercress, but used the leaves from two bunches which had been aging in the refrigerator. (I don't think it was much more than was called for in the recipe, though.) I pureed the watercress in with the other ingredients with an immersion blender and didnt add a garnish. I thought it could use a little more depth of flavor, so added a bit of paprika, which helped some, but it could have used something else. Overall, a good easy soup.

This wasn't too bad, I had some watercress, so gave it a try. I added some fresh bacon bits and freshly grated pecorino romano on top.

I jazzed this up a lot, since the bare-bones version was pretty boring. I don't care for watercress so I used arugula, also some red pepper, and a bit of Asiago cheese to finish. Not the best recipe around, but it IS easy

Fantastic... I didn't have watercress, but I added fresh thyme and a drizzle of truffel oil at the end.

Wow. I am a fairly novice cook but a great lover of soup. This one was easy to make and sooo hearty and tasty. I used chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable broth. I can't believe no one has reviewed this recipe since 1996!
