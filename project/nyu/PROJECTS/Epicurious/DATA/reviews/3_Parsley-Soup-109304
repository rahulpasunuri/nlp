This was a nice, light soup that was easy to make. I would recommend using more broth or water. Although we liked it, I don't know that I would make it again.

It is simple to make. I added a little chicken broth, and it turned out delicious.

This is as easy as it gets, and the result is earthy and wholesome. That's not to say you couldn't serve it to company -- you could. The parsley stems don't puree well; that's not a bad thing, just rustic. What you need to know is that this makes very little soup.

I made this with Italian parsley from my garden and did not like it at all. The parsley flavour was too strong and the soup was very thick. So I whipped up a quick batch of simple potato soup (4 cups chicken broth, one small onion chopped, 5 potatoes) which I pureed and mixed with the parley soup. Now it tastes pretty good!

Very nice-a wonderful use for a bumber crop of parsley. Extra nutritious to boot!

This dish was a very pleasant surprise. It has a velvety, almost creamy texture. I used homemade chicken broth instead of water it ended up having a lot of flavor.
