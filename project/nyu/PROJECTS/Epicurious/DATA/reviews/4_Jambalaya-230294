This is a very tasty dish, and also, surprisingly easy to make. I am visiting Turkey at the moment, so I had to search a little for ham, but in the end I found a type of sausage, which worked just fine. I used a little less shrimp and more chicken, just for price preferences. Also, I used white rice instead of brown, but for this you only have to add a tiny bit more rice, and it only needs to sit for 25 minutes, instead of the 45 with brown rice. Subsituting chili powder and regular pepper together for the ceyenne works. It really is a meal anyone can make as long as they have a small bit of experience.

I made this for the Super Bowl and used only shrimp and tofu sausage for meat and even the carnivores loved it! I also cooked the brown rice separately and everyone ladled what they wanted into their bowls.

Outstanding! I used black pepper instead of cayenne as some members of our family do not like spicy food. Those that do added a dash of Tabasco to theirs and it was perfect. I doubled the recipe and found that it took quite a bit longer than 45 minutes to cook the rice.

This recipe is wonderful if you're on a diet or want something healthy. And while it's not the kind of jambalaya you'd get at Harold and Belle's or in new Orleans, for health food, it's hard to beat. I'd say use chicken stock instead of water and add extra veggies. I also substituted a homemade cajun spice mix (that did have cayenne in it). It needs a lot of salt and spice, but for healthfood, it's unbeatable.

I used chipotle suasage as I couldn't find smoked ham and it worked great! The tomato sauce might have made it too sweet so may substitute tomato puree with some water next time.

Rating: 4
Great, easy recipe 1.) pretty hot/spicy. if spice is not your thing, you may want to reduce the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp. 2.) i used whole grain brown rice and it took forever to cook ( a little over an hour). i suggest you use something like minute rice brown rice or boil your rice separately for a while then add it in to the jambalaya to continue cooking. 3.) i used leftover grilled sausage and store bought rotisserie chicken and it turned out great so feel free to use substitutions wherever you want.

I'm a huge fan of jambalaya (and frequent visitor of New Orleans) and this recipe is def a winner! I made it using tofu sausage and 1 lb of chicken breast...shrimp would've been great but my bf doesn't eat it. I substituted the water with low- sodium chicken broth and used fresh parsley. Also added just a pinch of cumin, black pepper, and salt. Be mindful of the cayenne pepper! I cut back to about 1/4 tspn and it was still very spicy. Not sure why others left out the tomato sauce... I used a 16oz can of diced plus an 8oz can of sauce and it turned out perfect. I was worried that 3/4 cup rice wouldn't be enough for all the meat I put in, but it was right on. Makes enough for 3 good servings. Flavors in this dish were amazing and all cooked in 1 pot. Only drawback was that brown rice takes a long time to cook (~45 mins).

My wife likes a full flavored jambalaya and this did not pass the test. Maybe I took the warning this was a healthy version too lightly. Next time I will use andouille sausage, chicken, and shrimp and increase the amount of green pepper, onion, cayenne, garlic and another bay leaf. I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced and sauce. Finally, serve this over cooked orzo for a great tasting dish.

Easy and tasty! Wow! Did not go shop especially for this recipe - just substituted with what I already had - red bell pepper for green; regular parsley for Italian; chicken thigh for breast; par boiled rice for brown rice; and cooked tiny shrimp for medium shrimp - cheaper too. Had to keep watching for ingredients getting burnt into the bottom of pot so added chicken stock and stirred every 10-15 minutes. Came out great!!!

This was fantastic! I'm not a huge fan of spicy so I was worried but it was so good I had seconds. I would personally put 1/2 the cayenne next time as im more of a mild salsa girl but it really was good. I paired it with a nice blush wine and it was perfect. Even my picky little 11 year old eater enjoyed it.

"DELICIOUS" said the Husband! I agreed. We included some chopped sweet red, orange and yellow peppers we had on hand, and left out the chicken in favor of more ham and shrimp. I only had brown Basmati rice- which I will not use next time- the texture is too thin and took forever to cook through. Also used a "Cajun Blackening Seasoning" that gave it some excellent flavor. Made all in my LeCreuset oval dutch oven which made serving and storing the leftovers a breeze.

There are tastier, more authentic Jambalaya recipes out there. That said, it was good. Too much tomato - I'd eliminate the tomato sauce and increase the water/broth. 1 cup of brown rice needed more time to cook, added 10 minutes before tossing in the shrimp for another 5. Added more cayenne and some Tobasco sauce to build the heat. Finished dish was still mild.

Forgot to say I ran out of cayenne so I added some smoked spanish paprika-very good

Delicious! Subbed red for green bell pepper, small can of tomato paste for sauce, veggie broth for water, and cheddarwurst for ham. Loved it! I'd cook it a little longer next time--the rice was still a little firm. Oh-and I was originally looking for a red beans and rice recipe so I threw the kidney beans in too. I really loved it.

Excellent healthy variation of classic Jambalaya. Have made several times over the years; always turns out great. Adjustments: Sub. spicy Italian chicken sausage from Whole Foods for ham. Use only 1 lb. of shrimp. Make extra brown rice. To serve; spoon Jambalaya over extra brown rice.

Very tasty dish. I used chicken chorizo instead of ham, and about 1 lb of shrimp, no other meat. I also didn't have any tomato sauce, so I just used the diced tomatoes and a little extra water. Went light on the cayenne as my husband doesn't tolerate spicy to well, but this was still delicious.

I added a full bag of Birdseye peppers and onions, and used hot and spicy no-nitrite sausage (nitrates cause migraines for me). I added tabasco. Also, I substituted tomato paste for the small can of sauce, and then used an extra 1 1/2 cups of water and a full cup of brown rice. The jambalaya was very popular with my family. (If you boil the shrimp first, you could peel the pesky tails/shells off before serving this dish at a party.) Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Jambalaya-230294#ixzz17KiiEQZV

Loved this Jambalaya! I used chicken broth instead of water and spicy Italian Sausage (instead of ham/chicken) that I sauteed with the onion and garlic. I substituted fresh scallops (that were on sale)instead of shrimp. Didn't have any bell pepper or celery but it was amazing anyway. I increased the rice to 1 cup of brown rice. Served it with whole wheat sourdough bread and broccoli. (I agree that you need some veges with this dish). Yum! I'd serve this for company.

Excellent results. The brown rice did need more than an an hour to finish. But my main fear was allayed, the proportions are just; good ratio of rice to other ingredients. If you find this recipe bland, give up on the "low-fat, healthy" options and use pork sausage. If brown rice is too tough for you, cook it longer. It holds up better than white rice.

Rating: 4
So easy and delicious! I used chorizo and chicken sausage instead of ham and chicken. I also used brown rice and tomato paste instead of sauce. Even with all these changes, it was fabulous. As one reviewer said, it's light on the veggies, so I'd make a veggie side dish or a salad next time.

Rating: 3
The whole family really enjoyed it. Everyone would like me to sub andouille sausage for the hame the next time. I was also chastised for not serving french bread with it. Looking forward to using some of the other reviewer suggestions when I make it the next time. We like the chewiness of the brown rice - so will stay with the brown rice (it's also healthier).

Rating: 0
Thought this was delicious and simple. Definitely was inclined to keep it light vs. going decadent. My modifications were: nixed the ham; doubled (at least) the chicken; chicken stock instead of water; tomato paste instead of tomato sauce; about 5 cloves of garlic; served it over brown rice I cooked separately (I'm big on cook-it-and- freeze-it brown rice), which shortened the cooking time considerably.

Rating: 3
Overall this recipe was a good foundation to use as a starting point. I exchanged a Cajun sausage for the ham. When I make this again I will exchange the brown for white rice. Brown rice remains too stiff for my taste in a Jambalaya, where as a white might be more authentic. It will also provide a better less chewy/tough consistency. As for spices I added a Creole spice with the cayenne pepper but still felt it was missing something, not from a hot stand point, but from a flavor stand point. The tomato flavor overwhelmed everything else.

Rating: 4
My husband and I loved this. It makes a lot so if you are cooking for two you might want to cut the recipe in half. I substituted Italian sausage for the ham and chicken and used red bell pepper instead of green bell pepper. I also used white rice instead of the brown because that is what I had in the house. I will definitely make it again!

similar to other reviews, I substituted cayenne for a Cajun/creole spice mix, water for chicken broth, ham for hot sausage and I omitted the tomato sauce and added one chopped jalapeno pepper (as my family likes it spicy)... AWESOME... will make this again.

I already had a Jambalaya recipe I liked, but made this one based on the stellar reader reviews. It is definitely excellent! Based on the reviews I used chicken broth instead of water, chicken thighs instead of breasts, and andouille sausage instead of ham, and omitted the tomato sauce. Also used Creole seasoning rather than cayenne and substituted fire-roasted tomatoes. Awesome! Will make again and again.

This is a great recipe! I made 1/2 with just shrimp and the other half with sausage (I don't eat red meat, the other half does). It's really easy, didn't take terribly long and was fine even though I substituted cayenne (half a tsp) for paprika. A note that I found it helpful to keep stirring, the rice otherwise gets coated to the bottom of the pan.

This was awesome! I followed pretty closely, but added some red pepper flakes to the onion/garlic/papper, and used chicken stock instead of water. I also used way more cayenne than called for cause i was fiending for that HEAT! Also minced a serrano pepper and threw that in there. When it comes to the rice I accidentally bought "boil in the bag" brown rice - I ripped those packages open and dumped them in anyway. It wound up being too much, I think about 3 cups of rice. But it was still delicious. I'd chop the chicken a little smaller next time. Forgot the shrimp but it didn't even need it. I wouldn't call it "rich" jambalaya though, none of that roux - ey type flavor, but still packs a delicious pucnh.

This was actually really good. I followed the other reviewers and used andouille in place of ham, thighs instead of breast and left out the tomato sauce, and used some creole seasoning along with the cayenne. I used white rice because it's all I had on hand. Made it in the morning for the evening. Next time, I will wait and add the rice closer to the time of serving, but other than that I'm very pleased!

Brilliant ! As other reviewers substituted chicken stock for water (used 2 cups for 1 cup of rice) and sausage for ham. Didn't use the tomato sauce, there was no use for it. Used a bit less cayenne pepper, but put in some Cajun mix instead. Will definitely be making again (and again and again)

Great. I'll make it again, for sure. I used a bit less cayenne but will use more next time I make it. Wonderful the second day. The amount of rice is perfect. I thought it was cooking too fast on low on my range so I put it in the oven to finish. Perfect.

This is very easy to make and was a huge hit with everybody. It gets better by the day. Fantastic served with some sauteed greens. I used chicken thighs, sausage and shrimp.

This recipe is great! It is so hearty and flavorful yet healthy. We left out the shrimp and added one link (2.5 oz) of cajun style chicken sausage and I really liked the kick it gave. The dish was still plenty meaty. My only complaint is it was just too soupy. I followed some other suggestions and used 1 c brown rice, but I still had to cook it down uncovered at the end. Next time I will leave out some of the water or the can of tomato sauce.

Rating: 2
Disappointing. There was so much liquid after 45 minutes of cooking that I added 1/4 c white rice and let it simmer another 15 minutes, yet it was still more soup than solid. Since the brown rice sank to the bottom of the pot it might help to just let it cook uncovered. The flavors were one-note. Perhaps stirring in parsley and chopped green onion at the end would help, but there are so many good jambalaya recipes out there that I won't waste my time on this one again. We had lots of leftovers that went down the disposer, not worth reheating.

At first I wasn't sure how I felt about it but I really enjoyed it the next day. My complaint would be that the chicken and ham end up kind of bland and the main thing you taste is the heat and the shrimp. It was good but I think I might try a different recipe next time I make jambalaya.

Rating: 4
This was an outstanding recipe, probably the best jambalaya I've ever tasted. Like some other reviewers I used stock instead of water and found that I needed to keep topping it up as the rice cooked. I also used some Creole spice mix in place of some Cayenne. There were no fresh shrimp in my local fishmonger so I used frozen and they were great. I would definitely make again. 4 forks!

Rating: 4
Wow! I did have to substitute a couple things (had no shrimp or ham on hand) so changed it a bit. I added a chourico link and that added an awesome spicey-smokey-dimension to this dish! Also took advice from some other posters and used chicken broth instead of water and I left out the tomato sauce (it didn't need it). We wanted to eat the whole pot! Next time I'll add some diced carrots and throw in some peas at the very end.

This recipe was just fantastic. I made a few modifications (my boyfriend and I don't eat chicken or pork), but my sense is that it's fabulous as-is. I used lightlife's vegetarian Italian sausage in place of the chicken, a can of smoked oysters, added at the end, instead of the ham, twice the garlic, and a little smoked paprika. It's such an easy recipe. . . totally a keeper.

A little sinnin' goes a long way for this one. I made a triple batch and started with 3 little strips of bacon, used the drippings instead of the olive oil, added two jalapenos to the veggies. I also used chicken thighs poached separately (with the skin and bones) in chicken stock and wine, and then used that broth in place of water. Toss the bones and skin and shred the meat. Good Stuff.

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe - a perfect introduction to jambalaya that's not too complicated at all. The chicken makes it healthy. I'm still tinkering with the heat and water amount, as the chicken comes out a little dry, but the cayenne pepper (with a hint of ground black pepper sprinkled on too) comes out great after the simmering.

this was my first time making jambalaya & it was perfect! used suggestions from other reviewers: used 4 tsps minced garlic [from jar], subbed chicken sausage [rubbed w/ cajun spice] for ham, used 2 1/2 cups chicken broth instead of water & 2 cups rice. had to cook 20 minutes longer for a total of 65 minutes. didn't need salt or pepper, spices were perfect! this is the best jambalaya i have ever tasted! will definitely make again... and again!

I've made this dish several times now and each time I like it more and more. This is a simple dish to prepare. The brown rice is a must... if you don't have all the ingredients on hand you can substitute just about anything... andouille, pork, crab, chicken stock etc and it still tastes great. My husband wanted more shrimp so the second time I used 2 pounds and used a bit more garlic and it was perfect.

Rating: 4
I used this recipe more as a guide to my first venture into making jambalaya. It turned out well. It was healthy and not too heavy, though I used Andouille instead of ham. This is the kind of dish that is more flavorful the next day. I will refer to this recipe again on my next jambalaya adventure.

Rating: 4
Have made this three times now, and each time it comes out better and better. I replace the ham with lean andouille sausage for more southern flavor, and I rub the chicken pieces with Cajun seasoning and salt before adding. While brown rice is healthier, white rice takes about 1/4 of the time to cook, and it comes out better, in my opinion. And I always use broth instead of water and throw in extra Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper for more kick. Simply amazing.

Made it tonight. Followed recommendations of others and improvised...doubled garlic...used some scallops in place of some shrimp, vegetable stock i had laying around instead of water, and chicken sausage instead of chicken. Oh, and 2 cups of rice....it was perfect, had to cook it a bit longer but it was delicious.

Ok-This recipe was super delicious! I couldn't wait to eat it again for lunch at work the next day. This recipe was easy to make and I got the kids involved, too. To cut down on time, I bought a rotisserie chicken and had my daughter pull the meat and shred it, and my son added the chopped veggies and canned toms to the pan. He accidentally drained the tomato juice, so I poured in some chicken stock that I had, and I think that enhanced the flavors. Also, instead of ham, we diced up some garlic sausage..mmm. (Don't know the brand, but something like Hillshire Farms.) I will be making this again for sure. (My co-workers wanted to go out for lunch, but I stayed behind to eat my super-yummy meal.)

Booyah! This is a great recipe and works out very well. I added more rice, but not as much as others -- went with maybe just shy of a cup. You could put in more but there is nothing wrong with either the amount they listed or slightly more. I also thought it would need a bit more zest so I added some cajun seasoning and a dash or two of liquid chili fire. I considered but then rejected the earlier suggestion of using Ancho Chili Pepper, because I just thought that would change the dynamic of the dish way too much. This dish is great because you really can play around with the quantities without any real harm -- if you want to use more ham and less chicken, or hell, more ham and more chicken -- nobody is going to know the difference except the chef. Also: why go with extra-lean ham -- go for non-fat! Easy to find in the supermarket and zero difference for the recipe. This is a great meal and for a low-fat dish is outstanding.

Rating: 2
I thought this was just OK and that I didn't like it as much as other jambalaya recipes I have made - although my husband liked it. I cut the shrimp down to 1lb, 1.5lb would have been excessive. I also increased the rice to 1 cup. I think it needed more garlic, and more cajun spices.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe!!! Thank you to all who previously reviewed it. I made some of the suggested changes and it is fabulous! I used 4 cloves of garlic and minced it. I replaced the ham with Trader Joe's Smoked Chicken Andouille sausage. I also used 2 and 1/2 cups of chicken broth instead of water and 2 cups of brown rice. The recipe didn't say whether the chicken was cooked or not so I used precooked chicken. I cooked for an hour instead of the 45 minutes. I've made this twice this way and it's been a hit both times!

Rating: 4
So very tasty. We like lots of heat so I chopped up jalapenos from our garden, and roasted poblano and red peppers on my stove burners. But this recipe is a great base using different ingredients you have on hand, including just about any kind of sausage and even cubed fish.

I made a double batch for a New Year's Eve party and it recieved raves. I substituted andouille sausage for ham; and used 2 pounds of shrimp and 1 pound of king crab meat (which imparted a little sweetness). I used 3 cups of organic brown rice. Much of the seasoning comes from the andouille; so it is pretty hard to blow this dish. It will be great rewarmed for the bowl games tomorrow. Great recipe.

I made this on Halloween for my husband and brothers. My husband said this is the best meal I have made in several months! Both of my brothers cleared their bowls and took some home (which never happens). As the previous reviews suggested, I added more rice, and used chicken broth instead of water. I added 2 lbs of shrimp (the extra ½ pound of shrimp were not chopped). I used organic andouille chicken sausage instead of ham, because I did not have ham, but would try both next time. I was amazed of how easy and delicious this meal was. We had a little left over which was a bit thick, so we added some beer to thin it out. Excellent the following day!

Recipe is very good. Made it twice now. I used spicy Italian sausage in stead of ham. I'm a going to add crawfish when I'm able to get some in the future. the shrimp is a must but, crawfish might be even a better spin. Also added a little creole spice and cooked a little longer then the recipe called for. Excellent left over too! Yum!

This was really good, and a healthful alternative to typical Mardi Gras fare. My one complaint is that this recipe should call for 2 cups of rice-- not 3/4 c. From reading other reviews I used 1 1/2 c, but it was still soupier than we like (cooked about an hour once rice was added). I made some alterations, which turned out great. I used chicken & turkey andouille sausage (applegate farms--it was REALLY good, and healthy!), and I used veggie broth instead of water. I like it hot, so I added a chile pepper in adobe sauce (& some of the sauce) to kick spice things up.

Rating: 3
This is a nice and easy recipe. We made it for our monthly potluck, and everyone enjoyed. We did do a few modifications, which we will do again next time: 1) Added spicy sausage...just too good to not include. 2) Cooked the meat first to brown it up a bit. 3) Doubled up the rice, 3/4 cup just didn't seem like enough for 6 servings.

I liked this recipe a lot, but innovated a little. Instead of using cayenne pepper, I used Ancho Chilie Powder, and holy cow did it improve the dish 100%. Would definitely recommend this vs. cayenne. I have made it twice now, and the first time followed the recipe (except for ancho chile powder substitution) the second I innovated some more (added mushrooms, 2x the bell peppers, added some different spices, and used wheat bulgur instead of brown rice (uncle ben's makes 5 and 10 minute rice that you can add to the jambalaya while cooking, and significantly shorten your cooking time) for more fiber. Both the bulgur and brown rice went well with the dish.

Absolutely fantastic. Made this for a dinner party of Australians unfamiliar with Cajun cuisine and they LOVED it. I doubled the recipe, used white rice, chicken broth instead of water, smoked sausage instead of ham, added a healthy sprinkle of cajun seasoning and probably used a bit more onion and green pepper than called for and it was absolutely perfect. Ideal for a dinner party since most of the work is done before your guests arrive! Served with salad, bread and a couple of different hot sauces. Brilliant!

I've always wanted to try jambalaya but thought it would be too involved to prepare. What a happy surprise! This was extremely tasty and incredibly easy, as well. Very slight substitutions...used chicken broth instead of water and smoked beef sausage rather than ham. I also cut back slightly on the cayenne pepper (I prefer flavor over too much heat) and it was PERFECT! I will mention that 45 minutes wasn't enough to fully cook the brown rice...I had to cook it almost 20 additional minutes. Do try this one....the leftovers are as good as the first spoonfuls!

This will replace Emeril's Jambalaya recipe in my book. I used leftover ham from the Ham with Dijon and Balsamic Glaze recipe on this site (which I highly recommend)and used chicken broth instead of water. It was excellent.

I did change a few things...I wanted okra, but al I could find was okra with tomatoes (disappointing as I live in the south) so I used an extra can of tomato/okra...also instead of ham I used Healthy Choice smoked sausage to give it more of that cajun flavor without the fat. Mine was probably a little more soupy do to the okra combo, but that is how I like it. Also used chix broth as previous reviews. Thought it was really good and served more than 6 in my opinion. The smoked sausage gave it a sweeter flavor as well to balance out the spicy (which I made extra spicy )

I made a few changes. I decreased the cayenne to 1/2 tsp since mine is extra hot. I also added 1 tsp each of worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. I added a little bit of chicken stock to the water since I had some in the fridge but found that I needed to add some extra liquid even after cooking for 50 min because the rice still wasn't cooked (used brown basmati rice -not sure if that is why it took so long to cook). I also rubbed the chicken and shrimp with Emeril's essence or Bayou blast before cooking. I really liked that this recipe used lower fat/healthier substitutions. We really liked the flavour and found it easy for a weeknight meal.

Have made this dish several times now. The first time I had to make do with ingredients that I could find here in Britain. They don't have tomato sauce in the UK per se (it generally turns out to be some kind spaghetti sauce), so I used a concentrated tomato puree; I also used smoked bacon. I found it far too strong for my taste with the tomato puree, but it was a hit with hubby and the houseguest. The next time I used fresh tiger prawns, smoked ham and *cringe* Heinz's tomato ketchup. It was not as biting as the first attempt. Subsequent attempts with the ketchup have been huge hits. Now that I'm back in the US, I'm going to make it again, using the specific ingredients. I can't wait. :)

This recipe was delicious but I had to make some serious adjustments to this recipe. I had to up the rice substantially, to 1 2/3 cups from 3/4, way too soupy. Also I had to double the amount of ham and double the amount of chicken so that it would be a satisfying meal for 6 people. I added another clove of garlic as well. A 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. of salt would also be helpful.
