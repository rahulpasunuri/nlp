Choucroute is one of the great classics of French/Alsatian cooking. This is a "fast food" version. If you like choucroute or would like to experience it, I highly recommend the recipe "Choucroute garni" on this site. It takes a bit longer (it needs 1.5 hours in the oven) but the result is definitely worth it. However, the pears are a great substitute for the traditional apple and you can use them in the alternate recipe.
