Wow! I'm new to GF baking; in fact, this is my second attempt at pizza crust. The first had the most horrible hippy-dippy taste. This crust just tastes right. I have some work to do when it comes to shaping the dough (I had no idea how soft it would be), but I don't care. This is it. Hallelujah!

I have been searching a long time for a gluten free pizza crust that I could depend on, and this is the one for me. My (normally gluten eating) boyfriend loved it too, and we have been planning other toppings for next time ever since. What a great find!

I'm *really* impressed with this recipe (I only followed the crust part). I was stunned how well it turned out. I was not expecting much as the words gluten-free historically does not elicit good thoughts or remotely enjoyable "food" for me. Pizza is nothing without a well textured and flavoured foundation. I only used rice and tapioca flours as that is all I had on hand. As mentioned in many reviews, the dough is indeed sticky. I kneaded it by hand and sprinkled on more rice flour until the stickiness settled down. This recipe only made enough for two small fairly thin pizzas, I will double the recipe next time and add some minced garlic to the dough.

My husband made this tonight for the family. He had a VERY hard time with the dough, which stuck to everything like taffy. We eventually had to break out a frosting spreader sprayed with Pam to spread the dough onto the parchment. The texture of the finished product was good enough, but, gosh, the flavor is beany. Maybe next time we'll try it with another flour instead of the chickpea flour? Also note that it makes two small pizzas, which was not enough to feed our family (for all of the work that this dough took).

Dependably tasty. I use silpats, instead of a pizza stone, skipping the parchment paper. After mixing, I let the dough rest for 20 min, then make personal-sized pizzas on silpats sprinkled with cornmeal. Bake 10 min, transfer to a metal sheet, add toppings and broil. We hosted a pizza party and guests with food sensitivities really appreciated a chance to make their very own dream pies. (Also, a small pre-baked crust fits in toaster oven for an easy make-ahead meal.)

I followed this recipe to the letter, it's pretty good. However I would probably go with a baking soda type GF recipe next time because the results of this recipe were very similar to a baking soda type bread. I would also omit using garbanzo bean flour as there is no amount of it that I find palatable and replace it with corn flour it is cheaper and the flavor more neutral. The dough was easy enough to handle with floured or oiled hands and didn't require rolling, I just pressed it onto a pizza stone and allowed it to rise a bit to develop a deeper bready flavor. GF dough does not look like regular bread dough, a point that most recipes don't point out. This GF dough is heavier and more mud like. You can bake this pizza with the toppings on it as long as you use a very hot oven and keep an eye on it.

This is my go to recipe for making GF pizza. Spreading onto parchment is pretty much a necessity IMO. Great flavour, decent texture. There's another recipe for GF crust that I make that I like better, but it's twice as frustrating so gets used about half as frequently.

One of the best gluten free pizza crust that I've tried. Easy and quick to make and appealed to everyone in the family, gluten free or not. Definitely would make this again.

Curse words WERE hurled as I tried to transfer the crust to the baking stone. The crust fell apart into many pieces. It was gooey and sticky. It was a kitchen disaster. Until we ate it anyway. Wow. It tastes really really good. The sauce is even really really good. We've been a gluten free family for many years now, and sometimes you say pizza is absolutely PERFECT even if it's hideous when it tastes like real pizza! So, so, so pleased!

I am new to GF and this recipe is awesome. Actually, I like it better than regular pizza dough and once you have assembled the ingredients it is fairly easy to make. I put the 2 tsp olive oil over dough and then coated my hands and tried to move the crust into a round shape. The first crust was a struggle, dough was stuck all over my hands. It didn't look very good but tastes delicious. Crust is crisp and inside is a little doughy -- just right for me. For my second crust, I put the olive oil over the top of the dough and then sprinkled a little rice flour over it and it went much easier. I preheated a cookie sheet for about 20 minutes in the 400 degree oven and moved the dough, and parchment paper right onto the hot cookie sheet. Next time I will try putting the pizza shell and parchment right on the oven rack.

everyone wants this recipe. we made 2 inch pizza appetizers which were a hit. we experimented not pre-baking the crusts, using rice flour on our hands to make the dough workable and also brushing with oil. all worked but pre baking and brushing with oil made the crispiest crusts. Also tried uncovered pizza stone, foil and parchment. all worked with parchment the easiest and most crispy result. we used no sorghum flour fearing molasses-ey flavors and substituted more chickpea flour anticipating more garbanzo-hummus-like flavor. resulting texture and flavor were both excellent.

This was my first GF baking experience - and it turned out great! I'm very happy there is a way to have pizza... Though it is not near as quick as take out. :) I made a sauce from myrecipes.com that was excellent. This dough doesn't really brown during first bake - just firms up - but the edges do brown in the broiler. Also - if I take out both oven racks, the stone would have to sit on the grill element in my oven - didn't make sense, so left the racks in & baked on bottom. Needed racks for broiling anyway. Maybe I don't get it? Did preheat stone for 45 mins. Will definitely make again.

I am using this recipe to bake directly on the floor of our wood burning pizza oven with great success, but a tweek here and there! The end result is amazing, but it takes a bit of trial and error. First of all, the dough is very sticky, so with well oiled hands I quickly shape it into balls, place on parchmont, then put the dough balls into plastic bags to rise and rest at room temperature. I have found that putting them in the refrigerator for a few hours to a few days makes the dough easier to work with when you are ready to make the pizza. When the oven is ready (and mine is over 600 degrees at this point) I take a wooden pizza peel and put a good amount of white rice flour directly on it and then more on the dough ball and rolling pin and roll out the crust (no parchmont) making sure that there is enough rice flour so that the crust will slide off the peel directly onto the floor of my pizza oven. This dough is not as forgiving as regular pizza dough as it doesn't have elasticity, so you need to take your time and roll it out gently. I am not pre-baking my crusts. Top it with whatever you like, but, make sure it is right before you put it in the oven. My oven bakes this pizza in a couple of minutes. The crust puffs up, crisps and bakes perfectly . I love it with a fine little burnt edge that you can only get in a wood burning oven. My husband has been perfecting his regular pizza crusts and when we have people over they love what he's baking....but then they taste mine and there is never any left!!

I have tried many g-f pizza doughs and this one is the best so far. Very thin and real-pizza-crust like! The stickiness was actually an advantage, given the technique: I simply spread it out with an offset-spatula (metal) and let it rise on the parchment on a pizza peel. Then slid it onto the heated stone and voila! I admit that I did NOT make the tomato sauce but used a good organic canned one.

this is the first time i ever attempted to make pizza dough and it turned out fantastic! although the dough was sticky and somewhat difficult to form into rounds, the end result was worth the effort! i added some caramelized onions under the cheese and basically eliminated the extra olive oil called for on the topping as the sauce seemed to be overly oily. the end result was so delicious and i will definitely use this recipe again!

I've tried a couple of gluten-free pizza crust recipes, and this is definitely the best so far. I'll admit that the darn crust refused to rise when it was supposed to, but once I put it in the 400 degree oven, it started to get bubbly like a regular crust. Added my own favorite toppings (pepperoni, green pepper, onion, black olive, mozzarella) and sauce -- a little broiling right at the end will nicely brown the cheese, but like some other reviewers, I wouldn't recommend doing nothing but broil. Also, instead of chickpea flour, I substituted Authentic Foods Superfine Brown Rice flour (which is by far the best brown rice flour) with no problem at all.

This recipe was the best pizza crust I have ever made.

I actually teared up when the dough began to get bubbly in the oven. I have tried several recipes and this is a winner. Many of my non-gluten eaters never knew the difference. Plus, nothing can beat the ease of this pizza crust. It did not ball up as much as the recipe suggested, but WELL oiled hands made the roll out very easy. I did use my own sauce and toppings and have substituted the chickpea flour for a multi-purpose flour when my chickpea supply was low.

this is excellent! i used the recipe for the dough with a few substitutions (replacing sorghum with soy flour, xanthum with guar gum, and whole with soy milk), and it was perfect. top with olive oil, garlic, wild mushrooms, carmelized onions, goat cheese and rosemary - a very tasty gourmet pizza!

this pizza was delicious! i would definitely make it again. the dough was realllly sticky and hard to roll out without holes but once i got the hang of it, it was fine. the oil really helped in spreading it out. my friend had just come from eating regular pizza and couldnt tell the difference. this ones a winner!

I only made the dough part of the recipe but I did follow the recipe for it exactly. It came out perfectly. I don't think anyone would know it was gluten free unless I told them. The hardest thing was spreading it out. I think next time I will spray a silicon spatula with PAM and see if that works better.

Great recipe! I used a heavy baking pan to pre-bake instead of a stone and then topped it and baked it for 7-10 minutes instead of broiling. I used my own homemade sauce instead of theirs. I made it into three smaller pizzas and froze two for later use using my foodsaver. It was the best GF pizza I've had (tried about 6 recipes). I will use this going forward.

I did not have chickpea flour, but I did have amaranth and used this as a substitute. Delicious! Really satisfied my craving for pizza.

I made the pizza as written, although I added some pepperoni under the cheese. I liked this pizza because the dough actually rose while it baked, giving it a light and airy feel. I used a pizza stone and found that it took about six minutes to get the dough right. I also used the broiler and thought it worked well. I placed the pizza about four inches from the heat source and broiled it for a little over three minutes. Any longer and it would have burned the pizza. I intentionally placed additional toppings under the cheese to avoid scorching them. Overall, I recommend this recipe.

I did not have one of the flours (sorghum), so I made a variation using some other ingredients I have used for gluten free bread, and liked the outcome. I don't suggest broiling the pizza. the top gets burnt and the bottom is cold. (I don't know why they say it is crispy when it can't get crispy in the broiler. I would put the pizza back in the 400 degree oven to cook it. I had to put slices in the toater oven on toast to get the bottom hot and crispy. I like the pizza sauce-it is very basic but really good. I have complicated pizza sauce in the past. I sauteed spinach with olive oil and garlic and added this and it was really tasty. Oh, I used powedered non-fat milk and it worked just fine.

Thank you for this GF recipe! I have been craving a good pizza since my diagnosis, and this one satisfied that "bready" yen. It wasn't rubbery or dry, and it browned nicely.
