I'm not the hugest fan of either spinach or Swiss chard, but I'm always interested in finding good recipes because I know these vegetables are so good for me. That said, this is a really delicious recipe. I think that the inclusion of garlic, olive oil, and red pepper makes the Swiss chard ever so much more palatable and tasty. I'm a convert!

This was my first time cooking any type of chard. I am glad it was a success because I am sure to get a lot in my farm share. I also chopped up the stalks and cooked them for about 4 minutes then added the leaves. I then added it to some left over pasta w/ pesto. YUM!

Good basic dish for my spring time repertoire. I added 2x the garlic and a bit more red pepper. For a real treat, add 2-4 strip of chopped cooked bacon when you add the garlic. It gives the greens an underlying smokiness that improves this basic dish to sublime.

Not bad. Chard is remarkably nutritious raw, so I didn't want to overcook it. I steamed the stems, chopped them up and added them, plus some diced turkey bacon.

I gave it three forks because I think for Swiss Chard it is a good recipe-but I think I'm not a big chard fan. It's lovely to grow in the garden, but I much prefer the flavor of spinach. I had some swiss chard at a potluck recently that had some tomatoes added which helped a bit-so I'll keep trying!!

My favorite swiss chard recipe, I have made this one many times. I have made others using the stems as well but for this I cut almost all the way along both sides and use the leaves. Very classic side dish good as a counterpoint to a rich main like Italian sausage.

Very very good. I sauteed the stems for a few minutes before adding the leaves, and added a bit more garlic. I garnished it with some shaved Parm-Reggiano. Realllly nice.

) for larger chard leaves (which is the norm), they generally mean to get rid of the stems. you CAN eat them, but to do so, you need to cut them in small pieces and cook quite a bit longer than the leaves. once in a while, you'll find baby chard, which has smaller, more delicate stems that you can just toss in with the leaves. it's my favorite kind for that reason.

Can I ask a stupid question? I've never had chard before. When it says "stems trimmed", does that mean the stems are discarded, or that the ends of the stems are trimmed and discarded, and the rest of the stems, along with the leaves, are used?

I burned this dish while fighting with some frozen lobster meat and it STILL tasted amazing. Can't wait to try it without the crispy burned leaves and overcooked garlic!

Fast, healthy, and delicious. Excellent in the middle of the week. Chicken broth was a nice addition

This was a great recipe, and since I had some extra Port in my cupboard, I added about 1/2 c. to this recipe, and the chard turned out sweet and wonderful!

I grew swiss chard last year because I got free seeds-now its a must have in the garden. This recipe is wonderful I've also added some chicken broth with a little parm on top. Can't wait for spring.

This was delicious, but I fingd with chard that if you cut the stems from the leaf and saute them first for a minute, and then throw in the leaves after softening the stems, the chard is more evenly cooked at the end.

This was fabulous! My first time making swiss chard at home. It was very easy and delicious. I wouldn't change a thing!

The shorter cooking time is definitely in order. Used a combination of red and green chard, and threw in some yellow raisins for the sauteeing. My favorite kind of recipe: simple, delicious, flavorful, attractive, and healthful.

I'm Greek, and traditionally we boil Swiss Chard until it's completely limp and soggy. Well not anymore! I love this recipe because it's fast as can be and it's taking an old favorite and making it just that much better.

Easy, but just okay--not much flavor. Needed something more.

Very tasty & simple to prepare. Some of my guests had not tried chard before my dinner party, now they love it!

This was a very tasty side dish. Simple to prepare. A nice alternative to spinach.

I make this recipe almost every week. It has just the right level of spice from the red pepper flakes and garlic. And it's simple enough that my children will occasionally eat it.

Simply splendid or splendidly simple, not sure which, but it is a fabulous dish. If you serve it to someone and they profess not to like it you can safely assume that you have a dangerously demented person on your hands. I upped the garlic and the hot pepper flakes and it worked even better for me but it still works wonderfully well if you follow the original specifications.

So good! I used the red-stemmed chard and added a little more cook time on there and didn't add any salt. Taste it before you decide to salt it, chard is already naturally rich in sodium.

I had never tried Chard and I used this recipe and now I love it. Really easy and quick to prepare and with the cheese tortellini turned out fantastic.

Wow. I got some Swiss chard from my farm co-op and had no idea what to do with it. I used this recipe as a bed for some cheese tortellini and shaved a little fresh parm over the top. It was terrific and to my amazement, all three young children in my house ate it. A major victory!

Excellent dish! Easy to cook. A nice change from the usual vegetable side dishes.

This is a fabulous and easy accompaniment to any entree. My children LOVE it. Sometimes I vary the recipe by using one bunch of spinach and one bunch of chard or by adding 1/2 cup chopped onion to the chard stem mixture. Once I even added chopped fresh jalapenos (red and green) and served the greens and their juice over basmati rice - YUM

A great recipe ! I love swiss chard and grow it . Always looking for new ways to prepare it. I served this with grilled Halibut, baked chicken and ham. It was great with all 3.

Awesome. I added a little more red pepper when I made this the second time. Thank goodness for the folks with gardens in my office. Their excess bounty is making a great spring dining experience for me.

A great recipe for all that zesty, red chard you have growing in your spring vegetable garden. Serve with a garlic stuffed, rare-roast fillet mignon or perhaps a herb crusted rack of lamb and mashed white & sweet potatoes all washed down with a well rounded red wine that's full of flavor.
