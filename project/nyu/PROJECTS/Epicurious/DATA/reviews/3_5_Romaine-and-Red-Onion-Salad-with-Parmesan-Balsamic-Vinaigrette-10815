A very nice basic salad. Nothing special, but would certainly make it again, as you almost always have everything on hand. Certainly give it a try! Easy to do!

I made this salad as written (a second time) and thought it, including the dressing, was VERY good. I will make it again.

I made the salad part of the recipe which is hardly a recipe but chose not to use this dressing based on the reviews(I did not rate the recipe). I used the Parmesan Balsamic Vinaigrett recipe from this website - because I tried it before and other reviews referred to it. Very simple salad which we enjoyed.

I made the vinaigrette portion of this salad last night to use with a different salad of veggies (spinach, radishes, red onion, tomatoes, avocados). I tripled the recipe so I would have leftovers for another salad. Last night the vinaigrette seemed very flavorless, and tonight the leftover dressing had no more flavor and had hardened like glue--could hardly shake it loose in the container. WILL NEVER MAKE THIS AGAIN!!! A much better vinaigrette is titled "Parmesan Balsamic Vinaigrette", Gourmet, August, 2001 (also on this site).

A family favourite. Very tasty and sooo simple to make. I also added cherry tomatoes - lovely presentation.

Loved the salad dressing, but needed to double, as we ran out. Salad was good and made an attractive presentation. But, the salad dressing was the star of the show.

Since moving from Tucson it has been hard to find decent markets and/or restuarants. This is a wonderful recipe! Simple, delicious, all the ingredients can be found in this God Forsaken land, and for us a main course often times with cheese and fruit.

This parmesan balsamic vinaigrette is my favorite salad dressing recipe! I usually serve it on mixed greens with halved cherry tomatoes, and toasted pecans (instead of croutons). Fabulous!

Added more Romaine then called for and used some Marie Calendar large size croutons. Also added Roma tomatoes. Almost lie a Panzanella salad. Nice flavour, not overpowering; at least to me.

Pretty good. Very garlicky. I added more vinegar than the recipe called for. I think my dinner guests found the salad a bit over powering.

Dressing was excellent as was salad, Was a good contrast to the the chicken with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms
