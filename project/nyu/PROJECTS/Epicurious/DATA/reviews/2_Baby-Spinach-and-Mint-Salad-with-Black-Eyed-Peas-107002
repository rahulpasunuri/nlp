This was the worst salad I have ever eaten and I took it to a friend's for dinner. The consensus was it tasted like dandelions. Do not attempt. Too many flavor trying to mingle.

I concur that the peas don't go with the spinach. I loved the peas separately and the dressing on the spinach was yummy. I would make the peas again but perhaps mix them with some shredded carrots and dices celery and perhaps some diced sweet onion. The spices for the peas would be good with soybeans also or any firm pea or bean.

I needed a salad for color and freshness to balance a meal of Pork chops and garlicky mashed potaoes, also wanted to use mint from my garden. I wasn't sure how this combo would work....it didn't. The spinach/mint combination was fine, and the very light dressing with the taste of orange was really delicious, but the black-eyed peas didn't go at all. I felt they added nothing to the dish in the way of flavor or texture. I might do the greens and dressing again, but I will add something with crunch and sharpness (croutons or toasted nuts, sharp cheese, even apples or pears). My guests ate the greens and left the forlorn black-eyed peas on the plate. They did rave about the dressing

My family really loved this salad tonight. It went really well with the curried pumpkin soup I made to go with it. The spice of the curry and the freshness of the spinach and mint with a hint of spice on the black-eyed peas really made for a light "can't wait for Autumn" meal. Make sure you serve it with warm fresh bread. Enjoy!
