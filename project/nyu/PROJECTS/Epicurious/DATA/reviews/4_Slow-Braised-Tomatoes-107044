followed recipe precisely and this was just delicious. Served it as a side with pork chops. Have some left over and am going to toss it with pasta.

I would give this 5 forks if I could! It is simply delicious. I followed it precisely, and have used it as a toss with hot pasta, a topping for quick pizza, or as a brushetta. I made it a 2nd time and froze in individual containers so that my excess summer tomatoes can be thawed whenever I want to savor them until their return next year! Highly recommend.Used whatever tomotoes I had, including cherries. Yummy!

I was looking for a recipe to make use of some tomatoes that were just getting past their prime. This was the perfect solution. The smell of tomatoes and basil cooking slowly in the oven is irreplaceable and the resulting dish was delicious. We served the tomatoes with some grilled sausages over polenta. I agree with the previous reviewer that the leftover oil is too flavorless for pasta sauce itself, but it was awesome on bread and I'll probably be using it for other dishes. Maybe to saute some squash...

Really delicious - I made this as a side dish with a simple baked halibut and nice crusty bread for a simple and healthy meal. I also cheated on the time by baking for only 1.5 hours at 275F and only about 1/4inch deep olive oil.

Wow...a bit of work, but really good. Creative and showy. Delicious tasting. I tried using the left over oil on pasta; which didn't have enough flavor. The leftover oil was delicious as a dip for bread.
