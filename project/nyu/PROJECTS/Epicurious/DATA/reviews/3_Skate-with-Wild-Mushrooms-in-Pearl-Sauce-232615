Nice presentation but a little overly comlicated

I found this recipe to be a little over the top too (like the previous reviewer), but that may be because I was looking for a simpler sunday night supper. Nonetheless, skate. I was surprised how easy it was to pull off, and will have it again. Here on Long Island it is plentiful and cheap. It presents elegantly on the plate as well.

This recipe was not that exciting for all the work. The sauce was perhaps too subtle for me, although the technique of adding tapioca pearls was interesting.

I am not a big fan of scallops and to me, skate tastes like old scallops cooked with their orange part. My roommate went kayak fishing and brought 2 skates home. After cooking it 4 different ways to aquaint myself with this odd fish, I found I liked it best sauteed with white wine and tomatos but this recipe is a close 2nd. It helps to make sure you skin the skate within hours after catching it or the amonia leaches into flesh. You can soak in milk afterwards. This recipe helps the flavor of skate. You dont need the tapioca but it adds an interesting texture. The mushrooms are great.

Skatefish is absolutely wonderful in it's delicate flavor and texture as it doesn't get chewy like a lot of other seafood. I would recommend not going to heavy on the sauce as it will quickly over power the fish.

skate is relatively inexpensive and flavorful
