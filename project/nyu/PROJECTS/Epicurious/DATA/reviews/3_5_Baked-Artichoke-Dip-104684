I prepared this recipe with fresh artichoke hearts from my garden and served as a side dish, just because our harvest has been so incredible large that I run out of ideas. This turned out really good.

Rating: 2
I felt compelled to introduce several changes that I think improved on the recipe: 1- Instead of light mayonnaise and light sour cream, I substituted crème fraîche 2- Instead of "garlic powder" I used a real garlic clove 3- No need for onion salt, just normal salt (but taste first) 4- I used a real Pecorino Romano, made of sheep milk, not cow 5- I needed to bulk it up so I added some frozen spinach that was wilted in vegetable bouillon 6- I did not add the paprika

This makes a great filling for mini phyllo dough appetizers. I added a bit of Worscester sauce.

This is delicious. What people comment on is that you can really taste the artichokes - a much lighter and less cheesey dish than most. This actually works as a nice appetizer before dinner - it doesn't fill people up, and they still can enjoy dinner. This isn't a guy's football-game type of appetizer.

Yummy and easy. The most popular of three things I brought to a Memorial Day BBQ. Other guests were fighting over who got to keep the few leftovers. Doubled the recipe & added one 10oz. box of chopped spinach. To manage oven space, microwaved to warm, then stuck under broiler for a few minutes, which worked fine.

I gave this 3 forks because it is more of a "guide recipe" in my opinion. I'm not sure that it needed it, but I buttered a glass dish to bake it in. I used a little more sour cream than mayo, used olive oil mayo instead, chives in place of the marjoram, 1 large minced clove garlic instead of powder, and onion powder instead of onion salt. I mixed the mixture with a mozz and parm blend (about 1 cup) added cayenne, and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. Then I topped it with fresh parm and the cheese blend and broiled on hi for like 10 minutes until bubbly. We ate the WHOLE thing.. (me and my husband)! I served it with "Stacey's" pita chips- PERFECTO! Next time I will be adding sauteed onions and mushrooms in a bit of sherry to see how it works. Fresh spinach would be a great addition also! So much better than any restaurant!

I'm not sure everyone is making this recipe as it is written. The "Hamilton" recipe everyone refers to is from a reviewer in Hamilton, Ontario as follows: I have been making a baked artichoke dip for years with rave reviews. Its very easy! 2 cups Hellman's regular mayo, 2 cups (or more) shredded asiago cheese, minced garlic (2 or 3 cloves), 14 oz. marinated artichoke hearts chopped. Mix together (can be done day before). Hollow out round loaf of bread (save innards). Put dip in hollowed out loaf and bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees. Serve with chopped bread (from the middle of the loaf and another loaf too). Its wonderful and oh so easy. Everyone will ask you for the recipe. (Hamilton, Ontario). **************************** I doubled and modified the above recipe, with rave reviews: 4 cups Hellman's regular mayo, 4 cups shredded asiago cheese, minced garlic (4-6 cloves), 28 oz. marinated artichoke hearts chopped, 1 package frozen spinach DRAINED, 2 tbsp lemon juice. Mix together (can be done day before) in a casserole dish. Top with 2 cups shredded parmesan. Bake for 75 minutes at 350 degrees. Serve with chopped bread, sliced baguette, or water crackers.

This was gobbled up at a Christmas Eve party, now I'm being asked to bring it for New Years Eve. I used 3/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream (as suggested by another reviewer). Used regular salt (not onion) and basil instead of marjoram.

I also used the Hamilton recipe with one major change. I thought that 2 cups of mayo seemed too much - so I split it: 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream. I liked the sour cream taste in the dip and the Asiago cheese YUMMM. I did not serve it in a bread bowl and used grilled flat bread for dippers. My guests loved it!

While I agree that there are better and richer artichoke dips, and I have been known to make them for special occasions, I think the purpose of this recipe is to lighten up the old standard. For those who are watching their diets, this is a good enough stand-in for the original. No need to reinvent the wheel here. The number of forks rated on this is misleading as it is mostly based on those who completely altered the original recipe.

Misplaced my copy of the Hamilton 2002 recipe that I've used for years and came looking. What a surprise to see how many others love it too! I bake in a roasted garlic loaf from the store and add the roasted garlic to the dip. I also add a small can of chopped chiles (drained). The key is the Asiago cheese. Thanks NJ for copying in 09!

Very tasty and oh so simple. It got gobbled up in less than 15 minutes at the bridal shower I made it for. I added some spinach (about a 1/2 cup, thawed and squeezed dry) and accidentally added all the cheese to the mix, leaving none for the top. Came out a little dry as a result. Next time will add a chopped jalepeno, and either put the "browning" cheese aside or add a little more mayo. But all said and done, a tasty, healthy, impressive dip!

I have made this three times already and now realize I have to double the recipe because it is gone in a minute.I carve out a round bread and bake it in that. I use fresh garlic and fresh ground pepper and kosher salt as my seasonings. It is a great addition to any cocktail party or shower.

You would never know that this recipe requires light mayo and sour cream. Neither the taste nor the texture gives it away. Although I doubled all of the ingredients EXCEPT for the artichoke, the dip still had a strong, almost lemony flavor that overpowered it. And it needed more garlic powder.

It's hard to go wrong with artichoke dip although I can't imagine how this recipe would taste if I used as little mayo and sour cream as it calls for. I used all the same ingredients and process except that I used 3/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup of sour cream instead. It always gets great reviews. I also use tortilla chips instead of bread. The chips lend a saltiness to the dip that the bread doesn't have.

This dip was really delicious. I modified it a bit and increased the portion size and it was more than enough for a party of 10+. My version had 1.5 cups of mayo, 1.5 cups lowfat sour cream, 3 cloves miced fresh garlic, 1 box frozen spinach (boiled, drained and then mixed with about half of garlic) , 2+ cups grated cheese (romano and parmesan) and 3 cans of artichoke hearts (in water). I topped this mixture with 2T of the cheese and sprinkled with paprika and baked for 20 minutes at 350. Served with slices of sourdough bread. Delish!

The comments to this recipe crack me up -- artichoke dip clearly stikes a deep chord in many of us. Not only do we have many, many instances of people who love/hate the recipe after changing 90% of it, but we have a competing recipe in the comments that garners the same vehement responses! But to those of you who want to try the recipe as is, it is quite good and lighter than the average artichoke dip. My three-year-old liked it and it may be the first vegetable he has eaten in 6 months. Enjoy!

This is my new favorite artichoke dip and I've tried many in my day. It's flavorful and not too heavy. I served it with toasted French baguette bread slices and used the regular (not light) mayo I already had -- it seemed healthier than average.

Rating: 4
Even though I altered this recipe a little to suit my taste, I am giving it 4 stars b/c it is a great core recipe for a fabulous dip. It is the best version of Artichoke dip I have tasted thus far. The substitutions I made were as follows: added a big clove of minced fresh garlic, deleted the marjoram and the onion salt but added a touch of kosher salt to make up for it, used freshly grated parmaggiano reggiano instead of the romano, and used full fat mayo and sour cream (I know, I'm naughty, but it was for company, after all.) I served it with bagel chips and my guests went crazy for it. I love the fact that this version uses substanitally less mayo and/or sour cream than traditional recipes. Not only is it healthier, but it allowed the taste of the artichokes to be more in the forefront. This recipe does not yield a lot, however, so if you are making it for a large crowd you may want to consider doubling it. Fabulous recipe, thank you!

Delicious, delicious, delicious! Gooey comfort at its best. I recommend using a pre-packaged blend of pecorino, romano and parmesan (or something similar). I added 1/2 of a finely chopped shallot and a chopped garlic clove. I didn't use any onion powder but did use the garlic salt. I also added about 1/2 c of spinach and this added more great flavor and texture. Served it in a bread bowl.

Way yummy! Be sure to squeeze all the juice out of the hearts and then chop them fairly fine so none of those occasional big, tough bits show up. Easy, easy, easy - prep time 5 minutes for dip. Use store bought crustini (Wegman's is delicious)instead of fussing with the bread and you have reduced the aggravation factor to zero.

I have made this numverous times and its always a hit with the kids scaping the bottom of the dish. I usually double the recipe and use regular mayo and sour cream.

I have looked everywhere for a GREAT spinach and artichoke recipe and this became my starting point for creating what turned out to be a delicious dip. Added the following: 1/2 large onion (chopped) and 2 cloves garlic (minced) browned in 1 T olive oil (omitted garlic and onion powder); 1/2 cup chicken stock to deglaze the onion pot (reduced until barely any liquid left); one cup cooked and drained spinach; 1/2 cup chopped and seeded roma tomatoes; 1 additional Tbsp each mayo and sour cream; 2 Tbsp boursin cheese (basically cream cheese with garlic and herbs); salt and pepper. We loved it and will make it again!

It was fast, easy, and delicious!

WOW!! That is what everyone at my dinner party said. It was wonderful and did not last for 30 minutes.

I doubled the recipe and that only made enough for an 8X8 baking dish. Absolutely Wonderful!!!

If you follow the recipe exactly, it is kind of bland but still yummy. With a few of the reviewer modifications, it is wonderful!!

This is one of the best artichoke dip recipes I've come across. I added fresh garlic and spinach and some additional parmesan. I also left out the salt. It was a huge hit at the royal banquet where it was served.

Give me a break! I eat artichoke dip a couple of times a year at most. Hello.... that doesn't make you fat. Overindulging in high-fat, high-calorie foods on a daily basis is what causes obesity. Even eating this so-called more healthful dip too often will do your waistline no favors. Eat what you like in moderation, get some exercise, and stop stressing about a party food that you consume on special occasions.

A tried-and-true top 10 appetizer. Agree that the OLD version (aka Hamilton submittal) is also OLD school, with tons of fat. Lighten up America, and learn to enjoy taste without dollops of mayo and sour cream. My only modification is go increase light sour cream and light mayo to 1/3 C. each, and sprinkle with slivered almonds. Yummmmm.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and cannot understand how individuals would prefer one with so much mayonnaise.

I made this for a party and it was just "okay" -- the restaurant's version must be superior to the home version because it simply wasn't that tasty. I made the following Hot Spinach and Artichoke Dip for Superbowl and it was delicious: Using an electric mixer, mix 6 ounces cream cheese, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese, 1 or 2 minced garlic cloves, 1t red pepper flakes, 1T Worcestershire sauce and a healthy squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Fold in by hand 1 cup thawed chopped spinach (squeezed dry) and two 13-1/2 oz cans of artichoke hearts roughly chopped. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Put in a baking dish and bake at 400-degrees for about 30 minutes until bubbling and brown on top.

this is alright. nothing near so good as the dips i've had at potlucks, but that's probably my fault, for accidentally letting a good bit of english mustard powder fall in.

This is SO good! I made it for a party and most guests did not move too far away from this. The best Artichoke Dip I have tasted, and not difficult at all to make. The trick I think is to use Marinated Artichokes, maybe this is why this recipe has such mixed reviews.

I love Artichokes. This recipe was great! I doubled it, used whole, rather than Light, mayo and additional amounts of sour cream and added spinach for colour. Adding the spinach enhanced the flavour but made it drier. I added more mayo.The recipe was a bit bland so I also added Tobascco and lemon juice to enhance the flavour. The original recipe rates a 2 but with the additions, it rates a possible 3..

I didn't love this dip-- it lacked a good hit of flavor. I was still searching for an artichoke dip to make me swoon when I tried the recipe submitted by the cook in Hamilton. That did the trick! I modified Hamilton's recipe slightly by adding a package of chopped frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) and substituting parmesan instead of asiago. My guests nearly licked the bowl! Try that recipe if this one fails to wow you.

Thought that this was pretty good, although I needed to add a little lemon juice for some extra flavor. Also, the first time I made it, I added spinach as others suggested. That made it come out a little too dry - if you add spinach, you may want to increase the amounts of mayo and sour cream to compensate.

I spread the mixture on a sliced baguette and broil. Thanks for all the great recipes you provide on this site. I use it weekly.

regarding the cook from Hamilton, Ontario - do you cover the bread with foil? Sounds great. thanks

The VERY best artichoke dip recipe uses the old one, mayo, parmesan & artichokes, with the addition of a can of chopped green chilies! Try it, its the best!!!

I thought this dip was ok, but not nearly as good as I expected based on previous reviews. I then tried the artichoke dip recipe that was suggested by the cook from Hamilton, Ontario, and THAT was GREAT! I made only one modification - I added a 10 oz pkg of frozen chopped spinach (thawed and drained). It was fantastic and everyone gobbled it up! Thank you!!

You can simplify this dip to make a fabulous topping for bruschetta. Mix real mayo, chopped artichoke hearts (marinated or not), parmesan and scallions (optional). Spread on baguette slices and broil until they bubble. Quick and delicious!

I have been making a baked artichoke dip for years with rave reviews. Its very easy! 2 cups Hellman's regular mayo, 2 cups (or more) shredded asiago cheese, minced garlic (2 or 3 cloves), 14 oz. marinated artichoke hearts chopped. Mix together (can be done day before). Hollow out round loaf of bread (save innards). Put dip in hollowed out loaf and bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees. Serve with chopped bread (from the middle of the loaf and another loaf too). Its wonderful and oh so easy. Everyone will ask you for the recipe.

This recipe, as stated above, is salty and rather bland. Tried this a second time, adding 10-oz chopped spinach (squeezed dry) and 2 chopped green onions. Like it much better and will make again.

This was ok - not great. I found it rather bland so I add Worcestershire and Tabasco. Still had plenty left over the next day. I spread the leftovers on bread with a little extra cheese and placed it in the broiler. I think I liked it better that way.

Made this for Super Bowl w/tortilla chips...it vanished right away! I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and increased the creamy stuff to 1/3 cup, used Parmesan instead of Romano (less salty). I also added about 1/4 cup of cooked, chopped spinach. Quite the hit, even among my "foodie" friends!

Boring recipe, which definitely read better than the results. Would not make again.

I served this dip with tortilla chips. It was really tasty. I think I will double some of the creamy ingredients next time to make it easier to scoop up. But, it was very tasty as is.

I made this for a party that I had and it was a hit. I substituted the mayo and used all sour cream and added an extra Tbls. of Romano. I also had people asking me for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

This dip was definately a hit. We served it with home made whole wheat Italian flatbread baked on tiles. Definately a winning combination! We also served fresh guacamole for variation. This could be enough for a dinner--especially with a salad. Try the greek country salad.

i thought this recipe was terrible. I increased the amount of sour cream and mayo and it tasted like baked mayo. I don't know why everbody likes this so much.

I love this recipe. It's easily thrown together at the last minute with ingredients I usually have on hand. It disappears quickly, but when it doesnt, it's great the next day with roasted veggies in a tortilla.

I made this last night for a Christmas party and it was great! I made a double batch and increased the sour cream and mayo to 3/4 c. I also included a large clove of fresh garlic and fresh parmesan.

I've had a variety of artichoke dips before, but this is the best. I was surprised that the flavor was as great with the low fat ingredients and probably half of what is in other recipes. I served it at a party yesterday and will make a double batch for tomorrow evening's get together. This disappears quickly!

I've made this twice. The first time I follwed the recipe exactly. The second time I increased the sour cream and mayo to 1/4 cup (not quite as much as others recommended). It was a hit both times.

it's artichoke dip. that's it. it's not a good use of fresh artichokes by any means. there are definately better dips out there, i haven't found them yet, but i'll keep looking and skip remaking this one. as an appetizer...of course people will eat it up...they're starving. my family did too, and confessed after i put better things on the table.

I doubled this recipe for a recent dinner party and it didn't last long.... Served with homemade pita chips (black pepper and parmesan flavored), everyone loved it. As recommended, I also increased the sour cream and mayo ingredients to 1/3 cup each.

You can't go wrong with this...good, easy and quick to make. I took it to a dinner party and got a lot of compliments. I also increased the sour cream and the mayo, since everyone else who did seemed happy with the results. I ended up using reg. sour cream as the store was out of the light kind.

This was very good. Very creamy, but a little too salty for my taste. I addes a little more mayo and sour cream plus I added cayenne pepper and a dash or so of Worcestershire sauce. Would be good with a little crab as well.

My picky 7 year old ate this up with a spoon. I also increased mayo and sour cream to 1/3 cup, comes out great!

I agree with adding the additional mayo/sour cream. It was delicious. Would definitely double the batch and make frequently. Everyone loves this even though they may think they don't like artichokes! Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty. My husband and I finished this in 15 minutes. Served it with sliced baguettes.

There was a previous review altering the amount of mayo and sour cream to 1/3 cup each. Doing this, makes the recipe fabulous. I have made it several times since first finding it and everyone wants the recipe!! It's now a staple for us!!

My fussy 6 yr old who lives on pasta, bread, and yogurt, LOVED this. Sat down eating it like it was soup! And she NEVER touches anything with veggies in it. Served it at my in laws and everyone loved it.

Fabulous! Loved the tang. I served this as an appetizer followed by FETTUCCINE QUATRO FORMAGGI. I upped the mayo and sourcream to 1/3 c. like another comment suggested, and used a 2 1/2 c. ramekin. I'm sure a casserole dish would work too. (Don't need to go to a fancy cooking store for this one, folks!)

Not beyond compare, but very good. I had lots of compliments. I would definately make it again. I used all of the artichoke and a bit more romano cheese.

Have made this several times already and still can't believe its low-fat ingredients--tastes too good to be true!! I like to add about 2 oz fresh parmesan instead of Romano.

I had an artichoke dip at a party recently, so I sought one out here. Not disappointed. I liked the marjoram flavor, and the lowered fat aspects of this recipe, and my guests really liked it too. Will make again for sure.

Good recipe. Needs some modification: instead of garlic powder and onion salt, I used a sautee of a vidalia onion and minced garlic. I also added chopped frozen spinach (be sure to drain VERY WELL and squeeze excess moisture from it) and upped the mayo and sour cream to 1/3 c. each.

Fantastic. Not nearly as goopy as most artichoke dips and very tangy.

We served this dip with Bremmer wafer crackers at our child's first birthday party. It was the favorite dip that we served. We was very good and we highly recommend it.

I made a couple of alterations to this dip: I cut the amount of artichokes in half, added 5 oz. of chopped spinach, and used half romano/parmesan cheese. It was excellent; my fiance is already asking when I am going to make it again. I love coming across dishes that involve this little prep. I can hardly wait to make it for friends during the March Madness NCAA Tournament...for once, I will be able to watch the games rather than spend all of my time in the kitchen preparing half time snacks!

I haven't made this as of yet, but I do make something quite similar. To one 14 oz can of chopped artichoke hearts I add 2/3 C chopped salami, 1/2 C shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 C parmesan cheese, 1/2 C mayo, & 3 Tbs chopped green onions. Place in glass pie plate. Sprinkle w/1/4 C shredded cheddar cheese & about 1 T chopped green onions. Bake @ 350 for about 20 min until bubbly. Delicious!

This dip is flavourful. I mixed parmesan with the romano cheese to cut the salty taste. My guests did not leave one bite!

This is by far the easiest and best tasting artichoke dip I have made. Great artichoke flavor and not too heavy or greasy.
