Although I have not yet made these, take note that if you want to bring these to a Kosher Seder, do not use flour as suggested in preparing the cookie sheets. That would render them unKosher! I suggest using parchment.

Wow! I wished I'd known sooner how easy it is to make delicious macaroons. I love macaroons and these definitely hit the spot when I had a macaroon craving. The whole family loved them and we made them several times. The last time I made them, I accidentally doubled the almond extract, so I halved the vanilla to compensate. They were delicious that way, also. Not only do these have fantastic flavor and texture, but they are so quick and fun and inexpensive to make! We generally triple the recipe (about a bag of coconut). They also keep well. I may like them better a day or two later.

My family are coconut and pineapple lovers. I've been looking for a great recipe for Coconut Macaroons. I didn't realize how easy they were to make. I quadrupled the recipe and made 16 cookies. I thought the ratio of sugar and extracts was perfect, as other recipes had far more sugar added. Couldn't be happier now that I found the perfect Coconut Macaroon recipe.

I also doubled the recipe but whipped the egg whites so they would be a bit airy. I don't like dense macaroons. I added orange extract and orange zest. I used a tablespoon to drop the cookies onto the sheet and baked for about 18 minutes. It yielded 16 macaroons. Next time I would add less sugar since the sweetened coconut is sweet enough for me. Tasty and easy to make.

Like other reviewers, I doubled the recipe and dropped mounded teaspoons to make them more bite-sized. I didn't have almond extract (odd), so I substituted a equal amounts of coconut and butter extracts... DEE-LISH! I used parchment paper sprayed with a bit of cooking oil and had no trouble with them sticking. Mine didn't brown as nicely as the photo so I popped them under a low broiler to give them a toasted look. Mine were chewy and delightful... definitely a keeper.

These are absolutely delicious!!!! Instead of making four big ones, I made 1 tablespoon sized cookies and that made about 8-10. I also doubled the batch, which came out perfectly!!!! I will make these again no doubt

Quick, easy, and tasty! I'd definitely make these again. Also, the recipe makes just the right amount to satisfy the craving without tempting you into eating 8.

These are quick to make and passable but by no means impressive. I've had coconut macaroons that are more flavorful and that have a much more appealing texture.

These are delicious, but for Passover, don't use flour for anything! A spray of oil on the foil will take care of sticking. For a dairy meal, instead of the egg white, try sweetened condensed meal (without corn syrup, for Passover). A can of sweetened condensed milk plus all the coconut that it will hold and bake until brown. Also yummy. I like the pure coconut flavor without extracts or flavorings. Also, I like to dip the cooled macaroons in melted dark (or even unsweetened) chocolate there is very ittle that cannot be improved with dark chocolate.

Great recipe. I would make it again. However I recommend halving the amount of almond extract.

I was a little unhappy with this recipe because it turned out dry and the cookies broke easily. I was hoping for a smooshy mooshy gooey macaroon. I did however, really enjoy the flavor and it was easy and quick.

Great easy recipe - mine took less than 15 minutes to brown on the top (but I made 7 small cookies instead). I sometimes add mini chocolate chips which work great.

These were very easy, I followed the instructions for 5 times the recipe and used grated orange peel and 1/2 cup ground almonds as well. I dipped the bottoms in chocolate, just bring them to room temp before you serve them. This will become part of my passover repertoire.

Very good and extremely simple. I made 10 small cookies rather than 4 big ones. Just adjust the time and watch carefully.

I really loved this recipe! It's quick and easy and I like that it only makes a few cookies, since there are only two of us. I made 7 cookies(2 bite size) rather than 4 and added about a 1/2 tsp.lime zest b/c I was out of almond extract. I would add even more zest next time. I used the foil as suggested and they came off very easily.

These are deeeeliicous! Good thing I tripled the recipe...Also, I added about a tablespoon of orange zest to the mix, and after they cooled I drizzled dark chocolate over the tops, which made them a more unique addition to my annual holiday-cookie-gift-extravaganza...and they were devoured by all!

I made these for Passover. I used a whole bag of coconut and multiplied the recipe by 6. I added mini chocolate chips. I had to cook for 25-30 minutes so they would brown. Very quick and easy to make.

Rating: 4
These are so easy to make, and relatively healthy! I followed the advice of the person who used the entire bag of coconut for a larger number of cookies. I think using your hands to mix allows the results to be slightly more compact and therefore keeps the cookies from falling apart so easily. I found that baking them just a little longer so that the bottoms browned made them easier to handle, too. Wonderful cookies.

Perfect for a quick and tasty weeknight treat. I normally find almond extract overpowering so I used a couple of drops and it was just perfect. Accidentally left them in the oven for 25 minutes and they were still delicious.

These were so easy I will definitely make them again when I have a dessert craving. I took the advice of other reviewers and not only doubled the recipe but experimented with different sprinkled toppings- cinnamon, chocolate & honey were my favorite toppings I tried!

I double the recipe every time and make them the size of 2 bite brownies, bake about 9 mins. Right before I put them in the oven i sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on the tops of each one. To die for!!

A PS to my post below: I used a scant 3/4 cup of cocoanut, loosely packed. Perhaps that is why mine didn't fall apart.

These worked fine for me, although baking them on greased wax paper wasn't the best choice. I added a few chocolate chips and baked them for 22-23 minutes. They stuck together fine and the consistency wasn't too dry. Maybe baking them 30+ minutes as some have done here is too long and dries them out? These are quick and easy to mix up, and I love the quantity-- just right for a quick, little something sweet after dinner, with no leftovers to tempt us further.

I didn't like that the coconut fell apart easily. I like my macaroons to be gooey and creamey and this recipe just didn't have it.

Not very sweet. I prefer the Joy of Cooking recipe which uses condensed milk.

very easy, very moist and chewy. I tripled the recipe for Christmas and had no problem with using foil and took about the full 20 min to brown the bottoms.

Delicious coconut cookies. I wanted a larger quantity so I used one bag of flaked coconut, 5 egg whites, 5 Tbls. sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. almond extract. I just used my hands to mix it all together. I used a 1 Tbls. scoop to make perfectly shaped macaroons. I baked according to the recipes, this yielded 27 pretty little cookies. I dipped the bottoms of half of the batch in chocolate and left the rest. This is a perfect macaroon recipe.

I added 1/3 cup almond meal to this small recipe and it made it so good! Straight from the oven they are perfect so I'm worried they might become a little dry as they cool. I think I'll try an extra egg white if that happens. YUM!

Great recipe, I add slivered almands to this, then after baking and cooled dip the bottom into a dark melted chocolate. Ohhh, it tastes incredible! A favorite for sure. Easy too.

I really like coconut, and this recipe was really easy. I think it does need some tinkering when it comes to how to get it to stick together. I added a teaspoon of corn syrup to help it stick together. I love the crispy little mounds!

I quadrupled this recipe and I think I used too much coconut - 3 cups - as it came out a bit crumbly, even though I added an extra egg white (5 instead of 4). It was delicious though. I also used Splenda instead of sugar (equal amount), as my dad is diabetic and wanted in on the treats, and I added 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts for some crunch. I will try dipping some in melted semi-sweet chocolate, maybe that will keep them together a bit better. Overall a good recipe, but it needs some more liquid in there.

I will definitely use the foil next time...I used parchment and that is probably why the bottoms didn't brown! Oops!!!

Rating: 3
I gave this recipe 3 forks because the flavor was good, but I think I put too much coconut in...there are no guidelines for how the coconut should be packed (loosely, tightly, etc), and my batch definitely had too much coconut in it. They were very chewy. If I make it again, I will use less coconut and pack it LOOSELY. They took 34 minutes to bake and still the bottoms were not browned as in the picture.

Incredibly easy and delicious. I didn't double the recipe because I wanted to make sure they were good. I am going to replace my other macaroon recipes, this one is a keeper. I used parchment paper instead of foil,butter and flour. Had no problems.

These were so easy to make and fabulous! Dipped half in melted semi-sweet chocolate as some others recommeded. AMAZING. I quadrupled the recipe and then had to make another batch because almost all of them were eaten right away! Next time I'm going to try dipping in chocolate and then rolling in chopped toasted almonds. Definitely give these a try!

Use the Reynolds Non-stick foil, which was born for this recipe! I quadrupled the recipe and added a 1/4 cups of mini choco chips. As others have said, it did take a full 30 minutes to brown properly. They come together in a snap. I might try added a little almond flour next time for a different taste/consistancy. Really really easy... and perfect for Passover.

Lining the cookie sheets with parchment paper, letting the macaroons cool for at least 15 minutes and carefully peeling them off eliminates the butter/flour/foil step. I quadrupled the recipe and measured out the mixture using a very small ice cream scoop (about 1 rounded tablespoon each). I flattened them slightly as these cookies don't spread much. Mine, too, took about 30 minutes to cook. I half dipped them in dark chocolate and they were a big hit.

This recipe was perfect. I melted semi-sweet chocolate bits in a double boiler and dipped one side of the macaroons, stored them in the fridge for an hour and they were unbelievable! Just like a Mounds bar! Yummy!!

This is a great easy recipe. I certainly got more than 4 cookies from it. I would challenge the "low fat" icon-- coconut is a 35% fat food, and the FDA describes no fat as less than 3 g fat per serving.

Actually, I was very happy to find a recipe that yeilded so few cookies. In our house, having a full batch of homemade cookies in the house is asking for the entire thing to end up on your waistline within 24 hours. I had a quarter of a bag of mini chocolate chips that I was looking to make something small with. Anyway, these cookies were delicious. I left out the almond extract and replaced with more vanilla. I folded in some mini choc chips at the end. The result was perfect. Toasty cripsy on the outside and chewy chocolaty on the inside. This made five cookies and it took closer to 25-30 minutes to get golden brown. The tip with the foil is necessary so that you can remove the cookies since they are a little gooy right when they come out of the oven. Easy clean up though.

pretty good. they took longer to cook - more like 25-30 minutes. also, best to beaten within a few hours. i made the a day ahead of when needed and they were a little soggy.
