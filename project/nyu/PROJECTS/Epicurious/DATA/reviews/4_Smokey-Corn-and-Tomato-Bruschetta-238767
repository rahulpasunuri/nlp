Wonderful! Yes, the word "smokey" is spelled incorrectly, but that does little to detract from its flavor. The smoky flavor of the grilled bread, combined with the tomatoes, corn and onions was a perfect complement to any summer dish. I am looking forward to trying the leftover topping on other things!

Excellent! Big hit with my guests though I used two ears of grilled corn. Let guests top their grilled bread so it doesn't get soggy.

This was awesome. I served with grilled scallops and made extra dressing and drizzled over the whole thing.

Not terrible. Not great. Not worth the effort. Not sure how this got 100% and 4 forks. Just very little interesting taste. Corn and tomatoes sitting on bread. We all agreed that the bread was the best thing.

To Cook from BC about Smoked Paprika: Penzey's Spices (online--google it?) carries a wonderful smoky paprika. The recipe is fabulous--love the pairing of the corn and tomato, with the smokiness of the paprika added in!

I made this as a kind of salsa/relish without the toasts, and it was spectacular. I can't find smoked paprika to save my life, so I used some chipotle chile powder instead. The smoked flavour of all the vegetables was awesome. I like that the garlic is raw though. I think it would change the flavour if it was roasted too. Lime juice in it is perfect.

No matter how you spell it this was delicious. I added an extra cob of corn because we love corn. Definately a keeper.

I wish we all could be as smart and enlightened to point out every mistake ever made. You must be hard to please, cook from DC. And you must be pretty unhappy the world doesn't live up to your standards.

Smoky is spelled with no E; it's not Smokey the Bear. It's smoky, not smokey.

This was delicious! I made the bruschetta for an appetizer and everyone raved - too bad they didn't know how easy it is to make. I used leftovers as a "salsa" on grilled tuna steaks.
