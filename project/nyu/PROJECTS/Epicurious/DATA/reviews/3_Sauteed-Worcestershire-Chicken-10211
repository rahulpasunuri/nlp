I doubled this recipe and used skinless chicken. We didn't miss the extra fat! Because I pounded the breasts pretty thin, the chicken was very tender and flavorful. You cannot skip that step! I used very good balsamic vinegar flavored with tangerine which sounds weird but was delicious. I skipped adding the fresh lemon juice because of that. All four of my kids, aged 7-17 loved it and the whole dinner including vegetable, salad and tri-colored pasta came together in exactly 30 minutes - crucial for crazy weeknights. We'll do this one again!

This is a good weeknight meal. Quick and easy. I added a bit of butter at the end because everything's better with butter!

A nice, easy chicken dish on a weeknight. It didn't have the "Pop" I was looking for, and the carmelized onions I added had more flavor, but I'm glad I tried it. I don't think I'll made it again very soon, though. Not enough flavor.

Tasty and quick chicken recipe! I followed the directions exactly and was happy with the results. My toddler enjoyed it too...so that's a big deal! I'm trying the carmelized onions next time I make it.

I was somewhat disappointed with this dish. It is certainly edible, but not as tasty as one would think from the ingredients listed. It is, however, easy to make, so would be suitable for a quick weeknight meal.

This recipe was delicious. I used skinless chicken, and didn't miss it, although the skin would probably be to die for...

This was an excellent recipe! I added carmelized onions, which was superb. Will definately make this again.

I quadrupled the recipe when I made it, and my guests thought it was heavenly. The reduction sauce was delicious, and really made the dish. My husband requested that I make it again. Definitely a keeper!

I liked this recipe and would easily make it again but my family hated it. Luckily, it tastes great on sandwiches!

This is a KEEPER. Children loved it, no leftovers at all. I followed the recipe exactly. With 3 kids and 3 different activity schedules I made this ahead of time and put the chicken in a baking dish, then made the sauce which I poured over the chicken. I covered it with foil and reheated individual portions at 350 for 20 minutes. I made NearEast Rice Pilaf and fresh green beans. The rice reheats nicely in the microwave. This is GREAT to have on those busy nights when everyone is eating at different times!

This receipe was very easy and was just OK. I served it with rice. I did as others suggested and doubled the garlic and pared down the worcestershire. It still did not have much flavor. Still looking for a kid friendly boneless chicken receipe.

The ingredients intrigued me but was disappointed with the outcome. The worcestershire was all that you could taste. I cooked the sauce longer to reduce and thicken it. I'm not sure I would make it again.

This was a very tasty dish. Simple and easy and smelled great while cooking. Instead of 1/4 tsp lemon juice I just gave a big squeeze from a half a lemon. Next time I might reduce the Worcestorshire sauce to 1-1/2 tbsp. My hubby kept saying "mmmm, this is good" throughout the meal...I'm sure I'll be making it again.

This recipe was not only simple and quick to prepare, but surprisingly tasty. The reduction sauce was delicious and really packed a flavorful puch to what could have been just ho-hum sauteed chicken. I recommend doubling the garlic and reducing the worcestershire sauce to 1 tbls.

The merits of this recipe are its use of everyday pantry items and its ease of preparation. Unfortunately, these are also its downfall. The dish is quite unremarkable.
