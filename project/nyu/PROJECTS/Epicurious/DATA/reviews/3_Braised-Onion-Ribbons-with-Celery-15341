I tried this recipe and it was actually really delicious. I'm not the world's biggest onion fan, or celery for that matter, but I'll try just about anything, so I figured, "why not?" I'm sooooo glad I tried it. It is now a permanent side dish in my house. Yeah, it takes some forethought, but it's not as if you have to do much once its in the pan.... WELL WORTH THE TIME!

Hey, don't be so tough in judging a recipe if you haven't tried it yet! The onions are cooked this long to caramelize. They develop a rich depth of flavour in subtle sweetness this way. I will try this recipe tonight. I think it looks like a delicious side dish.

as if!!! I dont think I have an extra hour and fifteen minutes for a sauteed onion. I have made and been pleased with a lot of the recipes I've found on this web site but this one appears to be a collosal waste of time.
