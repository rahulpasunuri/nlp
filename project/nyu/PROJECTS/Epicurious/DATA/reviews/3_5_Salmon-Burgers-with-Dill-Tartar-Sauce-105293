Excellent salmon burger recipe. I like it as is but have also added a small amount of smoked salmon (wet smoke, not dry) to give it an added dimension of taste. Suggest adding a small amount (2T or so) of panko to help the burger set up. No access to a BBQ so I fry it on a cast iron pan, and it is still a lovely treat year-round.

I made these burgers almost exactly as written. I added about a teaspoon of horseradish to the burger mix and to the sauce. And I had some leftover arugula in the house, so used that instead of buying bibb lettuce. I chilled the burgers for about two hours before we grilled them. They were AMAZING! The texture is what was really great. The flavor was great, the lemon zest in the sauce really came through, but it really had the satisfaction of eating a burger with out the guilt. We will make these once a week for sure. I would love to do a wasabi mayo and maybe cucumber or avocado slices.

Very good. To expedite things, added the lemon juice, zest and a little extra tartar sauce to the first part of the recipe and skipped making the sauce. Also used one egg white to ensure it held together. Put on bun with lemon juice and it was healthful and delicious.

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe as written but added thinly sliced cucumber to the list of condiments. Used spinach instead of lettuce. Very moist burgers. Possibly the best I've ever had.

I thought it was very easy to make and very fast. I chose to use a yogurt dill sauce which was delicious plus added panko bread crumbs. No problem on the grill, no sticking. Just make sure not to over cook.

It's just me and my husband for the 4th this year so I'm making these easy delicious burgers. To answer the cook from NY, I would use at least 1/3 cup panko crumbs (just eyeballing it in my mind), if not more; you want the burgers to feel thick and adhesive without becoming gummy. Previously I used part of the bottom of a sesame bun (see earlier review) and that worked well too. Panko crumbs are lighter so more might be called for volume-wise when measuring. I'd also like to suggest using Alaskan Coho salmon which has such a lovely deep "salmon" hue!

How much panko needs to be added to these burgers to keep them from falling apart? Am making for the Fourth and don't want to chance it if possible.... Thanks!

I wasted a perfectly good salmon filet for these tasteless burgers. I wouldn't have guessed they were made of salmon if I hadn't prepared them myself. They weren't nasty, but they sure needed something--maybe onion and pickle, maybe cumin? I regret not just grilling the filet and sprinkling it with olive oil, lemon, and dill.

This recipe is actually one of my staples. I actually use whole plain yogurt instead of the tartar sauce. I put it in the food processor with seedless cucumber, zested lemon and the dill. Quite delicious!!

Very simple, very good! I also used Japanese breadcrumbs to hold the burgers together. I chilled for about an hour and 1/2 and had no problems with them falling apart. We loved the addition of the lemon to the tartar sauce. I'll be making this one again.

This was a great way to make salmon, and So quick and easy! My husband loved it, he said it was possibly the best meal we have made. I read the reviews and decided to add some breadcrumbs, I used japanese Panko breadcrumbs. I have made this twice already and the first time I refrigerated it for over an hour, the second time for only about 15 minutes, turned out the same both times. Great!

I bought some beautiful fresh Alaskan salmon for this recipe. Because I was worried the patties might not hold and also at the insistence of my fishmonger (the Alaskan salmon was top of the line and was of quite low fat content), I added a little bread to the mixture - just half of the bottom half of one sesame bun. The patties were firm -- I had refrigerated them for several hours! -- The second time, I remembered to add the lemon zest to purchased - yes, purchased! - tartar sauce - absolutely indispensable touch! I can't stress the importance of adding some bread to the mix to ensure burgers that hold together!

Outstanding - Add 1 Tablespoon Garlic Mustard to Dill Sauce and omitted lemon.

We prefer to just grill the salmon fillets on their own and then use the dill-lemon tartar sauce on the bun. That way you don't have to worry about it falling apart and the salmon is still nice and flaky.

My husband and I loved this easy recipe. I did chill the patties for a couple of hours and I grilled them on a grill pan. They were soft and I think B.B.Q would be a little hard.

EASY and QUICK with great flavor. I make my own tartar sauce (mayo, sweet pickle, shallot). I did not have a problem with the patties being to soft after refrigeration. Great for a quick, healthy dinner.

One of the few new things my husband requests again and again. The secret is the dill-lemon tartar sauce -- the lemon zest really wakes up the flavors. Even consider it a casual company summer meal.

Let me say right off that I tripled the recipe so I might have screwed up some of the proportions. I think the burgers ended up a little too moist even after refridgerating so I gave them a quick sear in a nonstick pan to firm them up for the grill and it worked great. It was an extra step (albeit an easy one) so the next time I think I'd blend the mixture without the tartar sauce at first and then add it until I hit the right consistency. The flavor was really nice. I used alder wood-chips over a charcoal fire which added a rustic element.

This is a great easy recipe that my husband said he could eat once a week! The burgers are very moist and hold together better for the grill if you chill them for about an hour before grilling. The fresh dill is the key ingredient! I served with stir fried vegies...easy weekday dinner.

This is one of my family's favorite! However, I did alter the recipe to include chopped or minced garlic, dijon mustard and lemon juice in the patty recipe. I toast an egg bun and serve with bibb lettuce, vine ripened tomatoes, and vidalia onions. I serve with Apple Poppy Slaw. Fresh and Fabulous.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe because it tasted good, was quick and easy. I used onion kaiser rolls instead of sesame--we thought it added more flavor. I love to cook and try new recipes, and with limited time due to work, tasty, easy recipes like this one are perfect!

These were not bad, they just were not great. I might try some of the other salmon burgers on the site.
