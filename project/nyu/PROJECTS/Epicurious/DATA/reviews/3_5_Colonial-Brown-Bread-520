This loaf is VERY dense -- mine came out about 1 inch high. Not sure if this is normal? It is very tasty, molasses-y and dense/rich, but the recipe is healthy. The recipe couldn't be easier.

I veganized this recipe. Added 2 Tablespoons of vinegar to 2 Cups almond milk, waited ten minutes for it to curdle, and voila: vegan buttermilk. The result is delicious, a keeper. This bread came out as a low, dense, moist loaf, maybe only 3-4 inches tall. Tastes almost like good old Boston brown bread, without all the tricky steaming. However, be aware that the spices give it a bit of a gingerbread flavor that is perhaps more suited to breakfast or dessert. If using for a really savory dish, I might cut back on the spices just a bit. Had my first slice with a bit of vegan butter, heaven. Tomorrow I plan to make some killer peanut butter sandwiches!

We used yogurt and milk mix instead of buttermilk and substituted wheat flour for all-purpose because we were using up things in the cupboard and the result was delicious. Skipped the walnuts this time but I can imagine the recipe is good with them too. Definitely going in our keepers recipe box.

Pretty good - and good for you. It has a beautiful chocolate brown color. Made one loaf plus a little more batter for muffins.

My husband and I loved this bread. I have made three loaves in the past week with one in the freezer. Great for breakfast with a little honey on the top!

This loaf is tasty and easy to make. I'm amazed to see a recipe that doesn't use any butter or oil! Great for a healthy, low-fat breakfast.

Oh MY, this is good! I followed the recipe to the letter and I'm glad I did. The only place I strayed at all was in plumping the currants in hot water (mine were a little dried out), which may have contributed to giving the bread a bit more moisture (good, I think, because this version is baked rather than steamed like the original brown bread). We're serving it with maple roasted pork and sweet potatoes. It's hearty, moist, and spicy and just sweet enough.

Nice, moist bread. The walnuts are a nice touch. I have dark baking pans and the loaves were finished baking in 35 minutes.

I first tried this recipe in an attempt to recreate a favourite bakery's brown bread. Since then, I have perhaps baked 25 loaves of it-- given some to homesick German graduate students, and others to friends. Yesterday I baked 3 loaves. One note: I have found that the recipe makes 1 loaf, not 2 (otherwise they are VERY small).

A most unusual bread. It has a flavor all it's own. It tastes a little like a quick bread, a gingerbead, and a steamed brown bread all in one. It has a moist texture and the walnuts are a nice addition. A nice treat on a cold New England day.

Fantastic! I make alot of simple meals and this bread was easy to make, stayed fresh and went with a wide variety of dishes. I love a good home made bread and this one is definately a keeper!

This bread is great for sandwiches, alone with butter, and very good with jams & jellies!
