Made this for Easter and it was a HUGE hit. I too just used ground cumin (about 1.5tsp) and frozen peas to make it fast. Didn't use as much olive oil either, probably about half. Everyone loved it. So quick and so easy and so delicious! Love making it as a nice easy lunch too.

Made this for Easter, What an amazing Salad. Loved the combination of the peppery radishes and sweetness of the peas.

Served this with Easter dinner. Excellent! Pretty and light starter to a big meal. I used frozen peas, a package of edamame (sp?), and some sprouted peas. At the end I decided to add some peanuts (get it? PEAnuts?) They were just right...adding some salt and crunch.

I really like this salad and make it often. I don't use dill, since it doesn't seem to go and I am just not a huge dill fan. My familiy says this is the best dressing I make.

The salad itself is nice, but the dressing is not good at all. The honey/cumin combo came off medicinal. I'd make it again and just use a simple vinaigrette .

This was a really good dish. I would, however, be careful what i serve it with as it can be overwhelmed by other flavours on the plate. The dressing was excellent!

the dressing alone would be excellent on any greens. I used Mache instead of peashoots. Huge hit even with the guys.

The components to the salad are superb but the dressing just did not work for us. The dill and the cumin seemed in conflict. Would have been nicer with just some high quality olive oil and malden sea salt. Not going to make it again.

Delicious! Made twice already this week. The only change to the recipe was to use 1.5 tsp ground cumin and cut back on the amount of olive oil. Didn't have pea sprouts, but will hunt for them at the farmer's market and try it again next week! Yummmmmy!

Excellent! One of my standby recipes I make often! I don't use cumin seed, just add ground cumin. love it for summer bbq's and buffets!

Rating: 3
Overall a good idea, but I found it just too downright sour to be enjoyable. I might just use a different dressing that I know I like with the same base and see how that is. Very springy and a good imagery complement to Easter dinner.

Loved this salad. Just screams Spring Time! I cheated and used the fresh peas, soybeans and sprouts from the salad bar at Whole Foods. Only had to blanch the fresh snap peas. Got rave reviews from my dinner guests. Will definitely make it again.

A perennial spring favorite. The dressing makes thise dish! Like most salads it doesn't save well when dressed so bring your appetite or cut the recipe in half.

so great, have it bookmarked on the computer. skipped the cumin and pea sprouts. added sugar snap peas and more dill. everyone goes gaga for it, have made it several times.

Gorgeous, fresh, tasty, and pretty healthy. If it is spring, get out to your farmer's market ASAP and make this dish! Used half peas from the shell and half frozen petite peas, and both were great (boiled the fresh peas for 3 minutes, didn't cook the frozen ones). I didn't roast the cumin seeds, but used 1.5 tsp of ground cumin and it was a good balance.

This salad got great reviews (and clean plates) from sophisticated foodie guests.The cumin seeds added depth and contrast to the sweet peas that really set the dish off. I'll definitely use it again.

I made this last weekend for a potluck. Some people liked the dish, but I though the cumin seemed to overwhelm the rest of the flavors.

Rating: 2
Agree with the previous reviewer- thought the cumin taste was a little overbearing with the light, fresh flavors of the salad otherwise. I will definitely make this again but omit the cumin.

Rating: 2
I really like the flavor of cumin, however I don't feel it matched at all with the other components of this dish. I could tell I'd have liked it much more were it not for that cumin taste. I think it brought down the brightness of the other flavors. I'll probably try again, omitting the cumin.

tangy, pungent, and sweet - a great combination of flavors, and so easy to make. I used frozen peas and ground cumin, and the result was pure deliciousness! I agree with other reviewers that that the vinaigrette is very versatile and would pair well with seafood or other salads. Don't skimp on the dill, and being a little heavy-handed with the feta won't hurt either :-)

I loved this salad! I unfortunately didn't have fresh peas, as pea season is over, so I used edamame and it was very good stil. I can't wait to make this with fresh English peas.

Great, easy and presents well. I will add some chopped bacon or pancetta next time for just a tad more flavor.

Excellent and easy. I used frozen peas and just thawed them. No need to cook. Fresh peas would be great, but in a pinch, frozen works fine.

Am looking for ways to enjoy Spring Peas from the Farmers Market...this looks easy, and by reviews, yummmy. But...I have yet to find the tendrils...you know...the things we used to throw away, and now are in demand.

My Whole Foods market had fresh, shelled peas, a rarety, so I had to buy them. Not a fan of dill, so substituted mint. Also cooked the peas slightly less than the recipe called for. Served over fresh arugula as I could not find pea tendrils. Really liked this salad, very refreshing on an unusually hot April day.

I loved this dish. I could not find pea vines (sad) but, it was excellent without. I served it at room temperature with french goat feta and easter egg radishes. Also, the dressing was divine. I am going use that combination for another salad. This is going to become a staple.

This is a good recipe, but I think a little heavy on the dill. I refrigerated the peas and radishes (mixed together) for about 1/2 hour before serving. This way they were nice and cool. The feta is essential for this dish, and I diced mine finely and it held its shape. I couldn't find pea tendrils, but I imagine this would definitely have added something extra. I would make this again, but only if I found the tendrils and with about half the amount of dill.

This is excellent. I substituted fresh sugar snap peas for the shell peas and simply left them raw. For added protein to make a light, summer vegetarian meal, I put in a can of chickpeas which went very well with the other flavors.

Absolutely loved this recipe and my guests raved over it, all the elements came together better than I would have thought. The only sub I did was switch the dill for mint which gave a great cooling flavor.

Easy to throw together and delicious. Have made it 4-5 times this summer alone. A crowd pleaser and the colors are beautiful. I recommend throwing the peas into an ice bath immediately after removing from the boiling water--this helps preserve the vibrant green color and avoids any mushy-ness.

This is so good. Made the salad with frozen petite peas to rave reviews from the Mother's Day brunch crowd. One note: the peas lost their bright green color after several hours in the dressing, so if you make ahead, add the dressing at the last minute.

We've made this several times already. It's become a favorite in our house. Fresh peas are hard to find in Phoenix so I use frozen peas and serve everything over a bit of baby greens.

Rating: 4
This was so easy and delicious, and the colors made a presentation nice enough that I would serve this salad to company. I used edemame in place of the peas (had it in the freezer) and put it on a bed of boston lettuce and baby spinach to get more greens in.

I loved it. It is a beautiful salad. I am making for the second time. I was able to find the fresh peas and the tendrils at the Hollywood farmers market. I definently recommend it!!!!!

This was very simple, and great. The dressing is not very strong; you might want to make a little more for this many peas, and I would cook the peas a little less next time:
