Loved this dish! I served it at a dinner party and everyone was raving. I only used 3.5 lbs of mussels instead of 4.5 which I thought was fine. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was a success. Would definitely make again!

I had to do something with a ziploc full of leftover mussels, so I made them into this soup. I used fewer mussels than called for, more cream (about 1/2c) and added 4 small diced potatoes. Really yummy! (It should be noted that I didn't actually *eat* any of the mussels, but the soup they were in was quite satisfying.)

I have made this three times during the past year. The only change I've made is that I add 50% more mussels. The seven people I had invited for dinner Sunday all came back for seconds. Three of the couples took home the recipe. This is really a great dish and I recommend it to everyone.

Yummy yummy yummy! I had been craving something like this, and found the recipe. It was pretty easy, and tasty. I would highly reccomend it!

I received more complements on this recipe than anything I have made in a long time. Two took a copy of the recipe home. I made it exactly the way the recipe called for.

Mussels a bit overcooked to my taste, but very good and flavoursome. A pinch of tarragon suits it very well.

I followed the suggestions of the other cooks and found that the broth was too strongly flavored with wine and leeks. I would probably try using just one leek and using closer to a 50-50 mixture of water and wine. I also added a whole pint of cream hoping to minimize the overpowering wine flavor. Overall, it was OK but isn't something I'm eager to make again.

This was just wonderful! I made it for guests yesterday and they (as well as their young children) just raved about it, saying it was restaurant quality. I omitted the peppers as no one in my family likes them and steamed the mussels in mostly wine with a small bit of water rather than 50% of each. Also added a bit of sherry at the end, as suggested by another reviewer. The flavors were incredible and the soup beautiful to look at. A definite keeper (though next time I will double the liquid -- I make steamed mussels a lot and freeze the liquid, so there's always mussel broth on hand).

One of my favourite soups. Have made it twice for dinner parties and everyone loved it!

This took some time to make, but the result was worth it. I don't even like mussels and I thought this dish was very good.

One of the best dishes I have found on this site. I have made it for groups of people who fawn all over it. Best served with ciabbatta bread for sopping up juices. I also add a touch of sherry to finish it off. Steam the mussels in wine & cilantro for added flavor.

I, too, thought that this recipe was weak. I thought that the leeks overwhelmed the flavor of this dish.I only used two leeks. I love mussels, but this recipe is just okay.

Loved it! And it was just as colorful and appealing as in the pic!

It needs some help! I added more clams as well as cream. It is better if you use green and yellor pepper. Serve with a very good pinot grigio.

One of the best soups, and not to much work with it

Great recipe. question: I had some mussels that did not open wide, but were not totally close. What should I do with those?

Delicious! I made this as a main course with a baguette to sop up the juice. I used sour cream instead of whipping cream. It was great and I'd make it again in an instant.

For the people below who didn't know how much liquid to use to steam the mussels: the instructions are found in the link in the ingredient list. You use 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup white wine. Haven't made the recipe yet but it sounds delicious.

Very tasty chowder, a nice change from the usual white-wine-and-garlic mussel treatment. 8 first-course servings must be teacup-sized as this made a meal with some leftover for 2 adults with average appetites. One red and one yellow pepper made a brighter presentation than all orange.

This was a very flavorful, yummy dish. Different from New England clam chowder -- this soup was not thick or creamy. We served it with crusty french bread and dry white wine and it was one of the best soups I've ever had. I got mussels precleaned in the store, so making it was quick and easy.

Wonderful recipe, particularly liked the fact that it is a low-fat chowder because very little cream. Would suggest garnishing with cilantro sprig.
