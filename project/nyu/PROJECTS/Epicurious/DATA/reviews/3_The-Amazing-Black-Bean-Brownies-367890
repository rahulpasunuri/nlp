These brownies were delicious. I didn't find that drizzling the agave/egg mixture over the top to create a marble effect added very much...I think it made it look less appetizing. The flavour was really good though. I would make this again for sure.

They turned out absolutely perfect. Fudgy, smooth, sweet. After refrigeration they cut into flawless squares. My husband had no idea he was eating beans, and if I didn't know better, neither would I. Highly recommended!

This recipe blew me away. My husband is involuntarily on a Gluten-free, Dairy-free diet because of stomach pain and has felt he's been deprived of what he truly enjoys - chocolate. He and our other dinner guests couldn't believe it was made with black beans and that it was so DARN good! I'm passing this onto everyone I know. Don't hesitate to try this one!

I had a REALLY GOOD experience with this recipe. I used teecino for my coffee substitute, so the finished product has a definite carob taste. Still, like they were described by the author, they are sticky, gooey, and not at all beany! I made these as a gift for my friend who cannot have wheat or gluten and I know she will positively FREAK over them! I don't know what happened for the other reviewer who threw them in the trash, but mine are yummy! Oh, I did cook them for a full 40 minutes. They were not done at 30. Also, I set my timer for 2 minutes so that the bean mixture would be in the food processor for the full 2 minutes. GF people - MAKE THIS!!!

This recipe turned out awful. There's no binding agent, so it turned out like butter, chocolate bean soup. It's flavour was awful too, so I didn't wait for it to set to see how it turned out. It went straight into the compost. Complete waste of money.
