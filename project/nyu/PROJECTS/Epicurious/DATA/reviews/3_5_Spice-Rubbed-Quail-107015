This was great. Seemed fancy even though it was easy. The sauce tastes bitter on its own (at least mine did) but great on the bird. My broiler cooked them in half the time stated in the recipe.

We always have a freezer full of German Shorthair-hunted quail, and this is the best recipe we've ever tried. I was put off at first at the allspice and molasses in the sauce, but the sauce was fantastic. I doubled it and I'm glad I did. I plan to have this on hand anytime I serve any type of fowl. Might be good on shrimp and salmon, too. Worth a try!

This was a very quick and tasty dish that I would be happy to serve if I ever have guests on short notice (if the store where I bought the quail happens to have them on stock, as they don't always...) I made the sauce with blackstrap molasses and when I tasted it it was a bit strong, but adding some salt balanced it out somewhat, and it didn't seem strong when served with the meat. It was my first time serving quail and the family loved it. I had eaten it before and it was tough and dry but with this recipe the meat was juicy and delicious even before adding the sauce. This recipe is on a par with any good poultry recipe I have tried in the past, and I would definitely make it again.

Made this for christmas dinner using cornish game hens and they were the juiciest, most flavorful chicken my husband has ever had. The sauce is deep, well balanced and absolutely incredible! Perfect for dinner parties since it you just have to take it out of the oven! Did it again just 5 days later for new years day dinner using quail and it is amazing!!

Fantastic! The molasses and allspice combine to give this dish the perfect warm autumn flavor. Not to mention it is incredibly simply to make. It would probably work just as well on cornish hen if you can't find quail.

We got live quail near Hunstville, AL for $3 a bird. Then we let our 3 German Shorthairs hunt them. Everyone had a blast and we prepped the quail for dinner. This recipe was delicious and my husband is excited to have a recipe he can easily cook.

Loved the taste of the quails, next time I will even put more spices on them. I made the sauce recipe double because I had a lot of sauce lovers for dinner and I was glad I did it, we almost finished it all. I served it with a plain jasmine rice, it was perfect!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was very easy to prepare and the sauce is to die for. It would make cardboard taste good!

We hunt and have quail as frequently as we can. This is a great recipe, but be sure to use a SCANT 1/2 tsp of the cayenne (I didn't and it was very very hot). But then let's talk about the sauce. I could DRINK that stuff, it's that good. Had it with carrots and jasmine rice. Delish!

have made a couple times. great recipe, simple as hell. suggest marinating for 1 day and definetly need fresh limes to go with the quail.

To those folks looking for less expensive sources of quail: Try ethnic grocery stores (such as Middle Eastern or Asian). I bought four quail (frozen/defrosted) for $5.00 at a Middle Eastern store here in San Diego. I have also seen them at a local Asian grocery for about the same price.

Well, being born a raised in NYC, a free meal on pigeons seems fair to me to offset living expenses. Maybe it will work with rats as well? Yes, I am joking--although I agree that you never can be completely sure 'round these parts. Anyway, I am looking for a less expensive way to purchase quail, pheasant etc. (via the internet) without having to resort to our cohabitants in NYC (squirrels are cute). Any suggestions? I found a wonderful and inexpensive site for mudbugs (crawfish) and alligator, but I am having trouble finding game birds.

Ok, prepare to turn green: I just bought packages of 8 FRESH quail for 4 dollars each. Sometimes it pays to live in a 3rd world country :))

I made this for dinner for my husband and I last night and it turned out to be an expensive evening at home. At Briston Farms the quail came in cyrovac packages of 6 for $35.94!!! They were not semi boneless but I found another recipe that instructed on how to do that. I don't think the rub added much flavor even though I used the full amount for 6 (rather than 8). The sauce makes it worth the effort or I would not have given this 3 forks. If you like quail and can find it cheaper there are other great sounding recipes on this website.

To "Cook From New York:" "Cook From Manhattan" probably means squab (right??)

To the cook from Manhattan. It's a joke about the Times Square pigeon, right? I think it is but you never know with people around here.

I tried this dish using NY pigeon (fresh from Times Square), but it just missed. Perhaps I messed up on the dry rub, or maybe my olive oil wasn't fresh. I don't know. I will try it again this weekend if I'm lucky enough to find another pigeon in the gutter. Shot guns are frowned upon by the local lawmen 'round these parts.

Hint: I buy quail in a Chinese food market. It comes dressed and frozen, 6 to a cryovac pac, for around and about $6. An incredible bargain. If you've got a Chinese market in your area, you could be in luck!!!

Thanks to all the reviewers for advice on this recipe and especially the one who rated it with dove. My husband has found a new "hobby" and I wasn't sure how to cook it. Can't wait to try it. :)

This meal is delicious. It is quick and can be prepared ahead, so it is lovely for company or a very romantic meal. I served it with angelhair pasta dressed with roasted garlic and a bit of basil and fresh tomatoes. Wonderful! I will definitely make this again.

Thanks for explaining the difference between a dry rub & marinade. A marinade is always in a liquid form!! "Cook from Western Australia"

My good huntin' dog and sharp shootin' husband returned from the North Dakota dove opener with a dozen birds. This great, simple recipe would work well with any small game bird, and was delicious using doves. May be a bit spicy for some, but we loved the heat!

Honey, this recipe needs 2 things: a good huntin' dog and a good shot!

The 'marinade' is a 'rub' rather than a liquid. It says to combine salt, pepper, cayenne and allspice then rub all over quail. Dry rubs are a great way to flavour/tenderise meats :-)

This is a truly delicious dish, very delicate and complex at the same time. I would encourage everyone to try it...if you can't afford quail, cornish hen will do wonderfully.
