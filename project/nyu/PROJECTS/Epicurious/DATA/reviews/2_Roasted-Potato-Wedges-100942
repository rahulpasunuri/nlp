We really like this recipe and often add other root veggies (rutagagas, parsnips, turnips et al) to the potatoes. Easy and delicious.

I tried this two ways - one with the salt - and the other with cajun spices to get that little kick. The wedges where just - nothing special. Really sorry I tried this one.
