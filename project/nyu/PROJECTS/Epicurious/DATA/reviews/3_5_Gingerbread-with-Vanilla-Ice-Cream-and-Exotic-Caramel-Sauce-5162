I think I'd try another gingerbread recipe, but the exotic caramel sauce was just simply divine. We just loved the raisins & pistachios in it. I personally thought the gingerbread was a little too sticky, and not cake like enough. But that sauce covered it up, anyway.

The amount of salt seemed excessive compared to other gingerbread recipes. I checked the recipe printed in Bon Appétit and it shows 1/2 teaspoon salt instead of 1 full teaspoon.

I have made this recipe several times and keep getting requests from family members to make it again. They refuse to order anything similar to it in a restaurant because they prefer this recipe!

I am not sure what happened! I served this to a group of people and NO ONE cared for it. It looked good. Very dense and the flavor was overpowering. The crystalized ginger was too much! This is the first awful recipe in three years.Sorry!

Totally delicious! I love gingerbread anyway and this takes the cake (no pun intended). The sauce was spectacular too. I have used the extra with vanilla ice cream and have resisted the temptation to eat it straight out of the container. :)

I do not like ginger at all and was quite afraid of the crystallized ginger. But this dessert is wonderful. The gingerbread itself is not too sweet and I would definitely make it again. The sauce is decadent.

This recipe is incredible. I'm usually not that big of a gingerbread fan but this is really an amazing dessert. A friend made it for our book group to rave reviews. I made it for dinner guests and everyone loved it. Try this recipe!
