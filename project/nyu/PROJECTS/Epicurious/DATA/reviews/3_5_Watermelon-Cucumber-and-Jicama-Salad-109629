No idea what jicama was - had to look it up. Not something you can easily find in London, so replaced with radish and worked very well. Make sure watermelon is properly ripe & sweet (also not always easy in London...), to balance the savouriness & spiciness of the other ingredients, otherwise this won't work.

Great and refreshing salad. Instead of cilantro I used parsley and lime mint and spearmint along with the basil. It was cool and refreshing on a hot, humid summer evening served along with sauteed fish. We have lots of cukes in our garden, this was a good dish!

Maybe I cut up too many herbs? Nice combination but the herbs were just way way too strong. I will try this again though, lightening up on the herbs, especially the basil. The lime juice is really wonderful.

I loved the refreshing flavors, colors, texture and presentation of this salad. Unfortuneatly, it wasn't a big hit with anyone else at our cookout - I had a lot left over. It was a lot of time consuming preparation and chopping for little return.

I made this recipe for a family reunion a couple weeks ago, it was fine, nothing too exciting. Of the several salads there this one was the least touched, and I received no comments about it. I think it lacked excitement, it was very ho-hum.

This recipe is great and easy. Followed it to the letter. The three fruits mix nicely together, as do the herbs- nothing is too pronounced in the salad. It tastes something like a traditional ceviche without the fish. I paired it with pork tenderloin flatbread sandwiches. mmm mmm mmm.

This was the perfect addition to a ligh summer meal! Light, Healthy and Delicious. No changes or additions needed. I let the salad stand for about 15 minutes (while the chicken was grilling) and the juices melded into an excellent dressing. This is a new summer standard.
