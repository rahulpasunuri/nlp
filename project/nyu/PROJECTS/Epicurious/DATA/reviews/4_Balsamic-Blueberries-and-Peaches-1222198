I make this quite often. I do not add peaches. I use the balsamic blueberries on my spinach salad with feta cheese. Delicious!!

I'm with the reviewers who loved this. I got scared by the reviews, so stopped with about half the black pepper, which seemed just right. The next night I had blueberries left over but no peaches, so I made the blueberry syrup and poured it over the rest of the fresh blueberries and served it over vanilla ice cream. My husband, who's generally "not a dessert guy" couldn't stop gushing about it.

Good, but nothing mind-blowing. The pepper makes it interesting. I've got a pretty adventurous pallette, but I found the pepper a bit overwhelming on the spice and did less that 1/2 teaspon of it. At first, it gave the sauce a nice bite, but then at times was too much. I would definitely recommend gradually adding the pepper and keep tasting.

What a great way to save some tired, but not yet down and out peaches. It certainly must be great on ice cream, but we only had yogurt and that was terrific. I put in extra pepper giving it a better zing. Looking forward to having it on ice cream.

Made this recipe without the peaches, but with the tons of blueberries I picked yesterday. AMAZING on ice cream. Now I"m wishing I had some duck to it on, too! Froze half of it, and hoping it freezes well...

This tasted good but not great, and was not very attractive when served over ice cream, since the berry juice and vinegar turned the peaches a bluish brown color.

Very nice balance of flavours.

Truly outstanding recipe. Great way to show off summer's bounty. Sophisticated and easy, this recipe is a show-stopper. I made it to take to work, some 30 people raved about it. Served with Elvis' Favorite Pound Cake, this site, it was utterly marvelous. Second time I made it, I had just the finer berries, blueberries, red and black berries and not the peaches, everything the same, though, vinegar and black pepper, was terrific and beautiful. So since I had all those people to help me do the judging, I asked everyone if they recognized the surprise ingredient, no one guessed the black pepper, everyone loved the fruit, it is simply lovely---you gotta try it.

Don't be afraid of the black pepper - it counters the sweetness of the fruit and sugar, yielding a perfect balance of savory and sweet. I served this like a shortcake: half a sweet biscuit, a bit of the fruit, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and more fruit on top. Absolutely delicious.

This is to die for. I made half a recipe for a weeknight dinner. I was nervous about the pepper but added a tiny amount of freshly ground pepper to the bowl. I tasted before and after adding the pepper. It was good before. It was killer after. If you're unsure about the pepper, just start with a little and trust your taste!

Outstanding on ice cream! I was a bit skeptical at first, but the recipe was amazing. Will definitely make again.

I didn't have access to peaches or nectarines, so I subbed mangoes. I was worried it would be too sweet, but it was really nice.

i agree, the balsamic and black pepper are quite subtle. i served it over icecream, and you couldn't really taste the vinegar. if you eat the fruit solo, you do get a sense of the unusual ingrediants. but it is quite good and easy to make.

I thought this sounded unusual and thought I would try it, it was much subtler than I had anticipated and everyone scraped their plates clean. Very good.

a friend brought this over. No pepper was added. We served it over French Vanilla ice cream and I wanted to lick my bowl!! Delicious!

My guests all but wept for joy when I served this, and begged for the recipe. (I served it with a dollop of creme fraiche-- heaven!) Contrary to previous reviewer, we all think the black pepper makes the dish. But then again we're the sort of people who like basil in orange sorbet, rosemary with honeydew melons, and cayenne in chocolate.

Lovely color and texture, but the black pepper really ruined it for me. I may be able to salvage it by rinsing it and making the syrup again.

This is a perfect recipe for entertaining because it's delicious, it's interesting,it's light and it can be made in advance. I think I would add more black pepper next time.

Low-fat (really NON-fat), but delicious and satisfying--and different. I used nectarines, blueberries, and blackberries and served it over vanilla frozen yogurt and peach sorbet. Guests, even after a substantial meal, all wanted it and exclaimed over how good it was. A perfect, easy dessert that you can make in advance, as others have noted.

This was excellent!

Fabulous. I've made it 3 times this summer. Also great with blueberries and strawberries (leaving out the peaches.) Don't be afraid to make this ahead of time. It's even fine the next day.

I thought this was an easy, quick dessert. So easy and it tasted great. I served this with some vanilla frozen yogurt and it really complimented the fruit.

I used xylitol insead of sugar and the result is the same - wonderful. The colors are spectacular. I'm wondering if French vailla ice cream would not be a nice addition.

Simple, unusual and very tasty. I used Splenda instead of sugar and it tasted just fine, and even better the next day.

I made this as dessert for a company dinner, so mixed everything together before guests came--it probably sat at room temperature for 3 hours with no apparent damage. Tasty and pretty in glass bowls.

Fast, easy, and little cooking. What else could you ask for!!! The dressing is light and full of flavor. I used berries instead of peaches. It tasted especially scruptious over the raspberries and strawberries!!

I'm giving this recipe four forks for its delicious simplicity! I was looking for something lowfat that doesn't require heating the house from using the oven in summer and found this on the last page of July Gourmet. Blueberries and peaches are a great combination (blackberries too!) and the balsamic sugar syrup is a perfect dessert compliment for a BBQ pork roast main course.
