I did not like this that much. the sauce as good and i like the greens and the dressing but i did not like the marinade on the steak and i did not like the flank steak

The dressing was too sweet for my taste so I added more lime juice. I also used a Dole Asian salad mix which wasn't very good. That's not the fault of the recipe though. What I did like was the flavor the marinade gave the beef and I plan on using that with my regular Asain beef sald recipe.

This salad was super tasty and looked beautiful when plated. I added a couple tablespoons of rice wine vinegar to the marinade because I like the combination with fish sauce. For the salad dressing I used about 1/2 the sugar and only 4 tablespoons of fish sauce and used a jalapeno instead of dried chile flakes. I didn't taste exactly like the Vietnamese version I love so much, but It was wonderful, and did I mention beautiful?

The meat flavor was wonderful, but the salad wasn't that great. It was kind of hard to eat with the meat on top.(cutting into both)

The recipe calls for too much fish sauce in the salad dressing. I recommend starting with 1 tablespoon of fish sauce and adding more as taste desires. If not, the whole thing gets overpowered by the fish sauce and you loose all the other wonderful flavors.

I made a few changes based on what I didn't have on-hand: no scallions for the dressing, round steak instead of flank, Fuji apples instead of Granny Smith, salted cashews instead of peanuts and red-leaf lettuce instead of Asian salad mix or other bitter greens. I would definitely make this again if I had bitter greens, such as arugula, but the soft red-leaf lettuce did nothing for the recipe. However the meat was awesome and the dressing delicious. I even ate leftovers the next day and they held up wonderfully.

In the CA bay area we have many Asian dining venues. This recipe is the first authentic recipe I've made all the way down to the mint. The only cha nge I made was to cut down on the oil to save cals. Oh, one other, I did not have the correct noodles so I used spag. Any noodle would work with this as it is a perfect recipes.

Great combination of textures and so delicious. I was short 3 Tb of fish sauce for the dressing so added 1Tb of canola oil to slightly thicken and 1 Tb soy sauce. Don't care for raw shallots so I sauteed them first. I marinated the meat for the full 8 hours and it was tender, juicy and delicious. No leftovers on this one. It got rave reviews.

This dish has a wonderful combination of textures and is so delicious. I was 3 Tb short of fish sauce for the dressing so I substituted 1 Tb of soy sauce and 1 Tb of canola oil. The oil just slightly thickened it and helped it adhere to the noodles and the greens without changing the taste. I don't care for raw shallots in salad so I sauteed them first before adding to the sauce. I marinated the meat for the full 8 hours and it was tender, juicy and delicious. No leftovers on this one. It got rave reviews and I will definitely be making it again.

This was not only delicious, but very satisfying as a meal. I took several of the previous suggestions (including adding chili sauce later to taste, reducing the amount of mint and adding thai basil and cilantro to make up the difference, and only marinated the steak for 4 hours). In addition, I tend to shy away from adding any type of fruit in an entree, but the apples certainly added a freshness and crunchiness that shouldn't be ignored. I tried it both ways (with and without apples) and surprisingly found the salad lacking without!

Loved it! I live in Milan, Italy where Chinese food is still considered exotic and one day had a hankering for steak in some kind of soy marinade and found this. The dish is easy to make, perfect for summer, light and fresh. I pretty much followed the recipe (though I did add a carrot and use only one apple) and am glad I did so I can make it again. Unfortunately my boyfriend is not such a big fan of fish sauce so I don't know how it'd go over with him; I may just have to give it a try, though.

I have made this four times now, and it is liked by all. Here in the O.C. we have one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the world, so I'm very familiar with the Vietnamese dishes upon which this recipe is based. In those dishes, instead of fresh sliced shallots, fried shallot slices (which can be bought in plastic jars at many asian stores) would be used, and my experience is that they taste much better. Also, less mint would be used; instead one would find a mix of mint, cilantro and a variety of other aromatic salad leaves; if you don't have access to these, I recommend using less mint and more salad greens. Instead of dried red pepper flakes, a chili paste would be added by each diner to taste to the dressing before pouring over his or her own salad; This kind of paste can be found at most Asian markets. Finally, if you can find Vietnamese fish sauce it is much lighter and more delicate than Thai fish sauce. Lastly, I can say from experience that it is not a good idea to marinate the meat any longer than the suggested 8 hours, or it becomes far too salty and fishy for most tastes.

Very good, esp. the marinade. I found the mint a little overpowering so next time I will add less.

this was really fantastic - the flavors were super fresh - i used skirt steak - meat was intensly flavorfull. make this salad

I love Thai food, this was easy and so good. I wonder how that would be with chicken? The marinade gave the meat a whole new flavor. I was a little soupy but well worth it, just use an extra napkin and a spoon.

The first reviewer commented disapprovingly on the thinness of the sauce. However, that is an authentic characteristic of the Vietnamese food on which this dish is based. This dish would most likely be served in a rimmed plate or bowl in a Vietnamese restaurant, enabling the diner to swirl the ingredients together and through the sauce. In addition to being more authentic, the sauce is healthier because it is not oil based. I wouldn't change it. (P.S. I may have inadverently submitted this twice. Sorry!)

What the first reviewer disapprovingly comments on is in fact an authentic quality of Vietnamese food, on which this recipe is based. It is true that the sauce is "thin", unlike western-style salad dressings, but that does not, in my view, make it inferior. It simply makes it lighter and healther. On the other hand, the typical Vietnamese dish of this sort would generally have smaller pieces of meat and other things that lend themselves to being swirled in the sauce that has accumulated near the bottom.

This was a good summer meal in one dish. Good contrast of interesting flavors with peanuts, mint,apples, lime and hot peppers. I didn't have as much sauce as the other reviewer complained about. I used mache lettuce that gave an interesting texture and I may have used more lettuce to accommodate the big eaters in my family. My steak was larger too, and rare.

I would make this again on a hot summer night but wouldn't rate it as one of my favorites. The beef marinade is a good one. Next time I'd use flat rice sticks rather than vermicelli and figure out some way to make the sauce a little thicker. Also any baby greens will do - no need to use the "Asian" mix.

After making this, I'm not exactly sure what appealed to me about it in the first place. This is an easy fusion dish that doesn't really draw on any specific authentic recipe and ends up being a bit bland and uninteresting because of it. My biggest complaint is that the dressing is too thin and just runs to the bottom of the plate. Serving this was murder--we were splashing it all over ourselves. I would definitely doctor this with some sort of oil to make more of a traditional vinaigrette to dress this. A few more items like carrots, cucumbers or crunchier greens would help as well. It *is* very refreshing with the mint and makes for a very light meal. I just wanted more flavor and better mouth feel in the end.

This is a simple and FANTASTIC summer dish. I actually used a leftover grilled flank steak and followed the rest of the recipe. The salad is delish. The dressing is yummy. The combination of it all with the noodles, grilled steak, and peanuts is fantastic. A surefire keeper good enough for guests!

I debated between 2 and 3 forks for this dish. My husband would give it 3 and I was in between. I decided to give it 3 because I may have cooked the beef a wee bit too long. It's a nice all in one meal and it wasn't to hard to prepare while carrying a 13 month old around the kitchen.
