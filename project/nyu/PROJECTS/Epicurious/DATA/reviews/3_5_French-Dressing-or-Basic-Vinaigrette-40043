I needed french dressing for a cooked dish. I made it with avocado oil. I tasted it and liked it. I like the fact that this recipe has so many variations. I hope to make each at some point.

The most authentic and delicious vinaigrette I have had outside of Paris. I made it exactly as the recipe directed as well as the variation with Dijon mustard. I have also substituted walnut oil for an interesting variation. C'est magnifique!
