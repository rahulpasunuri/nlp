This is one of my very favorite recipes, I've made it many times. It's perfect as written. I just tried it for the first time with real holy basil (as opposed to thai basil) that I grew specifically to make this, and I have to say I prefer the regular thai basil. It's hard to go wrong with this dish though. I often add half a bell pepper, and I like to let the chicken sit in the wok without stirring it for 30 seconds or so when I first add it. It gives it a little sear that makes it taste more like it was cooked in a restaurant.

Very easy to follow recipe and with a few modifications, it can be even tastier and more authentic. Some modifications I tried and suggest (I noticed that some other reviews made similar suggestions as well): Mince the chicken and marinade with 1 tbls soy sauce, 2 tspn rice vinegar, 2 tspn fish sauce for a few hours Add 1 tbls oyster sauce and 1 thinly sliced sweet red pepper when adding the soy sauce

Rating: 4
I doubled the sauce and used half to marinate overnight, discarding that marinade portion. Hubs likes it spicy, so I added a little extra chili and a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken it before serving. All in all, pretty yummers!

I would give this 2.5 forks if I could - better than good, but not delicious. Recipe, as is, is probably a pretty good start for a dish that could be delicious. We kept the dish pretty close to the recipe, but added 6 red Thai chilies (instead of just the 2), dumped half of the chilies in with the garlic and kept half for the end (when recipe says to put in), and prepared a 1/2 and 1/2 blend with Asian basil and mint. We both thought it was okay - had a nice background heat, which we thought we'd bump up in the future... more chilies. Otherwise, I agree with the previous reviewers who recommended 1. chicken thighs - breasts ended up too dry, marinating, too, would have helped; 2. doulbling the sauce - probably a good idea; and 3. adding slightly more basil/mint or cutting the cooking time or putting half in with cooking and keeping half for garnish.

Lemur King was right, and then it gets four forks. Marinated dark meat and peppers with the garlic is the way to go. Accompanied this with green beans from the garden.

It's a decent and tasty recipe as is, but I think it can be improved upon. A couple issues I have are related to the chicken. I'd probably prefer thigh meat (skinned) over the chicken breast. In addition, with the pieces being cut at 2" sizes, the chicken will need a bit of marinating prior to cooking. If you cut the chicken pieces to 1" marinate them with the 1/4 c. of chicken broth, and an additional 1 Tb of Nam Pla and 2 Tb of rice wine vinegar. When it's time to cook the chicken, just scoop them out initially and if you want add the marinating liquid towards the end. Make sure you bring it to a boil if you do add it, and then add the basil to finish. I'm probably adding additional nam pla because I like to have that flavor be a bit more present. Also - I would not add the chilis at the end - that's somewhat strange to me. I would add the chilis with the garlic to flavor the oil prior to cooking the chicken. And I'd probably add a few more chilis (like 6+ total).

This was very easy and really tasty. I substituted chicken thighs for the breasts and a tablespoon of sambal olek for the peppers as I didn't have those on hand. I also drained some of the fat off after cooking the thighs.

This gets four forks for taste and ease of preparation. I doubled the sauce using chicken broth and a little bit less garlic, as I don't like heavy garlic flavor. Also used plain basil out of my garden. I would probably try a few veggies next time.

I made a vegetarian version of this recipe that was great. Instead of chicken I used half a red onion, one large zucchini, and some chopped fresh broccoli. Otherwise everything was the same. Yum!

SO GOOD! With the adjustments I made anyway: added half a red onion, doubled the garlic, 2tsp dried chili powder brought back from Vietnam instead of fresh (because I wanted to try it), an entire bunch of regular basil, used sweet soy sauce and more of it, white pepper instead of black, and no broth or water. Super yummy spicy and definitely needed the extra garlic. It was great with sticky rice! Note: make sure your wok is HOT so the chicken browns without sweating.

This is so quick and delicious everytime. Although the basil requirements are impossible to find in Edmonton in winter, "regular" basil still works great. Coconut rice is a must!

I have been a member of this website for years, and one of the best parts that brings me back time and time again are the reviews - some extremely helpful, others...not so much. I have finally found something review-worthy! I gave this 4 forks simply because the combo of simplicity and deliciousness can not be denied. I consider my culinary skills intermediate, and this was so ridiculously easy. And quick! I started and finished in the time it took my guy to call his mom to say hi (aw). I wholeheartedly agree with reviewers who suggest doubling or tripling the sauce. The only amendment I made was omitting the chilies - I used sriracha. I added button shrooms, red bell pepper, broccoli, and onion. I meant to add ginger, but forgot. And by the time I was done, it didn't need it anyway. Definitely serve this dish with jasmine rice, and maybe some steamed bok choy? The point is, TRY THIS. Easy, quick, yummy. 'Nuf said.

I have basil in my garden-- lots of different kinds, and this is a great way to use it without the oil of pesto. I have another similar recipe without the sugar, and I wish I hadn't used any sugar in this. I like using thigh meat because it stays moist, but it also gives off a lot of fat. I let the chicken thighs brown in their own fat and then pour it off.

My first attempt at cooking Thai-food and it tasted as good as my local Thai restaurant's! The second time I made it, I used a red bell pepper (like my local Thai restaurant uses in this dish) and doubled the chicken broth, fish sauce, sugar, soy and black pepper since I felt like there wasn't enough the first time I made it. I used serrano chiles and found that 2 was just slightly hot for me so I would go for 1.5. Also, I didn't feel like going all the way back to the Asian market for Asian basil and used regular Italian basil (which my Korean friend told me she uses in her cooking) and found it to be a great substitute. The Asian basil did have a stronger taste, but if you had never had the dish that way first, I don't think you'd miss it. This is AMAZING!!!!!!

Rating: 4
This is fantastic!!!! I recommend this to everyone. You have to be very careful when using fish sauce with any recipe as strength can vary widely depending on brand. I start with 1/3 of what is called for. I add ginger, broccoli, and onions...but that is a personal choice. As for cornstarch I add to thicken. To answer question from Boston....start with 1 part cornstarch to 2 parts water. Stir to mix. Then slowly add some to the mix...stir...depending on heat might take 20-60 seconds to thicken. Also I use jalapenos from my garden.

I thought this was absolutely horrendous! I love making thai dishes (and I recommend the thai shrimp curry on this site) but I had to throw this entire recipe out. I think the fish sauce was too overwhelming, and the sauce too watery. Perhaps I did something wrong, becuse the other reviewers really seemed to like it, but I would reccomend trying another dish on here instead of this one.

Made this last night after impulsively buying a large pack of Thai basil, a Chinese eggplant, and a zucchini in Chinatown. Since I hadn't planned to make this, I didn't have the chili pepper, but found Sriracha hot chili sauce (about 2 teaspoons) to be a good substitution. Stir fried the eggplant and zucchini and then chicken in separate batches. (The eggplant was really good - would definitely suggest using this if you're looking to add veggies). My boyfriend declared this "A Keeeper" and couldn't stop eating it (despite having earlier lurked around the kitchen making snarky comments about the stinky fish sauce.) The flavors of the sauce balance so well; I'm interested in doubling the sauce component, but have some questions about it - 1) if I double the chili sauce, won't it be too spicy? If I don't, will it still be as "balanced"? 2)Interested in trying to thicken with cornstarch, but I've never done that before - how much cornstarch to use, and what's the technique?

Rating: 4
Delicious! I used red snapper fillets instead of chicken, and the dish was terrific. I also didn't have any fresh chilies so I with substituted about 1 1/2 teaspoons of thai curry paste for a little heat. I will definately make this again...with shrimp, chicken, or beef.

Instead of chicken, used firm tofu (drained on paper towels with a weight on top) coated with corn flour and sauteed. My husband who DETESTS tofu had 4 servings!

Quick and delicious dish: I was surprised by how easy it was and how accurate the flavors were (I did add both onions and ginger to mine). The lime juice is essential to counter the pungency of the fish sauce, if you're cooking for people who don't like it.

Super good. We added hericot vert (french green beans ) and mushrooms. One of the best stir frys we've made.

I'd give this five forks if I could. This dish was absolutely fantastic - and so easy to make! I halved it for the two of us (me and the 10 year old I care for) but it wasn't enough, simply because we both would have loved a second helping. Most of the ingredients can be prepared ahead of time, making the dinner/homework hour(s) much less hectic. I followed the recommendations of a couple of other people and chopped ginger and used slices of onion. Both were great additions, especially the ginger. I would have used red pepper, too, but had forgotten to get one at the store. Next time. I also threw in some broccoli that we were going to eat separately, substituted sesame oil for the vegetable oil (for flavor), and used 1t of the Thai Red Chili Paste we had onhand instead of the chilies. I also agree that, if you can find the holy basil, use it. It has an anise/licorice flavor that really (and lightly) adds to it. I read somewhere that you can use regular basil if you can't find the holy basil but to increase the amount of black pepper you use. I wonder if it would make more sense to add anise instead. I served this with the Thai Jasmine Rice, which was equally scrumptuous. We can't wait to have it again.

I've made this dish a few times with some changes. I use ground beef because I had this dish at a Thai restaurant and loved it more than when made with chicken. I also add slices of 1 green pepper and half an onion. I LOVE basil so I put more than the recommended amount. Don't skip the basil. It makes this dish delicious!! And don't forget to serve with lime wedges. The lime juice makes it less boring. This dish goes great with jasmine rice and Thai tom yom soup. I make this almost every week! Leftovers are yummy too.

I read lots of reviews first, then tripled the sauce, used regular basil but still used amount asked for, used chili garlic sauce(bottle with the rooster pic on it) so I didn't have to buy the chili,cut down slightly on the fish sauce and increased the (low sodium)soy, and added straw mushrooms from a can,broccoli florets,red and yellow mushrooms, and pea pods.Served over jasmine rice. OUTSTANDING!! All guests raved about it,and my leftovers did not last long. Also, my 16 month old simply could not get enough of the broccoli. Happy I followed all the suggestions.

I'm always looking for a new stir-fry and this is the new favorite. It's healthy, quick and full of flavor. I've never been able to find holy basil, so I use the regular from my garden. I've made this with shrimp, too, and its excellent. I always triple the sauce.

I am so grateful to have found this recipe, since this is my favorite Thai restaurant dish. This is exactly like what I get at the restaurant, except...it usually comes with sliced onions and bell peppers, and I add a few handfuls of fresh green beans. That ups the nutrient factor and the flavors marry well with each other. I also grow Holy Basil in my herb garden to have on hand since it can be hard to find.

As everyone says, very good, very simple and very quick. Also, very low-fat/calorie. Doubling the sauce amounts is advisable, as is adding cornstarch for thickening. Also, I used a teaspoon and a half of the Thai red chile paste, as recommended by other reviewers.

I've made this a number of times, it is a mid-week staple. By mixing this recipe with other traditional recipes, our favorite result: Adding 2 thinly sliced shallots, when stir-frying the garlic. Reducing the fish sauce to 2 teaspoons and increasing the soy sauce to 2 teaspoons using a traditional Thai soy sauce: Kwong Hung Seng brand (a slightly sweet black soy sauce). Note, if your fish sauce leaves a fishy flavor, try a different brand. They are vastly different, and this Thai dish should be balanced.

This was pretty good-- I love the simplicity and it smelled great while cooking. That said, it certainly didn't blow my family away, and it wasn't as flavorful as the versions I've had in Thai restaurants. It needs more something. Be very very careful using Asian basil; as stated in the recipe, once cooked it loses flavor fast which is what happened to me. Next time, if I use Asian basil I think I'm just going to toss it in raw. Also, note for anyone: Thai chilis freeze really well, it's one of those ingredients I always keep on hand in the freezer, like ginger.

We would give this recipe 3 1/2 forks, and it would probably be a 4-forker had we had all of the ingrediants. Our local grocery store was out of Thai chilies and basil, and even *regular* basil, so we had to improvise. We used a 1/2 teaspoon of Huy Fong Garlic Chili Paste (the bottle had a green top and a rooster on the front, so this may be the paste/sauce one of the previous reviewers was referring to?) and took as much sweet basil as the one little plant in our garden could give (@ a cup--we also chopped it up so it would be distributed better). We were more than a little concerned after adding the fish sauce (we're fish sauce novices), but the overall smell greatly improved after adding the basil and lime :) All in all, this was a good recipe, and we will definitely make it again!

I thought this dish was FABULOUS! I had a bunch of regular basil I needed to use up so I put it in this and it worked very well. I also opted not use the chilies (no time to get to the store...) so I used a full teaspoon of that Thai red pepper garlic sauce (the one in the clear plastic jar with the green lid and a rooster on the label?) It was a great substitute and I think the garlic added a lot to the dish.

Definitely a restaurant-quality recipe. I served it as a main course at a Thai-themed dinner party for 8 (doubled the recipe) and every bite was eaten.
