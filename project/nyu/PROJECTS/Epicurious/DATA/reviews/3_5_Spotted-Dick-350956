A true Englishman would turn over in his grave. This is NOT or anything like a true Spotted Dick

I made this recipe for a "Ladies Tea" at church which is a big deal...table decor, themes, etc. It was amazing. The length of them the spotted dick took to cook was a lot shorter than theh recipe said. Also, don't fill the pan up to high with batter, it will "poof" over. I will definitely make this again and again. Oh, the custard gets really thick when cold and it gets cold really quickly.

This is a fabulous recipe for a British classic. I completely understand chefdanc's disdain at the custard powder option but there you have the choice - do you go for authentic British or a restaurant-quality sauce? If it's the latter you want then a good creme Anglais will be great with this, but never as authentically British as the vivid yellow stand-your-spoon-up-in-it custard you can get from Birds custard powder. Why not serve both and let your guests choose? (PS - just realised what my username looks like - the MSC is my employer - I promise I'm not shouting about a degree! Must change that...)

I am sure Chef Lou is embarassed, or should be by putting "Custard Powder" in the recipe.

I'm British and remember this pudding from my childhood. If you leave out the raisins, put two tablespoons (or more) of jam or marmalade in the bottom of the bowl, then add the batter and steam, you will have another delicious pudding to serve with custard.

I made this for our Christmas dessert and it was delicious! To make self-rising flour, just add 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt to each cup of all-purpose flour.
