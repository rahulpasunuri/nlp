This was good, but much better with a squeeze of lemon

This gets four forks because it is so simple and so delicious. I agree that the low end of the garlic amount called for is plenty-- mine with 4 was still very garlic-hot. This is just what I was hoping for! I did add a little bit of lemon (about 1/2 lemon) but it tasted good before I did that too.

This was delicious and my guests eagerly asked for the leftovers (ended up making quite a bit because I used dried beans instead of canned and the bag made way more than what would ordinarily be found in two cans). I followed the advice of others and used only 4 cloves of garlic. This is a keeper.

I liked it, but guests were lukewarm..afterall, ben dip is not a big crowd pleaser if there is anything else available.

If you don't like the power of fresh garlic, use the same number of garlic cloves and boil them first in water for a minute or two. This calms the flavor down a bit!

We love this recipe. It's much like hummus, but easier to make (no need for tahini). Very nice with grilled pita bread.

I wanted a quick and easy recipe to make. I had all of the ingredients on hand and it was a snap to make -- with little clean up. I would use less garlic next time (or smaller cloves) because it can really take over the flavor. Next time I will serve it with more interesting, flavored crackers. And if I were more adventurous, I would vary it with other ingredients.
