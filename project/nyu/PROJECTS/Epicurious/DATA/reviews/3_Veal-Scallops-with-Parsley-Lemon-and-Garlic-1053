I have made this about 100 times. It is so simple and easy. You can easily build a casual or sophisticated meal around it. The only difference I make is that I use half the garlic in the gremolata and the other half, I saute in the pan after the veal is removed but before the deglazing with vermouth. 2 kinds of garlic flavor and slightly less rawness. I love this with buttered, parmesan pasta.

A very lovely and easy dish. I sauteed some sliced shiitake mushrooms with the garlic and added them to the sauce at the last minute. I think it enhanced the presentation and gave the dish a bit more oomph.

Simple dish, easy to prepare. I agree the scallops cook very quickly ( 1 min.), especially using the paper thin veal I get at my local supermarket. I don't sprinkle any raw garlic ove the dish, I just cook all the mixture, though about half the amount.

This sauce is very similar to Gremoulata. We found that the veal only needs to cook for 45 seconds, not a whole minute. We served this with Orzo drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and freshly grated Parmigano Reggiano. We also had a Greek salad. The whole meal was very good.
