I just made these for my son's 3rd birthday. As another reviewer or two mentioned, they have a muffin-like consistency. We have a nut allergy in the house so I used store-bought (shhhh) chocolate frosting. I might make them again with chocolate chips and no frosting (eat as muffins). Overall, I am pleased with these and they definitely beat a mix.

Extremely easy to make! Really great flavor and moistness to the cake; the flavor was on par with the best banana breads I have had, but without being as dense. The peanut butter frosting was delicious and not too sweet, with a great consistency. They were a hit together, but I think they actually might pair even better with other flavors. Next time I will use the peanut butter frosting on a fluffy chocolate cake or the banana cake with a cream cheese frosting.

After reading reviews, I used 3/4 sour cream and 3/4 stick butter and extra banana. I didn't love the frosting. Cupcakes were very good...but more of a muffin texture, dense. I'd use a different frosting next time.

These were so easy to make, and my husband LOVED them! I brought a few to work the next day and they were an absolute HIT. These will be in my regular baking rotation, for sure!

Love the cake recipe! I'm now using it as a base for all kinds of banana cakes. I just made a blueberry-banana cake that turned out great and substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream with no detrimental effects. Great frosting as well. Not too sweet!

These are the best cupcakes I have ever tasted. Made them for my book group and received great reviews from everyone! I thought the frosting was great.

The cream cheese in the frosting makes it a bit too dense. I much preferred the peanutbutter caramel buttercream recipe (coupled with the chocolate banana cupcakes) found on this site, originally from the whimsical cupcake. Otherwise the cupcakes were good, and we enjoyed the addition of miniature chocolate chips.

I made these for my daughter's first birthday party as I found them perfect for my 1950's theme (Elvis loved fried PB and banana sandwiches!) Everybody loved them. I followed the recipie to a T, and I had no problems other than too much frosting. Will definitely make again!

Rating: 4
To die for! The cake is like a sweeter version of banana bread, and the frosting complements it wonderfully. I did not have 8 oz of plain cream cheese for the frosting and substituted half honey-nut cream cheese spread and half full-fat Greek yogurt. (BTW, greek yogurt is a terrific sub for sour cream too.) I had to exercise supreme restraint not to eat two immediately off the countertop.

I did not make the frosting...only the cupcake. Cakes did not fall at all. I added semisweet chips and just used store bought frosting...next time I'll make my own. Thought the cakes were yummy!

Rating: 3
I had no problem with the cupcakes falling - they stayed nice and high. I also found that I got 18 cupcakes out of this recipe, which was great as I made them for a fundraiser. And, yes, the frosting made far too much but I will use the remainder as the filling for a chocolate layer cake. I found the cake texture light and a little on the bland side but a perfect foil for the peanut butter frosting.

The cupcakes were a bit bland but the icing was heaven!!!! It did make too much icing though, wish I had read the reviews before and halved the icing. No big, these were a hit!

Rating: 4
So excited! contrary to other reviews my cupcakes came out perfect! No concaving at all. Maybe the way you beat in the wet and dry ingredients is more important than people realize? And halved the frosting as recomended by multiple reviewers and had the perfect ratio of frosting to cake. overall a success considering i havnt made cupcakes in years! the frosting is what makes this!

Fantastic. My 14 year old daughter made them, completely forgot the sour cream but still yummy. The frosting is to die for, sure to be a favorite with many other uses. Frosting frosts generously.

Rating: 2
Way to much frosting on this cake, I had to throw out more than half of it because the cupcakes were overflowing with it! The cake was very tasty, and the frosting had a nice flavor, but I think this cupcake would be even better with an acidic berry component. Good cake, too much frosting. I don't believe I will make it again.

Rating: 3
Made these with overripe bananas because I'm sick of banana bread. I was surprised at how good they are. Yes they fall in the middle, but the texture is light (and the frosting covers the fallen cupcake.) I tried them with both the peanuts on top and with no peanuts. Though I love peanuts, the crunchy texture didn't go well with the softness of the cakes.

Rating: 2
I used a standard muffin tin/liners. I divided the batter evenly between the 12 cups even though they looked a little full. They over flowed the tin. To me, that means they do not leave the house, as they are a bit of a failure. They tasted good but looked terrible. Next time I will use better judgement and make about 5 more cupcakes. Also, they took about 27 minutes in an accurate 350 oven.

Rating: 2
These taste really good, but they are definitely not puffy, so don't be expecting a traditional cupcake! They sunk way down after I took them out of the oven, so that the top was concave. Applying the frosting was really difficult because of this! I don't know why other people haven't had this problem, because I followed the recipe exactly. I don't think I will make them again, but I will certainly save the frosting recipe... amazing.

AMAZING!!! Would definitely make them again!

Sounded so good, but we found the frosting, while delicious, overwhelmed the flavor of the cupcakes. I froze it and frosted the rest of the cupcakes with the vanilla cream cheese frosting here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Vanilla-Cream-Cheese-Frosting-104319 and they were perfect.

Rating: 4
Wow! These are terrific cupcakes, and what a delicious and tender crumb this recipe makes. I'm sure that the frosting with these would be terrific. Unfortunately, they disappeared before they could be frosted. I saw this recipe thumbing through an old magazine. Even in the digital world, few things are more pleasurable than thumbing through cookbooks, or Bon Appetit! With this recipe, no over-ripe banana will be ignobly tossed.

Rating: 3
I added chocolate chips, cinnamon, and nutmeg as suggested by others and am glad I did. The cupcakes were very moist and I loved the frosting, but the cake didn't taste much of banana and needed the additions to be more flavorful. Very nice, different sort of cupcake though. I doubled the cake recipe, but only made 1 of the frosting and it was still too much frosting.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious cupcakes! I added 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to the cupcakes. I think you could halve the frosting recipe and still have plenty. In fact, the cupcakes are so moist and flavorful that you could skip the frostin all together.

I threw a bag of milk chocolate chips in the batter, and people went nuts of these magnificent cupcakes. They were perfect! People are still talking about them. I'll definitely make them again!

This was the perfect 4th anniversary dessert/present! Flowers and fruit is the theme, which is tricky to meet for a wife. So I made these banana cupcakes, and topped them with chocolate medallions that I molded with a Springerle flower design. The frosting is so amazing!

I was skeptical about the banana/peanut butter combination, but it really works in this cupcake! I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers had so many problems - mine came out perfectly, definitely a light and fluffy cupcake, not greasy at all, and not at all dense like a muffin or banana bread. The rounded tops did fall flat while cooling, but they didn't collapse on themselves and the flat tops were covered by the frosting anyway. My only changes to the cake were to sift the dry ingredients, and to add some semisweet chocolate chips. They definitely need the chocolate! (But then I think everything does.) Added half again as much peanut butter to the frosting - couldn't taste it enough as written. I'll definitely be making these again!

I loved these cupcakes. Today was a snow day and I had 7 kids in my house and they were such a hit! The icing sure does make a lot. I also used Skippy chunky natural peanut butter w/ a touch of sea salt. For the batter I used whole wheat flour along w/ light cream cheese and light sour cream. I will surely make these again when I have ripe bananas!!!

good cupcakes, excellent frosting. I used Light cream cheese for the frosting and it still tasted great. I also substituted the sour cream with banana yogurt and threw in some peanut butter chipets.

I cannot believe the glory of these cupcakes. I had some ripe bananas but didn't feel like the usual banana bread or muffins. I love the combo of peanut butter and bananas and who doesn't love cupcakes? So I gave this a whirl, made it to spec, and got a few marriage proposals, and a bunch of demands for the recipe. I was told by more than one person that I could have easily sold these in a bakery. They were amazing, and I am SHOCKED and AWED that there aren't more people on here talking about how fantastic these were. These are officially in the recipe box and I will make these any time I need to woo someone!

I've never made the cupcakes that go along with this, I used the frosting for a devil's food cake that I served at a dinenr party recently, and people *loved* it. My kids fought over the last slice!

My boyfriend's favorite dessert flavors are chocolate, peanut butter & banana. So I have used a few other recipes for banana chocolate chip cupcakes and this is definitely the best. I doubled the recipe and used plain whole fat yogurt instead of sour cream. I also substituted half a cup of brown sugar instead of white because I like the caramel-y flavor of brown sugar and I think it makes cupcakes a bit more moist. These cupcakes were very moist and fluffy and not like banana bread at all, which I was afraid of. They did not keep the round top they had when I pulled them out of the oven and became flat topped. I didn't mind because I used a tasty peanut butter buttercream frosting that hid the flat tops. Delicious cupcakes- will be using this recipe often!

Personally, I think that the folks who had them turn out greasy or too heavy aren't using the right technique for making cupcakes. It doesn't specify in the recipe, but here's what works for me. I always follow these steps with cupcakes: make sure you sift your flour a ton, cream the crap out of the butter until it's super fluffy before adding the sugar, add the sugar gradually rather than all at once, beat it more after all the sugar is added (until it is really fluffy), and don't over-mix when combining the dry mix, wet mix, and banana mix at the end. Mix them until they are just incorporated. I followed the recipe as it is, and the cupcakes turned out RIDICULOUSLY good. A tiny bit more dense than a normal cupcake, but incredibly moist and flavourful. I added chocolate chips too. Everyone went wild for them. The trick to the icing, as another cook said, is whipping it lots to make it fluffy. Just typing this makes me want to eat another one... They were indeed flat, but I like 'em that way. Easy to get out of the pan, and great for piling icing on top of. :)

Rating: 4
There was easily enough batter to make 16 full-sized cupcakes, and I had to add 2 minutes to baking time to make sure they were done all the way. The frosting was a bit heavy, so i whipped it on a higher speed for 1-2 minutes to make it light and fluffy. But the end result was DELICIOUS

This was my first attempt at cupcakes and they were way too rich! The banana cupcake was ok but sank into a moist totally flat "banana bread" easy to frost but a bit too solid for a cupcake. The frosting was way too rich! Peanut butter and cream cheese!! Please!

I love these cupcakes so much that I created an epicurious account just so I could review them. I have made them several times now, and have also made just the frosting to go with chocolate cupcakes. With chocolate cupcakes I replace the chopped peanuts on top with Reese's Pieces. I am now using light cream cheese in the frosting and you can't tell the difference, although I'm sure it's a futile effort considering how much butter is in the recipe:) I agree that the cupcakes come out rather flat and unattractive, but once they are frosted they look great.

I've made these a couple of times. Mini-ones with caramel butter cream and regular-size with the pb frosting. I've doubled and quadrupled the recipe, and they came out great! Just don't overfill the cups - they don't look so good, but with a dollop of frosting, who cares???

I didn't bother to make the frosting after the cupcakes completely deflated. We had to eat these with a spoon straight from the muffin pan. The texture is more muffin and less cupcake. I'm disappointed Bon Appetit.

This is a great recipe. I use whole wheat flour & add about a cup of walnuts & sometimes use my own home made dark chocolate cocoa or german chocolate frosting but it's always a hit. Thank You

Beware - these are a very light MUFFIN with flat tops, not pretty! They do not have the texture or taste of a traditional cupcake... Experimented with a very smal batch of frosting using my own taste preferences for proportion. Ok, but could do with a bit of vanilla. Overall, not a cupcake so if that's what you're looking for, this is not it and it's three bowls to make a unattractive muffin! Taste is pretty good, made as the recipe suggested with no reduction of butter and it's not greasy. But... will not make again.

Rating: 3
We thought this recipe was good, but my husband enjoyed it more than I did. The cupcakes were a little greasy. I put them in the refrigerator overnight, and we thought they tasted better served chilled since it took away some of the greasy, oily texture. It seems like maybe there was too much butter in the recipe. Both the cupcakes and frosting tasted good; I just wasn't wild about the combo. I thought the cupcakes themselves were very good without frosting, and that the pb frosting would taste better on chocolate cupcakes. Also, the cupcakes came out huge; next time I think I would make a few more rather than just 12.

Rating: 3
Very rich and delicious. Used the suggestions of other reviewers and used 3/4 stick butter and 3/4cup plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream. We made 14 cupcakes and probably should have made it in to one or two more. Definitely only need half the frosting to frost these cupcakes. yum!!

I tried to make 6 regular size cupcakes and one pan of mini-cupcakes. The mini-cupcakes were a complete disaster, the batter oozed out all over while baking and only 3 out of 9 came out with any kind of fluffy top. The regular size cupcakes faired better but a few had fairly large holes in them. I used a stand mixer, perhaps I overmixed slightly? It's probably my worst baking disaster ever. Not sure if using less butter/more sour cream as others suggested would have been able to salvage these. I was disappointed in the frosting, too. The cream cheese overwhelmed the peanut butter flavour in my opinion. I will not waste my time making these again.

Everyone loved these with the frosting going down especially well, I caramelized the peanuts for the decoration which made them extra special!

I made these in a mini-muffin pan for my kids- ended up with over 3 dozen mini-cupcakes! The kids love them. I did decrease the butter and increase the sour cream, and they taste great. They did fall a bit, so next time will try baking a little longer. The mini-muffins still took 15 minutes.

The cupcakes turned out perfect and moist. The frosting was too rich for some friends. I also wish I read the reviews and will probably cut the butter next time

I wish I'd read all the reviews before baking - I probably would've reduced the butter and upped the sour cream as suggested by others. At 20 minutes, my cupcakes looked gorgeous, perfectly rounded and raised on top, were a light golden, and they passed the toothpick test. But within 20 seconds after taking them out of the oven, they started to fall. I put them back in for almost 5 minutes more but it was too late to save them from caving in the middle. Next time, I won't count on just the toothpick test, but will let them stay in an extra couple minutes for good measure. They're so moist, I think it would take a lot to overbake them. (The color on my finished cakes went to a deep golden and they're still not overbaked.) They taste delicious, so will certainly get eaten, but they're so rich, I don't think I'll add the frosting to this batch. Since it'll be different conditions next time (changed ratios of butter and sour cream) I'll just watch them very closely and hope for better results. The taste of this first batch suggests it's worth another try!

My 12 year old daughter and I loved these!! I took others' advice and cut butter in cupcakes down to 3/4 stick and increased the sour cream to 3/4 cup. I ended up with 15 cupcakes and it seemed to be perfect b/c they didn't spill over the top. They did fall when cooling, but we just filled them in with frosting. I didn't have regular cream cheese (and didn't want to wait to go to the store), so I substituted 1/3 less fat. We made 1/2 the frosting recipe and it was plenty. VERY delicious and easy recipe. Will definitely make again soon.

Agree with the reviews to cut down on the butter in the batter, mine too fell quickly and were a bit greasy - but still were light, fluffy and moist. Agree, think 16 smaller cupcakes would yield a prettier result w/out overflowing. Also made the frosting as per recipe, WAY too much, could cut in 1/2. I had enough left over to frost the top of an 8" square cake afterward, but very yummy!

Amazing!!! I was our of cream cheese, so I made my own! All you have to do is pour a good amount of plain whole milk yogurt into a cheesecloth set over a strainer and let it drain for several hours (I did for about 5 hours), until it is the consistency of cream cheese. It really works, and it made the frosting SO light and yummy! Try it.

I made the cake recipe as written, but made it into 2 9-inch layer cakes that I then cut into 4 layers. I doubled the frosting (and added more peanut butter than the recipe called for) and filled each layer with that as well as frosted the entire cake with it. Delicious!

I read the reviews and said it was a little buttery so I reduced the cupcakes butter amount down to 3/4 of a stick and changed the sour cream amount to 3/4 cup and used 3 bananas and it was wonderful. The frosting is wonderful too. Totally would make again.

These were delicious and surprisingly light and airy despite the amount of butter and sour cream in them; they were also HUGE! I made the cupcake as per the magazine recipe but I did make changes to the frosting, reducing the butter by 1/4 cup and the powdered sugar by 1/2 cup. The resulting frosting was still sweet but retained the tang of the cream cheese; it yielded far too much for the cupcakes. Next time I make these, and it looks as though I will be doing this soon to use up the extra frosting, I will make 16 instead of the recommended 12.

These were tasty, but definitely do have a prominent butter taste and are a little greasy. Next time I would try cutting down on the butter; it does seem a bit too much for the recipe. The frosting is good, but if you're looking for more of a peanut butter flavor I'd add more peanut butter and maybe use a bit less cream cheese.

amazingly good. 1st batch i did exactly as specified fr. bon apetit. 2nd batch i added half a banana more and one more spoon ful of sour cream. they came out very moist and delicious, as always i dip a pastry brush in melted butter, brush the cupcake pan, put cupcake filters in and brush those as well, i also added walnuts, this would make for a great banana bread or cupcakes. some recipes can be really dry, but this one was really moist and you taste banana in every bite. everyone at my job loved these cupcakes. the frosting was enough for two batches too. frosting was perfect not too sweet. this recipe is definitely a keeper

Disappointing. Too greasy, cakes quickly fell upon removal from the oven. I should have gone with my instincts - a 1/2 cup of butter is too much with 1 1/4 cups of flour. I didn't get to the frosting - I was gonna just use cream cheese without peanut butter anyway.

These were awesome. I added choc chips and walnuts. Don't skip the frosting - it is great.
