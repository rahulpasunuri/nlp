Delicious. I made it without the bonito flakes (I don't care for them) and added a little sesame oil. Also great with packaged broccoli slaw.

This was simple and delicious, satisfying my desire to incorporate a little more seaweed into my diet. I didn't have any Bonita flakes so I substituted some fish sauce. Didn't want to mess with the salt or liquid content of the recipe though, so instead of the recommended 1 Tbs soy sauce, I used 3/4 Tbs soy, plus 1/2 Tbs fish sauce. Also garnished with sesame seeds. Delish!

We have a farm share, and there are a few weeks a year where I am buried in cucumbers. I remembered a roommate who was half-Japanese making something similar to this. I stumbled across this recipe when trying to recreate what she did. It's not *quite* as good - hers ws her mom's recipe - but it's pretty darn good and it uses a lot of cucumbers. I made it as written. I don't think I would bother if I couldn't get bonito flakes; that is a large part of the flavor appeal for me.

So quick and easy to make, didn't use the bonito flakes. Tasty, crisp and crunchy. I will definately make this again.

This is good. I made it a couple nights ago and just made it again. Used a "rice seasoning" that was mostly bonito and it makes a big difference. I think it could be better so I will keep looking for more recipes but it's good enough that I saved it so I can use it again.

This was very good. Bonito flakes are dried, very thinly slices of a fish that's called "Bonito". It adds a lovely flavor to many things - not fishy. To the person who gave it one fork and a bad review, using the already salted dashi (basically a dried soup, ready to eat)was your mistake. Adding the recipe's salt ingredient just boosted your salt content, resulting in your disappointment.

It could be just my personal opionion, but I didn't think this was good. I didn't have bonito flakes, so I used 1/4 tsp. instant 'Dashi'{dried bonito stock} to give it the same flavor the bonito flakes would have. I didn't garnish with the nori, but everything else I did as written using the suggested 2 cucumbers. The resulting salad was super salty. I cant eat it as is. I'm going to doctor it up by adding more cucumber to tame some of that oversaltiness. This is not something I would make again.

I made as written, except for the nori. It was exactly what i was hoping for - like sunomono in a restaurant. The bonito adds a really nice flavour (not fishy, almost smokey). My toddler loves it.

It just wasn't that great. The next time I need a salad like this, I'm going to pull up an old Thai Cucumber and Red Onion salad that I've made before.

Bonito is something like dry tuna flakes. It adds a nice flavour to any Japanese dish!

3.5 forks! The bonito is what makes it so good. Without it, this recipe would be 2.5 forks.

This is review is not exactly for the recipe above. I had a seedless cucumber and needed a recipe with no carbs in it. I did not have the bonito flakes so I could not use them and I also had no Nori. Used the rice vinegar and omitted the sugar. Sliced the cucumber very thin and it was delicious. I could have used a recipe my mom made when I was a kid of putting the slices in vinegar. Problem was she also used sugar and I need more flavor than just vinegar. I will make this again with the bonita and nori. Very easy and quick recipe to prepare.
