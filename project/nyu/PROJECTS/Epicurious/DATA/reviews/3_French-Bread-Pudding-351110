Well, the way I made it I would make it again. I took ideas from this, then went in my own direction. Had some leftover sweet whole grain cranberry orange bakery bread, +there's only 2 of us. I cubed the remainder of bread + end of a crusty baguette - maybe 3C bread total. Soaked it in 2 C. 2% milk for maybe an hour. At same time, soaked (whatever dried fruit, I only had raisins + cranberries) dried fruit in sherry (1/4 C. total). Mixed in 3 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, and baked in a 9x9 @ 350 for 45 minutes. Rest for 5 min, then spoon out & drizzle with real maple syrup.

Too sweet, too dry, with distinct egg vs. bread stratifications. In your search for a traditional recipe to use up stale bread (the all-too-soon fate of French bread in a small household), ignore this inedible disaster!

Enjoyed this pudding very much. I melted a little vanilla ice cream and poured it over the warm bread pudding. Try it, and enjoy.

Nice and easy recipe. I made variation and it came out well, though I cut the sugar in half and it was still too sweet. I used ~10 slices whole wheat sandwich bread, half the sugar, only 3/4 cup dried cherries, 1% milk, an extra 3/4 cup milk for the cherries to pre-soak in, and ~3 tablespoons of melted butter. Without the extra milk, I think the pudding would have come out too dry/solid for my liking. I would make this again and try just 1/3 or 1/2 cup sugar instead.

This recipe is straight forward, no fuss. The pudding was simple, tasty, great texture. Real comfort food. We served it as brunch on New Year's Day. I used about a quarter of the sugar and substituted canned pears for the cherries. A keeper.

I suggest letting the dried fruit steep in the milk and bread cube mixture. The fruit plumps and is less likely to settle to the bottom of the baking pan during baking.

We offered a choice of whipped cream or hard sauce. It was nearly solid when served though I was expecting more of a custard in parts. We didn't mind the solidity but it made it more like a cake than pudding. Having the cherries made it wonderful. Would definetly make again. Everyone loved it.
