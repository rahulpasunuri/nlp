Other then having to substitute a 10" spring form pan for the 11" tart pan the recipe was followed precisely. The tart turned out perfectly and looked great however it is EXTREMELY sweet. For the sweet-tooth crowd 4 stars; for all others I would avoid having this as the star of a dessert selection.

I have found the crust part of this recipe exceedingly useful over the years. While I do agree somewhat the filling rests a tad on the sweeter side and not for everyone, I have enjoyed the combination of flavors when I have made it. For those turned off by the filling, I recommend using the crust as a base for your best pastry cream recipe or using it for the strawberry mascarpone tart with port glaze (Gourmet; April 2009) and serving it that way, or perhaps topping with raspberries when in season. A peanut butter mousse or hazelnut filling would also work well.

I found that its pretty complicated to make and personally I didn't think it was that good.

Made this last night for a dinner party and everyone applauded it. I planned to make it exactly to recipe but I ran out of time and substituted an oreo cookie crust instead. It worked well. For the topping, I used 3 squares of melted bittersweet chocolate and spread it evenly over the whole tart. It's a chocolate bar in a tart form. I can see using it again for birthdays.

This recipe comes out just like the picture. While it is a little time consuming, it is well worth it. I have made twice and will make again. One tip, line the bottom of the tart pan with parchment paper to make removal easlier.

I've made this tart many times and would agree that it does take a lot of time. Everytime I make it, though, it gets rave reviews! It is rich and a small sliver is perfect!

This was a very time consuming dessert and after it was finally completed, it looked absolutely beautiful and tasted absolutely horrible. This is the worst dessert I have ever made. Save your energy for something worth your time and rewards.

I thought that this was a lot of work. Although it served beautifully, it was too sweet, and very rich. I made it as part of many desserts on Thanksgiving, and it did not "stand up to the crowd" of other desserts.

Excellent tart! I use a mix of macadamia nuts and cashews, and also replace the fresh ginger with candied ginger. Very rich, and serves many. Make a day ahead - great for dinner parties. Also freezes very well. Can recommend with confidence!

This is terrible to review because I didn't actually get to taste this recipe, but I made it for a dessert auction and it looked absolutely gorgeous. I'm rating the recipe on the ease to prepare (always great to keep recipes that you know you can make entirely in advance and they will still look beautiful the next day when you go to serve it), and aesthetics. It served wonderfully, and I can't wait to try how it tastes! I did leave out the coconut.

Tasty though the ginger was not appreciated by all tasters. A lot of flavors going on but the dessert really grew on me and I would make it again and bring it to share with others.

Absolutely beautiful. Made it for Christmas dinner and it impressed all who viewed it. But there was a mixed reaction on tasting it. Some people reveled in the layers of flavor and the surprising combinations; others thought that there was too much going on and that it overwhelmed without finesse, like some "Death by ____" dessert. Either way, it nudged us all a bit closer to diabetes, and that's what the holidays are all about. I would make it again, though, and I would especially use the crust again and improvise a different filling.

Everyone liked this at Thanksgiving. Though they wondered what the different flavor was - that was the ginger. I think it would have been ok if we had grated the ginger rather than chopping it.

I made this tart for my girlfriends' annual Christmas party. It was a HIT! I made the recipe exactly as it was written and I think all of the flavors blended very well. My oven is convection...and my shell didn't collapse. It was really pretty and extremely tasty and popular!

I made it exactly as recipe said but my thermometer must have been off because I ended up cooking the sugar way too long and it got hard. I would give it 4 stars for presentation. I would chop the cashews next time to smooth the top. It was a little sweet but can you be surprised.

Rating: 4
Absolutely stupendous. While I also found that the chocolate cookie crust fell during its first baking, it still held the filling quite nicely. As a warning- make sure to chop the ginger into fine, separate pieces. Every once in a while people would hit a ginger pocket, my dad called them "ginger spiders". All in all, this was a perfect ending to my Thanksgiving meal and I will most definetaly be making it again.

This was a huge hit with the family! I baked it according to the instructions and it turned out perfectly. However, I used the wrong size tart pan and ended up making two tarts. They were fabulous!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I did not have problems with the tart loosing it's shape, however it didn't say sharp like a typically tart shell. It seemed like a chocolate cookie crust and was perfect for the tart. I used cashew pieces and had great luck. This is a keeper!

Did anyone have problems with baking the tart shell? Both times I have made this tart the pastry dough has lost its shape during the initial baking process. I used a measuring cup to push it back into place into the sides of the tart pan when still hot. I tried using a bit of parchment paper and pie weights to help it keep its form on one batch but that allowed too much moisture and did not allow the shell to bake to the dry consistency called for by the recipe. Just wondering if anyone else encountered the same issue -- or has any idea how I can fix this problem. Thanks

I thought the recipe was fabulous. I actually got accused of buying it because it looked and tasted so good. I did chop the cashews and and not use whole ones. I am going to give it a try using the other nuts!

I used a mix of coarsely chopped nuts: cashews, Brazil nuts, Macadamia nuts, and pecans. Very rich. Great with coffee.

I made this for TG and my family raved about this recipe.It was the only dessert that was completely gone. I ommitted the ginger and personally didn't love the whole cashews, agree with macadamia nuts as the choice nut, but everyone else loved it hands down.

Sorry, I have never made a comment before I made a recipe. This recipe looks like it has the potential to be over the top, but a number of folks have commented that the ginger is too strong. As comments by all of you are what makes this site, I was wondering if crystalized ginger would be a good choice as it is a desert or is there a problem when it is cooked. I'd like to make it for the Holidays so I won't be able to experiment. Comments? Thanks

Very, very rich, but delicious! I made this for my SIL's birthday and it's a new family favorite. We loved the ginger flavor, but that was probably because we are more used to it here in Hawaii. I'm not much of a cashew fan, so a friend suggested using macadamia nuts next time for an even more tropical flavor. For me, the caramel took almost 20 minutes to cook to the proper temp.

I also made this for Thanksgiving and it was the favorite dessert! I used 1/3 the amount of fresh ginger and left everything else according to the recipe. I agree that it is even better the next day.

Made this for Thanksgiving, and to say the least, it was not a popular dessert. There were too many flavors. The ginger was overwhelming. I couldn't give the left overs away. I ended up throwing 2/3 of the tart in the garbage.

I made this dessert for Thanksgiving, and everyone agreed that it was the best. I too, however, felt that the ginger was a bit "much" - this despite the fact that I cut it by half the suggested amount during preparation. In the absence of a candy thermometer, I cooked it for the recommended 8 minutes, but perhaps this was not enough time. I also increased the coconut, to suit my family's taste. I will definitely make this again, but will absolutely omit the ginger.

I did not think that this dessert was overwhelmed by ginger or coconut. In fact, I could hardly taste the ginger. I did have to cook my filling longer than 8 minutes to reach 222 degrees, so maybe that gave the ginger a more subtle flavor. Other than that, I followed the directions exactly, and the dessert turned out delicious and beautiful! The other pies at Thanksgiving had hardly been touched by the time this tart was gone. This recipe sounded delicious and it lived up to my expectations. I love cashews, coconut, and chocolate, and when I was cooking the filling, it reminded me of German Chocolate Cake frosting. My husband said I can make this dessert again ANY TIME!

This was quite time consuming but great! "Heavenly" is how my mother decribed it and "professional" was another comment (regarding the presentation.) This was a bit sweet but yummy! I refrigerated the leftovers and ate more Thankgiving night. It was even better the second time.

This tart was far too busy. The ginger was overpowering. If I made this again, I would definitely cut back on the amount of ginger, but I'm not sure that alone would help. Just too much going on in a dessert!

This was far too sweet. I found the ginger to be overpowering and incompatable with the other ingredients as a whole. I am also a lover of coconut but there is way too much in this recipe. What happened too less is more???

Delicious!!! I was unsure of the combination of flavors, especially when feeding two teenage boys. Everyone raved, though, even my son who hates coconut and is not particularly fond of nuts!! I followed the recipe exactly, using bittersweet instead of the semi-sweet. My mother has already requested it again!

Tested out this tart last night to see if it's a keeper for Thanksgiving. My guests voted yes, mostly because the fresh ginger is fabulous, but my husband & I think it needs a little care as the sweetness was starting to overpower the flavors. When I make it for Thanksgiving, I'll use bittersweet chocolate instead of semi-sweet, and I'll loosely scoop the cup of sweetened coconut instead of using a packed cup (I never cook with sweetened coconut, so perhaps you're always supposed to scoop it loosely?). It was quite good last night, but the leftover slice was better today, so I'll make this tart the day before. I served it with a lovely organic vanilla ice cream, but as an additional way to reduce the high sugar, next time I may serve it with unsweetened whipped cream. I was stumped about the crust, as it calls for just 1-1/2 tbsp ice water and the recipe says to blend until it comes together -- well, it never came together for me, so I added a full 3 tbsp, and it still was completely crumbly. But even so I was able to press it into the pan and it seemed to have turned out fine.

The tart was delicious and looked beautiful. Fresh ginger is a must in this recipe and really brings a fresh taste to the rich tart.

Fantastic! This was a little bit of a chore to make - lots of waiting time, but worth it! I wouldn't change a thing. You can also make it in a mini-tart pan. This recipe made 12 mini tartlets.

This is fabulous. Cashews, chocolate, and coconut in a perfect torte recipe. Previously, I had made a French Chocolate Torte as everyone's favorite, but this may take the prize. You can make the syrup without the candy thermometer if you are an experienced cook; also, I did not have ginger on hand. Just delicous, and it's great with some nice, strong coffe to offset the sweetness.

I didn't find it too fussy to make, you can just do one stage while the other is cooling or whatever - does require a little organising and thinking out beforehand, of course, but it's not difficult. Hard to get sweetened coconut where I am so used candied ginger and thought it tasted great.

To the cook asking whether to leave the crust in the tart pan or not, the answer is yes, leave it in.

I am thinking about making this. Should I remove the crust from the tart pan after it is baked, before I put it in the oven with the filling, and put it on the rimmed baking sheet? Or do I leave it in the tart pan the whole time, only removing it at the very end after the filling is baked?

The tart was delicious, yet so rich that few of my guests were able to finish even a small slice. It was part of a Halloween potluck, so maybe people were overloaded on sweets. I am a confirmed chocoholic and loved it. If you are looking for a rich dessert to follow a light meal, this would work. I did not think it was difficult to make.

I thought this was very good and plan to make it again for Thanksgiving. I did not have fresh ginger on hand so used some jarred chopped ginger that was probably stale. So I wasn't crazy about the ginger flavor but I bet it would have been better with real fresh stuff. Anyway, next time I'm going to try it without. I loved everything else about it. It is very rich so you can serve at least 12 and probably 14 or 16. Good with some vanilla ice cream. Oh, and my husband thought the cashews should have been chopped up. I am not sure I agree, I think they look much prettier whole. He doesn't care about aesthetics I guess!

I found the recipe somewhat fussy, but worth it. The tart looked gorgeous and tasted great. Perfect for a special occasion. My sister absolutely loved it. I didn't have cashews or fresh ginger on hand, so I used toasted walnuts and a bit of ground ginger. Note: the filling took longer than eight minutes to cook and it was a bit stiff after cooling. I gently warmed it to loosen it up a bit before spooning into tart shell.

This was very disappointing. Sounded great but was a lot of work with so-so results.
