Made this yesterday for a Cinco de Mayo party. I liked the texture but the flavor was a little bitter. The coffee taste wasn't necessarily recognizable as such. On the other hand, the brownies were gobbled up at the party so I guess everyone else liked them.

This has long been a favorite recipe of mine because it's not that much more complicated than box brownies (you can easily mix by hand) and outrageously good! I've always used ground espresso beans instead of the instant and cut them small -- 1-2" square pieces. I think the caffeine buzz is part of the fun though I do warn people ahead of time. We used to plow through these during finals in college.

AMAZING! Based on personal preference and other reviews, made the following changes to the recipe: doubled it, added an extra egg (5 total), used a 13*9 pan, instead of the instant espresso I ground up whole espresso beans in my coffee grinder and used a little less than the recipe called for, skipped putting beans on the top. They were unbelievably delicious--very cakelike, very moist, nice espresso flavor, not too chocolately. Would have liked the Kahlua to have been more present--next time will add 50-100% more than the recipe calls for. Will make again and again.

Quite a dessert for such an easy recipe! Very moist...

I made these yesterday for a picnic and it was a huge hit. I doubled the recipe, added an extra egg (5 eggs total), used instant coffee (because I didn't have instant espresso), a good grade of chocolate and Penzey's double-strength vanilla. Results were fantastic. This will be my new "house" brownie recipe.

Not as thick as I would like, but a very nice mocha flavor. Mine were quite moist.

I used an extra oz. of chocolate and baked in an 8 inch pan for additional minutes. It was very fudgy; even a very small piece leaves a strong and curiously odd taste in the mouth that kills all desire to pick up another piece. This is coming from someone who lives for rich desserts.

These were very moist and delicate. Not too dense and fudgey, and not cakey either. Right in between just how I like my brownies. The top came out nice and shiny too. Even better the next day.

This is my favorite brownie recipe. I've been making these brownies every Christmas since the recipe came out. I send them to friends and family with my gifts. Now they ask for them every year.

This is a great recipe, a true crowd pleaser. I have to admit, I am a creature of habit, so I have made these brownies many times!! They always get rave reviews, probably because my family and friends all tend to be coffee-lovers. A tip that I confess: I use instant coffee, not espresso, can't find it in this small town of mine!

Judging from the previous reviews, people either love these or hate. Well, I'm a coffee lover, and I thought these were fantastic! I skipped the espresso beans and used an 8-inch pan (don't own a 9-inch) -- but, other than that, I followed the recipe faithfully. I've made these repeatedly. These are so good!!

I have made this recipe many, many times. Since I am a mountain hiker I make these to bring along for our celebrations of reaching the peak. Some people call me Kahlua George. To prevnet dryness, make sure the melted chocholate and butter have cooled sufficiently.

Yeah, baby! I've been making these since the recipe was published in the Dec/96 Gourmet. (Some of the other brownie recipes from the same article are good, too.) I omit the beans, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. Dense, intense and dee-lightful!

To prevent the dryness some folks are complaining about, simply add another egg. These are great!!

I love these and have made them over and over for friends and family. My only problem is not having the will power to let them cool all the way before digging in.

I am a big brownie fan - but I was not overly thrilled with this recipe. They are too dense, too dry and not quite as flavorful as I had hoped.

This is my "house" brownie recipe...family loves it...easy to make...melt butter & chocolate in a double boiler, it's safer

Great recipe -- I've made this brownie many times. It's for people who like a dense, chewy texture and an intense flavour; I personally don't like the thick, cakey kind with barely-there flavours. Kids may not like this; I served it to a ten-year-old who said it tasted too "grown-up."

I also used Starbucks espresso beans (lightly ground so that I could sprinkle over the brownies rather than set the beans in rows), the instant espresso powder and the Kahlua. I added some slivered almonds on top just because I like brownies with nuts. We all found this brownie to be too dry (even with high altitude adjustment), too flat, too heavy and too strong. I have other brownie recipes that I use Kahlua in that I might incorperate a lesser amount of the espresso and beans into to experiment. I like the coffee ingredients but found this recipie just too overpowering and the cake not particularly enjoyable.

Fantastic. They were a hit. I substituted regular Starbucks beans, and instant coffee powder for the espresso powder. They were quick, and they travel nicely.
