Really, really easy dessert. Threw this together last minute while making dinner and it was a perfect weeknight dessert. It can bake in the oven with whatever else (almost) you're making already. Really good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for that hot & cold thing.

A quick and easy dessert for a small group? The vanilla ice cream is a must! Would cut back a touch on the lemon. Family loved it!

Great summer dessert! Used my blueberries that we had picked this summer and had frozen. Doubled and used a 9x13 pan, no need to double crust (maybe 1-1/2) because I had dough left over. Cut sugar by a 1/4 cup. Will keep as a favorite for blueberries!

The cobbler was good but way too sweet for our taste. If I made it again in would use half as much sugar in the blueberries. I used small ramekins and the recipe made 8 with enough topping left over to make two scones.

If I could have awarded this 10 forks, I would have! I made this with wild Huckle Berries. It was not even close to cooled when it was eaten. Next time I will try this with blue berries and blackberries

Easy and delicious. My guests loved it. If you have leftovers top your chilled cobbler with Greek yogurt for breakfast. I used Fage 0%, very yummy. I'm sure it would be good reheated too but since it was warm outside when I ate this for breakfast I decided to eat this cold from a night in the fridge.

This got rave reviews. Easy and really delicious. We made it with fresh Michigan blueberries that were tart and flavorful but not too sweet, so the cobbler wasn't obnoxiously sugary. The topping (I made it with sour cream) was much better than the usual crumbly cobbler topping.

I followed the recipe as is, with the exception of adding non-fat greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche. I made about 7 ramekins full, served with ice cream...delicious!

Nice simple flavors with a slight lemony brightness; easy summer dessert. The creme fraiche added a tenderness to the biscuits. I used strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. I also doubled the recipe and baked it in a 13x9 dish. Recieved rave reviews.

This was a great, easy, summertime dessert! I followed it as stated and it was perfect. I bought blueberries from the farmers' market and I think it made all the difference too. I'm not sure it would have been as delicious with tart blueberries.
