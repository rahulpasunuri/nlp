We followed the directions as is- really good! Would be an excellent side to grilled shrimp or rosemary rubbed chicken. (Although we had it with a green salad and chianti!)

I followed the cooking instructions, but added a drained, chopped can of anchovies to the minced garlic. Knowing our heat tolerance, I halved the amount of chili - perfect for us. I like garlic pasta and used spagetti instead of bucatini and will probably always choose some type of spaghetti. This was simple and very flavorful!
