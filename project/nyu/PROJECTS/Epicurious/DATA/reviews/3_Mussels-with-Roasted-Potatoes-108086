This was great - so quick and easy, yet felt like a treat. I had no wine on hand, so used chicken broth instead, and really enjoyed it. mmm!

I love both mussels and potatoes so this dish really couldn't go wrong for me. The broth was a little thin so I just reduced it some more. I also enjoyed potatoes to sop up the sauce as an alternative to bread. I will definatly make this quick, simple, tasty and inexpensive dish again.

Though the flavors involved are nothing elaborate, the fresh mussels really shined through. The potatos make a wonderful way to soak up and enjoy the broth. Simple yet great, and actually a quite inexpensive, low maintenance meal.

I felt this was just OK. It needs something to pick it up. The texture and flavor of the broth were thin.
