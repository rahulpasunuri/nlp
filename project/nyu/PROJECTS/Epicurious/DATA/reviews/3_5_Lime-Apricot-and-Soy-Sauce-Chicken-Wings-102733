Tasty flavor. To avoid burning, just reduce the glaze in a saucepan until reasonably thick, and cook seasoned chicken wings without glaze. Then glaze them during the last 10-15 mins of cooking. Reducing beforehand will give you the thick stickiness you're looking for without risking burning the whole thing. Hope that helps

Wow, I thought this recipe was terrible..and so many good reviews! I should have been worried initially when I saw the lengthy cooking time to get the sauce to that sticky point. Mine barely finished the first round and they were already a bit overcooked. Suffice it to say I pulled them out so we could eat but of course they were still sitting in a bath of the glaze so not much flavor. I am an experienced cook..and I do NOT recommend this recipe

I followed the recipe exactly, but cooked them at 350 planning to cook them longer. I ended up cooking them for the time the recipe gave. Even at the lower temperature the sauce had a burnt taste to it. I prefer my own roasted wings. (in my opinion roasted wings are WAY better than fried)

I added this recipe to my box in 2002 and I think I have made these wings at most parties since then. They are fairly easy an everyone I know loves them. I agree with others that they easily burn, so keep an eye on them.

Excellent recipe. Our group gobbled it down. It was so easy, too. I didn't seem to have the problems some of the other cooks did with getting too black. I just tuned oven down to 400 and flipped at 1 hour. Then watched after the second hour til they had the amount of carmelization that we wanted. yum

This an awesome recipe! I also added a whole lime in to the blender to get some extra flavor in there with the zest and rind. And I added a little crushed red pepper flakes and some garlic salt. 425 is too high, I cooked at 375 and it as perfect! One time I ran out of enough apricot preserves so I added some chutney that I had on hand and it was fabulous too.

Super-sticky and they do burn. We all thought they were good but not great.

This recipe is definitely a people -pleaser. I have served it as an hors d'oeuvre at dinner parties. I have brought it to many "bring a dish" events. It is always gobbled up to the last piece so I guess you would have to say that it's really good. Somebody ALWAYS asks me for the recipe!

I served these wings at a Valentine's Day party and everyone raved over them! I ended up cooking 30 pounds and had very little leftover, much to my boyfriend's dismay! They are good hot, cold or room temperature. I agree with other raters--this recipe is very good with boneless thigh strips.

Rating: 1
What went wrong? After the first 50 minutes at 425F the wings were almost charred beyond recognition (a new GE oven that is very accurate). I cut the recipe in half, could that have made a difference? Perhaps I'll try it again with a lower oven, 375F.

I love chicken wings and come back to this recipe time and time again. It's always a big hit when I make it, and it's good served at room temp or straight out of the fridge. Do use disposable roasting pans or line yours with non-stick foil.

Made these for a GNO party with some changes and they were a big hit. I took the advice of another reviewer and used orange marmalade (no added sugar) instead, and then added more garlic, ginger, lime zest as well as the juice, and chipolte pepper. I cooked the wings until crisp, then brushed them several times with the marimade. Just before serving, I poured the rest of the marinade onto the wings and put them under the broiler. I topped them with thinly sliced green onions - wow!

Rating: 2
Um, it was okay.....they came out perfect..I lowered the temp to 350 after 50 minutes, but the thing that disappointed me was the lack of flavor. These wings would taste SO much better if you use your favorite bbq sauce instead of the lime apricot thing....I just was not wowed by the flavor....kind of bland.....I'll make these oven wings again, but with some bbq sauce next time.

Great Rx. I used a low sodium soy sauce and substituted Orange Marmalade instead of Apricot Jam. I added some hot pepper flakes as previous suggested. The wings tasted great everyone enjoyed them. Also, lowered temp to 350 and baked for 30 min after initially about 40 minutes at 425. The chicken was moist and nicely caramelized

I have made these with many cuts of chicken, most recently boneless thighs for my sister's bridal shower, and always to rave reviews, even from the kids. Just adjust the cooking time depending on the cut.

I've made this recipe several times for parties and they always disappear. Easy dish. I use bottled lime juice to save time and add a little extra sugar to speed carmelization. I don't recommend using frozen wings. They are too watery and inhibit the carmelization (I know this from experience, not theory) -- use fresh or thawed wings only.

Rating: 4
These were wonderful. I added some fresh grated ginger and red chili flakes to the sauce (added some depth and heat). I also used approx. 1/3rd of the sauce as a marinade- for about 4 hours. Then reduced the remaining sauce to expedite the 'glaze' effect when poured over the wings. Instead of putting the glaze on imediately, I baked the wings, skin side down to render out the fat and make skin crispy, for about 30 min. I then poured the glaze over the top and baked for another 30 min. They turned out -fall off the bone tender, with crispy skin and wonderfully carmelized with flavor. I won't be 'allowed' to make wings any other way- until we get tired of these...

Rating: 3
This is a great and easy recipe to make. However, 8 pounds of wings makes far to many for the average party. I would recommend buying a 5 pound bag of frozen Tyson wings and halving the recipe. Watch the oven, because the sugar will burn!

I have made these many times - they are just wonderful and always a big hit. I seved these to a chef friend and she went crazy for them. Use a foil pan and just watch the cooking time because with all the sugar in the recipe, they do tend to burn. Enjoy!

I made these for the Superbowl and they were a hit. I let them blacken a bit per the recipe (not charred, of course) - turning them several times, though, and they were great that way - the sauce kept them from overcooking and at the same time the crispy skin was really tasty. Would definitely make this recipe again.

I have made these many, many times for family get togethers to large scale cocktail parties and they never fail to be a hit. I make two batches. One is as the recipe states. The other I like to add hot pepper flakes or dried red chili peppers directly to the sauce as they back. Delicious! If you like hot stuff, this is the ticket to GREAT wings! Enjoy!

I baked them for 35 minutes and then flipped them and baked for an hour. They were DELICIOUS. Tangy from the lime, sweet from the sugar and apricot and just a yummy sweet glaze. This is going into our regular rotation.

Family loves me to make these as a treat for holiday buffet...and they disappear very quickly! A tip:Just be sure to watch in oven so they don't overcook, as other cook from DE observed; it is best to lower temperature or they become dried out or charred.

I thought this was just so-so, although my son and husband liked them. I expected more flavor....maybe it was the type of soy sauce I used. I used frozen wings (thawed) and the drumettes bacame kind of tough and dry by the time they were done. I might try them again sometime with fresh chicken since everyone else here seems to like them.

Rating: 4
These chicken wings were really tasty, however they didn't need to cook as long as indicated in the recipe. I kept an eye on them and after a 1/2 hour lowered the temperature to 350 and cooked them for almost another 40 minutes. They got nice and sticky and the meat fell off the bones, but avoided them being charred.

I adore this recipe and have been making it since it came out in the magazine. I can't go to a party without someone requesting I bring these wings. I generally follow the recipe exactly although I do sometimes use frozen wings (cheaper and faster) in palce of fresh with good results.

I followed this recipe almost exactly. I didn't have quite enough apricot jam so I added the jam that my kids aren't fond of for the balance (raspberry). After reading all the comments, I lined the pans with foil as suggested. However, I figured between the jam and the sugar, of course it will burn. So, I covered the pans with foil and baked for 30 minutes, turned the chicken over, and baked uncovered for 30 minutes. The batch that I put in a roasting pan came out perfect. A rich dark golden color and sticky. However, the batch on the jelly roll pan came out blackened and stuck to the foil and I had to throw some out as I couldn't get them off the foil. When I make this again, I will watch them carefully and perhaps turn the heat down for the second half hour.

These wings are great. We've been eating them for years. Thought I'd check the reviews to see what others thought and was dismayed to see how many cooks cut down on the cooking time. The cooking time makes the dish. The first time I made them, I thought I'd ruined them, because they turned black in large part. But they didn't taste burned _ they were delicious. And I'm not a fan of chicken wings. I've made these with the sauce over frozen chicken wing pieces (same cooking times) and with the sauce over unfrozen chicken wings (same cooking times). Make them for SuperBowl. You won't be sorry. Go Patriots!

this is SOOOOO Good. We've made it several times for various functions. The only suggestion I have--for easier and less messy eating, use thighs and, after cooking, strip the meat from the bones.

I made this with chicken legs and it was the most popular dish at our daycare potluck, served at room temp. The only thing I didn't love was the smell of it in the oven. But when it came out, I have to admit I even ate the extra glaze off the cookie sheet!

I've made this recipe several times for three different showers. It's a hit everytime. But I would change several things, especially the cooking time. The chicken wings don't need to cook more than an hour. The problem is that the sauce is too thin. So I recommend using half the amount of liquids (lime juice and soy sauce) and adding some more sugar (depending if you like your wings to be tangy or sweet). Bake the wings on each side for 20-25 min. Then remove all the remaining sauce from the pan and broil the wings for 5-10 min until a nice carmelized glaze develops. If you don't remove the remaining sauce and broil the wings, they'll look pale, like they were boiled instead of roasted. Alternatively, you could marinate the wings in the sauce for approx 4 hours and then bake the wings without the sauce. They'll develop a nice golden color and still be full of flavor. Just don't marinate the wings too long. I think I read somewhere that soaking meats in acidic juices (like lime juice) for too long can change the texture of the meat.

What a hit for the baby shower! There were none left, and people wanted more. I only cooked them for 50 minutes and that was sufficient time. However, my third tray was too close to the bottom of the oven, and those burnt. Everyone wants the recipe and I'll be making these again. Much easier with the disposable pan. YUM!

Rating: 3
Tried half the recipe -- added a little less lime juice. Baked in less than l l/2 hours -- had to watch the end pieces because they browned much faster than the center pieces. Definitely make it again -- everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
Truly wonderful. I substituted the apricots with some orange marmalade I had on hand. I also cut the batch in half because I thought 8 lbs was too much. I should have made 16 lbs. They were a HIT! Be sure to check your wings after 45 minutes- mine were done and beginning to burn. Also after the wings were done- I removed them and boiled the sauce with a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken. The resulting glaze stuck to the wings beautifully, otherwise the sauce would have been too thin and remained in the bottom of the serving dish. I think this is crucial to the success of this dish

Rating: 3
I'd actually give these wings a 2.5 rating. They were easy to make but the recommended cooking times are all out of wack! I cooked mine for an hour and the meat was literally falling off the bones. My complaint with this recipe is it seems to be lacking depth of flavour. I'd make this again but it isn't my first choice as a marinade.

I thought these wings were excellent! They were so easy to make, you just throw them in the oven in a disposable pan and they're done. Simple and delicious! I agree to cut down the cooking time by about 20-30 minutes. I brought them to a barbeque and was called the next day by the host for the recipe. I definitely recommend this recipe!

Rating: 1
followed it to a tee and ended up with charcoal-like wings, just like another reviewer from Switzerland. I think is would be more fool proof, if the wings are roasted with salt and pepper and then once crispy, tossed with the about 1/2 the glaze, and finished for about 20 minutes more in the oven. They looked done in the first 45 minutes, and I should have taken them out then. It's a long cooking time for a glaze with a lot of potential to carbonize.

I made this for a large party, and served it cold. To the sauce I added about a tablespoon of fresh grated ginger, 1/2 a cup of rice vinegar, and cayenne pepper to taste. This gave the sauce more depth, similiar to the sweet, spicy and sour spikes found in Thai dishes. The wings went quickly and many attending the party complimented both the tenderness of the wings and the sauce. As others have stated, aluminum foil is definitely needed.

Rating: 4
I have made these wings 3 times now and each time everyone has loved them. The last time I made them I used Raspberry jam instead of the apricot perserves, it turned out almost as yummy, but not quite. I will got back to the apricots next time. Also found that i had to cook them about a half hour less in order to avoid burning. Only bad thing is the clean up, but well worth it.

Very tasty and fragrant. My boyfriend loved the sauce from the chicken, though I found it to be very salty. The next time I make this dish I will reduce the amount of soy sauce - 1 cup is definitely generous! Try maybe 3/4 of a cup instead. Easy to make and delicious, this will definitely fall into my regular cooking menu!

These were sooo good. The ingredient list looks a bit strange, I admit, but it all comes together for a tangy, slightly sweet glaze. Mine kind of burned along the egdes of the aluminum pans, but no real problems. I would suggest turning them in the pans so that they are evenly moist. GREAT PARTY FOOD! There were no leftovers and I made 8lbs for 15 people as part of a buffet!

I made these as part of a buffet for a "picnic" type of birthday party. They were gone so fast that I barely got one myself.

We just made these for dinner, adding a bit of minced ginger. The wings were delicious and very easy to make. They were quite browned after only 1 hour and 20 minutes, so we did not cook the full time. We did not find the wings to be too sour, as one reviewer did (in fact, when I told my husband that lime juice was a major ingredient, he was quite surprised). A recommended recipe both for ease of preparation and the tasty result. It would have taken some time to clean a non-disposable baking dish, so I am glad I took the advice of the author and other reviewers and used a disposable foil pan!

Rating: 4
A warning to anyone who makes these wings: 1) do not double the recipe. 2) use the right sized pans. 3) Don't use those frozen, pre-cut wings. I made all of these mistakes the other three times I made these. Finally I followed the directions and they came out perfectly. And they are way better than Buffalo wings!

Rating: 4
I ALWAYS serve these at parties and they are a huge hit. Easy as they cook themselves with little work after the prep, and they litterally fall off the bone they become so tender. I find the pans are a bear to clean so I buy the disposable ones. They're on the menu for Superbowl Sunday!

THIS WAS AN EXCELLANT AND EASY DISH. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO PLEASE ADULT AND KIDS. I GAVE IT 3 FORKS,ONLY BECAUSE BUFFALO WINGS WITH BLUE CHEES DRESSING IS SOOOOO MUCH BETTER. FYI: A TRUE NEW YORKER WELL KNOW IF YOUR NOT USING FRANKS HOT SAUCE!!

Not having apricot preserves on hand, I substituted mango/peach/passionfruit preserve, which tastes quite like apricot. I found the lime juice made the wings quite sour and were I to make this again, would either decrease the lime juice or eliminate it altogether. Also, I cooked the wings no longer than one hour and they were very nicely browned.

Rating: 4
Definitely not the healthiest dish to make. This fact is driven home by the layer of congealed fat you'll find the next day on any leftovers. That being said, these wings are truly delicious so who cares! For the record I made this same recipe with boneless/skinless chicken breast and it came out great and I didn't feel nearly as guilty.

Rating: 4
I have made this dish with wings, but my favorite way is with boneless skinless thighs. Also, I cook the thighs in a rectangular baking pan which makes the soy/apricot mixture deeper and thus less likely to cause a burning problem. Everyone loves it and if there are any leftovers they are great the next day cut up and cold in Chinese chicken salad (lettuce, chinese vegs, fruit, spicey peanut sauce, etc.).

Rating: 3
These wings were wonderful but I did mine a bit differently: I cut the recipe in half, had only orange marmalade, used 3 garlic cloves and used some hot pepper sauce. My fussy girls came back for more!! Just a point of interest: The only way to get crispy chicken wings is to deep fry them then add the sauce. There is too much fat on them to crisp in the oven.

Rating: 3
I love this recipe and have made it on several occasions with great success - very easy and a great crowd pleaser. I buy frozen pre-cut wings & drumettes (available at Sam's or BJ's frozen section) to save time and I just pour the marinade over the frozen wings about 2 hours before cooking them (do use disposable cookware). I have found that the cooking time is perfect when I let them partially thaw for 2 hours and then cook them. I also baste and turn frequently in the last hour to get them good and gooey, but not burned. By the time they are done, they are almost carmalized in texture and ready to fall off the bone! Delicious!

I followed this recipe correctly and it turned out burnt and inedible. First, I think 425 degrees is a bit hot to cook wings for over an hour and a half.

Just right. The flavor is mild and not too sweet or sour. Because of all the sugar content you do have watch it carefully as it will tend to blacken if left in the oven too long. Also, I baked my wings before I added the sauce.

This recipe is just as great as the La Brea Tar Pit chicken wings. Just as easy with a different flavor. I made it with legs as we do not care for wings (too much skin) Used peach preserves as I was out of apricot. Just as good. This will be a keeper.
