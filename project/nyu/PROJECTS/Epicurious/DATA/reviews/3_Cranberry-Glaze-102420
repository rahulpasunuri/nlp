Sylvia, this was part of a cake recipe (Orange layer cake with cranberry glaze) from the October 1999 Bon Appetit. If you want a photo , click on the little camera icon next to the title of the (cake) recipe. (Also a photo in the magazine) Hope this helps.

This sounds great and I can't wait to try it! BUT!! Would you please start displaying a picture of the dish? It really helps to see how something should look.

Very quick & easy to make. A beautiful accent atop the Orange layer cake. A little tart...
