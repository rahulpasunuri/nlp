The problem with octopus is that it can get tough if not handled correctly, leading to an unappetizing dish. Pounding it with something to tenderize helps a lot, many japanese chefs tend to use large daikon radishes to pound it, supposedly because of its hard but not too hard texture, so as to not actually pulverize the octopus.

I don't think I'm going to make this recipe, because it doesn't appeal to me, but I don't understand why octopus is so expensive.. In California butchers and fish markets, it's very inexpensive.

This recipe is very un-satisfactory. I bought very expensive octopus and followed the recipe exactly, and many of my guests, even those who loved octopus in the past, left their dishes untouched. I would never make this dish again.
