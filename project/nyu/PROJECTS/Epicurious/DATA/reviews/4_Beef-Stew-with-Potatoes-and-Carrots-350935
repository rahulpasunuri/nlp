This is a great, classic recipe made more delicious by cooking a full, rich broth, removing those vegetables and adding fresh ones at the end. I added quite a bit more tomato paste and left out most of the bouillon since I was using a very salty stock leftover from making Irish spiced beef. Wish I'd added some flour when I browned the beef. My only complaint is that the sauce didn't thicken up much. (Also added a couple pints of white mushrooms cooked down in a little butter/olive oil to make it more like Julia Childs' recipe.) A huge hit with my guests. Note: Yukon gold potatoes are a sweet counterpart to the salty, rich gravy and hold their shape well.

I cut the recipe in half as I'm only cooking for 2 and don't have a pot that big. I added parsnip to the potatoes and carrots as this is a stew favourite for me. I had my own homemade beef stock, so no salt added. Chose an inexpensive Ontario Cab Sauv (another good reason to cut the recipe in half, left over wine). Was hesitant to add water to the broth after using my good broth and wine, but that worked out. My only confusion was near the end of the recipe where it is unclear about how to continue after using the colander. I discarded the boiled through vegetables and returned the beef and stock to the pot, but wasn't sure if it was supposed to go back in the oven??? I cooked it on the stove top just long enough for the carrots and potatoes to tender. It worked out well enough. your suggestions are welcomed

Wonderful flavor! Made a few changes. Dredged cubes in flour, used 4 cups beef broth, 1 cup water as the box of broth is 4 cups. I didn't discard the original veggies, no need. I added fresh English peas.

Forgive me for amending, but it seems I'm in good company - and it's really just tweaking, eh? I pureed the veggies (as I usually do) and added a bit of anchovy paste later on. The puree is perhaps the reason for the substantive broth. The dish is not quite out of the oven, but it is WONDERFUL! (yes, I've been snitching!) And no excess liquid either - in fact I have had to add more broth (could it be because I short-changed the bottle of cabernet sauvignon by one glass?) more likely because of the additions of pearl onions, fresh sliced mushrooms, peas (and I quarted/sliced the potatoes so they are small). It's a beautiful looking dish, the house smells amazing and I'm almost loathe to give it away (as it is for a friend in mourning), but it is certainly a dish that will bring a measure of comfort.

Didn't like the balsamic vinegar--too acidic with the tomato paste for me.

I cut the recipe in half, but I cut the amount of wine added in half again. (6 oz of good CA Pinot Noir - too nice to waste in a stew, heh.) I used homemade lamb stock, as that was what I had on hand. Really nice! Not bland as some reviewers have claimed. I prefer spicy food to bland, and did not feel the need to increase the heat here. The meat was tender and the rich stock was thick. Oh- I did dredge in flour before browning.

Rating: 4
excellent! I dusted the meat with flour prior to browning... As suggested by a few others, instead of discarding the vegetables after braising, I added them back after putting them through food processor. Had it for dinner last night... breakfast this morning! Pulled the meat apart with two forks, heated it up in a skillet and put it atop muffin, eggs with green onions & a slice of cheese... yummy!!

We were really looking forward to this dish and found it fell flat. We've had better, more flavorful stews. This one was sweetish and lacked depth despite the full bottle of wine. It's unlikely we'll go to the effort or cost of this again.

I found the directions hard to follow, and it took a long time to make. However, the end result was worth it! I suggest boiling the potatoes while the stew is in the oven and then add 30mins before you take it out of the oven. This was you don't have to wait another 40mins.

Winner for sure. It's really not that tedious to make. I made it in two dutch ovens which really made it easy. I also added some mushrooms and a little cayenne pepper since I like a little heat. I will say that the stew base was a bit thin and not as bold as I wanted right when I pulled it from the oven. So, instead of tossing the braised veggies, I picked out most of them, tossed them in the blender with a little stew juice and pureed them then returned the whole thing back into the stew (make sure to squeeze the garlic out of it's paper shells back into the stew as well). Made a huge difference. Much bolder flavors and also acted as perfect thickener. I'm gluten free so I didn't want to dredge the meat in flour. No need, this trick works and adds much flavor to the stew. People LOVED it. Will be making again for sure. If you're trying to save a couple $ you can go with less meat, the 5lbs is a lot of meat.

This is a great recipe! I only had an hour to make it so I used the pressure cooker omitting only the water. Followed all the steps and cooked it for 35 minutes on high, and it was perfect! One hour from prep to table.

This was delicious. However, rather than discarding the solids as recommended, I would pick out the thyme stems and bay leaves, then put the remainder in a food processor to thicken the stew. Sad to waste all those good vegies.

YUM! I followed the ingredients almost exactly, I used dried thyme, and I saw previous comments about it being a bit thin, so I dusted the meat in flour, salt and pepper before browning. I modified the preparation a bit to save a little time. I cooked the veggies in the heavy pot while I browned the meat in other pans. More washing, but there is lots of time to wash while it's in the oven. Then, when I added the wine, I brought it to a boil for only 5 minutes, and added four cups of low sodium beef broth - no water - the meat, juices, and popped it in the oven. After 1.5 hours, no straining out the other veggies, just added in the potatoes and carrots, and back in the oven for the last hour. The sauce was the perfect consistency, and my kids had seconds. This will be two dinners for us, can't wait to try it after the flavors blend overnight. This is a really good stew, I will definitely make it again.

This was a good recipe but I didn't get where the author states in one line add the carrots and then at the bottom it states cook the carrots making it sound like it's separately cooked along with the potatoes. Very confusing. Anyway, I made my own changes to this and it came out rad.

Rating: 0
In general, the recipe was good. The amount of time that went into it versus the result, however, is questionable. I've made other beef stews in the past without as many steps, with the same or better results. I would recommend trying it out, but don't know if I would make it again myself. I should mention that I followed the recipe exactly, except straining the veggies (after reading other reviews), and thickened my stew with a little flour.

Rating: 0
It tasted good, however, after 2.5 hours the meat is so tender that putting it into a colandar and removing the mirepoix was a problem, you had to almost hand pick the veggies out. Another thing is that you will not brown 5 lbs of meat in three shifts, more like 5 or 6.

First off, I have to admit that I don't know squat about the varying degrees of quality of Balsamic vinaigrette. I live in a Virginian suburb of Washington D.C. and shop in a generic grocery store where my choices are limited. That said, after reducing the liquid with the vinaigrette as instructed almost all liquid was burnt off. Makes me wonder if the other contributors might have been too impatient. Like most I didn't bother to strain the yummy slow cooked vegetables. One hour before finish I added one inch cut baby carrots. Next time I'll add quarter cut onions as well. My biggest problem was that my daughter has been brought up in one of these modern school systems which has educated her to know better than to eat carbohydrate rich and fat laden foods Win, win...I cut out the potatoes, doubled the carrots and served it over brown rice. She loved it! Absolutely buy a prime chuck roast, trim the fat and cut it up yourself.

This recipe has one major error - the use of balsamic vinegar. Quality and taste (sweetness/thickness) of balsamic varies GREATLY. Some is suitable as an ice cream topping others are much lighter. I use high quality, and used only 1/4 cup and my son who is not a picky eater complained it was too sweet. I used Cabernet for the wine. So you really need to consider your particular type of balsamic combined with how dry the wine you are using is. In general I think this recipe would be better with very little or no balsamic (maybe a couple tablespoons of good quality, or max 1/4 cup of low quality/weak balsamic) Can't believe this go 4 stars with this flaw.

Great make-ahead recipe for a large crowd. Worth the effort!Tripled the recipe which was fine.Seasoned and floured meat before browning. Braised the beef the day before and put in refrigerator overnight.Did not strain, veggies disolved in the braising mixture. Sauted carrots and added mushrooms the day of party. Covered and reheated in oven. Needed more liquid when reheating. Omitted the garlic and potatoes, but made garlic mashed potatoes to go with stew. Large salad and warm crusty bread. Will do again and again!

So tasty and the house smelled so good! Like many, I did not discard the solids. I just added the potatoes, and other root veggies (sweet potatoes and turnips) to the pot at the 1.5 hour mark and let the oven do the work. The meat and veggies braised for just under 2.5 hours and WOW is all I can say. Only additional change I made was adding a tad bit more tomato paste, thyme and garlic. I also used onion powder. Oh, I had to thicken it up with a little flour and stew broth mixture. The wine of choice? A delightful Oregon Pinot Noir which we drank with dinner. Served atop of a nice hunk of homemade cornbread. Simply delish!

Like the other reviewers, I did not discard the vegetables between steps. I also added button mushrooms and turnips with the carrots and potatoes. In addition, I used full sodium beef broth and was glad I did - don't think the salt level would have been good w/o it. Recipe was OUTSTANDING - will definitely be making it again!!!

The first time I made this I had gone looking for a basic stew recipe to feed a large group at a harvest party in September. The weather had turned bad and our barbecue plans went out the window. I did not strain the vegetables and I added the potatoes and carrots into the initial vegetable mixture. I also added some spinach. It was such a big hit with my group that I did not get to try any myself other than wiping the bottom of the pot with a piece of bread! Looking for a simple make ahead hearty dish to feed my visiting family this weekend I turned to it once again. I agree with many reviewers that you can simplify and making it ahead infuses the flavors more. Simple and Delicious.

This recipe is way faster to make if you use leftover roast and add the 2" chunks of meat when you add the stock. I also did not strain out the veggies.

This recipe was delicious and flavorful. My whole family liked it. However, I did not braise for 2 1/2 hours but 1 and 10 minutes. I would do the same next time and add the carrots and potatoes in at the time of braising. I also did not discard the other vegetables and left them while serving. Definitely will be added to the winter dishes!

I'm embarking on a kitchen renovation next week and decided to have a cook-a-thon for food that can accomodate my soon to be relationship with a microwave. Since I had already packed my recipe for beef stew, like you, I went to my next source ... I wouldn't call this "traditional beef stew" and was surprised at how similar the recipe is to my favorite braised short ribs. I decided to give it a try to see if the taste was similar without all of the fat and it turned out quite well. I made it short-rib style and browned the beef (cubed tri-tip), remove from the dutch oven, saute 2/3 cups each of medium diced onion, carrots and celery for 6 - 8 minutes, add 1 tbs. chopped thyme, 1-1/2 cups beef broth and 1-1/2 cups dry red wine. No water and no tomato paste. After 2-3/4 hours in a 325 degree oven (I've also made in a slow cooker), remove the beef, add 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar to the sauce (don't pitch the vegetables!), season, pour over the beef and sprinkle with parsley. I serve with mashed potatoes or pasta. 3 forks as again, not a traditional "stew", but the flavors are fab. If you want, try it with the short ribs!

This was OK. I read the reviews on this recipe before I made it and I thought some of them were kind of harsh...but I can kind of see why. There are way too many unnecessary steps in this recipe and the outcome was not as flavorful as it could have been. I would add some crushed pepper in it and reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar, and as many said, add a cube of bullion for added flavor. I think I'll be sticking to my own recipe for beef stew in the future. My husband and I are still hungry!!

Totally a keeper. Love it. Family loves it. We had some leftovers which I froze, and the meat disintegrated upon heating and the whole thing was dry, so I added some commercial barbecue sauce and it was an instant barbecued beef...thing. Odd looking but utterly delicious.

I've never reviewed a recipe before, but this beef stew was ridiculously great. Everyone in my family from my 87 year old dad, to my 31 year old daughter couldn't get enough of it. I made the full 5 pounds and followed the recipe exactly...except I didn't strain the brown veggies. For anyone who worries about adding balsamic vinegar...just use the good stuff. Not the great $40 a bottle vinegar...but not the cheap salad dressing vinegar either. A nice sweet, starting to thicken balsamic vinegar is perfect! I didn't dredge the meat and the sauce was perfect. I used the full bottle of wine, with the beef stock and the water and there was plenty of gravy. I'll be making another 5 pounds at my kids' request so they can have some in the freezer at all times. Man, this was yummy!

I've now made this recipe twice with success. While the recipe is labor intensive and takes time, the end product is worth it - a very hearty and tasty beef stew that rivals any I've had in the past. Some things I've learned: 1. Keep a can (14oz) of beef broth or two for later - one for after braising stew and separating out meat and then for reheating next day. There just doesn't seem to be enough broth to cook added carrots and potatoes. Also, add a bouillon cube for more flavor. 2. After straining, remove all meat and then press solids for extra liquid. With remaining solids, remove thyme sprigs and bay leaves, press garlic paste from cloves, add some to meat and broth in the pot and then puree the remaining carrots, celery, onions and other garlic leftover and add to broth containing meat and new carrots and potatoes. Then, add about a cup of water and stir before simmering for about an hour to cook new vegetables thoroughly. Frozen peas are a nice touch. 3. If you can, buy the stew meat already trimmed and cut into pieces. For the extra $1 or so a pound, it's well worth the time savings. 3. For wine, use Crane Lake Pinot Noir. It's 4.99/bottle. Finally, do this on a weekend day and start in the morning.

I would first like to say that I enjoyed my end product, but I made several adjustments along the way. The large quantity of red wine and vinegar created a flavor profile that didn't feel as hearty as I would typically seek in a stew, so I substituted beef broth water, and (cheated) threw in a beef bouillon cube (2). I felt so GUILTY trashing the original carrots, onions and celery, next time I will take them out so they don't turn to mush while the potatoes cook, but will toss them back in just a few minutes before serving. My final cheat was that I was tired of waiting and hadn't arrived at the consistency I was looking for so I looked to my good friend Paula Deen who suggested removing 2 cups of the liquid and whisking with cornstarch. At the end of the day I took some shortcuts but I would up with a really excellent stew that also was great leftover!

I was looking for a really flavorful stew for a potluck. This was a hit although I personally thought it was more work than it was worth. However, the next day I used a chunk of leftover beef and kind of made up a stovetop stew using the ingredients (used chopped garlic) and most of the instructions in this recipe and it was easy, quicker, and just as good. As a matter of fact, the meat turned out more tender on the stovetop than when I cooked it in the oven as this recipe calls for. I didn't measure any of the ingredients for the stove-top version, just went with what I felt like dumping in and it really tasted great. Probably used more balsamic than is called for, but I didn't find that flavor to be overpowering in the end result.

I made this with 2 cups of broth instead of three, no Thyme, added 5 serano chiles and 2 red chiles (name unknown). Used about 1¾ cup of red cooking wine, half of a very large onion, and put two potatoes in 45 minutes before the end. Roast was a little over 2 pounds. Should have used a larger roast. Took some time to make before putting into the oven (around an hour). Tastes *very* good! I will definitely make this again!

This was incredible! The perfect food for weathering a tropical storm indoors. As many reviewers suggested I did make some changes. First, I decreased the meat to 3 lbs, which was plenty! I left out celery (too expensive at whole foods), and cut the balsamic a little bit. I also did flour the meat before browning, which really stuck to my pot. I would only recommend doing that if you're using nonstick cookware. The LeCreuset did not like it at all (I deglazed the pot with wine, and all was good, but I really had to scrape it). I also used 6 cups beef broth and I added frozen peas at the end of cooking. And finally, I left out the potatoes at the end and served it with mashed potatoes, which was AWESOME. Highly recommend that. All these changes made this perfect! I would totally make this again.

Excellent! Well worth the effort,the balsamic lended a rich and not too sweet quality. The liquid was dense, rich, and deep and the meat melted in my mouth. I halved this recipe with no sacrifice in the result (I wished I would have made the whole amount). My stew meat was cut half the size of what was called out and then I chose to serve over mashed potatoes rather than include the potatoes in the stew itself.

Excellent broth results, although it cooked down in the oven enough to require additional liquid when adding the potatoes and carrots at the finish. I always make the recipe exactly as written the first time I make a recipe. I would wrap the vegetables in cheesecloth to avoid having to pick out the meat towards the end of the prep.

I made only a couple of changes to the recipe, dredging the meat before browning, and substituting about 1/8 tsp. of celery seed for the thyme.

This stew came out rich, hearty, flavorful and aromatic. Perfect over rice or with thick-crusted country-style bread. My modest modifications: 1) Cooked the whole recipe in a pot on the stove-top; 2) planned 8-10 servings; so: 3) used 4 pounds of beef; 4) used half pound less of potatoes and carrot; 5) lightly coated beef in flour and seasoning before browning; 6) chopped (finely diced) the vegetables (including garlic) for the first part of cooking and of course left them in later - they thickened the gravy; 7) omitted thyme; 8) Cooked with lid half on once adding the potatoes and carrots. Found the "day ahead" tip to be very helpful. And not a drop was left!

I made this last night, and everyone raved. I thought it was not amazing but very good. I added cremini mushrooms to the veggies you brown at the start. Like many others, I did not discard the carrots or onions I browned but I did toss the celery. The balsamic/wine/broth/tom paste sauce was very good but didn't even come close to covering the potatoes and carrots you add after the 2.5 hours, so I had to add more wine and broth and then reduce it some. I served this with pain de campagne and a fresh pea/endive/radicchio salad with shaved parmesan and a lemon vinaigrette. Delish!

My favorite parts of this site are the reviews. Thank you, everyone, for helping me find success on every recipe. For this one, per the reviews, I added some cornstarch/water while the mix was bubbling, to thicken it. Before putting the pot into the oven, I added extra veggies I had on hand: green beans and spaghetti squash. Then, after the time in the oven, like many reviewers, I didn't toss out the veggies I had braised along with the beef. My final concoction was quite thick. Had to add a bit of extra red wine for the final stage - cooking some carrots and a sweet potato. Absolutely delish!

This is an excellent beef stew. I made it tonight to eat tomorrow. My kids loved the sauce and we tasted on piece of beef which was tender. Very flavorful. I had 3lbs of beef and made the following tweaks to allow for a thicker sauce since many later reviews said the sauce was watery and lacked flavor. I used 2 onions and eighthed each one instead of quarted. Used a whole head of garlic, peeled the skins of the cloves but kept them whole. I still used 3 tbs of tomato paste, a little less than 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar, used 1/2 cup of dry red wine; 2 cups of beef broth and added no additional water. I added a 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce too. I braised for 2 hours (1 hour at 350 and the other 250) and added the potatoes about 40 min. prior like the recipe said to do. Next time I would braise for about 1 1/2 at 350. Meat is a bit dry but soft and not chewy.

I have never made a tomato paste based stew ever and I have to say that I will every time now. But this is only after reading reviews and adjusting my own to my taste. I love the wine, balsamic and tomato paste base. I personally like a thicker stew so I floured my cubes (I used venison) and lifted those bits with red wine. I also added potatoes because I like stew with potatoes but that is just my personal taste. Spices? I too added thyme and bay leaves (5) I really do love this and am going to serve it in a few weeks for a winter fun day!

Previous reviewer, Ms. Donnelly, makes a good point; this a good BASIC recipe from which to work from in order to reach stew nirvana. However, just a couple of simple adjustments will transform this recipe into a true winner. The recipe excels in establishing some base flavor components with the wine, tomato paste, and balsamic (please, do NOT skip these). It, however, lacks spice, using just a bit of thyme and bay leaves to flavor 5 pounds of meat and over 4 pounds of vegetables!?! Preposterous! My adjustment for this recipe was as simple as seasoning both meat and vegetables before they were sauteed. I chose a North-African flavor profile and made a spice blend with 2T oregano, 1T cumin, 1T coriander, 2t cinnamon. Play with any combination of spices that sound attractive to you. Be bold and generous. In regards to the "watery" issue other reviewers address, simply hold back on the water and broth. Add enough to liquid to just cover the ingredients before it goes into the oven. You can always add more later, as necessary. Also, I found no need to go through the tedious process of separating the meat from the original batch of vegetables. I had originally cut them small enough, so that they dissolved into the stewy gunk. Good luck, and happy tweaking!

I've been testing many stew recipes this past year trying to find my one "go to" stew recipe that stands above all others. This recipe is perfectly acceptable, but it's not the standout recipe for which I am looking. I do really like the flavor the balsamic adds. However at the end of the day this stew is a bit too soupy, and the depth of flavor I'm looking for just isn't quite there. The meat is incredibly tender which is a big plus. So far the front runner in all of my stew recipe testing is Jacques Pepin's beef in red wine (Food and Wine's website carries the recipe). It packs more flavor punch per bite than this particular recipe. I first tried this stew as the recipe calls. Too soupy for my taste. I then tried thickening it by pureeing the vegetables as other reviewers suggested. It did thicken the sauce but gave it a strange texture. Nobody who tastes this dish will say it's a bad dish. It's a perfectly good dish. Just not THE great stew I'm searching for. That being said, anybody would be happy if you served this to them on a cold day with a nice crusty baguette.

I wanted a thick stew so I dredged the beef in seasoned flour before I browned it. Added some other veggies; a parsnip with the carrots, celery and onions, some mushrooms (partially cooked in the microwave to get rid of some of the juices) with the potatoes and carrots. Also added some thawed peas at the very last second. Excellent results!

Rating: 3
Woudl prefer to make with a beer base instead of the red wine. I also added peas and mushrooms and left all the veggies in (a definite must). Also, pushed the veggies to the side and made a rue with olive oil and flour to give it some thickness (and to prevent it from being a "brothy" stew). It came out good...but gave 3 forks because I think that the wine gave it a funky taste. Beer would have made this perfect!

I'm one of those annoying cooks that deviates from the recipe, but perhaps you can learn from my mistake: I stayed true to the recipe as written at the beginning, and ended up with a lovely rich broth and perfectly cooked beef. After straining the broth, I decided to add pearl onions, shiitake mushrooms and a parsnip because I had them around the house. I also thought it would make the stew more robust, but it ended up just muting the flavors. Overall it was still good, but I think this stew doesn't need any tweaking.

i made this recipe last night and it was great! everyone thought it was so tasty and i agree that it was very flavorful. i have made stew before but never this savory and we could cut the beef with a spoon(trader joe's kosher beef stew cuts). i will say the red wine was a little strong so next time i might not put quite as much but nevertheless, outstanding!

This was really, really good. Took others suggestions and pureed the seasoning vegetables and added back in to the gravy. I also thickened it with a bit of Arrowroot. Added Baby Bella mushrooms at the end for an earthier flavor as well. The beef was just amazing - fell apart when cut with my spoon!

This stew is great. The only thing I change, based on recommendations either on this recipe or another, is to puree the initial vegetables (carrots, celery, onions, garlic) after they have been cooked. This gives additional texture to the stew, which could be criticized for being too much like a broth. Also added shallots in the final stage as suggested by another. Great!

I wasn't a huge fan of this stew. The consistency was great, but something was off on the flavor for me-maybe it was too much balsamic vinaigrette or the wine I used... I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

Love this recipe. Made it last year too. Reheats beautifully but does not freeze well. I do not strain and discard the solids as recommended because the onion, garlic, celery and carrots add a hearty texture to the stew that my husband loves. Instead of just halving the garlic head, I peel each clove, cut it in half and throw it in. That way, the only thing I remove at the end is the bay leaves and sprigs of thyme.

I made this stew for Christmas Eve dinner and the entire family was ranting and raving about it! The wine and balsamic combination is delicious and the meat tender and flavorful. I also added peas and mushrooms at the end, as well as a pinch of cayenne pepper for just a little kick. Paired with a crunchy loaf of french bread, this is a perfect meal. I can't wait for the leftovers today!

I got rave reviews on this stew. Having non-gluten needs in the family, it was a perfect recipe. I browned the meat really well, which helped give the broth the richness one expects from stew. I tossed 12 shallots in with the carrots and potatoes and thickened the broth at the end. The broth was such a hit that we needed more, so I added beef stock and red wine and simmered what was left before storing it. I like the idea of chipotle peppers to add a kick, and might use some in adobo sauce next time. My foodie kids want the recipe!

This was a good, easy recipe. I added a few additional ingredients to give it a little zip. First I dredged the meat in flour to which I added salt, pepper & cayenne, since many reviewers said the sauce was too thin. I also threw in a few extra herbs. Finally, I added petite boiler onions that I browned in butter and small pieces of bacon when the carrots and potatoes went in. To thicken I added flour mixed with butter at the very end. It was yummy the first night, but really looking forward to the leftovers. With my addditions, I'd give it four forks!

I found this recipe typical with the tomato paste/vinegar combo. Too much work with mediocre results. I agree with the last reviewer and broth needs thickening and followed their suggestion.

Rating: 3
I picked this recipe because I thought it sounded like it had a lot of flavor - especially after reading reviews that said the balsamic vinegar was too strong. This is a good, not great, stew recipe, and without the bite I was looking for. I normally add a little of the sauce from a can of chipotle chilies to my stews, and I think that would have been the perfect addition to this. The only thing I added to this recipe was to stir in a little melted butter mixed with flour at the end to thicken up the sauce a little bit.

After browning the beef in the pan, I just threw everything in the crock pot. Much less fuss. The balsamic is the magic ingredient. Use a good balsamic.

Loved this for friends and for family-4 Forks! Only a few tiny changes- 1) used 4 cloves of garlic 2)used angus chuck which allowed me to cut down the beef cooking time by 1 full hour 3) in addition to the broth called for, added 1 (1.5 oz) pack of glace de veau available at fine food stores. This gave it the restaurant quality richness and it then equalled it's French cousin Beef Bourg. Cheers everyone! use good red wine- it's worth it!

Should have stayed with my tried and true Beef Stew recipe that was handed down from my mother - simple and delicious! I went along with the entire recipe and on advice of other reviews, pureed the vegs and put them back in. Waited until the next day to eat for the flavors to "blend". Very disappointing. It had too much tang and I ended up taking out half the broth, adding "Better Than Boullion" beef paste and water. It was also very time-consuming.

Rating: 3
Past Review Dos and Don'ts: Do: use all the vinegar. It seems harsher right out of the oven but mellows out after a day. Don't: coat the beef with flour before browning. It just makes an impenetrable crust on the bottom of the pan, preventing proper browning. Do: puree the strained veggie bits. It adds tons of flavor and body to the dish.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I made it as directed and got rave reviews from our dinner party guests. I thought a little something was missing though and after reading reviews will puree and add back the braised vegetables and thicken it up a bit. A good depth of flavor though even without it.

Excellent recipe! I did however follow the advice of some of the other reviewers. An absolute must is to NOT discard the solids as the recipe states but rather create a puree to add back into the stew. This adds a ton of flavor and thickens the broth. I also used seasonal veggies with excellent results (carrots, potatoes, turnip, and parsnip). I will keep this recipe handy as I know it will become a fast favorite. Thanks

Great stew! Made two changes: 1) Before browning the beef, coated the pieces by shaking in a ziplock bag with flour and steak seasoning; 2) Chopped the veggies for the braising, then just took out the bay leaves before adding potatoes and carrots. Deep, hearty flavor is perfect for winter evenings with family and friends. And preparing a day ahead is not only convenient but makes the stew even better. Try it, you'll love it!

WOW! This is an amazing stew. I should have written a review before this, as I have been making it for almost two years now. The first thing I will say to those cooks omitting vinegar: DO NOT OMIT THE VINEGAR!!!!!I am wondering if they are using good aged balsamic vinegar or not... I do however agree with putting the original veggies back in - I do this although I don't puree them, I might try that next time. I do not add as many carrots as called for, I found that the stew ended up with too much carroty flavor, so I just dropped the amount and added rutabagas. It makes a good gracious plenty and everyone loves it. The flavors after a day meld beautifully and I can't get enough of this hearty flavor. Just beautiful!!

Rating: 4
Excellent! Based on prior reviewers comments I pureed the carrots/celery/onions and added it back later. I also reduced the vinegar to 1/4 cup. The vinegar seemed strong when I served it but the next day when we ate the left overs it was perfect. I think the lesson with this is to cook it the day before so the vinegar can mellow. My sons loved this.

I am currently eating the leftovers for lunch and feeling very pleased with myself indeed for making this. For the record I am NOT a frequent cook. The "fanciest" thing I've ever made was a roast chicken and that was MONTHS ago. Followed the recipe for the most part, except I used my new slow cooker for the braising instead of the oven. After everything was browned and reduced, I threw it all in the cooker with the broth and set it on low heat for 10 hours. At about 6 hours in, I put in the potatoes and additional carrots. When I got home from work I found the meat tender, the broth flavorful and the potatoes and carrots fully cooked but still holding their shape. Following the advice of other reviewers I pureed the browned vegetables and stirred them back in.Wish I'd made more; I could eat this all week.

With the right tweaks, this recipe is absolutely amazing. I made this on the stovetop with no problem, and followed a number of previous recommendations: 1. cubed beef chuck in 1", not 2" pieces 2. lightly dusted beef with flour before browning 3. did not discard first round of vegetables, but rather pureed them and added at the end to both thicken and flavor the stew 4. used 6 cups of beef stock and no water 5. added 1lb of sliced white mushrooms. I also added about 2 tbl of pepper in the beginning; would probably be too much for many people, but you'll absolutely need more than the recipe calls for. I'll certainly be making this again come winter!

The broth was very flavorful but overall the stew wasn't anything special. It wasn't as thick as I like, although I did add a slurry to thicken it a little more. The addition of the potatoes and carrots at the end meant that they didn't absorb all the flavors, but maybe that's why the recipe says it's better the second day. Ina Garten's beef stew is to die for--I would make it next time.

This was my first beef stew! It turned out very nicely. I'll admit I did not follow the directions about braising (not sure what that is), straining and all that.... I did leave out the balsamic vinegar as one cook said to. Halfway through I was sure that I had messed it up! I sort of just cooked it all together on low for 3 hours but it tasted great! Next time I'll use a little less wine. I did have to thicken (took some of the liquid and mixed it with what I think was cornstarch...) it a bit as I did not let the wine reduce enough. I used 4 cups of beef broth and left out the additional 2 cups of water and was glad that I did. Great flavor though! My fiance liked it as well. He told me it was 'wonderful' and didn't say anything else until he finished eating. :) Thank you for the recipe!! I will be making this again (and will even follow the directions!!) :)

Easy dish and Mmmmm Good! Hearty and full of flavor! Smells delicious too!-- Only thing diff. is I slow cooked this on the stove top on lowest heat for 2 hrs instead of the oven. I added the potatoes during the last 1/2 hr until they were tender. Beef was tasty and tender. I also added mushrooms.

Wow, what a great stew. I cant believe anybody commented on it being labor-intensive. Most of it is just the stew sitting on the stovetop or in the oven. And the prepping of the vegetables, what can you say? Those veggies arent going to cut themselves. Anyway, I did this in between house painting . . . Paint one coat; while its drying, chop some vegetables; while stew is cooking, paint another coat; while paint is drying, chop some more vegetables . . . Anyway, I cut meat to 2 lb (nice amount) and dredged 1/2 of it through 3T flour. Not sure if this helped much. Next time Im going to try it w/o the flour. Then I pureed first set of vegetables, but next time I might not even do this. I might just leave them in. (They are delicious; no need to dig them out and toss them.) I also added mushrooms and parsnips and cut potatoes to 2 lb. Next time I might cut potatoes to 1.5 lb. Also, I used lean chuck stew meat, but this would be a great recipe to try out different meats, especially cheap cuts. Id probably stay away from fattier cuts unless you want to skim grease off top before serving.

This is an excellent recipe as is. The beauty of it is it can be made the day ahead before serving. Having said that, one could make modifications to the recipe to really elevate this dish. You can take the elements: The meat braised in liquid (and I prefer more wine, broth and very little salt at this point) The liquid itself, the potatoes and the carrots. Not including the carrots you have used in the sauce which is strained, the carrots and the potatoes you serve with this can be done separately by steaming them ( You will need two steamers) Baby carrots are charming, and potatoes in nice ovals are very classic. The sauce is further reduced, and a roux can be made to thicken (not too much flour!) With the roux you would take butter on heat and add a bit of flour to expand, not too high of heat, then slowly add liquid and whisk and continue adding in a slow stream to get the consistancy desired. Should not be gummy, but not thin. In presentation you have the sauce placed first on the plate( not too much), then the meat, with some sauced bathed over, then the potato ovals and carrots placed on the side. A sprig of thyme, and finely chopped parsley finishes it. I like all kinds of stews, but this method I have found is the cleanest and brightest in flavor. I would caution that you cannot add the potatoes to the braising liquid and then expect to do the type of reduction method I have shown as when the potatoes break down in the sauce, it doe=s not really lend itself to this kind a reduction. All methods are great in their own way!

Very good recipe! I cut the ingredients in half and my boyfriend and I got 3 filling dinners out of this. I made this in my crock pot after giving my meat a pan sear and sauteing my veg. I added sliced mushrooms and left my veg. whole. I agree with another review that it was more soupy than stewy, so I ladeled out some of my liquid into my pan and added a bit of flour on a low heat and wisked to make a gravy 3/4 of the way through my cooking time and added it back to my crock. I also cut meat a bit smaller than called for in recipe for more bite friendly pieces. I will definetly add this to our winter rotation.

This stew took me five hours, but it was totally worth it. Wow. I followed the recipe exactly, except I put the vegetables from the braising through a food mill and added them to the beef, carrots and potatoes while they were stewing to thicken it. It was delicious, and I can't even imagine how good it's going to be tomorrow. YUM.

I am not a huge Beef Stew fan but this was really good (though time consuming). My butcher only had 2 pounds of boneless beef chuck so I used that along with the stew beef the have already cubed. The difference was amazing. The stew beef was not nearly as tender and delicious as the chuck. I was amazed the difference was so noticable. Also, I pureed the braised veggies - they thickened the stew and gave it more depth.

Very good. I only used 1 lb beef as that was all I had in the freezer. Reduced everything else by about 1/3. It was great. Plenty of sauce since I used so little meat, but still very meaty and hearty. I did not put any water, instead doubled the beef stock qty. I also kept the solids, pureed them and added back to the sauce at the end, which added a nice creamy consistency. This is the first beef stew recipe I will make again. A keeper.

I made this stew for our Thanksgiving Eve meal where everyone brought a soup/stew in a crockpot and mine was, by far, the most raved about there! I'm no gourmet chef, so it was a real thrill to get such excellent feedback - and every last bite was finished off. I will say it was time consuming, but honestly, not a hard dish to make. The changes I made: I added more beef broth, dredged the beef in flour before browning, added mushrooms, peas, and a little more onion, and I did not remove any veggies at any point (although I did my best to remove the thyme and bay leaves before serving). I'm making it again for a different crowd for Christmas Eve dinner!

Wow! This turned out so well. Halved the recipe, added a bit more broth but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. The meat was unbelievably tender - I followed one reviewer's suggestion of braising it at 250 degrees instead of 350. Maybe it would've been fine at 350, but the meat literally melted in your mouth so I think I'll stick to 250. Also, at the end I pureed the solids and added it back in with everything - thickened the stew very nicely. Delicious!

I used less meat and dredged it in flour seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I used more broth and less water. I happened to use 3/4 bottle wine and dried thyme because that's what I had on hand.

Also, I pureed the braised carrots with a bit of additional beef broth, and added the mixture back to the stew.

Bland at best with slightly bitter overtones. I am a good cook and a trained pastry chef, so I'll only accept part of the blame, count my losses, and never make this again. The only thing that saved this from being a one-star recipe is the tenderness of the beef.

I modified this recipe to utilize my crockpot. Essentially, I followed the recipe to the letter, but didn't braise the meat. I dredged the meat chunks in a seasoned flour mixture of salt and pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika (indian store). I just seared it for a few minutes, making sure to turn and sear all sides. I set the meat aside, and continued with the recipe. I then poured all the contents into the crockpot with meat, set it to low, and let it cook for about 11 hours. Unreal!!! This is soooo good! Yes, serve with some good crusty bread, and might I add, a good beer or a dry red wine. It's a very complex and rich stew...lots of depth. Wow it's good!

Wow! Truly exceptional. Although the process can take a while, I found it very simple, especially if you're familiar with the time frames of making stews. Dusted the meat with flour, and only used about 3 pounds of beef because that was all I had. As a matter of fact, I think a dryness issue with some other reviewers lies in the amount of juices per meat and veggies. 2.5 lbs. of beef was perfect. Also, I only braised it for 1 hr and 45 minutes, and then I let it simmer on the stove top for an additional 30 minutes, adding some frozen peas, corn and 1 3/4 chopped potatoes. I used the remaining 1/4 of the potato to grate into the stew, making it an absolutely PERFECT texture. I made this tonight for my sick room mates and they rave about this recipe. Definitely, definitely a keeper. It's so easy to diversify it, too!

This was terrific pretty much as written. The day before serving, I cooked the stew in the oven, used an immersion blender to incorporate the flavors, and then strained out the veggie solids. I then added raw fingerling potatoes and carrot chunks to the stew and put the whole shebang into the refrig. Cooked it the next day, and added fresh green beans (as suggested) to the pot. Delicious!

The carrots are indeed added to the recipe in 2 places. I did not add any water. Instead of 3 cups water and 3 cups broth, I chose to add 6 cups of broth. (Or, if you like, 3 cups water and 3 cups canned beef broth concentrate.) Also, after the initial stewing and after I had taken out all the meat, I removed the bay leaves and any garlic peel. I then took the leftover vegetable and pureed them in blender and added them back to the stew as a thickening agent.

Rating: 4
To "A cook from Stillwater, MN", you are, in fact, supposed to use carrots in both places of the recipe. In the first part, the carrots add flavor to the broth. In the second part, the carrots are added to the stew with the potatoes. Hope that helps for the future. As for my review- this came out very well! It was a great recipe to make on my day off and resulted in a savory stew that earned the boyfriend's stamp of approval. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is VERY time-consuming, and the result was surprisingly bland for all that work. If I were to do it again I'd leave out the water and use an extra portion of red wine instead. I've been looking high and low for a fabulous beef stew recipe and so far the best I've found is one by Jacques Pepin over at Food and Wine, called "Beef Stew in Red Wine Sauce". It's much more flavorful, less work, and is just easer to follow. http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/beef-stew-in-red-wine-sauce/

I would like to make this recipe but I am confused about the instructions. At what point in the process are you supposed to add the carrots and potatoes? Are you supposed to add them after the beef has been braising for 2 1/2 hrs? If so, then when you strain all the solids you remove the potatoes and carrots along with all the other "solids?" Or do you add the potatoes and carrots after the liquid has been sitting for 10 minutes. If you do that, I assume that you add the beef back into the stew along with the potatoes and carrots.

Rating: 2
My meat stewed beautifully with good texture but there was something missing on the taste. Not quite sure whether it's because of the wine I used or the cooking time. It did lose a bit of liquid in the cooking process. I think in future I will increase the amount of broth (for taste). I added celery as well to give it a slightly sweeter flavour. I don't think I'll be in a hurry to make this again.

To those that mention loss of/lack of liquid after braising...I recommend using a heavy dutch oven and then prior to placing the lib on it, cover & seal with foil & then ensure that the lid fits tightly on top of that. You will be surprised at how little liquid you lose!

My family loved this stew! I followed that recipe exactly and we found it to be flavorful and not at all dry as mentioned by others. Will definitely be making this one again!!

one more thing--in the future, rather than adding some beef broth and some water, i won't add water, and will add extra broth and wine. it would not have suffered from the small amount of extra flavor.

this was by far the best stew i've ever had. i'm not even the biggest fan of stew, but this was so yummy!! i usually find the flavors in stew to be a bit muddled, but this had such bright flavors. you CANNOT use the temp printed though or your meat will probably end up tough (this happened to me with so many stew/braise recipes from this site--finally i realized that it needs a LOW SIMMER max--which i did and my meat was sooooooo tender--about 250 for me.) modifications, in case they affected the outcome (apart from the fact that i quartered the recipe, since my family is 2 not 12): i left out celery (don't like it & am on a budget), made mashed potatoes and so did not add potatoes in the last step--added green beans instead about 15 mins before the end. ALSO because there was no potato starch to thicken the stew i added a few TBS of arrowroot.

Fabulous dish. Improves overnight. I added parsnips & turnip and used whole small red potatoes with the skin on. Most flavourful gravy I've made with a stew.

This is excellent! I followed the recipe exactly up until adding the carrots & potatoes. When I pulled it out, though the stew was not dry as some others have reported, it didn't have enough liquid to submerge the carrots & potatoes. So I added another 4 c. beef broth (I like Emeril's - no MSG!) and about 1/3 c. more red wine before simmering the last time. It came out beautifully. The meat is super tender. Very lovely stew.

This was delicious and beautiful. It could hold its own in a nice restaurant or for company. I made this in my slow cooker that has a removable insert which permits stovetop browning of ingredients, so it was simple to make. I cooked it for 7 hours on "low" followed by 1 hour on "high." Did not remove or puree the vegetables, just left them in, and added the cooked potatoes at the end (a pound and a half of Russian fingerlings, cut up). I cooked the carrots with the original ingredients, as well as a turnip. I used 2-1/2 lbs. of beef (not 5 pounds), 4 carrots, no celery but some ground celery seed for the flavor, one minced garlic clove only, and half the amounts of liquid that the recipe calls for, as the overall quantities the recipe calls for would have produced too much for us. I can't imagine it could have been any better. Regarding reviewers who complained about dryness, I wonder if they cooked the stew using a pot with a lid that didn't fit tightly enough.

Last night we had the left-overs and to make it a little different I added steamed green beans just before serving. Next time I'll do this as part of the original dish, it was soooo delicious. I recommend serving with Classic Popovers (from this site - check my review for advice on how to get them to "pop") to scoop up all the yummy sauce.

My husband doesn't like things too "beefy" but he loved this stew. I made a few changes because it seemed strange to throw out all those vegetables so I chopped them quite small so the sauce was like a ragout, reduced the wine and increased the stock by 1 cup, stemmed the thyme and left the leaves in, and increased the tom. paste by 1Tbs. I cooked it for about 4-5 hours on very low simmer and added quartered baby yellow potatoes and thick sliced carrot in last hour. It was DELICIOUS, not too beefy and quite delicate tasting for a stew. Will definitely make again. Great cold night comfort food.

I just finished making this. I wouldn't dream of discarding all those wonderful vegetables! I simply left them in the pot and added the carrots and potatoes. And, I don't understand how anyone could have this recipe end up dry!!! Did you cover the dish while in the oven? There was LOTS of liquid left! Very good taste and I will make this again.

Cooked less than 2.5 hrs, more like 2.Cut initial veggies small, saved, mashed w fork and added back to stew. Used about 1/3 more wine and beef broth, added quartered onions w the potato and carrots. Amazingly good. Can't wait to see what it tastes like tomorrow night! :)

I just made this stew for our office of 7 hungry guys and it was a huge hit. Because of time, I ended up cooking the fresh carrots and potatoes in another 3-4 cups of beef stock while the beef finished braising in the oven. It didn't come out of the oven super dry as others have complained, but adding the extra beef broth from the cooked veggies was a benefit. Because of the depth of flavor of the broth, it would be great served over noodles or rice or, like one other reviewer, over mashed potatoes instead of putting the potatoes in the stew. I loved it, and so did the crew! Definitely will make it again.

Like Kimpaw I had a lot of trouble with the liquids. I followed the recipe exactly but the broth boiled off and when I pulled the stew out of the oven it was pretty dry. I had to use the rest of my broth to make it back into a stew. It really does taste amazing, just add tons more broth and wine!

The flavor for this recipe makes it a 4-forker. The process and quantities listed need adjustment so I only gave it three forks as written. The flavor is great. I cooked as suggested and pulled the stew out of the oven after 2.5 hours very very dry. I added 5 cups of beef broth in order to cook the veggies. If I did it again, I would use 1.5 to 2 bottles of wine for 5 pounds of meat and adjust with additional broth after the meat has cooked. I did not bother to strain the vegetables, I just picked out the garlic halves ( squeezed out any remaining garlic cloves into the pot) and removed the carrots that cook with the meat. I adjusted liquid levels and added fresh carrots and potatoes. I think this process is easier and achieves a more complex broth than the way it i written. Definitely a make again.

This was perfect for a cozy dinner by the fire on a snowy evening. I added frozen peas at the end just before serving. Rather than add the potatoes to the stew, I made mashed potatoes and served the stew over it. Great with crusty bread and a glass of red wine. Even better for left overs. We only made it a week ago, but my husband has requested it again

Rating: 4
A great stew, though time consuming. Cooked on stovetop instead of using oven given some complaints of overlong cooking time. Also, took previous advice and cut up first vegetables smaller than prescribed so that discarding them was unnecessary. Would consider pureeing them in the food processor next time for a better texture. Will make again!

I made this stew last night for tonights dinner. It's excellent. It is, however a lot of work. I believe it's worth it. I stayed pretty true to the recipe. I did flour the meat because of other reviewers...dont bother. DEFINATELY use a stick blender to all the braised vegies; the sauce gets thicker and SOOO delish (thanks for that tip) Watch your meat braising time...2-1/2 hours? Mine was totally tender in 1-1/2 and it would have been mush had I let it continue...but was using cast iron. Leave meat out when cooking the final vegies....it will turn to shredded beef; when all vegies are tender at the end, then add back in and re-warm. Some other cooks had trouble with meat shredding...the cooking time might be too long. The overnight sitting has done it wonders and it was spectacular last night! My husband said "I want incredible beef stew for dinner"..I think I found the right receipe!

I'm in the process of making this a 2nd time in two weeks (unprecedented in my book!). I added fresh rosemary and used dried thyme. I also added sweet potato in with yukon gold potatoes instead of boring boiling potatoes. I made this the night before I wanted to serve it and WOW! Everyone at the table wanted second helpings. This recipe is something to keep in the arsenal for a lifetime!

This was really quite delicious both my kids (12 and 6) and my husband really liked it. I made one change in the method which really worked out well. Instead of cutting the onions, celery and initial carrots big I cut them small. Then when the time came to discard instead I used my immersion blender to smooth out the liquid without discarding anything.

Come on girls let's stop kidding around, this stew is the f***ing BOMB! I've made three batches so far and every time I've served it to guests at least one person places it above their own mom's brisket. Yes it's a little labor intensive (and beef sure isn't getting any cheaper), but for anyone that entertains occasionally or just wants to come home from work and have a restaurant caliber dinner in the time it takes to throw a ball w/ the dog for a few minutes, this stuff rocks.

I made this as my very first attempt at stew. It was a great success with my husband, then with my parents (leftovers!) I first floured and browned the meat, then braised it in the oven for the full 2.5 hrs with extra broth, no water, though. Then, refrigerated it until the next day, without removing solids. The next day, I sauteed some onion and garlic in some olive oil to add even more flavor, since I had added some broth. Next, I cooked the potatoes and carrots separately. I put it all together for a week long stew fest. It was super rich and tender - totally recommend. I am thinking of trying a version of it w/lamb.

Rating: 3
I gave this three forks as my family really liked it. I thought it was way too much work for stew and if you follow the recipe you end up getting rid of things I like in the final dish such as garlic and onions. I did not cook the meat with the carrots and potatoes as it was falling apart and instead added it back after they were cooked. Next time I would braise the meat for about 1 to 1 & 1/2 hours and add the carrots and potatoes without draining.I would peel the garlic and pick out the celery or leave it in.

This is an excellent recipe, but I made it on top of the stove to save time and simplified it a little. I only browned the beef--didn't use carrots, onions etc. at beginning. Instead, I put whole onion and whole garlic clove in the water while beef boiling, which I removed at the end. I used about 2.5lb beef, 4c water, 3tbsp balsamic, and 1c wine. I simmered covered on low for one hour, then uncovered and put in 4 carrots chopped into 2 inch pieces and let it simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. I then added 5 coarsely chopped russet potatoes and simmered uncovered for another 40 minutes. 2 hours total cooking time, and it was the perfect consistency and had plenty of flavor.

Great recipe. I modified it slightly based on others' reviews. I dusted the meat with flour before browning, and when I strained all the veggies from the stew sauce, I cooked potatoes and mushrooms in the sauce alone. Then when they were done, I put the meat back in. Didn't use additional carrots, but threw in some pearl onions as I had them on hand. I ended up cooking this in the oven for about an hour, but after I saw it wasn't cooking fast enough I used the stovetop for the rest of the braising. If I have enough time next time, I'll use the oven. Overall the stew was fantastic, and the smell in the kitchen from this stew was phenomenal. I've saved this recipe to my tastebook (www.tastebook.com) and I'll definitely make this again. Its a great cold weather meal.

Excellent flavor--the tomato paste and balsamic make the stew. I made it on top of the stove instead of the oven, and did not use the vegetables in the beginning. I halved the recipe because I only had 2.5lb of beef. I just browned the beef, added 4c water, 1c wine, 3 Tbsp. balsamic, one whole onion unchopped, and a garlic clove. I simmered it on low for one hour covered, then uncovered it, added the carrots, and 20 minutes after that added 5 coarsley chopped russet potatoes, cooking for a total of 2 hours. Turned out the perfect consistency, and a little faster and easier than the original recipe.

This is a very good, simple stew. The balsamic gives it special flavor. I have a fantastic iron cast pan that kept the liquid warm longer and finishing the meal was a breeze. Will keep the recipe and experiment adding mushrooms in the future. Delicious!

Oh lawsey mercy, but this was so incredibly wonderful! The only change I made is leaving out the potatoes. I served the stew over mashed potatoes and it was well received. My son's girlfriend went back for seconds which is a huge compliment because she a very small appetite. Delicious! You must try this stew.

I think it's hard to make a bad stew... Overall this one is fine, nothing amazing. I would definitely reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar. it is a bit overwhelming with the exisiting proportions. two tablespoons would be enough to add dept to the flavor. ohh, and invest in a pressure cooker - you can make any stew in under an hour!

After enjoying this prepared by friends, I finally attempted it and took into account some comments by others. Accordingly, I did obtain additional liquid from the braising veggies by pressing them with the back of a spoon, and I added a little more beef broth. So I did have enough liquid for the final potato and carrot stage. However, I had to cook it so much longer (total of 2 hours) in the oven because the potatos and carrots weren't cooking through. I suspect that the liquid cools far too much during that 10 minute "resting time" (and the pot cools somewhat too) for the 40 minutes back in the oven to be sufficient. Next time I will try simemring on the stove to quickly return it to a proper temperature before returning it to the oven. I may also try the suggestion by others to cook those potatos and carrots in the braised liquid without the cooked beef, then returning beef to the stew later. I hesitate to cook the potatos/carrots separately as you need the starch from them to naturally thicken the stew. Anyway, I am not deterred - I will definitely be making this again because it's so good!

I don't understand . . . at what point do you add the potatoes and carrots? After straining the stew and allowing the liquid to sit for 10 minutes - then what? The recipe does not say to add the liquid back ....? Confusing.

I'm giving this 4 stars based on family consensus. Frigid weather this year in New Jersey has me turning to comfort foods and the economy has me minding my budget so I've been in search of a good beef stew recipe. I previously tried the Beef Bourguinon recipe from this site, but the kids gave it a thumbs down. I tried this recipe armed with that experience plus the wise counsel of previous reviewers. So.... I floured the beef before browning, used a little more red wine and beef broth than the recipe called for, cooked the carrots and potatoes w/o the already tender beef and re-introduced the beef plus some pearl onions and frozen peas towards the very end of cooking. Result: Perfection and a happy family. I served the stew over egg noodles, but they almost seemed extraneous. Still, the kids enjoyed the noodles. Since this recipe is not that dissimilar from the Beef Borguinon recipe, I have to chalk the success up to the addition of the balsamic and tomato paste. Those additions really add a whole new level of flavor. Finally, it is essential to begin this recipe the DAY BEFORE you plan to serve it. First, so that you don't feel rushed trying to get this meal on the table and second to allow the flavors develop. With temps still near zero here, I am really looking forward to making this recipe again!

I've made this recipe twice now and the taste is great, but I have one issue - appearance. After 2-1/2 hours braising, the beef is so tender that when you enter the vegetable cooking step (even though I use a very large kettle), the stirring of the carrots and potatoes causes most all of the beef pieces to shred into strands of beef. This doesn't change the flavor, but it makes for an unappetizing appearance. Perhaps one could cook the vegetables only in the braising liquid, not adding back the beef until they are done. Aside from this, the receipe is also a lot of trouble, though not difficult. For taste, ease of prep and appearance, I think I much prefer Mahogany Beef Stew, a great recipe on this site.

I went real easy on the wine and balsamic, floured and seasoned the beef before browning, and used a mushroom soup broth base(sold in jars) for the liquid and added a couple parsnips and a small can of diced tomatoes.

I thought this stew had very good flavor. It is a time-consuming recipe, so while I will make again (for our Super Bowl party), I probably won't make it often. I braised the beef in my crockpot instead of the oven, and like some of the other reviewers the stew did not thicken up. More like soup. The chuck roast I had on hand had bones, so I cubed what I could, and braised the rest whole. I pulled the meat from the bones when I pulled out the braised veggies. Served with biscuits.

I had this as a guest at a friend's and it was so fabulous. My husband and I thought we had a top winner with Tyler Florence's "ultimate beef stew" on Food Network, and that is a winner, but this is even better with the addition of the tomato paste and balsamic. When I go to make it though, I will definitely incorporate Tyler's frozen pearl onions (so easy and tasty) and maybe his mushrooms and frozen peas. Mostly, check out his horseradish sour cream garnish which is so easy and an incredibly delicious addition despite its simplicity. It adds another dimension and really rounds out the flavors. His suggestion of toasted peasant bread rubbed with garlic is similarly simple and great. A yummy dipper for the sauce.

Phenomenal results. I floured the beef before browning it and I also cooked it a lot longer - in the end about 5 hours. I didn't see the need to take the vegetables out, they kind of vanished into the broth after so many hours of braising. The result was beautifully tender meat and a really delicious broth. Definitely a keeper.

Don't waste those braised veggies and heard lots of people did not have enough broth for next step! Thanks for the heads up.

An additional note to what I'd written before. Meat was already so tender I left it in colander and cooked the potato wedges and carrots in the juice. I also added a cup more beef broth, and that covered the vegetables. The discarded carrots used in the braising are also FANTASTIC to eat by themselves! sue

This is one of the best beef stews I have made. I made this in the slow cooker, and added small bag of frozen peas in the last hour. Needs thickening at end as well when using slow cooker. I also added parsnips with the carrots and potatoes that I layer at bottom of slow cooker, top with browned beef, then pour in liquid as prepared in recipe.

This is a classic stew. I did increase the liquid to keep it from drying out, but this one is a definite keeper.

Really delicious. I recommend closer to 4 pounds of meat, and it should not look fatty. It's important to follow all the steps. In order to cook the potatoes, you need to leave the meat out for that step! (Or find another way to cook the potatoes.) I even added a bit more beef broth to the liquid and left the potatoes on the stove almost an hour to get them to cook. (My liquid cooled very quickly.) I added some beef broth to the meat while it sat that step out.

My pot is currently on the last step of the recipe (simmer 40 min.), so I can't report on the finished dish, but I do have a comment for people who are having trouble getting enough cooking liquid to accommodate the carrots and potatoes. After removing the solids and incorporating the carrots and potatoes, I too found that there wasn't enough liquid in the pot to cover the new additions. I went back to the colander of "solids" and pressed the mixture with the back of a spoon. This yielded perhaps as much as 2 cups of additional liquid, which was enough to "submerge" the carrots and potatoes appropriately. I'll let the stew rest for a day or two as recommended by other reviewers and then report back.

Made this delicious recipe on New Years Day for my family with lots of teens. Served over egg noodles and with a baguette....it was a hit with everyone! After following recipe and taking stew out of oven and straining, it appeared there would not be enough broth to cook the veggies, so I added some beef broth and water, and cooked veggies before adding meat back in. Broth was a bit too thin then so I put the strained and saved celery, onions etc. in food processor with some broth and pureed, and then added back in to the stew to thicken....yummy! You could also use to spread on the baguette.

Yes! Wonderful flavor to this stew. I skipped the wine, added Braggs Amino Acids for a little flavor, and didn't need to salt it (though I did a smidge). I also skipped the onion because I was out (I had maybe 1/4 cup minced in the fridge that I threw in.) I used a "charcoal steak" for the meat, a cheap cut they sell in my area that is roast meat cut thin. Perfect! So tender. I also only used 3 lb of meat - since that's what I had. Plenty. I made homemade vegetable stock from veggie ends I accumulate in the freezer for stock, so I didn't really measure my liquids. I also cut off any fatty pieces of meat and cooked them separately in the veggie stock pot so I could get the flavor but pour off the grease before adding to the stew - and not have any gristle in the stew. I Never would have discarded the vegetables as mentioned except so many reviews said it was worth doing. Yes indeed! Instead of mush, this was a very flavorful stew with nice texture - tender meat, thick gravy, and perfectly done potatoes and carrots. (Since I skipped the onion, I gave the veggie mush goodness to the dogs instead of tossing it out. They were very happy.) I am saving this recipe for my standard stew recipe.

The Best!!! Be sure to use good balsamic vinegar--it does make a difference. I used Malbec wine. Didn't add extra salt(unusual for me) and prepared just as recipe called for. Removing the solids took a few extra mins---but well worth it. I have made several of the other stews listed on this site-- this one by far is the richest-even the first night. It deserves a great bottle of wine and wonderful bread. Save the solids to smear on the bread (while you are finishing the stew) as a treat to you- the cook!

My family loved this stew and my husband would like to try it made with buffalo in the future. Of course I used salt; it was called for in the recipe. This recipe will replace my old one. Instead of the oven, I made mine in a slow cooker which worked very well. I discarded nothing as that was unnecessary using the slow cooker. The first round of vegetables did not taste "cooked out". I added the main veg about half way through the cooking. When the meat was very tender, I found that the liquid needed some thickening so I sucked about half of it out of the crock with a baster, thickened it with a bit of corn starch in a small saucepan on the stove, and then mixed it back into the stew before serving it. Arrowroot would work too I suppose. Old vine zinfandel worked well for the wine. I think that browning the vegetables was indeed the special touch that gave this stew that deep, umami-enriched flavor. I used bacon fat, instead of olive oil, for browning btw and that also helped.

Rating: 4
This is a good, simple stew. The balsamic gives it special flavor. Separating out the cooking vegetables from the meat is a bit tedious but only takes five minutes and is worth the effort. Like most stews, proportions can be adjusted to your own taste and ingedients on hand. And definitely let it age for two days.

To mdexter1: The problem, as A Cook from Louisville notes, is that, aside from salting the beef, the recipe calls for no salt. Salting generously while braising will give excellent results both immediately and the next day. Stewing the vegetables late in the process is a terrific idea, but 40 minutes for the carrots is still a little long; I wouldn't go longer than 20. But with these few adjustments, this is a fantastic winter stew.

When I served this to guests (the day after making it), it was decidedly mediocre. It had basically no flavor whatsoever. My friend suggested maybe some wine might have helped, and when I told her it had an entire bottle in it already, we both had a good laugh. Two days later, we hauled out the leftovers, and it was far and away the best stew I've ever made. Plan accordingly.
