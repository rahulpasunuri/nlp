They are fun to make and eat. Easy enough that my 10-year-old daughter made a couple of batches herself.

I used large pretzel sticks and large marshmallows. nestles white choc chips and about tblsp oil...came out great. going to try small sticks and small marshmallows next ,but this was easy.

Sadly my worst experience with an Epicurious recipe. Not attractive or realistic.

I used bulk white chocolate chips from a health food store and microwaved the chocolate. Maybe it was the chocolate's fault, but I found it incredibly difficult to dip in and remove the "bones." The marshmallows fell off when I'd lift out the bones with a fork, and/or it just wouldn't look good, and the chocolate was not dripping at all, as the recipe suggests. I gave up. Maybe another type of chocolate would have worked better.

Very easy receipe, simple to do with children and fast. I used it as a loot bag for school and it was a big hit. I took the advice of another user and added vegtable oil into the chocolate to make it easier to use.

Not as easy to make as one may think. As other reviewers suggested.....using a fork is the key! I also needed to add a little shortening. I had used nestle white choc chips.....that may have been why. Tasty and cute.

I made these for a potluck pre halloween pumpkin carving party. They were a big hit. People said that from across the room they looked like a platter full of bones. Adults thought they looked great and children thought they looked just scary enough to eat. Plus they tasted good too. Oh, and I microwaved the chocolate to make it easier.

Super cute! Be sure to use the thin pretzels and mini marshmallows. They also happen to taste good....sweet, salty, crunchy, chewy!

I just dipped the pretzels in the white chocolate, I didn't want to dip the marshmallows in the chocolate or else the marshmallows will melt and turn out into a mess. I also added some vegetable oil to the melting chocolate so it could be manageable; recipe turned out good.

its yummy, but i felt this recipe was not detailed enough about the ingredients: (i have a picture on my site tagged as funny bones: sweetalkcupcake.blogspot.com ) 1. you must: use the tiny, thin pretzel rods (not the thick ones, as attempt 1 taught me) and use nestle white chocolate chips (as attempt 2 taught me, not white chocolate chunks) and use tiny marshmallows (as attempt 3 taught me) to do about 90 rods, it took less than one bag of pretzels, less than one bag of marshmallows and two bags of white chocolate chips! 2. lay out one plate to put the pre dipped pretzel rods and lay out saran wrap to place the dipped rods onto 3. Smush marshmallows onto pretzel rods, it doesnt matter if they look crinkly, they will be coated in white chocolate and probably will bounce back after you set them down anyways. pile them onto your pre dipping plate 4. melt 1/3rd of the white chocolate chips for 20 second intervals until melted, taking out and stirring between 20 seconds- this takes about 1 minute total microwave time. 5. throw in about 6 pretzel/ marshmallow rods into your melted white chocolate bowl at a time- fish them out with a fork and set them on the saran wrap. 6. repeat step 5 until you are done!

These were easy to make and a big hit at my son's school party! I used a SS bowl on an appropriately sized pot, as I don't have a double boiler. Also used 50/50 white chocolate chips and almond bark to reduce the cost.

chocolate and pretzels always taste good together, but it was impossible to get the marshmallows to stick on the ends of the pretzels in any way to look like a bone. Without "spearing" them, they just fell off, either as we tried to make them stick, or in the chocolate. We tried several methods, and the kids gave up, and I finally gave up as well.

I made these for a post-game (pre-Halloween) soccer team snack. Huge hit with the kids even though they didn't look as nice as the picture.

Okay, so here's the thing about this recipe guys. I just finished making them and they came out great, but only after one or two modifications and test runs. First of all, snap pretzel sticks in half. Do not try to use them without doing so, it's much harder to dip and they really look better shorter. Second, when putting marshmallows on the ends, it's okay to push them all the way through, they don't have to be right on the tips, trust me it does not make a difference in the presentation&this way they wont fall off. Third, I don't know what kind of chocolate the person was using who said they didn't need to add any oil to it when melting chips in the microwave, because you definitely have to add a bit of Crisco, BUT ONLY A BIT. Example - 1/2 bag of chips, ½ teaspoon or so of Crisco. This gives is a consistency that allows you to dip the pretzels  its almost like a nacho cheese dip consistency. Last piece of advise, I used a fork for the entire process. You must use a small bowl when melting the chips in order to create enough of a "pool" to dip the pretzels in. I happen to have a metal fork that is larger than a regular fork. Now here's the secret, once you melt the chips in the small bowl tilt the bowl toward you so the melted chips form a larger "pool"....ONE BY ONE...put pretzels in and use your fork to sort of twirl the pretzel around the chocolate and the chocolate around the pretzel then simply use your fork to lift it out (have the pretzel stick go between the prongs), let it drip slightly (and it will only be slightly cause the chocolate is pretty thick) then place it on the wax paper. The first couple of times you need to get the hang of it, but once you do, it really is pretty easy. And if the marshmallow is melting in the chocolate you've done one of two things wrong. You made the chocolate too hot or you've dipped it for two long.

PS Had my sons kindergarten Halloween parade/party today. Everyone raved about the bones. Not only did the taste great, but they looked great too. I piled them up in a Halloween container& it was awesome.

I HAD TO SUBMIT THIS IN PARTS This gives is a consistency that allows you to dip the pretzels  its almost like a nacho cheese dip consistency. Last piece of advise, I didn't have to get my hands dirty for this at all, except when adding the marshmallows to the pretzels. I used a fork for the entire process. You must use a small bowl when melting the chips in order to create enough of a "pool" to dip the pretzels in. I happen to have a metal fork that is larger than a regular fork. Not that a regular fork wouldn't work, but the larger fork for me made it easy to handle. Now here's the secret, once you melt the chips in the small bowl, sit at your table and tilt the bowl toward you so the melted chips form a larger "pool"....ONE BY ONE...put pretzels in and use your fork to sort of twirl the pretzel around the chocolate and the chocolate around the pretzel (sounds weird but imagine someone running on a log, and the log goes around and around)..that is what you want to do, then you simply use your fork to lift it out (have the pretzel stick go between the prongs), let it drip slightly (and it will only be slightly cause the chocolate is pretty thick) then place it on the wax paper. The first couple of times you need to get the hang of it, but once you do, it really is pretty easy. And if the marshmallow is melting in the chocolate you've done one of two things wrong.

After reading the reviews, I was really nervous to try this, but decided to risk it. It turned out perfectly! I did not have a single problem, the "bones" are adorable, and really yummy. It doesn't get any easier than this recipe.

these are very cute, but not that easy to make. the chocolate was a bit of a bother (just make sure not to make it too hot). i ended up adding some canola oil to the chocolate to make it spread easier. the ones that worked were very cute and yummy though

This may look good on paper, but it was not at all easy to execute successfully. It was a huge mess with sticky marshmallow fingers and drippy chocolate. The marshmallows don't stick to the pretzels when they get warm, and the white "chocolate" doesn't melt well. Don't bother with this one.

Do you bunch several marshmallows on each end? I was surprised it calls for mini marshmallows instead of the large ones.

Loved this! Very easy, whipped 50 of them out in a half hour. Contrary to what some say, they were very simple to make. I recommend using "fresh" marshmallows, and quality pretzels. Don't use cheep ones or they will probably break. I melted the chocolate in the micro just till soft,(follow the melting instructions on the back of the chip package) adding a spoon of crisco. I also broke the ends of the pretzels to make them a bit shorter, slipped the little mallo's on, plunged them into the chocolate, fished them out with a fork, let them drip for a moment, put them on a non stick cookie sheet, then put them in the fridge for a minute. Voila! Bones for the tops of my cupcakes. I did have to clean then up a bit after they had dried but just slightly. The more chocolate you let drip off the less you have to break off the bones when they've cooled. UI placed them on a chocolate frosted cupcake, with a "Fudgy" Brand cookie in the background. They looked like little toomstones with a bone sticking out. Hit at my party.

This is a fun and easy little Halloween treat. I'm not sure why so many people had so much trouble with it- I just smooshed the marshmallows onto the pretzel sticks and followed the microwave melting instructions on the bag of white chocolate chips. I didn't add any shortening or anything else and my little bones came out great!

This took several trial runs but once I figured out the system it went really quick and easy! I did not have the trouble of marshmallows falling off like other reviewers. I did add some canola oil once the chocolate got too thick. I will diffidently be making these again next Halloween!

I just tried to make these and I messed up the white chocolate. I don't have a double boiler so I just put them in the microwave. Apparently if you heat the 'white morsels' too long they just turn into a paste. Next time I'll read the directions on the package instead of just winging it. I ended up using semi-sweet chocolate chips. Not bad, would have been better with the white chocolate though!

Whoever wrote this recipe obviously didn't try it first! It is IMPOSSIBLE to "stick" a marshmallow on the end of a pretzel! However, after reading some user comments, I did the following: 1) dipped one end of the pretzel at a time and stuck the marshmallows to the ends. 2) After the two time end-dipping process I dipped the whole thing. 3) ABSLOUTELY add shortening to the chips for 2 minutes of melting in the microwave, and it was perfect. No double boiler needed and I used the national brand of chips that we all know. Lastly, they do not look nearly as good as the picture ( how did they get them to look that great??) but these are for my 9 year olds class party so it doesn't matter too much.

i've made these three times now, and they get better each time! i did the recipe exactly as instructed and used regular old chips. only a couple marshmallows fell off, so i tried to spear them so the pretzels were sticking through a tiny bit. then, i just dropped the "bones" in, one at a time, and very gently rolled them over the surface of the chocolate with a fork to pick up just enough coating. don't leave them in too long, or the marshmallow will melt. and when you scoop them up on the fork, don't rap it too hard to shake off the excess chocolate, i snapped a lot of pretzels that way! all in all, if you're looking for perfection, i'd recommend making a bunch extra, since you will have rejects, or just serve 'em all and tell your guests the weird ones are from mutant skeletons! ;) either way, they're cute, easy, and delicious!

So many reviewers had a bad experience with this I almost didn't try it. I did it anyway and my bones turned out really cute and took very little time. So, here's what I did -- maybe it will help. I thought the pretzel sticks were too long, so I broke them off a little. The jagged edge sticks into the marshmallow very easily, so I broke a little off each end of the pretzel. I used cheap almond bark candy coating which I melted in a square dish in the microwave with a little Crisco. I used the entire package, put several pretzels in a a time and spooned the coating over. When you dip them and transfer them to the waxed paper, they're not going to look like the bones in the picture. Instead of wasting time double-dipping them, I dipped all the pretzels then spooned the remaining coating on them after they had firmed up a little. I think using the candy coating instead of white chocolate chips was the trick.

TERRIBLE - DOESN'T WORK AT ALL! I just wasted two very expensive bags of Ghiradelli chocolate chips, and it was a huge mess that took alot of time. After putting all the marshmallows on the pretzels and melting the chocolate, when I went to dip the pretzels, there is no way to smooth and coat chocolate evenly (I tried a fork, a spoon, a brush, and my fingers). It was a sticky nightmare and not worth the trouble . I also tried the trick of using oil, as somebody suggested, which was the final straw, as it turned the chocolate into a thick unmanageable paste.

I tried 3 different bags of white chocolate and had to throw out all of it. Not worth the aggravation. Can't get the chocolate to be runny enough for dipping, marshmallows fall off. Very frustrating. What is the trick? The recipe made it sound sooo easy but there has to be a trick that was left out.

Marshmallows... falling... off...into...chocolate!!! I decided to glue the marshmallows onto the pretzel rods with the melted white chocolate. Once the chocolate had hardened, the marshmallows stayed on the pretzel through the dipping process. National name brand white chocolate chips melted just fine. Although, in the past I have had some bad experiences.

these are really cute if you: 1. use 2 pretzel rods per bone 2. double dip in high quality chocolate i just made almost 900 of these bones at work!

How in the world do you "just stick" the marshmallow onto the end of the pretzel? And how do you use the fork to dip it into the chocolate? You can't jab the pretzel so I am assuming you jab the marshmallow. ??

As a father and chocolate lover (along with my chef/wife), make sure the pretzels are salted! White chocolate and salt are a combination that is to be cherished as well as addictive. Along with salted popcorn, this is a household favorite to be sure!
