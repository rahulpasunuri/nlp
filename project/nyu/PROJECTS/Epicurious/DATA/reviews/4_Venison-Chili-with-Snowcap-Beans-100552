very very good! I love making this when my husband brings home venison. I usually use great northern beans (canned) as it saves a lot of time and I don't really see any difference in flavor. I have tended to use canned chipotle chilies and sauce as well when ancho chiles are hard to find. Good any way!

Don't skimp on the chile mixture..it is needed.. I left in several seeds and also added cayenne pepper - 1/4 tsp. Used black beans and doubled the cumin. Also added 2 squares of 70% dark chocolate in addition to the 2 Tb. of raw sugar. It is very flavorful...next time I'll skip the vension and use buffalo.

I made to many changes to review as written, but the overall dish was delish! As hard as it is to get venison in Cleveland, I wouldn't hesitate to make this again if I didn't have the meat for grilled venison steaks!

Tastes great! I made this work with my limited access to food and kitchen tools, so a lot changed, but it still tasted good. (1) used lamb shoulder instead of venison. (2) used four fresh poblano chilies instead of dried anchos, and blended them with half as much water as the recipe calls for; I only ended up using about half the mixture in the dish -- end result was flavorful, but not spicy, so I could have used more. (3) Used a mixture of pinto, black, and red kidney beans instead of the snowcaps. (4) Didn't have a way to float the spices in the beans, so I put in about two tablespoons of coriander powder instead of the whole seeds, and just fished the garlic cloves and bay leaf out after cooking. (5) Added four stalks of celery to the bell pepper mixture. (6) Cooked the final product in a wok because it was the only thing I had that was big enough. (7) Right before putting the tomatoes into the meat, I poured the mostly-cooked beans back in and cooked everything together for the last 1.5 hours; only added a bit of water (no where near three cups); didn't put any sugar in.

GREAT recipe - I make this four or five times every winter. It does lend itself to experimenting. I've made it with venison and buffalo, which are BEST, but beef sirloin is also good. (Don't even try ground turkey.) Kielbasa stands in well for the sausage.

Very good Chili, even if I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Venison is hard to come by here, so when ltd edition venison sausages came up, I picked them up, and found this recipe. So I reversed things, using venison sausage and diced Pork shoulder. Also substituted black eyed beans as I can't find snowcaps, and used a mix of Anchos, Habanero, Pasilla, and Guajilla. And I finished the chili with Heston Blumenthal's recipe for chili butter. I don't think that's online anymore, but his new book should be out soon with it.

Excellent - full of flavor. My modifications: only 1 1b venison/sausage combination, used dried pinto and kidney beans, 4 t ancho chili powder instead of dried + H20, doubled cumin, half sugar, 3/4 T salt, no added water - used juice from canned tomatoes. Didn't use masa harina and wish I had - would like a little substance to the liquid. Even with my proportions, I still wished there were more beans. Don't skip on seasoning the beans as directed - they are worth making on their own!

I had fresh, ground venison from a neighbor, so used that with a package of sweet italian sausage (took sausages out of their casings and broke the meat up with a fork while cooking). Used canned black beans (sorry), and no thickening agent--it was the perfect consistency after cooking for 1 1/2 hours. I felt it needed more "heat," so I served it with garlic chili paste--oh so yummy! It's about 5 degrees in Chicago today and this is the perfect warmer-up!

Wow, this was really good chili. OK, no snowcap beans--I cheated and used canned black beans. Also felt it needed lots more heat, so I served it with a side of chili garlic paste (thai) and that did the trick. I had fresh ground venison from a neighbor, so I did it that way, not chunks. I'm having a bowl of leftovers as I type--it's so yummy!

Excellent. I used Maple smoked sausage and chili beans. The dried chilis are key. A real hit with people who "think" they don't like venison!

I've been converted to dried anchos! Wow! No more chili powder for me. Pork sausage, coriander and masa harina I didn't use. Snow caps? Not found in the Mid West... substitute chili beans. I used the rest of the ingredients, doubling the cumin. Good recipe, already made it twice.

Like everyone else, could not locate the beans and went with both kindney and pinto beans, which added a nice color to the presentation. Since the seasoning of the beans was skipped, I added crushed corriander to the meat before browning. It was fantastic! I'll never use powder chili sauce again!

This is an ok base recipe for venison chili, but needs alot of adjustment. I used about two pounds of venison roast, but still used two 16oz cans of red kidney beans. The bean/vension ratio of this recipe is way off or maybe I just like beans? I used ancho chili powder instead of the dried poblanos. Basically, it is the same thing but easier to find and saves times. I never needed the masa harina. In fact, it was too thick. I added some beef stock to give it a better consistency. Canned crushed tomatoes are fine and saves time/mess. Also, don't be stingy on the cumin. It adds a unique flavor that I loved.

My family loved this recipe. I was unable to get the snowcap beans so I used White Northern Beans (I think they are white kidney beans). I also was unable to find dried ancho Chilies so I bought something called Chili Ancho. Its Ancho chili mix I found in the Mexican Isle at the supermarket. It is mild so I added a tsp of chili powder and a half a tsp of cayenne. I only had 2lbs of venision but it made no difference. When I put all the meat into the pot to brown I realized it was too much meat and the meat was going to stew instead of brown so I took it all out and browned it in small batches. I found out later that ancho chili's are dried poblano peppers if that helps anyone else.

If you want to spend a week cooking this, follow the recipe. Otherwise, you can cook like normal people and use prepared beans, and don't worry about reconstituting dried peppers, etc. I used Jimmy Dean maple sausage (1 lb.), about a pound of venison, and added twice the amount of beans the recipe calls for. It was great! The recipe calls for too much meat and not enough beans, it's much better to wing this one. The coriander makes it...

I used top round beef, mild pork sausage and pinto beans. The pureed chiles gave the dish a nice color and the right amount of heat without imparting the usual chili powder flavor. The rest of the spices combined to created a hearty, but not overly spicy dish. The chili was a hit at my Super Bowl party.
