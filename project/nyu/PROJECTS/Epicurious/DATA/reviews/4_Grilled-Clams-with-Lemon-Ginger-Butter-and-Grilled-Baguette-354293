This is a beautiful recipe! The ease of prepartion is amazing. Your guests will think you labored all day long! I actually forgot to add the lemon, and it was still delicious, not sure I would add it when making next time it was so good. I served this as a first course, and my guests were blown away! I did add a splash of white wine to the clams prior to putting on the BBQ. The clams I got were a bit small, make sure you get good sized clams. Next time I will add mussells to the recipe. Also, the butter mixture is GREAT, I would make a little extra to add to the pan juices...great to have a little extra broth for dipping the bread.

heaven. follow the recipe, but up the ginger a bit. and ignore the reviewer who says to use unsalted butter - use salted, but don't add additional salt. also, we used littlenecks instead of manilas, which were perfect.

Love this recipe! I have made it several times and always get rave reviews. On one occasion I made the mistake of using salted butter, which made it way too salty. I also avoid using New Zealand clams as I find them to be very salty as well. Great with mussels and any other kind of clam. A great recipe!

Delicious! I agree that this would impress company, and I'd make it all the time for myself if clams were cheaper. I followed the recipe except for two things: I added a splash of white wine (Sauvignon Blanc) to the juices at the end, and I soaked the clams in water and cornmeal before cooking (as recommended in another Epicurious recipe). The bread was great, especially when browned on one side.

It was good, but not enough flavor. It needs about 4 x times the ginger and maybe another flavor too.

We've made this over & over this summer to rave reviews. We used half mussels and half clams.

I just wrote the previous review, but wanted to mention that if you were entertaining, this would knock your guests' socks off!

My husband and I thought this was a great recipe. The lemon and ginger go so well together. It was easy to make too. I used an entire baguette for the grilled bread and still had just enough butter mixture for the clams. However, we probably would have made a little more butter mixture than what they suggest.

I made this with mussels a few weeks ago, and am prepping for another round tonight. It was fantastic, I can't imagine how it could be anything less! I cut a baguette in quarters lengthwise instead of slicing, much easier on the grill. Also skipped the 'disposable' pan and used a roasting pan (less waste vs. less cleanup).

I made this recipe as written and can honestly say I don't know what the hype is about. The sauce was simple, but tasted simple. the clams were cooked perfectly, but just tasted so-so. Overall, way too expensive for tasting so underwhelming

Made this last week for the family who raved about it. Only change I will make next time is to just add a dash of white wine in the butter mix and steam the clams and butter mix all together at once. Fantastic sauce for dipping thick bread into

We live in the Midwest, so our seafood selection is pretty pathetic. I was forced to use larger clams than what the recipe calls for, and I was not pleased with how they turned out. However, the butter sauce was fantastic and I will definitely try this recipe again with smaller clams if I can find them.

WOW -- made this a few Saturdays ago and loved it! It's quick, easy and elegant; my kind of recipe!

Fantastic and easy, easy, easy! Watch the clams, tiny manilas were open and still juicy at 5 minutes. I nested a little cooked linguine in the shallow bowls, made a circle of steamed crisp broccolini around the nest of pasta, topped with the grilled clams. Added a 1/2 cup of white wine to the melted butter/clam juices to create a little more broth and poured it on top. Perfect meal and super beautiful/impressive on the table!

WOW. This was incredibly easy to prepare, came together in no time, and was delicious. What more could you ask for? It tasted sophisticated, and is a perfect summer date night recipe. I will make this again and again, and I think it will be good with mussels, shrimp, shitakes, etc.

This was AMAZING. Simple and full of complex tastes. Served it with a tomato/bufala mozzarella salad, but it's a meal on it's own.
