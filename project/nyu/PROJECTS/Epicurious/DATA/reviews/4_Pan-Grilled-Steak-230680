Great easy recipe. I can grill year round in Southern CA, but it is much easier on a dark January night to put the steaks in the pan. I used Trader Joe's Top Sirloin steaks. Letting them sit at room temp for 40 min, then marinating as in recipe for 30 min allowed them to cook evenly throughout. Delicious!!

This is our favourite way to cook steak - we keep going back to it all the time, after trying different methods. The salt melts and roasts onto the meat and enhances the taste so nicely.

This is by far the easiest way to cook a steak and have it turn out beautifully moist. I don't even bother to BBQ my steaks anymore; this is just as good.

This is a simple way to prepare steaks without using the bbq. I use a grill pan and get the right "doneness" every time.
