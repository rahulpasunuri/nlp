Thought this was decent but not good enough to make again. The "sauce" is more of a topping as shown in the picture. Added some red pepper flakes but not enough probably. Adding capers and olives might help perk the sauce up.

As mentioned by other reviewers, easy and forgiving recipe. I changed the tomatoes to grape (halved, did not peel), added a splash of white wine to the mix at the end and omitted the parsley - delicious.

Easy and flavorful. I suggest this to anyone who likes tuna and fresh tomato-basil flavor of the Mediterranean. I served this with Redwood creek Sauvignon Blanc (2006) and everyone was very pleased.

Very easy to make and very forgiving. I added mushrooms and used rosemary instead of basil as that was the fresh herb I had at hand. The result was an incredibly fresh-tasting sauce.

This was awesome! Made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Use peeled canned toms. WAAAY easier.

This is a delicious and simple preparation. If it weren't for peeling the tomatoes, it would be effortless.

Excellent dish. Added a bit of crushed red pepper, but other than that, made exactly as suggested. Don't cook tnua more than 2 minutes per side, otherwise you'll end up with Chicken of the Sea. Served with pasta w/ garlic and olive oil. Great combo.

Great dish! The sauce realy keeps the tuna moist. I've already given the recipe to other people. i'll definitely be maiking this dish again.

I thought this was simple and that cheating with canned diced tomatoes worked fine. I added some red pepper flakes and I think that the addition of capers at the end with the basil might perk up the sauce nicely. I added a little lemon to the tuna with the salt and pepper before cooking.

Seems very easy and quick for someone that is very busy and don't have much time.

This is an aromatic and chunky sauce, very tasty but heavier than we expected and not at all like a marinara.

Excellent and easy to make. I like fish but usually don't have much luck making it at home - this is a keeper.

Loved this recipe - didn't have fresh or dried parsley - used approx 1 tsp of herbs de Provence. Tuna in fridge all night to thaw but was still a little frozen so basted the tuna while searing it with left over sauce from PASTA SALAD WITH TOMATOES AND PEAS recipe I had made previous evening. Wonderful - can't wait to make it for company!!!!

Excellent! I had a piece of tuna that turned out to be not as fresh as I would like, so I was looking for a way that I could cook it well done. I also wanted a recipe with ingredients I already had in the house .... it was a spur of the moment thing. Using a half recipe, I made this as a simple supper for my husband and myself, accompanied by a hunk of French bread from the freezer and robust olive oil seasoned with basil, garlic, and crushed red pepper for dipping. It was a very easy meal, well balanced, interesting, and quite tasty. I will certainly make it again.

I first made this dish about 5 years ago. As someone who loves to grill, I made a very hot fire and seared the tuna on the grill (2 minutes per side). The result was fantastic. The taste of the grill mixed in incredibly well with the sauce. My guest are still talking about it and asking me to make it again.

This was my first time making fresh tuna and it was a great success. I seared the tuna on the grill after brushing it with olive oil and garlic. The tomatoes basil sauce was delicious.

Easy and quick to prepare. We loved it and I added a little bit of Kalamata olives.

I have served this several times to guests and always get rave reviews. Sear the tuna in a very hot barely greased pan as an alternate to grilling.

This was easy to make, and pretty tasty. It was a little on the bland side, though - next time I'd maybe add a little more garlic (maybe two cloves) and a little more salt & pepper. I served this with a side of long grain & wild rice, which complemented it well. As a side note, in preparation for skinning the tomatoes (I used 6 vine-ripened), I parboiled them a little extra time - this helped reduce the cooking time for the sauce after the tomatoes were added. The sweetness of the vine-ripened tomatoes really made the sauce terrific. This even got a thumbs-up from my husband to make again, and he doesn't usually like fish!

Excellent dish--especially in summer with home-grown tomatoes and basil. Very quick and easy to prepare.

Delicious. Quick, easy to prepare. It would wow guests. Not much liquid in the sauce but that was ok.

Easy, healthy, and tasty. Very quick to prepare. And, using frozen tuna steaks from Trader Joes, quite inexpensive too! I will make this again, and would make it for company as well.
