Good taste but very liquid-like,almost like syrup. Used in yogurt or over pancakes, but not as marmalage.

very dissappointed - found the flavors didn't blend, and was very liquid. So many better things to do with strawberries.

Excellent flavors. I added a few pears to the strawberries which further increased the flavors. Everyone who had it loved it!

I found this recipe too sweet. If I tried it again I would add half the amount of sugar. it might have been the brand of marmalade I used which was sweet and not as tart as usual.

Hi Kacky, you might store it in a sterile glass jar with a lid, keep refrigerated. Should use within a week and half.

Question - how would you store this? How long will it stay fresh?

This was absolutely delicious. Added a splash of Grand Marnier. Also, double or triple the recipe as it is so good.
