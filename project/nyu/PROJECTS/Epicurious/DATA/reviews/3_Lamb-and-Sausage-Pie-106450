Re: People thinking it's bland, two tips: One, make sure you salted the lamb before you start to cook it, and make sure it goes in a screaming hot pan and gets really brown. Brown = flavor. That's a given. Two, I changed up the spices. I omitted the sausage (I'm sort of a lamb purest), and for herbs I used fresh thyme, sage, and maybe 1/4 tsp of grated lemon rind. At the very end, I threw in chopped chives. I guess that's pretty much rewriting the recipe, but I liked that combination of spices with the white wine.

I forgot to add how I spruce this up to make it a bit better. I do not take the lamb out of the pan, i cook it with the onions and wine and simmer it until it's tender, usually around 45 minutes, otherwise I find the lamb is not tender inside. Also, I add feta when I add the chorizo, cuz I think a little bit of cheese makes everything better. The crust is beautiful and although the recipe doesn't give instructions to decorate as it shows in the pic, I make it as close as I can and it looks and tastes great.

We love this dish, love the look and love the taste. A great idea for company dinners.

Nice dish, but crust was odd. I used lard but was not flaky. Next time I'll just use a short pastry (quiche) crust. Make sure that you buy Spanish sobrasada and NOT soprasada (Italian). The later is more like a salami and the 1st is like a spread that "melts" into the filling. Can make a huge difference.

Easy to make and wonderful to eat. My whole family fell in love with this dish and it is fun to make with someone else.

Ick. The pie was beautiful, but the flavors were bland and strange. Made it for friends and everyone disliked it except for the pie crust.

My husband and I enjoyed the whole picnic menu that was featured in the May magazine. I am planning to fix it again next week because we are still having beautiful weather in late October. Even people who think they do not like lamb might like this dish.

I used chorizo sausage instead of sobrasada with very good results, but over-all this dish was a bit bland- it needs an herb or something. the crust, however, was surprisingly easy and flakey.
