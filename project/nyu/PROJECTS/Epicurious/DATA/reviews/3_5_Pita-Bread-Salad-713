I'd give this more like 2.5 forks... it was pretty good, but not really outstanding. I served it to a Lebanese friend for dinner and he explained that you really need the sumac to make this authentic. I might try it again but only with that added. I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and marinated the salad (without the lettuce or croutons) overnight, which I think helped blend the flavors. Note that this is garlicky although the parsley helps offset that. The best part of the salad were the pita croutons for sure!

This is an awesome recipe. I added feta cheese and it was overwhelmingly good. It's really nice that the recipe does not really have a dressing because it lets you enjoy the fresh taste of the vegetables.

This dish tastes even better if the vegetables marinate overnight.

I make this salad, but I learned how to make this from a Middle Eastern person. There are a few secrets to making this salad perfectly. This recipe is lacking a few key details. Tomatoes are always in the salad, and are usually Roma or Plum tomatoes. The Cucumbers are always seedless cucumbers. Personally, I don't like the mint so I don't use it. Green Pepper is also optional. I have seen radishes used a lot. There is a spice which they add, and it gives the salad a distinct flavor. In Arabic it is called Sumac. No it is not poison sumac. The C is silent. It is quite inexpensive and available at an Arabic market. Sprinkle it on the salad liberally. The Sumac has a slight bitter taste to it, and is very good. It is also used in Arabic shish kebab marinades and other things.
