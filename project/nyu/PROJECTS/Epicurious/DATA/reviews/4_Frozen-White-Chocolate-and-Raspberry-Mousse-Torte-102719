I make this recipe every year at Christmas time. It is truly decadent. It is a bit time consuming and you need to make sure to get your groceries ahead of time. This year I was going to make it for a Christmas party and by the time I was able to get away to get groceries the liquor store was closed, and the grocery store I go to didn't carry the hydrox crumbs. So plan ahead. Instead of making the chocolate curls, I just put chocolate shavings on top. My whole family LOVES this recipe and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews at parties!

Amazing and easy. Followed others advice and cut the crust ingredients in half. Couldn't find chocolate wafers so used digestives with 2 spoons of cocoa. Also doubled the gelatin and only refrigerated it but did not add the powdered sugar (would have been much too sweet with it). All in all a huge success!

This was really delicious! I made it in six 4" springform pans; because it is frozen, not baked I didn't have to worry about timing. I decorated it with whipped cream, raspberries and crumbled some of the crust which I had reserved over top. The mousse itself before freezing was amazing too. Anything which tastes and looks this fabulous and can be made ahead is a winner to me! Loved this.

So I made an epicurious acct to review this cake...I've been using this site for years.... Easiest cake ever. Its not hard at all. Why would anyone say that? Here's is how I whipped up this masterpiece. While the gelatin was sitting in the pan doing its own thing, I used a food processor and pulped up one container at a time of raspberries.... This chunky mixture I then pushed through a seive,just a bit at a time. I probably spent like ten or so minutes doing it. Its not hard. I didn't sit there and try to squeeze every last drop of juice out... In the end I probably got less than half cup of juice. Oh well it was plenty enough! When I added whatever juice I got from the two small baskets of raspberries to the chocolate mixture, the flavor was amazing! Like a chocolate raspberry truffle. When it came time. For the whipped cream, even after reading reviews I was planning on adding the 3/4 cup powdered sugar. But turns out I was out. So I just whipped up the cream with no sugar. On its own, obviously it wasn't sweet. But once I folded it into the chocolate mixture, it was heavenly! It absorbed all that sweetness. I think that if I had added the 3/4 cup powdered sugar to the whipped cream it would have been too much. I just had to share it was too easy. Make chocolate Juice raspberries Mix. Chill. Fold in whipe cream. Freeze Ps I substituted chambord for a 1$ shot of 99 blackberries. It tasted fine, went great with raspberries and chocolate Ps again. 1 shot from the liqour store= 1/3 cup!

Very festive for the holidays. I make this torte every year. I add a full packet of gelatin, approximately double what the recipe calls for. Never had problems with the desert falling after bringing it out of the fridge or freezer. Also, I strain the berry chocolate mixture to remove extra raspberry seeds. I also use less powdered sugar than called for. Final touch is a garnish with fresh raspberries before before putting it out for the party.

This is the most delicious dessert that I have made in a long time. It was easy to make. I did however substitute 1 Tbs.and added remaining water to equal the 1/3 C. instead of the 1/3 C. Chambord. Tasted great! It is twice as good as the picture looks, which is great!

Absolutly wonderful. Texture was so creamy...like the best ice cream you've ever tasted. IT was also not over the top sweet, but had a great flavor. Enjoyed by the whole crowd...from 3 years old to 60!

This torte is impressive looking and quite flavorful but I found it much too rich and the wrong texture for a mousse. It's closer to a frozen cheesecake than mousse. I'd make it again but try subbing in something lighter for the whipping cream.

This is one of the best dessert recipes I've ever come across. It's time consuming but well worth it. I always put parchment paper on the bottom of the springform pan so it doesn't stick and fall apart when I'm trying to serve it (like it did the first time)

With this great base, I made some changes and it came out GREAT! I'm not a big white chocolate fan, so used good dark chocolate instead and fresh raspberries from the garden rather than frozen, then garnished with white and dark chocolate leaves and curls. It was great to be able to make it ahead for the party, and was the hit of it all!

This is an amazing, though somewhat labor intensive, dessert! It's perfect for those special occasions. I usually slice it into at least 16 slices, sometimes 18, as it is VERY rich.

My husband just loves the raspberry and white chocolate combo. In fact, this is THE desert that got him to marry me. This is his special treat that I make a couple of times a year for him. Simple recipe. Chambord is the best to use if you can find it. For the crust, try Trader Joes Chocolate cat crackers. I'll be making htis for years to come.

I have made this dish a number of times for special occations and it always gets rave reviews! My only problem is that I can never find chocolate wafers, so I have to bake my own. But this is no problem because the crust come out perfect everytime! I had though of using Oreos, but them I'm afraid that it would bee too sweet. The rich (though not very sweet) taste of the wafers balances out the sweetness of the filling.

Rating: 3
Looks wise, this desset's presentation is amazing. I made the chocolate leaves, which are surprisingly easy to make, and look absolutely fabulous. Taste wise, this dessert is good, not beyond compare. I made a lot of changes though. I used oreo cookies for the crust, which turned out great. For the filling i used only 10 ounces white chocolate and 2 ounces bittersweet, as some other reviews said that it turned out too sweet. I also reduced the amount of powder sugar to 1/2 cup. I doubled the amount of gelatine because i didn't want to freeze it. The result, a light brown, very bubbly and smooth filling, that tasted a lot like raspberry cheesecake. Everybody loved it and asked fot the recipe. The best of it....the presentation, four forks for that!. Would definetely try it again with only white chocolate.

I made this for a friend's 25th birthday two and a half years ago and everyone loved how it tasted. As others have said, to reduce the sweetness, try reducing portion size. It took over 6 hours to freeze (I ended up freezing it overnight). I'm going to be making it again this week for another friend's birthday.

The torte was quite good, but for the amount of effort required, not really worth it. I have made a much simpler (and less sophisticated-sounding) "summer freeze cheesecake", which I actually find tastier. It is made with light cream cheese, raspberry juice frozen concentrate, ultra low fat cool whip (or real whipping cream for those who don't like to eat 'edible oil products'), and a bit of icing sugar, mixed in a food processer, whipping cream folded in and then poured on top of oreo cookie crumb crust.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I used the Oreo Cookie brand pie crust in a box, very easy. I followed previous reviewers' advice to cut the sugar, so I only added 2 tbsp to the whipped cream. It was wonderful, everyone raved. Does take a long time to freeze, make sure you plan ahead.

This dessert was OUTRAGEOUSLY good!! I wasnt sure about the chocolate wafers for the crust, so I used Oreo cookies (about 16)..

I loved this recipe, and I didn't change a thing about it. Yes, it's sweet, but I just gave people a slightly smaller piece. I have made it five or six times and each time my guests rave about it. It's also easily made ahead of time and presents nicely, both of which are great when entertaining. One of my favorite entertaining recipes!

I loved this recipe. A family friend showed me where to find the recipe and I'm so glad she did! It is exceptionally sweet and the raspberry part took forever so I'd suggest doing that part first. Best slightly melted.

I used a 9.5" pan and used a little less crumb for the crust as suggested and was glad I did. The crust was good and was not too buttery. The cake was very easy to transport in the pan and assemble on site. I skipped the chocolate leaves, made an outer ring of raspberries, a ring of blackberries next to it, and mixed the rest of the 2 pints of raspberries and 1 pint of blueberries and piled them inside the rings, topped with a mint sprig. I found that this amount of fruit was just right to offset the creaminess of the mousse. I also omitted all the sugar (granulated and powdered) because I was making this for a group of people who don't like their desserts too sweet. For most people I think just omitting the powdered sugar would be just right. It was not difficult to cut, and the mousse was a very nice pink, not brown. I also bought a mini food mill (about 5" across) and ran through the raspberries through it once, then strained the result again with a sieve. This was much faster than previous times using a sieve alone. Other cooks who make raspberry sauces for desserts often may want to invest in one. It's much easier to handle and clean than a full-size one.

Easy to put together and it looks very elegant, but...far too sweet even after cutting back on the sugar. I did not add the powdered sugar to the whipped cream as I was concerned about the added sweetness but also a possible "raw" cornstarch taste. Definitely a keeper, but need to work on the amount of sugar or white chocolate. Adding additional gelatin helps especially if you need to transport.

I served this yesterday and it was voted "exquisite!" by all! Had to replace chocolate graham crackers for wafers (couldn't find)so added an oz of semisweet chocolate to darken.Very noisy but processes well. Used combo fresh and frozen raspberries for mousse, luckily followed advice adding extra gelatin, also addded extra whipped cream to reduce sweetness and for top, grated chocolate into powder, randomly added shavings then lots of raspberries. Incredible!

Although it is a very rich dessert (serve in small portions)it was extermely well received and made a beautiful presentation. It was the centerpiece of a dessert buffet and none of my guests wanted to be the first to cut into it. I made a double ring of raspberries on the top in the center and filled it in with fresh whipped cream topped with a mint sprig. A keeper.

Wow - I made this for a Cancer birthday dinner celebration and received great compliments! This recipe scores high for presentation and taste (the chambord is a must!) - the swirls of raspberry/white chocolate make it look wonderful and the taste follows through. Had the same problem with the raspberries, however even with using a wire sieve to press the raspberries, it takes less than 10 minutes, so it's worth the extra effort. Would definitely make this one again for any celebration!

I made this last night at 9:30pm (I couldn't sleep). It did take a while and I would follow the suggestions of the other reviewers such as making the crust thinner and not making so much of the mousse. After I'd thawed the raspberries I put them in the food processer and used a pestle to push the seive. It worked great. Honestly I haven't tried it yet, at least together anyway but I sampled plenty along the way. The mousse really is fabulous! Do try this recipe!

Outstanding! If you want to impress this is the dessert to serve. The presentation was beautiful and the texture smooth and creamy. I followed the advise of previous reviewers and decreased the amount of cookies in the crust and it turn out perfect. Also make sure you grind the cookies in the food processor very well before adding the butter. I used chocolate curls and grated chocolate with the raspberries as decoration and placed the mousse back in the freezer to allow the berries to freeze before serving. Place a knife in hot water before cutting each piece of the mousse for beautiful even slices. I had lots of great compliments from my guests.

A real show-stopper! Fresh raspberries were not available for decoration so I used a medley of frozen berries and it was beautiful. Delicious flavor, very rich and creamy. I'll definitely make it again, and I think a chocolate sauce would make a great accompaniment. Crust was a bit too thick and buttery though, so next time I'll use less crumbs and cut down on the butter.

Excellent! I used several shortcuts (Oreo ready-made crust, Ghirardelli chocolate chips so I wouldn't have to break up the chocolate - using milk chocolate rather than white - and Cool Whip instead of the whipping cream). Still came out wonderful! My husband, a big fan of chocolate and raspberry, called me "the best wife in the world" and I really liked it as well, even though I'm not a huge fan of chocolate. The raspberry is definitely the dominant flavor.

Have to admit that I consider my desserts a success only when people "groan" when they eat them. This was a SUCCESS--BIG TIME, BIG GROANS! Yes, it takes some time with the straining of the raspberries but it is worth it. Made mine 3 days ahead of time and it was great. Used a little less--about 3/4--of the crust because I have found that these types of crusts tend to get a little thick. I served with more fresh raspberries than the recipe called for--and didn't bother with the leaves. It was still wonderful. Can't wait to make it again!

I made this recipe for a friend's 30th birthday and had rave reviews! Some suggestions, use fewer cookie crumbs, maybe 3/4 of what the recipe calls for. Also, only use one frozen package of raspberries, as the mousse will overflow the crust. I decorated with white chocolate abstract pieces, instead of chocolate leaves.

Really, really tasty, w/a wonderful consistency. I used 3/4 of the recipe to fill a Tupperware bundt-shaped mold, with a light layer of crumbs in the bottom (top), and the rest in a 3 x 7-inch loaf pan lined with crumbs. I had a problem melting the white chocolate: the residual heat was not enough to melt it, so I had to leave the pot on a low heat for another 8 minutes, stirring constantly--eventually, it all melted. Otherwise, extremely easy and pretty! Note for other reviewers: using the seeder/food mill attachment on a KitchenAid stand mixer results in a beautiful, perfectly smooth raspberry sauce with a minimum of effort.

We loved this dessert! We used a potato ricer to strain the raspberries; after we riced them, we put them through a seive to get rid of the seeds. This process was fast and easy. We also used a thin crust and let the dessert warm for 10 minutes in the refrigerator before serving. We had no trouble cutting or with melting!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit with everyone. Taking note of previous comments and also having made frozen deserts with this type of crust before, I thinned the crust. I also had a terrible time trying to strain the raspberries. Patience and humor wearing thin, my teenage son came to the rescue. He got a bottle of "Star" vinegar(the type with the long, skinny neck and round bottom) and used it like a mortar and pestle with the strainer. It worked for him but if anyone has a better idea, I would love to hear it. I want to make this again soon!!

I made this for a Christmas party I had last night. The dessert is wonderful, but while the magazine had it in a "Dessert Party" presentation, I would not again make it for such. It melts QUICKLY! I would, however, make it for a dinner party. I also agree with the reviewer who commented on the difficulty in cutting the crust-I will make it thinner next time.

I found this dessert to be harder to make than explained. After putting the rasberries thru a sieve, I needed to strain them again to eliminate all the seeds. It was very time consuming for the results it produced. The flavors were wonderful, but not sure that they were THAT good.

I've made this twice in the past week, once for a holiday potluck and once for an elegant dinner party we hosted last night. Both groups liked it a lot--people were actually moaning as they ate. Curiously, the photo in the magazine showed the mousse to be very light in color, almost white. However, when I made it, it was dark pink. One tip: be sure to make the crust as thin as possible on the edge--if it's thick it's very difficult to cut through and to eat. Next time I'd use fewer crumbs and make the crust thinner all the way around.
