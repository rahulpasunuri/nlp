I have a friend who doesn't like brown chocolate. He does like white chocolate products. I've made this several times to serve over poached pears or ice cream (or both). Do be very careful when adding the cream to the carmelized sugar as it can spatter. Don't lose heart. It can take a while for the cream and sugar to meld. It's worth the effort.

Excellent sauce. Simple but time consuming while sugar melts. Can flavor differently for your dessert needs (I have use orange and rasberry liqueur on separate occasions with great success).

Delicious and very easy to make. You just need to be patient while melting the caramel into the cream. Definitely have on ice cream! Was thinking about giving it as a gift, too.

To the previous reviewer: the recipe shows you how to make caramel -- you don't have to add it. Try it -- it's very good.
