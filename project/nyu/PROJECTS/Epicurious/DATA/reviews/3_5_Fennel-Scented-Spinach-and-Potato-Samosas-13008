With a tiny bit of advance preparation, this dish is easy and quick. There is no need to dice the potatoes. Cut into large chunks and steam (or boil) until done the night before, then refrigerate. Prepare and add the chilies and ginger while cooking the onions, then mash the potatoes with the greens and add to the soft onion mix.

I quadrupled this recipe for a party of 30 I threw. If you do not have serious knife-skills, a Robocoup, or some kind of Popeil device, do not attempt this dish as it is extremely labor-intensive. I did 20 potatoes' worth of 1/4" dice. And it is imperative you have an even dice, not only for mouth-fee, but cooking. Also, if you are in a rush or you are having phyllo problems, I'd suggest cutting the phyllo into maybe 2" squares and just making a little purse and bake them. Beggar's Purses we used to call them. It is imperative this is served with mint chutney. Which the mix is flavorful, you need to garnish to make it complete. I think that is why people complained about the blandness. I probably would not make this again, as it is work. However, it got raves.

I worked for 3 hours, and was so disappointed in the final product that I dumped it. There was remarkably little taste considering the intersting ingredients.

I thought these were very good, but they took a long time (3 hours). While I don't mind a long recipe, the results doesn't seem to merit the investment. I also made the chutney--while it was tasty, I thought the samosas could stand alone. Also, for those who thought the filling was bland, be sure to salt it.

This does take time but it is still very easy. Don't expect a traditional samosa with the fried and thicker dough, but they are surprisingly delicious because they are fragrant and light. Definitely make sure to make the potatoes cubed small enough. Also, I made it with peas vs spinach, which to me is more typical of a samosa. They came out great without any other change in the ingredients. I made the mint/cilantro chutney which was excellent. Do not overgrease the pan- just barely touch it or the bottoms will get soggy.

Much easier to prepare than the typical deep-fried samosa recipes I'm used to. Can't see how you can really serve this dish without the accompaniment of the mint chutney. Even without meat in the ingredients, came out suprisingly savory and satisfying.

I don't think I'll make these again; I didn't scrimp on any of the spices but the filling was decidedly ho-hum. Maybe peas and some sort of cheese would wake these up?

To my horror I realised the grocery store didn't have filo dough after I had made the chutney and the filling. I made it with short crust pastry dough instead, brushed with egg and baked for about 35 minutes and they were delicious. Although the mint sauce (don't know why they call it chutney, it's really a raita) tasted a little grainy by itself, when eaten with the samosas it was wonderful--I recommend it.

I'll be making these again! I had never used phyllo before and was a little nervous but it wasn't that difficult after the first couple. No, they are not traditional samosa but they were a hit at my gathering.

I used frozen spinach and doubled the recipe. I'm not sure if that is where the trouble lay. I just wasn't a fan of the filling at all. I would try this again with fresh spinach and more salt.

Yummy, yummy, yummy. My hubby told me (unprompted, 4 hours after dinner) that this samosas were good enough for a restaurant.

The fragrance alone would make these worth making! I'm not a fan of fennel but made them for a meal honoring a fennel-loving friend, yet I loved these. Lovely flavors. I used Ishmael Merchant's wonderful mint chutney instead of the recipe here.

I agree with the majority of the previous reviews. The recipe is pretty time consuming, but tastes fabulous. I made the filling one night ahead of time, and can't imagine managing a dinner with this appetizer any other way. I added green peas to the filling since most of the samosas in my favorite restaurants contained them. I probably made two small errors during the preparation that I would like to tweak next time. The size of the potaote cubes was a little too big (sometimes making it difficult to roll the phyllo) and the baking pan had too much butter. The phyllo is a welcomed deviation from the fried tradition and its nice to keep it as light as possible. With excess butter on the pan, the bottoms were a bit (uncessarily) greasy, which seemed kind of distracting. Previous reviewers found the chutney (which is really simple) a bit off, but I went ahead with it anyway. I first tasted the samosa without the chutney and then with. My wife and I agreed that the contrasting sweetness of the raisins enhanced the dish alot. I will be adding this recipe into my book of recipes and can't wait to make it again.

I made these for an Indian dinner as a starter and followed the recipe exactly. Usually samosas are deep fried, but I thought that these were just as good and even better using phyllo. They were lighter and crispy, and the filling was fantastic. Give these a try. It was simple and a wonderful starter.

Please do not call these samosas. They are spinach and potato spanakopitas as they use phyllo dough. The crust of a samosa is more like a pastry and what makes it incomprehensible to the western cook is that when made right, it is a flaky crust and all without the use of butter, shortening or any leavening agent. The trick is in the frying. I came to the US about 3 yrs back and I havent found any restaurant that makes them right. I have to make them from scratch anytime I get homesick for a good punjabi samosa. It is a long and tedious recipe and there are no short cuts. If you ever get to travel to India....eat samosas to your hearts content because you dont get them here. And then you'll hate the stuff that gets passed on for samosas here in the states.

I love Indian food and I cant believe how easy it is to make these outstanding appetizers!I agree with the cook from Ireland that adding fresh or even frozen peas to this recipe adds additional texture and flavor..Yum!

I made this receipe for friends and they all raved about it. I even had to hand over the recipe then and there! I added a chopped up fennel bulb rather than fennel seeds as I didn't have any to hand and I also added some garden peas. I'll definitely be making this one time and time again.

The samosas are incredibly wonderful. I've made it several times, and each time, after the first bite, everyone stops talking and just focuses on the food. The chutney is only okay - that's where I would get creative next time.

I started making this recipe over three years ago and it has always been a big hit. I serve it with mulligatawny soup using the vegetarian version in Wholefoods Cookery by Tess Mallos. For condiments I serve fiery onion relish and sweet and sour tamarind sauce, both I believe from Sundays at Moosewood. I also serve raita and for beverages I make plain or mango lassis. It does make quite an impression but is time consuming. I find it helpful to split up the preparation making the filling the night before I am serving the dinner.

I am a huge samosa fan and I thought these samosas were absolutely wonderful - fragrant and flavourful. The mint chutney is a MUST. It absolutely puts them over the top. I highly recommend it and will make it again, although, I, unlike the others who have commented here, did not find this quick to make.

I love this recipe. It was a hit the first time I made it, when the recipe first appeared. An Indian guest (raised in Singapore) loved it and has since made it many times for her family. I am looking up the recipe here for a party this weekend, because I can't find my copy. But to tell the truth, you can improvise a lot and still be successful. I have made it without a recipe in front of me in the past (including the yogurt sauce). The first time I tried the recipe, I had never used phyllo dough before, so that took a bit of getting used to. I have since become more experienced with it. It really is a nice touch, instead of heavy dough.

I am a second generation Indian, and I made this for my parents. I left out the spinach and increased the potatoes, thought the spinach just didn't belong. It worked well, I thought 10 minuted might have been a bit long.

I have a passion for cooking and enjoying meals with friends. I had prepared this appetizer in very last minute fashion after work for an Epicurean Dinner Club comprised of dear friends; Indian was the chosen theme and I had been tasked with this course -- It was fabulous!! I literally had the whole course done in less than an hour (from bag to serving tray) and it was a hit with everyone. I was not a fan of the mint chutney (which I normally love), but everyone else was and it actually went beautifully with the lamb. I will be taking this to parties as an Hors d'Oeuvre on a regular basis - gone is the fruit and cheese tray of summer! If I were tasked with an entire meal, I would do all of the preparation the night before; it would be incredibly quick while making you look like an Epicurean God or Goddess! Bon Appetite!

Very, very good, despite the fact that I had no fennel or spinach and that I chickened out on the rich pastry dough and used-get this-a plain bread dough. Sounds dull? It was'nt. I made a "purse" style pocket of flattened dough in my hand and put the filling in and squeezed the bread dough together on top. The tumeric made the dough come out yellow in spots (no complaints!) Also, I ended up with too much filling, so I just put some on top of each somosa. It roasted nicely and looked good; and those somosas WENT. They reheat well in the microwave too (and are not bad cold for lunch; like pizza!). The plain dough was a white bread dough from a bread machine cookbook; it was a lot easier (and better for us) than a rich pastry. Perhaps the Poppodom Police will come after me for my lack of authenticity, but I don't care.

These were wonderful! The recipe yielded exactly 25 samosas for me and I loved the jalapeno kick so I wouldn't reduce the amount of chili. The mint sauce has also got some heat but I thought it was the perfect compliment to the samosas as did my 5 guests. I think baking the samosas wrapped in fillo dough is far, far superior to the heavy deep-fried pastry that is typically used for this Indian treat. To hell with authenticity. Next time I make them I will try using a good quality olive oil cooking spray instead of melted butter as it will significantly speed up the process. Finally, these will keep just fine if prepared up to the point of baking a day before as long as they are well wrapped with cling film before refrigerating.

Long prep time on this dish, but worth it. I miss the traditional samosa pastry, but had fun with the phyllo. Oddly, the 3 peppers made these samosas a bit too spicy (who knew?) and so next time I'd use only one, I'd up the fennel to 2 tbsp., use a whole pound of potatoes and use only a half pound of spinach (or less), thereby making a more traditional fennel and potato samosa w/ spinach in it. Yummy overall and a hit with the boyfriend. This recipe yielded far more than 25 (about twice actually,) so I'd plan on freezing the extras after the wrap phase, or half the recipe, or have lots of guests!

I subbed finely diced fennel bulb for the seeds, which complimented the mint chutney very well. A hearty yet lighter alternative to deep friend samosas.

These are sensational -- try them with Ishmael Merchant's mint chutney (from his Passionate Meals cookbook).
