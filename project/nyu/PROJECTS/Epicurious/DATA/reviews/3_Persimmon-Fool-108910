Forget about the puree. Substitute 3 large very ripe persimmons and puree them with a hand blender. The dessert is delicious. Recommend substituting agave nectar for the sugar, lower glycemic rating & easier to blend. Fantastic dessert, simple and totally persimmon.

The photo is gorgeous, but the recipe is terrible. Little to no flavor at all. It was very "plain". My family refused to eat it.

Unfortunately, this dessert was all bad! the texture of the purée dried out our mouths. 2 tbsps. of sugar wasn't nearly enough to sweeten dessert. it was blah! what a waste!
