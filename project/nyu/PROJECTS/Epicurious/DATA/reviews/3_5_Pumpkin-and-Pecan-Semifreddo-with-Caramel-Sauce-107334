In a word - Incredible! I was assigned to make this for a dinner party and it was a hit with everyone. Prepared exactly as stated and it turned out perfect. I notice some comments regarding its sweetness, but with 2-c of sugar and multiple tbls of corn syrup what should one expect? Will definitely make this one again... and again and again.

We thought this a fantastic dessert, although I can see how many would consider it to be overly sweet. It needs to go straight from the freezer to the table with as little time in between as possible as it will start to soften rapidly. Note to self - use a longer handled whisk when mixing the cream into the sugar. Steam burns suck. Will I make it again? Likely... and I'm a serial never-make-the-same-recipe-twice guy.

I made this for Thanksgiving, instead of pie because my oven has died.This was way, way too sweet. I checked the recipe to see if I accidentally added too much sugar or corn syrup at some point, but definitely made it as written. It needed a lot more pumpkin flavor, and the spices were a touch overpowering. We have a bunch left over and no one wants to eat it. I agree with the other reviews that the caramel sauce is really good, used sour cream instead of creme fraiche...it had a nice tang.

I made this dessert for a dinner party. I followed the recipe all the way through except I subbed brown rice syrup for corn syrup. I'm not sure if that's what caused this problem but when I turned the dessert over onto the serving dish it immediately began melting. I served the dish anyways and it looked like a glob of goo but it was still edible. I even had a friend state that it was so good she didn't care what the consistency was. She went further to say it was so good that she'd "eat it off the floor." I guess with her it was a hit. The recipe was pretty complex for me and since the result wasn't perfect I won't be making this again.

Boy...this one was a real disappointment. Failed to anything special or delicious. Made it as directed...everything worked the way it should. Must be my tastebuds.

Absolutely delicious! I have made this twice in the last week for two different dinner parties. Everyone raved at both at how great it was. I created a layer of whipped cream on top rather than serving it on the side. The caramel recipe makes enough for 2 dishes, because then you will be dealing with small amounts

I've made this dessert several times for guests and it's always a big hit. The caramel sauce is the best I've ever tasted and is now my "go to" caramel sauce recipe.

This recipe was an exciting alternative to typical Thanksgiving desserts. Our guests loved it! Check out my review at www.ilovepumpkins.com and search for "pumpkin semifreddo."

even my kids loved this--however, i totally cheated and used store bought caramel sauce. we've made it our thanksgiving "pie"--can make ahead and there's never leftovers.

I started making this in 2002 and continue to make it every year. It has the WOW factor .. elegant, delicious, unusual. It has always been a huge success. Make as directed and be confident it will be a winner.

Although there was definitely nothing wrong with this recipe, I'm not sure I'd make it again. I agree that it was way too sweet...and I have quite the sweet tooth. The caramel sauce is delicious on its own, but on top of the sweet semifreddo, it's just too much.

this was way too sweet, and that is saying alot coming from me. it didn't have alot of flavor other than being sweet. i definitely won't try this again, but i'll make a different semifreddo recipe seeing as it is my favorite dessert.

This was super yummy, I used store bought caramel and it was perfectly fine. Also, I didn't have a candy thermometer, so I just used the one for the bird, it worked. My guests absolutely raved, all of them asked for the recipe. It was not the easiest thing I've ever made, but it was worth the effort. I did think the crust was a bit difficult to cut through when frozen because it was so thick, so instead of a loaf pan, I will use a round pie pan next time.

Was not real happy w/the main dessert but the carmel sauce is superb!

Made two with one can of pumkin and sent off one with a prayer. Nice change from pumkin pie for Thanksgiving. Very rich so go light on the caramel.

Pretty good...interesting twist if you are sick of making pumpkin pie. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin but I liked this...would probably love it if I loved pumpkin. Very, very sweet.

WOW! this was so good. Huge success at last years Thanksgiving. I still get requests for this recipe. I am making it again since so many were hoping for it again. Store bought caramel sauce might make it easier, but, don't go without it. The toffee chips are fun.

Loved this recipe! It is so light and delicious...

Made this to take for Thanksgiving dinner in 2002. It was a huge success. I'm preparing it again for a dinner party this season (2003). I especially like this recipe because I can substitute gluten-free gingersnap cookie crumbs and prepare a delicious dessert that is enjoyed by those who have Celiac disease. Finding unique gluten-free recipes is a continuing challenge.

I tried doubling the recipe and it was a total failure. The whipped egg whites fell after adding the sugar mixture.

Overall, this was an easy dessert to make, and while the initial tryout was only "showing off" for two of us, it was a hit. We did omit the toffee chips (sounded as though it would be too sweet), and were very happy with the results! Absolutely will make this for the pumpkin fans in the family during the holidays -- and that would be all of us.

This got rave reviews at Christmas. It's the perfect end to a big meal because it is not too heavy. We served it with whipped cream, but I agree that store bought carmel sauce would be just as good and a whole lot less effort and much easier clean up. Would definitely make again for a special occasion.

I've made this twice, both times to rave reviews. All but my husband found the caramel and whipped cream to be too over the top (the store-bought caramel was just fine, and MUCH less time consuming). The second time I made it in an 8" springform pan, with the crust on the bottom-much easier and a prettier presentation. Even the kids loved it. A keeper!

We found this to be extremely good. As several others commented it could probably use less sugar. We also never got around to serving it with whipped cream. I am not sure it is really necessary with such a luscious dessert. It was reasonably easy to make - several steps but none difficult. It really does need to be made in advance in order for it to freeze properly. Interestingly the only problem we encountered was locating toffee in central New Hampshire. We couldn't even find Heath bars. We finally resorted to crushing Hershey nuggets with toffee and almonds.

This was a nice alternative to pumpkin pie and I'm not sorry I made it, but it is a lot of work if you are doing the whole Thanksgiving meal..... The fact that it can be made in advance is a plus and it is fairly light (I didn't do the whipped cream), but it's not destined to be a 'classic' in my crowd.

I would make this again, but definitely cut back the sugar to half the amount. It was too sweet. Other than that, it was a nice change from pumpkin pie and so much lighter. It made a nice presentation, much to the chagrin of those that expected the traditional pumpkin pie!

I served this on Thanksgiving to just a few people-- everyone in my family goes to pecan or apple pie before trying anything new. The four of us who were daring enough to try it loved it. If your family is like mine, I recommend making it on a day other than Thanksgiving so that it receives the praise and recognition it deserves. I am really not a fan of pumpkin, and I thought it was fantastic...I also want to say that I ate it without the caramel sauce because I always want to cut butter out of my own diet, and it was great. The family loved the whipped cream and caramel. I appreciated how light it really was without the toppings.

I made this dessert for the Thanksgiving. It was a hit and a nice alternative to a pumpkin pie. It was a bit on the sweet side and it was difficult to cut due to the fact that it started to melt quickly. It made a nice presentation on the plate with the caramel and whip cream.

It was a hit at Thanksgiving. I had never made any thing that required a candy thermomoter so I was a little leary. Not disappointed.

I served this for Thanksgiving yesterday to a crowd of non-pumpkin-lovers and it was a hit. It is a refreshing alternative to the standard pumpkin pie. The only criticism was that it was a tad on the sweet side - you really can't eat a lot of it. I am wondering if it is possible to cut back on the sugar a little. Also, it is somewhat labor-intensive, although none of the steps are very difficult. I saved time by purchasing a fine quality caramel sauce and noone was the wiser.

Gave it a trial run a few weeks ago. A wonderful dessert. Loads of different flavors and textures. And something cold after a big meal was very refreshing. The recipe says 8 servings. It is so rich I think you can easily get 12 out of it.
