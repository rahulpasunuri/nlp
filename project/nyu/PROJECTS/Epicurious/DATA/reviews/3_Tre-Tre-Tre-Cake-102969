whoops, my review below was meant for the Anarchy Cake!

Unlike other reviewers, I love the olive oil and balsamic flavor in this cake. Very unusual, simple yet sophisticated. Plus great for those days when you are low on butter but still want to bake a quick cake! I come back to this one over and over ... and over again. I am still working on finding the perfect fruit-to-cake ratio. But generally it is a GREAT way to use up extra fruit that is no longer gorgeous but is still edible. And it is right up my 'not-to-sweet-please' alley.

I make this often. It's very simple and easy to make. The olive oil gives it a nice aroma. The texture is not fine, so is good at tea or with berries for dessert. Be sure to add enough lemon zest to compliment the olive oil.

Try the Anarchy Cake (on this website) instead. Same idea, better execution. As for olive oil giving it an odd flavor--the oil could have been rancid oil, or a higly flavored extra virgin oil. Try a light olive oil with little flavor next time and save the good stuff for dipping bread.

This Italian cake is meant to be quite plain and quite dry (compared to our versions of cake. It is at its best with a capuccino or coffee/tea. The "bustina" or "cartina" makes the difference(instead of baking powder), and can be purchased in most food stores as "lievito per dolce".

Decent, although I found the flavor added by the olive oil to be slightly unpleasant in a cake. It may have been the odor, which could possibly be corrected by adding a highly scented sauce? We served it with a vanilla custard sauce, but I'd like to try it with a citrus and cream sauce of some kind.

Just found this to be too bland and a little too heavy. It wanted bad, there are just so many better ones out there.

This cake is versatile,just as the accompanying article suggests. It is not too sweet, which is pleasing. It is also quite sturdy as well as moist. I will be making this cake quite often.
