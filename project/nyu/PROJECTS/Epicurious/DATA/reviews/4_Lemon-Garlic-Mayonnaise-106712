Made this along with the shrimp. I did not use the bread and cut the mayo down significantly. Then I put the shrimp on a bed of baby spinach and used the sauce as a dressing for them both. Nice light meal for a warm day.

Made this over the weekend with the grilled shrimp recipe, everyone was raving about the mayo. I made it in advance, simple and easy!! Will definitely make this one again.
