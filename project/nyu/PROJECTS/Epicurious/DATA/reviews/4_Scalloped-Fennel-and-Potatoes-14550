These are fabulous.... I cooked them just as suggested.they cooked for one hour twenty minutes. The last 20 minutes I sprinkled shredded gruyere cheese on top. They seemed to need that additional time. They taste soooooo creamy and amazing. I will make these again!

Honestly, I was hoping for more of a gourmet experience. I love fennel but this just didn't work for me. Luckily I made the scalloped potatoes with creme fraiche and herbs that is out of this world!

I've been looking for a go-to scalloped potato recipe. I'm usually a huge sucker for dairy fat too, so I was pretty excited to whip this up. Really though, not great. I halved the recipe but followed the ratios exactly. It didn't have any kick at all. The flavour of the fennel was mostly lost during the baking. The whole thing was totally blah. I melted parmesan on it the next day and it was passable, sort of. I have no problem with ridiculous caloric intake in exchange for a great dish, but this was absolutely, 100% not worth it.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! Granted, it's a heart attack in a dish; it's worth it. It would be perfect for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. Don't bother with the dividing and organizing of it all. Just alternate layers, cook, enjoy then walk 50 miles to offset the calories. It's really worth it!

OMG - My FAVORITE potato recipe ever. My husband and visiting parents liked this a lot too! I did use half and half for the cream and only 1/2 of the butter on the top. Next time I make this I'll venture to further reduce the butter and see what happens with skim milk. Made according to recipe, you have to have a special event to eat this given the calories....but boy-oh-boy was this good!!!!

I'm always amazed on here when people rave about the recipe when they've made MAJOR changes to it....though I guess it's still good to know. Anyway, I was a little nervous to make this as it had no cheese and seemed LOADED with fennel. However, four forks and lots of reviews haven't let me down yet, so I bit the bullet and made it. It was delicious! I served it at two different events---one my dinner club, the next--my finicky family and all liked it. If you are scared of the fennel, don't be! It really is delicious. Personally, I followed this recipe pretty closely, with no modifications.

I added grated parmesean cheese on the top and baked it an additional 15 minutes. After letting it sit for about 5 minutes, I cut in to see there was quite a bit of liquid pooling in the bottom of the dish. But the potatoes were cooked perfectly so it wasn't that much of a problem once served with a slotted spatula. When my husband went back for seconds a good 15 minutes later, the liquid was almost all absorbed! So it worked out well anyways (btw, still didn't add the additional 1/2 cup cream half way through). Please don't leave out the fennel, that's what sets this scalloped potato dish apart from the rest. A must try!

I halved the recipe like many previous reviewers, with a few modifications: 1. Only 2 cups of heavy cream (this is more than enough when combined with 1.5 cups chicken broth). 2. I only put a layer of fennel between the first and second layer of potatoes. 3. I instead put a layer of goat cheese between the second and third layer of potatoes. 4. I took a shortcut and just poured the cream mixture over all the layers at the end and then pressed down - this worked just fine! This was considered the greatest dish for entire xmas dinner! This recipe is actually quite easy and the taste of fennel is not at all overwhelming so don't exclude it!

Don't leave out the fennel, whatever you do! It added the most delicious flavour, we just couldn't get enough of this. Really decadent with Balsamic and Dijon Glazed Ham with Roasted Pearl Onions.

I halved this dish (to serve 8 people) for Christmas Eve. It was absolutely out of this world. Everyone had seconds and then people started scraping the dish. I never write reviews but took the time because this is a special recipe. I also needed to come online to print out another copy of the recipe because one of my guests took mine! By the way, I completely left out the FENNEL (on purpose) because my family has never liked it and you wouldn't have any idea that the recipe was missing anything. Also, I used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 light cream because I ran out of heavy cream and there was no problem whatsoever. I did use 3 lbs of potatoes though, and that really was a good amount, as opposed to the 2 lbs if you halved the recipe faithfully.

I doubled this for a dinner party of 30 (more than enough) and got lots of requests for the recipe. Added fresh dill and fresh grated parmisano reggiano between the layers. For some reason of the 3 pans I made, the deeper metal pan's potatoes did not turn out as wonderful in consistency as the thinner layers in glass dishes....not sure about that, but luckily the 2 pans were enough. Put all the liquid in up front and did not add any during or after cooking. Will make again for sure.

I also halved the recipe for a smaller group - used only 2 cups cream and 1 cup broth and added it before baking; it absorbed nicely but didn't need more. Kept garlic and nutmeg and pepper the same, used half of flour and salt in liquid. Baked to tender and golden in 60 minutes. I also chose not to peel the potatoes - makes the dish more rustic, and healthier! It's also a lot faster to make :-)

My family loves this dish. My modifications: I half the recipe, use a combination of cream and 1% milk, and add goat cheese between the layers. I've never had difficulty with it setting up, but it is very creamy. I'm going to use an earlier poster's suggestion and make mashed potatoes with the leftovers for dinner tomorrow night.

This is a wonderful dish, which always gets rave reviews from dinner guests. I do, however, cut back a bit on the cream and don't feel that it compromises the dish in any manner... very rich with a third less cream.

I have made this recipe every year since 1999. My family insists on this dish every Christmas day. It is wonderfully simple yet elegant. I make it a day ahead and reheat. It is still excellent and tolerates reheating well. We feel it is better the next day so making it ahead is terrific. I have also made the dish for entertaining larger parties. Everyone raves about the dish and asks for the recipe.

Really nice flavor, and the fennel is a nice twist on classic scalloped potatoes. I increased the flour and decreased the liquids, but still had trouble getting the liquid to absorb. I made this for a crowd here for a weekend, and put the leftovers into the food processor (minus the browned ones on top) and turned it into the best mashed potatoes I've ever tasted. Those went even faster than the first night.

Since we were serving a dinner party for six I halved the recipe and made only a single dish. I used all five cloves of garlic and 2 TBsp flour, only one cup of broth, sprinkled each layer of potatoes with salt and white pepper, and added all liquid at beginning. The cooking time turned out to be an hour and twenty minutes. Served with roast rack of pork with dijon/rosemary rub and green beans. Not a trace of potatoes were left and everyone raved about them. Definitely a keeper!!

I made this exactly as written for Christmas Eve. I baked it earlier in the day and then warmed it up for dinner. While my guests raved, I agree with the earlier reviewer who suggested it could use some additional kick.

Nice texture. Mild flavor - could use some punching up- with something besides salt & pepper. Otherwise nice recipe.

I've made this dish for Christmas dinner since 1997. It is so delicious that now I make a double batch and send one home with my nephew, baking dish and all!! It's a great way to give him nice dishes and a full stomach!

Small crowd, so halved the recipe. However, I increased the amount of flour as others suggested and was glad I did. Also, ran out of cream so used cream/whole milk combination. It took longer to cook than noted (about 1 hour, 20 min) but kept well and reheated beautifully the next day. Served this with herbed prime rib (also on this site) and was not disappointed.

Excellent recipe for scalloped potatoes. I prepared it Christmas Eve to accompany Prime Rib. Our dinner guests ranged from 2 yrs to 80+ in age, and all enjoyed this recipe. We saw many taking two and three servings! It baked to a nice consistency, but I omitted 1/2 cup of the chicken broth. Also I didn't add the cream after baking 30 minutes, I added all the cream at the beginning and it baked fine, not dry nor runny. The children didn't notice the fennel, however, my market only had 1.5 lbs, so perhaps the reason for the soft fennel flavor. The recipe notes this serves 16. That is 16 large portions. Make the entire recipe, as leftovers are just as good the second day. Also, as mentioned earlier, many will take seconds.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!!! As it was the first time I made it, I followed it exactly. I also found that there was too much liquid, however, although the dish 'sat' for awhile before serving, it did 'firm up' quite a bit the longer it sat. And!, not only did the liquid absorb, it was even yummier for the second helpings! The fennel is pleasant and just the right touch Be prepared ... do make the whole recipe as everyone will want seconds (and thirds) and copy the recipe to give to your guests as they leave (as I had to do). Boring scalloped potatoes move over ...

I have made this for the past three Christmas dinners. The flavor is wonderful -- very rich with the fennel taste just peeking through. The first two times I made it, the sauce bubbled over and did get quite thick enough. This year I decreased the liquids and increased the flour. Very tasty!
