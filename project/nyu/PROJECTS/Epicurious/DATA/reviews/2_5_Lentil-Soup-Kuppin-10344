I don't get this recipe. Why would you just dump all the ingredients in a pot and boil it??? Instead, you should start by sauteing the meat, then removing it and sauteing the veggies in the fat. Then add the lentils and stock, herbs, etc. and simmer till the lentils are cooked. I'd either add the meat back or serve the soup with the crisp bacon/pancetta/ham on top. Makes a lot more sense to me!

drop pancetta. Use leftover roast beef & bayleaf, decrease olive oil to 1-2T, increase garlic, add 14oz can diced tomato/chilis, sautee meat/vegies before adding broth & lentils. Better to my taste.

I really like this soup because it's easy and makes a lot, although my husband says I make better ones than this. First, I saute the onion in some olive oil, then start adding everything else. I use diced smoked ham instead of boiling a good piece of pancetta. I also add sliced fresh spinach at the VERY end (but if the sight of reheated, "boiled" spinach turns your stomach, don't add it). The lemon juice is key to pump up the flavor.

This is a great recipe with a few changes. Drop the olive oil. Replace the pancetta with a nice piece of smoked ham, diced. Finally, don't add the vegetagles until the end, to avoid overcooking. A delicious soup, we have it monthly during the winter.

This made an okay soup, but I don't understand it. Why would you boil 1/4 cup of oil? I used pancetta, and ended up with boiled pancetta in my soup.

Surprisingly delicious, although I used bacon instead of pancetta. My husband raved and we voted to add it to our list of favorites.
