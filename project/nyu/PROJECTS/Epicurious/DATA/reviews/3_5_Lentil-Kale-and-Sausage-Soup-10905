Gourmet in 35 minutes! Double the recipe for 4 servings - with ghee sauteed andouille chicken sausage on med high heat with red onion, extra garlic, cayenne, & tossed in 2 heaping handfulls of thinly sliced young kale - till sausage is browned. Added it all to the lentils, which had simmered for 20 min spiced with morocan curry, bay leaf, dash of cinnamon, anise, 1 clove, tablespoon of duckfat, dab of butter, 1 chipotle pepper. if you don't like too much spice go easy on the cayenne. this is an unforgettable lentil dish. served with simple white rice made with chicken stock, light salt and, yes, a dab of butter.

Really easy recipe to follow. I added about a half cup more kale and threw in some extra veggies to make it heartier. I will definitely try this one again!

The best soup I have made in years. I followed the advice of others and doubled the recipe and used all stock, no water. I used half vegetable and half chicken stock. Bay leaves are a good addition. I wanted a bit of a kick so I used chorizo sausage (pre-cooked and then browned). Used half red wine vinegar and half balsamic. I think all balsamic would be too sweet. I will definitely make it again and throw in more vegetables.

Great recipe and suggestions. Local apple chicken sausage, bay leaves, thyme and scallions also worked well in the recipe.

Rating: 2
I think I got my proportions all wrong, but it still turned out ok. I used chorizo instead of kielbasa and a big shallot instead of an onion. It was good, but nothing I'd crave eating again. Still, as a was relatively healthy, fast, and required only one pot, it's a good recipe to have in your recipe box. =)

The best of both worlds: delicious and healthy! I doubled this recipe and added some extra veggies I had in the fridge (parsnip and potatoes) The soup was so yummy, I probably could have tripled the recipe. It tasted even better day 2 than day 1. The recipe seems very adaptable to any extra veggies. I'm looking forward to making this again with different veggies and lentil combinations.

Made this last night. Doubled the recipe as it didn't make enough for 4 main course servings. Used 2/3 chicken broth and 1/3 water, 1/2 a bag of already cut kale from Trader Joe's, which made it easier than de-ribbing a bunch of kale. Also added a bay leaf and a pinch of dried thyme. I forgot to add the balsamic vinegar and know what it does for pea soup so will definitely remember next time I make this. All in all a lot of flavor for little effort.

I enjoy this recipe as written. It's hearty, delicious, and particularly enjoyable in the fall and winter months. The vinegar at the end really brings it together.

I just made this recipe to use some kale I had in the fridge. I used smoked chicken sausage and small mediterranean lentils. First time I add vinegar to lentil soup and it does really make a difference. To my surprise, my 5-year old loved it. Thanks for giving me this satisfaction!

Just made this recipe again, and again, enjoyed it. Used all chicken broth and no water. We had leftover bratwursts with jalapenos in them from another meal so I used those instead of kielbasa. They gave the soup a nice kick. I don't mind that it's a small quantity; it's easy enough to double.

I loved it just as written... the flavors meld perfectly. I have been making it for years, and made more today as a cold weather antidote. I use green french lentils rather than the usual brown and they are delicious... do NOT skip the vinegar! It is what brings all the flavors together! I also love that it makes just enough for two people - PERFECT

We love this easy recipe. I use low- fat turkey kielbasa, kale or spinach, add marjoram and oregano. Very nice.

this is delicious. I used turkey sausage and all chicken broth and found it rich and satisfying. I actually cooked the lentils in a rice cooker first with chopped onions, bay leaf, 1/4 cup of cooked turkey sausage and the bay leaf as someone suggested. When done I put everything in a Crock pot

Rating: 4
OMG! This is soooo good. I love all the wonderful flavors. Being a veggie, I used Tofurkey kielbasa, as well as veggie broth and it is great. Also, used up some veggies like carrots and celery. I love garlic so I added another clove. And how could a lovely bay leaf hurt? So it is a great basic recipe as is but I chose to "dress'er up a bit!" The balsamic is such a nice kicker!

Rating: 3
This is an easy recipe, but I'd agree with other reviews that its really just a good jumping off point. I used lean turkey sausage, and added a carrot and a celery rib, and then showered it with freshly ground pepper right at the end. Wasn't terribly bland, but it could use a little more depth to the flavor.

Rating: 4
This is a weeknight standby for me. So quick and easy not to mention healthy (we use spicy Italian chicken sausage). My husband loves it! Although I've NEVER used lentils.... the first time I made it I didn't have lentils so I substituted cannellini beans and it was delicious! I've used chick peas as well. I'm sure it would be great with lentils but I'm sold on my current method!

Rating: 3
I think that the reviewers who found this not to meld just needed to cook it longer. It seems to take at least 1/2 hour longer, especially if you include carrots and so on. We use hot sauce and garlic powder to season lentil soup at the table--love them. Joy of Cooking (1997?) has a very similar recipe, which I'll just use in the future. I want to give a plug to Stephen Schmidt, who worked on that edition. He's my favorite cookbook author.

Rating: 3
Like others, I made significant modifications. The original amount of the finished soup (3 cups) was ridiculously small, so I quadrupled the recipe. Used spicy turkey sausage; added 3 sliced carrots and 2 sliced celery stalks which I sauteed with the onions and garlic; added 2 14-oz cans of diced tomatoes with juices and used all chicken broth instead of half water. Simmered longer than called for after adding kale. Vinegar is key! Don't skip it. We really enjoyed the finished soup.

I've made much much better lentil soup. This recipe was pretty bland, even though I added additional veggies as people suggested and a very healthy dash of Jamaican pepper sauce (in addition to the vinegar). I don't plan on making it again.

this was good and pretty easy - my husband really liked it - I liked it after I pureed it - the flavors seemed a little disjointed otherwise. i added carrot and loved all the wonderful veggies in this soup. I bet it will taste even better tommorow.

I give this only 3 forks b/c I made a few of additions, with the additions...AMAZING! I took the ideas from other reviewers and added carrots, a large baking potato and sliced mushrooms with the onions and garlic. I also doubled the recipe. I substituted chorizo for kielbasa b/c that is what I had and Baby Russian Red Kale instead of regular large kale because that is what came in my CSA share this week. Absolutely excellent.

Like many other reviewers, I found this to be a good starting point; however, I also added diced carrot, celery, and potato to the onion and garlic, in addition to essentially doubling the recipe and adding bay leaf and fresh thyme. The balsamic finish at the end makes this one special.

Rating: 3
Since I made what I consider to be enhancements to this recipe, I'm giving 3 forks, but with my changes it would get 4 forks. No sense in making this small quantity so I quadrupled the ingredients. I also added chopped celery, carrots, parsley and 1 can chopped tomatoes. Don't forget the balsamic vinegar because is so brilliantly highlights both the sausage and the kale. I cooked as long as 2 hours and much preferred that texture of the kale with the long simmering. A permanent addition to my recipe file and will definately make again because it just feels good to eat.

Rating: 3
After reading other reviewers' entries I omitted water and just used chicken broth. When the lentils were cooked the broth tasted a bit thin, so I added two bay leaves and a few tablespoons of minced parsley and celery leaves. The soup was quite good, though next time I will double the amount of kielbase I use and maybe add some tomato paste.

I'm vegetarian, and this recipe was a perfect use for my meatless (soy) kielbasa! I used Puy lentils, and added some barley - the perfect soup for a snowy day. The balsamic adds a wonderful dimension of flavour at the end. Yum!

I should start out by saying that I hate kale. But, I ate every bit of this soup and am looking forward to leftovers. As others suggested I doubled the recipe and added carrots. I used chorizo since we had it in the house. Even my husband loved it and he hates lentils.

Soup was very thin on taste. The flavors didn't enhance one another, but felt more like water with stuff thrown in. I even add some chopped tomatoes to give it color and flavor, but it didn't help.

I have made this twice now, and enjoyed it so much that the last time I tripled the recipe and froze it in one-cup portions to eat as lunch at work. I use red lentils which cook to a soft-puree, and it helps the soup blend together. The vinegar at the end really blends nicely with the sausage. I serve this with whole wheat rolls, and my family loves it

This was a big disappointment; we followed the recipe to the letter, but wound up with a soup that tasted like nothing but kielbasa. I would definitely *not* make this one again.

Amazingly memorable! I was just trying to use up some greens, but this got me back into soup again. I doubled the sausage (and why not -- the lentils and kale atone for it!) A big hit with my pals, too. I've made this three times in as many months, and I'm big on new recipes so that's quite the accolade.

Great recipe. Carrots add some nice color.

A lot of flavor for the effort. I thought I wasn't hungry but a "taste" turned into two large bowls (yes I made double; it's a small recipe as-is). I think maybe the kielbasa should go in later, perhaps with the kale...mine got a little rubbery. I may also try split peas. I used more broth than water but would suggest using all broth as other reviewers have.

I used chorizo and red lentils in this soup - delicious. I also added two carrots and one potato when I added the onions. The lentils and potatoes broke down and made for a thicker soup. Very good for a fall dinner and even better the next day.

This was excellent altho I made some changes. I used 1 1/4 lb. of sweet turkey sausage and while browning, added crushed red pepper. I doubled the recipe as suggested by other reviewers. I chopped 5 garlic cloves, 1 large carrot, 1 1/2 onions, and 2 handfuls of sliced mushrooms. I added red wine after the veggies had softened and let that burn off. I used baby spincach instead of kale b/c my grocery store usually doesn't carry it. My husband had 2 if not 3 bowls of it and I had 2! I am looking forward to the leftovers (not much).

So good, and easy too. My 'I don't like kale' husband and my 11 month old devoured two bowls :) I did use all broth and doubled the garlic. Yum

I've made this soup several times now, and it's always delicious. I like to make a double batch on Sunday, and then I bring it to work all week for lunch. I think it tastes even better the next day. I use turkey kielbasa, all broth (no water), and sometimes add a carrot or two. Spinach substitutes nicely for the kale. Don't leave out the vinegar- it brings the flavors together really well, and adds complexity to what might be just boring lentil soup.

Great soup!! I too, used all chicken broth, added a little more garlic, but, other than that followed the recipe. Actually had someone ask if I had any left over they could take home. This will become a winter staple to use the kale from my garden.

Very hearty winter fare, have made several times since 1st time in November. Suggestions: do double recipe, use just enough sausage for flavor, chop kale very thin as it tends to get stringy (and the longer it's been in the frig the stringier it'll be I read somewhere). Even a 13-year old loved this and went back for seconds -- twice! ;-) PS Forgot this: 1st time used split peas rather than lentils because that's what was in the pantry and as it turns out, we much prefer them though cooking time is considerably longer.

My husband and I really liked this soup! I'm always on the look-out for new things to do with lentils and kale, and this was a delight. I made it vegetarian style, with soy sausage, as someone suggested, and veggie bouillion instead of chicken. I honestly didn't think the soup smelled very good while cooking but the red wine vinegar really pulled the flavors together at the end!

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful hearty soup for a rainy night, and very easy to make. Be generous with the sausage and the vinegar (use a quality balsamic - it'll be worth it), and add the sausage closer to the end rather than with the lentils - the texture and flavor are comprimised by cooking the sausage too long. I also found that it took less time to cook than the recipe indicated, so test partway through simmering!

This is delicious and easy to make. I used andouile sausage and added 6 fresh sage leaves for extra earthy flavor. I also doubled the recipe using 1 cup of lentils (1/2 green and 1/2 red) and 2 cups each of water and broth.

This is my favorite comfort soup and, yes, you can make it as a vegetarian. I have found at a local supermarket (but not at my health food co-op) soy chorizo - talk about flavor! I have made this with kale, collard greens or spinach and it is always fantastic.

This was the most flavorful lentil soup I've ever eaten. I used turkey sausage and added carrots, fresh thyme, crushed red pepper, and red wine. Wow.

Yummm...Almost a 3 1/2 or 4 forker. The only thing I would suggest is to add a little crushed red pepper spice to it...If you think (as I did)it could use the zip. I love Kale and Kielbasa together.

since my husband is not a soup person and he said i can make this again it is a winner for me. perfect way to use red kale from my new garden(at least i think that is what it is) definitely more garlic and add carrot - really give it good color. i did add red wine like one other person suggested and would do that again. i also used two diff sausages (and more than was called for)one was a haberno chicken sausage and it gave it a real nice kick but not too hot because the husband won't eat too hot. i also agree this is not enough for two i nearly doubled it and barely had enough for lunch. served it with some cornbread that i had left over. Great!!

Excellent! Quick, easy, nutritious, and delicious. I doubled all the ingredients (I LOVE leftovers!), and made some minor substitutions/changes. I used 1/2 pound of extra-lean smoked turkey sausage, added 1/2 tsp. of thyme and 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper (we like it spicy!), and used 2 16-oz. cans of low-salt chicken broth with 2 cups of water. I'm adding this one to my standard everyday repertoire, particularly as an easy, fast, cold weather dish. I served the soup with a nice mixed green salad and some whole-grain French bread. Outstanding!

We love this soup, with a few changes. Use all chicken broth and forget the water. Some red wine in addition makes it extra delicious. I used turkey sausage (much more than called for) and just cooked it in the toaster oven whole, then sliced it- much easier than the saute. You can also add more kale. This is just as good as the Portuguese soup I used to make, and much easier.
