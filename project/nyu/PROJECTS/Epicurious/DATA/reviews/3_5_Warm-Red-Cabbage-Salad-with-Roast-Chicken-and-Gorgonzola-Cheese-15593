Delicious! next time I will reduce the oil slightly but no other changes are required for a chewy, crunchy week day meal.

This is a fantastic recipe. I tried cutting the dressing in half but somehow it ended up without enough punch. Everything else I did as directed. It was a lot of chewing, but it is beautiful and very good. Will definitely make again.

With changes, this has become a family favorite side dish with both Thanksgiving turkey and Christmas roast beef. As a side, leave out the chicken and walnuts and use half the dressing amt. and just 3 oz. of the blue cheese. Instead of radicchio, it's prettier to sliver some kind of dark green leaf (kale, spinach, arugula, etc.). And use a crisp Bosc pear. It's delicious, with just the right crunch, color, and taste--and everything was grown locally (at least in November in CT).

Unusual, but surprisingly tasty. The combination of flavors was very satisfying. We also cut back on the amount of dressing and I couldn't find radicchio, so used belgian endive instead.

I raved about this recipe back in November '05. Now I'm back to do so again--because, in the interest of cutting calories, I halved the dressing, the gorgonzola, and the walnuts. Even with these edits, it's still terrific.

This must be a love it or hate it recipe. All the great stuff in it just didn't go together (or maybe, just not the fennel). What a waste of gorgonzola cheese! Yes, it's a healthy dish that takes a long time to chew and I also (like a previous reviewer) served it with butternut squash soup, which was in this same issue and is delicious. Not something I'll be making again.

This recipe makes enough for two one-dish dinners for my husband and me. When I make it the first night, I get all the ingredients ready, but don't cook or assemble one half of the salad. I separately refrigerate the chicken, dressing, and vegies. The next time I make it, it only takes 10 minutes to get the whole thing on the table. Another thing I like about this dish is that you can't eat it quickly. All that cabbage takes a lot of crunching! We have found its a pretty good diet food if you cut back the oil. Unlike tiny portions that you often get when dieting, you can eat a lot of this, it fills you up, and the meal isn't over in three minutes.

Made exactly as the recipe specified, this was an excellent main course for a November lunch that started with butternut squash soup and finished with baked apples for dessert. Salad leftovers were excellent the next day, warmed in the microwave for a minute. What a great way to use up leftover roast chicken!

Very disappointed in this one especially with all of the positive reviews it got. The radiccio gave it a very bitter taste and the combination just didn't do it for us. It was limp (from heating) and lacking in flavor. Threw it away rather than finish it...won't make again.

The radicchio made the salad soooo bitter. The combination not pleasing to our palates. Followed the recipe exactly except cut back on the oil. Very disappointed especially after reading all of the rave reviews. Will not make again.

I was wondering what to do with the red cabbage in my garden and tried this recipe. We had a guest for dinner and we all loved it. This was a great meal for a hot summer night. I bought a store roasted chicken so I didn't have to cook a chicken. Don't leave out the pear -- it adds sweetness. Don't change a thing! I made a sandwich for lunch today. I used the last of the chicken, put it with gorgonzola and red cabbage on a hard roll and put some of the leftover dressing on the roll. This should be as good and interesting as the salad!!

Wow! What a fabulous dish. Wouldn't change a thing and will be making on a regular basis.

Not only WOULD I make this dish again, I already have twice. Getting ingredients at the store for #3. Yum.

OH MY GOSH! This salad is so great! What an amazing combination of flavors. The only substitution I made was to usea little great quality sherry vinegar in addition to the balslmic. As another reviewer said, Granny Smith apples make a great substitution/addition to the pear. I just could not stop eating this. And what a wonderful way to make use of a generic rotisserie chicken from the supermarket!

Great - if you are looking for a way to use leftover chicken this is a good one....easy to improvise with different ingredients, it seems, from others' comments.

This newly discovered recipe has become a huge hit in my household--fast, delicious, and a great way to use leftover roast chicken or turkey. I recommend substituting granny smith apple for the pear, goat cheese for the gorgonzola, and less oil. Also found that tiny matchstick carrots work well when there's no fennel in the house. Bravo!

This was very tasty and an excellent dish to prepare ahead of time (the chopping part only). Store all the chopped ingredients and make the dressing, then refrigerate everything, and it's sauteed in no time for dinner. We like vinegar a lot, so I reduced the olive oil to about 1/3 cup, and it was nice and tangy. I had no radicchio or fennel on hand, but it still turned out wonderfully. It also proved to be a great way of using leftover BBQ chicken.

This is nice. No ripe pears on hand- so I left them out. I think it would have been even better with the paers. I think its even better cold the next day.

Don't be turned off by the smell when you are adding the cheese; it smells like a stinky shoe.But,this is an incredible dish(use half the oil called for).I never review, but I had to for this one!

This was an excellent use of leftover roasted chicken. Next time I'll lighten up on the cabbage (my husband's not a fan) and increase the fennel/onion. I used 1/2 -2/3 cup of oil with fine results; I can't imagine how oily it'd be w/ the full amount! As a main course it serves 3, not 4.

This is really an outstanding salad/meal. Presentation, taste, and ease make it so. I have made it many times and plan on doing it again and again. Have had non-nut, non-blue cheese folks enjoy it too. Ingredients are easy to change around. I agree it can be a bit oily, but it certainly doesn't hurt the taste. Give it a try.

Now THIS me hearties, is a SALAD. Don't be afraid of the 1 cup of oil, you have about 9 cups of ingredients in the salad, so 1 cup of good olive oil is nice.

I thought this was fabulous. My husband who usually hates cabbage, admitted to liking it. I think it would be fabulous if prepared in advance and brought to a picnic. I omitted the pear.

My husband and I are totally addicted to this incredible salad. It is bursting with flavor and texture as well as making a colorful and pretty presentation. Served it with a crisp, white wine and a homemade olive bread. Yum Yum! Try it you'll love it. Did cut back on the oil 1/4 Cup.

I was disappointed with this recipe after reading all the wonderful reviews. I cut the oil in half and still found it too be oily. My mother and I made this together, looking forward to the outcome. Neither of us wished to save this recipe for future use!!
