We made this with a Thai spice blend in place of the coriander (increasing to 1 teaspoon): coriander, red pepper flakes, cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon, garlic, black pepper, basil, cardamom, and cloves. This really brought depth to the flavors, and gave a nice lingering sweet heat. All around enjoyable!

To me this recipe seems to be the opposite of authentic. Butter? Caraway seeds??? "Season OMELET to taste with salt and pepper and serve"? What a laugh!

With a few edits, this was terrific. I used less butter, substituted leeks for onions, added about a cup of bean sprouts, some chili powder and cardamom, and for rice used brown basmati.

I am Indonesian and I think this recipe was slightly better than the other epicurious version of nasi goreng by Sri Owen. Suggestion: use some sweet soysauce (kecap manis), lots of fried shallots, for the brave ones with spicy tongue...use habanero chilis for spicy nasi goreng Indonesian style. We also put sunny side up egg on top off the rice, slices of thin cucumbers and tomatoes to garnish.

Good flavors, could be a little spicier for our tastes, but many will be satisfied as is.
