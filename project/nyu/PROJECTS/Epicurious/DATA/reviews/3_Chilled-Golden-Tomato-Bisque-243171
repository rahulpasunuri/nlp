This tastes like the essence of summer, delicate and absolutely lovely. It was that good even with canned broth; imagine how great it would be with good homemade stuff. Fresh backyard or farmer's market tomatoes are essential. The 2 reviewers who gave this 1 star made it in January and November, no doubt with grocery store tomatoes. No wonder!

simple, perfect and easy. all the flavors compliment and enhance the citrusy, sweet and biting taste of a tomato. Great with farmers market tomatoes on a summers day.

Wasn't very impressed. I love tomatoes but found this too sweet, lacking in tomato flavor and overall not much flavor of any kind worth mentioning. Quick and easy however I've certainly had much better chilled soups that are equally easy. Wouldn't make again without major tweaking.

hmm, i'm torn. while i love nothing more than fresh homegrown tomatoes i'm not sure this is the right platform for them. maybe i was just expecting something a little different. anyway, the soup was a slightly sweet and very creamy, not normally something i would complain about but i've had chilled soups before that were made from fruit and the flavor was more pronounced. i don't think i'll make this again.

Wonderful flavor. I took reviewers advice and used 1 cup broth and only 1/4 cup of cream and heirloom tomatoes. Next time I will add more tomatoes than called for. My result was still thin and a little light in flavor but still really good. Fresh basil as a garnish - a MUST!

I used yellow tomatoes from the farmer's market. If you like the taste of great summer tomatoes, you will love this soup! Probably not a great idea to serve to people not ready for cold soup. Still, delicious.

To the cook from Canada who hadn't heard of Sherry Vinegar. Check out Loblaw's they usually have it--and actually my local convenience store also has it.

I was surprised by how good this is. Almost a smooth, more subtle gazpacho. As others have mentioned, I would cut back on the broth next time. I might also add back a little of the strained out pulp to give the bisque a little more body. And, needless to say, the tomatoes needn't be yellow - though it sure was pretty!

The pure essence of late summer... Would cut back chicken broth a little, added a bit more than a pinch of cayenne. Finished with fresh basis and oregano and a piece of crusty bread.

I forgot to do the fork rating in my last post.

I made this tonight for my husband and myself. While I thought it was quite good it didn't have the WOW factor I was looking for. I didn't have sherry vinegar so used a dry sherry instead and I also cut back the chicken broth to 1 cup. I would serve it again but would try and doctor it up a bit - maybe use less cream.

This was very easy and quite pretty. I liked it well enough but my husband didn't.

I went to the farmer's market yesterday looking for yellow tomatoes to make this. This receipe is so easy and delicious. The only thing I might do differently next time is to decrease the chicken broth so it is not so watery and add more chopped tomatoes and possibly some chopped roasted red peppers. I will definitely make this again.

I thought it was too bland, tasting more of cream than tomatoes. I used heirlooms as someone suggested but if I try it again I'll use a stronger tasting variety. Looked lovely, tasted okay.

Simple. Fast. Delicious. Since the soup wasn't very thick, I served it in large mugs. This would be great as a light lunch served with salad or even a mid-day snack.

Oh my God this is WONDERFUL!! -- absolutely pure "taste of summer". More cayenne NOT necessary; the idea is for the sweet tomato flavor to come through. Fresh basil the PERFECT garnish. And this is SOoo easy!!!!

quick and easy but not hugely exciting. i added a good full tsp of cayenne to give it more of a kick.

Terrific. Added only about 1/3 cup chicken broth since that's all I had. Maybe more of an intense tomato flavor. Perfect for a shot glass presentation.

This soup is the epitome of summer time. I used a lovely heirloom tomato from a local farm stand, and then just followed the recipe from there. This recipe will be quite active in my summer repertoire. While the flavors are nice after a brief chill, this soup is at its top when fully chilled. Enjoy!

Refreshing. I was a little hesitant at first just by tasting the tomato and chicken broth but once everything else was added and chilled it all came together quite well. The fresh basil was a good compliment too.
