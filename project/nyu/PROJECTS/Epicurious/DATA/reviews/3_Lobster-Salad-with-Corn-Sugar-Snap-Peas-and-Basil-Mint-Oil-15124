I have made this recipe a few times, and everyone raves about it. I'm surprised the other reviewer didn't like it. I cannot think of a better way to experience all the freshness and flavor of summer in one dish! I will make this again as part of a summer luncheon buffet.

This was such a waste of lobster, basil and everything else. What a huge dissapointment! no flavor at all. And that basil oil! What a waste of olive oil and basil! Can't say it enough, was not a good salad.
