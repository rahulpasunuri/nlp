This soup appears to have a bad rap on here, but I thought it was really quite delicious--not to mention easy. Used fresh picked squash and zucchini, added a splash of sherry vinegar and obviously salt and pepper to taste. The combination of vermouth and fennel was especially nice. I will make this again.

This soup is fine enough. I made it pretty much as written but added some chopped chard at the end. It's tasty but fine to eat, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again. I don't particularly like squash in soup, although I love fennel and I like the combination of pasta and beans. All of which tempted me to make this.

Tasteless soup, the first Epicurious recipe that I have ever made that was not satisfactory. I am going back into the kitchen to add somethig to this to spice it up.

I made a double batch for a crowd, and ended up adding another quart of broth, a can of tomatoes, and a cup of vermouth -- I thought it was terribly thick as written, especially for reheating. The fennel added an interesting touch, as did the vermouth. Lots of compliments from the crowd.

One of my favorite recipes. I disagree with a previous comment, in that using anise is a must. I've found that penne works best for the pasta as it does not get at all mushy. Stir in fresh basil at the last minute and top with fresh grated parmesean.

I find this recipe rather tasteless. If you want to have pasta with vegetables, there are other great recipies.

I've made this recipe several times and always enjoy it. I usually leave out the fennel as there is a lot of stuff in this one as it is. Substituted dry white wine once for the vermouth, and it came out fine.

I omitted the vermouth and used lots of parmesan - absolutely delicious!

GOOD SOUP FOR A COLD NIGHT . I ADDED A DASH OF HOT PEPPER FLAKES AND OMITTED THE VERMOUTH. VERY GOOD
