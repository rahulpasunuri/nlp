I was completely prepared to hate this (I had never had kippers before), but it was so good! Smoky and rich and delicious.

A little bland and the heavy cream made me feel guity about eating it, but it was a warm and hearty dish on a cold and rainy day (and I had most of the ingredients on hand), so I'll probably make it again. I had to cook it an extra 5-10 minutes to get the potatoes soft.

Tasty and simple. Will definitely make again.
