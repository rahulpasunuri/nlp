i did something i NEVER DO... i tried a recipe without a stellar rating. it was a risk for this reason AND the fact that the baking directions were poor. regarding the recipe itself, i added a teaspoon more cocoa powder and a half teaspoon more coffee powder than was called for. tasting the finished product, i'm glad i did, but next time, will scale the sugar back by 1/8 cup. as for the baking time, i checked them at two hours, and they were definitely done- crispy throughout. they did not need to spend extra time in the oven as it cooled down. the cookies actually turned out quite good, considering the recipe was a shot in the dark.
