I doubled this and took it to a bridal shower I was catering. I took two large loaves of Sara Lee pound cake and a side bowl of mixed berries. i split the sliced of pound cake in half to double the pieces and it worked out great. Even my hardcore Italian friends loved it!

Made this for a picnic with friends. Followed recipe almost exactly, except I used hazelnuts instead of pistachios. While the recipe is nothing spectacular, it's quick and easy. People can choose how much topping and berries they want, and the toasted pound cake makes it seem fancier than if it was just plain and untoasted. As for the mascarpone spread, it was very tasty, none to sweet, and complemented the berries well. When all the cake was gone, one of my friends was literally eating the cheese mixture out of the tupperware with a spoon! I'd definitely make again in a pinch!
