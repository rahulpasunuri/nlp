This cornbread is okay if you are making stuffing or dressing. For serving as bread however, it is unpalatably dry. Take note that, compared to other buttermilk corn bread recipes on this site, this recipe has less liquid and "wet" ingredients, resulting in the dry, crumbly texture--which is for dressings, but not the best option out there.

The recipe works fine, but the brad didn't have the whiz-bang I expected. I'm sure there are better recipes, particularly if one prefers a sweeter corn bread.

I lost this recipe and am so glad to have found it on Epicurious. It's one of my old standbys. One of the ones you want to keep forever. Delicious.
