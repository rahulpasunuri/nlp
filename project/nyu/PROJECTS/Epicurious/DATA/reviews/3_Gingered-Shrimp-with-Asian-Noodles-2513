This was rather simple to make. My husband said it was yummy. I didn't have green onions so I omitted. I did add shredded carrot and bamboo shoots and it gave it good texture and the carrots made it look pretty. Also added 2TBS Hoisin Sauce and 2TBSP of Low Sodium Soy Sauce to my sauce and omitted the corn starch like the others.

Arrow root is a good sub for cornstarch for those that don't like it. Nice recipe, I'd make it again.

For those poo pooing cornstarch; cook it! It loses all discernable taste when it cooks and the sauce turns clear. To improve recipe, I flash seared the shrimp to caramelize before adding the liquid. Also, adding 1-2tbs soy sauce is a must. Next time I garnish with chopped peanuts for taste and crunch; it will then taste a lot like a quicky version of Pad thai.

We loved this, and it was quite simple to prepare. I didn't use the cornstarch because we are not fans, but otherwise followed the recipe. We'll certainly make it again.

For those who don't like cornstarch, but would like to thicken this, use rice flour in place of the cornstarch. It will have the same thickening effect and makes a smooth sauce without that starchy taste.

I decided before making the dish that soy sauce was missing from the ingredients. I added 2 T of soy sauce. It was pretty good. I used sea bass that I had marinated in the sauce instead of shrimp, then grilled the sea bass. That worked out okay. What I did not like about the recipe was that the fish and the noodles, both with sauce on them tasted too similar. Maybe I made a mistake putting sauce on the noodles.

can't stand the taste and aftertaste of cornstarch so skipped it. Still pretty good.
