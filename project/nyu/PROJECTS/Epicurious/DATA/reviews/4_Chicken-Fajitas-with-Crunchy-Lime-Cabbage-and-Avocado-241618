Delicious, bright, enjoyed the textural component. Everyone raved. Love this alternative to the more traditional fajita!

So good! I thought it would be good, but didn't expect it to be great. I brined my chicken the night before (intact), and then threw them in the marinade before work (after cutting them into strips), and let them marinate in the fridge all day. I threw in the vegetables about 45 minutes before I cooked it all off. Added sour cream and guacamole as well as the cabbage and avocado mix and it was delicious!

The lime cabbage is a superb accompaniment for chicken fajitas. I don't think I'll ever use plain old lettuce for this kind of recipe again! The cabbage salad is a really refreshing dish to use as a side on its own. Perfect to pair with grilled meat or fish as well.

This was really beautiful from the variety of colors... red pepper, purple onion, green avocado. It's not the most delicious (or authentic) Tex-Mex, but for the ease and speed with which it comes together, I'll make it repeatedly. I like to follow the instructions the first time I make it, and then make changes after trying it. (I did add some tomatoes and manchego to the final product this time, and would do again.) I only marinated the chicken an hour, it would be better if it were longer. Also, I found the chicken to be WAY too oily, I'd cut it with some lime juice or vinegar next time. I love the idea of cumin and more garlic (maybe fajita seasoning?), and will try that, or will substitute another marinade. I thought the cabbage salsa was great, it made the dish; I wouldn't change a thing about it.

I will never eat shredded lettuce again after making the slaw in this recipe. Easy, quick, and delicious fajitas. My family likes garlic, so I added a few more cloves.The slaw also works well with fish tacos.

Made this for my mom and I, we both liked it. I added cumin to the chicken like the other reviews suggested, I used bagged cole slaw starter instead of red cabbage, and I used lettuce instead of tortillas. I also subbed out 2T of plain fat free yogurt for the olive oil in the slaw to make the dish weight watchers friendly. I had some mango so I sliced it and put in in the slaw as well. Mango worked out really well, and the whole dish was very yummy!

Made this with home-grown red cabbage last year--so good, could not wait until the cabbage ripened again this year. If you are not a garlic fan, just omit it--works a-ok; ditto for onion. But, do not omit the lime peel--mucho importante. To the marinade for chicken, I add 1/4 chopped small hot pepper, dash cayenne, sprinkle of paprika, 1/4 tsp salt and grinding of black pepper. To the marinade for cabbage, I add 1/4 chopped small hot pepper, 1/4 tsp salt and grinding of black pepper. Multigrain or whole wheat soft medium sized tortilla work well. Left-over cabbage makes good salad the next day.

These fajitas are absolutely amazing. We roast a pasture-raised chicken for one meal and use the leftover meat pieces for fajitas the following 2 nights. I will never do anything else with the leftover meat after roasting a chicken. This recipe is to die for.

This was pretty good. For the fajitas, I added extra garlic and cumin, and I also threw in some red bell pepper. The cabbage salad was very nice and light. Unfortunately, I didn't have any avocado, but after making this, I think guacamole would add some extra flavor. I also used less oil than the recipe called for. All in all, pretty good.

This is a summer staple and I find myself making it again and again. Fresh flavours, quick and easy, healthy, it's got it all!

I thought this was fabulous pretty much just the way the recipe reads. My family loved it and asked me to make it again soon. I used Napa cabbage instead of red cabbage, and I used guacamole instead of an avocado. I put out some pico de galo and sour cream and shredded cheese for those who wanted it. This will be staple in our household!!!

This was relatively quick & easy &, most importantly, yummy. Followed the recipe except used green instead of red cabbage and added some cumin & liquid smoke to the chix & veg marinade. Everyone enjoyed very much & we will be making all summer long for BBQs!

One more note - the day after. Next time, I'm going to make the cabbage a day ahead so that it has time to marinate in the lime juice, etc. It was even better for lunch!

This was great. I did add some lime juice, cilantro and spices to the chicken marinade, but left the cabbage dressing alone, except for 1 T. of sugar. As someone who loves traditional fajitas - cheese, salsa, sour cream, etc. - I thought these might not do it for me, but they turned out to be a great, healthy alternative than the usual recipe.

Great looking and tasting dish, with a few changes. Cabbage was rated as bland, so I added 1 Tbsp sugar, 1 pressed garlic clove, 1/4 chopped serrano pepper (no seeds), a dash each of onion powder, celery salt, salt, and pepper. To the chicken marinade add 2 Tbsp chopped cilantro, juice of 1 lime, 1/4 of a chopped serrano pepper, dash of paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper.

My fiance and I made this recipe for a family dinner and it was a hit. The red cabbage salad was the star of the meal. I took other reviewers advice and added cumin and cayenne to the marinade but still felt it lacked in flavor. We will probably try out a different marinade next time. The salad will definitely become a staple.

Added cumin powder and extra garlic but this was still tasteless...

This was fabulous! I hate to review a recipe I didn't follow exactly, but the only thing I added was a T of cumin, garlic salt and onion powder to the marinade. To the cabbage salsa I added one diced tomato but, other than that, I stayed true to this unbelievably tasty recipe.

My husband ate 3 servings worth, which probably wasn't the point of this healthy meal, but it was a hit. For the next batch, we doubled the cabbage recipe for extra filling and crunch. So good, would eat that as a side salad by itself.

Yum! Easy and very satisfying. First time I made it, my husband didnt eat the cabbage in the first helping since he "isnt a fan of red cabbage". I convinced him to try his seconds with the cabbage and he was sold! Now everytime I make it, he piles the cabbage on! Excellent recipe.

This is good but 6 T of oil is ridiculous. 1 T for marinating the chicken is plenty. There is no need to put any in the slaw, and 1 T to grill the chicken/veggies is plenty. I added 1 t cumin, a few shakes of hot sauce and a dash of chipolte powder to the veggie saute. It was really great. Light, flavorful and pretty healthy when you omit most of the oil.

Rating: 1
Pretty simple to make especially if you buy pre-chopped onions and cabbage but bland. We let it marinate for a couple of hours and the flavor just wasn't there. Flank steak may have been better but it definitely needs flavor from someplace other than chili powder.

Simple and delicious, I made this for my Boomer mom and dad who were skeptical since it was made with chicken and not skirt steak. They ended up loving it and helping themselves to seconds. I pulled the chicken from the grill early and let the peppers and onions carmelize before serving with the chicken.

This was a delicious, easy recipe. We grilled the chicken and veggies. I had a yellow pepper and onion so, I added them too. My husband wasn't totally sold on the cabbage, but I liked the crunchiness and the cilantro taste. We used guacamole instead of avocado. You could make this for guests.

Yuck. Even with the extra ingredients it was still bland.

I, like other reviewers, souped up the spices with extra garlic, cumin and cayenne. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It disappeared pretty quickly at dinner and I'll use it for guests, as well.

yum yum yum. This was delicious and easy! My boyfriend agreed that it was good, but being the traditionalist that he is, he went back to plain old salsa and cheese for his second helping. "more like a wrap than a fajita" I believe were his words. Excellent for lunch!

How easy can delicious be?! The flavors and textures come together perfectly! I did substitue some chipotles for the chile powder as we like it hot. Fabulous!

Fabulous flavors in this great one dish meal. I added yellow pepper with the red pepper to make the colors pop. Using whole grain tortillas and far less olive oil (3 tbspns)to make this healthier.

This is fantastic and became an instant "classic"! Made it already several times for family, as well as for a dinner party, everybody loved it!

Made tonight - very quick and easy. slaw is refreshing - and a good alternative. Added a touch of hot red pepper paste and 1/2 habanero pepper to the marinade. the other 1/2 pepper went into the slaw. Not a fan of cilantro -subbed with fresh parsley - great. Easy weeknight meal.

This recipe has some good things about it..the lime and cilantro cabbage topping was good. Unfortunately the chicken marinade needed more spices in general. I may try again with a lot more garlic, some lime juice and some cumming in the marinade.

These were amazing! My friend and I made them for a dinner party - everyone was in love. Tip: double the ingredients if you're serving a party of four.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. The slaw would be great by itself. Simple enough for every day but colorful and tasty enough to share with friends.

As chili powder is the main spice the flavor is not complex but its a good simple colorful combo. I might add more onions and red peppers next time

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. My husband doesn't like cabbage but with the limes to sweeten it up, it was a hit. I did use less olive oil than stated and I was glad I did. I used 2 Tbs for the cabbage and that was plenty.

After this was tweeked, it turned out fabulous- adding lime juice, cilantro, honey and chopped scallion to chicken, and omitting chili powder, but using a taco seasoning pack instead. Also added a little honey to the cabbage.

This recipe is a hit with my family, including the kids! It's great for a gathering - so easy to upsize and it proved to be a crowd pleaser. We served it with avocado, sharp, grated cheddar and crema. And an accidental condiment: I had sliced an orange as an easy, nutritious side dish, but some of us thought it was meant as a fajita topping. In fact, it was a FABULOUS flavor addition and the next time I made it that way on purpose.

This was very good. More seasoning was needed for the chicken - it was a little bland. We love lime in our house, so added a ton more than recipe called for. I added a fraction of the oil - there is no need for the amt. called for in the recipe. My husband and I agreed that this recipe would be delish with a nice flaky white fish, all placed into a foil packet, and grilled. Overall, a def. winner - we'll tweak it more next time.

Tried this and was not blown away. The chicken had no flavor at all (and we used good chili powder) and the slaw was almost inedible it was so bitter. Could have been the cabbage was bad, but even without the slaw this barely qualifies for a single fork rating.

excellent...I added an additional squeeze of lime onto the chicken and veggies while on the griddle.

This recipe was one of the quickest and tastiest ways I have ever made fajitas. Cooking the meat and peppers on a griddle kept the mixture tender and juicy.The cabbage slaw was a bit too lime-tart, so I added a bit of honey to sweeten it up a bit. All in all it was a crowd pleaser.

Yummy! Easy, very flavorful, and lots of veggies. I used whole wheat tortillas, and guacamole instead of avocado because I had some and it worked well. No other changes to recipe, but the next time I may try to reduce the oil used.
