I was looking for a savory pumpkin soup reminiscent of one I had about 30 years ago in Bahrain. This looked like a good bet. Based on reviews, I added a diced red potato to cook in the broth for thickening. I used all chicken broth instead of part water. Since I had fresh pie pumpkin on hand, I used that instead of canned boiling it in the liquid. Added a bit of turmeric with the spices and used cayenne instead of red pepper flakes. Omitted mustard seeds and curry leaves. This version of the soup more than fulfilled my expectations. It will become one of my fall staple soups when fresh pumpkin is available!

Didn't add the curry leaves and mustard seeds because I didn't have them. I added another quarter of the roasted pumpkin, 2 peeled and diced granny smith apples, 2t curry powder, and 1/3c brown sugar. Blended it, then added another can of full-fat coconut milk when I was ready to reheat. Served with a hearty salad, warm bread, and Stonehedge cabernet. It was delish! 12/12/11 (I made the soup yesterday and reheated it slowly this evening.) Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Curried-Pumpkin-Soup-232968#ixzz1gNzsUfJi

I loved this soup. It has been a long time since a recipe surprised and delighted me and frying the popping mustard seeds did it for me. You do not need all the oil, though. I think half would have been enough. For those who found it bland, add more salt, you ninnies. That is what bland means - lacking salt. And pumpkin is a salt hog. It is not watery. If your soup was watery you must have measured something incorrectly. When I tasted before letting it simmer for a half hour, the taste was thin. It really needs that cook time for the spices, ginger and garlic to flavor the broth. I would also add that next time I will remove the onions before sauteeing the ginger and garlic. I used a relly large stock pot, but it was not wide enough to really let the three ingredients sweat out their flavors when cooked together. Nothing is a substitute for curry leaves. Look them up on the food dictionary feature of this site. That said I didn't have any curry leaves and I still liked the recipe. I used sage instead.

delicious - i had all the ingredients and added one more clove of garlic - we're korean and love garlic! i also used black mustard greens instead of brown, - i think the curry leaves and mustard seed for the spicy taste was a must! we also made it vegetarian and made with vegetable stock - lecker!

This soup was incredible! I read over the reviews before making, and this was the end result: I added NO water, and I excluded the mustard seeds and curry leaves. I roasted a real, organic pumpkin, and toasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds) as a garnish. I added 1 granny smith apple and 3/4 cup dark brown sugar. I also added a bit of my own Indian spices: tumeric and garam masala. Delicious!!

Added some carrots since the pumpkin was fresh and didn't bake up very deeply colored or 'pumpkiny' and based on the reviews didn't add the water but increased the chicken stock. Delicious complex flavor.

We didn't have curry leaves, so we eliminated the last step. Also, we didn't add the water and decided to serve it over rice. we tasted it at the end it added more salt, some brown sugar and curry powder (I know curry powder has nothing to do with curry leaves). the final product was ok, but our 5 and 4 year old loved it and slurped it right up. All the same, we probably wouldn't go out of our way to make it again.

I've made it twice and have decided that this soup is just not really good. Too watery and bland. It needs more something - structure? I don't know, but I think I've given up on this recipe.

This soup was bland, even after I added more spices, salt, and sweet potato since I didn't have another can of pumpkin. I will try it again and leave out the water so it isn't so thin or bland.

I got halfway through the recipe when I realized that it called for 2 cans of pumpkin and I only had one. I was afraid it would be too spicy, since i used the full amount of the spices and half pretty much everything else. I put in 2 cups of broth and a whole can of coconut milk, but no water. My blender didn't do a very good job getting it to a smooth puree, so next time I will probably run it through a sieve. Still, it was very good and I will definitely try it again.

I read nearly all the reviews before trying this one. When I saw the one about adding an apple I was hooked. I used a small Granny Smith, which after tasting the bitterness from the skin I think I'll either peal it or use a yellow apple next time. I knew better not to add any water, just one cup of chicken broth. I also 1/4 can of coconut cream with added sugar which made for an excellent sweet and spicy dish. Great recipe to play around with!

I am baffled by other reviews. This soup is on the thin side for sure, but the flavor is wonderful. I waited to add the water bc of the what everybody wrote, but I ended up adding it bc I thought that it was too creamy for my liking. I also used light coconut milk and I am glad that I did bc again I don't like super creamy tastes. This soup is light and intense at the same time and I would definitely make it again. Oh and I added a squeeze of lemon and I was excellent.

This was my first disappointment with Epicurious.com. Found the soup to be quite thin and watery and virtually tasteless. Will stick with the family all-time favorite, Southwestern pumpkin soup.

I made the soup exactly as is (since I do a lot of Indian cooking, I even had the curry leaves on hand). Also used fresh pumpkin from my garden. I thought it was quite tasty. Certainly delicate - no question about that; but tasty nonetheless.

I wasn't satisfied with this recipe at first, and so I ended up changing the spices a great deal before I was through. The KEY addition, though, that transformed it from mediocre to excellent, was one apple.

This is a recipe I'll repeat making. I hadn't the coconut milk, but half and half made a delicious substitute. Nor had I curry leaves, so I used ground spice. It was a delicious result.

I agree with others who felt this recipe doesn't work as is. IF I would make this again, I would cut out the water, except to add as needed at the end. I used 4 cups chicken stock and a little water to get the right consistency. I would also increase the coconut milk. As for the spices, I also agree that the soup has an off-taste. Probably curry powder instead would work fine. Re the curry leaves: Curry powder is not a substitute, as the powder is a personal blend of spices. Curry (keri)leaves are from a plant which has no connection to the spice blend.

Liked this, will make it again, it's not awe-inspiring, but a nice change. I made this with fresh pumpkin, and substituted 2 teaspoons garam masala and 1 teaspoon curry powder for the other dried spices. Omitted the last step with olive oil, curry leaves, and mustard seeds completely. Come out a bit on the thin side, but is great with some hearty bread.

This soup was a total hit!!!(I also used only 4 cups of water). I had 10 friends over for dinner and everyone wanted more. I did not add the curry leaves and mustard grains either, and used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.

Rating: 3
This soup was delicious! However, I used 4 cups of vegetable broth instead of the recommended 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and 30 oz. of oven-roasted pumpkin instead of the canned stuff. I disagree with the raters who said this recipe calls for too much liquid -- I followed their instructions and started out with about 4 cups of vegetable broth, but the soup was much too thick and I added quite a bit of water while pureeing the soup (At least 3-4 cups of water). However, it is possible that my version of the recipe needed more water because I used fresh pumpkin. I will definitely make this again -- I am curious to see how curry leaves will change the flavor.

Served this as my Thanksgiving first course and everybody LOVED it. I did modify the recipe based on the comments I read. Here's what I did: First I used six cups of (regular salted) chicken stock and no water. I think that would solve most of the problems with the recipe. I also accidentally put in too much pumpkin so there was likely around 3 1/2 cups. I omitted the cumin, cardamom and corriander and used a friends family curry blend instead. After pureeing, I ran the soup through a fine sieve which gave it a great silky consistency. Finally, since the soup was so yummy, I omitted the last step with the mustard seeds and curry leaves (although they do exist - I got some at my local Indian grocery). With a few tweaks, this recipe is dynamite.

I think there was a typo - 7 cups of water was too much - I used 4 cups, then added perhaps a cup after I pureed it and achieved the consistency as it is pictured in the magazine. I too, could not find curry leaves, so added some curry powder to the soup. Also topped it with a dollop of Creme Fraiche. Very good, but not as good as the Butternut Squash soup with Goat Cheese Croutons on this site - that recipe is 4 stars +.

Today is the day after Thanksgiving. I served the Curried Pumpkin Soup with all the alterations as mentioned below and with reservations. My nephew had four bowls, a friend had three bowls and everyone else thought it was great so if anyone wants my recipe...............

I added very little water, and about two cups of chicken broth. The soup was lovely and thick, and I waited to add a little water after I pureed it. I couldn't find curry leaves so used ground curry added with the other spices. It's quite spicy and I swirled a bit of sour cream into each serving. Wonderful and easy soup, and one I will make often.

The only good thing about this recipe is that I had the good sense to make it a day before Thanksgiving! If I had waiting until the last minute I would be even more disappointed. The recipes that I find in Gourmet are usually very reliable but this one definitely fell short. After following the recipe to the letter, I was rewarded with a bland, tasteless broth that couldn't be doctored into anything usable. I will have to say that the only change to the recipe was the substitution of bay leaves for the curry leaves. Maybe I am somewhat ignorant in this category, but I could not locate fresh Curry leaves anywhere. I tried several local gourmet shops and specialty stores, and even searched through numerous cook books for some help to no avail. After contacting an Indian friend of mine did I find help. According to my friend, there is no such thing as "Curry Leaves", as this is the American version of Indian Kari Leaves. Even after a trip to my local Indian market I was left without the necessary ingrediant. Using a tip from the Indian grocer, I substituted bay leaves. Unfortunately this still did not help this recipe. I just hope that the recipe for the Rosemary-wine-cranberry jelly turns out better as I have already made it and haven't tested it yet!

I nearly gagged when I took my first taste. Instead of throwing it away, I tried to salvage it by pouring in a cup of white wine. Sorry to say it didn't make a difference. I was a little upset at first, because I followed the direction and spent my valuable time to cook the darn thing. Anyways, at least I put the rest of the wine to good use and slept like a baby.

What a crazy dish. Half the reviewers LOVED it and the half HATED it. Gourmet really tries all the recipes in the mag??? Someone goofed here. Followed the recipe exactly then tasted it - blah! So I started adding salt - lots, then it needed some kind of sweetness so I added sugar, then another can of coconut milk. If I had some curry powder on hand I would have added more. More crushed red pepper. I had a lot invested in this soup and didn't want to give up then I noticed the bowl of beautiful apples from the Farmer's Market and diced up an apple and threw that it - now we got something. I'm not going to strain it - give it some texture and then on Thursday I'll do the mustard seed thing. Someone obviously messed up here. Hope someone really tried the two hour turkey and the Brussels sprouts with chestnuts and the sweet potatoes with lime syrup! Have a great Thanksgiving everyone!

This was delicious--reminded me of good Indian food with a hint of Thai soups. I made it without any changes except that I used fresh pumpkin from two small sugar pumpkins that I microwaved until tender. It came out about as thick as a cream bisque--not watery at all. Will definitely make again.

Thin and boring... Pretty tasteless. I added more salt which didn't help much. Finally I microwaved a potato in chicken broth then added it, cooked it for awhile and pureed it into the soup.

To cook from Spain: I stand corrected! Just came across a recipe for Fresh Pumpkin Puree (on this site) that states 8 lbs. of fresh pumpkin is required to make 4 cups of cooked pumpkin puree. This curried pumpkin soup recipe asks for 31/2 cups canned pumpkin, so guess I should not have been so quick in suggesting you would need 3 lbs. fresh pumpkin to yield that amount of cooked pumpkin. My sincere apologies if you heeded my advice and did not have enough pumpkin. Rather than relying on my own judgement/experience, I should have done some research before offering a suggestion. So sorry!

I agree there was too much water. I ended up using 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. Also, I pureed it with a hand immersion blender and that thickened it up some. I also subsituted a teaspoon of curry powder for the curry leaves. Loved the Indian flavor of it.

This soup is delicious. Was a little spicy, so we added some heavy cream to calm down the heat. You could do it with milk as well. We loved it and so did our friends at our dinner party!

I made this before reading the reviews and found, like others, that there was obviously a mistake in the amount of water called for. I added extra ginger along with sour cream to thicken. Like others, I substituted curry powder for curry leaves. If other flavors are well-balanced, I suggest going light on the curry powder as it can be overwhelming. I toasted the mustard seeds in oil but in the future would do as another reader suggested and toast them dry. I will make it again with modifications along these lines, and hope recipes presented here will be better tested in the future.

I made 1/2 recipe since I had only one can of pumpkin on hand. The 7 cups water must be a typo. I used 1 can broth, 1/2 can coconut milk and 1 cup water. Way too bland, so added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 clove. Much better. I tell people that if they find the clove in their serving, they can make a wish on it. Love that it's so quick.

I read all the reviews and amended accordingly! I roasted 6lbs fresh pumpkin, as suggested, and added 2 tablespoons of medium curry powder at the same time as the other spices instead of the last three ingredients. I doubled the amount of chicken broth and reduced the water to 4 cups which resulted in a great consisitency for that quantity of fresh pumpkin. The end result was delicious. Thank you everyone for your comments - this recipe is full of flavour and was well worth re-working.

Made this last night and it was excellent - thick and creamy with a beautiful colour and very tasty. I heeded the reviews about this soup being thin/watery so reduced the water to 6 cups and increased pumpkin to 4 cups and also simmered an additional 20 min. before pureeing. Added 1 tbsp. curry powder at the same time as the other spices. I did not use the olive oil (unnecessary) but instead toasted the mustard seeds in a dry skillet, then added them along with 2 tbsps. sesame oil and the juice/fine zest of 1 lime (seemed like natural go-withs for the other ingredients). Resulted in outstanding flavour! To the cook from Spain: since this recipe asks for 30 oz. canned pumpkin (almost 2 lbs. or approx. 900 grams) I think you would probably have to bake/roast 3 lbs. of fresh pumpkin to make up for the weight loss of rind/seeds and water/moisture lost during cooking. To cook from New York: sweetened coconut milk is generally used for desserts rather than savoury dishes. I think it may make this soup overly sweet, but perhaps you prefer it that way? I have another pumpkin soup recipe that includes apples and dried apricots, so is much sweeter than this one but is also lovely. Cheers!

For the cook in Spain, a US can of pumpkin is usually 15 oz (about 425 grams) of puree. I'm not sure what amount of fresh pumpkin would yield 15 oz.

I really wish I'd read other reviews prior to making this tonight and cut down on the water. This soup just did not have enough of a 'body' for me. I ended up adding a bit more coconut milk and sour cream but it still wasn't enough. It was too thin after 1/2 hour so I ended up letting it simmer for almost 1 1/2 hours. Maybe if I'd roasted a fresh sugar pumpkin like someone suggested rather than using canned... I don't know. This is my first negative review on this site as usually everything turns out pretty great. And I love pumpkin flavoured anything. Just not this soup. P.S. I followed this recipe exactly as written.

Good - I also didn't puree the soup (mostly because I'm lazy and didn't want to do the extra dishes), but I probably would if I were making it for someone other than just my husband or myself. I also didn't add the mustard seed/curry leaf combination, and used Penzey's curry powder - really good and added a little more spice. Easy to make, and yummy. Great with a grilled cheese, tomato and bacon sandwich. *It was quite a bit thinner than I anticipated...I might either simmer it for way more than 30 minutes, or add some sort of a thickener.

While this apparently had wonderful robust flavors, it had much too much water in the recipe and needed to be reduced to get the full flavor. I ended up adding a little fish sauce to mellow it out, and if I were to make it again, I would also add a squeeze of lime.

Haven't made this yet but it looks like a great recipe. I made a soup similiar to this one for a restaurant I used to worked at. I suggest you buy some of those mini pumpkins and roast them off in the oven instead of using canned pulp. Cut the little pumpkins in half and remove the seeds. Rub them with olive oil and bake on a sheet pan at 375 for about 30-45 minutes or until just tender and slightly caramalized. You'll get a much richer, burst-of-autumn flavor. I serve this as a warm and soothing first course for Thanksgiving dinner. Enjoy!
