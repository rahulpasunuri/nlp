Prior reviews were helpful. I used Demerara sugar, 1tsp salt, and 3/4c whole wheat flour combined with unbleached flour. I handmixed dough, which felt like pizza dough. I warmed my convection oven to 200 degrees, then turned it off and added dough under damp towel for proofing. Total rise time was 2.5hrs. The aroma was like a midwest German bakery! Well worth the wait, but I think I prefer my fruit on top of the dough. Back to the kitchen!

I really liked this coffee cake. There could be some serious time constraints, but we did the first rise and the assembly the night before and did the final rise overnight in the refrigerator. The next morning, we only had to bake and we LOVED it. I did use turbinado sugar instead of granulated white sugar due to being out, maybe this made the cake better than some others' experience?

Careful! The last line of this recipe says that it needs to be eaten that day and will keep, covered "up to one day." My rising time was four hours total, with twenty minutes of prep, thirty minutes of baking and a ten minute rest. It's delicious, but you need to have a serious game plan in place for when you're going to be eating this.

This really was not texturally different nor did it taste different than a standard (and easier) quick bread recipe. Also, I made it with peaches, and the lemon was overpowering. Use the fresh pineapple upside down cake recipe from last year, and substitute peaches, for much better results.

This is a nice, unusual dessert, with a great taste, but you have to be very careful about the baking time, because the method of testing whether the cake is done by inserting a toothpick or wooden skewer just doesn't work well for this dough (it is so tight, and so buttery, that, even when it is wet it the dough will often not stick to a wooden skewer). Things that will necessitate an increased cooking time include using even a little too much fruit (adds too much water to the dough), or allowing the dough to rise too much before baking (it takes the heat longer to penetrate the volume). So the bottom line is, without a little practice, this cake can come out quite undercooked on the fruit-covered side.

this turned out excellent. i used peaches instead of plums. one weird thing, though, was a strange bitter aftertaste the topping had. otherwise, it was very well received by my guests and there was not a crumb left.

I used nectarines instead of plums but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.This was very pretty but I didn't like the texture of this sweet bread. It was more like a quick bread than a yeast dough.
