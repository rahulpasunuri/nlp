I was surprised how much I liked this. The flavors are fresh and delicious. I'd definitely make again.

Yes, this dish is time consuming to prepare with all of the chopping. However, it's well worth it and has always been a hit at BBQs. I suggest adding chopped red onion and fresh lime zest and juice to taste. Substitute sesame oil for the vegetable oil and definitely increase the amount of chile paste, to taste. I also added chopped orange, which really compliments the flavours well and makes this dish more interesting. yum!

I cut the rice vinegar in half (used "seasoned") and added lime juice to match the measurements, used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and added minced serano chili since everyone said it lacked the punch with the chili paste. This helped a bit. Nice refreshing chilled salad with color.

Slicing, dicing or chopping jicama is no picnic, so I used a large hole grater. The texture was still crunchy and crisp. I also used more than 1/4 teaspoonful of chili paste, even though I don't like my food too hot. The next time I'm going to try pineapple vinegar.

Definitely needed more chili paste as noted below. This recipe required a lot more chopping than the results merit. I added a little sesame oil but still felt it lacked something.

Definitely needs a bunch more chili paste, but the base is good. I like this combo of veggies.

My husband liked this more than I. I thought it lacked interest however the crunchy texture was good. After mixing all the ingredients I let it sit an hour. Also, I used 1 tsp of the chili paste which enhanced the flavor but the slaw was still mild.

This is good, although I would suggest making it a day ahead of time. The flavor is a lot better. Also, I needed to use a lot more chili paste than called for due to the lack of zest it had.
