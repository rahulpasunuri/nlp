I have been making this recipe ever since it came out in Gourmet's IN SHORT ORDER cookbook. Kids love it, and my neighbors stop by to see what smells so good when I make this. As one reviewer advised use fresh pepper corns! It makes a huge difference.

Served the salmon on a bed of my favorite greens - red leaf, upland cress and spinach - with a miso vinaigrette. Also added shreds of carrots and diced cucumbers. Family loved it!

I've made this dish many times. I love it. Personally, however, I like to use less EVOO, I find that the amount the recipe calls for makes it a little too oily. A little EVOO goes a long way! I highly recommend this recipe!!

this recipe was so delicious, it has become my all time favorite way to prepare salmon. It is better than ordering it at a restaurant.

Cooking the fish on my George Foreman grill for about 5-6 minutes results in perfectly cooked fish! If it is ever undercooked, finishing the fish in the microwave is quick and easy and maintains the succulence of the fish.

I have been making this recipe ever since it came out in the magazine. Recently I can get excellent fresh king salmon, and the fillets always come with the skin on. Today instead of removing the skin, I broiled the fillet. Marinated it as usual, pushed peppercorns (coarsest grind on Kirkland disposable grinder) into the meat side. Drizzled meat side with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Put skin side down on foil on broiler pan in preheated broiler, 4 inches from heat, broiled for 9 minutes without turning. Reduce time for thinner fillets. Easier, and just as delicious.

I would probably make this again because it was very easy to make but I found it rather bland, even given all the pepper seasoning. I didn't find that the marinade added much to the flavour of the salmon.

This is a simple and delicious way to prepare salmon. I've served many a guest that swore they didn't like salmon. This recipe changed their mind. Note: It's been my experience that the fish always takes longer to cook than the recipe says. Keep this in mind as you plan your meal

WOW! I debated about making this dish, as I just wasn't sure how the flavours would blend. I really wanted to try something different though, and the reviews were so positive that I gave it a try. It turned out to be really good! My husband and I loved it. I did add a little ginger, reduced the oil, and finished the salmon in the oven, but I'm sure it would be just as good without these minor changes! We will absolutely make again.

I make this a staple for dinner parties even when serving meat also. I consistently get the comment the 'it's the best salmon I've ever eaten'! I marinate it for several hours, I think it gets a little bit of a gravlox type of cure, then serve it very seared on the outside and VERY rare on the inside. I do make sure to buy top quality salmon but farm raised is fine as long as it's very fresh. The ease of cooking, the beautiful presentation and the taste make this a winner!

Excellent! I made this over a year ago, forgot about it, but my husband reminded me of it, saying that this was the best salmon he ever had. When I made it tonight, I used half soy sauce and half teriyaki sauce, which highlighted the warm sweetness of the marinade.

It was fast, simple, and sublime. Only changes: I left it marinating for most of the day and had to cook it a bit longer than the recommended time. Other than that, fantastic. I served it with jasmine rice and a tri-color pepper & shiitake mushroom & ginger sautee. Yummy.

I was tiring of salmon, but this recipe made me like it again. It was amazing ... I served it with jasmine rice, and baby bok choy sauted in chicken broth and butter. The few ingredients make it really quick and easy to make ... I will definitely make this dish again.

In an attempt to go through old Gourmet magazines, I came across this recipe which seemed "too good to be true." We are "salmon lovers" and couldn't believe anything this easy could be this good! I did have to saute the salmon a minute longer on each side, but that was the only problem I had. This is a true keeper - so easy and so delicious. I served it with a Lemon Rice and salad - just perfect!

Excellent. Great dish to prepare when you have an unexpected house guest. Ingredients are usually on hand and is very quick to prepare. Salmon comes out delicious with a mild kick.

Very good, quick and easy. After finishing the salmon, I make a quick sauce at the end with reduced white wine, chicken stock (or fish stock, if you have it), and a little ginger (grated or dried). Finish the sauce with a little whole butter.

What a fantastic recipe! It's so incredibly tasty, and relatively easy to put together. It goes very well w/ the wok-seared sesame green beans (http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=107878) . Be sure to grind your pepper COARSELY...the chunkier the better!!

I'm not a salmon fan, but I have to say this is the best salmon recipe I've ever tasted. I recommended it to my family and friends because it's easy and quick, and they've loved it as well. Definitely take the advice of the other cooks and spray the pan with a light cooking spray instead of using butter - would make the recipe much too greasy.

Really wonderful! The next time I will marinate it for a couple of hours. Also, we only had a piece of salmon with skin; pressed the pepper on the flesh side, put it in a grill basket and grilled to perfection. Enjoy! KIMBER

This salmon pleased everyone. You will need to cook it on medium-low heat if you want it more done than not. The pepper crust make it look wonderful

Rating: 3
very quick and simple and works well when having company- an easy crowd-pleaser. the only thing is that i should have paid attention to the chef below and seared the salmon at a lower temperature. i found i had to bake the salmon in the oven to cook it through- otherwise the inside was very rare.

Rating: 3
Delicious. I added red pepper flakes to the marinade to make it a bit spicier, and it was great. One recommendation I might make: if you like your fish cooked thoroughly, sear it on low-to-medium heat rather than medium-to-high, for a bit longer. The salmon was still tender and moist, but not at all raw.

my first set of four forks! made this atop a simple bed of white rice with peas, a little salt and a touch of lemon, served with pickled cucumbers on the side (rice vinegar, sugar, pepper, salt). marinated the salmon for almost a couple of hours, cooked in a cast iron grill for just a few minutes, leaving the inside rare, juicy and very good! reduced the marinade, added some sake, and added a touch of butter at the end, strained and drizzled over the salmon... also did a black pepper/toasted sesame seed crust. incredibly good! former non-salmon-fan-parents are now in love with this. better than restaurants, they say.

Rating: 4
For me to rate any recipe four forks is an achievement. For me to rate a recipe involving salmon- a fish that I'm not particularly fond of- is amazing. This recipe is absolutely delicious, and I don't even like salmon. I added sesame seeds on top of it, and I loved the flavor and texture. I also cooked it without the sesame seeds and it was great too, so you can't really go wrong. All around goodness.

We do not include the sugar that this recipe calls for in the marinade, but all of the other ingredients, and my husband likes me to make this recipe more than getting a steak out at a restaurant. We eat this dish about once every 10 days or so. We love it.

Maybe I'm just weird since all the other reviews were positive but I didn't care for this recipe. The sweet and salty combined with the peppery taste reminded me of how some beef jerky tastes. I like beef jerky but I don't want my salmon to taste like it. My husband and I love salmon and usually sear it in a pan with a tiny splash of olive oil and some salt and pepper then finish cooking it in the oven. Served with a dollop of my sour cream curry sauce and it's really tasty. I was looking for something a little different. However, this recipe wasn't for us. I found the strong taste of the marinade and pepper overpowered the taste of the salmon which is always the mark of a bad salmon recipe in my opinion. But like I said maybe I'm weird.

I haven't made this, but may try it just to compare to the similar recipe I have. I forget the chef I saw on the Today show, but his cookbook is based on five ingredients or less per dish. Anyway, you can acheive better results (easier) if you marinate your filets in 1/3 cup soy sauce and 2/3 cup real maple syrup. You can marinate them up to two days, I believe, but four hours is sufficient. Heat your oven to 500 or 550, as high as it will go. Place Salmon skin side down on a baking pan covered with aluminum foil and coat the top with fresh ground black pepper. Bake filets 11-15 minutes. The great thing about this recipe is that you can do 20 filets at a time if you wish, they should all get done at the same time if they're the same size. It's really wonderful. I even hate salmon, but love it this way.

This was a very quick, very easy recipe that was quite good. I got distracted and ended up marinating the fish for about an hour and a half. For the crust I used half crushed black pepper and half black sesame seeds, then seared the salmon in a hot cast iron skillet with a splash of olive oil. Next time I'll buy and try olive oil flavored cooking spray as suggested, as even a tiny bit of oil made the finished product a bit greasy. After I had a good seared crust I drained the fish for a minute and finished it with about 40 seconds in the microwave. Very flakey, tender, and tasty. Served with baby spinich wilted in sesame oil and sprinkled with some raw white sesame seeds (for color) and a squirt of lemon to brighten it up. Good quick meal and only two pans to wash.

I tried this recipe on some nice sockeye salmon steaks I had. I added fresh ginger to this recipe, just mashed it with the garlic and sugar with a mortar and pestle and then added this to the soy sauce and lemon juice. I also used 1 tbsp of dark soy sauce and 1 tbsp of light soy sauce so it wouldn't be too salty. It worked out great! I skipped the pepper crust and added black pepper after pan-frying it. Make sure you don't have too much of the marinade on the crust when you pan-fry or else it will stick to the pan. Use a cast iron pan for a nice crisp.

This is simple and delicious. The marinade does not overpower the natural flavor of the fish. In fact, I found the marinade to be pleasingly subtle. The soy sauce does not particularly exclaim Asian in this case--I found that it went well with French accompaniments. I broiled the fish, omitting the olive oil. My approach to salmon is that it has enough fat already. Any additional fat makes it greasy and heavy. There is nothing fancy about this, but it is one of those recipes that is so easy that I will make it frequently.

Wonderful recipe that gets more compliments than even my most cherished salmon recipes--and it is very easy to make, too! Perhaps this is blasphemy, but I found that microwaving the fish for 30-40 secs after taking it off the fire cooked it to perfection, and didn't require that I keep the fish on the fire so long that it charred instead of just blackened. I suppose this could also be done in the oven, but the microwave is too easy to resist.

I have made this dish several times and have always received many complements from my guests. Recently, I made the dish from memory but I forgot that it was to be marinated prior to cooking.

Very good and easy. I altered a bit.Instead of 4 tsp pepper, I mixed 1 tsp sesame seeds with 3 tsp pepper to use for crust. I also just used a good quality teriyaki sauce for the marinade (Soy Vey). I would also suggest a marinade time of 40 minutes and only use 1 tsp oil. I've already made it twice!

So easy and delicious! I cut the amount of olive oil to 1 Tbs, it didn't compromise flavor and didn't cause the salmon to stick to the cast iron fry pan. I would definitely make again and feel confident to prepare for guests.

This was rather good. I was busy in the kitchen, so the salmon marinated for about 45 minutes but this only added to the flavour. I used my pepper grinder instead of cracking the peppers, so I didn't really get what you'd call a "crust" on the salmon. It was good but I think I'd find another salmon recipe more to my taste for the next time. Steph.

What a fabulous recipe! Delicious and easy. If you are using very thick cuts of salmon I suggest increasing the marinating time by about 10 minutes. I served this on a bed of arugula lightly seasoned with a vinaigrette and some sauteed mushrooms. I have also made this recipe coating one side of the fish with sesame seeds and the other side with pepper, which was even better. It cuts down on the pepper for the people who might be overpowered by it.

WOW! So easy and So wonderful! My husband requested a salmon recipe to go with a nice bottle of Rhone red wine... and this recipe fit the bill wonderfully!

This is one of our favorite recipes for fish. It's a great dish to make for guests not only because it's so good but is very simple as well. It cooks amazingly well on the grill. I made this dish for a couple of friends last summer not knowing that one of them "did not like salmon". Not wanting to be rude, he didn't tell me this and ate the meal anyway. It is now one of his favorte recipes and his wife tells me he asks her to make it at least once a week! Now that's an endorsement!

This has been my favorite salmon recipe for over a year, and everyone raves each time I serve it. The scandal is that it is so easy--about 15 minutes to prepare the marinade, and then 5 minutes to sear the fillets when you're ready to cook. I usually use larger portions of fish, not always the fillet, and after searing it, place it in a casserole pan, dripping the remaining marinade over the fish. Bake in a hot oven and this will be some of the best fish you've ever eaten! I have even tried the marinade and pepper on a barbecue, and it comes out surprizingly well. A definite permanent addition to the recipe file!
