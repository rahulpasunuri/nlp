Fabulous. So quick and so easy. I used frozen mix berries which are a bit more tart than just strawberries and gave the coulis a bit of bite, otherwise no change to such a simple recipe. I would definitely make this again. In fact I wonder why I had never made it before seeing how easy it is to make.

I altered the proportions...1 lb fresh strawberries, 1 cup organic sugar, 2 tbsp lemon juice. I cooked the lemon juice and sugar to liquify the sugar, then put it with uncooked strawberries in blender, then through sieve. Fabulous. I'm serving it with New York cheesecake.

I made this to accompany an Angelfood cake with orange. Unfortunately, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added a bit of cornflour to thicken it. It would have been much better without the addition. Otherwise, it did the job but nothing special.

very good and soo easy, I made it with frozen strawberries and can't wait to try it with fresh when they are in season! at the moment I have some frozen mango in the freezer so I will be trying that next!

Adjust sugar depending on dish you are serving it with. Added a little cornstarch to thicken when boiling and did not put through sieve and it was great. Will certainly keep this one on hand.

If you're using strawberries frozen in season when they were at their sweetest, this is going to be way too sweet. I'd think about how sweet the accompanying dish was going to be before committing to this level of sweetness. For example, with the Vanilla Mousse (yum!) it could have had zero sugar. Blending and straining gives it a lovely texture and color.
