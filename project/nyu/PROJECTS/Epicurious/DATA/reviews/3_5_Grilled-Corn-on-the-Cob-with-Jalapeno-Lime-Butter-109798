Fabulous - with 2 changes...To lower the heat for our tastes I substitued a pasillo chili for one of the jalapenos - it added a great depth of flavor. Also tried it the second time without garlic which I thought was better - mush more subtle. My only complaint is now I have 2 limes without peel - I guess it's time for Margaritas.

Really great! I had a lot left over, and noticed that someone suggested putting it on cornbread... I'll definitely try it!

These are, simply, tastes that work well together, and whether you can grow them in your own garden or purchase them from your local grocer is less important than trying something interesting and delicious. I make a variation on this butter which includes about a tablespoon of chopped cilantro ("fresh from the garden," as were the corn and peppers) and find it complements the other flavors nicely. It's quite tasty on a slice of corn bread, as well.

This is our favorite summer recipe ever. Instead of grilling it in the husks I shuck it and baste with the jalapeno-lime butter while grilling!

Made as written. Thought it was excellent. Truly enhanced the flavor of the corn and brought out its sweetness.

Made as written with fresh from the garden corn, it just didn't do it for us. Perhaps to doctor up starchy super market corn it would be okay, but we won't make it again.

Used the zest and juice from 2 key limes - more flavorful and easily obtainted at Trader Joe's. Served the butter on our corn as well as on the grilled salmon. Yum! It's not at all hot or zesty, but very flavorful. Next time, I might add red peppers or cayenne for a kick.

I expected a lot more flavor and "zip" but was disappointed. This recipe isn't worth the time.

It was raining, so I put the chili's under the broiler for a few minutes per side a,d just boiled the corn. I put the butter in a pretty dish on the table. My little brother said he never wanted to eat corn without this butter again, and my boyfriend has been using it on everything else all week.

A nice change from the usual, however it needs a little kick. When I make it again I will leave some of the jalapeno seeds in, for a little added heat.

I have been grilling corn for as long as i can recall, from big pig roast to just in the back yard for my family, and i find an excalent way to prepair the corn, especailly corn that is not as fresh or as sweet as one would hope is to soak it in sugar water overnight. This not only helps sweeten the corn, but it prevents the husk from drying out and burning, also it causes the corn to steam from the inside out that i find makes for a more tender corn, especially if its not so very fresh. Also another trick is to use another compound butter to sweeten corn and that is honey butter. Simply mix 1 part honey, and 2 parts butter. Make as much as you like and useing plastic wrap role into logs and then freeze extra. It can then be sliced into rounds that is good on everything from roles to ..well corn :)..

A easier and lowfat version is to use lime juice, salt and red chilli powder (5:1:1/2 ratio) and rub the mixture using a cut lime as a brush ocasionally squeezing it too!

We made this as written, well, actually we probably added a bit more lime zest than called for. It was wonderful! Will absolutely make it again. A nice change from our standard fare: peeling back the husks, wrapping bacon around the corn cob, then tying the husks closed and grilling.

Greetings from the Corn State! We are purists around here when it comes to sweet corn and rarely fool with the flavor of Mother Nature's bounty. However, this recipe was fabulous, and we used it several times throughout the season. We had very good luck with this time-saving variation: Cook the husked corn in boiling water until almost done. Drain the water and spray a light coating of oil on the hot ears (we used olive oil). Place the ears on a hot grill for 5-10 minutes, turning them so all sides get some grill marks. The oil spray will cause enough smoke to add the grilled flavor to the corn without the hassle of cooking in the husks. We, too, added a little salt to the jalapeno butter because we normally have unsalted butter on hand.

Can't wait to try this recipe. I enjoy the presentation of BBQ corn with grilled husks. First peel back the husk, remove the silk, soak and put on the grill. Turn often because it cooks faster. And it's easy to eat right away -- no oven mitts needed.

Had purchased great multi-colored corn from a truck farm justs befores receiving this recipe. I didn't have a chili so made butter sauce without it. Cut butter amount in half, reduced lime peel amount somewhat and added a dash of salt. Also, made the corn in the microwave without removing the husks. It was just super and I have never seen my wife enjoy corn on the cob so much.

Easy way to grill without burning your hands - shuck the corn and wrap it in foil - grill about ten minutes or so, turning every couple of minutes - roasts nicely and carmelizes the natural sugars - lots of lime - yum! Been doing this for years.

Served this last night on some fabulous bi-color corn--FABULOUS!! Made copies of recipe for several guests.

I learned a long time ago that 1) Corn gets cold fast, and 2) It is a real pain to grill corn in the husk and then try to remove it, whatever the means. (Oven mitts?? I'd rather floss while wearng boxing gloves!) I would recommend this variation: Be brave -- remove the husks and grill the corn over direct heat for 8-12 minutes. Carefully turn and baste the corn with the jalapeno/butter mixture all the while, using a brush or barbecue mop to minimize flare-ups. Assuming that the corn in your area is reasonably fresh, the result will be a side dish that truly tastes GRILLED, and -- fair warning -- may actually outshine your main course.

All of our guests really liked the jalepeno butter which was served with just picked corn. I thought my processor was too large to reach the proper consistency. The recipe said to process until smooth. The next time I would double or triple the recipe and just keep the logs frozen. Although, I did like the flecks of jalepeno that remained.

One suggestion... soak your ears of corn in plain tap water for at least 15 minutes to keep the corn from drying out and the husks from catching flame while on the barbie.

One word: DELIGHTFUL. I highly recommend this recipe. I've also tried the butter on chicken and pork, and it got rave reviews.

It's the yummiest! Adds a nice flavor to summer's finest!
