Should not have cooked the onion, rosemary, pancetta mixture so long--it got too brown while baking. My tip for a rising dough: fill a large glass bowl with hot water and float a smaller glass bowl on top. Put kneaded dough in smaller bowl and cover with dish towel. Great even and controlled rising environment.

I decided to make this for an afternoon snack. This is the first time I tried to make focaccia. When I took the dough out of the mixer, it was so liquidy and goopy that I was sure it was going to be a disaster. But I kneaded in some more flour, just like the recipe said. The end result was AMAZING. How does it taste the next day? I have no idea -- my boyfriend and I wolfed down the entire loaf in 20 minutes.

The pancetta and onion top is a hit (people inhale this, and if it lasts for a couple of days it's a great basis for bread salad) but I prefer to add olives and the topping to the focaccia recipe in The Frugal Gourmet Cooks Italian. It's a tastier recipe, to my mind, and much simpler.

This is easy but time consuming with the rising of the dough. My guests absolutely love this as an appetizer, and the only problem is their propensity to want to fill up on it before dinner. I have subsituted some salted pork that has been rinsed well for the pancetta and it is a good subsitute when pancetta is not available. Fresh rosemary works best.

I also omit the olives,onion and pancetta,sprinkling the top with coarse sea salt and lots of fresh rosemary.I shape the bread into a flat oblong and bake as suggested on a baking tray. Truly superb recipe.
