I thought these were a little over the top in terms of blue cheese flavor; however, I accidentally left the chives out and they may have provided a nice balance to the cheese flavor.

These biscuits were really, pardon the expression, yummy. My friend and I made them into little, bite-sized biscuits and they went great with the crab cakes we made. We used the crisco butter flavored shortening and they were great.

These biscuits are delicious. They are tender and golden and the blue cheese plus herbs gives them a flavor that wakes up the breakfast table. Leftovers make great breakfast sandwiches the next day.

I mixed up these biscuits to serve with roasted chicken. My husband and sons raved. They find them delicious and will even drive to the store at the last minute to purchase the blue cheese!

I made this for Thanksgiving and all guests couldn't get enough - even our younger guests that wouldn't think about eating fresh thyme and chives thought they were great. Highly recommend!

This was different and good but I wouldn't make it again. I served it with other breads and it just lacked what I was looking for in flavor.
