So simple to make, but extremely enjoyable. Changed the pasta as it turned out we were out of Orechiette at the last minute, but fine with farfalle

Good. I added 1/2 t red pepper flakes & 1/4C diced onion. I'll probably make it again b/c I'm growing zucchini this year. I think it would be better if the garlic,oregano (on the stem) and red pepper flakes were cooked in the oil a minute first, to infuse the flavor into the oil. I tried DeCecco pasta for the 1st time & it was noticeably better.

I think all those that stats this recipe is blah they have the right to proceed to another one, or write their own. I think Its a great recipe , and I even do it with less amount of ingredients- cheese and olive oil - since Im always looking for healthier food anyway. Also, would cut the zucchini in small cubes tossing apart the middle with its seeds as well as the fiber inside garlic gloves to avoid indigestion. Also, just in case, for personal reasons I like a touch of "peperoncino" to spicy it up pasta with vegetables.

This was very light and very yummy. I made most of the changes here: added fresh basil and sliced the zucchini in half moons and very thin. Just great! I also used home made pasta and that made it even better!

I loved this pasta. I followed other reviewers' suggestions of cutting the zucchini disks in half and slicing the zucchini fairly thinly. I think a good, freshly grated pecorino makes a difference here. I doubled the amount added to the pasta and had lots available on the table. Even with 6 cloves of garlic, I found the garlic flavor to be fairly subtle.

The success of this dish is going to depend on the pasta, primarily. I used a Di Cecco brand orecchiette that was good, and a nice pecorino. Don't forget the olive oil at the end (omitted from the instructions). No need to be shy about the amount of zucchini, either. Simple, easy to make, and delicious.

I found this to be pretty dull. I added some feta cheese, FGBP and pine nuts to give it some life. Then it was pretty good!

Delicious. Added some grilled chicken for substance and red pepper flakes for spice. I followed another reviewer's idea of halving the zucchini and slicing thinly, a must. This was easy and delicious, and it even makes good leftovers. Don't skimp on the garlic! It adds great flavor.

I agree with previous reviewers about this recipe being a little blah. I'm not ready to give up on it, though. Next time I am going to grill the zucchini instead of sauteeing it, I think that will give it the little more bite that it needs. I also think this is a good "starter" recipe, meaning you could do just about anything you want to this. I didn't use as much oil as it called for either, I think that would have beeen waaaaay overboard.

Kind of blah. Maybe red pepper flakes would give it a little kick.

The recipe reads to add the remaining oil to the pasta along with the zucchini-garlic mixture and toss, then add reserved pasta cooking liquid.

This recipe probably would've gotten 3 forks if I'd followed it more closely. Here's where I strayed, and most likely went wrong. I followed one reviewer's suggestion & added wheat pasta in attempts to be healthy about things. I wouldn't do that again. I had only one pound of zucchini - it would've been better with 2. I read only had dried oregano - fresh is always best. I chopped fresh basil to add when I added the chopped garlic. This I liked. Might try adding this again when I make it the "right way". Also - I kept thinking sauteed thinly sliced onions would've been good in this too. Anyway...it was edible. I just kept having to tell myself it was HEALTHY bite after bite (damn wheat pasta!) ;-)

Delish. Added some red pepper flakes for extra kick. Have also found that the zucchini is even more delectable when the discs are cut in half, and in pretty thin slices - they brown beautifully, and the texture is fab.

I have not made this recipe yet, but it calls for 6 T. of oil but I only see two tablespoons being used. Any advice?

This is a great side dish or quick weeknight meal. It tastes great, is easy to prepare, and it is nutritious, especially if prepared with whole wheat pasta.

Made this dish last night, with Dreamfield's Inulin (lo-carb!) pasta. I thought it looked a touch dry, so I added some heavy cream. I used fresh oregano from the herb pot outside my door, and, since there was extra basil in the ground, I cut some of that, too. Six cloves of garlic might look a bit excessive, but it is part of the rustic charm of the dish. Go for it! I think pasta and zucchini are made for each other. Delightful!

There are people out there who haven't grown zucchini. Give 'em a break! This is a lovely dish, lots of flavor.

This is a recipe?? Anyone who has ever grown zucchini knows how to do this. It is simple and good when zucchini is in season which is why it is still around.

This is a recipe??? I can't believe there is anyone who hasn't made this during the zucchini growing season. Of course it is very simple and very good which is the reason it stays around.
