Although the mascarpone cream is very delicious I didn't see how this could be a 4 fork recipe. Overall much too sweet for my taste.

Interesting recipe, it seems very tasty. I have a recipe that combine Mascarpone cream and cherries. Is made with Mascarpone and cherries (obviously), plus sugar, eggs, 1 cup Rum and 1 half cup water. http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/search-recipes/mascarpone-with-cherries.aspx Mario Grazia

Good concept, made a few changes. First, I did the compote as is the day before and it was very globby, had to add water to thin it down. Other reviewers complained of the chocolate, so I melted it with 1 tablespoon of cream then added a teaspoon or so of Cointreau. It was perfect. I also baked a squares of puff pastry then sliced them in half after they cooled. It was great, looked great and people loved it. I also used Cointreau in the mascarpone cream. I made this for auction winners of a gala dinner, so the entire meal had to be fantastic!

Very good, but would not make this again. The chocolate was not quite thin enough, and the squares broke.

On reading this receipe I'm thinking that if the chocolate base was made more like a ganache or a chocolate fudge that the disection of it would not be so messy, this way the overall presentation and taste of the dessert would not be compromised.

Welll GAAAAWD DAAAYAM!! This was a fabulous dessert! It looks very professional, what with the cherry compote and the dusted sugar on top. The flayvah was sensational. I will fault it slightly for the same reason dorkboy below gave it one fork: it does tend to squish when you eat it. But the combination of flavors was just wonderful and I can overlook that.

Looks beautiful when served. I used sour dried cherries as fresh were unavailable. It's not as pretty I would imagine as the fresh cherries but still yummy. Used 3 - 3ounce packages and soaked the dried cherries in water I had brought to a boil(covered) Include the juices from the soaking in the compote preparation. This dish gets messy AFTER it's been served when everyone is trying to break through the chocolate layers but everyone loved it!

This dessert was so sweet that we had to throw it away after a few bites. It also was too hard to eat. The whole thing flattened when you tried to break off a piece to eat with your fork. Eating a Hershey bar would have been better. I rate it a big Zero!

I rate this recipe as a 4 plus. I will definetly make it again. I didn't have cherry brandy, so I used Amaretto instead and I used half vanilla extract and half almond extract. This recipe is outstanding and very easy to make. Now, if you could just remove those calories......

I made this dish for a special project at culinary school and knocked their socks off. If you want to make a really romantic yet easy dish I recommend this one. It can be made ahead and assembled at the last minute. A winner!

This is an absolutely delicious dessert. Pretty easy to do, no bake, and you can make all of it at least a day before, and put it together at the last minute. Very simple, but a four-star dish. I think this would be great with other fruit too, I'm thinking raspberries, peaches, blackberries... so many things I want to try with this one!
