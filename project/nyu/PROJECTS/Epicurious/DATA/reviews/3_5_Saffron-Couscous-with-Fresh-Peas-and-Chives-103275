I find couscous recipes starting with plain couscous dull. I made this with "Near East Whole Wheat Couscous with Garlic and Olive Oil", cooked with equal parts chicken broth and water (may do all broth next time),skipped the saffron, upped the herbs to include 2 scallions, basil and parsley, partially defrosted frozen baby peas and cooked VIA the bowl method (first time I ever cooked this way - it is the way to go for fluffy couscous). Was great!

This was incredibly simple and delicious, and I used frozen sweetlet peas! I added the saffron to the broth then set it to boil. I measured the couscous into a 4-cup glass measure, then poured the frozen peas on top. I stirred the butter into the boiling broth, then poured it over the peas/couscous to cover completely. By the time the couscous absorbed the water, the peas were perfectly crisp-cooked. I 'fluffed' in the cup while adding the chives, and this turned out perfectly. To save time and mess, I re-used the broth pot to prepare veggies while waiting for the couscous. Yummy!!

I added a little fresh basil instead of chives..it came out more flavorful.

Hate peas so left them out. Saffron and chives did perk up the flavor of couscous. Someone suggested cut up green beans, may try that next time.

I made a similar recipe that I believe has more flavor and interest than this one. See Bon Appetit, June 1996: Shrimp, Pea and Couscous Salad with Saffron Vinaigrette.

Excellent- & Easy! Even my husband, who thought he hated couscous, loved it. I substituted haricot vertes cut into small pieces for the peas since I made this at the last minute. Definitely a keeper!

Very simple to make. I used homemade chicken stock from my freezer, but otherwise stayed true to recipe. It was dynamite with grilled rosemary lamb chops.

This was very good - I made it with fresh peas and don't think it would be as good with frozen. I like frozen peas a lot, but with something this simple, I think the ingredients are very important. I had no chives, so substituted fresh parsley. I think part of the dish's success lies in the rather large quantity of butter (ok, it's not THAT extravagant, but it's more fat than I usually put in my couscous). A lovely light main dish with a salad, or side dish.

This was delicious!!! I followed someone else's suggestion and used rosemary! My husband even liked it and he is hard to please! Yummy!

Simple and tasty, this recipe makes a nice accompaniment to fish or chicken. The peas, which can be fresh or frozen, add texture and interest.

I made this recipe for the second time tonight. I think it's qute nice. The first time I made it with fresh peas and it was better than with frozen. Will make it again, though!

What a surprise! This side dish is wonderful in every aspect - the texture, color and incredible flavor. It is also simple to prepare. I will make this on a regular basis. Would change nothing about the recipe. I used frozen peas and fresh rosemary. It was fantastic with the "rosemary and garlic lamb chops" also found on this site. Enjoy!!!

This is a wonderful side dish for pork or lamb. It is easy to make, but immensely flavorful. The combination of saffron, peas, and chives with the broth-cooked couscous is lovely! Definitely on my list of favorite recipes.

My husband, who swore he would not eat couscous & demanded a baked potato instead, ate 2 HUGE helpings of this dish! Every bite was flavorful, which I can't always say about couscous recipes. I served it with kabobs on the grill - delicious!

I served this with sea bass w/ moroccan salsa. since the salsa was complex, i 86ed the peas and saffron. these are the best directions for fluffy couscous!

I have made this recipe a couple times now and like it. The couscous is a great alternative to rice or pasta.
