This is a bit weird. I found the sauce to be off balance and lacking something. Maybe a good shot of a decent sweet 'n sour sauce!! Doubt I will try it again.

Even my 'son who eats anything' thought this one was pretty bad. I used premium soy sauce and it was still salty tasting and frankly just plain boring. I was thinking of ways to make it better next time, but decided to just toss the recipe and look elsewhere.

Red cooking is a classic style of chinese cooking, centuries old. This recipe is not far from my grandmother's(my CHINESE grandmother's)though the meat generally used is pork, and it is slow braised for a much longer time. Which may account for the comments from the Netherlands cook of dryness. Meat becomes more tender in slow braising.(I take a little offense in the comment of filth.I mean....really). The sugar should be a bit less than equal parts to the soy sauce, which should be a high quality one,so it is not overly salty. And the water to soy ratio should be about 10 to 1..(i.e...10 cups water to 1 cup soy)which allows the meat to slow cook properly while the sauce cooks down. A cinnamon stick is also used (more available than the traditional cassia pieces). Chinese Hsao-Shing wine in place of the sherry, but the sherry works well. This is a favorite dish in many Chinese homes..try these twists and you will enjoy it as well.

I really laughed when I read the comments from the cook from Tilburg because I seem to usually have the same likes and dislikes in food. I went ahead and made this dish anyway and while I wouldn't call it filth I certainly wouldn't make it again. The sauce was so oily even after cleaning the chicken very thoroughly. I had to degrease it twice - skimming and blotting with a paper towel just isn't sufficient. The experience was a bit repulsive.

The chicken wasn't tender but dry and leathery, the sauce lacked body and flavour and was far too sweet. Filth.

While I agree it was sweet, we really liked this recipe. My husband declared that we never need to go to a Chinese restaurant again (not sure I agree with that!). I served this with broccoli and rice, and it was a nice, well-rounded weekday dinner.

My family likes this recipe and it's easy to make. (I usually serve with rice and something like steamed broccoli.) I'm less crazy about it, as I find the sauce cloying (for lack of a better word).

Recently we enjoyed this for the second time. Our only change is that we prefer less sugar. Great recipe!

Very easy to make and a big hit with my dinner guests. I served with stir-fried asparagus and white rice, but next time I'll probably try using jasmine rice instead.

The sauce is WONDERFUL! My family was trying to figure out what else we would like the sauce one! This is a keeper in my house!

This dish was soo tasty. I served it with steamed white rice and stir fried cabbage and broccoli; nice accompaniment. I wasn't sure if the chicken was supposed to be whole or cut up, so I cut it up into large bite-sized pieces and cooked it less than the recipe called for. The dish was unique, simple, elegant and flavorful. Will definitely make it again. And can someone tell me: what is broccoli rabe?

Just like some of the other reviews, my kids loved this recipe. And, that makes my life a whole lot easier. It was quick, simple and tasty. We definitely will be making this one again.

Easy and Simple. And it tastes good, too. Even my finicky kids liked it.

I LOVE this dish! I am not a person who likes to spend a lot of time cooking but I like to have good food. This dish satisfies both needs. I have made this several times to rave reviews. I serve it with couscous and I don't reduce the sauce quite as much so that the couscous can soak it up.

I have made this several times when I needed something quick and had no desire to shop for ingredients. If I don't have the broccoli rabe on hand, I have served it with red chard, (stems sauteed lightly with garlic), then the chopped leaves and stems wilted in a bit of soy sauce and a dash of sesame oil.

The triumph of this recipe is that my 5 and 6 year old children love it so I make it all the time now.

this dish is great! easy, delicious and fast...what more could you ask for? the only tip is not to over-cook the chicken - it's best if the chicken is just done. also, this dish can be prepared in advance - just put the chicken aside, heat the sauce to boiling, return the chicken to the sauce to warm up and voila!!!

this recipe was really very delicious, very quick to make and very light and low in fat. The sauce was perfect, and I will make it again.I made it with basmati rice and stirfried vegetables, it was a real success.

The sauce does not balance -- partly it's the cornstarch -- it would be better as a reduction with chicken broth instead of water. Also the white rice is uninteresting -- although the broccoli rabe works well.
