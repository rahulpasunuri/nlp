I made the recipe for the blondies only. Was very pleased that this recipe did not contain nuts, or coconut, or other items that I think detract from a good ol' basic blondie! These were so good..will definitely make these again. Have made some of the other blondie recipes here on epicurious and this is my favorite by far.

Yeah, the boil-in-can method works great, just make SURE you keep the water level over the can at all times. My family had a can explode, complete with third degree burns to the face and arms (the stuff is like hot tar).

Actually I only boil the can for about 90 minutes to 2 hours and that is plenty long.

When i was a kid, what you call "blondies", we called "congo bars", and we added pecans or walnuts. Your recipe was better with nuts (cuts the sweetness a bit). Also, thanks for the So American recipe. I'd heard of this process but was told to "just boil the can for a while". Now I know "a while" is 4 hours!

This was really good. I used frozen yogurt instead of ice cream and also skipped the streusel topping (to avoid a few calories!) but added whipped cream. So delicious, and the blondies recipe is very fast and easy. This is a great, quick dessert in a pinch that has real stage presence!

You can make dulce de leche an easier way: submerge an UNOPENED can of sweetened condensed milk in water, and boil for 4 hours, ensuring that it is always covered with water. Cool. You can store it for months without opening. This is how my family in South America has made it for years.

For anyone who has trouble finding dulce de leche, it is very easy to make your own. Empty a can of sweetend condensed milk into a pie pan. Cover with foil and bake at 400 degrees in a water bath for about 1 1/2 hours. Whisk until it is smooth. I've mixed into ice cream with good results. This is the most easy (and delicious) caramel I've ever made.

To my "Aussie" friend out of Melbourne. Dulce de Leche Ice cream taste very similar to Sweetened condenced milk...the only difference it that the milk was caramelized.

Great flavor combination! Just an FYI regarding the ice cream, most supermarkets stock Breyers brand Dulce Leche and Haagen Daaz as well.

Great Recipe. Good Dulce de Leche ice cream was hard to find. The best is by Ciao Bella Gelato. They have pints in some of the nicer grocery stores in my area.

This recipe was very easy and the result was great. Since it's just my husband and I we ate it a few nights in a row and it re-heated nicely. I don't make desserts very much, but I will make this again.
