Really dull and way too much dill. It tastes as low-fat as it is. Hey Park City - the recipes are free and adding nutritional information is a lot of work. Why don't you volunteer?

This was OK for a really low-fat potato salad. The cucumber was a nice crisp taste that lightened the flavor. But if you can afford the fat grams, I bet there are other potato salads that are better.

i found this dish rather uninspiring. maybe my dill was too old but i will have trouble eating the left-overs!

Please put nutritional values at the bottom of each recipe. I pretty much know I must do a makeover on every one, but others might not.
