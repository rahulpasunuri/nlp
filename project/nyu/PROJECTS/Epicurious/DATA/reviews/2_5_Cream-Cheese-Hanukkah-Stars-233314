I read the review from "A Cook from Middletown, NJ" and what she wrote was PERFECT. I would NEVER make these again.

I am an experienced cookie baker and I love to bake so when I read this recipe, my first reaction to the proportion of flour to butter and cream cheese was that there had to be a misprint. None the less, I decided to give this recipe a try since in an interview on NPR, I heard Ruth Reichl say these were one of her favorite holiday cookies. Unfortunately, my instincts were right. The dough turned out to be very frustrating to work with - it is sooo soft and sticky. It has to be handled very quickly once it comes out of the refrigerator and with tons of extra flour. Plan on working in very small batches without any interruptions or the dough will become impossible. Definitely not a recipe that you want your children to help you with. The end result was disappointing. I don't feel the taste of the cookie justified the misery of making them. There are better recipes out there that won't make you want to throw the dough in the garbage in a frustrated rage.

The end result was a delicious, moist cookie. The dough was very sticky so I added about 1/4 cup additional flour.

The stickiness made these a little tough to work with but everyone loved the results.

Yummy, but the dough was really sticky and hard to work with. Roll the dough while it's still very cold. I needed to use a lot of flour to roll out. I'll probably try adding a bit more flour to the recipe next time.

Terrific and easy!
