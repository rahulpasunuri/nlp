This is a great and simple recipe, that does need a bit more than 28 minutes- from what I find.. and I've made them about 35 times. Heathbars are conveniently sold broken and prepackaged 8oz. packages. I am now using the chocolate covered HeathBars.

Delicious and totally easy. I would definitely make again. I used the already crushed Heath bars but everything else was exactly as written. I'll definitely be making these again.

I usually omit the nuts when I make these brownies. They are delicious. I always get compliments on them.

These brownies are fabulous and easy to make - I don't use nuts and increasing the chocolate a bit works well! Enjoy!

Fabulous! My mom made these for me after the birth of my daughter in 2004. They have become a family favorite. I chop the heath bars and put those into the brownie batter. I use two additional bars to chop and sprinkle on top shortly after they come out of the oven. This is not a dessert I would serve at a dinner party, but a good family treat to replace tired old chocolate chip cookies.

I used hazelnuts instead of walnuts and increased the chocolate to 5 oz. I put the Heath bars in the freezer for an hour, then whacked them, still wrapped, with an ice mallet. These brownies are Excellent! They were the first sweet gone at a large picnic.

Sorry, I thought these were just okay. I don't understand all the great reviews.

Wow! Awesome! I read the reviews before I made these. Since one review (maybe more) mentioned they weren't chocolatey enough, and since I think there isn't anything that can be too chocolatey, I increased the chocolate to 4 1/2 ounces. Made two other small changes. I eliminated the nuts (don't like nuts) and used a ceramic baking dish because I couldn't find a baking pan of the right size (I just moved). These turned out to be the best brownies I have ever eaten in my life.

The only problem with these is that it is difficult to pass the pan of brownies without eating one! Delicious!

I made these brownies with my 10 year old son. We used 4 oz of chocolate and cooked for 5 or 10 minutes less than directed. They came out delicious and were a big hit. We'll definitely make these again.

Loved them!Easy to make and wonderful warm.I used a 9 x 9 pan but had to cook them longer-they came out just in between fudgy and cakey

I made these for a friend's birthday and everyone raved! I used a mixture of Heath & Skor bars just to mix things up.

I really like these brownies. They are not cakey or fudgy, but chewy, just how I like brownies. The toasted walnuts are very good with the candy topping. I should have chopped the Heath bars a little finer, but everyone in my class loved them.

The recipe on the Baker's unsweetened chocolate box is very similar, but using more chocolate. I used that one, baked the brownies for 28 minutes, and topped them with heath bar bits. They turned out moist, fudgy and delicious.

Rave reviews from everyone. Sweet enough with about half the Heath bar topping.

To light on the Chocolate. If I make again will add more to make it richer.

Forgot to mark that I would definately make these again. I guess that is why the percentage is so low--silly people like me who forgot to say that they would make this dish again.

These are wonderful! Especially for those who like cakey brownies. My family liked the light chocolate flavor, especially when combined with the Skor bars. These are a nice change from rich, fudgy desserts. By the way, I buy the Skor bars already crushed up at Smart n Final in LA--they are a real time saver.

These were good, but not great. They were too cakey for my taste, but maybe I'll try again in the 8x8 pan as a previous cook suggested.

I loved these brownies! I made them in an 8x8 pan, so they were really fudgy and delicious! I also used butter toffee walnuts for added flavor--they were perfect!

To andie1024, the discrepancy between the number of good reviews and % of people who would make it again is due to the fact that not everyone who rated it wrote a review.

Crumb was decent, but nothing all that special. I used only 2 heath bars and found that gave plenty of heath flavor.

Very good brownies - used Skor bits (sold in Choc. chip size bags). Chewy texture with a nice crunch from toffee.

I love Heath Bars! This recipe sounds good, and I'll try it. But why, with four out of five "yummy" reviews, does it say only 33% would make it again???

Great and easy brownie recipie. I made them for a luncheon, and everyone thought they were great!

note for marykukla in southern maryland: I couldn't find Heath bars in groceries, either. Try Rite-Aid or CVS instead. Good luck. These are yummy.

If you can't find Heath, you can use Almond Roca or Skor. If you still can't find it, you may want to contact hershey's: http://www.hersheys.com/products/details/heath.asp

I have NOT made this recipe but have been looking for Heath bars..I'm located in a remote part of Southern Maryland - have not had a chance to check the local Wal-Mart but I have checked the major grocery stores..any suggestions?

Can't wait to make these again. Perfect. Best brownies I've ever had. Cooked them for a little less than recommended time so they were super gooey, and served with a little whipped cream on top--yum!
