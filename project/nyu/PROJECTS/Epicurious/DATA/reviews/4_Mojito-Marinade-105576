This is MOJO... NOT Mojito. Mojito would have mint, not cilantro.

Good marinade...HOWEVER, whoever wrote the recipe is either psychotic, suicidal or BOTH: a) NEVER pour cold liquid into smoking oil. The warning posted ("careful, it might splatter!") is not doing this justice. The safer way to do this is to either use a deep pot (yes, even for a small amount), a pan with a lid to prevent splattering (meaning hold the lid over the hot pan as you pour it in and then keep the lid there until you hear the sizzling settle down a bit) or just SLOWLY heat the oil and then gently saute your onions and garlic on low heat before adding the juice separately. I did it the way this recipe said, thinking it would splatter just a bit...it went all over my stove, causing a massive oil splatter that sent oil flying two feet in each direction. By the time I calmed it all down, my onions and garlic were burning, oil was all over the floor, all over my spice rack, my fridge and the walls. 2) Don't EVER toss hot liquid into a blender. EVER. This, I knew before I did it. The problem with hot liquid in an enclosed space is that it creates air pressure that will make the lid of the blender pop off. It doesn't matter if your hand is holding on to it either. Wait until it cools before you do it. And if you're stupid enough to do the opposite of what I say, make damn sure you have a towel and a good grip. Also, wait until it cools before adding it to meat. You don't want meat half-cooking in a bag or bowl overnight. Anyhow...that's it.

Forgot to mention in my review below - I have made this according to the instructions, and I have also just thrown everything into a ziplock bag and skip all of the cooking and food processing... I always use the easy method now because both are excellent. If you like easy recipes, just use this recipe's ingredients and throw it in a ziplock with chicken.

Fast, easy, delicious - a favorite recipe! I halve the recipe for 6-8 breasts and marinate all day or over night. It tenderizes the meat well. This is a superb quick meal. I have served this to family and guests many times. LOVE IT!

This recipe is kind of a lot of work, what with the squeezing fresh juice and chopping cilantro. But the result is a great marinade for chicken. Really great.

I love this and use it often. I have made minor modifications: reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon and increased the cilantro to a cup. It enhances the fresh taste!

I absolutely adore this recipe as a marinade for grilled chicken kebabs especially, but it is good with pork, too. Even my foodie snob friends ask for the recipe. This is every bit as good as the Goya store-bought version. Do marinade overnight -- at least. ENJOY!

I made this recipe exactly as it is listed here, and it is amazing. I marinated chicken with it, and let the chicken sit overnight. Also makes an awesome dipping sauce (boiled and added cornstarch).

This recipe has been on here for this long and i just read almost every review and cant believe no one caught the major ingredient left out...VINEGAR. For chicken and pork use a white or cider vinegar. If using on red meat use red wine or Balsamic vinegar. Use 4:1 ratio oil to vinegar...1/8 cup vinegar. I give it three forks without BUT 4 forks with vinegar. Even the people who didnt like this will like it after adding the vinegar. (At least add some dry white wine if not vinegar) The restaurant owners who put this online even have vinegar in their bottle form of this that they use and sell. Excellent restaurant it is, if your in Syracuse, you have to try it.

Marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts overnight, then grilled them for about four minutes per side. Boiled the leftover marinade not used for basting, added cornstarch/water to thicken and used it as a table sauce. Note: This sauce was also excellent on the rice we made to accompany the chicken! The chicken had a nice flavor without the additional sauce, but we preferred it with the table sauce. All in all, easy and quite good. We would make it again and probably soon.

While I like this marinade and would definitely use it again for chicken, pork or fish, the name is misleading. This is what's referred to as a Mojo marinade, not Mojito. Mojo marinades are typically citrus based, cuban/carribean style marinades. Where as a Mojito type of marinade would usually include mint to some extent.

Incredible exactly as directed. I marinaded 1-inch cubes of tofu overnight. Then placed one large onion (cut into 1/2 inch slices) on bottom of baking dish with tofu and marinade to cover onions. Cooked at 375 for 1 hour. Amazing. Will make again and again.

It is possible to blend hot liquids in a blender without an "explosion". I usually remove the center plug in the lid and I don't over fill the blender. Another alternative is to use an immersion blender. Tasty marinade, by the way.

Rating: 3
Pulsing the hot marinade in a blender is prone to disaster. Either let it cool before blending or drape the blender with a towel to contain the mess. Pulsing the hot liquid causes the air in the blender to expand violently and push off the lid, allowing the hot liquid to erupt out. Not an issue for the food processor since it does not seal as tightly.

This is one of those marinades that I emailed to my foody friends the day after I made it. Quick and flavorful- a keeper. I served it over couscous and it came out beautifully.

I used this marinade on pork tenderloin, marinated overnight, then pan seared and finished off in the oven. Used for a taco bar for my son's party. Was good - not great. Pork was better the second day after absorbing more of of the marinade juices once it had been sliced up. Still, would make again for the same purpose as it really tenderized the meat well.

This is the most amazing marinade I have used on chicken! It is flavorful and the orange and lime juice really play off the spices. I have not used the marinade with the oven roasted chicken recipe, rather I have used it on chicken breasts that I grill. Truly an excellent marinade!

I used this marinade on a Flank steak. It was absolutely DELICIOUS! I marinated the meat for about 3 hours then grilled it and it was fantastic. A huge hit at the dinner table. We didn't have any leftovers! I will definately use this again. I bet it would be delicious on chicken breast.

This marinade is amazing. I have made it twice this week, both times with pork tenderloin. I marinaded the pork overnight in the marinade, but cooked the pork on its own in the oven without the marinade. I reduced the marinade on the stove and served it as a sauce. I can't imagine anyone not liking these flavours!

I hate to be odd-cook out here but this marinade bored me. I ended up marinading overnight and thought it was going to be spectacular but the overriding taste is oranges. I even added some serrano chilis for heat. The other flavors get lost. If i try again, I will do mostly lime, with a bit of orange.

This recipe is one of my favorites...I would really give it a 3.5 instead of a 3. I make it as written and double the batch so I have some to freeze. I have also made it without cilantro and added flat leaf parsley instead (my husband doesn't like cilantro) and it was still excellent.

With my chicken already marinating in Morrocan spices, I dedided to use the mojito marinade on sirloin steak, which my husband grilled over charcoal. Despite marinating it only about 4 hours, the meat was tender and succulent and bursting with flavor. This is one of the best marinades I've made and decidedly different from the soy or wine based ones I use often. I used orange juice from a carton with great results.

Wow! This is by far the best marinade I've ever tasted, but I wanted a little heat. The second time I made this I used a few chipotle chiles and a couple of tablespoons of the adobo sauce. I omitted the cumin and oregano and put the remaining chipotle chiles from the can in the marinade after cooking and chopping in the blender.

Stunning marinade!!!!! Absolutely love the stuff. Because my husband is a grill fanatic, we marinated the chicken for several hours and then grilled it. Following the suggestion of others and reserved some of the marinade for sauce. I reduced it on the stove, and then poured it over the meat, and let it rest for a few minutes. Served it with black beans and rice. Fabulous!

This was a reasonably simple marinade that we made the night before a rather large event. The only modification that we used was that we use boneless thighs without the skin on. We cooked the thighs over the grill, diced the meat, and served over corn tortillas. This recipe was the talk of the party. Everyone LOVED it.

An excellent marinade! I used the hand blender as someone suggested below, but next time I'll use the food processor for a smoother texture. And maybe I didn't heat the oil quite high enough. Instead of the major conflagration everyone warned about, the oil just gave off an indignant little hiss when I add the juice mixture.

If pressed for time and you need to blend the marinade while it is hot, leave the stopper out of the blender lid, and just loosely cover it with a kitchen towel so the pressure from the steam can escape. Also, don't fill more than 2/3 at the most.

This isn't a 4 fork recipe, it's a 10 fork recipe. I have used it on pork, chicken & fish. Everytime I have served it to guests I have received raves & requests for the recipe. This is definately a keeper. I now buy chicken breasts when on sale put them in the marinade in plastic bags & freeze. That way I am always prepared for unexpected guests.

After reading all the rave reviews, I just made this marinade. (Poured it over chicken breast, and froze in ziplock bag, per prior recomendation, to defrost and grill later in the week) So I haven't tasted it yet, but have to wonder about all the previous comments/warnings about hot liquid in the blender. Is there some reason why one shouldn't let the marinade cool in the cooking pan before transfering the contents to the blender? Maybe I'll be disappointed when I taste the results, but it seems to me like a less hazardous way to do this...

A question for those who've made this -- do you think it would be as good without the garlic?? I know, weird question but I am severely allergic to garlic. If you have ideas for substitutions, I'm open to that. If you just want to tell me I'm nuts, don't bother, it is a very real allergy and I'm not the only one in the world with it. More common than you think. Thanks for your thoughts.

Rating: 4
To "A Cook", regarding the "burnt garlic" question below: because you've mixed the garlic with the citrus juices BEFORE adding it to the hot oil, the garlic does not burn. The mixture does sizzle and spatter, however; have the pan lid handy. I made 12 pounds of grilled sirloin kabobs for 20 people (with plenty of black beans, rice, corn salad, tortillas, etc) and there was not ONE CUBE of meat left over. Try this marinade, you cannot miss!

This was the best marinade I've ever made. All the flavors came together perfectly - I wouldn't change a thing. I only marinated my chicken for 4 hours and it was unbelievably delicious. The chicken was tender and juicy and I ended up with more juices than I started with, I guess due to the chicken releasing juices during cooking. A fabulous recipe!

My family loved this recipe and it was really easy. Rather than cook the marinade as it suggests in the recipe, I just mixed all the ingredients together in a ziploc and marinated the chicken that way. I cooked it on the grill and it was great.

Excellent marinade -- pour the entire thing over the chicken when marinating and roasting; do not use the 1 cup as suggested in the recipe. To avoid skin burns and flames: Turn off flame completely; hold lid in one hand, and slowly slide juice mixture into pan; immediately cover with lid. The heat cools down at once and you can take the lid off once you hear it stop sizzling. It's a safe way to approach this recipe.

This marinade is incredible! I have made it 3 times in 2 months, each time allowing more people to try it. Rave reviews. I recommend that you make the marinade and freeze your meat with it. Then let everything thaw in the fridge for up to 3 days before you grill. Absolutely fabulous! As a personal chef, I have made this for my clients and they love it as well.

Oh Sweet Mystery of Life At Last I've Found You! This marinade is utterly the BEST, BEST, BEST, and well worth the time and effort. Just knowing this, intuitively, I made a double batch. I used the first half to marinate a pork roast overnight. I dumped the whole thing, marinade and all, into a pyrex pan with some sliced onion on top, and roasted it at 375 for a couple hours, used the pan drippings as gravy, and served it with black beans, rice, chopped cilantro, slices of lime. Magnifico! The second half of the marinade I will try with the chicken. IT WILL ROCK. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT!!!

I made the marinade for some chicken breasts that we threw onto the grill. Although it's a great marinade, I would highly recommend completely removing the smoking oil from the heat and letting it cool slightly before adding the citrus mixture. I didn't, and while being very cautious as recommended by previous reviewers, I still saw some pretty major two foot flames shoot up from the stove.

A lot of work but worth it. Be sure to secure the top of the blender when mixing all the ingredients (I did not and got mildly burned). Still - a marvellous marinade that is worth making from scratch.

We absolutely LOVED this marinade. We used skinned/boned chicken breasts and served it with a little (rice) linguine and steamed brocolli. The marinade was an excellent sauce over all--and the chicken was so tender! Also, I tossed some halved mushrooms into the chicken during the last few minutes of roasting (had to use them before they expired). This proved to be a tasty addition.

Very tasty marinade, was popular among my guests. The oil splattering is not as dangerous as it sounds in the recipe, but precautions are always good. Be careful when blending, as the recipe amounts will come close to filling a standard blender. Hot marinade exploding out of a blender is no fun. (Ouch! From experience...)

I must have missed something. How could I go wrong with 100% of everyone raving about this marinade? I did use it with a whole chicken, however, and perhaps it was not meant for that.

I made this twice. The first time I followed the directions to the "T". The second time I heated everything (except the fresh cilantro)at once and added the cilantro as I was processing it. Going through all that mess the first time did not make it taste any more flavorful than it did the second time. After making it the second time, I added chopped serrano chilis and liked the added zing. This wonderful and I'm trying it on fish next time.

I used this marinade on vegetables roasted on the charcoal grill. I just made an aluminum foil packet filled with quartered skin-on red potatoes, some sliced carrots and some shallots with the marinade drizzled over the veggies. Just put the packet on the grill (not directly over the hottest part of the coals so you don't burn the vegetables) and roast for 40 to 50 minutes. Turn the packet over after 25 minutes or so to roast evenly. It gives the vegetables a great flavor! (When you remove the packet from the grill and open it up, be careful not to burn your fingers with the hot steam that comes out).

This marinade made the most wonderful and tender chicken! Ditto the cook from Portland. DO NOT FILL YOUR BLENDER MORE THAN 1/4 FULL AT A TIME WITH HOT LIQUID. It will take longer, but at least you won't get burned or have to clean marinade off your kitchen ceiling. This is my husband's new favorite. Tastes great over yellow saffron rice. I will be trying it on pork tenderloin and am sure it will be as wonderful as the chicken.
