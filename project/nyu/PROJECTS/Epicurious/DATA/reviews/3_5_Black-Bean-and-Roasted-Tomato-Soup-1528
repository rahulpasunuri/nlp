this was so yummy with following changes: - way more garlic and onions and a jalepeno pepper - lots of cumin (maybe a tablespoon or more) but skipped the oregano - fresh corn - cilantro, grated cheddar, and chopped green onions as garnishes.

I made a recipe for 2. I used chicken broth and needed at least 50% more because I pureed all the veggies and beans and the soup was really thick. I added about 1 teaspoon of chipotle chile puree (based on reviews that it needed some spice) and used light sour cream for the yogurt. Good but not worth a repeat.

Well, well, reading all the other reviews first would have saved me from a big mess here: processor leaking, spilling over and my ending up with practically every pot in the kitchen dirty... Now, for the soup, it is true that cumin and chipotles will help, but what is the point of roasting those vegetables in the first place if the depth of flavor promised (and undetectable in my opinion)ends up getting overwhelmed by the black beans and in dire need of a pick-me-up? It was okay but not sensibly different, for all the trouble, from any other black bean soup recipe.

This is a pretty good recipe, but it needs tweaks. Otherwise it can be a bit bland. I added a cup of cilantro leaves when I blended the vegetables and beans together. I also added some lime juice, some cumin, a dash of Tabasco sauce, and tossed in a chipotle smoked pepper for added flavor. This is a great base recipe; jazz it up the way you like.

I love this soup and so do the kids! It's easy although a little time consuming to put together. I use about a dozen tomatoes and up the quantities on all the other ingredients because it keeps well. A cold weather staple!

Great soup! Served it to a bunch of junk food addicted teenagers and they LOVED it. The roasted tomatoes add a wonderful flavor. This is now my favorite black bean soup!

We really enjoyed this soup, made with home-grown vegs. I did use extra garlic, roasting a whole head, leaving the cloves in their shells while roasting then squeezing the soft clove out & de-skinning the tomatoes before blending (which I did with my immersion blender - much easier). I also used chicken stock instead of veg for flavor, and added a little smoked paprika for the extra kick that everyone said was needed, and this turned a blah soup into excellent. Served topped with a little grated extra-old cheddar & cheddar- scallion biscuits (recipe on this site -- DO check it out!).

I was kind of disappointed with this recipe. It wasn't disgusting or anything, it just wasn't that great for me.

Rating: 3
After roasting the vegetables (including more whole garlic cloves than called for in the skin), I added the stock directly into the Dutch oven with vegetables and peeled garlic. My immersion blender pureed it wonderfully without having to use the processor. I found this a little bland, so added more oregano. Possibly could have been the tomatoes, as they didn't get a chance to 'ripen' beforehand. Overall, a good recipe, made it for a client, so spicy wasn't an option.

I 'blended' this recipe and the one for BLACK BEAN SOUP WITH CHIPOTLE CHILES. I only had dried black beans, so I prepared them in the crock pot with the chipolte, garlic, & cumin- that gave the soup a little 'kick.' I also used all the tomatos I had in the house and they worked out fine. I used a large red onion, and chicken stock that I had made earlier in the day. I, too, made a mess with the puree step until I realized that there IS a measurement on the food processor that says 'max liquid!!!" I just pureed the veggies without the liquid. I also added rainbow chard with the last step.

This could have been a disaster! First, when I poured the broth from the roasting pan into the food processor, much of it drained out the bottom of the processor, over the counter onto the floor. Yuuck. Don't know how that happened. OK, then I was careful in adding more broth without the spills. Then, the result though good; needed more zip. I added three heaping tablespoons of Chinese Black Bean sauce. That made the soup too salty. Then, I had to buy and add two cans of low-sodium black beans, slightly pureed, to the pot. It was fabulous! The low fat yogurt on top was a great addition. A guest told me that the combination of the yogurt and soup was like a roller coaster on his tongue.

I love this soup! It does need a little kick, though. I either add tobasco (smoked tobasco is great) or canned hot chipotle peppers (which I puree first). I also add lime juice and serve with cornbread.

This soup is amazing! All of the flavors mix well together. It doesn't hurt that it is so healthy and it freezes well, either. (Though the carrots do get a tiny bit stringy.) Everyone should try this soup!

Really good soup. I actually roasted the carrot along with the rest of the veggies and it was really great. Excellent recipe to play around with.

This is one of my favorite soups, I've made it several times. The only caution I have is to make sure the vegetables are very well roasted, otherwise the flavor lacks a bit. I like to serve it with jiffy corn bread mix made with a small can of chopped jalapenos and a cup of shredded cheddar. Fast, cozy weekday dinner.

I've been making this for several years now, and I'd only give this 4 forks with my additions: Double the amount of carrot; red, yellow and jalepeno peppers, and red onion roasted along with the tomatoes. I use chicken broth instead of veg, add some cumin, and a bunch of chopped cilantro. Mue Bueno!

It needs more flavor. I added roasted jalapenos and roasted half a head of garlic, plus added a teaspoon of cumin and half-teaspoon of celery salt, and double the tomatos (with the suggested cayanne pepper). Allspice could work, too.

What a great recipe to make when you have nothing left in the house! Used items had on hand (black beans and red kidney beans) omitted the roasted the tomatoes (ran out), and it was still awesome! Economical and fabulous!

Thanks to the previous comments (more garlic and carrots and a pinch of cayanne) this turned out to be a wonderful soup. A new favourite in my recipe files!

Awsome winter soup! Made this last night and had a sample of it before I put it in the fridge. I wanted it to sit overnight so the flavors could blend before we ate it. Believe me that was hard to do. All I can say is that from the sample both my husband and myself can't wait for dinner. I also added a bit of cayenne to kick it up a bit. I was out of oregano so I added basil. Worked out just fine. Instead of yogurt, in a food processor I blended 8 oz of low fat sour cream with one bunch cilantro and a little salt and pepper til smooth and creamy. Very nice addition! This was so good I'll probably make a triple batch for the Superbowl party. YUM!!!!! GO RAIDERS!!!!!!

Excellent touch to roast the vegetables. I also started with a base of browned sweet Italian sausage, onions and garlic,to which I added the roasted vegetables. Added diced tomatoes, both beef and vegetable broth and seasonings (basil, oregano, salt, pepper and a touch of sugar). Simmered for an hour, then added both black and white beans with juices (from cans). The household rates it the best soup ever!!!

Oh man, this was delicious. The roasted vegetables made it so much more than your average black bean soup. It does, however, take a bunch of time to make. Fully worth it!

I feel a bit abashed rating this recipe at all... I ran out of tomatoes and ended up subbing pico de gallo, with fingers crossed. Amazingly, it turned out good enough for a weekday meal. But (and it's hypocritical for me to say so, I know) it seemed like a bit too much work for a pretty ordinary dish. Though the blender thing is a life-saver :)

This is a great soup with just a few minor additions. 4 jalapeno peppers seeded and chopped. 2 tablespoons fresh squeezed lime-juice. I served it with the following options; The yogurt that was called for, shredded cheddar cheese, chopped scallions, sour cream and fresh jalapeno corn bread.

This is really tasty, and easy to prepare. Because I like food a bit spicier I added some ancho chili, cilantro....and since it was kicking about in the fridge, a chorizo sausage.

This is a good and simple soup. Roasting the veggies adds a lot of depth - don't skip giving them a good, long roast to. I would suggest more garlic, especially since one roasts it, and would recommend pulling off the tomato skins after roasting - other than that, the recipe is solid as is.

My family loves this soup, have made it many times. I cut back on the onion a little and add more oregano. I also use white beans instead of black to improve color and have a milder 'bean' tase influence.

Very filling, delicious with tortilla chip chunks. Would recommend adding some spice- tabasco or hot peppers. Otherwise, very tasty and healthy soup!

A good concept but it needed more flavor. I added a bit of chipotle sauce and fresh cilantro to liven it up. I also doubled the amount of roasted garlic. In the end, it was definitely good enough to make again.

I'd give the recipe only 2 forks as written, but with tweaks, 3 forks. I omitted the carrot and doubled the onion, omitted the oregano and used twice the amount of parsley and a little thyme and lots of pepper (also use extra-virgin olive oil for roasting for the best flavor). After pureeing the soup, I was still displeased with the texture, as there were still some onion pieces and tomato skins, so I ran it through a strainer. I used the canned black beans as specified, and added all of them to the blender for a smooth soup. I also added 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander and 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chili powder from Penzey's, which gave the soup a lovely depth of flavor, yet didn't make it too spicy to eat. All in all, excellent--very easy, even with the added step of straining, and can be made completely ahead. I loved it, and will make it again.

I have made this numerous times and enjoy the ease of preparation. I prefer roasting the veggies on the bbq in a cast iron pan and increase the amount of carrots and garlic. I use chicken broth as this is always available in my pantry.

This was very good soup, however, I made the mistake of not pureeing the vegetable mixture enough, so I ended up with bits and pieces of vegetables, rather than a smooth puree. I added celery in the puree mixture as well.

I prepared as directed and discovered it was bland. Next time, I used canned fat free chicken broth, added roasted poblano peppers, and jalapenos when I added diced carrots. Garnished with reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese, fat free yogurt, and fresh cilantro. Much better! Served with cornbread and tossed green salad. ps instead of using processor, used hand held blender right in soup pot after adding roasted veggies, broth and beans..so simple!

With a few changes, this is delicious. I found it bland as written, so I roasted the tomatoes at 400 degrees instead of 350 for a full hour (this greatly enhanced the "roasted" flavor). I also increased the herbs to 1 teaspoon each oregano and thyme, used one l6oz. can of Progresso Black Bean Soup (instead of two cans of beans)and added some tabasco (roasted red peppers would be nice prior to using the blender). With all of these changes, it was fantastic!! A real family favorite.
