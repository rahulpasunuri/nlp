I cooked it for a little over 4 hours instead of the suggested 5. Pretty tasty with whipped cream

We've made this for about five years now and it's always a big hit. Added dark chocolate chips to help with the dryness.

Very dry. Had to wrap with rum soaked cheese cloth for several weeks to make edible. This is much more like Christmas cake than plum pudding.

This pudding is much lighter and tastier than the traditional suet-laden English plum pudding, but it also was quite dry. I may try making it again, however, adding more butter and liquors for moisture.

Sort of a cross between a cake and a pudding - delicious and not too heavy
