this is the best sauerkraut recipe! We've made it at least 5 times so far. It is very easy. Always a hit.

This is a fun recipe. I did modify it a bit based an Beard's other recipe on this site and his comments about choucroute to Helen Evans Brown (see Jessica's Biscuit for a wonderful collection of his letters to her). I skipped the salt pork and used a nice smokey bacon. I added apples to the onions and only cooked the sauerkraut with chunks of smokey Virginia ham about 2 hours.I added cooked smoked franks, sausage, and bratwurst and some previously cooked pork chops. It was just lovely with buttered dark pumpernickel bread. I even sprung for the split of champagne in the presentation and it was a nice touch.This is a wonderful dish that allows for lots of variation.

I made this in a Dutch oven outdoors. This is hands down the BEST sauerkraut recipe I've ever tired. What a treat (good old James Beard, never one to scrimp on the fat!). I made this for my boyfriends birthday dinner and it was loved by all. I used good champagne and I think it really paid off. TRY THIS!

What a magnificant culinary marriage of tastes! Will make again for special occasions, especially in the Fall and Winter months.
