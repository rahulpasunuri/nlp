This couldn't be easier and is super delicious! I doubled the recipe and just used 1 cup of dried bread crumbs and one egg, in addition to the pesto. Easy, easy, easy and very good!

Rating: 3
easy peasy & full of flavor. Nice with fresh linguini. I use panko breadcrumbs, and either add chili flakes or use a spicy arriabiata marinara to kick up the flavor. truly an easy hit when you want spaghetti & meatballs with lots of flavor and a lean meat.

This is a favorite quick dinner in our house. We sometimes have these as a sub sandwich with Mozzarella and saute onions and peppers.

I quadrupled this recipe, used home-made pesto and breadcrumbs (I've also used panko). I don't want to mess with the eggs, so used 1 whole per 2 egg whites. Put in a pretty pan, straight to oven, no stove top at all. Cooked at 350, came out PERFECT!!! Serving a day later on the side with angel hair pasta tossed in garlic, onion and fresh chopped tomatoes. Some chopped parsley on top. Oh, and a big green salad! Hello Sunday dinner.:)

Rating: 4
Great meal for when you don't feel like chopping anything! I resisted the urge to add onion, which I didn't miss! I added a little bit of fresh lemon zest and grated nutmeg (only one extra dish), which I think goes really well with the pesto flavor.

Rating: 4
The flavors in this recipe are totally right-on. Instead of following this recipe to the letter, I added 1 pound of ground turkey, 1 cup of panko breadcrumbs, an extra tablespoon of pesto, and red pepper flakes to the meatballs. Next I browned them in a pan with 1 teaspoon of olive oil and transfered them to a 350 oven where they cooked for 15-20 minutes until cooked through. I added them to my homemade marinara sauce and then served the meatballs and sauce with whole wheat penne. It was divine.

Rating: 3
This recipe is fantastic and will definitely become a weeknight staple in our house. I did follow another reviewers suggestion to double the meat, then use a whole cup of store-bought breadcrumbs and 5 tbs of pesto. I baked at 350 for 20 min, then added sauce on top and turned the heat down to 200 until the fam got home. They loved it!

Rating: 4
Turkey meatballs are usually so bland, but the pesto kicks the flavor of these up so much that I was able to pass them off on my family as "regular" meatballs. And they freeze great.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe as written except didn't bother removing the crusts from the bread and added fresh ground pepper to the meatball mix. I also baked the meatballs in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes before simmering them in the sauce for about 10 minutes before serving. It was delish! My husband who loves comfort food asked me to "add it to the rotation." A keeper!

A lower-fat comfort meal favorite. Good for fall/winter. Might also be nice with homemade arugula pesto.

Four forks for ease and great flavor. There is something about those meatballs you buy in the frozen section that don't taste right, and these are a great alternative. I doubled the turkey meat (sold in 1 lb packages), used 1 cup store bought bread crumbs, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 1 whole egg, and 5 Tbs. pesto. Baked them in the oven for 20 minutes at 375 degrees, and then plopped them in the store bought sauce. Easy and yummy. Picky 11 year old even loved them.

This is delicious with turkey but even better with ground chicken! I have been making it for years and have yet to meet someone that doesn't rave about it. Huge hit with kids!

I am giving this recipe four stars because of the effort/taste ratio. This was unbelievably easy. The meatballs were delicious. I doubled the recipe and accidentally only bought 3 cups of sauce, so my husband made some great meatball subs the next day. This will definitely be in the short rotation.

Rating: 2
These will be a good addition to "weeknight staples" for me. The pesto added a great flavor! I either made my balls too large or should have added a second egg white because they didn't stay held together too well. I also added red pepper flakes to spice them up a little and it was delish! My friend who ate them with me raved - she loved them and took the leftovers off my hands!

Rating: 4
This is a really easy, good dish. I've simplified it a bit--as if that's even possible! I had just had my kitchen cleaned and didn't want bubbling tomato sauce on my stove top...so....I made the meatballs (with ground veal and omitting the bread crumbs) and put them in my saute pan in a 425F oven for about 20 minutes. Then I reduced the heat to about 300F and added the sauce...heating slowly until hot and held it in a warm oven until the husband was home. No mess to clean up--nothing even stuck to the pan given the pesto:-)

Rating: 3
I will defintitely make these again and I will definitely brown them before i put them in the sauce- they are delish though!

Rating: 3
This was delicious.. but not exceptional. (That is why i gave it 3 stars instead of 4) My kids (ages 11 months and 3 years) LOVED this! They loved it even MORE than regular spaghetti and meatballs. This recipe is a keeper. Who would have thought that just adding some pesto would have changed ordinary meatballs into something SO GOOD! I used, 1lb ground turkey, 1/2c breadcrumbs, 1/4c pesto, 1 whole egg, 1/2 teas.of salt and 1/4 teas. of black pepper.

Rating: 3
Surprisingly tasty, very easy, fast enough for a weeknight meal. Best of all, it is quite healthy. A serving of four meatballs is 6 WeightWatchers points (by my calculations, using the WW site). I followed suggestions and baked the meatballs. I did not miss the grease!

We double the meat, but this is a frequent use favorite in our house.

Rating: 2
This recipe was easy, fast, and tasty. I seared the meatballs before cooking them in the sauce, and they were very flavorful. However, I think that the breadcrumb/turkey meat ratio is off. Though the flavor was delicious, they came out a little TOO "bready". Will definitely make again, and try cutting the portion of breadcrumbs in half.

Rating: 3
This dish was both easy and delicious. It is a great summer spaghetti and meatballs dinner. I read the reviews and baked the meatballs at 375 degrees for 20 minutes and then put them in the sauce. Fifteen minutes would be sufficient. I also made a simple marinara sauce and stirred a tablespoon of the pesto into it. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
Love this, and it's become a staple at our house. I usually make a huge batch (the 3 lb ground turkey package) and still almost never need to freeze any. I bake them and add to homemade/storebought (usually storebought with red wine, red onion, red pepper, garlic, basil and parmesean cooked in it) sauce, and serve over angel hair. This is one of the only meat products that my kids (3 and 6) will reliably eat, AND the adults in the house love it, too. Leftovers make great snacks by themselves and are awesome in a meatball sub with roasted red peppers, provolone, and pesto mayo.

Rating: 3
Awesomely delicious! However, the meatballs were green and neither my 3 year old nor the 13 month old would eat them. I baked them after reading other reviews which was good - maybe if they'd cooked in sauce they wouldn't be so green. I used an extremely fresh pesto from Fairway - maybe that's the source of the pervasive green instead of just green flecks? Delicious, just need to figure a way around the color.

Rating: 3
What a great, easy, healthy recipe! I made it almost exactly as written, but I doubled the recipe and used one whole egg instead of 2 egg whites and I also added a clove of garlic. I will definitely make these again.

Rating: 4
When I first found these meatballs, I made them all the time because they were easy and delicious. For some reason, I hadn't made them in a year and just tried them again -- and I'm so glad! The only thing I did differently was make them smaller and brown them before adding to sauce. Great recipe.

Rating: 3
I liked these a lot and thought that they make a nice, healthy weeknight meal. Next time I might bake them in the oven first like some other reviewers suggested, because mine came out almost too moist. I might also cut back on the pesto, and I may add some garlic. I thought that the recipe needed garlic, but my boyfriend disagreed. If you're looking for a good tomato sauce (instead of the disgusting Ragu that several reviewers complained about), I would highly recommend using Classico's fire roasted tomato and garlic. It's one of the best tomato sauces that I've ever had, and that's including homemade.

Rating: 4
These meatballs are easy, fast, yummy, and my 3-year-old will eat them -- which makes them an all-around great dinner. I've made them several times since finding this recipe and will continue to use it -- these "Mommy meatballs" are now preferred over my (chef) husband's!

Rating: 3
I did like this recipe. It was easy and fast, and the meatballs certainly stayed moist. I used extra sauce as many reviewers suggested, but actually I found that I had too much. The only problem I had was not the recipe's fault. My husband wanted to experiment and so we used a Cilantro-Garlic Pesto. he liked it, but I thought the cilantro was a little out of place and too noticeable. I will make this recipe again, but use the Basil Pesto for sure! Overall, I recommend the recipe for ease of preparation and flavor. It may not be good enough for company, but certainly good enough for a quick midweek meal.

Rating: 4
I usually never make meatballs because they never come out just right to me. The other day I decided to try once more to make good meatballs so I searched and found this recipe. I tried it and they were AMAZING! Usually meatballs are either to mushy or like a rock but these were perfect. I didn't get to use pesto though because I didn't have any at home and I used seasoned dry bread crumbs from the store and just added a little water to them to moisten. I took the advice of most of the other reviews and lightly oiled a baking sheet with olive oil, baked the meatballs at 350 degrees until I felt they were cooked through (about 30 mins), added them to some store bought sauce for a few minutes then served over wheat pasta. My boyfriend loved them and I'm so happy I found a good recipe for meatballs. I can't wait to try them with pesto.

Rating: 3
Delicious meatballs! My husband would not have know they where turkey if he hadn't seen the packaging in the trash. I used a pack of Jenny-O lean turkey, 1 1/2 C. of fat free rosemary croutons ground into crumbs, 1 egg + 1 egg white, 8 tbsp pesto, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp sea salt, and 1/4 C. asiago cheese. I then followed the suggestion of other reviewers and baked them in the oven at 375 for 40 minutes. Afterwards, I added them to the sauce. They where easy to make and tasted great. These will certainly be added into the regular dinner rotation!

Rating: 3
This was easier and faster than I thought. The recipe seemed a bit slim so I added a fourth cup of parsley, extra pesto, chopped onions, garlic and sprinkled some basil. They save well in the freezer. To my surprise, the meatballs did not have a strong pesto-y flavor. This is a fantastic alternative to meatier meatballs. Barelli whole wheat pasta is inexpensive and without that 'thick' taste that often comes with alternative grained pastas.

Sadly, when I made it, it was pretty tasteless. A little like not very good meatloaf.

Rating: 3
Delicious and a snap to make! The meatballs are really tender as they will soak up liquid from the sauce when simmering. As a result, this will make a chunky sauce even thicker. If you like sauce, you may want to reserve extra on the side. Also, use a great quality sauce because it definitely matters in this recipe.

Yummy and easy. To cook from SF who asked for other easy recipes, check out the marjoram chicken with cherry tomatoes on this website. Doesn't get any easier or yummier (or healthier).

Rating: 3
This is a good, quick recipe but nothing terribly exciting. I added a bit more pesto (about 3tbls) and a whole egg. It isn't worth raving about but it's a great quick weeknight dinner that's very satisifying and fairly healthy (I use multigrain pasta - you can barely taste the difference).

Rating: 4
I loved this one and received rave reviews from my fiancee as well. It was especially fabulous given that I literally threw it together while doing several other things. I doubled the turkey, used a whole egg, seasoned itallian breadcrumbs, pesto from a tube and fresh thyme and oregano and a large can of Trader Joe's sauce w/ whole wheat pasta. If you are a non-meticulous person like me who make a mess of browning meatballs, this recipe is for you!! Can anyone suggest other extremely easy/inexpensive/relatively healthy recipes like this from this site? Thanks!!

I tried these last night, my first time making meatballs. They were very, very easy, and satisfying. I added a little more pesto (about 3 tbsp), the egg yolk as well as white, some dried oregano, fresh ground black pepper, and just a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes. The only thing was the meatballs were pretty big and even a whole jar of sauce didn't really cover them-- however when simmered for 20 minutes with a lid on, and turning them about 3 times, they cooked perfectly. I thought it was too much for 2 but my husband ate his whole half. A great weeknight meal for the busy person/couple/family!

Rating: 3
I gave this three forks because the meatballs were great. Problem was I cooked them in the sauce as directed, although I made homemade sauce, and all the liquid evaporated before the meatballs cooked. I didn't have any more tomatoes, so I put the leftover pesto on the noodles, which was disappointing because it overshadowed the pesto taste in the meatballs. If you make this, make sure you have extra sauce on hand.

Rating: 4
This is so great! I make this often and always double it. Yum!

Rating: 3
I took the recommendations of other readers: I baked small meatballs in the oven for 20 mins at 375, and when doubling the recipe I used 1 whole egg + 1 white, 1 cup store-bought breadcrumbs, and 5 heaping tablespoons pesto. I always add a little red wine to my store-bought marinara, which complemented the other flavors well.

Rating: 4
This one is already a family favorite. Fast, easy to modify and delicious - everyone from my 3-year-old to my in-laws loves this and I can throw it together in under 30 mins. The character will vary a lot depending on the kind of pesto and sauce you use. Experiment with different combinations; my family likes an olive pesto with a heavy vegetable sauce the best.

Wow - After reading everyone's feedback, I was so eager to taste these I burned my tongue! Very tasty and so easy. As some others did, I modified this a little. I doubled it, added a whole egg, used 1 cup of store-bought breadcrubs mixed with a little grated parmesan and skipped the salt. I made small meatballs, browned them and simmered for 15-20 minutes. Will definitely make these frequently.

These meatballs are delicious! I cannot get my three-year old to eat ANYTHING, and he enthusiastically chowed down on them! I must admit, I made my own sauce, and I sauteed the meatballs in a little olive oil to brown them before adding the sauce to the skillet. Also, I didn't have any italian bread, so used Contadina Italian bradcrumbs and a little extra pesto. It's such an easy recipe, I don't think you can go wrong.I doubled the recipe and froze half for another quick dinner down the line.

Rating: 3
This was easy and very tasty for a weeknight dinner. I, like some of the other reviewers, baked the meatballs prior to adding them to the sauce to give them a bit of a "crust." The pesto wasn't as strong a flavor as I thought it would have been. Very nice, though!

We've been making these for about a year now. Try baking them at 375 for 40 mins. I just use premade breadcrumbs and sundried tomato pesto. These make a terrific meatball sub with some swiss cheese on a sourdough roll and just pour some Prego over the top. Easy, fast tasty!

Rating: 3
I haven't made this, but I make a Spaghetti and Sicilian Meatball recipe (I believe from this website), and that calls for baking the meatballs on a cookie sheet at 350 for 30 minutes, I like it because baking gives the meatballs a little "crispness"...some might like that option (it's so easy).

Next time I'd try making it with less breadcrumbs as the meatballs turned out pretty mealy but the pesto flavour was very nice. This was better the next day for lunch.

My 4 yr old daughter devoured her meatballs and didn't even want the noodles, which is why I gave it 3 forks. Also b/c of the ease of preparation. My husband and I didn't care for it as much. I think the meatball consistency was too mushy-next time I will probably brown them first. I do like the idea of using leftovers for meatball sandwiches!

A fast, easy main dish for a busy night after work or play. I've never made meatballs without browning them first, but I tried the recipe as written, and the meatballs kept their shape just fine. My kids won't eat spaghetti without meatballs of some sort, and these turkey ones were greeted with compliments. I'll make this again and again.

I've made this recipe at least twenty times. The meatballs are so tender because they're not browned first. I also love NOT browning them because of the time factor. These are a favorite at our house...Sometimes I just make these and we have meatballs with bread and salad. They also freeze really well. I freeze them raw, and then just pull a few out of the freezer and cook in the sauce. Yum.

I sauteed meatballs in a small amount of olive oil until brown before adding sauce to the pan. It helped to keep the meatballs firm - I also used season breadcrumbs instead of fresh bread. Chop and onion and shallot and mix into the meatballs too-adds a nice flavor. Also, instead of plain basil pesto try out the sun dried tomato pesto - Very good!

Ok, I changed this completely. But I'm forvever grateful for the idea it gave me, because the meal I made after reading this was Fabulous!! I read the epicurious recipe for Sicillian meatballs, and then this one, and couldn't decide. So here is what I did. I mixed lean ground beef with 1/2 cup pesto sauce, 1/8 cup tomato sauce, 1 cup breadcrumbs, 1 really finely chopped sweet onion, 3 tablespoons chopped almonds, and 3 tablespoons chopped Craisins. (I don't like currents) I mixed all of this in my food processor, made 2 inch meatballs, and cooked them for 20-25 minutes on a cooking sprayed baking sheet at 375ºF. I made my own tomato sauce with 2 cans 12 oz tomato sauce, 3 tbsp sweet dried basil, 1 tbsp oregano and 1 tsp brown sugar. Cooked for 30 minutes at lo heat, add meatballs and cook for 10 minutes. Serve over spaghetti needles. Soooooo delicious.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I doubled the meatball fixings, but just put a whole egg in instead of 2 whites, and I think it turned out fine... froze half of it for a later date, and made the rest. Delish, and sooo easy! I could throw it together easily even when husband was away and I was busy watching my 14 month old twins!

Rating: 3
I cooked half of the meatballs in the sauce and I fried the other half in olive oil. Big surprise, everyone preferred the fried ones! It is not the healthy choise, but I didn't like the mushiness of the ones cooked in the sauce. I did love the taste of the meatballs and they were so easy to make. I get excited when I remember I have a few of these babies tucked away in my freezer!

Rating: 4
This really is a great staple recipe...the meatballs are not dry like some turkey meatballs can be. This probably comes from cooking them in the sauce versus frying them. I did use "Italian style" ground turkey (an accidental buy at the market) and they tasted delicious, much better than just plain ground turkey, also I agree with the other cook, the more pesto the better!!!

As a novice cook I found this recipe easy to follow, delicious, and it took under 30 minutes to make. Perfect for a weeknight dinner. I added a little more pesto than the recipe called for and my boyfriend said that he would have liked it with even more pesto. I made extra servings as well and the leftovers reheated *beautifully*. Will definitely make again.

Excellent! Simple and tasty, this is a staple at our house. I have a 2 1/2 year old & a 2 month old, so when I make this, I prepare a double batch in small and large sizes. I prepare some fresh that night. The rest, I freeze after shaping the meatballs. Then during the week when we need a quick dinner, I can pop out however many meatballs we need and toss them right into a pot with the jarred sauce for another quick--and fresh--no-hands dinner. This is a real lifesaver when my husband's away and I have to feed the two boys on my own!

Rating: 3
This is great - quick and tasty. I didn't have ground turkey, so I pulsed some raw chicken breast in the food processor. The meatballs turned out a bit squishy/lumpy; next time I might bake them instead of sauteeing. Still and all, yum! This one's a keeper.

I would make this recipe over and over despite my general dislike for ground turkey. I am considering mixing in some ground beef to improve the taste a little. Overall though, a quick and easy meal that I am recommending to my college age brother and his friends.

Wonderful, different flavor to the meatballs. My 5 year old daughter rarely will eat meat of any kind, and she absolutely devoured these!

I made this one night for a party of four and everyone loved it. It makes great leftovers too!

This dish was okay in favor but I would ground the turkey meat in the sauce then add to the pasta instead of having meatballs in pasta.

I would make the meatballs a lot smaller if I ever did it again.
