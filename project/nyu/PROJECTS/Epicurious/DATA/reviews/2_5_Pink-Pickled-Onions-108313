I didn't read the recipe carefully enough ahead of time to notice that it requires a very large jar, which I didn't have around. I had to reduce the recipe to fit it in the biggest jar I could find, and I discovered that it comes out just fine divided by eight. Actually, that turned it to be more than enough pink pickled onions for my 10 guests. The onions were good, but a bit heavy on the cinnamon. I think a lot depends on the particular brand or batch of pickling spice that you use.

I served the pink pickled onions for my fourth of july party this year. They provided a lot of good color for the buffet and pair nicely with Texas smoked sausage. My guests also put the onions on their burgers too. You can make them a week ahead of time. With that said, I boiled the glass container to guarantee that the onions would not spoil in the vinegar solution. This is a fool proof method.

Loved these! Easy to make but next time I'm cutting the amount of rosemary in half--too strong for my taste.
