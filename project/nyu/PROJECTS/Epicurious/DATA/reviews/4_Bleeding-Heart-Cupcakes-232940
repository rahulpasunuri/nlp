These are absolutely delightful. I recommend cutting a portion from the /top/ of the cupcake, removing a small section from the bottom of this slice (what was once the centre of the cupcake), partially filling the hole, and then replacing the (now smaller) portion of cupcake top. This prevents any issue with leaking/unstable sides of cupcakes.

It's easier to fill the cupcakes with the 230 tip of Wilton or a dessert decorator. You don't have to cut and take out a piece of the bread, just insert the tip in the center and press and... Voilá!

I love this recipe. I make it at halloween instead of at valentines day, and I use cherry pie filling instead of strawberry jam. The cherry pie filling gives the center a nice snap. Everyone loves these cupcakes. I also sometimes add some cherry flavor to the batter and icing, and sometimes even make it with red velvet cake.

This will probably be an annual valentine's day cupcake that I make. The recipe actually made 24 standard sized cupcakes, so prepare to add extra time to add the filling and decorate them all. It was work, but well worth it. Everyone enjoyed the novelty concept. The only change I had to make was to add some cornstarch to the frosting to thicken it, but no biggie. Here's a tip for those that don't have pastry bags: use a ziploc bag and cut the tip off one side on the bottom--you get excellent results. I hope you enjoy this recipe too!
