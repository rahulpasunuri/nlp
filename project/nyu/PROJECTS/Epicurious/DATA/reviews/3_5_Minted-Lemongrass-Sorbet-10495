This recipe is in dire need of acid. I cut the sugar to 1/2 C and tasted the strained product. All I could taste was sugar. Fixed by adding 1 tsp kosher salt and juice from 1 lime (strained). Delicious.

I made the recipe as written the first time, and though it didn't taste bad, the mint totally overpowered the lemongrass. I would cut way back on the mint and double the lemongrass the next time as well as increase the steeping time for the lemongrass. I agree with others who recommend cutting back a little on the sugar. However, if you cut back too much, you will change the texture of the finished product, so I wouldn't cut out too much.

This was great! The mint and lemongrass balanced each other perfectly. Next time I might omit some of the sugar because it was super sweet but this recipe is a keeper!

SUBLIME! So delish, refreshing and unusual. Used as palate cleanser. Just the right amount of sweetness and exoticness for me! I accidentally made the recipe wrong and it still turned out great. I forgot to puree the mixture. I just steeped it like you would for tea, and the strained it (although I did steep for a minute or two longer than I should have because I could not find my mesh strainer). I can't believe I totally missed the puree step, but when I make it again I won't bother, it was so perfect just the way it was!!!!!!! Why make sorbet at home with flavors you can get at the grocery store. Make this instead. Note: this loses flavor in freezer after 2 days and is not nearly as good.

Got rave reviews at a meeting of our local herb society, and husband really liked it too.

This provided the perfect interlude for a lengthy October dinner party and again at Thanksgiving. I may have used less sugar the first time, because it was sweeter the second time, but yet delicious. The lemongrass and mint blend deliciously and it is easy. Caution: let it cool before blending. I had an exploding blender and green goo on my kitchen wall. Also I would add the sugar after blending for less mess. The first time I used my ice cream maker, the second time I simply froze it in a bowl, then blended it in batches and put in a muffin tray to re-freeze before serving. Both worked.
