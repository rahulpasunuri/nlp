Has anyone made this in advance - either the crust or the whole tart? Thanksgiving is tough for me this year since I have to work Wednesday but I'm thinking I could at least make the crust Sunday... Any thoughts?

Hmmmm, the other reviews said this wasn't overly sweet, mine turned out to be rot-your-teeth sweet, but wonderful! It was the hit of my Thanksgiving dinner. My usual pie crust worked fine as did baking it in a pie pan.

Great receipe. I made it back in March when the magazine came out and liked it so much I am looking it up again now so I can serve it for Thanksgiving. It definitely gives pecan pie a run for its money

It is great and pretty easy to make. I would say that lightly salted cashews that I have used were better than the unsalted ones. The combination of sweet and salty sometimes is wonderful, not that we could even taste the salt on cashews. Definitely use different kinds of nuts!

This is a great recipe and actually fun and pretty simple to make. I've never even made any kind of tart before. I made it for a birthday and everyone loved it (and it's a nice elegant-looking alternative to traditional birthday cake). I used all pecans this time, which was excellent and much better than way-too-sweet pecan pie made with corn syrup. The crust was like a nice moist shortbread cookie but not quite as sweet and very buttery! I will definitely make this in the future with the mixture of nuts in the recipe instead of all pecans. So glad I found this recipe!

Neither too sweet nor too gooey, but rich and full of flavour. Who'd have thought that another nut tart recipe could make pecan pie seem like "plain old"? The crumbly, shortbread-like crust is forgiving and quite easy to work. The combination of the three nuts is inspired. Don't neglect to toast the nuts before putting them in the filling; watch the pine nuts closely. They don't take much time. You could probably substitute an equal quantity of marmalade or cane syrup for the tablespoon of honey, but I think corn syrup might be too bland. This is definitely going in my regular dessert rotation.
