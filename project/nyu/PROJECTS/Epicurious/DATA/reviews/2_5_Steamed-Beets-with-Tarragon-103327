This is a nice way to serve beets. I took the fresh ground pepper idea, a good suggestion.

The fresh tarragon is absolutely delicious with the beets, and freshly ground pepper adds a lot to it as well. I'm not sure that the butter is necessary and might try it without next time.

I never knew beets could taste so good. I sprinkled them with roasted sesame seeds to finish it off. Delicious!
