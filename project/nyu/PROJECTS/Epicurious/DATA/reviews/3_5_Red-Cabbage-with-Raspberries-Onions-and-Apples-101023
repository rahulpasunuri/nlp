My Dad is German, he loves vinegar and sugar combo's, he' also a big fan of cabbage. I make my own raspberry vinegar, we both love apples. So guess what this recipe was a hit! Beyond that it kept in a cold fridge for over a week and was still great!!!! Had it as a side at Thanksgiving and then again with a pork roast, and then again with a Turkey sandwich. It's sturdy, like pickles. I want to give this dish 4 forks, but for some reason my computer is not allowing more than three, sorry.,... I'm on a Mac, is that the reason??

i served this dish with lamb chops, scalloped yams and potatoes and green beans and everyone raved about it...the subtle taste of the raspberries was a compliment to the cabbage and apples and a lovely surprise.

Very sweet, with the frozen raspberries, but good if you like raspberries. Makes far more than 8 servings.

I tried this recipe after I was unable to find my old favorite in my recipe file. This is a great way to serve the cabbage and apple mixture. Based on other reviews, I omitted the raspberries and used half red wine vinegar and half raspberry vinegar - only because I have been used to the red wine flavor and was afraid the raspberry vinegar would overpower the cabbage. I was happy with the result. Raspberry vinegars do vary in their strength, so be careful if you use the full amount of the raspberry. I made this ahead and reheated just before serving, and it tasted great served for my Oktoberfest meal with a sauerbraten main course that I found on this site.

Cook and Carly, while amusing you're both wrong in this case. Substitutions are no big deal; don't be such purists. Also you totally screw up the real review rating with spurious comments about how recipes should be approached.

I wanted to make this dish with ingredients I had on hand. I used green cabbage instead of red, and some fresh cranberries. I enjoyed the cabbage side dish very much. It turned a lovely rosy pink color after the cranberries popped. I think the sweet/bitterness of the cranberries complemented the cabbage, probably more than raspberries would anyway. I also substituted the raspberry vinegar with apple cider vineger, and I recommend you julienne the apple slices for better consistency. Also, the mustard cream sauce was very tasty, but I would thicken a little with a beurre manie the next time. Also, did not have any mustard seeds, but did not seem to miss them.

I cooked the cabbage on low simmer for 6 hours. We had a dinner party for 12 and it was a big hit. It went great with the pork roast.

I would make this recipe again, with a few changes. I wound NOT use a stick of butter. For what? The butter overpowered the dish. Next time I'd just use enough butter to saute the shallots, about a tablespooon. Although the raspberries give it a great color, I'd cut them in half, only because the seeds are an unwelcome surprise.

So-so but I'm not a big cabbage fan. Added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to counter balance the tartness.

Delicous side dish, especially for fall and winter. Will be enjoyed even by those who don't think they like cabbage. I made it for a dinner party of 12 and it was a big hit. Works perfectly with beef or pork or salmon and a green vegetable and perhaps a corn or squash souffle -- gives you lots of color range for the plates or buffet -- an added benefit to great taste. Great to serve on a big white or light colored platter for contrast. I do recommend that the first 15 minutes you simmer WITH the cover on the pot so that the cabbage gets steamed and cooked through because there is a lot in the pot, then uncover for next 20-25 to cook off the liquid. I used a sweet onion (vidalia) which i think works best -- any sweeter onion. You can also add or hold a few raspberries back to garnish on top when you serve.

I served this with the Pork Medallions With mustard sauce and it was a very big hit. Everyone thought it was great. I think this time I'll serve it with garlic mashed potatoes. The different taste were awsome. On the mustard sauce I used a real heavy beer and it gave it a nice bite.

This dish has to be one of the worst things I have ever made, ever. I made it for a friend who is also a "foodie" and he thought it was terrible too. It is pretty but tastes awful.

Served it with a baked chicken dish and Creamy/Garlic potatoes. It added just the right "zip" and color. Really hate those nasty little seeds in the raspberries tho. I'll be finding them in my bridgework next week.

It is an excellent side dish. I made it for Easter and I served it with lamb. It also makes a great color contrast when served with mashed potatoes. My mother loved it, and she had me make it again.

This recipe was such fun! I made this dish for Easter dinner with our leg of lamb and eventhough no one knew if they would like it, we all enjoyed the flavor combinations. The dish ends up being very sweet and having a strong raspberry flavor with subtle onion overtones. Of course, all the ingredients turn a beautiful red color that adds another dimension to any meal. I recommend cooking the cabbage until just to your liking, I prefered it a bit underdone for a crunchier consistency. This dish also reheats in the microwave beautifully!
