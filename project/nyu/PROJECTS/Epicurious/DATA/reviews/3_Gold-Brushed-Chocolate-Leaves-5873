Easier to make than I would have thought though the rose leaves didn't work well for me. I used Grapefruit leaves off a tree in my yard...not great veining, but did the trick. At my local pastry shop, they suggested thin cotton gloves (they sell them) when peeling the leaves away and boy did they help! I noticed that when I didn't have them on (I made leaves in batches) the choclate started to melt almost right away as I peeled!

A beautiful touch, and easier to execute than you might think. I used camillia leaves of various sizes. Instead of completely covering the leaves with the gold dust, I stroked on "veins" of gold, following the lines of the natural veins in the leaf. This created a lovely "painterly" effect. Tips: (1) Eight ounces of chocolate is way too much for 15 leaves--five or six ounces would be plenty. (2) To peel the leaves from the chocolate, I held the leaf, chocolate side up, in my right hand, and, starting at the stem end, slipped my left thumb between the two layers and slid it toward the leaf tip, bending back the camillia leaf as I went. This worked better as the leaves warmed up a tad. (3) Be prepared to work fast when applying the gold--the leaves are very thin and start melting right away.

I live in northwest Washington, where can I get the gold leaf to brush on?
