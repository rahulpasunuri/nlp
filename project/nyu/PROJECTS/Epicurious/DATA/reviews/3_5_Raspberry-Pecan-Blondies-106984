I love this recipe! I add about a half a bag of white chocolate chips to it...I love the combination of white chocolate and raspberry. I've had the same problem as many of you have with it not cooking completely and getting too overcooked along the sides. This time though, they turned out so great and so good.

I didn't have a 9x9 pan so used a 9x7 and didn't have foil so I just buttered and floured the pan. Perhaps this is what led to the disastrous result - overcooked bottoms and undercooed tops. I think they would have been great if they had cooked correctly.

I used the 9 x 13 pan as others suggested, and used frozen raspberries as others said there were no problems. Turns out there were plenty! They did not cook through at all, the middle was incredibly raw, especially around the raspberries. Maybe it had something to do with the frozen raspberries, but I think even fresh ones wouldn't help this. On the plus side, they were pretty tasty.

Made these for an office party and they were a hit. I used the 13 by 9 by 2 pan. It was the perfect size and they baked throughout without the slightest burning on the sides. Next time I may use walnuts instead of pecans!!

I've made these several times but tried them today substituting chopped fresh cranberries and like them even better. Used a 9 x 13 pan and baked for 30 minutes. No leftovers!

I used a 6x12" pan and they were cooked evenly all the way through in the given cooking time. But they were bland - even the tartness of the raspberries couldn't save them. And too cake-like to qualify as a true blondie. There are better recipes out there

I made this recipe without changing anything, and it was awesome. I only had a slightly smaller tin to bake it in, but it was perfectly baked, and a real crowd pleaser. The next week I tried it with blueberries and chocolate chips and it was also fantastic.

I flash-freeze raspberries when they are on sale and use them right out of the freezer for this recipe with perfect results. Every time I make these, I get rave reviews and requests for the reccipe. A big hit! I use the 13x9x2 pan.

These are very good, if kind of humble looking. The tartness of the raspberries is a nice contrast to the rich, buttery flavor. The only problem I've had is with the texture; I've made them twice and both times they were underdone in the middle. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan as others suggested, and increased the cooking time. The edges were almost overdone but the center remained very "fudgy". Also, the batter is really thick and hard to spread (it's easy to make them too high, which probably adds to the texture problems). You have to poke the raspberries down deep with your fingers.

I agree with the cooks from Wilton and Sonoma County, the recipe didn't turn out right. It was hard on the edges and gooey in the centre. I would much rather make a raspberry brownie recipe than this one.

I made this recipe for my in-laws two years ago. Now we are visiting them again for the holidays. This is all they can think about and have asked me to make it again. Just goes to show how great these blondies are, with requests coming across the country and two years later! I also used a 9x13 pan, reduced the baking time a bit, and they turned out wonderfully.

Very good. Used 9x13 pan and baked just a little short of suggested time. Also used frozen raspberries. Everyone loved them. Will make again.

Rating: 1
Very disappointing. I've never left this bad of a review before. I used an 9x11 pan (taking others heed that the 9x9 was too small, and my 9x13s were in use). After 25 additional minutes of baketime, the middle was still verrrry wet and the edges were hard as a rock. I finally pulled it out and gave up. I would suspect my oven of problems, but batches of other baked goods done right before, and right after, on the same day, turned out perfectly.

I tried this today and found it underdone in the middle and overdone on the edges (as previous reviewers). Loved the idea of this, but didn't love the result. Will look for another blondie recipe.

In a 9x13 pan, this turned out perfectly. I shared them with friends and family - I'm very popular right now. A new favorite. Thanks.

In short: heed the other reviews and use a larger (9X13) pan. In length: After baking for 65 minutes (15 minutes longer than estimate) my bars resembled dark caramelies more than blondies.=) The toothpick came out clean, but they were overdone on the edges and the center was just not right. I like the addition of raspberries and decided to do what I should have done in the first place...add them to my tried and trusted blondie recipe. Good luck!

Yes. Yes. Yes. Go make these. NOW! Used frozen raspberries with no demerits. Chewy. Sweet. I mistakenly baked for far too long, and they were very forgiving.

I think this is an amazing recipe. The raspberries are delicious and I have made them many times always to rave reviews. They are also easy which is a definite plus. I always use frozen raspberries. Definitely give these a try

WOW! The absolute best use of my fresh raspberries. Thanks for all the tips: I too left out the white sugar and used a 9x13 pan for 50 minutes- PERFECT!!!!

This recipe was terrific. I took the advice of others and used a 9 by 13 pan.I did not have pecans on hand, so I substituted walnuts and almonds. We gobbled them up. Don't miss out on this one!

OH MY GOSH- DELISH. I think mine turned out differently because i used frozen raspberries and the juices really soaked into the batter while cooking, but when they were done, they were chewy and gooey and full of flavor! My end for the perfect blondie recipe is over- i have found it! This recipe would even be good without the raspberries! I've already made this twice in one week! P.s. I'M fat

Delicious and absolutely beautiful! I made them in a 9x13 pan and baked for the stated time and they turned out perfectly. The macadamia nut/white chocolate chip combination sounds great, I'll try that next time.

Rating: 4
I am tasting this for the first time and it is so much better than I'd expected. And even easier! I couldn't decide btwn this recipe and another so instead of the pecans I added 3/4c of chopped macadamies and 1/4 c of white chocolate chips. Also, I had blueberries in season here so I sprinkled those on 1/2 and raspberries on the other half. Both are delicious. I was concerned the blondies were getting too brown but I kept poking it only to find the batter soft in the center. I ended up doing 45 min in a 11x9 pan in a toaster oven at 325 degrees. I like it on the gooey side.

7/12/04 I reviewed this recipe previously, but thought I would mention that I double the recipe and put it in the next size up pyrex pan from the 9 x 13" pan. I have always had to cook them longer, but they have always turned out and everyone loves them. They are great with Godiva's white chocolate and raspberry ice cream. I was told I should try to sell them to Starbucks!

I love these. I have been making these since the recipe first appeared and they always come out well. For the people struggling with the larger pan...I sometimes use an 11x7 inch 'brownie' pan instead of the 9x9 (I just guessed that 77 square inches was pretty close to 81 square inches). They come out well in this pan, with about the same depth as in the 9x9.

Rating: 3
Unlike many previous reviewers, I always make these blondies in the 9x9x2 inch pan specified and although they do take a little longer to cook than stated, I still find it works better than spreading the batter more thinly in a 9x13 pan. To the reviewer on 4/18...creaming the butter and sugar together for too long wasn't the problem. Blondies and brownies become dry and cake-like if you beat for too long after the flour is added (this toughens the gluten in the flour)if your oven is running too hot, if you cook for too long or if you use the wrong size pan! Nobody likes uncooked batter but blondies are much better slightly moist. This recipe is a winner. The combination of tart raspberries and the sweet butterscotch blondie mix is delicious.

How delicious! They were the hit of the "Bistro" fundraiser at my children's school. I will make them again and have shared the recipe with others. I doubled the batch and used a jellyroll pan to bake them which allowed edges and center to cook more evenly.

I made this for a dinner party based on all the great reviews... I wasn't impressed with the result. They tasted good, but the texture was odd. I used a 9x13 pan based on other reviews ( did push the raspberries into the batter a bit), checked at 25 minutes and they didn't seem done - baked for another 12 or so. They were somewhat dry and very cake-like. I don't bake much, so I'm not sure what went wrong. I may have creamed the butter and sugar for too long (it was rather fluffy) - could that cause it to rise more? I'm very curious, if anyone knows the science on that. I do really like blondies, so I may try this again.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but it is identical (except for the raspberries, of course) to the Blondies with Chocolate Chips and Pecans, also on the Epicurious website. That recipe calls for a 9 x 13 pan, so it seems natural that this one should too. After 25 minutes it was beautifully golden.

If I could have given these five forks, I would have. Hands down the BEST brownie I've ever made, eaten, etc. Definitely use the 13x9x2 pan. THE ONLY ADVICE I HAVE IS MAKE THESE RIGHT AWAY. YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!

Rating: 2
These were good. The edges were overdone before the middle was done...they cooked an extra 15 min. I just cut the edges off and served the middle. They were well received. I probably wouldn't make them again since I like to try lots of stuff and only repeat the exceptional ones.

i have made this twice now and i had the same problem with cooking time i will use a larger pan next time but with out a doubt they are the best squares i have ever eaten i wonder how they would be with chockolate chips instead of the berrys i don't always have them on hand

Rating: 0
Taking them for a potluck dessert tomorrow, so cannot speak to the taste. They took at least 15 extra minutes to bake, though, and I am still not sure they are done through in the center. I think the 9x13 pan is a good idea for next time. They are cetainly thicker than what I had expected.

Rating: 3
Ummmmm....Yummy, however I had the same issues as many of the rest. The outside was a little overcooked and the inside not cooked enough. Next time I will use a 9 x 13 and push the raspberries down a little bit so it looks more like the picure. The cooked part was well recieved however. Will try this one again.

I have made this recipe many times and never am I disappointed! I've used it as a birthday cake with some confectioner's sugar sprinkled on top in a snazzy design. The brown sugar caramelizes on top of the brownies, giving them that sinful caramel taste. Mmmm!

This is a winner! Indulgent and a great alternative to chocolate brownies. However, it does need to cook at least 15 mins longer. I added chocolate chunks which was a big hit.

A new family favorite. I get requests for this all the time!!

The first time I made this recipe, I used the only pan I could find--it was quite a bit longer than the one the recipe calls for. It made all the difference--the cooking time works, and the blondies turn out fully cooked and wonderful. I've gotten many requests to make them again. When I tried the recipe with the actual called-for pan size, I had to cook them a ridiculous amount of time and they didn't turn out as well. Definitely use a larger pan.

Rating: 4
I thought these were fabulous. I did have to cook them a bit longer as well. I just waited until the center was browned-cooled them-cut them and then put in the refrigerator. Since the middle was still a bit undercooked, the refrigerator was a great help in maintaining a good consistency in the blondie. They were so chewy and moist and absolutely delicious! Try these. They are great!

this is a big hit in our family--i leave out the nuts and add more raspberries. they're so easy, but so darn good!

This takes WAY longer to bake than the recipe says. I cut the recipe in half & thought I could cut the bake time in half. It was taking forever & I wanted to go to bed, so I finally turned the oven off & let them bake. In the morning they were a little hard around the edges, but so chewy & tasty! I added chocolate chips & used walnuts (that's all I had).

We could not stop eating these at our house--they were so good! I did sub toasted almonds (instead of pecans) because I prefer almonds. And they took longer to cook than indicated (though I am not really sure if my pan was 9x9,which could be the reason for that). I can't wait to go pick more raspberries and make these again.

These sounded so great but we're so disappointing. After 50 min. they were still raw in the center. Baked them another 25 minutes, by then the perimeter was crusty and the center was still not done. What I could salvage was okay, but would not make again...there is better out there.

Rating: 3
Don't even think about leaving the almonds out-they add so much. Next time I will 'push' the berries into the batter-mine did not sink at all, but rested on top. I had to bake a little longer then the recipe stated.

Wonderful blonde brownie! I bought a 9x9 pan the third time I made them even though 8x8 works. Toasting the pecans before adding to the batter improves them.
