I've lived in Cincinnati my whole life, and I just have to say.... No one EVER puts gouda on their Cinci chili! Stick with the cheddar, and lots of it, or even a jack cheddar if your taste buds are on the spicier side.

FYI, I made it again with lamb and more "per recipe" and it's a solid 4 forks...

This chili (be it not real 'Cincinnati' material) is absolutely delicious! Perfect indulgence for a chilly autumn evening. Loved the depth of flavor and how easy it is to make with store cupboard ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it! Clearly not the healthiest, of course, so I'll have to do my best not to add this to the regular rotation...

This recipe may be tasty but it has nothing to do with Cincinnati chili. I'm going to find my authentic recipe and post it. The major difference is that Cincinnati style chili is not browned. It is crumbled into water before any heat is applied.

I really liked this recipe and am a big fan of all things lamb, so I enjoyed a different way of preparing lamb. I normally do not like beans in my chili, but using the kidney beans from the can instead of cooking them in the chili makes a huge difference and I really liked the beans in this dish. I made the recipe exactly as written only cutting the recipe to 2/3 (using 2 lbs of ground lamb and 2/3 of each ingredient). This made 8 cups of chili. Will definitely make again.

This is really a 31/2 fork recipe. I used beef for lamb, chicken broth plus 1 beef boullion for the beef broth. Up the garlic and cayenne. Added a tsp of madras curry and a squirt of ketchup. I added the beans to the chili 30 minutes after started to simmer. Served with chopped red and green onion, cheddar, crema, and some oyster crackers. Delicious, cheap, and satisfying.

Thia was awful. I am so glad that I dec ided to halve the recipe. Yuck! Not up to Bon Appetit standards!

Made this recipe because of all the good reviews and was not disappointed. It was an interesting twist to mix the beans with the pasta rather than mix them in the chili, and it worked well. I substituted organic ground beef for lamb, but otherwise made it as written and I couldn't stop eating it. Based on that fact alone, I have to give it three forks and if there was a three and half forks rating, it would get that. It is a nice alternative chili to have around.

Really good especially if you're a lamb fan. Made it exactly as printed except I used lamb broth I had made - excellent. One slight change and only because I couldn't get the cheese it called for so I used feta and I wouldn't hesitate to use that again. And I'm pleased to hear it get's better with age. Will definitely make again.

My family loves this chili including my three year old. I doubled the cocoa to warm up the flavor a bit for our taste. And next time, we're going with beef, because the lamb tasted a tad too overpowering for us. I also lessened the spice a bit since we have young kids who are sensitive to that. But other than that, it was a total hit! I love the taste and that it goes with pasta. It's such a comforting food and satisfying, richly flavorful and a delightful twist! And in solidarity with the angry Cincinnati people, I will NOT call it Cincinnati Chili. We'll go with some of the great names suggested by other reviewers. :)

Without getting into the authenticity debate, this is a good "alternative" chili. I followed the recipe exactly as printed. I made the mistake of eating it the night I made it and I was thinking I would not ever make it again. It was just alright and I have better chili recipes. However, I just ate the leftovers two days later and it is WORLDS better. Now I will file this one away for another winter day. By the way, I served it over macaroni instead of spaghetti to make it an easier meal to eat in front of the TV (hello Super Bowl Sunday!).

I'm from Cincinnati and I don't care that this isn't 'authentic.' It's awesome. It's better than Skyline and Gold Star. Granted, it costs 10 times more money to make this, but it's worth it. The new name should be Fancy Cincinnati-Style Chili.

I hope Bon Appetit has learned a valuable lesson here....you don't mess with folks' regional recipes....even if you think you have a better version. You better call them something different if its not gen-u-ine ....because someone is going to be upset. Honestly, the smart people of Cincinnati should grab this one up and claim it as well before someone else does because it is absolutely terrific. Cincinnati Lamb Noodle Bowl...whatever. They are just as likely to be mad if someone else claims it and they let a winner get away. My recommendation is that you try Cincinnati Lamb Noodle Bowl because it is a terrific kissing cousin of Cincinnati Chili.

I can't rate the recipe based on experience; I haven't made it. But whether or not it is tasty, it is NOT authentic Cincinnati chili! As other reviewers have pointed out, Cincinnati chili is made with beef (not lamb) that is not browned first, and topped with shredded cheddar (not goat's milk cheese), chopped raw onion, kidney beans and oyster crackers (not parsley). Since the other regions seemed to be faithfully represented, to be fair, the author should have given the authentic recipe in the article and listed her own preferences as alternate suggestions. Call this concotion whatever you like; just don't call it Cincinnati chili!

Fabulous "Non-Cincinati" Chili. Obviously this recipe has upset the Cincinnati Chili purists....but it is OUTSTANDING. Using the lamb is genius....the flavor is complex and rich, and has obvious Greek roots with the spices. The final dish is a little unconventional (being neither true Cincinnati Chili nor a typical Greek item)...but do not make the mistake of overlooking it. It is just terrific. I was worried about it coming across too sweet/sour with the addition of the brown sugar and the vinegar, but the end result is a perfect balance. Loved loved loved it.

All five of us gobbed this up. It is not your typical Tex/Mex chili; the spices are sweet and aromatic with a nice cayenne kick. One kid has a food allergy so we served the beans on the side. Don't forget them as they add a nice texture in contrast to the spaghetti. I used cheddar - it almost doesn't matter as long as you use the sharpest cheese you can find and pile it on! I also chose to drain most of the fat after the lamb cooked as it was easier than skimming the fat off the top. The leftovers are sure to be even better today!

Lamb? Brown the meat? Goat cheese? Parsley garnish? I don't know what this is but it isn't Cincinnati chili. And serving it with a salad w/ ranch dressing? Seriously? What about the oyster crackers?
