if you dont add salt, garlic, vinegar.. something, this is just plain old spinach. which is good too.

How could something so simple be so awesome! Really, the hardest thing about this recipe is washing the spinach. Per suggestions, I added minced garlic and a dash of apple cider vinegar- really delicious!

Only reason I give this 4 forks is b/c of the modifications ... without the additions this is B-L-A-N-D. Sauteed few cloves of garlic and took the advice of another reviewer to use Vinegar. Unfortunately all i had was sherry vinegar but it worked just fine. added a DASH at the end which made a WORLD of difference. Squeezed on some fresh lemon juice at the end. YUMMY. Going back to make some more... Really think the Vinegar was the trick here....

I followed too much reviewer advice when I cooked this--next time, I'll skip the red onion, but still fry garlic slices right before adding the spinach and finish with lemon juice. That will send it over the top.

I also add garlic to the oil, then toasted pine nuts at the end.

I never like cooked spinach until I tried this recipe! I added some chopped peanuts once and some sunflower seeds another time (since the nuts were salted, I didn't add additional salt, but did add a bit of pepper; and WOW! I could eat this almost every night. Can't wait to talk my husband into this one (especially since his idea of cooked spinach is canned with a bunch of vinegar in it).

The best tasting way I've ever prepared spinach. Sharper flavor and not watery. My new and only method of preparation!

Another variation is to add apple cidar vinegar (2T)with 1-2T of butter and nutmeg. Really tasty.

Four forks for the modified version with red onion and parmesan.

You can make this a really special side dish with a couple of extra ingredients. Use the garlic previously mentioned. I also sauté chopped red onions before adding the spinach. In the last minute of cooking, add a little balsamic vinegar and finish with fresh ground pepper and a little parmesan.

We believe this is the only way to cook spinach, and we suggest as an option adding a couple of cloves of thinly sliced garlic to the oil 10 or 20 seconds before the spinach; and as an additional option a bit of lemon juice at the finish. But it is also really good just as is.
