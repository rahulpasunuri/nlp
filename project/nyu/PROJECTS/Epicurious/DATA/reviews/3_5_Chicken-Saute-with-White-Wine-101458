This was a great start. It was pretty basic instructions, I threw in some onions and garlic with the butter as well as some rosemary when i added the wine. it was great!

I really didn't like this at all. And I even jazzed up with some garlic & lemon zest. It was just bland and the chicken was rubbery. I won't be making this again.

This is a great basic recipe that even amateur cooks can dress up to their own tastes (myself included). I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and added garlic. Then I cut the chicken into pieces and served with a store-bought pesto and pasta -- YUM! It was GREAT.

Wonderful recipe! I browned the 1lb of boneless breast of chicken with 1 tsp of butter added to the olive oil. Then I added 4 garlic cloves, scallions, a little bit of fresh basil and some chicken broth. Cooked till chicken was done and deglazed the pan with a little more white wine threw in a handful of chopped tomatoes and cooked done the sauce. It came out great!

This recipe is so basic that you cannot go wrong. I have made it numerous times and each time I use a differnt spice. Try adding 2 tbls chopped fresh rosemary just before adding the wine. I serve this over rice with fresh steamed tri-colored string beans.

Great results! Took suggestion of other reviewer and sauteed onions in 1T of butter. Then added two split chicken breasts (with the skin and bone still in) and browned for 4 minutes on each side. For cooking liquid I used 3/4 cup of chardonnay and 1/4 cup of good chicken broth and added some dried thyme. Covered the saute pan and cooked for 45 minutes over low heat. Braising it like this keeps the chicken tasty and moist. Make sure to take the chicken out at the end and deglaze the pan with some more wine and then let the sauce heat up and thicken. Served this over pasta.

Fantastic! My husband said it was the best chicken he ever had. I used an organic free range chicken and added about two minced shallots to the wine. I will make this again and again. Perfect with mashed potatoes.

i used this recipe as a reference. i put some olive oil in a pan with half an onion, cut in slices lengthwise, added a little salt and pepper to them. after about two minutes i added the two chicken breasts, browned them on both sides and poured some really good chardonnay over them. i covered it and let it cook down until there was a nice sauce in the pan. i didn't have any fresh garlic on hand but i think it would have tasted great in it. i placed the chicken and sauteed onions over basmati rice, added some more chardonnay to the pan and let it cook down, then poured it over the rice and chicken. served with a salad and a glass of chardonnay. this meal was awesome, tasted amazing, was satisfying. i would make this a few times a month, probably.

Easy and delicious. I used leg quarters, substituted Sauvingon Blanc and added about 4 cloves of garlic, minced and some dried thyme. It took a long time to cook, about 40 minutes over medium heat. The crust, with the garlic, was very tasty. Also nice to have meal with simple incredients that are always on hand. Served with brussel sprouts and herbed rice.
