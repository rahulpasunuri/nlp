Great Vietnamese sauce!! I have been addicted to it since the first time I did it!! Great to be combined with: Lemongrass Pork with Vietnamese Table Salad & Warm Jasmine Rice Salad with Shrimp and Thai Herbs... ALL from Epicurious.com!!

I agree - it was a little watered down. I just made it next time with much less water and it came out very well. Also worked well with Splenda (sounds odd, but I could not tell the difference).

I made this sauce according to the recipe and it tasted 'watered down'. The amount of fish sauce wasn't enough saltiness for me. The taste of the chilies, although they seemed hot while mincing, got lost in the sauce. The next time I make this, I'll omit the water entirely and use more chilies, especially if I plan to use the sauce as a dressing for the Grilled Lemongrass Beef and Noodle Salad.

This is a good basic sauce, but somewhat mild for my own taste. I would suggest combining all of the ingredients, including just a small amount of water in which the sugar has been dissolved, and then adding warm water to taste. As in another review, a little grated carrot is nice. Unless you have a really sweet tooth, a little less sugar may be wanted.

This is the perfect dipping sauce for spring rolls, deep fried of fresh with rice papers. I like to add some finely grated carrot to mine for colour & taste. This recipe makes a lot of sauce.
