Haven't made this in years but I do recall it was fantastic. Can someone refresh my memory?...do you soak the dried fruit in the brandy? Updated review coming to you soon...

I have been making this cake since I first found the recipe. My husband and I love it-we get one and my parents get one. I do not put in the marzipan or dates-however depending on what dried fruit is available I will use dried pears/peaches/apples and cranberries along with raisins. The cake is great-dense and flavorful-this year I ran out of brandy so topped it off with armagnac.

This is a favorite. I bake 8 of the mini paper loaf forms, so there's plenty to give as gifts. I use dried cranberries in place of dates and prefer toasted, chopped pecans to the pine nuts, and cut the marzipan into 1/4-inch dice. I agree that this is like a poundcake packed with dried fruit and nuts, vs. a traditional fruitcake, ut that's what many like about it. I don't find it dry, and it keeps well for several weeks in the refrigerator, and longer in the freezer.

Liked it but didn't love it. We found it a bit on the dry side with a slightly crumbly texture. I guess we were looking for a denser, more traditional fruitcake.

Hi Note that I haven't made this recipe, I'm just putting in a plug for a different one. More than 20 years ago Gourmet published a recipe for Fruitcake Haters' Fruitcake which I think is still the best ever:Cream together 4 sticks (2c) butter, with 2 1/4 c brown sugar, and 1 c honey. Add 10 eggs one at a time, beating well. In another bowl sift together 4 c sifted flour, 2 t each of cinnamon and baking powder, 1 t allspice, 3/4 t salt. Stir half of dry mix into the sugar mix. In remaining dry mix dredge 7 1/2 cups assorted dried fruit bits and nuts (apricots, dates, pecans, golden raisins, etc). Combine 1 c apricot nectar, 1/2 c light cream,& 2 T lemon juice, add to batter, fold in the fruits. Divide batter among 4 buttered and floured 9.5 by 5 inch loaf pans and bake in preheated 250 degree F (yes,250) oven for 2.5-3 hours, until tester comes out clean. Let cool in pans on a rack. In a bowl combine 1 c brandy and 1/4 c orange liqueur and sprinkle each cake with 1/4 the mixture. Let cakes stand one hour. Remove from pans, wrap tightly in foil, chill at least one week. Excellent!

Good flavor but I thought this was dry. Warming it up and slathering it in butter helps.

This is the best fruitcake!! I make a double recipe and 7 new devoted fruitcake converts every holiday season - I need to keep one for myselft.

I was tempted by the cardamom in this recipe -- it's one of my favourite spices, and did add a nice taste to the dense cake packed with a delicious mixture of dried fruits. The number of eggs in the recipe should have given me a clue, but I was expecting much more of a traditional fruitcake... I agree with the cook who suggested calling this a dried fruit poundcake -- I think that's a much more accurate description.

Remarkably easy recipe that my guests swore came from a professional bakery. I told them it was dried fruit poundcake (rather than calling it fruitcake) and it flew off the plate. I also gave several away as gifts along with other goodies and the fruitcake and rainbow cookies from this site were clearly the crowd favorites. One hint, be sure to chop the marzipan up into small pieces. They don't melt and remain the size you chop them up into. This recipe was simple and extremely well received. A new holiday staple.

Absolutely the best fruitcake I've made or tasted. It should have a name other than fruitcake so everyone to whom you offer some will try it. But then again, all the more for you!

This is a delicious fruitcake. I substituted macadamias for the pine nuts. I couldn't find dried pears, but the final product was very tasty.

This was great! I tried the dried cranberries instead of the figs. I used pecans because they are my favorite. I loved the cardamon flavor.

I don't usually like fruitcake, but this is fantastic. Very light and moist, with wonderful flavours. I will definitely make it again, and not just at Christmas.
