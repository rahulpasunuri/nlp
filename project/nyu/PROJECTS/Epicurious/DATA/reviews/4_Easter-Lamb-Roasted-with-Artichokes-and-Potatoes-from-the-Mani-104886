Delicious! We did not add garlic as some reviewers did- it really doesn't need it! The potatoes in particular were fabulous!

We have this every Christmas and it is by far the best leg of lamb our family has ever eaten. Very easy to prepare. For the best results use the highest quality olive oil that is available to you.

This is my "go to" Easter main dish. I do the whole cleaning the artichokes thing - the whole base is so much more flavorful than just the hearts. (I save the discarded leaves, scrape them and freeze the puree to make soup (and maybe a souffle) later. The lamb is flavorful and I love the roasted potatoes with the artichokes! As another reviewed noted, even non-lamb folks love this!

I did not add any additional garlic and cooked the lamb for a full 1 hour 20 minutes. Several guests who do not typically like lamb RAVED about this dish. It is now my standard lamb recipe. It is incredibly succulent and tender.

Made this last night for a family dinner to rave reviews. I brined the lamb in a sugar, salt, garlic solution for two hours before roasting. I did add two cloves of crushed garlic to to the roast, and thinly sliced tomatoes were placed under it to flavor the pan sauce a bit. I also trimmed the roast really well and removed all the fell and most of the fat before roasting.

3 words... Garlic, garlic, garlic. Can't make lamb without it (wouldn't the Greeks agree?). I made slits all over the roast for slivered garlic cloves, and added minced garlic to the olive/rosemary rub. The lemon was a fantastic addition; and the artichoke/potatoes were fabulous. I will definitely make this again (did I mention GARLIC?!)

Fabulous main course! Absolutley the best lamb I have ever eaten, and so easy to prepare. Be sure to use a high quality olive oil.

I find it hard to believe that this recipe was tested before being published. The timing is way off. Neither the potatoes nor the artichokes were even close to being done by the time the lamb was ready. I definitely won't make this again.

This was EXCELLENT!!!!!! I used a boneless leg of lamb, and actually omitted the artichokes the first time (out of season) - still great! The next time I used frozen, thawed artichoke hearts. Think that despite the adamant absence of garlic, a little won't hurt. This is a "keeper" !
