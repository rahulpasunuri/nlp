I modified, used shrimp only, and made with low carb linguine. Have made it four times to rave reviews. Also added some Spanish chorizo which made the dish. Didn't use lobster but used clam juice which I added to the sauce.

This really didn't work for me. It turned out kind of mushy and starchy. I frequently make paella, and thought this would be a good variation. For me, it didn't even come out like Fideua. Quite a disappointment, as I was making it for guests.

This recipe was great! We added sea salt to taste, and doubled the garlic. We used fusilli pasta, because it was prettier. We used imitation lobster, but will definitely use a live lobster next time when we make it for company!

Good Fideuá. If you can find fideos, it's easier than chopping up the spaghetti. You should get the saffron wrapped in tinfoil and then into the oven to get it really dry before using it, makes the flavour much better. The fideos also improve if you stirfry them for a bit longer than it says in the recipe.

This is similar to a dish I have at a local Spanish Tapas restaurant and they call it Fideos con mariscos - its a little brothy which is great. I didn't have lobster but some leftover crab which was actually quite nice added at the end. I used very thin pasta but you can buy fideos at some specialty stores. I pretty much made this as is though and the results were fantastic. Great flavors. a big hit.

This is not a paella, it is similar to the Valencian dish called Fideua.
