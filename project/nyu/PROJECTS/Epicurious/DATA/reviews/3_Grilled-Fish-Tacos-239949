I've been making fish tacos for a while now. I usually pan fry the fish after lightly coated with flour. As to the "sauce", I use 2/3 of crema, and a couple tbs of mayo, and make 2 versions: one with cilantro, another with chipotle.

Like other reviewers, I cut down the amount of sauce, using sour cream and dry cilantro. Seared tuna steaks on the stove instead of grilling. Used whole-wheat tortillas, warmed in the oven. The sweet pink onions were absolutely wonderful, and all the flavors blended beautifully. Great recipe.

Rob, you really need to try fish tacos. They're fabulous! I love the idea of adding chipotle in adobo to the sauce to give it a kick. I would cut WAY down on the quantity of mayo and sour cream, tho. Seems like an awfully lot. Other than that, this recipe looks quite good. I'm going to try it this weekend.

I haven't tried fish tacos yet, ever. But I was reading the review and was wondering, what about Chipotle Sauce as an ingredient to add to the mayo to kick it up a notch? Smokey & Spicy are always a hit. I know whenever I add it to recipes people comment more about the dish than when I don't. Just a thought. Actually, the whole "fish" as a taco thing throws me every time I say it. That's not to say I won't try it. I just haven't yet.

This was good, but needs tweaking. I used cod, and found the fish excellent. The onions were amazing. The rest is a bit boring. Way too much mayo stuff, which needs kick and taste. I'm not sure how to make it better, but I really think the secret is in the cabbage and the mayo dressing -- they need spice and zing. ???

Ooh, also: mahi mahi is not endangered. On the list of recommended fish (forget name of organization, but they rank fish with regards to environmental concerns, mercury, PcBs, etc), mahi mahi is near the top. The fish reach adulthood very quickly and they have a short life-span, so the population replenishes itself relatively well.

Easy recipe, especially if you prepare all the ingredients ahead of time. Like others, I agree that the fish could use a little kick. Maybe next time I'll throw in some more red pepper flakes. And some other stuff? I saw another fish taco recipe--will try to incorporate some of the spices.

Good recipe. I agree with a previous poster that the recipe makes too much sour cream-mayo sauce and you can reduce the amounts. I used Pollock but found that it was somewhat dry after I broiled it. So, I would use a somewhat fattier fish, like the ones in the recipe. Good tastes.

I have made this several times with just a few changes: I always add double the lime juice as the zing really adds depth to the fish. I use cod instead of mahi mahi or tuna and it's quite good. I also always halve the crema recipe because it makes too much for my taste. Lastly I don't use cabbage but will shred romaine. Make sure you use plenty of condiments (like cilantro and the avocados) otherwise it can taste a little bland. It's a great summer time fish taco recipe overall.

a good, solid, clean and fresh tasting fish taco. i've made this several times and think it's best when using tuna. yum!

Meh... The recipe was good, just not outstanding. I found the fish marinade to be way too tart. I adjusted by adding a couple teaspoons of sugar. Also had 3/4 tsp of cumin and some minced garlic. The best part of the recipe was the onions. I also sliced some jalapenos in with the onions, and those really added quite a bit to the tacos. I would make again, but will continue to play with the marinade.

I made this many many times. The pickled onions might be the best part - they add a wonderful flavor to the tacos. And by- the-way, mahi mahi is NOT endangered....

When did Mahi Mahi, aka, Dolphin, become endangered? It's one of our most common fish in South FL, and I think another SF reviewer just said that as well.

I really didn't like the combination of tastes in this recipe. There was nothing pulling together the fish, the radishes, the onions. The avocado was lost. The sauce tasted too much like mayonnaise. Perhaps using less mayo, more lime juice, some cilantro, and maybe even some ginger in the sauce would make this dish more cohesive. I cannot comment on the authenticity of this dish, but I can only say it did not work for my husband or for me.

The fish called dolphin (not Flipper), dorada or mahi-mahi is extremely common in Florida's waters, at least, and is not in the least endangered, unlike swordfish which it often replaces. And BTW -- this is an excelletn recipe. I use 6" tacos and just put less in each one.

"A near miss"? Ah, that arrogant New Yorker demeanor: epicenter of style and taste, yada yada yada. The recipe is authentic and perfect.Been there, know that!

Beware! Mahi mahi is an endangered species. C'mon Epicurious. Let's bring some consciousness to the kitchen!

msr12, Thank you for your thoughtful and gracious update!

I've made this recipe twice - once with mahi mahi and once with tuna. Both were yummy and easy. My favorite part were the pickled onions. The second time, I mixed some of the vinegar mixture with the the cabbage and radishes too and the pickled veggies with the white sauce were a great contrast. The 6-inch tortillas were fine.

msr12, Okay, I'll use bigger tortillas or less condiments! How did it taste?

An interesting combination of ingredients, which almost works...except that a 6-inch tortilla is too small to hold the ingredients, making it very hard to actually taste the various elements together. It almost seems as though the recipe wasn't actually tested. In the end, I'd have to say the recipe doesn't work...but it's a near miss.
