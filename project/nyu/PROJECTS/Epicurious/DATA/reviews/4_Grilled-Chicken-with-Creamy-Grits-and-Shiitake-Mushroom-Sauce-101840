Delicious! I'm not going to rate it because I made major modifications due to dietary restrictions, but the actual recipe is probably even better (though I'd give my version 4 forks anyway). We used turkey bacon instead of pancetta and unsweetened almond milk instead of cream. One suggestion though is to lightly saute the sage in olive oil before adding to sauce.

The sauce for this dish is good, although not as good as the sauce in the Pan-Seared Tuna with Ginger-Shiitake Cream Sauce (yum!) which easily could be used for this recipe, with the very welcome addition of the pancetta. As for the chicken, I don't know if it's just my grill running too hot, but I ended up with a four-alarm blaze after putting my birds well-marinated in olive oil onto the BBQ. In retrospect, I kind of think that was predictable. Maybe next time I would do indirect medium high on the grill for 15 minutes or so to let the birds chill out before putting directly on the burners.

Unbelievable. Amazing. Incredible 5 STAR recipe. You cannot go wrong with this. Put over regular mashed potatoes and have some wine and green veggie on the side and you will eat every dreamy mouthful!!!

I was looking for a shitake mushroom sauce to serve over pasta and found this easy enough for a week night and delicious as written. (I suspect that the fresh sage is critical, though.)

Forgot to add that I used the full amount of pancetta and it was great; not too salty for us! It's kinda hard to make into "matchstick" pieces, so i just sliced it up the best I could and threw it in. yummy!

The sauce for this dish is terrific; tastes like it took much longer to make. I substituted half and half for the cream, and added some corn starch to get it thicker. Poured the sauce on brown rice rather than grits. White rice might even taste better, but I was being healthy!

Rating: 4
Wonderful dish! The next time we make it, we'll be serving it with garlic mashed potatoes, which we think will actually go better with the dish than grits. Another reviewer mentioned using regular mushrooms which I think is a good call. Lastly, we realized that we used too much pancetta than the recipe called for, so that's a watchout for us next time since it imparts much saltiness.

This is a regular at our house. We never have anything leftover.It is so easy to make that I made it for our church one night and fed 85 people. I always use boneless chicken breasts. It is so much easier to eat with the creamy grits and not have to deal with the bones.

Really great! I doubled the sauce,thanks for the tip. Next time I make cream of portobella / mushroom soup. I am going to add white wine and the sage to it. Great flavor. Next time I do the grits for it, I am going to leave the broth out. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

The chicken and sauce recipe was incredible - elegant enough for a gourmet dinner party! I doubled the sauce to have extra and then only used about 3oz of dried shitakes in the sauce. I also thickened the sauce with a just a touch of cornstarch mixed with broth. Served it over brown and wild rice and everyone raved about it. I will serve this time and again!

I fried up the chicken and then added to the sauce which was fantastic!! Next time I make this I will double the sauce, it didn't seem like enough. I served with bread dumplings because I couldn't seem to find quick-cooking grits...or grits of any sort to my disappointment :(

I made this a few weeks ago for a sit down dinner and the chicken was wonderful. But instead of using a whole chicken I used boneless and skinless breast of chicken. Also, I did not do the grits but instead served white rice. This chicken dish is very tasty and perfect. No need to change anything other than me following the suggestions of other readers and buying low sodium broth.

I've been making this dish for years and hadn't had it for awhile. After making it again tonight, I couldn't figure out why! Of the nundreds of recipes I've enjoyed from Epicurious, this is my all-time favorite. In my opinion, the recipe is perfect as is. I half large bone-in, skin on chicken breast halves and let them marinate overnight. Homemade chicken stock adds depth. The sauce takes about 30 minutes to reduce. The pancetta retains its delicious crispiness when added immediately before serving. Best grits recipe hands down -- only one I'll use.

Rating: 4
This recipe rocked my world. After reading some reviews, I reduced the pancetta and sage, because I had some killer locally-grown shiitakes that I didn't want to overpower. It was AMAZING. My husband almost licked the pate clean. Yes, yes and yes.

This was very tasty, however a tip, if your using Minor's paste, watch the amount you use, mine came out SO salty, but that aside, it was just a fabulous meal!! Would make for company !!

This was amazing! I used chicken breasts instead of a fryer chicken and it was very quick to cook that way. I'd opt for regular mushrooms rather than the shiitake because the sauce is so flavorful it overpowers the subtle mushroom flavor. Exceptional dish, and fairly easy to make!

Rating: 4
AMAZING!! A very special dish! Great for company. I made it with brown rice instead of the grits, and found that I had to watch the reduction of the sauce. I was juggling things that night and mine came out a bit salty for my taste. Even so, it was very delicious and I definitely will make it again.

I cooked this recipe exactly except I added more pancetta to the sauce. I also cooked the chicken rotisserie-style. The chicken was very tender and a meal by itseslf. However, the sauce was to die for! I made the mistake of sampling the sauce while I was cooking...then I couldn't stop! I will definitely make this again.

This was extraordinary. I don't have much luck with grilled chicken so I marinated bone-in chicken breasts with skin as directed and roasted them at 475 for 25 minutes--crisp and juicy. Then served with the sauce and the grits. We have used the grits recipe for years--absolutely the BEST grits. The shitake cream sauce was new to us--the combination of sauce, chicken and grits was wonderful. We will have this often. The cream sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated. I warmed it in a double boiler over hot water and it did fine.

Rating: 3
The chicken was good, but just grilled chicken. Nothing too exciting. BUT the grits and mushroom sauce... WOW I could hardly plate it up. My husband kept sticking spoons in the pan to get more! I did thicken the sauce a smidge, and added some pecorino romano to the grits, just because I could. A family favorite that will be enjoyed for a long time.

Rating: 4
We really LOVED this! The sauce was really delicious. I used a different recipe for the Chicken. I would definitely make the sauce and the grits again. I had to had about a 1/3 more chicken stock and cream to the grits to keep them creamy.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious! I used bone-in whole chicken legs for this, and brined them for about four hours before grilling, and they were perfect. The grits were so delicious, and the sauce decadent. I sauteed some shallots and garlic with the mushrooms and it really added something extra. The sage is a great addition to the sauce. I'll definitely make this again!

Really outstanding. I substituted low-fat evaporated milk for the whipping cream, but otherwise made this exactly like the recipe. YUM! Only change I would make next time is allowing more time for the sauce to reduce.

I made this last night and it was fabulous. I could not find pancetta so I used prosciutto instead. Also, I would recommend doubling the grits recipe if you are a fan of grits. There was plenty for us but not very much left over to go with the 4 pieces of chicken we had for leftovers. The sauce was out of this world! I think it would made a delicious winter-toime soup! Try this recipe tonight!

I made this dish for Mother's Day for my family. They all absolutely loved it! I served the chicken and sauce w/ roasted garlic mashed potatoes and sauted veggies. I sauted broccoli, carrots and asparagus in olive oil, butter, garlic, a little bit of sliced fresh sage, (to go w/ the recipe),and salt and pepper to taste. To drink, we opened a bottle of a local Zinfindel. YUMMY!

Rating: 4
The family unanimously gave this recipe 4 forks. The sauce was FABULOUS, even on the broccoli it was served with. Don't have the BBQ set up for this year yet, so I roasted the chicken, used bacon and shiitakes in the sauce and it was great. Only drawback was the saltiness of the sauce, but that can be taken care of with low sodium broth. Definitely one of the best tasting recipes I've used from Bon Appetit. How can you go wrong with beef broth, mushrooms and cream?

Rating: 4
This was fabulous, and without the grits, it's Atkins-approved! I didn't have Pancetta or Crimini mushrooms on hand, so i used bacon and Portobella and it was great. Don't salt anything during cooking -- the bacon does it. (I added a squeeze of lemon to the sauce at the end which helped, and next time would use more olive oil or butter than bacon fat to cook the mushrooms.) Also, I found the cream sauce took 10-15 minutes to thicken. Steamed green beans w/lemon juice is a nice light compliment.

This was one of the best dishes that I have made in a long time. I didn't have grits available, so I used cous-cous. It worked very well. I also wouldn't use creamy grits, as regular grits would be just fine.

Rating: 4
having requested this recipe from Bon Appetit after sampling it at the restaurant where it is served, i can say: it's exactly like the original. ('cept they use quail) and they batter fry some sage leaves as garnish. it is a rich dish but the sauce IS thin at the restaurant, not a thick gravy. if you have leftovers, you must heat the grits very slowly, if you microwave them they'll separate. i prepared it with cornish hens, which was tasty. i think it would work with pheasant as well.

Rating: 4
I used chicken thighs and, as it looked like rain as I went to start the fire, broiled them. Turned out great. Definitely not a low cal dish. Served with spinach. Great colors. Funny how grits are uncouth, but polenta (yellow grits) are gourmet. The sauce would be excellent over game hens.

Rating: 4
I made this for the first time last night, and it was a huge success. We ate until we were about to bust! Even the gourmet in the family thought the grits were delicious (I'm a big grits fan, myself). The sauce definitely makes the dish, but the chicken (I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts instead) was delicious on it's own. I followed the recipe closely this time and the only change I noticed was that it took much longer to reduce the sauce to thicken it. I was patient...and it paid off. I didn't have to add a thickener. I served this with the roasted brussel sprouts with pancetta (recipe found on this site). Absolutely delicious!!!

Rating: 3
I normally would never take a fellow reviewer to task, but the writer from Stanford needs to get off the high horse and learn some respect for regional culinary traditions. "Uncouth grits," indeed. No doubt this same writer *swoons* over "polenta". Wake up, Baby, those are simply Italian grits. Sorry for the rant, fellow cooks, but as one who has enjoyed this simple food in a variety of gourmet settings ("Maverick Grits" is an excellent recipe on this very site), I take offense at such provincialism. Oh, about the recipe- quite nice, although I personally don't feel the need to use cream with grits- I find it makes them a bit too rich.

Rating: 3
The chicken worked just as well with only an hour marination time. A BBQ was not avalible, but frying in olive oil produced good results. We also substituded a beef paste for beef broth. This, however, was not a good addition, especially when we learned each tablespoon of beef broth contained 35 percent of one's daily sodium intake. The sauce was inedible due to this oversight despite the sauce's 20 dollar price tag. On a positive note, kosher sweet potato pancakes make a great addition to this dish if one does not want to bother with the uncouth grits. Even when they are burned, they are not too bad. Asparagus is a nice complement, because whoever wrote this recipie obviously forgot to add a vegetable.

I made this dish about three weeks ago and found it to be delightful! My partner and I will be starting the Atkins diet tomorrow and I am purging the fridge in honor of the occasion.

People are right- the sauce and grits were so delicious! I made for my gourmet-cook in-laws and they loved it. I used proscuitto instead of pancetta and used a little less creamy. I also made the butter mixture with rosemary and garlic to put under the skin and added leftover flavored butter to grits! The sauce would be great on sauteed chicken as well!

Absolutely delicious. You must make it with the grits otherwise the results will not be the same. I strongly suggest cooking down the sauce alot longer than 5 minutes as suggested - I would say more like 20-30 minutes to give it a more creamy texture, also I would reduce the suggested white wine from 1/2 to 1/4 as the wine gives the sauce a saltier taste. This dish is truly wonderful!

This grilled chicken marinade was delicious. The sauce is very rich, but make sure that you use whipping cream as opposed to half & half, as the sauce will separate. The grits are an excellent complement for the chicken. I used all chicken broth and subtsituted extra salt for the panchetta.

Awesome!!! I made a couple changes--roasted the quartered chicken in the oven for about an hour instead of grilling. Also, split the mushrooms between portabella and shitake since I had both. And we served it over linguine instead of grits. It was one of the best chicken dishes we've had!!

Rating: 3
Oh, yes! This is a keeper. I would give it a 4 ork rating except that, as mentioned by earlier reviewers, you do have to take steps to reduce the saltiness; the pancetta alone was enough to season the entire dish. I couldn't grill outside, so I broiled the chicken until golden on both sides and finished in the oven. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I used boneless chicken breast and stuffed it with a herbed farmers cheese. I also used a onion flavored beef broth and turkey bacon in the sauce, my guests just loved the combination. I have made this dish at least a half a dozen times already and counting.

Solid dish. Do everything you can to cut the salt. The" tang" presence was a bit overbearing with the pancetta. The sauce was a bit thin. I recommend a little bit of arrowroot or corn starch to give it some body. Do not salt the grits, use whole milk, omit the chicken broth (unless you have unsalted homemade stock). This recommendation balances the flavors and saves the dish from being too salty. This is an easy one, so experiment for yourself. Overall rating 3.3
