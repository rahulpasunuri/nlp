Such terrific Mediterranean flavors! I double the fish (for 4 servings) and nothing else, don't salt the sauce (but do salt the veg and fish when roasting) and go a bit heavy on the kalamatas. It's such a great dish and perfectly lovely for getting kudos for a "you made THIS on a weeknight?" OR for a dinner party (and we're fussy dinner-party throwers). We love this dish.

Nice new application of puttanesca; used 3/4# of cod, as halibut is over $25 per lb, and we don't get haddock much in the NW. Husband likes LOTS of sauce, and I don't need more leftovers sitting around,so used it all. Served with simple green salad and nice red wine.

This was a great, week-night dinner, which I would also make for casual entertaining. My husband felt it was too salty, but I used close to a cup of olives, which would have increased the saltiness. We paired with a pinot blanc, it worked well. More fish is not a bad idea, if you are used to bigger protein servings, but I liked that the fish could be cut up and served in smaller chunks, as I find we typically consume too much protein.

It was listed among the special Easter entrees, sounded wonderful, and I made it exactly as directed, but the results were disappointing. May as well have served fish & chips w/ketchup. Won't make it again.

Delicious! Definitely increase the fish, as others have noted. That's the only change needed!

Excellent recipe and easy to prepare. Increase the fish by 50%, the amount in the recipe is not enough for 4 people.

The flavors in this recipe are out of this world!! My sons and I love puttanesca anyway, and this sauce combined with the fish and oven roast vegetables tasted divine. Even my hubby, who doesn't usually like capers or olives, ate everything on his plate and declared it "very good" - high praise from him! I did use 1 lb of halibut, because 8 oz of any fish just wouldn't have been enough for 3 hungry men and me.

Wonderful. Oil cured olives and the reduced sauce that concentrated the flavors made all the difference. Great meal for under an hours worth of work.

I used half the amount of anchovies, 1/3rd more haddock and added oregano to the puttanesca sauce as it's typical of puttanesca. It was great and will certainly make it again.

Really good. But you really need more than 8 ounces of fish. You can barely find it in that quantity and if you're feeding 4....well, it's just potatoes with a delicious puttanesca.

Incredibly easy. Made the sauce over chicken with a few smoked mozzarella ravioli on the side.
