Since it was January, I "grilled" these indoors on a grill pan. Smoked up the house a little. They had good flavor but I think I'd just roast them in the oven next time.

As written, these were super bland. Really, no one at our Thanksgiving would have eaten them. But we changed a 1 fork recipe into a 4 fork recipe with some ingenuity when we realized that we had used up all of our sweet potatoes on this recipe!!! We combined maple syrup, white balsamic vinegar, rice vinegar, sriracha, and pick-a-peppa sauce and tossed the fries with that strange brew. Then, we reheated the whole mess when we got to my mom's house. It was a total hit. I am so glad we made this recipe because it took us down the road to invention and savory enjoyment!

These were awesome. Followed recipe exactly and fries turned out perfectly. Loved the bit of char on the fries from grilling which made them crispy. Served with steak and tomatoes... rave reviews!

Boring! and they were limp not crisp even with charring grill marks.

These got rave reviews from my husband, who is a huge fan of sweet potato fries when we go out. The 2nd time I made these, I made 2 changes which made them much better: 1. For "salting & peppering to taste", I used garlic salt. 2. I baked them in a single layer on a cookie sheet in the oven instead of on the grill (where I found it really hard not to burn them). I baked them at 375 for about 20 mins, then cranked it up to 425 to make them a little crisper, taking them out from time to time to turn them over.

I love the crispy charred spots on the outside with the creamy sweet potato flavor inside and spicy cayenne.

These fries are awesome! I baked them (as it was snowing outside), and they turned out very well. Would make them again with a turkey burger or grilled chicken.

I made this for a picnic and everyone was pleasantly surprised by the taste. I paired the fries with homemade bbq sauce for dipping and that seemed to be a hit! Instead of messing w/ an outdoor grill, I used my cast iron grill on the stove then transferred them to the oven for a few minutes.

It was difficult to flip the fries on the grill without having them fall through the grates, so those that survived were more than "slightly charred". However I like the idea of these fries and may try them in the oven where I can cook them more evenly.

Modified slightly - did thin disks vs. sticks so they wouldn't fall through the grates on our grill. Also, ran out of fresh rosemary so I put in slightly more than half the amount using dried rosemary. Very tasty.

Yummy...we often eat steak and I served this as a side along with fresh green beans. It was a hit! I baked them in the oven and added a bit more spice...delicious!

To save time and hassle, I cut the potatoes in rounds and put them in the oven for about 25 minutes at 375. They were soft on the inside, but carmelized outside. My husband doesn't like sweet potatoes in any form usually, but loved this. Super tasty!

Tried this recipe with my honey last night. We didn't like the rosemary with this at all. I was much too strong a spice for the sweet potatoes. Might try it with another milder spice next time. THe hotness of the cayenne pepper was very nice with it though.

Really delicious and so easy!

Anything this easy and tasty is a definite repeat dish for me. I baked mine, since I already had the oven on for another dish. Yum! The side of the fries that was touching the baking sheet got darkly caramelized, giving the fries a nice depth of flavor. In all honesty, they looked burnt when I first pulled them out of the oven, but tasting them quickly did away with that impression. The sugar-and-cayenne-pepper combo is a favorite of mine on other items... nice to know that it works so well on sweet potatoes!

This side dish lives up to its name. I have already made it a multiple times this summer. It also works well in the oven. It is a crowd pleaser and a great subsitute for normal fries or baked potatoes.
