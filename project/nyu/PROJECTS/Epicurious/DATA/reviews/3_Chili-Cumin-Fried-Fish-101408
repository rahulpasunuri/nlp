I enjoyed this more that many reviewers here seem to have, but I wonder if that might be because I didn't bread the fish at all (I'm gluten-intolerant) and so the spices stood out more.

I agree with those that say that the spice mixture is completely lost in the cooking. I used panko and essentially just ended up with plain fried fish. Tasty enough, but nothing special.

My 16 year old son loved this recipe! It was very tasty, easy to make, and fast. Squeezed lemon slices on the filets..great flavors!!

Seriously, one of the worst recipes I've ever encountered on Epicurious. The result is completely unappealing looking and toughened up my snapper like it was undercooked overaged monkfish. The spice effect was completely lost.

As suggested by others, I didn't do the salt treatment. I also added some cayenne to spice mix and would probably add more when I make this again. I also found that the fish cooked faster than the times given in the recipe. Finally, I also squeezed the juice of a whole lemon on each fillet of fish once it came out of the pan. All in all, a good (not great) recipe.

I made this dish with tilapia. It was good. I couldn't find plain matzo meal, so I used Manischewitz matzo ball mix, which already contains some mild seasoning, including salt. Because of this I didn't add any salt when I seasoned it (although I did do the salt rub in the beginning.) I used only chili powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper. Next time I might reverse that: not do the salt rub but add a dash of salt before frying.

Boring!

I really liked the cumin/chili powder combination (watch the salt) on the fish before breading. This turned out so much better than I thought it would and it tasted great with cilantro, lemon and olive oil for frying. Next time I would try it without the salting. I LOVE salt, I could salt pepperoni pizza and be happy, but this had way way too much salt. I really rinsed the fish too. I've never fried fish and I was shocked at how moist it was.

Really good. In the style of many Arab cooks, I poured fresh lemon juice over the fried fish and added a good layer of parsley. Excellent!!

It was okay. The directions were easy to follow and you got a good final result. There just wasn't much there taste-wise. Be imaginative and spruce it up. Good base recipe.

Very easy to make and tasty. I added cayenne pepper to liven things up a little. I'd never fried fish before -- even though I'm from the south. I'd definitely do it again. I like it with lots of lemon.

I skipped the step with the salt and didn't miss it. I also panfried the fish instead of deep frying to cut out the fat. The fish was very flavorful and will make again for Passover and also year round.

The crust and fish were great in texture but the fish was too salty for our liking. I would definately make it again but draw the excess moisture out of the fish with paper towel instead of salt.

This turned out far better than I expected. My husband enjoyed it very much.
