I love this soup and make it once a week during the summer. If I use whole buttermilk, I balance it with Greek nonfat yogurt but plan to try lowfat buttermilk and creme fraiche next time. I use more of the juice from the pickled beets than the recipe says and find it not at all tart. Can't imagine how it could be better but will try it with potatoes and eggs as soon as the weather tops 80.

Nice low fat, low calorie refreshing soup. Only about 100 calories/cup. Liked the cooked potatoes and additional dill others suggested, but didn't think the hard cooked eggs added much. Will add more chopped green onion next time.

This is a traditional family soup in our home. Definite add eggs and chives and skip the sour cream. I like to make it with plain kefir instead of buttermilk for a better flavor. Also we add ice cubes and let them melt in to make it less thick. Hot boiled potatoes with dill are a must as a side dish Wonderful and very healthy!!!

Avoid adding the 1/4 cup picked beet liquid until you taste it as it might make it tooo tart. I had to add some brown sugar to the soup to make it less tart but then it was terrific.

thank god another lithuanian wrote it!!! the hard boiled eggs and chives are a must. Also, using a 2:1 ratio of buttermilk to skim makes the consistency a little nicer.

I'm Lithuanian and this soup is the most popular summer soup back home hands down. I do not know a single person that doesn't like it back in Lithuania. I live in Hawaii right now and since it's summer out here every day I happen to make this soup at least once a week! Except for few differences from epicurious recipe: I use fresh beets, boil them, peel them and grate them, I skip the sour cream, only use the buttermilk, dice up good amount of fresh cucumbers, chop up lots of green onions and fresh dill, add some salt and garnish with few hard boiled and chopped eggs. And we always eat this soup with hot boiled potatoes. WINNER!!!!! EVERY WEEK!!!!

I made this for an alfresco summer dinner. I made it early in the morning and chilled it all day in the fridge, and added the dill & radishes at the last minute. It was a big hit. Very pretty and unusual, and so simple to make.

I make my mom's version, which includes buttermilk, canned beets (not pickled), good cukes, scallion greens and lots of fresh black pepper. Nothing else. Yum.

My mother is Polish and has been making cold beet soup forever. Two big differences: she never uses radishes or dill and always uses lots of scallion greens. I might try the dill, but i won't tell my mom.

This is so tasty and refreshing! I now make it often on these dog days. Agree: don't change a thing -- however, I blend it to near-smoothness so I can sip it from a glass (speedier than a spoon).

Unusual, and refreshing. I agree that this is a good alternative to gazpacho, also a favorite of ours. Didn't change anything. No one flavor dominated, and the crunch from the chopped vegetables was very pleasant. Be sure it's chilled.

Yuck. Truly. I didn't like this at all. I think I was looking for something more authentic. I would've preferred sliced and not chopped veggies (less crunchy). I really found that buttermilk was the overwhelming flavour - the addition of stock might have made it better for me.

I found this recipe in my Gourmet magazine when it first came out. I had just come back from an Eastern European trip that included Warsaw and Krakow. I made it, just as it says, as an alternative to my fovorite cold soup, gazpacho. I loved it then and have done it again this summer in record heat in Colorado for July. Oddly enough, in my collection of ethnic cookboos I have one for Poland and Chlodnik is a 'cold summer barshch'that also includes roast veal, shrimp, and boiled eggs. Chlodnik z kwasnym miekiem on the next page is almost exactly like this recipe with only the addition of lemon juice and translates as Summer Soup.

absolutely delicous and refreshing. I used low-fat sour cream and fat free buttermilk. I also put in blender for a few seconds - I like it less chunky. A winner in my house.

I went into this soup with such high hopes, my yearly Valentines Dinner for 10. Picturing this pink and delish soup as one of the 6 courses. I was grateful that I tried it ahead of time. It was not offensive but it just tasted like pink buttermilk. There has got to be a better choice out there.

I quite liked it, but found it a little too chunky. Would probably puree next time and save some chunks for garnish. Also I made in winter and think this is probably best as a summer dish.

I have made this twice and love it, It is so refreshing and my husband eats it up as fast as I can make it. It is a nice change for a cold soup on summer days.

I have been making this soup over and over again over the summer. I just love it. But I keep it a little low fat by using fat-free buttermilk and Breakstone's 30% less fat sour cream - and it's still delicious. Thanks for such a refreshingly cool idea!!!!

This was a wonderful soup for a hot summer evening. My friend made this soup and added a cup of potatoes and it was GREAT!
