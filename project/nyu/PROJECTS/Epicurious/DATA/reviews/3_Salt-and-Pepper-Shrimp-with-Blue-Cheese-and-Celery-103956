There are some gross mistakes in this recipe as written. I do not have the time to research the problem at the moment; I will just comment on what I encountered. First of all, I made the recipe as written, which I often do the first time, especially in view of the fact that I noticed that people either loved or hated this recipe. The recipe is actually two separate recipes that don't really go together. Regarding the cooking of the shrimp and its sauce, that recipe is ok, although the vein that needs cleaning in the one on the OUTER curve, the top/back of the shrimp. The blue cheese dip as written is a tasteless, visually repulsive, and almost gelatinous glob. I wasted some expensive, creamy French blue trying to make the sauce. I think the mistake is in the amount of olive oil and lack of other ingredients. The sauce turned an unappetizing gray color. To save the sauce, I doctored it up with sour cream and mayonnaise and some spices. The accompaniment for the shrimp is nothing other than celery with a blue cheese dip, and I don't think they do much for the shrimp. Use your own recipe for blue cheese dip or dressing. Bottom line, this is not a carefully tested (or possibly written) recipe.

This was an excellent recipe. Every time I make this dish everyone asks me for the recipe. This recipe is an absolute keeper!!!

The blue cheese dip was OK at best. The shrimp sauce was not good at all. Much too rich for shrimp. The best part of these recipes was the CELERY! I would not make either recipe again.

I found the sauce to be very yummy.. did not make the blue cheese dressing, I used store bought instead. The salt and pepper really works with the sauce. I did not have sherry, used dry vermouth instead. Worked great.. I will definitely make this dish again.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I felt that the olive oil was way too heavy for this recipe. It tasted like something major was missing.

Like the others, I didn't care for the blue cheese dip. The shrimp however, were delicious. I peeled & deveined the shrimp before I sauteed them. This dish offers a very different taste for shrimp.

I used 25-count shrimp that I peeled and deveined, but left the tail on and made them about 5 hours in advance of serving. I'll definitely make this again, but will back down on the garlic to 1 tbsp....the garlic flavor was intense, probably because I had peeled the shrimp (and I'm a garlicoholic). The blue cheese dip I could take or leave, and will probably find a different one next time. If you make the dip, *definitely* use a processor or blender. Originally I wanted the dip with chunks of blue cheese so I whisked it, but the oil separated quickly from the dip...finally had to dump it all in the blender. Also because of the amount of oil it doesn't turn out to have a very pretty color. This dish was shown with the pickled corn rounds, which I'm going to make next time.

This was a great dinner that got rave reviews from all. It gives a good zest to the shrimp and we look forward to having it again.

The sauce was a little heavy but as long as you get good shrimp this is an excellent dish.

We loved the shrimp but the blue cheese dip was too heavy. I substituted a favorite blue cheese dressing recipe and enjoyed it more.

i think the shrimp sauce was a little to heavy but the rest was great.

Great Recipe...maybe Mr. Chef should ask the local 3rd graders which form of "to" to use....

For the love of shrimp, if you people are having this much trouble with the CLEAR directions then ask your favorite local chef to make this for you. Or better yet someone who knows how to cook. The shell obviously is for asthetic purposes and also to keep the shrimp from getting to rubbery. I would have given this a 4 rating but few dishes in the world are truly incomparable.

The blue cheese dip was tastey, but very heavy. The shrimp sauce was also very tastey, but i would use it on already cooked/ already shelled shrimp next time.

The nerve cord is the dark vein on the outer curve of the shrimp. The gut is on the inner side of the curve. So if you are gutting the shrimp you take out the inner vein and "butterfly" the shrimp by cutting through enough of the flesh from the inner curve outward to spread it out but not to cut it in half.

In Australia most peel the green prawns(shrimp)leaving the head attached and then cook them, this way you get the prawn taste not the odd taste the shell gives. Prawns are also very hard to shell when they are hot

Now that we have all attacted the cutting of the shrimp. How was the recipe?

Rating: 0
I think what they are trying to say is that you cut through the shell, and meat through the inner side (cutting the shrimp in half) being careful not to cut through the outer shell, When the shrimp meat is cut in half it would be possible to remove the vein, but the shell would still appear in tact. I think it's just an asthetic thing. It is worded strangely though, I agree.

MY shrimp have the vein on the outside curve! I find it impossible to cut thru' the flesh but not the shell.....are these some kind of "inside-out" genetically altered species?!!!!

This recipe leads one to believe that the vein to be removed from the shrimp is in the inner curve. Isn't the vein on the outer curve?
