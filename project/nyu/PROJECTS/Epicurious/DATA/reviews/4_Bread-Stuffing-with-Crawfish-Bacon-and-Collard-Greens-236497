I made a 1/2 test batch - used shrimp as Crawfish tails are only available frozen right now. But Crawfish would really rock. I Used 1/2 homemade shrimp/chicken stock. A few suggestions-I used pre-torn (hubby wants turnip) greens--next time I'll tear myself as they were rather long w tough stems. My husband loved it but suggested cornbread next time. I think I will sub bacon w chaurice sausage since we didn't taste the bacon and I bought the $$ stuff. One could eliminate meat use veggie/seafood stock for vegitarien only.

Fantastic! Recipe says you can replace shrimp for the crawfish but I think if you can find the CF do it, cause it adds a particular salty sweetness. As well I added more liquid to the stuffing than called for and glad I did cause it was super moist, give it a try for Christmas perhaps, a delightful dish!

This was so delicious! I made half a recipe for Thanksgiving and wished I made the entire recipe. I saved 1/2 pound of crawfish... and I'm making this again for a scrumptious New Years Eve dinner... steak and more greens to go with. Will be super yummy!

Outstanding! I can't wait to make this again. I knew I would like it because I love greens but I was worried about my husband who loves his traditional turkey dressing. He said this was the best, most flavorful dressing he's ever tasted.

Excellent stuffing! We make it for every holiday. We omit the crawfish or shrimp and it is still excellent!

Made this last night to test for this upcoming Thanksgiving. It's going to be my stuffing for this year. My husband and I really liked it. I did use the frozen crawfish and I drained the excess liquid. I also added some rosemary and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the vegetable mixture and also more garlic. Before putting into the oven I added 3 beaten eggs. So glad to have a new recipe.I made the Herb-Roasted Turkey With Shallot Pan Gravy from this website and the turkey was good enough, but my husband thought the gravy was the best I had ever made!

Oh My God!!! I made this stuffing in my cafe today and served with a Cajun Turkey, people were coming back for seconds!! I used a couple different types of bread and didn't cut the crust off, it was fabulous! Keep an eye on your salt, it doesn't take much. Will make again for sure!!

Very good. I used claw crab meat and added a couple of eggs to the mix.

This recipe was very good. It was very easy to make and very tasty. I did not taste the bacon at all so you could realy do without it. Everyone at the table loved it. I would definitely make this again!

This stuff is GREAT! Try substituting cornbread (not Yankee sweet) instead of white bread and adding some red and black pepper to taste. Truly delicious!

I love this recipe! In fact, it's one of my favorite things to make for lunch. It has everything in it -- protein, veggies, carbs -- is delicious and re-heats well (especially with the addition of a little extra chicken broth). I haven't made it with crawfish, but shrimp is an ideal substitute.

I was getting tired of the same ol' cornbread and sausage stuffing, so I made this for Thanksgiving dinner using bay shrimp (crawfish tails were a little too hard for me to find) and red bell pepper. The stuffing got rave reviews from my family, and I will definitely be making it again.
