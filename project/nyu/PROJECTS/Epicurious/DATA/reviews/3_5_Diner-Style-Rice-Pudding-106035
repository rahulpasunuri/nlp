A very good basic recipe if you follow some of the suggestions other reviewers suggested. Two eggs instead of three, reduce cooking time to less than an hour and reduce sugar if you don't like a very sweet dessert. I enjoyed playing with it-instead of vanilla I used amaretto and dried cherries instead of raisins.

I just finished making this and so far it is really good. It still needs to cool. I used non-fat milk and Jasmine rice because they were what I had on hand. I only had to cook the rice 30-40min before it was fully cooked. I also only used 1/4 cup of milk and two eggs in the second half and it still seemed a bit thin, but quickly thickened up. I added pumpkin pie spice as well as cinnamon, but forgot the vanilla extract, as well as leaving out the molasses.

This really is a ridiculously great recipe...as far as very traditional rice puddings go. It's pretty much perfect!

i only cooked the rice for about 30-40minutes, any longer and all the liquid would have been absorbed completely, and the rice would have been mush. the final product was too thick for my liking (i would reduce it to 2eggs next time.) and i would have liked to add atleast a 1/4c more sugar. its a good base recipe to play around with.

Always delicious. I use white River Rice, which is a medium grain rice. I like the texture of it. Today I used skim milk because that is what I had and it was very creamy. I think it is creamy because the River Rice is a sticky rice. I added a touch more sugar and vanilla. I just love this recipe.

Maybe I messed it up somehow, but this did not turn out well at all--grainy instead of creamy.

This is the recipe I've been looking for! It is so creamy and comforting and variations would be so simple...chocolate, banana, almond, etc. I did add a touch of brown sugar. I will taste test molasses next time and am excited to use maple syrup. Love it. Love it. Love it.

Delicious, creamy rice pudding recipe, and a great base--would be nice to add dried fruits in. Used an 'Indian' spice combo--cardamom, one cinnamon stick, nutmeg and a vanilla bean--and served with toasted almonds and whipped cream. I used 1% milk rather than whole as that's all I had on-hand and it was still delicious. Also ended up doubling the recipe (on accident) but only adding in the 3 eggs as I didn't have any more, and it was delicious nonetheless. Made the mistake of cooking it on a lower heat, so it ended up taking almost 4 hours to cook to the texture I desired. I'd put it on medium-low heat.

Tried this with white rice and brown rice....both turned out delicious. I used agave nectar to sweeten up instead of the molasses. Everyone including the kids devoured it!

A waste of time and ingredients.

So good. I made this with brown rice, which helped to cut the sweetness even more, and added a nutty texture and flavor. Will totally make this again.

This rice puddin is honestly the best I have ever made before. All of the other times I have tried to make rice pudding it would always come out to be too soupy and taste too much like a savory dish. This recipe came out to be rich, creamy and sweet - but not too sweet!

This pudding was very easy to make and tasted creamy and delicious! I altered the recipe somewhat, using 2% milk, only 2 eggs, and sprinkled the cinnamon on top. I only cooked the rice for about 40 minutes, and it came out just right--not too mushy.

This rice pudding is scrumptious!!!! I have been looking for a recipe that compared with my father in laws and this pretty close. I love rice pudding and this is a winner!

I made this when we had stomach colds at my house. It was so nice and comforting and delicious.

This recipe was easy to make and tastes exactly like the rice pudding you DO get in diners in the states!

I specifically chose this recipe because of the 100% rating but found it very disappointing. Following the recipe exactly,the rice turned to an unpleasant mushy texture and the cinnamon should be added at the end. Better yet, use a better recipe. The Gonzo one listed on this site was excellent.

I've made this at least three times already and I agree with the previous poster - 1 1/2 hours turns the rice to mush. I used medium grain rice and cooked it on very low heat and 1 hour was plenty. I also added more sugar as it was not that sweet, even with the optional molasses added. Still, it's a good, basic recipe - definitely a keeper!

I thought this was ok, but not great. What I didn't like about it was that the rice cooks so long it is hardly recognizable as rice by the end and is just mush. Also I didn't think it was quite sweet enough and had to add a little extra sugar.

Simply excellent. My kids love it! I made this three times last week. Twice for my kids and once for a diner party. At the diner party I told firmly told not to take it home

Just made this by reconstituting in milk some leftover rice from chinese delivery, then proceeding with the second half of the recipe. Very easy and quick, yet tasty. I more than doubled the rice, keeping the other quantities the same (I like rice pudding a bit chunky, and it's what I had on hand) and it came out wonderfully. Eggs impart a bit of a custard taste which rounds things out nicely. A good basic recipe.

I made this for a big company breakfast potluck and got rave reviews (plus lots of requests for the recipe)! I quadrupled the recipe with no complications and served it in an enormous glass bowl with a sprinkle of cinnamon and whipped cream. What a hit!

This is great. My husband likes rice pudding when he is sick and I spent two hours working on a "rice cream" recipe that turned out wretched. I tried this one and am so pleased with the ease of it along with the fact that it actually tastes good.

I'd make it again, but I'd do some things differently now that I've done it 'according to the rules." First, I'd add more milk to make it more creamy, seconly I would omit the cinnamon, and sprinkle on top afterward. Also, I'm not fussy on what becomes 'reconstituted raisins'--I think I might just throw them on top before I served it so they weren't so puffed up.

This was an easy delicious rice pudding. We loved the creamy texture. I omitted the syrup, and it was sweet enough. We prefer it served warm!

I'd never made rice pudding with eggs (and maple syrup), but this rice pudding was the best I've ever had! I kept snacking on it, so that I barely had enough to serve my guests!

This is a GREAT recipe, and so easy!!! I started with already cooked (left-over) rice and modified as I went. No cinnamon, a personal preference for white-white food. I also used 1% milk instead of whole, and it was still fabulous

It's just what I was looking for, a trip back to my mother's kitchen... the same smells, texture and subtle flavor. Comfort food incarnate! And the best thing about making it is how it lends itself to substitution, whatever's in your larder will work! I used long grain rice, evaporated milk (diluted by half) and maple syrup as my own substitutions and it turned out wonderful!!

I made some changes in that I used lowfat milk rather than whole, replaced the molasses with grated lemon peel as in the suggestion below and increased the amount of raisins. Delicious!

This really is an excellent rice pudding. I've made it a few times and recommend adding at least an additional 1/2 cup of milk if you're going to cook the rice the full 90 minutes. Also, unless you really want the taste of molasses to dominate, I suggest 1 teaspoon instead of 1 Tablespoon.

i added nutmeg and used currants & slivered almonds in the pudding, as well as sprinkled on top for presentation. i also didn't have molasses, so i used maple syrup. the end result was still very satisfying. in future attempts, i could see replacing the vanilla w/almond extract and using dried cherries or blueberries/pecans, too. any dried fruit/nut combo could work. i thought i was going to share this batch, but it isn't looking very likely.

I have had a lot of rice pudding in my day and this is the style that I had been trying to find- not dry and cakey like a lot of rice pudding disappointments...my only complaint is that the ratio of rice to custard is a bit low. Thumb's up.

I think this is very good and easy to make. I only made one change. I didn't have the molasses so I added 1/2 tsp finally grated lemon peel before I poured it into the dish to cool. Very tasty.

This was a quick, inexpensive, and wonderful dessert. I made a double recipe and it still only lasted a few days. My kids liked it a bunch, too.

One of those things that I make at work because I have to but it was well liked by all (health care residents). Very easy, but use the heaviest pan you have. My beat up aluminum stock pot could burn ice water :(

This was great! I used long grain rice, 1% milk, and 1/2 cup of raisins. I also only simmered for 1 hour instead of 1 1/2 hours. Definitely use the molasses!
