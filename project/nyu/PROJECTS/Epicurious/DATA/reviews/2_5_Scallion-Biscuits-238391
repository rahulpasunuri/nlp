Very quick and easy recipe. The biscuits are mild in flavor and could use a little bit more kick (maybe a pinch of sale on top before baking or adding jalapeno), but were a very nice addition to a brunch of eggs and chard. I had no problem getting them to brown. I'd definitely make these again.

These were ok, very mild, I didn't brush w milk & I had trouble getting them to turn brown on top. Cheese would be a nice addition, but mainly they need to get a brown crust on top -- how?

very good! I had two giant bunches of scallions that needed to be used, so I doubled the amount to 2 cups. I also used whole wheat flour and olive oil to make them healthier. I hadn't thought of adding this much "green" herb before, so I am very glad that I came across this recipe. Thanks!

These were pretty good, they looked beautiful. I stole a few ideas from the scallion pancakes recipe also on the website and brushed with a little sesame oil and sesame seeds. These were great for how fast they were, but I can't help feeling they need a little more 'oomph'.

YUM! These whipped up in a jiffy, and were warm and tasty! I really enjoyed the scallion twist and the sqaure shapes. They are mild, but different, and comforting. Great for a weeknight or anytime!

I thought these were average. It was my first time ever making biscuits and I thought they were easy to make. But I thought they needed a bit more flavor to them. Good thing is that they store well - I've had them 3 days and they're still as fresh as the first day.

Our family loves biscuits & I love making them with butter instead of shortening, so this was a recipe I had to try. We really enjoyed them. I followed the recipe as written - I especially liked the idea of patting the dough into a square and cutting square biscuits - baked them on a baking stone, and served with butter. I'll make these again and wouldn't hesitate to serve them to dinner guests.

Ok. Maybe it was me, though I can't imagine where I went wrong. I followed this recipe EXACTLY. The texture was nice but they had absolutely NO flavor. I would add more salt without hesitation (at the very least). Maybe sour cream...feta...ANYTHING!
