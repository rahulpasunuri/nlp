I live in South Carolina and this does not even come close to a classic red rice. See the title Classic Red Rice recipe in this site.

Ditto on what the reviewer from Atlanta has written. This recipe is NOT red rice at least not the way it's been prepared in Charleston and the preparation for Hoppin' John is also completely different.

I'm following suit with the reviewer from Alanta. This is NOT red rice, cerrtainly does not resemble anthing that I ate as a child in Charleston nor does the addition of black-eyed peas make it hoppin' john. The preparations at least in Charleston for these two dishese are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from one another.

This is NOT red rice and adding beans would NOT make it hoppin' jon! Don't remove any bacon drippings (flavor!). Sautee onion & a chopped green pepper. Add 1 can tomato SAUCE and 1 c. water. Add 2 c. UNCOOKED rice and simmer 5 min. Transfer to steamer (or add ½ c. water and simmer covered), cook for @ 20 min (add water if dry). Crumble bacon on top and serve. Add kielbasa to make main dish (sausage purlo).

I wasn't happy with this recipe. I added black-eyed peas for texture but there wasn't enough flavor. Just blah. Can't think of what would improve it.
