Made this for company and everyone loved it!... the pork temderloin was delicious and the cherry salsa was perfect!...even had enough salsa for the following night to go with the grilled salmon. Even my picky husband loved it!

The salsa was excellent. I baked the tenderloin (would have loved to grill but the weather did not cooperate.) I served with a mashed garlic/sour cream red potato. It was very good.

Had an abundance of cherries from a friend, so tried this salsa and pork. Salsa was interesting...expected it to be much sweeter, but the cherry taste was overpowered by the other ingredients. Went well with the pork, though.

Great recipe, especially now that cherries are in season. Yes, it should say fresh "cilantro," not coriander (the seeds). East and tasy. The sweet & spicy salsa with the tenderloin works great! Will make it again.

Very good, but not over the top. The salsa was nice with the pork.

This was delicious! Used mixed peppercorns and the flavor was wonderful and it looked nice. Used fresh cherries and while a pain in the rumpola to pit and chop enough to double the recipe it was well worth it!

This was a hit for all at Valentines dinner! used two 1 lb tenderloins, which required about 30 minutes of baking -- still very moist. had to use Trader Joe frozen dark cherries for salsa since I could not find fresh cherries in season, and it still tasted great. A nice compliment to the peppered pork tenderloin.

Absolutely delicious! I added some chinese 5 spice seasoning to the pork, which was v. nice. I used a combination of Bing and Rainier cherries. The two different colours made for an attractive presentation. Definitely will make this again, esp. the salsa.

This was a delicious and easy recipe. I have a hard time finding some ingredients here, and substituted prunes for cherries in the salsa - it was terrific! served with onion and sour cream mashed potatoes.

I didn't actually make the salsa. Instead I made a cherry/redwine/cream sauce ... was very pleased with how it came out. The temperature was 165 when we took it out, but it still was quite juicy.

This is a wonderful recipe, especially for those who like coriander. The blend of sweet and tart is a great with the pork. (And, to the cook from Lafayette: You should be careful about correcting others when they are right. Coriander is both the plant and the seed. The leaves are also known as cilantro.)

I like the peppered tenderloin but the cherry salsa was just fair. I had 98% of it left. The recipe stated fresh coriander is needed but should read fresh cilantro. Coriander is a seed.

We loved this pork tenderloin. The cooking time and method was perfect. The cherry salsa was different and tasty - - definitely use fresh cherries. We use an inexpensive olive pitter to pit the cherries - - it takes about 2 minutes!

Easy and quick (once the cherries are pitted and chopped). The pork was juicy and tender, the salsa really good. Served with saffron mashed potatoes. wonderful colors.

Tasty - but not a 'winner' in my book. Had it the next night as leftovers and it was amazingly bland. I won't make this again.

This was very tasty and easy. I use a toothpick to pit the cherries. It is qiuck and easy. It also does not require another special gadget. We will be eating this often while cherries are in season.

We have a Fourth of July tradition of picking cherries at one of the local farms in southwestern NY (peak cherry-picking time). Fortunately, they will pit the cherries for free! It has also become our tradition to come back and grill this recipe. It is so easy and so good. This year I also served it with a salad of mixed greens, pitted cherries, sliced apricots and a poppy seed dressing. Yum!

My husband grilled pork loin chops following the seasoning in the recipe. They were great and so was the cherry salsa. Actually, pitting the cherries by splitting them with my fingers and removing the pit was faster that using a knife.

This is the best recipe for pork tenderloin by far. I loved the cherry salsa and my husband was crazy about the peppered pork. This is the only way I will be preparing pork tenderloin from now on.

This was fantastic. We really enjoyed it. Slightly different, but excellent! Easy to make with the cherry pitter we own.

This is a wonderful dinner! Be careful how long you cook your tenderloin; mine only took 12 minutes. If I had left it in for 20, it would have burned.

I can't believe how simple of a dish could taste so great! The salsa was a snap (a cherry pitter is a great investment). The pork tenderloin was easy to prepare. Using the meat thermometer was a must as the pork came out juicy and cooked to perfection. As long as cherries are in season, I be making this dish often.

very very nice--used fresh bing cherries and admittedly it takes a little while to pit the cherries but this salsa is soooooooooooo good that it is worth the effort, believe me. I'd only use fresh cherries with this recipe but i'm from texas and a stickler on salsas. HIghly hIGHLY hIGHLY reccommend. And the pepper-crust on the tenderloin!!!!! yippee! girlfriend loved it.

Loved the salsa. Didn't make any changes in the proportions and it turned out very nicely.

The spiciness of pork's seasoning is complemented so well with the sweetness of the cherries in the salsa! Yum!

I made this dish when originally published with some variation. I used dark cherry pie filling (fruit) instead of pitting fresh cherries then doubled the remainder of salsa ingredients and let the flavors blend at room temp. I seared the tenderloin, then roasted. Sooooo yummy! My 10 year old daughter loved it too!

I bought a hand cherry pitter specifically for this recipe - it's a hassle without it, but with - its easy and really wonderful to cook for friends (who enjoy the heat)....

Pitting & cutting the cherries is a hassle, pushing the advertised 45-minute timeframe, but the dish is great--I made it in the summer with fresh Bing cherries and extra jalapenos.
