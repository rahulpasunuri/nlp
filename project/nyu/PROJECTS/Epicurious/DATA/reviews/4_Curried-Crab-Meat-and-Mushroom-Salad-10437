This is ridiculously easy to make and very good. I added scallions and a little carrot as well. Very popular with the group. Great first course for a small dinner party or to bring to a pot luck. Had leftovers in omelets for breakfast.

It was very light and tasty. I used a fat free mayo that I enhanced with basil and garlic (another recipe from this site.)

This is delicious! I used Dungeness crab and served over chopped avocado and fennel bulb. We used the leftovers the next morning in omelets. A keeper

This recipe is fabulous. I could not believe how delicious curry compliments crab meat. My friend served this over lettuce with fresh tomatoes - it's a keeper in my book.

Fantastic. I added grated carrots and green onions.

I used imitation crab as I am kosher, just added it at the last minute. I also used a homemade eggless mayo as one guest was allergic. I also chopped the celery and mixed everything up together. Everyone raved about it. You have to like curry though.

A friend sent me this one a couple years ago, and it's absolutely delicious! I add black olives, serve with crusty bread and a crisp white wine, it makes a great meal.
