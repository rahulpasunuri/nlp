If you like beans, these are amazing! Great with BBQ meats... and summertime is coming! No more ranch beans from a can here. Make these with Rancho Gordo pinto beans from Napa (you can mail order all kinds of organic beans to the US)... they're so delicious.

Great recipe for "ranch beans"! A note to those not living in the SW-- they are supposed to be very soupy-- that's how it's done. I make this recipe with one small change-- I double the amount of chile and hot sauce (it's a little mild for us as written), and I usually throw in an extra chipotle for flavor. Very, very good!

6 tablespoons of chili powder is way too much, must be a typo, try 6-7 teaspoons of hot chili powder if you like spicy dishes. An excellent winter dish, we make it with a semiboneless hamsteak and leave out the saltpork.

A really different taste for pintos. Loud in taste. Thin soup base. It's worth the effort to find out if it's right for you, But i'll not do this one again.

Yummy! I used half a jalapeno and only 3 T of chili powder, and it could've used more onion and garlic. We had it over rice, and it was definitely something I'll make again.

These beans are easy to make and pretty good. I don't find that the ham adds much excitement to the dish and think I'll leave it out next time.
