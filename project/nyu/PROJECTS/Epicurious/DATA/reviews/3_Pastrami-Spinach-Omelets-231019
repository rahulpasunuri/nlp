Halved the recipe and made this fritatta style in the oven. Also added some cubed fetta before baking. Very tasty and simple to prepare.

So easy and satisfying to the taste buds and stomach. All the ingredients compliment each other well. Will make it again a few times.

This is a very good basic omelet. I frequently make a similar one frittata-style to serve on a brunch buffet. One question though. What is pastrami doing in the PORK recipe section?
