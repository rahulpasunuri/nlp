We really love this dip!It is quick and easy to make, and everyone we've served it to asks for the recipe. I actually use a little less cumin than called for in the recipe.

I made this following the recipe -- I added a little ground chipotle as my husband thought it was "bland". I didn't really like it, and my guests ate it... eventually. It wasn't awful, but an unappetizing color and nothing special.

I spiced this dip up with chipotle peppers and about 1/3 cup of pepper jack...a little added fat, but more flavor. It wasn't spectacular, but fine.

YUM...I really like this recipe. Full of flavor and fiber and not much fat. I will definitely be making this again, as I am always looking for dips that taste great and are not based on cream cheese or mayo. I served it with soft tacos and it was a hit!

I was the only one who ate ths. Our company passed, and my husband likes my pinto bean dip much better. It's always a hit!

Very tasty and easy dip. I think I will make it in the processor next time so it is less chunky. www.ilovecilantro.com!!!

Fast, easy and tasty recipe. Have made this several times already using fat free sour cream instead of the full fat one called for in the recipe. I served it with toasted, lightly salted pita chips. Even easier if you make it in the food processor.
