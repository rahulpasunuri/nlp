We had it together with lamb shanks, but it was much too salty.

Yuk! Didn't work for me, too thick, but maybe I have bad luck with polenta, because I have never been able to make a polenta recipe that I like.

This is exactly the way I like polenta cooked! One of my guests doesn't like bay leaves so she didn't care for it but the other 16 guests loved it!

Not particularly amazing on its own, but this was meant to be served w/ a hearty, earthy lamb dish. Great w/ the braised lamb shanks w/ bay leaves (the recipe this polenta was meant to accompany), as the sauce from the lamb goes quite well w/ the polenta. I'd reduce the salt, though -- after a while, it all tasted a bit to salty. I bet this would be nice w/ a chunky tomato-eggplant ragout w/ Parmesan, too.
