This is fantastic! I made it today for the first time. Easy to make, can't compare with store bought.

very tasty and popular. using real vanilla beans is a must. the tricky-est thing is avoiding ice crystals, but after a week in the freezer my batch was still smooth and creamy.

I made this tonight - my 1st attempt at making homemade ice cream. It was delicious & very rich. I would make it again & hope to soon!

I made this dessert for a gourmet supper and everyone raved about it. I have since made it several times more. So easy - always consistant outcome. I highly recommend it. FYI: you can find vanilla beans on ebay for $1.25 or less.

This is ultra rich, utlra creamy vanilla ice cream. Served it with spiced apple pie on for a chilly fall dinner party and it was perfect. I probably will use a lighter version for summer or spring desserts, but for heavy fall, winter ones, this is perfect.
