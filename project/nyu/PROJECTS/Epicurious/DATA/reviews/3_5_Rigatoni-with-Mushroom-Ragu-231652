This was easy and delicious. I used canned diced tomatoes (no food mill) and Barilla enriched penne. I will definitely add this to my weeknight rotation.

I used 28oz canned tomatoes. This is incredibly flavorful and very easy to make. It got rave reviews from a very picky eater; I plan to keep this recipe around!

This was a really flavorful, easy meal to make. The "food mill" is totally unnecessary--canned diced tomatoes worked beautifully.

Opps! Oh I also added some whipping cream...my husband raved about it!

I was pressed for time so I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and it turned out just great...and I didn't have to clean a mill or a blender!

I am making this recipe for the second time this week!! I loved it.. very simple to make. We used bowtie pasta and it was very very good. I went ahead and took the rosemary off the stem and left it in the pasta, turned out great!

I would recommend this dish for cooler weather - it is very hearty and robust. Excellent quality canned tomatoes are key. The rosemary was a nice addition, although it did break apart in the simmering process; there was no way to retrive it intact!

I really liked this recipe but have to admit I used really good canned tomatoes and finished cooking the pasta in the tomato sauce along with a cup of pasta water. I love what this does for a simple pasta recipe.

This is a good basic mushroom sauce. Very simple. I think all those mushrooms mellowed out the acidity of the tomatoes (along with the bit of sugar). I did not need to add a pinch of baking soda or red wine like I do sometimes. There's nothing like homemade sauce!

Well it was good enough but nothing special. I doubled the mushrooms (as suggested) and this seemed about right; also added some red wine to the mushrooms as they cooked, trying to "jazz" it up a bit. There are thousands of other pasta recipes out there so I probably won't come back to this one.

The name sounds better than the actual dish! It was O.K....but nothing special. There are other pasta dishes to explore before I would come back to this one!

1 pound of mushrooms is equal to 454 grams to be exact. I like your idea better (1 kilo). The more mushrooms the merrier.

I used a 28-oz can of crushed, roasted tomatoes and this turned out great. The rosemary was a subtle and nice addition. Our company loved it and best of all it was very easy and quick to prepare.

As a graduate of the hotel Management school of Lausanne I really enjoy Bon Appetit. This recipe probably called for 1 kilo of mushrooms, therefore the discrepancy in the rates. 1 kilo of mushrooms thickly sliced would equal approx. 4 cups of mushrooms. Enough for the recipe. Delicious and easy to make.

re: mushroom measurement. 1 lb. is weight of mushrooms, 8 cups is what it will roughly be in *volume*. you should be fine if you buy a 1 lb. (16 oz.) container of sliced mushrooms.

Help! This looks good, but the mushroom amount is out of whack. Would it be one pound of sliced mushrooms or eight cups of sliced mushrooms?

We loved this. I have made it twice since my Gourmet arrived. It is easy, tastes great without being showy. It is comforting and delicious.
