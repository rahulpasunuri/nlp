I made these for a dinner party and they were a big hit! Easy and delicious.

This recipe is excellent. I had my first arepa when I was 15 & living in Venezuela attending the American high school back in 1970. After 4 years in Venezuela I moved to Colombia for 3 years. So I know a bit about the authentic varieties of arepas. Just a tip when frying the arepas, sprinkle a little of the arepa flour (without the other ingredients) in the frying pan. This will prevent them from sticking to the pan and ripping off the crust outside when flipping them or taking them out.

OH MY GOSH! An instant favorite with my family! Since I have diabetes, I made a few changes: skim powder milk, splenda, low fat cheese and low carb spread. And they were still YUUUMMY! Some "chorizo" on the side and WOW! Even my little grandkids loved them!

ok so i've been making these every which way...adding baking powder, an egg, herbs, different cheeses, lard instead of butter....anyway, as i have no familiarity with traditional arepas i was wondering if they are supposed to be so dense and cakey? whatever the case, they are delicious.

South America is a pretty big continent! to say arepas are a typical South American breakfast is very innacurate, arepas are only typical of Venezuela and Colombia (and each country's version is very different from the other) also is a substitute for bread is it eaten for breakfast, or to accompany any meal. They are delicious too! I have not met one person who didn't love them after trying them, the best way to have them is like a 'sandwich' stuffed with butter and cheese, or meat, or beans, or anything that comes to mind.

No queso and less sugar. Delish!

The basic concept seems good but, just as the previous review noted, the arepas ended up way too sweet. Will try again without the sugar and report back ;)

I liked this recipe, though I am going to try them next time without the sugar. They were a bit too sweet. I used Country Crock instead of butter and they tasted fine. Also, I did them on the Arepa Maker (Tostiarepa), and they stuck to the grill. Not a major problem though.

I'm from Venezuela and eat arepas, NOT APREPAS, practically every morning, i absolutely LOVE them! They're traditional here as is PERICO, chop up an onion and cook in a pan with some oil, when slightly brown, add chopped tomatoes, cook for a couple of minutes, add eggs and scramble...FANTASTIC! that's the traditional perico made here in Venezuela...enjoy!

My favorite way to cook these are on the grill. That is the typical way it is done and it gives them a more authentic taste. Once they are ready, melt more cheese and butter on top and add a little salt. They are also delicious with "huevos pericos" (scrambled eggs with tomatoes and scallions) on top!
