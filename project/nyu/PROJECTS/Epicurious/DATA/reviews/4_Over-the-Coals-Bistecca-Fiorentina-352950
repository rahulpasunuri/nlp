It's the middle of winter, and we started by cooking this on the propane grill but ran out of propane so we finished broiling it indoors. It was awesome, nonetheless. The arugula paired wonderfully!

This is the way Tuscan steak should be. It takes a long time to get up a bed of hardwood coal embers (oak is best), but it is so worth it. You need a great cut at least 2" thick T-bone, and place the steak right on the hot WOOD embers. It has a pure woody flavor (yum!) Don't do it on charcoal unless you want your steak to taste like coal. This is the way you get it in Italy. It is really worth the trouble. EXCELLENT.
