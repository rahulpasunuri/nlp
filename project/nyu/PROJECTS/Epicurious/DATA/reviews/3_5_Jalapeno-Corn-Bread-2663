Ok so I made a much-modified version of this, but it came out delicious and substantial. This recipe is similar to, but healthier than, the one on allrecipes. The allrecipes version has more sugar and fat (oil). My modifications were: substituting 1/2 cup of the regular corn meal with 1/2 cup blue masa; 3 heaping teaspoons organic sugar for the 2 T sugar; substituting the buttermilk with 1/2 cup sour cream + 1/2 cup light cream cheese + 1/2 cup cottage cheese + juice of 1 lime; for fat, instead of butter, I added about 1/3 cup melted bacon fat saved from bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers I had made a few days before; and adding 1/4 c chopped onion, 2 t chili powder, 1 t garlic powder, and adding a few T water because it was quite dry when first mixed together. Cooked in a cast iron pan with 2 T oil in it at 400 F for 30 minutes (but I am at high altitude, ~4500 ft). My only complaint is that is was VERY crumbly right out of the oven, but perhaps that is to be expected; but I had to try it immediately of course. It holds together and comes out of the pan much better the next day, and is very moist (which is probably due to all the bacon fat in it...) Also, the chunks in the cottage cheese are not noticeable after cooking, and it is definitely not too hot if you de-seed the jalapenos. Next time I make it, some modifications I would like to try are using less fat of course, maybe use coconut oil or regular oil, adding more chili powder and garlic powder (1 t each additional), adding green chiles, shredded cheese, chopped broccoli, ground beef or other chopped meat like pepperoni, green onions, honey instead of sugar, use all sour cream or greek yogurt (plain or honey flavor) for the buttermilk, and add flaxmeal/psyllium/wheat bran for fiber. But I think the lime juice was a good add and will keep using that.

This cornbread was super. I feel like it was missing a little something but I'm not sure what. Maybe a couple more tablespoons of sugar or honey? But nevertheless very good.

Being a cornbread lover, I love this cornbread I add green onions, half cup each of Sharp cheddar and cojack cheese. I also up the sugar to 1/2 cup to make a little sweeter and up flour to 3/4 cup. This cornbread is so moist and good, I butter and grill both sides then eat with jalapeno jelly! I have found perfect cornbread recipe!

This just doesn't have enough flavor. I added sharp cheddar cheese and corn at the suggestion of other reviewers, but the result was just really bland corn bread with some jalapeno heat to it. I realize there are a lot of positive reviews, though, so if you do make this, I'd recommend more salt. Just 1 large pickled jalapeno provided plenty of heat. I won't make this one again.

super quick and easy to make, came out great. followed this recipe and added a cup of frozen corn and about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, per earlier reviews. good flavor and texture, nice crispy crust. will definitely make again.

This was not my favorite cornbread recipe, but I suspect it's my fault: I used coarse rather than fine cornmeal (came out too gritty), and I used the milk/sour cream combo another reviewer described because I couldn't find buttermilk. The bread was hearty and good, but not as savory as I was hoping for.

Added ~1 cup of aged white cheddar, and used pickled jalapenos instead, seeds and all. Very good, I'm not going to look for corn bread recipes anymore.

I made this with a bunch of scallions (tender green and white parts) chopped, and 1 cup mild shredded cheddar. Ok, so not a jalapeno corn bread, but it was delicious and much appreciated by guests and family. I will definitely make it again

I made this without jalapenos just to have a basic cornbread to go with chili. I thought it was perfect! Moist and corn-y, but made with much less butter than many other recipes. I'll make it a standby!

I also add corn and cheese...usually frozen corn. Also, I saute chopped onion and the jalapenos before adding to the batter. Since we're way past fat-free, I heat my iron skillet with 1/4 C. oil on the stove, then pour in the batter and bake in the oven, about 25 minutes. Makes a great crusty edge.

this was really good. I don't think the texture is where i wanted it to be (a bit too crumbly and light) but the flavor was right on. all in all, really good. and the preparation couldn't be easier. i should have used some jalapenos seeds ...the heat didn't come through after cooking. i plan to use this recipe again,

Excellent corn bread recipe. This isn't the sweet cornbread you might get as a breakfast muffin. It's more savory and a good accompaniment to chili. I subbed 1 c. milk and 1/2 c. sour cream for the buttermilk. I also added 1 c. of shredded jalapeno jack cheese and omitted the 4 jalepno chilies. Also added a pkg of frozen (thawed) shoepeg white corn. It was perfect. I think the cheese had a binding effect to keep it from being crumbly as some here have complained about.

I've eaten a lot of cornbread in my life but this was my first try at making it from scratch. I love super spicy food, but since I was serving this with chili, I only used 1/2 the amount of jalapeno and I was glad I did... it was a bit hotter than I expected. I think it's because I had abnormally hot jalapenos. The store only had reduced fat buttermilk in stock, so I used that and it worked out fine. I checked the bread about 5-6 minutes before the timer was set to go off and it was already done! I'll reduce the baking time the next time I make it. There wasn't a piece left.

I made this for a small gathering of friends and served with a spicy chili - my friends said it was the best f***ing cornbread they'd ever had. I substituted green onion for the jalepeno and doubled the recipe. Used cooking spray instead of butter to prep the pan - absolutely zero sticking the pan and cut very nicely. The chili was good - but it was really a cornbread delivery system.

The perfect consistency, not too dry, not too moist, and also not too sweet or too salty. All in all, just right.

Too dry!!!

Very easy to make and quite tasty. I added fresh white corn. It added a nice crunch and some sweetness. This bread is not sweet at all, so if you like it that way I would suggest increasing the amount of sugar. I made muffins and baked for 18 minutes. Perfect!

This is super easy, delicious corn bread. I've made it twice: once with fresh jalapenos and once with "nacho jalapenos" from a jar. Both were great.

very good and nice and moist. i added thawed frozen corn and substituted chipotle peppers for the jalepenos and whole wheat flour for the white flour and sour cream and milk for the buttermilk, because of what i had on hand. try this corn bread, it's delicious.

Super easy and super delicious.

Yummy. I had processed fresh jalapenos for jelly and had about 1 cup left over so I doubled this recipe and added 1 cup of cheddar and the left over cup of jalapenos. I baked them in 6 mini loaf pans. My husband's only suggestion was to add fresh corn for an added dimension...it's trying to have a professional chef for a husband!

Very tasty--great with chile or black bean soup. I toasted the jalapenos, whole, on a dry skillet before seeding and chopping.

This is a really good, but not great recipe for Jalapeno corn bread. I doubled the recipe and bake 36 corn muffins for a get together. I was concerned about the amount of jalapenos but in the end they were fine or could have been a bit spicier. I also added two cups grated sharp cheddar to the DOUBLED recipe. Next time I may add about a teaspoon of chili powder to the batter for a bit more flavor.

This was the BEST, MOISTEST, most delicious corn bread I have ever made from scratch. I used Bob's Red Mill Corn Meal (medium grind) and 1.5 jalapenos (that I must admit were a little wrinkly). OUTSTANDING!!!!!!

This cornbread had good texture and was moist. We like our cornbread sweeter though, so next time we will up the sugar. I only used 3 jalapenos because I was afraid it would be too spicy, but it actually wasn't, so I will try the recommended 4 next time.

This bread was wonderful. It was especially good the next day when I toasted a slice and topped it with some margarine. I think that this would be wonderful with a southwestern dinner or a brunch. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

being an avid cornbread lover, I have to give this a major thumbs up..I used pickled japs and sifted all the dry ingredients...this is the perfect side for gumbo or chili..I have also made a milder version by throwing in some pominto stuffed olives(finely chopped) instead of the japs..

I also only baked for 25 minutes and it came our just right. Good amount of spice as well.

YUM! Finally found the perfect corn bread recipe. I cooked it for 5 minutes less than specified and it was perfectly moist, also warmed up on the day after. I'll use this as my "base" recipe - I think it would be great with or without jalapenos, green onions, fresh corn, cheese... mmmmm.

Very easy recipe to make and doesn't require much time or effort. I had to use jalapenos from a jar as I couldn't find any fresh ones - worked just fine. I was also out of buttermilk so I warmed the 1.5 cps milk in the microwave and then added 2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice and mixed well. Prepare this a few minutes ahead of time to allow the milk to sour. It's a good substitute for buttermilk. And mine required less cooking time ~20 minutes @ 218 °C

I'm very picky about cornbread and thought that this was terrific for a relatively low fat version. I reduced the sugar and used a small can of milder, chopped chilies.

This cornbread could have been a bit moister, but the jalapeno flavor made up for that--it had just the right amount of spice. I served it with the Folly Island Shrimp and Grits (which I highly recommend) for a down-home dinner.

Nice, easy recipe. A bit crumbly after keeping in the fridge and warmed up, but still tasty. The Jalapeno's weren't hot enough to make it difficult to eat, but gave a nice zing.
