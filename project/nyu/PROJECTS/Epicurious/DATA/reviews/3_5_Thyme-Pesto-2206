Very tasty - I am eating this right now with pasta and shrimp! It's a great way to use up leftover Thyme. As with most pestos, I used less oil - about 1/3C here - and think it would have been fine with even less.

I had a huge batch of thyme and this recipe was perfect.It is tedious to strip, but well worth the effort. I added the grated zest of one lemon. It has a really fresh, clean taste. In addition to serving it with pasta, I rubbed some under the skin of a chicken I roasted. Yummmmm!

This was very good thyme pesto, if you use strong thyme to balance off all the parsley. But it does take a while to strip all those little thyme leaves...This year I'm growing Oregano Thyme, with larger leaves. Hopefully it will be less thyme consuming hahahaha.
