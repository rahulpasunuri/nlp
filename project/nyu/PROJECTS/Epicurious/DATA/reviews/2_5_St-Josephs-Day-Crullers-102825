A bit bland--I added a pinch of nutmeg and vanilla and topped with powdered sugar instead of pastry cream. Still not quite what I'd hoped for, but it did have that nice egg-y flavor, not too sweet (my biggest complaint about commercial doughnuts/pastries) and a nice texture--crunchy outside, sticky but not gooey inside. The whole dough-on-parchment worked a lot better than I'd expected. Next time may add a bit more flavor to the dough.
