This is an easy, impressive dinner, but I recommend making it a two-day project. I made the marinade before work on day one, boiled the potatoes after work on day one, chopped the peppers and onions before work on day 2, and then came home the evening of day 2 and threw everything together. I don't know about you guys, but incremental food prep is critical for working folks! The steak was AMAZING after sitting in the marinade for 30 hours, and I thought the potato-onion cakes were outstanding as well - unlike some other reviewers, I thought the green onions and cumin were well-balanced. I will definitely make this again!

Marinade was delicious. Would only change the amount of soy sauce by a few tbsp(or use lite) as it overpowered. I did boil the marinade but discarded it because it came out muddy (maybe the blood from the steak). It's so juicy and flavorful that it doesn't need it. The whole family loved it.

I avoid cooking steak because I tend to overcook them, but this was great! I halved the recipe, reduced the oil by 1T and used both balsamic and red wine vinegar. I marinated the meat for only 4.5 hrs, turning every hour. I broiled 3 pieces in my toaster oven for 20 min, the larger piece (~8 oz) was too rare but the 2 smaller ones (~6oz) were med rare, just right. The marinade was so wonderful! There was no strong soy sauce flavor, nor was it salty. The vinegars really worked with this dish, I would like to try it again, perhaps with a less expensive cut of meat. Didn't do the side dishes, just wanted a steak recipe that was foolproof -- and this is it!

Great! Cut the soy sauce in half and be sure to let it marinade as long as you can. My family loved it!

Very nice marinade for sirloin and the onions and peppers went very nicely with the steak.

The steak was simply awesome. I just served for dinner and my husband raved about it. A pinch of cumin definately added a special taste to the meat. Certainly, I will cook it again.

This was DELICIOUS!!! I had my meat marinate for about 32 hours and the flavor was great, no one flavor overwhelmed another. I kept the marinade the same, but I used half the amount of beef and halved the pepper and onions part of the recipe. (maybe thats why the meat was so tasty?)the potato onion cakes were a little too oposite the meat part to balance it, so i would recommend those as a breakfast snack as opposed to with this dinner. For this dinner i would suggest red potatoes quartered, boiled and then fried with olive oil and your favorite spices.

I just found this recipe on epicurious but have been making it since it appered in Bon Appetit in '91. I cook ALOT and do my best not to make the same dishes more than once or twice, with som eexceptions. This recipe is one of them. I turn to this dish at least once every five times I make steak, and there are some members of my family that boo every time I make steak and don't use this recipe. It's fast and easy, just be careful with the oil, too much and the sauce will be too greasy. Also, an extra dash of cumin dosn't hurt. Anyone scared of the potato recipe, DON'T BE! Cumin and potatoes go GREAT togeather!

Due to several scheduling snafu's, this wound up marinating for about 2 days. The steaks were *very* tender. I liked the marinade and will used sweet onions for the pepper and onions. Very nice.

Rating: 3
Awesome! Everyone raved over how delicous this dish was! Our dinner plans changed, and I ended up marinating the steak for about 2 1/2 days - perhaps that had something to do with the wonderful flavors? I used balsamic vinegar, too. Oh, and the potato onion cakes were scrumptious, too. Yum yum -- both dishes are on my make-again list! (but the steak really rocked!)

The steak was a knockout!! I first made it for about 40 people, and couldn't keep them out of the kitchen after dinner. They came in to finish whatever was left of the steak. I am often requested to repeat it. 24 hours in about the perfect time for the meat to marinade.

I, like others, just made the steak... and although it was minimal work, I can't say I was overly impressed. The sauce was decent, but not worthy of note. In fact, its debateable whether or not its even worth the time of writing the review. Maybe they should call the recipe "anti-climatic steak" cause I somehow feel unsatisfied. I made some bad-ass veggie stirfry as a side dish though... I'd give that a high rating if I could find it on epicurious.

Not sure if I should review this or not but here goes. Didn't make the potato cakes, liked the marinade and steak, loved the peppers and onions.

We absolutely loved the way the steak turned out. I would probably pair it a side starch other than the potato-onion cakes.

I thought the marinade with the steak tasted great and I would make that again. I skipped the onion/pepper recipe. The potato-onion cakes were just okay. I liked the concept, but thought they lacked in flavor and the cumin just didn't do it for me-and yes I added plenty of salt and pepper to taste.

This didn't turn out as well as I'd imagined. The steak had too much of a 'soy saucey' taste.

Outstanding! Relatively easy to make. I didn't have Marjoram for the onions and peppers, so i substituted oregano, it was absolutely delicious! I would make it again in a heartbeat!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I used the red-wine vinegar and added a squeeze of lemon juice. I will definately make this again!

Yum!! I used 6 individual "Omaha Steaks" top sirloin steaks, marinated them overnight and then grilled them. They were perfect. I made the pepper/onion mixture and the potato-onion cakes --it made a wonderful, rustic Sunday night supper. I didn't add mushrooms to the pepper/onion mixture as one cook suggested but I will next time.

Great if you really love Balsamic Vinegar -- flavor comes through very strong in the marinade. I added some cream to the reduction which toned it down at bit. Would reduce the amount of cumin and scallions in the potato-onion cakes if I every make them again.

I used this marinade for Christmas dinner on filet mignon. My husband saw the steaks marinating and commented 'don't ruin the steaks'. However, after he and everyone else tasted the steaks - everyone raved. It was a happy cap to a wonderful Christmas!!

I'm no meat eater and barely a cook but my husband and other carnivorous companions thought this steak was fabulous!

Skipped the peppers, only marinated per recipe. Depsite using low sodim soy sauce, found the steak to be extremely salty, even after marinating only 6 hours. Pretty disappointing.

This was great! I made it about 6 months ago after seeing it on the picture of Bon Appetit. The potato-onion cakes also came out great.

Delicious! I skipped the peppers, used red onion and lots of it, and let the onion slices caramelize in the pan. Really great flavours.

I made it with ribeye steaks also, and they turned out to be magnificent! Every bite was amazing, and it was so easy because I grilled the steaks. Instead of making the onion cakes, I made a portabella mushroom sidedish and roasted garlic mashed potatoes to go with it...mmmm...=9

Loved it. We used rib eyes instead and they worked very well. Only marrinated for about 5 hours but still had great flavour. Onion cakes worked well with the dish also.

What the marinade did to that meat is "OUTRAGEOUS". I overcooked the steaks (by my family's standards) but it didn't matter the taste was still awesome. If your in a pinch for time the 24 hour marinade time is not necessary, I marinated my steaks for about six hour. You definately want to boil the marinade and use it as a sauce you wont be dissapointed. I threw in some mushrooms with the peppers and onions and that too was a tasty accompaniment with the meat. I made the potato cakes but found the pungent taste of the cumin to be overpowering of the cakes. I would make them again but without the cumin. Open a good bottle of Cabbie with this and "WOW"....

Very tasty. Instead of the potato cakes, I served fried potato-onion perogies. I will make this again for sure.

I read the reviews and couldn't believe that everyone skipped the potato onion cakes. They were fairly easy and very delicious with the steak. The whole meal was a sucess on July 4th and I am making it all again for the millenium. It is great with popovers!

The meat was good and made great steak sandwiches with the leftovers, but I won't be making the potato cakes again. Too much of a hassle and too hard to time it with the rest of the meal (and I burned myself on the oil)! Next time maybe I'll try baked or something less labor intensive.

This was VERY good. I didn't bother with the potato cakes (just roasted potatos on the grill). You have to give yourself a little time to make the sauce, but I found I was able to do most of it while the meat rested. Very good.

Excellent dish. The garlic and rosemary marinade is wonderful. And it's even easy! I didn't try to make the potato-onion pancakes. I served the steak with the red peppers/onions and mashed potatoes.

The marinade is one of the best I have found for a top sirloin. It is very flavorfull and quick to make. A great tenderizer too. Since I grilled the meat, I thought I would simplify things by also grilling bell pepper halves and slabs of onion instead of sauteing them. Yummy! In keeping the rest of the meal simple, I served roasted potatoes. I didn't even attempt the potato-onion cakes.

Steak marinade is one of the best ever. Always serve to rave reviews. Bell peppers and onions are also delicious. Have never been able to successfully make the potato pancakes.
