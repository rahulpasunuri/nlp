Agreed with previous reviewers about flavor and color. Needed to increase curry multiple fold. Also added cumin. I added paprika for color. Flavor ended up quite delicious, but as the recipe is written, slightly bland and ugly.

Gobbled up by guests who then asked if there was more - sadly, there was not. Didn't have sour cream so I used greek yogurt, left out the celery and cucumber, doubled all the spices (except salt - I think I forgot to use any) and doubled the lemon juice as suggested by other reviewers. Added some cilantro. Will definitely make again. Very easy to whip up.

Curry is new ingredient to me. I followed directions and suggestions but thought it was just 'eh. I used as a veggie dip.

Very nice, different....Definitely make a day ahead of time. I added red peppers and a splash of lemon juice to brighten the flavor.

Tried this yesterday. It was OK but took some doctoring. I added a BUNCH more of Curry & another squeeze of lemon... like maybe another 2 teaspoons of curry. Like others mentioned, it does look like Egg Salad. I'll try adding red bell to it next time but will definitely try it again. Maybe even try using canned Curry Paste. Curry POWDER tends to have a bit of a granular texture. Serves well with Naan bread as well as veggies.

I recently made this dip for a ladies party and after tasting it, I doubled the recipe. I did not add the celery or salt, but instead substituted celery salt. I also did not add the cucumber. I upped the amount of curry powder. Everyone loved it. My husband, who has been eating the party left-overs, has requested that I make this all the time so he can dip his veggies for a snack. This is so good, I will also thin it with milk to use as a salad dressing and will serve it cold over fish. Make it!

Agree with the other reviewer that this looked exactly like an egg salad, in fact, I have a recipe for curried deviled eggs too! Delicious. My kids loved it. I served it with steak and omitted the cucumbers, only because I didn't have one, and it was still delicious. Served leftovers with fish sticks for my kids the next day.

Great veggie dip! I substituted plain yogurt for mayo (since I don't like mayo) and it went really well with the curry seasoning. I also did not include the chopped celery or cukes in the dip. Great flavor.

I have made this twice, and it's been a huge hit each time. The only thing I don't love about it is the color...described as slightly "egg-salad colored" by some honest tasters. I did add some diced red bell pepper the second time to give it more color. Make at least one day ahead! Definitely a keeper.

A total hit! Absolutely delicious. I veganized it, using soy based cream cheese and sour cream, and eggless mayonnaise. I made it a day ahead, and left out the celery and cucumber. I served it with roasted sweet potato wedges. The sweet/curry combo was fantastic.

This was quite good. I followed the reviews and made it several hours ahead which was smart. I added lemon zest and topped it with chopped, dried cranberries.

I really like this recipe; it tastes great with chips and with raw or blanched veggies. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND making it the day before serving - it tastes so much better when the flavors have had a chance to blend.

This is my standard dip for veggies. Make sure to let it chill for a few hours before serving.

I also left out the cucumber since I was serving cucumber with my crudites. Delish.

Good dip. Definitely let it sit overnight.

Everyone loved as the dressing and veggies were gone. I did not add the chopped celery or cucumber as well because I wanted it for a veggie dip. Very tasty though a bit thicker than the standard 'ranch' dressing consistency. May loosen it up a bit next time with a bit milk.

Fabulous dip! Omitted the cucumber and celery and served with a tray of fresh veggies (the usual suspects) and also fresh fruit - chunks of pineapple, cantaloupe and honeydew as well as wedges of pear, apple, peach, apricots and papaya. The savoury curry flavour was a wonderful complement for the sweet fruit. Will definitely make again and again! Cheers!

Yummy - I made it with lime juice and low-fat mayo/cream cheese. Delicious.

This was a big hit at a recent family gathering. The only substitution I made was adding red bell pepper instead of the celery. I would make this one again.

This dip was wonderful! I left out the scallions and cucumbers and just served it with crudites. I also used a jamaican curry powder which gave it a great flavor.

I took this dip to a potluck today and it got rave reviews. If I had rated this recipe the day I made it I would given it a 1 instead of a 4, because it was bland and bad, but after letting it sit in the fridge for a day, the flavors melded and it turned out wonderful! I think the people who rated it badly must've served it the same day.

We like things spicy around our house, and this seemed bland even with the curry. We added habanero and red amazon chili pepper and it was fantastic!

Disappointing. It didn't have enough kick or taste and I had leftovers.

If you haven't tried Trader Joe's Mayonnaise Dressing -- give it a go. No fat, no cholesterol, low salt. It works well in all my recipes, and tastes wonderful in salads or on sandwiches.

I've made this several times now... it is wonderful. I have learned that you can make this recipe with fat-free sour cream and fat-free cream cheese and it turns out just as good! I still used the full-fat mayo, but everything else was fat free! I love it!

Easy, versatile and yummy. I used Key Lime juice instead of lemon for a more tropical feel. Served with pita, hummus, veggies and chips.

Aa very tasty dip for crackers, vegetables, whatever. As a meatless person, I appreciate anything out of the ordinary and really like the curry taste.

It's a killer. I really love curry flavor with the cream cheese. I found you can mix different curry's (sweet, mild or spicy) to get a very different taste each time. This way you can adjust it for the items you are serving with it(veggies, different breads, crackers or fruits).

I thought this recipe was a wonderful addition to any party. Keep the recipes coming.
