Pretty good but I would cut out all or at least most of the sherry vinegar. The pearl oyster bar tarter sauce is wonderful and should stand mostly on it's own in this dish. Three stars for the way it is written, next time I'll cut out the vinegar and maybe it will be worth four.

Mmmmm. A perfect classic slaw with a twist. I used much more cabbage than 4 cups. Probably 8. It tasted divine after sitting for 4 hours in the fridge to marinate. It paired very will with smoked brisket slow cooked in Basic BBQ Sauce (Epicurious April 2008).

The best cole slaw ever. I use angel hair cabbage. I grew up on my grandmothers handmade - hand shredded coleslaw. Granny would be jealous.

I'm a huge -- and picky -- coleslaw fan. What makes this recipe so exceptional is indeed that Pearl Oyster Bar Tartar Sauce, which adds a lot of sophistication without at all spoiling the casual / sloppy joy that IS coleslaw. Awesome! I had this with NC-style pork barbecue (no tomato sauce) -- and it was messy divine! I even used light mayo with no damage that I could discern.

I've been looking for a creamy coleslaw recipe that replicates my mother's for 30 years, and this not only comes close, but is actually better, because of the Pearl Oyster Bar Tartar Sauce.

This was delicious and beautiful. Well, I added a shredded/ julienned carrot too, for color. I'm so sick of runny yukky cole slaw. THis was refreshing and crisp and yummy. Delicious as a side dish or on sandwiches. Simple enough to make to bring to a B-B-Q.
