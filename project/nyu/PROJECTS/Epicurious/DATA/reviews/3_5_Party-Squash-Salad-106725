In addition to being fairly tasty, it also presents well. A photo of the prepared dish: http://campl.us/dgjNL0XenBs

This was great for a picnic in the park. Tossed it just before eating, but let the squashes marinate for over an hour. Added a little extra olive oil. Omitted the parsley (allergic to it), but did add some leftover grilled flat iron steak, which tasted great.

I love this salad! I used my vegetables from my csa food share, it was so fresh and delicious. I added chickpeas, scapes and scallions. I will definitely make this again!

This was beautiful and very fresh tasting. Served at an outdoor baby shower with tea sandwiches. Was very easy with a mandoline to slice squash thin and evenly. I put over a bed of baby spinach and sliced cherry tomatoes. Sprinkled cheese over the top. I also added a lttle red wine vinegar to dressing.

Excellent and lovely. I made this dish for twelve at our backyard BBQ and added two tablespoons chopped fresh garlic and used only one large bunch of arugula. It was perfectly delicious and a crowd pleaser.
