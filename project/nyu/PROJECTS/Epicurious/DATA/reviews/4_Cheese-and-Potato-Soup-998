I needed to serve a hearty meal that I could make the day before our annual Groundhog Day celebration. I made Sauerkraut w/ Polish Sausage (Epicurious - Bon Appetit/Sept 1995), as written for our main course, (I opted for the gin vs. juniper berries) and it was perfection! For a starter I made the Cheese & Potato Soup. Folks were asking for seconds on everything. I did add a little more potato to the existing soup recipe and served it sprinkled with crumbled bacon. German rye bread from a European shop and hot and cold apple cider rounded out our meal. Ill definitely be making this menu again  easy and delish!

OMG. WOW. Panera who? I made this soup to use up leftover holiday ham - and potato/cheddar soup is a a favorite of my boyfriends. I typically don't comment on recipes but I just had to with this one. Excellent. I used TWO large potatoes and felt it was the PERFECT amount. This will be a staple in our house. Never again will I BUY a canned cheese & potato soup!

Rating: 3
Outstanding! I too sauteed the veggies in butter, and I pureed them in the food processor with chicken broth before adding the diced potatoes & milk. Definitely need to increase the potatoes; I used 4 good sized potatoes. It needs salt & pepper, but the Tabasco is also a nice touch. Will make again.

This is one of my family's favorites. I double the potatoes and saute the vegetables in butter, not oil. For the meat, I use chunks of prosciutto. I've tried blending the soup to make it smooth and keeping it in small chunks. The chunky way is preferred by us all.

I made this soup last night and my family loved it! Note, I made a few changes after reading the reviews: double the veggies and saute them in butter, not veg oil (added a couple cloves of garlic too); bacon instead of ham; used Tillamook Vintage White Sharp Cheddar, which tastes fab and makes the soup a really pretty cream color; if the soup is too thick, just add a litte milk at the end of the process; lastly, the suggested shot of hot sauce as a garnish is great. Yum!!!

This is a GREAT basic recipe for cheese & potato soup. However, you are the cook and you have to take taste matters into your own hands and spice it up! It definitely needed some extra potatoes, like the previous reviewers suggested. I added bacon & turkey sausage that I cooked to a nice golden brown. It was a super tasty soup & a really easy stand-by recipe for leftover produce you probably have lying around.

This is one of my "go-to" soup recipes. I increase the potatoes and instead of ham I sprinkle bacon over the top when serving. I also put it through the food processor before adding the cheese so it is a smooth soup. Bits of carrot are still visible but it's oh so yummy. Love this recipe because it's simple and always delicious.

Excellent soup! Cooked a chopped, half pound of bacon beforehand (sprinkled it over the soup later) and used some of the grease to cook the veggies. Did 1 cup 2% milk and 1 cup cream for the milk portion. Feeds the soul!

I made this last night--delicious! I sauteed the veggies in a little butter/olive oil, with the addition of 2 large garlic cloves. I increased the sharp cheddar to 7-8 oz. I forgot the ham, but will try it again with that, and I think bacon would be delicious too. Perfect for a cold evening with snow on the way--again.

It's true, this soup is so good it will lift your mood and make you feel better while you are making it. All that has been said about how food directly effects your health is true, don't doubt it for a second. I made a double batch and plan to freeze most for later. Used all organic produce and used Turkey bacon instead of ham. I think some cauliflower and broccoli would be a welcome edition to the next batch. Very tasty! A++

My husband and I were depressed. We were down and mopey and needed some rich, creamy comfort food. Preferably, rich, creamy comfort food that helped us eat down the 20lbs of potatoes we got for $3. This fit the bill perfectly. A couple of adaptions people might enjoy: 1. Ask your spouse to chop all the vegetables. This is a lovely adaption that works with lots of different recipes! 2. We had Polish Kielbasa and my husband does not like ham, so we chopped up the whole package and dumped it in. Plus, it was the pork kielbasa and not the turkey that I usually get. Mmmmm... 3. If I'm making a creamy soup, I like to saute my veggies in BUTTER. 4. If anyone is wondering, "Hey, can I throw my leftover mashed potatoes in this to thicken it and get rid of them because leftover mashed potatoes are nasty?" THE ANSWER IS YES. 5. The corn idea sounded lovely and I was fully intending to do it, but I forgot, what will all the lovely sausage clouding my brain. :c 6. My brilliant husband suggested a bay leaf. Apparently he has learned to cook! 7. At this point, the cheese was completely unnecessary. I put it in anyway. And now everyone thinks I am Paula Dean. It was SO GOOD, though. :D

I was missing potato-cheese and came upon this. My very Italian husband and kids really enjoyed it (even my 4-yr old who thinks she doesn't like cheese.) We don't have cheddar here so I used a local aged "Toma" cheese. I doubled the veggies as was suggested but did half onion and half leek. We're not fans of cooked ham so I used lightly smoked pancetta and left it in. What a nice flavor. Very filling and good comfort food! This is a keeper!

I've made this soup twice, and it was excellent each time. Like others, I doubled the veggies (didn't have celery either time, added chopped cauliflower the second and skipped the potato). The first time, I used chicken broth; the second time I used veggie broth. Both were great, but I think the chicken broth was more aligned with how I feel the soup *should* taste. For the first version, I used cheddar, but I couldn't find cheddar the second time, so I used a mix of Cantal and Comté. It was good, but not as sharp and flavorful as the excellent English cheddar I can usually get. I haven't used ham at all, but I'd like to try it with bacon someday. I'll definitely be making this soup for years to come, in all sorts of variations!

Deeelish! I made this for "Soup Group" at work, so I had to triple the recipe. I did revise it a bit though: I added a few cloves of garlic to the veggie sauté, and some corn. I used half and half instead of milk, and a combination of shallots and leeks instead of onions. I substituted Yukon Gold potatoes for the russets, and had bacon out as a topping instead of the ham. Everyone in the group asked for the recipe - it got rave reviews!

Rating: 4
This was really really good! Because I needed to serve more than this makes, I doubled it. I also used 4 large russets, I like this type of soup a little thick. Instead of the ham, I sauteed 4 slices of bacon, reserving the bacon to crumble on top the soup. I used extra sharp Vermont cheddar and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk. Once cooked enough, I used my emulsion blender to break up big pieces of vegetables and smooth out the texture a little bit. This is THE best cheese & potato soup I've ever made and the taste is right on. Just use really good cheese.

This soup has been a real big hit with my 12 year old; she has asked for it 4 times now. Homemade stock from bones, not canned broth, will make this recipe much tastier. We dump in extra cheese until it's almost too thick to stir, and use turkey ham instead of regular. Very good leftover.

Delicious! I just made this and my boyfriend had three bowls! I started off with crisping two strips of bacon, then removing them, then adding a little oil and double the amount of carrots, celery and onions. And I used red potatoes instead of Russet, and they were soft, but held their shape. I used Vermont Cheddar, aged two years- my fav, and I omitted the ham and crumbled the bacon over top when serving. Definitely a keeper, will make again and again.

Very easy and REALLY delicious! This is a great soup for a cold winter evening. I made it as stated, but substituted the ham for bacon, and just used a little crumbled on the top.

This was an excellent, easy recipe to make. I used bacon and then sauteed the veggies (plus garlic) in the drippings. I didn't have milk so I substituted additional chicken stock which worked fine. Rather than tobasco I added a bit of sriracha. Basically, I adjusted the recipe to what I had on hand and it was delicious. My husband was very impressed!

This was excellent when I used some suggestions from other reviewers. In place of the milk, I used 1 c. skim and 1 c. reduced fat buttermilk. I used 1/2 c. parmesan reggiano and 1/2 c. colby in place of the chedar and increased the ham to 1 cup. I didn't bother with the tabasco or parsley and after I added the ham, I used the immersion blender to roughly blend, keeping some chunks in. My entire family, including 4 kids, loved every drop!

Omitted celery and instead of onion I used onion powder (not a fan of either). I basically doubled the meat, carrots, herbs (also using rosemary and thyme), potatoes, and used 6 oz of cheese.

I thought this was excellent and easy to mix up and could have unlimited varities.

My husband and I thought this soup was quite tasty. I didn't add celery because I don't like the taste. I added some garlic and pureed part of the soup just before adding the ham, like many others suggested. Next time I would add more cheese and potatoes, and try it with bacon. Overall it was very fast and easy to make. I didn't think that it tasted as good when I reheat it a day later. It seemed a little grainy, so eat it all the first day!

I made this tonight for the first time, exactly as specified (plus some garlic), except I doubled it. I tasted it prior to the final seasoning, and it was looking and tasting to be fantastic! But without much thought, I added the Tabasco. I have cooked for many years, and I knew the heat level I wanted, so shake-shake-shake...AAaarrrghhh! Wow, that just ruined the flavor! I know this will be really good next time. NO Tabasco. I will add jalapenos or serranos instead and it will be delicious.

Great soup for this chilly, rainy spring day. I also doubled up the soup, adding a clove of garlic to the veggie mix. For the stock, I used some homemade chicken stock that I had reconstituted some dried porcini mushrooms in (just happened to have that on hand). I used a bit of buttermilk as part of the milk amount. I also pureed the soup prior to adding cheese as previous reviewers suggested. Sprinkled bacon over the top along with a snipet of chive. Served with salad and crusty rosemary potato bread. Delish

Wish I had stuck with my gut and made the regular amount of the recipe instead of doubling it. None of us were thrilled with this at all, even after a day or two. Very bland taste and funny texture.

This was sooo yummy! After reading all the helpful suggestions in the reviews, I decided to add 2 chopped garlic cloves, 1/2 cup diced red bellpepper, and 1/2 a fresh jalepeno, diced. Corn sounded like it would've gone well with the diced red pepper and jalepeno, but I was out. I also didn't have ham, but a few recipes claimed not to have missed it. When my meat lovin' honey found out it was missing ham he was disappointed, but when he tasted it said he didn't even miss it flavor wise and the only thing he thought that could've made it better was clams. I think he believes any chowder soup should have some chewy clams in it, but it seems like that would've been a little too much though. I think I'd keep the recipe as I tweaked it, but next time add some canned corn - and of course double or triple it now that I know it's this good!

What a great recipe. Easy to make, hard to mess up. I planned on doubling the recipe like so many people suggested, but discovered we had run out of milk once I got to that part of the recipe. Since it was snowing I didn't want to run out to get milk. I put in a good splash of half and half (maybe a half cup? - a far cry from the 4 cups needed for the doubled recipe!) and it came out just great! My boyfriend even said I should write a book with all my recipes. Little does he know my epicurious secret... You can also use whatever cheese you have around. I had some bacon horseradish cheddar (I know - it sounds weird) already opened so I put that in and it was really good! I plan on buying all the ingredients and making a quadruple recipe for our friends this weekend at the ski condo in Vermont. It's so warm and hearty...mmmm.

This soup was so easy to make; I can't believe how delicious it was. The only changes I made were to scantly double the recipe and then I pureed a third of the soup before adding the cheese and ham. By scantly double I mean that while I used 4 cups of broth I only used 3 cups of milk and 2 russet potatoes so some measurements were double and some were more like 1 and a hlaf times the amount called for. I didn't have tabasco so I sprinkled a little cayenne instead. It couldn't have been easier and quick to make but the results were impressive. I'd definitely make it for company too. I was expecting a slightly thickish soup but the consistency was superb. Do yourself a favor and make some on a cold day. It's sure to please.

Ok . . . I changed this recipe quite a bit and made it extremely decadent . . . but my kids and my husband LOVED it! I changed the name to "cream of potato soup with cheddar and bacon"--not very original, I know. I started with frying 3 slices of bacon, chopped. I removed the bacon with a slotted spoon and then in the bacon grease (about 2 Tablespoons), I sauteed the stated vegetables and thyme and also added 3 chopped cloves of garlic. I felt that the soup would thicken with only 2 Tablespoons of flour (3 seemed a little much--afterall a roux is made with equal parts of fat to flour). I used whole milk and roasted garlic chicken stock and 2 large russet potatoes. After the potato was tender, I pureed the soup with my imersion blender until smooth, then added the cheddar. Seasoned with about 8 dashes of tabasco, kosher salt and white pepper. I did not use the ham. Served with a sprinkle of chopped parsley and the reserved crumbled bacon.

I have never made soup from scratch and this was very easy to make and very yummy. My husband called dibbs on all the left overs so he could take them to work for lunches. I did add 1/3 cup more cheese. Only because we love cheese. I'll be making this soup for a holiday party i'm going to. I know it will be a hit. It sure was with my family.

To make this a wonderful low fat cream soup I used skim milk and fat free chicken broth. I used regular sharp cheddar cheese because if you make it totally fat free, it wouldn't taste good! Even if you ate a quarter of the pot of this soup, you would only be eating 1 ounce of cheese. Instead of adding ham to the soup, I passed around real bacon bits for anyone to sprinkle on top of their indivual bowl (or not). I didn't have fresh parsley so I substituted fresh frozen chives.

YUM! This was a keeper. My insanely picky husband liked it, too. I omited the ham and hot pepper sauce and used poultry seasoning--a whole teaspoon--since I didn't have thyme.

The only thing I will do differently next time is double the amounts and transfer the mixture to a pot before adding the liquids. Then we can enjoy some leftovers!

I was looking for a cheese and broccoli soup, and thought this might work. I replaced the celery and carrots with broccoli instead, didn't use the ham, and used an aged gouda (and a little more than called for). All in all it turned out pretty well...not quite as creamy as I would have liked, but that just needs a little more experimentation, and maybe a touch of cream, or some whole milk instead of 1%...

I loved this soup. I made the following modifications: I fried bacon in the bottom of the saucepan, set aside the bacon for later, and drained off most of the fat. I reserved a bit and cooked the vegetables in that. The bacon was used in place of the ham. SOOOOO Yummy. I switched a bit of the milk for cream. Be sure to salt and pepper this liberally.

Excellent soup, and very easy, too! Used bacon instead of ham and it turned out great. Definitely double the recipe.

Have used this recipe several times and always get rave reviews, it's the best potato cheese soup recipe I've ever found. I would suggest that if you're going to go to the effort of all that chopping and shredding you should double the recipe (original only serves 4 at most). It won't take much longer and you'll definitely want leftovers (which taste even better.)

I made this soup for a baby shower for my sister. I was the hit of the party. I've had several people call me for the recipe.

This was so easy and SO delicious! I replaced one cup of the chicken broth with ham stock, and it added a lot of flavor. This was so good that I made another batch right away to freeze and enjoy later!

I thought this would go great with my Easter meal. We all really liked it, that's includes my kids. It reminded me of a New England clam chowder.

I am not an accomplished cook, so I appreciate recipes that are easy to follow. This was *so* easy... served it up to my family as part of a St. Patty's day dinner. I garnished with turkey bacon bits and chopped green onion.

This was so good. And easy. I didn't add the cheese & ham at the end -- the soup was so good without them. I'm going to make this again & again.

Simplicity at it's best. At first glance I would not have made this recipe, but I was desperate to find new dishes for leftover ham. Was hesitant because I'm not much of fan of potato in soups. However, decided to double recipe and just used the one potato. Delicious! Next time for presentation I think some crumbled bacon with some green onions will be a nice touch although just perfect the way it is. It's a keeper.

If you are looking for something with zip, this is not the soup for you. If you want a warm creamy comfort food you should make this soup. My husband loved it. I also used bacon, we did't have any ham, and it was wonderful. I think I put in too many potatos because it got very thick. I just added more broth and milk and it was so yummy. I also added a little asiago cheese. Served it with fresh homemade butter buns and had a meal that took me back to my childhood. A real keeper. My girlfriend is making it on Thursday. I'll get her to tell you how her family likes it. Happy cooking! ~Naomi

The first time I made this recipe, I substituted bacon for the ham, and used the drippings instead of the vegetable oil, adding the crumbled bacon bits later in the preparation. The soup was delicious - a big hit with my guests. It's a perfect, savory winter time comfort food. - oh...and I substituted half and half for the milk! Admittedly, an artery clogger, but I only make it on special occasions.

I used leftover ham from Christmas. I loved this soup so much that I am going to make several batches so I can freeze it and have it whenever I get a craving. By the way, the carrots and potatoes look colorful and appealing.

This soup was delicious! We used parmesan instead of cheddar and the result was quite tasty--so thanks to the reviewer who suggested that this would be ok. My husband and I were given a 7 pound ham (it's just the 2 of us), and we've been trying desperately to use the thing up, so we put in about 2 cups of ham chunks. Our version was more like a ham and cheese chowder. We'll definately make this again. I happened to time it, and the time from raw ingredients to eating soup was 45 minutes.

The best potato soup I have ever made!!! Quick and Easy. What a great comfort food....

I was looking for a comfort dish on a cold rainy day and this hit the spot. Very easy to prepare and had a wonderful mix of flavors. I added mushrooms and broccoli to the list of veggies and used a sweet potato as well as few small russets. Will certainly make again!

This is a very flavorful and creamy soup. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I added parmesean and it was tasty! I made homemade croutons and sprinkled them on the soup, good comfort food.

So simple to prepare! I used three large red potatoes and omitted the ham. I didn't have enough milk (typical college student) so I used 1/2c. skim milk, 1/4c. cream and 1/2c. reduced-fat sour cream. My sorority sisters loved it too!

This recipe is excellent! Made this for a group of people, everyone loved it! I used aged cheddar cheese (24 months) cost more but worth the taste. Made this several times.

This is a great recipe. It is very versitile, you can add and delete to suit your tastes! Try adding fresh clams (cooked them first) and add bacon for a GREAT HOMEMADE version of clam chowder!

Perfect for that left-over Easter ham! I did not deviate from the recipe at all and found it hearty and delicious. The Tabasco is a must!

Went the bacon and extra potato route suggested by other reviewers -- and didn't measure precisely when adding cheese ("lots" is a good standard. Everyone loved.

I made this recipe but left out the celery, carrots and ham, and added extra potatoes. I also added about a cup of chopped broccoli during the last few minutes of cooking the potatoes. I garnished with shredded cheddar cheese and bacon bits. It was wonderful! I'll definitely make this again.

The soup was yummy, but I did increase the amount of cheese, potatos and ham by almost double. Would have been a little bland without doing that. Plus I just love lots of potatos in my soup.

Made 1st batch yesterday, kids finished it off before it got to the dinner table! Doubled the batch today and added cumin, garlic powder and white pepper. Used 1/2 milk and cream, yellow cheddar and Black Diamond white cheddar. This one's a keeper!

This soup is wonderful. I tripled the recipe and used six potatoes which gave it a nice hearty texture. I also used bacon instead of ham and garnished each bowl with some bacon and chives. It made a very nice presentation!

This was pretty good for a cold January evening. I thought it could have been a bit tastier, it was a bit bland. But quick enough to make after work. I recommend adding more potatoes than the recipe calls for.

This is a great way to use leftover ham. I used a good white cheddar and fresh thyme and whole milk. Very satisfying on a cold, rainy San Francisco night.

I thought this soup was extremely delicious without being overly cheesy. I recommend making a double or triple recipe, since the soup freezes extremely well and makes a great quick winter dinner with a salad and some sourdough bread. A big winner!

I made this soup to use up the leftover ham from Christmas dinner. My family loved this soup. I added chopped broccoli, used cream instead of milk and made a large pot. It was wonderful.

This made a great dinner with garlic bread. I would make this again. I left out the carrots and added more potato and it was still really good.

JUST NEEDED TO ADD MORE POTATOES, & DELETED THE HAM. I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS TO FRIENDS & FAMILY.

This soup is so good and so simple. I made a couple changes to make it vegetarian by omiting the ham and using a homemade vegetable broth. I also added an additional potato (potato soup with only 1 potato just didn't seem right!). I needed to thin it with a little water today for leftovers as it's a pretty thick soup. It's very hearty - just some crusty bread rounded out a filling weekday dinner on a cold and snowy Minnesota night. Next time I'd double the recipe as the leftovers are delicious but scarce!

I have been using this recipe since Bon Appetit published it in 1995. It is EASY & tastes wonderful. The only changes I've made is that I grate the carrots, chop/dice the celery & potato- alot, & have omitted the tobasco. I also use chicken base for the broth. It's great & kids like it!

Excellent recipe. I used half-and-half instead of milk and 4 strips of crumbled bacon instead of the ham. Superb -- my guests LOVED it and all want the recipe.

I loved this soup!! I used bacon instead of ham and also used regular chicken broth. It's a great autumn recipe.

Really great recipe. I used half and half instead of milk, though, and I used higher grade cheese. I also didn't use the low-salt broth, as I think I'd have probably ended up dumping a bunch of salt in. I made it for many so I tripled the recipe ... looking forward to having it for lunch tomorrow, and I think it would probably freeze well too.

Excellent soup. Easy and quick enough for a weeknight and also quite elegant and rich. I would not change it in any way. Leftovers make a great lunch the next day!!

Great soup and easy to prepare! I also substituted about 6 pieces of smoked bacon plus drippings, used 2 cups sharp cheese, 2 crushed cloves garlic, added about 2 tablespoons parmesan cheese, but couldn't find any sherry at the store (bummer!) and also used the half-n-half, but left out the carots. Maybe try chopped cilantro next time instead of parsley ... I will put a plastic cover on this recipe card, as will definitely be using this one again!

THIS SOUP IS ULTIMATE 'COMFORT FOOD', AND A DELICIOUS WARM-UP FOR A MINNESOTA WINTER DAY. I ELIMINATED THE THYME, AND ADDED 1 TSP. CURRY INSTEAD. ALSO FAT FREE HALF AND HALF WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR MILK FOR A RICHER (BUT LOW FAT) CONSISTENCY.

I may have used inferior cheddar cheese because is coagulated and wasn't visually appealing - the taste was good though if you like thyme.

Very good soup. I also used bacon instead of ham, increased the potatoes and onions and ommitted the celery and carrots. The whole process took me an hour and a half which was a bit longer than I anticipated but the soup was great.

I have to revise my opinion of this recipe! My husband & I had the leftovers today & it was totally delicious. Real comfort food as we are both fighting off 'flu symptoms. I guess it just needed to sit overnight for the flavours to meld & intensify. I will make it again, but this time will make it a day ahead & not attempt to eat it on day one.

This is the best potato soup recipe I've tried! I made a few changes: I diced four pieces of bacon, sauted & removed from pot, then sauted the vegetables in 1 T. of the drippings. Before adding the cheese I pureed half the soup with a stick blender (not necessary but I have to disguise onions and celery from my four year old). I left out the ham and then topped the soup with the bacon and parsley. Next time I'll double it so I can stash some in the freezer!

This soup was delicious! a definite do-over! I ommitted the ham and tabasco sauce and instead added 2 crushed cloves of garlic. Also since I didn't have canned chicken broth handy I added 2 cups of chicken soup and 2 cups of water. The result was fantastic - everyone wanted seconds!

Thank you this was fabulous! I had a good portion of SCALLOP POTATO with CHEESE & ONION leftovers and was trying to figure out what else do with them besides warm them up. I increased the celery, carrot, onion, added a little jalapeno pepper and leftover honey baked spiral ham, yummy! This was a hit with my family and they want to have it again, soon!

Good, but not great. I added a little chipotle pepper which added great smokiness and a little heat. I also threw in some parmesan for added flavor. I had to add alot of salt, so I'm not sure why you should use the low sodium chicken broth. I think using more chicken broth and less milk could increase the flavor also. At any rate, garnishes could bump this soup up from three to four forks -- try crumbled bacon, jalapeno peppers, crusty croutons, chopped tomato, or a drizzle of tabasco.

This is a great soup to make for Sunday supper- easy and satisfying. I used more veggies and it was very good-even my 12 yr old ate it up!

Rating: 3
A really delicious find! I didn't have parsley on hand, so right before the potatoes were done, I added a small handful of finely chopped broccoli for color, although it also added variation to the texture! I knew my guests were pretty hearty eaters, so I added a little extra ham, as well. This is such a good recipe for adding or omitting to suit individual tastes... and so easy, too. I can't wait to try it again.

This was not only an excellent, but economical, recipe to make. We substituted fresh thyme, and added rosemary, majoram and garlic to the recipe. We noticed using salted ham did away with the need for additional salt.

Excellent! Being a vegetarian I left out the ham and the recipe was still delicious. If it wasn't so high in calories I would have licked the pan clean.

This is really good! I increased the celery, carrot and onion to ¾ c. each, and used 2% milk and reduced-fat cheddar. We didn't miss the extra fat at all; the soup was still rich and satisfying. Increase the quantity if you're serving four, unless they're very delicate eaters. My husband and I finished the pot in one meal.
