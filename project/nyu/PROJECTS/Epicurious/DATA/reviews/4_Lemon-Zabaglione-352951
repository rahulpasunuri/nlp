This was wonderful with grilled peaches. 8 minutes cooking time is right. I kept whisking and would take it off the boiler and keep whisking. I would keep if off the boiler from 1/3rd to about half the time.

I've made this twice and have found it easy and pretty quick making a great treat. It can be devoured in many ways, my favorite being over berrys.

The best Zabaglione I have ever made or eaten. I did not have the suggested wine and so I used my used available Chardonnay - it is abosolutely wonderful - the taste and texture are exceptional. This is a "keeper" in my recipe file. NancyR

I was grilling some peaches and realized that we had no vanilla ice cream to go with it, so I whipped this up using orange instead of lemon and using Splenda instead of sugar. It came out great and my wife and daughter were pleased. The Muscat wine was a touch that I would never have considered before. There was some leftover, so I refrigerated it to go over some berries tonight. :)
