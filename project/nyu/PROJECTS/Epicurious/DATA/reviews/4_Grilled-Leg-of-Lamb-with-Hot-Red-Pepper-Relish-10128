This is a recipe that is frequently requested by friends and family. The lamb is good, but something about the relish makes it so excellent--even people who claim they don't like lamb love this when I make it. I recommend making the relish in advance--allowing the flavors to blend makes all the difference. I've been making it for years, just never got around to writing a review. Time consuming but worth the effort!

I am rating the relish because I've not actually tried the lamb. I use another - Grilled Lemon and Garlic Leg of Lamb on this site, which is also 4 stars. When I first made this relish 8 years ago, I missed noting that I was to cook it! It was delicious. Next time I did cook it and it tasted like our family's favorite purchased Pepper Relish. But this year I decided to try it au naturale again. Left the peppers and onions in the vinaigrette over night and drained it to accompany the lamb. Everyone loved it!

I made this dish for a formal dinner party a few days ago. Served with steamed green beans and roasted creamer potatoes, tossed with parsley, olive oil, salt & pepper. The relish is what makes this dish special. The flavors in the relish blend perfectly with the marinade for the meat. Without the relish, the meat is good, but not spectacular. All the relish was consumed.

This was really good. My husband raves about the relish...I admit I won't eat it, as I detest bell peppers. I probably wouldn't make it again since I eat lamb so rarely, and I'd most likely want to try another recipe, just for fun.

This was excellent, although living in Canada, I was unable to barbeque the lamb as it was too cold outside, and used the oven instead. The relish was delicious and we had the left-over relish with roast chicken the next day. When the snow finally melts and it warms up a bit, I will try it on the barbeque. Great recipe.

Just made the grilled lamb, which was spectacular. However, do not recommend the relish, which although good, is superfluous, as the lamb is so delicious. The relish was almost a distraction.

This recipe is GREAT. I have made it several times since 1995 and it always gets rave reviews, with or without the relish. At least one person asks for the recipe. To me that is success! You have to grill it outside for the full flavor.

Like the previous reviewer, we thought the lamb was good but the relish was better. We had enough to serve with grilled pork tenderloin the next evening, which was a bit hit with our guests. It's a terrific versatile recipe and one that I'll make again.

The lamb was good, but what really makes the dish sing is the relish. It is absolutely outstanding and very easy to make. Dont' shortchange your tastebuds-make the whole thing!

Excellent recipe! I served this to guests last weekend along with Quinoa & Grilled Pepper Salad BA 7/2000. We stated with Golden Autumn Soup and finished with Fresh Raspberry Cream Tart BA 3/2002. Wonderful menu. I only had 8 hours to marinate the meat and the flavors came through beautifully. What really makes the presentation and satifies the taste buds is the relish!! It is fantastic. It took about 2 hours to simmer it to 3 cups but I was cooking other things so it was not a time consumer on it's own. It is such a blend of sweet and sour. Last night I served the relish with salmon. A keeper recipe.

Excellent. Though I just now noted that the relish was to be cooked! However, it was perfect otherwise for the following week (refrigerated)as a substitute for the bottled varieties on hamburgers, etc. offering a fresh complementary crunch.

Add another 4 forks for a great lamb recipe. It was easy and received raves. Will make again next week. And,yes, I cut down the relish amount and it was just right. Thanks for the tip.

I followed previous suggestions of only making 1/2 the relish recipe. I used most of it up for 6 people. Everyone loved it. The lamb turned out well - thanks to hubby on the bbq.

I have made this receipe twice now, and it has been wonderful both times. I would make 1/2 of the relish. There is a lot left over. I marinated the lamb overnight, and it is excellent. However, be careful grilling the lamb, watch for burning.

Excellent recipe, but I agree with earlier reviewer - way too much relish.

This was very tasty. I cooked it for a dinner party. Ironically I had to people who rarely eat meat who must have eaten a pound a piece. A very sophistacated and elegant dish. I definitely recommend you marinate overnight and make the relish early.

I used a lean top round of lamb, which I broiled to sear and then roasted to perfection! Wonderful marinade and relish accompaniment.This meal was well rounded off with a salad, roasted potatoes, and a good bourdeaux.

Used this recipe for Father's Day, turned out great. I grilled the lamb using a rotisserie. The meat was tender and very flavorful. The relish is wonderful. Only thing I would do is make about half as much relish as the recipe calls for...made way to much.

I prepared this dish for Easter, it was a hit with the family. I however, am a huge fan of Lamb. The relish is a wonderful accompaniment, and goes great with other dishes as well. The relish should definately be prepared at least a day ahead of time to give the vinegar a chance to tone down.
