I will make it again but not according to this recipe. I've never heard parsnips cooking in 15-20' and of course they didn't. They need 40-45'. Other than that, I didn't have sage so roasted them with honey as usual. It was worth the try but I have to roast them an extra 15' tomorrow!

No need to chop the sage. Whole roasted sage leaves tossed in olive oil are wonderful!

Just scrub those parsnips with a stiff vegetable brush, then chop them up in equal size pieces -- (why discard the core?) Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic (powder) ... and try CUMIN or CURRY POWDER! then roast per the recipe. I do this with carrots and cauliflower too, so good.

Super easy and very delicious. Be careful not to over-roast (although even then, you get delicious parsnip chips!).
