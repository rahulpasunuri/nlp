Very good and easy curry recipe. I followed the suggestions and added one can of coconut milk and one can of diced tomatoes. When almost done I added some cooked green beans and a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed in a little milk. I am not sure I liked the lemon juice and next time would add just one tablespoon. I also mixed mild and hot curry powder and added one small sliced Padilla chili. Tonight we are having the leftovers with some cooked potato or cauliflower mixed in. Very yummy!

As many others before me, I loved this recipe. I did tweak it a little as follows: Instead of whole milk I used canned coconut milk which I think gave it a deeper and more interesting flavor. I used canned tomatoes in juice and used Major Gray Mango chutney (its what I had). It wss perfect. This dish tastes better than the sum of all it's parts and it is definately one I will make many times again. I think it would be fabulous with lamb stew meat too!

This recipe was delicious! I subbed the coconut milk for whole milk, apricot preserves for the chutney, canned crushed tomatoes and ginger rather than fresh. It was beautiful, very easy to assemble and I cannot wait to make it for my extended family who adore curry!!!

Delicious! MAde some changes though. Didn't have tumeric; instead I added soy a sauce tamari and fish sauce for taste. It tasted awesome. Cooked for almost 3 hours and the meat was so tender. I cut up cilantro after it was cooked and made it even better. Instead of chutney I put peach preserve. Would definitely make this again!

This recipe is AMAZING! I also made a few changes. Swapped light coconut milk for the reg milk, and added a large can diced tomatoes & its juice for the tomatoes. Everything else was the same, do take the time to grate fresh ginger, One other change is near the end of the cooking time I add a jar of cut up fresh mango to add a beautiful new color element. So good! Thankfully I have the best curry ever from a trip to Sri Lanka. Will buy more from an Indian grocery store when this is gone. Look for one of those stores to get the better curry, it really makes a difference. Today I am mixing pork with the beef, can't wait to try it! This recipe is divine!

This curry is very delicious for how simple it is to make. Will be making it again. Yum! For those who like spicy consider a pepper alongside those onions.

I make this almost weekly. It's definitely a family favorite. I modify it a bit, partly because my son is allergic to milk and partly because I keep a lot of the ingredients on hand. I usually double the recipe so we can have extras. I find that it's a lot better this way: I use only coconut milk (not the lite version), a full jar of Major Grey's Chutney (I've also used apricot preserves when I was out of chutney - worked fine, but is better with the chutney because of the extra spices in it) and canned diced tomatoes (my husband made this recently when I was out and used fresh...strangely, it wasn't as good). I also slice the onions rather thick so they don't melt away. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
The best curry I have EVER made! For the skeptics, I doubted it would have complexity or authenticity too. I mean, was "Major Grey chutney" really around in 1936? And isn't the cow a sacred animal in India? But I digress... The only changed I made, which I would highly recommend: -1/2 coconut milk and 1/2 whole milk -add half jalapeno, seeds removed with onions I, (gasp!), didn't have a few tomatoes at home, so I added a few tbsp of tomato paste. Delicious. What a gem, this recipe is.

The complex flavors of this dish are always a hit. Recently I made it for a crowd of 11 and everybody loved it. I more than doubled the ingredients, except for the cinnamon sticks. When I make it next time, I'll add extra crushed red pepper. (It would benefit from a bit more "heat.") Like many other reviewers, I used coconut milk instead of regular milk. I also used canned tomatoes instead of fresh.

Rating: 4
This was a fantastic and fairly easy weeknight recipe. Subbed 1/2 light coconut milk for partofnthe milk, and used skim milk for the rest. Really nice flavor addition. Worked fairly well in a pressure cooker for about 20 minutes (instead of two hours simmering as recipe calls for.) next time might try this in the crockpot. Also added several cups of fresh spinach at the end, which was a really lovely addition. Will definitely add spinach every time.

Made this for the first time for my in-laws and got rave reviews... but on the second try, I think I will use just one cinnamon stick rather than 2. The cinnamon was a bit aggressive for my taste, but even still, it was delicious. I think you need to use a really fresh, high quality curry powder here. Don't rely on that tin of curry that's been in the pantry a few years. I am intrigued by the suggestions for coconut milk instead of cream.... may give that a try next time. My only alteration from the recipe was I used a 28 oz can of tomatoes and their juice, and had plenty of great sauce. Will def. make again!

I was not very impressed with this recipe. I felt something was missing. I will make it again but I will try a bit of lemongrass and coconut milk in it.

So GOOD! We just finished this and loved it. I made it to recipe with the exception of subbing a mix of coconut milk and cream for the milk and I added a dash of cumin. This is a minimal prep/work dish with major outcome. I took the advice of another reviewer and put some sauce into my immersion blender (with about 2 tablespoons of flour) and it added nice body to the dish. I highly recommend that method. This dish is perfect. It's fresh, hearty and you taste every aspect of the ingredients. Try it, you'll love it.

This was fanfreakingtastic and pretty easy for a weeknight dinner. Had all the ingredients on hand, luckily. Cooked on low for only about 90 minutes but was still super tender and tasty. Liked that it really only used one pot too so cleanup was fast. Many beef cury dishes are more thai-influenced, which is also good, but I like having this option too. A keeper for sure.

Excellent. Prepared it exactly as written. The balance of flavors is wonderful.

Rating: 4
Excellent flavour. The spice combination is the key. I've noticed however that when I visit an East Indian restaurant, the sauces are often quite smooth in texture. Therefore, when making this dish, after browning the meat and removing from the pan, I then brown the onions, and combine the tomatoes, milk etc. I put the mixture thru my blender to achieve a smooth consistency. I then recombine the liquids with the spices and meat before slow cooking it for @ 4 hours. The flavour is fantastic and my husband told me 'I certainly have outdone myself'.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe, savory and full of wonderful flavors that complement each other. Didn't have chutney, so I sub'd with plum jam and used garlic chili sauce instead of crushed red pepper. Let simmer for 4 hours with great results. Will make this one over and over again. Maybe with lamb next time.

Made this last night and even my hubby who doesn't like "sweet with his meat" LOVED IT!!!! It took the chill of a very cold winter night Made few changes used coconut milk instead of regular milk, used red curry paste instead of powder, canned tomatoes, lime juice instead of lemon, and didn't have any cloves so just left them out, and instead of crushed red pepper use sriracha hot chili sauce about a Tbsp but use depending on how much heat you want. It was a perfect balance of mildly sweet, spicy, and with a hint of tart

This was pretty darned yummy. I also used coconut milk, but didnt worry about the "lite". Love the stuff that has the thick layer of cream on the top. Fabulous. I cooked all the ingredients in a Dutch Oven and after the initial boiling, I put the pot in a 250 degree oven for 4 hours. No fuss, no muss. And, it fell apart. We love curries so will keep this for sure.

Rating: 4
Really good! Following other cooks, I used the crockpot. I only used 1 cinnamon stick and used light coconut milk (full can). I used 3 cans (14 oz) of diced tomatoes. I substituted mango chutney and used less to begin with because I was afraid it would be too sweet, but I ended up adding the full amount or maybe a bit more toward the end of cooking. I also used less lemon (about 1.5 Tbsp) to begin with and then added a splash at the end of cooking which really brightened things up. I used a lot more salt that the recipe called for. I think that for crockpot the cooking time should be longer because my beef was still a bit tough after 1/2 hour on high and 2.5 hours on low. I have a large size crockpot and used about 2.5 lbs beef. Next time I'd still use the crockpot but would go 3 to 4 hours. I served this over rice and with a side of steamed broccoli. We loved it.

One of my favorite winter meals! As suggested by user Lizbeth108 from Tacoma, WA I browned my meat and added all my ingredients to my slow cooker. (used ground clove, and ground cinnamon, and 1% milk) for 1/2 hour on high. I swiched it to low and let it simmer for about 4 hours while out running errands. We had an excellet tender beef curry served over jasmine rice. (I've also made this the recommended way and find the meat to be chewy! Slow cooker all the way!)

This is an amazing curry! It's become my go-to dish whether I'm making dinner at home on a Sat. night or entertaining. Took it to an indian pot luck dinner last night and everyone raved! The best part is that it is such an easy dish to make. You just need a bit of time as the beef just melts in your mouth and it is so tasty and flavourful if you do simmer it for 2 hours. Like other cooks, I used a can of lite coconut milk in place of the whole milk and I used one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes. Instead of the crushed red pepper and curry powder I used 2 tbsp of Patak's Madras curry paste. If I were making for a crowd that liked more spice, I would've doubled that.

This is a total keeper of a recipe. I can totally see making this a once a week dish. The beef was good but any meat would be great, particularly lamb. I read through dozens of other posts with adjustments and incorporated many of them. Here is how I did it; Adjustments; As per other suggestions wanted to increase the sauce, texture and color of the dish Cooked 3/4 of onions before adding all other ingredients. Added the last 1/4 once everything was together and brought to simmer Used (3) cans of organic diced, peeled tomatoes. Added two cans when the recipe called for tomatoes and added the last can 3/4 through the cooking process Used a can of coconut milk. Definitely look for the light version to keep it healthy. Also 1/2 a can of water. Substituted the 1/4 teaspoon of crushed dried pepper for 3 tbsp of prepared Madras Curry Paste. These prepared pastes are readily available and cheap. They add much more dimension of flavor due to the extra spices. Omitted the Chutney. We didn't miss it. Only used one cinnamon stick. I served it garnished with lots of fresh chopped cilantro, Basmati rice (sure fire prep method on this site) and nan bread. Big Hit!

Another staple in my easy & delicious repertoire. My friends beg me to make this for them. Like other reviewers, I use a 28oz. can of diced tomatoes & a can of coconut milk. I toss in some frozen green peas at the end - adds another colour to the plate - and serve over rice with a side of cauliflower. If there's a lot of sauce left over (after the meat is all gone) I add chickpeas for a quick & easy next day lunch.

Delicious and easy for a curry. I used a big can of diced tomatoes and substituted light coconut milk for all the whole milk, and only used one cinnamon stick. I didn't find the curry overly sweet as others did -- nothing like the sweet curries I know, anyway (Korma and Pasanda). After the meat and onions browned, I threw everything in my slow cooker and cooked 30min on high and 2 1/2 hours on low as another reviewer recommended. Amazing! Didn't find the onions or tomatoes too mushy, either. Will make many times again.

Really great recipe with a subtle heat that build and builds, but never really burns. The prepwork can easily happen ahead of time, too. I followed the advice by other reviewers and used light coconut milk instead of whole milk. Had to use ground cloves because found out at last minute that I was out of the whole variety. I also substituted pork filet for the beef and did not cook for the entire time period. Next time, I'll add more tomatoes. Highly recommended.

Just made this for the first time. I browned the meat and sauteed the onions, then put everything into the slow-cooker for a half hour on high, turning it down to let it simmer on low while I was at work. The result was as fragrant as it was delicious. My husband and I are both fans of curry and he loved this one. We both thought that one cinnamon stick was probably enough--especially when slow cooked. I used light coconut milk as others suggested and canned tomatoes for convenience. I also mixed a little bit of corn starch with milk and added it at the very end to thicken it up just a bit. I will definitely make again.

make this alot. great leftovers. used canned tomatoes, its easier. I usually have a bowl of chopped peanuts, and a bowl of currants, and a bowl of chopped green onions for my guests or family to sprinkle on top as a garnish. I have often had to substitute ingredients with what I had in the house, and discovered it is almost impossible to mess this recipe up. it is very forgiving. I highly recommend it. It is not very spicy if this is a concern. you can always adjust it to your own taste.

Definately use cocoanut milk instead of cows milk. I also added 2 peeled diced yellow potatos. I also added extra diced tomatos the last 5 minutes for color. The flavor is complex, not too sweet. I did miss the heat that most curries have so may add 2-3 sliced, seeded serranoe chilies as well as double the red pepper powder next time.

I agree with all of the reviews so far. This is really a spectacular recipe. The broth has SO much character I really felt like a pro when I made this for my girlfriend. And she is a tough critic, I dare say a food snob. I have two recommendations for this recipe, however. My first is that if you enjoy curry broth, increase the ingredients that pertain to the broth in this recipe. Then you'll have extra to soak into the rice. Second, I recommend adding the onions and tomatos much LATER in the ripe to prevent them from turning to mush. While I understand that monosodium glutamate (sp?) in tomatoes adds to the flavor of just about any savory dish, no one wants a pile of mushy mush in their bowl of curry. So I recommend allowing the beef to become completely tender before adding either the tomatoes or onions. Adding peppers or carrots isn't a bad idea either, especially if you heed my advice and increase the amount of broth.

Delicious, but a bit too sweet. I will use coconut milk and omit the chutney next time.

Rating: 4
I also greatly enjoyed this recipe and will definitely make it again. Both for dietary reasons and because I didn't have any chutney, I substituted mango/apricot yoghurt for the milk (coconut milk) and chutney in the recipe. Like so many others, I too used some diced tomatoes (really valuable, I'm sure, in ensuring that the curry stays moist during long cooking times). But I also cut up some regular tomatoes too, for added texture. About a half-hour before taking off the heat, I also added mushrooms. Obviously, the amount of curry powder and/or red pepper is a matter of personal taste. This is going to sound somewhat silly, but don't forget to let people know not to eat the cinnamon stick (or take it out before serving). Enjoy!!

This was fantastic. We eat a lot of Indian food at our house, and this was as good as some of my favorites. It's very creamy, not spicy, and just a little sour, which I didn't think I would like but really enjoyed. This is a nice counter-point to those bright yellow highly spiced bitter curries. This would be a good choice to add to a formal Indian menu with many different foods served. We ate it with homemade naan, cumin rice, and spicy zucchini, tomatoes and chick peas. I made a couple of minor changes: took the advice of other reviewers and subbed light coconut milk for 3/4 of the whole milk (I had some left over from another Indian feast), don't like huge chunks of meat in curries, so cut my beef into 1/2 inch cubes, didn't have whole spices, and so just eyeballed ground cloves and cinnamon and used ground cayenne pepper. Also used one can of Muir Glenn fire-roasted tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes.Lastly, I thought the recipe was a tad sour, so I added two pinches of sugar. Next time I'll probably use only two Tbsp. of lemon juice. Recipe takes a while to make, but it's mostly simmering time. Recipe makes terrific leftovers (I'm eating them for lunch as I type).

This is a great recipe! I did make it with the coconut milk suggested by others and it was delicious - not too overwhelming. I also used chicken and it turned out excellent. The leftovers were superb as well. I have recommended this recipe to several of my vegetarian friends as I believe it could be delicious if substituting the meat with garbanzo beans. I will definitely try that myself.

This was a last minute whip together meal with leftover steak from the night before. I didn't have whole milk so I used 1% and then added about 1/3 c of coconut milk as well. I found it to be quite spicy and was concerned about my 8 year old not eating it so I added about 1/3 c of plain yogurt to tone it down a bit. I also doubled the cloves and did 1/2 the garlic as I didn't have time for all that chopping. Very yummy! This would work with any meat or even tofu!

I agree with the other reviewers who liked this recipe alot. I did not use coconut milk because of the high fat content. I would also suggest either cutting the pieces of beef much smaller than suggested, or using chicken or pork. The beef does little for the recipe which is excellent on it's own. No way too cinnamony, as someone suggested, and does not need much in the way of changes (I made it as written and it was a hit with family harsh critics). Only change I would try is chicken or pork and smaller pieces of meat, whichever kind. Definitely will make again.

This recipe was just begging to be made in my Crockpot & it worked like a charm. I browned the meat & onions, then threw everything into the Crockpot & set it on high for 4 hours. Instead of milk, I used 1 cup whole milk, drained yogurt (my favorite brand is Fage) thinned with a 1/2 cup of water & cream. The only thing I might do differently next time is to use coconut milk (as others have suggested) & to substitute lamb, as I felt that the beef didn't have much flavor.

I'll join the chorus of praise for this one, and add my vote for coconut milk. I served it to friends with a simple dal as a starter, and took the advice to make the cucumber and melon salad that also appears on this site.

I think the reason it calls for cow milk in the original is that the recipe dates to 1936...coconut milk may have been a little exotic in those days!

YUMMY! My hubby and I loved this. I did not use milk, I was a bit pressed for time so I used 2 cans of Thai Coconut Ginger soup, strained out all the chunks, and cut my simmer time in half. I wanted a more hearty stew so I added carrots (sauteed w/the onions) and mushrooms, I would have added bell peppers if I had some, and potatoes could have worked if they were added at the right time. I wanted more "sauce" so I basically doubled my liquids and seasonings. We both enjoy a good bit of heat (green chile goes on everything in New Mexico!), and this was almost too hot, but still very tasty, could've been the curry powder I used. I used 3 fresh tomatoes and also a can of diced, I added more lemon than called for and an anise pod, because I felt spunky. I forgot to make the rice until it was too late, so I made a 5 minute couscous with pine nuts, and it turned out to be the perfect oops. Great dish, and good for at least two days after you make it!

This is a good solid recipe and we enjoyed it - it will be easily modified to include different meats or veggies. The only change I made this time was to use light coconut milk which helped it have that velvety mouth feel that I like in curries. I am perplexed by some of the reviewers that described using curry paste instead of powder. My experience is that these are very different: I though powder is based on turmeric and coriander and paste is based on chilies. Is there another kind of paste? Also, to the cook in italy, there is nothing like a chutney, try to order one online rather than substituting.

I had a problem with the taste...I added the coconut milk and also carrots and peas. Other than that, I followed everything per recipe directions except...I used a sweet mango chutney instead of Major Grey and I used yellow curry powder. Can those of you that are familiar tell me if these would make a difference in the taste of the curry? It ended up having a slightly sour, sweet, tart taste that was unpleasant. I've had curries before and love them and have made chicken curries before...but never beef. Did the chutney make a difference? Should I have used red curry (is there a difference?) I'd like to like this recipe and would be willing to make it again if I thought it would be good.

I make this quite often, it is very good. I use coconut milk in place of milk, and I have used canned tomatoes in place of fresh a few times. This is a regular during the colder months.

As I live in Italy and chutney does not exist, does anyone have a suggestion of a substitute??? I would love to make this. Thanks for your help...

Rating: 3
I'll add my accolades--and a few suggestions for changes. I added raw carrots during the simmer stage, and I threw in bamboo shoots and frozen peas at the end. I also used canned tomatoes, and I omitted the cloves and used ground cinnamon instead of the sticks. Like many others, I used lite coconut milk, adding it in two stages (watered down half a can for most of the simmer time, then added rest of the can toward the end). Served over nutty, delicious basmati rice, and my guests raved!

This was a DELICIOUS dish!!! Following the suggestions, I used a can of coconut milk, a can of diced tomatoes and put everything in the slow cooker for a few hours. I also added cooked potatoes,frozen peas and diced yellow pepper near the end of the cooking time. The meat was very tender and the 'stew' over jasmine rice was YUMMY!

This is so easy and good! Followed the suggestions of others and made it with lite coconut milk instead of cow's milk - otherwise made exactly as suggested. We will make this again.

Very good stew. I never follow a recipe as it is written so I share with you what I changed: [1] used light coconut milk in stead of cow milk (why the heck would one use cow milk in this recipe?); [2] Chutney doesn't really matter which one I guess but I used mango; [3] used half lime and half lemon; [4] added water chestnut and bamboo shoots; [5] threw in a glass of red Port wine. So I don't know how much of the original flavor is left. In any case we loved this one!

Rating: 3
Substituted fresh tomatoes with two small cans of stewed Italian-style tomatoes, and also used coconut milk. DELICIOUS! To avoid the carbs from rice, served it with steamed broccoli. Next time, will simmer it w/ plenty of crunchy vegetables. A keeper.

Rating: 3
This was great, although I thought that i saw that someone used crushed tomatoes with this recipe, so that's what I used. I would have WAY prefered diced, because it turned out more creamy than I would have liked. The flavor was nice and my guests enjoyed the heat. I used Patak's hot curry paste. I'll make again.

I've made this dish several times. It is relatively easy and always gets rave reviews from family and guests. I use coconut milk and a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes. I also dredged the beef with flour. Yummy!!!

Rating: 4
Yum! four enthusiastic forks up. i made this with coconut milk (even without separating the water from the white goop it did not curdle). i also used canned crushed tomatoes as someone else suggested. after starting on the cooktop, i put it in the oven at 275 for the last hour since my burners don't heat all that evenly and parts were sticking to the pot. my only complaint was that it was not spicy enough - i will add a bit more red pepper next time. for a treat, add a dollop of sour cream before serving. mmm.

I brown meat, onions, garlic, spices, then dump everything in slow cooker for the day. Use coconut milk, as per the cook from Denmark. Stew is even better the next day. Definitely a keeper.

Used buffalo stew meat, and it was great. Cooked it in the over as some other reviewers and found that I needed to add more milk because it was all evaporating.

Very flavorful. I used dried spices and one tablespoon of coco-jam along with the milk. I put it all in a crock pot on high for 4 hours and the results were great.

I liked this dish, it is a sweet curry, while I generally prefer red hot ones. Definitly use coconut milk instead of milk. But add the pale watery part during the cooking process and then mix in the white creamy part just before serving to preven curdling. (You can do this by NOT mixing the coconut milk can, just put 2 holes in the bottom of the can and drain out the watery part, then open the can and spoon out the creamy white part). Also I didnt have chutney so I added a chopped mango a chopped apple.

Rating: 4
The first time I made this recipe exactly as written and we loved it. The next time, I didn't have milk, so as others suggested, I used coconut milk instead and it was just as wonderful. Also, I put the browned beef and the caramelized onions in the crockpot with all the other ingredients and cooked on low for 6 hours. It was perfect, the sauce thickened just right and the beef was very tender. This recipe is a definite keeper!

Rating: 2
Found this very sweet. It reminded me more of a tagine (tasting of prunes and raisins and Morroccan-style spices - probably thanks to the Chutney) IF I made it again, I'd use lamb and serve over cous-cous, but as a curry, it didn't suit our tastes.

This is a fantastic recipe! My family loved it. Definitely a keeper. I wouldn't omit any of the spices though. They're the key to this great dish.

Rating: 2
I thought the spices, especially the ginger, were too overwhelming. It smelled great. I've never added so many ingredients to anything. My main problem was that I could not taste the beef. Curry powder already contains ginger and clove, among other things, so perhaps one could cut back on adding more of the same?

Rating: 3
A pleasant variation of beef stew. Not too spicy, not too sweet.Add carrots, cauliflower and peas for a complete one dish meal. Used fat-free half & half and it worked well. Will make again!

This recipe will definitely be in the regular rotation in our home. It was easy, fragrant, and hands-down delicious. Read the other reviews and to make my life easier used- 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, all dried seasonings, 1 c whole milk, 1 c coconut milk ( a little extra liquid to give good sauce to soak up with some naan), 1 T red curry paste for a little extra something, and a couple of handfuls of frozen peas and baby carrots at the end for color. Also, I recommend doing the Taste of Thai Coconut and Ginger rice as another reviewer suggested (another way to simplify the work). I couldn't ask for a more delightful recipe experience. I'm asian and my husband is middle eastern. This one satisfies the gammit of taste buds and some.

YUM! I cannot believe how fantastic the aroma is while making this dish. Looks like lots of work, but in fact is quite simple. Next time I will use 1/2 coconut milk. Everyone devoured dinner, even our toddler and cat. This one is a keeper.

I used 1.5 cups of light coconut milk instead of milk, and it came out a little sweet. Next time I would use half coconut milk and half regular milk. I would also use half of the cinnamon and half of the cloves. Also used the 275 degree oven method--worked very well. Despite being a little too sweet and too much cinnamon/clove, everyone liked it. Will definitely make again.

This is an impress-your-friends recipe, every bit as good as in a restaurant. I used 1.5 lb meat, 32 oz. canned diced tomatoes, 1 C regular coconut milk, 1/2 C 2% milk, and augmented the powdered curry with 1 t red curry paste at the beginning of cooking, using the 275 degree/2.5 hour method. Incredible!

Rating: 4
Silly easy!! It's in the 'keeper' pile of recipes. Took others suggestions and subbed whole milk for coconut milk, added some peas and chunked carrots near the end as well as about a tsp. of red curry paste...Hubby, and kids went back for more. Served over Basmati rice with naan bread.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! Flavorful & fragrant. The only substitution I made was to use 2% milk instead of whole. Will definitely try coconut milk next time. Also, I'll use Red Curry the next time to spice it up even more. Served it with mixed greens--beet & collards--with vinegar. The cool, acidic vinegar compliments the sweet spicy curry perfectly.

Rating: 3
Second time having made this dish and delish as ever. Used lite coconut milk and 28 oz of canned tomatoes instead of fresh (Glen Muir Fire Roasted). Instead of finishing on top of stove, I placed in a 275 degree oven for a couple hours and it came out perfectly, without having to worry about the scorching issue. This would probably work very well in a crock pot too. Served with Honeydew-Cucumber salad and would suggest having naan if you have the time or inclination to make or buy some... would have been a perfect accompaniment

Rating: 4
this is a regular dish in our household. my 13-year old regularly asks me to make it, and my 4 year old loves it too. we also use coconut milk. the only other thing i change is i just sear the beef when i fry it. the first time i made it i cooked it for 7 minutes as it said and it ended up being too tough. we make raita as a side dish to cool it down (the cucumber-yogurt salad on epicurious)

With a litle twicking and this dish was awesome! Dear hubby, 10 yr old son and 2 yr old daughter loved it. I'm fortunate to live near a Jamaican grocery store and had, on hand, chutney and curry. When I use to use local grocery store chutney and curry powder I typically had to use more, but not from a Jamaican store -- I use less than what most receipes calls for. I used coconut milk instead of whole milk. "Yum-me!!", exclaimed my daughter . She's only 2 and has been indoctrinated with spices for a 1 year now (she's my kind of eater).

I think this curry was a tad too sour. I had to add in more chutney and sugar to balance it out. Also doubled the coconut sauce and added carrots, potatoes, and broccoli.

Really delicious variation on beef stew - sweet, mild and aromatic. Substitutions - 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, can whole tomatoes, mango chutney, buffalo. And it still turned out just great. I can't imagine how good this would be with coconut milk (but I'm watching my waistline right now). A great cold weather dish. I can't wait to serve it for company! This is a great recipe to introduce friends to the taste of Indian food.

To the cook from Montara, CA.....yes its an Indian recipe...or almost an Indian recipe for beef. India has one of the largest Muslim populations in the world and beef is eaten all over the country. It is also cooked by the catholic community.It is cheaper then chicken and mutton (goat meat) and hence is also consumed by the poor in many parts of the country. One very BIG FLAW in this recipe ( Besides the major grey chutney and the whole milk)is the use of the bay leaf. Indian cuisine uses "Tejpatta", often mistakenly called the "Indian bay leaf". The 2 are botanically completely different plants. The bay leaf is used in the European and mediterranean cuisines. The leaves are large and leathery. The Indian tejpatta are smaller leaves and the dried leaves are very brittle. They are leaves of a cassia plant and have a flavor similar to the cinnamon bark. If u cant get tejpatta (very easily available in Indian groceries)...leave it out completely or use a piece of cinnamon bark. Also...if u are planning on adding coconut milk to the dish....this is how it is traditionally done. The coconut milk is always extracted fresh and is added in 2 additions to a dish. Initially the second or thinner extract is added and the dish is cooked. The thicker/ first extract is added at the end when the food is completely cooked. This thick extract adds a rich coconut flavor to the dish and is just warmed through. If it is added while cooking, it tends to curdle and releases coconut oil into the dish making it very greasy.For the thinner extract mix 1/2 cup of canned milk with 1/2 cup of water. For the first extract use canned coconut milk directly without diluting. Also try and get the lite coconut milk. The full fat kind is too rich....the fresh extract made at home is not as thick.

Rating: 4
Didn't have a bay leaf, but that didn't prevent this amazing recipe from living up to all the raves. Man, was this a delicious stew. It filled the house with an amazing aroma, and the marriage of so many flavors was a tremendous one. Don't think twice about trying this 4-fork recipe!

There are only a few recipes on this site I actually make again, and this will be one of them. It's terrific, and easy. Next time I will definitely use potatoes and coconut milk as others have suggested, to make it even better. FYI - I used ground cinnamon, ground cloves, ground ginger, and 1 % milk and it came out fine. But coconut milk really would be declicious.

A tasty way to cook up your stew meat. Not like most of the Indian food I am used to getting at restaurants...a lot more mild (even using the hot curry we had). Did it strike anyone else as odd that it's an Indian recipe for cow? Great over egg-noodles too.

I have to agree with just about everyone that this is a great curry recipe. I was a bit alarmed that the milk separated when the lemon juice was added, but everything blended together after cooking. I used canned diced tomatoes as fresh ones are out of season and sprinkled fresh coriander over each serving.

We enjoyed this recipe but next time I will try it with skinless chicken thighs as we all prefered the delicious sauce to the stewy tasting beef. I too used (lite) coconut milk and added some cubed red potatoes as well. At the end of cooking I added some frozen peas and chopped coriander and I think it really improved the recipe by freshening things up both visually and tastewise. Oh yeah-I finely choppped the onion, garlic and ginger together in the proccesor anf proceeded from there. I save a little time and I like the texture it gives to the sauce. Sharwood's Major Grey Chutney is not sweet at all and is great in the sauce. In fact if I were just rating the sauce(which IS the curry)I would give this recipe 4 stars!

Oh, this is just delicious! I make a lot of curry dishes, and this has just become my favorite one. Although I am a big fan of coconut milk, I decided to make this with whole milk as written and I can't imagine it being any better. I'm sure I will make this dish again and again.

I'm vegetarian, but the rest of the family eats meat. So this recipe is really great for all of us. It works as a simple vegetabel curry very well.

Loved this recipe. We omitted the ginger and lemon juice and substituted lime juice because we were cooking only what was in the refridgerator, and it turned out great. We added dried apricots and golden raisins at the end as well as a touch of turmeric for color and taste. We also used ground cloves and cinnamon instead of the whole spices. We served it with white rice, but cous cous or basmati rice would have worked out great too. A touch of cilantro also added much needed color and taste as well.

I loved this recipe. I usually find Indian dishes rather time intensive to prepare, but this one was pretty easy! I would also suggest adding potatoes. Also, I felt it needed a lot more salt to counter the sweetness of the cinnamon and cloves. Next time I will try the coconut milk and add some hot green chilies. And they were right with the name - this dish is certainly 'fragrant'- your kitchen will smell great!

once again, epicurious came to my rescue! i decided to try something a little different than my usual beef stew, which is delicious, as is. this recipe was just perfect! i stewed the beef a bit (i like it to practically melt in my mouth). then, i threw in some cut white and sweet potatoes, and threw it in the oven on low. two hours later, tossed in a bag of fozen peas for a couple minutes longer, and served. my twelve year old loved it, even with the s. potatoes! the chutney was not available either, still a great change to a classic american dish.

I mainly cook traditional dishes, but I found this to be a great alternative to regular beef stew. It's so flavorful and delicious. I also used light coconut milk, and I couldn't believe how well it turned out. Also used powdered Cloves and Cinnamon instead of whole - turned out just fine. The only chutney I could find at the store was labeled "hot" and you could really taste the heat from just 3T of it. Next time I would try to find regular (mild) chutney.

Darn good curry. My girlfriend and I made this tonight because her work is having a curry cook-off. If I could suggest any changes, they would be use coconut milk instead of whole (of course), try adding diced green apples (sounds odd, but it'll work), and in the fnal ten minutes of cooking down, add yellow bell pepper, and don't worry if you don't think it's not thick enough; these things have a way of solving themselves.

This is a wonderful dish! I followed the advice of others and used coconut milk. I can't imagine making this without it.

Made this for New Year's eve -- unbelieveably good! I took the other cooks' advice and added yellow pepper, carrots and small potatoes -- good suggestions.

Being a Personal Chef, I am always looking for new & exciting entrees for my clients. I found this & I have to say it really is wonderful. I decided on using Glen Muir Organic Fire Roasted Tomatoes (28oz can) instead of fresh because fresh is out of season here in WA state & I have been spoiled. Hot house doesn't compare. I made this yesterday & my client raved about it. Now I am making it again today for my family. I can't wait to eat! I served it with coconut-ginger rice. Yummmm! I highly reccomend a choice cut of stewing meat. There is a difference.

Great recipe, although I admittedly altered it in several respects. First, I used goat meat. I had seen it at the market several times, and it always looked great. Seasoned it well with seasoning salt and ground pepper, seared it well on all sides, and added all the aromatics and broth (no milk), except I left out the clove and cinnimon, adding double the curry powder instead. I then simmered it in a 250* oven for 3 hours. The next day I brought it back up to a simmer, added potatoes, peas and a cup of cream, and served with yellow rice. Delicious.

We all loved this recipe as well. I had lost a wonderful old lamb curry recipe of my mother's and this reminded me of it, somewhat. A minor difference with major taste was to cook the meat in bacon grease (bacon becomes a bouy.) Also, we decided to accompany the curry with buoys, like my mother's recipe. We used the bouys on hand, but they can include chopped tomatoes cucumbers, peanuts, apples, chutney, bananas, almonds, raisins, chopped egg, green onions, bacon (some will cut the heat.) My mother's recipe also included a side note - serve with beer or rough, red wine. Enjoy!

I'll make this again and again and again! Wow! What a wonderful curry dish. I also subbed coconut milk and doubled the red pepper flakes. I was fortunate enough to have a friend give me a specially blended Malasian curry, which we used and was delicious. Next time i may try red curry paste. Definitely a keeper.

Must add my praise of this recipe to all that preceed me! My first attempt at a curry was a resounding success.

This curry takes me right back to my honeymoon in London where my husband and I had the best curry! This curry is sweet and very flavorful. The aroma is just fabulous.

Even in 85 degree June, this recipe is a fantastic delight. My favorite recipes all have very little chopping and fuss. We enjoyed a game of scrabble along with the heavenly smell of a curry blending and bubbling on the stove and the game ended in time to eat. When my fiance asked if we could make it for company, I knew it was on the repeat list. My advice: if you don't have the suggested add-in of coconut milk handy but have it shredded, whip it with hot water and strain for juice. Made jasmine rice to soak it up, though any starch would rejoice under this thick sauce.

Good, but I'm still looking for a great Beef Rogan Josh recipe. This one comes close with the substitution of a can of coconut milk for the milk but it's still missing something.

My family enjoyed this...the next day. The day I made it, the sauce seemed somewhat harsh, and the recipe needs some sweetening and vegetables.

This is a wonderful recipe, the whole family loved it, even my 5 year old grand daughter. I could not find Major Grey chutney in a small local food market so I used on hand ingredients of 1/2 pear, 1/2 apple, 1/4 cup of raisins 1 teas grape jelly. I would make it again this way also.
