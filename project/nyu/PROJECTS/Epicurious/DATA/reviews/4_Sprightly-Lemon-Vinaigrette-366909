SO easy. A recipe that gets absolute raves. It's amazing because everyone I serve it to says, "what did you put on this salad!?!?" and it's just so simple.

I've been using this as a base for all my salad dressings for decades. It's best with Meyer lemons. If watching calories, it's even good with equal parts oil and lemon juice. Add Worstershire sauce, more garlic, and dry mustard and it becomes Caesar Dressing. Add basil, green onions, parsley and it becomes Italian dressing. Add grated ginger. . . .well, you get the idea. And as the original recipe states, it is delicious on its own. Once you start with this, you will never purchase a salad dressing again. I haven't for more years than I can count on my toes and fingers.
