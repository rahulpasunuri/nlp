Best blueberry pie ever - I like the crust a little less than my usual recipe, but the filling was awesome!

My boyfriend and I live in BC and it is blueberry season here (the berries are large and sweet, but they aren't wild). We made this pie from local berries we picked ourselves and it couldn't have turned out better. It looks and tastes just like a gourmet pie from a bakery! The maple syrup adds a really nice richness to the flavor of the pie. We added 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the recipe. A small note: make sure you get minute Tapioca, otherwise the tapioca probably won't dissolve. Otherwise, you don't even need cream or ice cream to enjoy this. It's just that good!

It's blueberry season here in NY and this recipe enhances that "just picked" flavor. I've made this pie many times since I first discovered in it my 1999 Bon Appetit. The crust is ambitous, although worth the work when you have the time. Even with a ready- made crust this pie will have you looking like a hero at your next get-to- gether. Heck, if you cheat and use a pre-made crust it's easy enough to make for a mid week dessert.

The best blueberry pie I've tasted. The maple sugar gives the filling just the right amount of sweetness while allowing the flavor of the blueberries to shine. I used an extra cup of blueberries (without changing anything else), the Cherry Pie crust recipe from his site (the only one I'll ever use from now on), and made the pie in a high-sided tart pan. My family devoured the pie in a day.

I have made this over the last 5 summers and have always been asked for the recipe after. It is a hit everytime!!

This truly tastes like fresh Diner blueberry pie! Careful not to exceed that tapioca amount as it can make the filling rubbery. Kids will devour in one day!

Very good pie. I tried it as is, and also with blueberries mixed with wild blackberries. I also added a little more thickening, a few tablespoons of maple sugar, and used half Grade B maple syrup with half Grade A.

This was very easy to prepare. It was well received by guests - one of whom declared himself an "expert blueberry pie taste tester". Even my husband declared it a "keeper". I followed the recipe exactly - nothing extra, nothing left out. That's the way I would make it again.

Excellent and subtly different--I added the extra 3/4 c sugar recommended by another reviewer--maybe will cut back to extra 1/2 c, but was wonderful and simple.

i really enjoyed this dish - i used alabama blueberries that i had frozen fresh last summer - the alabama blueberries are sweet but also bigger so i used 5 cups instead of 4 - i also didn't have any fresh lemons but i had some key lime juice and used that just fine - in fact i think lime goes better with blueberries anyway. i also used my old standby pie crust receipe - if you love blueberries then you will love this - i think the maple syrup instead of sugar is a great taste and the pie is not "sticky sweet" it has a mild sweetness that makes this pie a perfect setup for your favorite vanilla ice cream or whipped cream...

Whoa!! WHAT a TART pie!! I added a little extra flour and it thickened up beautifully without bubbling over. But that one cup of maple syrup doesn't go far where "sweet" is concerned! This pie reminded me of the Rhubarb Pie that Laura Ingalls Wilder made without any suger. Yikes! I would not make this pie again without adding at least 3/4 to 1 cup of sugar to the filling. Bummer, too, it was a gorgeous LOOKING pie... :(

This was devine. I used half blueberries and half blackberries for a little variety, and I also added a little extra flour because it was pretty juicy. This is a pie I will have to make again and again.

This pie is fabulous! The maple syrup really gives it a unique flavor. I'd recommend adding a little extra flour to thicken it as it's very juicy.

We love this recipe for the blueberry filling!I use 6 cups berries (1 and 1/2 times the recipe) and vary the other ingredients proportionately. Quick to prepare if you use prepared pie crusts. A sprinkling of cinnamon helps too.

This pie was very good. I added extra flour to make mixture a little thicker and also added cinnamin sugar to add flavor. Very good and easy recipe.

I used a deep dish crust & added a half cup of whole cranberries.Absolutely gastrogasmic! note: If you're not using wild blueberries don't expect much flavor.

I've always thought blueberries were overrated, but this is an interesting combination of flavors. The thickening agents are perfect. My only change would be the crust... It's slightly tough. I like my old flour, shortening, egg and vinegar combo better.

Thie was a good basic blueberry pie recipe but there was nothing spectacular about it. It was not too sweet.

This was excellent. I would definitely make it again. I made it for a dinner party and everyone had a piece and even got up for seconds. The best part about this recipe is how easy it was to make.

I made this for two different groups of guests. Everyone loved it. I used ready made crusts, once a vegan crust and my strict vegetarian guest swooned. This recipe is fast and contains tasty and healthy ingredients. What could be bad?

I USED MY OWN PIE CRUST RECIPE SO CAN'T SPEAK FOR THIS ONE, BUT THE FILLING WAS QUITE GOOD AND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE NORM. I USED MAPLE PANCAKE SYRUP AND THE FLAVOR WAS SUBTLE, BUT I WAS GLAD. BAKING TIME IN THE MOUNTAINS WAS ABOUT 20 MINUTES LONGER THAN CALLED FOR.

Very good. I made the filling with purchased crusts from the dairy case, which made it a 15-minute recipe that is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this for a summer dessert.

I have made blueberry pies in the past but I've always found them to be a bit bland and "one-note" in flavor. This pie is the exception -- it was delicious even without ice cream! I've thrown out all the rest of my blueberry pie recipes!

I served this pie to my husband, and my brother- and sister-in-law. We all thought it was great. Because I didn't realize I had no tapioca until I was mid-recipe, I substituted cornstarch. I couldn't tell that there was any difference. Thanks for a great recipe.
