I used the recipe for the cognac gravy this year. It was fabulous. I simmered the giblets in about 6 cups of water for 4-5 hours. The broth was perfect for making the gravy. I deglazed the roasting pan as directed. I used 6 Tbs of fat and 1/2 cup of flour to make the roux, then added 5 cups of giblet broth with the degreased pan juice mixture. I used this gravy to make turkey pot pies with the left over turkey. Truly delicious.

I would suggest rubbing the spice mixture under the skin so the flavors actually get into the turkey. I also added some soft butter under the skin. The vermouth worked fine, but if you don't have it on hand or you want a little more flavor use white wine or additional cognac.

I made this last Thanksgiving and was so pleased with the way it came out that I made it again this year. I started; the morning before with the spice rub and doubled the amounts so that I would have lots of leftover spice mix. This mix is great on chicken as well. This year, I started to baste the turkey after two hours and the skin turned out crispy and amber colored. Best turkey ever.

This was amazing, particularly the skin crusted with spices. I added whole cloves to the spice mixture and liked it. Friends of mine who typically choose vegetarian foods had seconds of this turkey. I used a smaller bird than is called for (12 vs. 20 lbs) in the recipe and decreased the roast time by about 1 hour total. Delicious!

I doubled the spice blend..since I had 2 -14 lb turkeys to roast..although I gave 2 tbsp of the blend to my friend to enjoy on a roasted chicken.. I used Indonesian white pepper, smoked paprika and ground cinnamon from Penseys spices (used a mortar and pestle)..rubbed the spice blend on the turkey, after drizzling the birds with olive oil..popped them in oven bags, stuffed them with an orange and onion, and simply followed the oven bag instructions..you want juicy? That's what you'll get! Awesome!

Wow . . . this recipe impressed me and I didn't even adhere to the recipe. When I found the recipe, I just like the spices used and didn't have time to marinate the turkey. So I just put the spices on like a rub. I never made the gravy as I just wanted the meat for sandwiches, salads, and quesadillas. It was excellent (and so moist)! I can't wait till I roast the 2nd half of that turkey and follow the process of marinating and making the gravy, which sounds excellent. This recipe was a superlative surprise to me!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and my family loved it. My dad made a turkey too and gravy, so I didn't make the gravy, but I will next time. The turkey without gravy was still picked at all day so nothing was left.

Didn't actually make the turkey according to this recipe, but the cognac gravy is really outstanding. It's probably just because of the amount of turkey involved in creating it, I only used 6 lbs of necks and it was still great.

I decided to make this turkey at the last minute and it turned out great! I was skeptical because other recipes use so much butter under the skin and this uses none, but it was so moist and juicy, and the spices were delicious. So easy to prepare and hard to mess up. Everyone loved it!

I was a little nervous when choosing this for my Thanksgiving turkey, but decided to try it based on other reviews. It turned out very good and moist - which surprised me, given that it was a rub and didn't call for the usual basting or butter under the skin. I added anis pods and cardomom to the roasted/ground spices (I meant to add cloves as well, but forgot when preparing). I placed the rub the night before and stuffed the cavity with onion & apple wedges for a little extra flavor before placing in oven. One thing to be careful of is the cooking time recommendations from the recipe. I had a 18.5lbs turkey and my total cooking time was about 3hrs15min, rather than the 4hrs from the recipe. Around 2hrs30min, I started checking the temperature on a regular basis to make sure it wasn't overcooked. The gravy sauce was excellent, though I left out the giblet/heart, given picky eaters in my house. Last year for Thanksgiving I made the apple-roasted turkey, but we all preferred this turkey and would make it next year.

This was absolutely delicious and the gravy was to die for! I also made soup from the turkey carcass and the rub really added to the soup.

The rub was excellent; I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't expect that it would be as tasty as it was. My family felt that it was one of the best turkeys they ever had. The gravy was very good, although I chose to omit the chopped neck, heart and gizzard to the gravy.

Who knew you needed a recipe to make a turkey!?! But this was fantastic. I followed the directions exactly, and this was the most delicious, moist, perfectly done turkey I've ever done. I was skeptical about the time to do the spice rub, but it must have worked. It also makes for excellent gravy. Next time, it would also be good with a little hot spice (cayenne?) in the mix.
