Enjoying right now with a pinot noir. Changes were no salt in pasta water, and substituted 1/2 and 1/2 and a blob of 2% greek yogurt for the heavy cream. White pepper is a answer.

loved the recipe. it was easy and fast to make. i did use rotini b/c i love how this pasta holds sauce, i used a bit more cream and added chopped mushrooms and celery b/c i wanted more body and crunch. i also used flaked salmon instead of smoked to decrease the salt content. lovely dish!

I made a few changes and the results were delish! I sauteed a few cloves of garlic and some diced shallot. Instead of heavy cream I used 1/2 a tub of marscapone cheese. I used 1TBL of lemon zest

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought this was tasty - the flavors mixed together very nicely. I made it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loved it. I altered it slightly - used about 2/3 lb. of pasta instead of the full pound since it was only for 2 of us, still used the full pound of asparagus and 1/4 lb of salmon, and I used a whole cup of cream instead of 2/3. I also skipped the part where you add some of the cooking water, mainly because I forgot to ladle it out before draining it, but it was just fine without the water. I thought it was nice, light, and fresh, and would definitely make it again.

I made this recipe as instructed and I was surprised at how uninteresting it was even though I love smoked salmon, dill and asparagus. Before I served it I heated more cream and added parmesan and asiago cheeses to give it some taste. I definitely would not make this again.

So tasty and oh so easy. I sauteed a shallot in sauce pan before adding cream. Will use half and half next time, just to cut some fat. We'll definitely make this again.

Made this dish for a dinner party a few weeks ago; friends were mad for it. I followed the directions to the letter and it was wonderful. I'm trying again tonight for a pot luck, and I'm using fresh poached salmon flaked instead of the smoked, I'll let you know how it turns out. Can't wait to have this dish again...

Yum! Yum! Yum! I just made this tonight. Wonderful dish. I loved all the flavors. I used bow tie pasta because I think it's a bit fancier. And I topped with some grated parmesan cheese. Will definitely make again.

We loved this dish. Although next time we'll increase the asparagus to around 1 1/2 lbs. and increase the smoked salmon to about 1/2 pound to around out this dish. Make sure you get good quality smoked salmon - we used Costco's Salmolux. Also, the dish needs more cream, and WHAT? No garlic in pasta?!! We added our usual 8-10 cloves. This recipe makes four very large servings. The flavors are sophisticated, and we'll definitely make it again.

Easy and fantastic! The asparagus picks up the lemon perfectly without it overpowering the dish as a whole. Definitely use thin asparagus which complement the gemelli's shape wonderfully, and don't skimp on the heavy cream. It was super the next day as a cold salad!

This dish was delicious and very easy to make.Perhaps the person who didn't like it should have used the heavy cream--that may have made the difference--or maybe she didn't like the ingredients. In any event it was a hit at our house.

I admit I used light cream, but the dish just didn't come together. I would definitely not make it again.
