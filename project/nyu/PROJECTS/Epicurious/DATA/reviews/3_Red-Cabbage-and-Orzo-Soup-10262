I added everything that previous reviewers suggested, except I used vegetable broth only & switched out the thyme with fresh rosemary. A nice hearty soup. If you're not vegetarian than I think bacon would be a good additon...I'll try that next time.

I added the white wine, a can of white cannellini beans and some thyme. With some crusty french bread it was a quick and delicious meal!

Thank you to the previous reviewer. I also sauteed onion and garlic in the oil for a few minutes before adding the cabbage, and threw in some crushed red pepper too. Once the cabbage was softened, I added a bit of white wine along with the juice of 1/2 lemon and cooked that down a bit before adding the stock and water (I used low sodium chicken stock and added kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste). Last, I stirred in a generous handful of chopped fresh parsley before serving with the scallions and lemon slices. Simple and delicious!

I should not have rated it... I tinkered with the recipe. However, it was an easy dish that was light and very tasty. I added 1/2 an onion (walla walla) and 1 clove of garlic with cabbage. Also, I squeezed half of a lemon in the broth and added parsley to the garnish. It was lovely and we served it with rosemary and balsamic roasted chicken on a chilly december evening. Yum!

an unexpectedly pleasing flavor combination. i used a particularly rich stock, and was generous with cabbage and pasta for a heartier soup, but the really winning elements were the lemon and scallion. not spectacular but a tasty and easy weeknight meal.

Not at all exciting, very bland
