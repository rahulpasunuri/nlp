in my opinion, this recipe is a big plate of fail. the combination of cream with the acid from the orange just doesn't work. it is not, not, not a good flavor combination. i tried to mod it by adding spin and cherry tom, but the overall flavor was just not good. just use a basic creme sauce and you'll be fine.

Four forks, with modifications, thanks to the multitude of comments. I added spinach, garlic, cherey tomatoes, and fresh basil. The entire recipe is here, for ease: Summer Citrus Pasta with Prosciutto // 12 ounces egg tagliatelle or fettuccine (preferably fresh); 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter; 1-2 cloves garlic, diced; 12 oz fresh spinach; Zest and juice of 1 orange; 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream; 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan; 4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, torn into 1" pieces; About one dozen cherry tomatoes, sliced in half; Freshly ground black pepper // Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt; add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until 1 minute before al dente, about 2 minutes for fresh pasta, longer for dried. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup pasta water. // Meanwhile, melt butter in a large heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté diced garlic for 1 minute but do not brown it. Add spinach and let it cook down. // Add reserved pasta water, orange juice, ¾ of zest, cream, and Parmesan cheese; stir and bring to a boil. Add pasta; cook, stirring, until sauce coats pasta and pasta is al dente, about 1 minute. // Serve pasta in warm bowls. Sprinkle on the prosciutto pieces, freshly chopped basil, and orange zest (in that order). Arrange cherry tomato halves around the pasta and serve. // Serves 2-3

I'll definitely make this again. Is really good

This is a good recipe considering how quick and easy it is and how few ingredients are involved -- great for a decent, guest-worthy meal when on a budget or short on time. However, I felt that something was lacking. The orange flavor was overpowered by the prosciutto, so I sprinkled on the remaining zest. Next time I will add the entire zest to the sauce, as well as some extra orange juice. I might also try stirring in some of the pulp or topping with some small orange slices.

Very quick, very easy and very yummy. My only tweak to the recipe was the addition of cherry tomatoes. I'll definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious and very easy. I decided to add kale to balance the orange and it worked very well. I sauteed the proscuitto and when it was half done I added the kale to saute. When they were done I removed from pan and made cream sauce as directed and re-added kale and proscuitto right before parmesan. Yum!

I liked this but definitely not a four fork for me --right now. I found the orange really overwhelmed the sauce and the flavor of the prosciutto. I did fry some of the prosciutto as per the recipe but I also added extra that was fresh and didn't really notice that browning the prosciutto really made much difference. I think next time I'd cut back on the orange and use some pancetta or Berkshire applewood smoked bacon for browning and depth and fresh prosciutto added at the last minute. I added tiny summer peas which gave it a spot of color so would do that again. Might also add mushrooms next time. I served with penne which absorbed all the sauce. A scattering of Italian parsley might help as well. I will make this again but will play with the sauce a bit.

This was good but next time I'd reduce the amount of orange zest -- overwhelmed th eflavors.

This is absolutely divine. I make it regularly. I usually substitute two slices of bacon for the prosciutto because I always have it on hand. I love it with seared scallops or crab on top. It goes together in the time it takes to bring the pasta water to a boil. A quick meal that tastes like you worked for hours.

This was a nice change from other creamy pasta dishes--and SO easy. A couple of thoughts: while I think browning the prosciutto was definitely warranted, there's no need to use butter--just a nonstick pan. I removed it before boiling the sauce and added it in at the end w/ the cheese and remaining zest. I didn't have fresh pasta, but at least used a high-quality dried egg noodle. Per another reviewer, I doubled the prosciutto...which was a bit too much. Next time, maybe 1-1/2 times, and up the orange zest/juice accordingly. I also added toasted pine nuts, which I though worked well, and could see where peas would up the veggie quotient w/o corrupting the light orange flavor.

Wow. This is wonderful. I didn't have oranges, so I used orange juice. I didn't have pasta, so I used vodka. I didn't have bacon, so I used iced cubes. I thought the cream and cheese might be too heavy, so I left it out. Two thumbs up!

So delicious! Made this for a small dinner party last night in Vermont after the guests had been skiing all day - it was definitely a hit and just the comfort food they needed. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives while sauteing the prosciutto, then I added juice from 1/2 lemon, 1.5 cups of peas, and 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil when it came time to mix everything together. Finally I added 1/4 cup of the shaved parmesan to the pasta dish all together before serving to the guests with some additional parmesan on top for garnish. I also used fresh fettuccine since I couldn't find tagliatelle. I served this with some homemade rosemary artisan bread and a salad of mixed greens, green apples, candied pecans and goat cheese with a homemade maple syrup dijon mustard vinaigrette....a few bottles of red wine made this the perfect winter meal!

Certainly followed the recipe as written 98% although I don't measure with great accuracy. Either way, I have two comments: 1 -- didn't like the handling of the prosciutto which diminished its magic. Would suggest broiling/baking until crisp then adding just as serving. 2 -- boiled the pasta a half-hour or so ahead so it had turned into a somewhat rubbery pan-shaped mass as pasta will do. Never mind: stir it into the quite liquidy sauce and in a minute when it has heated through, the texture is PERFECT -- creamy, not at all dry. Great! Fabulous flavor -- present, but subtle. Re-heats beautifully too.

I actually really enjoyed this! When using fresh pasta, the pasta will absorb all the sauce which makes it really tasty! I like the contrast between the salty prosciutto and the sweetness of the orange. I've already done it twice!

The recipe for the pasta is now my go-to. I toss them all in the stand mixer and only kneed for a couple minutes at the end. I've made the pasta twice this week to standing ovations. Topped with a little white truffle, Parmesan, sauteed mushrooms onions wine and chevre. The pasta is unbelievably soft and melts in your mouth!

Um, you've got to be crazy not to give this four forks! I used whole wheat pasta, olive oil instead of butter and left out the pepper. It was decadent. I loved every bite that hit my mouth. How big was the orange for you that thought there was too much orange? I'd say I squeezed about 1/2 C of juice and it was perfect. The combination of prosciutto, orange and cream already sounds incredible. Eating it all at once was heavenly. Thank you David Downie! http://homesandbabies.blogspot.com/2011/08/heaven-on-earth-pasta.html

This is the basis of something really good, but the large quantity of orange juice made it very sweet--almost like a dessert pasta. Maybe Meyer lemon or some kind of sour orange would work? Not sure if those would be so acidic as to curdle the cream, but worth a try because this is really too sweet for most adults, I think. Otherwise, I wouldn't say it's bland as some reviewers said, but it could be more complex. A little garlic or shallot, or stock instead of pasta water, would improve it.

Very yummy. The fresh orange keeps the dish from feeling heavy, which is easy when pasta, cream and prosciutto are involved. I agree with A Cook From Ottawa- browning the prosciutto doesn't seem to add that much. To make it heartier, I added a fried egg. Heaven.

Truly delicious, and so easy. How anyone can think it was bland is beyond me. I doubled the prosciutto and I think browning it actually adds to the flavor of the whole dish. I made homemade fresh pasta and also added half a pound of bay scallops to make it even more interesting. The orange was subtle but detectable. Raves all around. A definite keeper.

Very good, very easy. I like it better if you don't brown the prosciutto though, browning it seems to kill the salty meaty flavours.

I made this dish exactly as described including fresh pasta. I found it excellent. It reminded me very much of a dish I ate years ago in a restaurant that had bacon-wrapped shrimp in place of the prosciutto. I will try this variation next time to see. This dish was lovely as is though.

This has become a comfort food for our household.... slightly reminiscent of macaroni and cheese or fettuccine alfredo, but with a sophisticated smoothness, a lovely salty prosciutto, and a subtle refreshing essence of orange. We used whole wheat pasta. The orange juice & zest, freshly grated parmesan and freshly ground pepper are key ingredients.

We enjoyed it very much and it was quick & very easy to put together. I used dried pasta and am sure it will improve with fresh pasta since with relatively mild flavors, the pasta shines through. I served it with salad with very light vinaigrette so as not to overwhelm the admittedly light orange flavor in the pasta.

I thought this pasta was wonderful, although I did adapt it slightly with the addition of peas and toasted pine nuts for added color and texture. Blogged it here: http://newfinmysoup.blogspot.com/2011/05/fettuccine-with-prosciutto-peas-and.html

With fresh tagliatelle (and a perfect Minneola tangelo), this dish was surprising and a treat. If you can't do fresh pasta, I think it will fall flat.

I made this twice last month, it is delish! The oragne is just enough to make it diffrent and the salty prosciutto a nice blend with the sweet. I used fresh pasta (I think that is key)and doubled the amount of prosciutto.

I'm surprised that this dish hasn't gotten better reviews. It exceeded my expectations -- I found it flavorful and refreshing and, best of all, dead easy. I'll be keeping this in mind for weeknight summer meals.

Very bland. Maybe orange juice concentrate or Grand Marnier would have helped but I won't be finding out.

Tried this it was ok. It was kinda blah...I could pick up on the orange but I was the only one who kinda liked it. Not sure what else it needs. I'm not an alfredo fan.

This was pretty disappointing. It was quick and easy to make, but the flavors were very bland. The orange flavor is very mild, so the dish turns out like a fairly oily fettuccine alfredo. I felt that some fresh herbs or vegetables to create more textural contrast would have helped, but I would not make this again.
