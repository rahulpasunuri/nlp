This was ok only. I think next time if I have leftover pasta, I will just eat leftover pasta instead of going to this effort for not much yummy-payoff. Was not a hit with me or anyone else in my family, won't make it again.

I just finished making this recipe for the first time. It was delicious. I had some left over cooked manicotti shells and some sauce. I took some kitchen scissors and cut the manicotti shells very thin to approximate cooked spaghetti. It worked beautifully. It was quick, easy and tasty. I will definately make it again.

This is a good recipe. I make a similar frittata. What I do is take leftover spaghetti with marinara sauce, cut it up, add eggs, peas, mozzarella, romano cheese, salt pepper and garlic powder to make a thick batter. Then I fry it in vegetable oil to make frittata patties.
