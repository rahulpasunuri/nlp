I have been making this soup for ages. Have made it as stated. Fabulous after tweaking. Skip the celery, carrot, garlic and onion. No loss. Substitute the unsweetened coconut milk and sweetened condensed milk for 1 -15 oz can Goya coconut milk and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Double the spices (seriously). Add 1/2 tsp cumin and 5 jiggers Franks Hot Sauce. Add 1 sweet potato, and 2 white potatoes, peeled, cubed and par-cooked in the microwave for 5 minutes. Add 1 -15 oz can Cannellini beans. Puree only half if you like chunky soup, or all for smooth. So good with grilled cheese.

I agree with other reviewers. This recipe, as is, is missing something. I added a little maple syrup, cayenne and then ginger. It's better now but it's still missing something savory. I put lots of salt and pepper in too. It's a good basic recipe but I have made better pumpkin soups.

I'd agree with the others who have commented that this is a good start for a great soup, but it needs changes. For one, 3/4 cup banana is TOO MUCH BANANA! It overwhelms the dish. It did mellow out by day two, but still I'd say about 1/3 cup at most would work. If I make this again I'll use only two or three slices. Also, the dish needs heat. When I serve it in individual bowls I'll add siracha (sic), but next time I'll put in actual chili pepper. Finally, the spice amounts should be doubled and salt added. Oh, and next time I'll look for another way for that touch of sugar -- why open a whole can of condensed milk when so little is needed? Unless you'll use it right away, better to use a sub.

Followed this recipe exactly, except substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth (for my vegetarian friends), increased the cinnamon, whole cloves and bay leaves, and added a sprinkling of ground cloves with the salt and pepper at the end. Definitely did not think it was too sweet. Served it in shot glasses as an hors d'oeuvre. A big hit and pretty easy to make--this one is a keeper.

While the banana worried me, it is indeed a key ingredient. Based on many of the reviews, I decided to ignore the proportions of the recipe and play it by ear since I like my soups on the thicker side. I made the soup with all the ingredients listed, except I swapped roasted butternut squash for carrots, used fat free condensed milk, fresh sage (not dried) and veggie stock. It came out OK but I knew it could be improved so I kept "fixing" it until it was pretty good, though not my best soup ever. I added a LOT more spice, especially cinnamon, corriander, two extra bayleaf, and nutmeg. Salt, salt, salt! Also added some maple syrup (perhaps a mistake??) and a healthy splash of cognac. I served it a dallop of fat free greek yogurt and some crispy sage (fresh sage fried in butter). After eating half the bowl, I kept adding stuff from the fridge to liven it up. Although I admit it sounds disgusting, parmesan cheese did make a nice change. If I make it again, I might make homemade toasted croutons from artisan bread with parmesean cheese. I have one bowl left for tomorrow and I plan to make a balsamic reduction and drizzle it on top. Some kind of toasted goat cheese croutons might be good too. I'm glad I made this soup, but the recipe provides only a base to play with rather than a finished product.

All in all, this was a great base recipe for pumpkin soup. Because the title was "Spiced Pumpkin Soup" I thought it would be a bit more flavorful. Once I was done, I found the soup to be a bit too bland and sweeter than I would have liked. I added some additional spices (extra curry powder, cinnamon, sage and crushed red pepper flakes) as well as a bit of Siracha for that underlying kick. Topped it off with a bit of plain yogurt and it was great. Although a bit bland to start, absolutely delish with a bit of modification!

Rating: 4
This is fabulous. I wish I had not heeded the reviews saying it's too sweet. I made it as directed except without the sweetened condensed milk, and definitely wanted it sweeter (so added about 3T maple syrup at the end). West Indians do love their "sweet milk" though, so I'm going to try it with that - to taste, not adding the full amount to start - next time. (I was able to puree the first round of veg in the blender too, by adding some of the broth to the blender jar. Also - don't be dumb like me, actually wait for the final soup to cool before pureeing! Scald marks notwithstanding, this is a keeper recipe.)

Granted I didn't have all the ingredients (celery, bay leaves, sage, curry, cilantro, banana) it was really good. It was thicker than I expected. I did the whole onion like others suggested and freshly baked pumpkin. I'm just starting my baby on solids and she LOVES this and prefers it over applesauce. I will definitely make this again not only for her but for us as well, it's just a perk to not prepare 2 separate dishes.

Too sweet! Use less banana than recipe says, maybe 1/4 of a banana and unsweetened condensed milk.

This was an excellent soup. I did not use the sweetened condensed milk and substituted maple syrup. I added salt, cumin and cayenne pepper as recommended by previous reveiwers. I thought it needed a little more color and a definite taste so I added smoked paprika. I did not use the curry powder, as I do not care for it- definitely will make it again. It was a hit at my house!

Fantastic - a pumpkin soup memories are made of & the aroma will transport your soul to the Islands. Thanksgiving meets the West Indies. I roasted a small sugar pumpkin first so the concentrated flavor could better shine through the aromatics. Added the spice palette to the vegetable sauté in the last minute to release their oils. Used 1/3 cup powdered coconut milk (by Maggi) and added directly to the broth, and substituted agave nectar for the nasty sweetened condensed stuff. This recipe is redolent with flavors of the Caribbean, but curiously no heat is added, so I added ginger to ratchet it up a notch. I quadrupled the recipe and used only 1 banana and the balance was just right. Notes for next time - try with sweet potato. Add cumin and cayenne. Sprinkle bowls of soup with toasted coconut shavings. p.s. Remove the clove and bay leaf before blending!

I rated this four forks because a) I happened to have a chicken carcas handy thus made my own broth, and b) I picked up a couple of butternut squash at the Half Moon Bay pumpkin festival. Fabulous! Since I rarely cook, I doubled the recipe to freeze 3 pints. By the way, I initially used my Cuisinart but didn't like the consistency--somewhat coarse. I reprocessed in the blender (30 seconds a batch), and it came out velvety smooth with flavors well integrated.

4 forks...with some modifications: 1/2 banana 4 C chicken broth 3 to 3 1/2 C pumpkin (purchased whole and boiled, then pureed) NO sweetened condensed milk, but substituted 1/4 C sour cream with 3 - 4 TBLS maple syrup Lots of salt (along with other generous amounts of the other spices listed) I served this soup this weekend to my friends and family and everyone licked their bowls! It was so YUMMY! One of my new favorite recipes. I'm making this again (and doubling the recipe) this weekend!

This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe as my bf kept begging for it after the first time. First time I used Hubbard squash, roasted in the oven first and this time I used butternut also roasted (for some reason cooking pumpkin is hard to find...) I don't exactly follow the measurements , just sautee the first 6 ingredients, add some broth, the spices, a small amount of condensed milk, half a can of coconut milk and the chopped up roasted squash and lightly simmer until soft. I leave the bay leaf in and throw a cinnamon stick in instead of ground cinnamon. I remove them and use my immersion blender to puree the soup. Then I add more coconut milk and or condensed milk depending on the taste as some squash are sweeter than others. I also use curry paste instead of powderand I add a lot cause we love curry.

Rating: 3
I only used 4 cups of broth, and added an extra cup of pumpkin for more flavor. I substituted heavy cream for the sweetened condensed milk, and I'm glad I did, because it still seemed very sweet. After doubling most of the spices and adding a lot of salt, it turned delicious. With a little sour cream stirred in at the end, it is even better!

Rating: 3
This is the third time I've used a recipe to make pumpkin soup, and finally, I found something that tastes great. I added a little bit of maple syrup and some sour cream to balance out the sweetness and spice of the soup. I also added some cayenne pepper, the spice really rounded out the soup. At the end I threw in some large couscous, and really made a meal out of it. I think the only thing I'd do differently is add more pumpkin next time as the pumpkin flavor wasn't as prominent as I was hoping.

Perhaps my favorite soup I've made from this website! Instead of canned pumpkin (bleh) I used a large/medium acorn squash, cut in half, broiled and then contents scraped out (amounted to 2.5 cups). That alone probably goes a long way. I also used fresh homemade vegetable stock (recipie from The Silver Spoon) instead of chicken. One more thing? Instead of condensed milk, I sweetened some cream with maple syrup. I cannot overstate how good this soup is. The banana is absolutely key, but you probably don't want to use one that's too brown. Served at a dinner party to rave reviews from my fellow food snobs and laypersons alike.

This was very good. I hollowed out a large pumpkin, using fresh pumpkin, instead of canned. And then I used the pumpkin shell as a soup terrine. I tripled the recipe, but didn't triple the coconut milk, since it has such a large amount of saturated fat. Will definitely make it again.

After reading all the rave reviews, I was pretty excited to try this soup but it was not what I expected. The only thing I didn't have was the groud allspice but I don't think it should make a big difference in taste. This is not the type of flavor I enjoy in a soup. And it was way too liquidy for my own taste. I added more pumpkin puree to thicken it and it still had a 'weird taste' that I didn't enjoy. Plus the brownish color really put me off...

Awesome Pumpkin Soup! I make it vegan by using Earth Balance Butter Spread instead of butter; McKay's Chicken Style Seasoning to make the broth; and soy milk with some brown sugar instead of condensed milk. I always use fresh sweet pumpkin or butternut squash. And I throw all ingredients into the pot, cook until pumpkin is soft, and then use an immersion blender to blend it. Saves time and hassle.

This soup came out a little thinner than I expected. I didn't have a banana so I left it out and I substituted milk and honey for the sweetened condensed. Also I had to add a lot more curry powder and salt and pepper to get a rich flavor. My husband liked to dip bread into it.

Super soup. Made it for my cooking club and they hammered me until I emailed the recipe - no easy feat since it had to be converted to metric measure and translated to French! Truthfully, translating the recipe was harder than making the soup. I made a starburst in the center of each bowl with creme fraiche and garnished the center of the starburst with cooked chopped chestnuts. It was beautiful as well as delicious.

This soup is outstanding, at once both sweet and savory. Yum! I deviated from the recipe by using light coconut milk, but other than that it's terrific as written. Oh, and I also added a squirt of Sriracha hot chile sauce, which helped cut the sweetness and gave it a great extra zing (but not enough that it was actually 'hot'). Fantastic!

Incredible... rich, and layered with flavour. I didn't find the soup sweet at all. And this despite the fact I was out of dried sage, and so substituted some mace. I didn't bother with cilantro either, as I had none on hand. I used a whole can of lite coconut milk as well. I would definitely make this again, and would be pleased to serve this soup to company, if I can manage not to hoard it all for myself...

Made this for Halloween, everyone loved it. Used fresh sweet pumpkin, would'nt use the condenced milk next time as I upped the coconut milk to a full can.

First off, this soup was delicious. However, I agree with the reviewer who stated that it had too much going on and tasted like liquid pumpkin pie... until I made some simple adjustments. To deal with the flavor overload and also because my soup was a bit too thick, I added extra chicken broth and coconut milk. This improved matters greatly, and everyone at my Thanksgiving-in-July dinner enjoyed the soup. Also, I used fresh mint in place of the cilantro and it was great, although I would have used cilantro if I'd had some. I'd definitely make this soup again, definitely with low-fat ingredients next time (hadn't thought of that!).

This is delcious. I liked it better the second day. Next time, I'll cook the carrots for a bit first, then add the onions and celery. The carrots didn't soften before the onion and celery were mush.

I made this for a family halloween party and it was a pretty big hit (for a family that's not terribly into trying things that are new). I just served it in cups as an appetizer for this informal gathering, so it was easy for people to have as much or as little as they wanted. I think I would leave out the curry powder next time because it had a tendency to overwhelm the rest of the flavors in the soup. Maybe the curry powder I used was too strong a mix, but with all the other things going on in this soup, I don't think it needs it. I will try it without next time and report my findings. Still, a good autumn soup, even some of the kids ate some.

In the category of cold-weather soups/stews, it is hard to beat this recipe. Easy to make with relatively accessible ingredients. I made with fresh pumpkin and only 4 C broth. My husband is not a fan of coconut, but loved the soup and was unable to identify either the coconut or the banana. All the unusual flavors combine beautifully into a slightly sweet, smooth and deeply appealing pumpkin flavor. I served with pumpkin-cut-out puff-pastry with Gruyere. Will be making this yearly.

I served this to my family with three teenage children (who aren't shy about trying new things), and I was the only one who enjoyed it. I think it was too far out, being more of a sweet - rather than savory soup. I didn't realize how much sweetness the banana and coconut would add.

Rating: 3
Excellent the first day, but the flavors seemed to dissipate somewhat thereafter. Despite being a cilantro lover, I preferred the soup without the cilantro garnish. I think pumpkinseed oil and creme fraiche might work better. Unsweetened coconut juice would probably also be an adequate substitute for the coconut milk, but I haven't tried it myself. To ensure a smooth, creamy consistency, I would recommend using a food processor for the initial chopping (which speeds up cooking time) and a blender for the final pureeing.

Great! I think I'd rather garnish it with some cream fraiche and a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg. I did not care much for the cilantro. we just had it for a quick dinner, but it'd be great for a dinner party. Also, I found coconut juice at the store. It had viturally no fat, as compared to the high fat content in the coconut milk. The soup tasted great with that substitution.

This soup was flavorful, though the consistency wasn't as smooth as I hoped. Next time I will cook the vegies longer to ensure they are softer and maybe that will help.
