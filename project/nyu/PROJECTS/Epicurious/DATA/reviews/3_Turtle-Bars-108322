These were so easy and turned out great. I also used light brown sugar bc thats all i had on hand. Everyone loved them :0)

I make these all of the time. I never use dark brown sugar because the turtle bars are too dark and there is no differenciation between the layers. use light brown sugar. also, i use cashew halves and pieces instead of pecans. the result is excellent and I am asked to make them constantly. Be sure to boil the caramel as it says, or it will be too goopy, and will not set properly.

I made this recipe using a variety of suggestions from previous reviewers, and they turned out much better than the first time I made them a year ago. I mixed the butter into the flour and sugar by hand for the crust, in order to avoid the butter chunks others complained of. I also used light brown sugar throughout, and baked the caramel for only 12 minutes (it was very bubbly, but not dark). For the top, I melted some chocolate "chipits" with some toffee bits (Skor or Heath Bar) to give a little extra crunch. I also added some cream to the mix, making the topping more like a fudge than a solid chocolate layer. If you do this, just make sure to let the caramel layer cool for a while first so it can hold its own while the chocolate is spread.

I followed the recipe to the letter yet the product was anything but good. The crust was very dry and lacked any resemblance to a turtle.

I've made this recipe numerous times and everyone loves the results! A few hints: I only baked it 10 min with the caramel, not 20 like the recipe suggested. I think if you bake it for 20, the cookie crust will dry out. I also use a whole bag of good quality chocolate chips rather than just 5.5 ounces (just makes a thicker chocolate layer). I also chill the cookies for about 25-25 minutes to let the chocolate completely set.

This dessert is so easy to make and so delicious! Every time I make these bars people ask me for the recipe, and my boyfriend begs me to make them for him. Would give five forks if possible!

I loved this recipe. When it was time to add the choc chips though i shut off the oven, sprinkled them on with about 2x more than reccomended and put them back in the warm, but not on, oven until they melted. I expected the bottom to be more like a cookie, but it was good this ay

I love this recipe, but I made a few changes - I used half regular sugar and half brown sugar in the crust and it turns out more cookie textured. I also double the amount of chocolate for the topping

I agree with the previous cook, too greasy on the bottom and somewhat lacking in flavor. Just not very tasty as cookies go.

Way too sweet on top and too greasy on bottom. Yuck!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and am not happy with how they turned out at all. They are way too sweet, almost sickeningly so. Also the crust is too buutery/greasy. When I cooled them in the fridge the butter now shows as white beads all throughout the crust. Yuck! Easy- but not good.

Rating: 1
Though these bars were easy to amke I am not happy with them at all. The crust is very greasy and when I cooled them in the fridge the butter hardened and beaded up causing an ugly appearance. They are also way to sweet for my tast. i feel like I'm eating pure sugar with no distincy flavors at all. Would never make them again and followed recipe exactly as written.

Very easy and delicious; these were part of my holiday cookie rotation last year. For those concerned about the richness factor, the bars (a misnomer, actually)are cut into itty-bitty squares, so a little goes a long way!

Made these for the first time. Very easy. I made them in a glass pan and they came out just fine. I let them come to room temperature prior to cutting them. I also used an entire 12 ounce bag of chocolate chips-- guirdelli-- I agree with other cooks, they are rich. I thought they came out excellent-- I have been eating 2 a day since I made them. They remind me of little pieces of pecan pies. I chopped the pecans into very small pieces and thought this worked just fine. So, other than adding more chocolate chips, I would not change a thing!

Have made this many times and it always comes out perfect! I get many requests for the recipe. I have also increased the caramel ingredients to 1 cup sugar, butter and 4 T. cream for a bit thicker caramel layer!

These were good, but didn't turn out as expected. The crust wasn't firm enough to keep the hot caramel from soaking in. My finished product was a carmel/cookie like crust with a chocolate nut top. Good, but not turtle-like.

Yum! I made these as directed. I think they're tastier at room temperature because then they're a bit softer. I brought them to work today, and by noon, they were almost all gobbled up.

My turtle bars were rock-hard - caramel became more like very hard toffee. Still tasty, will probably try it again but cook for less time during the caramel baking phase. I would leave the crust as-is, it's great.

Easy, delicious and cute-looking! What more could you ask for?

Of course we ate them...who could toss out chocolate and caramel? However, I have had much better bars. These could be improved visually and tastewise by a whiter cookie base, a more standard shortbread that doesn't reveal butter beads on the bottom after chilling. They need that contrast to the exceptionally sweet caramel.

Rating: 3
alternative - You can use graham crackers as a base lining instead, line them on buttered tin foil in a cookie tin so it covers the whole tin(tin should have a lip), and pour the heated butter brown sugar mixture on top and bake, then take out and spread semi sweet chocolate chips on top - I like it better with the graham crackers!

Wow! Amazing. Rich, goey and delicious. I actually chopped the nuts very finely so even non-nut lovers would enjoy it. I also doubled the chocolate. I might use a little less next time,but they are rich and yummy.

Easy and impressive. First time for me making caramel, and I was disappointed that it stayed cloudy and bubbly--don't know what else I should do. But they tasted great, and I doubled the chocolate, which hid the look of the caramel. Chopped the nuts, and was afraid the chocolate would be hard to spread over nuts, but it was fine.

Delicious! These are easy to make and have received rave reviews every time I make them. Serve in small pieces because they are rich -- as several other reviewers already mentioned.

Agree with adding additional chocolate. These are rich and yummy. Very easy and quick to put together.

Wow, what a find! These are easy to make and just yummy. I would recommend many of the modifications I've seen in the reviews: melting the chocolate chips with 1/4 cup of cream, and using plenty of chocolate (I used a 12-ounce bag); also, serving the bars chilled lessens the impact of all the butter. The reviewer who noted that he/she could not eat more than one or two has a point in that these are really rich - think more candy than bar cookie. If you slice them small though they are amazing! - I can't keep a pan of them around more than a day or so. And finally I must concur with the reviewer who said that self-deprivation is pointless - dieter or not, one of these decadent little bites is sure to put a smile on your face and not have any long-lasting negative health impacts. So enjoy! :)

This dish is very easy to make. It is very rich and you can only eat one small cookie at a time. I would recommend this when you need to bring a dish to a function, party, etc but not if you want to make something to have around the house to snack on or pack in lunches.

This recipe was quick & easy. I would use more caramel than it called for would chop the nuts so that it's easier to cut the next time.

Very simple recipe and very sweet. I lightly sprayed the pan with cooking spray, so the bars came out of the pan very easily and they were not greasey at all. I also added more chocolate chips. The 20 minutes of baking time was way to much. My carmel was dark and bubbley after only 10 - 12 minutes. I also needed to chill the bars for about 45 minutes until the chocolate set. The bars flew off the serving plate!!

This recipe could not be any easier. I used more chocolate chips than it called for. I consider this more of a candy, to be cut into small pieces, very rich to eat a large piece. I will probably chop the nuts the next time rather than using the pecan halves.

These are GREAT! A success for both groups I brought them to this weekend! I will note that I made one batch in a metal pan and one in a glass pan and the metal pan was definitely better. When it came time to cut, I was able to lift the whole thing out and cut with a sharp knife. The glass one was still okay, but it was harder to cut and remove from the pan.

This was an easy recipe to make. Enjoyed the bars except would not bake the caramel so long. I think 20 minutes was much too long because it became so brittle. Will try 10-15 minutes next time.

Gotta agree with the person from Nebraska (that's a first!). Yes, this is a ton of fat if you are going to eat the whole batch, or plan on making this everyday for a month. Americans are fat because of too many processed foods, lack of exercise, and obscene portion sizes. The occasional Turtle Bar is not the problem. Live well, but in moderation. Constant self-deprivation takes its toll on one's health as well - mentally and physically.

New York, this recipe makes 70 Turtles so the amount of butter and chocolate chips in the recipe is NOT that much. Get over your pseudo-self-righteous self!

Three sticks of butter, 3/4 cup chocolate chips (and some want to add more!!). No wonder Americans are as fat as pigs.

Oh my goodness..... I made this recipe for my wife. She was having a Southern Living Home Party and I am the cook in the house. I decided to try this. I didn't have any of the problems I have seen some people mention. Perhaps they didn't use the full 2 cups of flour? Mine were not greasy at all. I made these in a metal pan as instructed but used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and let it chill in the fridge for an hour before I cut them. I cut them with a large knife because it they were pretty hard to cut since I left them in the fridge for so long. Everyone raved about how good they were and said they wished their husbands made stuff that was that good! This one was a real winner. EXCELLENT RECIPE! I will make it over and over. I am shocked at some of the bad reviews. I don't see how someone could say anything bad about these except for the fact that they didn't follow the recipe.

These were tasty, but it's hard for something not to be tasty when it contains this much butter, whipping cream and chocolate. The crust was way too greasy and I couldn't eat more than one or two withough feeling kind of sick.

The recipe sounded delicious but after reading the mixed reviews, I was a little hesitant. Everything turned out okay. I did make a couple of changes to the recipe. I sprayed my pan with butter cooking spray and had no problems with sticking. I used a full cup of chocolate chips instead of 3/4 c. The extra 1/4 c. helped ensure I had good coverage on top. Very rich!!!! A glass of milk is a must.

These Turtle Bars are so delicious I made them for a family reunion and they were gone in less than 30 minutes! I was shocked because I had to turn around and make them again for a wedding, a graduation, and my boyfriends family gathering!!

I can't believe anyone had trouble removing them from the pan with that much butter! My results were a horrid, greasy nightmare. I think if the recipe had said to use cold butter for the crust, rather than room temperature, that the crust would have come together better. Yuck - definitely won't bother with this again.

These bars are fabulous! I will make them again and again. They have instantly become one of my family's favorites. I did, however, line the pan with foil and sprayed it with Pam so I could turn them out on a cutting board and cut into small squares. Really great!!! A+

i've made these twice now, and both times everyone loved them and clamored for the recipe. i found them easiest to cut when the chocolate had JUST set. i made the initial cut after ~25 mintues in the fridge, and then cut again and removed from the pan after completely set. i did not experience problems removing them from the pan. only warning - these bars are VERY rich!

Very good. I substituted salted butter for the unsalted butter and lined the pan with foil. The salted butter added to the flavor and the foil made the removal and cutting easier and cleaner.

I would make these again, but I would add a pinch of salt to the flour layer and to the caramel layer. They are bland without. I would also wait 10 minutes or so before aprinkling on the chocolate chips.

These are great turtle bars. I have made them 3 times now and given the recipe away several times as well. Everyone loves them. It is true they are difficult to get out of the pan but it only messes up one. I take them out in strips and then cut them on a cutting board. Definitely remove and cut them after cooling because if you leave them in the pan overnight it is more difficult. I was thinking that foil or parchment lining the pan may help make it easier to remove. I will certainly make them again. Yum.

The dish was easy to prepare but only a so-so result. The instructions on cooling time were not at all accurate. The caramel was still molten when it came out of the oven. Sprinkling the choclate chips then caused them to disappear into the top. So I waited a few minutes for it to cool before sprinkling with additional chocolate. The recipe says to cool in the fridge for 20 minutes to set the chocolate - not nearly enough time. They were also very difficult to get out of the ungreased pan - a real problem since I had intended to give them to a neighbor. I'll not bother with these again, and I highly suggest lining the pan with foil first if you give these a try.
