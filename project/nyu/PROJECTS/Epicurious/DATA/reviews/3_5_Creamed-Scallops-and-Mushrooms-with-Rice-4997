delicious and easy to make. This was my first time cookig scallops and after this recipe I am confident to cook them again. The mushroom cream sauce turned out delicious and takes no time. I served the scallops for pasta for my boyfriend and sauted spinach for myself.

I was a little heavy-handed with the cayenne pepper but my husband loved it that way. I would add more mushrooms next time and maybe a little sherry. Use the liquid to make a roux with the flour before adding. Other than that - quick, easy, and delicious!

I gave this 4 forks because it's so incredibly easy and absolutely delicious! Took less than 15 minutes and that includes waiting for the water to boil for the angel hair pasta I fixed instead of the rice. But the scallop recipe I followed to the T and it was scrumptious!

Don't make this recipe if you are an amateur. The best thing I can say for it is: if you know what you are doing, and you use the absolute best- quality ingredients, you will get something that is just OK. If you want to go ahead with it, use some garlic, a tsp. of tomtao paste and a little sherry. Otherwise, too bland. Also, never put raw flour into a sauce; make a roux first.

If I could, I'd really give this recipe 2 1/2 forks. It was pretty good, but it wasn't fantastic even after I added garlic and white wine. It was definitely an easy dish to make, but I don't know if I'd make it again.

I substituted onion powder for the scallions, which are dangerous to eat due to problem from several months ago. I thought the sauce was good but when my husband tasted it, I realized I recognized the flavor! Cream of Mushroom soup! Nothing more than a good cream of mushroom with slight undertones of red pepper. Would only make again if I could not find something better.

I gave this two forks and said I would make it again only because my lady said she liked it. My taste buds must have been having a bad day because I found this entree to be bland. I made this recipe almost exactly as shown, with exception of adding some white wine and garlic. I cannot recommend this recipe to anyone.

This is a wonderful and very simple recipe to make. I used half and half along with a half sherry, half clam juice mixture and it came out wonderful. I served it on a bed of spinach and it seemed to work well. Next time I will add some garlic for a little extra kick.

Very tasty, I also added some garlic and substitued the clam juice with white wine. I used red pepper flakes (just a little), I needed more sauce, so I added a little more cream. Soooo, tasty. My hubby loved it. I definately, will make it again.

This is a great simple recipe to make; not at all time consuming. It tasted great and we will most certainly be making this again. I used half n' half rather than whipping cream.

Family loved this. Fairly easy to make. I would put over pasta instead of rice next time. Great sauce.

I highly recommend this dish. The scallops were tender and delicious. I added a bit of garlic while cooking the mushrooms/onions, and also a bit of white wine with the clam juice. I used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Very tasty and will make again.

Wonderful. I added a couple cloves of minced garlic just before the green onion. I also added juice from a half of a lemon and some white wine to the sauce. I, too, used fat-free half and half instead of the whipping cream, and I served it over hot linguini. Great!

This was great! I added a clove of garlic, a splash of wine and also used the nonfat half and half with great results.

Easy,tasty,creamy and rich! I made brown rice which I think has more flavor and it tasted great with the scallops and sauce. My picky family liked it also!

This was excellent and quite easy. I used bay scallops which worked very well. Even drained, there was liquid from the scallops which I reserved and used instead of the clam juice, 1 tsp.of powdered chicken-flavored bouillon for seasoning instead of salting the scallops. Mixing the flour with cold water would be a good idea. I also made it low fat by substituting fat free evaporated milk, undiluted, for the whipping cream. The result was creamy and wonderful.

This was very easy and good. I added a little sherry towards the end and it made it taste like a seafood newberg. Next time I think I will mix the seafood like crab or shrimp also. A nice dinner for company if you are short on time.

I used raw frozen scallops and fresh prawns. I added some white wine to the green onion, mushroom mixture and added extra cayenne. Very easy dish.

This dish was delicious but no garlic??? I added 4 med. cloves and substituted red pepper flakes for the cayenne pepper. I also used fat free half & half instead of cream. I think this would be great if prawns were used. Very yummy!

Delicious. I served it over angel hair pasta which was perfect. I recommend disolving the flour in a little cold water first in case the mushrooms make a lot of liquid which will cause the flour to get lumpy. Made it several times and everyone loved it. Very easy to make, 45 minutes from start to finish.

Great sauce- my husband doesn't like scallops but I thought it was fantastic. Will try with shrimp next time.

Having been allergic to many types of fish and most types of shellfish in my youth, my experiences with seafoods throughout my life have been quite limited. Consequently, this is the first scallop dish I have prepared. Being more than hesitant about trying this recipe, I can tell you I was more than pleased with the results. Try this, I loved it.

loved it. I made it with Spagetti which wasn't that great of a complement. The flavor of the sauce is delicious. I am making it again tonight with rice.

WOW, this is my favorite scallop recipe EVER. I added some chevre to the sauce and used creme fraiche instead of whipping cream (which I didn't have.) There was nothing left! Will definitely make this again and again.

I thought this recipe was delicious, but instead of serving it over rice I substituted pasta. It worked perfectly. I will certainly make this recipe again.
