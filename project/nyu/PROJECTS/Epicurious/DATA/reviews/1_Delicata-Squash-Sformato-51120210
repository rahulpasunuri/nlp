The unusual group of ingredients intrigued me. I made it almost exactly as written, and sadly, I disliked it so much that I gave most to my dogs (who thought it was pretty tasty). My only changes were to use butternut squash instead of delicata, and I used about 1/4 tsp dried thyme for the fresh. The biggest offender, in my opinion, is the balsamic vinegar. It was a seriously off note. If you aren't wild about balsamic, try leaving the vinegar out entirely, maybe the nutmeg too, and cut way down on the maple syrup (the squash puree was sweet enough on its own). Perhaps increase the cheese but I'd stay with the Jack as called for in the recipe. The creme fraiche is a nice touch but I wonder if greek yogurt would work just as well if not better.
