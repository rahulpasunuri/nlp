Exceptional for an easy basic pie. Every year I ask my husband, "have you seen Italian plums yet???" My family and friends wait for it each and every season.

With a little experimentation, I had to adjust this recipe for the filling by adding at least a cup of sugar and not using lemon juice. Otherwise the filling was too tart.

I made this pie yesterday and served it to several men. It was exceptionally good. I would recommend using 1 1/4 lb. of prune/plums but keep the other ingredients the same. Also it needed 10 minutes more baking time to get the crust golden brown.

I was the recipient of about 6# of Italian plums from a neighbor's trees and have made several recipes in the last few days. This is a definite winner. It's simple, looks attractive, and tastes wonderful. I used a little less sugar than called for because they are very ripe and it came out perfectly.

Can't wait for Italian plums to appear each year so I can make this. My only changes are to use more plums (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds) and a little less lemon juice. Sweet, tart and fabulous!

I made it for the first time during Christmas last year and it was a big hit with friends and family.

Love this, can't fault it, totally no fuss, good strong plummy flavour.

This didn't hold the same appeal as other fruit pies, it was fine but nothing special.

Very good, very easy and fast. I had about four more plums than it called for and I added them. It was not too many, so I would suggest adding a few extra. I had to cook the tart about 10 minutes more than the recipe suggested.

Three years later, we still look with eager anticipation for the Italian Prune plums to show up at the store. A wonderfully delicious pie for the eve of Summer.

Not only did the pie look great, it was so delicious that I ate 2 huge slices in one sitting! The crust was easy to make. I recommend handling the crust as little as possible or else it gets soft -- roll it out as quickly as possible and get it on the pie plate. Next time, I would put a sheet of foil underneath the pie plate because some of the liquid bubbled over and the oven started to smoke. Next time, I'd like to make this pie with nectarines.

Simple and tasty! Works with red-fleshed plums as well, and the color is quite appetizing.
