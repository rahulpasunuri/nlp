I needed a pecan pie recipe without any dairy in it so this recipe was perfect. It was however not the easiest pecan pie to assemble, making caramel is such a mess. That being said, it was delicious and I don't think anyone could tell that there was not butter in it.

Very good recipe. Add a little (not too much) alcohol to your taste and you will be surprised what it will do. May need to add a bit more sugar if the alcohol has a bitter taste.

I used some fresh grated fennel instead of the anise seed. The pie was wonderful

Hey,where's the butter?? :)

the baking time caused the pecan filling to carmelize a little bit too much. Also, the spice was too dominant, but it was otherwise delicious.
