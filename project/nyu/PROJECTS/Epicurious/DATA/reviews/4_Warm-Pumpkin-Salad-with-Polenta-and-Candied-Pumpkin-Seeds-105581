Made this for friends on Saturday and we ate everything among the 4 of us. Huge hit with everyone: the mix of tastes and texture is great. Caramelizing the pepitas was quite difficult and after burning the caramel a first time, we roasted the seeds on their own and mixed them with the caramel which was done separately. Otherwise, you don't get the seeds to pop before the caramel burns. The polenta was pre-cooked and cooled the night before and fried last minute. I definitely recommend making it. It was our first time and the mix of textures between the creaminess on the inside, crunch on the outside is a great addition to the dish. Not too difficult if you spread preparation out over 2 days. Definitely worth it!

This is a great salad recipe. It is a lot of work but worth it! Great for a fall meal!

This was very tasty, but I never got around to eating the leftovers, so it didn't pass my craveability test. I did not make the polenta.

You have to be careful not to burn the pepitas but even scorched, they're pretty good. Skipping the polenta and tossing the squash, candied pepitas, and dressing with romaine and queso fresco is also really delicious.

This seemed like a great idea, but the results were not worth the effort. I had a hard time making the coating for the pumpkin seeds - I kept ending up with a lump of burnt sugary stuff surrounded by melted butter. Finally I just made some sugar-and-water syrup, reduced it a little, and added the spices.

I prepped everything a day in advance and what a wonderful meal. I intended to only have it as one of my smaller afternon meals but actually ate it twice during the day because it was so good. Everyone who has tried it in my home has enjoyed it. There are a lot of flavors and textures but none of them overpower another. Great combination of color, texture, sweet, crunchy, and creamy. A very light meal.

this was delicious. If you spread the work over two days it is easier. I used butternut squash and tossed it in oil, cider and maple syrup before roasting. I added fresh pomegranate seeds at the end. I would make this again and friends asked for the recipe.

Time consuming, but worth the effort! Excellent and delicious. We served this alongside Pork Tenderloin with Pomegranate Sauce, and it was a great pairing!

This is a really wonderful salad! Great combination of flavors. It was a bit tedious to make but worth the effort. A more simple version that is just as good is to make the salad with plain toasted pumpkin seeds and skip the polenta. Very easy and delicious.

Absolutely my new favorite. I made the seeds, and polenta the night before. I roasted the squash and made the vinagarette in the morning. Wasn't to hard to fry up the polenta and plate this while the guests were here. I may try to oven roast the polenta next time

My friends and family loved this salad for Thanksgiving dinner. I don't think the polenta is worth the effort but overall the different textures make this one a keeper for future occasions.

i made this expecting it to be great, but ended up thinking that all that time was wasted. and a good butternut squash wasted as well. the person i served it to, a big polenta fan, thought the mushiness of the polenta didn't blend well. the shallots also over powered the salad dressing.

A noteworthy fall salad. Save yourself some time and use a no-stir polenta recipe though (baked in the oven). I double the amount of sugar.

Delicous and different. The variety of textures and tastes combine well. I ended up with more pepitas than necessary and saved them for sandwiches and other salads. If you want to impress, make people full but not feel like absolute cows, this is a great dish.

Definitely spread out the cooking...it's time consuming. The seeds are fabulous.

This is a fantastic dish. A lot of work but well worth it. Spread the cooking over 2 days.
