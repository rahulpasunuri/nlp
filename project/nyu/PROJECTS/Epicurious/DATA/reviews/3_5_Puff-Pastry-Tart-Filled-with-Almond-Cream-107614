I took the advice of other people's comments and added more almond paste (a whole tube of it!) and then extra vanilla extract and almond extract. It was one of the best desserts I have ever had!

I found this very easy & very good. HOWEVER, either the oven temp is too high or the cooking time too long. Both times I have made this I had to pull it out of the oven early and remove burnt areas. Next time, I'll probably decrease both and keep a close eye on it.

I love this cake in France. This is an acceptable substitution for a quick homemade version. I used the cut off scraps of the pastry to make bite sized ones (they cook faster).

Ok. So, I made two of them at the same time. The first one didn't have quite enough filling and the second had too much (the top slid right off!). The edges didn't seal properly on either of them. However, they were ABSOLUTELY delicious and I will so be making this again!

I accidentally solved the dryness problem by putting both eggs in with the almond paste. The filling was just like an almond croissant at the bakery. If you add another egg, add a little more flour too so that the filling doesn't run out of the tart. Like everyone else, I also added more almond paste than the recipe called for. And I only baked it for half the time called for. Overall, there are too many mistakes in this recipe to give it more than two forks. However, with these changes, it is quite good and easy.

Well, I really wanted to love this recipe. It's so easy and pretty that I'll try it again but I found it to be a bit bland and somewhat dry. I loved the idea of hiding a bean inside - we all had fun with that. And I followed another reviewers suggestion and rolled the dough to 12 x 12 and spread on a layer of seedless raspberry jam. Still, it was lacking. Next time, I'll try the idea of sauteed pears or other fruit.

Very good, and easy to assemble. Did not cut, simply rolled out the dough to 12 x 12, baked it on buttered parchment paper. Topped the almond cream with ripe pears I had simmered in butter and amaretto. Followed baking instructions. It looked as if it had come from a fine bakery, and tasted wonderful. The pears and almond were a perfect match. It was so easy to make, I surely will make it again. I agree with adding more almond paste, only because I love it, but the recipe is truly quite good as it reads.

I love food with a gimmick. And apart from the fun of finding a bean, this dessert is also delicious! Add more almond paste than you think you'll need and it'll still be less sweet than you expect.

I couldn't find the almond paste ingredient anywhere, although I have read that it is available commercially. It was easy enough to make the paste myself, though. I made three of the galettes--two were traditional, and to the third one, I added quince preserves. These were really good, but I went overboard so a lot of fluid spilled out and burned on the baking sheet. Luckily, puff pastry is pretty forgiving and no one will notice that I had to scrape off some burnt bits! I think it will be a matter of trial and error, packing enough filling into this dessert for it to be tasty, but not so much that I end up with a mess!

This was relatively easy to make, and looked fantastic--the only problem with the tart is that it's a bit bland. If you make it, follow the advice of the other reviewers and add a layer of fruit or berry preserves. I found myself inserting sliced strawberries between the layers when snacking on leftovers.

Made this today for garden club and I got many unsollicted compliments. Super easy and quick to make.

Not difficult, and the pastry is wonderful, but I'm going to add more almond paste and extract next time -- the almond flavor was exceedingly subtle.

This was delicious. I added a layer of cherry compote under the almond cream. Be sure to use a big bean as they can be surprisingly difficult to find.

This was a wonderful recipe! I really loved it!With a cup of warm tea it was a great mini escape! Very well received by my husband who does not like dessert!

As wonderful as this was as a dessert it was awesome the next morning as a breakfast pastry.

I love this cake! Here in Luxembourg they make it for the epiphany, and I can't wait until just after Christmas when the patisseries start to sell these! Recipe is a good substitution for the real thing - especially when it's not the season. In Europe, they use intricate tiny ceramic pieces (in the shape of birds, animals - whatever!) in place of the beans, and whomever gets the prize wears the "kings hat"- a metallic paper crown that are sold with the cakes. To the reader who asked about substitutes - In Luxembourg it is also common to have an apple version - I haven't tried to make that yet, but to copy what they do here I would peel, core and chop apples, add sugar, cinnamon, perhaps a bit of water and tiny bit of lemon juice and cook slowly mashing with a masher until there are chunks, like a chunky apple sauce. You'd have to experiment a bit with quantities. Chill, and add that in place of the almond paste. My children who love apple pies prefer this version.

This recipe is ridiculously easy for how elegant it looks when it comes out of the oven. Though I liked the almond cream and will keep the recipe, I am tempted to fiddle with this from season to season (fill with fruit, for example?!)

Sorry to disagree, but this recipe certainly was not bland. I prepared it for a wine party and it was very well received. Certainly there is a level of simplicity but it tasted fabulous and got great reviews. I mean, it's a tradional French treat for a reason, right?

Good grief! Throw out puff pastry scraps? Never! You can always bake up leftovers like this. Kids love this kind of thing. Give them the baked scraps, some fresh sliced fruit, and a bit of whipped cream. Yum! Never mind, forget the kids.

The almond filling in this recipe is similar to that of England's Bakewell Tart. In anticipation of this I spread a layer of seedless raspberry jam before pouring the filling. Without the jam I fear the results would have been a bit bland. My results were yummy and the recipe easy. I think I'll add ground almonds to the filling next time I make it. Baking time after sprinkling with powdered sugar was only about 6 minutes.
