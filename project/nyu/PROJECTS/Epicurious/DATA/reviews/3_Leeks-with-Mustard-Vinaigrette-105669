This receipe was selected by the host of a gourmet cooking gathering. I love leeks and use them often but I have to say this was one of my least favorite recipes for them. The flavors and presenation seemed just ho hum to us.

I have tried leeks for quite a few years and I must say that this is the way to go.

This was delicious warm or cold. Will certainly make it again.
