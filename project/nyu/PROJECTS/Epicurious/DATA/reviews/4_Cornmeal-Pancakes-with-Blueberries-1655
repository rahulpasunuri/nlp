I love all things cornmeal related, and these pancakes tasted great. However, there were too many steps and too much work just for pancakes. The egg whites step seems like too much work somehow but it was definitely needed to thicken the runny batter. I only had skim milk on hand so i made some substitute buttermilk with lemon juice. I imagine the thickness of the batter would be improved with real buttermilk (or fake buttermilk made with whole milk). I also didn't use blueberries and the flavour of the unadulterated cake batter was really lovely. Still, next time i'll look for a simpler recipe.

After making a trip to the stone ground mill close to my son's house I purchased both cornmeal & buckwheat to prepare breakfast with the grandchildren. It was an experience that all enjoyed and a strong taste reminder to my son when we made the buckwheat waffles. My son & oldest grandson throughly enjoyed the shared task of the corncakes with the supurb stone ground cornmeal.

Good pancakes, but batter is runny which makes it a bit too much trouble to repeat.

If you like cornmeal items such as cornbread, you will likely love this. I will be cutting back on the blueberries next time - I found they overpowered the corn taste that I love. But otherwise, delicious breakfast fare.

Thick & yummy. I loved the whole grain texture and flavor, and they were great with syrup. I skipped the oven warming step and used soymilk instead of buttermilk, but all in all I really liked this recipe!

RE: Dry pancakes. Any time you use regular whole wheat flour to substitute, even for ww pastry flour, you must use less, because it absorbs more moisture.

My Mom and I both liked these better than regular pancakes but my husband thought they were too thick. I would definitely make them again. I enjoyed the extra texture.

I have made these for the family every Saturday for almost two years now; needless to say, we love them. To the cook from Los Angeles, try increasing the buttermilk or egg - ours are always moist, and I usually make half the recipe but use 2 eggs instead of 1 and a a half.

My pancakes were not very moist! After spending a couple of minutes in the oven at 200 (to keep warm), they became dry and crumbly, and they tasted more like cornbread than pancakes. Is there any way to make them more moist? I had to substitute whole wheat flour for pastry flour, which I'm sure changed the consistency somewhat.... Would make again, but disappointed in my experience.

I've been making these pancakes for years, ever since the printing date, and they are still my favorites. In fact, we just had them yesterday morning for breakfast. I wouldn't change a thing with the recipe. Once I added a teeny bit of orange oil to the batter which really made the flavor stand out, but I don't do that most of the time. Since there are only two of us in the house, I go ahead and make the rest of the batter and freeze the pancakes individually wrapped in plastic wrap. Makes for a nice quick "weekend morning-type" breakfast while heated in the oven or toaster oven in the morning prior to heading out to work.

Superbly light and flavorful pancakes. The cornmeal adds a bit of texture that makes these special.

These are really delicious but too much work (and too many dirty dishes) for pancakes. My husband loved them but said that I shouldn't make them again unless the Queen of England joins us for brunch!

Ihave used this recipe as well as the other cornmeal pancake recipe on Epicurious, and this one wins by a smidge. The other is little easier. Used to have cornmeal pancakes at Pancake Pantry in Nashville while in college. Just went back and this beat PP out hands down.

I am not always so keen about cornbread things, but this was really surprisingly great. An interesting take on the normal breakfast food.

Picked up some organic blueberries at the farmers market yesterday and always wanting to try a new receipe, this combination made for great pancakes this morning. REALLY GOOD!

Excellent pancakes and fairly easy to make. I can't even think of a way to improve them. I did have a very hard time finding whole grain pastry flour and settle for some other whole grain flour.

I've eaten these for several years and find them to be a great alternative to the traditional pancake. The texture, great flavors of corn and maple are reminiscent of southern breakfasts of my childhood. For variety this dish tastes great with apple butter instead of maple syrup.
