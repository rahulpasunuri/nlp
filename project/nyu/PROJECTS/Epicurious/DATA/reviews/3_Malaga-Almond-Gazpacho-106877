I make this recipe all the time and it's always a big hit - the biggest problem is that guests always want seconds and this truly makes only 4 servings. I don't bother peeling the grapes but sometimes halve them instead. If the garlic clove is too big it can be overpowering, so use half a clove.

What gives with the other reviews? I used the best ingredients (reserve Sherry vinegar, hojiblanca, fresh crab instead of shrimp) but the predominant flavors are half a cup of olive oil and water. This is simply bland beyond belief. I'm heading for Spain in February and will look for this at a restaurant and try to learn the magic incantation.

We were pleasantly surprised; quite a good soup. The peeled grapes were a fantastic garnish!

About peeling grapes: my mother who is Spanish used to peel grapes for me when I was a child. There is no need to blanch them, as there is a hole where the grape is removed from the vine--all you need is some patience and a paring knife (although fingernails work just fine.)

To Washington cook, I have never tried this but I would say try scoring and blanching the grapes as you would to peel tomatoes.

This recipe looks intriguing and I would like to try it but the idea of peeling grapes (which I have never done) puts me off. Does anyone have a quick, easy technique for peeling grapes?

Excellent for a hot evening or afternoon! Though found the garlic proportion a little overbearing. Next time will try with less garlic
