Even though I cut some of the sugar out of this recipe this was WAY too sweet. I don't think I'll make this again but if I did I would cut the sugar by at least half. I didn't make the ice cream just served it with a good store bought vanilla.

Absolutely wonderful! This makes for great presentation and it's delicious. I've made it three times and got rave reviews. Dinner guests still talk about it and tell others. The ice cream is what really makes this dessert. You'll impress people with this one!

I only made part of this recipe, but I just had to review the part I did make. I made the peanut brittle ice cream, and it was out of this world! Delicious! It's very rich, and the next time I make it I will double the recipe to fill my one-quart Donvier. I might even "cut" the custard's richness a bit by adding a little more half and half just before I stir in the peanut brittle. This is fantastic ice cream! I think it would be good with some sliced ripe bananas on top, or to serve it in concert with some fresh banana ice cream. Next time I'll make the whole recipe!
