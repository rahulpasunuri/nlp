I've served this several times and it always gets finished. Great with the asparagus but also good on carrots, etc. I follow the recipe but sometimes skip the blender/food processor and just chop and stir like mad--still looks and tastes fine.

The dip pretty much tasted like mayonnaise. I added salt and pepper and a good amount of lemon zest and it made it much better. Good idea for an easy appetizer.

Great dip. I cut the recipe in half since my group was small. Everyone liked it. I served with blanched asparagus and artichokes.

Very tasty! The dip is a breeze to make. I too doubled the recipe as it looked kind of small otherwise. I'm glad I did because as it turned out - it was a dip bowl full after doubling. The fresh asparagus really makes the dish when in season. We also had sugar sap peas on the table from anther tray and everyone dipped those in too! Lots of raves from the guests.

Great dip. I've made just the dip portion of the recipe for a crudite plate. People always comments on the dip.

This was delicious! I had the same problem as a previous reviewer with there not being enough ingredients in my blender/food processor to puree completely, so I doubled the ingredients for the dip and it worked beautifully. Made this for a spring baby shower and it went over very well!

The mayonnaise verte is so good that I saw a gentleman spreading it on a cracker when all the asparagus were eaten. Easy to make in advance. It is the only dish I *always* have at our parties.

I've been making this since it was first published in Gourmet in 1997. It makes a great appetizer and I almost always make it to bring on a picnic.

I served this as a dip with steamed and chilled green beans. It is simple and lets the vegetable flavor come through. It's a keeper.

Really simple and good. I wasn't sure this was such a great idea--I thought it sounded dull. But the mayonnaise was really flavorful and a great way to serve a lot of asparagus. I served it as an Easter appetizer. Only one problem--I couldn't get the ingredients to fully puree in my food processor (I don't think there was enough in there for the blade to work properly). So, although the mayonnaise was a bit lumpy, the taste was great.

Simple yet delicious! The sauce is incredibly easy and people always ask for the recipe.
