This is a great springtime dish because it is so light and fresh! Great for a side dish or a main course. We love garlic but I actually think a lighter hand with garlic is called for here in order to highlight the mint and zucchini and lemon. I would also increase the lemon zest or add lemon juice as others suggested. We also used an extra zucchini since it shrivels up when sauteed and it is so tasty! Even my seven-year old loves this dish.

I had never tried mint in italian cooking before. Usually I use basil or oregano. I didn't know what to expect, but I was quite pleased with the flavor.

I was not expecting this meal to taste so good. I wasn't sure about the blend of ingredients, however it turned out suprisingly tasty and I will definitely cook it again.

This is a favourite at home. The only thing I do different from the recipe is to grate the zucchini and leave them over a colander sprinkled with salt for about half an hour and then just sauté them really, really quickly over very high heat. Sometimes we also add red pepper flakes and it goes pretty well.

This dish turned out to be quite delicious! I took other reviewers' feedback and made use of them for a successful first-time attempt. I tried to add more flavoring to the dish ... Adding red pepper flakes was an excellent idea. I also squeezed some lemon juice and shook some grated parmesan over the pasta, which added to the consistency and flavor. I also salt-and-peppered the zucchinis before frying them. The frying process took a while... Next time, I might try sauteeing the zucchini and then adding more oil into the pan to make the garlic oil.

I absolutely love this recipe. Unique twist of ingredients, inexpensive, great tasting and healthy. How can you go wrong?

Well I have to confess... this is one of only two times I can remember dumping leftovers straight in the trash. I made this dish twice - once without the pasta, as a side dish, and used much less oil. That time we thought it was pretty tasty. The second time was last night - I made the dish following the recipe. It seemed oily and tasteless - not enough flavor in the zucchini/mint/lemon to support the pasta. I would skip it.

What a fantastic way to eat our over-abundance of zucchini. I cut the oil, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. Delicious.

so easy to make something yummy. with simple ingredients, you might get caught in a rut. I discovered mint growing in my yard, look some zucs are ready. Had a lemon on the table and the ever-present garlic. This whipped up really easy. I just look at the ingredients and took out. everyone should try. Have fun!

I haven't tried this recipe, but have a somewhat similar one in which the mint is made into a pesto with the oil and lemon zest. It also has a few additions which I highly recommend: crumbled feta cheese and roasted pine nuts, which are tossed together with the pasta and pesto and add a lot of extra flavor...

This dish was really refreshing and tasty! We used a little bit less olive oil and maybe a bit more mint. It was yummy! I really like the suggestion of the previous reviewer- adding red pepper flakes- and might try that next time...

My family has made this dish for years and call it "Fire and Ice"; we add crushed red pepper flakes while tossing it all together and it really does add zest to this tried and true Italian favorite!
