Ended up really dry, the filling tasted good though.

Wonderful, I used maple syrup when it called for maple sugar. I couldn't keep my friends away from them when they came out of the oven. One friend ate 6!! I made 3 batches, saved some for the next day and warmed in a low oven, still great.

Haven't made this yet, because I'm confused. The ingredients list calls for maple sugar, but the instructions list maple syrup. Since there is definitely a difference, which ingredient is correct?
