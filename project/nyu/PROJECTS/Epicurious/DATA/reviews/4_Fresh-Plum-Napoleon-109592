Very, very good! I do not like orange flavor particularly, therefore, left out the zest. I did however, add some cinnamon to the plum jam (1 tsp) and it was so tasty! Very light dessert, that has a lot of flavor. Will make again for sure! I feel this dessert is very versatile as well and any other kind of fruit would be great, especially berries.

I changed the jam recipe a bit- increased the plums to 16 oz (Italian plums), added 1 cinnamon stick, and left out the orange peel. It was delicious!

I made this recipe after craving millefeuille the other day (I used to stop at a bakery nearly every day while I lived in France for one). While good tasting, the end result was less than the sum of its parts. The pastry cream was FABULOUS - I will definitely use the cream recipe again. The jam tasted a bit bland and orangey to me - I would consider adding more sugar and halfing the amount of orange peel (I used fresh). If I make this recipe again I will cut the plums for the inner layer thinner or forgo them all together in favor of the preserves. I would also consider using a fourth layer of pastry so that I can add a second layer of the cream, and would roll my pastry layers thinner. Overall, it tastes good but not the amazing dessert I expected. I would make it again with some revisions.

So beautiful and so simple to make and assemble! Everyone raved about how wonderful it was. I'm going to try different fruits/jams and make this often!

This was gone in minutes! I took this to a game night party and everyone loved it. I served the extra pastry cream along side it so that people could dollop more on, the bowl was clean. The plums were very easy to work with. What a wonderful way to use all the beautiful fresh plums that are in season. I alternated red flesh and white flesh plums on top, very pretty.

A wonderful summer dessert! The pastry cream was wonderful and I made this recipe again substituting fresh strawberries and strawberry preserves for the plums and it was still fantastic. A big hit with all of the folks I've fed different versions too!
