Loved the croutons (and will definitely make them again), but the dressing was awfully plain for a 4-fork "Exceptional" rating.

I made this salad exactly as described and it is absolutely delicious. I have made it about twice a week every week since I discovered it. Highly recommended. Note: use good parmesan; it really helps!

I made this exactly as in the recipe and it was excellent. My family loved it and I am planning for it to be a regular salad at our house.

This is by far the EASIEST salad to make. You'd think because it's so simple that it wouldn't be this outstanding, but it's the blend of lemon, garlic and parm that work so well with the arugula. I am making this one tonight for my significant who doesn't like veggies, but likes arugula :)

This is really a great salad. The croutons are wonderful. Everything can be made ahead an assembled just before survig. Make this over and over, such a crowd pleaser.

I came home with fresh arugula from the organic farm today. Made this recipe as directed. It was terrific! The lemon complements the sharpness of the greens. Probably could reduce the amount of oil for the croutons by half. (I'll try that next time.)

Very simple and very flavorful. Ditto, I agree with the previous review and more.

We LOVED this salad! I followed the recipe exactly! So simple, but so flavoriful using the arugula with it's peppery flavor. I did add extra parsesan shavings. Everyone loved the garlic croutons! You can do so much ahead: shave the parmesan, bake your croutons, make the dressing. Then just toss it all together at the last moment! Our dinner guests asked for the recipe! I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

Just perfect! I made this with arugula and other greens from our garden, that needed to go somewhere, quick! I made crostinis instead of croutons, served the salad on top. I added some bell pepper and blanched yard long beans, because they needed to get used too. I also added some pine nuts, because my kids will eat greens more willingly that way. Served it with the Farmstand Gazpacho recipe on this site.
