Labor intensive, but great with the caramel nut tart! I make it every year.

I used this recipe with the pear and dried cherry tart on this site and received rave reviews. You can minimize the anxiety associated with overworking the dough by rolling it between two sheets of plastic wrap. It came out beautifully.

This is not the easiest dough to work with, but it's definitely worth the effort. The best pastry I've ever made, it's extremely buttery and flaky.
