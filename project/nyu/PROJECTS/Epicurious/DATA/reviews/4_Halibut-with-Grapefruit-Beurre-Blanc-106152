Here's a much better and easier grapefruit buerre blanc. Take pink grapefruit juice and reduce it down to a syrup. Use about 1/4 cup of the syrup and add to it 1/4 cup of heavy cream. Reduce this down to a syrup. Take it off the heat and incorporate cold unsalted butter until the sauce is thick and glossy. Season with salt and white pepper.

I've made the beurre blanc recipe several times and it's always amazing. It's really not that hard or that much work and it goes well over different kinds of fish (I used rock fish last time, but imagine a delicate sole or the go to salmon would work nice as well). As another reviewer said, I too indulge only rarely with beurre blanc, but when I do, this is the one I go for. Yummy!

I was very skeptical while preparing this dish. The beurre blanc seemed pungent. The grapefruit shallot combo was questionable, but somehow it all cam together! My husband was especially a fan! I did strain the shallot from the sauce. I really enjoyed the contrast of citrus against endive. Very good!

So glad that we have great halibut in the northwest - this is a terrific way to prepare. Definitely some effort involved, but the outcome is worth the time.

It drives me nuts when I read reviews with substitutions, but we have a huge white grapefruit tree in our backyard, so we used only white grapefruit, and the flavor didn't suffer. Other than that, the recipe was followed to the letter. The beurre blanc was to die for. We also loved the shiitake and endive saute. Caveat: I understand why to use a pink or red grapefruit as well to add color. We can't wait to make this for our next visitors to Southern Cal!

The first words out of my boyfriend's mouth after his first bite, "You knocked this one out of the park babe!" It was indeed tasty! I used all pink grapefruits, which looked pretty on the plate along side the white fish and green asparagus that I served it with. I don't indulge in beurre blanc all that often, but this was well worth the splurge!

This is my favorite fish recipe in the world. I love cooking it for guests when halibut is in season. I make the recipe exactly as it's written every time, and it's always a big hit. I use halibut fillets when I can get them. Flavor suffers a tiny bit but it's more elegant and easy to eat. I usually serve the fish on top of a large croute to give it a little height, I just take some fairly neutral bread, cut off all crusts, and brown a cube maybe 2 x 2 x 3 inches on all sides in a pan in butter.

I really like this buerre blanc sauce - I have never made the entire recipe but instead use the sauce for something quick to dress up a fish - have done it with steelhead most recently and really enjoyed it. The sauce will break and look horrible if you try to hold it too long, but otherwise it is terrific.

This sauce is foul. Bitter, really weird consistency, and disgusting to look at. I am really perplexed by the awesome reviews, as my husband and I both thought this was gross.

Notes I made: All red grapefruit fine. Sherry vinegar good. Zest goes into reduction sauce but I just took it to a thick consistency (not 1 Tb.). The only other grapefruit was a quick salso with cilantro added. Love the shitake endive combo.

I'm a big fan of buerre blanc sauces for fish. The only thing I did different was use all pink grapefruits and I strained the shallots from the reduction before melting the butter in. The flavor was a very delicate yet citrusy sauce. I will definitely make this again for halibut. I also used spinach instead of the endive. Loved it!

This is a really great recipe. Made it three times in the past few weeks. The first time it took forever, but then I got smart (I think!). Buy just one grapefruit for the zest and the juice, and buy a jar of grapefruit sections for chopping and the final addition of the whole sections. Saves tons of time and works really well!

My fiance and I made this for Valentine's Day and loved it. We substituted chilean sea bass because the guy at the fish counter said that halibut was out of season. It was still terrific. Other than that, we didn't change a thing.

I loved the grapefruit with fish. I made my beurre blanc and then put it in a thermos. That gave me hours to work on what every and it was still warm when I served it. i didn't have endive so I used brussels sprouts instead for the vegetables. I will make this dish again for company.

This is a wonderful recipe- complex, interesting,and delightful. I found that the white grapefruit is important(while nearly impossible to find these days!). While the beurre blanc requires attention, you can do other things while preparing it(I made chocolate pudding at the same time)and you can easily control the timing on things since the beurre blanc can wait over a bain marie while you finish up dinner. Quite impressive!!

If I had thought for two seconds about combining grapefruit and mushrooms in the same dish, I would have passed. But unfortunately I didn't and the result was an absolutely horrifying meal.

This was really good, great if you like grapefruit. It's very elegant with complex, interesting flavors. You can't really be making anything else while you're working on the buerre blanc--you have to stir constantly. Time consuming but good.

This excellent recipe never fails to delight my guests. Its fresh supply of flavors--both bright and dusky, due to the combination of grapefruit with shitake mushrooms--is sensual and invigorating. It is definitely worth the time.

I must admit that I am not a big fan of halibut. My husband loves it but I usually find it too bland. This grapefruit beurre blanc definitely provides flavor. If you like grapefruit, this sauce is a winner. It would be even better on a piece of swordfish ;)

It was great, but I felt that the mushrooms sort of clashed with the overall flavor of the dish. If I were to amke it again I would use no mushrooms and more endive.

I made this for our gourmet dinner group and it was quite a hit. Followed the directions to the letter and it was perfect. Fresh halibut steaks have just the right texture. The grapefruit beurre blanc was an unexpected treat, with a wonderfullly complex blend of flavors. The mushroom/endive accompaniment was really good, too. I would highly recommend this recipe.

This is great! Labor intensive because peeling the grapefrut sections and the zesting took 2 hours alone! Very gourmet. We used black grouper and asparagus beneath the grouper. We kept the sauce on the vegetable and put the fish on top of that with grapefruit sections to garnish. It was fabulous. We couldn't have eaten better in any restaurant!

I made this recipe without the vegetables since it was spur of the moment and only had navel oranges and the halibut. The oranges were a wonderful replacement and I added some of the juice after I cut the segments to the beurre blanc. I kept it warm in a small saucepan that I placed in the double boiler after steaming string beans. Another way to get the kids to eat fish!

Halibut is a great fish to cook with. The only thing I would have done differently was to make the beurre blanc last to ensure the best consistency, but then I have a tiny kitchen, so it just took that much longer to cook everything. I would definitely make it again, but I'm allergic to garlic, and found out the hard way shallots are related to garlic :(

Wonderfully different citrus flavor. I didn't find it bitter at all, although I only made the fish and sauce. I added the zest to the reducing liquid and (accidentally!) reduced until it was slightly caramelized around the edges. It turned out fantastic. I used much less butter (probably 4 Tbs total) and all pink grapefruit.

A great recipe. I made it a second time with a couple of simple but dramatic improvements. The fish came out a bit ragged with the suggested searing method, so the next time I used more butter in the pan, seared the fish on one side only, steamed a bit at the end with the lid on. The fillets were beautiful this time. The other improvement: I thought the beurre blanc sauce was a little too bitter because the grapefruit juice got cooked too long. The next time, I made a more traditional beurre blanc (white wine and vinegar reduction with shallots, shredded grapefruit peel, no herbs, strained, butter at end). Just before serving I added peeled chunks of grapefruit to the sauce, and warmed slightly. Much improved: grapefruit taste shined through without being bitter. I slayed my guests. :-) This version is definitely a keeper.

Just finished making this dish for my family, which includes 2 teens. Everyone enjoyed this dish! Had gone to a fish market looking for something, came home with halibut, and wanted something different, yet kid friendly..this is it! giving recipe to friend tonite..Very good exactly as recipe is written. Will archive with the best! As an avid cook, I pay full attn to reviews, and this was right on the mark.

This recipe isamazing. The complexities of overlapping flavors as well as the pairing of hearty with delicate is fantastic. I think if the grapefruit zest is added to the reduction process then some of the sharpness that another reviewer wrote about, would be eliminated.

this dish is TO DIE FOR! this has to be one of the best things i've ever made, and i make a goodly amount of gourmet meals. i was afraid the vinegar/grapefruit/endive combo would make the dish "sharp," another reviewer said. this is def. NOT the case. the flavours are exquisite. will DEF be making this again. i made no substitutions, just made the rec. as is. YUM!!!!!!

This is an outstanding recipe. After discovering that my wife could not have grapefruit I have revised it by substituting orange, lemon and lime.

Very delicious. Used monkfish filets, as that was the best looking fish at the market at the time. A well balanced dish- the rich sauce, grapefruit zing, and earthy shiitake play off each other nicely. The sweetness of the monkfish complemented the sauce very well, too. Served on basmati rice with asparagus. Do yourself a favor and serve a sauvignon blanc with grapefruit notes with this dish. A good match is the 2000 Mason, from Napa Valley. You won't be dissapointed. Can't wait to make this again.

We served this as an entree special in our restaurant a couple of weeks ago. It was a hit. We had a bit of a time finding good fresh halibut, but Chilean Sea Bass was available and it was terrific. Firm, but tender fish that loved the citrus sauce! We will do this one again.

wow! The subtleness of the sauce with the earthyness of the mushrooms was great. Well worth the effot. My kids liked the sauce with sauted chicken.

With the reduction of grapefruit and vinager, I found this sauce to be on the bitter side. Also serving it with the endive tends to make it a very sharp tasting dish. I found that the fish cooked up quicker than the minutes given, and by placing it in the oven while finishing off the mushrooms,lended to a very dry fish. If I make again, I may add a bit of blood oranges or strawberries in season to add some sweetness.

This is really quite simple, once you assemble the ingredients. The grapefruit beurre blanc is very subtly-flavored, and the mushroom-endive mix is a nice earthy note of contrast. I made this to use up the "christmas citrus", but would make it again for guests or family.
