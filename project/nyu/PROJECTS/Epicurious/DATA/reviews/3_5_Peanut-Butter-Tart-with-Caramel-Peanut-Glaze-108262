This was good, but not great. The caramel topping was hard, so it was tough to eat. My friend and I decided it would be great with a chocolate topping instead...one of the other reviewers said they used ganache, I might try it again with that. The crust was great and the peanut butter filling was pretty good.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE. Just made it again for the family over the holidays and received raved reviews. Half the guests liked it better than the Payard Buche de Noel we had on Christmas day. I love the filling and think the crust is buttery perfection. I wouldn't change a thing.

The first time I made this recipe I loved the taste but was hard to slice. The next time I changed the order: crust, then the caramel layer then the peanut butter filling, prehaps not as pretty but way easier to slice. Getting your caramel correct does take some practice.

I agree. This dessert is just okay and there has to be better peanut butter treats out there. I did like the cinnamon in the crust. That added a nice flavor contrast to the peanut butter. The actual peanut butter filling was nothing special. The caramel, minus the water, did perk up this otherwise ho-hum dessert. If I make something like this, I might try either a graham cracker crust (with cinnamon!) or a chocolate cookie crust to give this more dimension.

I followed this recipe exactly and it really wasn't that good. The crust was a nightmare, too crumbly, not nearly enough liquid. Added another egg yolk and more cream and still I had to put it all into the tartpan and press it in. The filling was just okay and the glaze was a disappointment, just too runny. There are way better recipes out there for peanutbutter pies that are topped with chocolate. I would not make this again.

Made this for a birthday member at the office who loves peanut butter & chocolate. Doubled filling for a larger tart pan and decided to top tart with chocolate ganache. The office is still raving about it. Definitely a special holiday dessert!

I liked this dessert. The 5 other family members I was serving did not. In all fairness, I am the only one of us that enjoys rich desserts -which this is - very rich. I found I liked it better the 2nd day and it was best served cold (I'm eating alot of this tart...). I had no problems with it setting up. I doubled the filling for use in an 11 in. tart mold - which turned out to be plenty. The caramel sauce is really good. I will use that again.

This was just excellent! Although I must not have cooked the caramel enough as it never reall set-up.

This tart is just unbelievable. If you love peanutty/caramel things, you are going to thank yourself for making this.

very good. i particularly enjoyed the crust, the hint of cinnamon is delicious. the filling is good, this tart is best served slightly chilled - when room temperature it becomes an oozing mess and is difficult to cut and eat. the filling has a good flavor and the glaze is very tasty.
