Great recipe! I made this for my husband's Birthday party and everyone loved it, even the people not into sweets. I have been ordered to make it for multiple functions. I doubled the recipe and it made 14 good sized servings. I would recomend cutting it into the portions you like before you freeze it or else it is extremely tough to get through.

I made this for Memorial Day and we couldn't wait so had to try a tiny piece last night. Wow! I don't think I have ever given a 4 fork review before but this dessert is worthy of one! LOVE the crispy texture of the baklava and then the smoothness of the ice cream. I made it pretty much as written tho I did make the second layer of the phyllo right on top of the first and had no problem. Time consuming but delicious!

I was lucky enough to be in attendance at the party where Rosie served this dessert; and have known her for years. The cake was presented to a NYC rooftop gathering of culinary professionals and culinary students. (In other words, a tough audience.) Rosie has no formal "education" in the culinary arts - just real-life training in professional kitchens all over the country. When the cake was served, there was nothing audible except moans of pleasure. At my urging (and whining...) Rosie put this imaginative recipe down on paper. I'm sorry the cook from Boston didn't enjoy the cake with more of an open mind. I know plenty of people of Greek ancestry who swooned over this cake. If you LOVE fresh, home-made baklava and LOVE ice cream - make this masterpiece for people you love :D. Great summer dessert.

Just made this a couple of days ago. I quite liked it, and so did everyone who's tried it so far. I did play around with the syrup ingredients, as it didn't contain enough honey for me, but that might be a personal preference. Baklava is usually a loaded kind of dessert for me, heavy and decadent, and surprisingly, I think the ice cream made it lighter, and the fact that this is eaten cold (obviously!) made it very refreshing. I will make this again, definately, but I'll have to remember to ease up when it comes to sugar content in the syrup.

Everyone absolutely loved this recipe. I didn't get time to make an ice cream cake so just served with vanilla ice cream. It's not authentic baklava, but that was OK with us because it wasn't nearly as sickly sweet eithe....and so we could have two pieces :)

I cannot belive that anyone would ever even dare defile baklava with ice cream. I thought chocolate was bad enough, but this "takes the cake." I tried it anyway, with my Greek grandmother's recipe, and she must have been rolling in her grave. Not only was it inherently wrong, the taste was all off, and the ice cream cheapened the richness of the baklava.

This dish is absolutely incredible. Every time I've made it, we've eaten the whole pan, so now I'm very careful to not make it too often. I recently had two different friends tell me they had been thinking about this dessert, even though it's been two years since one of them has had it. Yes, it's that good! The ice cream balances the baklava perfectly (in much the same way that ice cream mellows apple pie rather than sweetening it).

Seemed challenging but I read carefully and begun. What excitement! This was a marvelous dessert and the small summer engagement party actually applauded! I opted to visualize and erect a much larger version, tripling the recipe to accomodate all guests. It lookes prestiges plated, glistening with the sweet lemon syrup! I actually sold the service to several of the party guest so not only did I have a treat I made some extra cash - GO ROSIE!!!!!

Was intrigued with the recipe and love both baklava and ice cream so decided to try it. Did not care for it at all and my family didn't eat it either. Just didn't care for the two combined. Definitely will not make it again.

I didn't assemble the cake with ice cream - just made the baklava and it was delicious. I agree with the person from Salt Lake City's comment that you can serve ice cream on the side if you wish to - but why bother when the baklava is so delicious on its own.

Who would think that such a rich cake would be so scrumptous and not too overwhelming sweet? This is a gem of a recipe well worth the time and effort. Follow the directions, and you won't be disappointed.

I have the ultimate baklava recipe, but was inttrigued. So, for Mom's 83rd birthday. . . well, after all the work on a hot July day, I've decided next time to just serve the beautiful traditional baklava with a scoop of outrageously delicious and fattening ice cream. Same deal, isn't it?

I fell for this recipe and thus decided to try my hand with phyllo dough for the first time. I bought three packages (just in case), thawed them all for the exact amount of time instructed on the box, and armed myself with Saran Wrap and a damp towel. But when I tried to unroll them, each one fell apart in my hands. But all was not lost--instead, I baked puff pastry shells until they were almost done, removed them from the oven and took off the tops, filled the insides with the nut mixture and some of the syrup, put the tops back on, poured on some more syrup, and baked for a while longer with the tops on. The syrup caramelized beautifully all around the outsides of the pastry and also softened up the nuts. When it came time to serve them, I heated them up in the oven for a few minutes, removed the tops again, put a scoop of ice cream on top , drizzled a little extra syrup on top of the ice cream and sprinked some extra nut mixture on top of the syrup, and put the tops back on. And it was a marvelous dessert, and very elegant looking--like an exotic cream puff! And it got rave reviews from my guests, all of whom requested the recipe. Furthermore, the syrup and nut mixture amounts in this recipe are the exact same as you need to make a box's worth of Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Shells. I will make this again and again, but never with phyllo!

Fab ice cream cake, great with our New Zealand white chocolate ice cream!! Read the receipe well though as it's not so well written and easy to miss steps. I've made it several times and it was rated a fantastic success each time by guests!!!

Finally, success with phyllo! It has always intimidated me in the past, but I kept talking to it, saying "I am not afraid of you!" The dish came together wonderfully... but be warned: It is very very sweet. Delightfully sweet, but incredibly sweet. I used Blue Bell Vanilla Bean ice cream.

This dessert was delicious. Although I only froze it for about 3 or 4 hours, it still held it's shape very well. I would recommend freezing it for the recommended time though. My sister helped me prepare it and the work went fast. Everyone at the dinner party was delighted with the contrasting flavors.

Like 'the cook from New York' I couldn't believe how well it turned out, I thought it didn't look flaky enough. Served it to my wine club where we created a Greek dinner. Everone raved over it+++. Suggest cutting the rectangle in half. There was no point to cutting it diagnonally,it would take less space in freezer.

Excellent recipe. I think it's more of an adult ice-cream cake since the adults loved it but the kids didn't like the nuts in it. The instructions are easy to follow and although it takes some time, it's no more time consuming than a homemade cake.

Made this for a dinner party (Greek theme) on Saturday night. It was not as hard as I thought it would be, I made sure to keep the filo dough covered which made it easier to work with. Give yourself lots of time since it has to freeze for at least 6 hours. It was quite yummy and everyone raved over it. I would definately make it again.

I made just the baklava part of this recipe. It was a bit too lemony for my taste. I would cut back on the lemon the next time I make it. Others at the block party I took it to thought it was perfect. I have found that keeping phyllo covered with a clean dry lint-free dish towel works better than keeping it covered with a damp cloth. If you get any dampness near the phyllo, you have a terrible mess.
