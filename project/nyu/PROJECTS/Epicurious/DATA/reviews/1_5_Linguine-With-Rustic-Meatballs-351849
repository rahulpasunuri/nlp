Needs a lot more recipe tinkering to make it worth making again - not worth it.

Not a big hit with my family - kind of a thin flavor. I would recommend half the pasta - and I think I would add some cream to the sauce to thicken it a bit more. Vegetable flavors were nice, and there was a hint of kick (but I'd add more cumin and red pepper flakes) but the sauce was quite thin.
