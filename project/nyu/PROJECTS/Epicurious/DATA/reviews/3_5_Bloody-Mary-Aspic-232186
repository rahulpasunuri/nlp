We made this for a July 4 dinner and cut the aspic into small stars with cookie cutters. Very fun and tasty.

I made this, along with a beef prime rib and the potato green bean salad, for a dinner party of 11. They all raved about it. It is a great summertime accompaniment.

BLOODY MARY ASPIC I tried this on my Husband. He asked me why I was serving "Jello Shots" in the middle of a meal. Being a great fan of Bloody Marys, this is a very tasty recipe I will make again. Next time I will serve it at a cocktail party in condiment or demi cup as Bloody Mary "Jello Shots." I bet it will be a smash. I think the previous reviewer is correct in that folks now a days don't really have a taste for tomato aspic.

This recipe was delicious for me only. You have to have liked tomato aspic in the fifties to enjoy it. While I thought it an excellent palette cleanser, guests sampled only out of curiousity. The recipe worked well, and looked terrific, but was too time consuming to make again. I made the complete menu but did a back up tomato salad anticipating that there aren't too many aspic fans out there.
