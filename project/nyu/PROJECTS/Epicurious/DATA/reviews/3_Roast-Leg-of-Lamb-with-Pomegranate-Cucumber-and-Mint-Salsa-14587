This was pretty good, but not great. I thought the salsa was watery, but the taste was good. Pomegranate and mint are natural partners. The lamb was so-so--I've made better lamb. Overall, this dish has potential.

Was served this by a friend and my husband and I loved it. We thought the pomegranate added wonderful texture. Our hostess served the lamb across cooked lentils with sauteed vegetables. It was fabulous.

The lamb turned out great! Take it out as soon as the temp is 145 and let it sit under foil for up to 20 minutes. Beautiful medium rare to medium and very juicy. Pomegranates were out of season so I substituted pears and added a bit more vinegar and mint jelly--the salsa was a hit!

I made the salsa for the roast lamb I already make. It was nice to have the fresh taste since lamb can be a little heavy, but my guests and I weren't crazy about the seedy crunchiness of the pomegranate (and seeding it was a real pain). I only did half the cucumber and pomegranate and ended up having plenty for the roast. Fun, but I don't think I'd make it again.

Loved it! The meat was delicious. I normally use mint jelly but the addition of the extra ingredients in the salsa made it wonderful. Everything paired beautifully and will make it again!

I didn't think the salsa stood up to the lamb. Although the ingredients of the salsa seem robust enough, they did not marry well with the lamb - the lamb over powered them. I was disappointed

I tried this with another afficionado friend. We loved the recepie and thought the salsa made a huge difference. The seasoning paste was very good also and made the house smell very nicely when the guests arrived. I tried a variation of inserting the paste into holes I created with a knife and it really worked out well. The salsa, however, made the dish. Make sure you use ripe pomegranates. They had an explosive taste that when mixed with the roasted pine nuts (make sure you roast them) was divine.
