I wrote a review on this dish back in Dec.09 and only gave it two forks. While searching for another recipe I ran across this recipe again and felt I needed to add a footnote. The day after I made this dish I pulled the leftovers out of the fridge and tried a bite. It was heavenly... a great combination of flavors. I called my mom whom I had given half the leftovers, and she informed me that she made the same discovery and had already polished off their portion. I gently reheated and served it for dinner the next night and my husband couldn't believe the improvement. I'm certain I will make this dish again only I will bake it a day ahead, then reheat until warmed through and then add the treviso (or radichio).

So good! Really rich though so you might want to serve a salad with it. Also, I added mushrooms and I liked the addition a lot!

Made this over the Christmas holidays and I think it is a yummy recipe. It is one of those "comfort food" recipes; one that I will keep in my arsenal of like recipes. Making it again for a casual gathering with friends this coming Sat. nite. I used the regular radicchio (ball) and it was quite delicious and very pretty presentation

I made this lasagna for Christmas Day - I'm Italian, so I like to have a pasta course for a festive meal. My husband (100% American) was intrigued by the idea of 'white' lasagna, since he'd only tried the American-style version of the dish. It was a massive hit, and I would not hesitate to say it was very close to restaurant quality. Instead of pancetta, I used smoked turkey bacon (I like the taste, and had it at home), and Chioggia radicchio (the ball-shaped kind), since I could not find Treviso. I was able to find Taleggio at Whole Foods Market (for a decent price too), where I also got fresh egg pasta sheets, which we generally use in Italy. Would make it again in a heartbeat!

Made this as was very curious; the ingredients were intriguing. It was a delicious winter dinner. Followed recipe exactly and served it with the salad from the magazine (citrus vinaigrette, pomegranate seeds, toasted hazelnuts on butter lettuce) and it was a nice counterbalance to the earthy rustic flavors of the lasagna.

I made this last night for my husband and I and I thought it was WONDERFUL! I had to use smoked moz because I couldn't find the Taleggio cheese and the smoked moz went PERFECT with the pancetta. I would make this again for entertaining. Well worth it!

I liked the end result but agree that it was too expensive and labor intensive to make again.

I was looking forward to this recipe but was dissapointed in the end. It tasted like mac & cheese with extra ingredients...probably because of the cheese sauce. I would recommend sauteing the pancetta before adding the vegetables.

I was not a big fan of this recipe. The ingredients were expensive and combined to a salty mess. There are other recipes that use these ingredients so much better. I do not feel they were showcased very well in this recipe.
