Easy, delicious and guests loved it. I used pre-rolled puff pastry for speed and convenience and it was still very good.

Really easy to make! I made them as an appetizer, and then left the house. When I returned a couple hours later they were GONE... Unusual in this household where there are always leftovers..

I was surprised by the baking soda and milk in the dough, but it turned out to be exceptional. I prepared the filling 1 day ahead, dough & assembly 2 hours before. Excellent and easy recipe.

I was surprised by the baking powder and milk in the dough recipe however it turned out to be exceptional, light and crumbly. I prepared the filling 1 day ahead, dough & assembly a couple of hours before. My guests asked for seconds and thirds, excellent recipe.
