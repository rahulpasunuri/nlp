I loved making this recipe! Fairly easy and delicious. Remember that gnocchi are not pasta, they are small dumplings, so they will be soft. Think of large spatzl. If you think they feel slimy throw them on a baking sheet and bake at 400 for 5 minutes. Served them with a touch of homemade alfredo. http://ctinut.blogspot.com/2011/03/spinach-gnocchi-i-finally-made-it.html

I have made this from the cookbook and was looking for it online to email. I was very surprised to see the negative reviews. My family enjoys these light, tasty gnocchi. Not slimy at all and really pretty easy to make.

I read the other bad reviews but have to tell you mine turned out great!! Delicious, not slimy and quite a treat. It is a high maitenance recipe because of all the steps involved and MUST be served immediately for optimum flavor and consistency. But I'll definitely make it again since it turned out so yummy!!

this is the second dish I've made from the new Gourmet cookbook that was just not good. From now on, I'll check the reviews online before making anything in the book. The other dish I made also got 1 star!!! So what did they do? Go through epicurious to find the lowest rated recipes and put them all in a $40 book?????

This recipe was terrible. The gnocci turned out mushy and slimy and there wasn't any sauce to speak of to add to the bland flavor.

It took a large amount of work for something that was very bland.
