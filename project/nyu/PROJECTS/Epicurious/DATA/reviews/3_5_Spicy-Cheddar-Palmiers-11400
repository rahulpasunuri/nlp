I am giving this recipe three stars for method and potential. I loved everything about it, except the combination of chili and brown sugar, which surprised me. I used Mexican chili powder, new to me, which tastes a bit different than the type we had previously used and this may have led to my concern about the end product of these palmiers. I will certainly make this again, but will alter the spicy bit, perhaps some finely chopped hot pepper, change to olives etc. Also, I found that the slices which were thicker tended to hold together better; I believe another reviewer mentioned the same hint. Thank you for taking the time to post this recipe.

Fantastic! These disappear immediately every time I make them.

The heavy spices took away from the puff pastry and cheese. I liked the rolling-in-parsley, but wouldn't make a chili-powder based palmier again. Sundried tomatoes and asiago make a nice filling.

This was my first experience with puff pastry and it was a bit of a struggle to roll the dough out to the specified dimensions. (Next time I'll allow more time for thawing than the package directions advise.) Even so, the results were attractive enough to bring to a potluck and tasty enough to be a hit.

I have to agree with one reviewer, I thought the different tastes were just too strange together with the puff pastry. They smelled great in the oven, and looked great, but in the end I think they went over as a little odd at the party I took them to.

These are the best!!! I was looking for a light appetizer to make for my weekend dinner party - these were perfect!! No too spicy - just enough. Will make again & again. I didn't have any problems with the dough. Guests raved about them!

These were easy and delicious. Everybody loved them. I had a bit of trouble with the dough, though. It needs to be chilled well to work with it easily.

Visually extremely appealing-- guests were much more impressed than they had a right to be, given how easy this recipe is. I increased the spice by 50% based on previous reviews, but next time I'll try it as is because I think the spice overwhelmed the other flavors. The combination is appealing, although the different flavors don't meld together quite that well. I did add extra parsley, which heightened the color contrast appreciably. Be sparing with the parsley at the end, however, so that the two sides of the roll stick to each other. Some of mine came apart slightly (unrolled) during baking.

This is a very good, very easy recipe. I have a ton of puff pastry in my freezer, so I made these and the prosciutto-gruyere pinwheels (also on this Web site) for a party of 20. They were definite hits, and seem so much more complicated than they really are. Will make again, and perhaps experiment with softer cheeses.

"Palmier" literally translated from the French means "palm tree". You pronounce it palm-yay (roughly, although Parisiennes will not understand unless you add some savoir faire). :)

Excellent, 3.5 solid forks. I just love the combination of spices. Next time, I will increase everything in the spice mixture by 50% to 100% except the salt. I dried the parsley well and it stuck to the pastry just fine. For maximum flavor and visual appeal, stick on as much parsley as the dough will take! First, I sliced thicker than 1/2 inch simply because I was concerned that thinner slices might fall apart. Then I found that if you freeze it briefly, cutting 1/2 inch slices is easy. I tried rolling the entire sheet into one pinwheel (for stability), but found the baked product looks so much better rolled up as the recipe specifies. Next time, I am going to grease the baking sheet! P.S. How do I pronounce "palmier" and what does it mean?!

I made this for a pot-luck type hors d'oeuvres & wine party. They were gone in 10 minutes! I took the advice of previous reviewers and dried the parsley well, didn't overdo the cheese, and sliced thicker than 1/2 inch. It was a little easier to press the cheese into the puff pastry first, then sprinkle on the spices. I actually didn't use all the spice mixture, just what it took to cover the pastry evenly. When I baked them I laid them on their "backs" but some of them fell to their sides, and the cheese/sugar browned a bit more on those. Those that were more thickly sliced didn't fall over. The palmiers were deliciously spicy with a touch of sweet that everyone raved about. I will definitely make these again. They are great to make ahead since you can freeze the rolls and slice later.

These got rave reviews, but I would make a couple of changes. First, slice a bit thicker. Make 36 instead of 48 palmiers. Second, don't pack the cheese too much. My first try had cheese gooping out too much.

Perfect, easy. be sure to dry the parsley thoroughly, so it adheres to the pastry dough. Good compliment to fruit-based dishes
