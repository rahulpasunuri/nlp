This meatloaf was pretty standard. I used a chipotle ketchup from another recipe in place of the plain ketchup. It was delicious. Next time I will use bread crumbs instead of the saltines. It was a little too crumbly.

Took longer to cook than suggested. Doubled the worcestershire.

This is a quick and easy recipe, great for weeknights when you are short on time and ingredients.

Very bland. Didn't like the consistency of the onions. They didn't get cooked through. Won't make again.

I forgot to mention before that to reduce the fat, I didn't include the bacon, and thought it tasted fantastic without it.

I gave this recipe four forks because for the amount of time and effort involved, it's a really tasty result. I doubled the recipe and used half pork and half beef, and added green onions and cilantro because I had it lying around. The cilantro added so much to the flavor and I will defintely include it from now on. Preparation was minimal, about 20 minutes, and not much to wash up. I didn't use extra sugar and thought it was plenty sweet enough the way it was. Because I doubled it I had extra the next day and it was even tastier (even good cold), and kept it's structure well.

Great recipe! SO easy and very good. I use spicy ketchup or add a little Tabasco to mine. Has become "my meatloaf recipe". My brother's family also adopted it as their own after dinner at my house. Highly recommended!

I left off the bacon but did everything else the same. This was my first time making meatloaf since I was a kid helping my mom. It turned out great!! My boyfriend finished it off in one night. I served it with BUTTERED NOODLES WITH CHIVES as an easy side dish.

This was very easy to make and tasted good. My family and I liked it but didn't love it. I think I'll try a different meatloaf recipe next time, just to see if I could make it better. It was a bit greasy, probably from the bacon on top. Notice that it doesn't make a very large loaf. Three adults finished it off without eating huge helpings. You might want to double it, especially if you want leftovers.

I agree with the others -- this recipe was SO easy and was a big hit with my guests. I also doubled the recipe (made two mini-loaves) and used breadcrumbs. This will definitely be a regular mid-week dish at my house! Next time I will try the brown sugar/ketchup concoction as some others have suggested

Delicious and oh so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly (other than doubling the batch) and made each batch into 2 mini loaves. I had planned on freezing them and giving them to a friend who is a new mom as part of a care package. After smelling them in the oven, I decided to keep the meatloaves and give her coupons for take out instead!

This was a great recipe. My husband is a very picky eater, but he said this recipe was better than his Mother's! Very easy, we will definitely have this for dinner again.

Delicious. Made just as indicated in the recipe except I didn't have saltines so I used breadcrumbs. Very Good.

I'm not a meat loaf person, but this was great! My family loved it (even beat my mother-in-laws according to my husband). I diced the onion and pepper finely. I also created a "sauce" w/ catsup, brown sugar, molassas and tomato sauce for serving. My husband claims it's a must have. All mid-week recipes s/b so easy and pleasing!

I mix about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar with the ketchup that you pour on top of the loaf ... it adds some sweetness that my family loves. =)

This is a great receipe. I have replaced the crackers with crushed cornflakes. It gives it a bit of a sweet taste. Instead of the ketchup I use V-8 juice. This gives it more of a vegetable flavor.

A very simple, easy to make dish that works well on a busy Saturday. Well served with a cold potato salad!

This meat loaf was everything you would expect from a New England style meat loaf. Nothing fancy but very tasty, quick and easy to make.

I thought that this was a very good, easy, and quick recipe. I would definatley make it again, and add some of my own touches to it.
