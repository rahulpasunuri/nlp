A True Winner! I have been making this cake for years - always with excellent results - everyone, I mean EVERYONE I serve it to is astounded by it! The first time I made it, I did the three layers, and I agree with some of the other reviewers, they come out rather thin - so I've since switched to a 9" two-layer cake, and it is great! Dense, moist, and super flavorful. I have never made the frosting as it's called for in the recipe, however, since as a rule I do not use frozen concentrates (don't like corn syrup!) I've simply substituted about three or four tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. I just monitor it to be sure the consistency is correct. A note from trial-and-error: When layering the filling I put the frosting first, THEN the strawberry filling, otherwise the frosting doesn't spread well (I suppose that's because I make a thicker frosting than what the recipe calls for). I love this cake so much that I made it for my own wedding this past December! It's really that good - and super easy!

cake was really dense, and the layers were really thin -- i would take the advice of some of the other reviews and only make 2 layers next time. also the top doesn't really brown, so make sure you don't leave it in longer waiting for it to brown -- perhaps this was why mine came out super dense? was still pretty delicious nonetheless. use 4 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice instead of lemonade concentrate and added extra powdered sugar as needed. frosting was a real superstar.

this was really a show stopper- i used greased parchment paper and the cake slipped out so beautifully that i didn't even frost the sides. it looked like something out of a magazine! and it tasted even better than it looked- light, fresh and creamy.

I'm shocked by negative reviews, particularly by those who say they're experienced bakers. I've baked this cake since it appeared in the magazine and have gotten rave reviews and recipe requests every time without altering the cake recipe at all and simply following directions. It's a spring tradition and sells out instantly at bake sales! For those who say "it's not fluffy," all I can say is that the recipe is prefaced with "dense, moist cake." It's not supposed to be fluffy. If anything goes wrong, it's definitely baker error. Proper pans, X-lg eggs, ingredient temperature, and accurate measurements are essential, as with any baking. I've used cake flour but personally prefer the results when using all-purpose, reducing by 6T. The only caution I would give is to reduce the amount of lemonade concentrate in the frosting, particularly if making it when it's humid. There again, anyone accustomed to making cream cheese frosting knows how it can vary each time and should add liquids a little at a time until the desired consistency is achieved. AWESOME CAKE!

i was nervous about making this cake for my mom's birthday based on some of the negative reviews. however, the cake turned out great and some people even had a second slice. i added the extra egg white and half tsp. baking powder as some reviewers suggested and baked only 2 layers rather than 3. for the frosting i only used 2 c. powdered sugar, added zest from one medium lemon and squeezed fresh lemon juice in a little at a time (about 1/4 c. total) until the frosting was the consistency i wanted then added another tablespoon or two of powdered sugar to taste. the cake was perfect--not too sweet, not too tart and not at all dry. everyone at dinner is looking forward to the next event so we can make it again.

The frosting really ruined this cake. I would not add frozen lemonade concentrate to it. It makes no sense and ruins the consistency of the frosting, making it watery, more of a glaze than a frosting. I would suggest keeping it simple with the grated lemon peel-maybe add more than 1/2 teaspoon for a stronger flavor.

Rating: 3
I omitted the lemonade concentrate and added a teaspoon of lemon curd and extra lemon juice. The taste was pleasing, not overly sweet or citrusy, a great summer cake. I did like the cake, but it was pretty dense. I would do 1.5X the recipe to ensure that the cakes leave enough leftover to properly level and balance. One recipe was enough, but only leaving the tops domed. I would also say that strawberry preserves work fine in-between the layers, and I added whipped cream on top of the strawberries for more creaminess without too much sugar.

Rating: 0
this is a very light and tasty cake with the addition of beaten egg whites and the 1 t. baking powder. next time i think i might cut the baking powder to 1/2 tsp so the cake will be a bit denser. the lemon flavor didnt stand out to me even with the addition of 1/2 t. lemon oil, so i'll double the zest next time. i made these to stuff with blackberry compote and lemon curd and top with vanilla mascarpone icing.

A great summer cake. I made the cake according to the recipe, and used 3 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting with just enough lemonade concentrate to get the texture right. The top layer broke while I was assembling it, but that was my fault, not the cake's. Once the frosting was on, you couldn't tell. The frosting was light, fluffy, and there was plenty of it.

This is a delicious cake! I followed the advice from other reviews and added one extra egg white and 1 tsp baking powder. The cake was moist and delicious, with a nice and kind of spongey consistency. I actually only made 2 layers and put some of the extra batter into a muffin tin. I added blueberries into the muffin batter and they turned out to be delicious lemon-blueberry muffins! And I followed the directions on the cake, except I really think I made the frosting better with the following changes: a bit of lemon juice instead of concentrate, and I sliced a few fresh strawberries into the frosting and turned on the mixer, so they kind of got mixed up. So delicious! Really a fresh summer dessert. Next time I will try using fresh strawberries in between the layers instead of the frozen. The cake is yummy and sweet enough that it really doesn't need anything syrupy. Enjoy!

I was really disappointed with the way this cake turned out. Cake was dry (and I made sure to underbake) and the frosting was so runny. I tried with some of the fixes as well but they were no help. I am an excellent baker but I would not recommend this recipe to anyone

This was delicious. I'm not much of a baker and don't have a tremendous sweet tooth, but my boyfriend requested a lemon cake for his birthday and we chose this one from the many options. It was definitely a dense cake, but it was delicous and a huge hit. I added two extra beaten eggwhites and some baking powder as others suggested. My only problem was in getting the cakes out of the pan, they broke up a bit. Next time I'd line the pans with parchment paper.

I make this cake whenever I need a springy/summery dessert with wow-factor. I've always done as other reviewers: extra egg white and 1/2 tsp. baking powder in the batter, fresh sliced strawberries between the layers in addition to good strawberry jam, and much more powdered sugar in the frosting. This weekend, I made them into cupcakes. Filled cupcake papers almost to the top, baked for about 17-18 min. at 350. Put good quality strawberry jam into a pastry bag and punctured and filled the cakes from the top. Then frosted them and topped each with a clean strawberry, leaves intact on their sides. Great presentation at a family picnic. People foundered.

I needed to make lemon-blueberry cupcakes for a birthday party. I made the adjustments suggested by greenpeas (Philadelphia) (1/2 tsp baking powder, extra soft-peak beaten egg white in the batter at the end, plus extra powdered sugar in the frosting). I added some blueberries to each cupcake and baked for 15 minutes, and they were a giant hit! Party attendees claimed they were the best cupcakes they'd ever eaten.

This was just delicious. Lemony, not too sweet, refreshing and very tasty. After reading other reviews i used 3 lg. eggs and one egg white, and made sure to beat everything really well so that the batter was always creamy and fluffy. i also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder to the mix. To the frosting, I added the lemon zest, fresh lemon juice AND organic lemon extract (1 tsp) and added enough powdered sugar to keep the icing creamy and not drippy. SO good!

I must admit my impressions of the finished product were not good prior to tasting. I'm sure there isn't enough powdered sugar in the frosting, it was so runny. But I took it to work and it might not have looked professional but it was a smash hit with everyone. Definitely going into the my favourites book.

I am an experienced baker, and was testing this recipe for a wedding cake. I made this recipe 1.5X for the 3 9-inch pans it calls for. The only other changes to the recipe were to beat the egg whites separately with a portion of the sugar, and to add 1/4 teas lemon extract. The cakes baked up strange- with buckles and cracks in them. They did not rise properly. I think the recipe is missing a baking powder component because he batter looked great going in- very fluffy yet well mixed. I am going to try making it one more time because I like the idea of a lemon cake with buttermilk in it, but next time I'll add 2 teas powder to the same 1.5X recipe.

I made this tremendous cake for my son's 2nd b-day brunch. It was visually pleasing a so delicious - a nice cake for a brunch b/c it's not so heavy and sweet. I forced myself to be disciplined and made sure that all the right ingredients were at room temp, everything cooled accordingly and the strawberry reduction came out to the right amount. I did beat 2 of my 3 egg whites to med. peaks (per the Seattle review) and ended up with a fluffy textured cake even though it doesn't rise very high. The only other change I made was to use 4T of fresh lemon juice in place of the concentrate. That produced a perfect frosting consistency. I would recommend using the 2/3 C reduced strawberries instead of jam or jelly - it has a more intense and less sugarly flavor than a commercial spread. Do try this cake - it's worth it.

This cake is phenomenal. I made it for a party when my friend got her PhD. Everyone raved about it, and several people had more than one piece. I think the previous reviewers who complained about the strawberries definitely didn't cook them down enough. I used fresh lemon juice instead of concentrate in the frosting and increased the powdered sugar by a lot. The frosting ended up thick enough to decorate with. I already have requests to bring this to future parties!

In a word - yuk. The cake was way too heavy, dense and soggy. The icing was pretty good. I used 1 8 oz. package of cream cheese and it did not turn out runny. But I won't be making this again. A sponge soaked in lemon juice would have tasted better.

Rating: 4
This cake was very easy to make, the strawberry filling was a breeze and really complements the lemon. Strawberry jam might work just as well, but the larger chunks you get with the frozen strawberries are good. If you make the frosting according to the recipe, it will be very runny, more like a glaze. I added about twice the powdered sugar and it was better.

This is a wonderful recipe. It takes some extra effort but the payoff is definitely worth it. Extra large eggs make a huge difference in the texture and moistness of the cake. My children love it and almost always request it for their birthdays.

This was my first time ever making a cake from scratch, but I have to say that it was for the most part, a success! I used strawberry preserves in between the layers like previous reviewers said, and went easy on the lemon juice for the frosting. The cake was very dense but not very moist in my case - I may have overbaked it by a couple minutes. Are there any tips on making this a tad fluffier?

I copied this recipe from the magazine years ago, but just made it for the first time. Beautiful, delicious, and SO EASY. I was surprised to log on here and read so many bad reviews. This is like a lemon pound cake, and it didn't rise much, but I wonder if those whose layers didn't rise at all really used buttermilk. And I can't believe the filling could be runny if it is really reduced to 2/3 cup, as the recipe directs. I agree the frosting was a bit loose, and next time I'll add the lemonaid concentrate (or juice) a little at a time. Loose frosting or not, if you can follow simple instructions and give yourself a little lead time, this is a spectacular dessert for Spring.

I've made this cake twice and loved it both times. Have served it at 2 showers and got rave reviews. I make the cake exactly as the recipe says, however if I made it a 3rd time, I would tweak the icing. It comes out way too runny. I think 5 tbs of frozen lemonade is too much. I would reduce that to 3 tbs or just eliminate it and add lemon juice as other cooks suggested. I'll probably do that next time. Everything else turned out great. I cooked at 325 for 25 min. and it was perfect. Be careful to not over cook. One other thing- if you can't get the strawberries in syrup thick enough- add a tbs of corn starch- that will do the trick! If you are wondering whether to make this- go for it!! You'll LOVE it!

I have to state at the start that I made this in a bundt pan and didn't make the sauce or frosting. That said, I had no problems with it rising-- make sure to sift dry ingredients well-- that may have been the problem for some. It was good-- I didn't put any topping on it, but will make a lemon glaze to pour on it next time. I'm planning to make this for Easter as a bunny cake and I will then make the frosting and top that with coconut, paper ears and jelly beans for eyes. I think it will be delicious! Maybe four forks that time. :)

The three 9" cakes were thin and dense, not fluffy at all -- could have been my fault; added lemon juice to the butter/sugar mixture before the eggs--so didn't bother making the frosting. Abandoned layer cake idea and ate plain flat rounds.

Ok Purists look away. I am only giving 3 forks because I changed the recipe. The results were fantastic. I used 4 large eggs instead of 3 x-large and it was fine. Then I made the raspberry curd from the lemon cake with respberry curd and whipped cream from this site in between each layer of cake. I used the icing for this recipe and substituted lemon juice for lemonade as others had suggested. When I iced it I made little hearts on top with the leftover curd and smeared the sides a little as well. People are still talking about it a month later and I am still thinking about it infact I am about to ice another. It was dense and delicious and I am looking forward to dessert this evening.

I made this cake for my mother's birthday and it was both beautful and absolutely scruptious! I used fresh strawberries and blueberries for the filling (cooked as another viewer recommended with a little sugar and vanilla) and topped the cake with more fresh berries. I baked the cake in only 2 layers and about 5 minutes less than the recommended time so it was nice and moist. Eliminated the frozen lemonade from the frosting in favor of a bit of lemon zest and juice. A perfect summer cake!

This recipe is fantastic! With fresh strawberries in season now, there was no way I was going to cook frozen strawberries. Instead, I sliced 16 ounces of fresh Oregon strawberries, added a drop of vanilla and a tablespoon of sugar (probably didn't even need that). The frosting is SO delicious! I had many requests for the recipe, for good reason! Yum, yum, yum!

This cake got rave reviews from everyone I fed it to. I always set my time for 5-7 minutes less and then check for doneness. Both times I have made it, it was done 5 minutes early. I did have a little difficulty with frosting on the first one. The strawberry filling blended with the frosting and created red streaks on the side of the cake. I solved that problem on the second try by cooking the filling to a thicker consistency. A previous review mentioned substituting lemon juice for the lemonade in the frosting. That would allow for more powdered sugar and a less goopy frosting. I'll try that the next time. I also won't garnish the cake with fresh berries until just before serving. They don't look very pretty the next day. I found this cake is best if served at room temperature so the thicker frosting would probably stand up better. Yes, the cake is a bit flat and dense, but it has a tender crumb and great flavor. This one goes into my permanent file.

I have made this beautiful cake several times; in fact, I have used the entire garden party menu from BA 06/95 at least twice (different guests, of course) and received rave reviews. The cake is lovely--icing is a bit runny, but many cream cheese icings are. Refrigeration fixed that right up. Cake tastes great with great texture--one of my all-time favorites.

This cake is delicious. The baking time should be reduced to 25 min. to avoid burnt cake bottoms. I pureed frozen strawberries and used it in the frosting in place of the lemon. It slided during assembly but after chilling for 30 min. was easy to repair. I would chill the frosting before putting on the cake to avoid sliding.

i bake this in a 9 X 12 pan for 30 minutes, didn't do the strawberry thing...frosted the cake with the recipe frosting, cut the cake in squares, melted some current jelly, sliced strawberries in half, sliced the halves into fans and glazed them with the melted jelly.... it was very good, a hit at a party...not too sweet.. i will make it again.

My boyfried made this cake for me for my birthday and we were both very happy with the results. Although the layers did stay very flat (didn't seem to rise at all), they were still very moist and delicious. He substituted blueberries in the layer and on top instead of strawberries, and we really enjoyed the flavor of the lemon cream-cheese frosting with the blueberries. He also did reduce the amount of liquid in the frosting as other reviewers had suggested, and the resulting frosting was perfectly spreadable. Overall I thought it was a very nice lemon layer cake recipe.

Hi Everyone. I was one of the brave souls who took this recipe on as my own personal culinary challenge in spite of the dismal failures that many others had with it. I thought I would be a success story, encouraging others to give it a shot and have faith in their abilities! Oh, how wrong I was. This recipe is flawed from start to finish, as many others stated. The cake was flat and overcooked as there is too much time alloted for baking. There was not quite enough batter for 3 cake pans actually, so it baked too fast. The amount of filling, although tasty, was much too much for the thin cakes to withstand. The frosting had no real binder to keep it together. It was a goopy mess!!! I made everything EXACTLY as the recipe called for. No substitutes. AND I refrigerated the frosting and filling overnight and baked the cake the day before. PLEASE do not bother. My personal promise is that I will never attempt another recipe unless 3-4 forks always prevail on each review.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. After reading the previous reviews I was careful to keep everything in the fridge at all times. It came out perfectly and was so tasty and refreshing. I cheated and used strawberry jam, but hey, who can blame me. The frosting is to die for and would go great on any white or fruit cake.

This tasted okay but what it should be renamed "Strawberry, Lemon & Buttermilk Mess." After reading the reviews, I kept the frosting chilled which helped to stiffen it. However, the strawberry jam in the middle mixed with the lemon frosting and then dripped all over the place. I am very careful when I bake cakes. If the recipe said to stand on my head, I would do it. So the problem is this recipe. I thought I could rescue this cake by frosting the sides, but there wasn't enough frosting to do the top and the side. The cake itself is good and the frosting is passable with some adjustments (omit the lemonade and use lemon juice), but definitely skip the strawberry filling. I won't bother with this one again as there are many other excellent recipes on this website.

This cake was delicious. I really wanted a strawberry cake, so I omitted the lemon flavorings and instead pureed about 6 oz of frozen, sweetened strawberries, adding the puree to the batter before alternating the flour/milk additions. I forgot to get buttermilk at the store and so used regular milk. Lined the cake pans with parchment paper to make sure the cakes didn't get too well-done. Also, I used a basic buttercream frosting (also on Epicurious)as filling and frosting. The cake was moist and quite flavorful; it's density was "cut" by a sligtly refined flavor. It tasted like it came from a pastry shop. Made it for a barbeque, and the entire cake was gone in less than 24 hours. I'll definitely make this one again, it's going into my permanent recipe book.

This was fantastic! I made this for a birthday, there was heavy competition with a homemade Dobos Torte(that was to die for) and an ice cream cake - everyone loves ice cream cake. But mine was a winner! I got great compliments.I followed the previous reviews and used fresh lemon juice in the icing. I had no problems at all with runnyness. I cooked the strawberrys down to pretty thick and after putting it on the 2 layers I put them in the fridge to set. I recommend making the whole cake the night before, then put the decorative strawberries on top before serving. Also someone mention to make sure the layer are totally cooled off before putting the strawberries and icing on it. Great easy recipe! I think I will have a slice now!

This recipe sounded so good, but was so disappointing. It was heavy and dry, and hardly raised at all. Maybe it's the cake flour? Is there a brand that also has a leavening agent in it?

This cake was wonderful! I made it for a birthday party and everyone raved. The slices were so pretty with the layers of red strawberries and white frosting. I topped the cake with strawberries dipped in white chocolate, stunning! Reading the other reviews, I was forwarned about the runny frosting and completely omitted the lemonade. It was still quite loose, but I think the key is to make sure the butter and cream cheese are at a cool room temp (65 degrees) before making the frosting. I was able to pipe a basketweave with it, but it definately had to stay in the fridge. I was in search of a cake with unique flavors (tired of chocolate and yellow cakes) and this was a definate winner. For those who found the cake dry and heavy, maybe you overbaked it because this cake was definately tender and moist if baked properly.

I don't understand the people who don't like this cake or had a hard time with it. Its wonderful. Yes, the icing is runny but it works if your patient. Chill the frosted cake before adding strawberry garnish and they won't slide off. I put my berries on early in the day and by serving time some of the juice ran down the sides of the cake and it was so pretty. I've been told by guests who ate this cake that it was the best cake they have ever eaten. It is one of my favorite cakes now and I wouldn't hesitate to make it for guests. Don't be daunted by people who have had bad results...everytime I've made it its been fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!!!

I agree with another reviewer that this cake was dry and much too heavy. There wasn't much lemon flavor to it. The strawberries made a mess and you'd do much better by using a strawberry jam. I wouldn't go throught the trouble of makeing it again. Lemon cake, to me, should be lighter in texture.

Let me start out by saying I'm a very experienced baker (I've taken professional baking courses and have made about a gazillion cake over the years) and I made this cake EXACTLY per the recipe and instructions -- no substitutions, no monkeying around with quantities -- and it was possibly the worst-tasting cake I ever made ... heavy, dry and leaden. The cooked-down strawberries in syrup ended up essentially a batch of jam. I could've saved time by just spreading a layer of strawberry jam or preserves between the cake layers. And the frosting, although delicious, was very soft even after being refrigerated overnight. In fact, after putting the cake together and refrigerating it for a couple of hours, the whole berries on top were starting to slide off the finished cake. The only good part of the cake was the fresh strawberries on top, which we dipped in frosting and ate before tossing the rest of the cake in the garbage can. Don't waste your time and ingredients on this disaster. I gave this recipe a one-fork rating only because there wasn't a category marked "minus-4 forks".

Rating: 3
I made this cake for Easter and everyone loved it. I chilled the assembled, unfrosted cake tightly covered in plastic wrap overnight allowing both the strawberries and the frosting to set. This kept the strawberry filling from seeping through the frosting and kept the cake stable while applying the frosting. I also put a thin layer of frosting on and allowed it to chill for a while and then put the final frosting layer and strawberries on.

I thought the icing consistency was fine. It could get runny if sitting out in a warm room. I refridgerated leftovers. Buttermilk was great complement to lemon, gives a little depth to the tang. I served with extra strawberry couli. Use only fresh strawberries to garnish as my frozen ones bled on the top of the cake. Still, delicious and rich with a light feeling.

Rating: 3
This is delicious and was raved about by my guests, but icing recipe is WAY TOO runny. I left out butter, changed to lemon extract instead of lemonade, and added more lemon peel. Also needs more powdered sugar to have right consistency. I split each layer of cake (layers are not very high) and filled with strawberry compote. Then iced all three with cream cheese icing and sliced strawberries before stacking up and icing top.

Rating: 3
I'm intimidated by any layer cake but this one was pretty simple...well worth the effort as my friends were impressed! The cake layers came out moist & slightly tangy, and the frosting was also a little runny for me (harden it by placing it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes, or decrease lemonade concentrate, as another reviewer suggested). I would also use fresh sliced strawberries next time instead of cooked frozen sweetened ones, even though the syrup soaked into the cake layer below for a nice effect. I only needed 1 pint of fresh strawberries for the cake top. Yum!

This moist cake is full of lemon flavor and can hold its own with all or very minimum frosting...a great birthday surprise for my husband's father. Taking advantage of this summer's blueberry bumper crop, we made a compote with blueberries, creme de cassis and sugar and used this as the filling, topping the cake with fresh berries, lemon zest and frosting. Next time, we'll cut the layers in half and alternate compote and frosting. This is a great recipe we'll make again....even had my mother-in-law--not a dessert lover--licking the bowl as we made it!

I've made this recipe twice, and it is delicious! (The only "flaw" would be the runny frosting, which is easily remedied by decreasing the amount of lemonade concentrate.) I didn't bother with making a cooked filling, and instead used fresh, sliced strawberries and the frosting between the layers and on top. It's as beautiful as it is tasty! Perhaps the previous reviewer could concoct something close to the recipe as written before declaring it a bad recipe. Or, this chef could add a cup of pickle relish and bake in the microwave and curse the recipe further :)

I was very disappointed with this cake. It was more like a pound cake, didn't seem to rise. As suggested, I cut back the sugar to 1.5 cups. Wanted to take it to work and HAD to put the icing on, to improve the flavor, the icing being the best part. Wished I would have used 1.75 c sugar. I also added poppyseeds as suggested. I put most of it in a medium bundt pan, wasn't totally done after 35 minutes. Didn't use strawberries. Will not make again.

I read all the reviews before attempting this, and I'm glad I did. It came out beautifully and was a real hit at the dinner party. It isn't as hard as it looks, although it does take some time to complete. It's crucial to make sure all ingredients are refrigerated or cooled to room temperature (the baked cakes, strawberry layer, etc) because if you're working with hot materials, they don't have the stability you need for a 3-layer cake. Anyway, my own substitutions: For the frosting: instead of lemonade concentrate, I used storebought lemon curd (3 very generous tablespoons), 1/8 cup of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, and the lemon zest. I still needed to add probably a total of 2/3 cups of more powdered sugar than what was called for. I only had 8 oz. cream cheese so I substituted the missing 2 oz. for a cream cheese/cream mix that you can find in the dairy products sections of stores catering to a large hispanic community.

I always make a sample in a small pan first, before I bake any cake I really likes the texture and moisture of this cake.

I tried to make this cake twice and it did not come out. It did not rise at all the first time. The second time it only rose half way. I made modifications the second time. 2.5 tsp of baking soda,2 cups of sugar, 4 ex large eggs. None of the reviews I read state a similar problem. Also the frosting recipe called for too much liquid. I had to adjust the amount of powdered sugar to make it work. Next time I will decrease to 5 tsp of lemon. Otherwise, I think the frosting was wonderful but a bit too lemony. I think the cake will be great too if I can get it to rise all the way.

I made this cake in the middle of a hot Georgia summer day, with the dryer running, sweat pouring down. But you know what? A lot of love went into it, and it was the best tasting cake I have ever made in my life. People were speechless at the presentation and flavor, and there wasn't a single crumb left. Superb, delicious, easy, perfect. Make it NOW!

Easier than it sounds recipe. In between layers I skipped the frosting over the strawberries and it emphasized the flavors more plus they didn't budge. I made the cake itself a day ahead and followed the directions, perfect! The strawberries were also done the day before and refridgerated with no problem in use the next day. It makes a spectacular display!

Thought it was okay, but not great. I substituted 1 tsp. lemon extract because I didn't have any lemon zest. The flavor was lemony, and slightly buttery tasting, very dense. Not as flavorful as I'd hoped... :(

I took EVERYBODY'S advice and I'm glad I did. I didn't bother with the icing, either. Decreased sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups and added 1 Tablsp poppy seeds and 1/8 teasp Penzey's lemon extract. Put it in a greased and floured bundt cake pan and baked it for 35minutes. It was brilliant, served with slices of fresh mango. Remember to add the flour mixture SLOWLY or flour will clump and fall to the bottom. Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving.

The cake had a very good favor. Very moist. Next time I would cut back the sugar. Everyone loved it. I will keep this receipe and make as one of my regulars.

Made this cake for a light summer desert. Cake flour is hard to find here, so I substituted about 1/3 cornflour, and the texture was very tender and fine, yet still dense. It has a lovely simple flavour, and a delicate crumb. Didn't make the frosting (not really big on them), instead I sandwiched the layers with whipped cream with lemon zest and a bit of limoncello folded in and served a mixture of fresh strawberries, kiwifruit and nectarines to spoon over. Yum!

I add 120gm of fresh chopped dates to the dry ingredient (coated thoroughly) before adding it to the butter mixture and omit the frosting...it taste just great.

This cake requires a little bit of work, but it's worth it. I used many of the tips that were mentioned, so I thought I'd include some of my own. The frosting is a bit runny, so I did not include the lemonade concentrate. Instead, I added about a tablespoon of lemon zest. Because fresh strawberries were in season, I sliced them up and put them between the layers of cake. Bake this cake and you'll be flooded with compliments!!

Excellent cake and easy to make. For a change, I baked it in a 10" bundt pan, omitted the frosting, and sprinkled it with powdered sugar.

I'd made this right out of an old bon appetit at least three times before.. it is such a great dessert for spring. But then I looked at this site and saw all the reviews - most said it was good but either the frosting was too runny or the berries were too many. Well I made it yesterday and was careful to cool everything just right and it all came out absolutely beautifully! I got so many compliments and it is perfect, as is recommended, served with a great big bowl of lightly sweetened strawberries. A tip for others: Make sure to cool everything to room temperature and even chill the strawberry filling. Also before you place the layers on top of one another, be sure to spread frosting all around the top of the two bottom layers on the outsides to keep the berry filling from squelching out the sides. But the cake is flavorful, light yet interesting, and absolutely gorgeous.

I wish I would have read the reviews before I made this cake. I still would have made it, but maybe my frosting would not have been so runny. I kept adding powder suger until I had none left! It still turned out beautiful, and everyone seemed to like it. I would bake it again, but would be more cautious when adding the lemon concentrate.

I agree with the other cook - the frosting was runny and I had to add more powdered sugar (which I feel changed the taste of the frosting). Also, I think the cake would have been better with a true cream cheese frosting and let the lemon from the cake come through on it's own (combo of cake and frosting was a lot of lemon). I served it at a dinner party and everyone liked it a lot, though. It's a beautiful cake! Also, the layers slid around a lot. I was nervous it would fall apart, so chilling it is a must.

While the cake turned out beautifully, the frosting was a bit runny and needed more powdered sugar added in order reach a spreadable consistency. It also needed to be refrigerated for several hours before serving.

The frosting is delicious, but don't add the berries until the last minute; they bleed. The cake had an excellent crumb. I used 1 tsp lemon oil instead of the grated rind in the cake. Made a spectacular birthday cake with candles inserted into the strawberries (before putting them on the cake). Reducing the frozen strawberries down to 2/3 cup was a bit too much; got them too firm. I used a tip from The Cake Bible and boiled them down in the microwave so they didn't burn. Be careful of boiling over, though.
