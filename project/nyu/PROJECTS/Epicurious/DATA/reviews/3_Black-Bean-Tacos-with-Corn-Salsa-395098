Ya, didn't sound very appetizing with the baking method, so this is what I did.... I had some corn from the cob, so I sliced that off, sauteed some onions and garlic with a crunch of salt and pepper from the grindern and threw in bell pepper to the nix, as well as the fresh steamed corn. I ADDED Paprika but no chiles since I'm giving it to the kids (going to try anyhow) and have some salsa we made a couple days ago to top it. I ALSO FRIED THE TORTILLAS so they could be hard shell tex mex style with the corn and all. I MIXED the beans and corn mix together to stuff as you go, fun make your own at the table, "Please pass the beans!" Fun, easy, veggie/vegan meal for dinner with the kids...

Terrible filling. OK salsa. Won't make again. I've never had luck with Self recipes. This confirms I won't try them again.

This is a good, quick healthy dinner. Not great, as people have said. But it is HEALTHY. So of course it isn't going to be as good as a big ol' plate of buttered potatoes and a steak. So, that being said, the chili powder amount is overpowering. I will knock that back next time and just add hot sauce if it isn't hot enough. All I tasted was HOT. Had to add water to the bean mixture. It was pretty dry. I took it out of the oven 5 minutes early on the 2nd time around as it was getting dry. It was crispy on the outside, and nice and gooey on the inside. the salsa was good. I'd add some diced tomato to the mix as well as a little more salt. I really missed the creamy element of cheese and/or sour cream. I think I'll add a dollop of sour cream next time. Will definitely make again with these modifications.

This recipe really needs help. Here's how I fixed it: I used two cans of black beans, and added two chipotle chilis in adobo and chili powder. Rather than bake the bean mixture, I sauteed it with a little vegetable oil. This made it more like refried beans than crumbly. I also added cilantro and lime to the salsa. Next time, I'll fire roast the bell pepper and corn.

The bean mixture was tasteless and dry - I would not make this again. The corn salsa was average. I was ready to toss the remainder of the bean mixture down the drain, but my husband said he would eat it as he does not like to waste anything. Yuck!

This is awful. The bean mixture is terribly dry and pretty much inedible.

It was healthy, but beans + rolled oats + cornmeal does not = a good meat substitute. I couldn't find additive-free canned black beans at my local supermarket, so I used cannellinis, but I doubt it would have made much of a difference. The rest of the ingredients inspired me to make additional salsa to eat as a salad, though, with the addition of avocado and more corn.

I added lettuce and shredded cheese to the tacos and my family ate them up. Even my husband later admitted to liking the black bean 'bits'. I did use 2 cans of black beans and added just a tbsp of water or so to get it all mixed. May have helped with the drying people are mentioning. Also I added corn, bell pepper and a little lime to store bought salsa.

I agree that the bean mixture was dry but the flavor was delicious. I added some salsa to moisten it after it baked and thought that helped a bit. Also, I only baked for a total of 15 minutes. Also, when topped with a ripe avocado you get some creaminess too. Very easy to pull together and tasty--a winner.

Very tasty, but much too dry. I'm not sure why the recipe calls for it to be cooked so much. I would make again, but cut the baking time WAY down. The alternative to the dryness would be mixing in a little salsa as another cook suggested.

If you are looking for a mexican dish, this is not it. Don't ever put red bell pepers, corn or oatmeal in a taco, least of all a bean taco. Real mexican food is much simpler and teaster, just fry your beans adding Maggi Sauce and Worchestair. Warm de tortillas so they ramain soft. Fill them, do not over fill!, with the beans, and serve with green or red salsa. (For salsa, just blend together green or red tomatoes, a piece of onion, a few serrano chiles, salt and a garlic clove).

I tried this recipe today for lunch, scaled it down for one person, was a good idea but it was too dry as some reviewers noted. I think i'll play around with it because it's so healthy and satisfying.

I found my food processor had a hard time mixing this well and added some juice from packaged salsa to make it a bit wetter. So, my black bean crumbles were a little softer, but the flavor was great! Everyone loved it, and we will make it again. We added some diced jalopeno and avocado to the salsa and served fat free greek yogurt (instead of sour cream) on the side to cool the heat. A great filling and nutritious meal under 500 calories.

I am far from a vegetarian, but this recipe did not make me miss the meat. The bean crumbles are crunchy and delcious. So flavorful. I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I both agreed that the corn salsa is very good. I personally didn't like the texture of the black bean part. but, if it was softer I think it will be better. i will make this again, but will play with the ingredients.

This is a great spring/summer recipe. Also don't be fooled by the vegi-only aspect of this dish. I am a hyper meat-a-tarian but did not find myself missing meat due to the savory flavoring of the black beans. It is a very fresh and clean tasting dish perfect for hot weather. The only change I would make is prior to chopping up the green chili one should slightly char it over your open gas stove top or grill. It will provide the green chili with a much more authentic southwest flavor. Charring also takes away some of the "bite" green chili often have making it blend smoothly into the rest of the dish instead of ridgeidly standing out.
