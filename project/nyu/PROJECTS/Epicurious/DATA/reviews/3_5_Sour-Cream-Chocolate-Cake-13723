My sister who has no idea how to make a cake threw this together for Christmas dinner and it was delicious. Moist and dense. Chocolatey enough. Frosting is especially good, the sour cream gives it a very nice tang. My family are cake snobs and they loved it.

I made this with lactose free sour cream and margerine to meet dietary requirements and it was very, very good. I served it sans frosting and lightly dusted with icing sugar with some pomegranate arils and non dairy raspberry gelati to rave reviews by all.

This has become my go-to recipe for chocolate cake. All our friends love it and I often get asked for the recipe. I make it as one cake and usually leave the chocolate out of the frosting to make more of a vanilla frosting which I then decorate with raspberries to make it look pretty.

I've probably made over 20 different chocolate cake recipes over the years and was a little disappointed with this one. But to be fair, I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Perhaps if I had of it might have turned out better. I added the cocoa to the (boiling) water and then when cool added vanilla and s.cream, rather than adding to the dry ingredients. I beat the mix well to incorporate air, rather than just mixing. I don't like layer cakes, so cooked it in a 9inch pan for nearly 45 minutes. The finished cake rose just over an inch high with large cracks in the top. It had a dense texture more suited to a dessert style cake rather than a coffee/tea/birthday cake like I'd wanted. The flavor is delicious though - not too bitter. I will try again, but next time I'll layer it and reduce my oven temp slightly.

This is a fine cake. I would not describe the cake as moist--it is more "cakey," which is not my personal preference for cake. However, if you like a traditional cakey texture (however, not one that is especially light and springy), you will probably like this cake. The frosting is good, although somewhat sour (I used Nancy's cultured cream cheese, so maybe that is why), which makes it less kid-friendly. (I made it for my son's birthday.) The frosting recipe makes a large amount, so don't be stingy about slathering it between the layers; you'll have plenty for the top and sides. Although I enjoyed the cake, I probably won't make it again--still searching for a moister chocolate cake recipe. Also, just had to post this quote, said by pastry chef Alex Stupak, which I just read in the New Yorker: "Birthday cake is the most denatured thing on earth."

The best chocolate cake! All my friends love it. I make this for all birthdays and special occasions. I make it as one cake, so only make 1/2 of the icing. I use a bit less butter than suggested in the icing, make sure that the chocolate isn't too hot or it will split the icing.

This wonderful cake does not deserve the bad reviews. I agree that other people's poor results must be due to dutch process cocoa. I found the cake and frosting both exceptionally good without being too fussy to make. I made it yesterday for the first time and served it last night . Everyone said it was the best chocolate cake on the planet. I garnished it liberally with fresh raspberries, which looked gorgeous and added just the right note of brightness.

yummmmm... turn out fantastic. My husband who doesn't like chocolate cake even liked it. As for me, who there is no such thing as too chocolaty, this satisfied the chocolate craving. Do make the frosting... it helped balance out the flavors.

this is a great recipe, i am not sure about why so many negative reviews. This goes so well with butter cream that it was an instant hit. I know plain cake is bland, and less sweet but no way it was 'stale' i freezed it for 3 days before frosting and it turned out great. my favorite choc cake now.

Didn't make the cake but made the frosting. DIVINE!!! So delicious, rich but not too sweet. I'll try the cake when I track down some cocoa that's not dutch processed.

I found this recipe about 2 yrs ago when I was looking for a good chocolate cake for my grandchildren's birthdays. It was a huge success; moist, chocolatey, and the best I'd ever tasted! The negative reviews posted are totally inaccurate. I don't know what went wrong. The only change I made was to substitute 1/3 cup coffee for the water. You don't taste the coffee; it just intensifies the chocolate flavor. (Ina Garten, "Barefoot Contessa") Two suggestions: Use a good quality cocoa (I used Ghiradelli) and beat on lowest speed after adding eggs, only until eggs are combined. I make this recipe anytime I need a chocolate cake!

Tonight I noticed that my sour cream was on its way out so I set out to use it in something delicious. I stumbled across this recipe, had all the ingredients, and decided to make it. What a pleasant surprise! I ended up with a moist, fluffy, and not too sweet yet plenty chocolately cake. I skipped on the frosting because I had some god awful store bought stuff in my fridge that I needed to use up but next time I shall attempt!

This cake is one of my personal favs! I just graduated from NECI and while I was there I made a cake very similar to this all the time. It is most and delicious and definitely for the person whom you love that isn't so much of a chocolate person. Mmmm!!!! One thing I would say is that you could replace the cocoa powder for semi sweet chocolate and it would be much richer. Also for you folks who...ahem! that don't read the cocoa powder label correctly it will work much better for you. Just to clarify, what you were describing is clearly an issue with the cocoa powder, it's very likely that you were using dutch process....I'm sorry to admit.

This cake turned out very well - rich and moist and chocolatey. I used vanilla buttercream instead of the chocolate frosting. I'm just guessing, but I think some of the people who are unhappy with the way their cake turned out might be using dutch-process cocoa. IMO Dutch process cocoa will make the cake bland.

I made this cake for Valentine's Day, and it was a hit! It's the moistest chocolate cake I've ever made from scratch, and also the most flavorful. The frosting was light, fluffy, and delicious. I chose the chocolate on chocolate combo because that's what my boyfriend likes, but next time I make this cake, I think I'll choose another frosting. It's very rich and dense, and you'll definitely want some milk, preferably a tall glass!

Was getting ready to delete this recipe and wanted to BEG you--puleeeze do not bother with this cake. Uuuuugh. This one's worth leaving two bad ratings. I thought, for some stupid reason, it might be better the 2nd day. Just tried it. It's not. Have you ever bought a cheap, off-brand chocolate snack cake, took one bite, gagged, and trashed it? This cake is worse than that. It's so dry and bland, just like it's stale, only much worse because it's nearly tasteless too. Yeeeewwww!

Don't waste paper and ink printing this recipe. Blah...terribly dry and bland. Yucky. Gross. The icing was pretty good. I'd give it 2 1/2 forks. Buy a Duncan Hines cake mix first. It would be cheaper and way, way better.

This cake sounded great in theory, but was a disappointment. It did not have a rich, chocolate flavour and was dry. My daughter commented that it looked stale (we all agreed.) Save your butter and cream cheese for something better.

Very easy recipe to follow, but a little too rich and chocolately for me!

Pretty good. Checked cakes at 20 mins and both came out clean on tester. Frosting just a wee stiff and hard to spread (maybe overbeated?). Not sure what I did wrong. Used Calder Dairy Sour Cream, Philidelphia Whipped Cream Cheese, Hersheys cocoa and chocolate. Cake was a little more crumbly than I expected. Took 2 glasses of milk to eat (though the cake was very moist).

One minute the cake wasn't cooked, the next it was and it came out dry. I thought the frosting wasn't sweet enough, but maybe that's just my taste.

I cook a lot of chocolate cakes (my favorite) and this is absolutely one of the best. None of that too-sweet sickly frosting from other cakes; the sour cream gave it just enough kick to make you want more. The cake itself is also great - not too dry and crumbly - holds up well with the frosting. I made the cake segments, then froze them for my daughter's birthday, then frosted it the day of the party. Worked perfectly. (Don't overcook the cake.)

7/19/99--I made 2 of these cakes this past weekend and was very pleased with the results. The folks eating these really liked the fact that they were NOT "sickeningly sweet" like most chocolate cake & frosting recipes are. I will probably use this icing recipe on other chocolate cakes to help cut their sweetness! NOTE: I used Callebaut chocolate in the frosting with superb results. This imported chocolate, which is from Belgium, beats all U.S. brands hands down.

I used the recipe to make a "hill" cake for a 40th birthday. I doubled the cake ingredients line by line and the recipe adjusted perfectly -- no problem with proportion. A note to people who may use a glass pan: adjust the oven temp down 25 degrees, and if you're using a professional oven, adjust down 25 degrees again. I baked this cake (the doubled recipe) at 300 degrees, in two glass 13x9's in my Viking and a toothpick came out clean at just a little over 30 minutes, just as the recipe said. Additionally, I chose this recipe knowing the cake would slice well for the tiered design I chose for the hill (as it was similarly doctored for the tepee cake recipe). And it did, perfectly. The hill was lovely, complete with grass, earth, animals. So science isn't its problem; it simply wasn't an outstanding recipe. The raves at the party had more to do with the design than with the cake itself. (Although a couple of the guys went back for seconds). Could its signature sour cream be its downfall? Heeding the warning of one reader who said it wasn't sweet enough for a birthday cake, I did add more sugar to the frosting. Alas, I still didn't fall in love with the preparation. Favorite chocolate cake recipe remains the Silver Palate's bittersweet choc cake. Still seeking a homemade choc layer cake recipe. But would be happy to share my award winning French Silk Pie recipe!

A really delicous and easy cake recipe - the frosting was perfect. I made it the day before I served it and it was still moist and tasty.

Too bitter, not really to be recommended for a birthday cake.
