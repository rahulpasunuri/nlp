Simple but delicious side dish that is quick to prepare. Some reviewers say it is nothing special, but it has lots of flavor.

This is a great salad although a bit on the spicy side. My Texan palate enjoyed the spice but my north eastern fiance said 'tone it down next time'.

a nice, substantive side dish

Taking multiple reviewers' suggestions into account... I made the recipe as stated, put it on a bed of mixed greens, added some sesame seeds for extra flavor, and topped everything with some Morningstar "Chick'n Strips" that I sauteed in a little canola and olive oil. The end result was a light but delicious and satisfying main course.

This is easy and yummy. I only gave it 3 forks because, as other reviewers noted, it isn't a "wow" dish. But my kids really liked it, and I'm always looking for new ways to prepare veggies for them.

I used a balsamic vinegar instead of the rice vinegar. It turned out interesting and my wife likes it as well.

Very good recipe. I only used about 1/2 the oregano called for. I also used grape tomatoes rather than cherry tomatoes; you'll need less if you use the grape ones.

Geez Louise, this is very tasty and liked by my young child and husband. I'd love to read the better recipes, however.

OK - broccoli and tomatoes with a mustard vinaigrette - so what? Nothing special and if the veggies are exceptional, a waste. Lots of better ways to use them.

It looks pretty, but the salad is not great. There are other, better recipes for broccoli and fresh cherry tomatoes.

Blah, nothing special. There's nothing wrong with this salad but there's nothing particularly right about it either.

Quick, easy, and flavorful salad. But obviously nothing special. I ate this as a main course with some whole grain toast and was quite satisfied.

This was an easy and very flavorful salad. I made it a couple of hours ahead of time and let all of the flavors mix together. It was very refreshing and was great with grilled rosemary chicken and wild rice.

Good, easy dish perfect for a summer buffet. I sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds for extra flavour. Tastes great the second day too but broccoli has lost its pretty, bright colour by then.
