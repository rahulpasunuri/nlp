The gravy in this recipe is delicious and absolutely my favorite part of special meals. I now make it for every holiday. It takes the pressure off of making the gravy with the pan drippings. I can prepare it in advance and still have the most amazing gravy. My daughter, who is 6, LOVES it. So happy I found this recipe. I am not exaggerating when I say it has changed my life.

No doubt this is delicious, but I'm not crazy about the soy influence. I think I'll just use 2T next time. Christopher Ranch now makes roasted garlic (bag of five smaller bags is only $2.50) if you're in a pinch.

This is my one and only gravy recipe, Its really difficult to find a good vegetarian gravy but this is perfect. It has a fantastic flavor and perfect texture. I've now made it multiple times and its so simple I dont even have to look at the recipe, I dont add the parsnip or wine though and its still great! I made it for a birthday gathering (full of meat eatters) and got only praises and begs for the recipe. To day I'm putting it in a vegetarian pot pie, with fake chicken and even putting the veggies from making the stock (always always always make your own!)and putting the in the pie!I love this recipe!

I don't know what tracy102503 is talking about, I made this recipe exactly as described and both the potatoes and gravy were fantastic. Some of the best gravy I've ever made, and you can add the leftover stock vegetables to the potatoes because they are full of flavor. Will definitely be making this again

Followed the recipe, didn't make any substitutions. The potatoes were fine, but I believe my guests would have preferred something that appeared smoother. The gravy was not good at all. It did not taste like gravy, and smelled odd. I always get compliments on dishes I have found on Epicurious. No one commented on the dish besides confusion. I will not be making this again.

I made the recipe exactly as written. The potatoes were flavorful and the gravy fantastic. You would never know it's vegetarian. I suggest you simmer the gravy for 20 minutes to thicken it up.

I too was short on time so I used veggie broth with good results. The roasted garlic is a great technique to add flavor to sauces. Also liked the idea of using some of the potato water with the potatoes.

I used homemade chicken broth for the gravy and when i saw that you added all the butter and olive oil in to the potato to mash and then poured the gravy I decided to put a little bit of butter to help mash the potato and then used the gravy as the rest of the liquid for the mashed potato. It was incredible!

I was short on time so I used 28oz of canned vegetable stock but still added the wine and soy sauce. Will definitely try again with the full recipe, but it was a huge hit at dinner and we even had to bring out more bread to mop it up with! Delicious!

I just made the gravy part to put on the table at Thanksgiving. Am planning to used the leftovers for biscuits and gravy breakfast! Really fragrant and delicious with anything you'd put gravy on. It thickened up after refrigerating.

The potatoes were SO good! Fluffy and delicious. I only added 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp oil. They'd be fine with even less. I didn't like the way the stock turned out (I followed the recipe exactly minus the bay leaf), so I was worried the gravy wouldn't be good. It also didn't thicken enough in 3 minutes for me--I had to cook it for ~20 minutes. In the end, it tasted and looked fabulous. Great recipe.

The stock is fantastic. I will definitely add soy sauce to my stocks from now on.

Pretty darn good veggie gravy. I roasted more garlic than it called for and it will be a great substitution from the meat based gravy.

Exceptionally tasty gravy. I would replace this gravy with meat-based gravy for future meals. Tangy and delicious. I cut the butter for the gravy in half and added a little bit of the vegetable stock to the mashed potatoes instead of oil. Yum!

My sister is a vegetarian so, for holiday meals, I always make sure that there is a gravy she can enjoy. This one is rich and a wonderful color. When making any meatless stock, the last thing I do before pressing and straining it, is to loosely puree the ingredients either with an immersion blender or regular blender in order to get the most flavor.

This was sooo good. It will be the official gravy in my house from now on. Skipped the leek and parsnip and used a pre-packaged mirepoix (chopped onion, celery and carrot), and added additional onion to it. This was rather time- consuming, but none of the steps are difficult and it makes quite a lot of gravy. (Wonder if it can be frozen?) Also followed the potato recipe, and the oil and butter made it delicious (also added a splash of cream).

No review, since I haven't tried the recipe, but what happened to good old MASHED potatoes? Why are they now always smashed?
