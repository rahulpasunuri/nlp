Divine! First, if you don't know Circa 1886, you should. It is one of the best restaurants in Charleston, SC behind Wentworth Mansion and they serve up a wonderful breakfast to guests, these included. From reading prior reviews some cooks have had issue with items here or there, but try again and you shall be rewarded. Come on folks, these are some the most highly requested sticky buns served by an acclaimed restaurant and now, from the warmth of your home thanks to this recipe post; I only wish this recipe was my secret. Make as is, share the other pan with friends and family and you will receive high praise just as I have! I previously made for Christmas morning and I am now working another batch for Easter.

Whatever you do, DO NOT make this glaze! It turns into some kind of lava on the bottom of the pan. Plain light corn syrup is MUCH easier and MUCH better! The dough was okay but the directions are misleading. You need to mix in about 4 cups or flour before you try to knead it. Also, at least double the cinnamon and sugar. I would not make this recipe again.

This recipe makes great sticky buns! Don't pull them out of the oven too soon, though. I did, after seeing how dark they were getting and worrying they were burning. They will turn a dark color before they're finished, but they won't taste burned.

My favorite recipe for Sticky Buns. It makes a difference if you refrigerate the dough overnight, it becomes richer and has a nicer texture. I have an issue with the way the recipe was written, though. Directions are a bit unclear on a few points. Next time I will make extra glaze, cook it down a bit and pour it over the finished buns.

oops! My review was actually supposed to be for THESE sticky buns... who would have thought there were 2 Ultimate Sticky Buns on this site? http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/The-Ultimate-Sticky-Buns-395092?which=reviewRecipeLink&editReview=true

These buns were RIGHTEOUS! I LOVED them. Talk about divine. They are very rich and definitely have way to much butter for the nutritionally conscious, but they are spectacular and will only be reserved for special occasions like Easter and Christmas. YOU GOTTA MAKE THESE just as they are written!

FANTASTIC! For the glaze, I used closer to 1/2c honey and 1/4c pure maple syrup (no corn syrup). I omitted the water and brought all the ingredients to a boil over medium heat for about 60 seconds. I saved about 1c of the glaze to brush on the tops of the sticky buns before inverting them onto a plate. I used standard cake pans, and the glaze boiled over and started a little fire in the oven... NBD. This is my new go to recipe for sticky buns.

Best Stickies ever! Made these yesterday and refrigerated overnight before the 2nd rising. I substituted bread flour. Also, per other reviews I reserved 1/2 the glaze for after (cooked it in the microwave before drizzling), substituted half of honey with corn syrup (I used light). These were absolute perfection! Texture, visual appearance were spot on and they were oh so gooey. A dry, crunchy sticky bun is, well, not a sticky bun. Next time I will do everything the same but add more cinnamon.

mmmmm . . . these are yummy!

These are A-MAZE-ING!I did however make some changes: I didn't let the stickies proof the second time, I just piled them into the pan and threw them in the oven. This yields a smaller more doughy bun, which I tend to like. I also substituted light corn syrup since I didn't have the dark, and only baked for 23-25 min. at 350, per other reviews. I also did 9 tsp sugar and 5 tsp cinnamon for inside the buns. I put all of this into a shaker for easier application. I did use half the glaze in the bottom of the pan, but next time I think I will use 1/4 of the batch of glaze in each pan and then use the other 1/2 to top the stickies with at the end so they are extra gooey, as they absorb the glaze while they are baking. These are just out of the oven and I've already had two... hope there are some left for the boyfriend later on! : )

I have made these sticky buns twice, and both times they have been delicious! The second time I made these, I prepared them a week ahead and froze them before the second rising. I left the buns out overnight (about 9 hours) and then baked them. They seemed to brown too quickly on 375, so for the second batch I baked them at 350 for about 30 minutes. If I make these ahead of time again, I might reduce the amount of glaze that goes in the pan and add more later because lots of the glaze was absorbed into the dough.. but they were still tasty!

These Sticky Buns were like the ones I used to eat when I was young. Finally I found this fabulous recipe. Not only was it delicious but it was very forgiving of being proofed several extra times due to refrigeration and forgetting to add the chopped pecans into the roll. I followed the reviewers' suggestions and substituted maple syrup for corn syrup and went a bit light on the honey. Also I added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans to be spread on top of the butter and cinnamon and sugar. I made the first batch with parchment paper in my popover pan since that was how the ones had been made so many years ago. They were delicious even though they were burned (30 minutes at 375º per the recipe). Otherwise they were identical with my memory including the hardened outer crust (which I had never cared for). I used a 2" deep casserole dish for my 2nd batch without any parchment paper. After I proofed the rolls, I realized I had omitted the chopped pecans so I unrolled each bun, added the pecans, rerolled them and proofed them again. This time I cooked the buns for 23 minutes and they were perfect. There was no need for parchment as long as they were removed from the pan while still hot. Once I moved a few buns to make some room, I turned the rest upside down in the baking pan to spread the glaze all over the rolls, which softened the outer crust. Then I moved them to the serving plate and spooned all the remaining glaze from the bottom of the pan onto the buns, and pushed the pecan halves onto the tops. Definitely 4 stars, will make for other special occasions.

We thought these were amazing. We really had to control ourselves. I did make extra glaze, so decadent, and added orange-flavored cranberries in the filling to the second pan. Inspiration for the holidays.I froze the second pan, no problem. I am considering making and freezing individual portions.

I am single and, not wanting to have to consume 15 rolls at one time, I wanted to see if I could freeze the dough after the first rising was completed, and then bake them one at a time when I was in the mood for having one. So, after the first rising, I rolled out the dough, spread on the glaze, rolled the dough back and cut each roll into 12, 2 inch rolls. I then placed each roll in a muffin tin and placed it in the freezer. When I want a freshly baked sticky bun now, the night before I take one of the rolls out of the muffin tin and place it in a small glass Pyrex dish with a little glaze in the bottom. Then turn on the oven to 375 and bake the roll for approximately 20 minutes. It works great! I can consume them at my leisure and not have to worry about how to eat them all at once!

Oh. My. Goodness. These are delicious and easy. I made these for an Easter brunch and they got rave reviews. I used the rapid-rise yeast (1 Tbs. + 2 tsp) and stuck to the rest of the dough recipe. Mine never doubled despite a 3 hr. wait and a perfect environment (sliiiightly warm the oven then turn off). Like others (thanks, reviewers) I used less honey (maybe 1/8 C.), sprinkled chopped pecans into the rolls before rolling 'em up, did 2 Tbs. of cinnamon (that's 6 tsp.) and 3 Tbs. of sugar (white, but was tempted to use brown?) and used a half-stick of butter on each rectangle (increasing the butter by 1/4 C.). I kept the glaze amounts the same (excluding the honey, just used more corn syrup) and it was plenty. I used two glass 9x13 pans and they baked, convection, at 350 for 23 min. I didn't turn them out of the pan (already too many dishes to wash on Easter!) and after they cooled they WERE hard to get out. I made them the night before, stuck the pans in the 'fridge and pulled them out 3 hrs. before baking (they transport beautifully unbaked, btw). My yeast may have been a bit "mature," but they never got hugely puffy. It didn't matter; they were fabulous!

Someone asked for a good place to raise their sticky bun dough. Heat up a cup of water in the microwave and leave it in there. Then place the buns in there to proof (with the door shut). It makes a perfect proofing environment.

Rating: 4
I did one batch with raisins, and the other with pecans, Also scattered raisins in with the cinnamon sugar. I did have some of the glaze bubble out of the pans, but that was likely due to the height being less than two inches. I'll either go 8x13 next time, or place a tray with water below the rack.

These are the Zion Lodge Coffee Bar Sticky Buns. Follow recipe exactly -- except divide the glaze between 24 well-buttered muffin cups. Place 1 inch slices of the filled dough in each cup. Cover and refrigerate over night. Remove from cooler in the morning, let warm up and finish rising. (about 45 minutes). Bake at 350 for about 12 minutes in a convection oven, 15 minutes normal oven. Invert immediately on removal from the oven on a sheet pan. Serve warm. From the horse's (baker's!) mouth! Best Sticky Buns un the world!

substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup and they were great! and I substituted buttermilk powder and that worked too!

Great recipe and well worth the effort. I followed it to the T but due to a silly mistake added too much water so had to add a lot more flour. This didn't affect the recipe, fortunately -- the dough rose beautifully and rolled out beautifully. The buns had great texture and were oooh so yummy. A keeper!

Rating: 4
These were time consuming due to the waiting time for rising, but otherwise very easy to make and well worth it. The only problem I had was with the sticky topping sticking to the pan when I inverted it. I recommend greasing your pan extra-well and inverting the buns immediately after they come out of the oven, letting the pan sit inverted on the buns for 3-5 mins before lifting it off completely.

Yes, they're a lot of work if you are trying to do them in a short period of time, but here's a tip . . . you can actually FREEZE them before the second rising and bake them days later (at least you can using instant yeast -- see my previous review below). I put the sliced buns over the toffee/pecan layer in parchment-lined pans (12 buns for each 9X13 pan), froze them uncovered until solid, then transferred them (still in the paper) into 9X13 lidded plastic containers (you could also wrap them in foil). Take them out the night before you want to serve them, put them back in a baking pan, with the parchment paper of course, cover loosely with plastic wrap and bring to room temperature overnight. Let them rise in a warm spot in the morning if necessary, then bake as usual. NOTE: They will not rise as much in the pan this way, but don't despair -- they will puff up like crazy when you bake them, and you can't tell the difference. Good luck!

Rating: 4
Very, very good, but I thought they were a lot of work (maybe it's because I was assembling them after 1 am Xmas morning, and had to get up early Xmas morning to let them rise before cooking). I'd appreciate suggestions on where to put them while rising. I usually heat water on a stove, and put a rack over it, but don't know if they actually start cooking using this approach (mine only neeeded to cook in the oven about 17 minutes). Next time I will try some of the other reviewers suggestions regarding using more cinnamon-sugar and different pans. Even though I increased the number of pecans, I will further increase them the next time. Too bad they're so sinful to eat.

A HUGE hit. I tried this recipe to the letter and all went well. Then it dawned on me that the dough was almost identical to my challah recipe, which takes much less time. So next time, I substituted quick-rise yeast for the regular yeast (same amount -- doesn't work well with less than 4 tsp), mixed it in with all the sugar, the water (a little hotter than recipe calls for -- 120F) and a cup of the flour, let it sit for a couple of minutes, then beat in the other ingredients and the rest of the flour. Did it all with my KitchenAid mixer, paddle and then dough hook. Cuts first rising time in half, with no effect on taste or texture. 12 buns are perfect in 9X13 oblong pans -- I lined them with parchment paper to make cleanup easier. Perhaps it's my pans but I found they were done after 20 minutes at 350. I think these will become my new trademark -- thanks!!

My husband and I both love theseand they are about half as much work as my familys recipe. We make them pull-apart by dipping the dough balls in the glaze and layering them in a bundt pan, sprinkled with nuts. We substitute soymilk for powdered milk, apple sauce for half the butter in the dough recipe and adjust the water accordingly. These are bomb-proof!

Made them for my husband for a Father's Day breakfast and they were a big hit! Followed some reviewers suggestions - used a 9 x 13 pan with 16 buns. Added a 1/4" maple syrup to glaze and slathered butter onto dough and used a very healthy dose of cinnamon and sugar and threw in some pecans before rolling the buns. Also I toasted all the pecans before using them. Baked for 23 minutes the night before, heated them for the morning for about 8 minutes and they were absolutely delicious. This is going to be a Father's Day tradition.

I had never made homemade sticky buns, and this recipe is incredible!!! I found that the recipe took much more flour than what is noted to get the dough to the proper consistency, but having made them twice already I definitely have the proper "feel" for the dough. I added lots of raisins to the top along with the nuts. A keeper!

These sticky buns ROCKED! They were so delicious and made a generous amount. I did alter the recipe as follows: I used 1/4 cup of water for the yeast but substituted 3/4 cup of warm whole milk for the additional water called for in the recipe. For the filling, I used 1 stick of butter (instead of 1/2 stick)and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, along with 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1 tsp. cinnamon for the filling. I also only needed to bake the buns for 21 minutes. Great recipe.

Absolutely positively delicious. I halved the dough recipe but not the filling or glaze. My guests loved them!

Excellent and easy to make! This will definitely be a staple for us when entertaining. I will use a bigger pan the next time I make them though. Once the buns had risen, they pushed the glaze half way up the pan. When I baked them the glaze bubbled up over the sides and onto the bottom of the oven. Then it burned and smoke filled the house! Luckily the buns were delicious, so it was all worth it.

Oh my goodness, so good. I have never made cinnamon buns before, but this recipe was so good and easy. I took some of the previous reviewers suggestions and doubled the filling. I ended up with two 9x13 pans of buns, so I had to double the glaze, but it wasn't a big deal. My husband and neighbours loved these.

Wonderful!! These make a nice soft slightly sweet dough and a sweet, sticky, nutty, topping. Fantastic. Will again. (I found that I needed to cover them with foil part way through the baking process to prevent over-browning while allowing for doneness inside. I didn't have powdered milk, so substituted some vanilla soy smoothie powder. Turned out great.)

Just wanted to updated that I froze the second pan of buns. I left them out on the counter overnight, then warmed them in the oven for about 10-15 minutes at 350. The buns were practically as good as the first time around.

I've been trying a lot of cinnamon/sticky bun recipes from Epicurious and this is, by far, the best. They looked SO impressive in the pan. My husband loved the glaze - it's more of a honey flavor. I am next contemplating making the buns without the glaze, then icing them with a traditional white icing. Only problem is that it makes so much! Two pans full of buns. Has anyone frozen them successfully?

This recipe is great! I made a few adjustments because I just can't follow anything to the letter. I used warm milk instead of the warm water and deleted the milk powder. Added raisins when rolling and saved the nuts (pecans) for the top. Also adjusted dough metheod so I could use my big Kitchen Aid mixer. Everyone agrees these are the best sticky buns they have ever had and they are all professional Chefs! (me too) This one is a keeper!

Great sticky buns. We did not have the round pans, so used glass rectangular pans instead. We doubled the recipe. Also, we are at about 6000 ft elevation. All that being said, we removed the buns at 30 minutes, and they had burned on the bottom. Incidentally, the one pan that was ceramic did alright, though we took it out earlier. I don't know if it was the pans or just too long a bake, but next time we will try ceramic pans instead and watch more carefully. Also, I found the buns (perhaps because of the overcooking) to be too dry in the middle. I think we will increase the butter/corn syrup mixture and spread it on the dough before rolling next time. This is definitely a recipe we will try again--especially when we have overnight guests coming. We just need to make some adjustments.

Decent sticky buns. The only problem was the nuts steamed underneath the buns and lost their nutty crispness. The best sticky buns have a glaze with nuts in added on top after the sticky buns have come out of oven.

These were good, not spectacular. I used dark brown sugar for the glaze. I had to bake them an extra 10-15 minutes as the centers were still doughy.

Nothing against Betty Crocker, but I've been using the sweet rolls recipe from the BC cookbook for a couple of years now and it was very good but the Ultimate Sticky Buns recipe is over the top. Used a little more butter and Karo Syrup than the recipe called for in the glaze but it was gooey and wonderful!! I also used light brown sugar instead of regular sugar in the rolls and that seemed to work out well also. The same cast of characters that eats my Betty Crocker buns said these were much better. This will be my default Sticky Bun recipe from now on!

If you prefer your pecans toasted, do it beforehand because it won't happen in the glaze. I didn't find that the additional nuts rolled in with the cinn/sugar tasted much because they were so moist having been steamed in there.

I was looking for a great recipe for pecan sticky buns that my husband would love. I picked a winner, both my husband and daughter loved these sticky buns. I brought some in for work and they wanted the recipe, they loved them as well. I have a convection oven so they cooked in 20 minutes. I too added more cin/butter/karo syrup. I wanted plenty of gooo....fabulous!

These were incredible. Like others I used more cinnamon sugar (6 teaspoons of each) and added finely chopped pecans inside the buns. I found the honey a little overpowering, so I added more brown sugar and butter to drown out the honey taste a little. Perhaps it was the particular brand I used. I had to let them rise a lot longer than the recipe stated and the dough never did double, but they turned out in the end. I just had to be patient. One more thing. I hadn't made cinnamon buns since 20 years ago in Home Ec class, but they taught us to slice the roll by wrapping either thread or dental floss around the roll and pulling. Brilliant Mrs. Grover. Works like a charm

These buns were great!! I followed the changes suggested (more cinnamon, sugar, and butter) and made the recipe with both nuts and rum-soaked raisins. They tasted fabulous!! The only 'problem' I had with the recipe is that the buns themselves seems a little too cake-y for my tastes, I would have liked them to be lighter. But this could also be due to the fact that the yeast I used was somewhat old. But regardless, these were a wonderful dessert, and tasted even better the day after they were baked!

If I could give it 5 forks I would. Words can't describe how delicious -- and actually quite easy -- this recipe is. I incorporated prior suggestions: added about 50% more of cinnamon/sugar/butter mixture for the spread. Roughly chopped about 3/4 cup of pecans and sprinkled them onto the rectangles before rolling. Did the whole thing the night before, baked in the morning (I would allow about 2 hours for the rising, though, coming from the fridge). I also used heavy, dark cake pans and baked at 350 for about 24 minutes. After turning out onto plates, I let it sit for close to an hour to let the topping seep in. Presentation was beautiful...taste beyond words.

I am going to sound like a broken record (after reading all of the other reviews) but this recipe is amazing! I followed the advice of other cooks and added some pecans on top of the cinnamon/sugar mixture before rolling. I did not find that the buns were at all dry, so the amount of butter and other ingredients worked well for me. I did use two dark, non-stick cake pans, so I reduced the baking temp to 350 and reduced the time by 5 to 7 minutes. This is a keeper for brunches!!!

Rating: 4
Unbelievable!!! I read the prior reviews of this recipe before I began and followed several of the suggestions. I decided to use cake flour instead of all purpose flour. The texture was smooth and yummy. As suggested, I doubled the butter for the glaze and added 2 extra T of cinnamon. After rolling out the dough, I dotted 1/4 cup of butter on top and added a pecan next to each. Then I rolled them up and sliced. After turning the buns onto the plate, I let them soak for an hour. This is a new Christmas tradition at our house!

Ohmygosh - these are wondeful!! I also made these the night before and popped them into the oven the next morning. If they cool too much before you serve them, heat them briefly to melt the caramel topping, which hardens rather quickly. I'm making these again for Christmas morning.

These gooey sticky buns will make your day and dissapear quickly. I recommend preparing the dough the night before and then pop them in the oven the next morning. The recipe works well in a standmixer. I found they tasted better after a few hours since the sticky topping really seeps into the buns. Sitting only 30 minutes the sticky mixture was only on top. Next time I might try some brown sugar with the cinnamon when I'm rolling them up, to make the centers a little more gooey.

Rating: 3
These were great--just the gooey caramel buns I had been looking for. I am not a fan of pecans, so I made half with and half without. Well, I wish I had put pecans in both halves because they got candied and were absolutely delicious. Next time, I would also add a bit more cinnamon. These are great--dieters beware.

These sticky buns were absolutely delicious! I also made them with raisins, and they turned out equally delicious. One variation that I thought improved the buns was to sprinkle either the raisins or pecans over the dough before rolling so that each sticky bun would have them between each twirl of dough. Definitely a winner!

This is truly the "Ultimate" in sticky bun recipes. I made them for a brunch and they disappeared like magic. I followed the recipe without substitutions except that I used maple syrup in place of the dark syrup called for in the recipe. I also made one pan with raisins and one with the pecans. These are wonderful and I had to give the recipe out to practically every cook at the party. A sure winner!
