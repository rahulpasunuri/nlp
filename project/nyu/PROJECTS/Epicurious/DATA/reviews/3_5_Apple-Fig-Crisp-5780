I made this using Metaxa for the brandy and topping with some greek yogurt sweetened with honey. It was a big hit to all that tasted it and will definitely go in the regular dessert rotation. Simple to make and delicious

I was won in an auction and made this for a professor at school. It came out so wonderfully delicious!! I was worth my fee :)

The dish is overpoweringly sweet. The combination of the figs and apple brandy were too much. Perhaps with less figs and something more tart in the mix, it would be better.

This recipe was very simple, yet much more elegant than elpected. I doubled the recipe and made it in a large glass lasagna type pan, for a New Year's open house. It was a smashing success and I was hounded for the recipe. My family has been begging me to make it again.

This was easy to make and stayed crispy when cold. I used fresh figs from my garden that I had partially dried in the sun and then soaked in brandy. I found that the filling was completely cooked after 40 minutes and did not need any more baking. My guests all raved about it.
