This is delicious! Very fresh tasting. Did not have as much parsley or tarragon as called for, but still wonderful.

Sorry to disappoint,but this recipe is VERY wrong. I'm a former chef from Nice and I can tell you, potatoes,green beans and other cooked veg in a salade nicoise is a common mistake that even many restaurant in france do. The only cooked ingredient allowed in a Nicoise is the egg and for the fish,it's either anchovies OR tuna,never both together (the real,original recipe is with anchovies though). It's amazing that many french people do this mistake because it's a very known fact that potatoes only grows in north of France,not in my area

This recipe is incredible! I have made it several times and make a few small adjustments to make it healthier. For the dressing, I use 2/3 cup vinegar (balsamic and cider vinegar) to 1/3 cup oil. I also add a pinch of sugar to the dressing. I also serve it all on one platter over mixed salad greens. It works equally well with grilled, pan seared and oven baked fish, so no worries if your grill isn't available!

This recipe is fantastically easy and works well with any type of fish. No need to use an outdoor grill - a grill pan on the stove top worked fine. I added asparagus because I had it in the house and was delicious!

I made this recipe with some minor changes and it was wonderful. I added champagne vinegar, whole grain mustard and lemon flavored olive oil to my recipe.

The recipe calls for placing rosemary sprigs over the hot coals, but I see no mention of rosemary in the list of ingredients. I used one bunch of rosemary; it flavored the tuna very nicely.

Wonderful dressing. No need to stick with tuna. Salmon or another in-season protein would be great.

Very nice on a warm evening with a bottle of rose. My alterations- less parsley and tarragon, no chervil, and shallots instead of white onion in the dressing. And for the salad- good quality canned tuna, sauteed the crushed olives with halved grape tomatoes, no anchovies, no yellow beans. I imagine that this would be even better with fresh, grilled tuna, but it really wasn't bad with the solid packed canned.

A summer-time favourite in our house. Have only once made with fresh tuna--usually use high-quality olive-oil packed tuna. Often make with only tarragon & parsley (no chervil).

The entire combination makes for such a lovely presentation and incredibly delicious! I also used shallots as a substitute for a more refined flavor. I added some chilled leftover garlic asparagus I had and it really took off!

This was a good nicoise salad. I used less parsley in the vinaigrette and added some basil because it was what i had. also, i sauteed the green beans with olive oil and tarragon after a quick blanch. Really good. I didn't have sherry vinegar so i had to use balsamic, but it worked fine.

I rated this dish as exceptional and here's why: I bought really high grade canned tuna and did no such fussing with the grilling of tuna. After all, it's February in the northeast (USA) and one would have to be insane to grill outdoors now. Also, I boiled the potatoes. Furthermore and perhaps most importantly, I eyeballed all the ingredients for a delicious dressing. I think the recipe calls for too much parsley. Have fun with this dish and take chances - that's the way to go on this one. It took me no time at all.

Delicious. My boyfriend said it was the best salad he ever had. But wow, is this time- consuming. Not difficult, just an interminable amount of prep. Perfect if you have a live-in staff of prep cooks, or find yourself under house arrest, but otherwise, be warned. (And I even used canned tuna!)

really enjoyed it might change the vinaigrette . I used shallots instead of white onion. I think I will not use so much parsley next time.

I must admit that I have been making this salade for years and have yet to rate it. IT IS REALLY GOOD!! I substitute shallots for the onions ( I think that the subtle difference is much nicer with the fish ). I also use Boston or Butter lettuce for the lettuce, and double the dressing recipie because we use it on salades for the next few days after we have this dish. The prep for the salade is most of the work involved but the effort is worth it! Yummy!

I was so proud to present this to my hostess who asked us to bring "heavy appetizers" in lieu of dinner before a show. I was lucky enough to get to the North Market here, and had the most gorgeous fresh veggies on this platter. I marinated the beans and potatos for several hours, and added about 3 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to the dressing. I used Italian tuna in olive oil, piling the veggies around the platter lined with greens, and chunking the tuna in the middle. I served with reserved dressing, of which there was plenty. Perfect and elegant summer dish!

I've made several Salade Nicoise recipes, and this is my favorite. I made this as a "welcome home" dinner for my husband, and he declared it his favorite version. The dressing was very good. I could not obtain fresh chervil, but it was great with only tarragon. We used the leftover dressing on a simple salad.

I loved the recipe but my husband was just so-so with it. The reason is he is not a tarragon fan but I thought I would try. Next time I would do a mustard vinegarette but would definetly add the sliced white onions. I would make the veggies and the salad dressing the day before.

I was very pleased with how this salad turned out, but I was amazed at the raves about the dressing! Everyone wanted the recipe, so I guess it is the real secret. I made it with dried tarragon, no chervil, and only 1/2 onion, then put in blender (saved chopping by hand). It was wonderful. For the rest of the salad, I too used canned white tuna. Filled an enormous serving platter with mixed spring greens and spinach, then layered beans around the edge and lined with alternating grape tomatoes and olives. Overlapping the beans I put the bell peppers, then drizzled all with dressing. At the overlap of the peppers and beans I did a circle of potatos and eggs. Then in the center the tuna, with small drops of dressing on top as garnish.

This dressing is incredible even without the chervil, especially with the potatoes. Don't even bother with another nicoise recipe this has to be the best. I added baby greens as a base and plated each salad separately placing the beans in the center, tuna and then olives on top. I put the egg wedges, tomatoes and bell peppers around the edge. The presentation is colorful and very impressive.

Delicious, though a bit time-consuming. To make it easier, I just used canned tuna, but it was still great!

This has turned out to be one of our favorite party dishes as I can make all the veges ahead and fridge and grill the tuna either in the am for a lunch or during cocktails for dinner. Beautiful presentation esp. if you use tiny whole potatoes. Excellent!

Fantastic! I used canned filets of tuna and substituted rice instead of potatoes. The Nicoise salades I have had in Paris lately do the same. I also cut back on the olive oil. A perfect dish for summer.

We use this particular recipe always for our salade nicoise dish. It is spectacular! Very tasty and colorful. Great for large groups. The secret is in the produce.

I just served this for a birthday "ladies" lunch and it was a hit. Very lovely on the plate and completely delicious. It is quite time consuming to prepare, and top quality tuna runs about $23 a pound here, so consider it for a special occasion. I made the dressing, cooked potatoes and beans, and sliced the peppers last night. Dressed the potatoes warm (a Julia Child must!) but left everything else undressed and wrapped in damp paper towels. It all held up beautifully. I grilled the tuna (stovetop grill pan) and left it medium rare. Tossed everything together, plated and added slices of tuna and anchovies to the top and placed egg quarters around the plate. Very pretty presentation and worth the effort.

Absolutely delicious. First rate!

This is my favorite recipe to make during the week and enjoy on the back deck in the evening after work. I use albacore that we catch ourselves and tarragon and cherry tomatos out of the garden. It is easy enough to prepare much of the ingredients ahead of time.

I used canned Tolong tuna instead of fresh and it was still very good. My 2 1/2 year old son couldn't get enough of this! I recommend cutting down on the amount of olive oil by about 1/4c and to be a little more liberal with the garlic.

I love nicoise salad. I didn't love this. I didn't even like it. The dressing was all wrong. Based on the other reviews, it must have been me. I wouldn't dare try again, though, for fear of wasting expensive ingredients again.

I loved this recipe. It's less complicated to prepare than it looks (just used a stovetop grill for the tuna), and the colors and flavors are great. Halved it for a dinner for 2 (with leftovers of course), but I will make it again for guests this summer.

This is the best salade nicoise recipe I've found. Perfect for a summer dinner with a glass of white wine. My husband requests this again and again.

delicious, however, this recipe is definitely complicated. i'm new to cooking so it was a bit difficult for me. also i left out the bell peppers and couldn't find the chevril. it came out more like a stew than a salad, everything kind of mushed together glued by the potatos, but it still tasted fantastic.

I always make this when it gets hot. It's always refreshing and light. I wonder if the cook from Pittsburgh is referring to the Nicoise at Cafe De La Presse? It's the best!

This was the best Salade Nicoise we've ever had. The flavors were scrumptous! I crumbled a little feta cheese on top just before serving.

My housemate made this gorgeous & delicious salad. She broiled the tuna in the oven with fresh rosemary sprigs; the next day we used canned albacore, and it was still fine. She arranged the salad on one plate rather than two, and drizzled the intense dressing over all (only the potatoes were tossed first). The potatoes (she used French fingerling) and dressing are great by themselves.

I made this recipe for a Bridal shower yesterday and it was just wonderful! The tuna was easy and delicious. I used homegrown parsley and tarragon in the vinagraite - couldn't find chervil. I quartered the potatoes. Everyone said I should be a caterer.. Maybe in my next life...
