This was great, until I added the asiago! I mistakenly added the asiago (only 6 oz) to the ENTIRE dish, and it was way too overpowering. Hard to believe the recipe calls for an entire cup. I would make this again, but without the asiago!

A bit rich but very good! I used a medium pork sausage (I didn't have Italian) and that worked just fine. I think I enjoyed the left-overs even more!

I give it four stars because it was really good and was exactly what I was expecting. Sweet italian plus smokey shiitake and portabello (I used dried shiitake, made it even smokier) necessarily infers an "adult meal". That said, my three year old loved it. Next time, I might lighten up *slightly* on the mushroom/sausage mixture -- I think proportionally it should be slightly heavier on the rice than on the mushroom/meat side.

Rating: 3
I had to improvise on this recipe based on what I had at home so I used chicken sausage instead of pork - 2 sweet italian and 2 hot italian. I also didn't have madeira so used marsala. Lastly, I added the cheese into the rice rather than on top and it was great! Very creamy and heavy but a nic winter's dinner!

My new favorite risotto dish. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used red wine with the sausage and white wine with the rice. It truly is a great dish that will please everyone.

Have to say I wasn't wowed by this which was disappointing considering all the rave reviews. It had a bit of a sweet taste to it and am wondering if it was the Madeira. At the liquor store there were several kinds so perhaps I chose the wrong one? The other sub I made (to use mushroom stock) can't explain the sweetness. I may give it another shot with another Madeira.

This is excellent! I had a box of arborio in my pantry. I wanted to serve this as a main course so I googled sausage risotto and found this fabulous recipe! I served it to my cousin and husband, both of whom are not rice lovers and they LOVED it! My cousin asked for the recipe and my husband had 3rds. I read the reviews and followed some advice; I used Marsala, cut the butter to 2T and 2T evoo, and I used romano instead of asiago. Delicious! The leftovers looked a little dry so I added some water before I microwaved it and it was perfect again. Serve with mixed greens and crusty bread.

Fabulous just as it was. But, it took us 2.5 hours to make the dish from start to finish. Definately worth the wait.

I was disappointed in this, but will try it again following the recipe more closely. I took the advice of reviewers and used spicy Italian sausage. I'm no heat phobe, but the sausage I happened to buy created an inferno that overwhelmed the other flavors. Next time I will use sweet Italian sausage and perhaps add some chili flakes myself so that I can control the spice factor.

My husband said this was the best meal he'd had in a long time. I used ground sausage from our meat CSA. I left out the oregano, and I used Marsala instead of Madeira (I only used 1/2 c. in the sausage mixture and 1/2 c. in adding to the rice, but I think it could have used more). I used assorted dried wild mushrooms from Costco, about 2 oz, steeped them in boiling water for 20 mins, and then used the mushroom stock along with the chicken stock. I used 2 T. evoo and 2T. butter instead of the 1 stick butter. Lots of improvising, but the risotto turned out awesome! Tasted just like the porcini risotto at one of our favorite restaurants in Boston's North End.

good stuff! very hearty...i am using it as a main dish. added the juice of one lemon to cut the heaviness. will use olive oil instead of butter next time and will try adding some vegetables. there is nothing like slow-cooked risotto, it's worth the wait and the effort!!

Rating: 3
I experiemented a little and used white wine that I had on hand (a NZ Savignon Blanc) - also added some Kale to the frying process before throwing in the sausage. I'm not a kale fan usually, but added a nice complement to the meat and mushrooms- both in color and consistency. Risotto is pretty flexible so long as you make it properly, you can add just about any good flavors to the sausage and mushroom mixture at the end.

Rating: 4
This was my first time making a true risotto (cup of water at a time and lots of stirring). It was worth the effort. However, I did make some mods based on previous comments and have some more to add. This was insanely rich even as I made it, so here's what I would do next time I make it. - 1 T olive oil (or none) for frying sausage - 1/2 lb SPICY sausage (this dish needs some heat to cut the richness) - add 2t crushed hot red peppers - I used sage and parsley because that's what I had and those were good alternatives to thyme and oregano - I used 1c dry white wine instead of Madeira and it was tasty - 1-2T butter (a 1/2 cup would be insane!) - 1 medium sweet onion (1 large was too much) - 1/4 c Asiago cheese added to the pot right at the end, bring cheese to table for people to add. I also think this could use some acid. Next time I think I'll try adding the zest of two lemons. That would go nicely with the sausage and I think it might help cut the richness overall.

Very delicious, really 3.5 stars. I made it with a pound of shiitakes and some criminis tossed. I used triple the garlic and fresh herbs, and more cheese than called for, mixed right in instead of passed. Very unctuous. Took other reviewers advice and cut down on the butter and used spicy sausage. All in all a very tasty risotto recipe that even my 5 year old liked. Would have been even better with asparagus added in. I'll do that next time, along with trying a different sausage -- there are so many unusual ones to choose from these days. Definitely try this recipe.

This risotto is fabulous! I followed other reviewers' suggestions, and subbed in hot sausage for the sweet and used half-butter and half-olive oil to cook the rice in. I also ended up using another cup of chicken broth, because I like my risotto to be a bit more done. Amazing recipe, and it got rave reviews at my dinner party, where I served it as the entree, accompanied by a green salad and rustic olive bread. Yum!

This is a great dinner party dish - everyone loves the word Risotto and it's hearty enough to satisfy the hungriest at the table. It's less daunting then all the stirring implies; just stir in between chopping/preparing the rest of your dinner. I let it rest in the oven during cocktail hour and it served up perfect. I used mushroom stock and every mushroom I could afford at Whole Foods and next would simply skip the sausage, it's a little redundant. This risotto was a great complement to my venison, making the dinner reminiscent of English countryside.

Very tasty. I made the recipe exactly as in the recipe. I used italian chicken sausage. Other reviewrs said it was easy and I am not sure I would agree. It is very time consuming and has a lot of steps. If you don't pay careful attention to the stirring the rice will burn on the bottom. From start to finish it took me 2 hours. I would make it again but would plan my time differently. JR

Rating: 4
This was definitely quite good considering the small amount of effort that it required. Additionally I took it to a party where about 8 or 9 people ate it and they all took seconds and commented on how good it was. I didn't really change anything, although I was pretty generous with the thyme and the oregano and in the future I'd probably use even more. Probably closer to a tablesoon and a half each, rather than a teaspoon. All in all this recipe was pretty tasty and I'd definitely make it again next time I need a risotto.

Rating: 4
Absolutely terrific! I asked at the liquor store about substituting something for the Madeira, as it was expensive. He said nothing would substitute and that I would be glad I bought it - he was right! The flavour came through with a wonderful richness and deep wine colour. I will never use anything else. I added fresh prawns at the very end before serving. The recipe halves well too. A winner!

I made this exactly as directed and it came out awesome! I only used one portabella, next time I will use three! I used Marsala and Romano, I think it tasted fine. I'd like to try it with Madeira, I'd also like to get my sausage crispy before I set it aside (just personal taste). Hopefully, the leftovers taste just as good.

Great! I halved the butter and the sausage and substituted in Marsala and Romano Cheese - it was still very rich. It's too heavy to be a side dish.

This dish was great but I only gave it 3 forks as it isn't a really elegant dish but is worth the effort (not complicated just needs a time on the stove, about 1 1/2 hrs.) I used white wine instead, a lot more broth because of the extended cooking time, hot italian sausage and added parsley at the end. I served it with pork chops as part of the main meal and is definitely a keeper.

I made this dish a couple months ago, using all the Marsala in this recipe called for made it a little funky tasting. This time I only added the half cup at the point of cooking the sausage and mushroom mixture - that brought it up a half a fork to 3 and a half.

This was sooooooo good! I followed the recipe exactly, and will continue to do so when we make it again! I can't think of anything that would improve this. Even my two-year old ate this and said, "Delicious Mama!" (although if you have a picky eater, you might not have the same experience). It does take a bit of time, but since I have two boys under two at home, I did it in stages: I chopped everything while they were napping, and cooked the sausage/onion mixture ahead of time. I started the risotto about 10 minutes before dad got home, and dinner was on the table ASAP. We're contemplating who we can wow with this dish!

Incredibly delicious! Changes: half sweet sausage and half hot sausage and 3/4 stick butter. I can't imagine making any other changes especially the Madeira, use the good stuff! Sure, lots of stirring but well worth the effort.

Rating: 4
This was well worth the labor. First time I followed the recipe exactly, but second time I made my own variations. I used extra virgin olive oil throughout the cooking process. I first fried the Hot Spicy Italian Sausage in olive oil until it was really brown and crispy. Then I added the fresh herbs and mushrooms and one chopped bell pepper and only a half cup of Madeira and sauteed until mushrooms and pepper were cooked and shrunken and set the mixture aside. After sauteeing the onions until translucent, I added the rice and cooked them together until the rice almost began to change color. Then I added one cup of dry Vermouth and stirred them together until the wine was absorbed. Then I added 4 cups chicken stock and brought the pot to a boil then quickly covered the pot with a lid and set the pot on another burner over very low heat and let the rice steam for 25 minutes. Then I opened the pot and stirred the rice to check for flavor and creaminess. If not creamy enough, I add a half cup of stock or Vermouth and stir over low heat. Then I season with cracked pepper and then add the setaside sausage mixture and stir, adding ground Parmesan cheese to taste and one or two tablespoons of butter. My family and friends find this wildly delicious and always demand more.

I made this for dinner when one other couple joined me and my husband. The work of making the dish was not so bad, because everyone hung out in the kitched with me. I used a full pound of hot Italian sausage, and I thought that was the right amount, and the spicyness of the sausage added nicely to the taste. I also used parmesan cheese, because that's what I had on hand. This was our main course, and it was plenty, in fact there were a lot of leftovers (I was glad).

Delicious and rich!! Perfect as a main course on a cold night. Even my four year old gobbled it up.

Wow, this was my first time making a risotto and now I'm hooked! It's really fun to make and there is no reason to be intimidated like I was. I gave this two forks because, after everything that went into it, I expected some more "pow" when it was done. For one thing, i would use a sharper cheese than Asiago. I used high quality, hot Italian sausage and that was good, too. I hate to say it, but all I had was sushi rice, so that was what I used, and it worked just fine. Can't wait to try the other recipes on here.

I think I wrecked this dish by using cheap wine. The Madeira was $4.99 at the grocery store and it made the dish cloyingly sweet. I also used the full amount of butter, making the rice silky smooth. Porbably could reduce by at least half and still turn out great.

Made this last night for company and it was a huge hit. My sister's comment was she never needs to learn to make risotto, she'll just come over to my house instead. Only change to the recipe was I eliminated the garlic cause they are not fans of it and you definitely did not miss it. (and I'm a huge garlic fan) Can't imagine serving this as anything other than an entree. Would be tooo much as an appetizer. I'll be finding an excuse to make it again soon.

This was a big hit with my guests. I used half the butter as other reviewers suggested...no problem. Yes, this dish takes a little time, but stirring is not too hard!! If you aren't a big mushroom fan, don't worry--the flavor of the sausage is far more pronounced. Would definately choose as a main course, since the sausage makes it heary enough. Make sure any sides served with this dish are light! I will probably stir in a little mor asiago just before serving, rather than just passing it separately. Yum!

Was really very good. Tried it out on a friend who loved it. I made a few substitutions though based on what we had on hand - regular garden variety mushrooms instead of gourmet ones, cut down butter by half, and used artichoke and garlic sausages. Also, used a Cabernet since no time to buy Madeira, which tasted wonderful but only downside was it turned the risotto a pale lilac color which browned slightly once the sausage mix was tossed in. Super yummy. Will have to try making it the "right" way too.

Caution: Must keep stirring the rice constantly, if this is not done, the resulting rice will not be as creamy.

This was a great risotto recipe! Very rich and satisfying.I made only one slight concession, and that was to leave out all that butter! I have always left out the butter in risotto recipes and replaced with a good dollop of quality olive oil (your heart will thank you). It does NOT affect the creamy result you get with butter at all. Also one suggestion; do not substitute another type of medium grain rice for arborio here - you will then not get the same consistency and translucent texture.

I read all of the reviews and had to make this one! There is no question about it, this is the best risotto recipe I have ever made. Very rich dish which we love. My husband, who loves risotto, loved it. He said it is better than some of the top restaurants in Atlanta which says alot. I followed this recipe with only a few tweaks. I used a 1.2 pounds of saugage and reduced the shitake mushrooms from 10 ounces to 7 ounces which made the recipe a little richer. I left everything the same and did not reduce the butter. This recipe is so rich and full of calaries anyways, we choose to just go for it verses cutting down any of the butter. Excellent risotto!

I made this recipe with an equal amount of chicken leg meat instead of the sausage. Because of the lack of fat from the sausage, the butter quantity is just right. The flavour and colour from the madeira wine really makes this risotto special.

Excellent recipe! The sweetness of the madeira works really well with the asiago cheese. Rave reviews from all guests. I'm glad I followed other reviewers' advice, I cut the butter to half and used a little olive oil to saute the onions, garlic and rice. Risotto is a little bit labour intensive as a dish though.

Really, really good. It's extremely rich and flavorful. I would not change a thing.

I should have used 1/2 the butter because I'm sure it would still have been as delicious. I used reconstituted crimini mushroom from Italy (Mmmmmm) and white wine instead of Madeira (didn't have it on hand). Everyone raved over it. I can't wait to make it again.

Excellent! I made this recipe for relatives and one person wasn't a big fan of mushrooms but loved the dish. I only used 1 tbsp of olive oil and half the butter and substituded the Madeira with Sherry. I will definately make this again.

GREAT recipe. I agree with a previous reviewer that you can cut the butter in half without forfeiting taste. also, i used port instead of madeira, and it worked fine, but i would recommend using less than is called for. the recipe can stand more garlic, if you are a garlic fan.

My husband grabbed this issue (Sept.'01) before I even saw it and decided to make this for dinner one evening last September. I don't remember what we had with it, but I do remember that this was an outstanding dish! I went online today just to find this recipe because I was thinking about how tasty it was and couldn't remember from which issue it had come. This is a wonderfully flavorful risotto and I can't wait to savor it again. Preparing risotto is somewhat labor intensive in that you have to keep stirring and adding liquid but the outcome is definitely worth the effort.

This recipe is a winner. I'll make it many times, not only for the family but for dinner guests. Its flavors, texture and overall delicious ingredients is going to make this an all-time favorite for me. The only change I made was to substitute Marsala wine for the Madeira because I didn't have any Madeira. The whole dish was fabulous.

Let me first say that I am NOT a mushroom or a sausage fan and I loved this!!! My husband first had something like this in Napa and has been bugging me to find a like-recipe ever since. Well I finally found this and grumbled about buying Madeira wine and we went to three stores to get the sweet italian sausage and all during the prepartion I was hesitant - but oh my gosh!! Was this ever good. It was creamy, hearty, full of flavor and delicious. I followed the recipe to the tee except I used dried Thyme and Oregano and it came out fine. Hubby is already asking when I'll make it again.

I made this recipe when it first appeared in the magazine version. It was a complete hit. I did NOT use canned stock -- it just is not as rich. I had grilled a whole duck and, of course, made a duck broth -- which made the risotto extraordinarily rich and delicious. The madeira also adds tremendously to the flavor. I added a TINY amount of basil to the herb mixture and used shallots for some of the onion. This is definitely a repeat dish.

This was my first time making risotto and I think it came out really good. I made a couple of substitutions - I used marsala wine instead of madeira, parmagiano cheese instead of asiago and I left out the sausage. Its rather difficult to make when you are entertaining because you have to stand by the stove and keep stirring in the broth. But overall, I would make this again, it was delicious!

This dish is a huge hit with my finicky husband. Very rich, but you can easily cut the butter by half and drain the sausage on paper towels to keep it from getting too greasy. Top with a sprinkle of pinenuts.

I tried this recipe and loved the flavor. This recipe is a working recipe (meaning you can't leave the risotto alone for 1 minute). I will make it again, because it is a dish you don't find in restaurants.

This is probably a matter of personal preference, but both my roommate and I found this recipe too rich. We made it as a main course, and maybe a smaller portion would work better as an appetizer or side dish.

I made this to take to a friends house and everyone loved it. I thought the flavors blended so well together. The madeira wine gave such a wonderful flavor. I used a good quality sausage and did drain the grease. It is very rich. Tastes creamy without adding cream. Definately will make this again.

This is the best risotto recipe I've ever had including from a restaurant! The taste is fabulous and rich. The Madeira adds a nice sweetness that you wouldn't get with white wine. I used half the amount of shiitake mushrooms and substituted oyster mushrooms for the remainder. Be sure to thoroughly drain the sausage before adding it to the risotto as it is quite greasy. I served this for a casual dinner party and everyone raved. A definite keeper and well worth the expense. (Could also easily be cut in half.)

Good but not great. I thought the Madeira would give it lots of flavor but it was somewhat bland. I halved the recipe for 2 main course servings and along with a salad it would have fed 4 easily. There's a fair amount of work and expensive ingredients for a so-so result.
