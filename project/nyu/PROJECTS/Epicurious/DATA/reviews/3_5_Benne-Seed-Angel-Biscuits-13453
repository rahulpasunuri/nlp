I was looking for recipes to use-up buttermilk. We ate these biscuits almost immediately after they were baked. They were light and tender but dry and kind-of bland--- and they took more work than my favorite (a Better Homes cookbook) biscuit recipe (without buttermilk.)

These are the best biscuits I have ever made. My family loves them and so do I.
