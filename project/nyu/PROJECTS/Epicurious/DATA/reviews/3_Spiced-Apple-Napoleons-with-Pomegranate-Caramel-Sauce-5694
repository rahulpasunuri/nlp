Kind of funny how this is called a 'light' recipe yet it's over 300 calories from all the sugar in it! A calorie is a calorie whether it comes from fat, protien, or carbs...

This Is a wonderful light dessert that tastes great when served atop a dish of mango and strawberry sauce. Definitly easy to make, but use the sauce sparringly if you are not accustomed to pomegranates. Also i made a little extra pomegranate sauce to try over chocolate ice cream....Excellent!!
