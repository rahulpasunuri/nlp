I have made this recipe a couple of times now over the years with Thanksgiving leftovers. I've found it to be very enjoyable and truly not that much work. One of the key things to remember is to get large onions (softball size) and scoop out most of the insides with a melon baller.

Didn't like this one. If you're looking for a good post-turkey recipe, try The Great After-Thanksgiving Turkey Enchiladasthey're killer! About the onion recipe, my husband said that no one should be subjected to that amount of onions. It was a lot of work for minimal success. In retrospect, I would butter a casserole, layer the stuffing, gravy and turkey, top with mashed potatoes and bake as in original recipe-skip the onions. The creamed onion part was pretty good, but the stuffed ones were not, and I can't justify all that work for okay creamed onions.

Great for leftovers after Thanksgiving. The creamed onions were great, although I felt very guilty about using cream after thanksgiving. I think that step can easily be revised to cream and chicken stock. It's the start of a new holiday tradition!

Prepared this last year for Thanksgiving and it was greated with raised eyebrows by the crowd that expected the traditional baked yams and turkey. Didn't have any left-overs and I have been asked to repeat it this year. Our new tradition for Thanksgiving is a traditional turkey, (with variations of preparations) and then eclectic for the rest of the menu.
