Very disappointing recipe. The texture was okay although I had some issues with the topping sinking into the cheesecake. But I could not taste the triple sec, tequila or lime. Wish I had made it as a trial run before making it for a dinner party; my guests were all very polite and said it was good although I was a bit emabrrassed by it. Definitely will not make again when I have so many other great cheesecake recipes in my collection.

take a close look at this recipe & note that it does not actually list cream cheese among the ingredients. It simply lists "3 8-ounce"; I can fill in the implicit blank. But does epicurious.com not have editors?

This is a wonderful dessert. I add the zest of 1 lime to the batter, and substitute 1 full fat 8oz cream cheese for 1 8oz reduced fat version. In all cheese cakes I make, I use the reduced fat cream cheese, but replace one package with the full fat version. The texture is never affected and I feel better about reducing some of that heart clogging saturated fat! A Great Cheesecake that I have made many times. In comparison the Lime Mousse Cake on this same site, falls short.

Great recipe! i added more tequila, more triple sec and lime zest as well as lime juice. I also used pretzles to make the crust. It helped to salt the glass, so to speak!

this is cheesecake is just awesome. I make it for special occasions and always get complements on it. It takes a while to make, but it is definitely worth it. It's my favorite.

Great recipe if you want a plain cheesecake. No one thought it tasted anything like Margarita. It did taste great though - but more like a plain cheesecake would. I did bake the crust for about 10 minutes at 325 before I filled it.

I made the cheese cake for an office party - the boss is mad about cheesecake. The end result is very rich and the recipe would be sufficent for 16 portions.

I've made this cheesecake twice and have gotten rave reviews. I did start using other cook's tips though - such as baking the crust beforehand, and increasing the lime and sugar in the topping. I agree with many - if your going to eat cheesecake do it with all the fat (full flavored stuff). I plan to make this much more in the summer. My wife and I are going to do a Jimmy Buffet themed dinner, and this will be the perfect dessert!

I've made this cheesecake several times and always had good luck with it. As other reviewers have mentioned, baking the crust first for a few minutes firms it up.

"Bien," but could be "Muy Bien" with some adjustments. First, the crust probably needs to be pre-baked; it's just too greasy and "blah" with only a quick sit in the refrigerator. Next time I'll add 1 tablespoon of sugar to the crust, as well as try another reviewer's suggestion of a bit of cinnamon, and bake the crust @ 325 degrees for approx. 13 minutes, cooling before adding filling. If I'm going to eat cheesecake I'd rather make it worth my while, so full-fat cream cheese and sour cream are the way to go for optimum taste and texture. The reduced fat versions - although admirable - make the cake too loose and add unappealling sourness. Other notes for the filling: reduce sour cream to 1 cup, increase sugar to 1 cup, increase the liquors and lime juice to 3 T. each, and add 1 t. grated lime peel and pinch of salt. It's critical that the middle of the cake be set enough to support the weight of the topping; mine practically sank into cake. For topping, increase sour cream to 1 cup and sugar to 1/4 cup. The flavors of the cake intensify days after baking. I'll make again!

I made this recipe full-fat, the only way I know how of course. The flavors are perfectly balanced, just a mild margarita flavor not overwhelming the cream cheese flavor. Most people will love this cheesecake.

I replaced one of the Neufchatel bricks with regular creamcheese. Doubled the tequila, triple sec, lime juice amounts, and added margerita mix to the filling. I used lime zest in the topping and had to make 2-3 times the topping amount suggested by the recipe to cover the cake. The topping had very nice lime flavor, but the filling still did not. Next time I think I will increase the lime and alcohol even more. I am not a big fan of cheesecake, but my guests loved it and took home the entire cake.

easy, yummy, and cheesy!

I made this as the dessert to a Mexican themed dinner party. I was a hit! The only thing I changed (after reading past reviews) was that instead of using tequila and lime juice, I used Margarita mix that already had the tequila in it. Yummy Margarita flavor. Olay!

This cheesecake is light on the margarita flavors and has a creamy, not dry texture. I used 2 bricks of neufchatel cream cheese, but the rest were the full fat versions. I followed the suggestion of increasing the topping, 1/4 more and I increased the crust by a 1/3 and added cinnamon, which I will be more generous with next time. We served this on top of the Raspberry Coulis in the October 2000 Bon Appetit magazine and together, they were delicious, lick the plate devine.

I made this recipe for a staff party the texture was very nice but the margarita taste wasn't there. I would add more of the tequila and triple sec. It still turned out good, it just tasted like a lime cheesecake.

Made this for father's day...the texture was nice and smooth but I thought the flavors were too light...however the flavors were much more pronounced after letting it sit a couple of days...I have made and had much better cheesecakes so probably won't make this again.

I made this last week for my bunko group and they absolutely loved it - especially since it was lowfat. It came out perfectly and was delicious.

This was a very good cheesecake. Easy to make, good texture. I am looking forward to making it again.

Great flavor. Used an 8 1/2" springform pan, and the cheesecake set up exactly as it should. Served it on a dessert tray at a dinner party for 30- and the guests were fighting over it!

It was a big hit with all my Jimmy Buffet Lovin' friends. I've been asked by several people to make it at each dinner party.

I also found that it was soft in the middle but still very good. I added lime pulp and also through in a handfull of pretzels with the graham crackers while making the crumbs for the crust.

I have made this recipe several times and I have always had great sucess. What made it so successful is that I used regular cream cheese and sour cream. I also add a little flour to the cheese mixture (no more than a tablespoon or two)and use a good brand of tequila.

I added an extra tablespoon of tequila for extra flavor. This made for a real "marguerita flavor"; however, the texture was awful. Very wet and sloppy texture. I made the lowfat version. I might try again as an experiment; I generally bake cheesecakes overnight at 200 degrees, overnight (8+ hours) and they usually come out terrific. That technique might be enough to turn the texture around.

The center never came together; perhaps a tablespoon or two of cornstarach would help. Six of us were celebrating The 4th of July and no one could discern the tequila (Corvo Gold) or the lime

The first time it was OK. Need to add 1 cup of crushed dry roast peanuts to the graham cracker crust, and add more lime juice. I also found the top layer to be quite thin, you may want to double that.
