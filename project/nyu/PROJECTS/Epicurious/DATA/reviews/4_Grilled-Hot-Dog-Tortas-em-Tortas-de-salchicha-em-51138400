These Grilled Hot Dog Tortas are very similar to Sonoran Hot Dogs that are sold in Tucson, AZ. (If you Google Sonoran Hot Dog recipe, you'll find a recipe at another very well respected food site). I make a point of having a Sonoran Hot Dog everytime I'm in Tucson. They are much loved, and appreciated there! I stand with the cook from Scottsdale, Casey1, and others!!

To the people disliking this recipe, if the word 'hot dog' disturbs you, replace it with a fancier saussage, it's still a great meal!

Personally, I'm kinda proud to be a trailer-park lowlife, so naturally this recipe appeals to me. I live where you can cook outdoors all year round so I've done this one twice on the grill. Once I used the cheapest, reddest stadium frank I could find on a typical soft white bun. Then I tried it with some really expensive Saucisse de Strasbourg with Gruyere on a small Kaiser roll. Both times it was amazing. Guess you have to appreciate black beans.

I agree with the one person here who sees this is Food, folks, we don't have to be snooty about it... My goodness, Epicurious has all kinds of recipes, not just the Elegant ones.
