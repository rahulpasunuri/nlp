I'd rate this between 3.5 and 4 forks. My brothers loved these. They were a bit spicier than I though but then again I added a bit more chiptole for my family members who love it. I had the same problem as stated with the meatballs being a little loose to skewer so I set them on a pan and put them in the freezer for a little bit until they were firm enough to skewer. put them in a covered dish and made them the next day. I only put two on a skewer, 3 just seemed to many to me. Added the chipotle aioli as the dipping sauce which everyone loved as well.

These were a huge hit at my annual holiday party. I made them as directed except that I did not use skewers. I broiled them 1 day before the party in aluminum roasting pans (I tripled the recipe). This kept them moist and juicy. Just before the party I reheated the roasting pan of meatballs in the oven and then kept them warm in a chafing dish. I served the Aioli mentioned in previous reviews which was a big hit. Delicious. I'll be returning to this recipe often.

Were superb. I used half the bacon and used the fried start for a tomato sauce too. Worked well and i used the tomato sauce to cook the meatballs - which were lovely. Full of flavour. I cooked with pasta but rice would've worked too.

Instead of broiling these, I cooked them with a touch of olive oil on the stove top. They were equally good reheated the next day. I also made a dipping sauce with some mayo, some more the the sauce from the peppers and some sour cream. delish!

brought this to a potluck and everyone RAVED. forgot cumin and the lime at the end, but still really good. it felt a little mushy on the skewers at first, but cooked perfectly around them... easy to pick up and eat. added more chipotle than it called for, not too spicy at all.

I made these for a book club and got rave reviews! I served with the chipotle aioli from July 2007 on this site, as recommended by some other reviewers. Doing so is highly recommended as I think these might have been a bit dry alone. I served with a watercress-orange-jicama salad (w/ a mild feta, lime and pepitas) and a mild Mexican rice dish. The entire menu was a huge hit. I'll serve this again and again.

Made these for the first time for our wedding reception and the bride and groom didn't get any, they went so fast! Excellent, excellent! Didn't soak the bread crumbs, the mix was wet enough. We like spicy down here, so added more Chipotle and also served them with a chipotle aioli sauce. They are a bit labor intensive, but well worth it

Adapted this into a Chipotle Turkey Meatloaf with great success. Used ground dark meat turkey and didn't need to soak bread crumbs in milk - just added both at same time with remaining ingredients. Glaze for topping loaves pulled it all together with ketchup, pomegranate molasses, honey and lime juice. Served with coconut mashed sweet potatoes and roasted green beans. Delish!

Made this for a birthday party. The guys loved this (I do not eat spicy) and I always add more spice ingredients (especially Chipotle). Will make this today for the Superbowl for the guys. It was a little wet so I couldn't get the meat balls to stick on the skewers so I just baked them by itself in big balls :) Thinking about just frying them, not sure yet.

Nothing great. Couldn't find ground veal so substituted ground beef. Just tasted like a meatball with a little bacon. Next time I would add WAY more chipotle. I compensated for the bland flavor by kicking up the chipotle mayo and I made a kicked-up chipotle ketchup. The flavor came from the dips, not the meatballs.

These were a big hit for new year's eve, even with lots of other food competing with them. They are an excellent, updated version of a regular meatball, and putting just three on a skewer is an elegant presentation (considering that they are meatballs after all!). Used about half extra chipotle (3T for a doubled recipe) and extra lime on top at the end. Made them and skewered them three hours in advance. Have already had requests to make them again at a future party.

The carnivores in the group really liked it. I made it with the chipotle mayo and that's what sent it over the top, in a good way. I forgot to serve with the lime juice and think that would make a good addition to the recipe.

These were incredible. I have made them twice in the last month for catering jobs and received rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. They are everything a meatball should be, not to mention a welcome change from the traditional. I would serve these again in a heartbeat.

Very nice, although did have a little problem with them falling apart, but still great, well like by my guests and the lime really does bring out the great flavor

These had a very nice balance of flavors to them... and I also made the Chipotle Aioli as recommended--what a great addition, though it wasn't necessary from a taste stance, it sure did add something to the chipotle factor! I did not care for the uneven appearance of the meatballs broiling on one side only...so I turned them once 3/4 of the way through. If you are like me... keep an eye on them to ensure doneness on both sides.

Made these as Mini Meatball sliders with Ancho Chipotle Mayo on Parkerhouse rolls and they were the hit of the party!

The bacon and chipotle were really nice together! These were great immediately after broiling, but definitely lost something as they cooled on the platter.

Very nice. Took more time to put together than the estimate. In a rush, I formed the meat mixture on the skewers in an elongated shape. We had fun coming up with names: meat-lollies, meat daddies, carne dogs....I agree with others; it does need something else. If served piping hot, the lime juice suffices. If not piping hot, a sauce or glaze would help.

The meatballs were a bit disappointing; they just needed something. I made the Chipotle Mayonnaise (Gourmet, September 2006) and that made all the difference in the world! Without it I would have given this recipe only two spoons, with it, three.

Big hit at Thanksgiving as a passed appetizer. I didn't skewer the meatballs, but just stuck a toothpick in each one and passed around. Mine were probably a little hotter since I didn't bother to de-seed the chipotles in adobo sauce - too hard! My husband said, save this recipe for New Year's Eve!

Very good and easy to make. I thought they were missing a little zing, so I glazed with a sweet ancho chili sauce and I thought they were perfect. Everyone gobbled them up!

These were a huge hit at a recent dinner party! I couldn't find ground veal so substituted ground beef. Also mine came out a little liquidy/sticky when I went to form the balls so added in another 1/4 pound of ground pork. Yummy!!

Tried this with much success. Wonderful balance of flavours. Making little balls on skewers seemed too tedious so simply placed larger ones on a grill pan under the broiler. Great with rice and tomato sauce as well as an appy with lime juice.

Amazing even without the bacon (didn't have any but was craving to try these). Very easy

YUM! I made these last night for the Halloween party...big hit! They were easy, a little different and everyone loved them. I made them a day ahead and then broiled them the day of the party. I would make them again, exactly as the recipe.
