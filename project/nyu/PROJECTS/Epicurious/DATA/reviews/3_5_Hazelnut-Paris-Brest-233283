I made this last year for Christmas Eve. I was able to do it all ahead of time. It was amazing! I am making it again for our Christmas party. Although there are lots of steps, it is well worth the effort and none of the steps are very complicated. If you love hazelnuts, you will swoon over this.

I used this recipe for the filling - and it was absolutely delicious. And the tips in the recipe, especially about the pastry cream, are very helpful. Since the last reviewer was not sure about the pastry itself, I used a different recipe for this, from joyofbaking.com and it turned out wonderful. I brought it to a birthday party and it was eaten till the last crumb.

I always hate to be the only one to write a less-than-glowing review, but that being said, I don't think that I'll make this again. I liked the filling but thought that it was a little heavy. My main problem was that my choux pastry was not light and fluffy as it should have been. Because of this, the overall pastry was not really fork-tender like I thought it should be. Perhaps I made a mistake. I know that normally when you over-process dough it turns tough, but choux is supposed to be messed with a lot, right? Mine also did not puff up in the oven as much as I thought it would. I was still able to cut it in half and fill it, but it was not the presentation that I had imagined. The amount of time and energy that went in to this was rather tremendous, and overall not really worth it. My final complaint is that for a 'special occasion' dessert that I plan on serving to company, I like to have the entire thing prepped the day beforehand, and this was not really possible with this recipe. All I can say is that at least it's not terribly expensive to make.

Delicious dessert. While didn't rise as much as expected, it tasted just wonderful and look very acceptable too.... so it didn't matter. I served it with the poached oranges -- a very nice combination.

Unfortunately my choux pastry didn't raise high enough to be able to slice it horizontally in order to add the filling. Having to think fast, I compensated for the missing bottom with a sheet of puff pastry I had in the freezer. No one knew the difference. In fact, I think the puff pastry layer was a better choice than the choux and will use two layers of puff pastry next time to cut down on the prep work. The hazelnut cream is to die for!

This dessert was a true showstopper, well worth the time and trouble. I made it for New Years Eve dinner- also made the Poached Oranges with Candied Zest and Ginger to accompany, as in the picture. Everyone (including me!) was absolutely blown away. My only change was to spread the filling between the pastry layers with a rubbler spatula instead of piping it, which saved on time and clean up. FABULOUS, both to look at and most of all to eat. This really IS a dessert beyond compare!

Had fun making this one.Was worried that I had burnt the hazelnuts but got lucky.The praline needs watching to make sure it does not scorch - probably would use a candy thermometer next time.Butter tasted a little bitter but when combined with the cream it was delicious.

This a not only a beautiful dessert, but also very delicious. I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. Everyone oooed and ahhhhed and said what a goumet cook I am! This recipe is quite a few steps, but none of which is difficult. I will definitely make this again and again.
