As suggested substituted Greek yogurt for half the mayo. Delicious. Will make again.

This was a fabulous change of pace for Ahi Tuna! The rub made the dish. I didn't make the couscous or vegetables but the rub and aoili were very good together on the tuna. I added about 1 1/2 tsps of lemon zest to the aoili as suggested by another reviewer and wish I had read the reviews first. I think replacing some of the mayo with Greek yogurt would have been a nice change but my aoili turned out great and complimented the fish and crust well. This rub will be a staple and I'll keep it on hand for many other uses. Like others said it's a quick, healthy, and impressive dish.

This recipe was so easy to make. Ended up using Yellowtail Tuna (Ahi not available at store). Would have preferred the Ahi. Was still delicious. Paired with a nice French Chablis.

The rub was fantastic! If nothing else, make this recipe for the rub. Even our kids (2 & 6) loved the flavors and wanted more. The aioli was just OK. I wound up adding more garlic (about 4 cloves total) and grated lemon rind but it still tasted mostly like mayo.

This was Delicious! The flavors were a perfect combination! I will definitely make this again.

Great flavor and so very easy. The fennel crust is outstanding. I served the Ahi warm. The aioli is a must to compliment the Ahi. I didn't make the couscous, but served a herbed rice. This is definitely a keeper. Great for family and would definitely wow company.

Definitely a keeper. This is such an easy recipe. The flavor and crunch of the fennel-crust is outstanding. I made the aioli the day before and the flavor was great. Did not make the couscous, but served with a herbed rice.

This was delicious and very simple. For those who find the aioli too heavy, I did half and half mayo and yogurt and it lightened it up. All yogurt would also work. I also added some lemon zest for a little extra zing. The crunchy crust was awesome, as was the couscous side.

This was great! Make sure your grill is good and hot (400-500*) and really get a good sear on the steaks. Great recipe, dynamic flavors in this dish. The Aioli gives a great cool zest! Like many others we had the tuna hot off the grill, it was very nice.

Exceptional. Easy. And comes across as an impressive, restaurant-quality dish. I made it to the letter at first but forgot to drizzle the aioli on our first few bites, which tasted a bit salty. The sauce perfectly counterbalances the salt- hence, don't forget the aioli or if you're going sans sauce, reduce salt in the rub. On my second pass at this I added minced shallots and a dash of honey (agave actually) to the aioli and found that it helped to incorporate the heavy volume of mayo. I recommend the tweak.

This is one of my family's favorite meals. My teenagers even crave it. We get the ahi from our local farmers market very fresh. The herb crust makes it perfect and the aoli is a must. We sear it on the BBQ and it is great every time. Even took it out on our boat last week for a real treat!

Amazingly good. Definitely a restaurant-quality dish! I am a *very* amateur cook, so this took me about 2 hours to make (I am slow at peeling, chopping, etc) from start to finish with the crust, sauce, and fish. I added more veggies: 1/2 of a red onion, 12 oz of sugar snaps, and 3 small carrots; I liked the addition. I had to add more water to make the couscous come out right. I don't have a grill, so I heated a pan on high and then seared the tuna steaks, just over 2 minutes on each side. The meat continued to cook while on the plates and they came out perfect with a pink center. I used 3 cloves of garlic in the aioli and it had a great zing to it. I would absolutely make this again.

Really good. Made as directed except served tuna warm as others have. Just let it rest a few minutes off the grill, then slice and serve.

This recipe was wonderful. The rub was great for the tuna, complimented well with the Aioli. Although, I used the Aioli recipe from the Oct 05 Bon Apetite http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Lemon-Aioli-232884 it just seemed a lot fresher. The snap peas and the couscous tasted wonderful together as well. Even my 3 year old liked the tuna! Will definitely make this recipe again and again!

This was excellent! I have made this in a grill pan and on the grill and both times were great. I liked it served warm but it was also good chilled.

Fantastic! Because most components can be made in advance, it's a perfect and impressive dish for entertaining. I tripled the recipe and served it at a spring dinner party for 20, presented on two large platters with little dishes of extra aioli, and it was a big hit. The spice rub MAKES the dish. I used fresh Opah, a similar fish to tuna, and pan seared it in batches for 2 minutes per side about 20 minutes before serving.

Great recipe. Really good. Really nice combination with the couscous and vegetables. Really nice. The only modification I made - I used the amount of spices called for by the recipe, but added 2 Tbs. of Panko bread crumbs and 2 Tbs. of olive oil to the spice rub. Then I grilled it on Rapid Release foil on the BBQ. I had wonderful Ahi steaks about 1.5" think - I like my Ahi rare, so reduced cooking time to about 3 minutes per side. Came out seared on outside with a wonderful brown crispy crust and nice and red in the middle. Perfecto! Also - if you like this you might like to try the Cilantro and Coriander rubbed pork chops - very similar in concept and also wonderful.

I made this recipe, but decided not to "crust" the fish with the seasonings. We marinated the fish in lemon juice, and served that with the couscous and the sauce. Delicious! I highly recommend this recipe, especially the sause.

We have made it over a dozen times and its always amazing... BUT, we do not let the ahi chill, serve it hot on the couscous with aioli. Fantastic!

This deserves 4 forks from me because of ease of prep, short prep time, lovely presentation and DELICIOUS! I served the tuna warm, however, over room temp couscous and followed the receipe exactly.

This is a good recipe but I have a couple suggestions: (1) Don't overcook the tuna. The tuna is excellent this way.(2) The lemon Aioli is OK, but I'm not a big fan of mayo, so I may try something else to accompany the tuna, perhaps just fresh lemon.

Rating: 4
this is so good I make several times the amount of seasoning and keep in a mill. The couscous is fine, but if you don't have make the fish anyway. Serve with anything. It is better cold, one of the best dishes I've ever made.

MMMmmmmmMMmmMmMM. This was so deliious. It was easy quick and amazing, made this while talking 2 my girlfreind, and it still turned out amazing. Kept very well, and shared it with her the day after. She raved about it.

This has got to be one of the easiest, fastest, yet most showstopping recipes in my arsenal. I've made it for a half-dozen dinners and every single one has been started and finished in under 10 minutes -- prep and cooking. I sear the tuna in a dry skillet rather than grill it -- much easier to set up and clean up.

This is perhaps one of the best dishes you can ever expect to find for a combination of flavor and ease of preparation. If you fry the ahi instead of grilling, add a bit more pepper to the crust and increase the amount added to each steak.

An easy and delicious recipe that's fast enough to throw together after work and special enough for company. I didn't have all of the fresh herbs on hand, but it worked with out them. Will make again...and again...

This ahi tuna recipe (I didn't make the couscous) was excellent! I added a little bit of honey to the aioli to cut down on the acidity. I cooked the tuna in a grill pan, reduced the cooking time to get the perfect sear, and served hot. Delicious!

I am so happy to see a recipe for ahi that isn't based on Asian flavors. The fennel spice mix is delicious, as is the entire recipe. This is my go-to recipe for ahi now.

this recipe for the fish is so fabulous. It can be sered with any number of sides. Quinoa,wild rice, etc. The fish with the rub and the mayo are to die for. It is better cold. I plan to serve on jumbo pasta shell for a buffet.

Great comination of flavors. The fennel-corriander crust married well with all the fresh herbs. Loved the lemon aioli too!

I know this sounds absurd, but we weren't sure if this was "two one-half pound ahi steaks" or "2 and 1/2 pounds of ahi steaks." That said, we used two steaks. The rub was terrific if not a bit salty. Instead of Sugar Snaps (not available) we used green beans that we roasted & tossed in w/ the couscous. Great recipe, super easy, and would work well being seared in a saucepan as well. The aioli is great, but be sure to use a real mayo, not one w/ buckets of sweeteners or stabilizers, like Kraft Light or something.

I used the spice rub but served the tuna over rice with a roasted red pepper and carmalized onion mixture for added color. Loved it so much I am making it again for a dinner party.

Wonderful! The sauce was absolutely great. I usually double garlic in any recipe, but didn't in the sauce since it was raw. Good thing - it had just enough of a 'bite' to it with the amount in the recipe. I would recommend sushi grade ahi.

This is a delicious recipe. I actually thing this August edition of the magazine is one of the best ever done. I have had a subscription since 1986. I loved the rub, pepper and all. The couscous was good too. I have made this dish severaltimes.

This recipe is outstanding. The mix of flavors is wonderful. I left out the black pepper since I don't like the sharpness of it. I will double the amount of rub the next time.

This is a great dish, and easy to make when you want something a little fancier on a regular night. The rub is very tasty, but the amount of pepper called for made it a little too peppery for my family after it was ground up, so I re-did the rub and omitted all but a fraction of the pepper and then I sprinked on extra fresh ground (from a pepper grinder, not a spice grinder) before grilling. I would suggest making the rub and then tasting it to be sure you think your family or guests will like it before putting it on the tuna. There wasn't quite enough liquid left for the couscous to come out moist, so I added quite a bit more and cooked it a little longer. Next time I will add unsalted chicken stock at the end (instead of more water) for extra flavor. The aioli is a nice touch, and very easy. I always add more garlic than called for, and for this dish I doubled it and it seemed fine. My whole family loved it, and that's something for kids who won't usually eat fish!

This was great! My husband raved (and I'm the tuna fan, not he!). I had to add a touch of olive oil to the cous cous after it cooled - it came out a bit dry. Otherwise, don't change a thing!
