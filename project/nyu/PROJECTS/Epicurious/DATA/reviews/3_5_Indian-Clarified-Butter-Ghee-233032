The whole idea of a recipe for ghee is saving money.It is a very simple procedure to make ghee and once you have made it a time or two it is easy.My only comment to this recipe is I reccomend doubling the amount of butter so you dont have to make it often.I find ghee is wonderful for greasing pan when making crepes.When you have ghee on hand you will find many uses for it.

It's less conmplicated and easier to buy ghee in stores. I bought a jar at The Souk in the Pike Place Market in Seattle, and it's lasted me for years; it's the milk solids (that get cheeseclothed out) that cause any butter to go bad.
