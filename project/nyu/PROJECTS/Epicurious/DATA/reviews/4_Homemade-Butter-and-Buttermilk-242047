The quality of the butter you end up will vary greatly by the quality of the cream you use. I am very fortunate to have access to extremely fresh dairy products from a local family farm and I used their barely pasteurized cream - WOW! This butter is the best thing I think I've tasted in my life. I used 3 cups of cream and got 14 oz of butter and a little over 1 cup of buttermilk. It only took about 7 minutes total in the KitchenAid mixer - watching for the visual cues as the Tallahassee reviewer noted is pretty key. This is really special butter!

A lot of fun. I used the same settings on my Kitchenaid that the other reviewer used, but changed speeds when I notioced the visual cues the recipe called for. The end product is delicious, buttermilk and all. Very nice compared to store bought products.

I have been making "homemade" butter every Thanksgiving with the children in my special education classes for 20 years. Here is a tip for you; put the milk in a plastic container (with a plastic marble-optional) and shake vigorously. No messy clean-up. Simply pour off the liquid, as you stated, and squeeze to remove the excess liquid.... "So simple, even a child can do it!"

Great Recipe! I just finished making it and the end result tastes great! I got roughly 18 Oz. (a little over a pound) of great tasting butter, and almost an entire quart of Buttermilk. I bake, A LOT, and try to use only organic (very costly) ingredients in my baking. I am hoping that this will turn out to be a real help for me to ultimately keep my costs down. I Mixed this at #6 speed on my KitchenAide Mixer for 10 minutes, then switched to #10 speed for the last 5 minutes. The only mess came at the very last minute, when the mass of Butter tried to fly out of the bowl. Other than that, this was a very easy recipe to make.

Holy Cow! What a kick. Made two batches. First one, divided between regular use and made a compound butter to stick in freezer for later. Fun for my son and it is delicious. If you are concerned about bacteria from hands, use plastic gloves--works great

My dad says old fashioned butter was made from cultured cream. (You can buy the culture at the same place you get culture for making homemade yogurt.) We saw an old-timey demonstration where they shook a jar of manufacturer's cream (NOT highly pasteurized - commercially it is not called manufacturer's cream, but it is the same thing as Clo's in the green and gold packaging if you can find it - we haven't been able to!). After 10 - 15 minutes of shaking, they got butter and fresh buttermilk. It was delicious!

i love homemade butter, but i would never use my hands to knead it because the hands have so much bacteria, no matter how clean they were - this would cause the butter to spoil too quickly. instead, i would just use spatulas to help squeeze as much moisture from the butter as possible. homemade butter is a longwinded process, but there is nothing on the market which compares to it for creaminess and mouthfeel.

I made butter weekly on my parents farm. WE "washed" the butter with cold water before adding salt and putting it in a crock.

Brings me back to first grade, when we learned to make butter by shaking cartons of whipping cream! Neat idea, but there are so many good, organic butters on the market now, I wouldn't be tempted to make my own very often. I do, however, always make my own whipped cream!
