My guest loved this! It's really looks pretty too! I served it with Turkey Adobo ( http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Adobo-Turkey-with-Red-Chile-Gravy-350577) and it was just the right flavors for this type of turkey!

A nice change of pace from traditional cranberry sauce. A gorgeous addition to the Thanksgiving table.

My guests and I really enjoyed this recipe as our cranberry side over Thanksgiving. It's super easy to make and incredibly fresh and tangy. It's definitely tart and a departure from "normal" holiday cranberries, but IMO it adds something unique and bright to the table. Will be making it again for sure.
