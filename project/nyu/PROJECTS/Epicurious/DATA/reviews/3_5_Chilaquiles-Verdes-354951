We did this the quick and easy way using bottled salsa verde and tortilla chips. The instructions on cooking the eggs and chips worked perfectly.

It was actually quite a tasty recipe, though it lacked umph. Still, the sort of thing you can go on eating until youre full. However, it was too sour for my 8 year-old.

This was very good. For a low fat option spray the tortillas lightly with olive oil and bake them (on an already hot pizza stone) until crisp. I also added two tomatoes to the salsa, but did not boil them with the tomatillos.

to make this a little lighter and truly VEGETARIAN leave out the chicken broth and the eggs in the recipe. The flavor of the chile is much more pronounced. Really good and would definitely make it again!

Wonderful! Had some friends over the other night and entertained them with the dish. We added some black beans and used bagged tortilla chips instead of making our own and it turned out great. Very easy and wound highly recommend for any meal of the day.

Fantastic...simply fantastic. The homemade salsa verde and the homemade chips add such a dimension of flavor. We had leftovers, and they kept well in the fridge.
