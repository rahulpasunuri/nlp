I made this last night for company. Really good. I served with scallops over grilled asparagus. beautiful plate and so tasty. Hot scallops and cold flan. Yum. Next time I will add more cayenne, but the corn came through beautifully.

I doubled the recipe and made it in a muffin pan lined with aluminum foil. I took the flan and relish to a picnic and that way it was easy to eat straight out of the foil "cup"- it was a big success! The combination of the creamy, slightly spicy flan and the fresh relish is delicious. Next time I might add some herbs though.

If you are looking for a side dish to make you look like an accomplished chef, this is it. And the best part? It's really easy! Also, it tastes very rich, but it seems like it is relatively low in calories. I made this the night before my dinner party and tasted great. In fact, serving this cold side dish is a nice contrast to a warm entree. I can also see it served as a first course or a salad. Finally, all of the raves about the relish are spot on -- it is an essential part of the dish. It is also great as a left over to put on eggs or on a salad -- endless possibilities -- so consider making a little extra.

I made this in a pan instead of ramikens, and used a large pinch of cajun seasoning instead of cayanne. I served it with balsamic glazed portobellos over sauteed spinach and grilled asparagus. I didn't put the basil in the relish, and let the rosemary in the mushrooms be the main spice. This was delicious, similar to a polenta cake. I definitely will use this recipe again!

I only made the relish, as I was searching for something to go with a pan-fried pork chop recipe from Saveur. I ended up having to saute the relish very quickly in a pan because I accidentally did the chopping of the veggies on the same chopping board as the one used for the raw meat! Once cooked, I let it cool before adding the vinegar. Still, it turned out very yummy. I added a bit of parsley to the finished product. Besides, I prefer cooked onions to raw, so it worked out well.

Refreshing, robust corn flavor (fresh corn from farmer's market). Everyone at dinner party finished theirs completely. Relish is a gem.

The corn flan was a lot of work and not really worth it. It didn't have much of a flavor at all. The relish was tasty, so I'm trying to figure out another use for that.

The Corn Flans were very bland, they could never stand on their own without the relish. The relish on the other hand was delicious, and I would use it in another recipe. Overall, not worth the time..

This recipe worked very well. I tried it the first time w/out straining for more texture and that turned out well, also! Delicious corn taste and wonderful hot or cold.

Elegant and delicious but rather time consuming.
