Good recipe. The dough baked up well - golden with a crisp outside and a fluffy inside. Good flavor. I even let the sponge sit for about 15 hours then made the dough and let it sit in the fridge about 24 hours, punching it down 3-4 times. The issue I have had with other doughs - mix and let rise and cook within about 3 hours - is the dough cooked up more like a cracker crust than a tasty chewy dough. Just a typical home oven - 500 degrees with a pizza stone. This is my new recipe.

This pizza dough is the BOMB! I've made many and this one is so delicious, tasty, easy to work with. Once, I even forgot that I had placed the proofing part in a cupboard, to keep it out of a draft, for two days. Gave it a stir, went on with the recipe and it was marvelous. I make the whole batch, par- bake some of the pies, then place in the freezer for topping and finishing later when I have less time.

I have used this recipe often and just keep coming back to it. I make one pizza when the recipe is completed and freeze the other 3 balls before they rise.

Wow...this made the best pizza I have ever eaten! Seriously makes the best thin crust crispy pizza! The dough is incredibly easy to work with. I agree with the others that it does make quite a bit of dough. We had 6 people and used up only 1/2 of the dough with about 14" thin pizzas. I stored the rest in the fridge, making sure that it was coated with olive oil as not to dry and me and my husband made four smaller pizzas throughout the rest of the week. Stored well for 6 days.

Great recipe. It does yield alot of dough, so here's a great tip if you don't use it all initially AND if you like extra-crispy crust. After stretching the dough out into desired size, I like to par-bake the crust without any toppings, for about 4-5 minutes, just until it holds its form when held. At this point, you can then either top your pizza and return to the oven to finish baking -OR- if you have extra dough rounds you can freeze them, and have instant pizza crusts for the next time. Par-baking the crust eliminates any dough-y middle and gives you a super crispy crust.

Worth the overnight wait! Result was a tender,flavorful pizza dough with a nice texture. It will now be my go to recipe. Instead of the suggested '8' I made 3 larger balls of dough to use for 15" inch pizzas. I also put aside one very small piece of dough to make a saucer sized pizza so I could immediatly try out the dough by making a mini pizza for myself which was delish! The only problem I had was in the begining when I tried to get the 'sponge' to form & nothing was happening. So I added 1/2 tsp. of sugar to the sponge and it started to bloom immediatly. The sponge took about 5 minutes longer than the recipe said it would to form. Maybe it was my yeast? I set it out over night and followed all the rest of the directions to a 'T'. I'm very pleased with the results. I have one dough ball in the fridge for dinner tommorow & the other two I froze for use later.

Incredibly tasty and almost impossible to mess up. I haven't made it the same way twice and it's turned out every time! I separate it into four rounds, and freeze three of the rounds (each wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and all three in one big zip-top bag). One round is enough for two personal-sized pizzas. To use the frozen dough, I unwrap it and let it thaw in a bowl in the fridge overnight. Then I take it out around two hours before rolling it out and cooking it. If it's going to be sitting out much longer than that, it helps to brush the exposed dough with some olive oil to keep it from drying out.

Nice crispy and airy crust. Much better than the pizza dough recipe I had been using. Easy to work with too. Makes a lot but I will freeze as others have suggested. Made Pizza Margherita for my first attempt and it was delish. I roasted a head of garlic, spread olive oil on dough, then squeezed out & spread garlic followed by sauce, cheese & tomatoes. Added basil after cooking. Watch the time as mine were done in 7-8 minutes. Yum.

this has become my pizza dough recipe. I make 4 instead of 8 for more traditionally sized pizzas. SO easy to work with and freezes well. Freeze after the second rise (1 hour on counter). Thaw in fridge and proceed. IT'S AWESOME.

This is my go-to recipe for pizza because it's not greasy like a lot of dough made with oil. I freeze the dough in balls and when I plan on using it, I just take it out -- no need to defrost in the refrigerator. It's forgiving, and I've actually left it out for a couple of days without problems. I've substituted half of the flour for wheat, added raw sunflower seeds, or substituted bread flour for AP flour to add "chew". Always flawless. I don't use a pizza stone I just put it on parchment paper. Seriously, you have to try this recipe!

This recipe was my first attempt at making pizza dough and my family loved it. My partner could not stop talking about how great he thought it was. I made three larger pizzas, I think the pan is 14". This dough will be at least a once a month thing for us probably.

I've made this dough a few times and never been disappointed, even after freezing. I roll it very thin and cook it on my stone at 550. NYC says it's the water, but I got news for them! I love that it makes so much as that's less work in the long run.

fantastic pizza dough recipe. Made for the first time tonight--it rolled like a dream and was perfect for grilling. my husband said it was in a league with pizza in Rome (campo de fiore) but he just wants me to cook more most probably.

I have made 6 different pizza dough recipes over the last two years, and this is definitely the best. It has a light, airy, and crisp texture, with a clean, slightly tangy taste. I halved the recipe, made two pizzas, and will be freezing the other two. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

This dough is extremely good, I thought it was going to be tough but actually the crust is beautifully crispy and the inside is soft and the flavour is indeed lovely and tangy. I did as another reviewer suggested and froze the dough balls which defrosted and cooked beautifully too.

First attempt at making pizza dough -- no stone, tiles, or special pan. Topped with what I had in the house -- leftover puttanesca sauce from this site, reduced fat provolone, prosciutto, canned artichoke hearts. Husband actually kneeled at my feet!

Very nice dough, great texture. I made it as the recipe stated exactly and it was a good experience. My husband folded some of the oil into the dough when we should have only punched it down so a few rose less then they should have, but still wonderful.

To the Seattle cook asking about freezing extra dough...I've made this 3 or 4 times and have always frozen at least 5 of the rounds. I don't roll them out, but just wrap each individual ball with plastic wrap and freeze. I defrost in the fridge overnight and then bring to room temp a couple hours before cooking. Love this recipe!

Delicious! I used a little whole wheat pastry flour (a little less than half) and a teaspoon of honey (added to the sponge). It rolled out very easily and we made 6 pizzas that were about 12-15 inches wide. We rolled ours very thin and baked it on a stone. I thought brushing the dough with olive oil kept it crispy and gave it high curb appeal. I've rolled out 2 extra rounds to freeze and top another night. The crust was crispy and chewy and had great flavor. Next time I will brush it with olive oil mixed with crushed garlic.

This was very easy to make and work with, could handle all my toppings and slipped off the pizza peel effortlessly. As some others I made this over the course of 3 nights and it came out great. Chewy and crunchy in all the right places - delicious!

This sounds great, but makes a huge quantity. Has anyone had good experience freezing the balls of dough?

Excellent recipe! I did it all by hand and it was really easy. This is the best at-home pizza dough I have had.

WOW! Finally a pizza dough that you can make at home that comes out great. I even froze pizzas with toppings and cooked directly on the oven rack... AWESOME.... Making another batch right now.

This recipe worked very well for pizzas made on a pizza stone in my big green egg. The crust was easy to handle and supported numerous toppings very well. We made 5 different pizzas: Classic Margharita; Heirloom Tomato and Bufalo Mozzarella Pizza; Roast Chicken and Potato Pizza; Pulled BBQ Pork Pizza; Fig and Marscapone Pizza. So many pizzas - only one stomach!

Very good but I think it would have been even better with MUCH less yeast. Next week I'll try it again with less than half the amount called for.

Like the reviewer from Cambridge, I made this dough over three nights. It was by far the best dough I have made yet. Delightfully easy to work with, light, tender yet crisped beautifully when cooked at 550°F on clay tiles in my oven. I've made a LOT of pizza dough, and this is my new favorite.

To answer the question from the last entry...Yeast needs to be proofed to see if it is alive before just as you commented so the cook does not waste flour on yeast that is dead. Yeast is a live, alive organism by proofing yeast first you ask it to wake up first before you can proceed to the rest of the recipe.

Before I make this dough I have a question for those of you who tried it(don't want to ruin 6 cups of flour). When making the dough, not the sponge, it's seems that it is not necessary to let the yeast disolved before adding other ingredients and starting the mixer. Am I reading this correctly, because it seems strange compared to all other pizza dough recipes I've tried. Please answer me?

Makes a great dough. I raised my oven temp to 535 and the pizzas came out great. Nice crust, slightly chewy, yet firm and crunchy. Also, I added some lightly crushed fennel seeds to the dough for additional flavor.

I have made quite a bit of pizza dough, this was the best I've ever made. I did do it all by hand instead of by machine (I was too lazy to go get it out of storage) but I'm sure using machine would just make it easier. Never used a sponge before and apparently that's the way to go.

Produces nice dough that's easy to work with. I agree with previous reviewer, I have quicker recipes that I feel produce as good of result in less time.

This was a good recipe for pizza dough and, admittedly, this dough stretched out very nicely and was great to work with. That said, I didn't feel the extra time affected the flavor of the dough/crust significantly enough to warrant having this replace my standard recipe from Epicurious (Bon Appetit 1998 http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/printerfriendly/5655 ). I might try it again, but only if I knew well in advance that I was making pizza, which is not always the case.

Excellent dough! I also made it over 2 nights and it turned out just fine no matter which toppings were used, even plain jarred sause and cheese for the children. I also froze 1/2 the recipe for a later date. That happened to be only a few days later! Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temp and roll out and bake as usual.

The best pizza dough I have ever made. I made this over 3 nights because that was more convenient for a weeknight dinner. This is what I did: Night 1 - make sponge. Night 2 - make dough. Night 3 - bake pizza. I had a group of people over so we did a variety of topings - blue cheese and pear; sweet potato, scallion, and goat cheese; pesto and fresh tomatoes; wild mushrooms and blue cheese; red peppers, onion, sausage, and goat cheese, etc... It was great!

This pizza dough is awesome. I have not worked with yeast in years and I have never made my own pizza before- so I was worried I would need a plan B if the dough didn't work out. I didn't need one. The dough behaved exactly as it was supposed to- and the resulting flavor was outstanding. The dough was crisp and yet a tender- my guests were blown away. We used toppings of pesto, goat cheese, proscuitto, Marinara sauce, fresh burrata cheese- baby spinach and kalamata olives. I will be using this recipe forever!
