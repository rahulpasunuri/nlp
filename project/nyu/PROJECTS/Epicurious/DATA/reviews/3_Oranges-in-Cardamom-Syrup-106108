So. Is it a 5" strip of LEMON peel or ORANGE peel???????? I'd try this if I knew. Read the recipe carefully.

Honestly, I think I could have gotten the same results from a can of oranges in syrup, sprinkled liberally with ground cardamom. Which is fine as it goes, but is not worth the trouble of making myself.

After a huge and heavy meal our dinner guests politely took small servings of this dessert, then had seconds, then thirds. Only our swollen bellies prevented us from having fourths. It's sublime.

Really easy to do - and has the exotic taste of Africa that goes so well with other Moroccan dishes. Don't wait to try this yourself.

An perfect light dessert for ending a Middle East dinner. I also served it over vanilla ice cream.

Light, refreshing, slightly exotic tasting. Great for brunch. Added a few Medjool dates when serving for dessert.

Really light and refreshing. Use best quality oranges. It took longer for the syrup to boil down than the recipe indicates. Great on vanilla ice cream. Even better if a Ceylon cinnamon stick is used.

It was much simpler just to use ground cardomom from the Spice Islands bottle, and still delicious. And there was plenty of syrup for double the amount of oranges. I almost despaired when the syrup turned into big gloppy lumps of soft caramel as it was poured over the fruit, but overnight it all dissolved/melted together nicely and the result was excellent with Shrove Tuesday pancakes.

This was delicious - especially with the oranges right now! I skipped the cardamom pods though and used ground cardamom instead. I also chose to segment the oranges. This was a great lowfat dessert with nonfat loaf cake and a small scoop of vanilla ice cream alongside. My dinner party loved it!

To the first reviewer, your question about the ingredients was entirely understandable. Many--no most--recipes, including this and other Epicurious recipes, are not well written. All recipe should list all the ingredients used, including the orange strip and they should all be presented in the same manner; that is, "5 oranges, sliced, peel and pith removed; 1 5-inch long orange peel strip; 1 5-inch long lemon peel strip, ... 1/2 teaspoon crushed cardamon seeds (use 5 cardamon pods for this amount)...." Putting an ingredient in procedure is not good instructional writting. Reading and following such recipes is frustrating and confusing. Please use your editors Epicurious.
