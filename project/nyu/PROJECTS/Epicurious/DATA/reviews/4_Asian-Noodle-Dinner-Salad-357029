Great. My boyfriend loved it - we did it with Chicken but thought it might work well with extra firm tofu for the protein.

I give this a 4 fork for simplicity, and the taste is pretty balanced as well. The dressing is good as is but I added cucumber as others suggested, used cabbage instead of Romaine to keep it crisp, and crumbled peanuts to finish it. I might use shredded carrot next time to add color. Perfect for a summer dinner, or potluck any time. And my kids loved it too.

Very good. I replaced the tomatoes with shredded carrots.

Super fast and easy especially if you used fully cooked shrimp. But it needs a lot more than 3 ounces.

This recipe gets 4 forks IF you BBQ chicken thighs (bnls,sknls)with your favorite, homemade bbq sauce and make this asian dressing. It is not as good when you use a boughten asian sauce(which is pretty typical of pre-made, grocery store sauces).

An easy summer salad that made a delicious meal! Used what we had on hand - cucumbers, toms, carrots. Added pan sautéed shrimp, soba noodles and dressing. Fresh and a new addition to the menu rotation.

A delicious, healthy and easy recipe. Made a few substitutions - almond butter instead of peanut butter and tamari sauce instead of soy sauce. Not a big difference. This recipe is a keeper.

A winner! Nice for a different twist on the conventional salad. Couldn't find soba noodles though, so used whole wheat angel hair pasta which is pretty close.

Excellent recipe- my whole family loved it, including an 8 year old and a 5 year old. The only complaint that I have is that the amount of noodles seems excessive- a pound for 2 servings? I would definitely half that amount!

A simple and delicious meal!

Delicious! It is a light meal, easy to prepare. I pan-cooked shrimp in garlic-infused olive oil and I blanched the snow peas in a small amount of salted water until crisp-tender. Very yummy.

My favorite everyday Chinese dish from living in China is Liang Mian (cold noodles). This is exactly it! The only change that I use to make it more "authentic" is that I only use a pinch of sugar, a little less ginger and about half the peanut butter. I also add some red pepper flakes, thinly sliced tomatoes, and julienned cucumbers. Everyone who has eaten this has said it was amazing!

I was not impressed. The ginger in the dressing was over powering.I may make again but would use another dressing.

This is a delicious addition to our dinner lineup. The dressing is definitely the star of this dish. I made it with shrimp instead of chicken; added grated carrots instead snow peas. Next time I believe I'll add something to add some zing...maybe sliced jalapenos or red pepper flakes.

It tastes just like the Asian salad at the restaurants. It is so easy!

Very good. Dressing is Excellent. Only change I made was I used Buckwheat Udon noodles.

This is so delicious and simple. Perfect for a backyard summer barbeque. Will definitely make again!

Really delicious. I made extra dressing and used it to marinate the chicken for about 40 minutes before cooking. The dressing is amazing.

I used cubed leftover turkey from Easter dinner. Substituted 1 grated carrot for the snow peas. It was delicious cold or warm. My son asked for his warm so I microwaved it for 40 seconds. The dressing is to die for. Flavors are even better the next day. Yum!

Delicious meal, delicious sauce! The lemon really makes it stand out. I added peanuts as a garnish on top at the end.

LOVED by all, agree the dressing makes it and we used snow peas from our garden. No tomatoes as they just aren't in season. WE also had an Asian marinated chicken so the salad was the side dish not the main. Will make again and add chicken

Yum. This was delicious. The dressing was especially tasty. Will make again as my family loved it!

I did not like this dish.

This is truly delicious. I found the recipe a bit confusing in terms of how many noodles to cook. I made the greens (romaine, snow peas, etc.) and the asian dressing as stated. I used a single broiled chicken breast (shredded). And I cooked half of a 16 oz. bag of Chinese egg noodles. Proportionally it was almost right, though I had some noodles left over. I kept the dressing separate and mixed in 2-3 tbs. per invidual serving.

This was fabulous, with plenty left over. The dressing is the star of the show.

Loved this. Made it home and for a party. Added lots more shrimp and switched to spinach for the party.

A fabulous healthy dinner that will go into our rotation - made as is but added extra dressing

The dressing makes the whole dish. Delish!! Fantastic combo of flavors. I used rice vermicelli noodles to make the dish gluten free (of course I also used GF Tamari as a soy sauce alternative). GF or not I highly recommend the style of noodles for this dish.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly, except cut down on the amount of noodles ( I used soba ) and used honey instead of sugar. So good, and can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch.

I didn't think my guy would like this, but he loved it! I made a few modifications. I tasted the dressing as I added ingredients and did everything as suggested except I only used 1 tbs of sugar and 1 tbs of ginger. Delicious. To the salad, I added diced red peppers, about a cup of snow peas, and an extra green onion. Yum. I used two chicken breasts, cooked on 400, topped with paprika, dry mustard, garlic powder, coriander, salt and pepper. When they had cooled, I diced them. Delicious. I didn't add the dressing to the salad until we were ready to eat, and then only to our individual portions - that way the leftovers wouldn't be soggy the next day. I did add a bit of dressing to the Soba noodles and served them under the veg/chicken mixture. It was so light and delicious. We only used about 1/2 lb of noodles and had plenty of leftovers. Don't overcook them - they only take about 3 minutes to cook in boiling water. Great idea for a quick mid-week dinner. I'd serve this as a side dish at a summer bbq, too. Yum!

Wow, this was delicious and very easy! I basically followed the recipe but used what I had available: whole wheat spaghetti, cucumber and red bell pepper instead of snow peas, 1 tsp minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I left out the ginger and the lemon zest. Everyone asked for seconds.

Tomato is awful in dead of winter. So, skipped those entirely, used "little gem" lettuces, and parboiled broccoli cut into little florets and some stem. Baked chicken thighs rubbed with garlic and sprinkled with Bragg Liquid Amino instead of breast. Used buckwheat soba (a 12 oz. package)and almost overcooked it, so really no more than 2 min...in the dressing used 1 T agave instead of regular sugar and Bragg Liquid Amino instead of soy sauce. My husband pronounced he could eat this every day and my kids had seconds.

Good light recipe. I used almond butter because we were out of peanut butter. Took the recommendation of the other reviewer and used less noodles - we definitely did not need a lb. between the two of us.

So good! First, a pound of pasta for 2 people is ridiculous, so halved that and used whole wheat angel hair. Otherwise made as directed except for a substitution of arugula for romaine, which is not super important and merely a question of taste. The second time I made it as stated above but with another substitution of broccolini (cooked for the last 4 minutes with the pasta) since my husband has an irrational fear of all forms of peas. I have to admit, more vitamins and more flavor. Oops, also on the second go-round, added a spoonful of Hot Chili Oil (Dynasty) because we both like a little heat. The dressing is the key. Would be good on everything...
