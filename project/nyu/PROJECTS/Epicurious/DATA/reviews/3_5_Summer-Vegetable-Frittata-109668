Delicious and easy meal! Increased eggs by 2 and added a dash of cayenne. Served with fresh tomatoes and a green salad. Tasty leftovers eaten at breakfast!

Excellent recipe...I left out the prosciutto, so I should have added a touch more salt, but it was still great. Good way to use up some of those delicious summer veggies :)

Wonderful frittata. Didn't have blossoms and used white onion in place of the scallions, but it was still delicious. I used the Romano i had on hand in place of the Parm and added it to the egg mixture. As per other reviewers, I added an extra egg and slightly more prosciutto. Will keep this recipe in mind for the next time I have company for brunch.

My husband and company all loved this! Unfortunately, I couldn't find squash blossoms this time of year but it was delicious all the same. The thinly sliced zucchini made the most lovely presentation and the flavors were amazing. I especially like that this frittata did not call for cream or whole milk, a big plus in my book!

this was disappointing. All that chopping for a so-so outcome. I should have read some of the other reviews before cooking, maybe I could have made it better with some of the suggested additions. The vegetables were surprisingly tasteless, even though I followed the recipe. I'd recommending tasting the veggie mixture before adding the eggs, and then adding herbs, seasoning, whatever, to make sure the veggies taste good. After that, the eggs, cheese, and the time under the broiler should work out fine.

This has got to be one of the best frittata's ive had, i was shoort on supplies so had to substitute some eggs with egg whites, as well as used less green onions. and didn't have enough time to get zucchini blossoms, and even with those things missing, it turned out great.

I used Turkey sausage instead of prosciutto and switched out a couple of eggs for whites to make it healthier. Also used rainbow chard for color variation instead of the Swiss chard.The chopping of all the ingredients was labor intensive but once all the prep was over- the rest was easy.I had some folks over for brunch and everyone really loved it.Looks impressive as well as tasty.

Very delicious and healthy frittata, Absolutely needs at least 8 eggs, due to the fact that the eggs that are sold are just getting smaller, Extra Large is equivalent to the old Large. Easy to whip up and perfect for night that you know you need to eat something and you just dont want a huge meal. makes great leftovers the next day. Serve with soup for a complete meal!

This was very nice. Not a show-stopper but a really good vegetarian addition to my brunch table. Folks liked it. I also made a new-mexican chile sauce to use with this and other recipes that helped add some zest to this recipe

This was wonderful. I used an extra 2 eggs and 2 egg whites, just because it didn't look like enough (I've never made a frittata with only 6 eggs!), skipped the blossoms, only because there weren't enough that looked nice in the garden, and mixed a cup of shredded fontinella in with the eggs, instead of the parmesan on top. A nice plate of sliced tomatoes on the side,a bottle of white wine, a wonderful easy summer dinner. Definitely a repeat!

My family loves this dish. I add more proscuitto and eggs to the recipe. I also have found that it takes a lot more time to cook then the recipe states.

I left out the prosciutto and squash blossom, as they are not readily available in my area. This is delicious and surprisingly low-calorie. The part in the recipe about lifting the edges to let the loose egg run under didn't really work for me, so I just reduced the heat a bit and didn't worry about that part - it worked fine. This is a great way to get a healthy, easy and quick meal on the table. Leftovers keep and reheat nicely.
