This is a great meal that is quick, easy and romantic. Just leave out the onions, use a little less garlic, add saffron spice and pine nuts to really make it unique!

This is a great quick and easy dish. I made it for dinner tonight, and it was a big hit. I also squeezed a little lemon juice over it, and that was good on it.
