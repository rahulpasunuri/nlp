Wonderful!! I had to omit lemon, because my husband hates it. I used a roasted garlic olive oil, and some of the roasted garlic chopped in dressing. I should have known better, but DON'T try to leave scallions on the grill for 5 mintes!!. Save yourself some time and use store-bouhgt roasted red peppers.

Easy, simple, nice fresh warm weather flavors. It's a staple in our house. We vary ingredients to be grilled, adding different veggies, pineapple, etc., and can also vary dressing. A good base to begin with.

Excellent fresh, spring meal. We added avocado and had soup, too.
