An excellent sloppy joe recipe. It's fairly simple, and the flavors come through very cleanly. I agree that there's quite a bit of slop in the sloppy part. While I agree that the biscuits make this quite a filling meal, the sloppy joe flavor enhances the cheddar cheese flavor of the biscuit. I will definitely make this again!

This got raves on the 1st cool day of fall. Served it over cornbread per another reviewer - so the extra sloppy was soaked right up. This will become a staple week night dinner.

As some have reported, I found the Sloppy Joe mixture a little too sloppy. I used a 28-oz can tomato puree instead of whole tomatoes. I added 1 tablespoon tomato paste, which didn't thicken it very much, so I added some dry TVP (texturized vegetable/soy protein), which has the texture of the meat after it absorbs some of the liquid. A great way to stretch a meal and to thicken the mixture without changing the flavor. TVP can be found in the bulk section of Whole Foods and in health food stores.

The boys loved it. The molasses makes it!

Loved it, but I agree with some of the comments below in that the "Joe" part is too much on the cheddar biscuits. The second time I made it I put it over cornbread, which was better...

Made this just as the recipe says and we loved it! I thought it was a bit rich to eat with the biscuits but my kids and husband loved the whole thing. I loved the turkey over brown rice as leftovers- even more delicious the next day. Will become a staple in our house...although my kids call them sloppy jills!

Didn't have celery, and served meat over leftover cornbread. YUM

Yum -- I added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste and a teaspoon of chipotle chili powder instead of the tabasco. Easy & delish

I just made the meat and served it on hamburger buns. I didn't have celery or a pepper, so I dry sauteed minced mushrooms instead. I also used jalapeno hot sauce instead of Tabasco, and a whole (small) can of tomato puree instead of ketchup. Yum!

Made modification with my daughter. Kicked up the spice by adding barbeque sauce, red pepper, and tomatoe paste instead of ketchup. Also served it open face on texas garlic toast.

This recipe was great. However both my husband and I felt that the Sloppy Joes were great and that biscuits were great; just a little too much eating them both together. For the Sloppy Joe mixture, I only made one substitution based on what I had on hand. Since the turkey I buy is normally in 1.25 lbs., I added 1.00 lbs. of ground beef too. After cooking for 30 minutes the mixture was still pretty watery, so I cooked it for 45-55 minutes total. I also wanted to make it slightly healthier so I added ¼ cup of wheat bran and ½ cup of oat bran. This addition does not add any flavor and soaked up the extra liquid (nobody every notices this addition by the way).

It was worth making this recipe to discover the cheddar buttermilk biscuitsthey're fabulous! The Sloppy Joes are good/fine, but nothing special. I didn't have tomato paste on hand or I would have tried that suggestion from other reviewers. I wanted a bit sweeter taste; maybe I'll add a bit of brown sugar next time.

Best Turkey Sloppy Joes we've ever had. Although I just served them on store bought whole wheat buns. I also put all the veggies in the food processor after I cooked them down with the sauce then added them to the cooked turkey meat. Very YUMMY!

This was fabulous. I used the white turkey meat and only 1 lb and halved all of the other ingredients. Best sloppy joes ever! I used regular toasted rolls as well. The best!

I'm a fan. It's easy and it's good. I used pureed tomatoes to save time, and added a can of tomato paste. Biscuits are good too...

These were good, but not exceptional. I didn't use the biscuits (though have made them on their own and love them) because I wanted a softer roll to soak up the slop. Basic, tasty, light-flavored sloppy joe. You could definitely add spice or other flavors if you wanted to, but it's a tasty no-frills meal on its own.

I made this recipe for an Inauguration party. I appropriately changed the name to Sloppy Joe Bidens. The simple dish was amazing. I doubled the recipe and found I had to drain the turkey before adding the sauce and cook for a bit longer to get the right consistency. I agree with the other write up which recommended adding tomato paste. I chose a chipotle hot sauce to give an even better flavor. I recommend this recipe for a fun Friday or movie night.

Good, simple, hearty. I made this on a Saturday evening when we just wanted something warm and not too complicated - just watching a DVD. Certainly not a meal to impress company. But tasty. Since my husband and I don't eat beef we're always looking for new ways to prepare ground turkey. I didn't make the biscuits - just served the sloppy joe mixture over a split and toasted herbed French bread. I didn't have celery so I used a green bell pepper. I also used a little tomato paste as other reviewers suggested. Will make again.

We loved the Sloppy Joe part & skipped the biscuits per other reviewers. I recommend adding about 1 TBL tomato paste-it both deepens the flavor & thickens the sauce. Would definitely make again!

I liked the Joe, and I liked the biscuit, but I didn't like them together. The sauce was good served over brown rice the next day, and the biscuits made a wonderful side bread with meatloaf, but together they didn't work...one overpowered the other and I couldn't tell which was which and you couldn't pick it up with your hands ala Sloppy Joe. Cheers

Why this recipe only has a 74% user rating, I have no idea. It is simply scrumptious and I've made it a dozen times already. The biscuits are easy and very flavorful with the turkey joes. It's a hit with all of my family and guests.

Skip the biscuits and serve open-face or on a quarter baguette. Great home-style recipe, has been passed around the American community here for a taste of home.

The biscuits make this truly special. I like to use only dark meat ground turkey (which I can find at Whole Foods) and add about a tablespoon of tomato paste. Great comfort food.

This is an amazing dish! But make sure to use the ground turkey while it's fresh. Even using turkey that's a day or two old can affect the flavor. I make extra cheddar buttermilk biscuits because they go quickly.

This was not great, but okay. At first it was kind of blah, so I added some Franks's hot sauce, then it tasted like warm hot sauce. I think next time I will add a few tablespoons of tomato paste and see how that goes...

I've made this recipe several times and it's always been good. It's great comfort food, but I do agree with another reviewer that it may not be "company worthy" - although, I'm not sure I'd ever serve sloppy joes at a dinner party! I can't remember off the top of my head if I made any alterations in the recipe. If you're an improv cook , you'll know what needs to happen. I don't make this dish often, but it is one of those "Oh yeah, let's have that this week" kind of dinners.

I'm sorry, but this recipe was some where close to awful. I love cheese, I love turkey, what did I do so utterly wrong to have made this dish petrifying?

Gourmet seems to offer many variations on earlier Bon Apetit recipes--juding from this Web site. If lean ground turkey breast is on sale, this recipe is fine without the tastier fat. No buttermilk? Make one of the flatter, dense (vs. cakey) types of cornbread, adding fresh corn.

Rating: 3
This is an easy, tastey recipe that was good on the biscuits (cut way down on the salt in that recipe) and also good on rice. The sauce measurements seem a little skimpy but the turkey releases moisture as you cook it, so the amounts in the recipe are correct. Not quite "company" worthy. Good for a quick weekday meal and as a leftover lunch treat.

The biscuits were actually pretty good, but the turkey mixture was bland and uninspiring. I'll have to find a different filling, alas.

When my wife came home from Costco with 10 lbs of ground turkey, I desperately searched this site for something to spare me from turkey burgers. Mission accomplished. I think this recipe is terrific. I eyeballed the ingredients that went into the food processor and wound up having to add more ketchup but I thought the flavor overall was great. We also loved the biscuits which were a great bed for the Sloppy Joe. I would not make the Sloppy Joe without the biscuit -- it was just too good together.

Freezes well, which is important when you cook for two. My husband, still scarred by years of school cafeteria joes, was skeptical about eating it, even if the recipe hailed from Gourmet. He ate it and enjoyed it. I liked it better, having fonder memories of sloppy joes, and I have enjoyed turning the frozen leftovers into "gourmet" fast food. I made the cheddar biscuits to go with. Nice complement to the flavors of the sloppy joe, but the biscuits couldn't handle the weight on the joe mixture. We wound up eating these with fork and knife. In the future, I'll not bother with the biscuits for this dish, though I will make them to go with other items from time to time.

This recipe sure beat the Manwich from the can! I did substitute high-quality ground beef (not a big fan of ground turkey) & it still turned out awesome. A nice natural way to make sloppy joes!

Made this last night for game 2 of the World Series (go Sox!) and it was perfect for one of those sit-in-front-of-the-tv-and-watch-sports dinners. In fact, this dish would work very well at a Super Bowl party since it's easy to serve and tastes very similar to chili and corn bread. I followed the suggestions from the cook in Cyprus, TX and used pureed tomatoes, left out the ketchup, cut the molasses in half, doubled the tabasco and garlic and added chili powder, dry mustard and cumin. Yummy. My husband didn't care for the biscuits - thought they were too dense and cornmealy. So next time I'd leave out the cornmeal and make classic buttermilk biscuits instead.

Making this for the second time. I use pureed tomatoes rather than blending the whole tomatoes. Just saves time. Until I tried this recipe, I just grabbed a spice packet from the store whenever I wanted sloppy joes. Nice to be able to make this from scratch now! The biscuits are fine, but to save time this evening I am serving on hamburger buns.

With just a bit of tweaking, this went from average to amazing. I left out the celery (didn't have any), and used a 28oz can of tomato puree instead of the whole tomatoes. Also left out the ketchup, since I thought it was "tomato-y" enough without it. Spices stayed the same; that is, until I tasted it. Blecchhh. Added more Tabasco, two teaspoons chili powder and one of dry mustard. Hesitated and didn't add cumin, but will next time. The result was very nice, but will be nicer still with more additions. The biscuits were a bit overpowered by the meat mixture, but still well worth the little time it took to make them. I think one is tempted to view this meat mixture as a bland chili rather than a nice sloppy joe meat. ;-)

The biscuits were nice, though I didn't like the scallions. The sloppy joes were not good. Not dreadfully bad, but definitely not good. Flavor was on par with an instant spice packet.

My husband liked this better than I did. We both liked the biscuits, but I found the turkey mixture too sweet for a savory dish. Maybe I accidentally used too much molasses? If I make this again, I'll halve the molasses and double the cayenne. Wasn't spicy at all.

I made this for my husband and two 12 year olds. I was afraid the girls wouldn't like them because they didn't come from the can. There were rave reviews all around Even the bisquits were a big hit. The girls did say they would like hb buns now and then too. I loved this recipe..a fast food favorite that I could enjoy too.

In my husband's opinion (and mine), this sets the standard for sloppy joes. He loves the combination of sweet and spicy from the turkey, and savory from the biscuits. He pronounced it the "gourment version," before he knew it actually came from Gourmet magazine. I liked the fact that once I got the turkey mixture cooking, I could make and bake the biscuits, and everything was finished at the same time.
