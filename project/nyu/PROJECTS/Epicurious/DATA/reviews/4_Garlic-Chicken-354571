This dish was so savory and delicious that I think about, and crave it. So, I will make it again tonight. I made it on the stove top with a slightly different method and one substitute. I only had about a tbsp. of sherry left so used that and unspiced rum to make up the 1/2 cup. I used 6 large garlic cloves and sliced them 1/8" thick then sauteed them in the oo until golden. Removed the garlic from the pan and browned the wings. Drained the fat from the pan, added the garlic and the rest of the ingredients and continued on with the pan variation. Served with halved acorn squash sprinkled with salt and cinnamon, and broccoli roasted in a small covered baking dish with a bit of chicken broth, oo and salt until very tender. My husband and I didn't come up for air - it was so good.

This is the second time I have made this and it tastes just the way it does in Spain. I use enough oil not necessarily way the recipe states and good Spanish pimenton to marinate the chicken. Brown the chicken as directed and put in all the garlic as smashed cloves when turning the chicken. Add the liquid and let simmer on the stovetop until only a couple of TB remain and the meat is glazed. The garlic will be soft and the chicken luscious.

This was a big hit, and I'll definitely be making it again. The only change I'd make is to reduce the amount of oil - the sauce definitely didn't need 1/3 cup. I also added red potatoes (quartered and unpeeled) into the baking pan and roasted them in the sauce with the chicken. They came out great!

Very tasty. I left the smashed garlic in the pan and continued with the recipe. We fished the soft cloves out at the table and smeared them on bread. Delish!

Loved it! Could put that sauce on anything. The only thing i did wrong was I couldn't believe a spanish recipe could ask you to take off the skin, so I didn't. But they were right.

The flavors were great. I used smoked paprika. When I make it again I will cut the oil way back; it was oilier than necessary.

Had a tapas themed recipe exchange last week and I made this dish. Definitely a winner! I served it with saffron rice. Very easy to make - I wouldn't change a thing. I picked up smoked paprika by mistake and it gave it a wonderful flavor.

made this for dinner for the family and I thought it was going to be kind of bland but it turned out really flavorful and moist.

Lovely, subtle, and flavorful. Be sure to use Spanish smoked paprika (pimenton) and feel free to be liberal with the garlic! Choose a nice sherry, one you wouldn't mind drinking. Standard cooking sherry would be a disaster. I'm looking forward to making variations on this lovely dish.

This was quite good, I simply cooked it on the stove and cut a bunch of steps: basically, I browned the chicken on high heat (adding in the garlic halfway through), then added the rest and set to simmer for 20 mins. I also didn't have any sherry so I used apple juice the second time I made it and while the complexity of flavor wasn't there, it still tasted good :)

I made this exactly as written - the sauce all evaporated in the oven and surprisingly it seemed not garlicky enough. Of course in my house the phrase 'too much garlic' is considered incomprehensible. I will try again but next time will double both the sauce and the garlic. Is the pan supposed to be covered? I read the recipe over several times and didn't see that in the instructions.

Made this X 3 and it scaled beautifully. ESSENTIAL step is to marinate in Spanish pimenton,salt and pepper in fridge overnight as suggested. Flavors penetrate and you will achieve the desired result. I cooked it all stovetop, wish I had not reduced the sauce so much as it was much requested even though chicken was not dry. Served with the Saffron Rice Pilaf and it was visual and gustatory knock-out. The flavors will linger long in memory.

Fantastic and fun. I am going to replace the chicken with the quail I hunted this past weekend and it should come out exotic as it is tasteful.

This was really good. Based on the other reviewers, I used lots of paprika, salt and pepper on the chicken thighs and they were very flavorful. I followed the recipe for cooking on the stove top and it worked great - cooked in 20 minutes. I did use less oil, more like a 1/4 C than a 1/3 and was glad this was not a problem. I will make this again.

This was surprisingly tasteless. The house smelled fantastic, the sauce was tasty over rice, but the chicken didn't seem to absorb any of the flavor.

I added fingerling potatoes to the dish just before baking to make it a bit bigger meal. I am so glad I added them! Delicious!

Fantastic recipe. Made it x 5 for a tapas new year's eve party. Used a mix of sherry and white wine (found out did not have enough sherry in hand!). Made ahead in the morning, baking it only 10 minutes. Finished it off for another 20 minutes before serving. Great reviews from all foodies. Make sure to season the chicken well as you cook it.

I also made this X4. I did not have any Sherry in the house...so I used Marsala. I also added some chopped shallots and red pepper flakes. Delicious!

Very yummy! I made with chicken breasts - and they did not dry out. I made a half batch, so the sauce evaporated more than I would have liked in the pan. Next time I make, I will either double the sauce or put into a smaller pan when moving to the oven to retain a little sauce. I always like a little extra sauce with the rice :)

I guess this wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't good. The sherry comes across very strong and is not even nearly offset by the other flavors.

Our small family gathers every Sunday for food and fellowship, and I search epicurious for inspiration. This was featured under New Recipes. I had never tried an unreviewed recipe before, but this sounded so good. I made it times 4, with 16 thighs (skinned, but not deboned), 24 garlic cloves, crushed, plus 12 cloves, minced! Naturally, I had to use 2 large pans and 2 baking dishes. I also used both sweet and smoked paprika. I only had 1 c. of sherry left, so I also added 1 c.of red table wine. It was so moist and delicious! Everyone loved it. Next time I will use even more smoked paprika and some red pepper flakes. I highly recommend!!!
