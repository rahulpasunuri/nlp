Though everyone seems to favor curry flavored deviled eggs, this is a nice alternative.

Easy, delicious recipe. This was a crowd-pleaser at Easter brunch and they went quickly. Some additional notes: I was using a very sharp Dijon mustard, so I cut down on the vinegar, by almost half. Turned out great. Also, I felt the chopped scallion and tarragon didn't end up adding that much overall. I would actually skip them next time, or else only add a bit in the actual mix rather than in the bottom of each egg cup. Highly recommend if you're looking for a standard deviled egg recipe.

I made these for a company picnic and they were such a hit I didn't even get to have one myself! I followed the recipe as written. A must have for my "keepers list" of summer foods.

These were good, although not all that different. However, I took the advice of others and reduced the tarragon, so that might be why it didn't stand out as different.

I just made these for Superbowl Sunday. Hubby wanted deviled eggs and these were a huge hit. I didn't have Hellman's but used Duke's sandwich spread instead and it worked out fine. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and put the mixture in my mini food processor for a smoother texture and then piped through a Zip Loc bag. I will definitely make these again!

I only had six eggs, so I added the remaining ingredients without measuring, but yum! This was definitely a keeper. I used dried instead of fresh tarragon, but it was still very good.

There are few foods I love as much as Deviled Eggs, and these are a great example. I really liked the tartness that the vinegar gave and the scallions and tarragon under the filling is a nice surprise. I do find that fork-mashing isn't enough to obtain the smooth texture I prefer, so I usually use either the mini food processor or the emulsion blender. I've also made these topped with a sprinkle of crumbled bacon - excellent!

I really liked these. I used dried tarragon and enjoyed the vinegar...it added a nice tartnedd that was delicious. A pinch of sugar would have been a good addition.

I live in the South and usually make Deviled Eggs by tossing in what I have. Interesting these "Southern" eggs don't have pickle relish (which I don't like). I skipped the vinegar and used shallots instead of onions and dried tarragon. My Southern friends devoured them, declared them the best they had ever had. Can't beat those kinds of reviews!

liked this recipe but would omit the vinegar next time. i found them to be too tart and i had to add some sugar to make them acceptable to bring to the party. without the vinegar, i think it would be a great recipe.
