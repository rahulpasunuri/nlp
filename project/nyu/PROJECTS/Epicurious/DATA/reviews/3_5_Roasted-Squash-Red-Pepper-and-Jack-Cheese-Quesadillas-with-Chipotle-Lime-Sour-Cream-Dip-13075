Love this! So tasty and unique. The chipotle lime sour cream has become a household staple.

I make this recipe multiple times a winter. It is fantastic and a great way to have quesadillas without too much cheese.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times and it always turns out great. It does take awhile to peel and dice the squash but it makes so much I don't mind. I use pepper jack cheese, chipotle tortillas, 2 or 3 cloves of garlic and one onion. I coat everything in olive oil for roasting and make sure everything is good and carmelized before calling it done. The flavor comes from carmelizing the veggies so it's important to cut the squash up like the recipe says - 3/4 inch dices. I haven't tried chicken in them but it sounds great to put some sliced grilled chicken in them.

I was VERY let down by this recipe. People give out the 4 star rating WAY too often. Some salt and some heat within the quesadilla might help

not sure what i might have done differently/wrong, but although this was tasty, it was really pain to eat since the filling simply oozed out of the sides.

Excellent recipe!! I increased the garlic, and then roasted everything, including the red pepper. Terrific.

Great. The squash took a while to prepare, but the result was a sweet and more complex quesadilla than the traditional cheese-based variety. I made the same mistake as other people with the chipotles (I only figured out I needed 2 chiles, and not 2 cans of chiles, at the last second), but the dip was great and I ended up with a lot left over. Come to think of it, the squash puree and the chipotle dip would probably make a great dish on their own without the tortillas and cheese.

It's pretty good with the addition of grilled chicken in the quesadilla. It contributes to the texture and the taste.

I'm 17 and managed to make this recipe quite easily. Although it is labour intensive, I thought that it was a very good dish. Instead of serving it as a side dish, I chose to serve it as a main dish. I doubled the recipe, and it turned out perfectly to make 8 quesadillas. perfect for a 4 person family. I made only one other change, which was to add sliced jalapeno peppers to the quesadillas. It made it have a more "mexican" flavour, so it worked out perfectly.

I'm giving this one fork to be faithful to the rating criterion - one being "just so-so." I didn't think it was terrible, but I was surprised to find it so blah after seeing the great reviews. I followed others' suggestions about roasting the squash after cutting it in half, along with the garlic, onion, and red pepper. I then tried mashing the first three of those with a potato masher, but you can't mash slices of roasted onion into squash, so I transferred it all in batches to my mini-chopper. More effort than it's worth, but if you have a proper food processor maybe it wouldn't be. In the end I found the squash mash to be fairly uninteresting, and there was something about the combined texture of the tortillas, squash mash, and melted cheese that I found unappealing. It could have seriously used some contrasting texture - maybe that's why the recipe suggests using the peppers raw. All in all, I expected this to be more interesting and to have more flavor. Next time I think I would use sauteed summer squash instead of roasted winter squash in a dish like this.

This dish is just fabulous! I have made it for multiple parties and get togethers, and everyone has loved it. It was very labor intensive until I read the other reviews and started roasting the squash and scooping it out rather than cutting it. Makes SUCH a difference!

Rating: 4
These were amazing! Chose to roast the bell peppers and leave in small dice pieces (after peeling and seeding) and triple the amount of garlic -- very tasty! Used Queso Peregrina which has sort of a mozzarella stringiness and is a fabulous melting cheese and Mexican crema (not as sour as sour cream). Only ended up using about half the butter -- didn't seem to need more for cooking the quesadillas. Highly recommended!

Rating: 3
It's really worthwhile to use the other's reviewers' suggestions when making this; or else the end result isn't worth the time involved. As others suggested, I halved the squash and roasted it in the oven for 35 minutes. I roasted the onion, 3 garlic cloves and red pepper slices in a dry cast iton skillet over low-medium heat for 30-45 minutes (I LOVED this technique on the veggies). I also added roasted fresh corn kernels, and hand mashed the mixture with a potato masher. The chipotle sour cream is perfect with the flavors in this dish.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful! I would definitely make it again. I was a bit hesitant about the squash/onion puree, but the flavors went so well together! I misread the recipe and added an entire can of chipotle chilies instead of one...was wondering why no one else mentioned the insanely spicy dip. :) But the dish was still delicious, and easy to make...ate leftovers for lunch the next day and it was just as good. I would add that we roasted the squash, etc. for 10 minutes longer than the recipe said...

Rating: 3
Excellent. I made the mistake of using an entire 8 oz. of jack cheese for all 4, it doesn't need it because the squash/garlic/onion puree is so delicious. Used poblano instead of chipolte, my guests loved it.

I'm glad (as usual) that I read all the previous reviews! Don't bother peeling and cubing fresh squash. Split in half, deseed, and roast in the oven, then scoop out the flesh. While the squash is in the oven, roast thick slices of the onion (peeled) and the garlic (unpeeled) in a dry cast-iron skillet over low heat, like they would in Mexico. Skip the oil drizzle in this dish. A good melting cheese, such as chihuahua, will supply you with plenty of oil. I added minced, fresh serrano chile to the cheese, as a complement to the chipotle. I roasted a red pepper and a poblano chile over an open flame, let cool, then skinned and chopped them. MASH BY HAND, skip the food processor. I used 8" diameter tortillas, and only spread the mixture to within 3/4" of the sides. It will indeed spread once heated. Cook over MEDIUM-LOW HEAT for three minutes/side. Butter added a nice crispness. Try to use key limes for the dip. Brown the quesadilla cheese side-down first. Upon melting, it will act like a glue and will make the thing easier to flip. I topped each finished 1/6th wedge with a slice of avocado and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro.

To cut down on prep time, I roasted the squash whole & then just scooped out the flesh with a spoon. I roasted the peppers in olive oil and cut them into strips instead of adding to the puree. Delicious! I have made this several times--the sour cream dip really makes the dish!

Rating: 2
Maybe I messed up (Is it 3/4 lb squash, or 5 cups? 'Cause 3/4 lb is only 2 cups!) Anyway, I used 5 cups. Agree the squash would make a great ravioli filling. Thought the quesadillas were ok, but not worth the trouble of peeling that squash! BUT the chipotle lime sour cream is fantastic; will use that many times again!

These are wonderful!!! The second time I made these, I mashed the squash and the garlic with a fork so it wasn't like baby food squash (also didn't ooze out the sides so much), spread on the tortilla and sprinkled the roasted onions and peppers over the squash. You could taste the roasted onions more and they were delicious. Definitely roast the peppers with the other veggies, and who ever heard of using only one close of garlic. Go with 5-6. They're roasted and mild. Also roasted two onions.

I have made this dish on occasion for the past 5 years..it's one of those everyone loves it, then you forget it for a while, then you uncover again. It's fabulous as is. I could agree with roasting the peppers but I don't feel the need and neither have my guests!

Really tasty and easy to make. Grill the veggies in advance to save prep time. I'll certainly make it again!

I couldn't make these fast enough, as people were gobbling them up. Not just a great appetizer, but a terrific light luncheon dish with a salad. Like other reviewers, I roasted the peppers along with the squash, added more garlic, and used 1/2 pepper jack, 1/2 jack cheese. Very easy, and so good.

I have made twice and it was a hit each time. I added roasted pasilla (poblano) chiles with the roasted bell peppers. Fresh tortillas make a difference and don't dollop too much filling on each--it can get messy.

Absolutely wonderful . . . and since there are only two of us, had leftover squash which made an incredible ravioli filling (cooked the ravioli and dressed with a sage butter sauce). A realy keeper!

These are so yummy. I made them yesterday for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. A couple of suggestions - roast the sqash about 10 minutes longer. Roast the red peppers with the squash. The dip is so great - I bet it would be great with chips or even as a sauce for grilled chicken or beef.

I rarely make anything over and over. This recipe is the exception. I've been making this since it first appeared in 1995. It has always been a winner with all types of groups. I just realized that I cut out the red bell pepper it doesn't go with the texture of the dish. I throw in about 6 garlic cloves half way through roasting and I roast the squash and onions till they are looking leathery. I always make it the day before so any roasted pieces rehydrate after pureeing. This is a huge hit and the chipotle sour cream makes the whole thing. This holiday season I'm going to try serving the puree as a side dish it's low in fat and high in flavor very yummy.

I have been wanting to try this recipe for months now, and for my last menu I decided that I would try making the squash and jack cheese quesadillas. Let me tell you, fellow chefs, this is a winner! Not only is it fast and delicious, but it is healthy too. My parents were over for dinner and I cooked up and pureed the vegetables while we were talking and my husband cooked the quesadillas (he's better at getting the heat even on the tortillas than I am). We ate them as they came off the griddle! The whole family raved at the taste treat. We ate them without the dip and they were fantastic. Not too dry and not too squishy. A few suggestions: Roast the butternut squash, red bell pepper, onions and garlic all in the same pan (with a light drizzle of oil - I used olive). I roasted everything at 400 degrees for a half hour then dumped them into my food processor. Don't puree the mixture too long. It helps to have chunks to make everything stick together and stick to the tortillas. If you are concerned about the garlic not being pureed enough, remove it before or after the pureeing process (I removed it after) so that your guests/family won't be surprised by a large bite of garlic. Instead of coating the tortillas with butter, try non-stick cooking spray (butter flavored) to cut calories and fat.

This was OK. Thought the quesadilla was kind of soggy & did microwave the red pepper to remove moisture as one cook suggested. I may roast them with the squash & onions next time.

Rating: 4
Very tasty dish. However, I would leave the squash a little chunkier than suggested, as it tended to squish out the sides when you cut or bite into the Quesadilla.

i serve this dish at every dinner party, and always get a great response. i use a great old cast iron pan and they get evenly crisp. you know the dish that guests always request a recipe for at the end of the night? this is it.

Great recipe, a huge hit with my guests. I used only 3 of the chipotle peppers in the dip and it was still very hot and spicy. Use caution when spreading the squash mixture, less is more. I also roasted the red pepper when I was roasting the squash.

My guests loved this dish. I served it as a main course with salad and received rave reviews. I made one variation: I mashed the roasted squash, onions and garlic rather than pureeing because I don't have a food processor (gasp!). It still turned out great.

Fantastic! I originally had a dish almost identical to this at Ferrari-Carano Winery paired with a Fume Blanc and it was great. Next time I will use a little less squash puree in each quesadilla. Rave reviews!

My only hesitation was about putting in raw peppers - thought they might be watery and a bit too hard. I popped them in the microwave for a couple of minutes, which softened them up a bit and took out some of the water. Seemed to work. Might roast them next time. Also doubled the garlic. Recipe received rave reviews at a potluck dinner. Very unusual, very tasty.

Being from Texas, I have had numerous types of quesadillias, but never befor squash. These were excellent and very different from the normal chicken or beef. The kids really enjoyed them too. All of the ingrediants are available at any of our normal markets.

Fabulous! Only problem was finding the very specific "chipote chilis in adobo" ....and I live in Manhattan. It was still good using jalapeno relish and a few dashes of adobo.

I have made this for several parties -- people always rave about it. Although not very complicated, the tastes are terrific and, to most people, unusual. I roast the red peppers so that they're soft and the same texture as the pureed squash.

This is a fantastic hors d'oeuvre. I usually add a little bit more of the adobo sauce from the chiles to the sour cream dip.

This was lovely. Nobody knew it had squash in it. They thought it was cheese! The chipolte sauce was excellent. I used the leftover sauce as a dip for blue corn tortilla chips. WOW!!! Not your ordinary appetizer.
