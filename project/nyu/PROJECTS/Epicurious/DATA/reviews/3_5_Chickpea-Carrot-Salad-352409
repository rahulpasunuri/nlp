That would be 'garlic' salt. Sorry.

I followed the directions precisely and found this very, very bland. Tried to liven it with more salt, pepper, extra lemon and lime juice, farlic salt, even some Sirraca sauce. Still blah. What a bummer.

Basic, simple, easy. And yes, I did follow directions. Used it as a first course at Easter, with a little pita.

This is a fabulous recipe I served with brunch . My family loved it. I doubled the recipe but still reduced some of the ingredients. For me, a couple tablespoons of rice bran oil was fine. I also used half the onion and left out the garlic. This was delicious and light. We ate them with bagels.

This is yummy!! I skipped the onions and used apple cider vinegar. We enjoyed it with warmed pita bread... couldn't get enough!!

Simply outstanding. I substituted red wine for apple cider vinegar, and lime for lemon juice and think it has a lot more good taste to it. Also cooked the garbanzos in pressure cooker with a little oil and they are so tender and much better than stovetop cooked. This is the 2nd time I've made these and the secret is--of course--to use good quality ingredients and a very good olive oil.

Made a few changes according to ingredients I could find: 1) Used sliced cucumber and black olive in place of carrot for a cool feeling in summer. 2) Used paprica, marjoram and rock salt for seasoning. 3) Used coriender in place of parsley. 4) Used balsamic vineger instead of red win. 5) Got rid of the oil. 6) Doubled the roasted garlic. The effect was awsome. As I openned the box in my office, the salad was robbed away in an instance. I could have only a few bytes. Would make it again.

surprisingly delicious for such a simple recipe! I only soaked the chickpeas for 6 hours or so, and they were still ready after an hour of simmering. also, I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand, was going to substitute balsamic, but decided I liked it as is. 1/2 onion, no garlic, another pinch of cayenne after draining. everyone at my party liked it. the parsley is great.
