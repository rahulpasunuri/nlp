I have made this recipe for years and passed it on to many. I usually do not deviate from the recipe except for low sodium Soy Sauce to reduce the saltiness and I use Meyers Rum. I have used chops but find it works well with a boneless pork loin roast. After marinading I put the roast on my Weber rotissiere for an hour basting 2- 4 times with the marinade. The results are beautiful with the roast having a tasty blackened sweet char. Also in my area Apple Jelly is readily available. I use fresh apple cider when in season at local farm markets.

This is my family's favorite pork chop recipe. I've also used it on pork tenderloin and it's just as good. I have trouble finding apple jelly so I use All Fruit peach. I prefer to use that because it doesn't have any added sugar, and the resulting sauce isn't sickly sweet like it can be with regular jam. Pour the marinade into a pot and start reducing it at least an hour before you plan on putting the chops on the grill. It takes a while to reduce but it's worth the wait.

Ok so I totally bastardized this recipe. But if you are looking for a variation, this could be it! I didn't have apple anything so I used orange juice and orange marmalade and it turned out great. The marinade was a little sweet for my taste but a real hit with the kids. I will cut back on the sweetness next time but this recipe is a keeper!

The marinate was surprisingly tasty. I tried apple butter for this one. The chops had that country fair taste to them. Cracker Barrel should offer this on there menu ... lol

I love this recipe. I never seem to have the apple jelly, so I use apricot jam alot. Tonight I had neither, but had and used raspberry jam. Everybody loves the sauce with whatever jam I use! My chops took less time to grill than the 20 minutes stated, but then my chops were not as thick as what was called for...just be careful not to overcook!

I took used this marinade for some pork chops at work and they were a hit. I had to add corn starch to the sauce to get it to thicken though.

Excellent - I've used this recipe twice for dinner guests and it was a hit both times. I used thicker chops from Costco and was careful not to overcook. Result, juicy, tender and tasty. Sauce took hours to reduce but well worth the effort

the marinade was fabulous, but take note that it takes a bit of time to boil down the marinade- otherwise, well worth it.

Super recipe! I added jerk seasoning to several of the chops, which really spiced them up.

I made this recipe with pork tenderloin. For some bizarre reason, apple jelly is hard to find in San Diego, so I used plum jelly. I had to strain the marinade before boiling it down. Guests loved it & asked for the recipe!

This was okay. I might make it again to use up the rest of the apple jelly.

This was a good recipie for the grill. My family thought the chops had a lot of flavor. I would also use the marinade for chicken also.

How we doin today ladies and gentlemen? This recipe ain't BAD, but it is a funny concoction. I didn't have any apple juice on hand but did have peach (nectar) juice! Too funny. So I figured I'd hit the store the next day and look for some "peach jellie jam." Hehehe, it tasted very good. I'd say you could use just about any type of fruit juice to put some of your own influence into the recipe. Only thing, I got no one to share my 11 other chops with! Leftovers big time. Happy cooking.

This recipe was wonderful, espiecally if you marinate it longer than 24 hours. The glaze is hard to resist.

I found this recipe to be quite good. I'd actually give it 2 1/2 forks. The chops were very tender and the glaze was tasty. I found it to be a little salty, though. But my 10 guests all enjoyed them. I would take steps to reduce the saltiness when I make it again....Oh, and watch so the sauce doesn't boil over!

I made this as a marinade for pork kebobs (boneless pork roast about 2 1/2 pounds cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes) It was great! I accidently dumped the pan of glaze off the stove while making it, so there was no glaze on the pork but what was left in the plastic bag in which I marinaded the meat. It was still delicious. I had no leftovers

Both my picky husband and son who are not pork chop fans just love this recipe. The chops were tender and the marinate was very good. I served it Asian style with plain rice, watercress soup and stir fried french cut green beans with oyster sauce. Excellent recipe.
