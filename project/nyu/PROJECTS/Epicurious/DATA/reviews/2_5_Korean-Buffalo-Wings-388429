Agreed this is not Korean fried chicken. For an authentic and exceptionally good recipe, go to http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Korean-Fried-Chicken This recipe produces the same result as my Korean neighbors serve.

I made these for tonight's Super Bowl party for the first time and they were a hit! They did take some effort with double frying but they were cooked to perfection and the sauce was a delicious combination of heat and sweet and sour, reminiscent of Thai dipping sauce. This will be my new staple dish to bring to potluck parties.

Korean wings, known as Bon Chon chicken, are amazing! This recipe is NOT it. I'm not sure I can post a link here but if you Google "Bon Chon Chicken recipe" you'll get a TON of hits. There are You Tube videos, blogs, etc. with the recipe. The key is to fry them twice and dust them with corn starch or rice flour before the second frying. That makes them uber crispy.

These are okay but nothing special. Certainly not worth the effort of double frying. My wife and I decided we prefer regular wings. The recipe is in the trash.
