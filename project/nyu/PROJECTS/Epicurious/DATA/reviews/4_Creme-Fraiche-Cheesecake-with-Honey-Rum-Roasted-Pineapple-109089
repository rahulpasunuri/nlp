This is a wonderful recipe. I've made it numerous times and it never fails to please. I skip the topping. Tried it once and was underwhelmed. the pineapple never caramelized for me.

I made this for a dinner party I was invited to and everyone loved it. I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche and made a shortbread crust instead of graham cracker. Really good. Two of the guests were lactose intolerant, and only asked for a "sliver", but they each came back for the "rest of their piece". This cheesecake was the best I have ever made, and will make it again. So creamy and delicious. I will not make the topping, however, as it did nothing for the cheesecake itself. Too sweet, cloying and time consuming. Thank goodness I served the pinapple topping on the side.

I made this for the 4 mothers in my family for Mother's Day. This was a delightful, creamy cheesecake. I did make the pineapple topping, but substituted amaretto for the rum, also doubling the amount of liquor. The smooth and rich cheesecake went together great with the tangy sweetness of the pineapple. I also served the pinapple on the side, in case not everyone wanted it on top. (The cheesecake alone is delicious!) Everyone said that this was one of the best cheesecakes they've ever had!

This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made. My dad and I made it for thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I made the crust out of nilla wafers and macadamia nuts. I couldn't find any Creme Fraiche at the store, so I used sour cream instead. This cheesecake is great without the topping, but it's good with the topping, too!

I made this cheese cake the other night. It was for a group of people who are very picky. There was not one person who wasn't raving about it. I didn't make the pineapple topping I didn't feel the need to add to the cheesecake. It was good and it didn't need any topping.

I Attend Center for Culinary Arts, and we tried this cheesecake, it is really good, one comment on the topping, is to double the liquid and not the pineapple, because when you roast them the liquid evaporates and you won't have enough to pour over the cheesecake.

the cheesecake itself is absolutely delicious! light, tender it's quite incredible and refreshing. use the creme frache it makes a huge difference! also i felt that 12 mins was too long to bake the crust, i'd try 8 or less the next time. the topping, however, i didn't care for - what a perfect waste of a fresh pineapple that ends up tasting like it came from the can anyway. "cloying" indeed, is the appropriate term that i read in another cook's review.

The cheesecake was awesome and we all liked the pinapple. I used organic canned rings and roasted them as directed with half the syrup. It was very yummy.

I really love this cheesecake and it always gets raves -- but I have a couple of modifications. I "ice" or "frost" the top with a thin layer of sour cream (I use whole sour cream, not creme fraiche for this and in the main recipe)...and instead of the pineapple, I make a respberry sauce that I drizzle on top. (Just blend frozen raspberries in Cuisinart with heavy cream to make the sauce.) I garnish with fresh raspberries and mint leaves and it looks as gorgeous as it tastes!

This was the first cheesecake I've ever made, and it was soooo good, light and creamy. Had to use sour cream as no creme fraiche availabe. However, the pineapple topping was a lot of effort for mediocre results.

I made this for a customer who isn't normally keen on Cheesecake. Not only did all of her guests 'rave' about it, but she herself said it was absolutely delicious! It was light and creamy, and the pineapple topping was perfect with it. I used Whole Sour Cream, and I allowed the cake to sit 'out' for several hours before serving it, so that it was at room temp, and therefore softer. I also used concentrated pure mexican vanilla instead of the beans, and allowed th ejuices to almost entirely evaporate in the oven with the pineapple slices. I love cheesecake myself, and it is definitely one of the best I have come across!

I Have made it twice family and friends loved it. I could not find Creme Fresh I used sour cream. I have been giving the recipe to friends.

Fabulous cheesecake. Having read the reviews, I decided to skip the topping. Wow!!!I am so glad I did: the cake was light and flavorful. Make sure to use the best vanilla beans you can get and to make it ahead: the texture will be just right for cutting into it when it cools. Once the berries are in season I will try a "coulis" recipe.

I finally tried this recipe and my husband said it was the best he had ever tasted! He loves pineapple and the topping came out perfectly browned and glazed though it took a bit less time than called for. After reading some of the other reviews I wonder what I did "wrong"!!

This recipe sounded great and looked great. Followed the recipe to the dot and the cake although creamy did not come out anywhere like the picture. It came out looking shorter and the topping was runny, although good, there are better recipes out there

I made two of these for a recent party. Interestingly, the market only had one package of creme fraiche left, so I made one with creme fraiche and the other with sour cream. Interestingly, the creme fraiche one disappeared, while the sour cream one did not fair as well (it had a bit of a sour taste...for obvious reasons). I had a little trouble getting the pineapple topping right, but it tasted fine. Nothing to rave about though. My guests gave the pineapple mixed reviews as well. I'm mixed as to whether I will make this again. The pumpkin cheesecake that I made last month got a much better response.

I was time-strapped, so i used a ready graham crakers crust (the largest i found), and one and a half cans of sliced pineapple in its juice. I broiled the pineapple until it got brown, and I made the syrup on the stove using the pineapple juice instead of water. i let the syrup thinken on the stove. I used spiced dark rhum, and added a tablespoon to the cold sauce. Oh, and my final tip was to use chestnut honey (dark and aromatic) from Italy. It made a huge difference. The cheesecake was a big hit. The sauce is dense and flavorful, so add only a couple of tablespoons per slice of cake. Otherwise, it may be cloying. Will definitely make it again. With canned pineapple and ready crust, it's not that much work.

Made this recipe for a dinner party. The cheesecake was wonderful. The pineapple topping, however was disappointing. I followed all of the instructions exactly, but the time consuming process did not yield a worthwhile result. Luckily, I also made a raspberry sauce (found on this website - thawed frozen unsweeted raspberries, sugar and lemon) and added Amaretto. The result of combining the cheesecake and the spiked raspberry sauce were amazing! Make the cheesecake, but prepare a different sauce to go with it...much easier and very tasty.

At least four people at a party raved that this was the best cheesecake they had ever had. However, it is not picture-perfect. The oozing sauce in the photo carmelized to nothing in my oven. Although the pineapple was flavorful and the cheesecake is definitely worth making again, it was not a showpiece stopper such as your "Pistachio Brittle Cheescake".

The best I and the other 8 people around my table have ever had. I skipped the pineapple glaze and just cut it up fresh and put it on the plate -- this is really easy and really, really, good. I forgot to get the creme fraiche at the market, so I substituted sour cream, and it work just fine.

I was lazy about the pineapple and I'm a fan up the flavor from upside down cake so I used sweetened crushed pineapple and brown sugar instead. The sauce wasn't outstanding but it did have some flavor.

I generally make the New York Cheesecake recipe from this site and everyone always loves it. But as a change I made this and was very, very pleased. The flavor from the vanilla beans and creme fraiche was great and the consistency just right -- creamy but not too soft. I was mixed about the pineapple topping -- we ended up eating it separate (it was delicious) but not on the cheesecake. I also had problems with the pineapple carmelizing. If you make the pineapple for the cheesecake definitely cut the pineapple smaller than one inch pieces.

Altogeher this dish was truly a show stopper, This dessert is lite enough to serve after a big dinner. Might I add a 1/4 teaspoon of freshly squezzed lemon juice; it gives this cheesecake the much needed zing that it is missing without the lemon juice.

This is a wonderful cheesecake recipe, nice and creamy, and easy to make. Though I did have trouble with the pineapple topping, when I cooked it in the oven all the rum sauce cooked away, but the pineapple was good.Yes I would surely make it again. Don't know what I would do for the sauce.

The cheesecake is good, in particular the crust. I didn't think much of the pineapple topping. It did not carmelized though I cooked it longer than the recipe called for. Friends and family did not think the sauce stood out either. I would make the cheesecake again and substitute a different topping.
