This dessert is outstanding... i have made this at least 12 times and have shared the recipe repeatedly. I have never made the chocolate sauce, as I feel it does not need it. A bit of whipped cream is nice. Have used vanilla extract several times instead of vanilla bean. Don't substitute with any apples or the whole thing will taste of the apples.

I have now made this recipe twice, and both times it was a complete success. I cooked the pears the night before I actually prepared the strudel, and they held up fine. Instead of using vanilla wafers in between the layers, I added chopped shortbread cookies. My guests truly enjoyed it and even took home some leftovers.

This was a good (but not great) recipe. I agree with a previous reviewer that this recipe is too labor intensive if you have any other complex dishes to prepare. Should have guessed; this recipe is a "Cooking Class" item. I used bittersweet Scharfenberger chocolate which was a nice contrast to the pears. Were I to make it again, would use more butter between the the phyllo sheets, particulary at the edges, and use salted butter. I know this is a "no no" in pastry making but the crust was a bit bland.

I made this recipe about five years ago for a dinner party, unfortunately I went home sick and was unable to taste it. The next day I heard rave reviews about the strudel. This Thanksgiving I dug out the recipe and tried it again, luckily I stayed healthy enough to enjoy a piece. Yum! It was delicious.

This was delicious, but it was quite a bit of work, particularly on top of a full day of cooking of other rather complex items for a dinner party. In the end, I think my guests would have appreciated the (wonderful) chocolate sauce along with some good quality ice cream just as much. I used a mixture of Swiss milk and dark chocolates and it turned out great.

I have been looking for this recipe on Epicurious.Com forever and today I thought I would try to find it once more and low an behold ther it was. This is an easy way to start working with phyllo, and incredibly awesome. I have made it at least 20 times since the recipe first appeared. There is never any left after dinner!!!!
