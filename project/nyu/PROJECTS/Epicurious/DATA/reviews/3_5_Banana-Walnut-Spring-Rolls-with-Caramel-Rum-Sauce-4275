This sounds complicated - it is not! I made the sauce the day before and found it simple. The morning of the party I made the rolls and stored them on a jelly roll pan in the refrigerator that had been sprayed with Pam then covered them with plastic wrap. As I was waiting for the oil to heat I decorated the plates to receive the rolls, this is when the guests started to gather and watch with great interest. I opted to omit the Chinese five-spice powder & powdered sugar and substituted a large strawberry injected with Grand Marnier. I received much praise during dessert and all the plates were clean. I will be doing this one again.

Won't rate b/c i made w/ egg roll wrappers. Also, used nutmeg, cardamom, black pepper & cinnamon instead of 5-spice powder w/o the toffee. Rolled bananas in a little sugar & coconut flakes before wrapping. Served with frozen pineapple, vanilla ice cream & honey.

I am abstaining from giving this a fork rating because like a fool I took a previous reviewer's suggestion to bake rather than fry the spring rolls. While the flavors were amazing, baking was not a palatable option. The oil-sprayed baked spring rolls were both tough and rubbery. Don't be duped into taking the suggestion to bake these. I served with coconut sorbet and the flavor combinations were delicious. I will make these again but will fry them according to the recipe. As others commented, the five-spice powder as a great addition.

This one is kind of tough to add as a dessert because you can't make the rolls too far in advance. After much planning and preparation, I was really disappointed with how bland the dessert turned out. Maybe I was expecting it to taste more carmally, but it tasted like a bannana wrapped in funnel. Not bad, but certainly not great either.

i had this one at a friends house first and i was inspired! now this is my old stand-by!it seems difficult as others were saying but i also agree it was a breeze, the sauce is beautiful, but that part can be tricky, just be patient-i once undercooked it and had to start over, but that did not discourage me one bit! always rave reviews and i am continuosly printing this recipe for my friends on their way out. i sometimes tend to forget the five-spice powder on occasion and it still tastes great! i serve this with a scoop of old fashioned vanilla bean ice cream and my guests love it!

It sounds difficult at first, but as soon as you get the hang of it, rolling up those ingredients in the spring roll is SUPER easy. I changed is the deep-frying part though, b/c I can't handle all that oil. For my second batch, I sprayed the rolls lightly w/ oil and baked them in the oven on a cookie shoot at approx. 400 degrees. I recommend about 20 minutes and turning them at the 10 minute mark so they don't become soggy. I felt much better eating them baked. This dish got rave reviews from everyone I served it to! Everyone wanted the recipe and no one could place the "secret ingredient" of Five-Spice powder till I told them. In my opinion, the Five Spice makes the dish. I actually sprinkled it on top quite liberally.

This was deliciousand so, so, so easy! I made it for our cooking club with outstanding results. Made the spring rolls early in the day and and reheated after dinner. Saved myself some calories and time by using Smuckers Fat Free caramel sauce. Didn't miss the effort, calories or taste. A def keeper in my recipe box.

I made these last night and took them to a friends house dessert. I couldn't find spring or egg roll wraps (our grocery store is on strike and has very little), but substituted phyllo dough. I used a couple sheets for each roll and the recipe was fantastic. Will definitely make again.

After all the fantastic reviews, I was disappointed. The sauce was very good, but the rolls, while making a great presentation, had only a so-so taste. I couldn't find spring roll wrappers, so I used egg roll wrappers, which may account for my disappointment. On the other hand, my guest thought they were great. if I ever find spring roll wrappers, I will try them again. As an alternative to this recipe, I would recommend the recipe for banana fritters found on this site. Not the same great presentation, but absolutely delicious.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit! I used egg roll wrappers because I couldn't find spring roll wrappers and it still turned out great. Before serving, I also sprinkled walnut and toffee bits in addition to the powdered sugar, five spice and caramel on top of the dessert. It was a beautiful presentation. Overall easy to make, too. Will make again!

Absolutely great! They were made early in the day and re-heated during dinner. Our wine club loved them.

Excellent. I risked it and fried them in the afternoon, refridgerated them and baked them several hours later for dessert. The were great, just as crispy as when I first took them from the oil. Who wants to deep fry at a dinner party?

Very good, very easy. I used egg roll wrappers on the first try--too chewy. Spring roll wrappers are a must; any asian market will carry them. My kids loved them too!!!

These were delicious, though a little hard to cut! I would add a little more of the filling next time. Served with vanilla ice cream, YUM, YUM.

My friends loved this at an asian dinner, following a lot of spicy delicious food. However, it was delicious enough that it could stand up to almost any menu. The recipe was much sought-after

I made this dessert last year for 8 and it was a big hit! Everyone loved the lightness of the spring roll wrapping and the sweet taste of the toffee bits and the bananas. The walnuts added a nice texture. I'm making it again for Thanksgiving this year!

I made this for a dinner with my friends. They were nicely surprised with the sweet filling and sauce. They expected a regular spring rolls but ended up asking for the recipe. The walnut give a nice crunch to it. I skipped the five-spiced powder entirely, and kicked up a notch on the rum!

I would try this recipe again, however I would add extra toffee bits and more powder sugar. Watch out for the 5 spice powder! It has a very distinctive taste. I would use only a dash of it next time.
