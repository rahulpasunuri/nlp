After reading the reviews I knew I wasn't going to fool around with all the silly steps for a cookie that would be good but probably not knock my socks off. I made the dough as directed and then formed it into a 1 1/2 inch log. I refrigerated the log for 2hrs and then just sliced them. That was much easier than rolling the dough out. Also I got impatient and only let them sit for 1 hr before baking. I wish they had offered the reason for the "sitting" in the recipe so it would make more sense to do it. Anyway they are crisp and tasty. The to my mind outrageous amount of cinnamon actually works. It was very good with Chai after a tandoori leg of lamb.

I would give them a 2 1/2 if that were an option. I was looking for a recipe for the speculas we had in Holland, and this wasn't it; but we thought they were very good anyway. I made half of the recipe but used the whole egg and didn't chill the dough at all. I rolled the dough out between two sheets of plastic wrap and had no problem with the dough cracking.

How in heaven's name did anyone roll out this dough?? Mine was far too crumbly to roll, so I squished the dough into little balls and flattened them with my fingers. I agree -- the cinammon was overpowering. Ugh.

I agree with the previous reviewer - why do they have to sit for 4 hours? I tried some just after I'd rolled them out, and some after the 4 hours, and couldn't tell a difference. Usually, I like cinnamon a lot, but this was way too much. Altogether, totally not worth the trouble.

This recipe didn't seem to make much sense to me. Why do the cookies have to sit for 4 hours before cooking them? But, my co-workers sure did like them. I told them they could make them if they wanted more.
