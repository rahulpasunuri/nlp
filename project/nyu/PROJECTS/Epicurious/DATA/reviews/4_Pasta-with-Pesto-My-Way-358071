This recipe was easy and delicious. I used purple potatoes and added cooked chicken. I also used store bought pesto sauce. It was a hit...I will definitely make again!

This is delicious & healthy! I ran out of cherry tomatoes so I threw in 1/2 cup of sundried tomatoes. And, I omitted the corn (just watched King Corn documentary)

Loved this dish! Also made with store bought pesto and left out the breadcrumbs (didn't miss them, either). Make sure you have enough water for the potatoes, zucc, beans, and corn, it really adds up. The tomatoes were a great addition.

I loved this recipe. The tomotoes are delicious and add to the dish, don't skip them! I left off the bread crumbs and didn't miss them. I used store bought pesto. Will make again for sure.
