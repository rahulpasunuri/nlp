The custards came out well -- nice ginger taste which was unique with the caramel sauce. However, the logistics of getting the chopped ginger out of the caramel sauce are a little hairy (and I had some little pieces of ginger stuck into the caramel sauce). Therefore, I would suggest to other cooks that they keep the pieces of ginger fairly large as straining caramel sauce would most likely result in a solidified candy strainer. Also, I actually preferred the custards cool rather than room temperature -- the flavors had a chance to blend and the texture improved greatly.
