The first time I make a recipe, I follow the directions, then I make notes as to what, if anything, I would change. I used jarred (in water) artichokes and measured about 10 oz and didn't put in celery salt. This was"good", but not great. So, next time I will increase the following ingredients: 1. Artichoke 2. Parmesan 3. Jalapeño (most likely) The consistency was great, we all just thought it needed a bigger "kick" of flavor.

I made this for a group of our friends. I was skeptical because I am use to the typical artichoke dip that uses mayo and sour cream. I was so excited how this recipe turned out! I used canned artichokes instead of frozen but otherwise followed the recipe as is. It was amazing! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. This is definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Huge hit! The naysayers are not following properly. Drain artichokes of water and it won't be watery... Use entire scallion including green part and it won't be bland.... This has TONS of flavor. Don't need Old Bay on top of celery salt etc. Taste as you go. Wonderful. Makes enough for 10-12. For dinner party app of 6-8, cut in HALF for sure.

I have memorized this recipe and have brought to many gatherings with friends and family. They always look forward to it. One thing that I do is put a table spoon of lemon zest in the mixture. It will intensify the lemon and mellow out the jalapeño. Awesome recipe!

basied on the reviews I read I too did some modifications I also cut the amount of bell pepper in half. I eliminated the celery salt, lemon juice and jalapenos. I added 1T garlic powder about 1/2 to 2/3 c of sherry and upped the cream to 1 1/2 cups half heavy cream and half, half&half I also used fresh dungeness for the crab and doubled the parmesan cheese and used the good imported parmesano regiano It was the hit of our family christmas

We thought the jalapenos definitely were needed, we used pickled artichokes versus frozen and added cherry. I wished I would not have used as much parmesan cheese. Definitely needed more flavor.

This turned out to be pretty bland. Used only 1/2 of a bell pepper. The recipe made quite a lot. Also I thought that it asked for too much crab meat.

Slightly confused on the amount of Parmesan to use? Ingredient list says 2 oz, 1/2 cup, while preparation states 1/3 cup? Which is it? And I would like to double amount as well! Thank you!

Not the outcome I really wanted for my precious crab meat which was pulled out of the Pacific Ocean yesterday, and hand-cracked by me today. The artichokes overwhelmed the delicate crab, and there was really not much other flavor. It needed more spices, some sherry, and maybe some cream cheese?

Rating: 3
Tasty and easy. I never use frozen artichokes when called for in a recipe and marinated ones are way too oily. I find them to have a tough texture. Canned artichokes are the only way to go. Agree with other reviewers that some old bay seasoning works great and sherry would be a good addition.

I made this dip last night, and it was AMAZING. Definately deserved four forks w/ a few slight modifications, thanks to the suggestions from other reviewers... - used a 10 oz jar of marinated artichokes, drained and rinsed thoroughly - only used 1/2 of a red bell pepper (mine was very large and once chopped, half of one appeared to be enough) - used 1/2 cup heavy cream with 3/4 cup half-and-half (same total volume) - doubled the parmesan - omit jalapeno, salt, and celery salt (used one heaping tsp of Old Bay instead!) Served it with seven grain loaf slices. Cannot wait to make this for my next party, so easy to make...don't be intimidated by the roux!

My husband and I made this for New Year's Eve and loved it. We omitted the bell pepper, added two cloves of garlic, two tsp of Old Bay and we topped it with cheddar cheese. Otherwise, we followed the recipe and will definitely make this again.

Given the time it took to make it and the high cost of the ingredients, I was dissappointed in the outcome. I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and Christmas Day snacking, and went back over the receipe today to see if I did anything wrong. It was too bland. If I made it again, I would try sherry and more spices.

I liked this, although everyone I served it to seemed to like it more than I did. I could not find frozen artichoke hearts, so I used ones that were jarred in brine (I think that artichoke hearts in oil and herbs would have overwhelmed the dish, as others have stated). I think this dish needs sherry, which I would include if I do the dish next time. The original recipe appeared on a menu with sherried shrimp, and I think that's why it wasn't included in this recipe, but I think it needs that extra depth. The benne toasts were great.

this isn't really that bad...artichokes are hard to "dress up". i added a bit of tabasco and some sour cream and good quality mayo. once the parmesan cheese melted, it really helped the flavor, so make sure you use a top quzlity parmesan here. i also used bay seasoning, and added fresh lump crab..would make this again with the changes.

Rating: 1
this recipe was just ok. I agreed with one reviewer that said that this looked like cat food. I did add Mexican blend shredded cheese on top which made it look and taste better. My husband did like this but wasn't crazy about it. I would just try something else. The artichokes were overpowering so that you hardly tasted the crab. I think that a shrimp crab combination for this would be much better or the old artichoke and spinach combo. Please don't get me wrong. Its not a bad dip its just that its not worth it for the expense of the crab. The crab is not highlighted at all and overpowered by the artichokes. I did use 1 can of artichoke hearts and 2 cans of crab meat so perhaps I didn't do justice to the dish.

Rating: 1
I did like this recipe and so did others at a party. However, no one raved about it or asked about the recipe. I thought that it was quite a bit of work and although I liked it I don't think its worth the effort. The only substitution I made is to use 2 finely chopped fresh jalapenos but I did sautee it first to remove some of the heat. It wasn't spicy to anyone. My husband thought that the recipe needed more cheese or some other flavor that the guests could identify more with.

This is the only crab dip that I make anymore, and I've tried lots over the years, originally being from Maryalnd! I can't believe some folks found this to be bland! The jalapenos liven it up without making it hot; use real crab meat for the best crab taste. This one is always a hit among guests.

Found this recipe when looking for a way to use some leftover King crab. Made a double batch and thought I'd try freezing the leftovers. Amazingly, the reheated version was just as good as when I made it fresh. My husband and kids also loved it. I had some leftover frozen chopped spinach and threw that in as well. Not sure if it affected the flavor, but provided a nice color contrast. It's a keeper.

I found this to be very bland as well. I added extra salt to taste before baking, which helped, but it still was very boring. A dash of tabasco made is somewhat tolerable. Perhaps some garlic or fresh herbs would be a good addition, but I would suggest just finding another recipe. I have a lot left over, so I think I might mix in some bread crumbs, garlic and fresh herbs and fry it up like crab cakes.

At the risk of sounding gross, this dip tasted bland and looked unappealing, like cat food. I tried adding extra lemon to give it some flavor, but it was just lacked flavor and looked like a bowl of "Fancy Feast" gourmet cat food. Here, kitty kitty.....!

We loved this! I omitted the bell pepper since we are not overly fond of it and added more salt, and it was delicious. While preparing the cream sauce, I really wondered if it was worth the effort--if mayonnaise and/or sour cream would serve the purpose. The cream sauce IS worth the effort--a very special combination of flavors. We will definitely have this again.

I have not made this yet but it looks interesting and I am going to try it. I would like to offer help to the cook from WA re: the roux. A roux is a combination of melted butter or hot oil, etc. and flour, it's usually 1 to 1 in measurements and it's cooked until smooth at least 2 minutes on med heat, constantly stirring, then you add any liquid stated in a recipe and wisk until it starts to bubble, thats when it reaches it's desired thickness and you can always add more liquid if it's too thick. Remember you can always add but you can't take away. Good Luck!

Made this for a crawfish boil last night and it not only got rave reviews but the dish was empty within thirty minutes of arrivng at the party. I used cream instead of half & half, a half cup of blended Italian cheeses, about 2 tbs of the diced jalapeños and the artichokes were left over from the Roasted Chicken with Artichokes and Gremolata Butter from the April, 2005 issue of Bon Appetit. I had doubled the amount in anticipation of making this recipe. This recipe goes to the top of the appetizer list in my house!!

Absolutely Divine! I modified this recipe a little: I didn't add the crab or celery salt (didn't have any on hand), I used fresh artichoke hearts, I used just a dab of finely minced jalapeno pepper (I'm kind of a spice wimp) instead of the recommended amount, and I served it with sliced french baguette. I made this for a potluck party and received rave reviews!! It is such a refreshing break from the party dip blahs!!!

How could anyone not like this dish? My husband begs me to make it at least once a month, and I always get requests for the recipe when I serve it to guests. I always add lots of extra cheese though and leave out the spinach (artichokes are enough flavor). We truly love this tasty dish.

I must say that my guests raved about this. I thought it still a little too spicy (but I'm not the overly spicy type). I too cut out the jalapeño chiles but added 1.25 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning. Also, for those concerned with the price for lump crab meat, BJ's/Costco sells Bluefin lump crab meat that was delicious and DID NOT need to be picked through..completely clean. Also, I used marinated artichoke hearts and rinsed them. I think it added a little extra flavor. All in all a very good dish and relatively uncomplicated, although next time I may stick with just 1 tsp of Old Bay.

Rating: 1
Entirely too bland and lacking in good flavor. The dominant flavors are parmesan and crab which, by themselves, do not combine particularly well. Rather than try to add/delete ingredients to improve it, the recipe needs to be completely reworked.

I added garlic and a small chopped onion as well as some red pepper flakes (I didn't have jalapeno). I kicked up the heat and added a little parmesan to the top at the end to get a nice browned top. I served this with toasted pita bread and slices of french bread. So good, that I caught my guests wiping up the sides of the dish with their bread.

Not a Bad Crab Dip. I did cut out the pickled jalapeño chiles. I used Artichoke "Quarters" not "hearts". I also topped with Mozzarella cheese, mixed with the parmesan. Add a little Old bay, about a tsp. In all a good dish to serve.

I basically followed the recipe as stated except, for example, where I felt there was way too much red pepper (the pepper I used was huge), or I thought less jajapena was better. I also used marinated artichoke hearts, thoroughly rinsed. The dish was not at all "loose" as some indicated. It was good, but I believe it could have been better had I cut back even more or eliminated altogether the peppers, onions and jalapenas, as they reduced the "crab taste." I served this with a peasant rye that was somewhat overpowering and definitely will use a milder blander bread the next time.

Rating: 4
Everyone Loved it! It was gone in no time! I use mild green chiles. Mixed in some shimp meat along with the crab meat. Also added a small amount of red/orange/yellow bell peppers for color. Made plenty, saved half in freezer for later date where another crowed loved it as well.

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was great...I used a jar of marinated artichoke hearts which I rinsed well, and only 1/2 lb crab. I also added lemon zest and probably 1/2 tea more lemon than the recipe called for. About the complaints of it being loose...I did end up cooking it longer but I didn't have a shallow casserole, which may have contributed. I also noticed that it firmed up a bit after it was out of the oven for a while, but there was still some liquid in the bottom. Maybe needs a thicker roux. The leftovers were great on toast points with scrambled eggs (seasoned to accompany).

Rating: 3
This was really good. I seasoned to taste throughout the process - if you only use the amt. of salt specified in the recipe it would be bland. I didn't think the lemon juice, celery salt, or minced chiles were necessary - they didn't seem to change the flavor much. I like the foundation of the recipe - you could mix it up a lot by using things other than artichokes and crab.

This tasted great, although I barely tasted the jalapenos. There was barely a hint of spice in the batch that I made. I used fake crab for price reasons and I'm sure that real crab is better, but the fake crab worked fine. Also, it says that it serves 8, but I think it serves 8 people who are mostly eating crab dip for dinner. I had 8 people over and we ate about a third of it. That was plenty for everyone to have a few dips. If I was serving 8, I would halve the recipe.

I actually made this as part of an assignment for a cooking class I was taking....for one of our friday parties where we had guests come....it went over great...I did add more jalapeno and salted and peppered it well...this weekend I am going to add add a package of chopped, drained spinach to the mix...and use that to stuff mushrooms for an appetizer for dinner for my boyfriend....in fact, my cooking class teacher called the other night (class ended 2 months ago) and she'd lost the recipe and wanted to make it again...it's a good recipe, and one that can easily be adjusted to personal taste....just remember, when cooking, tasiting is very important!

I'd say this dish is alright, but considering the cost of using lump crab ($10 per can, and you'll need 2-3 cans), I'm not sure it was worth it. Substituting White Crab would defray things a bit. I think next time I'll use more jalepeno -- I thought it needed more flavor.

Oh, my, this is good! I went the cheap route and used two cans of white crabmeat and it was fine. I just couldn't bring myself to spend $10.99 for 8 ounces of lump crabmeat. I made the recipe exactly except for two slight changes. I substituted 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper for the pickled jalapeno (I'm allergic) and added a generous splash of cooking sherry to the roux after I added the half & half. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. I served it with tortilla chips, but think I'll try the benne seed pita crisps next time. A definite keeper.
