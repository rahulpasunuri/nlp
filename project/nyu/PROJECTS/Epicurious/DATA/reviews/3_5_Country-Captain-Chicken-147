This was very good. Made it with dried cranberries instead of currants, also read the reviews and went with the reviewer who suggested toasted slivered almonds and (I believe?) green onions as a topping. I also used the coconut. Definitely plan on making this again.

Haven't tried the recipe yet, but noticed the nutrition info. BA says it has 25 g fat per serving. Actually, there are only about 25 grams of fat in the entire dish!

Pretty good. I'd like to give it 2.5 stars if possible. I had everything to make is and it was a good dinner but didn't knock my socks off.

Thought I'd take a shortcut and use this database, rather than dig out my old recipe, also from Bon Appetit, of this dish. I'm going back to the cover recipe from May 1984 because it was better. Even though I use Madras curry powder, instead of as directed making my own, I much prefer the use of gteen and red peppers, plus mango chutney instead of the apples used in this one. The 1984 one also has slivered almonds and chopped green onion as toppings. I've been making it for 20 years now with both whole chicken pieces and boneless breasts, and love it each way.

Awesome!!!We all loved it!

Spectacular, especially given how easy it is. I have made it several times and have found I like it best with a can of undrained diced tomatoes instead of the diced plum tomatoes. I serve it over couscous and it gets raves every time!

so upsetting after seeing all the reviews. The coconut rice was great, but everything else was just so bland. It was all just over powered by the curry

Rating: 4
A hit here! Took the cue from others and added more spice! I use Penzey spices so I used their Hot curry mix and "notched" it up with their Vindaloo curry. Worked for me. I did all of the toppings and served over Coconut flavored rice as suggested. I increased the sauce ingredients by half and had plenty for lunch the next day.

Overall a fine recipe, but a little doctoring could do a lot of good. Amping up the curry and making sure to use hot Madras curry is recommended. I also wouldn't suggest skipping the cilantro and coconut as I made the mistake of doing (only because it's Sunday and the stores are closed). I also added chopped fresh ginger and a chopped green chile. My end result still wasn't nearly as flavorful as I would have liked, but after thickening the sauce with some cornstarch and serving it with basmati rice (cooked with chx bouillion and garlic) it was decent. I'd like to make this again, but next time I'll be sure to add plenty of heat, maybe a little garam masala, and finish it with cilantro, coconut and plain yogurt on the side.

Even with only one chicken breast, and raisins, parsley, and red bells sub'd this was good. We poured it over boiled Yukon Golds instead of rice. My s.o. said it was delicious and helped himself to three servings. Score!

I was so surprised by how good this was considering how easy, quick, and lowfat it is. It tastes far more sophisticated than the individual ingredients. It was also even better as leftovers the next day. I added a bit extra curry, a little bit of crushed red pepper, canned tomatoes, a Fuji apple, and half breast meat, half (boneless, skinless) thight meat. Yum, yum. This will be a staple recipe in our house.

Rating: 3
A solid recipe as is and very adaptable to many tastes. I too added 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper and found the hot madras curry powder a must. Substituted a diced mango for the apple after reading Cook's Illustrated take on this recipe. I prefer almonds instead of coconut, but offer both as well as plain yogurt for those who need to temper the heat a bit.

This is terrific, and I am not a curry fan. This is so simple and quick and good. I just made this on the fly it to test the recipe, and used ancient curry powder, canned tomatoes, frozen chicken tenders from Trader Joe's, etc. and it was still terrific. I look forward to using better ingredients. I had no coconut, so I topped it with toasted almond slivers, which is used in other Indian recipes and they were a nice addition that I will probably keep even when I have coconut. Good healthy weekday dinner.

Take the time to read all the reviews (aka A.R.) They have a bunch of great ideas that will really allow this recipe to work for you. I haven't yet tried soaking the fruit in wine first, but . . . mmmm. Based on A.R., I substituted (golden)raisins for currants, plus dried cranberries (I like tarter tastes, however), and added extra curry plus cayenne (See A.R.) with great results. Dried apricots would probably also work well. I too thought the amount of chicken was a bit much for the rest of the recipe -- unless you want primarly rice and meat (which isn't bad, I just like more goodies), I'd either cut back on the chicken, or double the rest. Also, though to some this is second nature -- if you aren't used to cooking (as opposed to baking) with dried fruit -- it's worth the effort to go to a whole foods, or qualtiy bulk farmers market type store if you can for your dried fruit (the prices will be comparable, maybe less -- it doesn't have to be a "gourmet" market). The raisins, currants, whatever, will be of a different quality -- ie, "golden raisins" won't be uniform chewy little pills, but even after cooking, one might be smooth, dark gold, and the size of a pea, another might be lighter, wrinklier, but the size of a regular grape, and another might still have the nub visible where it was picked from the vine . . . gives the dish much more tooth, and visual interest (ie,rustic rather than Sunmaid out of the box), for very little effort.

This was a good dish. I made it as the recipe stated except for substituting raisins for currants. It was tasty but I felt the seasoning was quite subtle. It is probably worth seeking out some good quality curry powder to make the most of this recipe.

Rating: 3
In good faith, I give this a 3 star, assuming the toasted coconut I forgot to get at the store would have made a difference. I liked it and ate it a couple nights in a row, but there was no wow factor for me. I may make it again, and I'll definitely try the coconut rice other reviewers mention to add a different layer to it.

Fabulous, I followed the recipie except substituted raisins and it was terrific, very flavorful. Would increase the ratio of sauce to chicken next time.

Great dish! I dusted boneless, skinless breasts in flour seasoned in garam masala, sea salt and fresh ground pepper and browned 1st. Then soaked the currants in white wine and used two heping tbs of Patak's madras curry paste. Definitely used the toasted coconut but only had sweet so I 1st rinsed and used fresh cilantro. Served w/ pappadams and chutneys.

ok so i cant leave well enough alone.. Its been awhile since making CC based on the classic in the NYT cookbook.. To enhance this I used bone in and skin on thighs... Lightly floured them and browned them on both side for 6+min to give the dish some substance. I added a can of drained sliced mushrooms and soaked my currant and rasin mixture in some rainwater maderia first.. used that to deglaze the pan.. then finsihed it off in the oven at 300 for 45 min

I prepared this "Anglo-Indian" dish as written, even to the degree that I used "prepared" curry powder, which I never do, I make my own, which is quite a bit "hotter". To my way of thinking, prepared curry powder should only be used for deviled eggs and chip dips. I found this recipe much better than I expected. The only thing that I added at table was salt, and homemade chutney....My whole family loved it, I will make this again!

Rating: 3
This dish was absolutely delicious. I changed it quite a bit, however. When I tasted the sauce at the beginning of simmering I could tell that it was too bland so I added a heaping tablespoon of Patak's hot curry paste and a bit of cayenne pepper. This really rounded it out and added a bit of complexity and heat. I used two large vine ripened toms instead of 4 plum. Other than that, the sweet with the hot was delicious! The cilantro and toasted coconut added a great piquant taste!

Rating: 2
This recipe has potential. I used raisins in place of currants, and canned diced tomatoes to save time. I found it bland,even though I added extra curry and even a LITTLE soy sauce. Next time I will definately take the advice given here to add red pepper. Overall, it was a good recipe, just needed some heat.

Rating: 3
A big hit! But I well... Changed it a ton, like I always do, I added currents, and a lot more spices, but the fruit-salt contrast of this one was fabulous.

Rating: 3
I loved this, of course I am a fan of curry anyway, so anything made with curry is great. I added a little hot red pepper to spice it up a bit. I liked the sauce, was great on top of rice. I too made the coconut rice to serve it on from the Seared Salmon recipe on this site. It got rave reviews and will make it again.

Rating: 3
Very good! Subbed golden raisens for currents, drained diced tomatoes, & sweetened coconut for the top (we all liked the coconut as it was a contrast to the spiciness) My curry powder must have been hotter because it was quite spicy! Very easy, healthy and delicious. A nice change of pace that I recommend.

Rating: 4
I thought the recipe was perfect as it is, although I did add some hot red pepper to spice it up. There was not too much sauce, and the textures were fine-- the apple becomes something else entirely, so its mushiness was not a problem for me. This dish was a big hit at a dinner party I gave and everyone wanted the recipe.

Great dish. Needed tons of salt and extra curry powder added. I also thickened the sauce at the end.I also added extra chicken and there was plenty of sauce.

Good for freezers. I made a double batch, froze individual portions in ziploc bags (lay the bags very flat on a cookie sheet to freeze; when frozen, they can then be stacked like books), and stacked the freezer of a friend who is a new mom. She could re-heat in 2 minutes for a healthy, homemade, not too-spicy protein fix. Added a green pepper and ginger, omitted the coconut.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe numerous times and am always pleased with the results. I add 2 teaspoons flour to help thicken the sauce and some ground red pepper to taste when I add the curry powder. In a pinch, I use one can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the apple. If I don't have currents, I leave it out. I always serve this with basmati rice, plain yogurt, and sliced oranges. My type of comfort food!

This dish was fabulous, it had a very nice blend of contrasting flavours. The only thing I did differently was to use dried cranberries in place of the currants. Also the sauce was a bit thin for me as well, so a few minutes before I served, I placed half a dinner roll into the pot to absorb some of the excess juice. This seemed to help it thicken up a bit more, and served as a nice little snack while I was waiting to serve it (I ate the juice soaked bread before serving of course)

I've made this dish several times, and I've never been disappointed... the only change I've made has been to substitute dried unsweetened cranberries for the currants... fantastic! This one's a keeper!

I'll definitely make this again. Yum! And I even liked the broth the way that it was, I didnt think it was too runny. I just served it over coconut rice (from the Seared Salmon recipe, this website) and it was great. I also used golden raisins rather than currents, it worked well.

Rating: 3
Very good flavors. I added a tablespoon or so of minced fresh ginger with the curry powder. The sauce was runnier than I would have liked, so next time I'll cut the broth in half. The apples were mush after simmering for 30 minutes, and I'd prefer more texture, so next time I'll add them later. If you like this ombination of flavors, try the Country Captain Soup on this site--it's our favorite chicken soup.

Sooo very easy to prepare and serve. My family and friends loved the combination of the flavors and textures. We served 12 people with rice. I used a mild curry and golden raisins. ENJOYED!

25 grams of fat is 225 calories, which would mean that almost 99% of the calories came from fat in this dish! with just a couple of teaspoons of oil and a sprinkle of coconut, there's no way that can be correct.

This dish sounded wierd particularly, the toasted coconut. However, it tasted great! Very complex with each bite a little different. My husband and I loved it. My only problem was too much liquid in the pan towards the end. I boiled the heck out of it for 10 extra minutes trying to get it to reduce. Ended up using a slotted spoon to dish it over the rice. I have a Dacor gas stove and used a large All-clad fry pan, the recipe had every advantage to turn out well. I did use an extra chicken breast as I did not need one raw breat in the fridge. It easily made enough sauce for 6 breasts.

I loved this recipe! It had a really interesting taste, and was a healthy meal. Maybe the high fat is because of the coconuts. I added extra apple and fresh cilantro. I added a little flour to the sauce to make it thicker.

Rating: 4
I gave this four forks because not only was this a great dish, it was low cal/low fat! Reasonably quick and easy to make. The only thing I might change next time would be to use regular curry, not Madras curry. I usually love spicy foods, but I didn't particularly like the taste of the Madras curry (could it be the brand I used?). My other comment would be that the fat grams listed has to be a misprint. It must be 2.5 grams, not 25 grams, as written!

Rating: 3
This was a really simple and great tasting recipe. The chicken broth doesn't have to be low or no salt. I just used a bullion cube and water. I used canned tomatoes and I agree with those who used cornstarch to thicken. I've already given the recipe to a co-worker.

Rating: 3
This was excellent and easy; sweet and spicy. I had no currants and substituted raisins which became deliciously plump and complemented the apple well. I also used canned diced tomatoes (drained). I made it while my son was napping and kept it simmering for over an hour - the tastes blended wonderfully. I suspect this would be great in a crockpot - perhaps with split chicken breast so it doesn't dry out...I'll have to try that next!

Rating: 2
This was pleasant and different--vaguely Indian, vaguely American--and the apple was a nice touch. I used half hot and half sweet curry powder, and that worked very well. I also used drained canned chopped tomatoes, dried cherries instead of currants, a chopped-up green pepper added with the chicken for color, and cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce at the end. Very easy, very fast--good for a weeknight dinner for family.

Rating: 3
Very good. My husband usually doesn't like curries, but had two helpings of country captain chicken. I didn't have any curry powder on hand so I substituted with 2 tsp cardamon, 1 tbsp cumin, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp double mustard, 1 tsp corriander, and a small piece of ginger grated and cooked with the onion, garlic and apple.

Very good - I too used canned crushed tomatoes and added 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper and 1 tablespoon of cornstach to thicken the consistency. Cannot wait to make it again!

Country Captain is a Southern dish and was one of Frankin Roosevelt's favorites at his Warm Springs Georgia summer home. I couldn't find my family recipe and seeing that the ingredients were almost identical, I used this one....It was FABULOUS and reminded me of home!!!! Easy to assemble and not a lot of time in the kitchen when guests arrive...try it....you'll LOVE it!

This dish is a classic. It's great for an easy family supper or even a dinner party. I've substituted diced or even crushed canned tomatoes for the plum tomatoes both with good results.

Great dish and easy to prepare. It is practically a meal in itself, only needs a salad and bread. I did have to add about 1/4 c more broth.
