AMAZING prepared exactly as printed. I topped it with fresh strawberries and a crisp wafer cookie for texture. Truly delicious. I'll make this regularly.

cheap and tasted extravagant! both me and my best fiend literally melted a soon as we tasted it! I substituted in sour cream and used a skillet to grill. wish I had gotten softer fruit, I will probably try with peaches, but the nectarines and balsamic were a great combo!

This was fantastic, exactly as instructed. The honeyed crème fraîche was the perfect compliment to the balsamic glaze. Simple but extravagant flavors.

These were delicious! We also used a bit of light rum to flambe the extra glaze before pouring it on top of the grilled peaches. Vanilla ice cream went very well with this.

This was a great, simple dessert for really any time of year, although it suits summer well. For a winter twist, you can always saute the nectarines in a pan with the balsamic glaze and serve over vanilla ice cream. Delicious.

My husband requests this every summer, sooo good.

I don't like honey, so I changed it: I reduced the balsamic with blackberry preserves until syrupy. I didn't use creme fraiche, instead topped the nectarines with vanilla ice cream then the sauce. Tasty.

I included figs with the nectarines and the figs were even better than the nectarines. I will try a mix of other fruits next time.

What a tasty summer dessert from the grill!! I let my nectarines (white) sit out for 3 days before grilling, and they were perfect.....4-5 minutes grilling was sufficient. I used lite sour cream, and it was very good. Will use creme fraiche next time to compare. I also grilled large, firm black plums at the same time. They were more delicate to grill and took less time, but were delicious. How about pears? This dessert got rave reviews and is a definite keeper!!

This was pretty yummy, but my nectarines were too firm. Left them on the grill 10 min and couldn't get them to soften. Substituted lite sour cream for the creme frache. The blend of flavors was terriffic.

This recipe is also fabulous with a really good vanilla ice cream in place of the creme fraiche. I also sprinkle a little cinnamon in with the honey, balsamic, and vanilla. Tastes great!!

I used "firm but ripe" nectarines and grilled them a little bit longer to be sure, but they were very unwieldy to eat with just a fork. Overall a bit disappointing. I prefer a brown sugar type base for fruit and cream.

Outstanding! I was a little reluctant about this recipie (grilled fruit and balsamic vinegar?), but everyone raved. My wife took one bite and couldn't believe it. I followed the recipe exactly, except I poured a little bit of the glaze in a plate and let the halved nects sit cut side down while we ate the meal. In the future, I will let the creme sit in the fridge until I put it on: it was a little runny and messy, but still delicious. If your nects aren't quite ripe enough, and don't pull apart easily try this. Cut down to the pit all the way around, starting along the crease. Then twist the halves (kinda like an Oreo). If you can't pull the pit out of the other half, just cut it out. You might get a little distortion, but nothing compared to pulling the pieces apart.

I use peaches in this recipe and change nothing else. Delicious! Served them with a Jamaican jerk rubbed grilled pork tenderloin and the combination was awesome.

It is hard to find nectarines that I was able to remove the pit easily without destroying the shape. I actually ended up quartering. The appearance was less than spectacular. The creme fraiche became quite liquidy since the nectarines were still warm. The flavour was nice but for die hard dessert fans...it doesn't seem to cut it. I liked it after a big BBQ but my husband was not impressed.

Make sure to use ripe nectarines--ours were somewhat hard, and yet this dish still got raves!

You wouldn't think this was a good combination, but it really is good. The combination of the sweet fruit and the tang of the vinegar is fantastic.

I made this for dessert after a BBQ party and it got rave reviews. I used French Vanilla ice cream and it was perfect and easy. A keeper!

I just made this for a bridal shower and everyone raved! I ended up serving the nectarines with Haagen Daz dulce de leche frozen yogurt rather than creme fraiche, and it really went well together. I used "white" nectarines (the regular ones weren't that right and were terribly expensive) and they were delicious.

It's the creme fraiche that turns this dish from dressed-up fruit to an amazingly rich, heavenly dessert. Use it!!! (And all this from someone who routinely remakes salad dressings without oil and main dishes without butter, and doesn't miss them at all.) Halve the glaze and creme fraiche mixture.

My whole family really liked this but I do have one suggestion. The type of nectarine is important. I would go for something a little softer than they suggested. I used both large that were slightly firm and medium that were softer and the medium soft came out much better. I also cooked them longer than they said-probably about 7 or 8 minutes. They were great! Soooo easy. Enjoy

Everyone loved it! We used non-fat plain yogurt instead, as that's what was in the fridge. It was so easy - it'll be the staple dessert when the grill is lit!!

Simple & Yummy. It melts in your mouth. I can't wait to share this with friends.

This dish is so delicious & couldn't be simpler to make. The tart creme fraiche provides the perfect balance to the powerful & sweet flavor of the grilled nectarines. This dessert is all that summer food should be.

This is a very simple yet impressive dessert. The warmth of the grilled nectarines paired with the balsamic and honey flavors is heavenly. Baste the nectarines as you grill them. If you're grilling for dinner, this dessert is a great ending!
