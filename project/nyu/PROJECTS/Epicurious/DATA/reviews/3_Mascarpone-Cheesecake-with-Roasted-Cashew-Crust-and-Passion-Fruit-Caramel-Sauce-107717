addendum to original review-It took longer to bake than the recipe required, I judged it by the "set", "giggle" observation, & for the extra sweetness by adding maple syrup, I guestimate that it was about 3 tbls to 1/4 cup of maple syrup. Marscapone makes all the difference in any cheesecake, but you cant make the entire cake w/only marscapone because there is no salt in the cheese. I like the suggestion of substituting creme fraiche for the sour cream, as it is more rich than the sc

I made this last week, batter wasn't sweet enough, so I added a splash of pure maple syrup. I used unsalted roasted cashews, didn't have a large food processor, so I used a pastry blender utensil. the constant uncovering was a pain, but the cake was well worth it. I didn't have the recipe for the passion fruit sauce, so I heated about 2 Tbsns raspberry preserves, 1/4 cup Creme De Cassis liquour, about 1 Tbspn of sugar, dash of cardamom, mace, nutmeg, Fiore Di Sicilia (orange scented vanilla extract fr King Arthur Flour.com), & a couple dashes of McCormick grated orange peel. after it cooled & thickened, I mascerated fresh sliced sugar sprinkled fruit with the sauce. I used sliced peeled kiwi halves, sliced strawberries, & slice starfruit. I saved some of the sliced fruit to top the cake, & served the cheesecake spooned with the sauce over it. My coworker said it was the best dessert I've made thus far.

Delicious crust and cheesecake, but the heavy sauce isn't needed. Fresh passion fruit or kiwi would go better with this light cheesecake.

I made this as a birthday cake for my husband following the ingredients exactly. I had a bit of trouble with the baking because I only had a jelly roll pan, not really a pan where I could fill the water as high as the recipe contemplated. Also, because of the way I filled it, I couldn't completely seal it off with the aluminum foil. However, I did cover it with foil and it seemed to be steamy in there. It did take super long to bake, about 1 hour and 40 minutes, and I did check the oven temperature was correct with a thermometer. However, when done, it did jiggle all over when shaken, as instructed, and after setting, it was very light and creamy, yet just firm enough to be set. The flavor was really nice and delicate and the passion fruit adds a nice dimension. I think the crust was okay, but perhaps my cashews had been sitting around too long, or they should have toasted longer? I might try a different nut next time or make sure my cashews are fresh, since the concept sounds good. It tastes so much better than other U.S. cheesecakes which are so dense and heavy. It is definitely rich, but still very light and pleasant to eat. You have to use good mascarpone.

This recipe was great! I think you readers need an adjustment. I have made it 5 times already. I made it for dessert and froze the rest, and it still tasted just as good. The people I made it for said it tasted like Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. The mascarpone cheese made for a different taste. Also, in the frozen food section most big chains carry welch's passion fruit concentrate.

Overall, it was exactly what I want in a cheese cake- not too sweet, great crust, and rich. Its a perfect compromise between new york style cheesecake which I think is a little too dense and "italian" style cheesecake which in my opinion is too fluffy and lacks cheesy richness. However, I must note that the cooking time took much longer than what it said in the recipe by almost an hour. I also took the top foil off for the last half hour to give it a little golden color--more appealing to the eye. For the sauce, I substituted the passion fruit for fresh papaya. Also the sauce was too sweet so I would drmatically reduce the sugar. I would also add more pecans to the crust to give a bit more of a nutty flavor. All in all it was delicious!

Help! The cake was delicious, but the center was undercooked after an hour and a half. Since the recipe says it should still "jiggle all over," I did not realize this until I served it. Do you remove the foil before placing it in the water bath? I couldn't find the concentrate either and used the Goya, but the caramel never thickened. I will try this again, but the recipe needs some adjustment.

I made this cake for a dinner party and people had tears in their eyes. I substituted creme fraiche for the sour cream, and it worked really well. The only thing I found was lacking was more "nuttiness" in the crust: next time I will up the proportion of cashews to sugar. I didn't mind that it wasn't very sweet, I like cheesecakes like that!

First, forget the passion fruit carmel sauce". It was a lot of work to wind up with something truly inconvenient on the cake. The cheesecake benefited from extra sugar. I used 1 cup in the filling. It was awesome! I'm making it again without the "sauce" which really hardeed into a tangled web.

Made this to bring to Easter dinner this year and received lots of raves. I'm not sure why other reviewers thought this wasn't sweet enough -- I (and everyone else who ate it) loved the flavoring and the texture. The mascarpone cheese really makes a difference. One suggestion: try not to leave this out too long before serving, as the cake does get a bit soft and difficult to cut. I also drizzled some caramel on top of the cake before serving. Note on the sauce: I could not find the frozen passion fruit concentrate and used the canned Goya type instead. I did have to adjust the sauce a bit, but it worked out nicely. Kiwis are another good tropical fruit to serve (along with pineapple and mango).

I made this cheesecake for a party. People raved. It was perfect. They loved everything about it--and it was relatively no fuss. I'd do it again in a minute for a big crew of folks!

Definitely need to add more sugar or other flavoring to the cheesecake mix. Love the crust. The sauce was waaayy too sweet and did not complement the cheesecake at all. A simple caramel or chocolate sauce would go much better with this recipe.

I would put more sugar in the cheesecake, it was not sweet enough. THe crust was great, I will use it for other cheesecakes.

Yummy! The cheesecake definitely needs the sauce to complete the flavors. My husband says he likes "stand alone" cheesecakes better. I thought the recipe was great. The cheesecake turned out beautifully with nary a crack. This will definitely make it into my cheesecake recipe book as a keeper.
