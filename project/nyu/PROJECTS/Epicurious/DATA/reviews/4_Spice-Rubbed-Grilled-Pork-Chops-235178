Everyone including the non pork lovers really liked this recipe despite being made with quite thin chops. I used some chipotle chile powder which added some smokey flavor. Quick easy and delicious

This rub is just "eh". Not offensive, yet not particularly palatable. Deffinately not good enough to make ever again.

AMAZING!!! Who knew that pork chops could be so quick, easy and tastey on the grill! This recipe is awesome and I get rave reviews when we make it for friends over for a BBQ. Highly highly recommend!

Really tasty. First time using a dry rub and now I'm a fan. I used this on a piece of rib end pork roast that I had in the freezer, left the rub on for about 3-4 hours. The meat was perfectly cooked and very tender. I made the rub exactly as the recipe states, but next time will use brown sugar and a little more spice -- maybe some ground ancho.

more like 3.5 forks but anyways it was good quick and easy. I used a very similar rub called bone dust. Fried the chops up in the pan...really only took about 2 min per side.

Loved this recipe. I cut the paprika down to 1.5 tbsp, and omitted the red pepper and only a smidge of cayenne, but it was still delicious. A keeper!

decent recipe, but pairing it with a swill wine like coppola is blasphemy. for 10-12 bucks i'd rather have Apothic red blend or a Bogle petite syrah.

Very disappointed in this recipe. It was spicy but not in a good way. Overpowering taste of paprika. Would never make them again.

This was outstanding. Had a friend over to eat and she loved it too. Made it exactly as recipe called for except using brown sugar.

I am the first one who gave one fork to this recipe. I am not sure why because I didn't change anything..I wonder if I put too much rub on the meat because I didn't have any leftover.

This recipe was really easy and really good. I made 5 pork chops and the recipe generates a lot of rub, so I only used a portion of it. Will definitely make again (with my leftover rub). I only used 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne and my husband wished they were hotter, so I will up it to the 1/2 teaspoon next time.

THE ultimate grilled pork chop! Prepared recipe as listed, using Penzey's Spanish paprika(highly recommend)and substituted dark brown sugar for the white sugar as noted by others. Make sure to use medium heat on grill and best results garnered with 1" thick chops. Served with sweet potato fries and 'Pea Salad w/ Radishes and Feta Cheese' made with fresh garden ingredients. Pea salad offered the balance needed to 'cool' the 1/2 tsp. cayenne used in the rub. Have used rub on pork tenderloin, chicken thighs and tilapia with great results.

Love this rub! The only change I made was accidental - put a tad more sugar in. like about a tablespoon. Oh and I used brown, not white sugar. I think it just enhanced the wonderful spicy- sweet going on here!!

Yum! This is now my go-to rub for pork. My husband & 5-1/2 year old daughter & 4 year old nephew were the taste-testers & all gave it a thumbs-up, "keep the recipe" rating, which in our house is the top. It's super easy & flexible -- great if you have the hours to let it marinate, also great if you only have time to rub & grill. For the kids, I make it almost exactly as is, I just skip the cayenne pepper (but I do use the chili powder).

this one was a little harder to review while my husband and I both loved the spice my son did not( he's a picky eater, and meds have modified his taste-buds), BUT I would make it again with a little less on someone who doesn't like spice.

Very tasty and my family agreed. If I hadn't overcooked my chops on the grill I'm sure it would have tasted even better :) I'll make again and pay more attention next time! I didn't have any onion powder so I used chopped fresh onion (Vidalia) instead. The onions caramelized on the grill and added a little extra "something."

I used this recipe last week on some 1 1/2 inch thick bone-in pork chops and they were absolutely divine! I grilled them on the BBQ as recommended and served em up with a side of grilled asparagas and cous-cous. Instead of white sugar I used brown sugar and I plan on trying the rub on ribeyes steaks tomorrow. My mouth is already watering!!!

This is my favorite pork chop recipe- I make it all the time. Instead of BBQing it though I cook it on the stove. My family loves it and is always asking me to make it again.

Pork Chop Willy's Grilling Rub is my new standard for dry rub on pork. I used Hungarian paprika and liked the extra kick this adds to the meat. Used the rub on two chops and saved the rest for the next two chops to enter the kitchen. I let the chops sit for 8 hours before grilling.

3.5 forks. A great, simple, and tasty recipe. I forgot to rub the meat ahead of time, and didn't have time that night, so I just rubbed the spices on and grilled immediately. Still great! I'm sure leaving it for a few hours would be even better. Loved the light hint of heat and I recommend keeping the recipe as-is unless you like spicy foods, then add more. Overall, a great way to make easy and delicious chops.

One of the best dry rubs I have ever used. I did not have Spanish paprika and used Hungarian because that is what I had on hand. I did not use sauce on the pork chops as they really did not need it.

What a fantastic rub! I used pork spare ribs and used the recipe exactly except added 3/4 tsp of curry. Let it sit for 6 hours. It took 9 minutes on each side for a total of 18 minutes. It was totally fantastic! Mouth watering!!!

one correction. i used less salt since i added adobo seasoning which has salt in it. recommend. 1tbsp of salt and 1tbsp of adobo.

Rating: 4
this was da' bomb! seriously! i did everything here plus i added two tablespoons of adobo seasoning. also, i basted only one side of the chops with honey after i turned them over on the grill. that sort of countered the pepper, but still left some kick! served with some sweet potato fries and some okra. My kids ate it up! best pork chops i've ever had. Period!

This was a simple spice rub to make,yet it needed more salt. I used smokey paprika but would definitely do the sweet next time. Also did not use the cayenne pepper

We really enjoyed this recipe on pork tenderloin. We loved the heat and would add a bit more sugar next time to carmelize it more.

Fantastic taste and easy to make! I would recommend however, brining the chops first and cutting down or even omitting the salt in the rub.

Big hit with hubby and we didn't even grill the chops. Instead, I used my teflon grill pan on the stove top. Chops were not spicey hot (I reduced the cayenne a bit). Highly recommend!

This may be *the* recipe that made me a convert of the dry-rub concept. I had not been very impressed with the recipes for steak or chicken with spice rubs that we'd tried in the past. Somehow this one made the breakthrough for me. I think the type of chop and the slow grill over medium heat are important with this recipe - thin and lean chops will cook too quickly and will be dry, and it seems that the time on the grill really allows the flavors to permeate the pork. And I had read in the past that the salt in a spice rub could make the meat dry if you let the meat sit for longer than an hour or so - maybe it's the ratio of salt to all the other spices in this recipe, but I was glad to see that it isn't always the case. I like to coat the chops and let them sit in the fridge for the suggested maximum eight hours.

This was a good basic rub. No need for BBQ sauce.

An outstanding recipe. We cooked boneless, thick Whole Foods organic pork. I'd recommend 18 minutes total, over medium direct. Scale down the cayenne (or eliminate altogether) and a strong recommendation for a side of bbq sauce. This is a tasty, delicious recipe.

Quick, easy and tasty. I doubled this recipe and skipped the oil all together. The chops were moist and well-seasoned, even though I only let them sit for 1 hour after applying the rub before throwing them on the grill. I decided to serve the chops atop garlic mashed potatoes and it was a great combo. I garnished the chops with some arugula sauteed in sparse, but equal parts olive oil and butter, and garnished the potatoes with some freshly diced green onions.

Really nice rub and soooo easy. First time I didn't have tough chops on the bbq and only marinated for 1 hr. A bit spicy for one kid but the other 2 loved it. Definitely worth trying.

The is an excellent rub, that you may never get tired of using. I like a little more heat so add a little more cayenne and use 1/2 smoked paprika and 1/2 sweet paprika.

Rating: 3
This rub is wonderful. I was a little bit worried about the cayenne (have kids) the first time I made it but it wasn't hot at all, just a good overall blend of seasonings. I am making a big batch today so I will always have some on hand.

For the two of us I used just two nice sized chops and a third of the rub. Took about 16 minutes on the grill. Good, simple meal with baked potatoes and applesauce. Should of fixed a green veggie but felt lazy. Try it.

Fantastic rub. I only marinated about 1 hour, and will also have to try to marinate early in the morning so I get a full 8 hrs. Turned out great. The only thing I changed was real chopped garlic mixed in with the dry rub. Gilroy is just down the way, so no excuse to not use the real thing.

This rub was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly (completely unlike me) and my family raved. Only marinated for 1 hour and will do for longer next time. Served with homemade apple sauce, corn on the cob, fresh peas and mashed potatoes. I have a very similar dry rub used for baby-back ribs, that requires crushed red pepper and flakes, but this worked for our non-heat loving members. Try it!
