So good! But I will probably omit the pears next time. It doesn't need the sweetness, and there is something icky to me about hot fruit (blackberry pies are the only exception).

This was a great, light dish. I added chopped baby bok choy and sliced shitake mushrooms as well.

Excellent. Paired with with the Pan-seared Tuna w/Ginger-Shiitake Cream Sauce recipe and it was perfect. Added ripe pear sticks at the very end (just tossed with noodles and let sit for a few minutes) - Pear didn't get mushy at all (just don't cook it). I suppose you could use an unripe pear and cook it, and it would be fine. Don't leave out the toasted sesame seeds at the end - adds a perfect finishing flavor and texture.

My husband and I loved this recipe! We added bok choy, which was such a refreshing addition, and we left out the pear (didn't have one). We didn't think it needed the sesame seeds - - but would be fine either way. Light but very filling... we'll definitely made this again!

Tasty recipe! I reduced the amount of carrots to 3 large carrots and it was just the right amount. It also could use 1 pound of tofu (1/2 pound seemed a little too light). I wouldn't say this was something you'd server at a dinner party as a show stopper, but it was definitely good as a mid-week meal. Healthy too! Who needs meat!?

This was delicious! I added green beans diced small to add more veges and reduced amt of carrots. I also added sriracha sauce after it was cooked to add a little kick of spice. fabulous!

The vegetarian and carnivores alike in my family enjoyed this one. The pear was a little overcooked, and added an interesting but not vital flavor. So would consider skipping next time. Would also increase the amount of tofu. I added some snow peas for color and texture and substituted standard mushrooms for the shiitake for $$ reasons. Also substituted black sesame seeds because they were on hand. Directions were a bit complicated-no need to remove carrots etc. So just cooked then a bit first, added the remaining veggies, then the cooked noodles and then the remainder of the sauce ingredients. The tiny amount that was leftover was great for lunch the next day.

This was my first try cooking with soba noodles and I thought it was delicious. I tried to follow the recipe as exactly as I could since it was my first time around, but next time I think I'll cut back on some of the oil, add more pears (and maybe veggies) and cook the tofu differently. All in all though, a raging success! Can't wait to have it cold for lunch today.

This is a pretty good recipe. I substituted some things for what I did not have, and altered the sauce somewhat: 1/4c of mushroom water, 1 tsp cornstarch, 1 packet artificial sugar, and 1 T light soy. I also added some red pepper. For colour I added a handful of edamame thrown in the last 4 min. of boiling noodles. You don't need this much oil!!!! I used one T for all the saute, and 1 tsp of sesame oil in the noodles. It was great!

I made this yesterday evening and absolutely loved it. Soba and tofu are two of my favorite foods, and this recipe made good use of them. The next time I do it, though, I'm going to increae the quantity of vegetables and decrease the soba by a bit. The proportions in the recipe seemed to make the veggies a bit lost in the soba. Overall though I thought it was spectacular.

I used portabellos instead of the shitake, 4 cloves of garlic instead of scallions, and salt instead of soy sauce. the flavors were were really good but 8 oz is too many noodles.

Wow!!!! I loved this recipe. Here is the thing. I could not find soba noodles so have no idea what they taste like. Got Somen noodles instead (found in asias area of grocery). Love these noodles!!! The asian pear is an absolute must in this recipe and I plan to use two the next time I make it!!! They are a key part of the flavor. Also thought I had but did not have sesame oil as well as seeds, but had neither. I used tahini because I happened to have it. Do not know if it would be better or worse the way it was written, but I know my very picky boyfriend, who is a chef, loved it!!! One of the best summer dishes I have ever had.

Whoever can't taste the Asian pear in this recipe has taste buds that are dead. Don't leave them out. The pear is what makes the recipe. This is so quick I can whip it up in minutes, after work. The flavors blend delightfully. It's pure genius.

A good basic recipe requiring some creativity (IMO)... Black noodles (squid/ink durum noodles) are very attractive in this dish. The veges need to be LIGHTLY crisped in a wok (or large saucepan). I added cilantro (1/4 cup)(if you do, you might as well omit the pears - can't taste them). Omit the water if you don't want a soggy dish. With the above refinements, I give this recipe four forks!

Added garlic and chili sauce as suggested by previous reviewers. Used 1/2 the oil and doubled the ginger. My husband and I both loved it. Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe! Like other reviewers, I added a lot of garlic and a little thai chilli to the sauce. I love the sweetness that the pear adds. You can also 1/2 the vegetable oil for a healthier dish although the sesame oil is essential. It reheats well as leftovers.

I've made this dish many times and each time it gets rave reviews. I've made some adjustments however, as it needs help as-is. Don't bother with the pears ... you can't taste them anyway. I use 2 tbsp hoisin sauce, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 2 tbsp black bean sauce, and chili pepper infused sesame oil for the sauce ... just disolve it all in the soy sauce/water mixture. I also use less ginger and add some garlic. Lastly, I saute some pot stickers in a wok, then add 1/2 cup of the sauce mixture, cover and reduce. This is a great topping to the noodles and the sticky sauce adds extra flavour. Top it all with lots of sesame seeds and it looks/tastes great.

I've made this dish several times for company and it's become a favorite.

Epicurious has not done a single Asian recipe right, of the many I've tried. Can't pass off something that's just a veggie medley with an overabundance of ginger and other "Asian" ingredients as an Asian dish. Please. No need to give this a try out of curiousity either...

Too bland for my taste, even with more ginger and added garlic; and the soba got soggy.
