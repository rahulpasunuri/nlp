Delicious, easy and super fast! I substituted (store-bought) gluten free bread crumbs for the english muffin, and added dried parsley, oregano, ground black pepper and dried basil to the bread crumb mixture. Also used chicken tenders instead of breasts because I had them on hand. Cooked them for 15 mins at 375 degrees, perfect. Then put a few spoonfuls of jarred pasta sauce on each tender, sprinkled some shredded mozzarella on them, and warmed them up enough to melt the cheese. Everyone loved them. BTW, I tasted one first before adding the pasta sauce and cheese, and they were perfectly delicious even without those extras. Will def. make these again!

I made this last night for my kids and they loved it. I whipped up some cornbread for the crust and that was the ticket. I used the recommended two tablespoons of mustard and it was a quick, delicious meal for kids. Also used a rack and the chicken was crispy on both sides. Good weekday go to for chicken.

I was surprised at how well it turned out given how simple the recipe is. I used 2 large skinless chicken breasts and followed recipe fully except I used 2 tbl of mustard, and panko with olive oil instead of butter sprinkled with a bit of Tony Chachere seasoning. It marinated only 15 min. or so; baked at 375-400 for maybe 30-40 minutes on parchment. Chicken was very juicy and flavorful. Nothing fancy to look at; I wouldn't entertain with this recipe. But what a healthy alternative to traditional chicken parm., served with brown rice. Wasn't crisp underneath but I didn't care, b/c mixed well with rice.

Wonderful! I made an Italian meal for my gourment dining group and this was the main dish.

Started with a Lemon Artichoke Romaine salad and ended with Panna Cotta with Fresh Berries. Yum!

Made as is, except that I didn't have English Muffins, so I used some stale bread, and didn't have lemon. Used the amounts called for in the recipe for everything else; it was a strong mustard flavor, but we like that. I felt I barely had enough of the mustard marinade to go on the 6 breasts. (Maybe why we had such a strong flavor?!) Chicken was moist, topping was crispy. Very simple, quick and very flavorful. Bonus: Only had to dirty a couple dishes to make it, and the baking dish stayed clean, too!

I also used the panko crumbs and used one teaspoon less of dijon. The dish turned out extremely well.

I followed the advice of the people before me - just 2 tablespoons of mustard and swapped the english muffin for about a cup of panko bread crumbs. It was nice and crisp, and tasted good. The mustard gave it a nice kick, but I think using the full 3 tablespoons would be a bit much. Very easy to make and tastes like home. Overall, I would definitely make it again!

Easy, fast, and delicious. The chicken was moist, tangy, and flavorful -- my husband and our 15-month old daughter loved it. I might use panko breadcrumbs next time for a crisper crust. I might also add some cayenne pepper for a little kick. This is very similar to the deviled drumsticks recipe on Epicurious, which also uses breadcrumbs (and is quite good)! I will definitely make this again!

I thought this chicken was boring, not that tasteful. One daughter wouldn't even try it since she could smell the cheese. The other said it was ok. If I made it again I would add more seasonings and try panko bread crumbs to make the crust crunchier.

Yum! I cut the mustard to 2 TBL, and it was just enough. I used whole grain, light english muffins that tasted great. I also used red wine vinegar and thin-sliced (scallopini) chicken breasts as that was all I had. Chicken was juicy and flavorful, with a crunchy coating. I served with spaghetti marinara and roasted broccoli. Will definitely make this again and again.

Needed a quick meal for a sunday nite --this is just the one....instead of english muffin & butter, i used panko and olive oil....very good and tasty, even my your child liked it! i only had chicken on the bone so i lowered the temp to 425 and baked for 45 minutes -- using parchment paper i was surprised that the top and bottom of the chicken were both golden brown to perfection. the only problem was that the coating kept falling off on the dinner plate when cutting the chicken. so i wouldn't make it for company. will definately make this again and again.

This is a great recipe for a not-so-great cook like me. I reduced the mustard from three tablespoons to two and baked it on a cookie rack, and it came out perfect...crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and so tasty no sauce was required! We used a whole wheat English muffin because my husband is diabetic, and used a blender rather than food processor to make the breading, and it was all very delicious. Overall, an easy and very tasty recipe!

I've made this many, many times and it's always come out terrific but I decided to take a few suggestions from previous reviewers. I reduced the Dijon to 2 Tbl (sometimes it was a little too "mustardy")and that was a good idea. I also baked it on racks rather than parchment but will go back to the paper - both sides always came out crispy but not so on the racks. This was a frequent dish when my daughters hosted team dinners - upwards of 24 girls - always a hit!

I followed the recipe almost exactly as written, only substituting balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar. It was fantastic. The English muffins made the dish special. The processed muffins, cheese, butter and pepper mixture was so soft that it adhered easily to the marinated chicken breasts. One thing I will do differently is marinate the chicken longer (I ran out of time.), and prepare a savory sauce as a treat to go with it.

I made this tonight for our weekly Sunday night chicken dinner. It was excellent! I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead. I let the chicken marinade in the mustard mixture for about 1.5 hours. I used stale italian bread instead of english muffins. I served the chicken with roasted red potatoes and green peas. My family all had nothing but positive things to say. I will make this one again soon.

Rating: 4
This is an easy, elegant and healthy recipe. I followed it with the exception of using 4 chicken breasts instead of 6. Although they were each 5oz it took longer than the recommended 15-20 minutes to cook so I sort of butchered one of the breasts checking to see if they were done (it took closer to 25-30 minutes total). I like the idea of using a wire cooling rack on the cookie sheet to get the entire breast crisp. I was amazed at how moist the chicken was, and the mustard flavor from the marinade was perfect. I served it with Lemon-Parmesan Linguine. I anticipate this will be my go to baked chicken recipe for some time.

Rating: 3
This was so quick and easy. I have a picky one year old, and an even pickier husband. I also have VERY limited time to get home from work and put dinner on the table (about 45 minutes total). This meal was delicious, even though it was a more nutritious take on chicken parm. The meat (I butterflied the breasts rather than halving them, and then pounded them slightly) turned out moist and very tasty. The breading was perfectly golden, although it didn't adhere to the chicken as well as I would've liked. I made it with a wild mushroom risotto, and the crowd was pleased!

Rating: 3
This turned out really good. I made a few changes though. I prepared the marinade a couple hours before dinner so the chicken had time to soak in all the flavor. For the marinade I used dijon mustard, red wine vinegar (didn't have white wine), a half teaspon garlic, salt, and chili powder (somehow ran out of black pepper) I used panko instead of ground up english muffins. Instead of butter I used canola oil spray. At the end some of my chicken wasn't crispy enough so I put it under the broiler for a couple minutes. I will make this again!

Made for my husband and I (used 2 breasts and halved the recipe) and it was delicious. Very moist and a little more interesting than regular breaded chicken. Didn't have english muffins so substituted with fresh crumbs from sourdough bread. Worked out fine. Good hint to bake on rack for extra crispy - I turned it half-way through and it worked but a rack would be easier. Quick and tasty for weeknight dinner.

I reviewed this recipe several years ago but wanted to say again how easy, but so delicious, this recipe is. The only thing I change is that I add one clove of minced garlic to the mustard mixture. Other than that, it's perfect. I've probably made it 25 times or more and it always gets raves.

What a hit! I enjoyed making this dish from the sauce to the crumbs, and it came out just perfect. I did have to add about 10 more minutes to the cook-time because I use a tiny toaster oven, but everything else was perfect. For a college student like myself, this is gourmet.

This is a great recipe as-is. I did not have the English muffins the second time I made it but it tasted even better with: panko (the kind that has Italian seasoning) and grated parmesan cheese as the stuff you dip it in (ratio 2 panko, 1 parmesan). I also did 2 tbsp dijon and 1 tbsp spicy mustard. It came so amazingly delicious. One of the best recipes on this site!

Rating: 4
I've made this for years - it's one of my first and favorite epicurious recipes. We pound the chicken first to increase the breading ratio and it's one of those rare dishes everyone in the family loves. Plus, we can do this on a weekneight. I'd give it five forks if I could.

Rating: 3
Just so people understand, this is NOT chicken parmesan, the tomato sauce and mozzarella-smothered creation. And it's not supposed to be. As for prior reviewers, I'm sure that marinara plus mustard tastes odd. I would definitely not plan to top this with marinara. I would not even plan to serve this with a tomato-sauce based side dish. This is closer to chicken milanese. It is very moist and tangy. I prefer to marinate longer and double the vinegar to increase the tanginess, I add some tarragon to the breading mixture, and I bake on a rack on top of a cookie sheet for maximum crispiness. Expect more french country than italian, and you'll better appreciate this recipe. The english muffins really are essential to the texture, reviewers who used dried bread crumbs and complained have not actually tried this dish. The english muffin breading is amazing, crispy yet fluffy and moist.

I did not really like the combination of flavors. I thought it was too mustardish. I followed the recipe and the dijon mixture was really thick and overwhelmed the parmesan and bread crumbs. If I make it again, I think I'll add some dijon to some whisked eggs and use that for the wet dredge.

I have been making this recipe for along time and at our home we don't refer to it as "parmesan chicken" but rather mustard chicken. Parmesan chicken, to me, includes a marinara sauce. This recipe is simple, quick, and good. I don't use English muffins, just plain old white bread. I have used this recipe for wild game (fowl) such as wild turkey, quail breasts, grouse, and pheasant. My husband likes to hunt! And this recipe works well for all fowl.

Yum!!! This is a super easy meal plus its delicious! I went ahead and used panko instead of the english muffins and loved it. The mustard was subtle (I used the dijon w/out the grain) and the flavor of the parmesan really stood out! This will be a regular dish in my house!

Very good and simple! Will definitely make again, even on a weeknight, and will experiment further next time. Tasty, moist chicken without a lot of effort. Took one cook's suggestion and added a bit of light mayo which mellowed the sharp flavor of the mustard. Omitted butter, used romano cheese and plain bread crumbs. Parchment paper made clean up easy and helped the chicken cook evenly--it was done in 18 minutes and nicely browned. Served with wild rice. Next time will omit salt (enough salt in the cheese) and maybe add a dash of garlic powder or tarragon. This one is going into our "standard" meal rotation as a solution to "what should we do with this chicken?" Ingredients are always on hand. Do try it!

We don't eat carbs with protein/fat so I leave out the muffin/breadcrumbs and just coat with Parmesan cheese and it works just fine. I cook on a rack in a roasting pan with foil lining the pan and never have a problem with crispness--I also cook for 30 minutes to be sure the chicken is cooked through. Usually serve with a tossed salad--made a quick and easy Halloween night dinner.

I think I rated this recipe before. I made it again and used Panko bread crumbs and fresh shredded pecorino romano and just normal grated parmesan cheese. Also, only had country dijon mustard on hand. Sorry, did not keep track of the amount of cheese I used but it was probably a 1/2 and 1/2 ratio and more than the recipe called for (I like cheese). It turned out so much better than the first time I made it. Love this recipe with the changes I mentioned.

I rated a 2 but I believe this can be much better than mine turned out. Flavor was good, texture left something to be desired, only the bottom was nice and crispy. I improvised with what I had on hand: 10 chicken tenderloins, Italian-style bread crumbs (no bread on hand!), shaved parmesan cheese. I guessed that 1 1/2 english muffins processed would be about 1/4 c bread crumbs... I processed the parm as finely as I could, seemed to work just fine. I served mine with a side of pasta and marinara. I can hardly wait to make again using exact ingreds and see how it's REALLY supposed to be. I know the texture will be much improved! I used a silpat like another reviewer did, and it was great.

Made it a second time and placed the chicken on a bed of zucchini and tomatoes and roasted them alltogether.

Excellent flavor and so moist. You must use the parchment to prevent the chicken from getting soggy. I used rosemary bread for the crumbs because that's what I had on hand. This really added to the flavor. I baked on convection and turned the chicken halfway through cooking. I served this with pasta, Paul Newman's pasta sauce, and a salad.

I substituted Pesto Sauce for the dijon and served with a side of spaghetti with red wine sauce on both. It was really good -- better than I've ever had in a restaurant.

Wonderful and easy recipe! I would highly recommend marinating the chicken in the mustard mixture for a couple of hours - it turned out VERY tender on the inside and crispy on the outside! Four Forks!

This is a fantastic recipe! I used the suggestion from the Texan, and cooked the chicken on a stone. It worked out wonderfully. To make this a lower fat version, I reduced the amount of parmesan, and added a little bit of oregano, and substituted the butter with olive oil. The results were outstanding. The chicken breast was surprisingly moist and flavourful. I've also used this recipe on pork tenderloin. With the same baking time, it too came out wonderfully. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe as is, or to tinker with according to what you have on hand. I usually use fresh sourdough bread crumbs and have tried various mustards, all with delicious results.

This is an outstanding recipe, made better by using asiago cheese pugliese from the local farmer's market bakery. Trader Joe's also carries a similar bread. It gives a wonderful, complex taste to the bread crumbs and allows you to reduce the amount of butter and parmesan used in the recipe, while enhancing the flavor. Cooking hint: cook on a Silpat (silicone mat) instead of parchment and the coating will be nice and crisp on all sides.

By the way, the parchment paper or a cooking rack are a must if you want it to be crunchy on both sides.

My husband loved this. I was in a pinch for time so I didn't let the chicken marinate and used chicken breast tenders in place of a whole breast. I also used cider vinegar and store bought commercial bread crumbs. Instead of a baking sheet I used a shallow baking dish which I sprayed with Pam and did not experience the soggy chicken as others did. This is definitely a dish I will make again.

I thought this was pretty good! I was missing some of the ingredents, but it still turned out well. I didn't have any parchment paper, so I put the chicken on a cookie cooling rack instead. I also used boboli bread, and deli mustard instead of dijon. It turned out great! The rack works well instead of parchment. I served it over rice with spagatti sauce over the top. I'd make it again for sure!

This was so delicious~and so easy! I did follow some of the advice of other reviews, used high quality cheese, french bread crumbs instead of muffins and a very grainy mustard. I also marinated for 3 hours before breading. It was a little soggy on the bottom, but I used a baking rack instead of parchment paper~next time i may use a combination of the two. definitely one for the recipe book!

This dish is so easy to prepare and it's yummy, too! I've made this several times for my family and everyone loves it. I use fresh parmesan reggiano and chicken tenders (frozen from Costco, just take out what you need the night before and defrost in the fridge) and always use parchment paper for a crisp bottom crust. I have also used a silpat to make this recipe and it turns out crispy, as well. I have never had a problem with sogginess with the chicken, it has always turned out wonderfully, and so moist on the inside, too! This one is a keeper in my recipe book.

The first time I made this, my daughter asked if I could make it again the following night. Using the best quality Parmesan makes a difference (the shakeable stuff in a can won't work). I also substitute Worcestshire sauce for the vinegar. The last time I made it, I briefly put the coated chicken breasts on a paper towel for a minute, and it absorbed some of the moisture but didn't take off the coating. The bottom was not as soggy as a result.

If I could rate this 31/2 I would because of ease of prep. to go along with taste. For those who didn't fare as well... parchment paper is the way to go, the " real" Parm is a must and the oven has to be 450 degrees as specified. Other than that I can't imagine where the complaints come from.

I've made this 5 or more times, and each time, it gets rave reviews! It's quick, but looks like I put in alot of time and effort. Never had a problem with the chicken getting soggy on the bottom - I use parchment paper every time, and it does the trick.; & I try to keep to the required amount of butter. I also marinate the chicken for a minimum of 2 - 3 hours. My husband is on a food-combining diet (no mixing carbos & protein/fats), but he thinks this is an extremely worthwhile cheat!

Also used a Guinness Mustard (with seeds) and added a bit of flavored hot sauce to give it a little zip. Forgot the English Muffins -used a 7 grain bread, cause that's what I had- but will try the english muffins next time. Overall a great dish.

Some liked this, others did not. My husband was one of the "naysayers", mainly because he felt the chicken had no taste. I used top-quality Reggiano, so I know that's not the problem. The chicken stayed moist -- a plus. Next time I would definitely add cayenne, or hot sauce, and a little garlic powder to the chicken. I too felt it was on the bland side.

This was a really tasty chicken dish that took hardly any time at all to prepare. I used regular bread crumbs instead of the english muffin and mixed them with butter and cheese like the recipe called for. The chicken was moist and had a nice flavor. I would definitely make this again and perhaps let the chicken marinade in the mustard sauce for a few hours if time permits.

Truly a 30 minute meal. Great dish for busy week night schedules with kids and homework. My husband and 12 year old request this all the time. In fact, this is what I make my daughter for special dinners for good grades, etc. I serve it with spaghetti with lemon and garlic (Gourmet Dec. 2001 or Jan. 2002). It would also be good with potatoes. I would recommend cooking the chicken on a foil lined pan sprayed with Pam to help with clean up. Also the pan you use to get a crispy chicken is important. Use a jelly roll pan or cookie sheet with shallow sides (not more than 1 inch). Do not use a casserole type pan (9 x 13 x2 ) because sides are too high and chicken will get soggy. Also, this is great dish to begin after breakfast. Bread the chicken and put on baking pan, cover with saran wrap, and put in fridge. When dinnertime comes, all you have to do is bake. I usually pull the chicken out of the fridge and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes to let is come to room temperature before I bake it. Be sure and follow the time on the recipe because it is fairly accurate because chicken will burn easily. While the chicken is coming to room temperature, I begin the side dish I am cooking to go with it. The spaghetti with lemon and garlic I cook as a side dish, I can't find on this web site. Basicly, it is spaghetti with olive oil, garlic, lemon , and red pepper flakes sauce. Any light pasta dish would do. One reader mentioned it was too bland. I have spiced it up with extra cayenne, creole seasonings, etc. My family like it both ways. Also, I substitute bread crumbs made with fresh French bread. I usually make bread crumbs in the food processor and store in freezer in old coffee can or plastic container. Never use store brought bread crumbs. Also, I have never used English muffins for bread crumbs because they have so much sodium in them. I promise it is a winner.

I have made this recipe many times for myself and my husband. We eat a lot of chicken and find this a nice alternative to the standard baked or grilled chicken breast. The mustard and crumb coating seem to make the chicken moist, crispy and flavorful. I make it without the butter and sometimes use olive oil or cooking spray.

My girlfriend and I really liked this. We have made it for ourselves, and for others (including her parents when they were visiting) and it is always a hit. I know that someone who has reviewed this before was complaining about the amount of mustard -- but if you only let the chicken sit in the mustard for :20 minutes before preparing the meal, it is not too strong. I am guessing that they must have used something much stronger than Grey Poupon for their dijon.

Rating: 2
Although I followed the recipe exactly, I thought the mustard was overpowering - it masked the taste of the parmesan crumb coating. I was expecting much more flavor from the parmesan and I used top quality, freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano. If I was to make again, I would definitely reduce the mustard amount by half. Following all the great reviews I was rather disappointed, however my husband really enjoyed it. Update July 10: I cannot believe this recipe is still on the "constant comments" list. I made this months ago, then again a few days ago (reduced the amount of mustard), and my opinion has not changed - this is a ho-hum recipe at best. I really don't know what all the fuss is about.

Excellent and easy recipe. Being a real fried chicken fan, I've never been a fan of oven fried. This was full of flavor. Marinated in the mustard overnight. Used a baking stone. No problems with sticking. Excellent leftovers.

I followed most of the reader's tips as far as keeping the breading on the chicken, but still had problems with it. Also, even with the suggested additions, I thought it was pretty bland and not much, if any, better than shake-and-bake.

tried this recipe after checking the most popular on the website. Looked easy enough and was well-reviewed. I cut boned chicken breast in strips for some high-rent chicken nuggets. I didn't have sticking but some of the cheese melted in a crust on the pan. (I didn't mind a bit as picking the brittle cheese once it cooled off the pan made a yummy snack on its own.) I used domestic parm and the english muffins, needing more topping for the chicken due to increased surface area. Even a hit with my kids. For a change, I tried them on sea scallops. I know, purists will scoff at the fish and cheese combination. Even my husband looked skeptical, but ending up liking them as much if not more than the chicken. For me, the cheese overpowered the shellfish some; if I try it again, I'll use less parm.

Add a teaspoon of cayenne, some chopped fresh parsley and some crumbled cooked bacon to the crumb coating for some added taste.

AHA! I have made this recipe at least 4-5 times, with the bottom coming out soggy.

This was a great and easy dish to make, even for a lazy cook like myself! I made the decision to cook this dish last minute, and used equal parts Parmesan cheese and pre-made breadcrumbs. I melted enough butter to make the consistancy what it needed to be to make it stick. Didn't have parchment paper, so I used Pam, and I also didn't have time to marinate the chicken for more than 15 minutes. Having said all that, the chicken was crispy on both top and bottom and very tasty. Although it was breaded, it still had a light feel to it. This was a perfect work night dish to throw together.

Served a side of angel hair pasta tossed with butter and parmesan. Add a green salad and you have a wonderful meal.

Delicious and so easy - even my picky kids love it. I have made this dish several times and found that a nice coating of PAM cooking spray on a cookie sheet works as well or better than the parchment paper,just be patient and give it a little extra time for the bottom to "oven-fry".

First, I have to admit that I forgot the time and over-cooked the chicken a bit. So any problems I had might have been due to that: However,I was a bit disappointed with both the flavor and the appearance-- though it is definitely true that the chicken tasted better the next day. I did add tarragon and cumin to the marinating sauce--and did cook the chicken on the rack. The presentation above didn't work for me, as it made the dish look ugly. I ended up leaving cutlets whole,with a dijon mayonnaise and a garnish on top. I served it with the wild rice salad and glazed carrots, both from gourmet.com. They were big hits with my boyfriend's parents! I will make the chicken again, however, and be sure to set an alarm. It'd be nice to have a simple, reliable chicken dish.

I added garlic and parsley, yet the chicken still turned out slightly bland. My husband wanted sauce with it, but I couldn't think of anything that would go. Next time I will use a slightly stronger mustard and be sure to marinade it.

At what point does it become a new recipe? I don't measure, so it was all approximate (I use the recipes for inspiration). I was out of white wine vinegar, so I mixed rice wine vinegar and some raspberry vinegar. I didn't have English muffins, so used some 3 day old French bread. Fearing blandness, I dumped in a heaping tablespoon of pesto left over from last night's dinner (spring is here when I have enough basil to make my first pesto). Because of that, I cut the parmesan a tad and the olive oil a bit. With those changes, this was a HUGE hit. My wife's uncle, a notoriously picky eater and recent widower, invited himself over today while I was at work, and I didn't have time to shop, so I had to work with what was in the cupboard. I made extra breadcrumbs and used them on an eggplant, zucchine and roma tomato gratin for a side. Rounded out with a tossed salad and a quick risotto and dinner was ready half an hour after I got home. Will definitely try this again.

I made this for my in-laws earlier tonight and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it! I didn't mind the soggy bottoms (I did use parchment paper) because the tops were very crispy--my chicken breasts were rather large and so I cooked them at 425 for about 25 minutes, which brought the chicken temps to 170 degress with no trouble. I thought they had a lot of flavor and were very moist--I served with steamed asparagus and boiled new potatoes with garlic and olive oil. Quick and easy dish that tastes great!

My husband and I thought this was delicious and so easy. Was afraid leftovers would dry out when reheated, so covered them with Five Brothers Bertolli Olive Oil and Roasted Garlic spaghetti sauce and thin slices of provolone and baked them (covered with foil) at 375 degrees for 25-30 minutes)and served over pasta -- just as good if not better than the first time. A keeper -- will definitely make this again.

I'm a vegetarian and I don't eat or buy meat, but I bought chicken for this recipe as part of a special 42nd anniversary dinner for my parents. I didn't try it, of course, but they raved and raved about it. I followed the directions exactly and it looked perfect. I served it with a side of "carrots glazed in balsamic vinegar and butter," (recipe on epicurious) which were absolutely delicious.

I've made this recipe 3 times and each to RAVE reviews. Yes, even with parchment the bottom breading is soggy, but *no* complaints from anyone! In fact, it's a great juxtaposition of flavors and textures. Adding a 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. of cayenne to the breading also adds a nice kick. If your chix breasts are large, cut in half length-wise and watch cooking time carefully. Follow the proportions carefully (especially the melted butter, or the breading will become mushy and not coat evenly). This recipe really delivers amazing bang for the buck. Kudos to whoever created it!

Rating: 3
I really liked this recipe. I placed the whole breast on each plate the first time around and got ok responses. The 2nd time i made it, I sliced it first then served it on top of a mixed green salad for every individual. It was a huge hit. And the left overs tastes even better, it seems! A note to the cook in Boston: parchment paper allows the breading on the BOTTOM of the chicken to stick to the chicken. When it cools for a couple of minutes, you peel the parchment paper off and you get all the breading. You can use silpat just fine, but most likely, the breading will come off the bottom of the chicken. Not a big deal though. It will still taste good!

Rating: 3
I've been making something like this for a while but took the hint of marinating the chicken in the mustard, adding the vinegar and adding cheese to the crumb mixture. Wow! What a difference! Just those few differences added lots of zest to an otherwise plain chicken. The crumbs on the bottom of the chicken were very wet and slid off, but the top was very presentable

This was quite good...my husband and I both loved it. Very easy to make - I love a simple recipe! I marinated the chicken first, for about an hour - and I substituted lemon juice for the white wine vinegar, since I didn't have any - it seemed to work fine. I used breasts with bones in them, as that's all I had - just increased the baking time - this recipe was perfect for 2 large breasts - plenty of coating for both, and a great, crispy crust!

This is a very tasty dish. And it's so easy and requires very little time and effort to make. I used a mixture of dijon mustards (a little of a grainy mustard and a little of plain dijon).

I highly recommend marinating the chicken for a little while though.

This was very tasty and easy to make! I didn't have time to marinate, which I think would have made the breasts a bit more moist. I also would have pounded the breasts a little or maybe used chicken tenders or thighs. I did add cayenne, onion powder and lots of chopped garlic which really made the dish excellent. I served it with steamed broccolini and basmati rice. My husband loved it. I thought it might have been even better with some kind of sauce though-any suggestions?

This was a good recipe even when used with boneless skinless chicken breasts (which I hate for their dryness and lack of flavor). I have made them with bone in chicken and liked it even more. It's also easy!!

I made this for my book club last week-- the second time I'd made it-- and not only was it fast and easy (and low-fat, if you go light on the parmesan) but all of my friends demanded the recipe! One raved that it was the best chicken she'd ever had... wow!

I made this with prepared bread crumbs, since I don't have a food processor, and romano. Clearly the mustard is what makes it. Probably any kind of vinegar will do. I served this with pasta with garlic and olive oil and a caesar salad with cherry tomatoes. It was yummy and reminded me of food my mom used to make. Also, I used foil, and the bottom of the chicken didn't bother me. I thought 15 minutes was plenty at 450, but I only cooked three breasts. Also drizzled the butter over the top instead of mixing it in. I would totally make this again, with whatever variations necessary.

My second attempt, as a new cook, at an epicurious recipe. I loved it!! I, again, took other cooks recommendations--used grainy dijon, added garlic, tarragon, used olive oil, and a good parmesan cheese. I also marinated the chicken for 2 hours. I did use the parchment paper, but still found the bottom to be mushy. This would get four forks if I could find a way to get the chicken crispy on both sides. I will try using a rack next time.

After I read the reviews I had to try this simple (in flavor) sounding recipe. It was excellent!! Crisp and tender with a zesty mustard kick. I cut the chicken into strips for extra crisp and added garlic, parsely, cayenne pepper and balsamic vinegar--as mentioned in other reviews. I also doubled the sauce and set aside 2 tablespoons for dipping--just in case--but didn't need it, only the true mustard lovers used extra sauce.

Excellent and very easy recipe, I did find that the chicken was a little soggy on the bottom, next time I will try cooking on a rack as others have suggested. I also added about 8 more minutes to cooking time as chicken was not cooked through at 20 minutes.

Although this was an easy and impressive dish, I found it far too salty. I will make it again, but next time will omit the salt entirely. If you're like me (you don't keep a salt shaker on the table), you'll find that the parmesan provides enough 'saltiness.'

Excellent and easy week night meal. I marinated the chicken ahead of time and prepped the english muffin, cheese, butter coating in advance, too. My 2-year old had it fresh and juicy and loved it, but it fared well waiting for my husband to come home after staying warm in the oven for a while. And it was good the next , too.

I LOVED this recipe! I was reminded of it yesterday while looking in my recipe box for another recipe, and decided that I had to make it last night, even though I didn't have everything I needed. I used a honey-balsamic dijon mustard, and added in a dash of horseradish, just to give it a bit more kick. Instead of English Muffins, I used some Seasoned French Bread Crumbs that I had, combined with a slice of sourdough bread, and that turned out to be excellent! Since I didn't have parchment paper (nor do I have a cookie rack) I just buttered some tin foil and put that on a cookie sheet and that seemed to work fine. Next time I will stick to the exact recipe (and try a stoneground dijon like others have said), but regardless I was extremely pleased with this easy and delicious dish!

What a great find this recipe is! Based on some reviews I made some changes and it turned out great. My hubby & I loved it and it was a really simple dish to make. I used skinless (bone in) thighs because I find the dark meat is much more tender and moist. I also substituted grainy style dijon mustard because some people said they found it bland. I think this is the secret to how good this was. The grainy mustard also added a great texture and zip. As suggested I added garlic (what is a recipe without garlic!) about 4 cloves. I also used garlic flavored wine vinegar and added some tarragon. I really like mustard & tarragon together. For the coating, the english muffins worked great - just as everyone said. I also added more pepper and a dash of cayenne. Instead of the butter, I used a tablespoon of olive oil because it's easier & healthier. Worked out great! I make oven fried chicken quite often. I've used the rack and the foil method and the chicken is usually soggy at the bottom. With the parchment paper it actually got nice & crisp underneath - first time ever!! I cooked at 425 for 10 minutes and lowered to 375 for 15 minutes (convection). I flipped the chicken so that it browned evernly on both sides (about 3/4 of the way through). Simple & delish! Highly recommend!

Everyone, including my oh-so-picky 4 year-old, loved this! I used a grainy dijon (because that's what I had available) and good quality, fresh-grated parmesan. As easy to make as it was delicious! I had a few left over, and I re-crisped them in a 425F oven for about 15 minutes. After cooling for a bit, I sliced them and served them atop the blue cheese caesar salad (also found on this site). Both meals were a hit!

I'm vegetarian so I don't eat chickens unless they haven't been born yet. Well I chuck the undeveloped bird fetus in the GC and fry up the nutrient rich amniotic fluid at any rate. In lieu of English muffins I used a store bought low-fat pumpkin pie a-la-mode...Sorry, last cook stomped on my sarcasm nerve. Anyway. Great recipe, simple to make, but enough versatility to go with a variety of other dishes. I used fresh ground black pepper, a good parmesan cheese I picked up at the deli and grated myself, and I lightly toasted the muffins so they would crumble better in my food processor. I went over the chicken breasts with the sharp tines of a small fork and marinated in mustard mixture for 2 hours as suggested. Also had success with rack-over-baking-pan-lined-with-foil method instead of parchment paper. Very tasty. Enjoy!

I'm a vegetarian, so I substituted eggs for the chicken. Also am trying to watch fat, so I threw out the yolks (and didn't use the butter). Instead of an English muffin, I used a fat-free blueberry muffin. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about- I've had better salted water!!

I was pleased with this recipe. I found it tasty as did my 15 and 12 year old. They have asked for it again which doesn't happen vey often. I had no english muffins so I substituted sour dough bread with the crusts removed. This seems to have done the same job as the muffins.

Made this with boneless, skinless thighs and the family loved it. Will try the breasts next time. I would suggest that those who find this bland may not be using an excellent quality Reggiano. The coating is mostly flavoured by the cheese, and so using the right Parmesean is important.

This is a great recipe for a busy weeknight. I, like others, was skeptical at first about the English muffin, but it made the crust so light and absorbed the marinade well.

This was very tasty, but I have a recipe from the 4-C Seasons Breadcrumb (popular brand in the north east) that is VERY similar in taste and a bit easier to make.

I thought this was a great recipe, not only super easy but great tasting. I cut the chicken breasts in half so they were thinner and they came out extra cripy. The english muffin gave a great texture ,light and crisp. I grated parmesan as I like it better than the shredded kind and I thought it added enough salt.Definitly a winner........

Rating: 4
I made this dish for dinner last night, and it is absolutely wonderful! Since there were only two of us, I halved the recipe. I agree with a previous reviewer that the marinade was just enough; so I would increase the mustard if I made the full recipe. The funny thing is that I dislike chicken, English muffins, and mustard, but this recipe is great! I could not really taste the mustard in the recipe (I substituted cider vinegar for white wine vinegar). The English muffin gave the breading a very fluffy texture, and the chicken came out great. I think next time I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces to get more breading on each piece.

I too loved this recipe. Do you think you could freeze the prepared chicken just before cooking for use at a later date?

Rating: 3
Delicious, so quick and SO easy! I generally do the prep ahead of time and let the chicken sit in the fridge for an hour or two before baking. I think this helps with the soggy crust problem, too. A great side dish with this is green beans, cooked just until crisp/tender, plunged into ice-water to stop the cooking, and then sauteed in butter with a very finely chopped red onion. My daughter's boyfriend (a french chef) made this for us and it was perfect. Leftover chicken is great cold. Bring back to room temperature, slice thinly, and it looks pretty plated up with some salad.

tried this on SWORDFISH since after picking out the recipe my boyfriend saw fish at the market and we are adventurous. The combo of mustard and parmasean is tangy. Used stoneground mustard since I didn't have dijon. I would imagine a lot depends on the quality of the mustard. Would use prepared breadcrumbs next time for ease (don't have food processor) as English muffin didn't seem to add that much. Would bread only only top next time as bottom too soggy even on rack and those breade crumbs tasted heavy

Rating: 3
I thought this was very good but my boyfriend LOVED it - went on and on and ON about it. I did add 6 cloves of minced garlic to the marinade, added parsley flakes to the topping and cut the mustard back to 2 T. The garlic was a great addition but we couldn't taste the mustard and will definitely use 3 T next time.

I've made this several times, baking the chicken on top of a cookie rack and lining the baking pan with foil, as suggested by previous commentator. I also add a little cayenne and a bit of garlic powder to the cheese mixture. My husband loves it!! And it's so easy . . .

Terrific, very quick and easy i will serve this to guests next time. with modifications I used 1T of dijon and 1T of yougurt for the base originally i omitted all the salt but will add 1/4 t to the base next time cooked on parchment on a preheated insulated cookie sheet [with no sides] and the bottom crust was not soggy at all

This was great. The chiken remained moist. I baked for 12 minutes. I used a SLIPAT to cover the baking sheet and it worked perfectly.

FANTASTIC!! This was simple and delicious. I didn't add any salt because I find anything with Parmesan is salty. I used fresh parmesan and grated it myself. Again, I find the prepackaged and grated grocery store parmesan very salty. If you bake this on parchment paper the chicken will not be soggy. I don't particularly care for Dijon Mustard but I think is is integral to the recipe. Try it, you'll like! Especially good if you take the 2 hours to marinade the chicken.

Before reviewing I went back and read all the reviews, really got a chuckle out of the very first one. I thought this was excellent. I have several oven-fried recipes in my files and this is definitely one of the best. The english muffin makes a better crust than bread crumbs, in my opinion. The crust was crisp and the chicken juicy and tasty. The chicken breasts were more like 8 ounce size and very cold; it took 35 minutes which made for a more browned and crispy crust. They were crispy on the bottom, but did have a tendency to stick at the small end.

So Good! I used "stale white bread" cause that's what I had, and added some plain yogurt to the marinade...really thickened it up nicely. Also grated some assagio in with the parm.

Roasted potatoes with rosemary and olive oil at the same time and served with steamed green beans. Yummy!

A suggestion for all those that got mushy undersides.....use a baking pan with a flat rack inside (like you would cook a roast in - not sure what you call them in the states :-))instead of parchment paper on a tray. Spray the rack with canola/olive oil spray to stop sticking and you should be right! I have been making a similar version of this dish for a couple of years now and this is the best way I have come across to get crispy chicken all over. Enjoy!

This was pretty good, made the dish pretty much as written, but halved the amount of chicken and used only 1 english muffin. It was fun to make and came out well although as other reviewers noted, the bottom was mushy, in spite of suggestions for preventing this. Otherwise it was a spectacular presentation. My daughter announced that she was no longer interested in chicken, and did not eat hers, my husband stated it was pretty good, so I think I was the only one impressed (my cats enjoyed it as well). Perhaps I need to feed my human family less culinary delights and then spring this on them. A few cans of stew and some fried SPAM, and they might appreciate it more. Actually this is a very good starter for many other meat dishes, and I plan to use it (after a few rounds of SPAM) with pork tenderloin and a mustard cream sauce. Happy holidays everyone, and thank you Epicurious for bringing us delightful recipes on the net.

This was delicious! Our family loved it. I would serve it for casual company IF I had a spectacular side dish to go with it. Otherwise, it is great family fare, very tasty.

Anyone who likes this recipe might like this one better: Heroin Wings 4 lbs. chicken wings 1/2 cup butter 1 cup grated parmesan cheese 2 tablespoons dried parsley 1 tablespoon dried oregano 2 teaspoons paprika 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper First, preheat the oven to 350. Cut the wings up into "drummettes". (Freeze the pointy "tips" for soup -- they make *great* broth!) Then combine the grated cheese and the seasonings. Line a shallow baking pan with foil. (Do *not* omit this step, or you'll still be scrubbing the pan come New Year's Day!) Melt the butter in a shallow bowl or pan. Now: Dip each "drummette" in butter, roll in the seasoned cheese, and arrange in the foil lined pan. Bake for 1 hour at 350. Kick yourself that you didn't make a double recipe!! You'll notice that these have practically zero carbs.

This was really easy and good. I let marinate for at least 2 hours. I sprayed the parchment paper with a little PAM first. It was incredibly moist and did not stick to the paper at all. This is very similar to a signature dish by a restaurant here in Anchorage (Simon & Seaforts's) called "Chicken Dijon." They saute garlic with butter and mustard, then coat the chickenand drench in panko crumbs and bake. They also serve with a mixture of mayo and dijon mustard. This was easier and really good.

This recipe is really easy and goes together very quickly, which makes it a good choice for a busy week night dinner, not to mention it tastes good too. I didn't have boneless/skinless chicken breasts, but I did have some boneless/skinless chicken tenders so used those instead. They worked out just as well, although the baking time should be shortened. Next time I'm planning to leave out or reduce the amount of salt in the recipe, it didn't really need as much as it called for.

YUM! It worked perfectly - except it set off the smoke detecter the whole time it was in the oven.

I sliced the breasts in half and ended up letting the chicken marinate over an hour in the mustard vinegar coating. By the time I got around to cooking them, I didn't want to wait on preheating the oven so I pan sauteed. Great flavor and very quick and easy for a weeknight.

Wow! This was excellent. All the ingredients gave the chicken a wonderful taste. Used the smaller english muffins that I had on hand and it worked out perfectly. Next time I'll leave it in for about five more minutes so the top gets crispy.

Delightfully quick and easy with wonderful flavour. I like a bite to things so I added quite a bit more pepper than was called for - turned out wonderfully.

We really enjoyed this dish. I made the recipe as written, and it came out perfectly. Usually when I cook boneless, skinless chicken breasts, the breasts turn out somewhat dry. But I've made this recipe twice now, and both times the crust was crispy and the chicken moist. I'm delighted!

What a great, simple workweek dish! It tastes even better reheated for lunch the next day. I used parchement paper ($2.50 in the baking section), but the chicken stuck to it and all the crispy parts of the underside of the chicken were left behind.

Deeeelish! I really liked this alot and so did my guests. I used Pam, but preheated the pan for about 10 minutes before placing the chicken on it. This seemed to keep it crisp.

We loved it. I used chicken nuggets, which were tasty but a lot more work. I used PAM instead of parchment paper and flipped them over halfway through, which took care of the soggy bottom problem. This recipe is one I would serve to company, (but I would use breasts, not nuggets).

I used sour dough bread instead of the english muffins (3-4 slices less than 1 in. wide) and we loved it. Fast, easy and really good.

An easy recipe that worked perfectly and was very flavorful.

Very simple and delicious. Great flavor!! I too had the problems with sticking, but I think it is enough having just one side coated.

Delicious! almost a 4 forker. I mistakenly used chicken tenders (I'm not sure if that's what you call thin strips of chicken breast) . I think i would use the same as every piece had lots of coating and 15 mins. was perfect for that cut of chicken. tender and delicous!

Sorry, I thought this was a two-forker at best. I followed the recipe exactly, and thought it came out bland and dry. Next time I might add a few things to the mustard "marinade" and let the chicken sit overnight. Will also try a Silpat as previously suggested. I used a wire rack and still had problems with sticking.

Thought the recipe would be more complicated than it was. Everyone we had dinner with copied the recipe to take with them! Next time I'll add the crumb mixture gradually. I had to throw a lot out because it was contaminated with the fresh chichen, that I could have saved for next time.

This recipe is simplicity itself. We'd certainly make it again.

I made this recipe with no adjustments, and it came out perfectly! It was so easy, and there wasn't even one crumb left. My husband says that this dish is now his favorite. The only thing I did differently is that I baked the chicken on a Silpat baking pad instead of parchment paper. The chicken just slid right off, and it worked perfectly.

My family loved this recipe although, the top of the chicken was great the bottom was soggy. I followed the recipe exactly- I did use parchment paper. Any suggestions?

I made this recipe after work, put the chicken in the sauce and let it sit while I made the coating. Followed the recipe exactly, I usually do the first time, and it was excellent. Had an older version I liked but this was MUCH better. Everyone in my family (4) two adults and two children raved about the chicken. I'll make this again, and for comapny too. So simple and delicious. A real keeper.

I always learn neat tricks from the reviewers of these recipes...I tried it with the panko bread crumbs, on a baking sheet with cooking spray for 20 minutes, AND with a side of the garlic lemon spaghetti. Turned out crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, so I'll be making this one again. The husband wondered if the breading would be good on baked fish...I was thinking something firm like shark or swordfish--any suggestions/experiences?

The dish had a nice flavor. I served it with a side of the Garlic/Lemon pasta and both were well received. I cooked the chiken for 30 minutes and it was nice and brown on the outside and juicy on the inside.

Dee-lish! I mistakenly bought chicken breast strips (fingers), instead of whole chicken breasts, they worked beatifully. It gave more surface for the coating, they came out very moist. I used parchment paper and I recommend a spatula to lift the chicken off the pan, that way you don't lose the nice crunchy bottom (I used a tongs first and the coating stuck to the pan).

This recipe goes together quickly, I used Panko. Also I used parchment paper as directed, but the bottoms turned out soggy! Next time I will place my baking sheet in the oven to preheat, then place chicken on parchment onto preheated sheet to see if that will produce a crispy bottom.

Excellent, easy, and even the kids liked it! Next time I will make this with the lemon pasta from the same issue.

This was tasty, but not particularly interesting. It was a good fast chicken dish, but my wife was not impressed with the number of dishes: taste of dish ratio. Which is the normal standard in my house.

My husband loved this dish! I thought it was very good and easy too. I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used white wine instead. I also increased the pepper a bit in the mustard mixture. Instead of parchment, I used a rack on top of a jelly roll pan, that I had sprayed with Pam. It turned out great, and I cooked it for 20 minutes at 450 and then turned it down to 400 for about another 10 mins. or so, until the crumbs turned a nice brown. It smelled heavenly while cooking and it was crunchy all over on the outside, and the crumbs barely fell off. This is a keeper!

The chicken was great and really easy! However, the coating did stick to the parchment paper. So, I think I'll try it on a greased cookie sheet next time.

Only two of us so made 3 chicken breasts but same amount of other ingredients plus used parchment paper, marinated it 1-1/2 hours and cooked it a little longer than 20 min, maybe 30. Husband loved it with cranberry/pineapple conserve.

What is Panko instead of English muffins?

Great dinner for when Hubby is out of town, and kids still need a nice home cooked meal. I used Panko instead of the english muffins. This is a wonderful flavor to a typical 'shake and bake' kinda dinner. Did the PAM spray thing, instead of parchment. Worked out just fine.

This dish was so simple and great tasting. My family eats a lot of chicken and there were rave reviews from them. This is definitely a keeper - and what a carefree dish for company.

I will make this recipe tonight and give a further report next week. It is simple and looks great. I will serve it with fresh steamed rapini and oven fries which makes for a relatively low fat meal.

Very tasty and tender. I napped mine with a beurre blanc sauce to make it even better. Nice and easy mid-week dinner that is good enough to serve to company!

In answer to the parchment paper vs. Pam or grease: You can use Pam, BUT, the bottom of your chicken will be soggy. I recommend using the parchment paper. It's not very expensive; about $3 - $4 around my area.

I have made a dish VERY similar to this, and have just used a non-stick cooking spray on a pan and it worked just fine. The dish is delicious and actually very juicy.

I disagree with the previous comment; most experienced cooks can visualize pretty well what a completed recipe will look like. I do have a question, however. Is parchment paper necessary,or could we use Pam or grease the baking sheet?

If you don't have a picture of the prepared food very few people will try it.
