This was a tasty, and satisfying meal for a cold Massachusetts, Friday night. Like the cook from New York, NY, it took me over an hour to complete. Even so, it isn't difficult. Do make the Salsa Rosa. I was concerned about the addition of a cinnamon stick but the cinnamon flavor is very subtle. Would I make it again? You bet. Both my husband and I enjoyed it. I served it with garlic bread, and red wine, of course:-)

As originally written, I'd give this a solid 3.25; with a few minor changes, it's a 4. I first made it exactly as written, only substituting turkey for pork sausage. Very good, but the rapini contributed too much water & had that cabbagey flavour it gets when boiled. Also a little oily overall for my taste & a touch sour. This time I sauteed the rapini with some shallot, garlic & red pepper instead (which also gives a nice bit of crispiness), & dressed the lentils with less oil (cut the oil all round, actually) & lemon instead of vinegar. It was fabulously good- complete, healthy, wonderfully satisfying.

Delicious. I'm not sure how other people made this quickly - it took me over an hour to complete - but it's a very nice meal and worth the effort. The sauce is incredible. The cinnamon is subtle. I used fire roasted tomatoes. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used some red wine and some white vinegar. It worked fine. Served with crusty french bread. Yum.

I had all the ingredients on hand and decided to try this recipe. I was surprised by high reviews. I didn't think it would be that good -- but I was wrong -- the flavors are great. I agree that the Salsa Rossa is a key ingredient to the finish dish. I did choose to use sherry vinegar, instead of red wine vinegar and a mix of fresh sausages from local meat market instead of Italian (next time will use only Italian sausages). This is definitely 'comfort food'. This will definitely be a repeat in our house. The salsa rossa is a wonderful addition to the lentils.

I love lentils and italian sausage together so as Jamie would say I gave it a go! Such a simple dish but really works, the salsa rossa is essential as the other reviewers noted - it makes the dish. Did not have a cinnamon stick so added a bit of the ground spice. Did not have the broccoli either. Used fresh tomatoes.

this was pretty good - lentils took longer than expected. salsa was also pretty good. but somehow fell short. maybe the sausages we used weren't the best - we live in China so hard to get authentic italian sausages....

Delicious, quick, and easy! I made some small substitutions to cook it a bit faster and use what I had in my fridge. My changes were using pre-cooked turkey sausages and adding leeks, green peppers, and jalapenos to the salsa. I didn't have parsley fresh so I used creme de fraise for garnish. I suppose sour cream would have worked too but I didn't have any. I would also recommend corn tortillas because the crunch would be nice, I'm also thinking this would be a great gluten free meal.

I admit that I was very skeptical about this recipe at first, as it did not sound very exciting. But I made this for New Year's Day and my boyfriend (born and raised in Milano) had 3 helpings. That's saying a lot! The spicy salsa rossa really adds a lot of flavor and interest to the lentils, so don't leave this part out!

I have made this dish a dozen times and I have never grown tired of it. I even made it for a discriminating group of French diners, who rated it formidable.

I never rate recipes and I'm not the biggest lentil fan, but I was snowed in and had some of the ingredients so I tried it. Delicious and easy peasy! I I had to used red lentils, fresh grape tomatoes, and apple cider vinegar, and no parsley. It was still fantastic! Will make again.

I was snowed in at home looking for a puy lentil recipe. I had just about the right ingredients to make this recipe (all except the broccoli). I was impressed how easy and tasty it was. It took only 10 minutes to prepare. My husband really enjoyed it. Definitely make it again when I am looking for something quick.

I have made this recipe over and over - even my Dad who baulked at the idea of lentils (he's a meat & potato guy) loved it. A novel and relatively healthy way to serve up sausages. Use a very good quality ev olive oil to finish the lentils, and it is fabulous.

Really easy and delicious. The recipe was flavorful but even my kids liked it. The sausages are very tasty baked too and the sauce is delicous. I substituted Trader Joes already cooked lentils because I was short on time. I will do that again -- it tasted great!

This was delicious, and not as complicated as it seemed. The lentils have a very mild flavor, but are perfect background for the sausage (a good sausage seems to be key) and the tomato sauce. Will make again!

As always, Epicurious comes through with another accurately rated recipe. I didn't have broccoli or fresh thyme but it was still very delicious. The tomato salsa is wonderful. Didn't finish the lentils with the 4 tablespoons of olive oil/vinegar, because I forgot, but it might have made it even better.

I made this last year (Jan. 1, 2007) and it was delicious, easy to make and a crowd pleaser. The salsa rossa is what makes it special. This dish will be on our table again as we bring in 2008!

scheming to find a creative chilli-like dish for a November day, I found this and it's a winner! Really- I won a chilli cook-off at a friend's place (small one!) Pretty straightforward to prepare, especially if don't switch pans for sauteeing and searing the sausage, and cook broccoli in salsa saucepan after pouring salsa over the lentils. I've made it both with and without broccoli, good either way (probably healthier w ;-)) I add salt to the lentils while cooking them. I prepare this dish with 4-5 sausages, sliced, instead of 8, and am happy with that. Spicy Italian sausages were especially lovely. *can* be served with either cornbread of Italian bread as well... and red wine, of course!
