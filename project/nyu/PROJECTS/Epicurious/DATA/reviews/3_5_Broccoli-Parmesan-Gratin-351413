This one is a keeper. I made this recipe easier by just using broccoli florets and not bothering with the pealing stems and dicing part. I did cook this a bit longer as it seemed not quite done (a bit soupy) just about 10 minutes more before the broiling. It was delicious. Company loved it!!

Easy and delicious. Works as a main and as a side.

The person who thought it was like baby food needed to cook it longer. For me it took 10 minutes more. I've made it with bread crumbs and without, both times really good. only problem is a pretty much instant stomach ache because it's so fatty. I think next time i'll consider some kind of substitutes, not sure what though.

Was good- I was out of bread so used chopped corn tortillas in place of the bread crumbs and that worked pretty well! I'll make it again, good side dish.

Awesome.

Stellar. Don't skimp on the salt. Sauteed a red onion, diced kale stalks and a little fresh green garlic in olive oil and threw it in the bottom of the dish. Yum. Very rich and delicious.

I made this (no changes) for a Thanksgiving side and it was a hit with a picky crowd. Easy and good.

Easy to make and delicious! I needed something to make with broccoli at the last minute, so I tried this recipe. It was a hit with everyone - kids included.

This wasn't bad, but for the amount of cream and egg and cheese, I would expect it to be a lot better. Would rather use my yummy, fatty ingredients in a tastier recipe. You would think a cup of Parmesan would give it some flavor, but not really. Had to salt it at the table, something I rarely do.

This was very delicious and a new thing for me to do with broccoli. I went with the few suggestions from other reviewers and added some nutmeg and caramelized onions to the dish and it really turned out wonderful. This is definitely going into my repertoire.

Perfect and delicious! The Broccoli-Parmesan Gratin was the consistency of a souffle and absolutely easy to make. I used day-old croissant for the bread cubes. Fabulous for breakfast too.

We loved this with the Thanksgiving turkey and the Christmas rib roast. Don't make substitutions. Use that cream and whole milk. Grate REAL Italian parmesan. Add that 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. My guess is the reviewers who found it watery or bland made some changes to the recipe.

I divided up the recipe into 4 individual cast-iron single servers (so cute!), but I *think* I let the recipe become somewhat overcooked. I checked on it once and it was too soupy; checked on it again and it had hardened up way more than I would have liked. The flavor was still very nice, and more than likely I will try this again.

Bland and watery. No doubt, adding onions and the long list of other suggestions would help, but the recipe as written is more like broccoli-casserole-flavored baby food. For years I've believed that adding cream was a sort of short-cut to creating a dish that people love - NOT SO! BTW - It would be so kind of those who have not made the recipe to resist "previewing" it with a fork rating. For reasons that your young children can explain to you, this is a statistical no-no, and most unhelpful to those trying to decide which recipe to make for dinner. Thank you kindly.

I found this recipe delicious and so did my guests. The only change I made was adding sauteed onions. I also used a glass baking dish and baked it a little over 30 minutes, but didn't broil it. The bread crumbs still turned out quite crispy.

Made it for company and everyone raved. Used caramelized onions and freshly grated nutmeg as other reviewers suggested. Also, I didn't have any heavy cream so substituted sour cream. The broccoli was good, but next time I'll boil for a little less time as I like it slightly more al dente.

This recipe was very simple and very tasty. I took the suggestions from other reviews and added nutmeg, white pepper, and caramelized onions. It was a hit! Definitely doing it again.

This recipe is a fabulous starter recipe to add your personal touch. As other reviewers noted, it is bland as written. However, everything else about this recipe is great (texture, cheesiness, etc.). Saute some diced onions with garlic (and add whatever spices you like) beforehand and add that to the mixture-- turns out delectable. I also added sauteed mushrooms. This is a solid recipe for a broccoli casserole, and gives you the freedom to make it (aka adjust and add to it) however you like.

This delicious and quick side was a big hit with my partner and I. We found that using a full cup of Parm a bit too strong for the broccoli - 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup was plenty. I used light cream as a healthier option, and found it remained decadent and flavorful.

Made recipe as is. Bland and not worth the calories from the heavy cream and cheese.

Ok, after reading a previous reviewer thought it was a bit bland, as I thought it sounded, too, I cooked 1/2 c of chopped onion, garlic and a chopped poblano pepper(on hand) and added it to the broccloi, which I also added 3 yellow squash from the fridge cuz they were on their way out. I also used Progresso Italian panko crumbs (on hand).It turned out great!Even my not so veg friendly teen liked it! How did I even cook before I learned about panko crumbs?!

I served this over baked potatoes for a hearty vegetarian dish and it was outstanding! Will definitely make it again.

I've made this 4 times. Delicious and easy to make. A 9" round (2" high) baking pan is the perfect size.

I enjoyed this. I saw the recipe, but only had frozen broccoli, I didn't pre cook it and it worked just fine. Rancho Mirage cook 3/03/09

Have not made this yet, but will for tonite. I plan to add a bit of chopped onion(might saute it first). This might pick of the flavour a bit for those who said it was a bit bland. Adding the nutmeg too sounds perfect.

I added a pinch of nutmeg. There is nothing spectacular, but it tastes good and its very easy to make. Its a good daily recipe! I will do it again.

Good texture,easy to prepare, but overall rather bland. This recipe needs something to kick up the flavor. Any suggestions?

We halved this recipe & made it last night exactly as called for. We really enjoyed it. Simple to do and it presented well. Another time I'd try to add more cheese, likely in the gratin. I liked some suggestions for grated nutmeg & panko too & will likely try to incorporate those too.

This was quick and easy, tasty and impressive looking. Would suggest using half as much parmasean and subsituting for white chedder, it was almost TOO rich with full quantity.

Tasty when made with nutmeg and plenty of homemade whole wheat bread crumbs. The most important thing was not to pre-cook the broccoli, which allowed it to retain a pleasant and flavorful crunch.

we didn't do back-flips over this, but it was fine, and it's simple enough to make. I actually thought it tasted better the following day.

Absolutely delicious. I usually hate broccoli, and I loved this. I intended it as a side and ended up eating it alone. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was so easy and very tasty. It's definitely a keeper. Broccoli can be so boring and this is definitely a nice way to eat it. It's between a quiche and gratin. I will recommend it to my friends.

This is a superb recipe for broccoli. My husband doesn't like broccoli that much, but he loved this recipe. Great as a breakfast aside dish too.
