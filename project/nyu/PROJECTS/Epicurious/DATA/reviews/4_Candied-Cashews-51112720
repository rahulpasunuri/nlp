I'm not aas experienced as most cooks on this site so I followed the directions. I was very pleased. I took them to a party and they were a hit! They are pleasantly sweet, salty and spicy - in that order. The spiciness hits your mouth at the end as a pleasant surprise. Easy to make and worth the minimal effort!
