Very solid cooking method, wings came out crispy and delicious. I baked them for 15 each side, drained the marinade into a pan, and then lobbed the wings in on convection at 375 while I reduced the sauce. I then added the sauce back in, tossed, sprinkled with sesame seeds, and baked for another 10 min or so. Excellent, easy clean up, and did not have the flabby skin issue that baked wings can often have, yet moist and very tasty.

I added scallions to this recipe and cooked it in a glass pyrex at 375 for about 40 minutes.The chicken had a nice dark glaze and my children loved it. I served this with rice and sauteed baby bok choy, onions and snap peas.

Really good array of flavors and easy to make! I doubled the recipe and didn't really have to change any proportions. The only thing I changed was to finish them under the broiler to get them nicely browned. Due to the amount of liquid from the marinade, the chicken steamed rather than browning in the oven.

I made this 3 years ago for a baby shower using the chicken wings. This time I used boneles skinless chicken thighs and marinaded overnight. I also used a good medium dry sherry -- it adds so much flavor and makes nice glaze.

I made this dish the other night and it was very good! I didn't have any port so I just used some chicken broth instead. I cooked the wings a little longer than 40 mins (I flipped them again) and it came out great!

Instead of drummettes I substituted regular chicken breasts. I also didn't have sherry handy, so I used port. I also didn't bake in oven. Instead, I grilled the chicken in a cast iron skillet and made the glaze in the same skillet. I will make this again!

My kids loved this recipe, so it's a keeper. I found that the wings weren't quite ready after 40 min. Maybe it was because I used a glass baking dish instead of a skillet. I broiled them at a higher temperture for a few min. to brown them.

With all the positive reviews here, I have to wonder if I did something wrong. I thought the wings were okay, but nothing to write home about. My sauce never really "glazed" and I wasn't overly impressed with the flavors. My caveat is that I'm not a wing-lover to begin with, but my guests definitely liked other parts of the meal more.

My husband really liked these. I thought they were ok. It may have been a little to garlicy for my taste. But that may have been because I used some old garlic. But because of all the good reviews on this site and my husband liking them I will make these again and give them another try. My taster may have been off because of a stuffed up nose.

Thanks to these chicken wings I am a domestic goddess to my husband. My family brags about this dish to their friends, even my brothers are proud. (sniff)

I doubled the recipe for a baby shower -- the ladies LOVED these! I seasoned the marinade with pepper and a little salt -- it needed a tad of a kick. I also added a dime size piece of peeled ginger to the liquid before boiling to a glaze.

These are even better served cold, the next day! The flavor was more pronounced then.

Yummy, finger licking good! I marinated the drumettes in a plastic zip-lock bag which allowed the marinade to totally surround the chicken. Try to remove as much air as possible and just flip baggie over a few times to circulate the mixture. I am one who truly appreciates good wings but for the sake of others I'll try using boneless thighs next time.

You can't go wrong with these tasty chicken wings. They're delicious. The sesame seeds really make a difference. I doubled the recipe with great success. No problems. Very easy.

I made a huge batch of these for a party. Very easy, and everyone really loved them. When making this in large batches, however, do not pour all of the liquid over wings while baking--there is too much and the wings end up "boiling" instead of baking. I had to pour some liquid off in order to get the wings to bake correctly.
