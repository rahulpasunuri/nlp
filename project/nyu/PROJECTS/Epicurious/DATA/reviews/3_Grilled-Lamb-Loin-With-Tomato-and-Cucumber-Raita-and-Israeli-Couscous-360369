There was a lot of activity with this, but nothing was complicated. The lamb is worth the cost. Followed the recipe exactly. My husband especially enjoyed the raita. Don't slice the lamb too thinly or you won't get the full flavor. I had mine on a bed of arugula as seconds weren't an option on my diet - this is weight watcher friendly. Plan to have leftovers in a pita like souvlaki...
