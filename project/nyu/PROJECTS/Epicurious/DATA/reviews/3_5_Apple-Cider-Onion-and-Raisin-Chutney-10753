I've been making this for Thanksgiving dinner, on and off, since it was first published in Gourmet and it's always a hit. Just the right flavor to balance the saltier, heavier gravies and sauces. Everyone who's had it at our house has loved it.

It certainly was delicious once it was finally done - but it took considerably longer than 35 minutes to boil down to the right consistancy. I may try it again but cut back on the cider by a cup or so to see if it makes a difference.

delightfully different. We made this for Thanksgiving this year. A great accompaniment to the turkey. Added slivered almonds on the top. Nice touch.
