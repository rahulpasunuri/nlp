Loved it. However, being completely incapable of just following a recipe, I made the following mods: Used garlic-olive oil when dressing the salad ingredients. Added medium chop red bell pepper to salad ingredients. Browned 1 or 2 sides of the potato chunks after steaming, and subbed shrimp for the lobster (I'm cheap). Still a very nice recipe that I will most certainly prepare again.

Easy to prepare, using leftover lobster meat and frozen shoepeg white corn. The combination proved to be deliciously satisfying. Will certainly make this again .
