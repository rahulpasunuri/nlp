I only made the yogurt sauce (i.e., I did not stuff the tenderloin with minced chipotles). It was still quite flavorful and my family enjoyed it.

Loved this recipe! And really easy to make. Tasted great together with a simple Spanish rice and homemade guacamole (I would make the guacamole more neutral in taste to balance out the spiciness of the pork tenderloin dish).

I made this recipe last night and recieved a standing ovation! Excellent summer meal that is incredibly easy to make. I did change up a few things that helped to knock it out of the park. 1.) I added Manchengo cheese to the inside of the porklion. Big thick chunks that melted wonderfully over the chipotle peppers. 2.) I wrapped the entire thing in bacon!!! Everything tastes better with bacon.

I made this as written and it was delicious. Don't forget the guacamole - it's spicy. I served it with sauteed peppers and onions and Spanish Rice. Delicious!

Found this to be easy and extremely tasty. Key lime pie goes great to follow -- for a cool down.

This turned out very well. I really like it as did my guests. Served it with a light green salad (citrusy dressing) and black beans (with fresh cilantro) and rice. So simple. Do be careful NOT to over cook. Used the leftover pork to make fried rice (spicy and good) and added asian 5 spice powder. Unusual and good!

im not sure why everyone left comments regarding the heat of this dish, i didnt think it was overly hot at all! ill admit i was a little skeptical at first, since im not really a fan of chipotle to begin with. i was planning on subbing in jalapeno, but at the last minute, i decided to try this recipe out as is. im glad i did because its really changed my opinion of the chipotle pepper. will DEFINITELY be making this again! (i actually have some sauce and peppers left over and am going to use it on some chicken tonight!)

This was great! You must have the guacamole, as it really balances the heat of the peppers. Don't bother with store bought guacamole - the real thing is so quick & easy! I made mine while the tenderloin was sitting for 15 minutes & stuck in the freezer for quick chilling. I used the January 1998 recipe from Gourmet. Highly recommend this recipe!

Really good. Next time, however, I will bank the coals and use more indirect heat as the first side really blackened up quickly with direct heat. The yogurt cumin seed sauce is so good. I am going to try it on other things. This recipe is so easy and fast -- it is a great work/school night dinner as well as equally good for guests.

Yum! I was worried about the hotness, due to earlier reviews, but I didn't find it so at all. I chose to make my own guacamole - I make it with an avocado, the juice of half a lime, and a heaping teaspoon of sour cream. As dairy is the best way to cool a burning mouth, I think that the guac had a lot to do with toning down the spiciness of the pork. Actually, I would normally add hot sauce to my guac, but didn't this time as it was meant as a cooling agent. Anyway - this was very tasty. We found that we needed to grill it for a good 1/2 hour to get it to the desired temperature, but other than that, I'd recommend following the recipe exactly. PS - I tied the tenderloin up with kitchen twine to keep the chopped chipotle in - thanks for that tip.

This was wonderful! It was very spicy, but we like that. I doubled the recipe and used the left-over pork and guacamole to make the best salad that I've eaten in a while. Tossed romaine, tomatoes, green onions, black olives and bell peppers lightly with olive oil and white wine vinegar; topped with cubed pork and guacamole.

This was simple, quick, and yummy. I tripled the sauce and added just a touch of honey. Served the extra sauce on the side for guests who needed to tame the heat a bit. To me it was just the right amount of heat. Served with Spanish rice and grilled corn.

This was simple to make and delicious. I'm normally not crazy about chipotle peppers, but it worked really well with the flavor of the pork. I wasn't impressed with the guacamole at the grocery store so I made my own and the guacamole is a key ingrediant to this great summer recipe.

This was fabulous -- and very easy. I made the full stuffing/marinade recipe but used only 1 tenderloin (for two people), and it came out perfectly. It's so full of complex smoky flavor that I served very simple sides -- boiled sweet corn and mildly seasoned couscous. I thought the spice level was heated but perfect, although I noticed that my fiance did scape some of the chipotle stuffing off the pork before eating it. This was elegant, delicious and easy, and I would definitely serve it to company. Two tips: for presentation and flavor, be sure to secure the stuffed loin with either kitchen twine or toothpicks. Also, to make it easier to finely chop the chipotles, I gently rinsed them off before chopping. Then I measured out the adobo sauce directly from the can. Yum!

Delicious and oh so easy to prepare. The chipotle flavor complements the pork tenderloin so well. The yogurt mixture added flavor and moisture. A great hot day (94 and humid here today) weekday dish.

Wow! Great smokey flavors that just had a perfect kick too. Followed the recipe exactly and loved it. Served w/ sliced avocado and black beans w/ a little crumbled goat cheese and Spanish rice... Yummy!

I have made this so many times for company and everyone always loves it. I add more peppers on the inside because, when cooked, they don't seem that hot.

This was only so-so as a main dish, but the leftovers were really good in tacos for lunch the next day. I'd make it again just to slice up for taco filling.

This is the best tenderloin recipe I have found...just the right amount of kick, Homemade guac adds just the right touch to temper the adobo.

I am allergic to chilis, but I made it moreor less the same way but stuffed with feta and spinach (why not) the yogurt sauce is great. I did tie with twine...

Loved it! I read that some people had difficulty with the pork staying together so I wrapped it in bacon and it was superb. I layed the bacon out, put the pork on top, wrapped the bacon strips and secured with toothpicks. It kepts it moist, and gave it a wonderful flavour!

the whole house loved the spicy/smokey flavor of this pork. Despite what others have said ours did not stay together and the peppers fell out on the grill. Will try a little twine next time but this dish is going into our regular rotation.

I made this for company and everyone loved it. Hot & spicy but really flavorful. I expected the tenderloins to come open on the grill, but they stayed together surprisingly well. Served with the recipe on this website for Mexican Rice (the one with Cilantro Dressing) ... nice compliment to the pork. This will become a favorite summer grill recipe.

the entire family raved on this one! Made exactly as the recipe indicated...but made homemade guacamole...which is always better.

This is a fantastic recipe. I made several of these for a party. I was sure I had made way too much, but there were no leftovers.

I don't think I did anything wrong in preparing this recipe as I have been cooking for 40 years. But this tasted absolutely disgusting. My husband and I threw it out after a few bites. I followed the recipe exactly and grilled it on the barbque. Yuck.

This recipe was so flavorful. I only used 1 pork tenderloin for our family of four, and cut off one end for the kids. Their end I marinated with the yogurt only so it wouldn't be spicy. We all loved it

Very, very good - we like heat but everyone here spooked us a bit - so I used some chopped roasted yellow peppers in addition to the chipotles - thought it would be a more colorful presentation too. But I am really surprised no one else mentioned having trouble with the tenderloin staying closed without tieing or skewering it. Ours kept coming open and consequently the peppers were dropping out of the meat into the fire, and by the time we were done they were totally butterflied again. They were delicious and tender, but because the meat didn't hold together our presentation for guests suffered a bit. Next time I will tie the tenderloins together after stuffing them.

This is so easy to prepare and is one of the best pork tenderloin recipies I've made! The pork is so tender and bursting with flavor. I've made it several times. There has never been even a morsel left when dinner's done.

This is one of the best pork tenderloin recipes I have ever tried. The yogurt coating keeps it very moist and tempers the heat of the chipotle stuffing. I turned it often and kept basting - it was superb.

This is awesome! It is very hot but so good. We are going to make sandwiches out of the left overs tonight. I am definitely going to make this again!

My husband said this is one of the best things I have ever made. it is quite spicy, which we love. Those who don't like hot things may want to hold back on the amount of peppers used.

I loved the concept of the basic flavors in this recipe but wanted to make it more substantial. I modified this recipe substantially and got high marks from my guests. I made a stuffing using: 1 small can of chipolte chilis in adobo sauce 8 slices of sourdough bread - crumbs 12 baby sweet bell peppers (grilled) 1/2 lg red onion 1 bunch cilantro 2 garlic cloves Combine all ingredients into food processor until wet fine stuffing mix Marinade 1 large plain yogurt juice of 4 limes 1/2 can chipolte with adobo sauce 10 roasted/grilled baby sweet peppers 2-3 tsp cumin 1 tbsp olive oil 3-4 garlic cloves Puree and marinate 1 large pork loin (instead of tenderloin) (7 lbs)for 24 hours prior to stuffing Stuff loin and Grill per regular recipe Serves 14-18

This was very quick and easy, while still delivering big flavor and requests for seconds from my husband. I'll use this recipe for both weeknight dinners and for company. I served it with a salad of sweet corn, tomatoes, & cilantro from this site. All recipes were nutritious and diet-friendly. I did substitute low-fat yogurt for whole milk yogurt in the marinade with no perceptable ill effects.

This was a wonderful recipe. I substituted ground cumin instead of cumin seed. I served it with carmelized onions and green peppers. Definitely a keeper.

This is an awesome recipe that has immediately found its way into my regular rotation. I doubled up on the yogurt mixture so that I would have enough for two tenderloins, but I still had some left at the end. The dish had some nice heat to it, but not as much as I was expecting considering chipotles were being used, (this could just be from the brand of chiles though).

We had a small rib end pork loin roast that we cooked on the rotisserie basting it regularly with the yogurt/adobe sauce mixture. It was wonderfaul.

I made this as soon as I received my July BA...I halved the recipe since I made it just for myself + leftovers. I like spicy, but it was really too spicy (not that I didn't eat it! :-) for me. I'm sure I will make it again, probably reducing the chipoltes a bit. One general note - I have found that the "heat" in chipoltes in adobe sauce differs considerably from can to can. It seems that the longer I've had it in my pantry the hotter it becomes, which would make sense I guess.

This was really good and very easy to prepare. The pork was tender and flavourful. I thought it was the perfect spiciness, but I like really spicy -- my husband thought it was a bit too hot. We ate it the first night as a taco filling, but the next day, it was even better in a sandwich with some panfried halloumi cheese. Fantastic.

I made this with thick-cut pork chops instead of tenderloin, with no ill effects. It was very tasty -- chipotle and pork are made for each other. One caveat: the suggested accompaniments make for kind of an eerie, '70s color scheme on the plate. I don't normally care about such things, but it was pretty marked.

Very good, easy and pretty presentation! Worth making the guacamole from scratch. Also, used lowfat yogurt.
