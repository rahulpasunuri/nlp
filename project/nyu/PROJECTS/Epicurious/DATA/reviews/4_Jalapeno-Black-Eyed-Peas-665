I am from Arkansas, and I have been eating and cooking black-eyed peas most of my life. My grandfather always used Cavender's, so when I saw this recipe, I figured I should give it a try. The only real reason I made it is because I was having a New Year's Day black-eyed pea party, and some vegans were coming, and this looked easy enough to make vegan by substituting vegetable broth. I also saute the onions for a little while, then add the jalapenos and lastly add the garlic just until fragrant. Then I add the peas, the broth and the Cavender's. These were really good, and I have been making them now for years, especially when I want a lighter version without ham. So glad I stumbled onto this recipe!

These are crazy good! And the left-overs, if there are any, are great to snack with corn chips. I'll make these again!!

My new go-to! This was delicious and SPICY y'all - and we love spicy. I mixed in a few tablespoons of pasta sauce (very basic homemade tomato/basil/garlic sauce) with my bowl - mellowed the heat from the jalapenos and rounded out the flavor. I just realized I forgot to add the pimientos. Don't know how necessary they are - this was excellent without them.

Easy and good, I did not know what to do with the jalapeno chilies so I added them whole as I have seen them do in mexico, since some were red from the garden I added an extra one. Husband ate this every day till it was gone- will make this again.

I love this recipe! I couldn't find the Greek Seasoning, but after a quick Google search, I found a recipe that mimics the flavor: Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning Subsitute: 2 t salt, 1 t pepper, 2 t basil, 2 t oregano, 1 t parsley, 1 t rosemary, 1/2 t thyme, 2 t garlic powder, 1 t dill, 1 t marjoram, 1 t cornstarch, 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg. I had all the seasonings except the marjoram, so I omitted it. The aroma of the seasonings was great, and though I can't speak to it's authenticity, I loved it in the recipe!

Made this on New Year's Day and it was yummy served with Mexican cornbread and pico de gallo. A real hit.

Easy, flavorful, and great with tortillas.

With just enough kick, these peas are a nice change from those seasoned with ham or bacon. From now on I intend to use this recipe when cooking black-eyed peas.

These are wonderful black-eyed peas. I make them at least once a month.

Hoo-whee, those holler-peen-yos add jes the right touch! But honey chiles, y'all don't need to soak them black-eye peas. They's peas, not beans. Jes bring em to boilin, then put the lid on & simmer em down bout an hour. Less if'n you likes em firm an more if'n you likes em mushy. We ain't heared of no Cavenders down here, but we does like that Mrs. Dash.

I made this for a Thanksgiving luncheon and was told by a 75-year-old gentleman that they were as good as his Mama's. Here in the South, there is no higher praise!

We made a couple of variations on this recipe, and it was great. We used fresh black eyed peas (you don't have to soak them). We also cubed 1/2 pound of salt pork and rendereded it and added to the beans before cooking (simply for good luck at New Years). We didn't have the Greek seasoning so we added ground cumin and cinnamon to taste. We will definately repeat this recipe for next New Years.

List of ingredients sends us to the super for yet another seasoning. It disappoints when alternative seasonings are not mentioned. My cupboard teems with seasoning bottles.
