This actually made about 4 so-so cupcakes for me. The frosting was drippier than expected and a less-than-desirable color. Of course, they were still tasty, but cupcakes are all about presentation

I love these cupcakes! These were delicious, light, and moist, not at all dry. Made them twice during thanksgiving weekend. Nice change from regular vanilla/chocolate cupcakes. Second time around i added walnuts which were a nice touch. I also sprinkled the cupcakes with chopped dried cranberries which made them look even better. Will definitely make again.

These cupcakes were very good and moist, not at all dry. The only thing I would change, is to add much more maple syrup to the cream cheese frosting. I got many compliments, even from the kids!

The cupcake was very dry. I think the taste of nutmeg was too strong. I was disappointed-I put them on my dessert buffet for Thanksgiving. No one seemed to like them.

I was a bit apprehensive about making this recipe as it reads as if an ingredient may be missing, but they turned out moist and delicious. Next time I will forego the nutmeg, as I am not a big fan. I might try adding walnuts next time as well.
