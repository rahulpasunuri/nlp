This is now a holiday staple in our house! My family loves those hidden tastes. Haven't changed a thing.

This is a really good recipe. I make the pie with Mango instead of banana. Delicious.

Absolutely awesome and so easy to make! Consistency was perfect. I had no issues with the pie setting up, using quality ingredients and preparing the recipe as written.

I have been making this pie every year since it first was printed. I wish they would show the author's name so I could thank her/him. It is a favorite in my home

I wasn't happy with the consistency of this pie -- a little sloppy to serve despite having followed the recipe to a T and letting it set for 6-8 hours.

A few suggestions to make this easier: ( I) When it comes to do the assembly, whip the cream first so that you can whip the Philly afterwards without washing the beaters. ( II ) Add the rum to the Philly. Three reasons: 1. cream will whip up MUCH faster without becoming buttery, as the rum makes the cream much more difficult to stiffen and takes SO much longer. 2. adding rum to the Philly makes that combination easier to beat together. 3. If the Philly mix is smoother, it will fold into the whipped cream more readily. ( III ) Next time I would use light brown sugar instead of dark brown in the filling so that it is lighter in colour - not as muddy looking. I used paper-thin slices of banana on the bottom and put another paper- thin layer in the middle of the filling. Pie will be served in about 6 hours. I'll report again then ...

Fantastic! This pie is a new favorite in our household. It has surpassed all other dessert pies and could easily become a "dangerous" leftover, i.e. take no prisoners and consume all at once. I agree with other reviews, increasing the amount of rum (doubling) makes this the perfect pie.

This was very good, but one diner thought it was too heavy on the rum. When served next to chocolate pecan pie and lemon meringue pie, it came in third, so I will probably find some better competition next time I make pies. It was quite simple to make, so that is a plus.

I am not sure if I did something wrong as I have never made this sort of pie before - but my pie did not set - maybe I didn't use thick enough cream (used Thick not Double Cream) - albeit, this pie was still very scrumptious and would definitely make again (can anyone tell me if it is supposed to set like a cheesecake????)

This is quite tasty, and definitely a different take on the regular old banana cream pie, which makes it fantastic! I couldn't give it 4 forks because I needed to add more rum. My variations: -More rum, -cayenne powder, -mash the bananas and incorporate into the mixture, -about 4-6T coconut milk.

Quite tasty, though the rum did impart a certain "saltiness" that I absolutely-positively HAD to counteract with an additional 1/4 cup of sugar in the filling. I know nothing of curry (and neither does my spice cabinet), so I substituted 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper in the crust, which turned out great; it imparted that elusive *heat* that cayenne can bring to baked goods without revealing its true identity. One problem, though: the filling would not stay put in any coherent pie form! The stuff just ran everywhere, making for a really unattractive presentation. Maybe it was the Neufchatel I had on hand instead of full-fat cream cheese. Good thing I just made it for myself; sometimes it doesn't matter if the food's ugly, especially when it uses up the extra bananas and rum... ;-)

I made this for a cookout yesterday and followed the advice of the reviewers- I doubled the rum. I thought the rum taste was a little too present, but then again, I used cheap rum, so maybe that was the culprit. I think a dash of banana extract might help because the banana taste seemed a little muted to me. Also, I made it the night before and refrigerated it, let it sit at room temperature for 2 hours the day of and the pie was fine. It got rave reviews from everyone!

I cut some fat corners, using 1/3 less fat cream cheese & low-fat graham crackers. Didn't skimp on the butter or cream, though. Instead of slicing bananas I mashed four extremely ripe medium-sized bananas and folded into the cream cheese mixture prior to folding in the whipped cream. As a result it was a looser consistency but yummy in its uniformly banana-cream flavor. Guests tasted the curry right off and savored the rum taste as well. I thought it was just ok but my dinner-mates were swooning. Guess I'll make it again!

Double the amount of rum and this becomes the best pie EVER!!!

Rating: 2
Pretty good. I'd like to make it again without goofing. If you double the rum be sure you can do the math (i.e., 8 teaspoons does not equal 3.5 tablespoons)! Doh! Added a little more sugar to the whipped cream/rum mixture, and mixed with the cream cheese mixture over perfect bananas, it was still pretty good.

The best pie I've ever made.

Add twice as much rum as the recipe calls for and this pie becomes pure perfection. It is by far one of my favorites.

This was a wonderful, easy pie. Although I couldn't definitively taste the curry in the crust, it had a nice complex taste compared to a regular graham crust. I used only two bananas, sandwiched between the cream layers, and I forgot to sprinkle graham crumbs on top. I was going to add a drizzle of melted chocolate, but I'm glad I didn't. It would have masked all the other great flavors.

I used more rum -- about 3 1/2 tablespoons. Yum, rum! Also, be sure to follow the directions for the crust very carefully. I accidentally put all of the brown sugar in instead of saving most of it for the cream. Delicious! And use all four bananas. Trust me, there's room.

This is a great way to have whipped cream on fruit! We were short 2 bananas, so I used an equal volume of cherries instead. Wow!! It tasted wonderful with both fruits. Ill use peaches next time with bananas. I also used a traditional flour/shortening pie crust, with the curry. It worked out nicely.

This pie is wonderful. You don't taste the rum or the curry, but the flavor certainly is more complex than the average banana cream pie. It got mad praise at our Father's Day dinner yesterday. It's simply awesome.

Everyone pretty much agree's it needs more rum , instead of a dark rum i used malibu rum for its coconut island flavor plus added a little banana liquor to it as well. I made a small amount of custard to fold in with the cheese and cream.

Rating: 4
Unbelievable recipe; "voluptuous" is the perfect word to describe this pie. I used Captain Morgan's spiced rum in lieu of dark rum. My one suggestion is to somehow bridge the cream filling with the bananas, either by mixing the slices in with the filling, or by adding some banana extract to the filling.

This recipe was so easy! I didn't have Madras curry so I used an Indian curry with a lot of chili flavor. Like the other reviewers I added 6 tsp of rum instead of four so it was a nice balance to the spiciness of the crust.

Rating: 4
This pie is AMAZING! I added a little more butter and 1 more graham cracker as well adding 6 "heaping" teaspoons of Rum. Booze and the fat from the cream cheese/whipping cream makes this the best banana cream pie I have EVER had! I also did layers of bananas between the filling. When your guests are speechless, its a good review!

I made this pie and brought it as dessert to some friends' house. I really like curry, so I decided to sprinkle a little over the top of the pie instead of the remainder of the crumbs. It gave it more of a kick than if I was to just leave it in the crust. It was an interesting combination of flavors. I used 6 tsp of dark rum instead of the 4. I am glad I did because I could barely taste the 6. My friends really enjoyed it but did comment that it was so rich that they could only have a small piece. I definitely agreed. I only used 3 of the bananas and wished that I would have used the 4th one as well as it would have evened out the flavor a bit more. Overall, very yummy recipe (especially for a large group of people!)

I really loved this easy recipe. The crust was especilly good. As other reviewers suggested, I added coconut to the crust, and also, to the filling. I used 6 teaspoons of rum, you got a good rum flavor, but not overpowering.

Really, really good. Super easy to make. A nice twist on a classic pie. I did not notice the curry powder at all. Would think about perhaps adding a dusting on top with the extra crumbs. I increased the rum to 6 teaspoons and could taste a hint of it. I sprinkled the sliced bananas with juice from the lemon I used for the zest to prevent browning in the fridge. It added a nice extra bit of acidity to cut through the richness of the cream. A new favourite recipe!

This is so easy and quick. I was worried about the curry but it was wonderful. My family loved this. This pie will be a new tradition for us!

This was super easy and delicious. I followed the hints of other reviews and added coconut to the crust, and also added (quite a bit) more rum. The hubby loved it! and despite not being a banana fan, I even loved it too. :)

I made this for a potluck and it was a huge hit. Easy to make, and the curry powder gave a new depth of flavor. The next day I had to photocopy the recipe for my friends. Will definitely make again.

This was pretty simple and I enjoyed it, but I don't think it was really amazing. The curry added an interesting twist in the crust and the cream topping was nice--but again, not amazing. And the rum was hardly noticeable.

Delicious, and definitely better after chilling. Agree it needs more run (and yes, dark run - which is readily available even in the hinterlands of the US, wiill give it a stronger taste). Husband LOVED it.

Wow, I loved the smooth texture of this pie, and the subtle flavors of the curry, rum and lemon zest. I used Captain Morgans Spiced Rum and although I could detect it's flavor with just the cream, I really could not taste it much as a finished product. I think that it's flavor is there and adds to the overall "yumminess", but if I really wanted to taste the rum, I may add more. I just swiped the last leftover piece from the frig. It only gets better after chilling a while. yum!

I am in complete disaggreement with the first review. I am Canadian so have access to DARK Cuban rum. That makes a BIG difference. Next time I will use LESS rather than more rum. Easy to make, very rich and very good. I have a question though, can the pie be refrigerated? I think it would be better cold, but daren't because of the bananas.

I would add more rum than called for. I put in 4 t. as directed, but my husband and I couldn't detect the flavor.

Sprinkled half of pie with reserved crumbs and left other half "unadorned." Preferred texture of "unadorned" half.
