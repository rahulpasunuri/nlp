Easy and really good. Everyone raved about it. I quadrupled the recipe for a crowd of 8 and had leftovers, so I suspect the recipe as is would be more than enough for 3 or even 4 as a side. It would be delicious as the center of the meal with some simple grilled chicken or fish (or as a vegan entree with some chick peas). I added more vinegar to give it more zip, and cooked the couscous in the usual 1c. of couscous to 2c water way. And in response to some earlier posters, cilantro and coriander are the same thing!

Tried this first when having company over. It was a hit with family and company. Served it at room temperature. Replaced wine vinegar with lemon juice and followed directions on package for liquid and couscous ratio. Yum. I have made it twice since then with complements each time. It is quick and easy!!

This was very good. Also used lemon juice and fresh cilantro. And more garlic.

So delicious--I make it as often as possible especially when guests are dining with us. My only advice would be to make a lot because people will eat it up and you will want leftovers!!

I doubled this and it was a lot of salad but SO GOOD. I used chicken broth to cook the couscous and actually got double the corn from only 2 ears. I used fresh cilantro instead of the coriander sprigs. It's one of those dishes where you'll have two helpings but still keep nibbling at it.

Good recipe, I made it in a pinch and served it warm, I added some cherry tomatoes to it. I also used parsley. Fairly good, I am anxious to try it cold.

We thought this was very good. As to an earlier comment on clumping... I've found a lot of variety in couscous brands. My favorite is Marrakesh Express sold in Quaker Oats type cannisters. I've bought other name brands that are very clumpy. So, don't give up if your first attempt clumps. With the right brand couscous never fails.

This was really good. I used less oil and lime juice instead of the vinegar. It's a great side to make ahead. I served it cold. It was a hit.

I l-o-v-e this recipe but it took a couple times making it to get it down. I skipped the vinegar and juiced one lime. Added an extra clove of garlic, used my microplane so it permeated the dish (and it's easier :) ). And any time it called for water, I used chicken broth. One thing I did notice was the preparation of the couscous just didn't work, it would get clumpy and sticky. So I just followed the directions on the box (3/4c. couscous to 1 c. broth), was enough couscous for me. And I alway add grape tomatoes sliced in half.

This is a GREAT couscous recipe! I really enjoyed it!! I can't wait to make it again. It tasted great with or without the vinegar (I used balsamic), cold or hot. I might add more salt next time though. The cilantro (make sure you use the fresh kind) and corn are excellent in this dish. You can adjust the proportions of the veggies to taste/appearance. I felt so fresh eating this!

I thought this dish was a little bland. The couscous seemed to detract from the lovely sweet taste of the fresh corn. I'll make a different couscous salad recipe next time--this one just didn't thrill me.

We found this quite tasty, but I did do some changes. Cooked the couscous in chick broth with mexican oregano. Used more garlic and substituted lime juice for the vinegar. Finshed with some cotija cheese. Tons of flavor.

Quite tasty and relatively simple. Most time spent with vegetable cutting & prep. Magnified the recipe to serve as a main course for a hungry 6. Would say that the red wine vinegar/olive oil dressing at the end isn't really necessary. Next time, I'll make without. All in all, easy, scrumptious & good for you!

Great tailgate or picnic recipe. Make it the day before so it has time to chill. Great flavor!

My husband and I thought this dish lacked flavor. I was expecting savory, but the corn and bell pepper gave a definite sweetness. I used the large-grain couscous but I think I would have liked the small-grain better.

Simply splendiferous! I used the large grain couscous (from Israel or Greece). I browned the couscous slightly in some olive oil then added !/4 pkg of Goya Sazon with saffron to the water. I was careful to steam the corn so that it was slighly underdone. I also added grape tomatoes. It got rave reviews two days in a row, with many comments about the sweet corn making it particularly good.

Very tasty and from my understanding, I believe that fresh coriander, chinese parsley and cilantro are all synonymous terms for the same plant. Coriander is the cilantro seed.

I have not yet made this dish, but plan to tomorrow. I just wanted to comment on some of the other reviewers' problems with finding coriander in their markets. I use cilantro instead of coriander when a recipe calls for it because this is a widely available herb (found near the parsley) and I think it is similar in flavor. I hope this helps!

Easy to do. Very tasty, try it with orzo.

As another reader pointed out, you can't go wrong with this one. It's delicious. I couldn't get fresh coriander, but used 1 tablespoon of finely chopped mint leaves mixed with 3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley. A completely different flavour I'm sure, but it still had that freshness that coriander gives.

I was looking for a way to use corn on the cob that was already cooked and adapted this recipe. I sauted the onion, bell pepper and cumin and added a little water and the corn when red pepper was crisp-tender. Skipped the garlic because of a guest's personal preference but plan to add it next time. Added couscous, per recipe, which I happened to have as a leftover. Didn't have fresh coriander on hand so used a little dried. Like another reviewer, it makes more than it says and is excellent leftover and can be served warm or cold.

Great recipe, although I changed a few things around to suit my tastes: I used chicken stock instead of water, and left out the oil/vinegar dressing. I tripled the recipe for a party, and the dish was well-received by everyone, even really picky eaters like me!

Great recipe! I've made it about 3 or 4 times and tripled the recipe each time to ensure leftovers (I think it tastes better the next day giving all the flavors a chance to settle and "get to know" each other). I can never seem to find coriander so I substitute fresh spinach instead (the bag in the salad section works fine) and it turns out great. One thing I started adding that makes this even better in my opinion is freshly grated parmesan cheese (you can buy the small tubs in the cheese/dairy section). I add it at the very end while it is still warm to allow it to melt a little. I never really measured how much I put, but if I had to guess with my tripled recipe I'd say anywhere from 1/2 to 3/4 cup. I love cheese (I give the people at Olive Garden forearm cramps when they ask if I want grated cheese on my dish), so do it to taste and I'm sure it will turn out just fine.

This is my favorite Gourmet recipe. I make it every summer, almost every week. I always add more red pepper, corn and onion for more texture and flavor, and substitute parsley for coriander.

This recipe was very good but I think the serving size suggestion is not accurate. I tripled the recipe so I would have enough for 5 people as a side dish. I figured I would have only a little left over, but I ended up with 6 cups left over! Fortunately we loved it and didn't mind eating the leftovers for the next few days.

I accidently bought basil instead of coriander but it turned out terrific! Best to have really fresh corn. The second time I made it I think the corn was less fresh, and maybe I was a bit careless in measuring ingredients, but it wasn't as good.

A definite keeper. Good warm, cold or at room temperature. I have made this many times and plan to make it many more. Use chicken stock instead of water for more flavor.

This is a consistent good recipe. Ditto most of the other comments ... as a slight variation, consider adding a touch of fresh lime juice, which adds a bit of a kick that complements the southwestern nature of this recipe.

This has become my signature recipe -- I made it once and now my family has me make a quadrupled batch of it every week. It keeps well and is great for lunches, besides being a wonderful mix of colors and textures for dinner. I cook the couscous in chicken broth for more flavor, and sometimes add chicken strips sauteed in butter and rosemary for a heartier main dish. You can't go wrong with this one.

I used reduced fat chicken stock instead of water. It adds a lot more flavor. This recipe has been a hit with family and friends!

What a delightful alternative to rice or potatoes! The cumin and coriander make a fantastic combination and the vegetables make a beautiful presentation. This was quick, colorful and tasty - great for any meal.

This dish is absolutely delicious! Light and simple but very flavorful--I've passed it on to several friends, and it has become a regular for all of them. Though casual, it is very pretty. Great for a casual supper or picnic. Keeps well, too, and is good hot or cold.
