I am SO skeptical of bad reviews, but I have to say that the reviews I read for this receipe were pretty spot on. The cream sauce was too creamy and the overall dish lacked flavor. IF I make it again, I'd add some dill and maybe wrap it all in rice paper and make it into a spring roll.

Great recipe, boyfriend loved it. Light and refreshing, a perfect summer dish. I left out the tarragon and it was still fabulous. I plan to share this with my friends and family!

My husband I loved this recipe. I tasted the sauce and decided to add half again the ingredients. I served it with whole wheat linguini and as I cooked the shrimp threw in the sauce and broccoli (left out the bitter arugula) and steamed the rest of the broccoli. If I were doing it again, I would have cooked the 3 bunches of fresh broccoli florets with the shrimp, I only used greek yogurt for the yogurt and sour cream and went very light on the tarragon.

I think this recipe could be saved by halving the dressing ingredients... it was simply too saucy. And a bit too tart, but I did skimp on the sugar. I would probably not make this again, but if I did, I would make it quite differently.

I probably should have known that this recipe wouldn't do too much for me, but I had a pound of frozen shrimp to use up and decided to give it a try. The flavors were all very light and fresh with the lemon juice and the fresh herbs, but there was just a lacking depth of flavor for me. I think I will try a more traditional (and not as healthy) Thai sauce over the leftovers tonight.

I tried this for guests and it was a big hit. The yogurt based sauce made it creamy but not too filling.

I loved this recipe, but then again I eat quite healthfully. My boyfriend on the other hand didn't care for it. This makes a great summer night meal and it was really quick to make. I would make this again. The only change I made was substituting splenda for sugar.

I used Lemon flavored non fat yogurt, as I did not have plain. I subsituted steamed Spinanch and Brocolli and used angle hair pasta. It was delicious,I will make this again using fresh spinach as I have a hard time finding aruglua.

This recipe was only okay for me. I made it as directed. The flavors didn't meld as well as I would have guessed. One recommendation, be overly careful about getting the shrimp, broccoli, and noodles dry before using. Even a little extra moisture makes the whole thing too wet.

I made this recipe, skipping the broccoli and sugar. I purchased organic baby arugula, and the results were fantastic. My Aunt Anna who is a diabetic absolutely loved it and did not deviate from her diet.

This recipe is light, bright & creamy -perfect for summer. I used 8 oz. wheat angel hair pasta instead of the tofu noodles. I think it makes more than the 4 servings. We ate the leftovers the next day with a little more fresh lemon juice and it was equally as yummy. I'll be making this throughout the summer.

Very light and yummy. If you make it ahead of time, i'd recommend leaving the arugula out, to keep it fresh. I also blanched the broccoli in salted boiling water instead of using it raw.
