Definitely definitely try this recipe! It was so easy. I didn't have a thermometer that went up to 240, mine stopped at 200, so I estimated the temp. I also used cornstarch instead of potato. They turned out perfectly and everyone was super impressed. I brought them to a campfire party with homemade graham crackers and some chocolate.

I honestly don't know how I managed to go my whole life without learning how to make marshmallows. They're just so easy. I must say that I was a little intimidated by the whole thing. But I wound up making 3 batched just because it was soooo easy! By the third one I didn't quite have enough sugar left, so I added some brown sugar instead. And I don't own a candy thermometer, but 8 minutes cooks the corn syrup mixture perfectly. Soon I'll be a regular old pro at the whole marshmallow game. These will be a hit at the BBQ tomorrow in s'mores!

Yummy, creamy, melt in your mouth sweetness...and so easy! I look forward to making them again. The only change I made was substituting cornstarch for the potato starch. It's only used at the end to coat them - and either type will do just fine. I made the marshmallows at night so I left them uncovered about 10 hours before removing from the pan. The aluminum foil peeled off with no problem and I found them easy to cut with just a chef knife coated in vegetable oil. One note about the vanilla extract: the reason many recommend using high quality is because the marshmallow taste exactly like whatever your extract tastes like. Also, the vanilla flavor is extremely strong so don't increase the amount of it. I made this recipe in a 9x9 pan and it created over 60 1"x1" cubes.

Failsafe. I mistakenly cooked the sugar to 280 instead of 240, and the marshmallows still turned out perfectly. I cut the potato starch to 1/4 cup and increased the powdered sugar to 3/4 cup and they are perfect. Not starchy, just right. Can't wait to try them again using an 8 x 8 pan, and dipping them in melted chocolate would be PERFECT!

When I saw the little amount that this recipe produced, I used a brownie pan instead of a 9x13. I ended up making 3 recipes of it to get the amount of marshmallows I needed. The recipe was fine, but I felt as though the pan size was incorrect.

Reviewed previously, but want to add that shaking 'mallows in a large baggie with sugar/starch mixture is a good alternative. It coats well and removes the excess starch/sugar mixture easily.

Tasty. I used an 11x7x2 inch pan and made 1.5 inch cube marshmallows. Anyone know why the recipe calls for a metal pan? My baking dishes are all Pyrex. I used foil (and cut the squares with an oiled pizza wheel) but would prefer to skip disposable foil.

These make wonderful gifts with a homemade cocoa mix in a pretty container. This is our second year making these wonderful little pillows of goodness. Cutting has been a problem in the past. This year we decided to spray the top of the marshmallows lightly with cooking spray and turning out onto a plastic sheet. Cut with a sprayed pizza cutter. These are really very easy to make and will be certain to certain to become a family tradition during the holiday season.

These were great! I envisioned dealing with a sticky mess but turned out easier than expected. Glad I followed the suggestions to beat the mixture less than called for - at 7 minutes it was quite stiff.

Yes! You can use honey instead of corn syrup (it's function is to prevent the crystallization of the sugar as your cooking it, and honey does the same). It also gives it a more complex flavor if you use different types of honey. Also, to give it a kick, add some spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. Delicious!

These are great, so much better than store bought. Store marshmallows lack the flavor and texture. I will not buy store marshmallows again. These even roast better with a crispier shell and hold up better to the heat when roasting. Ended up with extra starch-sugar coating mixture than needed, it can easily be halved to reduce waste. Before storing/roasting make sure to dust off the excess coating mixture.

To the Cook from Ottawa, I usually use agar-agar as a substitute for gelatin in my recipes, but I haven't tried it in this one so I'm not sure how it would go. Everything Molly Wizenberg writes is always tasty and almost always easy to make. I usually read her first when I get my BA copy every month.

Why would you rate this one star, and say that you added more than twice the given amount of an ingredient? These were delicious, and easy to make with a stand mixer. I used a high quality vanilla, and in one batch bloomed the gelatin in lemon juice, and subbed 1 t lemon extract for 1 t of the vanilla. Using a stand mixer, it takes much less time to get them to a proper consistency - I would say less than 5 minutes, easily. The texture should be just denser than marshmallow fluff. I've also dipped these in chocolate and they were wonderful. I use confectioner's sugar for the coating, without any potato starch. I recommend using a hot knife, or a slightly wet knife (or a wet knife with some confectioner's sugar on it) to cut the marshmallows, since the first time I made these I used nonstick spray and it left a bit of a residue where it cut and didn't seem to make it much easier. I'm glad to add these to my repertoire!

First attempt was a big fat FAIL, due to my sugar syrup amberizing before reaching 240 degrees. adding it to the gelatin was a nightmare, it basically solidified to the point where i couldn't get the spatula out of the mixing bowl. regrouped and tried again, paying better attention to the sugar syrup and using a smaller saucepan. SUCCESS! the final product was everything a marshmallow should be: light, fluffy, decadent, with a wonderful bite. Amazing in hot chocolate. making another big batch to distribute with xmas gifts.

This is a great and easy recipe, even without the stand mixer. I changed it to one tsp of vanilla and one tsp of almond extract. They were perfect with homemade hot cocoa.

Fabulous! It is amazing how fluffy and delicious these marshmallows turn out -- they are as light and airy as clouds. I did not use the corn syrup (due to corn allergies in my family). Instead, I made the syrup from scratch. In hindsight, this seems like a redundant step.

Instead of potato starch, I just took 1/2 cup each of granulated sugar and confectioners sugar and ran them through the food processor for a minute to make a superfine mixed sugar. Outstanding! First time I've made marshmallows, but it won't be the last!

Can anyone make a suggestion for a substitution for the gelatin??

These were amazing! Very easy to make. I lightly coated the top of the marshmallows w/ cooking spray so I was able to get a smooth surface when I put them in the pan. They stuck to my spatula even with the water on it. I thought they were better from the fridge. I drizzled chocolate w/ pretzels or toffee and the were a big hit. I cannot wait to make again. Thought I might sub Kaluha for the Vanilla and some cocoa powder. Coffee marshmallows sound good.

I love this recipe!!! I found it in Gourmet a few months ago & have been making marshmallows @ least every 2 weeks since!!! It's also easy to experiment with different flavors as well. For example, I used 1 c. of fresh lemon / lime juice plus its zest to bloom the gelatin in lieu of water, then followed the rest of the recipe to make Citrus Marshmallows...

Excellent recipe that works extremely well. I found that it's OK to use granulated sugar in place of the potato starch. The powdered sugar contains corn starch, so the starch purpose is met. I thought the potato starch was a little off- putting for the coating taste. Instead, I sifted equal quantities of 10x and granulated sugar in a wide bowl. Don't be too fussy about the exact amount. Just have enough to make the coating an easy part of the process. As I cut strips of the marshmallow, I rolled the cut edges in the coating. I then placed the smaller pieces back in the coating to coat the newly cut sides. In one batch, I replaced the vanilla with 1 Tbsp of lemon emulsion -- really wonderful taste. I used a 9x9 pan as I wanted larger marshmallows and didn't need a high yield.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! I dipped them in chocolate (using the recipe for Double Dipped Strawberries on epicurious), put them in the fridge for an hour, and they were perfect. Big hit as a Valentine's Day gift. I did not use a candy thermometer, just cooked it on the stove for 8 minutes and it came out perfectly. I also just used powdered sugar instead of potato flour; no problems. The pizza cutter worked well and I agree that high-quality vanilla is key (frankly, gelatin is kind of funky and you need the vanilla for a nice aroma and flavor). Next time I might add a little orange or peppermint extract. I might also spread them out over more pan space - the 9x12 pan makes very thick marshmallows.

Thanks for all the reviews- very helpful. Made another recipe twice, beat as required & ended up with nougat! I know now not to beat so long with my Kitchen Aid stand mixer.

Worked out great.

Love this recipe, have made it several times in the past week. I have found that the fluffiest marshmallows come out using Knox brand gelatin, versus some off brand from the store. I'm not sure why, but that was my experience in the 4 times I have made them. Leaving them out overnight is fine, I have done it all 4 times. Also, cutting them into large squares, putting them on popsicle sticks, and coating them in chocolate and decorating them with white chocolate makes them simply yummy and fun for gifts.

I made these for Christmas gifts. Easy recipe to follow, tastes great, but it was messy. The only non-stick spray I had was butter flavored, so I used veg. oil instead. The foil stuck terribly to the marshmallow so I won't do that again. Didn't have potato starch, so I used corn starch. Seemed to work fine. Must use good vanilla extract.

I never write reviews, but I have to say these turned out perfectly. I had made a different recipe previously that involved egg whites and the texture was just wrong. These were wonderful, spongy, and dry. As someone else mentioned, I wasn't quite sure they were thick enough - but when they dried they were exactly right. My Kitchenaid mixer took only about 6 minutes to get them to the right consistency. You want it to be like marshmallow creme or fluff - then you'll know they're beaten enough. I added a little peppermint extract and will dip them in dark chocolate for holiday gifts - plus some are going into chocolate ice cream.

These weren't as bad to make as I anticipated. I'd like to try another batch without the potato starch - I think it gave them a really chalky texture. I'm going to dip them in chocolate to hopefully mask the chalkiness. Overall - easy and pretty tasty. I think it's fun to say you made your own 'mallows, too!

These were easy to make and beautiful. I did keep them in the pan overnight because I made them late, and the top was dry and shiny, but I was able to peel them off the foil with no problem, and they cut fine, and once I tossed them in the sugar/potato starch mixture they were perfect!

Made these for Fourth of July BBQ. Adults and kids went nuts over them. They were very easy to make although a bit messy. Wasn't certain the texture was correct until they had dried. Once I tasted them, I was confident they came out according to the recipe. Making them as Christmas gifts tomorrow. Kahlua-flavored and Grand Marnier-flavored for the adults and Madagascar Vanilla Bean for the kids. Can't wait to try these in Hot Cocoa... Enjoy!

This was my first time with this recipe, and they turned out great. The only issue was that I used a hand-held mixer instead of a standing one, and after about 10 minutes of mixing, the marshmallow took control of the situation- climbing up the mixer, crawling out of the bowl- and as it stiffened it took a lot of effort to keep the bowl from flying off the table. So I pretty much had to stop mixing after 10 mins, and I think the extra 5 would have made the marshmallows even fluffier. But still, they are light, fluffy, and delicious. Couldn't find potato starch even in the Kosher section, so I just used all-purpose flour (same amount) and it worked well- not enough adheres to the marshmallow to affect the taste, in my opinion. And thanks for the wet pizza slicer idea- that worked great!

These are amazing!!! Will definitely make them over and over. We made them for a fondue party and they were great dipped in chocolate fondue. They are also delicious in a cup of hot chocolate because they become almost creamy as they melt... yum!

these turned out great! a lot of fun to make, and easy too. can't find corn syrup here, so used wheat syrup instead (sirop de ble), and it worked great! i want to try it with brown rice syrup next time. and will also try it with flavorings! used a glass baking pan and had no problems with it. oh, and also used leaf gelatin instead of powdered gelatin, which also worked just fine.

OK I accidentally made these at 4 am and put 2 cups of light corn syrup instead of 2/3 cup. They produced very dense marshmellows which tasted, well, like ordinary marshmellows. Does anyone know if I made it coorrectly would the texture be airy and light?

I've made a couple of variations with this recipe and even successfully turned one batch into a couple different flavors: pistachio (pistachio paste - lovely green!), lemon (lemon zest and juice - tasted like a lemon meringue pie bite), chocolate (forgot to sift the cocoa powder.. silly me), of course vanilla, and pink mint (mint oil and food color). Easiest recipe out there. After you've made it a few times you can just wing it on sugar temperature, but I have to say the potato starch is the KEY to getting the little suckers to stay separated.

The article that accompanied this recipe was great and the marshmallows are amazing.

Fun! Fun! Fun! Made these yesterday, didn't have a candy thermometer so I cooked the syrup to the soft ball stage (it took 8 minutes). The s'mores sounded good; I crushed graham crakers and broke up chocolate bars and covered the bottom of the pan with the mixture, added the marshmallow, then topped with more graham crackers and chocolate. I just rolled the cut sides in confectioners' sugar. Great dessert for a kid friendly dinner!

Fun recipe, almost identical to the French Laundry version, which also comes with homemade graham cracker recipe (yummy). Search site for homemade marshmallows and it pops up.

I've made this several times and I've found a couple of things that make it easier. I use a pizza cutter to cut. It tends not to stick as much. Also a dark chocolate seems to be better to coat in for me, a little more bitter to balance out the sweet of the marshmallow.

I am 13 and this recipe was moderately difficult for my. It was all very easy to make until it came to fluffing it up with the mixer. My little handheld mixer was hard to work with as the mixture kept on trying to get up into the mixer itself. If you have a stand up mixer i highly recommend using it instead of a handheld mixer. The end result was absolutely perfect regardless.

So i already reviewed this recipe but I keep making it over and over and trying new things. This time, I covered them in melted milk chocolate, and then crushed graham cracker before putting it in the fridge to chill for a couple hours and people loved them.

I thought that this recipe was amazing and I loved making it, I put more than double the amount of vanilla that the recipe called for which was a little too much but you can probably double it and have it still be good. My only issue is that they are hard to cut even when you do finagle them with a knife and there has to be a better way which someone will figure out. I also think that the powder covering, although necessary is very messy as it gets all over everything, so maybe the coconut might work better. something i should try

The only comment I have is that it was easier to cut when I dipped the knife in the powdered sugar mixture instead of the cooking spray as directed. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.
