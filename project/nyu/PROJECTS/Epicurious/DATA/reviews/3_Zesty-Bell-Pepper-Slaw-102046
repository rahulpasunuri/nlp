I tried to improve upon this in a number of ways, but it just doesn't taste very good.

I was disappointed by this and won't make it again. The cayenne was too overpowering--I served it at a block party and everyone commented on the cayenne! Even if I reduced how much I used, I don't think it was interesting enough to make again.

I've been making this since 1999 and will continue to make it. Excellent and you can really vary it depending on what's in your fridge. Today I didn't have scallions, but used vidalia onions and didn't have any peppers. It is sooo good a few days later.

This recipe will replace my standard cole slaw recipe. This is the only recipe I've found that can be used on a package of shredded cabbage and taste good. If you can't have sugar, or don't like cole slaw that is sweet, this will win you over!

I must be missing something. The dressing had no flavor at all.

I agree with the other reviews. This recipe is delicious. Even my 14 year old daughter likes it; and she does not care much for salads. I think the basil adds a nice flavor, as well as the bell peppers. I'm always looking for a good receipe for bell peppers.

I doubled this for a small barbecue and got rave reviews (but way too much slaw). But, most interestingly, my husband and neighbor polished off the leftovers the next day and both said it was even BETTER the next day. How nice to have another delicious dish in your repertoire that you can prepare in advance!

Very colorful and tasty. I agree that it serves 4+. Contrary to some, I'd be careful with the cayenne; I wasn't and cleared some sinuses and provoked a coughing fit.

This is such a simple recipe. The dressing is terrific (added a giant "pinch" of cayenne). I practically pureed the basil & added it in advance to the dressing (sat 10 hours in the fridge in a cup). I bought pre-fab cole slaw rather than shredding cabbage. It came out so nicely I wouldn't change a thing about my method, except maybe extending the tossed time to allow the flavors to meld to the veggies.

I made the mistake of thinking that I needed to double this recipe for four people and got a little sloppy with the measurements so it did not have as much "zest" as it would have otherwise I guess. Recipe as is the greatest of plenty for four people.

Mmm. Peppers.

Like taking a bite out of a garden! A refreshing blend of subtle flavors. This recipe has earned a place in my permanent repertoire.
