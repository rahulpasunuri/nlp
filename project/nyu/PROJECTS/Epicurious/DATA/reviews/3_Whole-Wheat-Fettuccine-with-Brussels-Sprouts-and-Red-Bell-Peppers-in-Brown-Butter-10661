I am going to make this recipe with Al Dente Whole Wheat Fettuccine. It cooks in just 3 minutes and is really light and delicate, not like most whole wheat pastas. It comes in a clear bag with an oval label and a checkerboard tape at top.

As others have noted, this recipe need some flavor additions to raise it from the "boring" category. Simple alterations that i enjoy include halving and browning the cut side of the brussels and adding them to the pan shortly after the onions. Add (a lot of) fresh sage leaves to the browned butter. Try pepper flake sprinkled in at the end for a little zip!

Count me as one who formerly hated brussel sprouts, but enjoyed this recipe! I cut the sprouts in 3-4 pieces, used vegetable broth instead of water. Tasted great!

The recipe seems to have quiet a bit butter with little taste in the finished product to justify the fat. I added some leamon pepper seasoning after trying a bite and that seemed to help. I'd like to make this dish again with some alterations such as olive oil in place of some butter and added seasonings. Any ideas on what seasonings go good with brussel sprouts would be appreicated. Also what does leaves seperated mean exactly?

I'm making this for the 3rd or 4th time -- we like it. I'ts easy, colorful and healthy. I, too, just cut the brussels sprouts in eighths and use ordinary pasta.

I like this dish alot, and have made it many times over the years. I only make it in the fall when good locally-grown organic brussels sprouts are available. I always use regular fettucine.

This was an excellent use for my least favorite vegetable...but it's my husband's favorite vegetable! I made this with egg fettuccine as I couldn't locate whole wheat pasta and didn't have time to make it...also instead of taking the time to separate all the sprout leaves, I cut the heads in quarters or eights (depending upon size) and used them that way...which worked great! I'll definitely make this again.
