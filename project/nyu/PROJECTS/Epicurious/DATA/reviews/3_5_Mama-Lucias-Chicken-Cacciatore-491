This is a great recipe for tweaking with stuff you have on hand. I used leftover beef broth instead of chicken broth and omitted the mushrooms. Also white wine instead of Marsala and purchased Arabbiata sauce. It was delicious! It was easier than other cacciatore recipes and just as good. A keeper!

Very good. Made with red bell peppers instead of green for better flavor. Used baby bellas. And I did add the cheese. Put over Bowie pasta. Husband loved it.

This is my go to recipe for Chicken Cacciatore. Everyone loves it! I use chicken thighs, as they are more flavorful than breasts, and hold up to the braising. Skinless, boneless are easiest, but bone-in has more flavor. Also, I often brown with the skin on, and then remove the skin before continiuing. This keeps the chicken moist, but makes the final product less greasy. I serve with polenta and it is just heaven!

I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and used chardonnay instead of marsala...but otherwise followed the recipe exactly! My husband says this has to be the sauce recipe I use all the time. It was terrific!

Terrific recipe. I've been making it for years to the delight of everyone. I use sweet red peppers. A few drops of Tabasco lift the sauce to total yumminess.

Very Yummy! This is definately a keeper. Fast, easy, & budget friendly. I omitted the capers, added red pepper flakes as others mentioned and basil. I also added a little more marsala.I served over mini penne pasta very lightly buttered w/ a little parmesan.

This is an excellent dish. Easy to make and delicious! The only changes I made is to up the garlic, used boneless skinless chicken thigshs,red and yellow peppers (I can't stand green), and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, as we like it spicy. I also added basil ribbons at the end. Marinara sauce from TJ's. Served with buttered orzo with parsley. It is better the next day for sure, but delish fresh.

Liked it a lot...only changes made were skinless thighs and didn't use the capers, instead used raisins as my mom always does. Oh, and red bell, not green and added some crushed pepper heat. Sorry if those are too many changes for some of you, but maybe these suggestions will help someone else.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and easy to make. Recommend adding crushed red pepper (1 tspn). I put in crock pot for 4 hours after saute' work, and it resulted in a rich ragout. If you are looking for more texture, I think stick with the skillet. Don't skimp on the capers, and up the wine to at least 2/3 cup. Served with mashed pots (husbands request) was delicious but incredibly rich. Plenty of leftovers.

An excellent version with few changes (1 red and 1 green pepper, come soaked dried porcini, all thighs). very good!

This is a keeper. Only changes I made were adding a quarter tsp red pepper flakes and had madera but no marsala,it was still great! We like our bell peppers julienned in caccitore since it complements the pasta better and allows the peppers to become softer (& its the way Nana used to make it!) Definitely worth making again the family loved it.

OMG!!! I HAVE REACHED CHICKEN CACCIATORE NIRVANA!!! This was the best I've ever eaten. I couldn't make up my mind between this and the Spicy Chicken Cacciatore on this site, so I added a lot of the ingredients from that as well. I put in one red and one green pepper, a can of stewed tomatoes, red pepper flakes, 2 T. red wine vinegar, fennel, and threw a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary. I also followed Jeanine of West Hartford's lead, and made my own marinara. I also almost doubled the sauce, as we'll now have some leftover sauce for pasta. This was stupendous! Restaurant quality Cacciatore. Next time, I'm using boneless chicken breasts, and may consider adding a little tomato paste, just too see if I like it a little more tomatoey. The chicken was so tender!!!

Rating: 3
Delicious! I made it as directed. Tasted the sauce and decided no additions/changes needed. I will reheat this for dinner in a 300 oven (covered) for at least an hour or until the meat falls off the bones. I'll carefully remove the bones, keeping the chicken thighs intact as best as I can. This is the way to eat the bone in chicken with no difficulty. Serving over egg noodles is a great idea, a change from regular pasta!

Rating: 3
I had 6 chicken thighs I needed to use up, and this was a great way to do it! And I didn't mind that they were bone-in, either, it just makes my husband eat slower... Two unnecessary steps in this recipe as I see it: don't replace the olive oil after you've browned the chicken. Why toss out all that flavor if you're only going to add more oil back into the pan? The flour that remains also makes the last step redundant; when you remove the chicken for serving, you don't need to bring it all to boil again for reduction, it's already nicely thickened and ready to go (just skim off the fat). We served it alongside buttered noodles and a nice glass of red... oh, but I do agree with a previous writer in that I will rememeber to put a shake of chili flakes in next time to give it a kick. And fyi, I used the bagged Marinara sauce that you find in the refridgerated pasta section, plus the leftovers from a bad bottle of wine, not Marsala.

Rating: 4
My family loves this dish. I make it with bonesless chicken and use Emeril's Kicked Up tomato sauce and add some red pepper flakes to give it some extra heat, which we prefer. Otherwise, absolutely perfect over pappardelle pasta. Add crusty garlic bread and a salad and you're good to go!

I made this again last night and I've made this many times. This is a fabulous recipe and a family favorite. I always use boneless chicken (we don't like chicken on the bone with Italian food) and follow the recipe for the most part. Sometimes I don't have mushrooms or peppers, but no matter what that sauce is always wonderful! I serve with pasta and have also served for company on many occasions - always a hit!

Rating: 3
Great taste! I used Pomi Marinara and reduced the oregano slightly. I also took the skin off and the chicken was still very moist. A suggestion from one of my Italian friends was to use white wine and red peppers, as this is the way she traditionally makes hers. So I'll try that next time. Great dish!

Have made this twice in the past month. Very good recipe. Made some minor adjustments. Used boneless parts (breasts and thighs) and cut into big chunks before tossing in the flour. Omitted marinara and used instead 1-2 cans of diced tomatoes with liquid. Capers make it -- had them the first time but not the second. Served with garlic smashed-red skin potatoes.

This is a very good recipe. there are a few things that I changed though, first I grilled chicken breasts then put everythign into one alum. pan. I used white wine instead of marsala, whole plum tomoatoes and tomato sauce instead of using canned marinara. I also added basil and anise. One more thing that I added that should be in the recipe is black olives. I then put the covered pan back on the grill for onother hour or so. It turned out to be one of the best chicken dinners I have ever made. I believe that using the Weber was a great idea. No mess becasue everytingi is in one pan. I will definately make this again!

Chopped up a can of whole tomatoes and rather than marinara sauce. Had no marsala so used about 1/4 cup of sweet red vermouth. Also, only had a tray of 8 chicken thighs which worked out great. In summary, a terrific recipe which I will make again.

This recipe was a big hit. I made it at a dinner party that I had had, and everybody loved it. I too, however, substituted the Marsala with a subtle red wine, Cote du Rhone, because Marsala is not very easy to find in Paris. In addition, I substituted the capers with black olives. I will make this dish without a doubt.

Fabulous recipe!!!!!! I dipped the chicken in egg, then flour, before browning.

Incredible taste. Great with crusty bread, rice, or pasta!!

I doubled it and made a batch for a pot luck and some to take to the family of a friend who is in the hospital. Everyone loved it. It travels well and reheats well. Rather than simmering everything after assembling all ingredients, I slow cooked it at 275 degrees till ready, and it came out really nice and tender. Add a bit more chicken broth and marinara sauce if you intend to do this.

GREAT! I used skinless thighs and omited the flour, chicken broth and marsala(couldn't find mine). I doubled the amount of tomato sauce and added kalamata olives and some anchovie paste for flavor. I simmered it in a dutch oven for about 2 hours. My husband raved!

I loved all the ingredients...I added lots more italian seasoning...and more garlic...I also simmered the chicken(boneless chicken breasts) in the sauce for up to 1 1/2 hours...found this made the chicken much more moist and the chicken absorbed some of the sauces flavors.....will make again for sure!!!

Rating: 4
Excellent and so easy to make. Far from the first making of this great dish for me, I vary the ingredients with whatever I have on hand. It's easy to use anything you have around the kitchen pantry - no matter what you use you can't go wrong!! This time out, I preprared the chicken without coating in flour for a lighter taste, just the salt and pepper with a little olive oil and minced garlic to brown boneless, skinless breasts. Fresh onions (chopped) and garlic with canned stewed, italian seasoned tomatoes in place of the prepared marinara sauce. Added non-fat evaporated milk and simmered to reduce and thicken. This may have been the best version yet!! Wild rice cooked in chicken broth with a little drizzled olive oil over the rice is a great side - or serve the chicken and sauce over a bed of wild rice.

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious. I used a combination of breasts and drumsticks. Can anyone give me tips on how to cook chicken breasts properly so that they don't taste "tough" but are cooked all the way through? How pink can they be inside during the browning process so that they come out just done after simmering?

Rating: 4
Great cacciatore recipe, and I've tried a few. Nice to have thicker cuts of mushrooms, and I like recipes that include Marsala and capers. I dipped the chicken in egg before coating it with flour (thank you Lidia Bastianich!). For the marinara sauce I used a quick recipe from Marcella Hazan's "Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking": 2 cups of Italian plum tomatoes with their juice, 5 tbls butter, 1 medium onion cut in half, salt. Add all ingredients in small pot and cook at slow temp for 45 minutes; at end of cooking discard onion. I really think this fresh sauce added a lot to the recipe -- it added to the overall fresh and delicious taste of the recipe. In sum, this recipe is a keeper.

My husband and I loved it -- better than the one at my favorite Italian restaurant. Used 6 bone-in skinned chicken breasts halved cross-wise (in my crockpot after bringing everything to boil and simmering for 10 minutes. Because I hate having partial jars or cans of sauces or broth left over, I used a 26 oz. jar of Bertolli marinara sauce, one 14 1/2 oz. can of chicken broth, 1 1/4 cups of Marsala and a generous 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper. For ease of preparation and eating, will use boneless breasts next time. The Marsala and capers really set this cacciatore apart!

This was really good, doubled the sauce so we could serve it with pappardelle. Good thing cause that pasta soaked up the sauce. Added teaspoon of dried chilli flakes to spice it up a bit. Used whole cut up chicken which was perfect because some like white & some like dark meat. Will probably make again next week.

Really, really good - I, too, used boneless-skinless breasts, subbed red peppers for green (just because I don't like green!), used 2 cups of the Marinara and added a generous dash (or 2) of red pepper flakes. Yum - served over pasta.

My dad made this dish following the recipe almost exactly. The only alteration was that he used bone-in skin -on breasts and thighs. We served it over a bed of linguini. I do think the quality of the ingredients is important, so I chose a marinara sauce that was"organic" and it did not contain High Fructose Corn syrups, sugar or other artificial ingedients. Of course, Marinara sauce isn't that difficult to make, so, if you so inclined, use the recipe from this site and just leave out the sugar. The Marsala countered the acidity well, because my sister in law hates sour or acidic foods. She loved this.

I made this today, during the blizzard of '03, and my wedding anniversary! I didn't have mushrooms, or the peppers,and had "Italian Seasoning" rather than oregano. There is oregano in the mixture. It was delicious. I used "Arabica" marinara sauce, which is spicier than standard pasta sauce. I found I had to cook the chicken breast longer than 20 min. More like 30min. Perhaps I didn't brown the chicken long enough, so had to make up the cooking time at the other end.

Delicious! A true Italian comfort food; one that's worth making again and again. I used skinless chicken breasts (on the bone, because I didn't want to lose that extra flavor). Next time I'll probably use white and dark parts. I substituted one red pepper for one of the green and added an extra clove of garlic because you can never have too much garlic! I was skeptical about using the capers based on some of the reviews, but I did and they only enhanced the dish. Overall this is wonderful - I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!

I cut down on the bell pepper and added some dried porcini mushrooms in addition to the fresh mushrooms. Don't omit the Marsala, I think that's what sets this recipe apart from other Cacciatores. I serve the delicious sauce with spaghetti on the same plate as the chicken. It's always a hit.

This was much simpler than the cacciatore I used to make - very yummy! I used a whole chicken and made the "low sodium broth" with the trimmings, back and neck with some aromatics. The homemade stock and marsala made it very rich. Thanks to the "kick it up" recommendation I added some garlic powder, kosher salt, cayenne pepper, oregano and basil to the dredging flour. I omitted the capers and bell pepper because my husband likes neither one, and it still had plenty of flavor. Added a salad with garbanzos and marinated artichokes and we were good to go! A definite keeper for mid-week quickies.

Never having eaten Chicken Cacciatore, I have no point of reference, but this was absolutely delicious! So delicious, that I've been craving it. 2 things: Be sure to skin your chicken legs before you cook them - I ended up having to skim lots of fat off the top; Use the smaller capers - not only do they look better, but they distribute themselves better and are not so bitter.
