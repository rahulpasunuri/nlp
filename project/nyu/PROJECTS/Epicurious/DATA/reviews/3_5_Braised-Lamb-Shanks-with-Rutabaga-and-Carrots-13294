I love this dish! The Pastitsio that follows it (uses the extra shanks left over) is my family's favorite! I've made these about 8 times, each one a hit! AAA++++

I didn't have dried orange peel, so I used fresh minced zest. I like rutabagas and this was a very flavorful braise. I will definitely make this again.
