This is a great recipe worthy of any special meal! I have been making it for years and it always gets rave reviews. My hints are to make sure the meat is well seared and browned. Not only does this enhance the texture of the beef, it ensures your sauce will be a nice rich color. The vegetables you end up with are truly delicious! I serve them on the side, awesome!

I made this a few years back and liked it better than this time around. Was pretty good but not good enough to try again. Thought the meat not that flavorful and the whiskey kind of strange.

I've been making this for special occasions since it first published. It's perfect as written! It's sophisticated and impressive, yet absolutely everyone loves it (even my very picky kids!). It does take some time to prepare, but because it's so rich, it goes best with simple easy sides (like the recommended roasted potatoes and steamed spinach), making a special occasion dinner easy to pull together.

Wow. This was an easy dish to put together. I unintentionally used a tougher cut of meat but it was still very tasty and all agreed that we would try it again with the tenderloin.

I cooked the beef to 130 degrees, let is stand for about 20 minutes. It was rare and delicious. Sauce was good, but wonder about the addition of the cream. It gave the sauce a sickly color. I thought it should have been served separately. Finished dish was NOT attractive. I would make it again, with modifications.

It was ok, but a plain old pot roast would be better and a lot less work.

Absolutely wicked! The sauce was rich, smooth and zesty. A good piece of beef, a little preparation and organization, and a terrific meal resulted. Served with roast potatoes and grilled asparagus, and a bottle of Cotes du Rhone. I'm under strict orders to make this again...soon.

Oh, my Lord, this was fabulous! We used drug-free, hormone-free beef from Whole Foods--- so worth the extra $$$! My only change was that I had a slightly loarger piece of meat (2.3 lbs), and I used fat-free half-and-half instead of cream. Awesome.

I have used this recipe (part of the Great Gatsby Dinner) since I first read it in 1996. People seek invitations to these dinners.

We made this for Christmas dinner. Absolutely tasty (we added more cracked pepper)! The sauce is twice as good the next day for leftovers.

This is really good - easy to make and wonderful flavors. I served it with horseradish mashed potatoes and it was a big hit. The only thing I noticed was that the sauce was just alittle "floury". Next time I'll definitely make a roux from the flour and butter. I'll also puree the vegetables and use them in the sauce instead of the heavy cream.

We loved this, but I added chopped mushrooms to the vegetables. It tasted great, but the shrooms absorbed a lot of the liquid, so I didn't have much to reduce. Hence, my sauce was too thick and had to be thinned with a bit of broth. The recipe is delicious, and the meat came out perfectly done. I'll make it again next time we have company!

Rating: 3
Much better if you make it with brandy and green peppercorns added while you're reducing the sauce. The sweet from the brandy helps cut the salt of the beef broth. Otherwise - yummy!

Very good recipe. Normally here and there I change or add ingredients to a recipe. I made this one exactly as it's written and it turned out great. My husband and I had it the other day and will definitely make it again.

We just absolutely loved it... we added mushrooms to the sauce and that worked well... the sandwiches the next day were awesome as well as the quesadillas the day after that... A++++++ recipe, we will be making this one for company often

First served for a dinner party and my guests loved it, particulary the gravy!! I was very surprised considering the ease and quickness to prepare. Nothing was left remaining on their plates and everyone had seconds. A+++ recipe.

This dish wowed my dinner guests! It was the first time I had made it so I was nervous about the pepper as there seemed so much of it but it wasn't at all overpowering, just completely delicious! A keeper!

I was a bit daunted at first by this recipe, but went out and got the cast iron skillet and the dish received raves from my whole family - my husband used the leftover meat on sandwiches the next day and he said the flavor was even better.

I served this with Spaetzle that I made using buttermilk rather than whole milk. That is the spaetzle with Browned butter recipe- skipped the brown butter sauce as there was enough gravy from the meat.

My Dad actually found this in an Irish Cookbook. It's wonderful for a dinner party when you cook a whole tenderloin. It goes terrific with double baked potatoes and a fine hearty red wine.

I made this for a group of food snobs and everyone loved it. I used JWR instead of Canadian Whisky and it turned out fine.

This is a definite keeper. I too used a rump roas, but evidently not a good quality - came out a little tough for my taste. My fault, though - I'll use a cut of meat worthy of this sauce next time. Divine! I too skipped the straining step and coarsely ground the peppercorns. Didn't care for that, though - too crunchy; I'll use ground next time. I served it over rice and was glad I did that rather than potatoes - would have overpowered that wonderful sauce, which is restaurant quality in my book. My husband raved, something he doesn't do often. A definite company dish as well.

Verrry good. Used a rump roast I had on hand and will definitly be making this again.

Wow! I love this recipe. I used a 3-pound sirloin tip roast and upped the ingredients accordingly, adding a few handfuls of new potatoes (which I pulled out with the meat). I used Maker's Mark Bourbon, and it was DIVINE. Also: I highly recommend doing it rustic style by skipping all that straining. The bits of veg and spice make it extra yummy over the potatoes. I'm a wuss about pepper, so I ground it. SO good!

This was good, not wonderful. The price for the beef was prohibitive. If I am going to spend that much money on a piece of meat, I have other recipes that I enjoy more.

This was the best beef dish we have ever made! We used brandy instead of whisky, and just bought a thermometer that gives you a reading outside of the oven for the meat. It helped keep the meat from getting overcooked. Did I mention that I love this recipe? So good!

This recipe was easy and wonderful! My husband loved it and the sauce was so good he was mopping it up with french bread. Even 2 days later when we have leftovers it was still incredible. A definate keeper!

Try it with Maker's Mark bourbon if you can find it..it's a bit sweeter.

Great sauce. Can use on any number of beef dishes. A nice combination of spice and sweet. I was afraid that it would be too peppery for my husband, who is not a spicy food afciando, but not so. Also I loved the carrots, not usually my favorite, but cooked in the broth/wiskey sauce with onions - I loved them. The whole dish was very RICH - and delicious.

So good, it borders being sublime! Wonderful sauce! --Prepared this as part of a special meal for my husband, and the children, who had already been fed and put to bed for the evening, were lured downstairs by the aroma. (Yes, we let them join us; there's plenty to share.) --Definitely a dish that impresses.

Incredible flavour! I followed the recipe to the T so can't recommend any changes but I do suggest that people not cheap out on the rye (whiskey) they use. I used Crown Royal ... I can't see getting the same flavour from a cheap rye like Canadian Club.

Fantastic! Made this for a dinner party for 10(doubled the recipe)and received rave reviews. I plan to serve this many times in the future (including to 20 guests next week!) The sauce has a wonderful flavor.

4 forks over the sauce! It was so memorable I can't remember what cut of meat I used :-). I very likly grilled a sirloin or pork tenderloin. I brown the veggies and did use an expensive brandy instead of the whisky (this may have been the ticket ;-) added a bit more butter and it was awesome.

I tried this dish when my local market had tenderloin on sale. I generally have my tried and true recipes for tenderloin, since I get it so seldom but in this case I had two to play with. I really enjoyed the recipe and will make it again sometime but I think I'll use bourbon rather than Canadian whiskey. It made it just a touch too sweet.

One of the the yummiest dinner's I've ever made. I highly recommend it. Any leftovers make a fantastic beef and gravy sandwich the next day.

This recipe was above average but nothing spectacular. The sauce was not as flavorful as we had hoped it would be. Should have used more whiskey!

Expensinve, but awesome. Whenever I'm able to pick up a really good cut of tenderloin, I make it.

I've made this twice, each time a rousing success. Very easy and tasty. The gravy is so good that a lesser cut than a tenderloin can be used.

What an excellent dish and so easy to prepare, there was not a lick left. I added a little extra thyme to the beef itself while roasting.
