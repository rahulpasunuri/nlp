Made this for breakfast yesterday morning. Didn't have a mango, so used cantaloupe. My husband thought it was delicious.

In an effort to use up a box of farina, I searched for, and stumbled upon this recipe. The pudding alone is comfort-in-a-cup! A delightful texture and lightly sweetened (I use 1 tbsp of agave) it makes for the perfect end to a meal, a rough day, or as a special snack. I've only used strawberries (harry's berries for those in the know) and can't say enough good things about this guiltless little treat. What a find!

The pudding alone is light and so delicious. I make this for my toddlers and we love it. I serve it warm and use whatever fruit I have.

This recipe has become a family staple! Instead of the fruit suggested, I use "brown sugar peaches". A healthy dessert. It works fine with low-fat milk, too.
