Excellent, flaky crust. For the pepper I used a very good blend from Williams Sonoma.

Here is my family recipe for pie crust-fewer ingredients and great! 1 stick butter+1 cup flour+2 pinches of salt...pulse in a food processor until resembles coarse meal. add 1/3 cup sour cream (lite OK) and pulse until JUST combined. Don't over mix!!!! It should look marbled when you roll it out. Great for savory or sweet tarts, pies, quiche...

Easy to make and deliciously flaky and tender. Holds up well to a really heavy filling and doesn't shatter when you cut into it. My favorite!

I think this recipe has just become my favorite tart dough. It is easy to work with, is tender, yet stands up to a filling well.
