I loved this recipe! I read the prior reviews and took a couple of the suggestions. I used apple cider in lieu of pear nectar and left the shallots in the pan to caramelize with the pears. Next time I will wait until the sauce is completely reduced before I put the pork in the oven - it took a lot longer than anticipated. Absolutely delicious end product - I will definitely make it again!

Great recipe! Made it last night for New Years Eve dinner. My husband who is not a pork person loved it and got seconds. Per the previous reviews I ended up slicing the shallots and the pears. Melted the butter in the skillet then added the flour and whisked a bit, then added the broth and used apple cider instead of pear nectar. It turned out great using the apple cider and after a rigorous boil it thickened up just fine. I might use a splash of lemon juice next time at the end to "brighten" it up. Would definitely serve this to guests!

Excellent! Easy, quick dinner. Omitted olive oil and reduced butter to 1 T to make low fat. Still delicious, will definitely make again.

Excellent flavors. I'll be making this one again, but next time I'll dice the pears and shallots (both were still raw on the inside). I also thought the sauce needed more salt, but otherwise a good recipe!

Make this easy! Saute the pork tenderloin and shallots, as directed Remove the tenderloin and put in the oven as directed Add pear chunks or slices to the pan with the shallots and brown Deglaze pan with pear nectar and pour pears, shallots and nectar over the pork Bake til pork is done, about 5-10 more minutes. I may add rosemary next time

This was sooooo yummy and delicious. It was the first dish I made using my new meat thermometer so I was able to cook it until it was perfectly done. My exception: I cooked a 1 1/2 pound tenderloin so it needed to stay in the oven a little longer than the recipe states. In addition I used a jar of Trader Joes pears, packed in white grape juice instead of fresh pears and pear nectar. Came out GREAT. So easy.... Definitely going on my dinner rotation!

The pork was delicious but I didn't care for the texture of the pears. Next time I'll try apples.

This recipe was stunning. If I paid a lot of money for this in a restaurant, I would have thought it a good value - it's that good. Minor changes: couldn't find pear nectar, so used apricot nectar. Cut the pears (I used anjou & bosc) into chunks. Made a roux with the flour & butter before adding the liquids. If I want to really please a dinner guest, this recipe will be on my short list.

This was an excellent day before find for what to do with a pork tenderloin I used to make another way but don't make anymore now that I'm allergic to soy. I made this for a Christmas lunch I was attending at a friend's house that was an hour from home. I usually bring the meat dish as his wife is vegetarian and doesn't cook meat. I brined the pork, as recommended by another reviewer, for 12 hours prior to roasting it to keep it moist, since I would essentially be cooking it twice. I found brining instructions and recipes online by Googling pork tenderloin brine. My Bosc pears were not very ripe, so I cut them into 8 pieces lengthwise after coring, instead of 4, and only used 2 pears. I added 1 T of sugar, 1 tsp. of sea salt and 1/2 tsp. of fine ground black pepper to the oil as well. I cut the chicken broth to 1 cup and increased the pear nectar to 1+1/4 cup. In the cast-iron skillet, after browning the pork, shallots and pears, and removing them, I melted the butter, whisked in the flour to make a rue, then added the broth and nectar. The sauce thickened very quickly this way. After tasting it, I added sugar, salt and pepper, a little at a time, until I liked the flavor. I roasted the pork for 15 mins. then removed it from the oven, sliced it, and placed it in a glass baking dish surrounded by the shallots and pears, laid on the thyme springs and covered it with foil. I put the sauce in a 2 cup glass bowl with a lid for transporting it. At my friend's home, I put the roast, pears and shallots in the oven for another half hour at 350F, keeping the foil on it so nothing would dry out. I reheated the sauce in a microwave for 5-7 mins on 50% power, stirred it up and poured it on just before serving. It was a BIG hit with the meat eaters. My only problem was, I didn't make enough for leftovers! I will next time though.

Great flavors. I used apple cider rather than pear nectar. I left the shallots in the pan while cooking the pears for extra caramelization and flavor. I then added pears and shallots to baking pan with pork for last five minutes. Sauce takes twice the amount of time as recipe indicates.

The flavors of this were fabulous! I used apple cider instead of the pear nectar. Just a warning on the sauce- mine took forever to thicken and I even used more flour and butter (1 T of each). Next time I would cook the roux first, then add the wet ingredients. This is definitely a keeper!

Very tasty and comes together quickly. Easily works for company or a week night meal. I used bartlett pears as that was all I had on hand but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

There is a mistake in the size of the tenderloin in the recipe. It is really just 1 1/4. However, this recipe was delicious. It took a bit longer to prepare than it says and I would use a softer pear than Bosc. But flavors are delish and I will definitely put this in my future dinner menus.

This is a fantastic recipe! It was relatively easy and everyone really enjoyed it. I used dried thyme and slightly reduced the amount of chicken broth, but other than that I followed the recipe. I will definitely use recipe this again!

Very good. I didn't have any pear nectar on hand, so substituted some white wine and added a touch of sugar. I've never not cooked the heck out of pork tenderloin (and never browned it), and this makes for a nice, tender cut of meat.

This was a great recipe to prepare when you want something different. I substituted coconut oil for butter as we're paleo eaters, and coconut flower for the regular flower. I think next time I'll try arrow root instead. Another thing I'll change next time is sticking the pairs in with the pork in the oven. Otherwise, delish!

Very delicious and quick to make although felt like a lot of steps to balance in short period of time - maybe was only difficult in a small kitchen. However, the steps for the sauce don't seem to be correct and sauce never thickened. I started over and made a roux first then the sauce was thick and luscious. Next time I might not bother to cook pears either and would serve them on the side cold.

To find a recipe that my picky husband and daughter will eat made this one a keeper! It was super easy and pretty quick to make - the pork cooks super fast in the oven. I might add more flour to the sauce next time to make it a little thicker. We served it with yellow saffron rice and it went great together.

A very filling dish with a nice combination of tastes, the sauce was delicious as I used knorr jelly chicken stock and 3/4 of a cup of boiling water. The meal was accompanied by mushroom rice and ciabatta with a good spreading of salted butter. I would defiantly cook this again for my partner again.

Yum! I have 2 suggestions though. 1st - I finished the tenderloin on the grill. 2nd - Next time, I would reduce the chicken broth and nectar by at least 1/4. It made way to much sauce.

I did not feel the result of this recipe was worth all the steps involved and the hands-on time. While the flavors were nice, and the pork itself was very tasty, I think I will find a faster way to get a similar result.

After 4-5 days of reading all of the reviews of this recipe and allowing my pears to finally ripen, here's how I tweaked the recipe and how it turned out. I coated the pork tenderloin with olive oil, salt, pepper and chopped fresh thyme. I added a couple of teaspoons of olive oil to an oven proof pan and sauteed the tenderloin for approximately 3 minutes per side, adding the shallots and garlic for the last 3 minutes. I added the pears to the pan, along with about 1/2 Cup of pear nectar and 1/4 cup chardonnay and put the entire pan in the oven (at 475 degrees) for about 12-15 minutes - uncovered. When the tenderloin was removed from the oven, I put the tenderloin on a cutting board (covered) and the pear mixture in a covered dish and returned the pan to the stove and added the additional pear nectar (about 1/2 cup), chicken broth (about 1/2 cup) with the roux and simmered for about 5 minutes to thicken. I added that to the pear mixture and used it as a sauce for the pork tenderloin. It was wonderful. Hubster went back for seconds - and thirds. Definitely company fare. I can't wait to make it for company.

To the Cook from Berwyn, IL, your correction on trichinella is incorrect. According to the CDC: "Infection was once very common and usually caused by ingestion of undercooked pork. However, infection is now relatively rare. During 1997- 2001, an average of 12 cases per year were reported."

I followed another suggestion and for ease of cooking, combined all ingredients in a roaster for 1 hour. Meat was tender but a bit bland. Next time would sear meat first. With a few adjustments may also be good for crockpot.

Great variation on pork tenderloin and a good way to use the pears we always receive for Christmas. I couldn't find pear nectar at the store so I made my own by pureeing 1-2 ripe pears. Tasted great and will make again.

Delicous!!!! A perfect "pear"ing. The lightly carmelized pears melt in your mouth and blend beautifully with the savory gravy and fresh thyme.

Good combination, but like other reviewers, I changed the way I put the ingredients together. I put salt and pepper on the pork loin and seared it in olive oil, then put it into the oven to roast. Then I added the garlic and shallots to the pan and browned them. I sliced 2 small pears into the pan with the garlic and onions, and browned them a little before adding thyme springs, the chicken stock (1/2 cup) and pear nectar (1/2 cup) mixed with approx 1 T flour. I let everything simmer about 5 minutes and thicken while the pork finished cooking, and removed the thyme sprigs just before serving. Served with sauteed brussel sprouts and butternut squash gratin--delicious!

This was a great weeknight dinner that would be good enough for company! I made a few minor changes: After searing the pork and putting it in the oven, I left the shallots in the pan and then added the pears. I didn't remove the pears after browning, just added the nectar/broth mixture to the pan, which allowed the pears to soften a bit and cook further in the liquid. When the recipe called for flour and butter, I made a slurry of cornstarch with a bit of the cooking liquid in a separate bowl, and then added it back to the pan. Keeping everything in one pan helped the flavors develop, and made cleanup a breeze too.

RE Coccinella's comment that the temperature given for cooking the pork was too low and that "pork should reach 165 degrees". Not so. Cooking to a higher temperature was done to prevent infections of Trichinella, a parasite that hasn't been found in pork since the early 1940's. In the meantime, a much leaner pork is being produced, so without the additional fat overcooking leads to a very dry product.

WOW! Everyone in the family loved this, including the finicky 3 yr. old. I seared the pork and removed, then cooked down the shallots then the pears (of which I added two extra), returned the pork to the pot and put into the oven and covered. It was tough to get a real good sear on the pork without burning the garlic as the recipe reads. I will add garlic with the shallots next time. I served with brown rice as others have mentioned and an arrugula salad. One of the best, fast and healthy meals we have had in a long time.

This was great! And fairly quick & easy too. The one thing I was concerned about was the direction to cook until a thermometer read 145 -- pork is supposed to reach 160, so I kept it in the oven till the thermometer hit 155 and let carryover heat do the last 5... I saw a couple reviews that the pork had come out bland, so I brined mine and it was fantastic. I boiled a cup of water and stirred in: 1/4 cup of kosher salt, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1 minced garlic clove, some thyme and some peppercorns. I added a cup of ice to cool it down and put it in a ziplock with the tenderloin. The pear nectar I bought was more than 3/4 cup so I added the extra, then enough water to cover up the tenderloin, and let it sit for 8 or 9 hours. After that I followed the recipe just as written (except the 10 extra degrees). It came out SO tender, and the sauce was delish. I served it over brown rice. If I make it again I'll probably try doing it all in a roasting pan, and maybe apples instead of pears, like some reviewers suggested. But I was very happy just as it was!

I put everything in a bowl and tossed with oil,garlic, S&P and thyme.I seared the meat, browned onions and pears and Roasted it for about 18 mins. I then removed the meat,onions and fruit from the pan and added the nectar and broth. I reduced this to a glaze as I am not a gravy fan. It was delicious. The meat was tender and juicy. I am not sure what the pears add to this dish except they are low in calories. They are "nice",just not great. I will certainly make this again as it is so easy. I served with brown rice

instead of several steps, I put everything into a casserole dish (sans flour & cover), put it in the oven for about an hour (periodically checking the meat temp) and when the meat was ready - it was outstanding. the meat just fell apart and was beyond juicy.

I made this for dinner and also combined the shallots with the pork when I baked it (covered). I did add a little balsamic glaze (purchased already made in a bottle - Gia Russo brand) to the sauce and it gave it great flavor. My kids loved it and next time I make it, I'm going to try using apples as someone else suggested.

This was delicious! The pears are a nice compliment to the pork. What I did differently: I browned the pork on all sides in an oven-proof pot then added the shallots. I then covered it and put it in the oven to roast in the pot rather than on a baking sheet. When done, I removed the pork & shallots to a plate and tented with foil. I then completed the recipe as written.

I simplify this by putting apples, pork, shallots all in a zip lock bag with olive oil, garlic, thyme and SALT. After i sear the pork and shallots(using my tongs to retrieve items from the bag), i sear the fruit. I bake the pork, shallot, fruit and sauce all together for 20 minutes. I substituted apples today and liked it better than the pears. Also, it makes a lot of sauce.

The pork was fantastic. My pears picked up a little too much of the savory flavor; I would have prefered they were a little sweeter. I read that some weren't able to thicken the gravy. I used the butter and flour to make a roux. And, added the pear nectar, with only enough chicken broth to keep it from being too thick. This being said, the gravy was not my favorite. The pork was great alone.

Loved this recipe - super easy and tasty. I also added salt - to the sauce and on the pork, and pears. However I used homemade turkey broth and I never add salt to my broth, so it would have had no salt at all. My pears weren't very ripe but they still turned out amazingly soft.

This recipe gets 4 forks but only with some relatively major tweaks. First some one forgot seasoning, no salt & pepper, REALLY? Here was my plan. Make the oil, garlic, thyme mixture in a LARGE bowl, heavily season with S&P. Toss in pork & shallots as u heat up an large oven proof skillet. Remove pork & shallots into hot pan, leaving remaining marinade in bowl, toss in & coat pears. Brown pork on all sides about 1.5-2 min per side. Toss in pears and place in hot oven. This way everything roasts together and get goo flavor. Roast until pork is at 145. Place pork, shallots & pears out of pan & place pan back on burner. I don't like gravy (but you can make it as written) so I just deglazed the pan with the pear nectar and broth. Taste sauce & season. It's a GREAT winter dinner. Served with Kale with butternut squash & cranberries.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this just lacked flavor to me. Pear never seems to be a strong enough flavor for pork. Apples always seem to work better. Perhaps it is just me...

This was OK, not great. Too much to do at the last minute for a dinner party meal. Also, the sauce was rather bland, both in flavor and presentation. If I try this again I think I'll cut out most of the chicken stock to make a more concentrated sauce. I'll also roast the pears instead of sauteeing them so they look nicer and don't go as mushy.

Rating: 2
I totally agree with the previous review. There was no sweetness or saltiness to this dish! I desperately wanted to like it as well, but it just didn't work. I cubed my pears and put it in the sauce hoping that it might make it sweeter, but it didn't work. I also went against everything I believe in and did not add salt and pepper, and that certainly would have helped! It just lacked *something*.

Rating: 2
2 forks for creativity and also because I very much wanted to like this dish but it was absolutely awful. Pear nectar did not impart enough sweetness and mixed with the chicken broth it was just a bland mess. Took other's suggestions and made my pear slices smaller only to have them resemble steak fries (which in this case is not a good thing). That coupled with a lack of salt and pepper ( I tend not to stray from the directions of a recipe the first time out) made this odd and unpleasant to eat. Too subtle, too bland and not worth the effort.

This was a HUGE hit last night - my husband said he thought it was the best thing that I've ever made. It was really easy to make and so yummy! My only recommendation is that you brine the tenderloin for 1.5 - 2 hours before you cook it. The result is a super tender & juicy pork dish!
