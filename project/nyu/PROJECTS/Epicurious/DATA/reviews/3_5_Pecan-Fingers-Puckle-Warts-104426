I've made these cookies every year since the recipe appeared in Gourmet over a decade ago. They are fabulous, everything a Christmas cookie should be. The honey and shape distinguish them from Russian teacakes. Contrary to some reviews here, I have found them enormously popular. I even overheard a professonal caterer who was a guest at a party whisper to another guest to be sure to try one, that they were the one thing served that were worth the calories. Be sure to dip them once while they are hot, and then sift sugar over them again when they are cool.

Great "boy" cookie. Always popular with my husband, son and friends of husband and son. I have made this as the request of my husband for the last 9 years. The cookies are not sweet except for the powered sugar coating, which should be thick! They are very rich though.

My kids & I made this together, & they were really able to help, plus, EVERYONE loved these cookies, and they disappeared really fast. Might cook them just a little less next time, they might be a little softer. Definitely a recipe to make again.

I really enjoy these cookies. You can use a fork to roll the cookies in the powedered sugar to keep the paste off your fingers. I never end up with as many cookies as the recipe predicts.

I think these cookies have a great flavor from the honey. However, I did the method for forming them. I patted the dough into a 1/2" thick 6x11 inch rectangle, then chilled it. I then cut it into thirds lengthwise, and then into 1/2" sticks. Very easy. Then instead of powdered sugar I used superfine to roll them in once they cooled on the sheets for a few minutes.

I might have done something wrong but I don't think these cookies are that great. My coworkers liked them. I found rolling in powdered suger pastee to my fingers. I could only get about 40 cookies.

I haved mixed feelings about these cookies. They are extremely similar to Mexican wedding cookies, but shaped into logs. They were delicious when first baked, but soon became just sweet, because of all the powdered sugar. I took some to a cookie party, and I don't think anybody ate even one of them. My husband also hasn't seemed overly excited about them. But they are a very good version of this type of cookie, so if you like wedding cookies, you should love these.

Great recipe. I rolled them into balls. Much easier to do. They were a big hit with the men in my family. A Christmas favorite in my house.

I've a new name for my little neices--they are "Puckle Warts". We loved this recipe, but we sift the powdered sugar over the top rather than trying to roll them in the sugar. I have had requests for the recipe three times so far this Christmas season

These cookies were easy to make - but the end result was not quite as perfect as the picture in the magazine portrayed. The cookies flattened quite a bit as they baked and although I was very careful to keep the spoonfuls small, I only wound up with 40 cookies, not the 5 dozen noted. The taste was awesome though, my kids loved them and I would definitely make them again.

I made these for a cookie swap at church and they were gone in minutes! Everyone who got one wanted the recipe (even the men!) Easy, but if you use dark calphalon sheets, only bake for 25 minutes.
