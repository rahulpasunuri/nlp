This was a pretty good recipe--I'd give it 3.7 forks if I could. My dinner guests thought it tasted great. I didn't bother making the topping since we were already having such a rich meal (rack of lamb). As a finish, when the croustade came out of the oven, I brushed it with melted apricot jam to give it a glossy sheen. The crust was fairly flaky--I am not an experienced pie dough maker so perhaps I overworked it. I also struggled a bit to arrange the pears in attractive layers and wished that I had been more careful to keep the original slices together for layout and to keep the sizes as perfectly uniform as possible. Anyway, it turned out fine--rustic and golden.

I've made this dessert a number of times. I've always felt the crust comes out way too hard after the chill. Yesterday I made this and realized I had forgotten the chilled ice water ... what to do? I just took the dough from the fridge (1 hour) and put it in the processor - added that water and the dough was perfect! A really easy dessert to do. Great with French vanilla ice cream.

Very delicious dessert. I used cinnamon instead of allspice. Buttery crust was awesome.I baked it at 375 F on the convection setting. Only problem is that it is too small- not enough for seconds!

This is a very simple and elegant way to present pears as a dessert. The pastry dough was flaky and very buttery - in other words, delicious. While the recipe called for mace, I substituted cinammon instead. With regards to the topping of butter, sugar and flour, I would suggest one slight alteration. I would put some brown sugar in the mix as well. Whenever I make my apple galette I always top with brown sugar and when it bakes up in the oven it gets simply delicious! Also, I baked the crostade at 415 degrees. Enjoy!

We had some great fall pears from upstate New York, and this turned out to be a perfect recipe for them. It was fairly easy to make and suprisingly elegant. My husband said the pears melted in his mouth.

This has become one of our favorite desserts. It is so easy and quick to make. One of the best things is, it isn't too sweet. It's just perfect! When I roll out the pastry, the finished dough always looks like a jigsaw-puzzle-piece. With this croustade, it doesn't matter. It still comes out pretty and delicious!

In response to the Cook from Houston, TX on 03/13/99 who inquired about the baking temperature...I checked my March 98 Bon Appetit magazine and there it states the baking temperature to be 400 degrees. I have made this croustade before and enjoyed it very much.

Relatively easy dessert to prepare and very very good! The pears are a change from the normal desserts.
