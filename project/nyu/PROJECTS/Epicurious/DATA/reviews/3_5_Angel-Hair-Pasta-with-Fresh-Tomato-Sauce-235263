Loved this! A perfect summer pasta dish. Used 2 cloves garlic and was just right, nice and garlicky but not overwhelming. Some reviewers mentioned cooking down the tomato pulp, but I really don't think that is necessary, and certainly involves more work. If your tomatoes are very juicy, like mine were from my garden, just scoop the pulp from the bowl you grate the tomatoes in and leave the juice behind... or add as much of the juice as you feel you need. A very refreshing pasta.

We love this recipe - it's perfect during the hot summer days. I always add extra garlic and lemon juice. Other than that, it's a winner!

This was so easy and so good! I used dry farmed tomatoes. Delicious! I also seared sea scallops in olive oil with just salt and pepper and put them on top. That was a real treat but the pasta would've been great alone too.

This was quite good- everybody ate everything. It tended to be a little too much juice vs pulp, so I think I will do what the next review says next time. I am glad to have served it with garlic bread because that was good to "sop" it all up. Viva la homegrown tomato!

Agree with other reviewers that this is a recipe only for exquisite in-season fresh tomatoes. If that's what you have, this is fabulous. Followed others' suggestions and added 2 extra garlic cloves. Also strained out about 3/4 cup of juice an reduced that with a smashed garlic clove & some basil. stirred the hot pasta into that, let it soak up the reduction, then put the pasta in the bowl of tomatoes....letting it sit ten minutes is key, too. Will use this every summer when the tomatoes are beatific....

This was really good made with farm stand tomatoes. I added 2 pressed garlic cloves, but otherwise followed the sauce recipe. Instead of capellini, I used Buitoni cheese tortellini. It made a ton, so there were leftovers. That allowed the pasta to soak up the tomato juice. We ate it like a pasta salad, bringing it to room temp. It was good the first night, but absolutely divine the second! Definitely a keeper for all those summertime tomatoes.

Really, this is an easy, tasty recipe. It's not tomato season here, but I used "vine ripened" from the grocery that actually smelled like tomatoes. I think that's the key, if they have a lovely tomato smell, this will work well, if not, wait for in season tomatoes. I added an extra clove of garlic for good measure. Served as a side dish with lamb chops and roasted veggies. As a side, this was very generous portions.

As others have mentioned, do not bother with this recipe unless you have peak of season tomatoes. That said, when you do have those perfect tomatoes, this is a showcase for their flavor. Delicious!

Heirloom fresh tomatoes out of your garden are a must for this recipe. I drained about a cup of the liquid from my tomatos and reduced it by half while my pasta was cooking. After draining the pasta I returned the hot pasta to the pan and mixed the tomato reduction into the pasta and let it rest while I tore up the fresh basil leaves. This helps get the tomato flavor into the pasta. I added half the tomato mixture and basil, drizzled with olive oil, plated from the pot and finshed the plate by dividing the rest of the sauce and basil. An extra dash of oil, and freshly grated parmesan. One of summer's BEST!! A bit of garlic bread to sop up the remaiing "sauce" is a must.

Get exceptional tomatoes in season, season well with salt and pepper, and this is one of the simplest yet most memorable pasta dishes I've ever made.

Great sauce. I made a big mistake by heating it. Before I heated it the flavors blended nicely, very fresh. My suggestion is to keep to the recipe. It's a great recipe for a 1 or 2 person quick dinner.

Excellent, excellent, excellent. I echo previous recommendations to use only the freshest, best tomatoes. I first made it with penne instead of angel-hair pasta and without the basil (what I had on hand), doubled up on the garlic (I love garlic), and had it macerate for a good hour. It was amazing---fresh, fruity, and so easy. Tonight I'm making it again but have all of the ingredients on hand and expect it to be even better.

My 7 year old daughter loved this pasta! We will be having it again soon. It is great as a main dish....but it doesn't feed 6 people in our house....more like 3-4.

I love this recipe. It is easy to make, and easy to add to. I personally like to add more garlic. And when I am looking to make it more substantial, I will throw some cooked chicken into the mix.

this was great, much like I had when I lived in Milano. I did use a food processor to liquify some of the tomatoes. Seemed to work well.

Absolutely gorgeous. And so easy. I made it with cherry tomatoes (2/3 pulsed, 1/3 halved) and fresh whole wheat spaghettini. Fantastic!!!

I made this sauce for some homemade ravioli. I used heirloom tomatoes from our nearby farmer's market and this was incredible. It really depends on the quality of the tomatoes and then the sauce really just lets the great tomatoes shine. I used canned crushed garlic and it worked just fine and was a lot quicker.

I thought that this sauce was pretty yummy, and the whole not really cooking thing was great for a hot day. I agree with everyone else that the tomatoes have to be EXCELLENT. Whole Foods tomatoes won't cut it, and I didn't even think that my farmer's market tomatoes were good enough. Only my home-grown tomatoes were flavorful enough for this dish. I did an initial taste test and decided to add another clove of garlic, and it turned out to be a whole lot of garlic. I don't know how people can do 4 or 6 cloves. Wow. And I really like garlic, too. I put my pasta in a bowl, drizzled it with olive oil, sprinkled it with red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning, and put the sauce on top. It was really nice that way. If you have good tomatoes, I would say that this recipe is worth a try.

I've made this twice now, the first time un-cooked and it was surpisingly flavorful, but a little lackluster. Made it the second time and heated it up and it was delicious! Doubled garlic, 2 TBP's of olive oil and no sugar. The key is definitely the quality of the tomatoes.

Rating: 4
I believe that the few reviewers who thought this recipe lacked taste did not use the best and sweetest local tomatoes. Whole Foods does not always have local produce and their tomatoes might have traveled a long way and have been picked before maturity. Thus you are much better off buying tomatoes at the farmer's market. Then only pick those which smell fantastic, and you cannot go wrong. Also use plenty of good sea salt to enhance the flavors. No sugar necessary. Maybe a little more garlic but take care not to overpower the subtle taste of the tomatoes. Using a grater is a great trick, it eliminates the step of blanching the tomatoes first before peeling them. I did however squeeze the seeds out and discarded them before grating to improve the consistency of the sauce. As per other reviewers, toss the pasta in olive oil before adding the sauce. Yummy!!!

A fresh and light accompaniement to pasta. The sauce is a bit watery and I had to halve the amount of tomatoes. I also used raw sugar instead of fine sugar.

I was looking for an uncooked tomato sauce to use up some of my garden's bounty (ripe beefsteaks). Made this for a quick & delicious lunch. The sauce is watery and the capellini didn't soak up much liquid, but I didn't mind. The taste is fresh, simple, summer. I halved the recipe but used an extra clove of garlic & thought the amount was perfect. Also added olive oil & the chopped basil to the tomato mixture, rather than on the pasta afterwards.

Per some previous reviews, I added more garlic(two cloves) and added a couple tablespoons of olive oil. I, like others, was skeptical, but very pleasantly surprised by the flavor. I did not, however love the fresh tomatoes...they were farmer's market tomatoes and a little tough. I also used a large chop and wished I had chopped them more filnely. I will make this again, but I think I'm going to try it hot next time, so stay tuned...

I thought this was fabulous. I made it with heirloom Rose de Berne tomatoes from my garden, and am convinced it is the tomatoes that make it work --vine ripened tomatoes from the supermarket wouldn't do. I made it a second time with feta cheese and that was equally fabulous.

This recipe was amazing! I cut it in half for two, but I must disagree with other reviewers that there was Plenty of garlic in this dish--it stayed with me for several hours after dinner. Next time I will use much less. Also, I used half whole wheat pasta for some added fiber, and could hardly tell the difference between it and the regular pasta. This was light and delicious!

I used fresh Romas and halved yellow pear tomatoes from my garden. I would say for something this simple, be sure to use the best tomatoes available. I cut the recipe for two and used the biggest garlic clove I could find, since I think the recipe as is for 6 could probably use more. And added a splash of olive oil to the sauce for body and to keep the pasta from sticking together. I also put a sprinkle of basil in to sit with the sauce and added the rest as garnish, so the flavor could steep into the sauce. Wonderful and easy summer dish.

I tripled the amount of garlic and it still wasn't enough to give this recipe any taste. The basil was also overpowering. I think I am going to go back to cooked tomato sauced.

I thought this recipe was amazing as is. I am definitely a garlic lover, but I liked the lightness of one clove for this. I would try it as is first, and then add more only if you really think it needs it. The subtle kick is nice. It is essential to mash it with the salt to really distribute the flavor throughout the sauce. I did not think it needed any olive oil and I thought it was even better the next day. I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

Wonderful simple summer fare. Picked up tomatoes at a farmer's market which I am assuming made all the difference. I doubled the garlic and went heavy on the basil. I didn't have angel hair pasta so used penne instead. To serve, I tossed with a drizzle of olive oil and some parmesan reggiano. A great dish for tomato season. I let the tomato mixture sit at room temperature for about 4 hours and it didn't seem to suffer (didn't add basil until last minute).

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe very much even though I added too much garlic. Also I should have used crushed instead of chopped garlic and extra basil is absolutely necessary. I used $4 per pound tomatoes and it was definitely worth it.

I must say that I was skeptical about this dish. Very few ingredients, almost zero effort to make, and the tomato mixture looked a little scary in the bowl. I said, "This is going to be one boring pasta dish." Boy was I wrong! Absolutely delicious and a true keeper. I should warn others, I more than doubled the garlic and while the taste was perfect for me, it would likely be too much for those who don't like breathing fire all night.

I used beautiful, ripe tomatos from Whole Food and followed the recipe. But I have to agree with a previous reviewer that it is too bland. After plating it up and tasting it, I did add a little extra garlic and some oregano. That helped some but basically the tomato flavor just isn't as lively as when they are reduced in a tomato sauce.

Try making this while camping! Easy, fresh, fast, and tasty! I did throw in chunks of spicy sausage (kids cooked these on the fire), and forgot the basil. Used the sugar, lots of fresh pepper, fresh parm...served in ON arugula! Fantastic!

Very quick, light summer dinner. Fresh ingredients make for a healthy meal with no cooking required except the pasta. Serve with a salad and crusty bread and you're set. Definitely add the olive oil to keep pasta from clumping and to pump up the flavor.

delicious if using summer vine ripened tomatoes. However, if you want your dish to look like the illustration, then use half the pasta and cut the tomatoes in chunks. Plenty of flavour if the garlic is doubled. Don't chop all the basil, use some torn leaves (extra) for visual appeal.

Rating: 2
Being Italian, this recipe lacks the kick it needs to bring out the fresh tomato flavor. It is a basic recipe that needs a bit of improvement. Add more garlic...at least 6 cloves, crushed. Needs more fresh basil...to add at the beginning and then just before the sauce is combined with the pasta...I used 6 diced dried tomatoes to intensify the tomato flavor. I also like a pinch of oregano in the sauce and more Italian parsley to sprinkle on the serving plate.

A simple recipe. Similar to dishes I've thrown together without a recipe but I did like the idea of "grating" some of the tomatoes to make the chopped tomatoes into an actual sauce. I threw in some crumbled bacon to make it a little heartier.
