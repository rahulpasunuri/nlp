Unfortunately I did not get to make the couscous as I did not have any on hand. I made the patties and expected great things from the aroma, but in the end they were just ok. I want to try again with the couscous and lower the cooking time (mine were too dry).

I agree with the other reviewers that the couscous is nothing special, and does need a sauce of some nature. The only change I made was to grind my own lamb. We found the flavors evenly balanced and will be making the remainder as "burgers."

This recipe delivers the perfect tasting lamb patties -- wonderful flavor and easy preparation. Have made them a couple of times, once pan frying them and the other time grilling them - perferred grilling as it help reduce the greasiness. In place of fennel seeds used 1 1/4 tsp fennel pollen -- no other changes. The couscous is good side, but nothing special.

I have been searching for the perfect lamb burger recipe and this is IT. love the spicy background. i fried mine in a cast iron skillet..we like our lamb very pink. they were crunchy on the outside with a perfect delish interior. The couscous was a great compliment. I added a mixed green salad with lemon dressing, made a fresh cilantro yogurt sauce and sliced tomatoes.

So great to have found an alternative to our regular dinner fare. we served crumbled feta atop the burgers and it added a bit of extra yum. Based on this recipe, I'm keeping ground lamb in the freezer. thanks!!

Made this as directed, but reducing spices proportionately as only ground lamb available here comes in 1 lb prepacks. Found the 1 tsp fennel overpowered everything else, tho this might be because I made a few hours in advance to let flavors permeate the meat.

I only made the lamb portion, and I actually fashioned the spiced meat around skewers and grilled it. Tasted fantastic. I made the harissa myself using a recipe I saw on a BBC site(http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/harissa_82929), using Goya pimientos and a can of Mexican red jalapenos, rather than the fresh chiles and roasted red pepper in that recipe. The sausages, served on a pita, were delicious. The mix of spices gave it a good, authentic taste. Today I am trying with lean ground beef, rather than the lamb, for cost and calorie reasons. I'm sure this will also taste amazing!

Delectable! I made them small - so you could have more than one! I also just crushed the fennel seeds with the end of a spoon rather than grinding them, worked fine. Used some cayenne pepper instead of harissa. Used regular rasins. The leftover lamb patty was delicious on a dinner roll for lunch! Definitely takes the "lamby-ness" out of the dish - even people who think they don't like lamb would like this.

This recipe was amazing, and incredibly easy to make. I couldn't fine harissa, so I substituted sriracha as another reviewer suggested and the lamb turned out great. The couscous went very well with the lamb, but is also good on its own.

Excellent recipe, similar to the merguez I've had in a fine Moroccan restaurant. I use currants though instead of golden raisins, and recommend Kitchen Basics chicken broth for the couscous.

Very nice! After toasting the fennel seeds I did not use a grinder, but used a mortor and pestle which was perfect. I am glad I found Harissa sauce, as that was an important ingredient. Served with a cucumber salad with Greek yogurt & feta which was a refreshing compliment with the spicey patties. Medium rare is best, as you do not want the patties to dry out.

Delicious. I did not make the couscous, but the patties were devoured. Served them in homemade pita with tzatziki and lettuce, with a cucumber radish salad on the side. Outrageous.

Delicious and easy! We loved this and will definitely make it again.

I'm making if for the third time tonight. My whole family loves this recipe, including my two 15yo boys. Just the right degree of spiciness, and a beautiful melange of flavors. I think of the Middle East when I eat these wonderful patties. The couscous is always a hit also.

Just ok. It's VERY spicy. There wasn't much nuance to this recipe as all I could taste was the harissa.

This turned out great, I halved the recipe because I'm cooking for just my husband and I and we only had a heavy half-pound of ground lamb. We received a jar of Moroccan Harissa as part of a gift and I was happy to have found another use for it. I didn't have, neither do my husband or I like fennel seeds, so they weren't included for both reasons. I didn't have any stock on hand so I used water but first I toasted the whole wheat couscous I used with some olive oil and added some cinnamon, cumin and coriander before adding the water and bring the whole thing to a boil. We'll definitely be thinking of this again next time we find some ground lamb at the grocery store. The description captured this dish perfectly, the sweet raisins go perfectly with the aromatic spices in the lamb. Excellent!

excellent recipe, super simple to make and taste is amazing. Will be making again.

Incredible recipe and incredibly easy. Try the couscous as a side on its own with other dishes. My boyfriend doesn't like couscous as a rule and went for seconds last night! And zesting the lemon directly over the cooked couscous saves a dish and prep time.

REALLY good. The first time I made this I didn't have ground lamb (used veal) or fennel seeds (used caraway). Still very good, but tonight followed the recipe to the letter and it was terrific. I made my own "harissa" (the requirement for this ingredient would have intimidated me before): 6oz. jar of drained roasted red peppers, 1 1/2 tsp. olive oil, 1 garlic clove, 1/2 tsp cumin seed, and 1/4 tsp each of coriander seed, caraway seed, and dried red hot pepper flakes. Combine all ingredients in a blender and puree. Add salt and pepper to taste. Bon appetit!

Tasty and super fast. Followed the recipe exactly, except made the patties a little smaller -- into 8 patties instead of 4. Next time I would make them even smaller, more like the merguez you get in a restaurant.

These were incredible. My husband raved, "I hope these go into the rotation of things you make all the time. 10/10!"

This was really very good. Very easy and fast, but really tasty! At 9 minutes in the pan, my patties were a bit past medium rare, but they were still quite good. I varied the couscous a bit (apricots and pine nuts instead of golden raisins) so I can't comment on that aspect of the recipe. Served it with the Moroccan carrot salad from this site for a really great meal.

I loved this meal. I didn't have any harissa so I used a dash of sriracha to add the spiciness. Very quick, easy, and inexpensive.
