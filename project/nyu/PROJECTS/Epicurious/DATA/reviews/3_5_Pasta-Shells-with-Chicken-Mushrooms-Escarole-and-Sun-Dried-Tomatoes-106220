Good simple recipe. It was a clean out the fridge night so used the arugala and chicken breasts I had on hand. I also added red bell peppers. It is basic but we enjoyed it enough to have again.

Fantastic! I made this recipe, but altered it using chicken sausage that I had browned and crumbled with some fennel seeds. Used twice as much pasta as recommended to serve 4 guests. Delicious!! I can't imagine roast chicken was better than this.

This is a really good week night dinner recipe. The escarole and the sun dried tomatoes make a great taste combination.

Really yummy dish. I double the amount of greens.

One of my new favorite recipes. The escarole really adds a great flavor. I used sauteed chicken breast, added a little flour to the oil that I cooked in and some white wine.

Great dish for using left over roast chicken. Amped up the spice a bit by using a little extra hot pepper and, like several other reviewers, I lightened up on the amount of liquid.

This was quite good for an easy, one-dish dinner. However, it seemed just a little bland to me.

Yes, I made the recipe with escarole, and I have found that it is even better with more escarole. Once I had some leftover fresh spinach and tossed it in as well, which worked great. I don't like hot pepper, so I skipped the red pepper flakes; likewise I don't like sun- dried tomatoes, so I used an undrained can of diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano, or something like that, and reduced the amount of chicken broth a little; also I used regular mushrooms instead of shiitake. Like most of the cooks who have reviewed this recipe I changed several ingredients, and it is truly delicious no matter how I make it.

Used spinach instead of escarole, a roasted chicken pulled and 16 oz pasta and absolutely delish!

I made this tonight and I used 1/2c white wine, and 1/2c chicken stock, and spinach instead of escarole!This was really good. It doesn't look too appealing in the beginning but it turned out awesome.

Very good. Used rotisserie chicken breast from local store.Based on other reviews I mixed 1 1/2 c chicken stock w/ 1/2 c white wine but only added 1 1/2 cups of the mixture, which was perfect. Next time I'll try spinach (husband wasn't crazy about escarole) and add more mushrooms. My sundried tomatoes were dry and I softened w/ hot water.

I made this pretty much according to the directions. Yes - I used escarole. It was delicious! I did increase the sun-dried tomatoes and the red pepper and decreased the amount of chicken broth to make it more of a "pasta" instead of a "soup". It is definitely a keeper. Black olives could be added with no problem, but I didn't because my husband hates olives. More cheese would be good, too. Other than that......

This was a good recipe and very easy to make. We didn't really like the escarole though. Perhaps I overcooked it. When I make this again I will use either kale or spinach, since it seems other reviewers enjoyed those greens.

Wow! So colorful and flavorful. I too didn't have any escarole so I substituted spinach.

Very simple and very tasty. Had to substitute Russian Red Kale and Oyster Mushrooms. Overall a very nice dish!

I never duplicate a recipe, always add something. This time I sauteed some boneless, skinless chick breasts accented w/ Creole seasonings and used spinach in the place of escarole. Added 3-4tbs of my homemade pesto and used 1/2 white wine and 1/2 chick broth. Everyone was happy, will keep this recipe!

Okay, I hate it when reviewers alter the recipe and then rate it.....but, spinach instead of escarole, added artichoke hearts and black olives, mozzarella as well as parmesan. Delicious!

Rating: 3
I also made this with Spinach because that was the only green I had in the house. Will def. try again with the escarole because I felt something was missing. My husband loved it! I think next time I would double the shitake and sundried tomato, I could barely taste them. Also I added about 1/2 cup of white wine which enhanced the flavor greatly.

Rating: 3
This was surprisingly good as the sauce is basically chicken stock - rotisserie chicken was really delicious in this. I made a couple of substitutions based on what I had in the house - broccoli, cavatappi and roasted tomatoes instead of escarole, pasta shells and sundried tomatoes. Oh yes, I must admit I cooked three slices of chopped bacon (draining off most of the fat) before sauteeing the garlic as I couldn't resist. My boyfriend ate a ridiculously large amount of this (he went for thirds) so I can't argue with that kind of proof!

Absolutely delicious!!!

tasty recipe. i don't know why anyone, however, would choose spinach over the escarole; its flavor is essential to the dish. i added some white wine, a little more red pepper and roasted the garlic beforehand. based on a previous review i also roasted the chicken breast with some olive oil and rosemary. i mixed it all together with brown rice pasta instead of regular pasta and did NOT top it off with the cheese. its a great low fat/low cal keeper.

Solid recipe... use rotisserie chicken for more flavor!

Rating: 3
We loved this dish! Looks a little "white" so next time will used colored pasta. The escarole tasted awfully bitter uncooked so we did not use the entire amount, however, it was delicious cooked in the dish. For more flavor we used fresh cheese ravioli-great choice. Don't be afraid of the escarole. We served it with a warm spinach salad and crusty rolls. A real keeper!

I was expecting this to be a main dish but I consider it a soup I also used spinach instead of escarole but I thought it was a great recipe I use it all the time

I'd make this again only with significant changes. Sorry to say it was watery and not as full-flavored as I had hoped. One of the few Epicurious recipes that I haven't been crazy about.

Great recipe, tried it last night and couldn't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch. Not much on presentation but it is very tasty. I didn't have time to roast a chicken so I pan seared some chicken in olive oil and it worked great. A definite keeper.

Yes, this recipe is good! And yes, I did use Escarole - it's a much more suitable veg in this dish than spinach. It sort of looks like butter leaf lettuce....chop it up in the same way, discard the core...enjoy!

I roasted my own chicken (instead of buying one) when I made this, and I think it made all the difference. I also used spinach instead of escarole, though I'd be willing to try it with the latter now that I know the recipe is so good! This is a definite keeper!

This dish doesn't look like much when it's served but it's deceptively flavorful! I won't use quite as much pasta next time as it seemed to be too much for me - there's so much other good stuff: mushrooms, tomatoes, chicken and the spinach. Did anyone actually make this with escarole?

I used brown rice instead of pasta and dish was fantastic. Having a good quality freshly grated parm made a big difference, too. This one goes into my "impress my company" repetoire (oh, and shhhh, it was easy to make).

This is a good healthy family dinner and pleasing to the eye. I used spinach instead of escarole and I used regular mushrooms. The pasta I used was orichette. My boyfriend thought it was delicious and it was very easy to make. It tasted like I thought it should.

Wonderfully tasty recipe; substituted oyster mushrooms for shiitake (because I'm cheap!) but was still good-- would have been amazing with shiitakes! Will add this to regular rotation!

Tasty dish! I made this as a casual dinner for a guest and my boyfriend, and they raved. I substituted one cup of the chicken broth with a dry white wine, and added some chopped kalamata olives to the mix for added flavor. Freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano topped it off tastily. Artichoke hearts would make a nice addition, but the recipe is great with the minimal ingredients.

This was an excellent way to use up left over deli chicken. And soooo easy & fast! I made 1/2 recipe for my husband & self. No medium shells, so used elbow mac instead. 1 cup. Spinach worked just fine. It was more than enough food for the 2 of us. With a salad, garlic bread/toast & ice cream for dessert, this will serve as a fine easy week night supper for a couple & 2 boys. This is going to be one of my favorite ways to use up that last bit of chicken of anything!

I haven't made this, but I am wondering how one can serve four people on only 5 oz. of pasta, unless the other ingredients add a lot to the overall dish. My family (including two boys ages 10 and 12) consumes an entire pound of pasta at one sitting. Any recipe can be considered healthy if you only eat a tiny bit! Goes to show you how important it is to always read the labels!

This recipe was easy to prepare and delicious! I substituted penne pasta and was very pleased with the results. I would recommend this dish to pasta lovers who want to get away from fattier cream-based sauces. With its fresh, healthy taste, it provides a lighter (but still very flavorful) alternative to more traditional pasta recipes.

Wonderful light dish. I also substituted spinach. Baked 2 chicken breasts on a bed of chopped celery, onions and carrots. Used the juices and vegtables as the broth. Very tasty. I will make it again although, slightly below the bar of serving to company.

This is an enjoyable, easy-to-prepare, low-fat dish. I have substituted Kale -- which has more nutritional value -- for the escarole. I also like to add red pepper to give the dish some extra kick.

Easy to put together for a weeknight. Added extra garlic. Didn't have escarole so I used a box of chopped spinach, and it worked great. Served it with gnocchi rather than pasta. It was satisfying and filling. Not like Low-fat at all!

I made this dish last night and it was great! I couldn't find any escarole, so used kale instead. Had to cook a bit longer and added extra garlic to make up for the change in greens. Roasting the chicken makes such a difference! I popped a couple chicken breasts in the oven when I got home (seasoned with a little olive oil, salt, pepper and rosemary), and they were ready to shred and add to the mix at the appropriate time. I will definitely make this dish again.

It seems as though this recipe is not really worth the trouble. The flavor is okay but the escarole brings a bitter flavor. I was wondering if fresh spinach would better do the trick.

Yummy, yummy, yummy. I cut in 1/2 for just the two of us... and "wing it" with the amount of mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. LOVE the escarole. Perfect week night dinner. Most definitely a keeper.

This was so good and easy to make. Good for a week night but I would also serve this for company. I used pre-sliced white mushrooms, and a roasted chicken from the supermarket to speed things along. I would add more garlic next time. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

This was just super. Equally delicious AND healthy. Wonderful combination of flavors. (Note I used "normal" mushrooms rather than shiitake.) I will definitely make this again. With more chicken broth and small pasta shells it could be eaten as a soup.

I don't think I had ever cooked escarole before, and was a litle worried when the pan was full of all that green stuff. But it cooked down nicely in the alloted time, and then I was a little worried about all the juice in the pan. But somehow it all came out alright, and it was a nice, light but satisifying dish. I cur down the oil to 1 tsp and used baby bellas, since I couldn't find shitakes (I'm in St. Pete right now). I couldn't find tomatoes without oil, but rinsed the oil packed ones wit5h the pasta water, so very little oil was left, just to cut the fat grams back a bit.

Made this for a dinner party and guests loved it. I tasted delicious and the chisken broth was a great alternative to a cream sauce. I used button mushrooms instead of the shiitake and it was great. Will make it again.

This was a tasty and healthy dish, easy to prepare on a weeknight. I used whole wheat macaroni but forgot to add the sun dried tomatoes! It is a definate do-over. My husband is a notorious hater of "healthy" food and he enjoyed it as well.
