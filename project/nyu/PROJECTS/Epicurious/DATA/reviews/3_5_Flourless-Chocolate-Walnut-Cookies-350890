I am not sure why the egg whites were not beaten before being added to the other ingredients. mine came out tasty, like brownie cookies.

Sorry! This is listed as a low carb recipe. But with 3 CUPS powdered sugar? I dont think so! 6 carbs per cookie is not low carb. Labeling the recipe low carb is very misleading. Lrana

Made a half-batch, pulsing walnuts in food processor. Used only 1 cup of confectioners sugar but kept the 1/4 tsp salt. Put unbaked cookies in freezer for 5 min. before baking. Baked in 350 convection oven for 12 minutes. Turned out great!

I haven't made them yet but I think the problem is that the ingredients are given by volume and not by weight. To get consistent results it would have been ideal that the ingredients in the recipe where given by weight. Francois Payard is a wonderful chef but in all his books the ingredients are given by volume and the results vary. I am planning to make them today and weight the ingredients and adjust in the future as necessary.

These are great cookies. According to Payard's book for the same recipe, as soon as the cookies go into the oven, the temperature should be turned down to 320F. The timing is about the same.

The quantities of ingredients I used weren't quite proportionate to the recipe, but the end result was very good. I used half toasted walnuts, half toasted hazelnuts and A LOT of cocoa.

Delicious! Chewy, chocolatey, nutty. Made recipe as written; used a fork to mix. 15 minutes was spot on for the perfect mix of crispy exterior and chewy interior. It is helpful to allow the cookies to cool for a few minutes (slide the parchment off the cookie sheet onto the counter or rack so they will cool quickly) before attempting to remove them.

These cookies can be amazing, but the recipe is definitely finicky. After trying the flourless chocolate cookies at Vons grocery store, I had to try to make them myself. The keys to ending up with a cookie that is chewy and not flat as a pancake: 1. As the other reviewers noted, the batter should be like thick brownie dough. Add the egg whites a little at a time. 2. Froth the egg whites SLIGHTLY prior to adding them. They should just have bubbles on the surface but should not look at all opaque. 3. Use "Dutch Process" cocoa - trust me, I made it with regular cocoa and the cookies were like burnt, crispy pancakes at the end of the 14 min. 4. Use good quality cocoa powder - if you use the cheap stuff, all you will taste is the sugar. 5. Don't skimp on the nuts - they help to add structure to the cookie. Chop them relatively fine so they are evenly spread throughout the batter. 6. If your cookies are crisp and flat on the edges, turn your oven down to 325. 7. If your cookies are still flat - refrigerate the dough (or put it in the freezer for a few min) prior to baking. I'm making these for a party and tried multiple times to get them right. Hope you learn from my mistakes and enjoy - they are great cookies.

Forget the confectioner's sugar -- I use 1 cup of Florida Crystals or any other kind of unrefined sugar. They come out dark and not too sweet. Substituting toasted sliced almonds for the walnuts is also delish.

Rating: 3
Good recipe. As others have said, very sweet. Maybe more unsweetened cocoa and less sugar? Also less bake time will make them nice and chewy. I was trying to find a way to get my vegetarian wife to get omega-3s while she is pregnant. This recipe worked. Lots of walnuts and I added a bunch of flaxmeal to the recipe which doesn't affect the taste but boosts the nutritional value.

I did not make these, but with 3 cups of sugar - these are hardly "low carb."

I tried these with Splenda to cut the carbs and the result was not good at all. I don't recomend replacing it all. I'm not giving a rating since I didn't follow the recipe, but I wanted to let lo carbers know how it went.

merely OK. I won't make again--I had hoped for a chewy moist cookie, but mine came out crispier than I'd hoped--and also too sweet, and not chocolatey enough. If I made again (unlikely) i would cut back on sugar and add some chopped chocolate or mini chips.

Rating: 2
Very yummy and light. I also love that they're gluten free. The thing is, the texture changes and they become almost inedible after 3 days in a container. I had to nuke them for a few seconds to soften them.

Rating: 4
I had no problems making this recipe as stated. I did put 3 egg whites first and only added the 4th when it was clear it was needed to do a brownie-type dough. I also sifted the confectioner's sugar (2 1/4 cups was plenty sweet) and the cocoa before mixing in the nuts. Left the cookies on the parchment paper for 5 minutes before attempting to remove them: no problem. Outstanding dessert for us lactose-intolerant.

Rating: 3
My confectioners sugar contains cornstarch, not wheat and I really like this recipe. However, the simplicity of it can seem frightening when you actually go to make them. Wasn't sure how finely chopped the nuts should be; maybe it was like a flour to replace the flour? But I didn't do that. The nuts were chunky. Sifted the sugar and cocoa together before adding the roughly/coarsely chopped nuts. My egg whites were room temperature, so I did use a fork to bring the ingredients together. When I saw how shiny they were as I took them out of the oven, I knew I did something right. They look just like those in the Italian bakery.

be careful if you are making this for someone that is on a wheat free diet for any reason, confectioner's sugar contains wheat flour

Rating: 1
too sweet, not chocolaty enough, a waste of time. Also unhappy with the texture, not chewy. I'd say, don't bother, but if you are tempted, add chopped chocolate, it might help the one dimensional flavor. I made these for a big party, but won't serve them

Disappointing; overly chewy, runny batter... I later read the note from Cook "From New York NY Magazine website "http://nymag.com/restaurants/recipes/inseason/45991/comments.html#comments. On the second page is a comment from the Payard cookbook tester who explains why some have good results and some don't. The most important part - This recipe completely depends on your egg whites. If your using Large eggs, medium eggs, etc. It will make a huge difference. Start with using 2 egg whites, and then slowly add the rest. The mix should look like thick brownie mix, that can be scooped...if your dont use all the whites, it is OKAY." SO I think this is poor recipe writing...

Good cookies but way too sweet for my taste. I did leave out the nuts to cut back on the fat content, I'm sure they would have been helpful in cutting through the overwhelming sweetness.

I agree with all the comments about this being a terrible choice for diabetics. 3 cups of sugar??? Are you out of your mind??? Do yourself a favor, try Splenda and low-carb chocolate chips instead...

I loved this recipe because it was easy and the cookies came out exactly the meringue way I was hoping for, even in a finicky oven and with previously frozen egg whites.

Rating: 4
Ok so first off I agree with other reviews, 3 cups of confectioners sugar isn't exactly healthy. However....these cookies were a HUGE hit! 15 min. is the perfect time in the oven to make them crispy and chewy and they are easy to make (although my handheld mixer got a workout because the batter is sticky). Make sure everything is mixed before you add the egg whites. I served them with sorbet and they got devoured.

Rating: 3
Great recipe, but what exactly is LOW- CARB about 3 cups of white, powdered sugar??? It is the absolutely, unequivically THE WORST kind of carb for a Diabetic... so why did it come up in the advanced search for low-carb recipes? This may be a good cookie, but it ain't low-carb, baby!

I made these tonight and they were outstanding! Made them exactly as the recipe called for and they came out perfect. They did not stick to the parchment paper, baked them for 15 min, @ 350. Will make these again and again!

These are more like meringues than cookies and had a very interesting consistency - crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I read all the reviews before attempting these cookies and made the following modifications: - only 1 cup of nuts (I didn't have walnuts so I used hazelnuts) - 2.5 cups of sugar - this was still waaay too much, the sweetness overpowered the cocoa. - I added a dash of baking powder which gave it a nice cookie shape - I used 4 egg whites, but they were tiny eggs. The consistency was like brownie better, very easy to scoop. Like someone else mentioned, keep adding the egg whites gradually until the dry ingredients bind together. Finally, leave the cookies on the parchment paper for about 5 minutes before removing. If you try to remove it straightaway, it will stick. You definitely do not need to grease it up!

Rating: 4
Yeah, I just made these again. It is raining and I was worried with the egg whites and rain these would not turn out. I doubled the recipe and they are so good. They actually rose and bigger than I expected. Double the recipe, use parchment paper after each batch. They should turn out nicely.

Great but, did everyone's cookies look like the photos?? Mine definitely did not spread - I used toasted pecans and only 1 cup of sugar after reading the reviews. Delicious but, they look more like chocolate nut clusters :)

AMAZING! I didn't have walnuts, so I used pecans and I didn't even have enough of those, so I added a little shredded coconut and threw in some dark chocolate chips and they turned out great!

the recipe is simple and the cookies are decent, I was thinking more along the lines of a gateau reine de saba and they are not. Also the first two times I made them i followed baking directions to the letter and the bottoms were burnt beyond repair, for those of you in higher altitudes 10-12 minutes makes them perfect. I will continue to make them for my gluten sensitive friends and when I need a quick chocolate fix but not as spectacular as I envisioned.

I found these while looking for a gluten free cookie recipe. They are delicious! - and extremely quick and easy. Almost everytime I make them someone asks for the recipe. They took 3 egg whites during the summer, 4 the last time I made them which was during the winter.

Easy, delicious, and not too unhealthy! Some people have complained that these are too sweet. I actually have cut the sugar significantly each time I've made them, and they're still good and shape up well.

These cookies are the bomb - and come out perfect every time, even if you're not a baker. Did them twice with all walnuts for Thanksgiving and then tried with half walnuts/half pecans for Xmas party - which got rave reviews as well. A little more of a sweet-savory mix than walnuts alone. This recipe will be a go-to!!

Wow. These are great! Accidentally made them with regular sugar (but a finer variant meant for baking, I don't know what it's called in English) and used slightly less than the prescribed amount of eggwhites. Added 2 minutes to the baking time because my oven is dodgy and tends to leave cookies' bottoms uncooked. Left them to cool for a few minutes before peeling them off the bakingsheet without a problem. Nice and crunchy, and a chewy centre. I love it!

If you like these you have no sense of taste, these cookes have no body and are not fit for any human to eat, thanks!

OMG these are like Brownie Edges! I always want the corner and edge brownies for the chewy, crispy texture. I've even seen a pan designed to bake nothing BUT edge brownies so I must not be alone! Each cookie is like one big brownie edge! YUM. Followed recipe EXCEPT, per suggestions, used 3 1/2 egg yolks (stopped when the dough was like thick brownie batter), and briefly rested parchment on a wet towel to get them to release. That did the trick! They turned out perfectly. Thanks for the suggestions! They aren't exactly pretty but the taste/texture makes up for it.

I find the directions for this recipe to be incomplete: first, the parchment paper should be oiled--I don't understand how anyone could just peel off the paper since these cookies have no fat content; second, the egg whites should be beaten to soft peaks before combining or the results are very runny. My first batch came out more like meringue with nuts, tasty but a bit dry and flat. With the beaten egg whites, the difference was remarkable.

This is listed under Passover recipes, but this is slightly misleading. It's not technically Kosher for Passover, unless you use Kosher of Passover Confectioner's sugar. Regular confectioner's sugar is made from cornstarch, and corn (if you are an Ashkenazic Jew, as many Americans & Europeans are) you do not eat corn on Passover.

A search for "low carb Passover" at this website brings us this Flourless Chocolate-Walnut Cookies recipe. While these cookies might taste good and they don't contain flour, they are certainly not low carb with their suggested 3 cups of confectioners' sugar! Diabetics and others who must watch their sugar and carbohydrate intake should definitely take note and be forewarned!

These are easy to make and turned out rich and gooey. I followed the directions exactly. Though,I did change baking time to 10 minutes. Cooled for 3 minutes prior to taking off the baking sheet. My husband especially liked these. He is on W.W. and requested that I add this recipe to my main collection of all time favorites. 2 cookies = 2 points.

I loved the crunchy, shiny crust with a fudgy center. No trouble with the removal from parchment paper.

I just made these and they tasted good, firm on the outside and a bit fudgelike in the middle. They were not pretty, though. The cookies stuck to the paper and were very crumbly when I finally unstuck them. I would not serve them to anyone other than my family, because they look terrible.

I've got to honest, this recipe was yummy, but the 3 cups of icing sugar was far too much and too sweet at the end of the day. Next time I think I will either try 2 and a half cups or will try subbing in some applesauce and splenda. Overall tasty, but the recipe needs some altering to be perfect.

Rating: 4
A dream! I usually don't bake, so these were easy (and nutritious)! The only changes are I didn't want to use 3 cups of sugar (that seemed like too much for me) so I used half Splenda, and half applesauce. Mmm mmm SO moist.

I didn't enjoy this as much as I'd hoped I would. I made it for a friend who can't eat flour, but I'm going to search for other recipes. I might have liked it better if the walnuts weren't toasted. I also thought the cookies, although moist, were a bit similar to meringues. I didn't love the flavor, but they were easy to make.

Rating: 4
These taste so much better than they should. They are sort of a brownie cookie, with a great texture and are really moist. I made them about 2x bigger, which came out to about 30 cookies. I think to get 60 you would have to make them VERY small. Baked them for exactly 12 minutes and they came out great. Also, a stand mixer made it very easy.

Rating: 4
I made the recipe as is and thought it was great! Very chocolatey but not too rich. I baked them for about 13 min at 350, and cooled them on the parchment paper before gently peeling them off the paper. This way they came off quite easily and kept their nice shape.

Rating: 4
This is my second time making the recipe. And I made it with toasted hazelnuts again. First time I made it in the toaster oven, where all the cookies melted together into a thin brownie like thing. It tasted excellent. This time I made it in the oven where the cookies wouldn't melt together. First batch I made came out crispy and very stuck to the oiled baking sheet. It was very hard getting them off. I threw that batch out. For the next batch I used aluminum foil underneath. At least this way the cookies could be carefully peeled off. And this time I cooked them for about 9 minutes, just until the tops started cracking. This time they were very gooey and chewy, and I got to tell you, they were quite yummy. I guess the only correct way to make these cookies is to keep them soft and chewy. I gave the cookies out as parting gifts after Christmas dinner. People loved them and requested the recipe. So I'm sorry other reviewers didn't like them much, but I'm wondering if they overcooked the cookies. And I think next time I'll prepare this recipe in a brownie pan to make sure the center stays chewy, and just serve squares.

I could not believe how good these cookies were. I made them just as directed. I also had problems removing them from waxed paper, but after cooling they were easier to remove. Next time I will probably just grease the sheet before baking.

I must have used substandard parchment paper(I bought a different brand), but my cookies stuck to the paper. I also only used 2 cups of sugar, which may be why they weren't flawless. However, I did use walnuts and these cookies are delicious. Next time, I'll try it with 3 cups of sugar.

I tried this recipe with hazelnuts, using the same amount of hazelnuts as the recipe says to use for walnuts, and note that the recipe did not come out well at all. The cookies are overly nutty and I suspect that if using hazelnuts, one should use less than 2.5 cups (maybe 1.5 cups would be better) and I also think that hazelnuts need to be toasted for longer than walnuts.

Rating: 0
I followed the recipe and was surprised by how good these cookies were. Given the lack of fat (other than the nuts) and flour, I was skeptical, but they are very tasty, moist, and gooey. I baked them for only 12 minutes.

Wow! I changed the walnut to toasted hazelnuts (toasted at 325 for about 20 minutes, then peeled off the thin, bitter skins). And I used Dutch processed cocoa. The dough really spread out flat in the oven with the heat. But, wow! So yummy! I'm glad there's no flour in this recipe to get in the way of the taste. And toasted hazelnuts, IMHO, are the best nuts to pair with chocolate.
