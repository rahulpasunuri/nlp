Made this for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and he couldn't stop raving about it. It's much more of a custard than the bread pudding I'm accustomed to, but it was delicious. I halved the ingredients but still had so much extra caramel sauce. No worries though, it's delicious so I'm sure we'll put it to good use!

We have made this recipe twice. It was delicious both times, but here's what we found: 1) use a dense white bread, not a dry/light one. It falls apart. 2) The carmel sauce is delicious but it makes way more than the bread pudding--even with carmel lovers eating dessert, we still wound up with huge amounts left over after the pudding was gone. Unless you want to deal with the leftovers (not a terrible thing, but still) I would say halve the sauce recipe. Very tasty--everyone who has tried it has loved it!

I made this exactly as written except I left out the currants. Just don't like them. So, the taste was good, but there was way too much custard and not enough bread. The sauce tasted more of the rum than caramel, good, but not caramel. Next time I'll use French bread rather than PF, and cut the rum in half.

Just made the Caramel Sauce to go over Turtle Sundaes for dessert on Christmas Eve and it was delish. Also works well with Amaretto rather than rum. If you have leftovers of the sauce be sure to store it in a microwaveable container as it crystallizes when it gets cold. But the caramel smooths out and is velvety sweetness when it's reheated. I'll make the bread pudding another time - but from now on when I need Caramel Sauce - this is my "go to" recipe.

Made this twice: once with PF bread and once with "Hawaiian" Bread, not always available, it's kinda like challah? The Hawaiian bread version was superior and I left it in the fridge overnight. Sauce is spectacular--not a drop left, cause the leftovers were used on ice cream.

This was pretty good, though really heavy on the egg and cream/milk quantity. It was too custardy for my taste.

Every one of my guests loved this bread pudding--and I never even got to make the accompanying sauce.

Big hit with this one. I used Whole Foods white. Had to bake it about 1/3 more than called for. Sauce is very decadent and delicious. I made half with whiskey and half with rum and they were both great!

Heavenly! As per a previous reviewer, I used Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse Hearty White bread. I assembled the bread pudding and refrigerated it overnight. The bread really soaked up the custard mixture. The next morning I brought it to room temp and baked it - just perfect. The caramel sauce is outstanding. Very easy to prepare.

Incredible recipe and easy to make. I made this for a New Year's Eve party and between the slightly egg noggish flavor to the rum sauce, it was a hit. I served the rum sauce on the side so people could add individually desired amounts (and so the leftovers were just as good). I made it the day before - and it still was delicious at the party. The bread wasn't very stale, so I did a light toasting in the over for a few minutes till the tops and bottoms were slightly stiff (but not brown). I also used milk instead of cream in the caramel sauce - and it was still very rich and yummy.

I wasn't impressed with the bread pudding. Followed the recipe and it could have been better.

This reciepe has become my 1# dish. I tried making several other bread puddings and this is the best. If I was not dieting all the time, I would make it every other week!

Just a suggestion, if you use a loaf of almost stale frenchbread that works best. In a traditional southern bread pudding that is what we use. Hope that helps..

I haven't made this recipe yet, but on a previous attempt at bread pudding, I left the bread out overnight to dry out before soaking it. Seems to then soak up a lot of liquid. Maybe this trick would help the previous reviewer.

I've been to the Bluewater, and their bread pudding is wonderful. My version wasn't. I used Pepperidge Farm original bread, and it didn't soak up enough of the custard. If you try this recipe, I'd use a brioche or something like that.

This was amazing--so rich but so worth it. I love both good bread pudding and flan, but my family is skeptical, finds it too high-fat and/or too bland. But this was a big hit. I loved the flan texture. I used Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse Hearty White bread (something we never buy--my daughter couldn't believe I was using white bread and corn syrup in a recipe) and needed only 8 big slices; made a very smooth and pretty look. I made only half the sauce--really lovely--which was plenty. And I did lighten it very slightly: used 1% milk and 1/2 & 1/2 in pudding, and 6 whole eggs total rather than yolks. It was fabulous...and I wonder whether next time I might even get away with all whole (or lighter) milk for my very fat-sensitive eaters. Definitely try this recipe.

I went with the suggestion from Tulsa and the crossaints are the way to go. I used dried cranberries and everyone raved. It sounds challenging, but it is so simple. On the sauce, I cut the brown sugar to 1/2lb, I wish I had just cut all of the ingredients for the sauce in 1/2 since I had so much left over. It's excellent! YUM!

This bread pudding was a huge hit with the group I served. I used croissant rolls instead of white bread and soaked raisins (not currants) in rum before sprinkling them on the bread. Other than that I followed the recipe. It's the first time I have used the water bath for bread pudding and I will definitely make it again.

I am a big fan of bread pudding, and I have rarely had one this good. The currants really are delicious in this pudding, though I am eager to try dried cranberries as well. The only thing I would do different next time is cut down on the sauce by about 1/4, as I had a lot left over after we finished the dish. Or maybe leave some sugar out of it so that we can pour more on the pudding without overpowering it. Overall it was marvelous, and I recommend it to anyone.

This was soooo good. I substituted dried cranberries for the currants and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top during the last 5 minutes of baking. The texture was amazing and the caramel sauce is EXCELLENT! I doubled the recipe for the caramel so we could use it on ice cream.

Loved this recipe. The taste and texture was a cross between bread pudding and flan. Rich and cooey. Definately make it again.

Yipee - I'm one of the first to review this recipe. I substituted blueberries for currants. Made it twice and always with egg bread. It is ooh-la-la so good. After one forkful, everyone asked for the recipe.
