Way too much sugar. I would reduce the amount next time.

While this was a bit time consuming, it was absolutely delicious! I wouldn't hestitate to make it again - very creamy and rich. After a heavy Italian meal, it was the perfect ending.

I made this for Easter last year. It's a perfect dessert for a large complicated dinner because it can be done ahead. It seemed light (it isn't!) after a big dinner. Panna Cotta will be our standard fare for Easter dinner.
