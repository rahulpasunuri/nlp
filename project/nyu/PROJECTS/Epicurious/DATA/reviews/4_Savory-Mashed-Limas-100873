This is so much better than expected. We served it with grilled tuna steaks. It is similar consistency to mashed potatoes, so I'm thinking a yin/yang presentation in the serving bowl next time.

I bought some cheaper frozen lima beans that turned out to be rather tough when eaten whole. This recipe to the rescue! I didn't use milk; I just thinned them with some of the cooking water, and I forgot the nutmeg. I served it with chops and added the garlic cut in thin slices to the pan and cooked it until lightly browned on each side rather than cooking it separately. Swoon! Off to buy more limas...

I took this a step further and after I pureed it I put it in a casserole and topped it with thinly sliced Jarlsburg cheese and buttered breadcrumbs. Into a 450 oven til the top browns, about 10 mins. Out of this world!

I used a tbsp of curry powder instead of nutmeg. The result was a delicious side dish that fares well hot or cold (as a salad).

I'm not much of a lima bean fan, but I decided to try this recipe since it was different from the usual boiled and buttered lima beans I grew up with, and it was delicious. I've served it several times and it's been a hit, plus it's simple to prepare. Definitely worth trying out even if you don't think you like lima beans.
