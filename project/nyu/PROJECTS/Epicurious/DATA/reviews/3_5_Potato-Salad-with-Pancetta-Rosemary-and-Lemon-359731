I forgot to buy pancetta so I cooked up some bacon. Also i could not find fresh rosemary so i used thyme. Nonetheless this was bland. I ended up adding some sour cream since the dressing wasn't adding anything. It just felt like it was lacking something.

This turned out great after a bit of tweaking. I added a bit of brown sugar to the dressing, and more garlic. I cut the oil to 1/3 of a cup. Barely stayed in the fridge long enough to chill and it was gone.

This really was awful. Inedible in fact. So much olive oil.

The amount of rosemary in this salad overpowered the flavor of everything else, and I thought the dressing was too oily. You could probably tweak the recipe if you really like rosemary in your tater salad, but I won't be making this one again.

Easy recipe and tasty. Used bacon and added green onions to the salad. My husband loved it.

Packed the ingredients separately (in ice) for a camping trip. Was delicious with grilled Italian sausage, so much lighter than usual heavy potato salads.

It was definitely tasty and yes, the lemon IS the most prominent flavour. I'm not complaining though. MH said he would have liked it more warm - but maybe he`s just not used to eating cold potatoes. Will definitely try again on unsuspecting bbq goers!

This is a nice light potato salad recipe, the use of olive oil instead of mayo is a nice touch. I found the flavour of the pancetta was mostly lost somehow, which is unfortunate as it is so tasty. It seemed to get better the next day. Unlike a previous review I found you couldn't really taste the rosemary, in fact the lemon was by far the most powerful taste, I may reduce that next time and add in more pancetta.

made this for a weeknight dinner, my husband loved it, as did I. would be great with regular bacon! Made with Mayo instead of the olive oil. the lemon was light, refreshing. Rosemary was just a hint, not overpowering as some reviewers stated.

I almost never give 4 forks, but this recipe gets it for flavor and for being an interesting (and more healthy) alternative to standard potato salad. I made it as written (except added more garlic) and the flavors melded wonderfully. I could only let it sit for @ 30 minutes after putting it together. I bet it's even better if you let it sit for hours. My new favorite potato salad recipe.

Mostly boring. Rosemary was overpowering and it was quite dry. I used Yukon Gold and followed the recipe but found it bland and dry. I wouldn't make again.

This was excellent and dinner guests loved it! I did use small diced pancetta and steamed fava beans. Also added 1/3c light mayo and reduced olive oil to 1/3c. This seemed to mellow to flavors together better. Leftovers were awesome.

We made this for a 4th of July bbq. It was a big hit! Wonderful and light but very flavorful. I am making it again tonight.

I made this dish for a 4th of July BBQ also, preparing it a day ahead, it's a perfect accompaniment to any grilled meat and everyone really liked it. I undercooked the potatoes a bit, and used a little too much lemon because I had to cut the recipe by 1/3 and didn't quite measure right, so I would correct that next time. Also, I will add more bacon, use real parsley instead of dried, and add capers for a little more flavor.

Delicious! Be careful roasting the pancetta at 400 degrees - if it's thinly sliced, it will burn. I was tempted to add more salt, but don't - when the pancetta gets added, it'll be suffient. Served this at a July 4th dinner and my guests raved (including the one who "hates potato salad").

Not sure why recipes so often specify Yukon Gold potatoes. I find them much too mealy for salads---this recipe would have been way better with waxy red potatoes.

Made this a day ahead for our 4th of July BBQ and it was a lovely, light change from the typical mayo based potato salad. I did substitute a peppered bacon for the pancetta since that's what I had on hand. Also, added capers for a little more color and to pick up the flavor a bit. It was well received by our guests and a nice complement to our baby back ribs. We'll be doing this one again for sure.

The lemon rosemary flavor was delicious but I had issues with the pancetta. When I took the pancetta out of the oven, it was brown and unappetizing so I put it in a saute pan to crisp it up. Even then, when I added it wasn't great. Perhaps it doesn't travel well. Will try regular bacon next time.

Loved this salad.

Made this recipe the other day.. Did not have a really good quality olive oil on hand so used mayonnaise. I thought this was a lovely salad, and lots of flavour, I especially like the lemon flavour coming through. Next time I will add some capers and sun dried tomatoes..could use the lemon mayonnaise with dill and capers over a nice bbq salmon!!!

I love this recipe. However, I had to change it, being a vegetarian. I made it without the Pancetta. It was wonderful and a perfect salad for a hot summer day! The lemon makes it so refreshing!

Worth the money to buy the pancetta and don't change a thing. I served it with Lamb burgers for the 4th of July to rave reviews.

I took the advice from the reviews and added a few thinly sliced red onions and doubled the amount of (fresh) rosemary and parsley. I prepared the potatoes ahead and added the spices to it and placed them (sans dressing) in the fridge for a couple of hours- adding the oil and lemon salad dressing prior to serving. I would recommend adding one more slice of pancetta to 'up' the salty flavour a touch. Absolutely yummy, a hit with us and our foodie dinner friends!

I made this recipe last weekend to rave reviews, even from the picky eaters. I used bacon instead of pancetta and only half the olive oil, which was plenty. Next time I think I would use even more rosemary and lemon zest/juice, and maybe some thinly sliced red onion as well. Definitely a keeper!

I made this potato salad this past weekend for my family and we all thought it was wonderful. I do not like mayo at all, so I made it exactly as written. Even used pancetta for the first time ever...yummmmmm!! Absolutely would recommend this recipe and plan to make it for 4th July barbeque!!

I made this as the recipe called for. I thought it was really good. It was a light refreshing potato salad. We enjoyed it on the first day and next day too. Next time I will save a bit of the dressing and put on right before serving.

Made the recipe without any changes the first time. We thought this potato salad was a bit too lemony and ho-hum the first night but the next day after the flavors meshed it was much better! The next week I made it again but made it the night before I served it. The second time I also modified the recipe with 1/3 cup mayo and only 1/3 cup of olive oil. Additionally, we did buy the very expensive Italian pancetta the first time but truly thought a good American bacon (much cheaper) the second time was just as good. Version 2 was very well received and I will be making it again soon!

This salad is just OK. Much blander than one would expect from the ingredients.

Delish. Used 2 celery stalks and added a handful of fresh peas. Omitted the rosemary and used a little chopped fresh mint. The pancetta and lemon worked together beautifully.
