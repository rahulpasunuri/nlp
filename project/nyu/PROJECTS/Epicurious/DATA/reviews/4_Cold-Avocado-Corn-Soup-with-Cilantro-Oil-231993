This soup is incredibly delicious, and the cilantro oil sends it to another level!!

Wonderful! Adjustments: I added a roated Pablano instead of the serrano and did not add the raw onions. I served it around a mango salsa with crab meat and topped it w/ crispy tortilla strips.

This was an outstanding starter for a summer dinner party! However, I followed recommendations from other reviewers: increased corn from 1 to 3 ears, used 1-1/2 serrano chiles and did NOT sieve solids from final soup. I pureed the heck out of it with a stick blender, so it was extremely smooth--it had a lovely texture. Removing the solids is also very time consuming--skipping this step saves a lot of time. I roasted the corn on top of the stove in a grill pan--worked fine and may have been a little less charred this way. Chiles are not always labeled in supermarkets--and serrano chiles are green and a little longer than jalapenos. I do NOT recommend making this soup one day ahead--with the avocado, it will start to turn a little gray, even with tight plastic wrap on top. However, you can make it ahead up through the part where corn is cooked, cobs removed, and pureed with chiles and onions. Then refrigerate and pick up later with addition of avocados. I also found that the cilantro oil could be made the day before and refrigerated. It keeps much longer than 3 hours. I found that a double recipe served 10 people. If you strain out the solids, there will be less volume and may serve fewer people. I also recommend buying twice the number of avocados needed, so that you can cut out bad spots without running short. Finally, I found the crema/water mixture too thin--and added more crema so that it wasn't as soupy. If you cut the avocado up quickly while assembling, you don't need to put it in lime juice--I just chopped the avocado to speed up assembly and put it on top of crema and cilantro oil.

Loved this soup. For 8 people, I used 8 ears of corn, 4 cups water and 4 cups chicken stock. Like others, I also sauted the onion and garlic. I used 2 serrano chiles, 4 avocado and 6 tablespoons of lime juice. For the cilantro oil 3 cups of cilantro, 3/4cup olive oil and 2 tsp salt. I added diced grilled shrimp,cilantro, poblano, grilled onion and blue corn torilla chips. It was FABULOUS! A must make!

Delicious soup when corn and avocados are in season. I didn't strain my soup. I think if I were to have company, I would strain it for a silky rather than chunky texture. The cilantro oil was definitely my favorite part of the recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I was very interesting and fun to make. I've never infused my own oil before! Anyways, I served this at a dinner party and it was a really big hit. The spiciness of the dish doesn't hit you for a few seconds. It's a rather nice balance of cool and spicy, broken up by chunks of avocado. The presentation is beautiful.

This is a fantastic summer soup. I doubled the recipe, and it served 6, with a tiny bit leftover. I used 4 ears of corn and divided the water called for, using half chicken stock instead. I strained the corn puree and would definitely do so again -- the resulting smoothness is outstanding.

Made the soup. Added half an avocado extra before finishing purée. It was awesome. End of story.

I made this for a recent BBQ on a super hot day. It was great, very refreshing and I think had a good balance between the corn and the avocado. I used more corn that the recipe calls for though, and after eating it, I think it needs something else for the texture. Maybe some black beans or more roasted corn. I used tortilla chips as a topper but it kindof turns into a dip then... Everyone I served to liked it though so no complaints!!

Just made this today for my family. Quick, easy and delicious. Made it with frozen corn (from Trader Joes - the best) instead of on the cobb. In-laws loved it!

This soup did not impress me, at all. I found it bland even though I topped it with the cilantro oil and crema. Some people liked it, but I prefer my food to have some flavor. It was really pretty, though, particularly with the toppings. I really wish that the cilantro oil had been able to save this soup.

This is Cheryl again. I forgot one of the most important things. ROAST "THREE" EARS OF CORN!!!! not the one called for in the recipe. One ear simply won't give you that great corn flavor. I used three very large, fat ears so if they're not large, you can even roast FOUR! Good Luck!

This recipe was absolutely exquisite. I reduced the water to three cups, I roasted: 3 cloves of unpeeled garlic, 1 poblano, and one jalapeno (when blistered put in bag so skin will easily peel off and, WEAR GLOVES WHEN SEEDING AND PEELING!!! The jalapeno and poblano only had a hint of heat but do add an incredible flavor profile. I used only 3/4 of the avocado while pureeing the mixture. The avocado adds tremendous creaminess and richness eliminating the need for the Mexican crema or sour cream. I added 4-5 sprigs of cilantro while pureeing for taste as well as color. I was going to used blue corn tortilla chips for garnish but, it absolutely didn't need it. Some chopped cilantro leaves, diced avocado, a swirl of cilantro oil and a squeeze of lime juice were all this soup needed as garnishes. I wept with joy when I ate this soup. Please try it.

I thought this was excellent. I realized ahead of time--when I read reduce 4 cups water to 3--that the servings were going to be small. I followed the recipe exactly and after tasting I decided to add two more cobs of corn. I would say this recipe will serve 3-4 people. I think this recipe serves as a good base for tweaking. Next time maybe a bit of roasted poblano.

This is the first time I've ever rated a recipe as 1 fork, but this soup was just that much of a disappointment. We followed the recipe almost exactly (except for subbing cayenne powder for the chili and sour cream for the crema) and the flavor balance in our soup was all wrong. Too much lime, weird saltiness, no discernible corn taste, and so on. What a waste of delicious summer corn and avocados!

Rating: 1
The lack of flavor was not compensated by the cilantro oil, or by the sour cream we tried to add out of sheer desperation.

I loved this soup -- it has a refreshingly brisk coolness followed by a sneakily subtle hit of heat. I wanted more corn flavor, so used 2-3 ears, and I omitted the seeds from the chile to keep the heat pleasant and surprising. While I liked the soup with the avocado garnish, crema, and oil, I found that the dish tasted too much like guacamole with these additions, and I prefer the soup without them. I served this at a baby shower in small cups for sipping. I wasn't sure how soup would go over but everyone loved it (including the 1-year-old who kept asking for more) and several people asked for the recipe.

My changes: 3 small ears of corn instead of 1, half water/half chicken stock, 1 large jalapeño instead of serrano chile. Exquisitely delicious.

While this soup is refreshing, it's lack of flavor really bored me. The cilantro oil definitely help, especially with extra cilantro, jalapeno, and extra lime. I served this to about twelve people, and actually more people liked it than did not, but I wouldn't make it again.

Excellent and added to my favorites. Adjusted recipe slightly from reviews of others and my own needs. Used 3 fresh ears of corn roasted on BBQ, 2 cups water and 2 cups chicken broth, omitted seed from chile this time for guests, used lime juice only in soup not for avocado and sauted 6 large shimp with garlic to add with diced avocado at assemble. Did not strain the soup and it tasted delicious and loved the texture. Since I wanted extra for the next day I only added avocado to the amount used for this meal. Base keeps well and will blend avocado just before using again. Cilantro oil delicious.

I had to modify this recipe for my dinner party after tasting the strained corn stock on it's own. When I added the avocado, I also added some of the crema. This gave the soup a nice richness. Also, for texure I added the kernels from one grilled cob to the soup after puree. I garnished with blue corn tortilla chips in the center. My guests loved it.

A friend made this soup a few weeks ago as part of our dinner club dinner with the theme of "Quentin Tarantino". // We ended up having to alter/add as the initial puree of the corn "stock" would not have lived up to the "Serves 6" as the base part of the recipe. // We roasted 3 ears of corn, and pureed all of the corn and added about a pint of chicken stock. That worked for 6 perfect portions. We also had to add a lot more oil to make the cilantro oil. I agree with Iztb on 9/3/08 - dicing the avocado for garnish would be much easier than using a melon baller. // As for the flavor? Well, the flavors in this soup were incredible! You first got the cool "green taste" of the avocado with just a bit of the cilantro dancing around the avocado  very complementary flavors! But ooh, taste that? There's an underlying bit of heat from the serrano chile  not overwhelming by any means, but just the barest hint for you to say "Hey  there's a bit of spiciness in here!" But just as the avocado and heat were fading on your tongue, what came to the forefront? The roasted corn flavor  a smoky, fresh-from-the-grill goodness that was just the perfect ending to each mouthful of soup.

Absolutely beautiful. The swealtering summer heat here can kill the appetite for anything other than fruit and a cold cocktail, but not with a starter of this soup. It's so healthy, cool and perfectly delicious. The only change I made was to use powdered chilli so I could better gauge the heat intensity.

I made it without Crema but followed the rest of the directions to the T. It turned out too sour and a bit spicy. My husband said that he feels like he needs to dip chips into the soup.

I have made this twice for dinner parties -- in the south of France and in LA. The only change I made was to simply dice the avocado needed for garnish, not use a baller... It is quite worthwhile to strain both the soup and the oil. In LA I added Trader Joes (fabulous!!) corn salsa to the garnish. This has been a huge success both times... very tasty and very elegant when made to the recipe.

Outstanding soup but the hot pepper almost blew our heads off! agree with other reviewers not to worry about the sieve - it was terrific and the consistency excellent but the heat was just too much for my guests and i had to tone it down with yogurt. Next time a fraction of the serrano...but otherwise outstanding...

Well, I did take the easy path: no straining, no avocado balls, forgot the cilantro oil until we were halfway through the course and no cream of any kind. And still one of the best soups we're ever tasted! Luscious, creamy, tasty, satisfying. I can't imagine how much better it would be if I actually followed the recipe. I gave some to my neighbors (OK. It was a trade. My super soup for their homemade tortillas.) They liked it as a dip.

Amazing soup! Everyone had seconds, and it was even better the next day. Being as I never read all the way through recipes, I had to skip some of the time consuming steps; I roasted frozen corn kernels, didn't use a sieve, and served it warm. Fabulous!

Very good soup. I agree with other reviewers in that the recipe is overly complicated as is -- no need to strain and puree in so many different steps. I added another avocado, a little extra garlic and eased up on the lime juice and the soup came out very well. I'll definitely make it again and next time I'll double the recipe so we can have seconds.

I don't know what happened to me with this soup. Mine did not turn out good at all. I don't think it was a fault with the recipe rather an error in preparation somewhere along the line. Husband and sister had two spoonfuls out of politeness...too bad.

Delicious! I added an extra avocado and kernels from an extra ear of corn. I also grilled the corn on the bbq to avoid turning my oven on during a heat wave. I'm lactose intolerant and skipped the crema, but didn't miss it a bit. I agree with the reviewer who said the quality of the soup was largely dependent on the quality of the avocadoes. The next day, I added the shrimp and corn salad from this site as a garnish and it was amazing!

Rating: 3
I have made this soup twice - the first time was exceptional and the second time wasn't so great. The difference was the ripeness of the avocadoes. The soup is really dependent on good ones. Also, when I make it I add an extra ear of corn and reduce the seranos by half.

Rating: 4
I am not a fan of cold/chilled soups but I made this for a hot summer night dinner and this was truly exceptional and unique. I followed the recipe for the soup but served cilantro as a pesto instead of oil. Be sure to double the recipe if you are serving 6 people. This is a keeper.

This was so delicious! It made such a lovely presentation and the taste rivaled the best chilled soups that I fondly remember eating in Paris.

So good! I had to use a canned chile and it was fine. Like other reviewers, next time I might not strain it, and use fat-free Fage Greek yogurt - not because there was anything wrong with the recipe, just for something less delicate, lighter.

Outstanding! This soup made me look like a culinary genius. The velvety texture and subtle flavor were soooo good. Those who have spice issues may want to remove the seeds from the serrano. It was quite hot, and I'm not at all a spice wimp. I can't wait to show off and make it again. I think saying this serves six servings is questionable. For me it was more like three servings and we all wanted more! Bravo.

This soup might convert those who don't like cold soups! The directions seemed as if it might be a pain to make, but it really wasn't. Next time I will add a bit less lime juice - and maybe a little more corn, but husband thought it was nearly perfect.

I'll second what all the others have said about the astonishing complexity of this soup. Also that it doesn't effectively serve more than four people! I think it's probably also idiot-proof. I couldn't find serranos and I blanked on what was comparable (hint: it's jalapenos), and I ended up getting habaneros, the hottest pepper there is. Oops. I worried that it would make the soup inedible, but I just threw it in with the stock instead of pureeing it with the avocado, and there was still a spicy afternote but it wasn't a dealbreaker. I followed the others' advice and both doubled the garlic and sauteed the onion, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was a HUGE success.

I doubled the recipe and served it to 10 guests with rave reviews. I sliced the avocado instead of balling it which also worked nicely as garnish. Will definately make this again!

Fabulously delicious. You must taste and adjust salt and pepper seasoning after it is cold (serving temp). It makes a difference. I added a little sugar (1 tsp) to enhance the sweetness of the corn, and cut the lime juice in half; prefer the sweet and creamy taste with the kick of the peppers. As others, didn't bother with straining anything--texture is nice. I cooked half the onion (used Vidalia for sweetness) and left half raw. Left some corn kernels unpureed for texture. Cilantro oil and sourcream are a must. Tortilla chips add nice side garnish for crunch. I will make this again and again.

My family and I really enjoyed this soup. I changed the recipe a bit...I used a package of freeze packed fresh avocado; instead of the cilantro oil I blended mexican crema with cilantro and taragon and some fresh jalapeno, which I added as a garnish to each soup bowl. I also cooked all of the onion, as I'm not a big fan of uncooked onion, and I did not strain the corn, which added some texture. The soup was complex and delightfully cool on a warm evening.

A complete home run. Actually had folks lick the bowl - then ask for seconds. Good 'bang' from the peppers (I did a little extra) - but the overall presentation is top notch. I dropped the cream in the center - used it as a bowl for the cilantro oil. A big mess to make - but worth every effort.

Delicious! Agreed that it does not make 6, but it does make 4 small bowls (which is just fine since it's a little rich!). It's a wonderful alternative to chilled cucumber soup!

Quantity was good for 2 NOT 6. A lot of unnecessary steps - to improve texture, I'd not strain. Alternatively, serve with homemade tortilla slices for some texture. Also, the cilantro oil is prettier as a cilantro pesto (ie. cilantro minced, not pureed then strained.

Rating: 3
Great soup, even for those not wild about avocado, but definitely NOT for six. Agree with previous reviewer that straining not necessary. Had doubled the garlic, used our own fresh asian cilantro from garden and didn't need to add extra salt. Cilantro oil will be great for basting grilled fish or chicken. Planning to increase roasted corn and double or triple recipe next batch and will make soon as it was such a hit!

If you are tired of the old cucumber cold soup standard, this is an outstanding soup for a hot summer evening! I agree with a reviewer who said this is not six servings unless you're serving in demi-tasse cups or the like. Also, I think most palates would appreciate just a wee bit more salt.

Wonderful texture and flavor! The serrano gave just the right bite and the corn and avocado lend the soup a richness that belies the absence of dairy. A great recipe for picky vegans (if you leave out the crema, of course).

A bit messy, but the chilling time allows you the opportunity to clean up the kitchen. It really tastes great, fresh, and is wonderfully healthy. For those who are impatient, It was so good when I tasted it before chilling, than I can safely say you can speed up the process. Just forgo a lot of the chilling, and have a delightful lukewarm/hot soup instead.

Very tasty and rich; everybody thought it had a cream base! Don't forget to season the cooled soup before assembling like I did--it needs it. The repeated blending and straining of everything makes this recipe quite a bit of work, but it really was delicious! Not a drop was left.

Yum! I love avocado and this is a great way to consume it in liquid form. Straining the corn mixture was a bit time-consuming, though. I used nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream which worked fine.

This was an excellent dish. I have had avocado soup that has been very bland but this was full of flavor. I followed the recipe and noted the pounds on the avocado which ended up requiring three vs two. Maybe the "extra" avocado is why but I had plenty to serve three very generous portions. Yummy!

I was a little iffy at the fact that only one person rated this recipe, but let me tell you this is definately worth it. The soup did not yield what I felt was six servings, seeing as how I made this for my fiance and myself and I barely got two bowl-fulls out of it. I used jalapeno instead of serano because the market was out. I also felt it needed S&P so I added some before chilling. For someone who doesn't do the 'cold soup thing' I really loved it.

I made this for tonights dinner - haven't even had it yet but it tastes GREAT! I used leftover roasted corn from last summer (from the freezer) so it was super easy. Will definitely make it again.
