Good recipe for use of leftover corned beef. Definitely needed some jazzing up though. I used white wine instead of milk, added a generous amount of minced garlic and a fair amount of salt and pepper.

This is remarkabley good, the delicate flavors of the cabbage and potato blend nicely with the corned beef. They are exellent re-heated after the flavors have had a chance to blend and make awesome lunch leftovers.

Basically mashed potato in a potato skin but I used frozen rapini instead of cabbage. Lot less effort.
