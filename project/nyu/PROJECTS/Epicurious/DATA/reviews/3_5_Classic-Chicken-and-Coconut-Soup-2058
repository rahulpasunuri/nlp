This is a great base recipe that accomodates (and needs) lots of tinkering. I loved not having to saute anything. I just threw in some chicken breasts (boneless/skinless), carrots, mushrooms, etc. After reading the other reviews I added extra lime juice, fish sauce, chili paste, galanga (which is ginger of some kind--the guy at the asian food store insisted I buy it when I told him what I was making), lots more cilantro. I hadn't even know what lemongrass looked like! Next time I will cook it longer, as the consistency was too thin. I might add basil as well? But this recipe demystifies thai cooking. Finally I can have this soup w/out going to a restaurant!

Used 2 tablespoons lime juice. Substituted 1 1/2 teaspoons green curry paste for the jalapeno pepper. Added 1 clove garlic, minced, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, 1 can straw mushrooms, and 1 tomato, diced. Kids said it was just like what they have in the restaurants.

A very great soup! One little addition I used was to add a bit of cardamom, coriander, turmeric, and green onion to the broth. It added a great indian flair to it, as if the coconut didn't. Great. my fiancee and mother loved it.... That's a tough feat to accomplish. ;)

This was delicious, but like many others requires tinkering -- but it's also very easy to tinker with. I used boneless breasts, cut them up, sauted them in soup pot until brown and then added chicken stock, coconut milk, a little water, and minced jalapeno. I also added lime rind, bamboo shoots, thai hot sauce, and fish sauce (the last is pretty crucial). Also throw the cilantro in by the handful (don't just use it as a garnish). Oh, and I also double the recipe.

Sorry, but this doesn't come close to the Tom Kha Gai made in the best Thai restaurants. Lack of galanga, no kaffir lime leaves, no fish sauce. I made this recipe and found the flavor to be quite bland. On the other hand, my guests insisted that they liked it, but I think they were just being kind.

This was absolutely great! The Thai resturaunt where I eat uses a hot chili oil instead of peppers, so I added that instead of jalapenos. I just drizzled a little on top. One change that I made was to add a little fish sauce, available at Asian markets, to my bowl. Be careful it is VERY salty but the right amount pushed this soup right over the TOP! I have been looking for a good coconut recipe for 2 years. I finally found one!

We eat out at Thai restaurants a lot, and we always order this. This recipe is just as good if not better than a lot we have tasted. The lime is the key ingredient that gives it that extra kick. My husband loved it, and he's picky!

This was better than the soups I have at my favorite Thai restaurant. I did have some modifications to the recipe, though: I used 2 tbsp of lime juice instead of 1, added about 1/2 cup of straw mushrooms, and used 1/2 tsp of some Thai curry paste. Mmmmm.... Sublime...

I took Rimmy and Tom's advice but also added some fresh minced ginger to the lemongrass broth. I strained as the recipe directed and then added shitake mushrooms and some seeded, halved cherry tomatoes. This soup is better than what you will find in a restaurant! This is a winner.

This is a very easy to prepare recipe that can offer delicious results with a few changes. I skinned the chicken breast to avoid too much fat in the broth. To futher cut down on the fat content of the soup, I used light coconut milk instead of the full fat variety. Also, borrowing from other Thai curry recipes, I added two tablespoons of brown sugar to the broth as it simmered with the chicken. The end result was just delicious!

Easy to make and not that time-consuming. We loved it! The fresh lime juice is essential to achieving the desired flavor.

I have prepared this recipe several times and find it can be improved from a "3" to a "4." Use 1 medium boned skinless chicken breast filet (the fat left behind by one with with bones and skin ruins the soup). I mince the lemongrass into very small pieces and leave it in the soup. Use 1 to 2 serrano chili peppers and 1 jalapeno chili pepper sliced crosswise into thin circles instead of 1/2 jalapeno minced (the circles are easily avoided by those who don't care for them). The critical ingredient to this soup is the fresh lime juice: without the lime, the soup's flavors will not emerge; too much lime will be overpowering. Don't be afraid to experiment; this is a very delicious soup! In the past I have added three to four drops of, "Mongolian Fire Oil," made by, "House of Tsang." Occasionally, I have prepared this soup with left over ham ... "Yummy!" Bon Appetit!
