So my co-worker brought me some authentic mole from mexico. My boyfriend and I thought it was nothing special. Good but not amazing. We decided to try this mole recipe. I couldn't find the mulato peppers so I used guajillo instead. And after all that work...it tasted exactly like the one my co-worker gave me! So I guess it's authentic but compared to mole that I've had in good mexican restaurants it was kinda bland. Don't get me wrong--we ate it all. But I won't attempt this again.

Excellent. Based on a Dianne Kennedy recipe. Takes time, but you will have enough to freeze. Make certain you toast the various seeds separately from one another: otherwise, you lose the complexity and may get a bitter taste.

I cannot give even one fork to this recipe. I don't mind labor intensive when the result shows it. This was, in my opinion, inedible. And to add insult to injury, it made a ton! Bitter is an understatement. If frying the chiles was the cause, this should NEVER have been put in the recipe. Starting with dark dried chiles, even counting to 15 sec., I'll never know if the chiles were burned, although I suspect this ruined the sauce. Even the tomatillo mixture tasted awful.

Pretty good for the first time. Perfect mole making day. Followed the recipe, expect...added twice as much chocolate and about 2 tablespoons of sugar. Very deep flavors and nothing like the Dona Maria on which I grew up with and loved. Be sure and clean as you go.

Half way through this recipe, I was ready to kill myself. It's a lot of work, but worth it. I'm planning on doing it for my father's memorial in Mexico. The flavors blend and last in your mouth for hours. I will cut down on the cloves though. Sugar was fine, it's Poblano. I crossed this off of my bucket list. Next is skydiving naked which should be a breeze. Jeff

Holy Mole!! The raisins in this recipe help keep the bitterness away without having to add sugar. I plumped them up in some goose fat along with the garlic and chopped shallots, before blending in a food processor with the rehydrated chiles. Added a third of a jar of Trader Joe's salsa verde in lieu of tomatillos, some cinnamon, cocoa powder and broth. Stirred in the toasted pulverized pepitas. Cooked chicken cutlets stovetop directly in the sauce in a heavy dutch oven. No need to parboil and plenty of sauce left over. Served on a bed of cilantro with melted smoked farmers' market cheddar on top - dinner for 1 in under an hour. A classic epicurious bastardization if ever their was one - and definitely worth repeating!

I decided to go for it and make this from scratch, as the recipe is written. It took 3 hours before the final 45-minute cooking at the end, so 3 hours of pretty intensive cooking for one person (cleaning up as I went.) This was freaking amazing. So worth it for a special occasion or a day when you really want to cook. When I say I followed the recipe, I mean to the letter, including the exact type of chiles in their exact amounts, going through all of the pain in the butt steps of toasting the spices individually, etc. I roasted the garlic before adding it. (Twice, because I burned the first batch.) And I poached the chicken. I lied, I did do a few different things. I used a whole chicken, added some onion, carrot, celery and garlic to the poaching water. At the end, I decided to make a layered dish with some corn tortillas, the chicken, a little red onion and cilantro sprinled on the layers, as well as jack cheese. Baked in the oven for about a half hour. I wanted enmoladas but did not have the energy.... The recipe says it serves 8. I had a ton of sauce leftover, and leftover chicken broth because I used a lot of water to poach. I used enough sauce in my preparation for four, and could have probably served at least 8 more people. So this recipe serves way more than 8, in my opinion. It was worth the effort. If it had been just okay, I'd never make it again given the labor, but it was wonderful. I was proud of it.

Follow the recipe, collect the ingredients, and follow the instructions. The result is a deep complex sauce that changes with every taste, that satisfies on such a primitive level. It is amazing.

this is a great recipe. i loved it! however, the statement that tomatillos are members of the gooseberry family is not true. the tomatillo, along with tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, tobacco and others is a member of a plant family called the Solenaceae. on the other hand gooseberries belong to a plant family called the Grossulariaceae which contains only currants and gooseberries.

Well, this is definitely labor intensive and I agree that the quality of the ingredients matter tremendously. I made this for the first time for Christmas dinner this year and it turned out great. A lot of work but also tons of compliments. I made it a day ahead and then reheated it very slowly over low heat for most of the day Christmas day. The taste improved dramatically the longer I let it simmer.

I love it. I went to a Mexican market got the best ingredients and it worked out fine. I want to talk about a way to neutralize bitterness in a sauce. If you add sugar, you have a sweet/bitter sauce. Try this add very finely grated carrot. It is magic and it will get rid of bitterness in any sauce and if you cook it. The carrot will dissolve and no one will know.

This can be made with the Rogelio Bueno much easier, and then adding the chiles and using mexican chocolate, toast, peanuts, or your choice of nut. Best with broth of chicken after boiled, not much flavor unless the chicken is bone-in. If using boneless substitute some chicken flavoring, use the cubes to flavor to taste. Never needed peppercorn.

This is an excellent recipe and well worth the time. To all of those who would open a jar because it's so much easier or think it's too time consuming-- you're missing the point of cooking. As most authentic ethnic recipes, this is NOT a weeknight recipe; this is something usually prepared for special occasions--wedding; parties, etc. In comparison -- you can open a jar of pasta sauce, use no-cook noodles, throw it together with some cheese, and make lasagna OR you can make the sauce by roasting, chopping, simmering for hours and rolling out home made pasta--as in the old days. Most of us make lasagna somewhere in between. Mole has always been considered a "high end" food. A suggestion to the person who thought it was bitter -- toasting the chiles has to be done very carefully or else they will taste bitter. An easier alternative is to just hydrate the chiles: clean the chiles, put them in a glass bowl, add boiling water, and let them sit for 20 minutes to hydrate. They will become soft and will be blended easily. Also, season well--for some reason chiles absord salt. And if still too bitter, add a little bit of sugar. The sauce is best done a day or two before for the flavors to properly meld.

ok people I am going to give you my secret mole negro recipe... The brand is rogelio bueno and it is in a glass jar with a yellow label and it says mole negro...first if you buy the small jar the way to remove the lid is with a bottle opener to opposite ends then the top pops off....if you use the can opener the glass might shatter .... to serve eight you would use 2 small jars or 1 big jar. the big jar top just twists off...in a 5 quart dutch oven you put the mole which is the consistency of greasy bakers chocolate..you dissolve it with 2cups of chicken broth you saved from the boiled chicken..and you stir and dissolve you keep adding broth and stir until the sauce is the consistency of a thick gravy, then you add a tblsp of granulated sugar and mix all this in med heat then you add the large pieces of chicken you boiled coarsely shredded, don't use the roasted chicken from the store it changes the taste...let it simmer for 20 minutes serve with chicken flavered rice and refried beans and tortillas I have been making this for over 20 years with that brand and it has been a hit in family reunions everytime. It is spicy with a hint of sweet with no bitterness you will not need to add any spices or salt or pepper....By the way I am mexican and most of the time will cook authentic sauces and dishes . this is my ancient mexican secret..shhh

I agree about the labor intensive comment from the other reader. I made this recipe from peppers that were not very good and got bad results. I then went to my local Mexican grocery and got the right ingredients the clerk was really helpful, (at about 1/2 the cost) and the mole was really good. My suggestion is to make sure you use good quality ingredients.

This receipe was labor intensive, to say the least, and the outcome so, so. I'm not sure what went wrong. The sauce had a unpleasant, bitter taste. I would try to make this again if I knew how to avoid the bitterness. Anyone have any ideas?
