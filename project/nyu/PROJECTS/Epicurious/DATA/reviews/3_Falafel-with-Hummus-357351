When I first read this issue, I couldn't get over what a stupid recipe this was, and I came across it again just now while looking for a quick falafel recipe. #1- who dredges falafel in flour before frying? It's not chicken for crying out loud. #2- I cannot understand that a "Falafel and Hummus" recipe doesn't give instructions on how to make hummus! Recommending store bought hummus? Really? The ingredients are basically THE SAME, and after you scoop the falafel mixture out of the food processor, you don't even have to clean it! Just throw in some more chickpeas, tahini, parsley, garlic, cumin, and salt & pepper to taste, add some lemon juice and mix it all up- it's so easy. With an extra minute of work you can have much tastier, cheaper hummus. Store bought? Seriously, Bon Appetit... just because your sister magazine Gourmet isn't around anymore to show you up doesn't mean you should get sloppy.

Made it a few times...frankly a little bland and dry.

I agree with Plynch. Since chickpeas are what make up falafel, hummus sould be overkill. Yogurt, tahina, lettuce, tomato - some diced cucumber - is perfect.

Very easy, as other reviewers have said. I also used garlic and red pepper flakes. Don't make the balls too flat or they will crumble. It was delicious in a pita with hummus, tomato, and lettuce!

the recipe was quite easy to make, so I will probably prepare it again soon and work on a few alterations (not sure what yet). I made the recipe as written and found the flavor to be a bit lacking. I am not sure what it was missing, but something.

Great, easy falafel. I used fresh garlic, red peper flakes and a little oregano instead of garlic pepper spice blend (don't know what that is) and these came out delicious! They were easy to make and didn't fall apart in the pan.

We have made this recipe four or five times. It is one of my new favorites. The first time we made it, the falafel fell apart during the frying process because the oil was not hot enough when we dropped the patties in. We got the oil up to temperature the next time and didn't have the problem.

Like another reviewer, I also would have given this recipe 0 forks if I had the opportunity. This recipe seemed good in theory, but was awful in application. The falafels completely fell apart in my fry pan and I ended up with a literal big hot mess. I followed the recipe to the letter. Maybe baking them would be more practical (and healthy!)

My husband and I really enjoyed this but felt the frying took out all the nutritional value. The taste was excellent. We are going to make it again but in the waffle iron as suggested by a previous reviewer. Really affordable to make and very easy.

I would have given 0 forks if possible. These did not turn out at all for me. Not sure what I did wrong, but they were nasty.

I substituted 1/4 of the garbanzo beans for edamames and instead of frying, I used the waffle iron!!! It was perfect!!!

This is a great easy recipe. I've never made falafel before but I will be sure to make it again!

Tahini sauce is better with this than humus. Serve in pita bread, drizzle w/tahini sauce
