This is not the best ice cream recipe, because it uses a custard the taste is not as good as it could be. The custard itself doesn't taste that good possibly because of the use of the dry milk. The edamame tastes wasn't nearly as strong as i was expecting it to be, the taste of the custard overpowered it. If you want to make an edamame ice I suggest you use a different recipe.
