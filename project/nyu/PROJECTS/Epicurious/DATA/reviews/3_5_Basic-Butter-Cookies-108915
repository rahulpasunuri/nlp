I was looking for a quick cookie recipe for a bake sale and made these. I rolled them in colored sugar (green for St. Patrick's Day), and baked right away w/out chilling. I think they're wonderful! I added a full tsp. of vanilla but wouldn't change a thing. No problem with texture or taste- a wonderful little cookie, and the colored sugar makes them look like little jewels.

I had to write this after discussing the difference between this recipe and the Christmas Cutouts recipe also on epicurious. I always use the latter recipe and by accident used this one instead for my last batch. I have to tell you this one pales in comparison. It must be the ratios and the added sour cream. If you are looking try another cut out cookie recipe, I recommend Christmas Cutouts with Vanilla Icing.

When this recipe was first printed in gourmet in 2003 it gave you 5 different cookies that can be made from the basic dough. All of the recipes are fabulous. I don't even refrigerate the dough, I use a # 20 scoop, push down on dough slightly and bake. My customers love them.

PS I used KerryGold Irish butter. Of course, using delicious, flavorful butter makes a difference!

This is the best Christmas cut-out cookie recipe I've found yet: tastes like a butter cookie, rather than floury or just plain sweet. We baked for only 10 minutes - remove from oven just when beginning to color at edge. We sugared before baking; very easy, very good!

Not a Baker and this is an easy & simple recipe. Used wax paper to form dough instead of plastic. Definitely will make it again but thicker slice for chewier inside.

Just made these today and they are very good. I used the roll into a ball/rollin sugar method and the dough was fine. The only thing was that I baked for about 12 minutes and the cookies on the second sheet that were in a little longer started to burn. So beware. I see that other recipies bake at 350 and I might try next time. But overall a very good cookie and very easy.

Overall a good recipe but I ran into the same problem as others - dough being too crumbly or not soft enough. The cookies didnt flatten out as well but tasted great. It is great recipe to add other flavours into. I put some dried lavender and it tastes great. Next time though, I might add more butter and just bake them instead of chilling and baking.

Added 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice and put the log of dough in the freezer for 45 minutes. My slices were 1/4-1/2 inch thick and baked for about 14 minutes. Decorated with sprinkles. Good cookies, but not amazing. Thought there was too much baking powder flavor. Maybe I'll try it again exactly as according to recipe next time?

This is a great recipe. Easy to make, and my parents both LOVED it. Sprinkle some powdered sugar over it and mmm mmm goooood. :)

These cookies turned out delicious! after a day they turned a little hard so if you like a chewier cookie, undercooking them will work. When putting the dough on cookie sheets, careful not to let the dough get warm or it will get crumbly and hard to manage. Putting the warm dough in the fridge for 10-20 mins helps with this problem. Overall, a great recipe I will use many times!

I've been making these sugar cookies since the recipe appeared in the magazine. I think they're delicious and go great with lemon curd.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe and added the juice of one lemon (as posted by previous reviewers). This messed up the texture of the dough and caused it to have a gross aftertaste... The recipe itself is good, but my advice is to use half a large lemon, or one small lemon.

To MCMB from Maryland: if I understand your review correctly, it stated you rolled out the dough and it crumbled. These cookies are to be rolled into a log (by hand), chilled and then cut in slices...perhaps that was the problem with the cookie.

Yummy. Only I sabotaged myself by making it while the rest of the family was on holiday. A nice basic cookie to work with, whether you're looking to experiment with adding a new flavor or just want a basic yummy cookie everyone will (or should!) like.

I experimented with the amount of butter and found that 1 cup is seems to make the cookies chewier. I also added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 teaspoons for more vanilla flavor. I plan on using these cookies for the Petite Lemon Curd Cookies next time I make them. Mmmm... lemon curd.

This recipe was very disappointing. The cookies tasted like butter (which I expected), but they were completely hard. For the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th batch I kept an eagle eye on the timer and soon the time was cut down in half, but I was still getting hard cookies. Side note: My oven is a gas oven. I am still in search of a delicious butter cookie that isn't hard.

I read all 62 reviews before making these cookies, and found this recipe disapointing. I made 6 batches of the dough (separately) because I wanted to make a lot of cookies and also figuring that each batch might come out slightly different and I could see whether the poor reviews here were valid. As for taste, these cookies were great and friends who tried loved them. However, I ran into the same problem of the dough crumbling/cracking instantly when rolling them out. (I chilled the dough for the full time, measured flour exactly etc.) Basically, even aside from the cracking you have about a 45 second window between the dough being too cold or too soft to handle. I will now look for other recipes with a more versatile dough until someone posts helpful tips on how to improve this one. Two other notes: I did not use ultra creamy butter; also, if you go so far as to name a better recipe, please use the exact name in the epicurious database -- I couldn't find, with certainty, the recipes that one or two other people recommended over this one.

I've made these twice. The first time I made slightly thicker cookies, and the second time thinner ones. They looked delicious both times, but tended to have a slightly floury flavour. I will probably experiment some more with this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly (with lemon juice and zest from another recipe) and these turned out delicious! I rolled the balls in chopped hazelnuts and drizzled with chocolate. I did have to bake them for about 4 minutes longer than the recipe said though.

Will keep this recipe and make often.This is a great sugar cookie plain, and easy to dress up. I split the batch in half and made drop and refrigerator cookies. I thought thought the chilled log was much better than the drop method.

I made these today...mmmm. I made two lots. One log as reccomended with chocolate, and the other I dusted with sugar. My BF said "very chrismassy!". Xmas in July....why not?!! One thing however, my lot came out a little hard, probably due to overcooking, so be sure to keep your eye on them...they dont take long!

These are a great base. I made a 1/3 recipe, being careful to measure exactly 1/3 of a beaten egg. I chilled them, rolled out, and made tiny cutout cookies. I dredged some in conf. sugar, some in unsweetened cocoa powder while still warm. I think they are very buttery and a great crispy texture, as well as simple, so I'll definitely be using this as a base for more experimentation.

Wow, these cookies are awesome. Made the coconut version, and I can't believe I'm saying this, given my chocoholism and the lack of that ingredient in this recipe, but these might be the best cookies I've ever eaten. Followed recipe, using regular unsalted--nothing fancy. Rolled into balls and baked right away. Just tried them, and they're crisp outside, chewy inside, buttery-- truly fabulous!

I made these biscuits (oops, cookies) as small gifts for members of a community theatre group. They all loved them and begged for more. I watched them carefully when they were in the oven as they quickly turn from underdone to perfect to burnt.

Wow, after reading these reviews, I'm abashed at the comments of the one and two forkers! Christmas '06 is around the corner and my family and friends love these cookies so much, it will be my 4th year like a shackled prisoner in the kitchen whipping tons of these up--all variations, doing them just as the recipe says, using land o' lakes unsalted. I don't refrigerate - I just roll the batter into balls right away, put them in the oven and away we go! Could that be why they don't get crumbly, etc.? Heck if I know, but I'm doomed around the holidays forever as a victim of my own (and Gourmet's) success!

I made these and 3 variations: Coconut Cookies, Chocolate Cookies & lemon Cookies. I have been giveing out the recipe since.

This uses too much flour vs butter. My mother in law has a homemade recipe that is much better. Tried making this and the cookies just comes out crumbly and the dough is unable to stick together.

Super-easy to make and quite foolproof if you follow all directions (including chilling the dough). Cookies came out too sweet though - next time I will halve the sugar. I made a nutty version by adding ground mixed nuts (cashews, hazelnuts and almonds) and almond essence, which came out wonderful.

I can't wait to start whipping these up for this Holiday Season! I like to do the log version, freeze the dough for several days and just slice and cook. Great for drop-by guests! Also, added a teensy smidge of butter flavoring, just to enhance the buttery goodness.

This recipe, along with all of the variations that were published with it, has become the heart and soul my holiday cookie baking activity. These cookies are perfect: crisp and tasty without being too sweet. If you haven't seen the other recipes that utilize this cookie dough, check out the following: Almond Spice Cookies, Caramel Pecan Cookies, Chocolate Cookies, Coconut Cookies, Holiday Cutouts, Lemon Cookies, and Pine Nut Tassies (all published in Gournet 2003). I actually can't wait for December so I can make them all again!

Easy to follow. When the log gets soft, it is suggested to put it back to the fridge to chill. The cookies are crisp! It looks great both in colored sugar and plain; it makes you feel that it's Christmas in July...

This was a great basic dough; I added peppermint to the plain dough and made up a batch of the chocolate dough, after chilling for about 10 min. I rolled each out, placed one on top of the other and rolled up jelly-roll style, then chilled, sliced and baked. They made a perfect, elegant cookie with a grownup taste.

I'm really perplexed about why so many people liked these. I used premium European butter, made the lemon variation, and...ho hum. The dough was very soft and stuck to everything, including my nonstick rolling-out mat. And they tasted quite sweet; more like a sugar cookie, not enough butter flavor. And my circa 1957 Betty Crocker cookbook has better sugar cookie recipes. Disappointing.

I made this for my Christmas cookies, making 5 variations to the basic dough. All were good, tender and attactive when fresh. But this cookie has a very short life - after 3 days the shortbread quality had deteriorated. I will use this again but much smaller quantities - not 12 dozen!

Splurge and use the Plugra. I made roll outs and used royal icing to decorate. They rolled out like a dream and tasted heavenly. My two guys (gluttons) requested them for all holidays. If you only bake one type of cookie for Xmas, use this recipe.

These were everything butter cookies should be: easy, delicious and extremely versatile. I tried several versions, such as lemon, drizzled with chocolate, and I created two of my own recipes, one using 1/2 cup of finely chopped pecans & 1/2 cup finely chopped marashino cherries (the ones that don't come in liquid), the other sprinkling a mixture of cinnamon & sugar. The 4 recipes combined yielded over 16 dozen cookies, which was great to give out as Xmas gifts (I used several fun-shaped cookie cutters). Baking time was adapted to my stove, and was definitely less than indicated, because I like cookies that are more chewy. I recommend making these with a friend, while enjoying a nice flute of champagne! Cheers!

This recipe is excellent! A definite keeper! One of the best I've come across in quite a while. However, if I were not going to decorate the cookies with icing/etc. then I wouldn't use it.

Nothing special. The batter was tasty, but in the end they came out kind of hard. I did have VERY good success in an adaptation though - I dipped each slice in a dish of mini choc. chips, then topped with coconut. THAT was good.

This is a delicious butter cookie! I used the Plugrá for several batches and then Trader Joe's unsalted for a several more. The Plugrá really made a difference in the cookies that used the dough "straight" (i.e. pine nut tassies and the cut outs). The buttery flavor was out of this world! For the chocolate and the spice cookies--I couldn't taste a difference between the two butters--both were equally good.

I must say that I was a little underwhelmed with this recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter and used Plugra (a superior product indeed) and the cookies lacked sweetness and buttery richness. I imagine an increase in the amount of butter and sugar might remedy this, but as is, I wouldn't use this recipe again.

These cookies were an ease to make and adapting them to other flavors is so simple it is amazing. I made the plain butter and baked with a walnut in the middle of each, put fresh lemon and zest in a batch for yummy lemon cookies, and cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and walnuts in another batch for some spice cookies. All in all I made 16 dozen cookies in about 3 hours. This recipe is a keeper!
