Easy to make. Great with fresh peaches. Used 1/2 t. of the cinnamon and omitted the maple syrup. Wonderful!!

I just made the compote and served it on my favorite waffle recipe. Too much cinnamon as written. I would use about half a teaspoon. But I would definitely make it again with that one tweak. Excellent with whipped cream for a special treat morning.

Instead of bread I used slightly stale croissants, and replaced the milk with eggnog. Delicious!!

I made this again with fresh nectarines. Served the leftover compote on hot oatmeal next morning, and it was wonderful.

The compote is easily made with fresh peaches, and a good use for less than perfect ones. Much as I love maple syrup, I found the additional sweetness unnecessary.

Nice flavor...not too sweet. Our grocery store did not have frozen peaches, so I used Dole peaches which come in a plastic jar (discarded the syrup) and can be found in the produce aisle. I didn't need to place the french toast in the oven...we ate the first batch while the second cooked on the griddle. The compote took a while to thicken, about 20 minutes. Looking forward to making this again!

This made a wonderful breakfast in bed for Valentine's Day, and easy enough that I'll make it for the kids too. I dusted the french toast with powdered sugar and served the compote on the side. It easily compared to a 5 star restaraunt entree. Yummy!

Excellent flavor! I used fresh peaches and added a splash of brandy - served it over both waffles and french toast.

I thought the warm peach compote was just OK. I thought pure maple syrup tasted better with the french toast. Maybe it would have worked better if I didn't use frozen peaches?

Extremely easy to prepare (we used frozen peaches), with fantastic flavor and a beautiful presentation. You can use whatever version of French Toast that you prefer, or waffles. You can even serve up this compote on ice cream. I'll make this again.

modified this somewhat to use the fresh mangoes in the pantry and it was extraordinary. quartered the sugar, added some ginger and wanted to roll around in the compote it was so good.

My husband made this for me on Mother's day. It was fantastic, out of this world wonderful. He used Peppridge Farms (sp?) french toast bread extra thick, and that was the only change. But the peach compote was just too good!

Made this with fresh peaches, and cut recipe approx. in half. Was fantastic. A definite "do again" at our house.

This is the best french toast I've ever made. I've already made it 4 times. You'll love it too!

Very good indeed. You can leave the compote on the stove for longer than fifteen minutes - it will just get richer and more flavourful. Soaking the bread in the egg mixture also yields good results. Just merely dipping the bread leaves the middle of the toast dry when done.
