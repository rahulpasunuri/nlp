This was excellent. Defintely perfect for a cold winter day but it does make a lot. I halved the recipe for the 2 of us and still have enough leftover to freeze for another dinner. I used cremini because the store was out of shiitake and it worked fine. I also used Emmenthal as well as the Fontina and used blue Bressy instead of gorgonzola because the flavor is less overwhelming.

A bit long to make, but nice on a rainy day and worth every minute spent in the kitchen. I did not use the gorgonzola due to familial preference, but I am sure it brings the dish to a slightly higher level. I used one cup of the tomato juice in addition to the tomatoes and the result was perfect.

Delicious! We added a handful of sliced Kalamata OLIVES, as suggested, and it gave it a nice zing! To improve the color, and give it a fresher taste, I added FRESH BASIL and fresh sliced CHERRY TOMATOES (1 bag-replaced some of the canned ones). I replaced 2/3 of parmesan with PARMESAN REGGIANO, which was great! Most importantly I HALVED THE GORGONZOLA! I think it would have overpowered the dish for me, as I am not a fan of that flavor. If you are not a fan, put in a forth of the ammount, or replace with another cheese of choice.

This is a staple in our winter kitchen. We call it Snowstorm Pasta, which speaks for itself. I use extra fontina and gorgonzola.

This is a go-to entertaining recipe for us. Very easy to adjust to your tastes or available ingredients. I will say that it makes a LOT. I've always needed 2 3-qt glass casserole dishes to fit it all. So, when I'm just making it for our weekday dinner, I cut it in half. Also, the ability to easily prepare it ahead of time is perfect for when you're having guests for the weekend.

I guess the people that complained about the cost do not have Trader Joe's, Costco or Sam's. All the meat/chesse is resonable there. This is the best recipe to make ahead and feed a crowd. I love it.

I made this for my book club and everyone loved it. I substituted baby bellas for the shitakes because I like them better. It's a little rich but worth the calories.

I made this for a big family dinner and everyone loved it! It was a bit time consuming, but worth the effort. The only ingredient that I had to substitute was the shiitake mushrooms since they're not available. Used crimini and they worked just fine. I will definitely make this again.

This came out very well. I made this over new years. We wanted some sort of baked pasta, and this had enough interesting tastes and spices to distance it from a typical casserole. We have had it as leftovers and it stores and reheats well also.

This is by far the best recipe I have ever tried on Epicurious. I made this for part of a dinner party, got rave reviews and everyone wanted the recipe. Only change I made was substituted buttom mushrooms for shiitake because of cost. I'll certainly be making this again and again.

You can't go wrong with this dish. The sauce is very flavourful, and it can be made a day ahead...perfect for entertaining. I love the recipe as it is, however, next time, I might add some kalamata olives for a little kick. This is one of my favourite pasta dishes, a big hit with our guests.

I cannot believe I found this again!!! I have been crazy abt this dish since I first prepared it. I tore a page from a magazine, made the dish out of town for family, and everyone loved it. I later lost the recipe and did my best to remember every detail, which I thought I did fairly well, and have made it again and again from memory. Well, here it is. One difference is that I thought it called for Portabella mushrooms and not Shiitake, however I did remember the roux (not perfectly) and the red pepper flakes (but not the other spices). It's a crowd pleaser.

Pretty easy and got rave reviews at my dinner party. I also liked it because it allows you do visit with guests while it's in the oven. Easy and tastes great.

This was very easy to make and was a big hit at a recent party. I like that you can do all the prep work the day before. I served with two other pasta dishes, green salad with blue cheese and for desert, we had tiramisu!

My husband said he wouldn't like this dish. I have to agree, it wasn't a beautiful looking dish (the color is what did it). I used shitake & oyster mushrooms. I used cheese that I had on hand. I used reggiano, asiago & mozzarella. I also combined everything in a big pan, put some of the sauce in the bottom of the baking dish and then layered the pasta and sauce like you would lasagna. I also added green olives that I needed to use. I will make this dish again without a doubt.

Rating: 4
Oh my goodness, was this delicious. You don't want to know how many helpings we all had. I substituted creminis for shiitakes and deli-sliced black-forest ham for the prosciutto as a cost-savings, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was just SUBLIME. I'm mystified by those who found the color off-putting--perhaps they used portobellos without de-gilling them? That can make things muddy-looking. If this weren't so fattening, I'd make it every week.

We made this for a dinner party for 6. We probably had another meal for the 2 of us w/ the leftovers. IT was a huge hit and easy to prepare in advance.

I have made this numerous times for parties without the prosciutto (making it a great vegan option for guests), and it has always been a hit! If you think shiitakes are too expensive, get the freeze-dried ones at any asian grocery (about $4 a bag ~ 1lb re-hydrated). Last time I made it, EVRERYONE wanted the recipe!

I made one fourth of the recipe, omitting prosciutto. It still made a gargantuan amount for a side dish for two. The pasta was pleasantly creamy. My husband liked it. I thought it was good but not great. Bacon, ham or prosciutto might improve the flavor. I'll keep looking for better ways to use my fontina.

This is a three and a half forker. Mmmmm delicious! I skipped the prosciutto and used white mushrooms (1.5lbs), but otherwise followed the recipe.

I made this recipe for Christmas 2004, and everyone decided it was the best part of the meal. Similar to another reviewer, I substituted crimini mushrooms for the shiitake, and it was great. As the recipe indicated, don't boil the pasta for long; it cooks again in the oven (that was probably the cause of one reviewer's "mush" problem). It was great to be able to make it ahead of time (I made it the night before). Just make sure to bring it up to room temperature before baking.

Very tasty and worth the time and effort this dish takes to make. My family all had seconds. Just plan ahead for all of the grating and chopping!

I made this recipe for a family Christmas party last year and it was extremely well received. I substituted baby bella mushrooms for the shiitake as I prefer them. I think the gorgonzola "makes" the dish - just enough to give it some bite and depth. It is a bit of effort but it can all be prepared the night before and stored in the 'frig until baking time. A perfect party dish. I have been requested to make it again this year.

This is a hearty, winter type of dish. I just happened to have one Andouiille sausage on hand that I chopped up into fine bits and added it to the sauted onion and garlic. What one sausage can do! Very good!

I rarely cook and I made this recipe for a party and it was delicious. It was time consuming but not overly difficult. In addition to shitakes, I used cremini mushrooms and portabella. Because we had some vegetarians, I left out the prosciutto and it was still good. Leaving out the prosciutto cut down on the cost.

Rating: 4
Delicious but I make the following changes. I used soaked dried shiitake mushrooms that I always have on hand as the grocery stores are undependable about fresh. I also use ony 14-15 oz of pasta. Put proscuitto in food process to get small pieces. Instead of mixing the pasta and sauce together, I put a little on the bottom of the pan, then pasta, then sauce.

I read all the suggestions made by prior cooks and heeded the advice of adding more liquid from the tomatoes. I found the dish didn't need it. I halved the quantities, used "dry fines herbes" instead of the dried basil and oregano, doubled up on the garlic and hot red pepper flakes and used regular macaroni. My husband and I both thought it was delicious. My only complaint (and not my husband's) was that the tomatoes tasted a little acidic, but a very minor criticism. Definitely a recipe which can be modified to suit varied palates.

I halved this for company, and we all loved it. I don't think is was that expensive to make, as I used regular button mushrooms, and the amount of cheese is small. My fussy daughter even asked for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, went out and bought high quality cheese and prosciutto and wasn't super impressed. It turned out a little dry- it may be a good idea to add some more milk. If I make this again I think I will halve the amount of tomatoes. The cheesy flavors were rich and yummy, but other than tomato that was all I tasted.

Rating: 3
Very good recipe to make ahead and bake while enjoying company. I would omit the Prosciutto as it got lost with all the rich cheese & mushroom flavors. I also added some of the juice from the tomatoes as I thought it would be too dry. Came out AWESOME! All the guests thought it was great.

I made this dish for a group last weekend. It was a big hit. Delicious. I agree with a prior rater that it was indeed expensive to make but well worth it. I will definately make it again. Use the very best cheese, proscuitto and mushroom and tomatoes. I went to Boston North End to shop!! Try it!! You'll love it.

Followed the recipe exactly except I left out the prosciutto--it was the vegetarian offering for a dinner party--absolutely delicious and presented beautifully. One caveat: Expensive!

My husband dug in before I could add the prosciutto or the topping. Unbaked! I choose my battles carefully, so got a plate and sat down at the table with him. It was fine. Maybe I would give it 4 forks after baking! I used fresh roma tomatoes, good ol' elbow macaroni, mozzarella, parmesan and havarti cheeses with a bit of cheddar. It was a very elegant mac and cheese.

Reading the other reviews helped a lot as I began all of the prep work for this fabulous dish. Thank you! I used both bows and penne, regular white mushrooms instead of shiitake and a bit lower oven temp. Assembling it the day before works beautifully. I would not change a thing about the cheeses but might play with amounts and types of tomatoes in the future.Use the best deli proscuitto you can get.(I sliced it in stacks then separated the strips and put them between sheets of plastic and stored in fridge until needed.) I served it to eleven people--all loved it. Halving it to save work and money is a great suggestion if you don't need the full amount. I disagree with the comments that it gets better next day; I prefer it freshly baked.It's going to be hard to resist making this for every occasion now. I'm thinking: Let's forget the turkey at Thanksgiving! Only regret--as a long time Gourmet subscriber, how did I miss this recipe?!

Great dish! I didn't find this dish too costly. You can definitely cut it in half and serve with salad and garlic bread to lower the cost. I served it for the first time at a dinner party and everyone raved about it. One guest was sure I didn't make it myself! For ease, I suggest you buy deli prosciutto. The pre-packed sticks together and is hard to work with.

I copied this out of Gourmet years ago and use it over and over as a company dish. It's excellent, and worth the small efforts, and quality purchase of prociutto, et al.

This was very tasty and a great recipe if you need a pasta to make ahead. It does taste better the next day. Most pastas need to be tossed at the last minute, with the pots needing to be washed later. This one leaves one dish to wash. The gorganzola and prosciutto make it very flavorful. Although it is not my favorite pasta it is a great one if you need to prepare it in advance....and serves a lot.

I have made this pasta dish on numerous occassions, and even prepare it ahead of time and freeze it, making sure I thaw it out in the refrigerator before cooking. Great for entertaining, and I frequently use 1/2 shiitake's and 1/2 button mushrooms. Simple, elegant crowd pleaser. And when you are entertaining, who cares about fat and calories. Stay home for that!

I was thrilled to find this recipe on the web. I first made it in 1991 when it was originally published then made it several times after that. Somehow, when I purged old copies of Gourmet I failed to clip this one. I needed a tasty, elegant do ahead pasta for an upcoming dinner party for eight and this recipe immediately came to mind. Absolutely delicious. Goes well with a full-bodied red wine.

Certainly delicious...I did the prep work earlier in the day (chopping, grating) so it made the actual cooking go much faster. My husband LOVED it - flavors were complicated and interesting especially with the gorgonzola. Will definitely make again-

I have been making this dish since 1991 when it was published in the magazine. I recently moved and I can't find my gourmet magazines.

I agree 100% with the cooks who described this delicious recipe as labour intensive, both in terms of shopping & chopping, expensive (and how !) & calorific (aaagh !!!) Assembling all those ingredients is a tour de force & makes a mountain of washing-up. However.......it's rich, scrumptious & never fails to get rave reviews when I make it. This wasn't too often, for all the reasons mentioned above, until I hit on the idea of halving the recipe. OK, not very original, but this recipe halves perfectly & the saving in time, effort & money is amazing. I now make it much more often & find that a half quantity feeds 6 not-too-gluttonous diners perfectly with crusty bread, a big salad (the one in the original issue of Gourmet is great - slightly bitter to balance the richness of the pasta) & lots o' robust red wine. You don't get any left-overs this way but, hey, you can't have everything !

I used regular white button mushrooms, it was very tasty. I agree that it is comfort food, and good for a cold winter day with friends. I made a part with out the PROSCIUTTO and it became a very nice vegetarian dish as well.

I have made this recipe several times and it is definately a crowd pleaser. It has become a "requested" dish by family & friends. I like to serve pasta, but when you have a large crowd, I want something I can make ahead and pop in the oven. Most "baked" pasta recipe do not have as much flair as this one. The trick is to have all the ingredients prepared (chopped, minced, crumbled, etc.) before you start. The only part I dis-like is cutting thinly sliced prosciutto into strips!!!

Rating: 2
This recipe calls for seasoning with salt and pepper only after a number of ingredients have been combined, making it very difficult to season properly. As a result, my pasta dish turned out rather bland and disappointing. Interestingly, the leftovers, which sat overnight, were much tastier (after seaoning with additional salt) than the first time around. However, I would still not bother making this again, as I could certainly come up with as good or better combination experimenting on my own.

Maybe the previous reviewer read the recipe wrong, it calls for gorgonzola, which we found to be rather subtle. Instead of Shitakes, we used plain old mushrooms w/a few portobellos thrown in and eliminated the prosciutto. It turned out great.

The gouda overpowered everything. Why use shitake mushrooms @ $12 a pound when you can't taste them? I cooked it in a cast iron casserole and it needed a much longer time to bake. I would not make again.

With all the rave reviews I just had to try this one and I'm glad I did. I must say I was a bit apprehensive about the colour prior to baking...kind of a grey with red flecks, but the dish didn't disappoint. Full of flavour, great with a gutsy red wine and some nice fresh rolls. Perfect dish to take to a buffet or pot luck. I used fresh pasta as opposed to dry and I didn't pre-cook at all. This method worked beautifully and cut out a step. Must be a real guy dish because as noted by prior respondents, my husband loved it too!

Outstanding! I used over a pound of skiitake mushrooms and a large portabello. I used all the cheese in the sauce. I used addition cheese on top...a combination of both imported Parmesan and sharp Asiago. I also sprinkled the top with toasted pine nuts and dried breadcrumbs made from Italian bread. A small green salad, perhaps crusty bread and a glass of wine make a great meal. This is not for dieters!

I thought this was a good dish, while my boyfriend really liked it. I had high expectations, however, after spending an HOUR preparing the dish for the oven. The good news is that the recipe makes enough for a second meal. On a side note, I omitted the gorgonzola as I'm not a fan of blue cheese, and the dish was still tasty.
