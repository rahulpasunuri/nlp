I liked this salad but did not love it. My boyfriend on the other hand loved it. So to each his own. Lots of chopping to be done so I think it takes a little longer than stated.

Great, fresh-tasting, light summer salad option that I initially feared because of the "Waldorf-esque" ingredients. I was pleasantly surprised. Good use for leftover chicken, even if it is grilled/braised/barBQ'd (poached may be a bit on the bland side). I didn't have Boston bibb lettuce and just tore up green leaf lettuce, actually tossed it with the vinaigrette rather than "drizzle". Good, easy, flavorful dish that is an entire meal in itself. Will be making this again.

This is a wonderful, delicious salad. The only thing I changed was to double everything. The vinaigrette is perfect!

I absolutely loved this salad. I actually didn't use the exact vinaigrette recipe as we had a lemon vinaigrette left over from the night before. But the mix of the fruit, meat, and walnuts was delicious. I would make this again. My husband thought it was good, but he doesn't like to mix fruit in with his "other food."

My husband said this is now his favorite salad...... grilling the chicken made a huge difference. I'll try the suggested marinades next time.

I changed this substantially and it ended up being excellent. I cut the chicken into small chunks and then let it marinate in some olive oil, lemon juice, white wine, garlic, salt, pepper and onion powder for about half an hour. I then pan seared it in a combo of olive oil and butter. I added some cider vinegar to the dressing and a dash of salt I added a combination of fresh feta and fresh mozzarella to the salad as well as some arugula. The end result was to die for!

This salad was a big hit with my family. I did decide to grill the chicken instead of poaching it, which was really good. I marinated the chicken in the salad dressing, which made the chicken even better.

I used grilled chicken. Nothing special. I followed the recipe but found the dressing to be too oily.

This recipe is fantastic just as written, but I've also made it sans chicken. I usually add a teaspoon or two of cider vinegar to the dressing and spread some thinly sliced pieces of the granny smith apple on top of the salad. Top it off with some freshly ground pepper and it's delightful.

I didn't bother making the chicken. Just wanted to say the salad and dressing is so delicious! Very easy to whip up in a flash.

Dressing is delish, but more than you need. Ran out of walnuts, so substituted marcona almonds for remainder of nuts (great!). Grilled chicken (tried on first attempt at this receipe to poach the chicken and it was awful)and grilled was a better texture and taste. Mixed it like a salad vs. the deconstructed version described and it turned out better as a dish the second time around with these changes. Very tasty!

This salad is very tasty. My only complaint would be that I wouldn't consider 55g of fat per serving to be healthy.

I love this salad and could not get enough of the dressing! I'm glad I gave it a whirl. On my leftovers, I used a bit of leftover feta too! Yum!

My family loved this recipe. I basically doubled it, though I was pretty loose with the proportions. I used some tandori grilled chicken from the night before, and I used a large apple not so finely diced. Delicious!
