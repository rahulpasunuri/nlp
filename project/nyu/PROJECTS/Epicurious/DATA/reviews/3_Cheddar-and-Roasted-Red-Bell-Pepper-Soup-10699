A good starter soup, but doctor it up for more satisfaction! I used a large sweet potato instead of the russet...this made for a sweeter and smoother base. I substituted a can of clam juice and chicken broth for the liquid. I added garlic, skipped the Worcestershire and used smoked gouda cheese, Garnished with sour cream...yum!

I feel bad that I didn't love this soup as much as the other "chefs". I don't know where I went wrong, but I thougt this was way too much cheese! The soup was tasting very good with extra roasted peppers and an addition of celery and garlic..should have left it like that and just garnished it with the cheese. The cheese made it very heavy and goopy! Maybe I did something wrong? I will make it again with cheese as a garnish.

This was fantastic. I only gave it 3 forks because as written, it would have been very dull. I added garlic to the onion mixture and added much more tabasco and worchestershire and it was great. I also used chicken broth in place of the water.

This is a great comfort soup. I added a can of chicken broth to it and blended a chilli pepper up with it to add some spice. In the future I would use another roasted pepper and blend that up with the soup as well to try to get a stronger pepper taste. My family really liked it.

This is a nice soup. However, the texture was not as smooth as I would like, and I think it was because I used a nice aged cheddar instea of an inexpensive sharp cheddar! I used part half/half and milk and substituted the water for chicken stock. Didn't use as much cheese.

This is a great one! I make it often at the restaurant where I work. I use the recipe as a guideline and make many changes for large quantities. I don't add any water to the recipe but use chicken broth and cream not milk. I blend with a buerre mixer, and use a roux to make thick and creamy. Have also added grilled chicken with great reviews. It sells well!

This was a delicious first course. I added a little more tobasco and more cheddar for the added flavour. Was a big hit for appetizer New Years Eve!

I started off by roasting a red pepper and then I went looking for a recipe to use it in. I found this recipe and thought I would try it. When I was puttin it together my initial thought was that it needed something extra to give it more flavor but I followed the recipe as close as I could considering I was halving the recipe. I used 2 year aged Wisconsin chedderfor the cheese and it complimented the soup quite well. Once it was done and I tried it I was very pleased with the results. If you follow the recipe as written you will get the full flavor of the roasted pepper as the most distinguishing effect. I will definitle use the recipe again.

I have made this soup many times and have close friends who particularly love it. I personally find it too rich and heavy....can only imagine the calories and fat grams! I agree with the comment above about taking care not to add too much potato....the potato can overwhelm and you will find yourself wanting to go overboard on the cheddar to offset the flavor. I have also added chopped pimiento for presentation...along with fresh herbs (parsley, basil, whatever....but go easy...you don't want to start a whole new thing just for looks!)

I found this recipe to be very heavy and filling but overall good. The potato I thought did NOT need to be added, it gave the soup a starchy taste. The cheese alone made the soup nice and thick. I substituted 1 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 cup skim milk for the 2 cups milk. Also added garlic for more flavor. And I pureed 3/4 of the peppers with the soup and added the other 1/4 to the soup when it was done. THe color wasn't as great as I'd like to see but maybe if I add all the peppers and omit the potato it might be a bit prettier. Definitely a keeper with the variations mentioned.

I used 4 medium red new potatoes, peeled and cubed, and 1 large sweet onion, chopped, in extra-virgin olive oil, and 1 cup broth instead of water. I pureed it with only one cup of milk in the blender, then added the other cup of milk and one more cup of broth in the pot. I doubled the amount of worcestershire and quadrupled the tabasco (it didn't end up being hot at all, just tasty). For the peppers, I ended up using half a jar of Trader Joe's roasted yellow & red peppers in oil, diced and blotted, and I used white cheddar so the soup was a nice color. I may not have added all the cheddar; I added it by handfuls until the soup had the consistency and flavor I wanted. All that said, those were just refinements, and this was really an incredibly good soup! Easy, too. I will definitely make it again.
