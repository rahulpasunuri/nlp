For the time, this was nice! I added powdered sugar, as someone else had suggested - because it was too tart and unidimensional before with the tartness of the goat cheese, lemon, AND tart sour cream. I also added fresh chopped and crushed rosemary and more chives, I enjoyed the herbiness, might try lemon thyme or something else too next time. Nice because you could keep the stuff on hand and pull out for last minute company - pretty, but just "good" reviews by guests, although it was all eaten up!

I added sugar to taste so that it tasted sweet and not so tart. We LOVED it!

I changed a few things: I beat the goat cheese with the sour cream and added about 2.5T of lemon juice. Also added chives and rosemary and served on rosemary crackers. MUCH better.

This has become one of my classic party appetizers... I have been asked many times to give out the recipe. Highly recommended - and so SIMPLE.

As a huge goat cheese fan, I was looking forward to making this. However, I found it very bland and boring. It was a waste of good goat cheese.

This was a very refreshing and easy appetizer. I added more chives than the recipe called for. Everyone loved it and it was great on zuchinni and squash rounds. Would definately make this again.

A cook from Texas--A great, easy, refreshing dish which was well recieved. Capers might add to add more interest. Will most certainly make again.
