I have been licking homemade ice cream from dashers at family picnics since I was a little girl.. and now I frequent this little shop that makes goat milk's ice cream...But this ice cream is the most luscious,elegant ice cream I have ever tasted AND I made it myself!

This was decadent! The flavor was rich and perfect, the texture was ultra smooth and creamy! You can toast the pinon's in a dry pan on the stovetop...no need to heat up the oven. Enjoy

My chef made this ice cream about a year ago, and my brain automatically updated its favorite ice cream flavor. The heavenly taste of raw honey and roasted pine nuts intermingling with the smoothness of the vanilla heavy cream automatically set me to an eastern European cottage tucked away neatly in the dark forest. It took me a year to step up and try this recipe on my own, and viola! In my honest opinion, there is simply no better ice cream in the world.

Excellent, though a tad sweet for my taste. I'd cut back on the honey just a little. Also, make it a couple of days ahead of eating it--it improves. My guests raved over it (and they were some picky folks).

Tasty, but unlike the other reviewer I felt that I didn't strain it enough---it was kind of gritty. I'd make it again, but next time I'll strain it through a very fine sieve.

Tastes like something that might be offered at a fine restaurant! I didn't bother straining it, and it could have been even chunkier as far as I'm concerned. Note that in the recipe they forget to mention where to add the salt-- I mixed it into the egg/honey/nut mixture before adding the milk.
