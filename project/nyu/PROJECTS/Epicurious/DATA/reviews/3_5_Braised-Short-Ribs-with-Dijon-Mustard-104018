I'm giving this 4 forks because this is SO easy to make. And unlike so many other braised recipes that require you to start on the stove top and then move into the oven, this one is done all on the stove top. Not sure why some people didn't have enough sauce. Yes, when you put the beef into the reduced wine sauce, you'll fret that there isn't enough liquid but lo and behold, during the braising process, you'll get lots of liquid. Because I'm moving shortly and am trying to use up foods that I already have, instead of shallots, I used one small onion, a bunch of pearl onions, and at the suggestion of a previous user, garlic cloves (in my case, a handful of tiny ones and a handful of medium cloves). Also, because tomatoes are just not in season at the moment, I used a can of diced tomatoes, plus 1/2 can of crushed tomatoes (read "Tomatoland" if you need a reason not to buy "fresh" tomatoes not in season). I'll be making this again, no doubt about it.

Yuuuuummmmy! I took the advice of other reviewers and added 8 large cloves of garlic with the tomatoes, and two teaspoons of brown sugar. Served the short ribs over cheese polent with chives, and it was simply divine. This would be an incredible meal for our next dinner party and I will definitely serve it again.

This was good and moist and rich, as mentioned by other cooks. Not outstanding. I liked that it was simple. Still looking for the perfect short ribs recipe!

This is probably the fiftieth time I've made this and every time it comes out amazing. There is simply no going wrong. I add carrots while the meat simmers for an added sweetness. Guests and family are always impressed.This is tastes so much more difficult to make than it actually is. I would highly recommend this recipe to any level chef.

I'll start by saying that this really fell short of my expectations after all the glowing reports I read. I used my Le Crueset Dutch Oven (works perfectly for every other dish under the sun), but my finished ribs not submerged totally in the 1-cup liquid were RAW!! I've never had a problem with my Le Crueset for any other stove-top simmering/braising, nor my ceramic stovetop - calling simmer a "3" on the dial. I had to literally have the liquid almost boiling for an additional 1/2 hour to cook the top layer of ribs. The flavor was ok, nothing spectacular. Followed the recipe exactly - found it took 25 minutes to boil down the wine, and with the extra cooking time I needed for the ribs, this was almost a 4-1/2 hour cooking experience. I'll try other short rib recipes before making this again. My husband thought the ribs had a lot of flavor, but he definitely didn't want seconds. Maybe I'll try again.

Wonderful! But as we are empty nesters, we scale back our quantities - with one important exception - that we never ever diminish the quantity of the sauce. I had wanted to make a good comfort dish for my wife as she had slaved away the day on a volunteer project. I seared only 1.5 pounds of flanken style ribs in an inner enameled pot. I was very impressed with the ability of the ribs to provide their own moisture. But what fat remained from the sear simply was not enough for the shallots. For that reason, and as I knew the wondrous fond would burn to ruin, I added a mere tablespoon of grapeseed oil - high smoking point, no burning. Glad I did! The sauce was amazing, the recipe's original quantity just perfect for the garlic mashed potatoes on the side. So easy, so few ingredients, so dramatically flavorful, so open for little variations, so little prep time! This is a keeper!

This is absolutely delicious. I used boneless short ribs and canned tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. I love how so few ingredients produce such big flavors. Highly recommended. It's an ideal winter dish.

Rating: 3
A couple of things about the way the recipe is written..... 1, most short ribs including flanken, come already cut into individual ribs. The direction to cut the ribs into 1" pieces would lead one to think that they were specifying boneless ribs since few home kitchens have a butcher's saw. Secondly, braising on the stovetop is tricky for the home kitchen. It's much easier to get a slow, gentle braise in a slow oven. I put it in at about 300 degrees and extend the total cooking time to about 3 hours. This could be why some people didn't have enough sauce at the end; it boiled away. A couple of cook's notes: You need to use a good quality wine here with some heft to it since it makes up the majority of the sauce. Another reason why some people ended up with less sauce, canned tomatoes have already rendered most of their juice. The fresh ones are specified for a reason. For those who said it didn't have much flavor, try it again and this time REALLY brown the meat and REALLY brown those shallots.And don't add any other oil. The meat should have rendered the type of fat you need to get a good fond in the pot without burning. (Olive oil burns faster). Then when you add the wine, boil it a few seconds and scrape up those browned bits into the sauce. That is the key ingredient because the sugar in the shallots will have caramelized into little yummy bits. Then set the ribs in the pot with the cut side of the bones vertical. This lets more good stuff from the bone into the braise while letting the meat soak in the juice.

Rating: 2
The flavor was good. The presentation after braising for so long was horrendous. Sure it fell off the bone, but it was a bit too much as I basically served a bunch of beef shreds. Not what I expected at all.

This is the BEST simple braise for short ribs. I use very strong Dijon mustard and I add a large bay laurel leaf and some whole allspice and black peppercorns to the wine as it reduces (remove after). I have used drained, chopped good quality canned tomatoes when even the frash plum tomaties looked horrid. It was still lovely.

The meat was fall off the bone tender, so very delicious. I would say I thought the sauce was missing something. I did add 5 cloves of garlic to the shallots, which helped, but I still felt something was missing. Maybe next time I will add a few sprigs of rosemary or some other fresh herb. I did add a tbl. of brown sugar in the end, which helped balance the acidity from the tomatoes.

Juliavaile from Charleston, SC on 12/31/07 I've made this recipe several times now, each time a bit differently. After much trial and error, I think I've figured out the KEY to making this utterly outstanding! Here goes: first, season the ribs WELL with salt, fresh pepper, and a little garlic powder. Take your time browning them on all sides-you'll be glad you did later. For the wine reduction, I simmer one bottle of a "big" flavored red like cab, or zin down to about a cup or so. (Merlot is OK, but doesn't create the same "zip"). Depending on the fattiness of the ribs, I may add a little olive oil to the pan for the shallots. For the tomatoes, I substitute diced can tomatoes, and add about 1-2 tsp of sugar to cut the acidity. With the shallots, I add about 8 whole garlic cloves and saute them until carmelized. After everything is put in the pot together, leave them on the stove at a med-low simmer for one hour (try not to open the lid much if you can help it). After the first hour, I throw in the garlic, onion, & diced tomato mixture and simmer on low about 3 hours. The longer you simmer, the more the veggies fall apart and incorporate into the sauce. If the sauce gets too thick, I always keep a little extra wine and beef stock on hand to thin it out a bit. The cook time is the most important factor in creating a very good dish versus one of the most decadent, delicious things you could ever imagine eating. Like one of the other Reviewers mentioned, it's great if you can cook everything a day ahead, so that you can skim the fat before reheating.

I have been using this recipe with beef and lamb. When I don't have shallots, I use small onions (red ones are best). I also use canned, whole plum tomatoes and the juice and reduce the wine by a cup. Perfect and easy for a stormy day at home. Perfect served on noodles, rice, polenta or mashed potatoes.

This recipe was delicious - I made it on the first wintery night of the fall. I followed the recipe as closely as possible, with one exception. I used boneless short ribs to cut down on cooking time. My husband would definitely give it four stars, he loved it! The meat was tender, but I felt that the sauce needed a little something to round out the flavors... I'm not sure what. But it was great, and not hard at all.

Rating: 4
These were terrific - I added some diced tomatoes, and some garlic just after the wine and mustard. I over reduced the wine a bit so the ribs looked a bit purple for the first while. Happy to say the purple stew effect disappeared after I threw in 1/2 cup of beef broth. Scrumptious.

Rating: 4
Fantastic. Any cut of short ribs will suffice. I used "English Cut" and it was just fine. Don't spend a lot of time hunting down flanken cut ribs, as they might be harder to find. Served with Mashed Pototoes with Green Onions recipe from Epicurious. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
Outstanding flavor! I read most the reviews before preparing, so I was a bit nervous about not having enough sauce, so I reduced my wine to about a cup and a half. I can't believe the flavor of this recipe with only a few ingredients. Will absolutely make this again. Everyone loved it. The only two drawbacks was the fat in the sauce. So thick. And also the ribs that I had weren't meaty enough. Next time I'm going to hand-pick my ribs from the butcher instead of letting him wrap up four lbs. for me and send me on my way. I made some mashed potatoes with lots of butter, sour cream, salt, pepper and milk and some chives and the sauce runs right into the pototoes and it tastes awesome. Thanks to all for your tips.

Loved this dish! Used "regular", not flanken, short ribs. Added some garlic as well. Not a big fan of grainy mustard so used only 1 tbs grainy with 2 tbs regular dijon. Didn't have any problems browning without oil in 5.5 qt Le Creuset, nor did I have a problem with quantity of remaining liquid (I reduced wine to just under 1.5 cups. I think a good pot seal and not opening the pot too often keeps liquid from reducing).

Rating: 3
I made this for some friends last night, and though it tasted fantastic, I had some trouble with it. I made it the day before, let the fat solidfy on the top, and scraped it off. Only problem was there was hardly any sauce left after I scraped the fat off. When I went to reheat, the short ribs started sticking to the pan, as the little sauce that remained evaporated. I thought fast on my feet and whipped up a mustard sauce with chicken stock, dijon mustard, garlic and a bit of flour. I poured it over the ribs, and it worked out well. Next time I make it, I don't think I'll reduce the wine before putting it in the pot. I'd rather have more liquid than not enough. Luckily it all turned out and the guests raved about it. I made it with Garlic and Chives mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.

Rating: 2
Maybe it was the ribs themselves, but I was disappointed in this. The sauce was out of this world good, but the ribs themselves hadn't picked up any of that wine/mustard flavors and were not fork tender. I'm inclined to blame the technique (how would the meat pick up the flavor when the sauce was at the bottom of the pot for most of the cooking?), but I don't think I'll be attempting short ribs again.

Rating: 4
The best kind of comfort food! We don't cook beef very often, but this will be our new favorite way. The sauce was silky, rich and meaty, the meat falling off the bones. I used a can of diced tomatoes, and threw in "garlic tops" and some dried thyme for the last few minutes. Also a little cornstarch to thicken things up just a tad at the end. Wonderful served over buttermilk & chive mashed potatoes. My husband loved it & made a point to tell me to give 4 forks (rare for us).

I used 1 bottle of wine and reduced it down to 3/4 of a cup (about 40 minutes). I had no problem browning the meat without oil(I used 2 1/2 lbs of meat for 2 people), although I am always was generous with the kosher salt and pepper, the end result needed more so don't skimp here. I didn't have shallots so I cut a large red onion into 8ths..I dropped in 8 large cloves of garlic during the last few minutes of braising. I used a mixure of a dijon & a grainy stout ale mustard. This is a "braised" dish which means to brown, then cook, tightly covered, in a small amount of liquid - so don't add anymore liquid than called for. If you don't lift the lid and use a good pot less than a cup is more than enough. I used a 28 oz can of plum toms cut in half..I didn't drain them well enough so my braising liquid increased by too much, I should started straining them when I started the meat. The result....drum roll please....2 thumbs up from my husband! Served over mashed potatoes.

Rating: 3
Really nice. Short ingredient list; Comfort food done well. Peeling all of the shallots plus browing all of the ribs in three batches plus three hours simmering was quite time consuming; if I make this again I'll brown ribs in multiple pans to shave off some time. I added 2 more lbs of ribs, a few more shallots and a little extra wine to have enough for guests and leftovers. Served with parsnip leek mash, great result.

Rating: 4
This dish was absolutely outstanding! Hubby and I were amazed at the full flavor from so few ingredients! I used a Burgundy as that was on hand and subbed canned, diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes called for. I oven baked it for 3 hours at 300°last night, after browning the meat and adding all of the ingredients at one time. The fat was easy to remove for tonight's meal and it reheated beautifully on low while my Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes we made (I roasted several heads of garlic while the short ribs were baking). I also served Julienned Carrots & Haricot Vert in Garlic Butter. Delicious meal and so easy to finish up for a weeknight meal!

This is a super recipe which we prepare regularly for guests. Warning!!! Prepare extra. Your guests will want seconds. As has been suggested earlier, you may want to use a little olive oil for the browning stage. We tend to reduce only one bottle of wine rather than the bottle plus that is suggested. This is also a fine base theme on which it is possible to ring a series of changes. We throw in a few sprigs of rosemary or some herbes de provence. We also separate and peel a head of garlic and put the cloves in at the same time as the plum tomatoes. The cloves cook to a delicious sweeetness in the sauce. If possible, make this recipe up to point of adding the tomatoes, the day before. Store it overnight in the refrigerator. No only do the flavours integrate, but this makes it possible to skim the solidified fat from the surface of the pot. Otherwise this recipe cn be on the fatty side. Reheat, add the tomatoes (and cloves of garlic) and...Voila!!! By the way, I would go with mashed potatoes to soak up the marvellous sauce.

Absolutely delicious! The browning gave the ribs an intense, rich and smoky flavour. Give yourself lots of time to reduce the wine - I doubled this recipe for a dinner party and it took a tremendous amount of time to reduce - in the end, I didn't reduce it all the way and while delicious, the sauce was a tiny bit watery. Next time, I will leave myself more time to do the reduction properly. I served this with the mashed potato & rutabaga casserole and the combination was perfect. Everyone loved it!

I prepared the recipe as is but cooked it 35 minutes in my pressure cooker, added the tomatoes and simmered on low for 20 extra minutes - Delicious! I was concerned that the wine flavor was going to be too strong, and that it would be bland with only salt & pepper as seasonings but I was wrong (I used a generic pinot noir). I also agree with other users who noted the longer it sits the better it gets. I would definitely double or triple this for a do-ahead dinner party. I wouldn't hesitate to substitute onion for the shallots, and I will probably add a few whole garlic cloves next time.

I made this using sweet onions and canned, peeled, plum tomatoes. I also served it over a simple risotto. FANTASTIC. I love to make elaborate dishes, this simplicity was a big departure for me. I would adjust mustard and seasoning to taste and please brown the ribs really well.

The ribs I used were well marbled but didn't exude much fat; when I sauteed the shallots the beautiful fond scorched. I should have added oil,but the recipe turned out well anyway. I'd add more mustard next time, though. I halved the recipe and it fed four, contrary to what the full recipe is supposed to provide.

We needed to use the crock pot for the cooking and the meat was very tender but perhaps the flavors didn't develop as well as they would have in the oven. It needed something - so we added some beef stock (reduced) and some sugar. It seemed to be too high in wine flavor and not enough brown notes. We needed to thicken the sauce so it would cling ot the noodles.

I've made this recipe a number of times now, but the first time I tried it I used Green onions instead of shallots, simply because that was what I had in the refrigerator at the time...

This is a wonderful recipe. I've made it with boneless ribs and even just chunks of chuck and it's just delicious. When I use a less fatty cut, I sometime do add a bit of olive oil before browning the shallots. I have used both fresh and canned tomatoes -- no appreciable difference.

My husband has dubbed these "Orgasmic Ribs". Of course I did things a little bit differently but the wine/mustard combo is what makes this recipe. I only used a 750ml bottle (merlot) wine which was about 3 cups not 4. I simmered it down to 1 cup and added the mustard as the recipe stated. Instead of all those shallots I used only 4 shallots but added 4 cloves garlic and 2 coursely chopped onions. Be sure to trim as much fat from the ribs as you can before browning them. I had about 4 lbs ribs. I sprinkled them with some seasoned salt before browning. Then I put everything in a preheated crockpot (!) and let it cook on high for about four hours. Every hour I moved the ribs around a little because the crockpot was crowded. After 4 hours I switched to low and added a large can of tomatoes (tomatoes drained and cut in half) and simmered for another 2 hours. I also added some baby carrots at that point. I served it with mashed potatoes. There was so much delicious gravy at the end because of doing it in the crockpot. The next day was even better. The fat in the leftover gravy rose to the top and was easy to remove. The flavor was incredible; my husband's eyes were rolling in joy!

Ihave tried this recipe a number of times and it always turns out beautifully. This time I cooked in Wales with ribs bought in a local market. They call them long ribs and they are very meaty and easy to prepare as the cut is across the rib. The locals loved it and all wanted the recipe. Beef ribs are not a popular item here maybe I started a trend

Loved it. I too was concerned about what seemed to be the (relatively) low proportion of meat to liquid. So I added some splashes of broth. Unnecessarily so, as it turned out. When I make this again, though, I'll add another tomato or three. And when you serve, provide hot sauce on the table (Crystal, if you can; avoid Tabasco on this one).

In fact, I'll be serving this for a dinner party this Saturday. Everyone's first comment is, "What a great sauce." The early reviews were not so positive, so I'm glad others have tried it and like it too. Also don't know why others say there is too little sauce. I've always had more than enough.

This was really good. Reducing the wine really made a big difference in the depth of flavor. I did add a litte chicken broth because the sauce barely covered the bottom of the pan and I thought that it need a little extra liquid so as not to be dry. Also added some additional whole garlic cloves and omitted the plum tomatoes as I was serving with mashers and don't like the idea of tomatoes on potatoes. Baked the ribs slowely in the over for all around heat 325 for 3 hours...fall off the bone tender. Will make again, great for company as you put in oven and forget it until time for dinner.

Made it this last weekend as a Sunday dinner, and loved it. Pretty much stuck to the recipe, used a midprice australian cab sav (Lindeman's) and some Merlot - don't understand how anyone could get this to be dry (in between the cup or so of wine reduction, plus all the beef fat, I had sauce to spare) unless they simmered too high or uncovered. Served it with some roasted potatoes sliced 1/2 inch thick and generously buttered for added crispness. Shallots are indispensable in my taste (but I love shallots) Only tip: a bit heavy, so recommend you save this recipe for a cold winter night (or a foggy summer night here in San Francisco!) As for the expense, I think it came to about $25 total ($13 for the ribs, $8 for the wine, $2 for shallots, $2 tomatoes) - not bad for a meal that serves a comfortable 4 or even 5...

This dish should be in any gourmet cook's "classics" selections, delicious! Very easy to prepare compared to Boulad's recipe and the Dijon mustard really adds another level of flavor.

I made this dish over the Veterans' Day holiday, when I knew I would have time to make it. It was soooooo tasty! I could only get boneless beef short ribs, and I trimmed them of the layer of collagen-y fat. I followed another's suggestion and, instead of using the shallots, I used a chunked-up onion and five cloves of garlic. The wine (I used a Livingston burgundy, not terribly expensive at all) took probably an hour to boil down to one and a half cups, not the required one cup. I served it, the first night, with garlic mashed potatoes and the second night, I enjoyed the leftovers with broad, curly Meuller's egg noodles. A real keeper recipe, this one!

I don't make many "big meat" dishes, but this one was a nice treat. It halves easily. The shallots didn't thrill me; I'll try wedges of onion plus garlic next time.

Great recipe and sooo easy. I think the person that said there was no liquid must have simmered it at too high a temp. Mine turned out so tender and moist with lots of liquid left in the pan.

I served the ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and the Honey-Gingered carrots as previously suggested. Good meal.

What a disappointment! I've wanted to make this recipe for some time now, and I wish I hadn't bothered. There is way too little liquid (common sense should have told me that cooking 4 lbs of meat in a cup of liquid (once the wine is reduced) would result in burnt-looking meat in very little sauce. Wasted a great bottle and a half of wine, as well. I added some water towards the end, but it was already too late. My boyfriend claimed to like the meat, but I think he was just being kind...afterall, I was holding the meat cleaver. Never again.

I made some changes because this recipe inspired my creativity and I couldn't help myself. My family and I absolutely loved it! My mouth is watering now just thinking about it. This dish was unbelievably flavorful and delicious. In addition to the wine and mustard, I added a cup of beef broth, thyme, salt, pepper, and a pinch or two of sugar to cut down on any bitterness. I used homemade stewed tomatoes and onions. This feast was enjoyed with egg noodles, fresh buttered green beans, and warm, crusty bread.

This is not the same old short ribs that my parents used to make, these were delicious! I used five pounds of ribs for $15.00 and cut off the excess fat, leaving just enough to add the needed flavor for the recipe. This gave me six very meaty ribs. I also used a magnum for Chilean wine for $8.00 and served the ribs with garlic mashed potatoes. The wine reduction does wonders to the taste of the ribs and this method of cooking the ribs turns them into the main attraction for a "Gourmet" meal.

I've cooked many versions of short ribs over the years and this was the best. Tender, flavorful and easy to "make your own" by adding your own touches. The second night we had it with broad noodles and carrots cooked in the juices. Magnifique!

Simple to make, intense, impressive flavor and a real crowd pleaser. Pairs wonderfully with roasted garlic mashed spuds and steamed broccoli. What more could you want for a chilly fall evening by the fire!

This was surprisingly easy and absolutely delicious - very rich tasting for a recipe with so few ingredients. Obviously, the Boulud trick is the key. FYI, one bottle of wine is a little less than you need. I gave the recipe to a friend, who embellished with garlic, onion and herbs, and she said it was wonderful.

Very often I am disappointed in recipes I get on-line but this is an exception.I had people call and rave about this dish. It was outstanding and I have renewed faith in making another attempt as far as on-line recipes.

this is the best short rib recipe ever. the sauce is finger licking good. the only thing I did differently was bake it in the oven. I served it with roasted potatoes & garlic. Try it, you'll like it.
