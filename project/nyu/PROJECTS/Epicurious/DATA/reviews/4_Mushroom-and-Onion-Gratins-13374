We loved this. I made it for 3 (for the 2 of us) I made it in layers in a baking dish and added asparagus in the middle. Served with chicken.

I didn't care for this recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter, only I made it in a 2 qt dish. I think it might be better if you carmelize the onions before you layer them. The cheese and breadcrumbs didn't add anything to the dish.

I just happened upon this recipe and I'm so glad I did. I love mushrooms so I increased by 50% (used a lb and a 1/2), but kept the onions the same. Made in one casserole and put one layer of mushrooms between two layers of onions (increased the cream a little, too). Every drop was eaten and I can't wait to make it again.

Great recipe! Added leftover pulled pork and cayenne pepper the second time - Kabam! ala Emeril!

I made this in a large casserole for thanksgiving and everyone loved it. There were no leftovers! I used a combo of p.bella mushrooms with the normal kind. It was a little soupy so next time I will use less cream and/or butter.

Very nice recipe! It's been a stable for holiday dinner for several years. Don't worry about following the instructions carefully...basically, it's just a layered dish of the onions and mushroom mixture that is then topped with the cheese/bread crumb topping. I usuallyend up using way less onions than the recipe calls for...and go heavier on the mushrooms. I've always made this in a big casserole dish. If you have mushroom-lovers coming to dinner, this is sure to please them!

I thought this was a wonderful sidedish. I made it in a 2qt casserole and next time I think I may add more than the 6 Tbsps of cream to it. I didn't find it very creamy. My quests thought it was wonderful and I too added an extra layer of cheese before the mushroom layer. I will definately be making this again.

Made this for dinner tonight - with grilled leg of lamb. Used panko bread crumbs and mozzarella because I did not have Gruyere. Loved this dish, easy to prepare and very well received. Will definitely become a regular side dish.

I have made this many times. It is now a Thanksgiving standard. This is a superb recipe.

I tried this out on my family and everyone loved it! We had leftovers mixed with scrambled eggs for Christmas morning. This one's a keeper. I might try sweet onions next time.

I bought some extra mushrooms on sale and chanced upon this recipe - it was my lucky day! Absolutely fabulous - my mother even asked for SECONDS, which she NEVER does. I added some cooked bulk sausage to the dish. Carrots and fresh spinach are excellent side dishes.

This is so easy to make and is always a favorite with my guests. Try it with baby portobellos.

My only problem with this recipe is that I didn't double or triple it! I took this to a family dinner. I saw my husband getting the last of it. Then, I saw my father-in-law trying to scrape the dish and complaining about wanting more. It's wonderful! I did add about 1/2 cup more cheese than the recipe calls for. Also, it smells delicious...

Well-liked by my husband, toddler, and myself! Will make again for just us or for guests.

What an excellent side dish! I too made this in a 2qt gratin dish and used extra cheese in the inbetween layers and on top. Rave reviews. I've made it twice already for guests and I know I'll be making it for years to come!

They thought I was nuts when I made this for Thanksgiving...it was the FIRST thing to be gone! Wonderful flavor and texture...added more cheese, and next time I will add a little more flour (needs to be a little creamier instead of quite so greasy)...I think that was my boo-boo though.A BIG Keeper!

This will become a Thanksgiving tradition! I doubled the recipe, added steamed fresh spinach in layers and baked it in a 3 qt. casserole dish for 55 minutes...Simply Delicious!!! Also, I used wild mushrooms instead of the regular ones for a more exotic flavor. Everyone was still talking about it 3 days after the holiday.

This is ten forks! I added a little cognac (1 tsp) to the mix and it was a huge hit at my neighbors dinner party. Everyone requested the recipe.

I made this in a 2 qt gratin dish, and used 1/2 lb of cheese - I suspect that is double as well. My this was tasty. And it was great as a leftover.

Being a cheese-lover, I double the cheese.
