This was good but the hype for it was a bit much. The kirsh added noting IMHO. With a few modifications this could be great instead of just good. I'll try other Croques Monsieur recipes until I find one I love.

I didn't have Kirsch (has anyone?) but I used dry vermouth instead. Nice flavour. Could have used more filling. Otherwise, a great sandwich.

This was good, and quite rich as other reviews have said. I made it with homemade white bread, which added to the overall fluffy texture. ...And maybe it was the kirsch (I know there's not much in there, but I don't drink but once a year), or maybe just the generall richness of the sandwich, but it did leave me reeling a bit. I had to take a break to regain my equilibrium! Whoo! What a sandwich!

Rich & flavorful. Go easy on the filling, because it IS rich.

Good solid recipe. Easy to prep ahead of time.

Great recipe. I didn't have kirsch so left that out. Also, I would use more filling. I used a micrplane to grate the gruyere so it was very fluffy and maybe I didn't get a good measure. I wish they would list ounces for the cheese. Anyway, I would make more filling. The best Croque Monsieurs I had in france were pretty gooey. Also, I added a poached egg to the top of each to make it a Croque Madame. Yum!

I've been making this since it first appeared in Gourmet (no kirsch) starting with grocery store white bread and packaged ham and it was always really good, but last night I made it with Black Forest ham, cave aged Gruyere and a loaf of French White bread from the bakery (with crusts left on) and WOW!! No wonder they always taste so good in France.

I made it without the kirsch and it tasted great. It has the right amout of cheese.

Tasted just like the sandwich I had in a Paris bistro! Easy to make and impressive to guests. I also tried it with french bread instead of homestyle white - a nice change, but white bread works just fine.
