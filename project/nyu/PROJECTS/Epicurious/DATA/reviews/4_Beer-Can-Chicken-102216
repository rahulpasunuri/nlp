I tried something different and it turned out great! I used spicy V8 juice instead of beer last night. Combine that with my favorite dry rub and the chicken was terrific. I have been cooking beer can chicken for years, but this new twist gets an A+.

Made this last night for friends. I used a Creole seasoning as the rub and had a 7 lb chicken which cooked in about 3 hours. I use a gas grill that has three burners so I put the chicken on the center burner which was turned off, and had the two outside burners on medium-high. The chicken was moist and tender and my company loved it! This may become my "standard" way of cooking chicken, especially when we don't want the heat of the oven inside the house.

We absolutely love this recipe. I used to make it with the Memphis rub, but now I just use whatever southwest barbecue seasoning I have on hand (Carl's Western Barbecue Spice is a favorite). It's perfect for entertaining, not just for its novelty value but because it's so easy and inexpensive, and my guests ALWAYS ask for the recipe. Thanks, Steve Raichlen, for putting it on the Epicurious website so I don't have to photocopy it out of my Barbecue Bible anymore.

I have made this twice. Both times we all loved it. It was very moist and tender both times. We smoked in a smoker and finished it off in the oven. We also put TONS of seasoning on the outside - very important. Will definitely make again!

I have made this twice already and love it. The first time, I realized it did not fit on my grill so I had to cook it in the oven. I followed the recipe as shown, but for oven did: 400 F for 30 minutes to brown the outside first, then another hour to hour and fifteen minutes at 350 F to finish the cooking process. I also, instead of throwing away the tenth of the beer at the top of the can, used it by pouring that into a different dish and then added a bit of the memphis rub and then injecting this right into several spots of the chicken. This helped spread the flavor throughout. I have not had it grilled, but it comes out so well and evenly cooked and browned in the oven that I think I'll make it this way year round. I also loved that I found actual beer can chicken holders at the outdoor store so that it's no fuss no muss. We love this recipe, thank you for it.

When our chicken is ready to sit on the throne I always place cloves of garlic under the skin of the breast & thighs. I also stuff quartered apples inside. Next time (which happens to be this weekend) I plan on adding quartered onions with the apples & adding brown sugar with my rub. Either way, you cannot go wrong with the basic recipe and add your own touch. Moist & falling off the bone tender.

I don't bother cooking chicken any other way. Last night's version was Lemon and Rosemay marinated for 3 hours prior to hitting the grill. Make sure to try a variety of liquids; beer, ice tea, coke, lemonade, wine, etc. I've done them all. Take it from someone who has coooked dozens of birds this way...get the beer can holder/stand. It provides a much more stable platform.

One more tip I've learned to prevent flareup of fat drippings is to line the bottom of your catch pan below the chicken with a layer of rock salt. It soaks up the grease and prevents it from burning and smoking too much. It also makes cleanup easy.

This was the best chicken I've ever made - everyone kept checking the grill because it smelled so good. Served with potato salad and veges and my nephew said it was his favorite meal ever! The first time I made BC chicken a few years ago, I didn't put a tray under it and the chicken caught on fire and had to be tossed. My husband had to go to the store and buy a roasted chicken for our dinner party. It was a good laugh for everyone - maybe now I can redeem my chicken BBQing reputation. This time I did everything right and the flavor and smell was fabulous. Will be doing this again.

Ok Guys, I have had the chicken on the grill for 30 minutes and it is torched. I had it on medium, about 150 degrees and the chicken fat must have caught on fire. I have now turned down the heat and hope to save it. I guess I need to do a better job on trimming the fat next time? Thanks for your comments

We make this often, last time two on the grill, just to have great cold chicken around for the week...and we use the carcasses for the broth for rich tasting soups. Just one mishap, Easter Dinner, the ham was in the oven, three chickens on the grill, so when the two hours were up to take the chickens out, it was discovered that the BBQ had blown out, quite early on, (we were still under snow/ice/wind at the time), so from now on, I always check that the grill is hot to the touch, every 20 minutes, as you aren't supposed to open it...needless to say, the ham waited, we painted a few more Ukranian eggs, and waited for the Beer Chicken to be done! (favourite rub: Montreal Chicken spice - clubhouse)

I have made this many times, each one a success. Organic or free range chicken seems to come out tastier than "regular", and I usually use Foster's and whatever wood chips are conveniently found at the grocery. This is a no fail recipe for moist and flavorful chicken!

We love the beer can chicken recipe - make it in the oven when we're not in the mood to grill. The rub is great on ribs as well. We double the brown sugar, pour a thin coat of Buck's syrup on the ribs the liberally sprinkle the rub. When we have extra time - we rub the ribs early and let them sit in the fridge all day. They're great!

I gave this recipe a mediocre review 5 years ago when I first tried it, but am happy to report that I tried it again and it has now become a staple in my summer grilling repetoire. The first time out I think I didn't cook it with sufficient heat; it took forever and was sort of flabby. Now that I have the technique down and have purchased beer can holders that keep the bird stable I'm a huge fan, as are all who've eaten this. It's a great "set it and forget it" dish for casual outdoor entertaining. And - bonus! -you get to drink beer while you make it. :) Like most grilled foods, it benefits from throwing a few soaked hardwood chunks on the grill during cooking. The rub is very good on the chicken, but I think I like it even better on grill-smoked ribs.

Rating: 4
It's amazing how far this recipe has come. I first learned it at the hunting camps in Texas in the early '80s. It was known as 'Drunk Chicken'. It's great with or without rub, but a coating of oil or Itailian dressing is a must. As for the problem of it falling over, you can buy stands to set the can in or poor the beer in then place the chicken over the stand. I find that light beer is not as good as a full bodied beer. And it doesn't work as well on turkey.

This recipe is wonderful! My boyfriend, who is usually not easily impressed, said this was the best chicken he ever tasted. If someone doesn't think so, he or she obviously didn't follow the directions properly, I think. I can't grill outside, so I made it in the oven, and it was still wonderful. Also, in Germany we can't find beer cans easily since almost all beer comes bottled, so I used a an empty small vegetable can, which worked fine. Thanks to all former reviewers for the great tips!! Love this site, and it certainly adds to reversing the prejudices towards American cooking that are prevailing here in Europe.

This is all flash and no taste. There are eight million better ways to grill chicken. PS Lifting the lid has nothing to do with burning the chicken. No laws of science can explain your theory....

The Key to keeping the bird from burning is NOT OPENING the grill. Make sure the coals, gas are perfect before you begin, then resist the urge to peek. Somehow, opening the lid every so often to check causes the bird to burn. If you just leave it, it will be moist and wonderful.

I've made this many times and love the Memphis rub. I recommend a few changes. Drink half of the beer before inserting the can into the chicken. I use a gas grill at 300 degrees for an hour to an hour and fifteen. Keep the lid closed! You'll never grill chicken differently again.

This was the first time we've ever made any version of this recipe. We followed it precisely (except we drank the first inch of beer instead of pouring it out).

This is definitely a do-again recipe!

I made this recipe with three 3-4 lb chickens in a Weber kettle grill for the opening night of a week long retreat and it was a smash success! I made the following changes according to other reviewers: I used a preblended spice rub and rubbed it under the skin of the chicken, in the cavity, oiled the skin with olive oil and sprinkled it over the skin and in the beer. I stuck several rosemary sprigs in each beer before putting it in the chicken. I used regular 12 oz beer and had no problems with the lid or with getting the chicken off the beer can. A pair of sturdy tongs and an oven mitt took care of that! Very, very easy recipe and a real conversation piece. Everyone wants it again for next time.

This makes the most increadible chicken. You can vary the recipe in endless ways. I find using a dark ale is a great way to add depth to the flavour. Be exteemly careful handling the hot chicken and beer, it can be unstable on the grill.

We do alot of grilling all year long, and have made some great chicken, but, this is by far the most incredible chicken we have ever grilled. It is moist and flavorful. We grilled it for 1 1/2 hours, and it was coming off the bone. The Memphis Rub is great and can't wait to try it on some pork ribs. I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugarto it for a bit more sweetness. Don't see how anyone would not like this recipe. Looking forwad to beer can turkey. WOW oh WOW!!!!

This was absolutely the moistest grilled chicken I have ever had! We will do all of our grilled chickens this way now. And it lends itself to variations so well; want Greek?

I have been making whole chickens with beer cans for many years(it was called beer-butt chicken when I first saw the recipe), and it is good with ANY recipe. While most seem to think the secret to the succulence is the "steam," my scientist friend insists it is the hot can cooking the bird from inside out. Make sure the liquid in the can is warm/hot when you start. I use the tall Guinness cans, half full, and I have dedicated leather work gloves for removing the cans (just pick up the bird by the neck cavity, twist and pull out the can). At my house, we always cook at least two birds at a time. We call them "Dancing Chickens" because I used to tease our kids by wondering aloud what the chickens were up to inside the grill. Then I would open and close the grill real fast, so they just got a peek, and say, "Oh my, they're dancing in there!"

From the reviews, I guess I expected this to be as unusual as the cooking method - it isn't. It's just a very good way to roast a chicken. I did have trouble removing the hot beer can from the chicken, and next time I think I'll pour out at least half the beer beforehand to reduce the amount of mess. By the way, I think it's hilarious that the reader from L.A. thinks that "redneck" is a racist term. Look it up!

2 hours? No way! I was dubious about this recipe's cook time, but encouraged by the feedback, I followed the directions to the letter and roasted on indirect medium heat on a gas grill with a 4.5 (right in the middle) pound bird. The breast meat was so dry it was like leather. The dark meat was better, but with a 4.5 lb. chicken, an hour and a half might suffice.

Yummy! I thought the chicken might be a bit dry, but it was moist and tender. The one snafu, was getting it off the grill. I used a 7 lb. Perdue oven stuffer roaster, which on the can, was a little too tall for my Weber kettle grill. I jammed that can in the chicken as far as I could and made it work, but boy was it a mess getting it off the grill and carving in while on the can. Any suggestions for making this easier would be greatly appreciated.

To answer the question about the Weber bbq, I have been using the "beer up the chicken" for years. Everyone raves and cannot believe how moist the chicken is and flavorful. I am a diehard Weber fan and cook everything possible on it and in it. Just use a regular size can of beer (I think that it is 12 ounces but I have been living in Australia for the past 12 years and I have forgotten a lot of the imperial sizes). It works beautifully...

This recipe is a simple and delicious way to prepare a whole chicken on the grill. The spice rub us extremely flavorful and the beer can seems to keep it moist and flavorful throughout.

Yummers! I have been hearing about this recipe for years and finally tried it. Made my own rub and threw in some springs of rosemary in the can too...without a doubt, a delicious chicken with the most tender meat. Don't make the same mistake I made tho. I used a very tall can of beer and the lid to the bbq couldn't close!...the chicken stood too tall. I had to transfer the contents of the beer can to an empty coke can.

Succulent and tasty! Did not use the rub all we used was garlic salt and pepper.

I prefer a different rub on the chicken (2T cumin, 2T curry powder, 2T chili powder, 1T allspice, 1T black pepper, 1t cinnamon) and am a big fan of brining poultry before grilling it (to maintain every more moistness) but grilling "on the can" is absolutely my favor grilled chicken. Also, if you buy a chicken the right size (I like about 3 1/2 pounds), it seems easier to set upright. I've even done a small turkey on a Foster's can and it was great!!

there are loads of various 'beer can' recipes out there. i thought this was good, but the 'memphis rub' was more complicated than it needed to be. there is another so-called 'original' rub that is more simple: 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons paprika, 1 1/2 tablespoons salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon garlic powder and cayenne to taste. good for when you're in a hurry. and a note to the cook from SEATTLE - keep the skin on while cooking, but take it off after. it will be much better. last thing - sorry to all the purists, but the oven is good too (350 for 1 3/4 hours).

We love this recipe so much that we have bought the Beer Can Chicken recipe book (a whole book on the subject) as well as the commercial stands that are more balanced than a beer can. Having done that, I still say beer cans are the best "stands" (you don't have to wash them afterward) - and that this is the moistest chicken you will ever eat - with a dash of fun in the experience!

REDNECK? What a word. Racism on Epicurious! You would think that even here we could be rid of such ignorance, but I guess the world is just not becoming inclusive fast enough.

So this recipe is rearing it's ugly head again? I think that the indirect heat, drip pan, wood chips and dry rub is all good information (but nothing new to experienced cooks). The whole beer can/upright chicken thing is a bit of Mickey Mouse fluff - intended to entertain children and rednecks.

My husband and I tried this recipe out last night and couldn't get the chicken to stay standing on the beer can. Also, we did it on a Weber kettle and the chicken was to high for the kettle lid. Luckily I had bought him the Weber rotisserie kit a while ago which comes with a 6 inch high ring that sits between the kettle and the lid so that worked until the chicken fell over! Ended up putting it on a roasting rack. But since this recipe has received such rave reviews, I will not give up so today I ordered the beer can chicken roaster stand from aquabotics in Florida. They are only $14.95. Search "beer can chicken" on Yahoo and it's the first site on the results list.

Beyond compare in terms of flavor and juicy texture, just make sure your BBQ is big enough! Our standard Weber kettle for the back porch doesn't have enough height to accomodate a 4 lb chicken sitting on a can. Had to borrow the neighbor's grill, but its was worth it!

This recipe is the greatest! My whole family loves Beer Can Chicken! The last time I made it I used "Emeril's Chicken Rub" and it was yummy! My teenage son is in charge of 'extracting' the beer can and always gets a kick out of it! (possible Ob/Gyn in the future?) :-) I usually roast mine in the oven, due to the fact that I only have a propane type grill and it takes a lot of fuel (roughly 2 hours). It's great either way IMO, and I highly recommend giving it a try!

My sister and I are the Queens of new recipes and we made this yesterday for our family get-together. Here are the changes we made: We don't like beer so we used dr pepper, make sure you pour out enough of the cola because it foams a lot when you put the spice in. I did the rub exactly like it said and it was yummy- I only used about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and it was fine. Make sure you spray the can with Pam so it makes it easier to remove the can afterward, I don't see why you need a chicken holder because our chickens sat right up at attention with no problem. I did cover the ends of the drumsticks up so that they wouldn't burn and it was fine. The meat just melted off of the bone, and everyone just loved it. I would definately make this again and I would use the rub on other meat as well.

We were completely surprised at how great this chicken turned out. Used Durkee's St. Louis Style Chicken and Rib Rub. My husband came up with the idea of inserting a tongs or long fork to keep the can of beer upright and steady while I pulled the chicken up and free of the can. It worked like a charm. Having read some of the reviews, we sprayed the beer can with Pam before inserting. Next time we will use some liquid smoke to replace some of the beer. Tried it in the oven as we were having one of our numerous electrical storms here on the east coast of Florida.

The sheer number of reviews is testimony to the success of this recipe. I was introduced to beer can chicken last summer using a slightly different (and delicious) blend of spices: equal parts brown sugar, coarse sea salt or kosher salt, coarsely ground or cracked black pepper, and paprika (I prefer sweet paprika because the black pepper provides enough bite). It was good to find this recipe, however, so I can vary the spices a bit. Just in time for summer grilling!

Amazing chicken! Best barbecued meat I have ever made. It takes a really long time to cook - by the time it was ready everyone was full up on other foods, but they still managed to devour it. The meat was moist and succulent, delicious. I look forward to trying it again.

This is the most awesome way ever to cook a chicken. I cooked it indirectly on a Weber kettle grill. I used hardwood natural lump charcoal.Instead of beer I used Dr. Pepper. Be sure to oil the can for ease of removal. I rubbed the chicken with zatarain's creole seasoning and curry powder. Then I drizzled orville redenbacher's popcorn butter mixed with olive oil on after about 15 mins. For a finishing glaze after one hour I mixed 1 tbsp. Grace jerk seasoning with 2 tbsp. popcorn butter, and 2 tbsp. peanut butter. Then cooked the bird for another 20 mins. and the results were incredible. I got the idea out of a recipe book devoted to beer can chicken and other unordinary ways to bbq by the same guy that wrote the bbq bible. Simply amazing!!!!!

This was a good way to fix chicken it was very moist and juicy had a good favor the only thing I did different was I use a 16 ounce can of beer because the chicken stand up better on a taller can of beer.

I made this in the oven. So simple and very delicious. Oven temperature 375. I roasted my 4.5 pound chicken for two hours. Half way through, I scattered cut up Yukon gold potato wedges, carrot chunks and unpeeled garlic cloves all around. The fat dripping from the beer infused chicken imparted a lovely flavor to the veggies. Even my husband, who is usually pretty blase about my chicken, raved about this dish.

Wonderful and easy- the moistest chicken I've ever had. It's also quite a crowd-pleaser. I've even thrown two into the oven at the same time for a dinner party and got major praise. When just adults are eating I rub some of the seasoning under the skin for more flavor.

I was just browsing the site to see if Epicurious had this recipe. I have made this before with rave reviews and numerous requests for this recipe. If you are using a gas grill, I suggest preheating the grill with all burners. Once preheated, turn one side of the grill off and leave one side on. Place the bird on the side that is OFF, close the lid and you should have a succulent bird in about 60 to 75 mintes.

Used my own rub and chicken was great, but the method is not quite as easy at it looks. One of my chickens was off balance, and kept trying to fall over. Removing them from the grill was quite a balancing act, and I had to remove the beer can to carve, since it wouldn't stand up. Takes at least 3 hands, maybe 4 to manage.

I was really disappointed with this recipe because everyone I knew who has tried this technique raves about it. It results in a moist chicken, but no better than brining. To my taste, there are many other flavors that go better with chicken than the ones provided by this recipe/technique. I still swear by brining the chicken then marinating it in olive oil, garlic and herbs before grilling.

This is one of the best barbeque recipes I've ever made! Very tender! I've tried using a commerical rub, but the Memphis rub is better! I've made chicken salad with the leftovers too (when I've had any) and it makes a very surprisingly peppy sandwich!

Have been making the beer chicken in the oven for several years now, so I tried a 20 pound turkey on a fosters beer can in the oven at 350. It was done in 2 1/2 hours. Awesome. The breast was moist and juicy, and the wings and drumsticks fell off the bone. Not very traditional, but delicious.

While I didn't use this exact receipe, I have been making various versions of this for years. It makes the best grilled chicken bar none. You cannot go wrong with this. I also did it with a turkey once using 3 cans of beer. Fantastic.

Rating: 4
THIS WAS JUST FANTASTIC, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLOUR OF MAHAGONY AFTER COOKING FOR AROUND 2 HOURS. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT I MARINATED THE CHICKENS FOR 6 HRS. PRIOR TO BARBECUING. ALSO BY OILING THE BEER CANS, IT MADE IT QUITE EASY TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE CHICKEN. I PREPARED TWO CHICKENS, EACH ONE WEIGHING AROUND 5LBS. FULLING EXPECTING TO HAVE THE SECOND ONE ANOTHER DAY. NO SUCH LUCK, THEY WERE BOTH EATEN, AND I MUST SAY EXTREMELY TENDER, MOIST, AND FLAVOURFUL. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT USING THE METAL CANS, BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED, SO I ASSUME THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM. I MUST ALSO ADD THAT IT IS BETTER TO USE THE LARGER BEER CANS FOR THE LARGER CHICKENS.

We heard about this method at the East Carolina University Pirate Pigskin Barbeque Cook Off about 6 years ago. The guys from the Holland Grill Company grilled several chickens this way. Each time they lifted the hood of the grill, everybody got a great laugh. That is, they laughed until they tasted the bird. When Hurricane Floyd ripped through eastern NC in 1999, we fed Beer Can (or as we know it, Beer Butt) Chicken and started a tradition. Great way to fix a bird. Enjoy.

Excellent dish. Put it on the grill and forget it. One suggestion, spray the beer can with some non-stick. I had to serve my first chicken with the beer can still in it. The non-stick made the second slide out a lot easier.

I've had great fun with this recipe all summer. First trial was in the oven, standing up in an iron fry pan. We also made it in a smoker, takes about 4 to 5 hours to smoke. Best of all was when I had company for dinner. I took a small potato and stuck whole cloves for eyes and a nose, then carved a mouth. I put two large tooth picks in the potato and stuck it on the top of the chicken for the head. My guest got a good laugh when I took the lid off the grill.

I made this recipe tonight and it was excellent. I didn't have any canned beer so used a can of ginger ale instead. Next time I may just drink the beer and use a soft drink again since it worked so well.

Really tender and juicy - our picky kids loved it! I placed the roasting pan directly under the chickens (atop the grill)which avoided flare-ups. I also added a cinnamon stick to the beer can. I did have a problem getting the chickens off of the grill - they were super hot and not easy to handle. (One tipped over as I was removing it - and the hot beer mix spilled everywhere - so be careful!) I can't wait to make this at our next BBQ!

We made this two nights ago, and then ran out and got another chicken to make it again tonight!!! This is by far and above the best chicken we have EVER had, and we've been cooking chickens the regular way for years. The meat is so tender and so moist - you have to try it for yourself! We will be cooking chicken like this from now on, whenever we can find 2 hours to wait for dinner!! Fantastic! We recommend Corona.

Rating: 4
This chicken is really fantastic and easy. I found that I couldn't properly "carve" it - the meat just fell off the bone when the fork touched it, and we basically just pulled it apart for serving (even the legs and wings just fell off). The best thing is how crazy the little fellow looks on your grill - definitely have your premeal drinks and snacks out where you can glance at him from time to time.

Beer Butt Chicken obviously requires the use of HEINEY-KEN Beer, but since I only had beer bottles in the house, I emptied out 2 Coke cans, poured the beer in, couldn't poke more than one hole in the top, forgot to put the rub in the beer, and ..guess what .. it was STILL a great dinner! The chicken was sensational and it's always fun to serve something as mundane as chicken in such a unique way!

Imagin' dis... a mess of Cajuns bar-b-quing on de bayou wit a big ole "oil-barrel" pit. In that pit dey got six "drunken" chickens wired together, like in a football huddle, seasoned to perfection as only a cajun knows how. Budweiser is the beer of choice here, it's made with rice you know, we believe in helping the local rice farmers you see. I think what makes this recipe so fine is it got two of men's most favorite things, beer and barbeque all wrapped up in one. Just one word of warning, Thibodeaux tried drinking the Budweiser thinking if the beer made the chicken so good.... His lips still don't look so pretty, cher!

We really "cackled" over the way the chicken looked on the grill. Didn't have time to make the dry rub, so we "winged" it by mixing Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning and Prudhomme's Poultry Magic for the rub. Nothing fowl about this - birder make it soon! (>: (Sorry)

Made this recipe several times using a bird of about 3 -4 lbs, cooking for about a little over an hour to 1 1/2. I use a gas grill, cooking indirectly (high heat to smoke chips, then medium-low for cooking), and use presoaked woodchips (hickory/mesquite), that i wrap in foil. I poke small holes in the foil and place the foil package on the heat side of the grill. It smoked fine. Place the bird on the grill, when the chips start to smoke, over the drip pan. I replace the wood chips as per taste to increase more smoke. I keep an eye on the bird and rotate it two or three times, making a crisp tasty skin all around. I have used many dry rubs, but the choice is yours; it's all good. Use a good beer like the mate from australia stated and i found using a 16 oz. works well with balancing the bird and rotating it around. This is a keeper and a great tasting, moist recipe. I have the "Stubbs" BBQ sauce, spicy, and I'm going to try that. You cant go wrong with a recipe that picky children will ask for seconds!! Remember, slow cook and low heat.

Rating: 4
Remember to soak the chicken in a kosher salt brine (2 qts water & 1 cup salt) for a couple of hours. Rinse,pat dry, and season as in recipe. I make this in my oven with a 3 and a half pound bird. At 350 it takes 1 hour and 10 minutes. It really is the best!

G'day mate,this recipe is an "oldie but a goodie" it's been floating around Oz since Adam wore short shorts.(as peter@start.com.au would probably agree).The secret to this succulent, moist "chook" is a bloody good beer.In Victoria, it's a V.B.,in Queensland, it's a XXXX and in Sydney (2000), it's a Tooheys.Dunno which State the chooks come from, mate! Seriously though,we ALWAYS get rave reviews when we make this recipe. Firstly, be sure to pat the chicken really dry and use whatever your preferred spice combo is for the rub. We cook indirectly, on a hooded gas barbie, at medium heat. until chicken is "off-the-bone" tender.Naturally,time depends on the size of chicken. It's a good recipe (and a great talking point) providing you follow the simple instructions in the recipe above.

After his first bite, my husband commented it was the best chicken he ever tasted...so moist and tender. I agree that 350 degrees in a Weber gas grill with indirect heat over a drip pan for about 1 hr 20 mins for a 4 pounder is perfect. "Stubb's BBQ Rub" I found at Von's was perfect and made preparation quicker. A definite fun, delicious recipe.

I would not have believed the difference that the beer can made had I not used the same rub I've always used in the past. It was the moistest chicken I've made, white meat as well as dark. I'm going to have insure that any grill I buy in the future is tall enough for this, definitely a keeper!

our chicken was beyond belief I've never had grilled chicken to stay this moist the only problem we encountered was the chicken standing up was too tall for our grill top to close completely, but we cooked a rather large bird. had a great time doing it. we soaked our hickory chips in some of the beer we poured offwith a little water. can't wait to do it again.IT WAS GREAT!

The August issue (# 45) of Cook's Illustrated has a great dry rub for this - unlike the recipe here, it has no salt and doesn't need it. I've made it several times and has been a hit with everyone, even my picky children!! We are on a low-salt, low fat diet, and this is a perfect fit. To the person who was not happy with how her chicken turned out due to the uneven doneness, be sure to turn the chicken around about halfway through the cooking period and use meat and oven thermometers. Using a 4 lb chicken, it takes me about 45 minutes at about 350 degrees.

This recipe was fun to prepare, and the chicken came out great! But do make sure you empty some of the beer out before putting the spices in. I didn't take enough out of the first can, and while I was busy preparing a second can, the first can started to foam all over the counter. The birds look pretty darn funny sitting perched on the cans on the grill. I used a gas grill, and I did not have any smoking chips, but it still came out great.

I first saw this technique in the Ladies Home Journal (6/2000). I have made it several times with excellent results. The LHJ recipe told how to use a gas grill which makes cooking so much easier--place soaked wood chips in front left corner of grill and place a large disposable pan in the center of the bottom grate and add 2 cups water & replace grate. Close grill and heat grill on medium to 350 degrees. Place chickens on grill and turn off center burner if you have a triple burner grill. You can grill 3 chickens at a time. Grill for 60-70 minutes--perfect results.

First, hate would describe our opinion of the Memphis rub - it was horrid. Too many spices mixed together allowed nothing to come through by itself. The chicken, although cute-sy sitting on the grill with its legs out in front, smoked itself black on the outside, overdone in places, and raw in others, despite almost zealous watching. Unless someone can tell me what I did wrong, I'm not going through that mess again.

Have made this several times this month and it is terrific.The last time I made it I was in a hurry and also didn't have beer, so I just filled a pop can with water about two thirds full and added some garlic and lemon juice to it and just sprinkled some BBQ spice on the chicken and about half an hour before it was done, basted it with Kraft BBQ Sauce. It was great and recieved rave reviews. It is a wonderful technique for tender juicy chicken.

Not only was this chicken one of the most moist and succulent chickens that I have ever made, we had a blast making it! The segment on Epicurious TV was very inspiring.

I made the "Beer Can Chicken" 7-3-00. I read all the comments and noticed all the people with negative responses had themselves to blame! The basic rule when roasting chicken is 20 mins a Lb. at 350. With this, Preheat your grill with a oven thermometer inside, adjusting the the gas knobs till a consistient 350 is obtained. You can't fail unless you break the rules. It was the most Juicy, completely cooked chicken next to commercial rotisserie chicken I ever had! My Children could'nt get enough, so I reccomend making at least two birds (leaftovers won't go bad). It is the most impressive summer time meal to make for a guy BBQ- AHH, AHH AHH!!! If you like BBQ chicken, you can't fail with this one!

The chicken turned out to be one of the most moist and tasty I've ever had, despite it bursting into flames (major grease fire in the dripping pan) at the end of its time on the gas grill. I used a chicken with a pop-up timer, which clearly showed that the chicken was ready (it popped up shortly after I rescued the chicken from the flames). The skin was charred beyond being palatable, but the meat inside was wonderful. I also used hickory wood chips while grilling, which imparted a great flavor to the meat. Unfortunately, since I had to dispose of the skin, I wasn't able to appreciate the spice. Seeing the chicken sitting on the grill was quite humorous, though. Better luck next time!

We had this recipe in Texas with my sister and her family while on vacation there recently. They called it "Beer Butt Chicken" which added to our curiosity in wanting to try it. They did it on a gas grill but it was still quite good. I think I'll try to do this on my charcoal grill/smoker and kick up the rub a bit to see if that brings out the flavor more. It's worth trying with friends if nothing else for the novelty.

We tried this recipe for the first time using 7 guests as guinea pigs. Everyone gave it rave reviews! We tripled the rub recipe, omitting the Accent, and were generous with the onion, garlic, mustard, and cayenne.

When I asked if this recipe was worth doing again, everyone replied with a resounding YES!

This is an easy, fun kid pleaser. I used Winn Dixie brand Dr. Pepper (cheap) and used what spices I had on hand. I added Curry to the rub. That and the Dr. Pepper made great flavor.

I had some of "Emeril's Essence" seasoning on hand that I had made so used it instead of the Memphis Rub and was generous as previous reviewers suggested. Cooked in our Weber gas grill for no more than 1 1/2 hours at 350-400F and it was absolutely fantastic! Incredibly moist and we could taste the flavorings throughout the chicken. What a taste treat--I can't wait to do it for company.

Good recipe. I always brine my chicken first; about one hour in a quart or two of water with 1/2 cup each kosher salt and sugar. Really helps keep it moist. Also, my chicken was done in one hour, keeping grill temperature between 350-400 degrees. No need to cook it longer. Look forward to trying all the variations.

very juicy. I made it on a gas grill, so actually sat the "canned" birds on a foil covered drip pan on the bottom shelf of the gas grill. (remove top two shelfs from grill.) Two small fryers were done perfectly in 1 hour 40 minutes. Also really covered the chicken with a seasoned rub. I made mine very spicy with the addition of jalapeno seasoned salt to the rub recipe. Left overs make a fabulous chicken salad!

Our family has made a variation of this recipe for several years, and called it beer butt chicken. To try the variation, empty half of the beer out and replace it with a zesty Italian salad dressing. It creates a remarkable flavor. We have also used barbeque sauce with the beer with great results. It's a family favorite.

After reading all the rave reviews, I couldn't wait to try this recipe. After completion, however, I'm not sure what the fuss was all about.

Perhaps I'm underwhelmed because I cooked it in the oven and didn't have the benefit of wood-chip smoke.

This recipe was easy and definately worth making again. It was a huge hit, even though we made the memphis rub an hour before applying it to the birds. Oh, and that's another thing, we used water duck (that we had caught last year) and Heineken (think that the spelling) beer in the little German 330 ml can, that way no beer had to be poured off. Besides, even though this recipe is obviously american, their beer is aweful, so something had to be done.

The first time I tried this recipe, I was a bit skimpy on the rub, but the bird came out moist and juicy. The 2nd time I tried this, we were having guests over from out-of-town. I did 3 birds on my 55 gal. barrel pit and slow cooked them with hickory chunks until the internal temp of the chickens was at around 165 degrees. (about 2 hours) I tripled the recipe on the rub to accomodate the 3 birds. I omitted the MSG. (Who uses that anymore?) I also omitted the celery salt and added a bit more garlic and onion powder. When I opened the grill to show everyone what was for dinner, we all laughed at the "chorus line" of chickens propped up on their beer cans. It appeared that at any minute the chickens would start into a "song and dance" routine. After all was said and done, the only thing left of the birds were a couple of wings. That's what I would call a successful dinner! If you like to grill, and have the time to slow cook before you eat, then you have to try this recipe!

Rating: 4
This recipe was fun to make and resulted in a succulent and flavorful chicken. I oven roasted the bird in a large roasting pan instead of grilling. Plus, I added red potato quarters seasoned with the same rub (not the one above; mine was more spicy)and some low sodium chicken broth. Chicken and potatos were both a hit and I'll definitely make this again!

The initial recipe looked pretty daunting - - so we used the oven version offered by another reviewer - it was great! Quick preparation - minimal attention needed during the cooking process.

Very moist and flavorful; the flavour is some what dependant on the beer or ale. Heineken was much better choice than Budweiser. I'll have to try it with Fosters using a large turkey, sometime!

Excellent-the juiciest chicken I've made yet. There was no taste of beer just a moist and tender chicken. The rub was good but next time I'll try the dry rub from the Brown Sugar Cured Turkey recipe which has always been a big hit. I'd also use more rub than recommended an let it marinate a bit.

This bird went over big even my finicky 5 yo loved it. I added more garlic and onion powder and omitted the MSG. I believe that any blend of spices would do.You really have to be generous with the rub. Next time I will make two birds.

If you are looking for a really easy and totally tender bird, try this one! I use my own rub and any kind of beer that's around. You can't taste it, the beer just affords the chicken with so much moisture. Indirect heat grilling is also a great and easy method of cooking. There are NEVER any leftovers. This one is a keeper.

My wife, 4 kids and grandaughter all agree, this is the BEST chicken we ever ate.

This one is a HUGE hit! Our dinner guests all laughed at the chickens over the beer cans -- they stopped laughing as soon as they tried it. I replaced the cayenne with finely ground dried chipotle, and tripled the rub recipe to do two 3 - 3 1/2 lb. chickens (gotta be generous with the rub, it's a must).

A fun recipe to prepare. The chicken sitting on the beer can is a wonderfully comical sight. I cooked the chicken on my Weber gas grill for 1 1/2 hours at med./low. I would be more generous with the rub the next time around.

I've made this dozen times and it is always excellent. Cooking it upright and separating the skin to add the rub results in almost no fat under skin. You can do two at a time in a standard Weber. And the Barbeque Bible is a great cookbook.
