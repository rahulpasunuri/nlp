Surprisingly tasteless

Very, very tasty. Also will probably lend itself to modifications. Only gripe is that the sauce got kind of gummy, other than that it was rich and delicious.

My husband and I are addicted!!! After reading the reviews and comparing this recipe to a few others, I decided there must have been a typo in the amount of cheese. I used 13 ounces of gorgonzola and the 3 tablespoons of basil mentioned by one reviewer. The results were amazing! We liked it so much, we made it 2 weekends in a row! The sauce is also delicious served over rösti. Mmmmm...

This recipe is 0-fork. It is too bland and the reason is that there must be an error in the 3oz of Gorgonzola. Compared to 1.5 lb of mushroom it is too low. We increased to 8oz of gorgonzola and it was still inadequate. We also felt that there was too much mushroom. 3tbsp of basil is also too skimpy. We realized we could add and subtract various quantitites but then we would be making a new recipe. This one is wrong. Gorgonzola lovers: stay away from this one. It is a lot of chopping and stirring for very little flavor.

I tried this recipe before trying the Fettuccine Carbonara with Gorgonzola - there is NO comparison: the Carbonara recipe is far superior. This one should be dinged....

My wife and I thought it was very bland as well, even though I *did* include the basil that is missing in the online recipe. Tastes like a creamy pasta primavera. I guess I expected more taste from the cheese and basil. It was a lot of work chopping for the amount of blandness it had :-P

We just made this old favorite again last night. The original recipe includes 3 tbsp. of chopped fresh basil, which does give it substantially more flavor. (Apparently, there was a misprint or something when this recipe was transferred to the website.) It is easy enough for a weeknight, and makes good leftovers, too!

I thought this recipe was bland. I had to add alot more gorgonzola than what was called for(maybe because I doubled the recipe). Also in your directions it says to add the basil, but there was none listed in the ingredients.

One of our favorite Friday night dinners. It's so easy and delicious.

Yum, yum, yum! This dish is fabulous. A friend and I made it for a dinner party and served it with simple grilled shrimp kebobs alongside. There was more than enough for six people, and everyone raved! The only change we made was to substitute fresh basil for the parsley, but I think either would be fine.

Delicious pasta that stays creamy for leftovers
