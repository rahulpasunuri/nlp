WOW. 4 ingredients and incredibly easy prep--I was not expecting these to be so phenomenal! I did add a tiny dash of vanilla to the batter but other than that made these as written. Some reviewers skipped the sugar dipping but DON'T!! Somehow it transforms these cookies into an almost tart-tasting perfect mouth-melting piece of crumbly, buttery, hazelnutty perfection. I took them out of the oven about 10 minutes ago and I think I already ate 5!

This recipe was really delicious...however a little too sweet for me. I recommend using just flour to dust batter before freezing. Like a previous reviewer, my food processor was broken, so I used my blender and pulsed ingredients. It worked fine until I added the butter. I transferred everything into a bowl and 'cut-up' the mixture in a criss-cross pattern. The mixture turned out perfectly! This recipe is great with other nuts as well! Enjoy.

Awesome cookies! I set a bittersweet chocolate chip on top of each cookie right when they came out of the oven and it melted down just a tad; beautiful and delicious! It was very humid when I made them so they didn't crisp up and instead are soft and crumbly, but still good.

Loved this recipe, very easy to make. I didn't have hazelnuts so I skipped them. Followed everything else in the recipe and place the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes as per advice in this page. No issues with the cookies since they turned out like the picture. Dusted with confectioners sugar..delish!

Delicious. I used half brown sugar and half white, and added 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips.

1st time, used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour to 1/2 cup AP flour & 1 teaspoon brandy. In my oven, takes almost 17-18 minutes to get that light golden bottom edge. Skipped the sugar top, seemed like gilding the lily. A delicious cookie. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Hazelnut-Cookies-109469#ixzz18PIXKTsK

Excellent and easy. I've made these several times and they're always a hit. Light, crumbly, buttery and full of the flavor of the nuts (they'd probably be good with other toasted nuts too). Stuck them in the freezer for half an hour and they were solid enough to bake. I found they need about 5 minutes after they come out of the oven before you dip in sugar, otherwise they crumble really easily.

These are tasty, but my oven burned them in 10 minutes - the second batch was perfect in 8.

Good. I am waiting until they cool and I may stripe Nutella over the top. Previous posters said it was crumbly. after the butter goes in you really need to run the machine until the dough comes together, not pulse. This did not result in a tough cookie from overbeating the flour. Very hazelnutty!

Don't try these without a food processor! I made this with my blender, and cut in the butter the old fashioned way, with two knives. Very difficult and the "dough" was very crumbly, even after refrigerating all night. They smell and taste wonderful, though, so I guess it's worth it.

delicious and easy! i used whole wheat flower which complemented the hazelnuts quite well. i served them with some vanilla ice cream, fresh raspberries and some chocolate drizzle. everybody waned seconds.

Very good the day after just as other cooks have said. My dough was too crumbly to handle and did not look at all like the picture, aesthetics aside, it's worth another try.

I'd give this 2 and one half forks. These were fairly good for a 4 ingredient recipe! I sprinkled powdered sugar on top before serving instead of rolling them in granulated sugar. Served it with granita. My guests ate them all.

I just finished aking these, and they're delicious! I cooled for 2 minutes on the pan and tried to dip in the sugar but the cookie crumbled... maybe it was the silicon baking sheet... so instead I just sprinkled sugar on top. Yummy!

I make these cookies all the time and they are delicious. Very good with espresso or coffee. I dip some in sugar and some I drizzle with dark chocolate. Both are very good. Make sure you chill the dough long enough so they hold their shape and use a cold cookie sheet. The dough freezes really well.

I made these cookies earlier today and they are delicious. You can really taste the hazelnut flavor, and the cookies are the consistency of crumbly shortbread - nice and buttery. They turned out a lot better than I expected!

Maybe I did something wrong. My cookes didn't look at all like the picture - they spread out quite a lot, were lacy and crumbly. The edges browned before the middle was set. Although tasty, they were visually unpleasing. Any hints as to what I did wrong?

This is a quick, easy and delicious recipe! The second time I made it, I used hazelnut meal from Trader Joe's instead of toasting the hazelnuts myself and the flavor was definately compromised. It's best to make your own hazelnut meal. Delicious!

What a crowd pleaser!! These cookies were easy to make, lovely flavor and texture, pleasing in presentation and a cinch. I'm making extra dough to chill and take to my sis-in-law who just had a baby so she can slice them and bake them herself at her leisure, they loved them so much!

Very simple and very good. I made them for unexpected houseguests, with just what i had in the pantry and was very pleased with results. I will make them a standard to offer to guests with coffee.

This recipe was easy, fast and produced a melt in your mouth sensation! I had bought some lavender chocolate sugar from Paris and dipped each cookie right into it. Tres bon!
