This recipe is good but becomes amazing with a little smoked paprika added to the mix.

Easy to make and easy to eat until you realize that they are all gone! Next time I would add some cayenne pepper to the mix, as this was a bit one-note for me. Very nice crunchiness! Make sure to keep them in the oven for long enough. They should be very brown.

My toddler loves these. If you like this recipe, you might also like the kale chips. Both recipes are easy, healthy, and vegan

I use this recipe all the time. It's a delightful snack and it's awesome on salads. I've used various types of spices and the chickpeas are always delicious and buttery. I have used lemon juice in the past, which gave the chickpeas a light citrus flavor along with the cumin.

Like another reviewer, I added lemon pepper. 1st time I made them, they were great while still warm, but apparently I didn't get them crispy enough since the next day they were just blah. Wait until a few start to blacken. They are a healthful snack and a nice topping for dishes that could use the protein, or the texture.

These are really yummy and after you try them and see what they taste like you can really make them your own by adding whatever spices you like. I am making some now with garlic and sea salt. Really enjoy snacking on them!

A wonderful healthy snack. I've made this at least once a week since I found the recipe. I add a tsp of lemon pepper to give it a little zing. Also, try *lightly* smashing or roughing up the chickpeas with your hands so their skins start to come off. I did this by accident with a few and discovered that the skins become deliciously light and crispy! Now I do it every time.

I was making these to put on a salad for a family party but my husband & I decided to eat them:) They remind us of a healthier version of corn nuts (yummy:)

Yummy. My only complaint is that I can't stop eating these...
