I made this for Passover, I prepared it the day before. It looked OK-but the texture was all wrong. It was not creamy it was grainy, taste was OK. I will not bother to make it again

I made it last night and my 14 yo nephew ate 2 big pieces! The texture wasn't as smooth as I expect in a flan, seems like it had many air bubbles. Maybe I over whipped the ingredients? Nevertheless I will make it again and again.

Too much liquid! I am not wasting all my money on this again to make it turn out to me a big mess!

Very good. The orange flavor is very obvious... I would have liked it to be a little more subtle. Also, I would prefer it less sweet. Next time I will cut back on the sugar by 1/3. I had to bake it for more like 2 hours. Maybe because I started my water bath with cool water? I otherwise followed the recipe as-is, and it turned out picture-perfect. Everyone loved it.

I tested this today when I had company over for Sunday Brunch. Everyone thought it was fabulous! I have never used almond milk before but it was really a great dairy substitute. I will definitely be adding this dish to my dessert line-up for next year's Seder!

What a refreshing Passover alternative... and non-dairy to boot ! The flan was light and creamy. Amazing flavors of orange and rose flower had us all raving. I would make this all year round, especially for my lactose-free friends !

I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk because that's what I found. The flan was horribly sweet and had a strange flavor. So if you make this, be careful to find plain almond milk. Orange-flower water is available in gourmet markets next to the rose water.

I made this last night for Passover. It was fabulous. Everyone raved. I will make it again for other occasions. The flan was silky smooth and the orange blossom water gave it that extra lift. I garnished each slice with a twist of orange. Elegant and oh so delicious. The perfect ending to a wonderful meal. Almond milk (my container called it Almond Breeze) can be found near the soy and rice milks in the grocery store. Also in health food stores. I found the orange blossom water in a middle eastern deli. If you can't find it, make this anyway. It is delicious and easy.

This flan is delicious but mine came out very soupy. I am going to make it again tonight and use a little less liquid and maybe cook it a little longer. I used vanilla instead of the orange water and it tasted great. I recommend it but it would be much better a little firmer.

Orange flower water can be found at any East Asian (Indian) market or Real Canadian Superstore in the east asian section if in Canada.

Even with a high fat and sugar content a defrosted flan will leach water.Freezing will completely ruin the texture.

you can find almond milk in good supermarkets near the soy milk or at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's or any health food store.

Many liquor stores stock orange flower water. It's an ingredient in many cocktails.

I would love to make this recipe however where the hell do I get Almond milk and Orange-flower water???? Alexx

This recipe sounds fabulous. However, do you think you might have told us 1) how to make almond milk and 2) where to get orange flower water. I found an almond milk recipe, but have no idea where to get or how to make orange flower water. Orange blossoms are not plentiful in the Northeast.
