These gnocchi were just OK - a little heavy, despite a very light hand while kneading and handling the dough, and not very flavorful. Next time I will try the Daniel Boulud recipe I just found here that sounds lighter thanks to the addition of the whole egg (not just the yolk), and adds parmesan and lemon zest for flavor.

Teriffic! Pushed the potato through a strainer instead of a ricer or mill. Cinnamon instead of Nutmeg. Sauce- olive oil, lemon, anchovies and freshly grated Parmesan cheese- absolutely amazing!

Perfect! I think it's unlikely that this would ever serve 8 people. Maybe 8 people who don't love gnocchi?

Delicious! We didn't have a food mill, so we just used a potato masher and it was fine. The gnocchi were just like scrumptious little pillows--just as other reviewers described them. We served them with a tomato sauce containing, among other ingredients, sage and a couple of anchovies (they dissolve into the sauce and give it a delicious bit of salty anchovy flavour that is surprisingly subtle), and a spoonful of creamy ricotta cheese slathered on top. We've made them twice now in the space of two weeks and both times they were delicious.

I boiled peeled Yukon Gold potatoes and just mashed them and they turned out lovely with a creamy smoked ham sauce. Yes, there were very tiny lumps, but they were light and fluffy and tasty. I froze half of the dough before rolling it out so we'll see how that is defrosted.

This was my first effort at making gnocchi. Mine turned out a little heavy - I'm not sure what I did wrong.

Delicious! Tossed it with fresh parsley, lemon zest, salt, pepper & evoo... my sister (who owns a highly reviewed restaurant) said it was the best gnocchi she's ever had! Of course, she is my sister...

REALLY good and so easy. Light and fluffy, everything a good gnocchi should be. For the cook who asked about freezing, freeze the gnocchi before cooking. You can pop them in the boiling water frozen...no need to defrost.

Okay, I am in the middle of making this recipe and so far, so good but I do have a question: The recipe says it can be prepared two days ahead. At what point do you set it aside? After you cut up the dough or after you boil it? Thanks to anyone who happens to know the answer!

Wonderful! Previously gnocchi challenged, but now, thanks to this recipe - no more. Don't over knead it, cause it will get chewy. Also, have to refrain from cooking it all at once no matter how dire you are from popping these pillows of joy in your mouth!

Fantastic! I have been gnocchi-challenged for many years; every effort has been met with disaster from the gnocchi that dissolved in the cooking water to the ones that were dense, chewy and tasteless. I am happy to report that I can now make them successfully thanks to this recipe. I've made them 3 times and each time produced delicate little pillows of goodness.

Very easy to make and delicious. I'm not sure about the olive oil though, it overpowered the delicate potato flavor. Next batch I'm going to make a light cream sauce and see if that works better.

I love this recipe! This is the first time I made gnocchi from scratch - and it turned out great,and so simple! I do not know why I waited so long to make these little wonders. They tasted just like the homemade gnocchi from my favorite Italian restaurant and I will be sure to make these time and again.

The recipe was straightforward and easy to follow. I'll admit that my first attempt was far from perfect-- a bit too soft, though I was so afraid of having tough gnocchi that I failed to add an adequate amount of flour for structure. Still edible although next time I'll add a bit more flour.

This was my first time to make Gnocchi and it turned out every well! A couple of notes: - As you cook the Gnocchi, change the water every two batches. This keeps the Gnocchi from getting "sticky" - Place a dampened paper towel over the raw Gnocchi while waiting to cook. This will keep them moist. I made a Gorgonzola cream sauce to go with it - Outstanding! Be fearless :)

I think the flavor was good...but perhaps I need some practice making gnocchi. They were far from the light and airy I was expecting, which I assume is my fault.

Success! My wife and I always screw up making gnocchi, even though we love to eat it. This recipe was a snap and the result was great. Maybe not the lightest gnocchi we've ever had.

Amazing! I've never made Gnocci before and I was pretty nervous... this turned out flawlessly. It was so easy and CHEAP. Great for company. Oh, served w/ a Sausage Ragu.

I had never made gnocchi before even though the tradition for making them had been handed down from my Italian grandmother. When I told my mother how this recipe was prepared she told me I was doing everything wrong.....but I have never tasted such light and creamy gnocchi. I will make them this way again and again!
