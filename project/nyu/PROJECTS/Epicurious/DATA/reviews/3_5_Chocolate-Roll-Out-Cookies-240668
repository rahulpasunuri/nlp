These are great cookies, delicious, not too sweet, and hold their shape well. Also added mixed spice and chili powder, yum. I would recommend rolling out thicker than stated here and baking until just barely done (my small 1"x2" cookies came out best at 1/4" thick and baked for 6-7 mins), which results in a beautiful brownie flavour. I found that working in smaller batches, freezing between rolling out and cutting out, dipping cutters in cocoa and cutting out very rapidly made the soft dough more workable.

These are great cookies. I've been making them since I first saw them in Bon Apetit. I like to reduce the flour by two tablespoons, as I find the dough a bit dry otherwise. These have a lovely rich chocolate flavour that is really unexpected in a cut-out type cookie.

These cookies were good. The chocolate flavour wasn't overly strong or sweet. I had to work the dough a fair bit with my hands to make it malleable instead of crumbly. I made pinwheels cookies usin this and mint sugar cookie dough with wonderful results.

I thought these cookies were really good. I have a great sugar cookie and gingerbread cookie recipe for roll out cookies and I was looking for a chocolate one. This one fit the bill perfectly. Like my sugar cookie recipe, it seems a little crumbly but once you get rolling it behaves PERFECTLY.

I baked these with my eight year old granddaughter in heart shapes for Valentine's Day. We had so much fun! I too thought the dough was crumbly when mixed, but we wrapped it in plastic wrap and chilled for about 10 minutes. I was pleasantly surprised how easily it rolled, cut and transferred...even for an 8 year old! We baked them all 12 minutes and let them rest on the cookie sheet a minute or two before removing. These are a nice change from sugar cookies.

Loved this recipe. I dipped them in mint & chocolate chips melted and put heart sprinkles for Valentines Day!

Easy to make, freeze well, delicious on both the early and late ends of the baking time. Sophisticated enough flavor for the adults (with the hint of cinnamon, and especially with citrus icing), but still attractive to the kids. I doubled the chocolate and reduced sugar by 1/3. As mentioned, really great with the citrus icing.

These are amazing. Everyone was impressed with them at Christmas. They bake beautifully (no puffing), are tasty (especially with the cinnamon) and are very easy to roll out and cut. They hold together nicely when baked as well, and look amazingly professional with white frosting.

Awfully difficult to make - not sure if it was the weather or what but had a lot of issue with the cutting.... taste is good, but i was expecting more...

Very good. I made these for Christmas gifts for my family. The icing wasn't perfect. They tasted good, but didn't look as pretty as I'd hoped. Too delicate for me as well.

These were really great cookies. I used them to make a sandwich cookie filled with a rum/coconut filling and then dipped them in chocolate melted with a little butter and they were just wonderful. Definitely my favorite holiday cookies this year!

These cookies are great! This is the first time I am making them, followed the recipe exactly except for only using 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. They will be an annual tradition. I am guessing the people that the 23% that won't make again have not ever made gingerbread dough with a hand mixer (before I got my KitchenAid), stiring in the last two cups of flour with a wooden spoon, before you even get to chill, roll out, decorate and bake. This roll out recipe is a breeze!

These weren't anything special. For the amount of work they were, they didn't have great flavor. I didn't have that much trouble rolling and cutting them. The trick is to put them in the freezer after you roll them out, just for a few minutes. Doing that makes cutting them a lot easier. But I just didn't think they tasted all that great, and I'm a chocolate lover.

i just made this recipe for a cookie decorating party. instead of the chocolate i rolled the cookies out in a mix of hershey's cocoa and powdered suger - the scraps just get chocolatier and chocolatier. i rolled the regular cookies in plain powdered sugar. was very lovely and crispy ( i also substituted 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 regular flour mix for more nutty toothsomeness). they were so good no one wanted to decorate them! overall, i am really really pleased with the crispy sweet and slightly chewy product.

I made these cookies to give as gifts to friends for Christmas. I opted to include the cinnamon in the recipe, and I loved the flavor it added to these cookies.

Excellent cookies! Used semisweet chocolate and made about 1/2 c of the flour whole wheat, and everything worked beautifully, no problems with rolling (didn't chill it beforehand though). Love the flavor, not overly sweet.

I have been looking for a roll out cookie recipe that isn't a sugar cookie or shortbread and this recipe is it. Wow. My boyfriend, who constantly tells me he doesn't like to eat sweet things, ate an entire container of them. I rolled out the dough between two sheets of waxed paper and had no problems whatsoever. The only tricky thing is that the dough takes a while to become soft enough to work with but then very quickly becomes too soft. I found that by rolling out the dough, cutting my shapes and then placing the entire board in the freezer for a few minutes made the whole job very easy and the very cold cookies baked up brilliantly. I will certainly make these again.

These cookies have good flavor - but the chilling process makes the dough crumbly when rolling out. They don't keep their shape while baking. Not worth the effort involved.

Just tasted the first cookie. Oh, yum. The chocolate & cinnamon tastes are not overly strong. They blend well & are different enough you want to keep eating more. I rolled dough out between 2 sheets of parchment then refrigerated. It worked quite well - no problems with sticking. I made a ginger glaze with confectioners sugar, milk & ginger. It had a subtle ginger flavor which blended so well with the chocolate & cinnamon. Great recipe for a change of pace!

I made these for my son's Halloween party and they turned out well. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips for the chocolate and melted them in the microwave. The dough wasn't the easiest to work with. I rolled it out between 2 layers of plastic wrap, because it just stuck to parchment paper. I cut out the shapes then froze the whole thing for 5 minutes or so, and broke the cut outs from the scraps. Doing it this way made things much easier than trying to peel the cookies away from the scrap at room temp. These were a nice break from my usual sugar cookie or ginger snap recipes. I will probably make them again when chocolate seems appropriate.

Made these today. Very tasty. Omitted cinnamon as I was making them for kids and wasn't sure how kids would react to cinnamon in a chocolate cookie. Relatively easy to make. For those of you who said that the dough was difficult to handle, I feel that cookies with a high proportion of butter usually are that way. The trick is to roll out the dough between waxed paper as suggested in this recipe, turning it over every now and then to make sure both the bottom and the top are smooth. Also, you should not attempt to move the cutout cookie dough to the sheet pan right away as the dough by this stage is far too soft. Placing the cut out dough, still on wax paper, on a sheet pan and in the fridge or freezer until the dough is firm will make it easier to move them to sheet pan for baking. Care should be taken when "peeling" the shapes off the wax paper. The easiest way to do this is to fold over a portion of the wax paper so that the cutout dough is on the bottom and gently peel the wax paper off the back of the dough, letting the cut out dough shape fall onto the other hand. Hope this helps.

just a tip, try rolling the dough between waxed paper before you chill it. I made a ginger cream filling and sandwiched it between two of these cookies, chilled them and then dipped the whole in milk chocolate...making a decadent, elegant dessert finish to my veal roast

Great recipe. The dough was perfect. I used Schaefenberger Cocoa and the result was superb. We will make these every holiday season.

Great to work with and the best chocolate rolled cookies I have every had.

Like others have noted, the dough was hard to work. Loved the cinnamon flavor, but overall the cookies lacked flavor. Maybe adding cream cheese to the recipe would add a little depth to the taste. This recipe will not make it to my 2008 xmas cookie list.

The dough was easy to work with, but the end result was a bit tasteless. I'd rather just make a sugar cookie.

Great tasting cookies! Though a bit time consuming, worth the effort. Did exactly as written and had no problem with the dough or the parchment paper (didn't have wax paper to roll it anymore). Will definitely do it again!

Very good recipe. Dough does get super hard in the fridge- make sure to either let it thaw or don't chill it for very long. Love the cinnamon.

I agree with Madison, WI, this dough was difficult to work with. Too stiff when cold, and when it warmed up, way too sticky when a little warmer. Also, using the wax paper was very frustrating, and the dough stuck anyway. I eventually put a little flour on the waxed paper. The dough and cookies were delicious, but not really worth the effort. I am an experienced baker, so I don't think it was all me.

These were really good, but be careful about chilling them for too long. I chilled them overnight and they were rock hard in the morning. It took them 2-3 hours sitting out at room temp before I could even attempt to roll them out. I'm guessing it was the chocolate in them that re-solidified. Also, I found that rolling them out between wax paper was more trouble than it was worth, and used flour on the second batch without any noticeable deleterious effects.

I thought this was a great cut-out recipe. I rolled them out on parchment and removed the dough around then with a pointed knife. This eliminated the tresnfer process and the cookies were perfectly shaped. Would be an easy fun recipe to do with young cooks.
