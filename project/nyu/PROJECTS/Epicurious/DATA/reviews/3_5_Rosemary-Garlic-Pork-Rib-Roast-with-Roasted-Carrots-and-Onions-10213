As others did I added some chicken stock to the bottom of the pan. I also added more garlic and some fresh thyme. I did a mixture of veggies including brocolli, carrots, onions, white and sweet potato. I skipped the bacon but added some olive oil on top of roast and over veggies. I let roast sit and cooked veggies about 10 mins longer. The whole thing took more than 2 hours. Lastly I removed veggies and then made a pan gravy with the drippings. The pork was incredibly juicy and well seasoned. Veggies were also delicious. It was a bit tough to cut the roast and the meat was a bit more chewy than I had hoped but perhaps that is reflective of the particular piece rather than the cooking method. Overall very good and I would certainly make it again.

well, after reading all the reviews I decided to create my own version of this recipe, and let me tell you!!!!! the most amazing pork recipe ever! all the same ingrediants, and adding chopped garlic with my veggies (carrots, onions, potatoes) and placed veg broth to the bottom of the pan. placed the roast on top of the veggies and then coated the roast with EVOO and brown sugar. put the oven to 500 for 20 min to put a nice glaze on the roast then brought it down to 325 to slow roast the rest (cooking to about med rare) mmmmmmmmmmmm delicious!

Very bland and boring. Will not make this again.

great flavours! i think the way the roast is prepared for cooking affects the timing -- my 8-ribber was removed from bone, which was tied underneath and served as a "rack" for the meat. it took longer than the recipe said -- and the vegetables needed more cooking too, to become succulent. like others, i drizzled with olive oil - and threw some of the rose i was drinking on the veg before roasting (1/3 cup?) and at half-time. after the roast came out, veggies still needed a blast for 5 min at 400. lovely dish -- just less "throw it in and forget it" than recipe leads you to think.

One word: Delicious!!! I followed another reviewers suggestion and added chicken broth in lieu of water and tossed in some button mushrooms. Everything tasted great! This is a keeper, for sure!

For those who say it came out dry, or burned, I put mine in an oven bag in the pan. This preserved the juice and came out great. No burning, onions and carrots carmelized and juicy. The flavors are what is important. If you don't like rosemary, you could substitute with any herb. What bugs me about some of the reviews is the "altering" and then judging. If you alter, it is NOT the same recipe and you are not being fair.

First words out of my husband's mouth "This is a KEEPER"!!!!!! I also used chicken broth, and threw some mushrooms in. A different kind of pork dish.

This was outstanding! I have made this roast 4 times in the last year. I have never, ever had a pork roast that was so delicious. We used a 5.5 lb. 7 rib pork roast and cooked it at 325 for about 3 1/2 hours. (I needed to prolong the cooking time so for the last three-quarters of the hour I reduced the temp to 300.) About 1/2 way through the cooking I poured 1/2 cup of red wine over the top. I also added halved red potatoes. I did not get any sauce but that was fine-it was delicous. Because my roast was pre-trimmed I lightly drizzled the top of the roast with olive oil. And, I omitted the bacon. Before placing the roast on top of the vegetables I drizzled them with oil too because other reviewers had talked about burning and sticking to the pan. I place 3 extra sprigs of rosemary on the vegetables before placing the roast on top. This was a delicious, 4-fork, one-pot meal. So good, in fact, we are bringing it(ready to place in the oven) to my in-laws today as a thank you for watching our children tonight! And my DH has forbid me from ever bringing 'regular' pork loin into the house again. For the money (99cent/lb on sale from 3.29/lb) this cut of roast was awesome!

I ALSO ADD CHICKEN BROTH RATHER THAN WATER, THE CARROTS AND ONION CARAMELIZE AND TASTE EXCELLENT.

Good and easy recipe. I used regular onions and carrots. Needed more time to cook than suggested and will cook the bacon a bit next time before tossing with vegetables.

This dish is the best I have ever made. The pork roast was so moist and tender. I had taken advise from other reviewers, and cooked the roast at 30 minutes per pound. However, instead of putting the carrots under the roast, I put them around the raost and immersed them in chicken broth. This turned out excellent, but you have to keep adding broth in order to keep the carrots from burning (I used about 3 cans). I served this with garlic mashed potatoes with bacon bits and chedder cheese on top. Excellent reciepe!

It was delicious but there was NO sauce. Next time I will add at least a cup of water/wine/broth for deglazing. Best part about it was how easy it was for a company dinner.

My guests raved about the meal. I added red potatoes to the carrots and onions and used chicken stock in stead of water. It took a little longer than stated.

The roast was good and the gravy was GREAT...but the veggies were so-so. Not sure why it wasn't wonderful as others reported; I followed the recipe religously. Still, I'll try again just for the gravy (I used chicken stock and red wine to punch it up) and hope the veggies do better with different spicing.

Yummie! As stated in one of the other reviews - a great recipe for a dinner party. The veggies are delicious! You may want to add more carrots - and, used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 red wine in the vegetable mixture. Just keep in mind that the roast takes quite longer to cook than the recipe states.

Always a big hit, especially the veggies that bake with it. Great for a dinner party as it cooks while you enjoy your company until the end. I use a bonless roast and that lowers the cooking time so the veggies aren't overdone.

We cut two ribs from the roast and cooked approx. 4 lbs using directions from recipe. It did take approx 1hr. 30 min. There were no juices, so I added chicken broth (should have put wine into it as well) to loosen veggies. Then reduced broth on range for a demi-glace sauce. Everyone loved it.

The 8 rib roast I bought was over 6 lbs. and had to cook longer, so all the vegetables and the bottom of the pan burnt to a crisp, so we had no sauce or veggies. Bland flavor.

Just made this pork roast for Christmas Eve 2000. Delicious! However, there is no way that this roast is going to cook in 1 hr. 20 minutes - checked Joy of Cooking which calls for 25-35 minutes per pound. Mine was a little over 6 lbs. so after 3 hrs., 170 degrees it was done...

the recipe was wonderful, I'd definately make this again. I added wine at the end to remove my vegetables out of the roast pan instead of water.

Easy and tasty. I made this for my inlaws on a night I was short on time.

The dish was very easy to prepare, and my guests loved it. The small (not baby) carrots were hard to track down, but well worth it. I made an 8 rib (5-1/2 lb) roast, I wished I had more carrots (at least another bunch). DEFINATELY use fresh rosemary! I served garlic mashed potatoes with it, also a hit!

Parboil the cattots and onions before roasting. Also, deglaze the pan containing the vegetables with white wine.
