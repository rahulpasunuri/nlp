This is the third year in a row that I make these burritos with my left over turkey. The sauce compiments the turkey meat, the flavor is wonderful. The cheese adds to the flavor. Do not limit yourself to the cheese suggested. I added gouda. Sour cream would be a great addition to these so would an ice cold Mexican beer.

I made this exactly like the recipe, except I used an extra cup of turkey. I didn't have left over turkey, so I bought turkey breast and cooked it in low sodium chicken broth. While it cooked, I cut it into bit size pieces. This recipe turned out fantastic. I was worried about the amount of cilantro, but it was perfect. I also used the small burritos, which turned this into a 12 serving recipe. I ate 3 of them, so I would say this recipe is plenty for 4 hungry adults/teens.

I made a modified version of this since I didn't have a lot of the ingredients, but the results turned out well. Good idea for leftover Thanksgiving turkey. The cumin added a great flavor. For the curious, I used some spinach artichoke dip in place of the fresh peppers, onions, and cilantro. I knew the dip would be a good addition because of my picky boyfriend who loves the stuff.

I really liked how simple yet flavorful this was...the fire roasted flavor made it tasty. We also had refried beans and sour cream inside the burrito.

I made this recipe twice in one week! It is perfect--exceptionally tasty and nutritious--complete in itself. I added some black beans (a little black bean soup once) and some instant brown rice. I used regular mild salsa, and some green peppers once. It is colorful and has good eye appeal. Do serve it very warm.

deeeeelicious burritos! i made the recipe as is, but i did not have any left over turkey so i used thickly sliced turkey breast from the deli. it worked perfectly. also, to finish the burritos i topped them with avocado, some salsa and more cheese and then put them in the broiler to melt and slightly crisp the tortillas.

This recipe surprised me because it did not taste like it was yet another attempt to deal with leftover turkey. This was quite good. We served it with some of the leftover salsa and a bit of yogourt to freshen things up.

I found the cumin flavor to be too strong despite the fact I used half of what the recipe calls for. These were pretty good, but I think I'd like more "layers" in my burrito; perhaps a big spoonful each of some Mexican style rice and refried beans along with the turkey filling.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it thinking there would be leftovers, but we ate it all except for one serving. Changes I made: I didn't have tortillas and was in a hurry, so I laid out a few (three or four) filo sheets in a 13 x 9 inch pan. I brushed each layer with olive oil. I didn't have fire roasted salsa on hand, but I did have peach mango salsa, so I used that. After cooking all the ingredients except for the filo, I just poured the filling on top, added a layer of the cilantro then topped with the cheese. I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 pepper jack cheese. Baked in the oven until done at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes. Delicious! Will make again.

My daughter and her friends absolutely loved this! The leftover ones I froze. She just got them out and popped them in the microwave after school. That was great for me!

I also made this recipe almost exactly, except I forgot to add the fresh cilantro. The fresh salsa I used had cilantro in it, though. It was excellent, and everyone ate it up. Very simple flavors, and low fat--perfect for post Christmas and Thanksgiving.

What a great change from the usual things done with leftover turkey!!! Made them just the way the recipe stated and everybody loved them.
