I think this is a great recipe. However, I used all of the sauce for about 2/3 of the chicken, etc. Also substituted portobello mushrooms for the shiitake and it was a good switch.

Great amalgamation of flavours. Just needed more sauce - try making more of the soy sauce + sugar + chilli + rice vinegar etc to drizzle over rice. Compliments to the person who put this recipe up :)

just so so...ironically I love all the individual ingredients but when you bring everything together, it seems like something is missing. I even added some 1 tsp minced garlic (from jar) and 1 tbsp of honey. What was it missing? For me it was sweetness, I usually order chinese dishes and other with a bit of sweetness. For my fiance, he would have liked to see/taste broccoli in the dish. If you're planning to make this, which is not a bad idea, feel free to play around with adding ingredients that you particularly like. Not bad but not great would be my review!

Okay at best....would not make again....not too tasty although looked at the reviews after I made the dish and perhaps the sesame oil would make a differnce. It took longer to clean up with all the oil everywhere than it did to actually make it.

Slightly modified this for the better - I think - Instead of vegetable oil - I used sesame oil - which made a huge difference. I wonder how it would work with chili oil? Great dish

Made this for weekday dinner. Nothing special. Dish lacked flavor. If I ever made it again, I would consider adding sesame oil.

I thought it was really good. I don't like mushrooms and the peas didn't sound good so basically I used the sauce and chicken parts of the recipe. I threw in some broccoli and we all really enjoyed it.

Okay, but a bit bland.

We really liked this dish. I added sweet red pepper pieces and shredded carrots to the stir fry and tripled the sesame seeds. I made 1 1/2 the amount of sauce so the hot pepper really came through.

good, basic, easy recipe for when you're in the mood for Chinese; the pepper flakes add an interesting taste despite their small quantity; I used broccoli and water chesnuts

Too sweet. Although I liked the combination of textures (peas, mushrooms and chicken is strange but good), the taste was not so good.

This recipe was just okay. Why call it sesame chicken since it had no sesame flavor.
