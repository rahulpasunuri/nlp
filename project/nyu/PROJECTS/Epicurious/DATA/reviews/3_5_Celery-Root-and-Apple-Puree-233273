So yummy! Added a few potatoes to add a bit more body. Served with roast leg of lamb and root vegetables - delicious - even the fussy kids liked it!

I made this for Thanksgiving, but added chicken stock to make a soup. Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. I would make it again as a puree or as a soup. It was fabulous!

I served this for Christmas dinner with the Crown roast of pork with Onion Stuffing and it was a wonderful side dish. Great and unusual flavor, although it looks a little bland.I am a big fan of do-ahead recipes, and I made this a couple of days ahead and reheated it before serving. Easy recipe and was wonderful.I will make this one again

I was little nervous making this but wanted to follow the menu to go with the Crown Roast of Pork. This was delicious! It goes VERY well with the pork and was not too sweet, as apple side-dishes can sometimes be. Make sure you check the celery root for doneness because it's tough to blend if it is still a little firm.

I made this to accompany a pork tenderloin. My daughter and I thought it was very good. It's a taste that grows on you with each bite. We like the texture very smooth. My husband liked it with the pork, but couldn't see enjoying it with anything else and my son wasn't keen on it.

I made this for easter dinner, with a pork tenderloin roast, and my family loved it. I ended up using gala apples, and used two more than required and it gave the dish a very nice apples sauce flavour. I would definately make this one again.

I don't know what I did wrong. The dish was easy to make, looked beautiful, but tasted bitter. I added more nutmeg and finally resorted to brown sugar, to no avail. Most of it went down the drain, sadly.

Easy to make and great that you can prepare ahead and then reheat at dinner time.Used Macintosh apples, tasted delicious.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was fabulous. Unusual taste; great texture. Not at all sweet. Everyone loved it. Celeriac has got to be the ugliest vegetable I've ever seen but it was worth it!

This puree is fantastic. Great, unusual flavor with a just a sweet hint of apples. This could definitely be used with more meats than pork, as it does not scream "applesauce." The texture is like silk, much better than potatoe texture. Don't add all the cream called for without watching the thickness you want in the end result.

I had no idea what to expect with this recipe, but it sounded interesting so I took a chance. I loved it. Celery root has a smoother, more subtle flavor than celery, and none of the fibrous texture. The recipe calls for a lot of cream (which I used), but I thought it tasted great even before adding the cream.

This was a mild yet rich complement to our pork roast for Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it!
