I rarely review recipes, but I wanted to warn people away from this one! I wish I could give zero forks. It turned out lumpy and weird and underdone. My guests said, "what the heck is this?" The flavors were nice, but the time it took to make this recipe is not worth it at all! Better try Grilled Eggplant Stacks with Tomato and Feta on this same website. Much better!

I used one lasagna dish rather than individual pans and also included garlic in the tomatoe-fennel mixture, which I used in the layers. Used additional baby bella mushrooms too. Very good dish, husband loved it.

Am I the only one who just pureed the tomatoes and fennel to make a sauce? I used 2 T. balsamic vinegar for depth instead of the rice vinegar and added 1/2 cup chopped basil at that point, then assembled it like a traditional lasagna in the tomato/fennel roasting pan. Oh, I also added 2 T. pine nuts and 1 T. chopped garlic when I wilted/sauteed the spinach and upped the cheese to about 16 oz. I think next time, I'll saute the mushrooms, too. Hubby had two servings, plus some for breakfast the next day! (Me, too.)

Skip the single serving notion unless you are someone who enjoys single servings. Though the taste was fantastic, the vinaigrette's consistency was that of thin paste. I was too weirded out to eat lasagna without actual lasagna, so I added two uncooked pasta layers. And doubled the motz. And shaved some parmesean on top. Huh. I think I made a different recipe. It was damn good!

I really enjoyed making this recipe. I thought it was somewhat innovative. I enjoyed stacking the roasted vegetables to create a layered effect. It's very appetizing to the eye. However, I did not think the flavours were robust enough. I would've liked to have tasted stronger flavours. It needs just a little kick of something. Nevertheless, I think is a very good starter recipe, and a good basis to experiment with introducing more robust flavours. I served it at as a starter for a dinner party, and it did go over very well. Will make it again.

Awesome! My hubby raved and could not believe this was vegetarian (he's a big meat eater). I did a couple of substitutions out of necessity. I had fresh shiitakes on hand so I used them instead of the portobellos. I also omitted the vinegar since hubby is not big on it. Finally, I followed the advice from another reviewer and made it in a big lasagne pan (rather than individual dishes). The result was delicious (even better the next day!)

This was the best meatless lasagna dish I have ever had! Although it's a bit tedious, it's healthy and definately worth your while! I did use regular eggplant. And I put the full recipe in an 11x7 glass dish rather than the individual dishes and it worked perfectly. Also, rather than jarred red peppers, I roasted some regular red peppers along with the mushrooms and eggplant. Next time I will add a little garlic to the tomato/fennel sauce. Delicious!

Excellent! I made this for a dinner party that included two vegans. They raved about it and said it was the best vegan dish they have ever had. Worth the effort!

The product was delicious, but I was confused during the process. First, "japanese eggplants" -- I thought they were the white eggplants, but ended up using what seemed at the end to be the correct vegetable -- long thin light purple eggplants labelled "chinese eggplants" at my grocer. Also the baked portobellos dried out too much for my taste, next time I will bake covered to retain moisture.

This was an impressive and light first course. The sauce was delightful and my guests really enjoyed it.

I made this dish many times with soy cheese for a vegan and it is very good. I don't bother to strain the tomato and fennel mixture but eat it solid. It's a good spread on toast as well.

Complicated and timeconsuming to make, but our gourmet group raved about it. I checked the plates and each terrine was gone. Robust flavor. We made it without cheese, and to give it more moisture, instead of discarding all of the fennel & tomatoe mash, we used a layer of that in the terrines; also, poured a little of the fennel tomatoe juices over it before cooking.
