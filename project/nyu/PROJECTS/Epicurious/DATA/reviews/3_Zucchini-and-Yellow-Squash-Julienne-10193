Beautiful dish but very bland, even with extra onion and plenty of fresh dill. I used all yellow squash and a mix of red and orange peppers. Next time I'll try garlic.

We were looking for something w/ julienne vegetables for the look and simple flavor to go with a plated salmon dinner. We trialed this and thought it was a little bland. We made these changes and served it with friends. Everyone liked this version. We used sweet onion julienned instead of scallions. We sauteed them first and then added the other vegetables. We julienned the red pepper. We thought that looked better. We added salt & pepper to taste.

Boring, and not worth the work. A classy looking side dish.

I thought this recipe was OK but everyone else LOVED it. Not sure why as it seemed pretty typical. Good easy way to get your veggies in.

I had alot of strong flavors going on in my menu already so some simple beautiful veggies was just what I needed to round it out. I know I will make this again and again.

This is an easy and great accompanient to many dishes. It adds color and a medley of flavors. Plus you can prep the veggies ahead.

Simple dish that provides excellent color and presentation to the plate. To add a different taste, I steamed the vegetables first almost all the way through and then briefly sauteed them in a small amount of butter and tarragon for a delicious addition.

I would make this again, but I would probably add some garlic. The vegetables are a great combonation, but need a little more zip. I might even change to a sweet onion versus the green onion.

My guests enjoyed this dish, and the end product was tasty. I did the chopping the night before to cut down on preparation time.

I'd really like to rate this 2.5 forks. It's a fast, easy and good tasting vegetable dish with lots of color.

Unremarkable. I thought the end product wasn't worth all that slicing. There are more exciting things to do with these vegetables.
