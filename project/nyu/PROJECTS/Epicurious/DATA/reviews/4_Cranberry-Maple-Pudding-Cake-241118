easy and delicious. I made as directed and had good results. I expected it to be a little gooey-er on the bottom, but nonetheless, love the tang of the cranberries with the cakey top. Yum.

I was pleasantly surprised with the cranberry and maple combination. Made a half receipe which worked fine, although my pan was perhaps too big as I did not get a very pudding-y effect. I like cornmeal, but found it a bit too granual. Nice for a change, but probably wouldn't try again.

What a disappointment, and a heinous waste of maple syrup. Followed the recipe although used more cranberries as rec'd here, and it is just a disgusting blob of cornbread over a pile of cranberries. Don't bother with this one, there are so many actual delicious desserts out there!

Basically made the recipe as directed except, based on other reviews here, I increased the cranberries to 3 cups and increased the orange zest to 1 1/4 teaspoons. Oh, and because I had a little extra zest left that I didn't want to waste, I put about a 1/2 teaspoon into the batter. Result was very good and tasted even better the next day after the flavors married. Will make again.

Made once without any changes to recipe and again with more cranberries. The cake bakes beautifully even though the batter may not have been poured evenly over the berries. When serving, I tried to turn the spoonful of cake and topping so as to have the cranberries on top. Sauce forms only about 1/8 of the dessert so I would in future, double up on but this can be costly with 2 c. maple syrup. Whipping cream was preferred to creme fraiche.

Made it exactly as directed except I doubled the recipe and baked it in a big, ceramic lasagna pan. It came out perfectly. It's not a beautiful show-stopper dessert. But it's perfect for a cozy Christmas Eve with family.

This dessert is very tasty. Not too sweet, the maple syrup adds a beautiful undertone flavour. The cornbread topping is quite light. I preceded it with a tenderloin roast of beef, fiddleheads and stuffed portobellos. I would prefer more cranberries so the next time I will add at least an extra cup. This dessert was very easy to make, and would be great when having having your afternoon pick-me-up cup of tea. It is on the "Keeper" list

Love this! I prefer creme fraiche (vs. whipped cream or ice cream) because it cuts the tartness of the cranberries and the "sweet" isn't overpowering.

Perfect for Christmas day. The mellowness of the maple syrup complements the tart cranberries. I was worried about the consistency of the cranberry mixture (too thin?) but the cornbread/cake rose to the top as it cooked and all was well. Delicious.

This dish is absolutely wonderful! For those who find it bitter, I would have to ask if they like cranberries and did they add a fat as outlined in the recipe? The dish would be tart if you don't add a fat to it but if made as the recipe is written, I can attest that the creaminess of the Crème Fraîche counteracts the tartness. I have substituted sour cream or whipping cream in place of the Crème Fraîche but find that it is best topped with Crème Fraîche. I have served this both for breakfast and for dessert to rave reviews. Even my 9-year old boy (the carbivore) ate it last time I made if for dessert. Give it a try!

I followed this recipe to the letter (except that I doubled it; there are never enough desserts in my house). We LOVED it. There was absolutely nothing bitter or too sweet about it. It was perfect. And by the way, in New Zealand, "real" maple syrup costs about $40 a quart (yes, you read that right, it's imported from Canada), so since I doubled the recipe it used about $20 worth! And I'd still make it again!

Based on the early recommendation to add a bit more sugar to the cake topping, I did and it was lovely, no bitter taste at all, though I don't think it required another whole TB of sugar because the cranberry/maple mixture was extremely sweet. I'll be cutting back on the maple syrup a bit next time. I loved the texture and used plain creme fraiche as a topping. It was luscious. So homey and easy.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I noticed lots of comments about bitterness. Cornmeal that has gone bad can cause a very unpleasant bitter taste. Make sure your cornmeal is fresh. Stone ground cornmeal is more perishable then steel ground because it contains the whole kernel.

Lukewarm reception to this recipe. The cornmeal flavor was unpleasant and did not seem to blend with the other flavors. I will not make again.

Easy to make and absolutely delicious. The maple flavor worked very well with the cranberries. The only thing I would change is use more cranberries.

I made this recipe gluten free using BH's featherlite flour mix. Added 1/2t xantham. 28 mins a bit too long, but still wonderful! Everyone loved it and noone knew it was GF.

Very very tasty and super easy (so easy I made it by candlelight as our electricity was out)! My partner and I are not great cranberry lovers, and we both had two servings. The cornmeal in the cake was great with all the other flavors. I added the extra Tbls of sugar to the cake, also added 10 oz of frozen sliced peaches to the cranberry mixture and it was divine! I plan to try it with blueberries.

This is fantastic. I followed the recipe just as it was written. If there is concern about the cornbread crust being too bitter, use the whipped cream. A great winter dessert and breakfast!

I loved this! I tried it with blue cornmeal and 1/3 cup of maple sugar. It is so simple and easy to put together. Serving warm is key, next time I will try it with yellow cornmeal and use more cranberries.

Used two entire bags of cranberries so more than called for, yet a perfect amount. The sauce, which didn't reduce in the saucepan, ended up the right amount when it soaked into the cake topping. Be sure to eat a bite of berry with the sauce. They really compliment each other. Good thing i froze extra bags of berries this winter.

This is delicious! I've made it twice, followed the recipe to the "T" both times. There was ZERO bitter taste in the cake (are people really adding sugar to the cake portion of the recipe BEFORE trying it???) The maple syrup was delicious and I didn't reduce the amount second time making it (maybe it's my Canuck-blood?).

This is good! And easy! I made it for a small group of friends and all loved it. I think the recipe is fairly forgiving too, so you can play around with the sweetness/cranberries/syrup, so it meets your preferences. Good leftover for breakfast too.

Everyone loved this, a perfect dessert for a turkey dinner! I actually didn't quite have enough maple syrup on hand, so it didn't seem too sweet. I was suprised at how good the maple tasted with the cranberries. Yummy with real whipped cream.

followed some of the earlier suggestions-- replaced 1/3 c flour with 1/3 c ground almonds. slight increase in cranberries slight decrease in syrup. (also replaced orange rind for lemon rind.) My family LOVED it e(even without the whipped cream). The five of us finised it off in about 15 minutes.

This was delicious, BUT too sweet for my taste. I will definitely make it again, but will reduce the maple syrup and add more cranberries.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe. I did some minor replacements...but this recipe is fabulous!!! I used organic blue corn meal and used 1/3 cup of organic flour & 1/3 cup of almond meal & luckily fresh organic cranberries are readily available! This is a winner with the not too sweet crowd, when served from the bottom. If an unknowing person only takes the cake from the top...it is not exciting. I cooked it in 2 bowls to make it. My roommate tried to make it in MA using a rectangular dish and was disappointed. By using bowls the pudding didn't spread out. the way it is served is imperative.

This recipe was a hit for both a party on the Eve and for Christmas morning breakfast. Thought it would not make enough cake batter (hard to cover the pan) but it spread perfectly when cooking. Yummy!

This was delicious and I didn't find the topping bitter at all. I thought there was too much maple syrup though -- next time I would reduce it to 3/4 cup, and use 2 1/2 cups cranberries and maybe a bit more cake topping.

I followed the recipe exactly although I doubled the ingredients. The bitter, metallic tasting topping was quite unpleasant. I would not make this again.

This pudding cake is rally delicious; the mixture of maple syrup and cream is wonderful. It is delicious for breakfast, and it would make a great dessert. I added a tablespoon of sugar to the batter, as was suggested, and it was just perfect. The addition of corn meal gives the cake a nice texture. I will certainly make it again.

This was pretty good... the cornmeal topping was a bit bitter, but the whipped cream saved it.
