We have made this at least a half a dozen times. Terrific recipe! We have made it exactly as indicated and on occassion we have made some tiny modifications. We increased the amount of vinegar by a few tablespoons (once using sherry vinegar, delicious!. We also added 1/4 dry white wine. We will continue to make this.

This recipe was simple to prepare and very tasty. I served it with Greek salad and garlic mashed potatoes. My fiance loved it!

I used chicken breast slices and chicken broth. The recipe was just OK. The vinegar flavor barely came through and the sauce was oily. Perhaps cutting back on the oil to 2 tbsp would help, but I won't be the one to find out!

I made this recipe just as written. It was wonderful! Second time I made it I used boneless chicken breasts (pounded a bit) and chicken broth. It was just as good!

Very simple recipe with excellent results. I thought it didn't worked because when I first cooked the veal the flour didn't stick to the meat, however, my husband thought that it was really good, even days after I made it he was mentioning how much he liked it.
