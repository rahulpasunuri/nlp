Didn't have any cilantro, and my proportions were a bit off (used 3 cups of squash, only about a cup of peppers), but still thought this was very tasty. Took hints from some of the other reviewers and added a bit of chopped green onion and some cumin, chili powder, and coriander. Would make this again.

Made for Thanksgiving. Butternut squash, chives and bell peppers saved from my garden. Had never used Butternut squash and was struggling with it, so I popped it in the microwave for 5 minutes which made cutting it up very easy. No cilantro, so I took advise and used the old bay and brown sugar. Lovely warm fall harvest dish for the holiday.

This was my first time trying hominy, and it turned out amazing! However I made a few alterations. I didn't have frozen corn so I just left that out, and instead of cilantro I seasoned with brown sugar and old bay, yum!! This is also a great combo for popcorn. I also added onions the mix.

Mhmhmh - Deelicious! I added a bunch of chpped green onion and some pasta seasoning ( just to get the herbal scent) so so good - definitely going on my list of repeat sides. So quick and easy too.Thanks for sharing!

I didn't really follow the recipe instructions so maybe it was my fault, but my husband & I found this rather bland. I mixed all the vegetables together with the melted butter and cilantro, added shredded Monterey Jack cheese, salt and pepper and baked it. It was really pretty, but just bland. If I were to make this again I would maybe use roasted green chiles intead of green pepper.

A classic, lending itself to flexible combinations. Mixed in some Ancho red peppers for heat. Very well received!!

I substitued homemade polenta for hominy. Came out great. I also added some fresh chives and a little zucchini. I don't like green pepper so the chives and zucchini added a little green.

I didn't have hominy on hand, so left it out. I added on clove of chooped garlic and instead of cilantro, I sprinkled the mix with chili powder, cumin and corriander. Yum....corn and squash are made for each other.

Mild yet rich in flavor; great with roasted fowl.

I added some of the liquid from the hominy, and a bunch of chopped scallions. This was a wonderfully flavorful vegetarian dish that I will definitely make again.
