Pretty good, although none of us could remember if we tasted any garlic. They cooked beautifully on the grill. I mixed white and green asparagus which made for an elegant presentation.

Grilled asparagus is fantastic. I use olive oil and sprinkle the spears with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper before grilling. This beats steamed asparagus any day!

I like to use chopped garlic, and instead of the garlic oil, I use toasted sesame oil. After it comes off the grill, I toss it with roasted sesame seeds. It works very well with Japanese-style grilled beef. Asparagus can be threatening to cook over the stove (you have to get the water *this* high, and cook the tips *this* long, etc.), but on the grill, it's sooooo easy.

I do this recipe all the time. Instead of salt and pepper I use a little lemon peper seasoning for an extra level of flavour.

This is simple and a classic. It's perfect every time, not to mention easy!

Bottled Italian dressing mix with a bit of water works great to.

I've always just used olive oil so the roasted garlic is a nice touch. I also like to sprinkle coarse salt over the spears before cooking.

Velveeta? I can understand the wine part, but never Velveeta.

A nice preparation that needs more zing. I like to serve the spears with melted Velveeta and maybe a splash of wine, perhaps Franzia?!
