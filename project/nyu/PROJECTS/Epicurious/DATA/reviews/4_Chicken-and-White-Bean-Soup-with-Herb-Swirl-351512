Followed the recipe other than substituting a small jar of tomatoes from the garden for the tomato puree. Soup was OK but lacked any WOW factor. Thought the herb oil would save it but again, was just "OK".

Yummy Yummy Yummy. I love this soup. The only thing I did different is I added mushrooms. The Swirl is awesome. Thanks for posting

Home run! Simple as that. This is easy to make and simply delicious. I pureed tomatoes and white beans together, with a bit more tomato(8oz.) The oil is a lovely exploration...by all means, use fresh herbs. I liked the consistency from having the pureed beans , tomatoes, 1 32 oz container of quality chicken stock. Next time I'll reserve some whole beans to add.Make sure to saute the veggies a good while for best flavor. Serve with longitudinally quartered french pread, so as to have a "dipping stick."

Delicious, and worth the wait. I will definitely make this again. The only change I made was to use a whole 10-oz can of tomato puree.

Wonderful! My fiancée LOVES soup and he said this is one of the best he's ever had! I used stewed tomatoes instead of puree for a lighter effect and thigh meat instead of breast for more flavor, delicious. And YES - do the herb swirl!! I don't recall ever having anything like it but it's to die for. Love love love.

This was delicious, especially considering that it's healthy. Thanks for posting! I followed the recipe exactly, and was impressed by how much flavor the herb swirl added. I will definitely be making this again.

Made this for the second time last night...it is really good. First time did not do the herb swirl but did that last night. You must do the swirl!! It gives it an earthy herb aroma that is delightful. That got raves from all six in the family from 9 to 70 years old.

excellent with two modifications: for the white beans, i used the epicurious recipe http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cannellini-Beans-with-Garlic-and-Sage-355216 (reduced the recipe to 100 grams and used big white beans: favas asturianas) and used both the beans and the bean broth in combination with my homemade chicken broth. since i had just made the chicken broth, i picked the meat off the kilo of chicken parts i had used and used that in the soup instead of the chicken breast in the recipe. i think it may be even more flavorful that way from having absorbed the flavors of the slow-cooked broth. rave reviews from boyfriend. will be enjoying more tomorrow!

This was a very easy, flavorful soup. The herb oil was a unique and delicious way to add flavoring to the soup, too! Quite impressive, tasty winter soup. I will definitely make this again!!

We are big soup-eaters and loved this! It's an especially easy way to use leftover roast chicken. I've followed the recipe exactly both times with delicious results, but may try adding some chopped kale at the very end next time. Also added a dash of Tobasco into my bowl!

This is fab. I don't generally like making soup, because the effort involved often doesn't equate with the end result. Not in this case. The herb swirl really brings all the flavors together. I made my own tomato puree which didn't really add to the prep time. And I delivered a big bowl to a friend of mine who had a terrible cold, and she loved it!

I followed this recipe exactly - even made homemade beans instead of using canned - but still, it was only so-so. For some reason it smelled a bit like cabbage (maybe it was the beans?). I was not crazy about the herb mix - I think this soup could be greatly improved by using an Italian herb mix of basil, oregano, etc.

I made this soup a couple of days ago and froze it in individual bowls for my lunch. It is very tasty and I agree with the other cooks that the herb swirl really makes it. I poached the chicken in the liquid before adding the beans and then diced it up sine I prefer that texture. I didn't add all the tomato puree because the soup was so delicious before that step. Next time I might omit the puree all together. It freezes and reheats very well.

I do not know what other reviewers are talking about when they mention "bland chicken." I have made this soup twice exactly as the recipe says, and each time the flavor has been exceptional.

Good but not great. Made recipe as written. Chicken was bland.

Fantastic! I did not have enough chicken so I also used some duck breast - it added a wonderful savory flavour! Also since i was making this as a take to work lunch I mixed the herb oil right in after the soup was off the heat. Considering how simple this was I was blown away with the results.

This is delicious and quick and easy to make. The quantities made enough for leftovers, and the flavor developed even more overnight. My family has already requested that I make this again.

Disappointing flavor - especially the tasteless chicken. It sounded so good! The only redeeming factor is the fresh herb oil. Without that, it would have had one star. I have used the herb oil with other dishes, as it is wonderful.

This soup is absolutely delicious. I made it as written (except didn't have enough cannellini beans on hand so had to substitute a can of red kidney beans - which turned out fine). The herb swirl really complements the soup. Also made the Parmesan Toasts which were truly amazing. My children (ages 12 and 9) really like both the soup and the Parmesan toasts. I also made the cream cheese cupcakes (which were a lot of work and not very good). Make this soup if you want a new twist on chicken soup...flavors were out of this world!!!

We really liked this recipe. Actually, we thought the herb swirl was the best part and made it stand out from other similar recipes. I would definitely recommend trying it with the fresh herbs.

Skipped the herb swirl. Fast to make & tasted great - like a soup that had to cook for hours.

This is a really good soup! We used homemade chicken stock and threw in some dried herbs instead of making the herb oil, and it was great. Perfect for cold weather.

This was really good. The only changes I made was that I increased the serving size by 50% I think I made the chicken chunks too large - maybe a half an inch chunk would be better. I served w/ multigrain bread boule slices w/ a smear of smart balanc. We will be eating leftovers tomorrow. 11 month old ate it strained and diced. Loved it!

As with most things I cook, it ends up with only a passing resemblance to the original, so will not rate it. I used lentils and green peas instead of the white beans. Added some garlic, white pepper and ham to the process as the flavor did seem to be lacking as I was tasting it during cooking. In the end I also added some cauliflower that I'd previously roasted with cumin and coriander and that seemed to get it where I wanted it.

Wonderful...easy to prepare ahead of time. It tends to thicken if not eaten immediately, so add a little more chicken broth when reheating.

Followed the directions pretty closely but I did not have fresh herbs. It was still great and smelled wonderful while cooking. Also, my daughter is a big fan of Garbanzo beans so we substituted that as well. Also I had a bit of marinara left over from a few nights ago and used that instead of the tomato puree. It was sooooo good we will make it again when my son comes home from college for spring break.

I was impressed with the ease of this soup. We enjoyed the taste before adding the herb oil but the oil enhanced the flavor.I also left the chicken in. Yeah we could freeze pesto in chicken stock but what's the fun in that!

Does anyone have a freezer. Just use chicken stock do pesto and freeze in the cubes add lavender, mint etc THIS IS NO ONES CHIK SOUP. DO your own

Used a small amount of Tasso and about 1 Tbsp. of minced garlic when I sauted the vegetables. Did not remove the chicken. Very tasty!!!

To maximize flavor and make it even heartier, rather than adding bacon, add a smoked ham hock/neck bone.

I followed all the directions, except had to use dried parsley rather than fresh. This was very good and the herb oil definitely made the dish.

This was a nice soup and I did like other people and did not remove the chicken. I also thought it needed a bit more flavour so added bacon and some balsamic vinegar. I would make again

Easy, yummy and relatively healthy. I could see adding more veggies and maybe a couple handfuls of spinach to boost the nutritional value, but it was great as is. Do the herb oil...I was surprised at how much flavor it added.

Very easy to make and delicious! Definitely needs the herb oil- don't skimp on that. I misread and didn't have tomato puree- I substituted 1/3 c. tomato paste. Next time I'll try a whole roasted picked chicken.

This simple yet delicious soup was exceptionally pleasing. Like the other cooks, I let this simmer a bit longer to thicken up. I almost always add a parmesan rind during the simmering process which gives any soup a superior richness in flavor. I did not make the fresh herb oil but added dried herbs instead and drizzled with olive oil at the end. Will make again.

Very nice recipe for a family dinner. I cooked everything longer and threw the beans in at the end. I also, like Cook from Brooklyn, put the chicken back in and simmered for a while to tenderize it a bit. Put the beans in for the last 5 minutes so they did not get mushy. The herb swirl was essential for added flavor. Would definitely make again.

I gave this three forks as written, but I made a couple changes that really helped- I skipped the celery and added some frozen green beans, they gave the soup nice texture and color. Also I didn't bother with taking the chicken out, etc- I threw the cubes in along with the onion and carrot and let everything cook together. Took a couple minutes longer but made the whole process simpler. The garlic toasts went perfectly with this, too!
