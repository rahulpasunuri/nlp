Yum!! Perfect balance of oil, butter, garlic. Only problem was not eating them all before I got them on the salad!

Made these for a spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. they were great, and others liked them much better than the store made version (they were much fresher).

I've made this twice and the family enjoyed it both times. I made sure the bread soaked up all the butter mixture before baking and the second time i added some grated Parmesan as well.
