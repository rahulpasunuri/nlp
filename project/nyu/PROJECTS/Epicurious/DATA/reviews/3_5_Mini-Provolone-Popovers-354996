These were really yummy even with a few changes: I used Pam instead of butter, asiago instead of parmesan, and thyme instead of chives. I also didn't have a mini muffin tin. The mini-muffin pan would have worked better, but these turned out great. Next time, I think I would add some shredded prosciutto to the batter.

Have to serve them right away otherwise they would fall (they are like mini souffle) But the flavour is great!

So good and so easy. I didn't have time to let the batter rest one hour so I put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes and they turned out great.

Our friends shared this recipe with us...real yum! Added cambozola and shaved parm flakes...delish!

Made this for my inlaws' visit and it was a huge hit. I was skeptical about how they would rise because of a lack of rising agent, but it must be the combination of the chilling, the pre-heated tin and baking on the top rack. I didn't have chives, so I left them out. Next time, I will try with a sharper cheese. The provolone didn't really come through as much as I had hoped. Also, reheat leftovers. They taste gross cold or at room temp.

I made this tonight and served them with the Chicken in Riesling and they were a huge hit. The were all eaten quickly while they were hot. I added about a tablespoon extra of provolone to the mix and chilled the mix for several hours (made it ahead to help on prep work). I think I might cut out the extra butter at the bottom of the pan and spray it with olive oil. Will definitely make again!!!

I changed this recipe, just a little. Added Shallots, not chives, and parsley for color.. came out wonderful! Big hit.. The shallots added the missing flavor.. also added 1 more tbsp of parmesan cheese.

These were a hit at our dinner party! They were very easy to make. I doubled the recipe and it made almost 3 batches. "I can't stop eating them!" was what I heard over and over again, until there were none left :)

Disappointing. Very bland. I won't bother making this recipe again.

no need to PREHEAT the silicon muffins pans

no need to preview the silicon muffin pans, that is just for the non-silicon pans.

Not made yet, but a question. If I use silicon mini muffin pan, should I still heat it? That doesn't sound right. Sounds good and I want to try it in my toaster oven! Where I live, it's still too hot to turn on the big oven.

Better yet, make French Gougeres. apcCapeCod

Delicious! Tasted great and had a light, fluffy texture! Did spray the pan with pam instead of using butter and used 1% milk rather than whole and they came out great.

They tasted a little too much like flour to me and I do suggest spraying the pan with Pam instead of buttering the pan.

My son (he is a huge cheese and bread guy) and I made these last week and they were a huge hit!!! We substituted 1% milk and used a silicon muffin pan with a little bit of Pam sprayed over it. The popovers puffed up, browned, and were delicious.

No rating because I haven't made this particular recipe but a couple of tips. Chill the batter for sure. Heat the muffin pan, spray with Pam or Baker's Joy (skip the butter in the bottom) and return to oven immediately. I make the parmesan green onion popovers (also on this site) that way and they turn out perfectly. (Many, many other reviewers had trouble with that particular recipe.) I'll try this one too for variety.

These were good, but not as good as brazilian cheesy bread made in muffin tins (which is made with tapioca flour and hence extra stickey--you can find a recipe via google).

added some garlic powder, about 1/2 teaspoon, and a little baking powder, then 1/2 way through cooking, I sprinkled some cheese and some extra chives on top. Loved it!

I used a sharp aged provolone with this receipe that I think really made the difference. Served with some fresh, ripe South Carolina peaches for brunch with peach mimosas. Great end of summer recipe!

Didn't have chives or a cupcake pan (poor college student), so instead I made this as a "loaf", and substituted the chives for dried rosemary. I turned out well. However, I was expecting more of a burst of cheese. I suggest to add more Parmesan and Provolone to the mix or have it added to the top, and let it melt over and crust the bread.
