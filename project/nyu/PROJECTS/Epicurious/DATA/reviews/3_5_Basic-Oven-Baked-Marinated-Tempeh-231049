Great way to cook tempeh. I definitely agree with the previous reviewer who suggested slicing it thinly. I used most of the additional seasonings and the tempeh tasted excellent, but very mild - even after marinating for 2 hours.

Loved this. Have made tempeh a couple times before and this is my favourite recipe so far. On this occasion I had put 1/3 of my 12 ounce tempeh cake into the trifecta burger (also on this site), and luckily enough what I had left fit this recipe exactly. I used all the additional seasonings (used the last of my coriander--which I grind myself) and specifically bought toasted sesame oil for this (so I was really banking on the end-result being good!) and also used home-made hotsauce. Used cider vinegar and substituted Braggs for the tamari. Also substituted Worcestershire sauce for the pickapeppa (this was a suggestion I found by doing a little online searching). Note: Worcestershire sauce is not vegetarian (I think it contains anchovies). Also, I have to reply to the person who mentioned that honey is not vegan: It's an optional ingredient, so if you want vegan, don't use it. Oh, I also marinated it for about a day and a half. The end result did not disappoint. I love the fact that this recipe has so much room for variation, so it can be adjusted to what you have on hand and dietary restrictions.

I love that this gives you a base to start with, and after reading reviews, you get a few more ideas. I used: black pepper, fresh ginger, fresh garlic, ground coriander, Japanese mirin, rice vinegar and \Bragg Liquid Aminos. Oh, and just a touch of Sriracha. It is delicious. I only gave it 3 forks because it did not tell me exactly what to use, but like I said, gave me a good base to start from.

I appreciate a great basic recipe to add to my repertoire. I chose soy, vinegar, garlic, coriander, and ginger for the marinade. Then I coated the tempeh pieces in panko before baking. (This not only added nice texture but enabled me to promote it as a "home-made nugget" to the young 'uns in my family.) Everybody enjoyed it.

I made it with soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, coriander, seasame oil, ketchup, and water. It was very tasty on a sandwich with avocado and hummus and it was also good plain dipped in ketchup. I only gave it 3 stars because it's not going to impress anyone. It's just a solid, good recipe.

Trying to break free of my tofu addiction I turned to tempeh tonight for dinner tonight and made this with soy sauce, rice vinegar and honey. Blech. Maybe I'm just a tofu girl and not a tempeh lover, but I did not like this at all.

I like the taste and texture of tempeh, but was nervous about serving it to my boyfriend. I followed this recipe and marinated in tamari and rice vinegar for 20 minutes, then baked. I was wowed by the texture! This was the best tempeh can get, far better than the steaming and stir frying I've tried before. I used the tempeh in a stir fry with scallions and peanuts, but it would have been fabulous in any dish!

This got high marks from a meat-eater I shared it with. I added generous amounts of ketchup and garlic powder to the basic recipe. The only thing I would add is to slice the tempeh nice and thin so that the marinade can soak through. I've already made it a second time.

Just a note: This recipe is under "Vegan" dietary considerations, yet one of the additions is honey. Please note that honey is not vegan, as it is derived from honeybees which are very much an animal.

This is a recipe I will use often. I used apple cider vinegar, tamari, black pepper, and coriander. I serve slices on my salad for lunch. This stuff is great. Very satisfying, full of protein, not greasy.

This was a great recipe. I chose to use garlic, fresh ginger and black pepper as my additional ingredients. I cut the tempeh into cubes, marinated for about 40 minutes, cooked as directed and served on top of pasta. The tempeh soaks up the marinade nicely. Very delicious.

I used ketchup as the additional ingredient, and the resulting dish was tender and tangy. This is a solid recipe that I will make again.
