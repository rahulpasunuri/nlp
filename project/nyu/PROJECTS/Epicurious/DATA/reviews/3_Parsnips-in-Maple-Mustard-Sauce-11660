Well, this is not quite a review - I ended up not following much of the recipe. Here is what I did. Put all ingredients, except parsnips, into a skillet over lowest heat. Melted and blended everything together. Oops, no Dijon or stone-ground mustard, so I used 1/4 tsp of yellow instead. Cut the parsnips as directed, placed them with one of their cut sides down in the melting sauce, covered the pan and left it lightly bubbling along for about 6 minutes. The parsnips were softened a bit and still slightly crunchy. I love the taste of plain parsnips, so I just served them as a slightly flavored veggie. I did use the leftover sauce, though, to freshen up a leftover yam for dessert. The heated up yam, the sauce and a tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum. The parsnip flavor in the buttery sauce was nice, too.

Don't feel compelled to use Dijon mustard: I didn't have any, and used instead a whole-grain mustard. Reading comments that cooks found this recipe too sweet, I doubled the mustard and used less maple syrup. (Of course, it is quite easy to taste before you cook, and adjust the flavors to your own preference.) The parsnips themselves are naturally sweet, and with mustard and kosher flake salt (after they were cooked), they were perfect. We loved this dish.

I made this recipe according to the instructions, with no variations and enjoyed it very much. It turned out to be very sweet. Next time I might adjust the amount of dijon in the mix to make it less sweet. I think this recipe would also work if you substituted carrots for the parsnips, which is how I'm going to try it next time.

fixed first time according to recipe..turned out a little runny on the sauce. I ended up adding a little brown sugar. Next time I will cook sauce seperately for a thicker sauce.

Wife not partial to parsnips, but she loved this recipe. Cooked in glass bowl in microwave, covered with plate (which allows some steam to escape & uses no non-recyclable materials). My timing wasn't perfect, but just before serving, punched the Minute Plus button & they were piping hot. We both gobbled 'em up!

I've made this several times; the sweetness makes it a perfect accompaniment to pork or ham. Although it's a little more work, I actually prefer to steam the parsnips (the sweeter thin ones only take a few minutes) and make the sauce sauce separately in a skillet, thickening it, then adding the parsnips. The only thing to remember is that, as with any recipe, you have to use REAL maple syrup (not the stuff in the maid-shaped bottle) and a decent dijon mustard. Substitutes just won't cut it.

I have to disagree with the other reviewer... I thought it was delicious and so did the rest of my family. It's definitely a strong taste that you either like... or don't! It's very easy! My only suggestion is to try to use thin parsnips because the thick ones are too tough and not as sweet.

One word for this recipe - Nasty. The maple and mustard is not a good combination of flavours in my opinion.
