I needed a dish to take to a party, so I cooked the sauce down to a spreadable consistency, spread it on slices of French bread, and decorated with basil slivers. Very good.

I made this as written and used chicken stock instead of water. It required longer to reduce to a nice consistency. Delicious with good quality Parmesan and a nice glass of white wine.

With a few small alterations, this is a really tasty dish - and fast. I skipped reconstituting dried tomatoes and use oil-packed ones, which eliminates a step and improves flavor. I replaced the spray with 3 T of olive oil and sauteed the vegetables until onions were translucent before adding 3/4 C. sherry plus 1/4 C. water. I stirred in the sliced tomatoes with the basil and pine nuts, just before tossing with the pasta. I left the parmesan as a garnish. Don't give up on this dish because of the bad reviews! It's a keeper, especially if you're making dinner for vegetarians.

I also made some alterations and it turned out great. I started by sauteeing sliced roasted garlic chicken sausage in olive oil. Then removed it from the skillet and sauteed the onions, garlic for a minute or two. Then I added the mushrooms and sundried tomatoes and sauteed for another minute or two. Then I added the wine and tomatoe liquid. During the last few minutes of cooking I added a fresh sprig of oregano, a few dashes of crushed red pepper, the dried basil and the chicken sausage back to the skillet. Don't forget to season with salt and pepper.

I could tell by the recipe that the dish would be bland without alteration. I added constituted porcini mushrooms and used baby portabellas instead of button mushrooms. I also used an imported asiago instead of parmesean and prepared basil pesto instead of fresh or dried basil. Next time I make it I would use linguine instead of penne and chicken broth instead of water. The garlic could be increased. I also think it would be a good idea to saute the garlic and onion in olive oil. This was a good learning experience for me on how to throw together a nice pantry pasta dish.

I don't know why I ignored the bad reviews of this, when I always pay attention to good reviews. I guess I thought I could make it good. Anyway, I should have trusted the other reviewers as everything they said is right. Too much going on, flavors don't complement each other. Blah.

Just made this and what a waste of money on the ingredients. If I had this at a restaurant, I would send it back. Threw the leftovers out. Would not make even with the suggested substitutions. Watery, bland, dull flavour.

I was very disappointed as this was the only recipe I could locate on Epicurious.com using "sun-dried tomatoes" as my search words. My friend brought back some delicious, albeit, rather strong sun-dried tomatoes from Italy for me and rather than do the Italian thing - chopping them and mixing them with olive oil to spread on bread or crackers - I wanted to do the American thing and cook them in a nice hot pasta dish. I found that there were too many different and complex flavors battling each other - the dish had too many complicated tastes to enjoy. Perhaps this was because the tomatoes were too overpowering and strong - they were not the typical ones you buy in the supermarket in a plastic bag. I would not make the recipe again - with or without revisions and/or substitutions.

I thought it was delicious, but like others, I made some changes. I too added 1 cup of veggie broth. Also, instead of wine I used sherry. In addition, I added some spinach, which both helped with the coloring and flavor. Finally, I used sundried tomatoes marinated in oil.

I followed some of the substitutions suggested by other reviewers - I added chicken broth concentrate to soaking water; added a small package of dried porcini mushrooms to the tomatoes,and increased the amount of garlic. I used baby portobella mushrooms since they are much more flavorful than the button ones. I also added a little white pepper since several reviewers had rated it bland. Due to the size of my skillet, I cooked the onions, garlic and mushrooms in the tomato soaking liquid while I was chopping the tomatoes and porcini. Then when the mushrooms had cooked down, I added the wine and chopped tomatoes. I only simmered the sauce about 15 minutes from this point instead of 25 minutes. I used whole wheat bow tie pasta. It was delicious, if a trifle monochrome - brown pasta with red-brown sauce!

Very nice pasta. Many thanks for the past reviewers, used the bouillon cube and a cup of half and half at the end. Have to remember that the sun dried tomatoes usually come in half, so should use 24 halves.

Excellent! I used fresh Fettecini and feta and the dish was delish!

I didn't think this recipe was very good at all. It tasted very bland, which is surprising because of all the different ingredients.

Great recipe! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and (1) added a boulion cube to the drained tomato liquid, (2) used 24 dried tomato "pieces" (3) used 5 garlic cloves. I sauteed the onion a bit before adding the other ingredients, and I used shitake mushrooms as well as regular mushrooms. To be repeated for sure!

This recipe was good over fettuccini, but tasted even better two days later over grilled pork chops! We didn't have pinenuts but still good without. Otherwise, used a mix of 'shrooms and chicken stock to reconstitue both tomatoes and dried porcini I had on hand. A great way to have two meals in one

I was very hungry, it's true-- but this recipe was amazing. Mushrooms used were oyster, cremini and shitake. I sauted the onions with 5 cloves of garlic in olive oil first. Then, when the onions were clear, I added the rest of the ingredients as suggested. Before I added the sun-dried tomatoe water, I dissolved one Harvest Sun vegetable bouillon cube to the reserved soaking water. Instead of Parmesan, I submitted a stronger Asiago shredded cheese. Followed the rest of the recipe. Incredible, and readily devoured by my hard to please mate. I used brightly coloured Italian bow-tie pasta. Can't wait until lunch tomorrow. Very flavourable due to mixture of mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and the wine and the bouillon cube. No need to add salt.

Inspite of overcooking the pasta my husband and I thought this was a good recipe. I made a few additions/changes to spice it up a little. I used 5 cloves of garlic (as another suggested), doubled the parmesan and added beef broth instead of reserving the pasta water, and of course, lots of salt and pepper. I think one problem for previous reviewers thinking it lacked flavor may have been the interpretation of the quantity of sun-dried tomatoes. They typically come packaged in halves so you would use 24 halves - big difference.

Despite the bad reviews, I decided to give this recipe a try since it was probably the best I could do with the limited ingredients I had on hand. I made some changes and the dish turned out great - not at all bland. My changes were: 1. steeped sun dried tomatoes in boiled chicken broth (1 can) 2. increased garlic to 5 cloves 3. used a package of porcini mushrooms and eliminated fresh mushrooms (didn't have any fresh on hand) 4. increased wine to 2 cups 5. sauteed mushrooms, onion, garlic and tomato in black truffle oil 6. added reserved chicken broth, 1/4 cup of reserved juice from porcini mushrooms and wine after vegetables had sauteed and reduced by about 3/4. 7. added 1/2 c. of half and half 8. decreased basil to one tsp. 9. added 2/3 c. frozen peas.

I used extra garlic, porcini mushrooms, used lots of fresh basil but it was still a bit bland. Taste was good but needs something extra. The boyfriend agrees, saying that it leaves you coming back for more but doesn't give quite give you what you want.

This is one of the few recipes on this site that I wouldn't try again. It sounded great, but I found it seriously lacking flavor. I didn't even finish my portion. I think if the tomato water was skipped entirely and you added more wine and perhaps a tad bit of chicken stock it might be better. Not as liquidy, but more flavor.

While it was easy to make I guess it just wasn't the flavor I was going for -- in fact I don't think it has much flavor. Sorry but I won't be making this again.

I have rated this recipe between a 2 to 3 forks. It was a nice dish, easy to make (with all the ingredients in the cupboard) and very soothing. My fussy teenager even ate it up and liked it. I did have dried porcini mushrooms on hand and they were a nice addition to the meal. I will make this recipe again for those nights when I need something fast and easy.

Make it at least 12 hours in advance to blend the flavors. Delicious!

This dish is very flavorful. I was looking for a recipe to serve to a vegetarian friend. This was a big hit. I'm considering using Portabello mushrooms the next time I make it.
