Soup is so-so. May try with beef broth as I like the onion and barley combination. The flan is wonderful. I browned the onions a bit and I use white pepper in a dish of this color and nature. I will make these as a first course for sure. They do take longer to bake and you can test readiness with a clean knife inserted in the center.

The soup was fine, the flan was okay, but I would have preferred both separately. I felt like it was soggy scrambled eggs int he soup.

This is a wonderful autumn soup with rich, full flavors. I did need more time for the flan. I ended up increasing the time and adjusting the temp to 350 which worked well.

HELP!!! This is delicious, but...My flan did not maintain it's shape when cooled and inverted on soup bowl. I want this to succeed for dinner party. Please advise.

My book group of very accomplished cooks raved about this soup - and I was delighted with it. All the richness of a good onion soup, the heartiness of barley over the cheese flan made for a great winter meal. I used a combination of onions, sweet vidalias, purple and spanish. It's good with just cheese, but the flan makes it incredible.

Made this as a test - for husband and brother. Rave reviews from all! Now, my changes - For the flan, I used 3 bunches scallions (green onions)and I did not put them in the blender with the milk and eggs. I folded them in along with the Swiss cheese. Cooking time in my oven was 40 min., not 30. I thought that with all the onions in the barley soup I didn't want to overpower the flan with more white onions. And, the bits of green onion in the flan made a nice texture/color combination. I will do this for a dinner party as a first course, but will use a smaller ramekin.

I served this at a small dinner party and both of my guests all asked for the recipe. I had some leftover and it was just as good the second day.

Delicious!A friend made this for a party and it was so good I had to make it for myself. It's wonderful for company, rich,nicely textured, and makes an interesting presentation. A keeper.

Remember that the "flan" is a custard, and as such , falls apart in the bowl and you have a separation of the cheese from the eggy portion. I like egg drop soup, but was not expecting that in this dish. Not a huge problem, but texture issue. Will try a beef stock next time, to more closely resemble traditional baked onion soup. Will also allow more time to really let the onions caramelize if I make it again.

What a great recipe. I made it for a few of my very discriminating friends - they are great chefs, and it was a hit. Look forward to making it again.

Made this on a cold rainy afternoon and it just hit the spot with hot out of the oven cheese biscuits.I left out the sherry didn't miss it. Even my husband( who likes nothing new) enjoyed it.

A very different approach to onion soup. I served enough of the soup to cover the flan so people had a "surprise" waiting for them - people LOVE surprises. The flan made the soup very rich. Served with a great Cabernet and a crusty bread this could almost be a meal in itself for a winter luncheon.
