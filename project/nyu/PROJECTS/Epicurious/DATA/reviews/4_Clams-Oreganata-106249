Extremely good. Didn't the crumb breads and added onion. Great Improvement.

As I was making this recipe, I doubted that I had enough sauce to steam. No need to worry. Recipe is perfect!

made this recipe as an entree dish and it was so yummy! The full recipe (3 lbs. of clams) is enough for 2 full entree size servings. I would eliminate adding any salt though, as the clams add enough saltiness to the dish. Skipped the breadcrumbs. Instead, I just added the lemon zest at the end. The lemon zest added a brightness to the dish. This one is a keeper!

I used larger, hard shelled clams for the recipe - more to eat, with less effort at the end. It was amazingly tasty and superbly easy to prepare. The flavor was absorbed very well. Everyone loved them - a definite keeper.

This dish was wonderfully delicious and very easy to cook. I wish I had served it with some warm, crusty bread, howeverI used fresh plum tomatoes instead of canned, and the sauce was so tasty, it was a shame to have to discard it.

Wonderful dish!! I had to use dried oregano, but it was fine. Instead of the plum tomatoes, I used a small can of Fire Roasted Tomatoes (Muir Glen) and also added about 1/2 c. white wine when I added the clams. I actually forgot the bread crumbs and did not realize it until the meal was over. So, guess you could say they were not missed! We loved this recipe and will make often!

Wow, I can't believe how good these were.Can't wait to make them again, next time for company. We live in new england but clams are always a special treat. It made a great appetizer.

I made this to try another clam recipe from this site (the first was the clams and chorizo - good stuff!) and to use some fresh oregano from my garden. I usually make fresh bread crumbs, but was lazy. Next time I definitely will. Still the clams were outstanding. My fiance and I ate with a nice crusty bread to soak up the juice and really enjoyed it!

Excellent dish! To round out the meal, I sauteed some red peppers, onions, garlic and mushrooms in olive oil and tossed them with some cooked vermicelli and some of the broth from the clam dish, served the clams on top and sprinkled the bread crumbs over all of it.

Great, easy recipe with a lot of punch! Used larger cherrystone clams, added white wine to sauce and reduced. Also added more veggies--bell peppers, onions and lots of mushrooms. Bread crumbs added a nice texture to the sauce. Would definitely try this with other shellfish. mmm!!

Delicious and quick once everything is mis en placed. I made this dish with New Zealand cockles and found them a bit too small, so I plan to use little neck clams. I omitted the tomatoes and after the garlic was sauteed, I splashed in about a quarter cup of bottled clam broth and added the clams and covered. I also tossed some fresh parsley over the finished dish. Serve it with a nice french baguette to soak up the juices.
