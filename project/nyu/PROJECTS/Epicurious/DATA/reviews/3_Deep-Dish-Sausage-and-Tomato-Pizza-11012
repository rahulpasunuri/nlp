The dough from this recipe is perfect for homemade pizza. I made it on a pizza stone, so it wasn't a deep dish, but the crust is fluffy and filling. I added ground turkey, pepperoni from the Italian deli, fresh mozz, mushrooms and green peppers as toppings, but you could really do whatever you like. This takes about the same time as waiting for delivery, but is so much better, even in Chicago. Double the recipe and it's perfect for a game night. I'd love to try this as a true deep dish, but can't find a deep dish pizza pan - any suggestions on where to look?

It was definitely edible, but not what I was hoping for in a deep dish pizza. For those that crave any sort of 'sauce', this pizza definitely won't provide it. The tomatoes add a tangy essence, but in the end it's just meat, cheese and tomato chunks. I was skeptical of the 500 degree oven temp, so I started it out at 450 for 15 minutes and then cooked it at 400 for another 15 minutes. It was perfectly done. The crust also has a lot more corn meal than I'm used to, and I don't know that I'm a fan of that. I probably wouldn't make this again.

Have made this a number of times, ebbing from delicious to disaster to delicious. The key is to drain the filling as much as possible. Any extra liquid seems to make it impossible for the bottom of the pie to crisp, leading to a soggy mess. I use a deep ceramic dish for this recipe. Will be making this for Superbowl 2011! It is incredibly easy once you get it to work.

great dough. we were skeptical of the 500 degree cooking temp, so we went down to 425 for about 40 minutes, and the dough was just outstanding. can't comment on the filling, since we used something else. if I could rate the dough alone, I would give it 4 forks.

This pizza was a hit! Based on earlier reviews, I added rosemary, oregano,basil and about a quarter cup parmesan to the crust for additional flavor. For the sausage mixture, I used twice the recommended oregano and added marjoram, basil and an entire head of roasted garlic to the sausage. It was delicious.

I made a batch of this dough for part of a pizza party to celebrate the inauguration last week, and I forgot to bake this base in the pan, just did it thin, on a hot pizza stone as the cook from North Shore does. It was a pleasant yellow colour, and the cornmeal does impart a nice extra crunch to the base. For One half of the recipe I used some very hot, Chili infused olive oil, the rest regular, and the chili crust developed a good, mild heat. I make my own marinara sauce, and we used that with a variety of toppings to create our own mini pizzas. I highly recommend it as a fun social gathering in the kitchen. It helps to half bake the bases ahead, and to have Two ovens...

I think the reviewer who mentions "rock salt" may mean sea salt or salt crystals

The pizza was basically an overcooked version of something you might hastily pick up at the corner quickie mart. If you entertaining or hosting the big game leave this recipe to the pros and order your pie. I reduced the temperature as the cheese began to burn after 13 minutes. Not one of my favorites.

We've made this a bunch of times - we actually like the crust because of the crunch with the cornmeal, but honestly don't make it deep-dish, just on a regular pizza stone. We also use spicy Italian sausage, and fresh tomatoes and basil.

A reviewer of this recipe stated that she added rock salt to the dough before rising. You cannot do that without ruining the dough.

I really enjoyed making this pizza. As a beginning "cook" I expected it to be harder than it really wasto prepare. The end result was a little blackened, but no burnt taste was detected. I think the degrees should be knocked down to 400, or at least the first 15 minutes might be changed to ten or so... but just keep an eye on it. Other than that, I will definitely be making this again. Absolutely delicious and my picky significant other even complimented me!

Everyone's right; crust is bland. I added 2 1/2 teaspoons rock salt, crushed red pepper, and rosemary to dough before allowing it to rise--also substituted butter for oil in dough. Grease with oil/lard if using butter in dough(else butter burns on bottom). Added garlic and rosemary to sausage; added onion, mushroom, and chopped green pepper. Topped cheese with dried basil.

Only used this recipe because I wanted a dough for deep dish pizza. I put my own topping. The cornmeal added a nice crunch but otherwise, the dough was bland. At 500C my cheese was brown in 10 min! so I took the whole thing out after 15 min.

Even the kids found this boring. Like another, used half ground beef, half sausage. I'd rather make lasagna, and with the no pre-cook noodles, its actually easier.

I've made this pizza several times -- usually for large gatherings of people watching football. People always rave about how great it is and it's fairly easy to fix, too.

This dish was easy, inexpensive, fast & hearty. My family thought it was very good but the next time I will replace half the sausage with ground beef as I found the sausage a bit overpowering. Green peppers, mushrooms, garlic could be added. The crust was especially good.
