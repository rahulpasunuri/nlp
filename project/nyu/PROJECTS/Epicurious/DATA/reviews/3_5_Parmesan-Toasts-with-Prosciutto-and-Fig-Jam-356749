This is an quick, easy and delicious recipe. The flavors work so well together. I've made this many times and always get compliments. I was asked to bring them to a Super Bowl party today.

This was a great recipe. Very easy. I would add more Parm cheese for sure. Even during dinner as people got up to get another drink or something, they ended up grabbing another one of this little toasts.

This was super easy to make and a crowd favorite. Next time I would add even more parmesan cheese.
