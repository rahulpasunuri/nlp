The best cake ever. There is real effort required but given that so much can be done ahead it really is a piece of cake. Here is link(you will have to copy and paste into your browser)to my version done as a 50th anniversary cake for my parents. This icing is a dream the ice a cake with as you can get it so smooth but I might make a standard buttercream for piping next time as this one softens too much in your hands in the piping bag. http://www.facebook.com/media/set/? set=a.1396332349350.56353.1263452199&typ e=3#!/photo.php? fbid=3863421665041&set=a.1396332349350.5 6353.1263452199&type=3&theater

I am in the process of making this cake for my daughters wedding shower. Make sure you get everything ready before even attempting this. My mom was a cake decorator before me and I learned a lot from her. Follow your recipe exactly, weighing and measuring everything Place wet towels around the edge of your pan before baking so it will bake evenly (there wont be any to cut off the top) You can cut a towel into strips and pin. there is even some premade that you can get at a kitchen store. Know your oven- I baked this for 80 minutes and it was perfect. There is a little trick that I wish I'd remembered that my mom did and that was to outline the inside edge of the layers with frosting to keep your filling from squishing out the sides. In this recipe though you dont make the frosting until after the layers have been put together The icing doesnt have to be smoothed down with a wet hot spatula, if you prefer, use a clean dry dishcloth folded into a square and pat the frosting all over, I find this method to be much preferable when you are decorating anyway. The recipe does not say, but mixing the blackberries and raspberries may be beautiful, I wanted to stay true to the recipe and try it this way first. The frosting is fabulous, however, I dirtied every pot, measuring spoon, measuring bowl,etc. That I basically had in my kitchen to make this. Make sure you have a big enough mixing bowl to start. You will marvel at the amount of butter that you are mixing in! I had lemon curd left over so we had them for dessert today with the leftover berries! Yum! My cake is made, filled, put together and iced in my fridge. I am going to freeze it, undecorated, until next saturday (this is the only thing I have deviated from in the orginal recipe) I have bought ribbon but I believe I will decorate in the old fashioned way and use a cake topper.

I have made this wedding cake recipe at least three different times. It is one I return to because it works, it is beautiful and it is delicious and moist.

Oops, I did it again! I'm the guy who wrote a review on 10/4/09. This time I baked the cake for a friend's surprise birthday party. Again, followed the recipe verbatim, planned out a strategic five-day baking plan and execution went well. The scariest part for me, again, was cutting each layer in thirds; I risk getting nervous about that kind of step and needed the calm hand of a friend. We marked out thirds with toothpicks and cut along their line. Decorated it less bridal and more whimsical this time. It was beautiful, tasty and, once again, the reviews were raves. Love this recipe!

This recipe is really as good as everyone says it is. The buttercream is to die for! It seemed as though the cake was quite dry because it has to bake for so long, but the glaze makes is really moist and delicious anyway!

I offered to bake the wedding cake for a dear friend's wedding. I'm a competent baker, though have never attempted a wedding cake or anything quite at that scale. I chose this recipe in June 2009 and have been studying it since. The actual baking started a week ago. I'd read all the reviews of the cake and integrated many of the suggestions; particularly the recommendation to space out the various components of the cake over a span of days. I was faithful to the recipe as written. On the first day I did the cakes; day two was the lemon curd and syrup; day three was layering the cakes, curd, syrup and berries; day four was frosting; day five was the construction, decoration and presentation. I was so familiar with the recipe that by the time I created it, it was like I'd baked it countless times before in my mind. Everything went incredibly smoothly. By far the most challenging day was the Day of Frosting; it all went fine, but was the greatest juggling act and most time consuming. But well worth it! I initially wasn't going to go with the ribbons - though I'd purchased some in the couple's colors of periwinkle and lavender. I had planned on simply using some fresh flowers in those colors - hydrangeas, small roses and some berry stems. But at the last minute I was inspired to try the ribbons and they worked beautifully. I placed a wax paper ribbon behind the whole ribboning to protect against frosting bleeding through and it worked. I pinned them with small pearl straight pins. It was lovely. The cake couldn't have been more delicious and gorgeous. The feedback was overwhelming, including high praise from the caterer... who was very familiar with wedding cakes and ranked this as one of the best he'd ever tasted. The whole experience was challenging, exciting and gratifying.

Wow! This is one delicious and beautiful cake! I was asked 2 weeks ago to make a wedding cake for a neighbor of mine. Although I am a Chef, I have never made a wedding cake for anyone, let alone one for a client. This recipe and the comments from others that made it before really sold me. I can vouch that it really does turn out beautiful and that the taste is divine. I followed the recipe to a "T", not changing anything. I was impressed that even the timing was spot on. You can't say that about many recipes. My kudos to the authors of this recipe. My client was absolutely impressed. I know you will be too!

Made a trial version of this for a dinner party last night (I am looking for a non-chocolate cake to make for 60 people next month). The cake itself is great - my husband said it's the best cake I've ever baked, not at all dry once you put the sugar syrup on it, but with the filling and frosting it wasn't what I hoped (I opted for a white chocolate, cream cheese frosting instead of tackling the buttercream from this recipe). The guests were split - a couple were high end caterers in NYC and when I asked their honest opinion they both felt it was too lemony and the frosting was lost with all the other flavors going on. The people who like lemon alot said it was incredible. So back to the drawing board.

I had this cake made for our wedding, and three years later, the guests are stilll talking about how good it was. It was sooo delicious. We substituted Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting for the filling and frosting, which was sublime.recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Lemon-Cream-Cheese-Frosting-105378 (the filling in the original recipe is far too labor intensive and not as good). Be sure to use CAKE FLOUR, not all purpose.

For anyone who wants to see what this cake looks like, it is on the cover of the June 1997 Bon Appetit magazine. I have a question about the directions. The online version says to cut off the rounded top, then cut the remaining into three layers. It then only instructs you to use 2 of essentially 4 layers. The printed version in Bon Appetit says to cut into 4 layers, but only use 3. But then a picture accompanying the recipe says to use the top rounded layer as the middle layer of the cake, which then makes the cake have a rounded top, unless you mound lots of filling around the edges. That is what I did when I made this cake about 5 years ago, and it ended up looking like the hat in "The Cat in the Hat", ie very tall, and a little tippy. Did other people who made this cake, cut it into 4 layers, but then only use 3? Or cut into 3 layers, and use all 3? I'm making this cake this week, so any quick replies would be welcome. Thanks. goodcooker2002@yahoo.com

I am amking my sister's wedding cake next month and made a trial version of this cake today, which was a huge success. My husband even went back for seconds... and he is NOT usually a cake person. The filling was lemony, but not overpowering. The cake had a nice texture and flavor as well. I have made several wedding cakes and am pretty picky, but I will most likely be making this one.

I gave this 4 forks before after only making the cake and syrup with a different frosting. Well, I made the cake and syrup again for my aunt's birthday cake (1/2 recipe) and made a whole recipe of the frosting. The frosting is a lot of work, but I'm glad I made the whole recipe because it freezes wonderfully. It is THE BEST FROSTING EVER. I usually don't like buttercream, even meringue buttercreams are usually too heavy and buttery for me. Since this one has yolks, I thought it was going to be really heavy, but the other reviewer is right - it is incredibly light. Just wonderful, you have to try it. I did use about 1 1/2 sticks less butter because I ran out. Not sure how much it would change by using all of the butter. Also, I made a swiss meringue instead of the italian sugar syrup mergingue - same result, but way easier and less messy (for me, anyway). I used some of the thawed frosting on a test cake for an upcoming wedding cake, and the bride to be said that it MUST be the frosting on her cake. Yummmm.

Seriously, this is the best cake in the world. It was my first non-betty crocker cake, and it turned out beautifully. I did the cakes one night, the filling the next night, and the frosting and assembly on the last day (which took the most time). Everyone said it was the best wedding cake they've ever had! I reduced the recipe to 3/4. I don't think you can go wrong! Used a 12" pan and an 6" pan - and there was a lot of frosting and filling left over. Who cares, used them for left- over deserts the rest of the week! Used raspberries & blackberries, no ribbon, and decorated with fresh roses and tulips. Didn't have dowels, so used sturdy bamboo skewers instead, which worked great. The trick with the frosting is to refridgerate the frosted cakes before decorating - the cold really keeps it together. Will make again!!! I will attach a picture when I get one back from bride and groom. Feel free to email me if you have questions: uberliner1@yahoo.com .

Has anyone frozen the cake after it has been frosted? If so, please let me know whether you thought it was successful, i.we., the cake, filling and frosting still tasted as great as everyone's reviews say. Also, please tell me how long you let it defrost before serving it. Thanks!

I made half of the cake recipe and the soaking syrup for my boyfriend's birthday cake. I used a raspberry filling and a dark chocolate ganache for the icing (that's what my he wanted...). As I expected, the chocolate, raspberry, and lemon were too much at once (for most people, anyway. The birthday boy said it was the best cake he's ever had!). So next time I would make it with the buttercream icing instead, which my aunt actually requested for her birthday because she liked it so much. Though the cake might be good with a chocolate icing, just without the raspberry filling. This cake was beautiful in every way: to look at, to slice, texture, taste... wonderful. It's sturdy, but still moist, and stayed that way for days. I think I'll use it for one of the tiers of a wedding cake I'm making next month. Definitely a keeper!

I made this cake for my mother's 60th birthday party. It was excellent!! I was continually astonished at how many lemons I was putting in the cake, but the end product is not overly lemony. It definately has a nice lemon flavor but it's not overwhelming. I served this cake at a rather upscale restaurant to 40 people- there was plenty to go around, I did cut small pieces though. The size was about 2" wide X the depth of the cake X 5-6" long. Everyone raved!! Said it was the best cake they had. The servers and chef at the restaurant raved as well and said it was the best they had too... I didn't make any modifications except for cake size- the sizes weren't available in my town so I used 1" smaller sizes, turned out fine. Didn't use the ribbon- used fresh small roses around the cake for decoration. Didn't use about 3 cups of the frosting- seemed too heavy. It was a ton of work but I would make it again for the right person!

This is a wonderful recipe! The cake and filling were magnificent and the frosting was excellent for a buttercream. This cake also makes an absolutely beautiful presentation. Here are some things I learned from making it that may help you. First, plan on three days prep. Second, the recipe works really well, though it is missing a few steps. There are three layers for each cake. One layer gets blackberry, the other raspberry. Third, the cake gets very tall, so you will need to plan for significant space in the frig and freezer if you plan to keep it for a while. Fourth, the frosting may crack under handling; however some hot water and a firm touch with your hands will fix most of this. Finally, I didn't think the ribbon was necessary, though I never did get to see a picture of the cake. I used peach roses, and off white freesia to decorate it. So, in sum, relax and enjoy making this cake and you will be rewarded with a beauty that tastes great!

I only made the lemon cake and the syrup, since I was making the cake a day ahead and didn't have room in the fridge for everything, I didn't want to use anything highly perishable like eggs or whipped cream in the filling. But the cake was great and was the bride and groom's favourite tier (I made three different tiers, the other two were fruitcake and the chocolate cake with milk chocolate caramel frosting from this site). I filled the layers with a coconut and white chocolate frosting, then covered in marshmallow fondant. The finished product was spectacular AND delicious!

I halved this recipe and it gave me enough for two 8" square cakes, which I sliced in half to layer with the filling. It only took about an hour to bake. It had a very lemony taste. I can't imaging why the other comment said it was not lemony enough. The filling had a very strong flavor. I did not find the cake to be dry, as one writer suggested. It was very moist. I used blueberries instead of the raspberries and it was a great combination. I LOVED the texture and taste of the icing. It was very creamy with just a hint of lemon flavor. My mother actually licked her plate! My aunt said she usually scrapes the icing off, but she ate every bit of this recipe. My sister gave it a 10. My grandmother and I thought it was a tad too lemony and sweet. I think that was the filling that was strong. But, every other comment we got was extremely positive. I think I would rate 3 forks, except the icing was totally wonderful, so it boosted it to 4 forks.

This was the recipe for my husband's and my wedding cake. So many people asked for the recipe at the reception, and said it was the best wedding cake they had ever eaten. It was so good that we couldn't wait until our 1st anniversary to eat the top layer, so we had it at our 3 month anniversary instead. For that length of time, it froze very well.

I have decided to add my 2cents as I found reading the reviews very helpful to me. I made this cake for my freinds son's reception. Looked fabulous and tasted great --it was a hit. I'm from BC Canada and had some trouble finding the cheesecake pans, but I went online to cooksdream.com (a company in Spokane WA )and had the pans shipped here. It took me 4 days from start to finish to bake this cake and the best advice I can give you is to have all your ingredients out and measured before you start each segment, you need to be organized for this one. It was great being able to freeze the cake for 2 weeks as it made life way easy. As for the buttercream frosting weeping into the ribbon I just cut waxpaper the same width as the ribbon and circled the cake with it and than ran the ribbon over top it. I decorated the cake with stemmed hydranda blossoms and to say the cake was stunning was an understatement,it would have mattered to no one if it had been the worst tasting cake. I found it hard to work with the buttercream frosting but than I am not really a cake decorator and it was a very hot day the day I did it. Hope some or all of this info helps someone else.

Made this cake for a baby shower and got great reviews. Personally, I thought it was a good cake but not phenominal. If you have a good stand mixer, it's not hard to make. I did not make the buttercream icing from this recipe- only the cake. I had tons of the lemon filling left-over, which was my mistake as I should've added more between the layers. The lemon filling is the BEST!!! I would make this cake again.

I'm a fairly experienced baker, and I guess the minority here, but I thought the cake was good, not great, but good. It is so time consuming, though, that by rights it ought to be an excellent cake. It has an almost pound cake texture and density; in fact, it's similar to my favorite lemon pound cake recipe. It's disappointing to me to invest a couple of days into a cake and have it come out just good.

I made this cake (with a few variations) as a birthday cake. I made 1/3 of the recipe for a 9 inch cake, then made the lemon curd alone (didn't add the whipping cream) for the filling, frosted it with the buttercream and piled lots of raspberries and blueberries on top. It got rave reviews! I rated it a 3 instead of a 4 only because I haven't tried making it as a full wedding cake, and because of the modifications that I made. I made the cake over 3 days and froze the layers until I was ready to frost them.

I made a trial for a friend's birthday, decorated it with raspberries on top and no ribbon, and I could not believe how much gushing I received...everyone thought i was either a professional, or in chef school, or starting a business...I was told it was the best cake they'd ever had, and even people who didn't know it was me who made it were raving in front of me - so it wasn't just to make me feel good! I'm making the actual wedding version this weekend...really followed the recipe to a T, though I'm using square instead of round pans. I found the middle of the cake (esp the larger one) didn't quite cook through, though of course I took it out early cause it was browning on top. I may make it at slightly lower temperature this time, or cover after 1/2 hr. This is definitely time consuming - especially the frosting - but worth it if you like to be the star of the show! I second the recommendation of having a clean kitchen and leaving yourself time for it. I didn't find it so bad, cause I could leave cakes to cool and go away and come back to it, etc., but others might find it worse. Also, there was a lot of frosting - way too much for me to use. Maybe people really slather it on, but I thought I used a lot, and I had tons left over...

I made this for my best friend's bridal shower and everyone was overwhelmed. I've never received so many compliments in my life! i followed the directions to a T. It took me 2 evenings to make including setting my alarm for like 4am to beat the egg whites into the chilled curd and chill again. (i recommend taking 1 shopping/prep day- making sure you have everything & cleaning the kitchen and have a very simple dinners prepared or take out so you don't spend your night on other things.. :), then take 3 days to make it..:) That way you're relaxed, organized and won't get frustrated or overwhelmed or careless. But it took my breath away how good it was. It's like a giant lemon cake with this silky incredible filling. It was unreal. I LOVE parchment paper!! (that was a new discovery for me..) I was scared. This was such a huge project I just figured there was no way I could do it all right. And I was overjoyed with each step when it came out so well. To reply to other comments: It feeds 44 or more easily. We had about 40 women at the shower and there was enough for the men who came in at the end and devoured the rest. and the 8 inch top layer of the cake was still left! Whole milk vs. skim milk ricotta should make no difference in the cake except the difference in taste between whole milk and skim milk ricotta.. but cake pan size makes a HUGE difference in baking times and in whether the cake batter is enough! I actually went back once and looked up the formula to find the volume of a cylinder to figure out how to adjust for different cake sizes. Volume=Pi (3.14)*radius squared*height. But I used the right pans for this cake. A stunning cake for a special occasion!!

I made this as a non-wedding, normal sized cake by halving the recipes. Baked 30-35 minutes in 8 inch pans. Just a warning - it you want a pure white icing use a different recipe. This makes a tasty ivory icing becuase of the egg yolks

Fabulous. The reviewers were right. I made this for my parents' 40th anniversary party. There was not a drop left on anyone's plate and many came back for seconds. I baked the cakes and frosted them in Los Angeles, chilled them so that the icing hardened, wrapped them in plastic and packed them in a cooler with ice packs and bubble wrap, checked them as luggage (security opened the cooler to test for explosives, but luckily they had lots of duct tape to reseal it) and flew them to Chicago. I had to touch up the frosting a bit, but they basically arrived intact. I had never baked a cake like this but, while it was time-consuming (cakes - 1 evening; fillings and initial assembly - half a day; frosting - half a day), it was not difficult. I'm now hoping a friend will get married so I can do it again!

Fantastic cake! It is definitely time consuming but so worth the effort. I made it for my sister's wedding and people were licking their plates. Without exception, every guest, and most importantly the bride, loved it. I had several people ask me to make it for upcoming special events. Honestly, it isn't the kind of cake you'd make for a passing acquaintance, but I'd make it for a family member in a heartbeat.

I have made this cake three times with the help of my sister and her husband, two different trials and the actual cake for my sisters wedding. It was timeconsuming (took most of three days with three people working on it), but definitely worth it! The final decorations I did alone and without earlier practice. It was beautiful! My sister thought that I had let professionals do the finishing touches, but this cake is so easy to decorate that you get "the professional look" even if you are a beginner - like I am.

This cake is magnificent! It was even better the next day! My sister and I baked this cake together to try it out and we are definitely using this cake for my wedding in January. The raspberries will be season then - they were a bit expensive on the trial cake but nothing even close to $US40! We found that mixing fresh raspberries with frozen (but thawed) blackberries was fine and did not make the cake soggy. We were prepared to spend all day on the cake but didn't find it as time-consuming as everyone else. If you make the syrup and lemon filling the night before then it only takes a few hours. Then again, there was two of us...maybe that helps. We went exactly to the letter with the recipe and everything went perfect. None of us found the frosting too buttery or the cake too dense. I thought it wasn't quite lemony enough, we will add more to the real thing. When making the toffee I kept using a baster dipped in cold water to keep the sugar off the sides of the saucepan (like the recipe says) however if you do this too often the liquid doesn't get up to the right temperature. We used only a quarter of the recipe and found that the servings give huge slices of cake. If you are having the wedding cake as dessert you may want to have slices this big but as we are having dessert and then cake we just want fingers. We have square pans too so that will give us more cake for each person. We will let you know how the real thing goes! The comments here were all very helpful. Thanks for the tip on the coloured ribbon. Maybe if there was paper or cardboard stuck to a light coloured ribbon it would not soak up any of the buttercream. A truly delightful cake!!

Okay, I am clearly in the minority here, but this cake was a huuuuge disappointment. I must have done the cake entirely wrong. To be fair, I did several things differently: 1) I used whole-milk ricotta instead of the part-skim; 2) I baked the cakes in a 13x9, an 8x8, and an 8" round. The cake baked up with giant air (?) bubbles from the bottom up, about the size of a fist in the big pan & corresponding sizes on the smaller pans. Unable to use them! What I tasted was tasty, but VERY heavy... more like a ton-cake, not a pound cake and nothing to jump for joy over. Didn't bother trying to re-bake using this recipe, went out and bought a box-mix and ended up with a moist, light, delicious cake instead. I used the other parts of the recipe with the box-cake and received compliments on the whole thing. The syrup & lemon filling were fine, buttercream was extremely buttery (left a film in my mouth, but got compliments). Raspberries & blackberries are out of season right now and cost $40 just for 4 baskets each so I opted to use preserves instead, which I liked in spite of an overabundance of seeds. I suppose if I had had the correct pans and had used part-skim ricotta I'd have had different results, but I'll never know. This recipe was beyond time consuming and I won't waste any future time on something with potentially lacklustre results.

Against my better judgement, I made this cake for my wedding party. It was truly the hit of the party with people going back for seconds and thirds. I one and a halved the recipe to make a 12 inch, 10 inch and 8 inch tiered cake. This really taxed my mixer (couldn't fit the last bit of butter in to the frosting) so if you are planning on increasing the recipe and you have the patience, I would make the frosting in two batches. Also, a note on the ribbon, the frosting is incredibly buttery, so the ribbon I adhered (orange with red polka dots) turned dark in spots which kind of ruined the effect. Might want to choose a dark ribbon.

I made this for my cousin's wedding last weekend and it turned out awesome! I cannot believe the kind of compliments I received: "Best wedding cake I ever had", This is better than sex!", how long did you have to go to school to learn this?' and "you should go into business". I made a 3 tiered cake with 6X3", 9x3" and 12x3" cake pans with the removable bottoms. I used one full recipe and 1/4 of the recipe making 1 full batch and a small batch (originally cut down recipe for test cake.) I made the cakes 3 days before the wedding and put in the freezer. The day before the wedding I made the filling (took the cakes out of the freezer 1st) cut the cakes after they thawed and assembled the cakes. (for those confused with the assembly, you will layer cake, syrup, filling, berries; then again cake, syrup, filling, berries; and finally cake & syrup). Then made frosting and refrigerated. The next morning, I covered in fondant and crystallized flowers. I came out very pretty. This was my 1st wedding cake and I am so happy it came out so good!

Before I put the effort into this project...I'm just a beginner....would someone please tell me what to do with the middle layer at the preliminary assembly point....it seems to have been overlooked in the recipe. My guess is to do with that, what you do with the bottom and top layers....syrup, berries etc....

Just back from our Honeymoon! I made this cake for our wedding (June 22nd)and read and re-read all the reviews and was nervous to make "our Wedding Cake". I decided on making the cake myself after looking at bought cakes ($$$) and finding this recipe. This cake was absolutely fabulous!! What a HIT! It fed more than 40 people. Plan on 4 day's to make this cake: 1) I made the cake first, wrapped it really well with Saran Wrap and put it in our chest freezer. 2) A couple of weeks later I defrosted the cake in the fridge and made the lemon syurp and the lemon curd - I put these in the fridge. 3) The next day I assembled the cake (cut it into layers, put on the lemon glaze and curd and added the berries - I used raspberries and blueberries). I put the cakes back in their respective pans (went to a cake store and bought 12" and 8" pans. They do not have a removable bottom. She told me to grease and flour the pans and add the parchment paper on the bottom - no problem at all getting the cakes out of the pans - whew!) I wrapped both cakes with plastic wrap and put them in the fridge. 4) The next day I made the icing. A little time consuming put I didn't have any problems. I took the cakes out of their pans, (by putting the cardboard cake plate on the top of the pan and flipping over the cake) iced them both (start with a bit of icing, refrigerate and then finish icing). I put the cakes in the fridge, waited for the icing to harden than wrapped them really well in plastic wrap and back in the deep freeze. Two days before the wedding I took them out of the freezer and put them in the fridge. I did not put the ribbon around the cake. My Mom decorated the cake with flowers from their garden - it was beautiful. My friends 25th Anniversary is next year and she would like me to make the cake! Now it will be easy to do...any orders! ;-)

My bride-to-be is planning on making this cake for our wedding, so we test-drove it at our shower. What a hit! We froze the top layer for testing purposes, and the bottom layer was enough to feed our 40+ guests and still have leftovers. The frosting was a pain, but fantastic. We're definately using this for our wedding in July!!!

If you love being the center of attention this is the cake that will get you rave after rave. It does require a lot of work but if you space it out over a few days it will seam less overwhelming (I froze the cake for two weeks than the day before frosted it partially frozen). I used a lemon buttercream frosting instead of the one in the recipe. I needed a easier frosting for a middle of the week baby shower at work. It worked very well. There wasn't one person who's eyes didn't roll when they took their first bite. A perfect cake.

I made this cake for my own wedding, and it was wonderful. Not only was it beautiful, it was also the most flavorful wedding cake I've ever tasted. Yes, the frosting took forever to make but it was so worth it! I used raspberries and boysenberries for the filling, and decorated it as shown, substituting a blue/lavendar theme instead of the peach. I may have to make it again for our anniversary!

I made this cake formy sister's wedding and afterwards the caterer was so impressed she asked me where I got the recipe. I used a double recipe for an enormous bottom layer and did the top layers of the cake out of styrofoam with a rolled fondant over the buttercream.

This cake was incredible. I made it for my grandmother's 95th birthday. It was sooo much work, but worth every minute, I got nothing but raves and it was so beautiful. I started preparing it four days ahead (baked the cake, made the filling and syrup one day, torted and filled the next day, frosted the third day, final decoration the fourth day). The frosting was the most time consuming, but worth the effort. Word of caution - after applying the crumb coat, it's supposed to cool in the fridge for an hour, make sure you re-beat the frosting (it will be thin and spongey after sitting at room temp. for an hour while the cake is in the fridge) before you add the final coat of frosting. I did not re-beat and it was difficult to make a smooth coat of frosting, had to repeatedly heat the spatula (had a pan of simmering water nearby) to get the frosting smooth. It was the most beautiful cake, and nobody could believe that it didn't come from a bakery. The best compliment came from my sister-in-law who just got married this past April - she wished that I could've made her wedding cake (hers came from an expensive local caterer)!

I made this cake---minus the rasberries---for my daughter's wedding. The frosting was the most time consuming frosting recipe I have ever made,but after I tasted the "test" batch ,I almost SWOONED!It was worth every minute it took to prepare and every calorie it contained. The filling was wonderful as well and the Lemon Wedding Cake that my daughter always wanted was more than she had hoped for. I received nothing but raves and would recommend this to anyone who wants an exceptional dessert.

I thought the cake tasted and looked wonderful, although it was a little denser than I personally would have liked. But it went over very well at the wedding. The lemon flavor was excellent, and I particularly liked the filling which was wonderfully creamy and lemony. I covered the finished cake in fondant and decorated it with large clusters of raspberries, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries -- it looked great!

I'm afraid I didn't have the same over-the-top positive experience as all other reviewers. While this was the prettiest cake I have made (did not use ribbons, just raspberries on top to decorate) and I liked the lemon, not-too-sweet flavor of the cake, I didn't care for the texture - dense, and a teensy bit shiny from the vegetable oil but less dense than a poundcake. In addition, I'd expect clearer instructions for a cake of this size. For instance in 'Make cake' section, recipe gave directions for 12-inch cake pan preparation , and then ignored 8-inch cake pan. In 'Make frosting' instructions, we see 8-inch cake instructions icnluding the amount of frosting to use, and no 12-inch cake instructions. Yes, you'd figure out to repeat, but I'm used to clearer instructions from Bon Appetit. The recipe indicated to cut each cake in thirds, but only fill each cake once. Was I the only baker to have over 6 cups of leftover buttercream, 3 cups of left-over filling, and 2 baskets of berries? Why would one need 3 12-inch dowels when you're cutting one dowel into, at most, 4-inch pieces? Clearly I may have missed something in the recipe.

This cake was fabulous! I made it for a wedding shower and then again for easter. The cake is moist and very flavorful. The best part is the icing. The first time I made it I used frozen berries which I wouldn't do again as it made the filling slightly mushy. The second time I used fresh berries and it turned out wonderful. This is a perfect spring or summer cake.

this is the most delicious cake I have ever made!!It did require some planning,but really wasn't as difficult as it sounds...I also used springform pans, because I could not find a cheesecake pan,and they worked fine. I definitely am going to make this one again!

I made this cake for a friends wedding last summer, and now I am going to make it for my own this summer. The guests at the wedding loved it. It was one of the best cakes I have tasted (especially a wedding cake). I highly recommend it.

I made this cake only slightly smaller for a wedding shower. It satisfied all my cravings: dense lemony cake, light fruity filling, rich buttercream. I decorated it with garden roses in deep pink, peach, and orange tones. The bride and groom guests of honor were completely bowled over. We froze the top layer and had it about 6 months after they were married and it was still great. I made the cake part again, but just one layer, for a birthday party and frosted it with regular buttercream. Not as good as the original, but still the best lemon cake I've ever had.

Our friend made this cake for his wedding and we all loved it. However, I liked the cake even better AFTER the wedding! Our friend made me a "shortcake" version -- using the leftover scraps of cake, with lemon curd in the middle, then topped with lots of frosting and sprinkled with berries.

I made this cake for my wedding in August and it was wonderful! Having never made a cake of this size or importance before, I halved the recipe the first time I tried it and it still worked out great. For the final cake, I made the cake 1 week in advance and the rest of it 2 days before and the assemble it the day of. The assembly was a little bit confusing so I cut each layer into thirds and put raspberries in one layer and blackberries in the other. I also used a lemon cream cheese frosting and covered the cake with fondant. It turned out fantanstic.

I am making this cake for my daughter's wedding, she chosed it. I did a trial cake. It's a lot of work and planning, but worth it all the way. Due to space constraints, I will have to do it in three stages. We all licked our fingers and the girls licked the bowls, spatulas, etc.

I made this for a wedding shower last week and I am still getting rave reviews! It did take a tremendous amout of time (leave yourself an entire day) but it was certainly worth it. The filling and frosting were soooo good!

I made this for a British couple for their baby shower. They both loved it and the ultamate compliment was "it tasts just like a cake from England would tast". It was a lot of work but definetly worth it. I actually handpicked the raspberries because I wanted them to be fresh.I loved all the compliments from everyone at the shower and would definetly make this cake again!

I am making a wedding cake for a friend and made this recipe as a trial-run. The cake was a bit dense, but very good, with a distinct lemon taste. The cake was also not too sweet, a common problem with cake recipes. It will certainly hold up well when it is stacked into layers!

This was actually not a hard cake to make. It just takes a little planning and lots of time but definitely worth it. I made both tiers with each taken to a different function and it was a hit at both. Instead of decorating the cake with ribbons, I left the side plain and decorated the top with a garland of berries.

A friend of mine made this cake for a recent wedding we both attended. I can honestly say this was the best cake I have ever tasted!!! Though the cake's ingredients are very rich, the flavour is delightfully light. The lemon cake combined with butter cream icing is to die for. I am not a fan of overly sweet desserts, so this wedding cake was definitely to my taste. I loved the cake so much, I begged my friend for the recipe, which has led me to your web site. Though it sounds like a lot of effort to create, I can assure you this delicious cake is worth it.

We loved this refreshingly different cake - and we're not normally cake fans. We adjusted proportions and just made it for the family. Then we made it again the next week! We loved it so much we are planning it for our upcoming wedding. It has flavor, texture and character -- 3 qualities missing from most cakes. We used Eureka lemons to accentuate the flavor, and omitted 25% of the sugar in the cake part. I find virtually all dessert recipes overload the sugar, and have often suspected it was a cover for poor flavor or substandard ingredients. There is no need to cover up the flavor in this masterpiece, so I recommend reduce the sugar, and I rate this recipe a 4++!
