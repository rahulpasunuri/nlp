For many years, each time I came across a recipe for Indian Pudding that stated on the recipe that it was Durgin Parks own famed and beloved recipe, I would make it. Theirs was my personal Gold Standard for Indian Pudding. No matter what the source of the recipe stating it was Durgin Parks own, each time I was disappointed. Recently I was motivated to try again to surprise a friend, and this time I approached it with the help of the internet -- Epicurious and beyond! Ironically the James Beard recipe did a near-perfect job of replicating my memories of the Durgin Park delicacy  better than those recipes attributed directly to Durgin Park! After reading a number of posts on the internet, I thought there was validity to the point that maple syrup would have been the most readily available sweetener in New England in Colonial times. Based on the positive reviews of James Beards recipe, I used that as the foundation and made the modification of using about 1/3 Maple Syrup! BINGO! I had read a number of people enjoying it for breakfast: a great excuse for making more. No matter what I have done to it, this turns out to be the recipe Ive sought for several decades, ever since I left home for college. I have added pumpkin: also wonderful, except for needing some adjustment in sweetening and perhaps a pinch more of salt, and -- believe it or not  a bit more ginger. Others reviewers have commented on the strong ginger taste; the initial bite IS strong, and it does indeed mellow with cooking. True confessions: I also made a version that used some Splenda (travesty, I know: certainly no Splenda to be found in the Colonies!) and it worked quite well. Minimal notable aftertaste. Other Durgin Park Indian Pudding seekers: Look no further. James Beard  Thank you yet again!

I have been making Indian Pudding for over 50 years and only made this version because it was as close to my original recipe as I could find when we were on vacation. Once I got home, I discovered the difference: I use 2/3 cups cornmeal, not 1/3 cup. You reserve 1 cup of the milk to pour into the casserole once it's in the oven and you DO NOT STIR, ever! Bake for 3 hours and it comes out set and tasting like corn meal. This was good but my old recipe from Minnesota is better.

I was rather unimpressed. No corn flavor, too much molasses, and too much ginger. I even took previous writers' advise to add maple syrup and reduce the molasses. No help. The first time I had indian pudding was at the Smithsonian American Indian museum cafeteria in D.C. Surprising as it is to say this about museum cafeteria food, it was wonderful, with maple flavors mixed with I-don't-remember-what. Was hoping to find that recipe here, but I didn't. Will have to keep searching. In the meantime, this recipe was okay for me, but I wouldn't serve it to guests.

Made this and served with chicken apple sausages and apple juice. Absolutely fabulous. Can be topped with whipped or ice cream as dessert but really is delicious on its own. Great breakfast treat served either hot or cold.

this is a great, very traditional indian pudding. next time i will add more spices--clove, cinnamon and nutmeg--in addition to the ginger.

James Beard would know. It is perfect. I used blackstrap molasses cut with one-third real maple syrup. It's a perfect historic recipe that is delightful today with the decadent vanilla ice creams we have at our beckon. I like this because it is so pure and not too sweet.

If you remember the old Howard Johnson's version of Indian Pudding, this is it. Don't be tempted to add cinammon or nutmeg or anything else besides molasses and ginger. I added a little salt and about 2 tbs. of butter and it turned out perfectly. To those who feel that the molasses flavor is overwhelming, try regular molasses instead of the extra-strong or blackstrap varieties.

I don't know what Indian Pudding is supposed to be like but this turn out more like a porridge than an pudding and it was way too molasses-y.

It's delicious! My boyfriend just recently introduced to Indian pudding, as he just loves it. I was hoping to find a recipe to rival his favorite at the Deerfield Inn in Mass. I think I may have found its match! I can't wait to have him try it!

This is the definitive, simple, delicious, standard recipe for IP. There is no need to mess around with the other versions that contain eggs. Adding a little cinnamon and nutmeg is a permissible perversion. Having sampled them both within a week of each other, I can attest that this recipe is every bit as good as what is served in Durgin-Park in Faneuil Hall, a restaurant whose IP is considered a signature dish. By the way, this version will serve 6 people only if they do not like dessert. It serves 4 normal people, or 3 full-blooded actual Indians.

My mother made this a lot in the 1960s, so I figure she must have used a recipe much like this one. It was tasty, but you have to like molasses. I would recommend using mild and not strong molasses; I used half mild and half strong.

I made this some time ago, inspired by a remark made by Bob Taylor, a former Bell Labs boss of my husband's, that this dessert was a favorite of his. So glad you're featuring it - it really is delicious; I hope Bob(and Eleanor) would agree!

The molasses and ginger are a wonderful touch
