This is good - very much how I know our southern and Texan relatives to cook them (they don't use breadcrumbs!). However, I think the cornmeal crust is improved by a very light flour dredge before the egg - then the cornmeal mixture. I also prefer them with a little more than paprika for spice - a little Old Bay or Creole seasoning sets off the tartness is the tomatoes!

really good and easy. i followed this recipe and made the basil mayo from another way too complicated looking fried green tomato recipe. I used peanut oil which helped keep things from getting burned.

I haven't tried this recipe but it's nearly identical to what I do w/green tomatoes every time I'm lucky enough to find them. I also think that cutting them a little thinner is a good idea so that they cook through and are not so bitter. Sometimes I throw caution to the winds and saute them in bacon drippings - now we're talking southern!

I cut the recipe in half to try it and I used a bunch of spices (Thyme, Rosemary, garlic powder, cumin, chili pepper). I added the salt and pepper to the corn meal mixture and also sprinkled on top as they were cooking. They were so yummy! No need for a topping.

Living in the serious north (Edmonton, AB) each fall is a race between the ripening and the winter so we searched for recipes for FGT and found this one. They were pretty tasty, although a little tart. I have since added different spices to the cornmeal and think that is the way to go, don't be beholden to the paprika!

Seriously a perfect recipe. My tomatoes were firm and tart -- almost citrusy in flavor. Matched up with the crisp cornmeal crust with salt and smoky paprika, it was simple and very tasty.

Very yummy with tomatoes cut on the bias. I also added garlic salt after they were done frying.

Here's the story: a storm wrecked one of my tomato plants, so I salvaged what I could and then looked for a recipe for fried green tomatoes, since that's the only use that I know of for green tomatoes. I had never eaten fried green tomatoes before so my rating reflects that, not having any experience to compare this one to. I followed the directions exactly, and they came out better than I expected. Not the greatest food to ever grace my plate, but a good use of my otherwise doomed tomatoes. We enjoyed them dipped in some ranch dressing (it was all I had on hand) and I would use this recipe again if I ever have another mishap with my tomato plants. I would probably not spontaneously add fried green tomatoes to my regular rotation, though.

Slice the tomatoes 1/4 inch thick, they will fry more crispy and won't be so bitter.

I tried this with cherry tomatoes and they came out pretty well, though I have never had authentic fried green tomatoes. I sliced each tomatoes in half, stirred in the egg, then used a slotted spoon to place small batches on a plate covered in the cornmeal mix, covered them w/ more cornmeal, tossed gently, then fried in a pan with maybe a centimeter of oil in it. Seasoned with quite a bit of salt. Not bad, but I still look forward to trying it with full sized tomatoes.

My mother made fried green tomatoes using flour and butter. I didn't like them then, but these were terrible, tasteless and bitter. A little sugar in the flour might help but if your tomatoes are hard supermarket types, don't bother.

I gave you a 4 forker on this one because i like down home comfort food and i love fried green tomatos. This recipe is great as is or you can seve them up with come cold buttermilk dressing drizzled lightly over the topwith some extra pepper. This was an excellent table goodie.

followed recipe closely, as it was my first time w/ fried green toms. I did add some thyme (fresh), oregano (fresh) and a bit of sage (fresh). They turned out very well, crispy but somewhat tasteless. next time I will add some garlic and fleur de sol, or just more salt lol. Plus, this recipe lends itself to a nice ranch or cucumber dressing for dipping. Maybe a light vinegarette drizzle would add some pizazz?! I will do this again for sure. It's a southern winner!!

This is just about right - the trick for superb fried green toms is to have minimal seasoning and super crisp frying. Finish with a good sprinkle of salt. It really brings out the lemon-y tart deliciousness of a fried green tomato!

I absolutely love fried green tomatoes. Our tomatoes have come (really really) early this year so I have already gotten to try this one out. I've used panko, cornflakes, and breadcrumbs and of all those this with cornmeal and a very fine breadcrumb coating have been the winners. The green tomatoes are dense so they need a dense coating. I also add thyme, granulated garlic, and chili powder.
