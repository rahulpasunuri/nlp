I have been making this recipe for years, always with much success, and to the delight of family and friends. It is a pasta salad with real flavor, not bland at all. After the rave reviews, my 86 year-old Mother-in-Law asks for seconds as well. I use fresh herbs from my kitchen garden, buy the roasted red peppers from Trader Joes, Prosciutto from Costco (much cheaper and delicious), and use Barilla's Campanelle pasta only which I have found at some Ralph's stores. I double the recipe so there will be leftovers the next day... but never quite enough! And make it first thing in the morning for a late afternoon BBQ side dish. The photo of this recipe appeared on the cover of the Index of the 1994 Gourmet magazines... lovely in an of itself.

This was exceptional

Made this last night, and found that it turned out more like a pasta salad than a main dish. Spent forever chopping - would use a food processor next time. Added crushed garlic. Needed a little bit more sweetness - perhaps an increased basil to parsley ratio.

Fabulous salad. I have been making it every summer for eight years. Delicious

This was good but it wasn't great... For the amount of chopping we had to do my boyfriend and I excepted something more. We jazzed up the leftovers the next day by adding sauted garlic. If someone made it and served it to me, I would eat it but I wouldn't go out of my way to make again.

I made this recipe last year when it was herb season, and people were bringing their surplus herbs in to the office. The recipe was so easy, so fresh, and so good. So now that it is herb season again, I decided to hunt down this recipe and will be making copies for some other people in the office.
