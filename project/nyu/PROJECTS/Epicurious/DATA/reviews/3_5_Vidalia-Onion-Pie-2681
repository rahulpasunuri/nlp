From reaching the comments, I did prebake the crust and had no problems with it staying intact. I do use more onions than called for, but thought this could use a bit more overall filling. Loved the flavor of the white cheddar with the onions and didn't feel it overpowed anything. A variation on a basic quiche lorraine with a decidely American homespun (Ritz cracker) approach. Great for a light dinner with a salad.

So easy and incredibly delicious. It has become a fixture at our Thanksgiving gathering as my sister-in-law and her relatives request it every year. Follow the recipe just as written every time. The only thing I will add is that I always use well aged white cheddar. It's expensive, but really makes the pie. I have never pre-baked the crust as others suggest, but do spend a lot of time making sure it is well mixed and very packed down before I add the filling. The crust holds together and is perfect.

It was good & I'll make it again. Was glad for suggestions on prebaking crust. Needed all 4T butter in crust, and used 1T each butter and olive oil for onions. It wasn't too buttery for us! Used pepper jack cheese; husband doesn't like cheddar. Only cooked the Vidalias 5 minutes; I think they would have melted away if I had cooked them longer. In fact, that's my only "problem" with this recipe. The Vidalia's are so good right now I think they're best raw. I might add more next time. They were a bit overpowered by the quiche.

I made this in a 9" tart pan. It was good but I didn't find it overly exciting. I'm not a fan of Ritz crackers so I made a pate brisee for the crust. The onions shrank down nicely so they weren't overwhelming. I ate this as a main course but I think it might be more appreciated thinly sliced accompanying something else. I'll make it again to serve in that manner.

Yum! Good and easy. Follow recipe as written and turns out great. I cook the crust for 7-8 minutes before adding onions.

I love, love, love this recipe! Make it all the time. I thought it would be "hillbilly" with Ritz crackers, but it's just savory and creamy and warm and delicious. Lessen the butter, but add more onions. Make sure to cook them down to brown and limp. Yum! Oh, and I leave out the paprika - what purpose does it serve?

Overall, I liked this recipe. The proportions of ingredients were appropriate. However, I would highly recommend baking the crust slightly (7-8 minutes) before filling the pie with the sauteed onions and liquid ingredients, and baking. Prepared the way the recipe is written, the crust is rather crumbly and the pie does not hold it's shape very well. As far as taste is concerned, it's a very good recipe.

This recipe is not my favorite, however, my husband loved it. He did say it would be improved with meat and I agree. Could be why I don't love it yet. Crumbled pre-cooked bulk sausage, chunked chorizo or even chicken would make it better for my preference. For that matter, either making the cheese be half swiss and/or a real crust instead of Ritz to make it more like a quiche would be good.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe. It was gone in about 15 minutes. I did add crumbled bacon on top of the onions and some cayenne pepper to the egg mixture. Would be good to try with other ingredients (sausage, mushrooms, spinach, etc.)

This is the first Epicurious recipe with which I have been truly disappointed. It tasted like a really bad quiche. I made this for my Friday youth group meeting on a Thursday night, and ended up making an emergency run to the store for ingredients to make something else... anything else.

A baddie but a goodie! Absolutely NOT nutritious, but very delicious! I only used half the butter called for and 1% milk, yet this pie was laden with fat - small pools of it on the cheese topping and the cracker crust was quite greasy too. I did add 4 slices of cooked crumbled bacon atop the onion layer, so yes that upped the fat/calorie content significantly. I don't think I would make this again, but I sure did enjoy this "guilty pleasure". Reminds me of the rich quiches and stratas we used to eat as often as we wanted back in the '80s before we were concerned about "eating smart". No wonder so many of us have high cholesterol counts - yes, I mean me!

Absolutely wonderful. My mother and I have made this again and again. Even using skim milk and altering the amounts a bit, it is fantastic and an easy recipe to make. Next time, I may try adding some sauteed mushrooms, or jalepenos as some other readers have done, for variety. Yum!

Sooooo good! I made good use of my food processor for this recipe. I will make this many more times and pass it on to my friends.

Outrageous, as you might expect from the ingredients. Will make this again and again.

I loved this recipe with the suggestions of some of the reviewers - I used 3 tbsp butter with the Ritz crackers, 2 tbsp butter when sauteing the onions, and skim milk. It was a little bland for us, so we put Cholula hot sauce on top. It was wonderful! Almost addictive, and very hard to stop eating! Next time I will mix the hot sauce in with the milk and eggs.

It's delicious and very easy. Less butter is better. I added pickled jalepeno's when I was having a mexican dinner. Also served it for brunch with crumbled bacon added with the onion. It's delicious and very easy.

This is an excellent recipe for onion lovers. I took it to a family turkey supper and got rave reviews. The 3 tbsps of butter for the crust is ample. I used double if not triple the onions called for in the recipe (because I have an abundance of onions which I need to use up) and still used the suggested amount of milk and eggs. I did saute the onions well so they cooked down considerably. The end result was excellent and I will definitely make this recipe again.

For some reason this has become a favorite wherever I go. Poeple love it when I bring it for potlucks. Halfing the butter is definitely a good idea and I carmelize the onions. I also freeze the crust before assembling it so that it isn't as soggy. For decoration on top, I arrange sprigs of dill, sage leaves and pansies - looks great.

Made this dish almost exactly as recipie stated with the addition of a dash of tabasco: fantastic!

I prepared this pie in a 10" tart pan and substituted an Herb Crust (Bon Appetit recipe)for the cracker crust. My guests really enjoyed it. Please note: Herb Crust recipe yields 2 crusts.

I have made this more than once and we love it. Very comforting. After the first time I halved the butter and found it improved the result.

This is simple and really good. I served it for supper with breadsticks, green salad, and a fresh fruit cup . So comforting. I think this will be a Vidalia season regular.

Thought this was good but not great. Very easy to put together & looked lovely, but somehow lacked a certain 'zip'. I used a good-quality Cheddar but perhaps a sharper cheese would have been better. Or even stronger-tasting onions. The flavour of the Vidalias just didn't come through. I served it cold (not fridge-cold, just completely cooled) so perhaps hot is better here. I would make it again but with modifications - if I could decide what these should be ! A dash of hot sauce ? Cayenne ? Suggestions, please.

I messed this one up, and it STILL tasted wonderful. We didn't have ritz crackers, so I crumbled saltines, which worked just as well. I'm not sure why the recipe says you're not supposed to use lowfat or nonfat milk. I used skim, and nothing horrible happened. :) I also only used 1 Tbsp. to saute the onions, and added 1 Tbsp. olive oil. It kept well wrapped in foil in the fridge, and my husband is already asking me when we can make this again!

I put this out as an part of my hors d'oeuvres on Christmas Eve, it was gone in two minutes!!! So easy to make and compliments galore.

This is an excellent dish and when the Vidalia onions are in season I make it. I only use half the butter called for in the recipe, for both the crust and cooking the onions, and it works out beautifully.

I prepared this for my husband, and, this is what he has to say about this dish: the crust was light, and crisp; the flavors of the filling blended prefectly to make a wonderful treat. This is, as he says, a "keeper" recipe. I did add garlic, as I do with most onion dishes and substituted one-half cup whipping cream with one-quarter cup 2% milk, as it was all I had. It was great.

I made this dish for my parents on a recent visit. We all love onions and it sounded very good. It was a big hit and will be a family favorite. I think it tasted even better the next day!

Getting my hair done the day before thanksgiving I overheard raves about this recipe and decided it was the extra side dish we needed for our holiday meal. It was easy to prepare and a huge success with all the various nationalities seated at our table.

Vidalia Onions have recently made an appearance in the supermarkets here. An American abroad, it's always such a treat to find something from home with which to make familiar foods from my previous life. Tomorrow it's onion relish! This pie was delicious. Because I'm a cook, I tweaked it to my taste, but it was more about making the recipe my own than improving on the overall flavour, colour, or texture. Thank you Ms. Mayfield for sharing this recipe.
