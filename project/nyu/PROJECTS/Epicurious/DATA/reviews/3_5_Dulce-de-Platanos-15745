This recipe is just okay. I would skip dessert before ordering it in a restaurant, so it certainly isn't worth the time, effort and incredible mess. If you do decide to make it, be very careful with the carmelized sugar...it's incredibly hot!

This is the best dessert I have ever tasted. My favorite!

Have made this several times and each time to die for even if the carmel didn't quite work. It even tastes good a little burned. Served over vanilla ice cream as wella s panna cotta - very good with the latter.

This recipe came out soooooo delicious. My caramel did not harden when I added the milk mixture...instead it stayed fairly caramel-y. Works for me. I served it over vanilla ice cream and it was absolutely sinful. As the others said, use totally black plantains. Mine were black as could be, no color left at all, and they were just right as far as tenderness goes once the cooking was done. YUM.

I don't know what was up with the other recipe reviewers but even when I made this dish with not-so-ripe plantains (they end up a little hard and chewy) it was still awesome!

try this: fry very black plantains in a lot of butter, then add brown sugar, and some good dark rum. mix together in the pan so the brown sugar melts, and eat it over coconut sorbet.

Very Very sweet. I would make it again with 1/2 the sugar. The carmel making part is trickey, I ended up with a big lump of sugar and had to work with it until it melted. Also no matter how black plantains get some are still hard, make sure they are very very soft.

Be sure to get black as black plantains. The ripe plantains were buch better. I grilled them first by poking holes in the skins with a fork. I had a problem with not having any cream. I substituted vanilla coffee cream and did not add any sugar + more coconut milk and they were still great. I think I would add more rum next time. I served this as a side dish with Caribbean Chicken and it went well. This dish is sweet but I can't see it on ice cream. 15 people snapped it up so it must have been good.
