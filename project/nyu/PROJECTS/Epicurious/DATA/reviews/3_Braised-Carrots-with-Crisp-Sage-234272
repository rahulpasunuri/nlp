Did a test before Thanksgiving and thought it was very good so I will serve. Definitely taste the carrots in each stage so as not to overcook. Perfect and simple!

Best cooked carrot recipe I have made. Kids and adults love it alike--always gets compliments. Be careful not to cook the carrots too much--best when slightly firm. Also avoid using a heavy stock (ie veggie stock) as it makes the carrots mushy.

I have made this recipe twice. I liked the taste very much - subtle. The crisp sage adds some extra flare not typical to any glazed carrots I have done in the past. A nice side dish. Would definitely recommend.

Sounds good but nothing special. Cooking directions are off, too.

What a lot of falderal and it's still just carrots! There are many better carrot recipes on this site. Balsamic Roasted, Moroccan-Style, Sauteed with either Rosemary & Lemon or Red Bell Pepper & Dill or Carrots with Ginger to name a few.

Very tastey way to present carrots. My Easter dinner guests really enjoyed them. There is a small problem with the recipe pertaining to cooking time, not ingredients. After you've braised the carrots - which really takes 15 or so minutes. You should only simmer the covered carrots for a few minutes - not until they are tender, until they are still firm - 2-3 minutes. When you reomve the lid and broil to reduce to a glaze watch the tenderness of the carrots. If the liquids haven't glazed spoon out the carrots and galze the liquid then add the carrots. I did braise ahead of time as suggested and this works well if you're multitasking veggies. 2 min under the broiler will do the trick. Crumple the sage and your good to go. Again my only complaint was they were a bit overcooked - could be me
