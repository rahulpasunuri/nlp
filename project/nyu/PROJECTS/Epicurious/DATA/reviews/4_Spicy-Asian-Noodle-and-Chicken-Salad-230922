Really good! The Udon noodles I found were much fatter than the pictures. Took a couple hours to make but fun! Love a recipe with lots of steps. I think I will add broccoli florets next time and put the cilantro on after tossing. Just looks prettier/

I made this for dinner the other night and it was great. I went with edemame, green onion and carrot. I went with a Japanese ramen noodle for the pasta. I did everything basically from scratch, but if you were in a hurry, you could throw this together with pre-cooked chicken, pre-chopped veg and make the dressing. I would add that you do not need to use a blender for the dressing. I used a regular hand whisk and it came together easily and quickly. No one likes to clean the blender.

LOVED this. Loved it so much I've made it three times in a week and a half. Easy, flavorful, spicy. I actually made it into a vegetarian version with Quorn tenders and veg broth; fantastic.

Very delicious and incredibly easy, especially if you just use a purchased rotisserie chicken. I used 1.5 TBSPs chili-garlic sauce and the heat was perfect for my boyfriend and me. Though it is a hot dish so it's worth it just to be aware of that and adjust to personal taste. The leftovers weren't the greatest; I think this dish is best eaten the first day. Will make again for an easy weeknight meal.

Made this for an Asian themed party recently and it was a huge hit. Added some snap peas and fried up some thin strips of won ton skins to throw on top. Also cut up the noodles a bit so that people could take smaller portions. I actually almost doubled the chili-garlic sauce in the dressing and found that it took the heat very well. But then again I'm a fan of anything spicy. I also might thin the dressing with a little extra broth next time.

Made this with my girlfriend - we substituted low-sugar peanut butter, low sodium soy sauce, tobasco sauce for the chili-garlic sauce (she's allergic to garlic), and left out the chicken broth (oops). It was still fantastic. A good alternative to Thai takeout.

Whew! I know it says "Spicy" but damn...that is spicy! I would only use 1 tb of chili sauce next time. Other than that, it is a keeper!

I made this recipe as written except used a little less pasta than called for because I generally like more sauce with my pasta. When I make this again I will cut down on the chili paste as it is very spicy (even for my Texas palate). I will also substitute shrimp for the chicken next time for a different twist. Will definitely make it again!

This was really yummy! Left out chicken and peppers. Used water instead of broth. Served it as a side to grilled chicken taryaki kbobs. Loved it with crunchy peanut butter, even added extra peanuts at serving. Great for summer bbq's!

I will definitely make this again! The sauce is delicious. (Side note: crunchy peanut butter worked just fine.) I found that adding too many veggies ie: green beans, squash, zucchini and mushrooms washed out the flavor of the sauce. Next time I'll leave out the green beans and add less of the other veggies. The raw carrots, cilantro and green onions were great condiments! Yum!

This was a FABULOUS quick meal for my husband and I. We are not picky eaters, but we are busy people that enjoy fresh cooked meals from our own kitchen. There's something about making your own sauce that makes any dish wonderful. I sauteed the chicken in a broth butter base on low while I prepared the sauce mixture- and we used Buckwheat Udon noodles. Def worth your time! (Only spent around $29 bucks at the grocery store to pick up the odds and ends to make it (since I was out of everything) and we both have lunch leftovers for tomorrow.)Good Luck and enjoy ;)

I made this last night for my husband and I, and it was delicious! I did make a few adjustments, although I'm sure it would be great as written. I didn't have linguine or udon noodles, so I used Rigatoni. I also didn't have cilantro, so I omitted it and used green instead of red bell pepper. I decided, also, to serve this as a hot dish. It was really wonderful! I made this chicken, pasta and sauce first. I saved a little bit of the pasta water and sauteed the veggies in it lightly. I then added the chicken, pasta, and sauce in with the vegetables until everything was heated. Perfect!

This was a tasty & easy dinner--had some leftover smoked chicken--added a cucumber. I used 1 tbls of chili sauce--quite hot enough for us.

I made the sauce to go with an Asian-inspired hot noodle dish. I thought the sauce was alright but could use a little sesame oil to bring in more depth. I tossed it with whole wheat linguine, grilled chicken, blanched green beans, broccoli, kohlrabi and a mix of spicy greens. The sauce stood up nicely to the veggies but would have overwhelmed the noodles/chicken without them.

It was hot today and I had some leftover grilled chicken breast. I had almost everything for this but the green onions and the linguini so after a quick walk to the store I put it together and it was delicious. I cut the chili garlic sauce in 1/2; I like spicy but not atomic, and I didn't use the chicken stock. I agree with other reviewers about the quantity of dressing. I might try honey next time, I thought the dressing was sort of thin but I will definately make this again

Deeelish! I used rotisserie chicken and leftover whole wheat spaghetti. Threw in some tender crisp broccoli and red pepper. I came together in minutes. It was hot but in a very good way. This one will be a regular.

made as written, did whole dressing and 1/2 of everything else, used rice stick noodles. Tasted like cold pad thai - fantastic! would use this dressing to make traditional pad thai. Passed the sriracha on the side. Half of the dressing would have worked though glad to have left overs.

Loved it! I didn't have any chili-garlic sauce so I used 1 TBL Sriracha instead. I agree with other posts - don't use all the noodles called for unless you have 4 very hungry people.

We've made this several times, and it's one of our favorites! We usually cube extra-firm tofu, bake in the oven for 25 minutes, and toss that in the salad in place of chicken...delish!

I made this dish once for my housemates and ever since we have been hooked! Make the sauce as is and you will be hooked...everyone in my house jokes that I should bottle it so that it can go on everything. I like to use rice noodles instead of linguine and I also add in snap peas. Try the meal with shrimp and it is soo good too. I especially like the dish cold...Enjoy!

This was excellent. I didn't have any chili-garlic sauce so I used hot chili sauce. You may want to only use 1 tablespoon of chili sauce as it was a bit spicy. I also used around 6 TB of chicken stock to ge the right consistency.

Rating: 1
I am glad that I tasted the sauce first before adding remaining ingredients. I have tossed only a few dishes in 25 years of cooking. This went down the disposal. Not one person in my family would eat the sauce. I thought about adding the rest of the ingredients hoping it would improve the sauce but could not bring myself to waste the chicken.

This is an excellent recipe and it was loved by everyone who ate it, adults and children alike. BUT: 3/4 lbs of pasta probably serves about 8 people! Next time I'll cut the pasta quantity down to a 1/2 lb and I'll add 3 or 4 cups of broccoli (this recipe calls for a crispy, green vegetable to make it a complete meal.) Yes, it will still serve about 8 people but I think it will be a healthier balance of pasta and vegetables. Other tips: Low sodium soy sauce was healthier and the flavor was excellent. And next time I'll cut the veggies one day ahead of time; this recipe took me three full hours to prepare, mostly due to all of the prep work. But it was well worth the effort!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I added cucumber, celery, and used whole wheat linguine for extra flavor. I halved the soy sauce and used the reduced-sodium kind to cut down on the sodium. I also used crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth, and it turned out really good! I make my own chili-garlic sauce though, so it turned out ridiculously hot, but still great. Looking forward to trying it hot.

I make this all of the time. It is easy to prepare ahead, can be served cold or warm and is even better the next day. It is my stand-by to take to friends who have just had babies or pot-lucks!

I made this for an office potluck - one of the more popular dishes as it was all gone by the end! The spiciness is a great attraction. Two minor adjustments: I cook a chicken breast (large) in water and use that water, after cooling, instead of the chicken broth. Then I shred the chicken breast. Also, instead of using the food processor for such a small amount of sauce, I use the immersion blender. Much easier clean up.

I served this recipe hot. And it was easy...I often freeze sliced green, red and yellow peppers, and sliced sweet onion. I had leftover chicken from a previous meal ans added it to this one. Wonderful peanut sauce, light taste; garnished with cilantro and lime...pad thai tasting, exactly what I wanted!

Loved this recipe! I used linguine noodles, added chili oil, substituted a sweet chili sauce for the chili-garlic, and also used a ginger-garlic paste instead of the minced ginger. It turned out beautifully with zucchini instead of carrots and an added yellow pepper. I will make this many many more times.

Loved this! In fact eating leftovers right now and they taste just as good as last night. I couldn't find the garlic-chili sauce so I used sweet chili sauce and added garlic paste to it. I would added sugar snap peas if I had them -- pretty much followed others suggestions..made more sauce at the end because I thought it needed it

delicious and easy - don't scoff at the use of peanut butter - go ahead and grind your own if necessary (that worked too) - leftovers were even better - next time I will make the peanut sauce a day ahead if I think of it -

I thought that this was exceptional. I read the other reviews and added additional veggies (broccoli and sugar snaps) as well as extra chicken broth. I look forward to the leftovers for lunch.

Mine didn't turn out like the picture at all, but it tasted pretty good. The next day it looked even less appetizing, and tasted just okay. I doubled the dressing, and added a little extra chili, which I think was a good idea. I didn't love the grated carrots, they just got all mushed up. Not a bad recipe though.

Rating: 3
Great recipe. But let's be honest, with all the slicing & shredding, it's not that quick to put together. The recipe as written would probably be enough for four hungry lumberjacks; it's way too much for four normal eaters. But we love leftovers, so that's OK. Substitute what you like but don't leave out the cilantro--I think that's what makes this salad so special.

This is becomming a regular for me. I always have the ingredients for the sauce on hand and the rest lends well to substitutions. I omit the chicken for vegetarians and always toss in a load of vegetables.

This is a new staple in our house. My husband loves anything with peanuts and spice, and this fits the bill nicely. My changes - two TBSP. sweet chili sauce for the chili-garlic sauce, two TBSP. grated garlic/ginger paste (new condiment at my local grocer!) for the ginger, omitted the brown sugar, and made about 1 1/2 times the sauce recipe. Also omitted the cilantro because I didn't have any, and added thinly sliced radishes for a bit more bite and crunch. The beauty of this dish is that it's wonderful hot or cold. I think I'll double the sauce next time, since when it's chilled, the sauce gets a bit tacky. Otherwise, perfect, and great for Texas summer weather!

I've made this recipe twice--haven't followed the recipe exactly either time--and both times it came out wonderfully, which speaks to its versatility. The first time I made it with chicken, ponzu instead of soy, vermicelli instead of linguine, added snow peas, cucumbers, omitted the red peppers. The second time it was made again with vermicelli, store bought peanut sauce, added bok choy & cucumbers. Omitted red peppers again. Would also do well with brocolli instead of bok choy. This is quickly becoming my recipe to use up those bits of veggies remaining in the fridge--and I'm imagining that it will translate nicely to a cold noodle salad for the summer.

Excellent asian noodle salad. Is a beautiful dish served on a bed of cabbage leaves. Would also make great picnic food. The dressing does need more than 3 tablespoons of broth. It should be fairly runny, otherwise the noodles stick. The salad benefits by more crunch. We used chopped cucumbers, but cabbage and/or blanched snow peas would be good. Chopped peanuts are a nice touch, too.

I added about 1/2 c. chopped/ground dry roasted peanuts as suggested by another reviewer and it as a delicious addition. It added great texture.

Great recipe! Easy, fast and very rich in flavours. The porportions of everything are just right. I made it for the 1st time last week and again tonight due to popular demand. This time I tripled the recipe (big family who loves leftovers) and made it a bit saucier. I think this'll be a regular in this house! Enjoy!

I loved it immediately but my husband wanted it hotter. And after he warmed it up it was even better. We didn't cook it so much that the veggies got soft-just heated it up for a few minutes. It was even better hot!

This was a terrific recipe! A couple of minor changes I made - used half the amount of dried ginger in place of fresh; instead of chicken broth, used half water and half sherry; and used rice noodles instead of the linguine. Totally authentic asian taste!

I used rice noodles for this recipe. I considered stir-frying the vegetables and cutting the carrot with a knife, but am glad I didn't. I think the cooking of the vegetables would have made this a cold stir-fry partly instead of a salad and the carrot cut a different way could have made the carrot stand out a bit. The grating was also much faster. I followed the recipe as written except for the red pepper because they were too expensive at my grocery store. The sauce by itself is a little strong, but when mixed with the recipe, becomes just right. I also liked that this dish looked like the picture:.) I will make this recipe again and hopefully next time I will get to add red pepper, I think it would be a great addition.
