Would not use the crawfish again. Will use shrimp next time. The crawfish I found came from China and it was too fishy! Will try it again with some changes.

Delicious. Subbed shrimp for crawfish & added some pan drippings from Cajun Turkey. Subbed red pepper for green.

This recipe is fantastic! I served it over ham and my guests LOVED it. I should note that I made the following changes: I used 1 3/4 cups minced onion, omitted the celery, used 2 minced jalapenos, and replaced the green onion with one minced anaheim chile. Also, I omitted the onion powder from the cajun mix and used only half of the cooked bacon. (I put the other half in the grits dressing that went with this recipe in that issue of Bon Appetit.) I have no idea of why other reviews had such issues with this.

This recipe is outstanding -- but understand it's a gravy, not an etouffee, so sauteing the vegetables in the roux does cook out a lot of their flavor. I agree it wouldn't be bad to saute the vegetables separately from making the roux, but I was fine doing it per the recipe. You don't need any salt at the end. The scallions are a nice touch. I recommend adding another tsp of the Cajun spice seasoning at the end if you like it spicy. It had good cajun seasoning flavor but if you want to have a burn, add some seasoning or cayenne. I used thick slab bacon and it really added texture and flavor. We wanted to use it over grits dressing but opted for rice instead. In a multi-generational Thanksgiving dinner, it was the top dish by all, including picky 8 and 14 year olds.

This was good, and if I make it a few times, I'll get used to the technique, new to me, of sauteing the onion & veg in the tiny amount of roux--it made it difficult to gauge softness. I went by the clock and taste (but I would prefer to saute the veg separately, then combine with the roux). Otherwise nice flavors (might kick up the cajun spice a bit) and the leftovers are great.
