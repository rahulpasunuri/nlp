I made this soup on winter's last (I hope) snowy day. I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand, and couldn't get to the store. It made me realize that substitutions ( or innovations) are what homestyle cooking is all about. In Italy this type of cooking is called "a la Nonna". It's accessible cooking with what's available. Not haute cuisine, not meant to be. I read the reviews on Epicurious to find out what other cooks have experienced. It's a satisfying way to join in the cooking conversation. By the way, the soup was delicious.

I was super excited about this recipe because I love soups and I love borlotti beans from my time living in Italy. However, my whole family found this recipe super bland. I added all of the herbs and salted it well and it was still BORING. For all the work, it was a real disappointment.

Perhaps I shouldn't rate this exceptional since I altered quite a few ingredients - but it has turned out really delicious.Since I had great northern beans, that is what I started with and doubled the dry amount to 2 cups so I could freeze more. Then celery was out and so was the sage and fresh tomato (used 2 cups canned diced tomato). Only had pearl barley rather than farro but I forged ahead using 1 Litre chicken stock and about 10 cups water for the doubled recipe. Used immersion blender to get about 2/3 of the beans and veg puréed. The barley took a bit longer to get to the chewy stage but after adding the suggested parmesan rinds, this didn't hurt a bit.Have served with grated parmesan and pronounced yummy and perfect for a snowy weekend meal.

Cold,windy day in NoVA, which reminded me of times in Tuscany. Doubled the recipe, used Wegmans canned organic cannelloni beans and Wegmans farro. I'm right back in Tuscany.

I found it a bit bland, so at last minute I added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes, the juice of a lime and a bit mroe salt. Perfect, now it's a favorite!

Delicious, savory, filling soup that has made my "go-to" rotation. With a hearty bread makes a fabulous, cozy meal. Added diced red bell pepper because I had it, a double dash of cayenne and 2 bay leaves and a Parmesan rind when the farro was added. Leftovers will be even better!

Loved this one and so did my husband who is very finicky. Will have to make this one again!

This is a delicious, healthy and easy soup to make. I rated it a 3 only because after reading all of the reviews I assumed the original recipe to be a bit bland. I took all the advise from those who made this already and added the following; replaced water with veggie broth, added a rosemary spring and bay leaves, added Kale paprika and cayenne and most importantly- the parmesean rind- that makes such a huge difference in soups!

Made just as it said and it's perfect - wonderful texture, with the chewy farro, and lovely, subtle flavour of the pureed bean soup. I thin it out with water - 10 cups not quite enough - and use veg or chicken stock if I have.

I loved this soup - it is a perfect cold-weather soup, hearty and filling and delicious. I'm always hesitant to provide my substitutions as it really seems to annoy some people, but since everyone else is doing it...I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh, 3 sprigs of fresh rosemary in addition to the other herbs, and I added a parmesan rind and a smoked ham hock with the farro. And I served it with grated parmesan. I also agree with others who suggested adding kale (or spinach or arugula) but I did not and it was still perfection.

This was a really great soup! I did however make a few changes. I used gigantes (giant lima beans) that I pre-soaked, and they cooked up quite quickly - although I also preboiled them with a huge handful of fresh rosemary and oregano. I used a cheese rind, but manchego, not parmesan, and it added a nice flavour. Finally, I also cheated and used about 1/3 cup of my favourite marinara sauce in place of the tomato and then added frozen spinach to finish it off. Really good, you should definitely try this.

Even better when you add 1 bunch Kale, thinly sliced, to the recipe.

Great, and can be made quickly by using canned white beans and bulgar wheat in place of farro

Was home sick and miserable... until made this soup! Had to make couple of substitutions based on what I had in my pantry, but result was flavorful and comforting despite my sick, numb pallet. I used shallots in place of onions, canned diced organic tomatoes, and canned cannelloni beans (added 10 minutes before soup was ready). The entire prep time with chopping and simmering was about 45 minutes. I also used half chicken stock half water. Finally, I did not blend the mixture as I enjoy contrast in textures. In the end I added dash of paprika and cayenne. This soup cleared my nose and warmed my soul! Perfect for the sick little pup like me!

Simple, delicious and healthy - the only modification I recommend was adding parmesan rinds when the farro goes in. It's a very smooth and soul-satisfying soup I am glad to have in our rotation now!

I feel funny rating such a humble soup four stars but I thought it was quite good despite its simplicity. I used homemade chicken stock in place of 8 cups of the water and canned San Marzano tomatoes since it's winter. Next time I'd cook a Parmesan rind with it before blending and maybe not blend all the soup, leaving a quarter of it chunky. It's very filing. Half a bowl filled me up.

Substituted wheatberries for the farro and something seems to be amiss. I've had it simmering for 30 mins and they don't seem to be softening/plumping up. I should have looked harder for the farro.

I revised quite a bit and it turned out delicious. First, tomatoes are lousy around here in winter so I used a can of high quality diced tomatoes which were great. Didn't go thru the soaking nonsense- used a can of butter beans which was excellent. Also didn't put in the blender because I like some texture. Parmesan added was fantastic. would serve with a crusty baguette next time and use broth instead of water. Yum.

It was fun using our homegrown cranberry beans & vegetables for this one. Didn't have celery so I used 3 carrots and only 6 cups of water because I didn't have room for more in the slowcooker. It worked out just fine. It's more like a thick stew this way. Even though I didn't blend it, the soup was almost creamy...I wonder if that was because of the farro.

I made exactly as directed, with Italian barlotti beans and farro. It was good and extremely filling--only one of five us us finished a bowlful. The long cooking of the beans, sage and aromatics gave it a lovely sweet, round taste. But it's still a bean and grain soup--satisfying but a bit homely. Used a stick blender--wouldn't be worth it without one.

an_na- I picked up a package of Bob's Red Mill Cranberry Beans from WHole Foods Market. WHole Foods website says they have several stores in Vancouver, BC. These beans made a wonderful soup! Good luck.

an_na, I discovered that cranberry beans are often called "roman beans" here in NY. If that doesn't help you, try substituting cannellini or Great Northern beans.

I'm trying to make this recipe... I can't find the "borlotti or cranberry beans" in Vancouver B.C. Does anyone know where to find them? Thank you!

I make this soup each winter and love it. I haven't found a closer version of the farro soup I made while living in Italy, and this does the trick. Don't be scared about the farro -- it's just fine to substitute wheatberries (which are easier to find -- and cheap). I recommend using half water, half stock (veggie or chicken).

Cut the time to nothing by using canned garbanzos instead of dried beans. Also just used dried sage and thyme and it still was flavorful.

This was easy and DELICIOUS. I used a canned tomoto and skipped the celery. Cooking time for my famers market cranberry beans was much shorter - less than an hour.

I love farro soup. We've made this but to get a richer broth, use vegetable or other stock and/or boullion to enrich the flavor. Cheese rinds in cheesecloth also help flavor the broth. Finally, homemade croutons on top are delicious!

This is a wonderful soup, healthy and hearty! We added parmesan cheese over the top when serving and that gave it just the right amount of zip.

A very nice vegan soup. It's important to use good Mediterranean beans. I think it needs something, but I can't say what. Maybe lemon juice?
