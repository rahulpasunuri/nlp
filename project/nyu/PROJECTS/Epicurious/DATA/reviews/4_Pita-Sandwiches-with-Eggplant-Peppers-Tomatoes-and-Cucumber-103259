I tried this recipe last night for the first time. I generally cook the eggplant the same way in the recipe as a side dish so I thought I would try it in the sandwich. For starters, I cut the soaking time down with the eggplant and only baked the eggplant for roughly 20 minutes. The eggplant could have been cooked for only 15 minutes. The eggplant got rather brown. Overall I really enjoyed the freshness this sandwich provided. I would highly recommend this to anyone.

The eggplant was a good bit of work, but worth it. The sandwich was delicious. It tasted quite a bit like falafel, and I'm sure it would also be good with a tahini sauce. For those who are pressed for time, I only let eggplant sit about half the recommended time, and it was fine. Could probably skip the waiting time altogether. Only other changes I made were to add some strips of raw green pepper to my pita and to leave out the basil in the sauce (because I didn't have any). One of the best sandwiches I've ever made.

Made as written and loved every bite. Even made for great next day lunch leftovers. I used thick Greek yogurt so I didn't have to drain overnight. And also used Progresso Italian breadcrumbs out of laziness. Next time I'll use homemade crumbs and slice the eggplant thicker.

High fat or low fat this is one of the best unconventional sandwich recipes hands down. We made this last summer to eat on the road on our way to our farm retreat - the kids are still talking about them. The dip is killer. (Just drain the yogurt in cheesecloth in the fridge overnight - you can prep the yogurt several days in advance). Do it all exactly as it says. Try to start early with plenty of time. We packed the components separately and assembled it at the picnic site (which was at the patio of an organic farm owned by a friend).

As the original author of this recipe, it has been fun to stumble upon this site and read the reviews. I haven't made these for a long time, so I think I need to try them again! As for being low-fat, my original comment was that they are lower in fat than a typical hogie. Which they are. And the 1/4 cup of olive oil used is for six servings--80 calories total--lower than most slices of cheese (And most hogies have a few slices of cheese!) You can also use fat free mayo to cut more fat. Thank you! :)

GOOD LORD, what is sooo non-fat about this recipe? Do you know that each tablespoon of oil contains 120 calories and 13.5 grams of fat? This recipe calls for 1/4 CUPS OF OIL!!!!

Excellent recipe. My sweetie said he preferred the eggplant to the usual falafel we have. My modifications to the recipe: I used a piece of pita bread ground up in the food processor to make the bread crumbs, as I did not have french bread. Also, I added a bit of sriracha to the sauce to give it some extra spice. The eggplant is also great on its own, and could be used for the base of a lot of other dishes.

Good stuff indeed. The eggplant was delicous. Even those not too fond of eggplant loved this preperation. Will make again.

I wasn't prepared for this to be quite so tasty...you will never miss the meat! This preparation for eggplant is one I will use for other recipes; it is deliciously crisp without frying. The sauce is excellent too, and would make a good dip for vegetables.

The eggplant was sooooo good, my sister and I almost did not have enough for the sandwiches b/c we kept eating it dipped in the sauce... For the sauce drain your yogurt in a cheese cloth for an hour or so and it won't be runny. We added to sprouts to our sandwiches and it was great. Made these for a luncheon and they were the unexpected hit.

jarred peppers make the dressing rather runny. dry very very well to maintain thickness. Greek yogurt helps also.

Made these for a baby shower where one guest was a vegetarian - they were absolutely the hit of the party for everyone - even the non-vegetarians loved it!

This was a tasty way to eat a healthy vegetable based meal. My "meat and potatoes" husband even loved it. It will be a family favorite from now on!

What a fabulous way to cook eggplant! Hubby loved the whole concoction, I am a lesser fan of roasted red bell pepper. I will probably make a yogurt/lemon/ garlic/ cuke sauce next time. This week, I plan on making eggplant parmigana using this recipe's technique for cooking eggplant!

I made the eggplant up the day before, as well as the sauce. One person complained that there was too much garlic in the sauce but everyone else chowed down (so did he so I don't give his commment much merit). The day of the luncheon I popped the eggplant back in the oven to crisp and warm them. It was great! I served the sauce on the side, tho, so the sandwiches wouldn't get soggy.

Great vegetarian dish -- even my husband who is a devout meat eater found it satisfying. We omitted the mayo for a lighter sauce.

This is delicious...It has become a staple around our house. I added a little lemon juice to the red pepper sauce and cut out some of the olive oil in my quest to reduce calories. It's very refreshing on a hot summer day.

These were absolutely delicious. A great vegetarian sandwich. The eggplant had a really nice flavor and texture and the red pepper sauce was scrumptious. Will definitely make again.

This makes a lot of sandwiches. I added too much garlic -- two cloves instead of one. One clove is plenty even if (like me) you LOVE garlic! Takes quite a bit of time but well worth the effort. Yum!

My family loved this recipe! It did take a little longer than I would have liked, but it was well worth it! Just a note, 4 adults had dinner and we had quite a bit leftover.

I am definitely not a vegetarian, but mad the recipe because I love Eggplant. Wow! What a yummy surprise! I love this recipe so much that I actually crave it at times. Instead of the Red Pepper sauce I prefer a garlicky Tzatsiki to top the pita. I give it definitely 4 YUMS and a thumb way up! Thanks for sharing!

for some reason, this looked much better on paper than it tasted. While not a bad tasting sandwich, I was dissapointed and didn't think it was worth the effort.

This dish took a little longer than I would have liked. (Preparing the eggplant takes a bit.) But the end result makes up for it. It's very tasty and filling!

This is an incredible sandwich. I'm very impressed with the way all the flavors just melded really well. It goes great with some fresh fruit. It is a very hearty lunch. Even my husband was full after his first serving which says a lot!

All my kids are vegetarians. Trying to find something they all enjoy and something that I can make while also preparing my dinner is a feat. This is a wonderful dish for lunch, dinner and snacks with friends. I also serve a cold Gaspacho with corn and black bean salsa. Thank you so much for this easy, light, quick and tasty recipe.

This dish is very good. I will make this again and soon. All the flavors come together. It is good for a lunch or for a light supper.
