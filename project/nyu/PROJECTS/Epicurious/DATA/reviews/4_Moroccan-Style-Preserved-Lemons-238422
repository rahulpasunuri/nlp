I have a Meyer lemon tree that isn't even in high production mode yet (my friend's tree puts out hundreds - I only have dozens so far) and I was looking for a way to use them other than to juice them and freeze the juice. I didn't have a 6 cup jar, but I have a lot of pint canning type jars so I used those instead. Just doled out the lemon wedges into the jars (this recipe gave me 3 pint jars, but my lemons were HUGE), divvied up the remaining salt/juice mixture, then added some lemon juice I had previously frozen from juicing a previous batch of lemons. I put the jars into the microwave (uncapped) long enough for the brine mixture to boil then slapped on the caps. Am looking forward to using these treats in my future cooing endeavors!

Fantastic. Organic Lemons are a must .Especially because you eat the peel. Same recipe on this site Gourmet 2008 for Moroccan Preserved Lemons except it calls for 10-12 lemons

I've been making these for years now. I make huge batches of them and put them into the glass canning jars with clip top covers. My mother has so many wonderful lemons, it's a waste to let them go. I give jars of these to my middle eastern friends. They love all things brined. This keeps forever in the frig. My friends tell me that it's all better after a year in the jar but I'm still thinking that one over. Fun to do with small round eggplants too. To get more juice from your lemons, stick them in the icebox overnight and let them thaw in the morning. They will release much, much more juice. I only do this for the juice I need...not for the entire dish.

These are a staple at my house. I use a sliver of lemon (brushing the extra salt off) in place of salting dishes - they add an interesting citrusy dimension to just about anything.

These lemons are great cut into small pieces and added to any salad. I also add them when cooking chicken, along with green olives (or no olives). GREAT!

You can't go wrong with this recipe. What I like is the olive oil. It helps create a boundary between oxygen and the lemons themselves. I noticed the recipe called for 5-6 additional lemons for juice. I found it needed a few more lemons than called for to fill the 6 cup jar. I realized why theny wanted fresh lemon juice rather than store-bought lemon juice. The store-bought kind has PRESERVATIVES. Therefore, your "preserved lemons" would not break down and become soft like they're supposed to do. Every time you need an acidic/salty kick, use these lemons! Be careful about adding additional salt to a dish because the lemons are S-A-L-T-Y.
