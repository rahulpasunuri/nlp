Instead of using commercial tapenade, I made my own from the recipe on your "Morrocan Carrot and Goat Cheese Sandwich." I used green olives stuffed with garlic. It was a hit!

We altered this recipe so very slightly! We thought that using one cup bruschetta would make this dish way to salty for our taste and also, bruschetta might have over power this dish. So, I used only 1/4 cup brushetta, did not salt the pasta water either, I followed rest of the recipe very closely. For a little twist we used Lemon infused fancy sea salt to lightly cover the tuna and fancy tri-color pepper as well as lemon grind, pressed all that into the fish gently. Wow!!! This made an amazing tasting tuna fish. The arugula that we used was so very slightly bitter and using fancy lemon sea salt as a finishing element bind all together nicely and gave it a debth. End result was FANTASTIC ! We love sea food pasta dishes and this is a winner. This was very fast and great flavors.

I loved this! It was so delicious and easy. I used whole wheat pasta and thought it was great. I took the other reviewers' advice and didn't add the oil. I just put some of the oil from the sundried tomatoes into the tapenade when I made it in a food processor and it was plenty. I will definitely make this again!

Really good. I took suggestion to make my own tapanade with stuffed green olives, parsley, garlic, sun dried tomaties, olive oil and lemon juice. Then just sliced the tuna thinly and threw it in. great

I'm not a huge anchovy fan, but I figured I'd give this recipe a go since it seemed simple and all the ingredients were on hand. Between the olives, the capers and the anchovy,I could barely choke this down. All I tasted was salt and fish. My guy thought it was ok, but he didn't ask for seconds and that said a lot. I'd never make this again, but for others, I'd recommend rinsing the capers and the olives to temper the salt and considering how much anchovy you'd really want to taste.

Looking at the comments of other cooks, I made this recipe without using any oil in the pasta. The olive bruschetta had a fair amount of oil so that encouraged me even further. It turned out perfectly! I will be making this often. A good company dish!

This recipe was excellent, fast and easy. I used whole wheat fettuccine for the pasta. I am not a huge fan of whole wheat pasta, but it works well in this recipe, and is what I had available. I did not add the extra olive oil since the tapanade I bought seemed to have a lot in it already, but I did have it on hand just in case I thought it was needed after tasting the final dish. I think more oil would have been too much.

The flavor of this recipe is greatly enhanced if you make your own tapanade. Get some pitted olives from the olive bar at the supermarket (I use a mixture of several different kinds), add some sundried tomatoes and fresh herbs and olive oil and hot pepper (optional) and put in the food processor. I add walnuts for the texture as well.

This was incredibly easy to make, but just ok. The pasta was pretty bland. One of the bruschetta choices at our grocery store contained feta, and I wonder if that would have been better.

Very easy and full of flavor. Definitely would cut back on the olive oil. Couldnt find green olive tapenade at Whole Foods, so I went with Kalamata tapenade which worked out nicely. Would also be good with grilled chicken instead of tuna. Pine nuts sound like a great addition--I will have to try that next time!

Very good- I did not think the pasta needed extra oil. The olive tapenade had plenty. Definitely would make again-

Fabulous! I made this for my wife on Mother's Day because it sounded like it had potential. I expected it to be good and it turned out to be great. I might add a little more lemon next time but otherwise made it as shown. Easy, healthy and delish.

This is incredible! I made this for our anniversary, and my boyfriend and I both agreed that this was the best thing I've ever made! (Which is saying a lot - I'm in culinary school and cook for him all the time!) I couldn't find the "Green Olive Bruschetta" that is called for (even at a specialty store like Central Market) so I went with an olive tapenade instead. I also added some toasted pine nuts over the top of the dish. I will DEFINATLY make this one again!
