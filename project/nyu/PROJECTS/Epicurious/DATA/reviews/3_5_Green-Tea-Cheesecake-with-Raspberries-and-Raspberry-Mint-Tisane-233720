Couldn't get the fromage blanc, but my local cheese store recommended a mild goat cheese. Worked fine. This recipe was so easy and turned out beautifully.

Made this with 1/3 fat cream cheese, matcha green tea (used more than called for) and mascarpone cheese. Excellent. Different. Pretty. Will make again. (Did not make the tea this time)

One of the best cheesecakes I have ever had! Every single person who tried it raved about it unique flavor and gingersnap crust. I added a little crystallized ginger to the crust which gave a wonderful strong ginger flavor. I couldn't find the green tea powder so I just bought tea bags and ground up the mixture. It gave the creamy cheese cake a little more texture. Also the tisane was great but needed to be strained. The berries are lovely presentation but after 7 minutes too much debris fell off the berries and sat at the bottom of the pitcher. I intend on making this many more times (my friend has even asked me to make a version of this for her wedding cake).

I made this & it was great! We even got in the spirit & tried it with a couple of different teas to see which one worked best -- our favorite was Cherry Tea! http://tinyurl.com/bez333

Hi, I have yet to try this cake as I got confused with one part... What exactly is a roasting pan? Is it something like a steamer, bain marie or double boiler? Is it even necessary or will baking this normally yield acceptable results? Otherwise, can anyone please suggest how I should be baking this as all I have on hand is a springform pan and a fan forced oven =) Obviously I am hoping for the cake to come out green and not brown from overbaking Much thanks ;)

LOVED this recipe. I could never find fromage blanc so I substituted marscapone and the results were utterly amazing. Be sure to make the tea, it really completes the entire dessert.

Made this for an Asian dinner and paired with plum wine (not the tisane). Looked very pretty decorated with split lychees with a raspberry in the cneter of each - like flowers. Using the fromage blanc gave it a rich flavor.

This was the best cheesecake I've ever made! I followed the recipe exactly. The red and golden raspberries looked absolutely stunning on the light green cake. The texture was pretty light and creamy, not your typical dense NY style. Even people that were skeptical of the green tea flavor when they saw it ended up loving it.

I followed the cook from grand rapids advice and made a 10" cake. However, instead of marscapone I used ricotta. Also, with only 1 cup of sugar the cake had too much of a green tea flavor (I used cooking/ingredient grade matcha green tea powder, so perhaps the flavor was too strong). I made another version of the cake and increased it to 1&1/4 cup of sugar. Much better! I only baked it for an hour and 10 minute, and the cake had very soft texture. Bake it a bit longer for a firmer cake.

Here are my adjustments to make a 10" cake for a larger group: 1â…“ cup ground shortbread cookies (about 8 ounces), 3 8-ounce packages cream cheese, 3/4 cup mascarpone,1 c. sugar,4 large eggs, 3 teaspoons Japanese green tea powder. It was a big hit in the small size but even bigger hit (and easier to serve) in the larger size.

I've made this recipe a number of times now, and I have the following to say (besides it being great): 1) I prefer using oreo cookies for the crust with a little bit of butter, and bake it before filling it up -- but only for 10 min. 2) I used fresh raspberries and poured some torini raspberry syrup on top and but that in the friedge for an hour -- it really gave it a boost. The combination of the oreo cookies and raspberries, both mutes the taste of green tea, but also gives the cheesecake itself a great taste. Everyone loves it, and it will definately be one of my signature ddishes.

Instead of 2 tsp of green tea powder, I used almost 4, and had a very green cheesecake. I substituted ricotta for the fromage blanc because it was cheaper and readily available. I would definately make it again.

I expected this to taste like green tea ice cream. It does not. I will make it again but with some changes. Such as make the crust from scratch! And use 1 cup of sugar to bring out the flavor a bit more.

Wonderful! We had a big party and several desserts. Everyone was talking about this one. It was very easy. I didn't make the tisane, but just served it with lots of fresh Raspberries. It was one of the first ones gone! They all wanted more

I love this recipe!! I've yet to find the correct Green Tea Powder. My cake has never turned out the lovely mint green. But, always tastes great!

Cracks deveoped in the cheesecake and the color was a toasted green. Sour cream garnish and rasberries hid that, but the taste was just fair.

This cheesecake was so easy to make and everyone loved it! I used Lorna Doone shortbread cookies, and did use the fromage blanc, which I found at Whole Foods. I was not able to find matcha powder, but used the contents of 4-5 "Lipton 100% green tea" teabags, and it had a lovely pale green color and good green tea flavor.

The cake was very satisfying. I used ricotta instead of fromage blanc and three teaspoons of green tea powder. The raspberries complement the green tea flavor perfectly. This is a great way to incorporate antioxidants into a dessert. It looked so vibrant on the table everybody made room for a slice.

Delicious and a definite repeat. My husband and a guest both agreed and asked for a second serving I don't understand the recipe's admonition not to use light cream cheese -- I substituted Neufchatel with no problem (though I did use the fromage blanc as called for). I purchased the green tea powder at a local Asian grocery, Uwajimaya, who also sells this through Amazon.com).

Lovely cheese cake! Thanks for introducing a green tea dessert. I recommend to use green tea powder with good quality. If you use good green tea powder, 2 tea spoons should be enough for wounderful flavor and green color.

My favorite cheesecake ever! I agree with Vancouver - you really need to increase the green tea powder to at least 4 teaspoons to get a solid green tea flavor in the cheesecake. I added the egg yolks in, but I whipped my eggwhites separately to stiff peaks and incorporated them in at end. The texture of the cheesecake is light to begin with, but adding the eggwhites separately will increase the height of your cake. Try to get the fromage blanc if you can - it's well worth it! I like to top it with a simple raspberry sauce - you'll get raves anywhere you bring it!!!

It's easy to make and it's good. Light, yummy. Used ricotta instead of fromage blanc which I couldn't get. We used blackberry for the tisane. It went well with the cake.

Made this as the cake for a Japanese-themed b-day party. Substituted mascarpone for fromage blanc, so turned out very rich and yummy. Didn't have any green color, which would have been nice. Also, instead of tisane made a sugar syrup with the berries and poured over the top of the cake before serving.

This cheesecake was very good and very easy to make - the crust especially. We couldn't get our hands on fromage blanc, so we used creme fraiche instead and it worked beautifully. The green tea flavor was very subtle (we used tazo green tea from the bags and ground it a a coffee/spice grinder). If you can get your hands on it, I think this recipe would do well with a very floral green tea, especially Jasmine and it lends itself to being served as small slices/squares as part of a tea party or as a finger food at a cocktail party.

This was the creamiest cheesecake ever! My grown daughter and I made it once with Stash brand green tea bags and once with Stash brand Chai. The result each time was subtle, but delicious. The cheesecake wasn't green, but I like the natural color better. There's nowhere close to get fromage blanc, so we substituted ricotta in one and plain yogurt in the other. We hung the ricotta and yogurt in cheesecloth a few hours to drain off some of the moisture. I imagine you could do the same with sour cream and get a similar result. We loved it.

I made a few changes to the original recipe, and this is now my favourite cheesecake ever! First, use high quality green tea (such as Japanese Matcha)POWDER, not ground "tea bag", and I use about 20-30mL for the maximum green tea flavour. I omitted fromage blanc, since I couldn't find it, but the cheesecake came out velvety and not too fluffy, not too rich! I also reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, and it became the perfect recipe.^^ I've already made it more than 3 times, and always gets requests from ppl!

I had high hopes for this recipe, especially since I enjoy green tea so much. I prepared this using a high quality sencha green tea powder. The finished product was fluffy, but very dry. Also no resemblance to the attractive light green color as shown in the photo. I did compensate for the baking time, and temp. since my oven is forced-air convection. My husband and I each had one piece. The remainder I froze hoping that I could salvage it somehow. The crust however was very good and I'll used that for another recipe. Very disappointing.

Excellent!

I thought this could have used a bit more green tea flavor. I used high quality tea from bags but maybe the green tea powder would be more flavorful. I will experiment with the tea to find the perfect mix. I love green tea desserts though so I will be making it again.

This was surprisingly easy to make and so delicious! Like green tea ice cream, the taste was very subtle but distinctive. We loved it! I couldn't find fromage blanc so I used mascarpone instead. Yummy!
