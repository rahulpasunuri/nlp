I think the flavor is probably ok if you can solve the slush problem. I'm going to try salting and draining the cucumber and draining the whey from the yogurt. Lot's of work for what should be a simple recipie.

The flavor is really nice, but the consistency... even with salting/draining the cucumbers, it was still quite slushy and does NOT make for an attractive looking salad. I would probably go for this type of dressing on meat/falafel rather than salad, and then make a heavier consistency like tzaziki. So not much left of this original recipe.

I love greek food and this salad dressing I'm sure will be right up my alley. Just one suggestion to those who thought it was "sledgy" that can happen with cucumbers. When I make Tzatziki I always grate the cucumbers salt them then let them drain in a colander for an hour or two. Squeeze out excess water then add to my yogurt mix. It makes all the difference. So delicious and will keep for days without getting watery.

Yuck! It was bland and the texture was awful. As another reviewer put it, it was 'slushy'. Don't know what I could do to salvage this one.

A variation of Tzaziki, with the wonderful addition of the feta. I would add a half tsp of lemon to bring out the flavors more, since the cheese is salty enough. The dressing is quite good on kebabs and falafal as well. The only problem I've found is that the consistancy is rather slushy, but I used less yogurt and more cucumber to minimize the fat/calories, so bumping up the yogurt component may help that.
