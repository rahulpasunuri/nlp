I made this dessert not long after the recipe appeared in Bon Appetite...I got raves for the dessert then, and I've been getting requests to make it again from guests who were at that dinner. I am going to be making this again to surprise them later this week. To my recollection, the custard was good, but the candied cranberries were phenomenal!

This is my favorite dessert. I made it for Christmas 2005 and can't wait to make it again 2006! I love how the cranberries taste, crunch, sweet and tart. And the bourbon gives the custard a wonderful extra layer of richness. I learned the hard way to be careful when dipping the berries, though. The moisture in them can turn to steam when they are put into the syrup and spatter. Next time I will use skewers instead of toothpicks, as I still have a scar! Was worth it though...(-:

I have made this a couple of times already and am about to make it again. It is delicious and the candied cranberries really make for a beautiful presentation. Highly recommended!

I can't believe I am the first to review this wonderful recipe. It is so very, very good. I loved how easy it was and the carmel recipe was a snap, loved the no stirring! My husband and I love creme brulee, but to do the sugar with a blow torch, or put back in the over under the broiler has not worked well. This is better and the leftover carmel pieces on a plate with coffee tastes wonderful, as well. So when your guests scoop out that last bite of creme, bring out the leftover chips to enjoy with their coffee [yummy]. It looks so very photographic, very elegant, and takes no effort.
