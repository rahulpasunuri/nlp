This is NOT Pho soup, or even a weight watchers twist on Pho. SELF should post a recipe for blackened New York strip steak, except use chicken, and not blacken it. That's how ridiculous this recipe is.

The chef used on here, Tien Dinh, did not write this recipe. Whoever posted this is fake, and the recipe is obviously not real pho. Tien Dinh works at a very high rated restaurant in Las Vegas and has no connection to the person who posted this and used his name.

i hope this recipe doesn't match the picture's depiction of how it should look because if so, THAT'S NOT PHO.

We made this last night and found it to be very tasty. We are by no means "pho" connoisseurs, but we do know how to enjoy food and appreciate different takes on recipes, traditional or otherwise. Interesting though how the name is more the hot topic here than the taste. I personally recommend the taste.

This is one of our favorite recipes. It is light, healthy, favorfull, and easy to make. It is a regular at our house.

Okay, we all know this is not authentic Pho, as I believe Pho is made with beef broth, and even chicken Pho is technically not authentic either. (Still has beef broth, but with chicken meat- in case you are wondering) But everyone on this site should be aware that Self typically takes traditional recipies and tries to up the health value and reduce fat/sodium/calories. You are under no obligation to use this recipe if you don't like it. It's on this site to provide information for someone who may like to try making a healthier version of various recipies. I agree, maybe a new name should be in order, but don't critize a recipe because it's not what you think it should be. This space is intended to be helpful to those that are truely interested in a recipe to see what others have to say about having made it. Otherwise, your comments are a waste of space.

A light asian inspired soup.. but NOT pho

Looks like a modest, pleasing asian inspired soup. However, it's most certainly NOT pho. As for the person who was calling other people names.. get a grip.

Has anyone actually tried this recipe?

I might try this when I don't have time to make the traditional beef broth. There is a variety of Pho, some made with chicken or even fish broth but the beef broth is my favorite by far. I guess there is a recipe for every taste. I posted my own Pho recipe here: http://www.hellodaly.com/2008/05/recipe-for-pho.html. Please feel free to comment or if I've left something out.

Absolutely NOT an authentic Pho recipe. But it does have nutritious ingredients, so was worth a try. Although, I agree that SELF should consider changing the name, as it is blasphemous to call this soup Pho.

This is definitely a great recipe... It has some typical thing Pho has, and it's also got some healthy things Pho has. In my eye it's a great twist on an old favorite

Perhaps faux pho would be a more appropriate name for this dish.

I never rate a recipe without trying it but this "pho" recipe sounds terrible. I agreed that it should not be called "pho." Traditional "pho" is made with beef but you could have great chicken pho too. I tried both versions when I was visiting Vietnam. The picture can't even make the dish look delicious... How sad!

dwalter from Portland Oregon... This is obvioulsy not typical Pho, but it is a healthier version than the typical sodium rich, fatty broth that leaves you bloated for days. People like you obviously have way too much time on their hands to go out of your way to write a nasty review on food. Maybe you're dumb not to open your mind and try the recipe. There ARE several types of Pho, not just the beef version you have tried.

Agreed! This is not Pho...But it sounds like a very tasty soup and I intend to try it.

What the Pho!? This isn't pho but an asian inspired soup.

I have not made this either and it is possible that it could taste good, but I am Vietnamese and find this very offensive. It should not be called pho. Is it possible to change the name???

I am not going to enter a fork rating since I have not made this recipe and I typically hate reviewers who don't make the recipe and write a review but this is not even close to a real pho recipe. Among many of the differences, real pho is made with beef broth and various cuts of beef for meat. There are no snow peas, carrots, or red peppers in any pho I have ever had or made. Oh and Low sodium broth uhhh I don't think so! Normally this is a salty broth which is part of what gives it its delicious character! Part of this salty flavor comes from Fish sauce which is not even a part of this dumb recipe and critical to a true pho broth taste.

Pho is made either with beef (Pho Bo) or chicken (Pho Ga). They are different in flavors and ways of preparations. Vegetables and herbs are added as options.

Take this recipe off of the site. Traditional pho cannot be made in 10 mins. My family would be very upset if they saw this recipe.

Isn't pho almost always made with beef, not chicken? And I've NEVER seen it with snow peas, carrots or bell peppers. For something more authentic, try the recipe on this site simply called "Vietnamese Beef Soup." It is a much better version of pho (although I would use some chicken or vegetable stock in place of the beef stock).

There are many variations of this cler soup. Here ie information from Wiki. Phở is served as a bowl of white rice noodles in clear beef broth, with thin cuts of beef (steak, fatty flank, lean flank, brisket).Variations featuring tendon, tripe, meatballs, chicken leg, chicken breast, or other chicken organs (heart, liver, etc.) are also available. The broth is generally made by simmering beef (and sometimes chicken) bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, and spices, taking several hours to prepare. Seasonings include Saigon cinnamon, star anise, charred ginger, cloves, and sometimes black cardamom pods. The noodles, called bánh phở in Vietnamese, are traditionally cut from wide sheets of fresh rice noodles similar to Chinese Shahe fen, although dried noodles (also called "rice sticks") may also be used. The dish is garnished with ingredients such as green onions, white onions, coriander leaves (cilantro), ngò gai (culantro, or long coriander), Thai basil, lemon or lime wedges, and bean sprouts. The last five items are usually provided on a separate plate, which allows customers to adjust the soup's flavor as they like. Some sauces such as hoisin sauce, fish sauce, and the Thai hot sauce Sriracha, are popular additions as well. The herb ngò ôm (Limnophila aromatica) is sometimes added as well.

No fish sauce? Sprouts? I do prefer the chicken to the beef, but I thought traditional Pho has beef.

This is miserable. Pho is one of the greatest foods on the planet, this is a ridiculous chicken soup for dieting food haters. Go to your local asian market and tell them you want to make Pho. The rest will follow.

I agree with "A Cook" This is an Americanized and poor adaptation of true Pho.

Good lord, this isn't pho! SELF sucks, there must be some corporate tie keeping their recipes on this site. If I wanted diet recipes I'd head to Weight Watchers.

Traditional Pho Ga doesn't have carrots, bell peppers, or snow peas...

Good and light! Just make sure the noodles are cooked to your desired level (recipe said 3 mins but I thought it was a little under cooked altho my hubby liked it). But overall, great recipe!
