This is really delicious. My husband can't eat sugar so I skipped the sugar and added an envelope of sugar free peach jello (It is Great Value from WalMart - makes 2 cups)to the onions and the result was spectacular!!!!!

A keeper with minor modifications. As recommended by others, definitely cut down on the sugar and butter. Half or less on the sugar. No need for additional butter when making the gravy-- just strain some of the fat from the pan to mix with the flour. Also I put the browning skillet right into the oven-- saves dirtying a pan. Otherwise followed the recipe closely and it was delicious. The sherry vinegar adds, so don't substitute if you have access to this ingredient (Whole Foods has it).

Haven't made this yet but I just got a bunch of sweet onions from my CSA. Has anyone tried freezing the compote?

Really great recipe. Next time we will reduce the sugar and the cooking time was too long. For the sweet onion compote, I used Red Onion Confiture, which is imported from Italy. It was perfect. I found it in the cheese department at Whole Foods.

Chicken contains three times the fat of a small hen. Thus the gong show. Great traditional recipe. Thanks!

Yeppers, this is delicious. The gravy is terrific! You don't need all the butter and you certainly don't need all the sugar. I think a note about chopping the onions finely would be helpful. Also I wonder about using the same pan to fry the hens and to roast. One less pan to clean but more importantly you keep all the dripping together. I had to use water to deglaze the roasting pan in order to have something to add to the frying (sauce pan). But it all came out superb! What a shame those little cornish hens are so little - we had to pick them up and eat them with our hands! Highly recommend!

Wonderful, got raves from a dinner party of 10! The only change I made was to reduce the sugar in the sherry vinegar sauce to 1 tablespoon. The combination of the sauce and onions made the dish. Halving the hens worked very well.

Fabulous! The sauce was delicate and the onions were sensational. Try this recipe!

What a disappointment. After reading the reviews I thought this would be great. It's not. The onions are good, but I'd like them better with some thin slices of filet of beef--room temp. The sauce is too piquant. The chicken is lost in the recipe thanks to too much handling. My stove is a mess, I have a bunch of pans to clean up and I walked away from the table thoroughly disgusted. Skip this recipe. Unless it makes you feel better to spend a lot of time to create a dish that isn't totally forgettable--you'll remember how much time you spent for so little gratification!

Tasty meal (made for Thanksgiving), but my game hens stuck to the pan when I was browning them, so the visual effect was slightly underwhelming, as they don't brown in the oven at all. I thought the recipe made a ton of gravy, and would have preferred less gravy and more of the onions. Everyone loved the onions; I'll probably make them alone at some point for a different meal.

I love this recipe...have made it a couple of times already. It is simply delicious. The nions and gravy add so much! Yummy...Will continue to make it.

This is quite good but I cut down on the sugar in both the compote and the gravy by half. This is nice for a change of pace.

I served it family family style with the sauce on the side, as I found it too sweet and didn't want to impose it upon my 9 guests, most of whom passed on it. The onions were nice, but most guests passed on them too! Next time I might use less wine (used a Shiraz/Cab blend). I'll definitely try the onions again, modified somewhat. No complaints on the hens though!

The onion compote was amazing. Be careful though that you only use 3 tablespoons sugar with the onions. I made the mistake of using 6 and ended up having to add 3 more cups of onions to dilute it. This actually turned out well since the onions really reduce down after 40 minutes and everybody wanted more compote. The sauce is also excellent. I tried the brining technique for the hens and it worked wonders. Fairly easy to fit in a pot as well since they were already quartered by the butcher. I've heard of people brining turkey before but can't imagine a pot big enough for a 20 pound turkey, never mind a fridge that could fit it. I served the hens with garlic mash (a nice savory complement to the sweet compote) and a good bordeaux. Can't wait for a chance to make it again!

Pay attention: you only use 3T butter & 3T sugar in the onions - the rest is for the hens. Use a good wine for the compote - nothing too young, nor too acidic. Stunning compote. Best yet. You could even up it a bit with the addition of some rosemary in the reduction (take it out before serving). Hens are perfect quartered - to the reviewer who halved them: they cook more evenly quartered, and present better stacked. Serve with a medley of roasted root veggies (celeriac, turnip, carrot, etc.), endive salad with gorgonzola and a pot au creme at the end. STUNNING!

I followed the recipe exactly and after the first forkful thought I had been transported to Paris with a full accordian orchestra. A lot of time in the kitchen, however, a very special dish and I recieved more bravos with this dish than many I have prepared. Excellent!

I really liked the combination of flavors - I served it with mashed potatoes and green salad. The flavors are mild and I typically prefer stronger spices, but it seemed to work here. The onions didn't need 9 Tbsp of butter - made it rather oily. I didn't have sherry vinegar and mixed plain sherry with balsamic vinegar instead.

This is a superb dinner party main course! My guests raved about this dish - they were still complimenting me over the phone the next day! I served the hens family style, with the onion compote and sauce on the side, to make it easier. Also, I made the compote the day before, and it reheated just fine. Another little trick - I always brine my game hens - makes them much more tender and moist.

The sauce for the hens was extremely vinegary. It was not balanced in flavors. The onion compote was sweet and the sauce did not work with it. Made it exactly like the recipe. The hens did turn out moist and tasted good. But would not use the sauce and the onion compote together.

Wow! This was excellent! I did not have any sherry vinegar on hand, so like others, used half sherry and half balsamic vinegar. The sauce was delicious and very easy to make. The onions were a great side--would not do without them. And the chicken was crispy on the outside and very tender. The presentation is also impressive. Will definitely make again soon.

very tasty, and not difficult, but I didn't pay enough attention to how much last-minute prep there was going to be! Love those onions!

I only made the onion compote but it was delicious! I used it as a topping for small polenta rounds that I baked and served as an appetizer. Everyone at my party loved it.

This dish was excellent. My husband and I absolutely loved it. I did not have the sherry wine vinegar so I substituted with red wine vinegar and a splash of sherry. I Served this with rice pilaf. A great combination. Would definetly make this again!!!

Fabulous. Great. Very straightforward and easy to make for a dinner party. Everyone loved it and the onion compote and sauce are both wonderful and unusual. I servied it with the wild rice and mushrooms recipe on epicurious and used a mixed rice blend instead.

This was spectacular.The meat was so tender you could eat it with a spoon and the onion compote was one of the most delicious accompaniments I've ever had with any dish. It would go well with almost anything.

Substitued Red Wine Vinegar with a dash of sherry and it turned out excellent. The compote was very good.

Flawless. I used 1/2 each of white wine and basalmic vinegars as I had no sherry vinegar. A definite large dinner party entree for the nervous, it took no time to prep and cook. So few really good recipes for Cornish Hens out there, this is a keeper.

My husband and I both loved this, both the hens and the compote. The skin on the birds was very crisp and delicious. Will definately make this again.

The onion compote makes this dish. I used a merlot based bordeaux for the wine, I also doubled everything as I served it to 11+ guests. I dont agree that the hen should be served halved. The quartered hen placed diagonal with compote center provided a nice display. I served rice pilaf to one side and lemon buttered asparagus spears on the other side of the hens. Also, if you cannot locate a sherry vinegar right away (I couldnt) spend some time searching for it as the richness of the sauce depends upon it's strength. For the wines I served a 1998 Pinot Noir (france) and a 1999 Pouilly Fume' (france) Sorry if including wine seems a little over the top, but, to me, a great dinner without a complimentary wine is only a good meal.

Let the onions cook! They become a sweet and smooth sauce that compliments the hens. Excellent!

We just had this for dinner. What a treat. I roasted the hens longer than required because I like all poultry really well done - probably about 1 hour total after the browning. I used red wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar and skimmed the fat off juices before adding into the sauce. The sauce is sublime. Very, very nice. I will make again for a fancier occasion. And I think I will serve with a rice or wild rice pilaf instead of the roasted potatoes - it seemed like it would lend itself more to rice than potatoes. The onions take some time but are simple and a really nice addition - don't leave them out.

Very very good, not hard to make but a lot of clean up - two saute pans and a baking sheet. The onion compote was delicious, tasted a little like sweet cabbage but a lot better. I didn't have to cook it nearly as long as the recipe says, so watch you don't overcook it! I also made a plain couscous side dish, which was great for soaking up the sauce. I halved the game hens instead of quartering. I thought it would lend itself to a more elegant presentation, and I think I was right. Just cook in oven for five more minutes to ensure doneness.

What a wonderful recipe! This is one of the best dinners I have made a long time. I was a bit hesitant about the sugar in both the sauce and the compote, but I added it anyway and I'm glad I did. Don't skip the compote! The subtle sweetness of the compote and the tang of the vinegar in the sauce go beautifully with each other and the game hen.

Definately a 4 forker here. Simple yet elegant, which to me personally, is the height of haute cuisine....(but then who knows? I am from Idaho) :)

This recipe was fantastic. We needed to substitute quail since our butcher was out of Cornish Game Hens. And the cheese shop recommended a nice chevre for after the main course. Our French friends enjoyed it immensely!

This recipe is wonderful! I served it to my mother (who has a degree from a French culinary school) and she's requested that I make it again twice. It's a very elegant dish, but fairly simple to make. It's a great dish for impressing someone special without spending hours in the kitchen.
