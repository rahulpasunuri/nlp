Simple applesauce made luxurious. The browned butter gives it complexity, and the rosemary adds an astringent hit. Loved it. Will make it again. And again.

I will never make applesauce without this recipe again. I wrapped the rosemary in cheesecloth, so I could pull the sprigs out easily when I was done.

Delicious! I used Sage instead of rosemary. Like most reviewers, I just peeled apples so there was no need to use a mill. The butter gives it a decadent edge. Terrific to eat just plain.

I had this at a Seder dinner in 2009 and it has been on my mind ever since...it is that good. I made it tonight and I am so excited to share it with everyone at a latke party tomorrow. I didn't have rosemary so I used Herbs de Provence (dried and in a bouquet garni ball) and the taste is ethereal!!

This recipe left my apartment deliciously fragrant and my tastebuds satisfied. The browned butter is a great touch! A few alterations: I used apple cider instead of plain apple juice and ground cinnamon instead of sticks. I used a medley of different types of apples and peeled the skins beforehand. The rosemary sprigs I had on hand were unfortunately dried out, and I did not taste the rosemary in the final product. I'd suggest sticking to fresh sprigs.... Also, I did not find the sieve/milling to be necessary (as long as you peel the apples beforehand!). The sauce stirred up well in the pot with just a fork. Finished sauce was a perfect, soft, and slightly chunky consistency. Great warm or chilled.

Wow, this was amazing. The browned butter adds great flavor and the rosemary was very subtle (in a good way). I ended up just separating the skins and rosemary out after cooking, without using a sieve or a mill, since I didn't have either. I will make this again!

Unique preparation worth trying. The rosemary imparts a delicate flavor. I used 2 tsps or so of dried rosemary needles off the sprigs, which I tried to crush finely, but I wouldn't do that again. The tiny bits of rosemary that didn't incorporate into the applesauce were jarring to the palate! If fresh rosemary isn't handy, I will bouquet garni the dried herb, and remove as directed.

Unbelievable flavor! My 6yo and 8yo ate thirds with dinner. Admittedly, I left out the rosemary, because I was worried they wouldn't like it. Will definitely add next time.

This is a fantastic recipe. I didn't have a food mill so I just peeled the apples before cooking them and then ran them through a blender at the end. I also added two pods of cardamom while cooking and removed them before blending. I will definitely make this a fall tradition.

Wow--amazing with latkes. I peeled the apples first but then skipped the milling/sieve step to keep some texture. Awesome!
