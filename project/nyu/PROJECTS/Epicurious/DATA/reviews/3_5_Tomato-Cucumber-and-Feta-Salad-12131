Excellent - light and fresh. I suspect that people who say that it's bland had boring tomatoes; I found some really nice, fragrant tomatoes at my local store, but if they don't smell like anything, they won't taste like anything. I also used a strong mountain feta. Next time I'll use an English cucumber so I don't have to peel it.

I only gave this one 3 forks because although it was really delicious this recipe relies on the best tomatoes and fresh basil. So when your garden is bursting this is a great way to highlight those tasty gems but if you have to go to the grocery store for more than just a cucumber and some feta don't bother. I also doubled the dressing as some other reviewers did. I will definitely make this again (during tomato season of course)!

I prepared this salad following all the directions.It was perfect.I added a small amount of sliced ripe olives.It was a yummy accompaniment to grilled shrimp. My husband gobbled it right up even though I tripled the recipe.

This has been an old stand-by for years for my family. I triple the olive oil, red wine vinegar, and sugar, and am very generous with the fresh basil. My preference is to use English cucumbers and brick style Feta with this recipe. It is a sure sign of summer when this is served at our house, and we often pack it for picnics.

I used honey instead of sugar. Yummy salad!

I've been making this salad since 1992, and it is so refreshing, different, and colorful! I will take some of your advice and add Kalamata olives. Yum!

My family thought this recipe was terrific. I think it would also be good with Kalamata olives and with one anchovy ground into the dressing. But, it was delicious as is:-)

I make minor modifications: increase red wine vinegar to 1 tablespoon and olive oil to 2 tablespoons. If you don't have cherry tomatoes available, regular seeded tomatoes can be chopped up and used successfully. A nice addition: chopped pitted kalamata olives. Nice change from the typical cucumber and tomato salad!

Thanks to the cook from New Jersey, I used regular tomatoes - not quite Jersey ones which I remember from living there for several years - which were quite good. The suggestion of the English hothouse cucumbers worked well too. The fresh basil was wonderful. This dish is easy and quite good.

Loved it. Was looking for something to serve with last minute and this was perfect. With chicken brochette and mediterranean rice dish. A hit!

Yawn. Leave out the sugar, increase the vinegar, add some Kalamata olives, and it might be interesting. Maybe.

Good stuff. Used English hothouse cuke (unwaxed, so didn't have to peel), and it added color to the dish. Also used Jersey tomatoes, which did add a lot of liquid, but no problem--drained a bit and served with a slotted spoon. A delicious and easy salad.

i did the balsamic thing and also cubed avocado as an additional "vegetable" and it came out perfect!

Very nice salad. I substituted Gorgonzola for Feta because that is what I had on hand. I believe this a great basic salad and you can add whatever you like e.g. sliced scallions, herbs etc. feta

Sure, I'd make it again, but not with olives or raw onions. Not really my thing. Maybe some fresh tuna or grilled shimp. A simple, tasty salad.

This was a hit at dinner last night. My husband who is not a real fan of cheese really enjoyed this. I used a cracked black pepper flavored feta and grape tomotoes. I also used a bit of balsamic vinegar as well as cabernet sauvignon wine vinegar. Also added some diced red onion as well. A great addition to grilled meats or fish. YUM!

This is a quick and easy salad to put together on short notice or when your short on time. I prefer to use white wine vinegar and gave it a touch more than a teaspoon. Kalamata olives gave it a little more edge but it was great without them too.

With a few modifications, this is deserves a rarely worthy "4 forks". Red onion, a combo of balsamic and red wine vinegar, and a huge helping of fresh basil do the trick. If you added red/green pepper, you would have an fabulous Greek salad. I also used Grape tomaotes rather than cherry - they are less acidic and more like mini Roma tomatoes. It's so fast (one bowl) and requires minimal prep work!

Made this recipe for 4th of July cookout. The family loved it! Added diced green pepper, diced carrots, and red onion. Quickly became a favorite!

This is basically a Greek peasant salad (xoriatiki), and I make it all the time- I use very red tomatoes from the farmer's market, and sprinkle on some Greek-style seasoning. It's wonderful if you add some black fleshy kalamata olives, definitely some red onion, and serve it with warm pita bread!

I've made this dish several times for family and friends. It's always been a big summertime hit. Goes well with anything off the grill!

Good basic recipe, but needs pizazz. I added red onions, carrots and green bell pepper. I also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. Turned out good!

Thought it was quite good -too much for 2 servings - cut back on vegetables by 1/3 and use balsamic vinegar in place of red wine vinegar

Not very interesting. On the bland side.
