We call this recipe "The Love Salad" at my house because we love it... and because it's a bit of work as salads go, so we make it for those we love. I prepare it as written, but have substituted bacon for the ham and purple onion finely chopped for the shallots. If you're pressed for time, try using your favorite ranch dressing to dress this salad. You will love it, too.

This would have been a tasty salad but I used Swiss chard, which wasn't the greatest choice. I think spinach would have been wonderful. I love salads that mix cooked and raw additions along with plenty of seasoning along the way. The buttermilk I thought was perfect for getting the pepper to stick to the leaves.

Just delicious. I even saved the dressed salad leftovers and had them for lunch next day. About applying the kosher salt: Just sprinkle and toss, sprinkle and toss, sprinkle and toss.... A thorough rinse, gently turning the spinach, under a spray faucet works well. I didn't find that the buttermilk added much; it could be omitted. By the way, an 8-oz. package of savoy (crinkly) spinach yields about 12 cups.

To save time, I used "Super Greens" from Organic Girl. But any loose braising greens would work as well. This was delicious and easy. A good hearty salad with grilled steak, but would be equally good with a bowl of soup.
