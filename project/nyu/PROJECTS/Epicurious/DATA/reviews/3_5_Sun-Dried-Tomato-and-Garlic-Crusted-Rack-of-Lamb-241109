Don't forget to sprinkle plain feta on top when you plate the dish!

I made the pesto 5 days in advance and the flavors were spectacular. I followed the cooking directions exactly and I agree with the previous poster about the doneness which is why I gave this recipe 3 forks. The meat was too rare and the pesto didn't get crusty. I would put the pesto on earlier and let the meat cook just a tad bit more so that it's pink but not raw. Paired well with a Spanish Temperanillo. I will make this again because it is a good change from the traditional French style lamb that I always make.

This was delicious. Sunday dinner has never been so sweet! Sundried tomato mixture was totally balanced with the lamb. Will make again. Served with a 2000 Hermitage from the Provence region in France. Perfect pairing.

Very tasty lamb and also had left over crust, but thats great@! I do however like my lamb a hint more cook, but thats just a minor adjustment on my side, so otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

I left the "crust" very chunky and added feta cheese. After the chops (I couldn't get racks) were completely cooked I added the crust to the top of the chops & let the meat rest. I'll make it again!

I see a lot of comments about this taking a long time but I disagree. I made this from start to finish in about one and a half hours, and it was pretty simple. I'm not a chef, never been to cooking school but simply followed the very easy recipe. It was delicious and everyone LOVED it, fresh lamb is key. Also, after making the pesto I realized that I can get one so similar it's scary at a local Italian market which would have saved those that complained about half the cooking time they spent making it. Overall, deliciously wonderful and easy!!!

This was worth the time (and the dishes)! The sundried tomato garlic mixture was awesome. I'm planning to use the leftovers on chicken.

This recipe was great. It took about one and a half hours, but there was plenty of time to prepare side dishes and such during the different stages. I will definitely make this again

Also, I think you can use the sun dried tomato pesto over pasta the next day.

This was delicious, and although I would love to eat it again, the recipe took much too long. Four chefs cooking this dish took several hours.
