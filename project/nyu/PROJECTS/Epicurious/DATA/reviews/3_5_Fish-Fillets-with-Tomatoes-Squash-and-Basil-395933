We've made this a few times, both on the grill and in the oven, usually with halibut, and we love it. Easy, light, and fresh! It makes me crazy to read reviews when people leave out the wine and/or basil and complain of no flavour - of course! You left out crucial parts!

Made with some variations; very good. Used 1 whole yellow squash, 1 whole zucchini. Used whole shallot. (Also had extra piece of fish - 1/3 pound cod filets from thin end.) Instead of basil made with thyme and tarragon (3 parts time X 1 part tarragon) Instead of wine used fresh-squeezed whole lemon and half (cara cara) orange juice. Added green cubanelle pepper and red pepper. Black pepper on top. Needed ~5 more minutes baking time (probably because of extra veggies).

Very bland, despite using cod and a really good olive oil. Followed recipe but left out fresh basil. Lovely presentation but lacking in flavor. Luckily my bread was good!

Made this the other night and it was a hit. Light, fresh, and delicious. I didn't follow the recipe exactly and rather eyeballed how much of everything to put in, but it turned out great! My husband, who doesn't like fish that much, loved it!

Took twice as long to cook! Veges were overdone when fish was done. Mot much flavor...did it with cod and no wine or basil. Any ideas?

This was so good, easy, healthy, quick. Love it. Will do it again.

A couple of additional notes: I made it again with cod and it was really great. Adding wine this time did not make a significant different. A bonus of trying this recipe is that it has minimal cleanup, a big plus for this working mom!

This was absolutely delicious. My children loved it! Super easy to make. I used halibut--fabulous combo. I will make again with cod. I left out the wine because I didn't have any and it was still great. I'll be sure to use wine next time--I suspect it will be even better. Used fresh zucchini from the farmer's market and basil from my garden. Simple, quick and delicious.

This is very good. Used Tilapia, and baked in oven. Needs to be tarted up a little more with spices.

I'm making this tonight! Any suggestions about changes to make if I'm using frozen salmon? (Couldn't find fresh!)

Fun to make and serve. Pretty. Nice flavors but nothing spectacular.

Very simple and delicious. I didn't have shallots so I added a little garlic in with the onions - under the fish. The couple of fillets I put garlic on top of were a bit strong. Cherry tomatoes, zucchini and basil from the garden, with the cod made an excellent combination.

Used halibut and it was delicious. To A Cook from Alamogordo: To make a packet, layer everything down the center (long ways) of the parchment, instead of one side. Then pick up the long sides of the paper and fold them together several times until they are fairly tight against the stuffing. Twist each end, again until it is tight, and fold under the packet. Enjoy!

This was a delicious and super easy weeknight dinner. I followed some tips from the other reviewers. I added 2 cloves chopped garlic, some fresh thyme, and a dash of cayenne. (I probably would have left out the cayenne because it was flavorful enough). We didn't have squash, so I used some green beans from the garden. We put it on the grill. The recipe said add water if cooking on the grill, but I just added a little extra white wine. I will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe for three reasons: Easy, quick and healthy! I did it on a gas grill and it turns out perfect every time. Debra

Delicious, quick and easy. I did not have any squash, so I used haricot vert which were fabulous! I'm sure it reduced the amount of liquid in the packet, but did not affect the cooking time or flavor.

This was absolutely delicious! I added zucchini, yellow squash, grape tomatoes, mushrooms, shallots & fresh basil from my garden. I sprinkled the vegees with herb seasonings, salt & pepper & then put Old Bay on the cod; I wrapped it all in foil packets & put on grill for a few minutes...my husband said it tasted like a restaurant meal! Very healthy also; this one's a definite keeper.

Just made this tonight for dinner. My husband could not stop raving I was so tasty and so easy.

I've made variations of this many times but always walk away with a Blah after...It's dull and bland so suggestions from others to zing it up make sense. Of late I've been dicing up garlic, fresh thyme, fresh oregano in olive oil as a marinade so I'm thinking that would work really well here too..It's not too garlicky but packs a punch..I make my own herb infused olive oils so try to use that in the marinade. Agree that it's healthy and nothing wrong with that these days plus good summer dish with little clean up if done on a grill - in that sense this recipe is a keeper!

Very easy and tasty recipe. I made this with cod and put it on the grill in heavy foil packets. I added herbes de provence for some extra flavor. Fish cooked beautifully and it made a really nice broth. Put the whole thing in a shallow bowl so the broth was not wasted. Easy weeknight meal.

Healthy and full of flavor. Why can't restaurants make healthy delicious food like this??? I added a few extra ingredients for some additional flavor: fresh thyme, chopped garlic and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper. I also used diced red onion instead of shallots and chipolte olive oil. I used tilefish which held up perfectly in the parchment wrap. Yum!

I don't understand how to close the packets. Can someone tell me why you put the squash in a single layer on one side of the parchment paper and then pile everything else, except the tomato halves, on top of them. Do you roll the packet from one side to the other, and then only crimp the last two edges at the top? How would this be a sealed packet? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

This is similar to a June 7 Sole En papillote with Tomatoes and Olives, which I rated excellent in my file and noted to cook again. I am going to prepare this new recipe with the squash and want to know if using parchment makes a difference in the flavors of the meal vs using foil. I find it difficult to do the crimping with my arthritic hands. pbailey

While the specific wine pairings are figured out, I would not hesitate from a good Sauvignon Blanc or a Viognier.

What a terrific looking recipe. I've done fish in parchment many ways. This is so new I've not tried it yet. Everone has great tips and comments. I like "A Cook's" from Pittsburg. When I do this, from my experiences, I will add some herb (basil) while cooking, then open at the table and add fresh. The scent will really be nice - fresh tarragon should also be a nice idea.

Delicious and very easy to make. Beautiful presentation. Great served with a simple rice and steamed broccoli

This recipe was fresh and delicious. I used tilapia and jazzed it up a bit with some citrus pepper before baking. I also used citrus olive oil and drizzled a bit of balsamic vinegar over the fish before serving. For me it would have been a bit bland without the extra flavors.

This was simple to make and so delicious, a perfect summer weekday dish. "10 thumbs up" from both kids, ages 6 and 8.

I made this using foil on the grill on Memorial day 2012! Great recipe, easy prep and great flavors. Make sure to eat it the European way, though (taking one bite with a little of everything -- tomato, squash and fish). Eating it the American way (one item at a time) leaves the fish tasting bland.
