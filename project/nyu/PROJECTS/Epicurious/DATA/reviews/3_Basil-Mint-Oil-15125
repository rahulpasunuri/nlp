to the cook in nashville, i think the salt in the recipe is meant to be used in the blanching water to preserve color not to be added as a seasoning at the end.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I questioned the large quantity of salt. Therefore, I reduced it to one teaspoon at the beginning, thinking I could adjust it to taste. It was still overwhelmingly salty. Surely, this is a misprint. A half teaspoon would be plently. Otherwise, the color and body of the oil were fine.

Again, I don't understand why the other reviewer didn't like this recipe. This oil is fresh and delicious and is the perfect companion to the lobster, corn salad. Definitely try these recipies.

Awful, a waste of good ingredients and much too much of it when you have nothing else to do with the remainder. YUCK! But I guess some one had to be the first.... Don't be the second!!
