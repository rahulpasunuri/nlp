I was going to make these brownies again in the future perhaps. They tasted chewy and pretty good. But my resident food tester (husband) said 'don't make those fruitcake brownies or whatever they were.'

I had my doubts about these, but made them because of the positive reviews. Big mistake ! The cream-cheese topping never did firm up, which made cutting them into bars really hard. The icing was soft, messy & overly sweet & the brownies rich & 'cakier' than I like. I thought it was a weird combo & will never bother with this recipe again.

Suspicious of this recipe's name and ingredients, tried it based on previous reviews. And am I glad I did! Surprisingly delicious. Didn't have figs on hand, so doubled the apricots. Didn't have unsalted butter on hand, so used salted. Still outstanding brownies.

I found this a nice change from the usual Christmas fruitcakes and cookies I make during the holidays. Also a colorful addition to my holiday cookie trays that I give as gifts.

An excellent recipe, which lends itself well to modifications; for instance, I added golden raisins rather than the suggested dried cherries or currants. Another hint: try melting the chocolate and butter in a small glass dish in your microwave. I found that this worked very well; experiment with your microwave to see how much time is needed. I have a 650 watt microwave. The chocolate and butter melted in about 2 minutes. I thought these brownies were very easy to make, and very tasty. The final vote of approval came that evening, when I took the pan of brownies to a local contra dance; they disappeared within 10 minutes.
