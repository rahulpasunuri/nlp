I have actually had this dish at the Red Cat in NY and they add some chili flakes as well so this recipe isn't accurate.

I made this tonight with an heirloom zucchini from my garden, picked mere moments before cooking. It was delicious, the pecans really brought out the nutty taste of the zucchini. As with many simple dishes, the quality of the ingredients is key.

My entire family loves this simple, yet very tasy dish. The carmelized pecans give it a wonderfully sweet taste. To keep things simple I just use pre-packaged chopped pecans and pre-packaged fresh grated parmesan.

Very simple and taste is great! Love the taste of the pecans with the zucchini.

Yummy! I have made this with zucchini alone, but love the addition of carrots, also cut into matchsticks -- brings out the sweetness in the pecans.

I loved this recipe! Slicing the zucchini on a mandoline was quick work, and the toasted pecans added a nice crunchiness and flavor to the dish. I will certainly make this again.

These was quick and delicious.

Boring, ugly and blah tasting...and I added a bit of seasoning!

Nice simple dish - we served it with a spicy southwest pork dish and a spicy green rice dish and it balanced the meal well. Our guests said they would make it also.

This dish was okay. Certainly nothing to brag about. It was a little bland for all the chopping necessary.

A very nice nutty accent to zucchini as the beurre noir and pecans complement each other

I love every ingredient on its own, but when you mix them together the result doesn't look good and doesn't taste good.
