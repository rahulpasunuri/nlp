I was pleasantly surprised at how well these muffins turned out. The fact that they are made with applesauce and egg whites lowers the fat content, although you wouln't guess it by the taste. The recipe is so simple and enjoyable, I'm sure I'll make them again. (I made 6 regular sized muffins instead of mini muffins.)
