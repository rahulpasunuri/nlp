This was JUST perfect! I now made this recipe a few times and substituted parsley with thyme. I also added a splash of bacon schnaps to it. Personally, when I make mussels, this is pretty much the only recipe I use. For those who are skeptical about the water, the mussels contain a lot of water and open up, releasing the water, it makes for excellent flavour. I scoop up the sauce with baguette.

Easy, delicious, beautiful presentation. I had to re-read the receipe and verify that the mussels do go into a dry pot. Don't worry, it works perfectly. The sauce is so simple but the taste is complex. I will make this again and again.

Excellent recipe! My husband and I LOVED it! Made exactly as described with the exception of adding a splash of white wine to the sauce. Was surprised at not having to add water when steaming the mussels, but it worked just fine and had a decent amount of cooking juice when steaming was complete. Ate with crusty bread which was nice and would have it that way again, however next time (since there was so much sauce) we are going to remove the shells and toss the mussels and sauce with a pasta for a different twist. This is definitely a wonderful dish that I look forward to making for guests! It is sure to be a hit!!!

I was skeptical about putting mussels in a dry pot, but they were moist and tender. I thought being able to reduce the sauce after cooking the mussels made it more complex and flavorful. My 3 year old licked his plate. Don't be scared to try it!

No review, just a question. Do you add any water to the pan to cook the mussels? It just says to place them in pan, cover and cook over high heat. Shouldn't there be a liquid?

Out of site! A big hit!! The sauce is so good with toasted crusty italian bread!

So easy and delish! I halved the recipe (for an appetizer for 3 of us) and added some dry white wine. Served it up with sliced & toasted seeded baguette (just broiled a cookie sheet of them for 2 minutes). Out of site! Maybe I'll add crushed red pepper next time! This recipe is a keeper!!

My first attempt at cooking mussels and must say I'm delighted to find such a delicious recipe first try. Quick & easy; we enjoyed a fun dinner with salad and baguette. Thank you to previous reviewers for wine idea. I will try next time!

My favorite restaurant for mussels recently changed ownership and it's menu, so I was thrilled to find this little gem of a recipe. I did take some advice from previous reviewers - white wine, crushed red pepper, etc - and it was really fantastic. Serve it with a leafy salad and a fresh loaf of bread and you have a great meal!

This is an excellent appetizer or snack, and so incredibly simple and quick. I added white wine instead of lemon juice ( I was too lazy to find a lemon) and it was way better than any restaurant version I've ever had.

I have made this on several occasions and now use half the butter and add olive oil. The white wine suggestion by a previous reviewer makes the broth even better. The crusty bread is a must!

I found that 3 tbsp of butter with a little olive oil (to prevent it from burning) is PLENTY. When you return the mussels to the pan, add a splash of white wine, and there'll be more than enough juice to mop up with good bread. Also the slivers to lemon peel add an interesting bite - overall, an exceptionally simple, but outstanding recipe!

The recipe is really good as is but the second time I made this, I added diced tomatoes, crushed red pepper and served over pasta.

OUTSTANDING...EASIEST THING TO MAKE...warm crusty bread is a great with the sauce...

This was so delicious and easy!!! We used the leftover broth and put it over pasta the next day! I thickened it a bit with some flour. Even my six-year old loved it.

I know mussels are easy but I've always just ordered them out because my favorite restaurant has such a great sauce - and I was thrilled to find that this recipe is equally amazing! I added some white wine (mmmm) and next time the only thing I'd do differently is decrease the shallots.

What could be easier? I've never seen anything devoured so quickly at my table. I'll experiment with other recipes but this has become my stand-by.

This is the mussel recipe I will make forever. Every Christmas I try a different mussel recipe. This one was a hit. It is so easy and so tasty. I have made it several times, and everyone loves it.

This was so good that even the non-mussel lovers devoured them. We served these as the first course of an Italian dinner and paired it with paesano bread from Zingerman's and olive oil. I am sure that we could have made a meal of these. On a side note, I could not find fresh mussels, so I used frozen on the half-shell (from New Zealand) thawed in the refrigerator over-night and they worked great.

Awesome! We served this for a dinner party on New Year's Eve and we couldn't get enough of it! Good thing we had lots of bread, the sauce is really good!

I wasn't able to find fresh mussels, so I substituted fresh shelled shrimp. It was a huge hit at our wine tasting party. This is too easy to make. I'll add this to my repeat book!

This dish was fabulous and I think I will make it again with grated parmesan cheese.

This was an incredible recipe! So simple to make, and it was delicious. I would highly recommend giving this one a try. Just make sure you have some bread to soak up the remaining butter. Excellent!

This was excellent! Will definitely make again and double the liquid next time so we will have more to enjoy sopping up the bread with.

Excellent, tastes like its from the kitchen of a gourmet seafood recipe.It's the first mussel recipe that comes close to what we have in our favorite restaurants.

This recipe was very garlicky and tasty. Next time I would only use 1/2 the shallots as I found them a bit overpowering. Very rich.

Marvelous for Mussels and excellent with Clams. Just add a little dry white wine for clams.

I am a mussel man, I prefer mussels to clams any day. This is one the best ways, I have found to enhance the natural flavor of mussels with a lemon and garlic sauce.move over Mr. Clam.

This is a wonderful recipe that provides restaurant quality results with minimal time and effort being invested. The ingredients were wonderfully proportioned and I wouldn't change a thing. Excellent!
