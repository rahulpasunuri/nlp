I followed the recipe exactly, and this salad is terrible. There aren't nearly enough other flavors to mask the overpowering bitterness of the black radishes. I now have a bowlful of lemony black radishes sitting in the fridge, and I'm pretty sure no one in this house is going to eat it. Wished I'd saved the radishes to use sparingly in other dishes instead.

so simple and so delicious. a refreshing pallet cleanser. i might have added a little more lemon than it called for, but i'm not sure.

I like the combination of black radish with fresh ginger - the heats are rather complimentary and the acid of the vinegar has a neutralizing effect in any case. I continue to experiment with the black radish!

A great, different salad to which I added 2 oinions finely chopped and fried. This made for an almost Russian version of the dish.
