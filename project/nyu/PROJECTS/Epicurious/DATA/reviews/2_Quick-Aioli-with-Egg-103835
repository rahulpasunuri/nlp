I made both this and the egg-free Classic Aioli. Both were good, but this one was more like a mayonnaise and I thought that the Classic Aioli was better as a sauce with a range of vegetables. I would make this again to serve with artichokes.

Surprisingly easy for this to come out with the right consistency. However, cut the garlic in half or more... this is WAY too garlicky, and I know very few people who would eat it as is.
