Blech. Sauce is overpowering. Will not be making this again.

A simple summer BBQ side dish. I followed the recipe to a tee and it is good--both earthy and bright. Don't skimp on slicing the green onions ultra thin. I did mine on angles at the ends and they were an elegant contrast to the shape of the mushrooms

I forgot to mention that I don't actually grill mine, I just cook them in a pan on the stove. They taste excellent that way!

This recipe is SOOOOO GOOD. Just make sure not to put in too much ginger. Made the mistake of doing that once or twice and it tastes AWFUL. But otherwise, one of my favorite recipes on this site!

These mushrooms were good! Just be sure to watch them carefully since they cook very fast on the BBQ.

Really good! Used the ridged grill pan, since the bbq grill was too crowded with fish, and couldn't get big shiitakes. Simple too.
