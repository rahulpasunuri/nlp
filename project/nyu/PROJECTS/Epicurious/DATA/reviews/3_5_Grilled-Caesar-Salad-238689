A nice twist on the Caeser salad. The salad serves up crispy and still warm and very flavorful. We will add more garlic, and also Worcestershire sauce and double the dressing recipe. The bread slices soak up dressing and the recipe as described comes in on the dry side. For those of you who don't like the garlic flavor, don't even try to make a Ceaser!

This is a fantastic summer salad, and incredibly quick and easy. I used one heart of romaine, split, for the two of us the first time. That disappeared so quickly that I made one heart each the next time, and we still devoured it all. I used 1 tsp anchovy paste (total) for the two fillets. The dressing tasted a little 'off' straight from the blender, but it married up perfectly with the wilted romaine. We will be having this often with grilled chicken or steak.

Overall I really like this dressing, loved it's lemony flavor, but I felt like it was missing something. The second time I made this dressing I added about 1/2 cup of freshly grated parmesan grana padano, wow amazing! I just brushed my bread with olive oil before grilling it then took a fresh garlic clove and rubbed it over the warm bread before slicing. I really like serving the grilled Romain half, whole on the plate and letting the guest cut into it. This salad is also really nice topped with fresh chopped garden tomatoes or smokey bacon.

The dressing can be very strong, like the technique but will look for a different dressing to suit my tastes.

We enjoyed this. I also had something similar at a restaurant. I kept the romaine in half and did not slice when serving. I did not have a baguette so used a nice thick 12 grain bread. I prefer my caesar dressing on the garlicky side. The next time I make this I will add a bit of anchovy paste and garlic to the dressing. Loved the croutons!

Of all my dinner party items this little salad gets the most repeat requests.

One of my favorite restaurants serves a grilled Caesar that's just amazing, so I guess it's no wonder that this doesn't quite compare. I would suggest either allowing the lettuce to cool completely before chopping, or to serve the heads of lettuce whole and allow people to chop them (like my favorite restaurant does). I might try this again with that in mind because it is nice how it can be prepped ahead of time.

i have now made this twice. i added two extra cloves of garlic and nice big splash of worcestershire sauce to enhance the flavor. we are anchovy lovers so I drape a few atop the heads of romaine along with some tasty garlic croutons. it has been added to my list of regular salads!!

Superb!, I used 3 anchovy fillets and 3 cloves of garlic for a bit more bite. The dressing absorbs a lot of the flavour and tastes even better the next day.

Perfect. Fun. Tasty. Imaginative.

Quick and tasty. I wasn't sure I'd like the romaine wilted, but the grilling adds just a hint of smokiness, and it's great that you can do it on the grill while cooking other things.

I've made this 4 times since it appeared in the June issue. It's really wonderful and so easy to do when you're grilling other food. Don't change a thing!
