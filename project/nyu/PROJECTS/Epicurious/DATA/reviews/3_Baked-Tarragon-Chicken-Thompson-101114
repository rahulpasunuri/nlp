Tender moise quick. Substitute crema mejicana for creme fraiche. Cheaper and tastes better. 4 pounds of boneless skinless chicken tenders exactly fill one layer in glass 9x12. Salted the chicken for a couple hours prior. Makes a great looking dish direct to the table.

This is a favorite recipe in our house because it is quick, easy and delicious. I have made this recipe a dozen times. I substitute sour cream for the creme fraiche. I have made it with chicken breasts as well as skinless boneless chicken thighs which work quite well. The sauce is very runny but for a weeknight meal we aren't really that concerned. The brown rice I serve it on catches most of it and the sauce that escapes the rice ends up flavoring the veggies that share the plate :) Next time I will try adding corn starch to the sauce as other reviewers did.

This was pretty good and certainly easy! I have a busy life these days with a one year old so I need easy and tasty. If you like tarragon this is a great dish. I used the plain yogurt as suggested by a previous review and it was fine. As for it being watery, well yea, but who cares, the flavor is infused in the chicken and the chicken is moist! Serve the plates up in the kitchen and present to your guest.

Excellent considering the few ingredients. For two half breasts, I used 1/2 cup creme fraiche, 1 generous tsp Maille dijon (not big on mustard), 1 Tbsp or so of fresh chopped tarragon and a good splash of chardonnay (all I had), and a few grindings of pepper. All that went into a small ceramic baking dish, just big enough to hold the chicken, and baked for 30 min., middle rack. The chicken was cooked with just the barest hint of pink, tender and juicy. The sauce consistency was, well, like sauce, not southern gravy. The taste was great and went well with wild rice cooked in chicken broth. The recipe did not call for salt, but I pre-salt all my meat and chicken whenever I can the night before, so my chicken was seasoned. The comments about the dish being bland were probably due to lack of salt.

Not sure what it is that I do not understand about some of the reviews, but I made this recipe for two and adjusted the quantity, but did not vary ingredients other than substituting dry Marcela wine for sherry as I must have drunk what was left of the sherry from the last time I used it. The recipe was delicious and we will do it again. Served it with brussel sprouts sautéed in garlic olive oil with the slices of browned garlic added back in at the end. Soooo Goood.

I get the best results when I use small chicken breasts and I don't serve the pan juices because the chicken is moist and doesn't need a sauce. Wild rice and baby peas are the sides I like with this dish. My thanks to the cook who used fresh tarragon, what a great suggestion!

I have to agree with the other reviewer - the sauce became very watery after it was baked and the chicken was tasteless.

Quite good and super easy. I cut the recipe in 1/2 and used fresh Tarragon (1 heaping tbs for three half breasts). Also couldn't find it premade so I made the creme fraiche 2 days before. Also easy and yummy.

this is a great dish for a Saturday night when you don't have time to cook but you want to serve a real home-cooked quasi-gourmet meal. I used an oven-proof non-stick skillet. I sauteed 1 lb presliced mushrooms, 2 garlic cloves chopped and 1 med onion chopped in oil and butter. Then I added the rest of the ingredients and the chicken. I browned the breasts first which was a mistake because even though I only baked for 20 min, they were overcooked. Next time I will use boneless, skinless thighs. Also used 4 TBSP fresh tarragon chopped which was too much. Next time I will use the dried (not as potent) or only 3 TBSP fresh. I served this over fettucine and made all the sauce for only 3 half breasts. We like a lot of sauce.

Substituted plain nonfat yoghurt for the creme fraiche, and it worked fine. Tons healthier, too.

Only fair; sauce was watery after cooking; chicken was not rteally soft and tender; I won't do this one again. Jim

When I cook, I like to try new recipes all the time, but this is one I just keep coming back to. I get rave reviews every time. It has such sophisticated flavors, yet it is impossibly easy to make. The chicken always comes out tender and juicy--in the words of one of my friends: "You can cut it with a spoon!"

Made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a little disappointing. Think I'll keep looking for a better recipe when entertaining.

I added sauteed mushrooms as did another cook, and I took the advice of a few reviews and used a bit of cornstarch for thickening purposes. I thought the recipe was delicious. I also used chardonnay that I had already rather than buying a bottle of sherry...that was at the advice of my boss who is a wine expert and said it would work just as well. I halved the chicken breasts as there were only 3 of us, but I made the full amount of sauce, and I used fresh tarragon. It was delicious.

I thought this recipe was boring. I even added mushrooms and extra spices. I love tarragon and sherry, but there is definitely something missing from this recipe. I don't know how I would even improve it.

Very easy to make, but rather ordinary. I have too many other easy and much tastier chicken recipes. My family agreed that this is pretty good, but I shouldn't make it again.

This was quick, easy and delicious. I served it with sauteed mushrooms and polenta, and the whole meal took 45 minutes.

I used skinless bone-in chicken thighs instead of the breasts. I let the chicken marinade in the mixture for a couple of hours. As suggested by other reviewers, I substituted the creme fraise with light sour cream, added a little cornstarch and added sauteed onions, garlic and onions. I also used grainy style dijon which gave it a nice texture. Because I used the thighs, it took a lot longer to cook than the 30 minutes - more like 45 at 375 degrees. I served this with Near East Roasted Garlic and Pecan brown rice. It was a terrific meal!

I read found this recipe today and made it tonight for dinner - so easy! So delicious! I grow tarragon, so I used fresh, and it was perfect. This is one of those "easy-to-memorize" recipes that's worth remembering.

We make this dish frequently and my family loves it. The only change I have made is to sauté diced onions and sliced mushrooms in about 1T butter using an oven-proof skillet. After the mushrooms have reabsorbed their liquid, I add the rest of the ingredients and bake uncovered according to the directions. Delicious, easy and fast -- a winner!

I am the queen of the fast chicken entree. This one has got to be one of the best and easiest. I just substituted light sour creme for the creme fraice and a blend of peppers for the black pepper. I baked the chicken at 350 for 30 minutes and and then turned it down to 150 to keep it warm for antoher 30 minutes. It was great.

First time my 5 yr old son has ever liked chicken that wasn't fried or in nugget form. Didn't have creme freche so used heavy cream. Pounded breasts until uniform and only baked 25 minutes. Served with steamed brocolli and rice pilaf. Very easy week night meal.

I've never made a sauce that tasted anything like this, and everyone loved it - plus the chicken was so tender. I used thighs instead of breast and had an issue with the chicken not being cooked after 40 min. (Granted, I had maybe too many dishes in the oven.) Food needed to be served asap, so a couple minutes in the microwave took care of it. I also reduced the sauce on the stove and added some corn starch - IMO, a step absolutely necessary to the recipe's success.

God, it doesn't get much easier than this. I browned my chicken first with some onions (they carmelized)and then used a mixture of sour cream and heavy cream for the creme fraiche. It was great. Husband licked the plate clean...server over long grain rice with some nice broccoli or a salad.

Great easy meal! My mother came over and had a taste, she immediately wanted the recipe. We used to make something very similar with canned soup, but this is so much better. I added sliced almonds on the top, used fresh herbs and may add some cheese next time. Super fast easy weeknight meal!

I love this recipe. It is easy and delicious. I have children that are hard to please but they love this one. I serve it with short grain brown rice and brocolli. The sauce is a bit thin but tastes great. My friend suggested adding grapes to it--might be a good idea. I love any recipe that I can remember off the top of my head when shopping for the groceries. Tastes even better the next day.

My husband asked me to "lose the recipe". I thought it was impossible to make chicken taste bad, until I made this recipe. There are plenty of easy, tasty chicken recipes out there, therefore, I would not recommend making this one.

Extremely easy and really good. I will thicken the sauce a little next time because it does get a little runny -- I will definitely make it again.

I've made this dish several times. As the other reviewer noted, it is not a particularly special meal, but it is about as quick and easy as a recipe gets. The only recommendation I would make is to add a little corn starch to the mixture for thickening purposes. This is a good recipe for a novice cook.

I substituted orange juice for the sherry. It was a nice change from fried chicken but nothing extra special.
