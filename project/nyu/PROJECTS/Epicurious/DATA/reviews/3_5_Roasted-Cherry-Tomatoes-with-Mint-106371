Loose the mint. If you want to tart it up, add little chopped oregano or rosemary before cooking. Try cutting the tomatoes in half before cooking to release and cook off more water for greater concentration of flavor.

This is the easiest, best dish of this sort I ever tried. I've served it 15 to 20 times since 2002. Someone always asks for the recipe and is always stunned by the ease with which it is made. I just smile.

This was a loser the first time I tried it, but with a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes I first cut the cherry tomatoes in half, then sprinkled with grated parmesan as an experiment. Boy, were the guests impressed with the lovely color and great taste. I even sprinkled some chopped chives over before serving. Forget the mint!

This seemed pretty bland--a disappointing dish.

These little tomatoes make an easy and colorful addition to a dinner plate. And they taste good.

Yummy, had some leftover cherry tomatoes. They were put to good use.

Used some good sized grape tomatoes, roasted about ten minutes. They were tasty and held their shape.
