Makes way more than six servings! More like 10 -12!! A little bland. Also needs more stock added. Maybe some white wine for more flavor or more spinach?

As a Diabetic-conscious eater, I was happy to find this recipe. I love lentils: they are filling and treated as a protein food under my diet plan. My only complaint - and from those that I prepared this for - was that it was a little bland. However, upon reheating the lentils in a skillet the following night, I made the following modification that made the fish flavorful: pancetta. A little pancetta or even diced ham as a base gives this dish the finishing touch. I will make this again.

I made this with the Pollo Valdostana with very good results. I had Lentilles Vertes so used 1 cup of those to feed Two hungry men. I forgot to shred the spinach, which would have made a nicer texture, but it was still very edible. Quick and easy, this combination is a keeper, though I would add garlic to both recipes and perhaps some red chili pepper flakes to the sauce.

Oh yeah, and instead of bay leaves, I used Mexican oregeno and tarragon.

This is a great stand alone vegetarian dish! Make sure to rinse lentils before boiling them to combat grayness later on. I didn't change the recipe much, but I did throw in a few garlic cloves and a big sweet yellow onion in the beginning. If I had one, I would have thrown in a big chunk of parmesan cheese rind during the boiling and removed with the water. I used baby spinach instead of regular and veggie broth instead of chicken. Also, at the end I added about two tablespoons of Sherry vinegar and a healthy dose of white pepper. And grated parmesan, of course.

This came out bland and grey. I saved it by adding tons of pepper, the juice of 2 lemons, parsley and marjoram. If I made it again, I'd include garlic, either halve the amount of lentils or double the amount of spinach, then top with parmesean and serve it with crusty bread.

This was a solid good. I incorporated some of the recommendations offered by kccook. In addition I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar right before serving. It helped brighten the overall dish.

I liked both the lentils and the chicken seperatly, but both my boyfriend and I agreed as a combination it was a bit strange.

I pictured this dish turning out in perfectly shaped glossy brown lentils, but it turned out to be a bland, grey mess. That took away some of its appeal, but it was a bit more stock away from being really tasty. Not a bad dish, but it needs help.

After reading the reviews I was worried about this being bland, so I made a couple of adjustments. I sauteed the oninons in olive oil with some minced garlic until they were soft, added some white wine and cooked it down a little before adding the other ingredients. I replaced the water with broth, then saved the cooking liquid when I drained the lentils; I used it for the broth in this recipe and the remainder of it I added to the broth in the Chicken Breast Valdostana recipe. I also added just a little diced prosciutto with the spinach since it's also in the chicken. The results were fabulous and not at all bland. In fact, undrained this would be a great lentil soup.

I used green lentils. It was not bland at all. In fact it was delicious.

I agreed with other reviews that said the dish needed a kick. Trying adding a small can of diced tomatos and a tablespoon of tomato paste while the lentils are simmering. I also add a few cloves of garlic and serve each serving with a small slice of goat cheese that melts right in.

This dish is spectacular with grilled homemade italian sausage and sauteed broccoli de rape with garlic. Definitely a comfort food meal. Great italian bread and a glass of red wine complete the meal.

I used cooked lentils left from another dish and cooked spinach, to which I added more liquid and pepper along with the veggies and bay leaf. I cooked these down so little liquid remained, at least 30 minutes, and added a tablespoon or so of olive oil for one fourth the original recipe. I made the dish about three hours before serving it and let the flavors combine. I liked the dish, as did my spouse, and didn't find it bland.

After seeing Lidia cook this recipe on TV, I was excited to re-create the meal. All I can say is that it was disappointing after I followed the recpie exactly and it did not look close to what was prepared on TV. Perhaps it was the electric v. gas stove but the lentils were a little boring in taste and definitly not as brown in color. Double the olive oil and seasonings when preparing at home!

I rarely cook lentils, but I like using the peppery French green lentils in this recipe, and I find this dish is great with Lydia's accompanying chicken recipe. I'm not sure I'd be as enthused making these on their own, but I am a fan of her suggested combination here. Subtle, at least w/the richness of the cheese, tomato, and chicken, not bland.

I am a big fan of Lidia's but found the lentils to be far too bland.

This was okay but very bland. I might try it again but would need quite a big pick me up and its probably easier to find another lentil recipe. (lentil and brown rice soup on this site is WONDERFUL)

I loved this. It was a hit for sure. A tasty, healthy dish indeed. I made some extra "juice" for it and tried it with a linguini, added some fresh parmesan, and that went over well too. The mixture on its own is also great with some crusty bread for a light lunch or snack.

i sauted the onion for extra flavor. I used little brown lentils from Umbria. i served it with some Italian sausages. My family was enthusiastic.
