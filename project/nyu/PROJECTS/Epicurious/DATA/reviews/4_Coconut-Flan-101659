Easy. Delicious. Doesn't need a ton of special ingredients. Will put in the dinner party rotation.

Very good, very easy, very sweet! Used coconut milk and skipped the flaked coconut.

INSANELY delicious. Something so good shouldn't be so simple to make but yet it is! I followed a reviewer's suggestion and used 2/3c milk and 2/3c coconut milk instead of the 1 1/3 cup whole milk...made for an incredibly creamy, indulgent flan. Also toasted the coconut beforehand. Thanks for this recipe!

Very nice. Very easy. Would reduce sweetened condensed milk a little (use 5/8th of the 14oz can). As suggested by some I roasted the coconut flakes and it turned out amazing. Coconut flakes rose to the top and gave a nice bite to the softer below.

Lovely recipe. Use the same amount of coconut milk in exchange for the regular milk, toast the coconut and bake for at least 40 minutes to set. It's less like a flan, and more like a pudding, but this does not at all detract from it's amazingness. I would like to swim through a pool of this stuff! Mmmh! Making it a second time this week!

Wow, this is a great recipe - it tops a favorite coconut flan at a local gourmet restaurant. So creamy and rich. You must toast the coconut first! And use coconut milk, if you can.

My housemate said it was the best thing she's ever had that didn't include chocolate. I used another flan recipe and made its caramel topping for this, and baked it for 50 minutes. The only other thing I might have changed from the original recipe is to toast the coconut a bit.

Great recipe. Easy to prepare and its is possible to make it in advance or in the oven while cooking other things.

Do not add more milk than the recipe call for. If you want, substitute the whole milk by coconut milk (great idea). I believe the cooking time is too short, be careful, specially if you cook it in one larger pan. I would cook it at least for 50 min.

This was a fantastic and easy recipe. My dinner guests raved about this dessert. I read the reviews of other cooks and followed some suggestions. First instead of just milk, I used 2/3 cup milk and 2/3 cup coconut milk. I also subbed coconut extract for the vanilla. Lastly instead of individual dishes, I used a bundt pan. I baked this for a total of 50minutes. When I unmolded to the serving plate, I placed raspberries in the center and around the flan. Lastly, I dusted the top of the flan with flaked coconut. It was excellent and very yummy! This is a recipe I will make frequently.

I have made this several times over the last few months. It's an easy dessert that tastes wonderful. I especially like that it doesn't make too much for a family of 2.

For those who used coconut milk in this recipe -- how much did you use, and did you substitute it or put it in with the other milk? Thanks!

My Mexican wife and her Guatemalan friend (who's one of the best cooks I know) say this is one of the best flans they've ever had. I usually make it in a single dish, and add coconut milk for extra flavor.

I've made this with low-fat milk using 3 eggs to good results. Even better, though, was using low-fat condensed sweetened milk and 1% milk, unsweetened coconut and 1/4 tsp. of coconut extract and the correct eggs and yolks. My friends loved it. I also baked these in 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup custard cups. The size variations were popular. Could the star fruit fellow tell me how to tell when it's ripe. The one I used wasn't too good, but it had potential.

I made this recipe to a dinner with friends and was very disappointed! The flans were very liquid after several hours in the refrigerator. The flavor was not so bad but it was so sweet, some refused to eat. Disaster!

I made this for Xmas last year and it was a huge hit! It is SO easy to make. I am going to make it this summer for a tropical themed party.

This is absolutely the best dessert in the world. It is unbelievably easy to make. I never unmold it, just eat it with a spoon. Can't get enough!

A really simple but delicious dessert, made a couple of times, especially women seem to like it! I put in some lemonpeel grating to take of the sweetness a bit. It also gives it a 'fresher' taste. Try it, it's great!

Phenomenal Flan ever! My friends thought it was dreamy instead of creamy. I added sliced starfruits on top of it to give a tarty flavor. Excellent addition to Latino dishes.

I made this dessert because I love coconut and custard and it sounded so easy. It was a hit with my family. I've made it about 6 times for different sets of guests and they have all loved it. Will be one of my easiest and most delicious recipes in my favorites file. I don't refrigerate if serving within a couple of hours and unmold while still warm onto a pretty dessert plate. Running a thin knife around the edge of the flan will make unmolding easier. I then add a small bunch of green grapes next to it on the plate before serving. The combination is really wonderful. A few pieces of toasted coconut on top of the flan adds color & texture. If I have to refrigerate, I warm the custard cups in hot water for several seconds before unmolding. This works really well. Good going, Bon Appetit!

Very tasty, and it couldn't be easier. It didn't strike me as terribly flan-like (i.e., a wobbling custard that gets turned out of its baking dish, along with some sauce); more like a pudding.

I did not like the feeling of the coconut flakes. So, I changed the coconut flakes for coconut milk and it tasted great.

Easy to make and yummy. I cut the recipe in half and it made four generous servings. It is quite rich so a small serving is truly adequate... even for this dessert lover.

I thought this was a little too sweet, so I sliced some kiwi on top which gave it some tartness. It was very easy and fast, and was perfect for an outdoor summer dinner party!

Delicious and very simple to make. The proportions were perfect. Next time, I might garnish with raspberries and/or a light sprinkling of toasted coconut.
