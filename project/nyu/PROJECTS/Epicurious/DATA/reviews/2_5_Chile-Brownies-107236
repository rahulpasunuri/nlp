I had a chilie brownie that was awesome! They called it a rattlesnake bite, it was a recipie that called for less chili, 1/4th cup is really too much of most chili powders, I would try 2-3 T at the most. They topped theirs off with a simple glaze and a mix of sunflowerseeds, pistachio nuts and pine nuts... it was awesome! The brownie should be a moist chewy recipie and you can add 2-3 T chili powder to most recipies w/ no problem. YummmY!

9x13 turned out to be way too large for the amount of batter this makes. I would use a 8" square. As the baker, you can decide what chile powder to add. I would use predominantly ancho, mixed with some spicier chiles like Chipotle or cayenne or guajillo. DON'T OVERCOOK THEM

By following these directions to the letter, my brownies turned out very grainy and way too spicy! I like spicy, but these were ridiculous! I am going to try again, tweaking the directions a little, perhaps creaming the butter and sugar as opposed to melting the butter with the chocolate...

I loved this recipe. I used 1/4 cup of ancho chile powder and 1 tbsp of cayenne and it was perfect! I accidentally used 1 1/2 cups of butter instead of sticks of butter but they were still really good, I just had to serve them in a bowl with ice cream because they didn't stay together very well. I served them to guests who had never had chile and chocolate together before and they were very pleasantly surprised at the taste.

If you are looking for a "brownie" recipe, this is not it. While the flavor of these brownies is rich and smokey (providing you use the right chile) the ultimate taste of the brownie is aweful! They are way too dry to be called a brownie, but rather a spicy (dry) cake. The only way they can be served to company is in small doses with simple ice cream.

after reading the reviews and learning the difference between chile powder and chili powder I changed things up a bit. Instead of chile powder ,I used a tsp of cayenne pepper. Love at first bite! Thanks

These were delicous! However, I used about half the amount of chipotle powder and they nearly blew our heads off--and we love spicy food. The dulce de leche ice cream helped but next time I will use less chile powder. I think success depends largely on the type and source of the chile powder.

Interesting recipe, qwith a nice balance of flavors. I recommend using powdered chipotle for this recipe, it has a great smoky flavor that compliments any chocolate recipe. Works for Hot Cocoa too.

I have always loved the taste of chile and chocolate, and these brownies made that combination into an easy, classic dessert. Although I wonder at the intro where it said Yankees weren't familiar with these flavors -- I'm as Yankee as you can get, and I've always seen chocolate and chile together.

Thanks to the previous cook who clarified chile powder versus chili powder, I am sure this makes a huge difference! I will hunt down chile powder this time.

I think the problem with those of you who have found this recipe to be too hot is that you are using Chili Powder or Cayenne powder. This is not the same thing as Chile Powder which is not as hot as chili powder.

I agree with the others in saying that 1/4 cup plus 1 Tbsp is TOO MUCH chili pwdr for most everyone, although I know some do like ridiculously hot food (I do like hot curries!)I reduced down to 1 Tbsp of chili powder and added 1 Tbsp cinnamon, plus some dried tart cherries to play against the hot, the brownies turned out very good, although next time I would add even less chili powder.

I would truly not even give this recipe a one. I agree with the reviewer that said "YUK". These were awful -- not a good texture, tasted only of chilie powder, not even a sweet taste. I will never make these again.

INEDIBLE, YUCK

I love this recipe. I have varied the amount of spice, and it always turns out well. Serving it with cranberry sauce (made from frozen cranberries, not the sauce from a can) was a huge success.

I have made this recipe 3 times this week trying to perfect the dose of Chilli, being a home grown Texas I love hot foods. I used 1/4 cup of chilli powder 1 tbsp of cinnamon and used rye flour. Baked them in my Grandmother's cast iron skillet and after cooling cut into 16 equal slices. Everyone that I have given these brownies to have thoroughly enjoyed them.

I live in Houston, TX. I love chili in cookies and desserts, like Berryhill's Killer B's (featuring pequin in an excellent recipe) but this went way beyond heat. Overall the brownies were inedible - and an enormous waste of good ingredients and time. 1/4 cup + 1tbs of chili powder is too much for any recipe much less for brownies. Make an your own peril.
