To those who comment that there is no flour in this recipe; I was reading just recently that chestnuts used to be ground into flour and were used for the original polenta before corn from the New World was introduced to Europe! I had no problem with these falling apart; then again, I usually make my pancakes thicker and not as wide across. Delicious, nonetheless.

Great flavors, and a great use of some fresh chestnuts I bought, as well as a use for some leftover creme fraiche I had! I went for sweet, rather than savory, and used the maple syrup; the combination of the gentle sweetness of the chestnuts, the tang of the creme fraiche, the smoky goodness of the bacon, and that wonderful saltiness of the bacon drippings used in the batter all came together, and so easily, too! I freshly steamed my chestnuts, so most of my prep time was dealing with peeling them; other than that the recipe was a walk in the park!

I blended all of the chestnuts into the batter (instead of blending half and chopping half), used canola oil instead of bacon fat and added a tiny bit of vanilla--they were fantastic! I actually found their texture to be just like regular pancakes.

this recipe worked great, but I had to add a little bit of flour to bind it together. the texture was fantastic, as was the taste!

I sae this recipe and thought the same thing - there's no flour! So I came here and now see that it wasn't a typo. I'll give it a try - sounds great!

We made the recipe as stated (no flour) and thought it was great! You will be disappointed if you are expecting a breakfast pancake consistency. These are more like blinis or buckwheat pancakes. Definitely want to make them smaller rather than larger since the lack of flour means that they will break apart when you try to flip them (if they're too big). We didn't have creme fraiche, so sub'd some unsweetened whipped cream. We served them with wirsching from Saveur's website. Delicious dinner for Fat Tuesday!

I couldn't follow the recipe exactly- I didn't have jarred chestnuts, so substituted some fresher, roasted chestnuts and was lacking enough to make the base, so added whole-wheat flour until I got a consistency I was happy with. I also omitted the bacon just because. They were served both savoury (with sour cream and chives) and sweet (maple syrup and dark spiced rum) and everyone thought they were fantastic and a nice change.

Yuck. Both the texture and taste are awful. Though it doesn't require flour, it probably would benefit from it. But we won't be trying it again. My husband always cleans his plate - this time he left half of it.

I don't think it's missing the flour, since the chesnut paste is close to flour (you can make flour out of chesnut. I'll try it !

Did this recipe originally have chestnut flour instead of whole chestnuts? Can you substitute chestnut flour in this recipe?

where's the flour?

There's no flour because the chestnuts are enough to bind the rest of the ingredients. I won't make this because I don't cook with bacon, but I'll try using chestnuts as a base sometime, perhaps using mushrooms and some other source of fat...

The flour´s role is done by the chestnut. No missing ingredients.
