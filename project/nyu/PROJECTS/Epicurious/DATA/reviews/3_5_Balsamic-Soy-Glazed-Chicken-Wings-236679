Very delicious! My wings stuck to the foil though, so next time I will put the wings skin side up so that it doesn't tare off when removing the from the pan. I also used brown sugar and added garlic. Also would be good with thighs and legs.

Very good and very easy. I used wings and drumsticks in the BBQ grill in aluminium pans so I avoided the smoke other reviews mentioned. This also free'd up the oven for other food. I flipped the chicken once which made them amazingly crispy on all sides. The sauce was easy, just had to appoint someone to stir constantly. I also added garlic to the sauce and hot sauce, but not enough hot sauce - I'll try to add something for kick next time. I forgot the butter at the end of the sauce but it was still amazing. There wasn't a lot of it and I was worried it wouldn't coat everything, but it did and was great. Overall, easy and delicious. They were all gone.

I've been making this recipe for years, and it's a hit every time. Simple, easy, and delicious. Bear in mind that the sauce takes about 20 minutes to reduce. If you have them on hand, scallions are a wonderful garnish, but they definitely aren't necessary - it's great as written.

This roasting technique has upped my "Wing repertoire" big time! No doubt I will still make the recipes which call for marinating wings, as I have many tasty renditions. But we absolutely raved over this recipe....I used the entire wing, and the tips were like shatteringly crisp potato chips. The crispiness of the skin was such a pleasant surprise, and it reminded me of what I enjoy most when it comes to crispy duck....the quick toss in the reduction glaze did not hamper any of the crispness while eating...in case I haven't been clear....I LOVE crispy :)

I did as others suggested and added the 3 TBSP of brown sugar and let me tell you, these are absolutely amazing! So crisp and with the glaze, no additional dipping sauce is needed! I will never use another recipe for wings again. This one is it!

Very good. Over cooked the wings and forgot the butter, but good nonetheless. Would try to add a bit of brown (rather than white) sugar. Tossed with cayenne instead of black pepper. Next time: would try with larger pieces of chicken (e.g., thighs, drumsticks).

Made the wings by the book, but added a few drops of hot tobasco sauce to the glaze. Mmm--mm-mmm! This is going to be the second time making them in a week. Once for the fam, and my 4 and 5 year old inhaled these, one for my brothers housewarming party, and can anyone say Super Bowl?

Truly excellent wing recipe. I cooked mine on a wire rack with foil underneath, and used regular bone-in wings (what is a wingette?) and they came out beautifully. Crisp and golden brown. I added fresh ginger to the sauce and then tossed in red pepper flake and minced garlic after it finished cooking, then tossed with fresh cilantro for color and flavor at the end. Highly recommend this recipe--the sauce offers up infinite variations and unlike another wing recipe I've used on the site the wings will not come out slimy or rubbery thanks to the high heat treatment.

excellent. used 3T Brown sugar instead of white sugar added 1 large minced garlic and 3 pinches ground red pepper. I served the wings in the same bowl i used to toss them in the glaze. this was a mistake. toss them well once and plate them seperately, otherwise as the sauce cools, it thinkens. This caused them to be completely caked in sauce which was just too much.

This so simple to make and delicious. I made it for my Super Bowl party and they were a total success! I personally think it's missing a little something. Next time I will take the suggestion and add garlic to the sauce, and perhaps some crushed red pepper for heat.

Very tasty, just a bit different from BBQ wings. I read all the reviews, omitted salt, used brown sugar instead. This sauce reduces so nicely, would be good on so many things, maybe even over strawberries! One thing I did differently, I was also making baked buffalo wings and they called for baking them for an hour at 425, so I did that instead (especially since so many reviewers complained of a smoky oven). I patted the wings dry and brushed with regular vegetable oil. Nice and crispy, and fall off the bone tender. Kind of an odd combo of ingredients but very good!

Excellent recipe. I also made a few changes; used 3 TBSP brown sugar, 4 cloves garlic, omitted the salt and used salted butter. Worked perfectly. Will make again as my family loved it.

so good! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of wings but the sauce was so good...when reducing I used a med-low heat and stirred almost constantly. It took almost 20 min but did not burn. I also added some minced garlic to the sauce. Delish.

I did this with legs as an appetizer for an outdoor party. Very good and easy. Kind of messy to eat but very popular...perhaps a little low class, but serve with citrus handy wipes. Everyone was happy. One consideration - they do smoke up the house! I will make these again but I think I will try grilling the legs outside.

This was pretty good as is, but even better with modifications. My first batch tasted distinctly vinegar-y, so the 2nd time around I subbed 4 TBSP brown sugar for the 2 TSP of white the recipe called for. Much better! Love the technique though -- wings were nice and crunchy.

This recipe gets 2-1/2 stars for taste plus another half-star for ease of preparation. It's a good weeknight meal. To address the reviewers who are concerned about the amount of time it takes to reduce the sauce: use a bigger saucepan. The bigger heated surface area will make the sauce reduce more quickly and turn into a glaze.

Both my husband and I loved these, exactly as given. Simple, relatively quick, and adaptable. Used wingettes. Nothing could be easier. edit this note

I have made this many times and prefer to cook the wings on the grill while the sauce reduces. The wings are nice and crispy and there's none of the mess.

The sauce was OK, but need more "something", garlic, ginger, heat are all good ideas. The preparation method was HORRIBLE. My house reeked of smoke, and I had to clean my oven twice to get rid of all of the grease. I can't believe more people haven't mentioned the mess. The wings were crispy and I liked the way they turned out, but hated the clean up.

Rating: 4
This is excellent...it's one of those dishes where you have one and say "it's good" and then all of the sudden everyone's fighting over the last one! I get asked all the time to make it when I'm attending a party. Cooking times do vary and you have to get the wings crispy so you might need to increase the cooking time.

Rating: 3
Everyone loved them! Thought my oven was clean but found out otherwise. It did take longer than 15 minutes to reduce the balsamic mixture. Perhaps because I was cautious given others experience with it burning. I added garlic powder to the oil and pepper and a little ginger to the balsamic mix. No problem with sticking to the pan and no need to turn. At such a high temp. for 40 min. both sides were quite crisp.

Rating: 1
simply awful. the wings do not get crispy and one could pass out simmering the sauce. HATED IT.

I marinated chicken pieces with soy sauce, garlic, ginger, whiskey, Splenda and freshly ground black pepper. Used Convection oven at 375 degrees for 35 minutes. Added marinate to balsalmic vinegar and reduced. Delicious!

This was my first attempt at making chicken wings, and these were delicious. Easy to make and crispy. Two caveats: my oven got very smoky from the balsamic burning on the pan. Also, turn the wings. The recipe did not say to. My aunt said I should. She was right - these would have been four forks if they had been crispy all around and not just on one side.

Rating: 4
This one is amazing!!! So simple and flavor isn't sacrificed due to the lack of heat. The sauce may need a drop or two of water, extra vinegar or soy sauce whisked in if it siezes up before the wings are done.

I made this for a Super Bowl party. They were very appreciated and disappeared quickly. The recipe is straightforward. I did lightly grease the cookie sheet and think that was helpful. Even so, some of the wings stuck a bit and had to be pryed off. I didn't completely reduce the sauce for lack of time. Just until it was nicely thickened. I was surprised how well the glaze coated the wings when the glaze was just added at the end as the recipe called for. Because I did have extra sauce, I drained off the excess so the wings were not soaking in it, and that worked fine.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fantastic. I've made it at least 5 times, using the glaze on broiled salmon, pork chops, shrimps, and other chicken parts. The only thing I would change is to watch the wings; they burn at the required cooking time.

These are easy and my guests could not get enough of them. I cooked them on the grill in a foil pan since they generate a lot of smoke when cooking.

Here is an inexpensive, versatile family entree/appetizer that my somewhat fussy kids ate and enjoyed. I used drumsticks and cooked them slightly longer. Also a great dish to bring to potlucks; the chicken is fine at room temp and this is always a plus when the oven is not available.

Mmm these are delicious! They where a TAD too salty, too much soy I think, but they where wonderful I will deffinitally make them again, for sure :)

While this was good - it lacked zing. If I made it again I'd add a teaspoon or more of hot sauce to the sauce while cooking.

Wonderful! My suggestion: spray the aluminum foil with non-stick spray before roasting the chicken. Mine stayed glued to to untreated foil, even after standing. Otherwise, this is a simple and fabulous recipe!

I didn't heed the warning about starting out with a clean oven, and something on the bottom caught fire during the preheating phase. So I switched to Plan B and cooked the wings on the grill, since it was a balmy day. The wings were absolutely delicious! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Finger-Scrumptious good! Easy to make. As recommended in other reviews, thoroughly drying the wings before baking makes for a nice crispy skin. We used 1/2 sweet balsamic and 1/2 sour balsamic to create a perfect marriage of flavors. We served with rice and a side of steamed veggies.

These were delicious! As another reviewer mentioned, it is easy to burn the glaze - I did the first time, but was very careful the 2nd time around & it was perfect - I did not reduce as much as the recipe states.

Super easy and yummy too. Make sure to dry off the wings before you start so they get crispy. I skipped the drying and mine came out very good, but would have been even better if I had dried.

Im a fairly competent cook and mangaged to ruin this. It tasted slightly burnt. I think becuase I actually attempted to reduce it to 1/3 cup. Maybe should have reduced it only to half cup. I was even using my small burner and was stirring it constantly. It began to take the constistency of boiling sugar well before 1/3 cup. Probably wont make again. But then again I'll probably have to try again.

Very delicious and addictive. My husband raved and savoured over them all throughout dinner. I had only 1/2 cup balsamic, but made up the difference with cider vinegar. I used 1-1/2 tsp sugar and still feel less can be used. I forgot to add the butter to the sauce at the end, but all was still very good. I, too, had left the sauce off the heat too long, leaving it a little goopy - but I just simply heated it up again so that it was liquified enough to pour. I'm definitely making this again and again.

This was a nice dish, just not spectacular. Nice to try something different but, maybe due to personal taste, we prefer teriyaki versus the balsamic-soy. Probably won't bother making it again.

I used chicken thighs. Very good, a nice variance from the usual. Baking first gives the skin a nice crispness that holds up with the sauce.

As I am watching calories, I made this today using chicken breasts, which I baked and then removed the skin. I used low salt soy sauce and added a 1/4 cup of fresh orange juice and reduced sauce to a syrupy consistency. It was delicious. I will try it over pork chops next,as I think it will be equally successful.

I wanted something easy to throw together while I was decorating for Christmas, and voila... this recipe was in a magazine I had on my coffee table. I made it exactly as directed, but used only one package of chicken wingettes which was about 1.5 pounds, and therefore reduced the roasting time. The sauce was so good, and I was able to use up a fairly inexpensive balsamic vinegar and still had high quality taste. I suggest salting the wings VERY lightly since you will be bombarded with salt with the soy sauce (I used low sodium sauce). Hint: Dress the wings as soon as possible when the sauce is ready... I let it sit for just a bit too long off the flame and the sauce got a bit goopy, but that was totally my fault. I'll make these again and again.

My family of five (three children under the age of 10) loved this recipe! We used all drumettes. They were perfectly done following the recipe, but the next time I make these I will cook them a little longer for extra crunch. I passed some of the sauce around and served with traditional celery and blue cheese dressing. They don't have a lot of spice to them which makes them very child-friendly. I also love the fact they are not fried. I will have to double this recipe the next time we make it.
