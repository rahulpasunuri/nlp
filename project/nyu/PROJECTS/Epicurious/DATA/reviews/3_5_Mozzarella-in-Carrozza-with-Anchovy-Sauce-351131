This is definitely comfort food. We loved it and will be making it again. Next time, we will try mixing the anchovy sauce ingredients in a blender, but that's more just to experiment with texture. Tastes divine!

I've been making this for years -- the sauce really makes this special. I use anchovy paste to save time. Also, it's not necessary to dip these in milk first. Dip in egg mixture and bread crumbs twice if you want a really crunchy crust.
