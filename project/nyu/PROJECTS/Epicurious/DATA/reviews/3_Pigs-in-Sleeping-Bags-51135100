I might try again but would spice it up. A little dry.

A little on the bland side. Might be a good idea to double up on the spices or add an extra kick somewhere- horseradish maybe?

I made these for Christmas appetizers last night and they were very easy and tasty. I did use darfour pastry and as it is kind of a pain to work with and comes folded into fours, it just cut the pasty into four slices and then made four rolls instead of three. Way easy and not as fussy. For the sausage, I used 12 oz of pork and added some extra spices. I did test the sausage mixture by cooking a bit and added a bit more salt, but the final rolls still needed more. And I used guldens spicy mustard instead of Dijon. My only problem was that I had to use my lower over drawer as the main over was being used for the main course. The heat isn't as god so I had to cook them a lot longer and the grease/butte r from the sausage and pastry made e bottoms a bit to crusty. But they were very yummy!

These are good, not fantastic. Just kick em up a notch with some more spice inside, perhaps some red chili flake or? Better with the fresh, barely sweetened cranberry sauce. I followed the directions to a tee, next time I won't make so much but I doubled it. Froze half for when unexpected company comes.

Awful name for a recipe, but a good appetizer recipe nonetheless. I made mine a little too skinny and will make fatter rolls next time to get enough sausage in each slice. Call them sausage en croute or something more palatable and serve them!

I can tell these are going to be dangerous... once you have one, you want to go back for another! I made them as instructed, doubled the recipe and had to use Pepperidge Farm pastry sheets as my grocery store doesn't carry Dufour. I only baked one roll as a test and have frozen the other five for an upcoming party - wonderful make-ahead-and-freeze recipe. Very tasty with the dijon for dipping, and I may serve them with a couple of flavored mustards, maybe a cranberry one for the season.
