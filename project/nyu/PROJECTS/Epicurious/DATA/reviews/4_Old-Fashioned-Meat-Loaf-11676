I changed the meat mixture so that it is a third each of beef, pork and veal and have made it several times for the family. They love it.

This was a good and interesting take on meatloaf, but time consuming for not an exceptional flavor in the finished product. It was better cold the next day (plated or sandwich) and I did have to make a few changes since my husband was in charge of the grocery list and misconstrued some items, so I had these changes: Panko crumbs instead of bread ccrumbs, italian flat leaf parsley instead of regular curly parsley and ground sirloin instead of chuck. I did keep in the scallions (green onions) as the recipe asked. That said, I don't think the items that were changed significantly impacted the flavor. My husband liked the flavor (it was a little earthy and I chalked that up to the carrots), but it was light enough texture which was a nice improvement over my current, family meatloaf recipe.

We really enjoyed this - very moist and flavorful. I left out the scallions and used a bit of mild sausage with bacon in place of the pork.

I was looking for a recipe for a simple, old-fashioned meatloaf to make for my six grandchildren. This definitely fit the bill. The kids polished 1 1/2 loaves off in a single sitting. I added two strips of bacon, sliced to go across diagonally, and emptied liquid from the pans after baking.

I adapted this recipe for mini meatloaves in a 12-muffin tin, similiar to the Deen Bros recipe here. It was amazing! The only change I made was to use 1 large onion instead of 2 cups, and drop the scallions, and since the portions are smaller, to cook for 30 mins. And to use a mix of ketchup, Dijon mustard and worcestershire sauce for the topping, added when the timer reads 20 minutes.

This is a great meat loaf recipe. Everyone I make it for raves about it. I make on 2 changes, I use 1 lb ground sirloin, and 1 lb ground pork sausage, such as country sausage or breakfast sausage. I also make a sauce of 1 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2-1/2 TBS cider vinegar. Fantastic. Freezes great too, uncooked. Linda

I found an identical recipe to this in Saveur who attributed it to Gourmet. Only difference is addition of bacon strips crisscrossed on top. I do this and eliminate the additional 1/3 cup ketchup on top and it is spectacular.

Well I guess I'm finished looking for a meatloaf recipe I love. The sauteed vegetables really keep the meatloaf moist and if chopped small enough hold it together. It's worth the extra work for the finished result. I used the pan juices to make a delicious gravy to go with my mashed potatoes. I've made this several times and even though I'm a single dude I eat all of it before the meatloaf goes bad.

Very easy and tastier than most recipes. I recommend the combo of pork/beef and don't skimp on the veggies - cut them small and they add a lot of flavor/texture. I've also cut the recipe down to 1 lb meat (with proportionate adjustments to vegetables) because the recipe makes a lot for our family of 3 and it turned out the same.

Rating: 0
Easy recipe that had the family asking for seconds (always a good sign). This is an above average old-fashioned meatloaf recipe, though the black pepper and ketchup flavors are rather prominent so I'd recommend reducing the black pepper to 1 tsp and ketchup to 1/2 cup divided. If you're new to cooking, grocery stores don't always have the ground meat in the exact measurements listed so any combo of pork and beef totaling 2-2.25 lbs would work for this (preferably more beef than pork). Came out perfect after 1 hour @ 350.

Made this dish for my husband. No celery or ground pork so used celery salt and just used ground chuck. Also mixed 1/3 cup spicy bbq sauce with ketchep as sauce topping. His response was "the best meatloaf I have ever eaten."

Just finished this wonderful meal!! I did not have celery on hand and I substituted shallot for scallion, but that's the beauty of this recipe in that it lends itself to using what you have in your pantry. I also combined barbecue sauce and ketchup to make the 2/3 cup needed. Used 2 lbs of lean ground beef..my beloved can't wait to make sandwiches with the leftovers. Served with mashed potatoes, corn and a great Cabernet...wonderful comfort food!

Rating: 4
Exceptional every time. A little prep work but it is well worth it.This is is by far the best from an old, comfort food. I topped the loaf with a mixture of ketchup, A-1 sauce and a little brown mustard then with a layer of maple bacon strips. Bake for 50 minutes; turn up to 400 then bake an additional 15 minute to get the bacon more crispy. YUM!! While it rested; I roasted cut- up potatoes and string beans mixed with olive oil, garlic, s/p and chopped parsley (dried ok) - bake 20 minutes covered in same oven temp; uncover for another 10 minutes stirring once. Now that's a meal.

This recipe is the best I have ever made for meatloaf. Don't let the veges fool you. I doctored the ketchup topping with just A-1 sauce/ketchup and strips of bacon.

My butcher in Wilmette, IL made a wonderful meatloaf every Tuesday and ever since we moved my son has been pining for this old fashioned favorite. I have tried many other recipes and this will be our new keeper. It is excellent. I chopped the veggies in the food processor so they were very fine. Additionally, rather than ketchup alone I mix 1/2 cup of it, along with 1.5T cider vinegar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and top with that for a tangy taste.

I thought this came out great for a fall dinner. There was a bit of a kick to it, I assume from the fresh ground pepper. Everyone asked for seconds.

We made this to have some easy healthy food for my one year old who has a milk allergy. We made it exactly to the recipe but with chopped up wheat bread instead of bread crumbs to avoid dairy and add some whole grain. It was very tasty and he LOVED it. We have made it a couple of times already. We even freeze some of the leftovers for an easy meal for him when we are pressed for time. My husband loved it too.

Rating: 3
I think I may have chopped the veggies too much, since I did them in food processor. Besides that, everything was good. My fiancee bought dried parsley instead of fresh, which probably negatively effected it as well. I also topped with bacon, because I've never had meatloaf without that. I added some chili powder too, from a earlier review. I'd make again, but make some changes.

Rating: 4
Outstanding. I made this on Sunday afternoon knowing it would be easy to re-heat during the week after work. I tasted a small bite when it came out of oven and was not impressed. It was good but nothign special. That was then. Sitting in the fridge a few days did something to make this an incredible meatloaf. The kids ate it, enough said. I used a pecan bbq sause instead of ketchup.

Rating: 3
My kids (5 & 3) asked for 2nds - then 3rds - of this recipe, as did my husband. So that must say something! I didn't have any scallions, so omitted those. I put the carrots, celery and onions through the food processor so that they were just to the point before a puree. I think it really helped with the moistness of the meat. If the carrots/celery had been just chopped, I'm not sure I would've liked it at much. I substituted crackers for the breadcrumbs and used dried parsley for fresh. I didn't get a good crust on the meat, but I would rather have a meatloaf done to the right temp, instead of overdone. I'm not sure if the extra ketchup on top as per the recipe had anything to do with that. Honestly, I think I could've skipped it and the meatloaf would've still been great. I'll definitely add it to my repertoire.

My husband made this meatloaf recipe and it was amazing. He is not the best cook, but he can follow a recipe and this meatloaf recipe has replaced my current recipe. It was moist, using 80/20 beef and the seasoning was perfect. The only change was a topping. I grew up putting a mixture of brown sugar and ketchup on the surface for the last 15-20 min of baking. Mmmmm!!!!

Rating: 3
This was a very good traditional meat loaf. It did, however, need an additional 10-15 minutes in the oven, and then should be allowed to rest another 10-15 minutes before slicing. Newxt time, I would shred or omit the carrots which didn't add much and made it more difficult to slice. I didn't use the scallions. Will definitely make again.

One word for this recipe - YUMMY! Even my pickiest eater liked it, and he hates everything. I did not add celery or scallion, and used ground beef for the whole thing. For the ketchup that is brushed on top of the meatloaf, I added a little chili powder just to spice it up and added it half-way through the cooking. By far the best meatloaf I've ever made.

I didn't have scallions and didn't use quite as much onion but everyone loved it, even two kids aged 6 and 8. I diced the carrot and onion finely and browned them (adding water occasionally to prevent burning). The next time the 8 year old visited she asked if I would make the meatloaf again. That confirms it for me.

This compares to the meatloaf my mother used to make. For a healthy alternative, use oatmeal instead of bread crumbs to bind the meatloaf.

I made a few adjustments and it came out perfectly! I used cilantro intead of the parsley and added a few pinches each of cumin, turmeric and curry powders. I only had ground turkey on hand. I omitted the ketchup at the end of the recipe and let it cook just over an hour. I also used 1-2 tbsp. milk and some whole wheat bread that I had crumbled. The result was a wonderful, moist, and very flavorful meatloaf. Be prepared for it to go quickly!!

Rating: 1
Mine came out damp and rather bland. I didn't have scallions but I really don't think they would have made that much of a difference. I've popped it right back in the oven in the hopes that a few more minutes will help it reduce moisture and caramelize more in the surface and around the edges. Overall, this meatloaf is a little too sweet for my palate. And the veggies, especially the carrots, only seemed to sweeten it more. Really disappointing.

Rating: 3
Sort of damp but all my meatloaves seem to be. I used pork, chicken and beef, mushrooms, carrots, celery onion and garlic. I think the key was the ketchup and worstechure (sp?) It was a hit

When fall comes around I crave comfort food, and this fit the bill. Wonderful and tasty. I didn't have everything on hand: no carrots or scallions so I just omitted them, and since my bottle of ketchup was almost empty, I used half ketchup, half canned tomato sauce. Instead of ground pork, I used 4 Toulouse sausages (casings removed). Really great taste and it sliced perfectly. I think one of the keys for that is to make sure you dice your veggies small enough.

Rating: 3
I didn't have any scallions so made it without and it was still delicious. My very picky 5 yr old said "I like this kind of meat" and my husband (who is not a fan of meatloaf) said "that was the best meatloaf you've ever made". I'll definately make this again.

I've made this meat loaf again and again. The only modification--I dice a 10-oz package of button mushrooms and add them to the sauteed vegetables. I've never gotten anything but raves for this, and it really tastes like one's fantasy of what meat loaf should be. Delicious.

This is a terrific meatloaf. Lots of raves about the wonderful flavor. From the base recipe I made a few changes. * Cut the onions to 1 1/4 cups * Dropped the carrots * Added 1/4 lb beef chorizo for flavor * Added 1 cup of diced mushrooms * Cooked in a clay pot (Romertopf) * Lined the clay pot with thick sliced red potatoes - They soaked up the wonderful juices * Started with a cold oven, set to 450 and cooked for 75 minutes. It turned into the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.

OMG - this is fantastic. I'm tossing my other meatloaf recipes out and keeping this one. And it's just as good the next day reheated for lunch. (the yummy aroma caused several members of my office ask about the recipe) It's a winner! Yum!

Rating: 4
As someone who enjoys a good meatloaf, this is one of the best I have ever made or tasted. But as a meat loaf "purist", I omitted the diced carrots and bell peppers. In my opinion, they don't improve the flavor - they just increase the work. Some of the reviewers of this recipe stated their meatloaf did not hold together when it was sliced. I had no problem at all - I was able to provide firm yet juicy slices. Perhaps this was because I allowed the meatloaf to cool a bit before slicing. And also because I did not include the carrots - which would tend to make the meat less firm.

Rating: 3
I've made this about half a dozen times, always to rave reviews and requests for the recipe. The only change I make is that I dice a 10-oz package of mushrooms and add that to the vegetable saute. Then I up the bread crumbs slightly to compensate. Scrumptious!

I tried this out on my friend who loves meatloaf. She proclaimed it very good. I didn't have enough onion, and used only 1 cup. I think it would have been too onion-y with 2 cups. My kids loved it without all the onion too. I'll make this again very soon. Great comfort food.

This was a pretty good meatloaf. I used ground turkey in place of the pork (which makes it leaner and sweeter), added some smashed potato chips, shredded the carrot instead of chopping it, and mixed some spicy oriental hot sauce in with the top ketchup layer (which gave it a nice little kick). The loaf did take about an hour to cook, however I had the heat cranked up to 450 and just kept an eye on the meat's temperature. The husband loved it! Good stuff!

Rating: 4
This is a great meat loaf. I made mine with one and a half pounds of ground beef and one pound of ground pork. I followed the rest of the recipe and then brushed the meat loaf with a mixture of ketchup and barbeque sauce. I had no problem slicing it, it held together very well. It was so delicious. I'm making it again today for our Saturday outing on our boat.

Whenever I make meatloaf, this is the only recipe I'll use. Everybody has their own criteria for "perfect" meatloaf, but this one is really, really good. Not too dry and very flavorful. It always takes me a little longer to put it together than I think it will, but it's by no means an all day proposition. It makes a tremendous amount, but it makes such good sandwiches that getting rid of the leftovers probably won't be a problem.

The best meatloaf I have ever tasted! I used a mix of veal, pork and beef, and omitted the celery and the scallion. I don't like the flavor of cooked celery, and two cups of onions are plenty. I let it sit for 15 minutes and had no trouble slicing it. I highly recommend this recipe!

I was looking for a dish to make with some ground beef I had in my refrigerator, and I came across this recipe. I do not like meat loaf, but I must admit this is a very good recipe, moist as can be, and also tasty. I left out the carrot and the celery, and I added some ground cloves and some cayenne pepper. I probably will make it again, but I'll use a lean ground beef instead. I baked it in a 9 x 4-inches loaf pan, and I used the meat juice to make the sauce.

Being a child of immigrants, I never had meat loaf when I was growing up. My husband, on the other hand, is from the Midwest, and had his own ideas about what meat loaf should be. When he saw me putting it in the oven, he was profoundly skeptical; when he tasted it at the table, he apologized for doubting me. :) I also drained the fat from the pan, and let the loaf sit for ten minutes, and I had no problems with the slices falling apart.

My family loved this recipe. I didn't have the problem of the slices falling apart. I prepared the meat loaf in the morning and refrigerated it all day. Then I cooked the meat loaf at 350 using the convection option and I added about 7 minutes to the cooking time. Maybe that made the difference? I also added about 1/8 cup of wheat germ to the breadcrumbs for a small kick up on the nutrition.

This recipe is really wonderful - it had all the ingredients I was looking for in a meat loaf recipe. Only thing I changed: I added 1/2 of the amount of ketchup with A1 Steak Sauce. Turned out great! One thing this recipe doesn't tell you to do at the end is to drain out the fat before serving. You'll be suprised how much fat is at the bottom of the pan - fat that you don't need to eat! And for those of you who have complained that the meat loaf falls apart easily, all you have to do is let it cool a bit before serving (say about 15 min). The loaf won't be piping hot, but it will still be warm and tasty. It's that easy!

I loved this meatloaf as a base, I borrowed an element from another meat loaf recipe which made mine fabulous, I simply added a dozen oysters to the onion, celery, etc mixture......JUST KIDDING! But, I did put 1/4 - 1/2 inch layer of brown sugar in a 5X10 loaf pan and poured a layer ketchup on top of that, I then carefully put the meatloaf on top of this and baked per directions, paying more attention to the internal temperature than to the baking time. The brown sugar and ketchup form a terrific juicy sweet sauce that everyone loves. The loaf does fall apart easily, but I don't care, it tastes fabulous.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. Since I don't care for celery that much I substituted 1 cup diced red bell pepper and added 2 tsp ground cumin for an exotic flare. I also added 1/2 cup oats for texture. The end product held together great with only a little fat from the bacon I layered on top which I drained. The look of the red pepper and carrots added to the presentation. This recipe will become a staple in my house!

The real deal. Used one of my Mom's old tricks and substituted oatmeal for the bread crumbs. Nutritious and gives a great texture. Served it to some visitors from Paris with sour cream mashed potatoes and carrots with parsley to "show off" some traditional American fare - a big hit.

The best meatloaf I've ever tasted. I threw away my other meatloaf recipes, this one is so good. My only complaint is it falls apart very easily. It's impossible to slice. That's why I didn't give it four forks. Any hints on what to do so it doesn't fall apart?? I'm following the recipe exactly. Wonderful flavour though. I've made it twice in the past three weeks and it tastes great the next day in sandwiches, if there is any left over.

I gave it two stars because it was better than Lish Nielson's Meatloaf, but that is not saying much. I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I put one! drop of Vicious Viper hot sauce in with the cooled ketchup and veggie mixture before mixing it with the meat (Vicious Viper packs a punch - two drops to a whole recipe of soup can turn it into fire). Anyway, when we ate it we needed to add salt, and I found it lacking much flavor at all. My main complaint is that it kept falling apart and off my fork, and by the end of the meal I had a pile of little meatloaf crumbs. I just gave up trying. Does anyone know of a recipe for a great, meaty, flavorful meatloaf that holds together when sliced? Any hints would be appreciated. Thanks.

We had this last night for dinner and I eagerly await lunchtime for a sandwich out of the leftovers. Moist, flavorful, and easy comfort food with a mound of garlic mashed red-skin potatoes. My personal adaptation was to use only 2 lbs of very lean ground beef, omitting the pork, and Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs. Also decorated the top with four criss-crossed bacon strips before baking per the usual request from my teenage son. I used the sauce from Lish Nelson's meatloaf, at this website, based on its good reviews, pouring some over during the last half hour, and serving the rest at table.

I was expecting something extraordinary, but I thought it just tasted like meatloaf. Don't get me wrong - it was really good (I love meatloaf), but it's not any better than the standard version that you probably make already. Tip: it feeds more than 4-6 people. This meatloaf mixture overflowed in my loaf pan, and even my 8x8-inch square pan. I had to use one larger.

I can't believe the best meat loaf I ever had was made by me! Clearly a superior recipe, and I see no reason to use any other for classic meatloaf, since this one is so flavorful, moist, and tender! I went so far as to mince the vegetables to make them less evident to my meat-purist husband, but he absolutely loved it. The only thing I did differently was jack up the garlic a bit... With mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy, and fresh summer peas, this was a meal like my mom would have made if she hadn't been a vegetarian.

This was AWESOME...& easy to make. I've made it with the beef & pork as well as used ground turkey and ground chicken. Both versions were delicious. I also added some Frank's Red Hot to the sauce on top as well as a couple strips of bacon. I made it for my coworkers and it was devoured in about an hour!!!

I thought the ground pork added a wonderful flavor to the mix; however, I omitted some of the veggies, as it often makes the loaf a bit too juicy. A bit of ground sausage in the mix makes a more flavorful loaf, too.

This is a wonderful recipe but extremely labor intensive. I do not like celery so I omitted it and opted for more carrots which tasted great. I estimate the prep and cooking time to be a little over two hours if you cut all the vegatables by hand. Well worth it.

Very tasty and moist. I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. Using the food processor for chopping makes this easy and quick to prepare.

This is the best meat loaf my boyfriend has ever tasted! Just use the cuisnart to make the chopping go faster.

Our favorite meatloaf recipe. I've kept the magazine all these years just for this recipe. A "real keeper".

Like this so much I made it again the next day and froze it. Substituted the beef and pork for lean ground venison (sitka black tail), and added dash of cayenne pepper. Great flavor, and simple to make!

I have a lot of friends who are food snobs. When I get positive reviews from this bunch on a meatloaf, you gotta believe this is excellent. Somewhat labor intensive due to chopping required but well worth it.

Attack of the killer meatloaf!!!!! Made with the following modifications: - bread crumbs - 1 1/2 c. hand-plucked french roll or loaf - garlic - 2 tblsp.; - salt - 1 tsp. + 2 shakes of Morton's Natural Seasoning Salt; - Worchesterchire - 2 tblsp.; - added 1/2 cup finely chopped red bell pepper. Liberally slather much more ketchup all over the top and heels with a spatula and you're in serious business. But don't forget the most important ingredients: patience and love.

well, it is hard for meatloaf to be spectacular because it is after all -- meatloaf, but this is a great old-fashioned recipe and i will definitely keep it as "mine". i cooked in a loaf as well.

Great "every-day" recipe. I prefer to bake it in a loaf pan, but the result is the same. Delicious as a ledtover, too.

I can't believe how terrific this meat loaf was! I have always loved meat loaf, but all the recipes I've used in the past have had something missing. I followed this recipe exactly, and it was great. It was moist, tasty and not too heavy. Yummy! My boyfriend has even told me to throw away his mother's recipe for meat loaf because he wants this one from now on!

This meat loaf is easy to make and tastes delicious. I substituted beef with turkey to make the dish a little healthier and it works fine with the recipe.

Nothing out of the ordinary however it was very good.

I substituted ground turkey for the beef and pork, and it came out wonderfully. Ground turkey is blander than beef, so the vegetables and spices really gave it a nice flavor. However, it did take a lot longer than the recommended cooking time for the meat thermometer to reach 155 F. I eventually raised the oven temp to 400 to speed things up, and it worked fine.

The great thing about a great meat loaf recipe is it lends itself to modification with delicious results. As long as you keep the basic formula, you can use ingredients that you like. When I made this I used spicy BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. If you have a stovetop smoker (Cameron's makes an inexpensive, sturdy one available from www.chefscatalog.com), separate the mixture into two loaves and smoke each one for about 50 minutes. This adds such a nice flavor and the smokehouse odor that fills your house will keep 'em all waiting with baited breath.

This was one of the better meatloaf recipe's I've cooked. It was light and moist, which is a treat with all that beef and pork.

If you like meat loaf, you'll love this. I substituted oatmeal for the bread crumbs (enough to bind, about 3/4 to 1 c).

This is the best meatloaf recipe any of my family has ever tasted. They like it so much, I now have to double the recipe any time I make it so I can share with my mother, grandparents, everyone! It is a lot of work, but very tasty, well worth the effort.

A very fine meatloaf. A little more work than my usual recipe (all those vegetables to chop - but, hey, that's what food processors are for) but well worth it. I added some hot sauce (Franks!) to the veggies with the ketchup and worcestershire sauce for a little zip. Also, you may want to let the veggies cool off some before mixing them with the meat and other ingredients -- you don't want to burn your hands or cook the beaten eggs.

Scrumptious meat loaf. I added another half-cup of bread crumbs to my mixture and formed two flat loaves (1.5 inches high) instead of a single tall one. The baking time remained 1 hour for both loaves, in separate baking dishes. Great for sandwiches!

This is a delicious dish, and I look forward to making it again. This meatloaf was very moist and tasty. It was the best meatloaf I've ever had. Easy to make and my family enjoyed it.

This is the BEST meat loaf recipe I've ever made. I subtituted one big yellow squash for the celery, and used 3/4 lb low fat ground beef & 1 1/4 lb low fat ground turkey. This is a real winner! I'll be making this again and again!

A delicious, savory and satisfying meat loaf. When accompanied with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans w/ onions and a mushroom gravy it is a wonderful and quick winter meal. End it with a graham cracker cheese cake, and don't tell a soul!

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared in April of 1994. It makes a dense aromatic meat loaf. The blend of seasonings is a perfect foil for the heaviness of the meat. It is a family favorite and even has the neighbors knocking on the door for a taste.
