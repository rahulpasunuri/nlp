Delicious! I took the reviewers' advice and used fish sauce and no brown sugar in the dressing. I also added cilantro and green onion to the cabbage. It was very clean and flavorful - great!

I marinated the grilled steak in some of the salad dressing until we were ready to eat. Used fish sauce in the dressing, thai basil in the salad and chopped peanuts as a garnish. Used NO brown sugar-- the teriyaki sauce is sweet enough.

We loved this! Great mid-week meal and a great way to lighten up on the meat consumption, but still trick your husband into thinking he's getting his meat :) Served with a side of Pad Thai -- it was perfect!

This was delicious, and so easy. I had leftover flank steak, which I tossed with the teriyaki sauce an hour before re-warming it. My corner market didn't have Napa cabbage, but regular green cabbage worked fine, although I would agree with a previous reviewer that slicing it very thinly is important. (A bag of coleslaw mix would make it even easier.) The next day, I tossed up the leftovers with a few great Thai-inspired additions: fish sauce in the dressing, and some chopped basil and peanuts. Even better!

I assembled the salad ingredients and the dressing separately, and then combined them later in the day. I used leftover grilled steak from the day before and just warmed it up with a coating of teriaki sauce. I also added a big handful of chopped cilantro, since my garden was out of mint. It was easy and delicious - loved by all. This will definately be a repeat for me!

Easy, light, and good. I make it all the time for a quick lunch or dinner. Carrots are a good addition.

I have to say, I was not crazy about this dish. The steak was delicious, but I must just not be that big on sweet dressings. I loved the cabbage/mint/onion combination though. I'll use these basic salad ingredients again, but maybe try to find a different "Asian"-type dressing.

Dy-no-mite. This was so simple and delicious. Just be sure to use quality steak and fresh lime. I didn't have mint--but no matter. The cabbage portion is so good, I would triple the quantity of napa cabbage. Dressing quantity works fine.

This was so good that next time I am going to make it with filet mignon. Will also add thinly sliced carrots (curly strips made with my vegetable peeler) for added texture and color. I used Kikoman Lite Sodium Teryaki sauce. Didn't add the mint and didn't miss it.

Awesome recipe. Its so fast and so good. I used Kikoman Teryaki sauce and I added in baby mixed greens with the cabbage. Keep this one

Absolutely fantastic. Even the most unadventurous eater loved it.

Yum! We couldn't get fresh mint, so we substituted fresh basil, but it was still great. The crunchy Napa cabbage with the onions & beef were terrific.

Great, easy meal. Excellent flavors, though I thought it might be bland. I didn't use a food processor for the cabbage and it turned out fine - quite nice. I did make the mistake of adding the dressing to the greens about an hour ahead of time which wilted the greens - next time I will toss the salad immediately before serving. Served with peanut noodles and champagne! YUM!

Good and easy. We doubled the Napa cabbage and rolled it up in warm tortillas.

Having a food processor to shred the cabbage is a must, so that you get an even textured result. Definitely do not overcook the steak - medium rare is the perfect 'doneness'. I just realized I forgot to add the red onion, but it was still very good. Served with Sesame Noodles - yummy.

This is a perfect summer lunch. The warm grilled steak mixed with the cool crisp cabbage creates great texture with a wonderful blend of flavors!
