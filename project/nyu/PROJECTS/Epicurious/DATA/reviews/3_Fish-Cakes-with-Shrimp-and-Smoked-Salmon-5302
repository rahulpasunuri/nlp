The brilliance of this recipe lies in the trio of fish: smoked salmon, shrimp, and whitefish (whether you use orange roughy or a plebian rockfish) that combine for a subtle yet complex flavor beyond your basic fish cake or crab cake recipe. The finished product is far from bland, but it IS very subtle. Your guests should appreciate the blending of fresh dill, lemon and the essence of the three fish. If you prefer a stronger flavor, add a few cloves of garlic and some italian parsley. Serve with a spicy aoli made with smoked chipotle pepper, garlic, and lime and you'll never again cry 'bland!' **for the white fish, I used instead a ling cod I had caught off the coast of santa barbara and smoked very lightly over wood chips made from an oak wine casket for a very subtle smokey flavor

Aggree that recipe was bland as is, but I added fresh garlic to the fish mix and and assorted flavors (basil, thyme, lemon pepper and parmesean cheese) to the bread crumbs and my diners could not stop raving about it. After heating up leftovers at work, I had to give out the recipe it smelled so good.

The result is bland. I wouldn't make this again as is, but would be open to suggestions that enhance the flavor.
