outstanding. Fast, easy, flavourful. Really nice marinade and the roasted tomatoes and barley add a surprising touch. Thought I would hate the barley but it was great!

I didn't have rosemary and this still turned out fantastic. Used wine instead of balsamic vinegar...whatever we have left over in the fridge. Sometimes merlot, recently it was cabernet. Some have said it doesn't always have enough flavor...extra garlic cloves and some onion in the marinade help with that. We've also added extra brown sugar to help with the sweet flavor that compliments the lab so well...my favorite chops are the frenched lamb we get at Sam's Club.

Love this. My family won't order lamb out any longer, because it's never as good as this recipe. I also use this marinade for steak. I've started adding 2-4 tbsp of brown sugar as well to this. Plus garlic and 1/4 an onion. We reduce the marinade on the stove instead of on the grill when we don't have tomatoes to go with this.

3 forks for taste, but deserves4 forks for ease of preparation. Used lamb loin chops because that's what the market had. Used the rosemary-- excellent flavor, complemented the lamb beautifully. The cherry tomatoes were wonderful--I think the quality of the basalmic is what made them. Served with minted couscous with peas. Really great, and really easy.

Loved it. Might double the marinade next time, could have been a bit stronger - but the flavour was great. Will roast the tomatoes in the oven next time.

Rating: 4
Very good. I used a stove-top grill pan. In spite of minimal marinating, it was very tasty and liked by all. The cooked reserved marinade, though, was not much sauce. Another time I would double the marinade to have a bit more sauce.

Rating: 4
Not only did I actually HAVE all the (non-meat) ingredients required by this recipe (How great is that? No searching for weird stuff), it was also easy, fast, and delicious! I also made some extra marinade (twice as much is fine). I love tips when people make it differently from the recipe, but this time I just did the recipe as is (almost - just realized I used red wine vinegar on the tomatoes) and it was excellent. In fact, red wine vinegar is milder and I would probably prefer it to balsamic.

We love this recipe for lamb. The first time we made it was Easter Eve and the market was sold out of lamb chops so my husband bought racks of lamb. Now that's all we buy! We marinate and grill them whole-cover the long bones with a strip of foil so they don't char to oblivion. Rosemary is a nice addition to the marinade. The lamb is so juicy and flavorful a sauce is not necessary so we have stopped doing that step. We were not terribly crazy about the tomatoes-there are better sides that incorporate tomatoes. Instead grill some eggplant, peppers and zucchini and roast some baby potatoes with garlic and sprinkle with mint.

Okay, Miami and Colorado here's my take on that issue. I agree with both of you. Colorado.....Miami was not against you for adding your own twists, she was just pointing out trying the recipe as is first so you can accurately rate and review the recipe as it is written. I too tweak my recipes as I feel fit. Miami.......it annoys me as well when people COMPLETELY change the recipe and then rate it poorly. Of course, this is not very accurate and they shouldn't bother to review it at all. Adding rosemary to a lamb recipe is not a big deal. So you are both correct. Cook's, please keep in mind that when you are posting a review, try to stay somewhat within the basic fundamentals of the recipe. Don't make it let's say, a tomato base when there are no tomatoes in the recipe. I will be making this recipe tonight as it is and judging by the ingredients I know it will be a 4 star. Not a huge fan of rosemary and I will not bother with the cherry tomatoes. Minted couscous and a leafy green with added white beans sauteed in garlic and olive oil sound perfect for me.

Really simple, delicious recipe. Added some chopped rosemary as others recommended, and it helped boost the flavor. It was maybe a tad sweet (I doubled the recipe for the marinade), so I might reduce the honey next time. Also cooked the lamb for 5 minutes instead of 4 and it was perfect (used both rib and loin chops and both were delicious). We didn't really need the reduced marinade as a sauce b/c the chops were so flavorful. Definitely do not skip the tomatoes. I skewered them and cooked on indirect heat on second level of grill until they split and then blasted them on hot part (about a minute) until they were slightly blackened. I brushed them with balsamic vinegar before grilling and then finished with some smoked salt and balsamic cream (don't ask where I got that!) - awesome! Also made the barley, but it was unremarkable. Toasted the cumin seeds and then ground in a spice grinder, since others complained about the seeds. Also watch the lemon juice - mine was too tart. Good if you're someone who needs a starch but not indispensable.

Wow, what a great meal! I used my mini-prep food processor to blend the ingredients which probably wasn't necessary. I also wanted to make sure that I had enough marinade so I tripled the recipe (double would have been fine). After that, I followed the instructions and everything came out fine. My guests were blown away by the meal, especially how the flavor of the tomatoes (balsamic) complemented the marinated chops. Want to impress someone? Make this meal!

I have been making these since the recipe first came out, but haven't made it in a while. I rated them 4 stars because the flavor was GREAT, ease of recipe, and minimal ingredients. I made this for Easter and two non lamb eaters who have requested the recipe!!!

This is easy and flavorful. Wasn't sure about the amount of marinade as it seemed very little, but it turned out to be fine. I didn't even bother heating marinade.

Trying this recipe got me hooked on sauteed cherry tomatoes with beef or lamb. I've made it over and over and it's a winner every single time!

Rating: 4
Delicious! The lamb needed longer than 4 min to cook to med rare though. Used thick slices of heirloom tom instead of cherry.

Rating: 4
My review & rating is for the lamb alone as I did not make the cherry toms. The lamb was fantastic!!! Made as part of a Greek-themed BBQ. Follwed the recipe exactly and everyone raved. The lamb was tender and falvourful. Marinated for approx 3 hours. Will be making again.

Okay, Miami and others: My interpretation is that morality does not belong in the kitchen. I enjoy reading how others modify recipes and rarely follow them precisely. That's why I love the user reviews! We just had this dish, with balsamic vinegar in the marinade and grilled yellow tomatoes instead of the cherries. The marinade--the way we made it with balsamic and a touch of rosemary--was delicious. The yellow tomaotes...needed work. The pistachio-mint couscous we served this with was a great match, as was the delicious Rose, which we drank on the deck whilst cooking. I will make this again and again with whatever modifications suit me in the moment...and certainly no regrets or guilt! Get over yourself, Miami!

I altered this recipe slightly and it came out great. I used about 1 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1/2 a cup of redwine vinegar and the perscribed amount of honey, salt and pepper. I reccomend fully reducing the marinade before cooking the chops. I served this with a standard risotto (with saffaron), spinach sauted in garlic oil with pine nuts and some green olives. All items complimented the chops very well! Oh one more thing... the cherry tomatoes are NOT worth the trouble. But the taste of the lamb was exceptional.

Rating: 4
Easy and excellent. Added some fresh rosemary because, well because it's lamb. We did not have cherry tomatoes but grilled a large tomato cut in half. Yum!

This was great. Chops turned out really tender and juicy, needed a little longer on the grill than in the recipe, but not much. Give it a try...

So simple but very delicious. I've made this dish several times. The last time, instead of tomatoes, I served it with carrots with ginger and snap peas with an asian dressing. It was a wonderful summer meal.

Rating: 3
Be sure the tomatoes are sweet, to balance the tangy balsamic vinegar. I made it with out-of-season tomatoes. Imagine slightly acidic tomatoes with vinegar, and you have it. It missed the mark. Thankfully, the lamb and marinade were excellent.

Rating: 3
This is very good as written - make the cherries!

Rating: 3
Not crazy anout honey in anything but it balanced the marinade nicely. I have to agree with the cook from Miami; if you've changed the recipe before ever even trying it and then rate it, what's the point? You aren't really rating the recipe. Very annoying to read a review that doesn't exactly match the recipe. :)

Rating: 4
This dish is excellent!! I've made it twice for two separate groups of people. I got rave reviews both times. The marinade was a perfect compliment to the lamb. I used Rice Pilaf instead of the Barley. Other than that, I did everything else as specified. I also served a greek salad with it. I will definitely make this time and time again.

This was excellent! I added rosemary to the marinade and used it on a butterflied leg of lamb. My family loved it.

This is delicious and so easy to make. And I made the recipe EXACTLY as printed (Miami). Great way to cook tomatoes - awesome dish!

This was a great recipe! The marinade was fabulous. As it cooked in the pan and the juices reduced, it carmalized the marinade and had a wonderfully sweet flavor that complimented the flavor of the chops, which I used instead of the rack. Definately will make again!

Rating: 4
Wow- was this good! I had never cook lamb before but thought I would give it a try. Made chops on the charcol grill. Did not make the tomatoes.They were fantastic. The chops were very moist and the flavor was outstanding. I let them marinate for about 36 hours. The marinade did not over power the flavor of the lamb. I did add a little fresh rosemary to the marinade.I did have a little problem with flare-ups on the grill. I beleive this was due to the honey, but with careful attention no harm was done.I am planning on making these again soon.

I will make this dish often...absolutley marvelous...marvelous. My girlfriend loved it. I love lamb and this beats Davios'(of Philadelphia)Rack of Lamb.

Rating: 4
KICK ASS! This recipe was AWESOME! We just made the chops and tomatoes (in -16C weather) - tomatoes were ok, but the chops were fabulous. Used balsamic rather than red wine, and marinated for 4 days (got busy and took a while to get around to BBQing). My wife thought it was a little sweet, but I loved it! And you don't have to use Costco chops - we used our nieces 4-H prohect, Bubbles. I'd give the chops 5 forks if I could!

I only rate this a 3 because of the tomatoes. Didn't care for that. The lamb was a 4 or more. I served it with the Epicurious Roasted Brussel sprouts with garlic and pancetta and wild rice. It was a very nice combination. People.......if your going to rate a recipe, please make it first the way the recipe calls for it and then comment on the changes you made to enhance it. "I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used cider vinegar".....or......."didn't have honey so I used sugar. Duh! Some of the comments like they threw in a few sprigs of rosemary is okay but still.........that should be after you tasted the actual recipe. I must say this is the thing that aggravates me the most on this site.

This was an incredibly easy and tasty recipe. I frequenly have large dinner parties and usually get rave reviews, but this recipe was awsome and easy. I substituted lamb loin chops for the rib chops and marinated them for 8 hours. The loin chops required more time on the grill. Other than that I followed the recipe. This will definitely become a frequently served dish at our house.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely outstanding. Usually I do not gravitate to grilled lamb, as it tends to hide the lamb flavor, but these are sublime. The subtly of the honey in the marinade was wonderful. This will become part of the standard rotation. Excellent.

Rating: 4
Excellent and very easy to prepare. I also added about 1 tsp of fresh rosmary, chopped, as others suggested and thought the flavor was wonderful. Made it for Father's day and pleased three generations - including my 11 year old. The tomatoes were a great addition and so simple. I also grilled zuchinni and red peppers and with some good bread it was a perfect, light meal.

This recipe (for lamb) was great. I did add fresh rosemary to the marinade and on another occasion a few chopped mint leaves as well since I had it on hand. Plan on using again and again...

this was good. we used loin chops, marinated overnight, then grilled to medium rare. honey gave a pleasant smokey taste, but overall flavor seemed to need something. would give this another shot with the rosemary recommendation from other reviewers.

This was very good - like many reviewers I used the lamb chops from costco - very good by the way. I added a sprig of rosemary to the marinade, and in hindsight would have added more, or chopped some up to go in. The tomatoes were simple and a perfect accompaniment - as was the barley dish. All in all a great meal.

A delicious marinade for lamb chops. Grilled Costco's chops on the Weber. We loved it and will definitely make it again. Didn't do the tomatoes, but will try those too next time.

Low fat and so easy. I couldn't find cherry tomatoes on the vine, so I used the loose type instead. My husband loved it. Even the barley mint side dish was excellent. Have included it in my favorite recipe file.

Great recipe. The lamb really takes on flavor from the marinade. I used the full recipe of marinade for 4 lamb chops and used Costco (thick!) lamb chops. I grilled them a total of 5 minutes-we have a commercial type grill which gets VERY hot!! They were seared, so moist, and very flavorful. I made the Balamic Cherry Tomatoes which were okay but not worth a repeat. I served this with a brown and wild rice mixture and all in all was a nice menu.

Rating: 3
Excellent change for marinated lamb chops. I will do this again for guests.

Rating: 0
To "The Cook From Hong Kong" : The reason for heating the marinade is primarily to kill any bacteria that might have remained IN the marinade when the meat was removed. This is a health issue. Essentially, you are cooking the marinade to kill the buggies.

The lamb was delicious, a nice change. I was disappointed with the grilled balsamic tomatoes.

Definitely a keeper! We love lamb and this is a nice change from my usual lemon and rosemary marinade. We loved the barley recipe that accompanied it as well.

This was incredible. The barley recipe recommended made a particularly enjoyable meal. Very easy clean-up since you grill and throw away one of the two pans you need.

I used thick chops from Costco so they took longer to cook. I added some balsamic to the marinade as well. The tomatoes I put on skewers. I was afraid cooking lamb but now feel like a pro and am anxious to grill some other lamb recipes. The comments on this site really help me decide on trying a recipe.

I made this sans tomatoes. I was all out of red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic instead. Turned out delish!!! Added some pine nut couscous and a light salad, and my husband was congratulating me for a "good dinner!"

i really loved the marinade for the lamb chops - i used regular lamb chops (not frenched) cause i like 'em better - but boy did it rock - i served this with couscous, butter beans and fresh tomatoes - not the balsamic done just freshly sliced cause i am having a bumper crop this year - when grilling, 4 minutes makes for rare (which i like) and 6 minutes for medium (for my husband) - just a yummy marinade!

The chops were delicious. I was hesitant to use the honey, but the marinade was excellent and the chops turned out moist and flavorful. We did not make the cherry tomato recipe.

A very yummy and different marinade. I used very thick rib chops (2 inches) and did not french them or trim them. Not necessary.

The lamb was perfect and the tomatoes were yummy. I had to put the tomatoes on scewers because they were all rolling free even though it said "on the vine" on the label and the vine was in there with them in the little mesh bag. Yeah right. Scewers worked well, but I added red peppers and onions on the scewers too and they didn't cook as well. I served it all on a bed of baby spinach leaves with corn on the cob. YUM.

Excellent. Very simple recipe. I served baby salad greens with this - no dressing as the marinade and balsamic were enough. Beautiful presentation!

Made this tonight. It was awesome. I usually season my lamb chops with rosemary and lemon juice so this was a big change. Only additions I made was a bit of salt added to the chops after cooking. I had a couple of fresh figs that I grilled and seasoned with the cherry tomatoes and they were a wonderful addition. I will definately do this one again. Loved it.

I made the lamb chops in a grill pan and they were absolutely delicious; on a charcoal or gas grill, I'm sure that they would be out of this world.
