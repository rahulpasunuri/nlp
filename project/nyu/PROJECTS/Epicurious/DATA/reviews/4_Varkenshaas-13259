Our favorite pork tenderloin recipe - have been making it for almost 10 years, and our guests almost always ask for the recipe. We serve it with red cabbage and a mashed potato casserole, both of which we make in advance!

Rating: 3
This was very, very good, mostly due to the sauce. I didn't feel like marinating, and this seemed appropriate for a cold, wintry day. Easy and tasty even with dried herbs. Whole family enjoyed the sauce. I do not give out 4 forks lightly, but this was really close.

I liked this, but wasn't blown away by it. I think, maybe, the sauce might have been a bit rich for me - which is a surprise, as I like rich food!

This was DELICIOUS! Easy to prepare. An instant read thermometer really helped to get the pork to that perfect stage of doneness - mine took a bit longer than the 15 minutes suggested. We enjoyed it with the spaetzel w brown butter recipe, also from this site.

This is practically a weeknight staple for us. Really easy once you've done it a time or two. I usually serve with egg noodles for the sauce and a quick sauteed spinach. Makes great leftovers, too! A great classic recipe from this site!

This is simply amazing. Very reminiscent of James Beard's phenomenal mustard chicken. I usually serve it with rice to absorb the great sauce. The very last time I made it, I doubled the sauce and decided the recipe really is pretty much perfect as is.

I can't believe I've never reviewed this recipe! I cook this all the time. It even makes a great dish for guests. I've cooked it for several special occasions over the last few years, sometimes with mashed potatoes with carrots and leeks from this site. From all the recipes I've tried in four years from this site, this is truly a dish beyond compare.

Not fancy?? We have a lot of gourmet dinner parties, and this dish is by far the favorite of most of our friends. Make sure you sprinkle the chopped chives over the top, and try serving on a plate with some homemade spaetzle. A dry Riesling pairs great with this dish, by the way.

Does it look fancy?

Rating: 3
There were a few comments that this is not a fancy dish. I made this with Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Chives from this site and steamed green beans, and thought it made a lovely weeknight dinner. I only used one tenderloin, but kept the same amounts for the sauce but that was unnecessary. There is a lot of sauce here! While it was not my favorite pork tenderloin recipe, my husband could not stop eating it.

Rating: 3
Dish was rather ordinary - good flavor but not terribly fancy. Pork took longer than 10-15 minutes to cook.

Rating: 4
The only reason I hestitated to give this 4 forks was because it isn't a terribly fancy dish, but the flavor was so good I couldn't give it a 3. The tenderloins were done before my husband arrived home so I brushed them with the sauce which seemed to seal the moisture into the meat until he arrived. Great hot or cold.

I have to say, this dish was absolutely delish and SO easy to make! Not only I liked it, my boyfiend gobbled up the entire dish... definitely a do again :) I also used non-fat half and half instead of the heavy cream, and used only 1 tbs. of butter and no olive oil and it was still wonderful.

I've been making this recipe for years. The restaurant that submitted it is no longer in business so at least I can still enjoy at home. I agree double the sauce. Bad manners, but if no one's around my husband and I lick our plate, it's that great!

This recipe is so easy & well worth the little time it takes to prepare. I used a heavy skillet for 2 large tenderloins instead of the kettle. I substituted onion & garlic, since I had used up my shallots. I subbed evoo for the butter. Still superb. I served it with potato latkes. Yummy.

Rating: 3
My mom handed down a recipe to me that is almost the same as this one except with the addition of rubbed sage to the meat and top broiled at the last after having split the tenderloins and topping with gruyer. Yum. How I love gilding the pig lilly! I have done it without the cheese and it was quite good (a three forker porker), but with sage and cheese it rises to a dish beyond compare! Thanks mom - if you are reading this!

This wonderful dish has it all: quick to prepare and cook with delicious results. It is elegant enough for guests but easy enough for a weeknight meal. I didn't change the recipe one bit. I served this with fingerling potatoes that I cut in half and put in the 400 degree oven to roast at the same time that the tenderloin went into the pan. Everything was done cooking at exactly the same time. I sesrved with greens sauteed in olive oil, garlic and shallots. My boyfriend couldn't get enough! I saved the extra sauce to serve with chicken the next night. This recipe is a winner! I will make it every time pork tenderloin goes on sale at my market. Yum!

This was just fantastic. Restaurant quality, yet very easy and relatively quick. Made it with sauteed spicy dandelion greens and mashed parsnip potatoes. A great meal -- and on a weekday night!

This was surprisingly very good and easy to make. I cut the butter down to reduce the fat and also used fat free half and half--even doing that it had a great flavor! My husband scarfed this one.

Rating: 4
Easy recipe and very, very good. I made with fat free half and half instead of cream to lighten the fat content. I simmered for longer to thicken the sauce and used about twice as much half and half (which I gradually added over time as sauce reduced due to long simmer time). It was wonderful! We saved extra sauce and used on chicken breasts the following night.

I only made one change--since my husband isn't fond of mustard, I cut the mustard in half. It was incredibly delicious and super easy! Everyone loved it including my finicky kids.

This dish was so easy to make, and very easy clean-up. I used a 4lb pork loin, cut it in half, and froze the other half for future Varkenshaas! I added baby bellas to the sauce - yummy!! I omitted the parsley, and used dry basil only. Beringer Founder's Estate Chardonnay tasted wonderful with the dish. I also added some flour to thicken the sauce, and added a bit more dijon than the recipe called for. Horseradish mashed potatoes were a wonderful compliment, and the sauce pulled double duty as a gravy. I recommend sauteed, fresh spinach with shallots as your vegetable dish. The meat is incredibly tender and juicy. The dish does not take long at all, and ingredients will not break the budget. As mentioned by earlier reviewers, the dish is a great weeknight dinner, or an excellent dinner party dish. My husband leaned over, and gave me a hug, and kiss after his first bite. It's a keeper!!

This is the best! I like to serve it with horseradish mashed potatoes. YUMMY!

Easy and delicious! Made substitutions depending on what I had on hand. Used 2% milk instead of cream and 1 T flour to thicken the sauce. Used 1/2 t dried parsley. Used deep skillet with lid instead of large kettle, and nonstick 9x13 cake pan as the baking dish. Cooked a few extra minutes, and took out the tenderloin when the thermometer read precisely 155 degrees. Tented with foil for 5 minutes. It was moist and tender.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times and it is always fabulous. It's quick and easy and works with pork loin as well as tenderloin (you have to cook it a bit longer is all). I've used milk, cream and fat-free half and half for the sauce and they all work. I'm thinking of adding some mushrooms, onions and black beans to the leftover sauce and pork (cutting the pork up like for stir fry) and serving it again over wild rice for dinner tonight!

Rating: 4
This was great. I used the full sauce recipe for 1 tenderloin for the two of us. Mmm Mmm good!

Rating: 3
I thought the sauce was fantastic! It would go great with a steak as well. I halved it, since there is just 2 of us, and used 2% milk instead of cream, with fine results. Only had to roast the tenderloin 10 minutes, which was plenty of time to prepare the pan sauce. However, my fiance didnt like it. His opinion should be ignored though, since he never likes sauce on top of anything.

My five-year-old had "thirds;" my two-year old had seconds. I loved it. Very easy. Will serve to company this weekend.

Super pork tenderloin recipe. This was a quick and delicious weeknight meal and fancy enough for company. I used 2 Tablespoons of Dijon instead of the recommended 3 T and thought it was just enough. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
Here's one way to mix it up a little: forget the mustard until after you've put in the cream. After stabbing hectically with an ice pick, settle on using a chunk of frozen chicken stock that looks like roughly 2/3 cup. Underboil this mixture because pork is done. Serve, watch sauce separate. Still fantastic.

The pork came out incredibly tender - I will always brown tenderloins before roasting/baking them. And the mustard sauce was fantastic (what do you expect with so much butter?). Husband said it was one of the best dishes I'd ever made...

SOOOOO GOOOOOD!!!! I wanted to serve this for six people, so I just increased the amount of pork tenderloin to two pounds -- didn't change the amount of sauce. With salad and sides, it was plenty. I'm making it for the next two dinner parties! Will try browning the meat and making the sauce ahead (kept in a thermos) as suggested by another cook. GOOD, GOOD GOOD!!

Great low-carb recipe! A few slivers of garlic inserted into the tenderloin flavors the meat very well.

The meat came out perfectly, juicy and tender. The mustard sauce was absolutely delicious, complimented the pork perfectly, and was super easy to make. I served it with french fries and gai lan sauteed with ginger and garlic: a deeply satisfying meal. I will absolutely make this dish again.

I made this dish last night and it was a huge success. My daughter doesn't like mustard and she even loved the sauce. I must not have seared the tenderloin long enough, because it took about 20 minutes to get it to at least 140 F degrees, which meant it was still slightly pink, but we like it that way. I sliced it into 1/2 medallions and spooneded some of the sauce over it and put the rest in a gravy boat. Delicious!

This is a special occasion recipe that got raves when I made it. The sauce is definitely last minute but I had everything pre-measured so it was easy to do while the pork cooked. The cooking technique for the pork created such a juicy tender taste that I will use that technique even when not doing the sauce. The recommended timing in the oven was perfect.

Rating: 4
This continues to be my favorite pork tenderloin recipe! I serve it with red cabbage which I make ahead, and have discovered another dish that I make ahead as well - Horseradish Mashed Potatoes with Caramelized Onions - which is a great accompaniment to this main dish. The last time I made this pork tenderloin recipe I served it with Mashed Potatoes with Prosciutto and Parmesan Cheese - very good. You can find both recipes on Epicurious! Another pork tenderloin recipe you might want to try is Pork Medallions with Lemon and Capers - I cook the whole tenderloin, but have used this sauce - don't want to serve Varkenshaas every night!

Wow! This was terrific.

I loved the sauce...it totally makes the recipe. I did double to recipe for the sauce, because from what I read, we wouldn't have enough of it, but I had way too much leftover (it was just two adults and one child). Also, it took a long time for my sauce to reduce... I don't know why, but it was worth the wait! I would make this again.

I am of German descent, and my mother always made a pork, sauerkraut and potato German boiled-dinner on New Year's Day. This recipe brought me back, and because I haven't thought much about pork, sauerkraut and potatoes in so many years, it pretty much rocked my world. I brined the tenderloin for eight hours first, and slicing into it was like slicing into butter. The sauce: excellent, but not nearly enough of it. I am making this again tonite for the second time (in one week) and plan on doubling the sauce. Last week I acompanied it with sauerkraut and the horseradish mashed potatoes as another reviewer suggested. Tonite it will again be with sauerkraut, but twice-baked potatoes (I gotta throw a curve into culinary authenticity). I can't wait. Again, I am brining the tenderloin, and I am a big proponent of that with pork and poultry. If you have the time, do it! It makes a big difference, especially with Thanksgiving birds. Enjoy! This is a really easy and delicious recipe!

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe many times since I found it here. It is the best pork recipe I have every found. Sometimes I just fry pork chops and make the sauce from those. Don't worry if you don't have basil and parsley. You won't know the difference. Cooking down the sauce is the secret.

this is the 2nd time i've made this recipe, because it sounds really right for our tastes. but it's also the 2nd time there has been an "off taste" in the gravy--maybe sort of bitter. i was extra careful to make sure i didn't brown the shallots as i know they can produce an off flavor. could the mustard have produced a bitter flavor or do you have any other ideas?

I've made this twice and everyone loved it. I recommend doubling the sauce, even if you aren't doubling the amount of meat. This is excellent dinner party fare. I browned the meat and made the sauce a little early. After putting the meat in the oven, I was off to appetizers and wine with my guests.

This is AMAZING and exceptionally simple to make. I can't imagine anyone messing up this recipe (unless of course they add some poorly chosen personal touches, or use poor quality ingredients). To the lady in Knoxville who is having trouble: PLEASE try making this dish again! Use less fat if it troubles you--since there is no roux being made or any emusifying going on, consider the oil and butter amounts to be "suggestions" (I used two tablespoons less butter than called for). And anytime a recipie says to "scrape browned bits off bottom of pan", that usually indicates that you will be using the fat remaining in the pan plus whatever else the recipe calls for. I hope you have better luck next time, cheers! --Oh yes, the MAN gave this six forks! -t

Rating: 2
I'm having the worst luck with epicurious recipes lately! I have one big question mark about this recipe: it doesn't specify what to do with the original 6+ Tablespoons of fat that the meat browned in. Obviously, there are 3 choices--leave in pan to combine with sauce, discard or keep with pork as it roasts in oven. Since it didn't specify, I guessed it was to be incorporated into the sauce but it seemed pretty oily to me. Also, salt pork sparingly because of the dijon sauce.

When I make it for a dinner party at thom, my husband loves the sauce so much I find him in the kitchen trying to scrape out whatever bits may be left in the pan.

I usually don't like comments where the recipe has been significanly changed, but I thought this might be of interest. To avoid the fat police, I used chicken breasts. I browned the chicken and added it back to simmer at the point of adding the wine, broth & mustard. I also used a butter substitute(Smart Balance) and fat free half & half. To my supprise it was excellent(3 1/2 forks). My wife has requested it again.

I increased the shallots and mustard in the sauce and was very pleased with the results. The pork, which so often turns out dry, pork was incredibly moist and succulent. I used the leftover sauce a few days later with turkey meatballs, jazzing both the sauce and the meatballs up with a little tarragon. I will make this again, and I suspect that the sauce will be making appearances with other dishes -- with a tiny fiddling, it is wonderful!

As a personal chef by trade I was excited to try this recipe after all the rave reviews. I'm always looking to expand my menu choices to my clients. I choose to prepare it for a small gathering of friends before the holidays. Although it was easy to prepare I was disappointed with the results. The sauce was bland and tasteless. I was able to "rescue" the recipe with additional mustard and basil but still wasn't "WILD" about it. I would highly recommend saving your tenderloin for the Chipotle Honey Tenderloin recipe instead.
