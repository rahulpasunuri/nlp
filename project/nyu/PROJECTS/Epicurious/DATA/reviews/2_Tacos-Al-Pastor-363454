Something is wrong here. This recipe made about a gallon of marinade--way too much for only 4 lbs of pork, and it was pasty, so it could not be drained off as instructed. It was actually more like a rub than a marinade. Even after I doubled the liquid, it was still much too spicy and thick. I can't think of anything that would salvage this.
