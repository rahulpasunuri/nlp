This was just OK. I had to add a ton of Romano to give it some flavor, and I will eat almost any pasta. I'll stick to the stuffed and fried squash blossoms.

I followed this recipe very closely. I had company for dinner and all agree it was not one of my best. It had an odd tast, I threw the leftovers in the garbage.(there were a lot) I have used recipes from Epicurious for years and this is my first failure.

I agree with the previous review. This was a surprisingly good blend of flavors. I believe the fennel and the vinegar reduction were the secrets. It's definitely a winner.

I have to admit, from reading the recipe I thought this dish would be just "okay" and was only making it to use the zucchini blossoms my husband bought at the farmer's market. As it turned out, the ingredients all come together into something really special, with just the right balance of tart and savory flavors coming together. Served this with a Semillon, which was a sublime combo.
