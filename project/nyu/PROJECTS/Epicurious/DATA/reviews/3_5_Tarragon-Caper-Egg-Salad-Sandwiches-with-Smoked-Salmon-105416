The flavor of this was very nice, but the recipe is by my taste way too 'mayonnaisy' I put half as much mayo as the recipe calls for and it was still almost too much.

Very nice but definitely increase the amount of tarragon and smoked salmon. My son loves salmon and asked why I didn't put any into the sandwiches! I used whole wheat bread and cut into small finger sandwiches for a reception and they disappeared quickly.Easy and tasty.

Made this for a picnic along with several others. Everyone loved this one. The capers add jus the right touch.

wonderful!! I served this open faced on grilled french bread with a baby lettuce salad and slices of lemon. I used a cajun spiced salmon and added directly into the egg mixture, used red onion instead of shallot. Served for dinner with a Sauvignon Blanc..nummy!

A very good tasting egg salad. The tarragon is the key. I served this for brunch using slightly old dark rye bread sliced in half lengthwise (the "oldness" of the bread gave it a firmer texture and held up as a better base without compromising taste) and let everyone assemble their own which we ate open faced. Used arugula. Store didn't have watercress. Loved the peppery taste of the arugula. Had thinly sliced black forest ham also for those not liking salmon. One guest used both ham and salmon. Simple to do. A real keeper.

Not sure but think this is a Sara Moulton recipe so, of course, it is fabulous! Served on thinly sliced brown bread; this, really, complements the salmon (and to think someone prepared these without salmon...!).

This is wonderful! I actually made little appetizer sandwiches using both wheat and white bread. I chopped the salmon and added to the egg salad, spread on the wheat slices, topped with the watercress, then the white slices. I then cut off the crust, cut the bread at a diagonal, spead some butter on the 3 sides and pressed lightly into finely chopped chives, they were a huge hit at a recent appetizer party!

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch, at my husband's request for egg salad. I couldn't serve egg salad to company, so I searched Epicurious and it came through for me again! This is "company-worthy."

The last time I had an egg salad sandwich was at least 5 years ago, and the time before that was about the same. Usually they are a very boring sandwich ... except this one. This sandwich is delicious with the salmon, without, or just eat the egg salad out of the bowl. It is that good!

I love egg salad, I love tarragon. Apparantly not together. However I made it again with dill and it was fabulous!! forks.

Something as simple as egg salad can become blah, which is what happened with my regular egg salad recipe. So glad I found this one. It is excellent - will definitely make it often.

Great egg salad. Easy to make. I skipped the salmon and it was still marvelous.

Who knew egg salad could be enjoyed this much? My guests loved these sandwiches..I think it is the tarragon that makes all the difference in this recipe.

This is great! I substituted arugula for the watercress. I grilled one side of a slice of sourdough bread, put the arugula, salmon and egg salad on the ungrilled side and served it as an open-faced sandwich. Really satisfying.

This is a great twist to plain egg salad sandwiches. The smoked salmon, tarragon, and watercress added interesting flavors. We brought them on a picnic to an outdoor movie, and they made for a wonderful dinner. This is easy to make, which is always a plus.

These sandwiches were excellent. The salmon complements the egg salad well. I had several friends over for a girls lunch and everyone raved about these...I'd definitely make again!

This was so easy to make and delicious! I added extra tarragon and minced onions instead of shallot. My husband (who is not an egg-salad lover), just raved about the sandwich. I used a LaBrea baguette which was a little too hard and crusty. Following the instructions by using a softer bread would probably have yielded even tastier results. Oh well . . . guess I'll just have to try it again! :)

I thought this recipe was delicious, and I like the addition of smoked salmon, capers and chopped shallot. Unfortunately, I served the egg salad on a marbled rye/pumpernickle, which is wonderful with more hearty sandwiches; but the marbled bread's flavor was way too overpowering for the mixture. I could barely taste the peppery watercress, not to mention the salmon. Next time I'll definitely choose a bread that has less a distinctive flavor.

This egg salad recipe is terrific, the tarragon makes it! The combination of the egg salad with the smoked salmon creates an impressive sandwich. I used sourdough bread for a decadent picnic dinner.

Wonderful! The tarragon ties the salmon and salad together beautifully.

Definitely one of the best egg salads I've ever had. I also made it with the curried shrimp (sans dipping sauce), and the beet/tomato/pickled onion salad also from the same article. I served it on french bread rolls; they were a bit difficult to bite into, but the taste of the bread was magic with the egg salad. Also, I'm not a smoked salmon fan, and leaving that out was fine.

I made this sandwich along with the curried shrimp and cucumber dipping sauce from the same issue for an outdoor concert last week. It was a fantastic combination. This is probably the best egg salad recipe I have ever tried. The only thing I would change is that I think toasted brown bread might work better than the seeded rolls. I will definitely make this again.
