VG fall recipe - needs a little more seasoning (pepper?), but tangy taste of port/currant/cranberry sauce is real good w/ the vinaigrette. Might try with other duck parts, although breast is much easier to find/prepare. Maybe a marinade of duck? - duck sort of gets lost in the nice reduction sauce.

Excellent recipe for company....port sauce can be made ahead and kept in freezer. Duck can also be cooked day before. Store in it's own fat in fridge and then bring to room temp before slicing. This is also a beautiful dish when plated.

This was fantastic! We used leftovers from the duck that was roasted last night as well as the cranberry/cherry chutney. I thought the dressing was an excellent compliment to the salad and the combination of flavors were so diverse!

Fantastic flavor combinations. Saved time by buying a whole, roasted, sliced duck at the Chinese bakery. Saved face by serving my greens-suspicious family with a plate that essentially doubled the duck, halved the salad. Stupendous meal. Spend $4.00 for a loaf of high-end fruit nut bread. You CAN do this on a work day.

This was truly a wonderful and different salad - perfect for Fall or winter. The walnut-raisin bread (I used pecan-raisin bread) with melted brie was wonderful, as was the duck with the port sauce (I used cranberries too). Don't toss out the onion and apple when you make the port sauce - it's wonderful as a relish drizzled over the duck,tossed with some of the sherry wine vinaigrette!

I made this for my family on Mothers Day and it blew everyone away. This is a keeper.

I work as a Private Chef for a couple who love exotic cuisine. I made this Duck salad for them recently. They both agreed that it was the best Duck recipe they have ever tasted. One change I made to the dish was ommiting the currants and adding dried cranberries instead. Don't throw the apple-onion compote away that was used to make the port sauce reduction. I plated the Duck on top of it. All of the flavors work so well together. Needless to say. This recipe is a keeper!!!

To the cook with a stupid question: No question is EVER stupid, we are all at different points in our culinary education. Baby spinach and arugula would be terrific, you could use any other mix of lettuce such as a spring mix (you will find it in a bag pre-washed), mesclun, endive, radicchio, etc.

This sauce is divine! the combination is so absolutely good. I served this as a main dish with expanding the portions just a little.

I've made this recipe and also made the sauce with my own duck breast entree. My guests were asking for more sauce and duck and wanted to lick the remaining sauce from the plates. My only suggestion is to make more sauce than you think you will need. My friends still talk about my duck breasts and sauce and how they haven't had anything close to it. I have to admit it is the best duck/sauce recipe I have ever had!

This is probably a stupid question, but what constitutes mixed greens? Was thinking about doing this with fresh baby spinash and arugula.

Terrific salad. We used left over duck and pecan-spice bread with brie. Easy to prepare, wonderful layering of flavors with the walnut oil, port sauce, and wine vinegar pared with the rich duck. A real stand out.

A FOABS (small vacationing club) favorite. Every member raved! It will be a definate favorite for years to come. We like the Brie as the Pont l' Eveque coating is to smelly!

Excellent main course salad. Have made this quite a few times since it was published. More of a special occassion meal due to price, but very much worth it in the end.

I have made this dish many times (I LOVE Charlie Trotter!). It is EXCELLENT. I used Brie cheese, and a pecan/raisin bread from our local Bread & Circus. It makes a great summer dinner, and is equally great as a first course for a very elegant meal. It can be a bit expensive to buy the Port ... but the sauce is well worth it. I have also used lamb instead of the duck.

Delicious! Fresh from a hunt, my duck breasts were already skinned. I sauteed them in a combination walnut oil and butter and they were great. The sauce has already become a family favorite and it has many uses when cooking wild game.

I am a caterer and made this salad for a dinner party for 25. It was a huge hit! I have also made it without the duck to serve with a veal entree and it was just as good. Its easy to prepare, the port sauce can be made several days ahead and served just a touch warmer than room temp. Fabulous salad!!
