This is a staple appetizer now, its so good and easy. I open the bagette & toast under broiler, then spread with the goat cheese mixed with 1 7 oz container pesto. Then you can slice & wrap in tin foil. I have frozen & reheated this way & no one even knew & still asked for recipe. Its a great Make head appetizer that also travels well for someone elses party !

This was a big hit and couldn't be easier. The spatula is a crucial tool for flipping.

Simple beauty. A hit every time. I have served with the cheese sauce on the side as indicated, and also have spooned some sauce on the breadsticks and passed the tray around as a finger food.

Amazing recipe. Served on broiled crusty baguette brushed with pesto/oil mixture. Used 1 1.2 logs goat cheese with 1 container pesto so not as strong.

This review is for the spread only, as I used it as a 'dip' for crusty bread, toasted pitas, and grainy crackers. Served this at my housewarming party...about half of my 75 guests asked for the recipe! Buy a good-quality pesto...makes all the difference. Yum!

Excellent! A huge hit with the guests and with me. My only complaint is that there was too much goat cheese / pesto spread. I definitely think you could half the recipe. 11 oz of goat cheese mixed with 7 oz of pesto is a lot of spread!!! With the breadsticks already coated in an additional 7 oz of pesto, my guests did not use a lot of spread - and there was A LOT left over. Granted, I did use some of the leftover spread in omelettes the next day, but it was still too much. I'd buy 5 1/2 oz of goat cheeze, and mix it with less pesto. All around, however -- an EXCELLENT DISH!

These are addictively good! I literally have to stop myself from eating more than one as they are not for the diet conscious. If you love these, try the pesto-goat cheese stuffed chicken breasts on this site. Spectacular.

Circumstances turned mine into crostini rather than bread sticks. The store was out of baguettes so I picked up a loaf of sliced sourdough peasant bread. I cut the slices in half, topped them with the pesto/oil mixture, and toasted them in the oven and served them with the goat cheese-pesto spread as directed. Easy and delicious. It isn't often that you find something so good that involves so few ingredients.

I loved this recipe! It was delicious! A huge hit with the family. Even my sister who is extremely picky. I just made half the recipe and had enough left. I broiled it instead of grilled and it worked just as good. Delicous!

Wonderful appetizer for a meal. The goat cheese spread can be saved and also used on plain bread or crackers.
