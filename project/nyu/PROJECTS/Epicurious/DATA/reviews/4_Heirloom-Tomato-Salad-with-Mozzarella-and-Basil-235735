This recipe was really good. The key to it is using the best and freshest ingredients when they are in season- i.e. for tomatoes, late summer. I used a variety of heirloom tomatoes from the local farmer's market, grape tomatoes, fresh basil plucked from my basil plant, and tiny pearls of fresh mozzarella that are sold in liquid. The dressing was delicious as written. All in all, a keeper if looking for a tossed mozzarella and tomato salad.

I made this for my husband and myself for dinner last night. I served it with a pasta, but this was definitely the star at dinner. I used 1 lb campari (pingpong sized tomatoes) that I quartered, and 6 oz cubed mozzarella. I didn't measure the ingredients exactly, just poured to taste. There ended up being a little too much dressing for the tomatoes and mozzarella. Not really a problem though, and was delicious to sop up with garlic bread. I substituted white balsamic vinegar (after much discussion with hubby, he wanted regular balsamic) and it turned out perfect! I was afraid regular balsamic would have to strong a flavor for the tomato and basil. i'm sure any of the three, red wine, balsamic, or white balsamic would end up delicious, but the lightness and brightness of the white balsamic complimented the flavors perfectly! We will definitely make this many many more times!

This is a REALLY good salad. The basil acts as the 'greens'. I used shredded mozzarella because I had it. If I were serving it to company or for a special dinner I would buy the perlini (if i can find it).

It was okay. admittedly, I used arugula instead of basil, but I thought the dressing was just so-so. For this dish, less is definitely more. I ended up jarring 3/4ths of the dressing.

This was a nice crowd pleaser and the torn fresh basil really brought something special to the table.

I'll second the reviewer who said too salty. I threw out the first batch, made the second without salt, and it was fine.

Haven't tried this yet but heading to the farmer's market for heirloom tomatoes and the dressing sounds great. Has anyone tried slicing the heirlooms and mozza and stacking? To me this would look more elegant.

This recipe was wonderful. I used white balsamic, as suggested, and in an equal amount to the oil - 1/3 cup. I added the salt half a teaspoon at a time just in case, but thought it was fine in the end. Delicious and a big hit with everyone.

Dressing was great. I added 2 T. balsamic and doubled the Dijon. Salad showcased our homegrown basil and heirloom tomatoes, but fresh mozzarella always leaves me wondering why bother. Family liked this salad a lot, though, along with thick grilled steaks, potato salad and fresh corn on the cob.

Excellent summer salad. The cherry tomatoes are not necessary, but lightly salted fresh mozzerella is.

A delicious, simple and impressive salad when you want something different. My guests loved it, and all requested the recipe! This one will become a staple.

Very tasty as written and so easy!! I will definitely make this again, as I enjoyed it as much on my tossed spring greens as I did on the heirlooms, basil, & mozzarella

I have been making my own salad dressings since I was 10 years old and I have never made one that turned out to be so salty. I tossed it out and served the salad with a basic balsamic vinaigrette. Since I seem to be in the minority, I would only make it again just to see whether I did something wrong the first time around.

Rick from Savannah Loved it. Easy to make and we served as an appetizer with Black-Olive Grissini sticks. Suggest you wait until last minute to add dressing.

I made this last night with several varieties of heirloom tomatoes. My husband loved it. So did I. It was more complex than the normal heirloom tomato salad recipe. The mozzarella and basil really added good flavor and texture. I will make this again and again as long as i have wonderful fresh tomatoes. Of course, you must use heirloom tomatoes, NOT the regular supermarket tomatoes. Also more colors the better - so big yellow, little red, green tomatoes, purple, etc.

We really liked this recipe, however, we changed the proportions. To our tastes there was too much olive oil and not enough vinegar. But after a little bit of experimenting, it came out very tasty!

Delicious, but have to agree with the previous reviewer on the substitution of white balsamic for the red wine vinegar. Otherwise, made exactly as written. BTW, Trader Joe's also has some excellent (and very affordable) dijon mustard.

I loved this recipe with one litte change. I used white balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. It's not as strong as regular balsamic. You can get it at Trader Joe's. I've made it several times. Want to get my fill of fresh tomatoes before they're all gone.

Three & 1/2 forks. I made the dressing as stated, but didn't think it was flavorful enough (my dijon mustard isn't very strong). I remade the dressing with balsamic vinegar and lemon infused olive oil and that really perked it up! I will make again! It was a hit!

already done this twice. I am so used to tomato/mozarella/basil salads to come with a drizzle of v. good olive oil, that I was reluctant to use the balsamic + mustard.. but it is absolutely delicious. probably one of the best mozarella tomato basil salads I had.

Fabulous recipe, perfect for the farmer's market bounty! I used a lemon-infused olive oil and added a little extra basil than the recipe called for. This was made as a side dish for a lobster feast, and it was a hit.

This was really a hit. Would definately make it again. I used roma tomatoes diced, since we had lots of them from the garden.

I too usually think that fewer ingredients are better with fresh summer tomatos. (a little salt, pepper, and balsamic) However, I found the mustard ingredient compelling and followed the recipe through. It was delicious.

This is a lovely salad anytime of year, especially paired with a crispy Italian bread. I would like to add in response to swright's comment: Some people, unlike you, were not born knowing. I always thought this list was for everyone, regardless of experience. All the instructions leave naught to the imagination, and that will assist novices to enjoy even the simple recipes. What may seem basic or simple to you, may not be to someone else. *smiles*

How is this a recipe? This is just something any intelligent cook would do as a delicious side dish or just a wonderful thing to have for a quick lunch. I think we are owed more than such simplistic instructions that any of us can figure out on our own.

I grow Brandywines and basil every year, and I would not dress these spectacular ingredients with such a potent vinaigrette. I just: Slice tomatoes thickly, slice big fresh mozzerella into rounds, arrange slices of both on platter, add kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, add a handful of basil leaves (anywhere from whole leaves to shredded), add more salt and pepper and drizzle again with olive oil. Case closed. Sublime; a simple, stunning meal in itself to die for.

Just as good, fewer ingredients. Good quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar in equal amounts (or to taste), tomatoes and cheese. Basil should be fresh as possible, but will give off more flavor if coarsely chopped. Chop in some flat-leaf Italian parsley too, if it's available. Oh, and any good, ripe summer tomato will do. Doesn't have to be heirloom. In winter and in a pinch, the more expensive grocery store cherry tomaotes are even passable.

Absolutely unbelievably delicious. I picked up some really nice heirloom tomatoes at a local farmers market and they definitely made all the difference. My husband even loved it and he doesnt like tomatoes! I will definitely make this again!

What a great salad! Easy and a real hit with my guests. I made it with the grilled corn, grilled salmon, and green beans & arugula (all from July, 2006) and got nothing but raves.
