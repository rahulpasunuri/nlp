I quite enjoyed this recipe. I don't really like salads in the winter (too cold!) so the warmth was much appreciated. I too tossed the greens with the dressing over heat to slightly wilt the greens before serving it alongside prosciutto & swiss stuffed chicken breasts and roasted heirloom carrots. Delicious!

I love this recipe, but I'll admit that I've changed it in two significant respects. First, I don't feel that the olive oil is necessary at all. Second, I quickly toss the greens with the dressing over heat so that the greens wilt slightly. Very, very good!

I made this exactly as stated and was disappointed in the outcome. My husband didn't like the warm dressing on the cold greens. What was leftover I put in the frig and had the next day for lunch. To be truthful, it was better then!
