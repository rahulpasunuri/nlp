Delicious, uncomplicated way to serve a salad that's a nice change from the usual pasta-type ones. Stays fresh, travels well. Actually tastes better the next day. We will definately have again.

I made this for co-workers and they just loved it. I did find it a little dry so added more dressing

Instead of dill, which I did not have, I used snippings of some of the herbs in my garden -- tarragon, cilantro, marjoram, oregano -- and tossed in some dried cranberries, which I think another cook here suggested. It was delicious.

this was an excellent salad to prepare ahead and take on our boat for a day sail. Even the kids liked it. I added the suggested cranberries and also some toasted pecans. Yum Yum. Served it with BBQ pork loins.

I was looking for a good recipe for wheat berries. This is it with one additional ingredient. I threw in a handful of dried cranberries. It was a big hit for a Fourth of July barbeque.
