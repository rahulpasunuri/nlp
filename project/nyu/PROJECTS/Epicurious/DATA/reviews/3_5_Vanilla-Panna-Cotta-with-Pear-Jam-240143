I thought this recipe was really easy and fun to make. I would definitely make it again. I made this recipe for my Cadette cooking badge. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer to whip half the cream. It tasted so good that my sister ate half of mine. I didn't make the pear sauce. Instead I poured strawberry syrup over it and put some strawberries on the side.

This was my first time making panna cotta and the recipe was easy to follow. I added the whole amount of sugar to the pear jam ONLY because I also added cinnamon, allspice, and cloves. The panna cotta was a little hard to get out of the ramekins, but the third was easier than the first so I think it is a matter of experience. Since making this, I've read some tips here and there on making panna cotta and I would certainly include some of them in my next attempt, namely whipping half of the heavy cream to increase thickness. I did not use vanilla beans because I cannot taste the difference. Perhaps I would for a special occasion.

This was delicious. Since I lost count while I was adding the gelatin I may not have put in enough which meant it was a little bit watery. But I asked myself what would Julia Child do and so I froze it. Please....don't be afraid, it was fabulous. Nobody knew!!!! Just didn't call it panna cotta. While the pearsauce, as in applesauce was sweet it was delicious. A sprig of mint and bah dah bing....a very easy and delicious and pretty dessert!!! Will do again for sure.

Very easy recipe and very delicious! I served mine in small chocolate cups with apricot jam and they were wonderful. I also only cooled them until the Panna Cotta was just set. This way they were creamy and reminded me of Creme Brulee.

Following the advice of previous reviewers, I cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup and added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. The end product was good -- sort of like apple pie with ice cream, minus the crust. The pear jam was fairly sweet even after reducing the sugar, and I was worried that it might not provide as nice of a contrast for the panna cotta as a tart berry would. This may still be true, but the recipe turned out pretty well.

you can top with any fresh fruit, jam,etc. panna cotta is a lovely canvass for showing off whatever fruit is in season. I personally will be macerating fresh peaches and topping with that the next time i make panna cotta.

This was a wonderful, elegant dessert. My family enjoyed it. The fruit sauce was too sweet for me, but I don't have to have that kind of a sauce on it. Berry sauce, apple, whatever would work just as well. Make to your sweet taste. This is a magnificent dessert, easy to prepare, and would make a wonderful dessert for dinner guests.

Not a review, a question. I LOATHE pears. They make me gag, they set my teeth on edge. I CANNOT stand them. Would apples work instead?

This seems like just panna cotta with pureed, oversweetened pears. Jam eh...Probably would be nice with actual pear jam, with cinnamon and cloves, like the other reviewer noted.

Very simple and delicious; the pear jam, however, was a little on the sweet side. Also added ground cinnamon and minced candied ginger to the panna cotta while cooking.
