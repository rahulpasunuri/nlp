Was very good, marinaded a beef flank cut for 6 hours before grilling kabobs. I forgot the garlic, so threw in powder, didn't have gin or juniper berries, and used juice instead of lemon and orange peel respectively. The meat was very tender, quite flavorful and I intend to use this recipe again. Hopefully I'll find some juniper berries by then.

This is a great marinade for venison. If I do a loin, I leave it whole and slice it after grilling. That keeps the marinade from overpowering the meat. If I do a bigger roast, like from the haunch, I leave it in the marinade overnight. Definitely make the effort to find juniper berries rather than use gin.

I've used this twice and really like it. Very nice with fresh herbs.

I've used this marinade on several occasions and it is really excellent. I find it's best with red meats (i.e. beef, lamb), since it overpowers chicken even when lightly marinated. It is just an exceptional sauce (I've only made it with the crushed juniper berries and not the gin, though). It also works best on meats cooked over a charcoal barbecue, though can be used with other cooking methods.

I used this marinade with wild pheasant and it was lovely. I'm not especially fond on wild fowl, but as my husband enjoys game, I'm always looking for ways to make it more interesting.

Nice marinade for beef

This marinade is worth the hype. Made it for a party, used pork tenderloin. It was fabulous! It gave the pork a beautiful rich brown color on the outside and the meat was truly tender. The cooked flavor was subtle but flavorful. Not overpowering like a teriyaki can be. Can't wait to try it on chicken. Definitely worth the effort.

What a disappointment after all of those positive reviews. And what a waste of $100 worth of filet mignon. This is mediocre, at best.

VERY easy to make! My son just LOVED it! I used it on chicken which turned out nice and moist.

It does work on venison, very well if the molasses and juniper berries are reduced by half.

Do you think this would work with venison?

The others said everything that needs to be said, I just want to concur.

Wonderful. Could taste the marinade all through the beef. Made some substitutions. Switched vinegar to red wine vinegar.Added maple syrup for molasses. No citrus peel so I added lemon, lime and ruby red grapefruit juice. Family loved it.

I was a bit hesitant a first. I'm not a fan of molasses or cloves (I used allspice instead), however after marinating for 8 hours, I could not believe how wonderful they worked together. This is a keeper.

This was excellent. I made it last weekend and used it with T-Bone steaks......they melted in your mouth and the taste was devine!

I was a little leary because of the combination of ingredients, but my family loved it. The sweetness from the molasses, and the tartness of the vinegar makes an interesting combination. I am planning on using it for a upcoming dinner party.

It certainly did the trick. I used a specific low grade meat - flank steak (to prove a point) it came out tender as ever! I marinaded the steak for approx. 6 hours in the refridgerator. I stored this great receipe in my computer. I would like to take a moment to talk to you about your epicurious food. I have surfed most of the cooking websites and found your site to be leaps and bounds above the rest. Keep up the good work!!

This marinade was the star of the show at a barbeque yesterday in honor of Father's Day (sorry, Dads)! Sweet and savory, it was fabulous on the steaks. Thanks again, Epicurious Food! My friends and family are beginning to believe I am a culinary genius.
