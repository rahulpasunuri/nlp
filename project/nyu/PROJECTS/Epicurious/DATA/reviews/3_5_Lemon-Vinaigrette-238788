Bump up the lemon juice to 1/3c and you have perfection. The trouble making the lemon oil is worth it. Served Mâche dressed in this vinaigrette along side smoked trout mousse (recipe on epicurious) and it was a stunning hit at Easter dinner as the opener.

This didn't work for us. 3/4 cup oil (total) to 1/4 cup lemon juice was just too oily. The flavor was nice, so I didn't want to just add more lemon juice. There are much better vinaigrettes out there.

This is truly a special recipe. It has a unique quality that is really fun, especially if your guests have sophisticated palates and can appreciate the nuances. The ingredients are not the sorts of things that one has lying around, however, so it takes some planning, but it's not difficult.

WOW! I wanted to make a salad to go with some great loin lamb chops and this is what I went with. I did alter it, but only slightly. To the canola oil, lemon peel, thyme (not lemon, but regular garden thyme was what I had) and lemon grass, I added one crushed clove of garlic. Finished the recipe as written and tossed it with some baby lettuce and avocado and red onion. Believe it or not, it was a bigger hit than the lamb chops! Try it, its great. Thanks Dan Barber, a great recipe
