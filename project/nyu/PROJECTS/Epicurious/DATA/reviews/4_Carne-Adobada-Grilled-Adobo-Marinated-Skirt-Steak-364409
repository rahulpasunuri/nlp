Definitely a crowd pleaser! My kids even loved. I used chipolte and ancho chilis because it's what I had on hand. This will be a staple for taco nights!

I have been looking for a good skirt steak taco recipe for ever. This is it. I have also used the leftover adobo for pork chops, pork loin, and have two chickens trussed and marinating for the rotisserie tonight. Great recipe. p.s. Go find a mexican grocery for thin sliced skirt steak. It will be way less than at the regular supermarket.

I have put the adobo on skirt steak and pork chops; I thought it was much better on pork, but still good on beef. Definitely a keeper.

I used the marinade on strip steak and chicken and it was wonderful for both.

I made this last night. Followed the recipe to the letter, and this turned out better than expected. one thing I do is heat my flour tortillas on my griddle and then build the taco inside the tortilla. This is a keeper!

I love the adobada tooked on a spit and served in Mexico so was thrilled to see this recipe. I pulled a flank steak out of the freezer and I happened to have all of the other ingredients on hand (those are dried chilies by the way). When the adobo was finished, I wasn't sure if we were going to like it. But once that steak hit the grill - WOW! The aromas were fantastic. We just sliced up the meat and served alongside some refried beans and a simple salad. Definitely a keeper recipe and company worthy.
