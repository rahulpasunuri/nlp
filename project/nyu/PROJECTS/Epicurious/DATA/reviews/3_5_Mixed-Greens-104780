I love greens! For 2 of us, I use 1/2 lb. Trader Joe's mixed Southern greens. I saute a little bacon or pancetta, half an onion & garlic, & add the greens & 1 cup chicken broth. Cook for 45 minutes to an hour, and before serving add some Tappey's hot pepper vinegar. Healthy & Oh So Good!

Very good, despite the fact that I spaced out, and just used collards. (Don't ask me how I missed the "mixed" part of the title of the recipe.) My husband usually hates greens but devoured these--surely has nothing to do with the bacon! Might reduce the water to 5c. next time.

My first time making collards. Came out delicious. I gave them an extra hour on the stove - my guests were late. I served them up with a sprinkling of brown sugar, handful of chooped shallots, dash of Tabasco and vinegar. Everyone loved this.

This is a good recipie. Although, you do not have to add any meat to this dish. I prefer smoked turney drums. Add them to hot water, let them boil slowly for 2-3 hours, take out of water and let cool. Clean the meat off of the bone, cut in smaller pieces. I also drain part of the water the meat cooked in and add "fresh" water. Throw cleaned, chopped collard greens to pot add seasoning that you desire. Beau Monte seasoning, Season All, Black Pepper - very good.

I made a variation of this with the turnip greens and collards that came in my CSA box this week. I thought it was delicious, and I don't usually like these kinds of greens much. After rendering the bacon fat and pouring off most of it, I sauteed a minced onion and 3 cloves of garlic in the remaining bacon fat, then wilted the greens in it, added 2 cups of water and put the whole thing in a pressure cooker for about 30 minutes. It probably doesn't need to pressure-cook that long, but the greens were really meltingly tender when done. Finished with s&p and balsamic vinegar, then a dash of liquid smoke. Not planning on tossing out the pot-liquor!

This was soooooo gooood! Talk about a pot-likker...Yum! Only, I must say I prepared them just a little differently then in the recipe. First I sauteed the greens in the rendered fat (until they were slightly wilted). Then I added onion and a little crushed red pepper to the liquid as they were cooking. With just a little less water and "gently" boiling the greens they were ready to eat in (only) about 10 minutes. However, I did keep them cooking for a couple of hours after that and they just kept getting better and better. The broth is outstanding! I served them with "balsamic" vineger right before eating. I have made this two times since using just collard greens and using just kale....It appears all greens cook up GREAT THIS WAY! Mmmmmm... No Salt - No butter...All's I can say is you'll probably fall in love with greens if you make them this way!
