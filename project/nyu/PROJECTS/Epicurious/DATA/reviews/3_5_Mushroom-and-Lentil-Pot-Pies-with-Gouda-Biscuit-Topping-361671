Delicious and filling! Definitely needs 4-5 TABLESPOONS of butter for the biscuit. And I agree with other reviewers that you should put half of the gouda in the biscuit mix and the other half on top. Might try to use sage sausage in lieu of one of the potatoes. And definitely be generous with the herbs.

Great recipe! The biscuit topping is so amazing, I want to make it just on its own. I mixed the cheese into the dough, which turned out great. The mushroom and lentils are wonderful with the herbs (which I added more of, of course), though I wanted a little less potato. Maybe next time I'll make it with sweet potatoes. Super good - I'd definitely make again.

Delicious! I admit I was pleasantly surprised. The flavors are amazing. Notes: I used Black Trumpet instead of Porcini, based on what I had on hand. (Who doesn't just have Black trumpet on hand? ;) I might have added a bit more soy sauce.

The flavor was pretty good. I'm also pretty sure the topping recipe should be 4 T of butter, not 4 t. Kinda surprised that Bon Appetit hasn't corrected it.

I used 4 tablespoons of butter for the topping. Next time, I will mix the Gouda into the topping instead of putting it on top. I added more garlic, sage, and thyme than the recipe called for and also added some hot pepper flakes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very tasty!! I will definitely make this again!

Made this as stated except I didn't use the sage. I made it in one large rectangular Pyrex, and that worked well. Overall it is good, but when I first tasted the filling it was a little bland. I sprinkled some red pepper flakes on my serving, which kicked the flavor up considerably, and made it delicious. The crust is really delicious as well. Will make again.

I made this recipe as described and again with some modifications. It was very good on its own, but the second time I added more salt, and stir in some leftover meat (chicken, turkey, steak). Also, you could easily just use different kinds of mushrooms rather than go through the rehydrating step, and use canned lentils instead of dried ones to save time. The crust is EXCELLENT as is.

Fantastic recipe! I did take everyone's notes into consideration...and it was a HUGE hit! Even for the non-vegitarians! Changs: I cleaned out the fridge and added a little cabbage, frozen peas, parsnips instead of potatoes, celery and I think double the lentils. I omitted the the tomato paste and thyme (didn't have any) and added red wine in place of the dried mushrooms (didn't have any). I ended up with more of the filling than the recipe called for but it balanced well with the topping. I used a really nice sharp goat cheese IN the topping instead of ON the topping and the whole package was just great! Will do again!! (oh, and yes, TABLEspoons of butter not TEAspoons of butter!)

Perfect, as other reviewers said, for a cold winter night. I used more dried porcinis than the recipe called for. The porcini broth "makes" the dish. The flavor is distinctively delicious. I used sharp white cheddar on the crust and it baked to perfection. Did not make individual pies...just one big one.

I thought this was great. It gets 4 stars for being vegetarian. Meat eaters probably about a 3. I also think 4tsp butter is WAY off. I used 5Tbs and it probably could've done with 6. Next time I'm going to try adding the cheese at the last minute. Having the cheese on it during the entire baking time made it melt into a sheet that melded to the biscuit topping making it cumbersome to break through with a fork. It was GREAT though. Porcini liquid is gold man.

This recipe has become one of our weekly staples because I find it so easy to make now, all the ingredients are usually on hand, etc. I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it, with the exception of the gouda which I omitted since my husband won't eat cheese. On subsequent occasions, since I wasn't that wowed by the porcini flavor, I leave out the porcinis entirely and sub chicken broth for the porcini soaking liquid. I know this makes it no longer vegetarian, but I'm just looking for something flavorful with veggies, and healthy, and this does the trick. For me, the chicken broth really added a nice richness to the favor. If you have a food processor, the crust comes together in a snap and is really good.

This dish was delicious, and a perfect comfort food with fewer calories than usual. To cut down on cooking time, I used cooked lentils from Trader Joe's (about 2 cups, so a bit more than the recipe called for) and no dried porcinis. Instead of the soaking liquid, I used chicken stock for flavor. It was great and cut out a lot of prep time. Don't use a full 3 cups or else you'll have too much liquid. Two and a half is probably better. It cuts down on the health factor a little, but I had to add more butter - probably an extra 3 tsp. - because the crust was still overwhelmingly flour and cornmeal. I also folded some gouda into the crust in addition to sprinkling it on top, which adds some great flavor. I cooked everything in one big dish since we didn't have smaller pans and it still came out great. Just increase the cooking time by 10-15 minutes. I'll definitely be making this again!

I thought this was really good, especially for a cold night. I do agree that the amount of butter in the crust must be wrong.

Rating: 4
This is very easy. I didn't have porcinis so I used dry Marsala wine for the liquid. I also added finely chopped celery. It works in a large baking dish if you don't have individual dishes.

Rating: 4
We loved this, even my carnivore husband had seconds. I'm puzzled by the poor reviews. I followed the directions as written with two exceptions: made this in a single dish, and mixed the cheese into the biscuit topping. Will make again.

Rating: 4
Made this just as shown with two big exceptions - I soaked the porcini for 1 hour, really intensifying the flavor of the leftover water, and I omitted the topping and just used a puff pastry. My picky wife loved it, and I thought it turned out great...

Rating: 3
I didn't want a pot pie but a stew, so I just eliminated the crust. I thought the stew itself was a little bland. Next time, I'll use fresh herbs and a little wine in the sauce. Makes for a good vegetarian dinner. I also think parsnips instead of potatoes would be tasty.

Rating: 3
I really liked this recipe, but if I make it again I will change it s bit. I think instead of using the dried mushrooms, I'll used fresh and add veggie stock in place of the mushroom liquid, and perhaps bake the biscuit topping a bit before adding the cheese so it doesn't get a bit over cooked. All in all a very tasty recipe, just a lot of work and a lot of cleanup, but I got my picky husband to eat it so mega plus.

I agree with A Cook below. I would give this recipe 3.5 stars too. Although it was more time consuming than I thought it would be, it was definitely delicious. Silly me didn't have garlic on hand like I usually do (which probably would have just made this so much better) but it was still good without it. I also added some mushroom broth when all the vegetables were simmering. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T, including the crusts, and it was a great meal for a cold NYC night.

Rating: 3
I would give this 3.5 stars if I could...not exceptional but definitely not as bad as most of the other reviewers so far. I have to admit I made some fairly significant changes. I had this for Thxsgvg main course and reading the recipe ahead of time I thought the crust would be too time consuming based on all the other dishes I had to make. So I sub'd with puff pastry, little egg wash and grated gruyere instead - so good! Didn't miss the buttermilk crust. Also added more veggies and potatoes, and sage and parsley for more fresh flavor. Even though I halved the recipe (I'm the only vegetarian in my family) I ended up with two large individual pot pies for the freezer. They didn't make it past first week of December....I will definitely be making again!!

Rating: 1
Although the filling for this pie is delicious, the biscuit topping is heavy and overpowers the dish. The smoked gouda I used did not melt at all and became a very unpleasant crisp web over the topping. Two of my guests just ate the filling. I would make this again, minus the topping and serve it with garlic bread.

Rating: 3
I mostly followed the recipe in the magazine as printed. I omitted potatoes added more carrot and a little parsnip, added a little more garlic and did not have dried sage, so added fresh at the end with the cooked lentils. I found the dough to be a bit heavier and cakey than I would have liked, and will add more butter next time and add the cheese for the last few minutes to keep it from getting to hard, since I had the same tough time getting through the crust as others did. I thought this was very tasty once it was seasonsed with salt and pepper. I will make it again and add the dried sage and use more butter in the crust. I also might try smoked gouda for additional flavor or blue cheese. Be sure to use porcinis or add porcini powder since a big portion of the flavor is coming from there.

Rating: 2
As written, the recipe is surprisingly bland, and the biscuit topping recipe had to be incorrect (I added additional buttermilk rather than more butter and it came out fine). I used extra garlic, sage and thyme, but I agree that sherry or red wine would really help the flavor. I used a 2.5 qt. baking dish instead of individual dishes. The serving size is huge, incidentally. We easily fed six.

Rating: 3
I made this on the weekend and we really enjoyed it. I didn't use gouda since we can't have cheese, so I added dill to the dough instead. Will try the suggestion of adding sherry to the mushrooms next time.

Rating: 3
This recipe was very tasty, but that's only because I checked out the reviews first. I added all the extra's that were suggested by my fellow cooks. Cooking sherry, Less Mushrooms, more sage, beef broth and of course the 4 TABLEspoons of butter. The poster clearly made a mistake. All in all it was a very good meal.

Rating: 2
I liked this alot, however, it definitely does need some additions. I deglazed the mushrooms with dry sherry, added two additional garlic cloves, a can of chicken broth, beef bouillon and some Worcestershire sauce. If you don't it is pretty bland. I really enjoyed the crust too. Sprinkled the cheese on about halfway through cooking. Also, increased butter to 4 tbsp. Very nice for a winters night!

Rating: 3
I took everyone's reviews into consideration and did the following, which made it delish! Skipped the porcinis, used chicken broth (beef would be better) and some dry cooking sherry for flavor and to sub the porcini liquid, used some butter to sautee the shrooms, and added more sage and s+p and put the gouda on the biscuit topping about half way through. I cheated and used store bought biscuit dough and no one would have suspected! This is a great variation on chicken pot pie and perfect fall comfort food! :-)

4 forks down-- just awful--- too much work to make this and the taste was awful and we cook all he time different receipe . I would never make this again there are too many other things to eat. ughhhhhh

4 forks down. too much work and no flavor and the biscuit topping is a disaster. Don't even bother trying this there are too many others to try. this was not worth any effort-- I only ate 3 bites gag me.....I will go back to chicken pot pie-- sorry but we cook all the time and this was so bad....

This recipe was kind of interesting...I made the filling on Sunday and let it sit for 2 days before I turned it into pot pies. I think that helped the flavors to develop. The biscuit topping was rather dry and tough, I will probably add more butter next time. Also, melting the cheese on top gave a beautiful look, but it made the topping really difficult to get through....I think I would freshen up the filling next time by using less of the dried mushrooms and more of the fresh, and by also adding a chopped parsnip. All that said, my husband loved this dish and I liked the fact that 4 pot pies was enough for us to have 2 dinners, so that was helpful...

We really, really enjoyed this. BUT: I'm pretty sure the 4 teaspoons of butter in the biscuits was supposed to be 4 tablespoons, so that's what I used. The topping was tender and great. I put this in one big shallow baking dish, 8 X 12 I think, and it could have used more topping to cover. Or a deeper dish next time. Anyway, we thought it was really delicious.

I like mushrooms but this was way too much for me. I did not even use the full amount of fresh mushrooms and it was still overwhelming. I liked the crust and used shredded cheddar on the top since it's all I had at the time. I would consider making again but would definitely cut back on the mushrooms and add other vegetables in their place.

This wasn't as good as it sounded. The crust was tough, even with 3 tbsp of butter. I also put 1/3 of the cheese in the crust to try to add some fat. The filling needed something to brighten it up, like vinegar, or lemon juice, or parsley. Just not great.

I thought this was really good! I added more garlic and a beef boullion cube, other than that made the recipe exactly as instructed. Very tasty and would make this again!

This was really good! I substituted some butternut squash for the potatoes (because I needed to use it up) and it worked well. I also had to use skim milk instead of buttermilk in the topping and it turned out just fine. Next time I'll probably skip the tomato paste (I thought it took away from the mushroomy-ness) and unless I'm cooking for 4, I'll probably make it in a skillet instead of individual baking dishes - easier for divvying up the leftovers.

My wife and I really liked this recipe. I had a small piece of steak that I cut up, browned and added to the filling. Also went heavier on the sage and thyme. Four teaspoons of butter did not seem right in the topping. It didn't look right until I had put in about 3 Tablespoons. That was enough to make a good dough and a great crust when baked.

Rating: 0
This was pretty good, but not amazing. The biscuit topping is lovely but the Gouda on top created a crust that was a little hard to get through! I think maybe adding it for the last 10 minutes of baking would solve this. Also, the flavor doesn't improve as leftovers - I had one a few days later and was not impressed.

This was good...the biscuit topping was great. Definitely be sure to season the filling with salt and pepper as indicated in the recipe. I forgot to do this (plus I used low sodium soy sauce) and the filling was quite bland. I even think the filling could benefit from adding a cube of vegetable bullion right before simmering 13-15 minutes.
