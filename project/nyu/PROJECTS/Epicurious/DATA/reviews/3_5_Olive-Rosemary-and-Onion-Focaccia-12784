Definitely needs more salt. Also was a little too dry. Not my first time making foccacia and I was not impressed with this recipe.

Very easy and quick to make. Used store bought olive tapenade rather than having to pit and slice olives which worked perfectly.

Very easy and makes an extremely versatile focaccia; can use onion, olive, sun-dried tomato, parmesan, roasted garlic or flavored oils to customize. Start to finish I made in under 3 1/2 hours.

Made this as an informal appetizer. Served with olive oil and Balsamic for dipping. Excellent results! Easy and full of flavor. Served with a nice Chianti. Will definately make again.

I thought the bread was a little dry. The top was moist, but not the inside.

Great, easy and gets rave reviews every time. I use my bread machine to make this -- just put all the ingredients in it and set it to 'dough' setting. When the dough is done, then continue on with the other steps. I've made this many times -- and have tried adding things on top -- roasted garlic, minced artichoke hearts, asiago cheese, Everything works out wonderfully!

Wonderful!!! I'm not much of a baker, but this was sooo easy and delicious. I made it following the receipe the first time, and it turned out perfectly. We loved it so much I made it again the following day, this time adding minced garlic into dough with the rosemary, and topping with red peppers I roasted and some fresh basil (I was going to try sun dried tomato, but didn't have any - I'll do that next time). I'm going to use it to make my husband's sandwiches for lunch....

This is the first time I've attempted bread - It was so easy to make and the taste was incrediable. I added 1/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan to the top of the bread before cooking. I was amazed at how beautiful my creation was! I will make this again!!! Note: I did not make any adjustments for high altitude.

This was one of the best focaccia's I have ever made. The entire family loved it and my 15 year old son said I should definately make this again. I doubled the rosemary and onion and made the dough in the bread machine and it was completely delicious. Does everyone know how to pit all those olives? - squash them with the flat side of a large knife and the pit comes right out.

Wonderful taste and texture! It was fun to make and looks very appetizing. It doesn't keep very well so I would suggest using it all the day it is baked. I definitely would not freeze it.

This is a great recipe. I cut the "round" into top and bottom sections and then layered on some fresh meats and cheeses along with some fresh veggies to make a large sandwich to be sliced into wedges and served. Wonderful!!!

This is the first focaccia recipe I ever made and I still make it. ( I actually have the Sept 1991 issue!) This recipe introduced me to the world of focaccia bread and since then, I'm known as the foccaccia Queen in my family!
