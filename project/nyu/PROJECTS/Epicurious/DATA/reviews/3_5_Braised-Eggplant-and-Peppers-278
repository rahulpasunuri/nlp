I thought that this recepie was wonderful, and so did my friends. Even my 15 year old son loved it. I added more tumeric (like so many others) and a bit of cayenne to cut the natural sweetness from the carmelized onions. Felt that adding sugar was a bit much. Loved it!

This was very good! Not quite good enough to convert my eggplant-hating husband, but it was definitely enjoyed. I loved it!

Nothing special for me, I expected a little more flavor. Would use more spices if I made it again.

I added more turmeric, maybe it was needed because mine was pretty old! Good as a side dish on the Atkins diet.

I was actually surprised at how good this recipe was. I thought two onions might be overkill, so I used only one, which worked fine. I served it with lamb chops and couscous and we all remarked on how good it tasted. A definite keeper!

This is a very easy and delicious recipe! I made this as an appetizer to a Chicken Curry dinner. Served it with Naan from Trader Joe's but some of us thought it worked well along with the Chicken Curry over Basmati rice. Do give this a try!

This dish was very very nice. I ended up adding more turmeric and to give it add some aroma, but otherwise it is easy to make and enoyable. It defintely works better as an appetizer on bread than anything else, some kind of indian style bruschetta.

This dish was a great addition to a Spanish meal we prepared...we served it with a potato and onion tortilla, and it was delicious. The next night, we added chicken stock, white wine and shrimp, and served it over linguine. Delicious and versatile, and stores well!

This is really, really good. I added more spices, which made it quite fiery. I thought it was very authentic-tasting.

This was absolutely amazing! This was my first attempt at Indian food,and I was not disapointed! I didn't have tumeric, so I used allspice. I also added a dash of curry, and a little extra sugar,which didn't seem to make much of a difference. I didn't have cilantro either, but it was fantastic. I am going to save some for tomorrow and make a sandwich with toasted grain bread.

We loved this dish. I used a combination of yellow squash and zucchini in chunks instead of eggplant and added 1/2 a habanero pepper minced and 1/2 tsp of garam masala. I'm having it for lunch today with leftover rice and boiled eggs.

I thought this recipe was great. Better as a side dish then a main course. I did triple the amount of turmeric called for. Made a much better flavor. I served this as a side to tandori chicken, saffron rice and Naan bread. Everyone loved it! Nice flavor without being too much. Definitely would make it again, but would keep in mind the additional seasoning needed.

I liked the summer vegetables in this, so tried to make it a main course. Exactly per recipe was a bit bland to our tastes, but the addition of some soy sauce (and chili sauce if you like it spicy) helped turn this into a good Asian main course with rice.

Make it a day ahead of eating. The flavors taste MUCH better the next or even 2 days after preparing. Easy. Great with grilled or roasted game hens.
