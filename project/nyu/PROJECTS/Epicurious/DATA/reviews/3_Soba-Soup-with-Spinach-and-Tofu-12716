i just made this my way for lunch. I would totally omit the soy sauce, mirin and sugar. Make your dashi with kombu and bonito only. after you've strained out the liquid - immediately add 2 TBSP of the miso to the hot broth and stir. set aside Use a separate large pot and make the noodles - 'refreshing' with once cup of ice cold water every 2 minutes of cooking time - bringing back to boil then 're-freshing again'. immediately strain and rinse in very cold water until they are shiny. blanch the carrots and tofu in the noodle pot that now has nothing in it. put noodles, then veggies then broth. Chop up spinach and sprinkle on top - use some grated ginger and cilantro for garnish as well - if it isn't salty enough - add your own soy sauce or Bragg's sprinkle by sprinkle- i put pumpkin seeds on mine - was so good.

This was excellent - I added some sliced shiitake mushrooms and used low sodium soy sauce and sweet white miso to lower the salt level.

I would never make this again. Was way to salty and tasteless. Made recipe exactly as called for; with disatrous results. Threw it away and went to McDonalds

I made this recipe mainly as an attempt to make my own miso soup; I needed a recipe for the broth, the dashi, as a base. I was a bit surprised by the amount of miso; I used only 2 1/2 TB of red miso. Even so, I thought that was too much. Next time, and there will be a next time, Ill use much less miso. Or, try a different miso. Or, omit the soy sauce. In addition, I made the following changes to the soup: omitted the bonito flakes; replaced the mirin with sake; and swapped the tofu for shrimp. As a Cook from Boston/NYC/LA said, this is a good get well soon broth. The flavors were complex. With the basic broth, and the addition of (soba) noodles, you can mix-n-match any combination of vegetables and proteins for a hearty meal in a bowl.

For St. Louis: This broth is dashi. I would omit the soy sauce and just serve it on the side at the table, should cure any complaints about the saltiness. I use baby spinach and don't cook it before adding to the hot soup. Shredded carrots and shelled fresh soybeans are nice additions to this dish. I've had no problems finding the ingredients at Japanese or Korean markets, and even large supermarkets, and all but the tofu keep well for a long time.

I was expecting more of a golden miso soup with this recipe, and it most certainly is not. The broth is complex in flavor because of the sweet mirin and sugar, the salt from the soy and kombu (I used atlantic dried kelp), and the smoke of the bonito. However, I agree with other reviewers that it was over-salty (and I even halved the amount of soy sauce) and over-sweet. I added rice-wine vinegar, but it did little to improve the situation when combined with flash-simmered tofu (tasteless), wilted spinach (bad texture), and soba that have only been cooked in water. I think this would be better using a chicken, dashi or vegetable broth base that the noodles have also been cooked in, otherwise they taste woody against the soup's already battling flavors.

Wow! This recipe turned out great! Very healthy, and very quick to make. My husband said it was delicious and he even ate the tofu. I'll definitely make it again, but next time I'll try to make it taste a little more tangy--maybe adding some rice wine vinegar to balance the subtle sweetness.

Excellent - the only difficult part is having the ingredients on hand. I would cut down on salt/sugar. I used half the sugar and still found it too sweet. Next time I will use 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of sugar. Definitely less soy if you plan to use the miso.

This soup was very flavorful. It will take a little practice to get used to using the kombu and the bonito flakes, but well worth becoming a staple. I didn't particularly like the dark color of the 'soup', and will cut down on the saltiness by using less soy sauce next time.

This was fabulous, and not very difficult to make - it will become a weeknight staple for us. It's tasty and filling, but doesn't leave you feeling all weighed down. Like NYC, we love Asian cooking and all of the ingredients are staples in our pantry.

A little salty for my taste, with both the miso and the soy. I would consider the miso very optional, or at least cut back on the amount. Otherwise, very tasty and worth experimenting with.

Loved it! Even better the 2nd day after the flavors had melded together. A really invigorating soup on a cold winter day.

Excellent, tasty soup. For a shortcut for the broth, you can just use instant dashi granules. I poached a chicken breast in the dashi, then shredded it and added it back to the broth just before serving. I omitted the tofu and carrots and rather than cook the spinach and have it shrink and wilt, I put some spinach in each bowl on top of the noodles and poured broth over it all. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped fresh cilantro as well as scallions, and you have a great full meal for 3 people (not 6 unless it's only a part of the meal). This soup is good when one member of a household is sick but the rest of the household still wants to _eat_ something--it satisfies all. Definitely use the miso (I like a coarse-ground yellow miso, and then I don't bother straining the soup).

Healthy and good for you soup. You now can find these ingredients in your better supermarkets or oriental markets.The mirin lasts a long time.Practice and it will become a simple way to prepare good soup.

Were are you going to find all the ingredients? After all these are things you would not normally have on hand. Too expensive and too wasteful to make.
