Was looking for something to break the potato doldrums and found a perfect choice in this dish. We enjoyed the warm, almost nutty flavor and have shared this with friends since. I do recommend using Italian flavored bread crumbs to add robustness.

This was easy enough but the taste was only so so. I have to admit I didn't have fresh herbs (I used dried) and that might have made a difference.

Very simple recipe with nice flavor and good visual presentation. Cooking the onions in the white wine is essential to the good flavor. I liked that fact that the recipe was low in fat and still very flavorful.
