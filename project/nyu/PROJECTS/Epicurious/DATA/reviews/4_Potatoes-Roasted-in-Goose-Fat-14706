Nothing out of the ordinary

Exceptional. I got this right the first time round and have been making it ever since. I have also tried it with baby potatoes hoping to save myself a bit of trouble but it didn't turn out as nice as balling out the russet potatoes.

I made this with duck fat and it was very good, although the potatoes did stick to the pan a bit. I didn't bother with the melon baller, just cut the potatoes into bite sized chunks.

I tried it with duck fat and it was spectacular. It was a hit except that it wasted quite a bit of potatoes since I scooped them into balls. I'll try slicing them the next time.

I roasted the potatoes at a higher temperature with a sprinkling of chopped rosemary and this was delicious. Don't be afraid to leave the potatoes in for a while, shaking the pan every so often so they get very crispy.

Spectacular. Made as many as my oven could hold and should have made twice as much. So easy too, did not even have to turn to have crisp, golden slices. An added incentive to roast goose or duck.

Has anyone tried this with tiny new potatoes? I'd like to do it for Christmas dinner, and think the little potatoes would have the same effect with less labor. Any reason why not?

I had trouble making the balls so I just cut the potaoes into small pieces.It was great.I cooked them longer than an hour.They went great with the apple recipe which is also on this site.

This is much like what we do with tiny new potatoes in butter. We used Yukon Gold potatoes and enjoyed it very much.
