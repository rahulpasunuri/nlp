This is my go-to recipe for a dessert that makes people want to lick their plates. It is perfect for gluten free diners, and it is kosher for Passover. It is very good as written, though as others have noted, it takes longer than 6 minutes of beating for the egg-sugar mixture to reach the right consistency, and longer than 55 minutes to bake. Eggs at room temperature is essential. Over the many times I have made this recipe, I have tweaked it a bit: 1. I use half the butter -- one stick rather than two. It is still plenty rich. 2. I reduce the sugar some too -- closer to 3/4 cup. It is still plenty sweet. 3. I increase the kahlua a bit -- closer to 1/3 cup. 4. As other suggested, I bake it in a hot water bath. The texture is much moister, and it drops less. Definitely a keeper.

Have made this cake almost weekly for years, with the following tweaks:I found that the eggs must be warm to beat properly, so I put them in a bowl of very warm water for 5 minutes first. I quit wasting money on expensive chocolate because Trader Joe's chocolate chips taste just fantastic in this cake. I melt the butter and chocolate together in the microwave for two minutes and wisk, effortless. Instant espresso powder and a little vanilla enhances the chocolate flavor. I bake at 325 F. until it no longer jiggles at all, otherwise the middle can be mousse-like and unpleasantly gooey. Finally, I skip the parchment and flipping mess, instead pressing it somewhat flat on top, and spreading with ganache made with another bag of chocolate chips and a little cream. I serve it with fresh berries in a rosewater-enhanced sugar syrup and a little whipped cream.

Wonderfully dense and full of chocolate flavor. I used Valhorna 61% semi-sweet chocolate and unsalted French butter and the cake turned out divine. It was so easy to make too, which was a definite plus.

I found this recipe several years ago and I made it since. It is great! I use a cappuccino liqueur and I top it with gated milk and white chocolates'. What a wonderful dessert! I also found another great dessert where you can find here, http://www.gourmetrecipe.com/recipes/mousseline-de-genepi-with-chocolate-fondue! A wonderful dessert!

I have been making this cake for years to rave reviews. Tonight, however, I'm excited to say that I had the opportunity to visit the cafe and finally try the original. I felt like I was meeting my favorite celebrity or something. I was excited that their cake also cracked a bit as mine tends to be very crumbly. Theirs was denser and smoother, however, while mine tends to be more brownie-like. I think I will try beating the eggs less next time. I will also try using a better quality chocolate and a bit more liqueur. They also coated the cake with a sort of ganache-like layer, guessing half for flavor and half to keep the cake from crumbling. They serve it with a blackberry sauce that was a wonderful complement to the dish. Funny, since I always serve it with a raspberry sauce! Otherwise, no changes in recipe or procedure. It's a very popular standard of mine.

This is one of my all time favorite desserts. One evening with friends and a few bottles of wine somebody asked what would happen if you added bacon? Well...it's DELICIOUS! Instead of Kahula, I used Godiva Chocolate Liquer and then added 1/2 pound of cooked & crumbled applewood smoked bacon. The only problem? Needs more bacon! I'm putting a pound in next time!

Rating: 4
Made this for my wife on Valentines Day. Truly amazing. The Godiva liquor is a must. It is one of the top three of my many chocolate desserts. It does need an additional 10 to 20 mins cooking time, depending on your oven. I used half 54% cocoa and half 72% cocoa. Sooooo Good.

Rating: 4
Wow. I don't understand how anyone could look at the ingredients, decide to make it, and then give it anything less than three stars. Four from me because it's so delicious, but I could see that the incorrect cooking time could be problematic for some-- I had to cook it at least 20 more minutes, and maybe I should have cooked it longer.

This was good and very rich. Just not my favorite dessert. I wouldn't make it again. If you love chocolate truffles you should make this dessert because that is what it reminded me of.

Amazing with Godiva chocolate liquor. Made the cake 2 days before serving Stored it in the pan in the fridge. Served with homemade whipped cream I made with the Godiva liquor. Perfect!!

I made this for Passover (and the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Caramel Sauce). I followed the suggestion of 1/2 bittersweet and 1/2 semisweet chocolate. The flavor was intense and the cake dense, and moist. Aside from the poor presentation of the other Flourless Cake, my family has requested that I continue to make both. I am wheat intolerant and a chocolate lover, so these will become standard recipes for me.

I found this to be a waste of good ingredients. There are many recipes that bring the flavor and dense chocolate cake that we expect. Dry (not overcooked) and tasteless. Find another recipe-I thru mine out!

Beginning celiac I was thrilled beyond belief to find a real cake recipe with no compromises! Made it to the letter except I had to bake for 10 mins longer and it worked beautifully. Thank you to cook who confirmed that cake is flipped over onto cake plate so don't fret about cracked and crunchy (yummy)top.Liquer flavour developed over a day or two so I will be making it at least 2 days in advance next time.

A previous reviewer was thinking about substituting shortening for butter. I made the cake with shortening for a wheat- and dairy-challenged friend and it worked very well. A huge hit!

Rating: 3
I made this 2x; second time around I upped the eggs to 8, added 1/2 butter and used 2 pts dark chocolate to 1 pt bittersweet. I also used 1 tablespoon of nescafe instant coffee mixed in the with the kaluha/choc. mixture. I baked it, with the springform pan in a roasting pan filled with 1.5 inches of boiling water, at 325 for 25 min. Second time around far superior. Not sure if it was the butter or the baking method or both.

Rating: 4
I didn't have coffee liqueur in the house, so I used amaretto, and increased it from 2 oz. to 3 oz. It was delightful. This is my new fave flourless cake, as the texture is much lighter than most. It was an easy recipe to whip up, and has room for leeway with flavoring. I'm also thinking about trying to substitute shortening for the butter for a dairy- intolerant friend. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 3
Kahlua taste was non-existent but I guess it was overwhelmed by the chocolate. To achieve the "thick" consistency for the eggs I whisked them at high speed. Was a little too sweet for me, overall, so might be wise to cut back on the sugar. But the crispy top was delightful. Thank you for contributing this recipe!

Rating: 2
Honestly, it wasn't the mouth-gasm I was expecting after reading the reviews. I did have to mix the eggs closer to 20 minutes than 6 as it says it should take (maybe because eggs weren't room temp, but cool not cold?) Used a store branch semi-sweet chocolate so maybe that made it just so-so. Couldn't really taste the liqueur at all. Will be making a second since we have a progressive dinner coming up, will try different liqueur in place...

Rating: 4
This is my go-to easy desert.I've topped it with a raspberry puree, chocolate/vanilla/coffee ice cream all with great results. This cake is a total winner. I agree with the other reviewer that the Kahlua flavor is not strong. In some batches I've doubled or trippled the amount of Kahlua with great results, though the recipe is fine as it is. Perhaps a cup of coffee with kahlua would pair nicely? One suggestion: use proper folding technique when combining the chocolate and the eggs. It seems like my cake was a bit lighter and smoother after I learned how to fold eggs.

Rating: 3
First of all my oven broke 10 minutes into cooking this. So I transported it to a friends house and continued baking it. None of this seemed to matter. One of my guests asked "why do you put flour in cakes, if it tastes this good without it?". My only comments -1) you could not taste any of the Kaluha, 2) I used a Kaluha whipped cream as a topping, and I think something with more flavor would be better.

Rating: 4
Terrific cake. The top burned prior to it cooking fully. I will adjust the temperature down to 325 and increase the cooking time. Otherwise, I received rave reviews. Served with Starbucks Java ice cream. A swoon-worth dessert and remarkably simple.

Uusally when I see rave reviews of chocolate cakes I am disappointed because my expectations are too high. This was excellent. A wonderful texture easy to make and large enough for a crowd. The next time I will check it about 5 min earlier as the top started to burn. Excellent cake

I have made this recipe twice with great results! I also made the substitution of Frangelico (hazelnut liqueur) instead of Kahlua both times and used semi-sweet chocolate chips for ease. This is a great cake to take to a dinner party. No leftovers to worry about.

A very good & easy chocolately cake; however, it basically tasted like a fudgy brownie. Needs to be plated with a a few accompaniments to give it more interest. A raspberry sauce was perfect, and a scoop of ice cream would be wonderful as well.

Rating: 4
I have made & reviewed this recipe before. This time I actually used Kahula and it was amazing! I also discovered that it came out a little fluffier if you folded the chocolate into the eggs instead of the other way per the instructions. I figured as long as I had the Kitchen Aid going, it would be easier. It turned out awesome! I decorated with powdered sugar, edible gold dust & chocolate leaves...just lovely!

So, so, so good! I beat my eggs for ages and they never reached the described consistency. Still, the cake was to die for. Incredibly rich and dense. It would be equally good with other liquors. I can't wait to try it with Grand Marnier.

Excellent & simple - all my friends think this is my new "signature" dish! I followed the recipe with the exception of using Cointreau in lieu of coffee liquor.

I, too, was out of Kahlua and substituted Grand Mariner. I loved the subtle orange flavor! Also, after "flipping" my cake, it had a wonderful crispy layer with an ooey gooey middle! Yum! It was incredibly simple to make...I would make this again!

Rating: 3
First, let me say I hate when people review a recipe and report that they made in essence a completely different recipe by using other ingredients. I planned to make this cake and when I got home, had no more Kahlua. So I subsitituted Grand Marnier. The cake is really easy to make, Takes about 10 minutes to get in the oven and is seriously delicious. I served it with whipped cream on top but I think it would be awesome with some raspberries. I will definately make it again. I do recommend making it a day before because I think the flavor and denseness was better the 2nd day. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
I made this for a potluck. I served it with raspberry puree that I made during the summer from fresh raspberries. Delicious! I found that it really doesn't matter that the cake cracks on top because when I removed the cake from the spring form pan, I had to turn it over onto the cake plate in order to remove the parchment paper. The cracked part is turned on the bottom, so you can't see it anyway. I did sprinkle it with powdered sugar, which made it more attractive. I am making another one for Christmas dinner.

This is a wonderful gluten-free cake that I brought to a Thanksgiving dinner. It's very easy to make--only needs one bowl and one saucepan. I made the batter a couple days ahead, put it in the spring-form pan and chilled it in the refrigerator. The batter was quite stiff and I easily transported it unbaked to New Jersey in a cooler. I baked it the day before Thanksgiving. It was a big hit.

This cake made awful cracks in the top after baking which made it look unattractive; the powdered sugar did help disguise it a bit. The Kahlua taste was not strong enough so I'll add more. Baked for exactly the given time. The center was fudgy and moist - someone said it was mousse-like. Plated it with homemade berrie coulis so the tartness could balance it. Served with whipped cream too. RICH! I'd love to make it into smaller scale, like brownie squares... I used half semi sweet, half bittersweet Ghiradelli.

Rating: 4
I always use this recipe for chocolate cake and receive stunning reviews. That said, it's only as good as the chocolate you use (I love it with Lindt bittersweet). Everyone gasps when they hear what's in this cake (a pound of chocolate?!!)but they all beg me to make it again and again. I have been experimenting with separating the eggs and whipping the egg whites stiff...I think it makes a lighter cake. Anyone have any thoughts about that?

I made it for a Cinco de Mayo potluck and topped it with whipped cream and cinnamon to make it more....Mexican?? Anyway, it was well-received. I waited till people were 1/2 through with their pieces before I told them how many eggs and how much butter was in it. Definitely a keeper.

I make this often. Very dense and chocolately. It is rich and fudgy rather than dry and brownie-like. I melt mini-chocolate chips because I dislike chopping chocolate. Works fine. Be sure to press down sides as directed because the top cracks, detracting from presentation.

Sorry, I can't agree with the rave reviews. The flourless chocolate cake with chocolate glaze is a little more work but a much better dessert. I found this too heavy and cloying. On the positive side, it was very easy.

This was a HUGE hit! Made this two days ahead for a dinner party - held up perfectly! I served it with vanilla ice cream, next time I would stick to berries to cut the very rich flavor. I used Kahlua and it was the perfect flavor for this cake. I also thought is was pretty easy to make! I have a feeling I will be asked to make this again soon!

Since I'm not typically a baker, I followed the recipe almost to the letter (substituted Franglico). When the cake came out of the oven, it looked like a big risen brownie and I thought, "Oh No." But I made it the night before, and before serving, inverted it onto a plate and poured a thin ganache over and dusted it with hazlenut flour. My guests said it was like eating a great big truffle.

This cake was amazing! I served it with fresh ripe strawberries and it was a hit. One thing I did learn (I'm a very new cook) is that you can't skimp on pansize here. I used a springform pan that was one inch smaller than was asked for and I ended up with a very tall cake that sunk a tad in the middle. (The strawberries served double duty as camoflage for the sink-hole...)

This cake is very rich in ingredients but tasted a lot lighter than I expected. Without the flour it doesn't have the heaviness to it.

Its a great complement to a great dinner. I will def. serve this again in the future.

A very moist and tender cake with an intense chocolate flavor. (I used Callebaut bittersweet). I made this for a friend who is allergic to flour, but this was so tasty, I'd reuse the recipe for any occasion. I was out of coffee liqueur -- used Frangelico. Would like to try this again with Kahlúa. I think the key to this recipe is to beat the eggs and sugar very well.

This was delicious and super rich! It really melts in your mouth and a little goes a long way. I had a lot left over (not a problem!!) after everyone had a piece. I followed the recipe exactly aside from adding some extra Kahlua which you couldn't taste too much. The cake wasn't gooey or undercooked at all. I did make it the day before and chilled it. Excellent and I would definitely make it again. It was fairly easy to do!

I wanted a flourless chocolate recipe to make for a friend with celiac disease, and tested it out at a dinner party first. Rave reviews! I served it with some expresso gelato, which was delicious!

Very, very good! Found the cooking time to be off..need about 15 more minutes. Did not have a crumbleing problem, but I would HIGHLY recommend inverting the cake on a platter for serving..the top was not attractive. Served with coffee ice cream and whipped cream.

Rating: 3
This cake was a big hit--light, but very chocolately. Not one of those dense chocolate cakes. The trick is to make sure that the eggs are very well beaten -- to almost a mousse consistency -- before adding to the chocolate. The volume is key. One problem -- it crumbled a bit when released from Springform pan and cut. Not the neatest cake to cut, but everyone enjoyed it thoroughly with whipped cream and expresso gelato.

Rating: 3
Yummy AND easy to make! Substituted the semi-sweet chocolate with bittersweet (Lindt) chocolate and instead of a coffee liqueur, substituted it with instant espresso diluted in 1/4c water. The cake turned out very nice and not too sweet. The recipe should specify that the cake be served upside down for a cleaner presentation. I will definitely make this one again!

I made this cake for a dinner party for 30 that I was catering. It was a special request from my client who happens to be allergic to flour. My oven is a commercial convection unit and I found that I needed to increase the bake time an additional 10 minutes. I topped each slice with a dollop of coffee liqueuer whipped cream and garnished with a chocolate espresso bean and a sprinkling of powdered sugar. Simple but elegant. It was received very well. Next time I'll try with the red chile powder and garnish with red pepper flakes and whipped cream.

HELP-After reading the remarks, I was certain this would be great! I do not have many disasters, but this was one. There was a puddle of melted butter in the cookie sheet under the pan. I do not know what was wrong but if others had a success with it, it was not the recipe. At first I thought it might have needed only 1 stick of butter. I am a good baker but this was my first flourless cake. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Is it possible I overbaked it and it seized? I only had either an 8-1/2" or 9-1/2" pan and opted for the larger, decreased the time but maybe not enough.
