Excellent. I used two plumb tomatoes, an onion instead of shallot, and a basil leaf. Two cans of chopped clams. (One drained) Perfect consistency. Am tempted to do it with a splash of fresh scalops and shrimp. Paired it with sliced tomato.mozzarella, basil, topped with olive oil.

This recipe might be ok if you have really low expectations. The other recipe I use is so divine that this one seemed like boxed mac and cheese. I will not make it again.

Also great with a diced plum tomato added along with the parsley.

Suprisingly good. I had never used canned clams before. The trader joe brand is not too pretty to look at, but the sauce tasted great. No clam juice. Very easy.

I quite the novice when it comes to clams but we went clamming and I was excited to try this recipe. It was really yummy and quite fool proof- I did not have enough clam juice so I used some chicken stock and it was still delicious. I would highly reccoment this recipe

Wow! I was really surprised at how delicious this was given how inexpensive the indredients were and how easy it was to make. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added a dash of worcestershire sauce, some chili flakes and cream. I used 2 6.5 oz cans of chopped clams from trader joe's (there was no need to add excess clam juice other than what was in the cans) and also added fresh lemon zest. I can definitely see how this could be an extremely economical yet fabulous dish to serve a large group. I will be making this again!!

This was a simple, delicious, dish that is perfect for after work etc. Definitely go with half Olive Oil / half butter, and the clam juice is key to giving a good clammy sauce that's not too thick, especially once it's reduced a bit with the wine. This one is a winner!

Made this for 140 at a luncheon. Went over very big with the crowd. Made 2 gallons of sauce using 1 bottle of chardoney. Used chopped sea clams because whole were not available in the quantitiy I needed. Also added about 2 tsps of red pepper flakes to the sauce.

Ten or so years ago my girlfriends and I would get together and watch 'Friends' every Thursday night & my best friend served something very similar to this on her night to cook. I like this recipe better! This is so full of flavor, the cream isn't needed. I had the perfect consistency, I didn't add all the clam sauce and to thicken up the sauce just add more wine! It's perfect, I'm so happy I found this recipe - my husband loved it. This is my new drop-in 'company' recipe to have on hand, as it can mostly be pantry items!

Delicious. Used fresh oregano as others suggested and added fresh steamed clams. Whole family enjoyed.

I love this recipe. Make it often. Even my picky husband loves it. I usually omit the extra clam juice since we don't like our sauces too runny, and keep everything else as written. I reserve a bit of the clam juice from the cans and mix it with flour before adding to the pan, which prevents lumps. One major thing - whatever you do, use a real white wine, not the cooking wine from the Supermarket. Makes a HUGE difference!

I just wasn't a fan of this recipe. My problem with it was the consistency. It was too thick a sauce for me. I am a traditionalist when it comes to white clam sauce - I like it to be more of a oil based rather than creamy sauce that this was. Taste was fine, just not the right recipe for us.

Very nice and easy to make. The addition of the flour and the butter make the sauce smooth and tasty and it clings to the pasta nicely. The chopped shallots add a hearty texture. This will go in our recipe box and will be a trusty addition.

Fantastic, fast and easy!! I followed the suggestions of a few dashes of worchestire sauce and also added a tablespoon of tomato paste. Served it with parsley butter garlic bread that looks so pretty and is so yummy. C'est magnifique!

This is a wonderful basic clam sauce. Definately use 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 butter, and I used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for some zing and a squeeze of lemon juice at the end to finish. Loved the addition of thyme along with parsley. A keeper!

Very good! My girlfriend enjoyed it too. I followed other peoples suggestions, with the olive oil, hot pepper, Worcestershire, etc. I suggest trying without the Worcestershire first -- I'm concerned it interfered with the clam taste. To make it a bit more substantial, I added fresh olives and cut-up artichokes to good effect.

Great! Super easy and fast. Half olive oil, half butter is also the way to go. It's become a regular in our kitchen.

This is a great recipe and I regularly make this for a quick and easy dinner. I use 1/2 the butter and substitute 1 tbsp of olive oil. I also cut the flour in 1/2 -- otherwise it gets pretty thick. Highly recommend!

I have made this recipe twice, and it was just about as good as using fresh clams which we used when living in the U.S. Now living in a small village in Mexico, I could not find bottled clam juice so used a shrimp flavored boullion in a cup of water, and it turned out great. I do suggest cutting down the flour by about 1/3, as we like it a bit more brothy. Be sure the linguine is al dente. A keeper in My Recipe Box.

I really enjoyed this dish to my surprise. We don't have fresh clams in Louisiana, so I've never bothered with them thinking canned seafood inferior to fresh. However, my boyfriend asked me to find a recipe for this, since he doesn't like a red sauce or anything with cream. This one was the keeper -- thank goodness for all of the reviews. I did reduce the clam juice by half, and I added Worcestershire, hot sauce and fresh lemon juice. The only thing I would do next time would be to just serve lemon wedges on the side for individuals to add at will. I loved the flavor, but my guest preferred no lemon juice. What I love best about this is that you can have everything in the pantry all of the time and make this so quickly and easily.

Very nice dish. Wow them on a week night. All that butter was too rich on my stomach-bit overwhelming. Next time I'll follow sugestion of 1/2 oil. Very very nice and easy.

This is a very simple, delicious recipe. I used two 6oz. cans of chopped clams instead of one 10oz. can of whole clams and the sauce came out really well. I will definitely make this again.

This was a deceptively simple recipe which gave excellent results. Adding the flour gave the sauce a slight thickness which was great. I didn't add as much liquid as the recipe states, but I followed other cooks' advice and added Worcestshire sauce and oregano. I also added quite a bit of lemon juice to make it taste like my favourite restaurant's offering! I will definitely make this again.

I was a little hesitant after reading about the pasty glob of flour but I decided to make it anyway with the following changes: Instead of sauteeing the onion/garlic mixture in butter, I used olive oil and a touch of butter for taste. I also sliced some mushrooms and spicy italian anchovy filets (about 3) added them to the saute. When time came to put the flour I added only a third of what is listed in the reciped. This allowed the sauce to slightly thicken but still stay runny for the crusty bread soppers. If ti's not thick enough, just finish with some butter and you'll be fine. Two more things: When serving this, make sure you have on hand lemons for squeezing, hot chile flake and parmesan cheese. Absolutely delicious to add these items to the bowl of pasta at the table.

This is a really nice recipe. The sauce, to paraphrase another reviewer, is "luscious." Definitely follow advice and add oregano. I added green Tabasco instead of Worchestire sauce -- gave it terrific zing. Haven't tried the anchovies yet, but I will next time. It's easy. It's good. It's a keeper.

When I added the flour & looked at the glob of paste in my pan, I thought "what is wrong with this picture?" I have never in my life added flour to a pasta sauce. Part of the joy of eating linguini with clam sauce is soaking up the sauce with good crusty bread. My Italian taste buds said "bad!!" :(

I have made linguine with clam sauce many many times over the years, usually with more than acceptable results---after all, it isn't all that difficult to produce a good result. But this recipe---and I must give due credit to the suggestions for adding Worcestershire sauce, oregano, and white pepper---is a cut above the others. There is a lushness to the sauce that will insure that it becomes a regular at our table.

Really quick, easy, satisfying family meal. I cut the amount of bottled clam juice in half to make the dish less runny and it worked out wonderfully. My Italian husband actually said it was better than his mother's!!

Add: 3/4 tsp. oregano Add 1/2 T. Worchestershire saucce Add 1/8 tsp. white pepper Add 1/4 tsp. garlic salt Substitute olive oil for heart healthy Recipe works just as well without wine The adjustments make this recipe a definite 3.5 rating! For ease of measurement, two 6oz. cans of clams work well.
