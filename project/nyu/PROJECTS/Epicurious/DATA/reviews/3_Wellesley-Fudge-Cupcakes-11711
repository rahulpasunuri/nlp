I read every review and followed every tip. I have used this recipe about 15 times... the bottomline: they are delicious but I couldn't stop them from sinking in the middle - every time. I found another one, and they come out beautiful!

I was having a few friends over and was delighted to find this recipe that made only 6 cupcakes, but can understand doubling or tripling this recipe because the cupcakes were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for 3 things: 1) I used a spoon instead of a whisk; 2) used cake flour instead of all purpose (remember to add an additional 1 TBL to the 1/2 cup) and 3) by using the cake flour, I skipped the sifting and simply whisked in the salt and backing powder into the flour in a bowl. I made a point to watch the cupcakes carefully on baking time. They came out perfectly after 15 minutes and did not sink in the middle. The cake was moist and tender, the icing very fudgy. This is a keeper.

I love these cupcakes. They come together easily, and come out great. I did notice that they sink in the middle, but once you put on frosting it doesn't really matter. They are very rich, and slightly crumbly even though they are moist, and I usually triple the recipe. This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe.

I was a little afraid to make the cupcakes after all of the review stories, so I just made the frosting. Instead of the vanilla, I added 1/4 teaspoon mint extract, and ended up with a lovely, rich, choclately-minty thick frosting for my cupcakes. And it's super fast and easy to make, too!

I always made the fudge cake as my standard birthday cake or July 4th cake. It was a classic. Unfortunately the cupcakes are not as good. The cupcakes did sink in the centers as other remarked. The cake itself was crumbly and feel apart, though it was not overcooked. The cupcakes from the Magnolia Bakery are a much better recipe.

HORRIFIC. Like an earlier reviewer, my cupcakes sunk in the middle and burnt on the edges. The only change I made was to double the recipe, but the point of baking is that you can do that. Waste of time.

This is a fantastic cupcake recipe! I would make it again and again. However, I did experience slight problems when doubling the recipe.

Originanally rated these a 3 two years ago. I've changed my mind. They are the definitive chocolate cupcake for me now.

I would bet money that the people who hated this recipe overbaked the cupcakes. You've gotta watch cakes and cupcakes like a hawk and pull them the second they're done, not when the recipe says they're done!

I got FOUR cupcakes out of this recipe. Crumbly, not too chocolatey, (despite doubling the amount of chocolate) and overall ok. Icing was more of a glaze and it ran all over the plate.

Easy yes, but nothing spectacular. I followed the recipe precisely but didn't have great results. The cakes sunk in the middle and seemed rather heavy in texture. I did liked the flavor of the frosting, however.

I loved them but my family did not. They were expecting something with more chocolate flavour. In my opinion, they were very easy to make and delicious.

Very good, and easy too. I managed to make these with one hand as my young daughter insisted on being carried the whole time (I put her down for the oven part, obviously) Will make again.

These have a fabulous texture, and are nice and chocolately without being too sweet. Easy to make (although directions are not well written, so you may think otherwise...), great to double, and even turn out fine when egg white is used instead of the yolk- and then they're good for you, right?

I don't know what people are so unenthusiastic about. I thought these were perfectly fine cupcakes, moist and chocolaty. My only criticism is the yield. Who ever makes only six cupcakes? I quadrupled the recipe and made 27 cupcakes.

This recipe is awful! I threw away the entire batch. I have tried this recipe twice and each time the cupcakes sunk in the center, burned on the edges, and tasted mediocre at best. My recommendation is to not waste your time with this recipe.

Very ordinary cupcake - there was nothing brownie like about it and it wasn't that rich chocolatee flavor that I was looking for. It did have a nice cake like texture which was good. Overall, it's not bad and people who are used to cake mixes will find it quite wholesome and much better than any mix, but it not good enough to satisfy a chocoholic.

To the cook from San Diego whose cupcakes didn't rise. You substituted buttermilk for milk. You can't do that and expect the same outcome. Baking is very precise. There is a difference between the two and not only in fat levels.

Melt in your mouth delicious!This is the best cupcake recipe I've ever made. I'm emailing it to my little brother right after I finish this review. I substituted 3T cocoa and 1T veg oil for each ounce of chocolate just because I didn't have any cocoa.

When I made these I accidentally left out the egg yolk. I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best while they were baking...came out great. Next time I'll use the yolk to check the difference. If you're out of eggs or are allergic, give it a try! Save yourself some hassle and combine the chocolate, (don't bother chopping) butter, and water in a measuring cup and microwave to melt the chocolate about halfway, then stir to complete the melting!

Wonderful. The only complaint I have is that they didn't rise -- actually, they almost sank. I'll assume I did something wrong there and will certainly try again. Looks aside, the taste is wonderfully chocolatey and moist, moist, moist. Only change I made was replacing the milk with buttermilk as I love what buttermilk does to a recipe.

easy, and very brownie-like

This recipe was so simple that my 5 year old helped me make it. I melted the chocolate in the microwave for her and leveled off the ingredients but she did the rest. They were delicious and she was so proud of herself.

This website is fantastic! I made these cupcakes frequently in high school and college, from my mom's issue of Gourmet. I have since misplaced it so I am thrilled to find it here. I never had a crumbly cupcake from this recipe and the icing is so chocolatey and good. Try the recipe before passing over due to some of the reviews. It's very easy to make and people always like them. I had better make a batch today to test my memory ...

Not bad. The flavor was good, although I used an extra ounce of chocolate in mine. They were moist, but still very crumbly. I would not liken them to a brownie -I think of a brownie as dense and chewy. These definitely have a cake texture.

Do not know what I did wrong. These did not turn out well for me. They were very crumbly textured. Tasted good, and very quick and easy though. Maybe I baked them a little too long!?

To the person who complained about the mess try this! I melted the chocolate in the microwave. Then I put all the ingredients in the cuisinart and whirled it for a sec. Very quick and easy!

These cupcakes were delicious! I only baked mine for 17, so I would set the timer for 15 and check after that. The texture was wonderful and the frosting added a lot of richness. The frosting is a little hard to spread as it hardens quickly.

Good chocolate flavor without being overly sweet. Feathery, cake like texture. Recipe doubles easily. I used peanut butter frosting (1/3 c crunchy peanut butter, 1 c confectioners sugar - sifted, and milk to attain spreading consistency) that complemented the cupcakes nicely.

My friends really enjoyed these cupcakes. The consistency is similar to brownies. The frosting is simple and very tasty. I served the cupcakes in a bowl with coffee ice cream which complimented the cupcakes very well. There was more clean up than I expected for a simple recipe. If you add the clean up time, it will probably take about an hour or a little more. It's a good recipe, not fabulous, but I'd make it again.
