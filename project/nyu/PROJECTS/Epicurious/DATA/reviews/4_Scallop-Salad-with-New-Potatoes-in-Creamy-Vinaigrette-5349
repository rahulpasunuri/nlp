This was a huge hit at my house. Great dressing.I used escarole instead of mixed greens, which, in my opinion, was better able to stand up to the heavy scallop-potato salad. Also used Yukon-type potatoes, which worked out fine. I'll definitely be making this again.

Made this yesterday and Hubby loved it. I thought it was ok, something was missing in the dressing. Did not saute the potatoes as I did not see the need, I mixed the potatoes and greens with the salad. I'll def make this again, but may play with the dressing a little, perhaps making it early in the day allows the flavors to come together more.

Did not saute the potatoes, and tossed everything together. Very popular for a ladies' buffet.

This was easy to make and tasted terrific. I had to make a few changes since I used what was on hand after buying scallops without planning a meal in advance. I used lemon in the dressing instead of the vinegar, which gives it a fresher taste, fried up some sliced garlic that I sprinkled on top, and used parsley instead of chives since that's what I had. I had white potatoes lying around, I doubt that it made a difference. I threw in some thinly sliced red pepper just to make add some color. Oh, I dusted the scallops with flour to make them brown a bit. Wonderful, easy to modify.

Good...But not mind blowing. I got rid of the mayo and used Yogurt which was great. I would have added balsamic vinegar in the pan when making the scallops. I also used lemon on the scallops when finishing off the dish. I also used rosemary and garlic on the potatoes for more flavor(which was key). the dressing was good, but needed more?...maybe a little spice?...or more vinegar?.My fiance really liked it, but she didn't LOVE it...Mixing Hot potatoes and scallops with a cold salad, made everything luke warm. maybe try seperating the scallops and potatoes (drenched in the sauce) and have the salad on the side (with a different dressing)...My fiance is painfully honest. Next time she gets a hamburger.

Extraordinary, can also be made with sauteed perch or whitefish. Way too heavy a dressing, but try doing it with 3 TB olive oil, 2 TB white wine vinegar, 2 TB mayonaise, the mustards (make the English from Coleman's powder and water) and then thinning with a bit of milk. A new family favorite!

This dish was truly outstanding. I took others suggestions and added some garlic and scallions to the potatoes and then added some fresh lemon to the scallops. It was easy, plated beautifully, and tasted fantastic. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I also used lite mayo to lower some of the calories and the dressing was still outstanding. If you're reading this review - make this recipe - you won't be disappointed.

Wonderful dish! I definitely would make it again. My guests loved it. Scallops are a bit pricey but worth it for special occasion. I skipped the mixed greens and used just arugula for its peppery flavor. I found Coleman's English mustard in cream form but I think the powdered could be used for those who can not find it in a bottle. It adds the special zip to the dressing.

Very easy. Very delicious. I didn't have the hot English mustard (only Dijon and regular)so I substituted with regular mustard and added a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper.

Yummy!!! Would have given it 4 forks if the dressing was not so fattening.

The dressing is excellent. It is a keeper for me on it's own. I don't think I used the right potatoes because they were very large when sliced into only 4 pieces each. The dish seemed very potato heavy. The dressing was excellent on both the scallops and potatoes. I try smaller potatoes next time.

This was quick, easy, delicious, and perfect for a light summer dinner. I too followed the excellent suggestion from the cook from Palm Desert to add garlic and lemon.

Fabulous! Followed the suggestion to add garlic to potatoes and lemon to the finished scallops, and it was really spectacular. Great summer evening meal!

Delicious! The only thing I added was roasted garlic to the potatoes and lemon to the scallops (at the end). My husband and I loved it! Easy to make and would be perfect for dinner guests!

Guess what! Fish and potatoes just took on a new meaning. (OK, so scallops aren't strictly a fish, but gimme-a-break!) We loved this recipe, and we are waiting for a chance to spring it on some company. Can't recommend it more highly!
