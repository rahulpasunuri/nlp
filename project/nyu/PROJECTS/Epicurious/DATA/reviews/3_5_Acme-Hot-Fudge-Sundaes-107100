I only made the malt ice cream recipe (my favorite hot fudge recipe is from Feb 2004). I reduced the cream to 2 cups and bumped up the egg yolks to 6 based on a Cooks Illustrated recipe for vanilla ice cream. It is phenomenal, and the malt really shines through without being overpowering! Toward the end of churning, I added a cup of crushed golden Oreos to make a kind of blond cookies and cream. For my first attempt at making ice cream, I am super pleased with the results!

Had a little trouble making the "ice cream" portion, but thats mainly my mixer. Its delectable and very rich. My girlfriend required seconds.
