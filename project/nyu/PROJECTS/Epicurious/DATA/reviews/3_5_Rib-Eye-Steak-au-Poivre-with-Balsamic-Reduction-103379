This is great as is. Fabulous. You don't need super expensive balsamic, you just need to make sure it's reduced enough. If you reduce it enough almost all of the vinegar will be gone and it will be sweet and slightly syrupy. So easy and really delicious.

Excellent. I paired this with Lobster St.-Jacques which is very rich and the diner was a real hit. My only problem is that I used all the Balsamic I purchased when in Rome so I guess I will have to go back to Rome.

In the words of my kids; OMG. This was so absolutely delish. I did take another reviewer's advice and added a tablespoon or so of whipping cream which smoothed out the very acidic reduction. I think it would have been just as good without it though! I used fillet mignon. Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was a smash hit at a recent dinner I hosted. As everyone indicated on the reviews before, cream goes a long way for this recipe and I wasn't disappointed. Being that we keep kosher, I added some non-dairy whip cream un-whipped and it had just the right affect. None of the guests left anything on their plates!!!!! Great flavor and went perfectly well with some rosemary roasted potatoes! Loved it and will definitely use it again. I suggest longer cook times for some meat that is a bit more on the thick side, perhaps a minute more per side.

I love this recipe. I'm vegan, so when my boyfriend and I want a "steak", I make my own seitan cutlets to use in place of the rib-eye steak, and then I use this recipe (substituting soy butter for regular butter). I've served it to vegans and non-vegans, and everyone loves it. Great flavor and simple - A+ recipe!

I used Costco balsamic vinegar and it was fantastic. So ignore the comments about high quality balsamic...just don't overboil or scorch. Poured over extra thick pork sirloin chops and it was amazing.

This is a favorite steak recipe. Don't over cook the sauce, it will turn to sugar in a second, otherwise this is one to remember and save! paula

Very tasty, but I agree with a lot of the other posters in that a little bit of cream to the sauce would have helped cut through the bite of the vinegar, which turned out a bit over powering (and yes I used good quality). A good recipe

Made the sauce with an Amador, CA Zinfandel and got rave comments. Have some baguette to soak it up! Paired with some simple roasted asparagus and parnsnips for an easy weeknight dinner. OF course drank the rest of the bottle of Zinfandel too.

This was delicious! I added one tbsp mascarpone cheese, and one tbsp heavy cream to the sauce at the end. Perfect and easy.

My family enjoyed this dish which I served with roasted garlic and rosemary potatoes, topped with grilled onions and mushrooms. Will definately make this again.

this was delicious and amazingly easy. we served it over (plain) polenta because we didn't have much in the house--but it was a perfect pair. we halved the recipe for the two of us, but we wished we had more! next time, i will not halve it.

The best quality rib-eye and balsamic vinegar are essential to this dish. We were only two, but I used the same amt.of sauce for only 2 steaks. Great for dipping bread or over mashed potatoes.

Don't use cheap balsamic vinegar or it'll come out tasting like there's too much vinegar. (I used 12 year old vinegar.) It's wonderful and I will make this again and again.

Did this with buffalo steaks and it's gooooood! Small changes...I added a bit of stock to the pan with the vinegar, and added maybe 1/2 teaspoon of cream at the end. Very easy, very tasty.

I had never made steak before, so I followed the others' instructions and added a minced garlic clove and shallot to the pan after I took the steaks out. Sauteed that for a few mins before deglazing with the vinegar, reduced, removed from heat and stirred in some cream. It was REALLY good. The steaks came out perfectly, and the sauce was a great, tangy compliment.

Too much vinegar overpowered the steak. Not as good as I expected.

Liked the recipe as a starter. I added shallots and garlic and took the suggestion to add a little heavy cream after reducing the balsamic and the sauce turned out fabulously. With those changes the sauce was sweet and a great compliment to the pepperiness of the steak. Served this with creamed spinach, yum! Quick, easy, and flavorful - will definitely make again.

This was pretty good but the sauce was a bit overpowering. I cut it with cream as was recommended but if I make it again I will add even more and try the additions of some shallots and garlic.

Great recipe... I substitued filet mignon, and it was tender and delicious. I get rave reviews everytime I make it. Very flavorful.

Special on rib eyes tonight at the grocer. So I gave this one a try. This was very good, very simple and very fast. I did not grind the peppercorns. I used the prepared Montreal Steak Seasoning. After a removed the steaks, I added a clove a finely chopped garlic, and then added the balsamic. I also used 1/2 of all the oil/butter the recipe called for. This is very good and would easily please company.

I thought the recipe was very good but not exceptional. I made it with grilled filet mignon instead of the rib-eye.

Bought some lovely rib-eye from the Edwardian butcher's up the road, and wanted to make something special. . .managed to turn great meat into mediocre meal. The peppercorns were just too much for me and my boyfriend, and the balsamic vinegar sauce was ok, nothing great. Would have been better just to cook the steak and serve it with some dijon mustard on the side!

After adding a few personal touches, I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Like another reviewer, I added diced shallots and roasted garlic to the balsamic reduction. Instead of ribeyes, I used T-Bones, which worked just fine. Yummy!

I might have even given it a 3 1/2 if that was an option. Not quite the perfect dish, but an awfully yummy one. Made it with the crisp rosemary potatoes as suggested, a perfect touch!

For a 'Thank You' gift, I received about 5 packages of unbelievably tender and flavorful rib-eye steaks from my aunt who raises free-range, grass-fed cattle in Eastern Washington. We've been eating steak for weeks(!) and I thought this recipe was a great alternative to our normal grilling. I added minced garlic and shallot and also a splash of heavy cream at the end. Yum!

Delicious, quick and easy! My husband loved it ( I have been told I can make it again). I added some minced garlic and mushrooms. I also added some heavy cream to the sauce at the very end. The crisp rosemary potatos were a great compliment.

I've made this recipe half a dozen times, with various cuts of meat. Fast, easy, tasty, but *very* dependent on the quality of the meat. One thing I found important is to be careful with amount of peppercorns -- I love it with a strong bite -- not everyone feels the same way.

This recipe made me a Chef in everyone's eyes and I didn't have to do anything. Tonight it's going to the front of my loose leaf binder ! I fried up some sweet onions too and tossed them into the steak pan right at the end. My oh my.

A very delicious sauce, and so simple to prepare. We will definatley make this recipe again.

This was an absolute great, easy & tasty way to prepare rib-eyes. I normally just season and grill which we are all very happy with. I decided to try something a little different and am glad I did! I did find the steaks had to cook longer than 4 minutes on each side. It could also be that the pan wasn't hot enough. I was trying to make sure the butter & oil to burn. This will definately be made over & over again!

Incredibly simple, juicy and delicious. As one who prefers grilled bbq steaks, this was a great change and well worth it. I cooked for 8 and each steak was perfect, especially with the addition of the balsamic reduction. It makes for a good show as my guests were already gathered in the kitchen, watching with anticipation as the steaks kept getting juicier and prettier to eat. I also added shallots and crushed junniper berries to the pan as I cooked. Will definitely make this again, especially on those nights when I can't get outdoors to grill.

I made this sauce w/ filet mignon. It was awesome. I served it w/ truffle mashed potatoes and haricot verts nw/ garlic butter. Very easy!

This is SO delicious, and SO simple, you almost can't mess it up. Treat yourself by using a superior (aged/reserve) Balsamic Vinegar, as opposed to the "table grade" found in most grocery stores... if you're spending alot on a good cut of meat, why skrimp on the sauce's only real ingredient!

I was not impressed with this recipe. It lacked the zip I expected it to have. I would not make it again. The rib eye steak with bearnaise butter found on this web site is a far superior receipe.

A suberb sauce! I made this recipe with strip loins and cut them to let the sauce penetrate the meat just before serving. Delicious!
