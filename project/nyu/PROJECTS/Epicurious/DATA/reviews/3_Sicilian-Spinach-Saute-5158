I really liked this - maybe people looking for a new twist on good ol' sauteed spinach and garlic would appreciate it more. Funny, I found the flavors subtle - but the ultimate test will be when I try it on my other half, and see if he can detect the currants! P.S. - I too would STRONGLY recommend always, always rinsing capers (not salty enough is easier to fix than too salty, after all,) before using in any recipe - and maybe I'm picky, but I think a good recipe would remind you!!

Overall I like it, but I know plenty of people won't. The flavors are strong and an unusual combination. Next time, I will increase currants somewhat and decrease capers significantly (and rinse them thoroughly before adding).

I've made this dish over ten times over ten different occasions-from small dinner parties to sitting in front of the tv with a roommate. It's fast, easy, original in flavor, and personally, I don't think the recipe needs to be touched. If you want less fat of course, lessen the cheese quantity. I must warn, however, that it may be too original of a flavor for some to handle, or even try, so make it for more adventurous palettes.

Very odd taste. The cheese is very strong and makes very salty.

Three forks. A quick and easy recipe and a great side dish. Make sure to cook lots of spinach as two bags just fed four people.
