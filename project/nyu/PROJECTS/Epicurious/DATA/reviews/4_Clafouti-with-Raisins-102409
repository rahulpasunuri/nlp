This is by far the best clafouti recipe I have ever made. The difference is that it is much lighter than the others. My previous attempts have been either too cake-like or too heavy-custardy. I think the difference is the powdered sugar and the small amount of flour. Like other reviewers, I have used fresh fruit, with great results.

A quick, easy and delicious dessert! I used sweet cherries, as I had some to use up, and added a touch of almond extract to the custard. Definitly a keeper!

This is a great recipe. The best clafouti that I have ever made. I used fresh pitted bing cherries instead of raisins and doubled the amount of fruit.

This is an excellent clafouti recipe. I made clafouti once before in the traditional manner with cherries and felt it was a little too pancake like. I think it called for too much flour. This version has very little flour and it is more custard like and more to my taste. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a little vanilla, which I would recommend. The raisins are nice and I'm sure this will work with whatever else anyone would want to add to it.

Wonderful, easy and quick. Grated a small amount of fresh nutmeg on the top with the powdered sugar. Will make again and try other dried fruits as cranberries, blueberries or cherries

I've used this recipe several times, with wonderful results. It's also nice to substitute tart cherries for the raisins.

This was great , but can I substitute green grapes for the raisins?

I made this dish a few years ago but the memory of how great it tasted is still with me. It is very tasty and simple. It doesn't sound like anything special but it truly tastes wonderful.
