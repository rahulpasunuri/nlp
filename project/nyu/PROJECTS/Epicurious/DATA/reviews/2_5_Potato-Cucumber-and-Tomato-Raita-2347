I made this when it first appeared in 1994. I served it with Tandoori Chicken Sandwiches and thought it was quite good. It is so nice to see old forgotten favorites on this website.

A little hot. I might use fewer peppers next time and consider using sour cream instead of plain yogurt (provided its not an Indian theme). Other than that, turned out great.
