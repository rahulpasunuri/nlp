This is by far one of the most delicious desserts I have ever tried! And even better  it is one of the easiest dessert recipes Ive made. I was just recently introduced to pots de crème, and this dessert is truly heavenly. High quality chocolate does make a big difference. I top it with the orange whipped cream from the Chocolate Puddings with Orange Whipped Cream recipe (also from Bon Appetit). Yum!

This recipe is absolutely perfect. I likely added 1-2 oz additional chocolate to a double batch, and served it with fresh raspberries dusted with icing (confectioners) sugar.

Just made these for a dinner party saturday night and they turned out fabulous. I used Ghiradelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate and they tasted great. Next time I'll add some fresh raspberries to the whipped cream and shaved chocolate I put on top. YUM

This dessert is so easy and always gets rave reviews. I usually add a few fresh raspberries or dust with confectioner's sugar before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a flute of Framboise.

I made these for my parents' anniversary last year and they came out GREAT! (And I'd never made anything this vein before, never used a bain marie--I'm not really a dessert person.) As we were cleaning up, a spare ramekin fell to the ground and smashed in the kitchen, and my younger sister begged my mom to let her eat it off the floor--we decided it was too dangerous, needless to say, haha. Anyway, that's how good they were! :)

A dinner party go to recipe. easy and can be prepared the day before. dense, creamy, intensely chocolate, whats not to love. must be cut with lightly sweetened whipped cream.

I love this recipe! It's the perfect consistency and chocolate flavor- really rich and easier than it sounds. I'm taking it to a family dinner tomorrow and I know it'll be a hit. I top it with a dollop of homemade whipped cream and a little grated dark chocolate.

I kind of screwed up by adding about 3T of frangelico and 3T of Chambord to give a nutty, fruity character to the dish. This basically made it so the stuff wouldn't cook. So, I needed to give it about an extra 40 mins (!!) of cook time. But, in the end, they were delicious!

Easy and fantastic. Easily halved and still made enough for 4 people. For the half recipe, I used 2 yolks, 2 tbsp dark muscovado and 1 tbsp demerara and a pinch of salt and it added a nice complexity. Also baked at 300 degrees for about 55 mins - perfect. Agree that straining is key.

I made this first thing Christmas morning following the recipe. Mine were in pot de creme cups with lids and I checked them at 30 minutes and they were done to perfection! Muah! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe required and put it in my pot de creme cups first thing Christmas morning, let them cool, and put them in the refrigerator. They were purely delicious! Muah! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I found this recipe to be concise, clear and perfect for getting that wet, silky texture pot de creme is known by. I followed it exactly with great results. The taste and richness is mostly dependent on the type of chocolate used. I'll be using this recipe again with different brands and percentages to experiment with the final outcome. Tres bien!

Pretty easy for such a treat. Served with whipped cream on top and a few fresh cherries on the side. I let the pieces of foil rest flat/loose over the cups so I could check for doneness easily and it turned out fine. Cook time was a bit longer than in recipe.

Delicious and heavenly. I made this recipe for dinner guests and everyone loved it. I had been searching for a good chocolate pots de créme and this is the one.

Try this with the caramel sauce from Profiteroles with Caramel Sauce, and a sprinkling of coarse sea salt. Awesome. I had some weirdness with the tops of these probably coming in contact with the foil -- next time I'd omit that.

I made this recipe exactly as is. I went about 5 minutes past the stated cooking time but they came out great anyway. This was a wonderful dessert and I did not top it with anything and it didn't need it! The chocolate flavor was intense and the creamy smooth texture was out of this world!!!

I made this for a dinner party and was told it was the best chocolate pots de creme my guests had ever tasted. The recipe was very easy to prepare and 55 minutes in the oven was perfect.

I have made this twice to rave reviews. I top them with whipped cream and a couple of raspberries.

Rating: 4
So easy! All my guests raved. I thought it was really hard to judge the "set but centers move slightly". I wound up using all 55 minutes -- at all other points the entire custard wiggled. But in the end all my guests were more than pleased. This will become a staple. I served it with a dollop of lightly sweetend whipped cream to tame the richness of the chocolate.

this was SO good! but i'm glad i read the reviews - mine was done under 40 min

I goofed up and only used 5 large egg yolks and it turned out great with perfect texture after 55 minutes of cooking (I am at high altitude). I also used a little more choclate (about 6 oz)

Delicious! I suggest checking them after 30 mins. They came out too solid after only 40.

The taste was delicious. However, the consistency was too solid for me in spite of the fact that I cut the baking time down to 40 mins. I would suggest checking after 30.

Very easy and tasty! I cooked this for 1 hour (partly because of unreliable heat in my oven), and everyone loved it! Also, I only cooled this for 2 hours because of time constraints, and it still tasted great.

Couldn't be easier to make. I used Ghirardelli chocolate; baked the pots for 50 minutes; strained the custard through both cheesecloth and a sieve. I served this with smoked sausage cassoulet (also from this site).

Have made Chocolate Pots several times over the Holidays for dinner parties. Delicious, used Scharffen Berger 70% Bittersweet chocolate, cooked for about 50 minutes and were perfect. Also have made and kept refrigerated for 5 days and are still perfect. Makes easy to prepare your dishes in advance. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream and raspberry on top and chocolate shavings for an elegant look.

Delicious and impressive Christmas dessert made in festive demi-tasses. Passed crystal bowls of seedless raspberry puree flavored with Grand Marnier and slightly sweetened vanilla whipped cream. Do watch the time - at 50 minutes they were ready with wobbly centers. And straining is a key step.

Absolutely decadent! I made this for a Christmas Party & it was a smashing success (lots of eye rolling & sighs of contentment). Everyone wanted the recipe & one actually tried to sneak off with the tray that had a couple of servings on it! Because this was one of several desserts offered I used 2oz ramekins & the amount was perfect. The recipe made about 14 (2oz) servings. I used Ghirardelli chocolate - 1/2 unsweetened & 1/2 semi-sweet & served it with a small dollop of whipped cream dotted with a fresh raspberry. I'm dying to try it with Valrhona Chocolate - which will probably put me in a pleasant, chocolate induced coma! Please try this recipe - it's so easy, elegant & delicious that you won't regret it!

Fantastic, smooth, delicate. I didn't havy any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers - the custards came out with a perfect, smooth and soft texture. The taste is great, not overly sweet. Use bittersweet or extra-bittersweeet HIGH QUALITY chocolate - that means NOT Hershey's! If you must use American brands I recommend Ghirardelli Double choc. chips or Scharffen Berger 62% or 70%, depending on your preference. Whipped cream on top is overkill, and in no way does the extra fat "lighten" this rich (but excellent) dessert. However, a small lozenge of creme fraiche is a nice accent. Whatever you do, please don't pile whipped cream on top of this. Your guests will kiss your feet.

Fantastic! I used semi-sweet and it was super smooth. I also served it with a layer of raspberry puree on the top, the flavors were perfect together.

So simple to make, but your guests will think you slaved in the kitchen for hours. Silky, indulgent, creamy pots of heaven . . I used semi-sweet chocolate (Bakers). Served it at a Valentine's Day dinner party . .

Made this for one of our Thanksgiving desserts.. it was a definite hit.. it was the first to go out of four desserts. We all agreed it was quite possibly the best Pots de Creme we'd had. Used bittersweet chocolate and garnished with a dab of whip cream and a sliced strawberry.. awesome!

whoops, I forgot to add that I divided this recipe into 8 instead of 6 servings and they were PLENTY large enough. This is a very rich dessert.

This is so easy and so good, and how wonderful to be able to make it so far in advance! I think whipped cream to serve is a must. This is one of my favorite desserts.

Absolutely fabulous! I made it with the semi-sweet chocolate. No problems with graininess (make sure you use high quality chocolate) and the texture was divine. These are incredibly rich. I didn't seve with whipped cream and I think next time I will. This gets 4 forks from me because it was delicious and very easy to make.

Rating: 3
I would give this 3 1/2 forks, actually. The texture was a bit too grainy, but was quite lovely and creamy. Appearance was great. I added 1/2 cup of Grand Marnier to a double batch. No whipped cream, because I'm a poor college student, but it was really just fantastic. Really intense taste. Not as good, of course, as the one I had at this great restaurant in Belltown (Seattle), but almost.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fantastic. I have made it 4 times now and each time my guests have claimed it is the best chocolate dessert they have ever had! The semi-sweet version is more of a crowd pleaser. Add a little whipped cream when you serve it - makes it even better.

The flavor is delicious but the texture is way too stiff. Pots de cremes are supposed to be a soft custard. This was so dense that you could stand a spoon up in it. After three trys I got it right by reducing the number of eggs to 4, and cooking at a lower temperature (300) for 25-30 minutes and allowimg for the fact that the chocolate will thicken considerably as it cools.

Rating: 4
Agreed on the richness--nobody was able to finish these monsters after the prime rib. I topped with unsweetened whipped cream, which balanced the insanity beneath nicely. Unfortunately didn't have a strainer or any cheesecloth on hand, so "strained" with a colander, which predictably did little to take the texture from smooth to riiiiiily smooth. A special, special dish--but only to be made when you want serious indulgence.

Rating: 3
This recipe was good but was way too rich. I would serve these in the smallest demi-tasse's you can find as a sort of amuse bouche with your coffee. (which I believe the French get it right when they serve coffee oafter desert...)I also used a chocolate which was 70% cocoa from France.

Rating: 4
Wonderful taste and texture. Followed another reviewer's advice and used Lindt 70% and it turned out delicious! The only thing I would suggest is using smaller ramekins. This recipe is very rich and too much of it was a bit overwhelming.

What a yummy--and very, very rich--treat! It was a hit with everyone.

Soooooo good, and so easy to make. Just perfect when you need a strong hit of chocolate without a lot of fuss. And very elegant as well. I used 200g. of Lindt 70%, and served it with whipped cream sweetened with manuka honey, which I thought complemented the deep, dark chocolate perfectly.

This is a very easy dessert to make and it tasted wonderful....not too sweet and just enough per serving. I topped it off with the Vanilla Whipped Cream recipe I found on this site. I made it for Easter and everyone enjoyed it. I will definitely make it again.

A friend of ours served this little bit of heaven for dessert last night. At first, I didn't think I had room in my tummy for much more food. I made room. WOW. This is one of those simple yet delicious recipes you will want to make over and over again.

This was one of the best and most simple desserts I've ever made. All of my guests loved it. I used a 4-ounce unsweetened chocolate bar and it was just the right sweetness (subtle, not overpowering). I served with cherry ice cream that had cherries and chocolate chunks in it, a variation on someone else's suggestion.

I have been making this recipe since it first was printed and it is always a hit. I make them in small ramekins and then present them, to each guest, on a plate with a piece of chocolate biscotti and small scoop of chocolate cherry gelato - brillant!

I made this for an informal dinner party and it was a hit with everyone. Simple, but rich and smooth! A great simple finish to a meal. Would difinitly make it again.
