I don't think I will roast potatoes again without using this method. Boiling them first resulted in a roasted potato that was crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. I did substitute fingerling potatoes and used pepper bacon.

Looking for something to serve for guests on Saturday and this will work beautifully. My guest does not eat bacon but I'll substitute duck fat for the bacon - I know it will be wonderful!

I really liked the method here. I usually roast potatoes unpeeled, but peeling them makes for a more attractive end result. I left out the bacon/bacon fat to accommodate a family member's diet, but I'll be sure to try it with the bacon next time. I added more parsley and salt to make up for the lost bacon flavor. I liked the flavor of the parmesan cheese but it didn't melt nicely. I'd probably leave it out next time or experiment with another cheese. This was a lovely side dish for beef tenderloin at Christmas dinner.

I made these to accompany a Thanksgiving turkey. They were a hit! I omitted the bacon grease prior to the final oven session to cut down on fat and calories and used a mixture of romano and parmesan but could've used more salt. Bit hit at dinner!

This was the featured potato dish for our Thanksgiving feast today. It got raves from everyone! I too will play around with different cheeses and perhaps adding ingredients, but we all agree it'll be making repeat appearances all year around!

I made these for a recent dinner party and everyone loved them. As with Lofty73, think I'll experiment with other cheeses (extra sharp cheddar?). No matter the cheese, I'll be making this one again and again.

This recipe is very easy to make, and everyone who ate had seconds, then nibbed at what was in the dish until it was gone!

Great recipe! Simple yet delicious. I will try some new cheeses next time, maybe a swiss or provolone.

The potatoes in this recipe are so good roasted golden brown. I use this method to make potatoes for lots of different dishes now. But nothing beats the cheese and bacon served with a bit of sour cream and green onions.

Extremely tasty potatoes, I made them without the garlic, flavours reminded me of a potatoe skin but just so much better with a peeled roasted potatoe...will be making this one often!

Made this today for dinner along with creamed spinach and baked chicken. Beautifully rich and satisfying meal. It was great. The potatoes were crisp with the cheese and bacon adding their own perfection. This is a keeper for sure.

These potatoes were a great success! They were easy to make, and stayed moist. I did have to cook them a bit longer than the 30 to 35 minutes called for to get them crispy, but maybe just 10 more minutes. I was able to do this step at home, and then sprinkle them with the garlic, s & p, bacon, cheese, and bacon fat, and finish cooking them at the dinner that I brought them to. Everyone liked them very much. Very flavorful!

Turned out perfect. Made as side to grilled rib-eyes. I did increase the roasting time at 425 to 40 mins and reduced the last step in the oven to just 10 mins. I also tossed the garlic with the potatoes at the beginning vs. the end. It helped to pulverize the cheese in the food processor so that it baked on nice and even vs. stringy. Next time I might do this w/ cheddar cheese. Extra salt in the final roasting step also helped.

I just read the 2 bad reviews, I don't get it. I made these last year for Thanksgiving and they were a HUGE success. I was just looking up the recipe for this year, they will be a staple!

You must not know how to cook then because this recipe is wonderful and was a great hit on Christmas.

These potatoes were awesome! They do need a bit more salt. I used Kraft 5 Italian Cheese on the potatoes and followed the rest of the recipe and the potatoes turned out great! Definitely a keeper!

Awful. Potatoes were dry; parmesan cheese dry; overall effect DRY and gritty

This recipe was my biggest Thanks Giving disappointment. I gravitated towards this dish on account of all of the pre-work I could do, but the dish came out petrified. Your biggest enemy is having the potatoes dry out. Reduce the heat slightly, and definitely reduce the cooking time. Good luck.
