Macaroons are hard to find. Generic coconut cookies (without filling) work well. Also, I enjoy using Pepperidge Farms coconut cookies. I think the crust could use less butter, perhaps even cut in half. I use a 10" pan. The sauce IS runny, but it freezes perfectly. If you don't have espresso, use freeze dried Folgers coffee. The first time I made this, I made a batch of chewy coconut macaroon cookies and just used it for the crust--spread it out and baked it. I will never to that again as it did not cut well and the texture defied the silkiness of the ice cream. There's not much to NOT like about this cake unless you don't like coffee, mocha, chocolate, or ice cream. It doesn't take a lot of time at all--just planning.

Kind of yuck. Too bitter for kids and too sweet for adults. And reallllly expensive. Shame.

Great cake for a special occasion. My mom said it was the best ice cream cake she had ever had. Macaroon cookie crumb crust was fantastic. I made the mocha sauce just as written. It did seem runnier than I was expecting, but when frozen in the pie it was a perfect consistency. One note, I used an 8 inch springform instead. I should have cut back a bit on the bottom ice cream layer. I didn't have quite enough room for the top ice cream. Highly recommend.

I have been making this ice cream cake since 1990, and it is always a hit. To reduce fat and calories, I use frozen yogurt and no one notices. It is that good. Yes, you have to plan in advance, make it the day before to allow for the individual layers to be frozen. If you start the day before, adding layers is no problem after they freeze.

I really like this recipe I've been making it for many summers. It's easy and looks like you spent a lot of time making it

This was a bit time consuming withe the layers being frozen separately but it was well worth it. I didnt have enough of the instant espresso left so I decided not to use water, but left over morning coffee instead and the sauce turned out wonderfully. Instead of macaroons, I made a pack of Trader Joe's truffle choc brownies in a large pan so it would be only about half an inch thick. I then had that sectioned to fit a glass lidded tray bottom. After that, I followed the recipe except I only used espresso choc chip ice cream for those layers. Having some nut allergies in the group, I used a couple broken up Scor bars for on top of the final choc sauce layer. This was awesome, and consumed by a group of 14 within minutes!

Can't get any easier than this and it looked great too. Huge hit! I think it definitely helps to do the crust and ice cream a day ahead in order to have it firm. This one is a keeper for sure.

After seeing previous reviews, I only used 1C. water in the sauce which worked well. Otherwise, I did exactly as recipe directed. Excellent balance of coffee and chocolate flavors. Guests said it's a keeper!

This was really good, and easy to make. It's only time consuming because you have to freeze each layer separately, but I found that even 30 minutes in the freezer between each step was fine. You just need several hours at the end to make sure the cake is completely frozen through before you serve it. I used oreo cookies instead of macaroons, which was excellent. Also, I think using water in the fudge sauce instead of cream serves a specific purpose - it freezes better. Although the leftover sauce that you pour on top may be a little too runny, the sauce that you use in the cake freezes nice and firm (which is how an ice cream cake should be), spreads easily, and is so delicious. I also found that with the oreo cookie crust and the rich fudge sauce between the layers, the cake didn't need to be served with additional fudge sauce anyway. My family and friends said this was the best ice cream cake they had ever had!

This is really good, but beware of the type of cookies you use. The crunchy macaroons work well, the soft, stick to the bottom of the pan. DFor some reason, macaroons are hard to find. I used some macaroon sandwich cookies with success, but the soft and chewy ones were a stinker. I agree that the sauce is a bit thin, but it all tasted great. I would use less water in the sauce next time.

Everyone seemed to love this cake. I used Oreos instead of Macaroons. I have made it twice once with the Coffee Ice Cream layer and once with a Heath Bar Ice Cream layer (I left out the coffee in the sauce when I made it with the Heath Bar Ice Cream). The sauce was a little runny both times, I think you could put less water in it (or even use whipping cream or milk to make it more fudgy).

This dessert was excellent I made my own maccaroon for the crust (baked the crust as a big cookie in the spring form pan) and for the center I also used a mocha sauce that was thicker as the recipe for the sauce seemed awfully thin.

Help! I am in the process of making this and can't find "Mother's Brand" macaroon cookies. I guess my question is to anyone who has made this - are these cookies soft or crunchy macaroons? Thanks to anyone who can answer!

This really was a delicious cake. I was dubious about the macaroon and coffee flavors going together, but it was perfect. This cake is VERY easy to make, but it is time-consuming. There's nothing difficult, but each new layer has to have time to freeze before you can add the next. The macaroon layers were quite difficult to cut through, but that was a small price to pay for the yumminess!

Don't start your diet until after you've made this incredible dessert! My husband, who never eats dessert, couldn't resist this and absolutely loved it.
