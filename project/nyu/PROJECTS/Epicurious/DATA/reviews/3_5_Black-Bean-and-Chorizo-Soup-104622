The soup was tasty. I used dried black beans and cooked them with the chorizo and onion. The additional salt red pepper flakes were not needed with the chorizo and broth. I added one bag of collard greens and some chopped zuchini.

Made this last night with chicken chorizo and garbanzo beans and it was delicious. I left out the green peppers and used limes instead of lemons. I also took the great suggestion by some reviewers to offer sour cream and grated cheese as toppers. We're going to have the leftovers tonight! Yum!

Delicious! super quick and easy, and if you add a whole bag of spinach or mustard greens (used both but chopped it up super fine so my little would eat it :)) a complete healthy meal. didn't add pepper flakes so not spicy, but did serve with avocado slices, cotija cheese and fresh diced tomatoes. wonderful alternative to the more common tortilla soup. some one told me there's even a chicken chorizo sausage on market if you want less fatty.......

This was fantastic, the boyfriend LOVED it. I used yellow pepper and shallots as that was all I had, I also added some spinach. I suggest topping with sliced lime rather than lemon and cheddar cheese and/or sour cream. Fabulous, easy dish I will definitely make again.

In a word, this soup is delicious! Both my partner and I are usually lukewarm about black beans but we both went back for seconds of this dish. The flavours of beans, chorizo and cumin blend together exceptionally well. Will definitely make this again.

I made a vegetarian version with soy chorizo and vegetable stock -- perfect. I also doubled the cumin and added about one tablespoon of sofrito to deepen the flavor without adding heat. Great with lime and a dollop of sour cream, as others have suggested. The family, including non-soup-lovers loved it. Will definitely make this again.

It's been a really nasty day here and a hearty soup like this one seemed perfect for the cold rainy weather. It didn't disappoint. I used red pepper rather than the green but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It's incredibly easy and very full flavored. Highly recommended

This is the best black bean soup ever. Easy enough to make for 20 people. Make sure you use the "dry" Spanish style chorizo instead of Mexican. It makes a difference. I've found the Quijote brand to be the best.

I've made this soup for years, and I love it. I have made a few adjustments, but remember, it's a 40-minute meal. Once you start "shocking" the garlic and adding poblano chilies, you've gone beyond the 40-minutes.

Rating: 3
I reserve some of the beans, puree the soup, and add at the end. Frying the sausage helps, so I cut the links lengthwise, cook with the veggies, and then cook in the stock for a few minutes but reserve until the end so as not to over boil. I also find adding a little sherry is a nice touch.

This is my new favorite soup. I double the recipe and freeze it in individual portions for lunches. It freezes very well. Like other reviewers, I use a combination of sweet and poblano peppers and I puree the bean and veg mixture before adding the pre-cooked sausage. I also add a couple of tins of corn which give a nice sweet crunch and are a nice contrast to the smooth beans.

This is a regular in my repertoire. I've substituted poblanos for the peppers with good results. Also, the soup reduces to make a great bean dip. Pairs nicely with marzen, pilsner, and hefeweizen-style beers.

A keeper for a delicious quick soup. I used three Johnsonville chorizo sausages (removed casing) and finished with sour cream and basil. I admit to being somewhat of a food snob, however, I have to say that Johnsonville makes excellent chorizo and I love their "hot" italian sausage.

Rating: 4
Very nice soup. Recommend making it ahead of time and resting it for up to a day and then re-heating. I stayed pretty much on the recipe, while, at the same time sticking to the time-honored practice of using things in the soup. I de-cased a hot Italian sausage and fried it with a Chorizo, which I the sliced. I fired the sausage first, removed it, then shocked the garlic, softened the onions, and then added the rest of the veggies, along with some flat leaf parsley, whichh goes with everything. Transferred it all to a stock pot and simmered for an hour and a half. It was OK then, but soup and stew ages nicely when cooled

Great soup. Incredibly easy, but very flavorful and hearty. Pefect "comfort food" for the Northeast winter months.

Rating: 3
Great flavor. Used hot italian sausage instead of chorizo. Used a poblano pepper. Next time I will put the sausage aside and add it at the end, since it's easier to partially puree the soup without it in the pot. Fresh lime juice is essential - really compliments the black beans.

Rating: 3
Good recipe, but I did some tweaking of the recipe to suit my tastes. Topped with a squeeze of lime, a dollop of sour cream, and a sprinking of grated cheese, this was a soup to enjoy. Leftovers were even better! I plan on making this again soon!

This is very flavourful and ever better the next day. My changes: had no chorizo (and didn't feel like schlepping to the market) so I used 4 ozs. of leftover Thanksgiving ham, diced. Also, I pureed 1 cup of the beans before adding them to the pot to thicken it. Doesn't make enough and I will definitely make it again.

Definitely a keeper. This was super easy and fast to make, and very flavorful. I used two cloves of garlic, deglazed the pot with about 1/2 cup of red wine and added half a can of tomatos with juices. Also, I used a hungarian smoked sausage, but I am sure andouille would work well too. Next time I will add some of the bean liquid to thicken the soup.

Loving thick soups that simmer for hours, I did the following: Sauteed 1 onion, 1/2 peeled bell pepper, added 1 lb crumbled chorizo, removed grease, added 1 clove garlic, 3 c stock, 1 beer, 2 cans Kund SW Bk Beans w/Cumin/Chili spices, undrained, 1 can plain Bk Beans, pureed. No other spices, it was HOT. Served over rice w/jack,onions,sour cream with Cheddar Cornmeal Scones. Additional cheese added to scones, which were bland but wonderful texture and perfect w/this spicy soup. Thanks for all the suggestions!

We really liked this soup. I used turkey kilbasa that I had on hand & threw in a diced sweet potato to offset the saltiness. It was very easy & hearty -- perfect for a snowy day.

This recipe was incredible. I made it for my boyfriend and I, and served tortilla chips and french bread on the side. I used red bell pepper like one cook instead of the green pepper. I also used several cloves of garlic. The chorizo sausage I used was the spicy kind. I also used half of the juice from the beans and half chicken stock. My boyfriend told me this was 5 stars and he wanted to have this again. (he ate two bowls) The lime juice in it gave it an added kick. Yum!

I make this often, with revisions. I use red bell pepper, 2 cloves garlic and 1 teaspoon cumin. To eliminate some of the fat, I cook the chorizo first, blot it off and add with the beans. Add a dollop of low fat sour cream with some lime in it. Good stuff!

Rating: 3
I changed this around a bit and ended up (intentionally) with something like a picadillo. I used almost a pound of sausage and omitted the chicken stock, but did include the bean canning liquid. I simmered it until it thickened considerably and served it over rice. Very good. I have also used a meatless version of chorizo called Soyrizo (it's cheaper than real chorizo, and believe it or not, just as good, taste-wise)and it turned out very well.

This is a very nice soup and with modifications, the recipe can be great! Though unlike the other reviewers, I found the soup to be too thick. Because I prefer a thinner soup, I added more stock. Also, the next time I make this I will add less red pepper; I didn't much like the combination of the intense flavor of the chorizo with the intense heat of all those pepper flakes. Over all very tasty-- especially with lots of fresh lime squeezed in before serving.

Rating: 3
This is really good but needs a little modification. Add less broth - start out by adding half of what recipe asks for. You will definitely want to puree half of the beans. I doubled the garlic and added chopped jalapenos.

This is an absolutely wonderful soup, flavorful and thick. Using the previous reviewers' suggestions, this is going to become a staple at our house. The modifications I made were as follows: I used 12 ounces of Andouille sausage, rather than the 4 ounces of chorizo. I doubled the spices (omitting the salt entirely - I found it didn't need it) and deleted the green pepper. I also used only 2 cups of chicken broth. Finally, I pureed, in a blender, one of the two cans of black beans, and included the liquids from both cans in the soup. I highly recommend this recipe!

Have read ALL the reviews first I find this a great recipe and dead easy. I think I avoided the 'broth floating with beans and sausage' problem by cooking up my own black beans .... since we can't get them ready cooked in cans in this country. The beans produced a nice thick, black, sauce of their own so I added that to the soup instead of chicken broth!

Rating: 3
Delicious soup, but best if let to stand for a day before serving. I find that the flavors meld, much as you would expect from a salsa. I also reduced the amount of chicken broth, as I like the soup to be somewhat thicker. Definitely a dish that will be repeated.

I added some leftover pork loin (I needed to use it up) and cut back slightly on the chicken broth. It was very good. I served it with corn kernel and chipotle corn bread as a side and dished it over rice with onion. I know that some people are looking for a thicker mixture, but in my experience eating authentic Puerto Rican and Cuban dishes, the soups/stews are actually pretty brothy - much like "beans floating in broth" rather than a really thick stew. I will definitely make this again.

This soup is being added to my regular repertoire because it was so tasty, easy to make and a change from our norm.

The family liked this a lot, right down to the 11-year-old. Served with whole-grain bread and caesar salad for a complete dinner. I used extra chorizo, food-processed most of the beans after cooking, adding back whole beans. The flavor/texture mix is great: Smooth and a bit spicy. Peppy comfort food?

A very nice, hearty soup, well complemented with a nice, fresh, whole-wheat bread. Real chorizo definitely adds a nice, smokey taste. Pepper flakes and cayenne can be adjusted without hurtind the overall flavour, or added after the fact. Definitely dallop with sour cream and garnish with cilantro when serving.

Having 3 younger children in the house that don't like food that is too spicy, I was a little concerned it might be a problem. I made this recipe with the chicken chorizo from Trader Joe's. I also added more broth, doubled the chorizo and mashed some of the beans to make it a bit(not too much) thicker. I left out the green pepper because my kids don't like them. I then served it over white rice. I loved it and so did they. It was very tasty, easy and fast to prepare. It was a bit like a stew. it really smelled great as it was cooking. I don't know if that was because of the kind of chorizo I used. Hopefully it was lower fat too

Great easy recipe, but I added approx. 1/2 C. of pureed tomato to increase robust flavor. Will make again and again.

I thought this soup was pretty good. I did not really change the ingredients that much despite other reviewers suggestions. I did double the chorizo and I did puree 3/4 of the beans with a cup of broth in the blender prior to adding it to the soup. The rest of the beans went in whole for the presentation aspect. I really would call this a chili though rather than a soup...looks, tastes, smells like chili. Overall it was a nice dish for a cold day. BTW...it's better the next day!

This is a great dish, although it does need quite a bit of help. I used Mexican chorizo, mashed both cans of beans and added only one can of broth. I used a dash of garlic, and onion powder plus the sauce from one can of chipotles in adobo. Serve with a dolop of sour cream and your in business. Perfection

Rating: 4
Who says too many cooks spoils the broth? I used the suggestions of corn, chilies, chipotles and to mash 1/2 the beans before adding. These ingredients pulled the soup altogether. I garnished with cilantro, lime, scallions and baked whole wheat tortillas chips and served with corn bread.

The soup was very good. I used one can of chicken broth and added a bay leaf. I also was out of chorizo so I used regular breakfast sausage (like Jimmy Dean)in a tube. I also mashed the beans well.

If you double the chorizo, garlic, green pepper; increase the onion and the spices just a bit; use 45 ounces of canned black beans and mash all the beans coursely with a potato masher. Serve it with a warm, crusty bread and roasted garlic (to spread on the bread), you will have made an unbelievable meal. I can't wait to do make it again. It was so easy.

I was glad I read the reviews before actually making the soup. I pureed two cans of black beans, added a can of black bean soup, and just enough broth to thin it just a bit. I too doubled the spices and dispensed with the green pepper. It does go splendidly with the cheddar cornmeal scones. The two are a perfect combination on a cold winter night.

Made this soup last week when it snowed.... What a tremendous disapointment. We actually had half a bowl and threw the rest of it out. I was expecting a very creamy black bean soup that you can buy at the grocery store. Instead, I got soup that was broth with floating beans and sausage. My quest continues for the perfect Black Bean Soup recipe.......

I agree with the cook from Bethesda. If you choose to make this recipe, cut down on the broth and mash the beans. Adding more spices would also be a good idea, and it will probably need a good deal more salt. Made as is, this is not yet a keeper. With adjustments it could be.

Rating: 4
I added 2 extra links of Mexican chorizo (the dry cured type is unavailable here), deleted the bell pepper as I didn't have any on hand, and doubled the spices. Also mashed about 1/2 the beans prior to adding them. Incredible dish! I'm usually lukewarm about beans in general, but this stuff I could eat every day. The first words out of my husband's mouth were "This is a keeper!". Serve this with Cornmeal & Cheddar scones (on this site), and some Corona Extra or Modelo Negro beer. Easy, quick, fantastic!!!

My husband loved it!!! I used a lb. of Chorizo sausage. Added one can Black Bean soup and pureed one can Black Beans (2 would of been better) and added a little flour to the onion, sausage and garlic (2 cloves mashed) mixture. Used hot sauce for flavor. Served it over rice with cornbread.

Very tasty. I too would recommend mashing half of the black beans, and maybe reducing the chicken broth depending on how many people you are serving. Still, this was a very easy, and very good meal.

I made this recipe according to the printed version and would not recommend it as is. I thought the consistency, even after mashing a bit, was unattractive and unappetizing. I expected the rich, thick, deep-black soup I've had in restaurants. What I got instead seemed to be chicken broth with beans and sausage floating in it. I would definitely recommend using less broth, and taking previous reviewers suggestions of processing perhaps one-half of the beans and broth (not the sausage) and adding it back to the pot. Taste was good, especially with a small wedge of lemon squeezed into each serving.

I Loved this recipe. Took many suggstuions. Used a bay leaf, pured 1 cup of beans (not Sausage) and added back to thicken. Also added 1 tb cornstarch in cold waer.

This recipe comes pretty darn close to my Mom's recipe for black beans which I consider the best. I made some modifications. I added a small amount of cubed salt pork and heated it along with the chorizo. In turn you must reduce the amount of salt later in the recipe. I used 1 can of black bean and one can of black bean soup( do not drain) and reduced the amount of chicken stock. I added bay leaves and simmered longer. To make the soup thicker I removed a cup of the soup (minus the chorizo) and blended it in the food processor. Adobo spice gives it a little kick if you want it spicier. Our family also likes it a little thicker and served over white rice.

This was wonderful the first time I made it following the recipe exactly. However, the next time I made it I used a canned chipotle chile in adobo instead of the red pepper flakes which added a fabulous smoky heat to the dish. Please note I only used one chile from the can, not the whole can.

My soup came out more like a chili. I used vegan chorizo and found that I had to use two links to get the spicy flavor I was looking for, that might be why mine came out so thick. If I did make this again, I would take the chili track a little further and add corn and some dice tomatoes too. I also found that trying to mash the beans really just mashed up the chorizo, most of the beans stayed whole.

Rating: 3
I made this last night, with some trepidation because it sounded too easy to be good, but it was truly outstanding. I let didn't add the garlic intil the onions were almost done, and I let it sit for about an hour after it cooked. I also sprinkled some grated extra-sharp cheddar on each serving. Three caveats if you make this: 1. Get the very best fresh chorizo you can find. 2. Use homemade chicken stock if you possibly can. 3. Be sure to mash the beans after cooking with a potato masher. It makes all the difference in the world.
