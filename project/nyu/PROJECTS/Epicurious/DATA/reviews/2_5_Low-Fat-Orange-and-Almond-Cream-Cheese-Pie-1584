I've made this many times since it was first published. The filling is good but nothing like cheesecake, so don't expect the cheese pie to be a lowfat substitute for that. It is nice and light and even my husband (a cheesecake fanatic) mentioned he liked that it doesn't leave you feeling heavy and bloated after you eat a slice. The crust could be improved; I usually just use a graham cracker crust, or even just layer the filling with crumbs. You can top it with anything you please but the oranges as recommended are very pretty. Whatever you decide on, do use a flavorful fruit topping since the filling is very mild on its own.

This dessert is really light and refreshing. I am always on the look out for low fat desserts and meals as I am watching my cholesterol. I did not know what granola was so I followed another recipe for low fat biscuit pastry for the base. It turned out great.Would definitely make again, but to serve for a crowd would defintely double.
