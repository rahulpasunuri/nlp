Easy prep, used whole fillet, and cut up in smaller pieces. Needed only half of the sauce!

OK, I only made the sauce part to serve w tuna steaks... I accidentally used Wasabi instead of Miso but my boyfriend loved it!!

Made this recipe (and reviewed it) about a year ago. We still love this recipe, and found the sauce to be excellent with steamed or grilled artichoke.

The dish looked great and the flavors were delish! I used both salmon and tuna for this one and although both were good, I preferred the salmon. I served it as the main dish rather than as nibbles. Next time I'll make it using whole or larger pieces of fish. I over baked these and they were dry, but still tasty.

The orange miso sauce was worth 4 forks, even though I had to make with white miso since I could not find yellow. The salmon was just ok, I used white and black sesame seeds-I might try it the way the san francisco cook made it to see if the fish improves in flavor.

Delicious and relatively easy to make. The miso and sesame worked well with the orange flavor. This beautiful dish was enjoyed by all, and became our newest addition to our list of favorites.

These were very good, I will be sure to make them again. I can also see, as other reviewers have noted, how it would be good cooking the whole filet as an entree. Very, very pretty and tasty.

This recipe is completely forgettable and I'm taking it out of my recipe box once I review it. A much better salmon appetizer is the maple-pepper salmon bites, which are phenomenal and very easy. But you can skip the sesame-crusted salmon with orange-miso sauch. Blah.

This was a hit at New Years even though I couldn't find Miso during my last mad dash to the grocery store. Very good!

This appetizer was a huge hit at my cocktail/cookie swap party. Everyone wanted the recipe. The recipe did make too much sauce; I would recommend halving the recipe. I used 2/3 white sesame seeds, 1/3 black, and it looked beautiful.

I have made this recipe many times, with salmon and tuna and it is always a huge hit.

This was excellent. I wanted to make this as a full piece of fish. I seared the fish for 30-40 secs on each side over high heat. I then spread the sauce over the fish and topped with sesame seeds. I broiled the fish for 5 min and then baked it for another 7 min at 350. It came out perfect with an excellent crust. I also added a squeeze of lemon juice to the sauce.

Xmas cocktail party hit and very easy. Did not use yellow miso (couldn't find) but soy sauce was fine. However, felt recipe for sauce was too big, had WAY more sauce than needed, next time will halve or more. Agree, mixture of black and white sesame seeds was key.

Fantastic! This was so easy to prepare and makes a gorgeous presentation. I made this for a holiday cocktail party. I poured the sauce into a squeeze bottle and put a little bit onto each bite making it easier to serve.

I substituted 1 container of Dannon Fat Free yogurt in lieu of the mayo -- and it was still fine! Also, try to use both colored sesame seeds - dramatic presentation. If using salmon steaks, you will need to cook the fish a bit longer. Try 15-20 minutes for a 1" thick filet. Mmmmm-mmmm!

These disappeared quickly at my cocktail party last Friday. Make sure to get white and black sesame seeds for dramatic presentation...I found the black ones at Whole Foods. Nobody would believe they weren't marinated or more complicated to make. Next time I make it, I will go a bit lighter on the sesame oil in the sauce, and a little heavier on the orange zest. Though I didn't use OJ concentrate, just fresh OJ. Yum.

A super recipe of great ease and flavor. Also great because I love to eat fish but don't generally serve it as a main course as there are still people who don't like fish. ie: they won't starve if they don't eat the appetizer.

Also the first dish to disappear at my recent open house. I would make two servings next time!

Very delicious, beautiful and easy to make. It was the first dish to dissappear at a recent party. I didn't use as much oil to toss the fish as the recipe called for.

Since I wanted a main dish, I made this with salmon filet, cut into individual serving pieces. I brushed the salmon with egg to adhere the sesame seeds (instead of oil) and substituted light sour cream for mayo in the sauce. It was great and very easy to prepare.

I didnt like this, but I think it is my own bias against the orange-miso combination. I find the orange overpowering and prefer the miso-mustard recipe.

I ahve made it twice. First time, exactly like the recipe, and the next time as a main course, keeping the fish whole. Both times to rave reviews. Everyone wants the recipe. Wonderful and extremely fast and easy.

This orange miso sauce is very good. I've made this recipe a couple times and it is good. Better are the Maple-Pepper Salmon bites. Use THIS sauce with the Maple-Pepper Salmon bites. It's brilliant!

This was served at a dinner party I attended as a a main course, and it was delcious. Seemed to be a big hit with everyone. As I didn't cook it, I can't comment on the difficulty or ease of preparation. However, it was so good, I'll make it in my own kitchen sometime soon. Thanks!

This recipe has been a a repeat hit! The first time I made it, everyone who tried it wanted the recipe. It's incredibly easy, and the flavors blend extremely well together. Also great for a main dish, served as a sauce over a larger cut of salmon.

OK, I didn't follow this recipe much... instead I made a big salmon filet with this preparation and skipped the miso sauce as well. But as a basic idea it works well for a filet, I agree, the mix of white and black sesame seeds is key. It was a huge hit. I made it with garlic mashed potatoes and spinach sauteed with shallots, pretty good instructions for both are on this site multiple times. Simple and great.

This dish is a cocktail party standard for me. It's so easy that I feel a little embarrassed when people rave about it. Seek out the black sesame seeds - makes for great presentation.

Great flavor and easy to make!

Excellent party dish --it looks impressive but doesn't take very long to make. The key is in the black and white sesame seeds. Didn't have yellow miso on hand so used red miso paste instead along with a dash of soy suace. Tasted great!

Everyone at my cocktail party loved this. I think it's good and very pretty too. The contrast of the the black and white really catch's the eye.This dish should be eaten the day of.

I make this as a main dish. I use a fillet of salmon. Toast the sesame seeds first, then press into the salmon on one side only. Saute, seed side down first. Turn after a few minutes and finish off in the oven. YUMMY!

Coming from a non-salmon lover, this recipe is just fantastic. Simple to prepare, elegant in presentation and gobbled down by guests. I've used it for three cocktail parties and have no plans of stopping.

I have made this several times and shared it with many of my friends. Very impressive to serve and wonderful to eat. Also not that difficult to make. I never did find Yellow Miso but just used the white.

Great recipe! Easy and delicious! I would use as little oil as possible when prepping the salmon. It really doesn't need much, maybe less than a tablespoon, if any at all. The sauce is great. We use it as a dip for tempura green beans. I used the juice from one or two oranges, reduced, instead of frozen concentrate. Why use frozen OJ if you need zest anyway?

Rating: 2
I'd make it again - I just wouldn't use oil to make the sesame seeds stick to the salmon. Too oily when cooked. Black and white sesame seeds look really cool though.

Rating: 3
I have made this dish many times! Usually for a quick lunch. I use organic barley miso which gives a mellow, yet rich, nutty flavor. I also toast my sesame seeds first. Again enhancing the flavor. I also NEVER use frozen orange juice for ANYTHING! GROSS!!!! I use fresh blood oranges- superb!

I loved this! The sauce is great and could be used over other fish. I was afraid that the cubes would break apart or that the ssseeds would get into the sauce after dipping but only lost a few. I prep'ed the salmon about 2 hours before the party and it worked out great. A real hit

I love this recipe! I have made it three times in the last few weeks since I first found it. I have made it with fresh sea bass, salmon, and orange roughy. It was definitely best with the sea bass, but it was also the most expensive and fresh of the three fishes. I have made it as a dinner-sized portion each time, but am planning to make it for a party this weekend with the bite-sized pieces.

This is a great recipe, easy and elegant presentation...I've also made it in entree sized portions at it is just as great!!

I love this recipe - it is so quick and easy! I use light mayo for the sauce, and while it is a little runny, I think the trade off is worth it. The mixture of black and white sesame seeds is essential for the presentation.

Rating: 4
great flavours! the first time we made this, the sauce was a little runny, probably because we made it a day ahead with LIGHT mayonaisse. We made this again for New Years Day using real (FULL-FAT) mayo. Reviews were "Amazing", "Fabulous", "Unbelievable".

This is very nice, and would work perfectly as a dinner-sized portion of fish served on a pool of the sauce.

This was gone in 15 minutes, the key is using salmon that is fresh! So yummy I could eat the whole thing for dinner.

This recipe was a big hit at a cocktail party this weekend. Definitely use regular mayo ( we used trader joe's). It was off the table within 5 inutes of putting it out. Use the fork-like toothpicks for easy serving.

This was the only item on a cocktail buffet this weekend not finished. I was not crazy about the sauce and flavor(and apparently neither was anybody else). Idea is good so I will play around with recipe.
