Hey, this may be a dumb question, but are people using dried cranberries or fresh ones when they make this recipe? Thanks!

A really good apple pie. I used a the cream cheese flaky pie crust found on this site because I always have good luck with it. I reduced the cranberries in apple juice because I had it on hand. If you don't want the apples to shrink I allow them to sit in the sugar and spices for a few hours till it gives a cup or so of juice which I reduce and add later with the flour or cornstarch. I like Rose Levy Branbaum's apple pie better this one was a little less rich and a bit tart for my taste. Everyone else liked it however. Maybe more butter next time?

This was my first venture into pie-making, and it could not have worked better! The only adjustments I made: - Used cranberry pomegranate juice b/c I had some on hand. - Used about 10 oz. cranberries. Spread about 8 oz. on bottom of pie crust, per recipe. Dotted the rest over the apples in the middle of the pie. - Mixed about 4 or 5 tbsp of flour with the apples to soak up more of the liquid - Used 1 tbsp cinnamon in the apples instead of 1/2 tsp (I can't imagine what it would've tasted like with that little cinnamon). I am so glad I found this recipe! I have never made anything like a pie before, and this came out Absolutely. Perfect. The apples did shrink away from the top crust a little, but that didn't affect the taste or presentation at all. It is just as tart as other reviewers have said, so eating it with vanilla ice cream is a definite plus. Love this pie and can't wait to make it again!

Delicious. I was running out of sugar so used 3/4 C loosely packed brown sugar instead.

I have made this pie several times for Thanksgiving and its always a favorite. Easy and delicious--the cranberry is a tart contrast to the apples and the cranberry alone would be delicious on ice cream or in a tart. This time I used 4 apples--Gala and Yellow Delicious and it worked out just fine!

I thought this was a great tasting pie but I had trouble with the filling being very watery despite me cooking the cranberries down to very stiff jelly like consistency. It made the crust pretty soggy. I used all the apples (which is an enormous mound) and there was a substantial void between the crust and apples once the apples cooked down. I served it with homemade cinnamon ice cream. I will take another reviewer's advice next time to add corn starch to the mixture.

I followed the recipe and it was great, no extra liquid at all. Perhaps people aren't fully cooking the cranberry sauce? I also used cranberry juice cocktail instead of cranberry juice, because it was all I could find. The sauce was great regardless of the substitute. I also made the full bag of cranberries into the sauce, without adding more sugar etc. and that probably made my sauce thicker, which was a good thing, I think. My apples also sank and left a big gap between the pie top and the apples, but it was fine... and really delicious!

This recipe is delicious! I made it for thanksgiving and the crowd loved it. Previous reviews had mentioned the filling being watery; I added about 1/2 tbsp of corn startch to the apple mixture and didn't have any problems. One other note, it only took 40min at 375deg. for mine cook completely, so keep an eye on it for the last 10-15 min. I'm looking forward to making it again soon!

This is my all time favorite apple pie recipe! I make it every year during the holidays, and it's always devoured. The cranberries give a fantastic tart taste contrast, and the amount of apples is to die for. when making the crust, make sure the butter is cold enough or it will be too mushy and difficult to work with.

Rating: 4
this pie is excellent, but you need maybe HALF of the apples recommended. i used equal numbers of granny smith and pink lady apples (keep the peels on- the pie looks so pretty that way, plus i'm guessing the peel helps absorb the juice). since cranberries usually come in 12 oz packages, i used the extra 4 oz of cooked cranberries and added the leftover apples to make some yummy applesauce. i also recommend adding nutmeg to the pie. i was afraid this thing would be way too tart, but the flavor was PERFECT.

I've made this pie twice and, even after cooling, had to drain fluids off. Just tipped and drained, still delicious and no soggy pie crust (the pie crust recipe is fabulous, too). Getting ready to make it again, anyone find a cure for the excess fluids? I'm no applie pie expert.

Loved the pie but the filling was kind of watery. Also the cranberry ribbon wasn't an actual layer but mixed in with the apples a bit. Did anyone else experience this? It was a delicious pie in spite of these minor details and I plan on trying it again for Thanksgiving. A nice twist on the traditional apple pie.

This pie was the best! My Husband and Dad devoured it. I used a regular pie pan and used 4 braeburn apples and decreased amount of sugar in ribbon and apple mixture. Served it with vanilla bean icecream. Will definitely make this over and over again.

i thought this was delicious. i forgot about needing a deep-dish and so wound up having way more apples than i could fit in the pan i had, but it was still fantastic. and it was a hit at the thanksgiving dinner i attended.

My pie was also a towering monstrosity before it was baked, and then when it was cooked, it ended up being a normal sized pie with a huge hollow top. This didn't make for a nice presentation before, but especially after it was cut. I also thought that it ended up being bland, too-sweet, and one-dimensional in flavor. The pie also turned into an apple sauce in some spots with dry apples in other spots. I would imagine that there are probably much better apple-cranberry pie recipes out there.

I took this to a thanksgiving dinner I was invited to and everyone loved it. We were short on time so we just used a can of cranberry sauce which came out just fine, and made simple crumb topping instead of the traditional upper crust. Delicious.

This recipe was delicious. The kids and adults loved it. I was fearful that the cranberry would make it too tart, but it was just a wonderful compliment to the apples. Even my 5 year old said this was the best pie she ever had. I baked this the day before and then just warmed up the slices and served them with ice cream for dessert.

i make this as a thanksgiving staple every year. One hint I do to make it easier what with all the other thanksgiving cooking going on, is that I make this and my thanksgiving cranberry sauce the day before. That way I can just use some of my sauce for the cranberry layer. I just separate what I need for the pie and add a little vanilla for sweetness.

Made this for Thanksgiving with Puff Pastry crust and it was a big hit. Had extra ingredients, so I made mini tarts out of them -- because of the size, these were the opposite of the pie, primarily cranberry with a thin layer of apple on top. As great as the pie was, the mini tarts were almost better.

This pie was very well received! I did enjoy the tartness of the cranberries, and because you can just let the sauce cook as you peel and chop the apples, it really isn't that much work for that extra bonus. I might want to try a different recipe for pie crust with this; the butter pie crust worked very well for the pecan pie, and a prebaked one worked well with pumpkin, but the uncooked pie crust got a bit soggy on the bottom, despite the fact I let the cranberry ribbon cool off entirely. Secondly, and this is a matter of preference, next time I would change the recipe to precook the apples. Four pounds of uncooked apples is gigantic, but after they are done baking, they have shrunken far from the pie crust. Of course, this does require an extra fifteen or twenty minutes of stove time, and it was just fine without precooking.

Outstanding! Used cranberry juice cocktail instead to cut down on tartness. Also used the Flaky Pie Crust recipe from Bon Appetit June 2000. Cook pie on top of preheated pizza stone to ensure the crust gets fully cooked.

This pie is delicious! I used granny smith and braeburn apples. I forgot to dot the pie with butter. I did not think that the pie lacked anything in taste.It had just the right amount of sweet and tart. I would definately make it again.

This is easily my new favorite pie recipe. It was brimming with apples, which were offset perfectly by the tart cranberries and flaky crust. Try to find a dish that can hold all of the apples, because it would be a shame to leave any out. It might just be me, but I dont think half a tsp cinnamon is nearly enough for the apple mixture. I added about three tsp (plus a little vanilla) and it was fantastic. I've already decided to make this pie for Thanksgiving, and I know everyone will love it!

Excellent recipe for a tart fruit pie. I found the cranberries gave the apple pie a rhubarb-esque flavor. Beware: the filling is very high, so a deep- dish pan and patience when preparing the top crust are essential. I used sugar in the raw for the top crust sprinkle and it gave a great look and feel to the finished pie. I will experiment with trying different juices to flavor the cranberries (e.g., orange) in the future. Definitely a great fall/winter pie to add to the collection.

I thought I had used way too many apples, but the crust fell while it was cooking, so I probably could have thrown in a few more. Despite the dent this was delicious, it had a very subtle tartness. My boyfriend managed to eat all but two pieces in two days he liked it so much.

This is a good pie if you don't like super sweet desserts. The cranberry gave it a nice tartness. I forgot to dot the filling with butter, but it turned out fine. The cranberry mixture was enough to put a thin layer in two 9-inch pies. Didn't measure exactly how many apples I used, just cut up enough till it was full. Definitely a good pie to make if you want something a little different than the normal apple pie.

I made this for Thanksgiving, but it didn't go over as well as I'd hoped based on the rest of the ratings it received. My husband & family like sweet desserts, and this wasn't - and I forgot the ice cream - which made this a bit too tart for them. I will try making again, but maybe cut the Granny Smiths to 1/2 and using Braeburn for the other half, increasing the sugar in both the apple filling and cranberry filling, and to not forget the ice cream. The filling also ran a bit - more than any other apple pie I've made, and I was sure to cook the cranberry sauce to a thick jelly-like consistency. Maybe a slight increase in flour to the apple filling...?

This pie was a hit at our Thanksgiving Day festivities. It was easy to make and the crust recipe couldn't have been easier either. I did end up with too many apples to fill the crust though by following the recipe. I would say I left out about 1 entire apple.

I get rave reviews every time I make this pie. I use a bit less sugar than the recipe calls for, plus all Granny Smiths, for tartness.

This is a great apple pie recipe if you're looking for a twist on the traditional. I've made it several times, and the only thing I change is to eliminate the Golden Delicious apples and replace with a Braeburn, Jonagold or McIntosh. In my opinion, Delicious apples are much too soft for any baking. I also usually use the buttermilk pie crust recipe from this site - it's one of the best I've found and I've tried dozens.

This pie was just sweet enough, not with that overwhelming syrupy apple-pie taste. The tartness of the cranberries mixes into the sweet apple taste to make a pleasant combination of tastes. Everyone Loved it and thought that it was JUST right for a christmas or thanksgiving treat.

This was DELICIOUS! I'm sure it will be even better the next time I make it with the included crust recipe: I ran low on time and had to use the pre-made kind from the store (gasp!). I've never used a milk & sugar wash before (I usually do an egg/sugar wash), but I was so pleasantly surprised. The crust was perfectly and delicately crisp..again, a surprise especially considering it was the store bought pre-made crust. My new Thanksgiving pie staple!

I fussed with the recipe, using less sugar in the apples and the cranberries (also, I used sour cherry juice from TJ's and a few dried sour cherries in the cranberries), more cinamon and some nutmeg. The two apples together, sliced very thin, using a little extra flour well tossed were fantastic, perfectly cooked through and no slipping. I used my own crust formula and the pie heaped high was cookbook quality. Guests loved it.

Rating: 3
The crust is very crispy and buttery and the pie is very tasty. Be prepared that the cranberry makes it pretty tart despite all the sugar. Definitely needs to be eaten with ice cream. No problems with the filling spilling out if you wait the FULL 2 hours to cut into it. It is also probably important to cook the cranberry until all the liquid is absorbed, the cranberry should be the consistency of jam when you put it in the piecrust.

I've made this twice now and absolutely love it! My only wish is that I could find a way to make it a little less runny--some serious filling slide happens when I cut into it, even when it's sufficiently cooled, which makes the presentation sloppy. But despite that, this pie is absolutely wonderful!

I was looking for an apple pie recipe with a twist, and this was it!! I used my mother's dough recipe, cause it's the best, but this filling was delicious! Not only do the cranbberries give great flavour, they add a nice splash of colour. The only slight change I made, was using half of the cranberry reduction on the bottom, and pouring the rest over the apples, before finishing with the dough top. I really impressed my boyfriend and his family this Thanksgiving!

An excellent variation on an old standard -- I made two and they were gobbled up in no time (albeit by a rather large family). I would suggest adding some cornstarch to the apple mixture to prevent it from getting too runny, and carefully watch he cranberry ribbon sauce while it's cooking on the stove -- could burn easily!

I've already made this twice, Thanksgiving and Christmas! I didn't use a food processor for the crust, instead I used a pastry cutter. Recommend ensuring the butter is in very small, fine bits before wrapping up and placing in the refrigerator. Makes for a finer, flakier crust.

My daughter and I put this pie together last night. I used gala apples instead of the golden delicious because I like my pies a little more tart. I was able to find the 100% cranberry juice. This one is made by Ocean Spray, has no sugar added and is a white cranberry blend. Before eating a piece, I warmed it up in the microwave for 20 seconds or so and put a dollop of Cool Whip on top. It was sensational, just the right tartness and flavor! I would certainly make it again.

To answer your question concerning the cranberry juice Trader Joes has one called Just Cranberry. It is 100% cranberry juice. Not sure where you live but health food stores also carry 100% cranberry juice, it is just a little more expensive. Hope this helps.

This is a very good pie! The crust comes out perfectly (it rolls out with ease too). The combination of cranberries and apples is great. I used unsweetened cranberry juice because the apples this year are very sweet and the pie came out a little tangy, but that accentuated the home made vanilla ice cream perfectly! I added more cinnamon - just because I love it with apples - but it didn't raise any objections from my guests making me think that you can't really mess up this recipe.

This is a very good pie recipe and I will make it again for Thanksgiving. I forgot to dot the filling with 2 tablespoons of butter, and it still turned out great (why add more fat when you don't really need it?).
