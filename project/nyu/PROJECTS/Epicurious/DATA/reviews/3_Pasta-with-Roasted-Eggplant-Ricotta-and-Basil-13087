Really good, added a hot banana pepper and used canned whole Italian tomatoes instead of fresh. Delicious and highly reccomended for an easy, tasty meal.

I'm usually at a loss with eggplant, and I found this dish a nice way to prepare it. The eggplant blends nicely into the sauce and overall the dish is pretty healthy. I way upped the garlic and basil because I'm fans of both and I probably added more ricotta (didn't measure). I think the key with dishes like this is to get nice fresh ingredients and revel in the actual vegetable-y taste of it. If you're looking for the oversatured flavor of Olive Garden-esque Italian then you probably won't like this, but if you're looking for a good way to use up fresh veggies and eat fairly healthy then I think it's a good recipe.

not the flavor points I like, I added some lemon juice to cut the sweetness and next time will add some toasted pine nuts.

This was delicious and definitely a keeper. Perfect "summer harvest" pasta dish.

I have made this recipe many times. Adding hot or sweet italian sausae really spices it up and makes it delicious. Also extra garlic, a little more ricotta and a splash more balsamic! Yum!

As everyone stated, this sauce was pretty bland, so I added 5 more cloves of garlic, some tomato paste, a 1/2 cup of boiled chopped basil, some italian seasoning and more olive oil. Much more flavor! Added the balsamic vinegar on the pasta right before serving. The ricotta was a welcome taste with the pasta after all the additional ingredients. My guy liked it and had seconds, although I am not sure if I will make it again.

I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh, for flavor & texture. Also added some wine at that step. I finished with capers, a little extra ricotta and some toasted pine nuts. Golden raisins would have been good too. My 3 1/2 year-old and 15 month-old sons liked it, which in my mind makes a success!

The recipe took way too long to prepare and it was marginal at best. Very disappointing.

A wonderful pasta dish with plenty of vegetables. I would definitely add more garlic to the mix, but altogether this was tasty, satisfying, and not difficult to make.

this is a great mid-week dish. In addition to using what the recipe called for, we added about 6 more cloves of garlic. Also browned a pound of ground lamb and added that as well. A great one-dish meal/

Definitely a keeper; although it does need a little more spice for some "zip". I added a little more ricotta and some sliced black olives.

This is a strong 3 forks. We enjoyed very much. It is something different to do with eggplant. I too did some improvising based on what I had on hand. I added on hot banana pepper as others suggested it needs a little spicing up. Also, I used cottage cheese in the food processor for the ricotta. This one is a keeper!

This is a great weeknight supper! For how little work it takes it's surprisingly delicious. I used whole-wheat spaghetti (all I had on hand) and the sauce worked just as well as it would for a rotelle or ziti. Since all of the ingredients are fairly standard, I'm certain I'll make this again.

We thought this dish was okay. The original reviewer hit the nail on the head- something is lacking. I even used baby eggplant as well as fresh basil and tomatoes from the garden. Maybe the problem is due to a combination of all the flavors. Nothing really stands out as being dominant over the others.

Very good recipe. Based on previous reviews, I added more garlic, used fresh basil leaves, and added approx. 1 T of fresh salsa (both chipolte and jalapeno). Add 4 oz. of goat cheese to make a very creamy and delicious sauce.

This is a great staple for a cook to have in their repertoire. It is satisfying, comforting food with simple ingredients that should please even the most finicky of eaters. Not every dish of the week can have you gloating about the kitchen but this one might.

I substituted goat cheese for the ricotta, added some thyme, and used a few extra tomatoes from my garden. It was a huge hit - especially topped with chopped black olives.

tasty, but nothing extraordinary. I used roasted red peppers and canned, seasoned diced tomatoes for a little extra flavor.

We substituted soft goat cheese for ricotta and added cayene pepper and more garlic. Delicious!

Agreed with Mike. I added capers and some sauted halepenos. Still came out rather bland, although eggplant can always absorb a lot of seasoning. Will also continue to play with it.

I thought it was a little too sweet/cloying because of the basil and basalmic vinegar combination. My husband loved it, though. I'd let the eggplant sit in the oven for at least half an hour to soften more and increase the garlic.

This dish is one of the best I've ever tasted. It is tangy and delicious, and healthy too! I used basil right out of the garden and I think that is the secret! Mmmmmmm!

Making note of Mike's comment, I increased the garlic from 2 to 6 cloves. I also finely chopped a couple of garlic cloves which I added to the olive oil used to toss the diced eggplant before roasting. After I spread the eggplant on the cookie sheet, I sprinkled a little cayenne pepper and also some of Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Cajun Vegetable Magic. My husband & I thought the dish was outstanding and I plan to prepare it again soon!

I think it is a good basic and easy dish, but it lacked flavor. I added some red pepper flakes, but I think it still needs something else, though I can't put my finger on it at the moment. I will experiment with it again.
