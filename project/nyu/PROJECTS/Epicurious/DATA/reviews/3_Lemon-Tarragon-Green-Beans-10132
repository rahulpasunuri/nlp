I love these green beans and make them alot. Instead of tossing in a bowl, I like to reduce the blanching time just a bit; while the green beans drain, start some some shallots in a skillet with you xvoo, and toss your green beans in to finsh. Remove from heat, sprinkle on lemon juice, season with fresh cracked pepper and sea salt. Toasted pine nuts are a nice touch too, especially for more festive occasions. I use French beans for this (hubby likes the gentler flavor/texture), but Blue Lakes are great too.

This is a bright, tasty side dish. We enjoyed it with fish and the Moroccan carrot slaw from this site.

I just made this again today with freshly picked yellow beans and tarragon from our garden. It's quick and easy to make and both my husband and I like this dish. Perhaps the previous reviewer didn't have really fresh, tender beans.

With the addition of olive oil, lemon juice, & tarragon the flavor is one step above plain green beans. Nothing special, fine for a week night.
