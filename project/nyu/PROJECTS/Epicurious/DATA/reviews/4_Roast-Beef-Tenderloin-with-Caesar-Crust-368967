Made for Christmas dinner. It was fabulous. Made on a 7 pound tenderloin. Grossed up the recipe ingredients to make more crust. Cooked for about 75 minutes for medium or 145 degrees per recipes but that was too long. 5 min less or 140 degrees would have been better with a rest. Some crust fell off when slicing but we just scooped it up. Very tasty.

Made this twice using a boneless rib roast and it was a hit both times-increased the amount of crust for the larger sized roast. A little of the crust fell off but everyone was happy to grab the bits off of the platter!

After deciding to make this for guests one evening, I read the reviews and decided that I couldn't have the crust falling off. So, after packing the mixture around the tenderloin I covered the top and sides with 4-5 strips of bacon and used toothpicks to secure them in place. When I sliced it to serve, I sliced between the bacon strips and it was PERFECT! I would definitely make it again!

Excellent! I substituted Panko for the fresh breadcrumbs and that worked well. The only drawback is the cost for this cut of meat but in the end, well worth it!

Amazing recipe. Excellent flavor, fool-proof, and beautiful presentation. Flavor of the meat is beautifully enhanced by the Caesar crust flavors. Absolute keeper!

This recipe is excellent, it's a keeper and don't change a thing! We had it for Christmas dinner as will. I read the comments regarding the crust; I think the problem is that you can't slice this thinly like a roast beef, you need to cut it into serving size steaks. Yes some crust will fall off, just be careful and use a sharp carving knife.

Made a few modifications. Skipped the anchovies and added a little olive oil to bind ingredients together. Also made individual filets and coated each one with crumbs on top and sides only, baked them at 400 for about 10 minutes for perfect medium finish with all crumbs in tact. Perfect presentation. Only tasted ok. Awkward flavors on the meat. Prefer filet with caesar salad on the side!

The flavor was great but the crust ended up being mushy (and I cooked it more medium than rare so it's not that it wasn't cooked long enough). The crust was all falling off the bottom when putting it on a rack like the directions said so I put it directly in the pan.

This was excellent! Everyone loved it. The flavor was a great addition to the beef. The beef was super tender and was great the next day too! The crust did not really fall off badly on my roast. I just used a flat metal rack in the bottom of a baking sheet pan. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe! My sister made it for Christmas Eve using a 6 1/2 lb. beef tenderloin and adding a few tablespoons of lemon juice to amp up the acidity whch she found lacking. Everything else was done as written. It was some of the best beef tenderloin I have ever tasted. There was not a single bit of leftovers. I am making again for a New Years Eve party although I may switch to pork tenderloins to save a few dollars.

I made it for Christmas dinner yesterday, too, and thought it was fabulous! Excellent flavor and easy to do. Just be careful handling the final slicing so the crust doesn't fall off. The crust is so good I might try it on fish or chicken....

Made this yesterday for Xmas Dinner. It received raved reviews. After leaving beef uncovered for the 2 hours, I prepared the dressing and after applying it to tenderloin I placed in fridge for 2 hours before cooking it. My crust did not fall off and I do not know if refrigerator part helped that. This is a keeper

Made this for dinner party tonight. Although it was delicious and all guest enjoyed it, the bread crumb crust did not stay on the meat. It started failing off before I even tried to carve it. Any recommendations?

Delicious!!!! Only thing I didn't do was salt overnight - just did it during the 2 hour room temperature part of the directions. The topping was incredible. Making this for Christmas dinner for sure!

This is a perfect and delicious recipe for a party. I love that you don't have to brown the meat first. It's so easy and I'll make it again and again.
