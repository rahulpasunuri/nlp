I'm surprised by the poor reviews, though I agree I'd use about 1/2 lb each of the mozzarella and pasta (if you like saucy pasta) plus more celery than is called for. Otherwise, this was delicious, even without the cherry pepper (I doubled the crushed red pepper though could have used even more) and even though I used canned San Marzano tomatoes (I recommend this brand) for the blended half of the sauce. My boyfriend tried to eat the sauce by itself like gazpacho--I had to wrestle it away from him. The celery adds a great flavor while keeping the whole dish very light. I was very pleasantly surprised!!

The recipe was easy enough to make. It was a little bland though. I would add some fresh herbs like basil or oregano. I used a hungarian hot pepper because it was what I had in the fridge, but it needed more spice. It was easy to make and at room temperature, was refreshing on a 90 degree night. I also thought 1 pound of pasta was too much. Some proteins like shrimp or chicken would make this more hearty.

How many directions does the cook from NO need? Between the ingredients list and the directions, every ingredient was accounted for in the preparation and used in the dish. There is nothing wrong with brief directions when it covers the information needed.

I probably won't try this b/c the directions are inadequate...

This is a nice, basic recipe but definitely needs some punch to earn more forks. I'd add 1-2 cloves of garlic, minced, and 1/4 cup or so of chopped, fresh basil. Cut back the mozzarella by half, add a sprinkle of salt and black pepper. I like that this is all fresh and warmed up by tossing with the hot pasta.

I Didn't try this yet... but any suggestions about adding some type of protein (meat or poultry)??

While the spiciness was just right once the bell pepper was added, the whole pound of cheese was a deal killer, making the dish incredibly heavy. Using chopped mozzarella is good with this set of flavours and textures, but I would have used half that amount at the very most. I would advise to stick with a regular arrabiata, or omit the cheese from this recipe.

We thought this was definitely just 'ok'. If we doctored it up a lot more (added fresh garlic to the puree maybe) it would have been a lot better. As it was it was just sort of 'blah' and needed a lot of work to get it to 'delicious'. I may take the foundation of the recipe and build on it.
