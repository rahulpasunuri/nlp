Really had to give four stars to offset the idiot who gave one star because he changed the recipe drastically. Why do idiots review a recipe unfavorably when they haven't MADE the recipe. If one experiments in the kitchen why not keep one's idiocy private and not confirm one's culinary idiocy.

This recipe is easy and fabulous. I have made it several times and always received rave reviews. The only change I made was to add bok choy while omitting the celery. I tried to make it with beef one time but the flavors over powered the beef, I would suggest to only use lamb.

Quick and easy, but nothing special.

Delicious! I substituted snow peas for the watercress. Kids loved it and it's perfect for a weeknight meal...

this dish was quite good and easy to prepare. good compliments of sweet and spice in the sauce. As far as the tofu issue, I don't eat tofu, but do think the flavor of the lamb adds a lot to this dish, that tofu simply wouldn't

I used left-over grilled leg of lamb, 3/4 lb., so I added the cornstarch to the sauce and reheated the lamb for 2 - 3 minutes instead of cooking it. We added 6 green onions at 1/2 inch slices and frozen, thawed fresh soybeans, 1/2 cup after 1 min. of cooking the celery. Yum! My son really liked it too and my daughter ate it.

Very tasty! I disagree with the previous review although tofu would make this recipe a little bland. The stronger taste of lamb was wonderful with the mild flavor of mushrooms and eggplant. I've made this twice and my husband keeps requesting it again.

Admittedly, I changed this recipe drastically by substituting tofu for the lamb, but the results were just sort of lackluster. I doubt I'll be trying this one again with meat or tofu.
