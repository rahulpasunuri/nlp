Baked and oiled, the mix was too wet, though for some uses (e.g. bruchetta) that might be a plus. For those familiar with roasting and peeling peppers for, say, Mexican or other cuisines, don't bake them. Roast and peel instead. The skins aren't bad, but a bit tough and don't add much.

I didn't use the 6 tbsp of oil to coat the peppers before baking. The peppers were easy to peel but you have to let them get nice and dark in the oven. They take a little time to peeel, but the end result is worth it. Very tasty.

I loved this recipe and do it all the time! Definitely served as a bruschetta is the best. maria

This was delicious--definitely better served as a brushetta. I agree with the other reviewers that roasting the peppers without oil and bagging are the way to go. Try adding some fresh garlic (rub on toasted bread if making as brushetta).

This was very simple and good. Definately save all the pepper juices that accumulate while the peppers are cooling and add them to the dressing. It adds a nice sweetness and mellows the balsamic

The first time I made this was for a couple of Europeans of Slavic descent. My friend almost thought he was eating his mother's home cooking, and the pine nuts just added a novel twist to the delicacy. I'm getting ready to make it for him again.

MMM Good! Try this with garlic salt and fresh garlic as well.

This is much easier to make than the recipe suggests. I agree with other reviews, just broil and bag the peppers. It takes a lot less time and is much easier. I served this as an accompaniment/topping for somecrusty italian bread or toasted pita triangles with dinner. The balsamic vinegar gives it a great flavour. I have already made this a few times.

Either I missed something or others did. Peeling the pepper is OPTIONAL. I followed the recipe and found it to be easy, colorful and VERY flavorful. I did not peel the peppers. I felt the roasted skins would add flavor which they did.I sliced the peppers, tossed them with the vinegar (no additional oil) and served them warm/room temp. For 2 of us I cut the recipe down to 1 small pepper of each color and there weren't any leftovers. Don't skip the toasted pine nuts. Like a previous reviewer suggested the sliced (or even chopped) peppers would be great as bruschetta. With this method of roasting and not peeling this would be an excellent buffet or dinner accompaniment for a crowd.

I agree, it is much easier and a time saver to broil and bag the peppers. I have tried many variations of this recipe over the years, and you can try different spices to season the pepper marinade, such as fresh oregano, basil, and/or garlic. I have also tried a stovetop method using peppers and onions sauteed for about 5 min. in olive oil. You add balsamic, salt, pepper, and basil afterward. Excellent!

Delicious! & visually attractive complement to a plain grilled meat & salad dinner. I sprinkled crumbled feta & julienned fresh basil over the top, just before serving. This dish will appear on future dinner party buffets, in all seasons.

prepare this like the cook from Westchester, PA and it becomes a great appetizer served with a toasted baguette!

Sorry, I think the best way is to broil the peppers whole and place in a plastic bag for 15 Mins. Then carefully peel the peppers and I think the most inportant part is to save the juices from the pepper, never rinse the pepper,add Balsamic, O.O. salt& Pepper.Let sit at room Temp.

I agree with the review from Cynthia/Dallas re: broiling to blacken; an additional note: I have grilled/broiled peppers both with and without olive oil; they blacken better and peel more easily WITHOUT oiling them first. Add olive oil for flavor after they are "paper bagged", peeled and sliced, not before.

If you broil the peppers under high broil until blackened, place in plastic bag for 10 minutes and then peel, you save a lot of time. Also, try adding capers...yum!

Although I altered this recipe a bit to fit my needs, it still made very good roasted peppers. I omitted the pine nuts and the vinegar, and added extra olive oil and garlic. I also used only green and red peppers. Very good, and very easy! When I can't grill in the winter time, this is much less time consuming than charring the peppers one by one on my stove top.
