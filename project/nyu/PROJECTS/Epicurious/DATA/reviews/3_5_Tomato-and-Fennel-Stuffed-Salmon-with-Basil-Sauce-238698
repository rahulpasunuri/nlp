Excellent. This recipe is now part of our Seven Fish Dinner.

Easy to prep ahead and then pop in the oven. And it's an amazing presentation. Next time I make it I won't bother with the blender for the sauce. It's easy enough to chop the herbs and garlic and mix with the rest of the ingredients.

Breathtakingly good. The first time we roasted the whole fish as part of a 7 course dinner for 20 (small servings) and everyone loved it. But it took longer to cook than the recipe indicates about about 1o-15 minutes. The second time, we used split salmon steaks and butterflied them, put in the stuffing AND the basil sauce, wrapped then in parchment as individual servings, and voila! Delicious. And it took about 12 minutes to cook.

Perfect for a crowd. Presentation was stunning and thanks to the fish monger for doing the dirty work. It was a nice change from poached salmon with dill sauce and canned tomatoes substituted well for fresh in the off season.

This was NOT a lot of work, and I was pleased with the outcome. The fennel, tomatoes and herbes de Provence were nice against the rich salmon (wild sockeye), although I wasn't impressed with the sauce, I'd try another one next time. This is definitely a keeper.

For the amount of work this involved and the ingredients used, I thought this would be better. It was good but not fantastic. the mayonnaise overpowered the sauce and the taste of the tomatoes and fennel didn't come through.
