I would not make this again. It was OK, but not terrific. A palette freshener should have vibrant flavor. This fell short.

I love making savory versions of typically sweet dishes, but the gazpachy sorbet was pretty foul. Perhaps a single bite as a palate cleanser, but certainly not multiple bites. The apple aspic was actually quite tasty. I'd make it again for my toddler aged nephew as a jello type dessert. Recipe generally not for eating.

very cool recipe. I followed the advice below and added 1/3 cup of vodka and about 2 tablespoons of sherry. The sorbet came out the right consistency (I like it icy versus creamy - so I did not use egg whites). Also i used pear auger (vegetarian)instead of gelatin for the apple squares and these came out fine - used the same amount as one would use for gelatin.

Truly amazing with a real wow factor! A sensual delight for the palate and the eyes, and well worth the time/trouble this recipe requires. Following others advice/comments, I added 2/3 cup vodka to the sorbet with much success - after freezing for 5-1/2 hours it was just the right consistency. I also simmered the aspic with a cut-up apple to increase flavour however, the natural pectin in the apple also likely aided the aspic in firming/setting-up properly. This has so much eye appeal and tastes as good as it looks! Elegant and sophisticated, this is sure to impress even the most critical dinner guest!

Outstanding flavor and concept, but troublesome on texture as others have said. I used an extra tablespoon of alcohol (Dutch gin) to no avail--sorbet was still rock hard and I worked my fanny off moving it from the fridge to the freezer and back again to get a perfect serving temp. Eggwhite makes a slippery sorbet so would avoid that. But even with those problems, I loved the flavor. Oh, and a minor improvement? Pinot gris made a perfect wine accompaniament to the dish, and the addition of a tablespoon or two to the apple gelatin mix created a seamless pairing of food and wine.

AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS-I decided to add one egg white to the ice cream machine at the end,I always do for all my sorbet recipes, it makes it very smooth also it doesn`t freeze solid. Very special recipe- will make it again and again.

I liked this a lot and my dinner comapanions were totally impressed by it. I am not sure I would include the olive oil the next time I make it. It is very light and refreshing and makes a lovely impression on the plate. I had no problem with the aspic but I did boil the apple juice with a cut up Granny Smith apple to get a bit more flavor.

Although I have not made this, I have been served this delicious and elegant appetizer. Very impressive and a treat for the eyes and the palate. Suggestion: to prevent the sorbet from freezing into a solid block as previous reviewer stated, add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of vodka to the mix when it comes out of the ice cream maker and before putting in the freezer. The alcohol prevents the sorbet from freezing solid and adds a bit of a surprising kick to an already great appetizer.

This was wonderful. Next time I would use more gelatin, as the aspic did not hold its shape as well as I'd wished. And I would have put the gazpacho in the icecream maker just before I needed it. I made it early and it froze into a block of ice which I needed to microwave to serve. Still, it wowed everyone - a bit hit.
