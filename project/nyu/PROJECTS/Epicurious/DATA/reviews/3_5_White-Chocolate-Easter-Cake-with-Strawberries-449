This cake is absolutely delicious. I made it for a friend's birthday, and it was a huge hit with everyone. It's decadent without being overly sugary. It was quite labor intensive, but well worth it. I used just one, rather than two, layers of strawberry-buttercream in the middle. I found it impossible to keep the strawberries from sliding off the cake for a second layer. I just did buttercream-strawberry-buttercream between the cakes. I also have pistachio extract, and used just a bit of this along with the vanilla.

This is the most time intensive cake I've ever made...and it is worth every second. It is also the best cake I have ever eaten that doesn't have dark chocolate in it. Totally worth it.

This cake is an absolute hit with my guests whenever I make it. The recipe is very time consuming, but to me the end result is totally worth it. I'm very surprised to read that a lot of people don't find it that tasty. I think it's scrummy!

Wish I'd seen the latest review before I made this - it sounded great, and tasted okay. Two problems - after setting the strawberries in the buttercream on the first layer, cake needed to be chilled again, or the top layer just pushed everything out the side. Then, I followed the recipe, and completed it a few hours before we were going to eat it after our Easter dinner. Unfortunately, all the whip cream had slid off the sides, and was sitting around the base. The cake was good, but not spectacular, and not an interesting enough flavour to do again.

Given that I have made this cake innumerable times, both professionally and for family events, I am shocked at the negative comments I've seen on this site. This is one of my top 5 favorite desserts, and even though it requires a great deal of labor - it is worth it! Make this cake when strawberries are locally fresh for best results, and don't pipe the cream until just before serving or pipe onto individual slices once plated.

Although this cake tasted ok, I would not make it again. It involves a lot of work and we did not find the finished product to be that terrific. A little too dry, and you could barely taste the chocolate. The marzipan, strawberries and butter cream were very good, but the cake itself left much to be desired.

The cake is delicious. I did not find the pistachios overwhelming at all, but they were very difficult to find in my neck of the woods. Fortunately I had business in a larger city at the time I was planning to make the cake and found the unsalted nuts there. It would be helpful if substitutions for hard to find ingredients were listed in the recipes. The marsipan is a nice touch and I wouldn't leave it out. I dipped the strawberries for the top in white and milk chocolate to make the cake a little more festive. It was a big hit with the family and guests. Do plan to make in stages! I can't imagine doing it in one day. *I want to add an addendum. I made this cake again yesterday and found a way around searching for the unsalted pistachio nuts. I thorougly rinsed salted nuts, let them drain for a few minutes and then placed them in the oven at 200 degrees to dry them out. Worked beautifully. This time I didn't dip the strawberries, but drizzled a chocolate glaze over the berries and side of the cake. Very dramatic presentation.

This cake was a big hit at many family get-togethers. It is a bit time consuming, so it pays to read through the recipe carefully before starting to prepare the cake. Definitely start with the frosting. We skipped the marzipan topping the first time and continued to make the cake without it and it turned out great.

This was a delicious recipe, but it takes a long time. Make the icing ahead of time. The final product doesn't look too good, but it tastes great. It tastes much better cold.

Thought the cake was very good but for the amount of work that went into it, it wasn't rewarding enough. I would double the layers of strawberries if I were making it again. All in all, delicious, but too many steps, and the taste was not to "die for".

I have made this cake several times, and it is a nice blend of flavors. Personally, I think it has a little too much pistachio, which covers some of the white chocolate flavor. BUT, my husband absolutely loves it. It is also beautiful and easy to make (in stages, anyway).

I've made it several times and everybody loves it. Give yourself plenty of time. Make extra pistachio buttercream icing.

This cake was wonderful. But very difficult, something novice cooks should not attempt. If prepared correctly it will have the consistancy of a cake (mine did). I could not find unsalted pistachios so I substituted walnuts instead, and it worked perfectly. I did find the whipped cream amount was not enough to frost the entire cake, I doubled it. All in all this was a great cake!

This was a lot of work for only a "so-so" cake. You really have to LOVE pistachios to even bother to make this. Also, it looked kind of odd when cut - the cake was green. There are many better desserts out there

Delicious torte if someone is looking for the consistency of cake they may be disappointed. This is a wonderful brunch dessert. I also served this cake warm with a dollop of the butter cream, whipped cream and fresh strawberries minus the marzipan.

The cake was wonderful. The marzipan was impossible to find. We substituted with almond paste. It was a little over whelming. It was not too hard once some timing was established. At first it seemed a little daunting. Overall it was delicious. My husband feels that the marzipan/almond paste is unecessary for future adventures.
