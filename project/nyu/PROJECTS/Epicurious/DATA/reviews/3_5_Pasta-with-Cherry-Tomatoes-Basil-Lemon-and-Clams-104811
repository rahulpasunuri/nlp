oops - also I added crushed red pepper flakes to the olive oil/garlic combo! Forgot to say that. It added a perfect little kick. :)

Excellent! Everyone loved it. I did not use clams at all, but instead added a few splashes of white wine to the pasta along with the lemon juice before adding the sauce. I only cooked the tomatoes for 2 or 3 minutes, and also I did not add the cheese until the pasta was served, and we sprinkled it on top. Will definitely make again; very fresh and delicious!

My kids and I adored this! I zested the lemon and added some white wine to the garlic. I only needed about half of the clam juice and it was pretty brothy already. I'm a huge fan of tomatoes, but I wasn't sure how important they'd be to this dish. ADD them - they add a great punch of flavor. EXCELLENT!

Loved this. I too added a bit of red pepper flakes, and added lemon and some clam juice to the sauce before adding to pasta. Then, added more lemon and clam juice to the pasta. Canned clams work great for a quick dinner.

This was very good, with the little grape tomatoes it was light and fresh. After a hectic day this was so quick to make, I can't wait to make this again.

Surprisingly good! I didn't bother with the clams...added some red pepper and broccoli when I sauteed the garlic, zest and juice of 1 lemon and a little clam juice at the end to enhance flavor. A hit at my house!

Very easy and delicious. I felt like a gourmet chef after I had my first taste! I love lemon, but I would agree that less lemon is better in this dish. I think the tomatoes added a 'tartness' to the dish. I also added a bit too much cheese, would like to use less next time. I used double the recommended garlic, as I do with all dishes, and turned out fine. Surprisingly, I didn't use nearly as much of the clam juice than I expected. I need just one more attempt to perfect it to my tastes, but in general, this was a great dish!

What's not to love! Very simple and delicious. Used fresh clams that we cooked on the grilled until they opened. Removed them from their shells and tossed with the pasta just before serving.

3.5 Stars - this dish was really good. I made a few modification - doubled the garlic and used arugela instead of basil. My first attempt at "white clam sauce" I was very pleased

I have made this recipe about a dozen times. It is the perfect summer dish, light and full of flavor. I agree that you don't need to add the cheese to the sauce, but offer it to put on top. Can't wait to make it again!

This is a fine recipe, and each time I have made much the same modifications as other reviewers -- less lemon, less cooking of the tomatoes (shorter cooking time of the sauce overall), and serving the cheese on the side. This time I added a little fresh ginger with the garlic. We keep scrubbed and frozen chowder clams (very large) on hand. The clams crack open as they thaw, and all you have to do is shuck out the meat into a colander over a bowl, to separate from the juice. Then cut them up and use as you would canned clams. Not only does this keep clams fresh to pull out and use them, but also eliminates the task of opening them.

second review as I turned this in to a pasta salad this week. Left the tomatoes whole to give it more texture. Did not mix cheese in to sauce, added after sauce had been added to cold pasta. Brought leftovers to room temperature. Delicious and unusual.

Rating: 3
This is my second review cause this time I cooked the tomatoes for just a minute or two, skipped the cheese and added the pasta (linguine) to the clam mixture. Think it was better so that's the new routine for this one.

This should be a 100% will make it again recipe! I usually give dishes that are good- as in they become staples- but some how don't warrant the ultimate 4 rating which is reserved for the heart stopping dish yet to be sampled....but this one is so simple, so tasty and soooo versatile! give it a try!

Rating: 3
Great super-fast recipe! I used 1/2 and 1/2 parsely and basil (not enough basil), two cans of clams but didn't drain them, and a big slosh of white wine (I like a wet pasta). I also didn't add the cheese (makes a big sticky mess) but served the pasta with loads of cheese and a big squeeze of lemon on top (I like lemon). Awsome dinner!

I wish I read the review prior to attempting this recipe. Use less lemon!!!!! I liked it, did not love it. I do not know if I would make it again. I love to cook and would rather use my spare time experimenting with another recipe.

Rating: 3
I agree with Julie from Houston- less lemon! This is very similar to arecipe from Jane Brody, I included a diced onion with the garlic and a little wine. Also, I added the tomatoes at the very end. Very easy week night dinner, my family loves this dish with a big salad and some corn ont he cob. 2 cans of clams worked fine for 4 servings, tho no leftovers.

A standard in this household, especially for last-minute guests. The only thing I would change is: add the pasta to the sauce, not the other way around. Every time I've added the sauce into a pound of pasta, it's been too dry. (You could, as the recipe suggests, always add clam juice to keep it from being dry, but I find it results in a dilution of flavor. If you are wondering whether you'll have enough, double the clam sauce recipe and save the extra for another night.) Try with the soppressata and grapefruit salad (Bon Appetit April 2001 - also on epicurious).

Quick, easy and delicious! I made this dish for dinner; it made so much we invited our neighbors over and still had leftovers the next day. My friend liked it so much I gave her the recipe.

Rating: 3
YUM! I used a mixture of whole baby clams and chopped clams. Also, I thought that the amount of lemon juice called for might be too much so I added less lemon juice, substituted some lemon zest, and used more clam juice. Next time I would eliminate the cheese while cooking and sprinkle a bit on each serving. I agree with the reader who wrote that this is even better the next day. I've been eating this dish for three days now!

As the rating states, I liked this dish but did not love it. There are so many better recipes out there, and I guess I'm spoiled because I prefer fresh/in the shell clams. It was edible though.

Rating: 3
Very, very good. My whole family (tots included) loved it. I agree with other reviews--cook tomatoes less (I cooked mine for the 5 minutes called for and the tomatoes vanished, leaving only their skins behind)...also agree that 2 cans of clams is plenty. Tasty all in all. A keeper!

This is my favorite pasta dish, especially in the summer when my father's cherry tomatoes are abundant. My boyfriend, who hates any kind of pasta (or used to!) loves this recipe!! I always add lots and lots of garlic-- you can't have too much!

Rating: 4
This recipe is easy to make, can be prepped well in advance and was eaten by teens who "hate tomatoes and hate clams"! To double recipe use 2.5 times everything except pasta. I agree with less cook time for tomatoes. Used whole tomatoes chopped to get colors not available in cherry tomatoes that day.

Easy, fancy& delicious. Use more garlic and don't cook the tomatoes as long as they say. MAybe only 2 cans of clams as well.

Very good recipe and I used the "forbidden cheese" contrary to a previous reviewer. I doubled the garlic as this is my only vice will make this recipe again.

This was very easy and delicious! By mistake,I only bought one can of clams so I added 3 sliced salmon saugages and used bottled clam juice. The flavour was exceptional!

I thought this was pretty great. I used linguine rather than the thin pasta suggested. It really tasted wonderful. Tangy but tamed with the parmesean. I think next time I will used minced clams or even clams in the shell would be good to dress it up for company. Very simple and satisfying.

I liked this dish but I tend to agree with RikRakRoo that the cheese did not work that well in the dish. I found that when I added the cheese, the sauce became quite gummy. It tasted good but the texture was not good, so I will try it next time without the cheese.

Rating: 3
This was really good. I used lobster instead of the clams and used some of the pasta's cooking water in place of the clam juice. To Bill: I believe the addition of the clam juice is supposed to be added in 1/4 cup increments only if your pasta is dry after adding the cheese.

I dice and freeze fresh summer tomatoes every fall and that is what I used for this recipie. I thought this was Very good and very easy. A great mid-week dinner. My meat and potatoes husband really like it too. Try and find good quality canned clams. I got mine at Whole Foods.

We love this recipe. It was both simple and delicious. Also, try substituting fresh cilantro (instead of basil). Incredible!

Cheese and fish (or shellfish) never go together. This recipe is good, especially if made with sweet vine ripened cherry tomatoes. I make it with angel hair pasta.....& lots of garlic. Cheese is one of my favorite foods, however, as Italians know, this is an occasion when putting cheese on top or in the dish is inappropriate. Top with the fresh basil......hold the cheese please for maximum flavor. Oh course fresh clams or mussels & fresh clam juice would be excellent!

My hubbie & I really enjoyed this pasta recipe. However, I didn't measure any ingredients and used just the one tomato that I had at home. I splashed a little cream in there too along with the parmesan cheese. Very yummy!

To Bill: I believe the instructions should say the clam "mixture", rather than sauce. Add the previously mentioned mixture of clams, galic, tomatoes, basil, etc.

I found this dish surprisingly bland. Using canned clams probably didn't help, but even the tomatoes were lifeless. Perhaps adding some white wine would help, but this wasn't even worth taking the time to tinker with.

This was excellent; I made it with penne pasta. Got rave reviews! However, somehow the clams and cheese bonded into small dumplings. What could have caused this? Was it using a shaped pasta rather than the spaghettini?

Very easy. A simple, light pasta dish. I loved the subtle lemon taste. I made this recipe with the parmesan cheese you shake out of a can. I imagine it's great when it's freshly shaved.

This recipie worked out very well, however next time I will use langostino or lobster instead of clams. The fresh lemon juice really compliments all of the ingredients and it all comes together nicely. I added a little sea salt to give it a kick. Overall a good salad..
