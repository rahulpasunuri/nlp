I also got the blue curacao--and despite the wierd color it was lapped up by my guests and they wanted more! Expensive to make, but a keeper to make. Was great!

Oh man this was bad. I missed a few steps and it was just a mess. If it didn't take insane amounts of expensive alcohol to make, I MIGHT try it again...but I seriously think this recipe is a total loss.

I made this punch for Easter Brunch. We made the mistake of getting blue Curacao...apparently it comes clear as well. The color of the punch looked like a cross between ice tea and coke. It was not attractive at all. The taste was ok but would try another punch before this one.

Since when does champagne come in quarts!? Try 3 75 cl bottles and halving the other amounts. This fills a 5-quart (5-litre) punch bowl. Very potent but delicious-- less sweet than the (also excellent) Champagne Punch on this site.
