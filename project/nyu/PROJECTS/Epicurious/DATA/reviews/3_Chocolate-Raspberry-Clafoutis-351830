I do this with 12oz of any fruit, no cocoa powder, with or without chocolate chips to great acclaim. Last night it was thawed/ drained peaches and blue berries I froze last summer-- wonderful! Also, brown sugar is great but not necessary and a whisk works just fine in place of a blender...

Delicious and easy. Not too pretty to serve tough, somehow seems lacking visually. Perhaps a fresh raspberry garnish? Or dollop of cream? Will make this again for sure.

I made this with the addition of vanilla and the deletion of any chocolate and it was perfect! I used 16oz/ a package of frozen fruit and brought it to a friend's house-- not a scrap remains!

So simple and so completely amazing. This is probably the best chocolate dessert I've ever had.

This is a wonderfully simple yet elegant dessert that my whole family loves. It takes less than ten minues to put together. It's excellent with fresh or frozen berries of any type, except maybe strawberries. For some reason, we didn't love the strawberries. Also great with cherries. I follow the recipe exactly, and it works perfectly.

Yes, it is essential to use really good chocolate. Mine turned out delicious even though I used gluten-free flour(fine-milled rice flour). The only thing I would change is to whisk my dry ingredients first in a small bowl so that they blend more easily in the blender. Easy and trouble free.

Wonderfully easy, very tasty recipe that could be turned into all sorts of great variations.

I substituted fresh cherries in this recipe, which I thought complimented the chocolate well, but I found the overall result bland. The chocolate chunks on top were good with the fruit, but the filling didn't have much flavor at all. Maybe if there was more cocoa powder in the filling?

About to make this for a second time... I also followed the recipe exactly, but took it out of the oven when I could tell it was firm but still moist. I served with creme fraiche, and it was very well received by guests. I will add that I am sure one of the secrets of this recipe is to use excellent chocolate. I used Valrhona cocoa powder and a really good bar of dark chocolate. I have just returned from Paris and am trying an 1848 dark bar this time as it's one of my favorites.

I do agree with kershel! Great as it is ... you could have had more cherry's or something.I enjoyed the moisture but not enough to get four forks. But there still possibility's i will make it again!

It was delicious. I know it says to bake it for 35 minutes, but I actually had to bake it for 45 minutes. It says to make sur it is firm to the touch, mine wasn't after 35 minutes, I then did 40, still not firm, but at 45 is was. Everyone really enjoyed it. Easy and will be making it again.

I love clafoutis, raspberries, and chocolate, so I figured this could not be bad... but it was very disappointing. A poor use for 12 oz of lovely berries.

Please disregard this advice to add more flour...I make a huge mistake and added and extra 1/4 c flour and this made it hard and rubbery....It is meant to be custard/cake consistency!!!

you may want to check the flour. Prepared as stated, it yielded a liquid goo. Suggest 2/3 cups to start

Love this recipe. Very easy to make, just go down the list of ingredients into the blender and pour into your dish. I used a pie dish as well and it works out perfectly. Side note: I used light brown sugar by accident the second time I made it and it didn't affect the recipe. Everyone loved it and I would definitely make it again and again.

Very classic clafouti recipe. I did change how I prepared it. Instead of using a blender. I first whisked the eggs and sugar then added the melted butter then flour/chocolate mixture and finally the milk. I didn't trust using the blender. It came out perfect. We gave it two forks only because my husband and I are not real chocolate lovers. But,would make it again for friends that love chocolate.

quick, easy, and delicious. we put the leftovers in the fridge, heated some in the microwave, and enjoyed it almost more the second day! It is wonderful when it is piping hot and gooey.

I made this for a casual dinner party and it was a huge hit with everyone: 1. for me, because it was so easy but looked so not easy; 2. for all of us because it was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, using fresh raspberries, and it turned out just as the recipe suggested. I used a 9" pie plate and it filled it in perfectly, didn't overflow as I'd feared. Fulfilled every chocolate lovers' hankering that evening.
