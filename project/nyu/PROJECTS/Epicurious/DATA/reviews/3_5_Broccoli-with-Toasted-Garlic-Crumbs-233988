This wasnt as good as i expected. I used seasoned panko and addedred pepper flakes, even some lemon juice and still didnt make this dish what i thought .

This was delicious!! My husband is a real broccoli lover and I am NOT, so I was excited when I came across this recipe. The crunch of the panko added a fabulous texture to the broccoli and the garlic and lemon added great depth of flavor. Yum!

This was okay at best. We're die-hard broccoli fans in this house, and love garlic and lemon, but it just didn't come together for us in this one. The crumbs were tasty, but overall the dish was flat and needed some more dimension.

It's always good to have another way to serve broccoli and this was easy and delicious.

Wow...this was fantastic. I took the advice posted and used WAY less oil. I used approx 1/8 cup (probably less) and it was fantastic.

Quick and delicious. I don't bother with the lemon zest and go for full garlic effect. We don't leave any pankos behind :-)

My new favorite broccoli recipe! The garlic bread crumbs and the lemon zest made it incredibly scrumptious! I would recommend it to anyone.

This is my least favorite broccoli recipe. It was not hard to make, but not worth the extra effort to make this.

Best broccoli side dish I've ever made! Serve immediately for crispy panko crumbs. It did, however, reheat in a skillet over medium heat. I live alone and I ate it at two sittings. Would be delicious over wholewheat pasta.

Quick and yummy with the fine Italian style bread crumbs I had on hand. Scooped the last two oily, salty, garlicky spoonfuls out of the pan myself. A red light on my doctor's desk blinks when I do that, but whatever.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly but found that the broccoli pieces were too large. The panko didn't manage to stick to the broccoli and I ended up with lots of panko on my plate. The second time, I decided to dice the broccoli into small, half inch sized pieces. This was much better and allowed you to actually get forkfuls of broccoli and panko together! Will definitely make again.

definitely an improvement on plain old steamed broccoli!

I made this for Christmas dinner, along with the Roast Beef Tenderloin with Port Sauce from the Dec Bon Appetit - - it was a great side dish!

Easy and a nice presentation, different than the usual steamed broccoli.

I make this all the time but I use lightly crushed GRAPE-NUTS Cereal instead of panko to make it even healthier

Whew! This is delish! I made it for a dinner party and found that I didn't really want to share with my guests. Can't go wrong with garlic, olive oil, and panko. SOOO GOOD!

This was so good three of us gorged ourselves of the whole pan standing over the oven in three minutes! The breadcrumbs, which we made from a stale pita, were to die for.

Have made a similar recipe before, but using kale and stirfrying the kale, not steaming it. Tried it with broccoli and cauliflower together and had fresh parsley that I chopped and sauteed with the garlic and it was delicious. Even my child ate it... and he is not a fan of vegetables at 3yo. Would make this again, as it is delicious, easy and takes very little time to prepare.

Any recipe that can get my boys to eat their vegetables without the usual questions of "Do I have to eat my vegetables?" and "How many pieces do I have to eat?" gets a high rating. It's simple enough to do on a week night and tasty enough to make over and over again.

I have made this twice and it's been a big hit. Most guests ask for the recipe. Instead of slicing the garlic, I put it through a garlic press which distributes the flavor a little better.

I thought this recipe was rather dull. I think it needs another ingredient, though I do love the lemon zest. Red wine or balsamic vinegar perhaps? I did add some finely grated parmesan cheese as someone suggested, which helped. Still looking for the perfect broccoli recipe!

I thought this recipe tasted delicious however the bread crumbs did not stick well to the broccoli so every bite required putting the crumbs on top. I'm not sure how to best remedy this problem.

I thought this was lovely. I substituted red pepper flakes for the black pepper. I think a little parmesean would be good, too.

Thought this one was just okay. It's a good way to mix it up a little on how you serve broccoli, though.

A nice way to boost the flavor of broccoli with not much effort. yum!

We thought this was "okay", maybe we expected something more -- perhaps more crunchy or crispy. It was good, but simple steamed broccoli with garlic butter would have been just as fine.

First time my husband raved about broccoli!

Didn't have panko, so I used plain breadcrumbs. It was excellent and everyone loved it, but I'm sure using panko would have been even better since it would have made chunkier crumbs.

Was out of olive oil (can you believe it?!) so I used butter. Very good!

This turned out to be the best part of my hoped-to-be fancy dinner. As they say, "it's a keeper!"

Where has panko been all my life? I absolutely loved this. The panko crumbs are crunchy and the addition of the lemon zest as the final touch makes it just perfect. I am not a broccoli lover, in fact had not purchased it in years, but this preparation turned it around completely for me. I plan to try it on other vegetables next time (I'm thinking swiss chard).

This dish was delicious! The only change I would make would be to use a bit less olive oil. 1/3 cup was a lot. I tried it with only 1/4 cup and it was still great! I might even decease it further next time.

This is a nice recipe to add to the rotation. Quick, easy..a great mid-week throw together side. I really enjoyed the panko crumbs with this dish. They're light and airy and don't weigh down the broccoli. I do think this could use a little embellishing with the seasoning, however. Maybe a small handful of parmesan or some red pepper flakes for heat. But this is a nice base recipe and one that is wonderful to have in your repertoire.
