A beautiful and elegant dessert. My son (who is allergic to chocolate) loved it. I skipped the glaceed fruits, but will add them next Christmas. A nice departure from the norm desserts.

An excellent coffee cake. I didn't have molasses for the cake,so I omited it and used 2T brown sugar for the egg whites. I also skipped the frosting and just used powdered sugar as decor.

Beautiful presentation but the cake needed some work. The frosting was overly sweet and buttery, and the cake was very sticky. I glaceed kumquats, strawberries and clemantine sections and they were delightful. My guests were stunned! Just remember to soak glaceed PANS in very hot water for a while in order to get the caramel out.

This recipe was surprisingly easy to make, and was delicious and showy. I did the glaceed fruits as well. My only suggestion is to make sure to dust the towel with a LOT of confectioners sugar - it almost broke because it was stuck to the towel.
