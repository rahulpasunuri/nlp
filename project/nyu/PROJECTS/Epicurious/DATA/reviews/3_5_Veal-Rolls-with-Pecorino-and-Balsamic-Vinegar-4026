This is one of the most delicious things I have eaten in my life- and we cook a LOT. It's easy and satisfying, tastes exotic and fancy but it isn't. I use plain Virginia or Black Forest ham and make sure not to get maple or honey ham- the sweetness doesn't jive. Agree that you will want more sauce.

This dish was tasty, except that the cheese was too overpowering. The second time I made it I used provolone cheese instead and it complemented it well. This is a great dish that will be made over and over again, and its very easy to prepare and quick to cook.

This was good and was much appreciated by my fiance. The cutlets I got were quite large; they required further pounding and I ended up cutting them in half. The filling is easy and has a nice flavor. For ham, I used a german white ham; I think procuitto would be too strong. For the sauce, I ommited the vinegar and added some reduced chicken/porcini broth to the sauce (after removing the rolls), let it cook down, then strained it (a fair amount of cheese had seeped out, leaving a messy-looking sauce) and finished it with some butter. Served with creamy polenta and a great swiss-chard and currant recipe found elsewhere on the site. Very satisfying meal. Do be careful not to overcook the meat as it gets tough.

I followed the cooking directions, but it was overcooked. Think less than a minute per side next time. Used prosciutto instead of ham & just added a sprig of rosemary to the sauce instead of chopped & in the rolls. Make more sauce, you'll want to sop it up w/bread or even some mashed potatoes.

This dish is fantastic! Be careful not to cook the veal too long as the end result will be tough. I recommend doubling the wine and vinegar since this recipe doesn't make enough sauce.

Very good, fast, and easy. I tried some with thin sliced cappy ham and some with prosciutto The prosciutto was definately tastier but some felt it overpowered the veal.

This is a great recipe - fast and easy. I make it for my roommates often and get raves everytime. Instead of regular ham, I use thinly sliced prosciutto and think that might help. I also add a little more balsamic than the recipe calls for.

We really enjoyed this dish, although the discovery that our butcher had cut the veal in long strips about 2" wide required inventiveness in preparation! I had no trouble with cooking time and wonder if the difficulties some others expressed were related to wanting their veal well-done? A big success which I am keen to repeat with correctly shaped veal. I elected to use dried rosemary and added fresh parsley which seems to be a good balance to the pecorino and capers.

One of the few recipes that I got from this web site that did not go over well. I was told it tasted like Spam. I used well trimmed ham from the honey baked ham store and fresh cut veal so I don't know what went wrong. If anybody has any ideas let me know.

this is simple and delicioso! followed recipe exactly except skipped the capers. be sure to pound the veal thin so it cooks through in the pan.

This recipe has the potential to be delicious but unfortunately I used fresh rosemary which overpowered the other ingredients. I would try this recipe again but would cut the amount of rosemary at least in half. I did not dredge the veal and did not have a problem.

We made this as part of a gourmet club dinner and it was great. We did find that the veal rolls needed to be dredged in flour before sauteing -- this also provided a better sauce. Also, depending on the size of the rolls, you may find it necessary to heat them in the oven. But, overall, they were great, especially when served with a starter of linguini frutta di mare, a fennel gratin side, and a chocolate mousse for dessert!
