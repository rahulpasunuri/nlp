Simple recipe with great flavor. I doubled the sauce for pkg of 12 thighs, marinated overnight and broiled instead of grilling. The flavor has a nice subtle smokey flavor from the chipotle tabasco. Definitely needs overnight to marinade.

Excellent. I made it exactly as required by the recipe (which is unusual for me) and grilled on the stove top, as directed. It was simple and very good.

We love this recipe!!! I also add some garlic and cilantro to it. Have used it over fish and steak as well. Usually serve as a burrito, but have also had it with a big mexican salad. We usually make this at least once a week in the summer!!!

This has been my go-to grilled chicken recipe since it was in the magazine years ago. Tasty, quick, and easy - we keep the Chipotle Tabasco in the cupboard just for this one.

This is a good basic idea, but definitely follow the advice of adding garlic, doubling the sauce, etc. We used about a tablespoon of canned chipotles and a bit of sauce instead of chipotle tobasco - we love heat and the chipotle flavor and thought that would be a good start. Unfortunately the chicken turned out quite bland. We also left the skins on (accident!) and I think taking them off would have helped too. Also - not sure, but I think the recipe neglects to mention that one should boil the marinade - it had raw chicken in it! Amp this one up, marinate for a few hours - not 10 minutes! - and it would be much better!

This has become our entire family's favorite quick grilled chicken recipe - so easy, tasty (wonderful smoky flavor!) and very moist chicken that is exceptionally versatile. I didn't have access to the Tabasco, so used chipotle powder instead and also added a healthy amount of garlic and chopped cilantro to the marinade. It's great alone, in sandwiches, over caesar salad, in a caesar salad wrap, or try it sliced and tossed with penne and pesto - YUM!!

DELICIOUS!! Sweet and tangy and I've never eaten a chicken that moisty!!! I used canned chipotle instead of the Tabasco sauce and it gives a real-not-to-spicy flavor.

A smoky, sizzling update on boring grilled chicken. It marinates fast and pairs well with fresh guacamole, blue corn tortilla chips, and a nice cold Mexican lager like Pacifico. Bonus: I'd never thought to try chipotle tabasco until I saved this recipe -- now I can't imagine eggs without it.

I didn't have access to Chipotle Tabasco, so substituted a teaspoon of chipotle power with a few dashes of regular tabasco. I also added a few cloves of garlic based on the other reviews. I left the chicken to marinate for about 6 hours and it was WONDERFUL! Will definitely be making this again...

Rating: 4
Yum Yum Yummy! Between all the reviewers and the chipotle sauce maker's website recommending the addition of garlic - how could I go wrong? I doubled the sauce recipe, marinated the chicken overnight and used the extra sauce for basting. The chicken was a moist, tangy, mouthful of flavor! This recipe is a keeper.

This is really worth trying. It is super easy to make and the flavors are wonderful. My husband absolutely loved it!! Do marinate it for at least 6hrs, if not overnight.

Rating: 3
Very good.I covered the grill, since I used boneless breasts. The chicken was done perfectly after 6 minutes per side, plus 3-4 more after basting with sauce after the honey was added. Served with Fig Salad with Yogurt and ciabatta bread -- very nice summery lunch.

Rating: 4
This was super easy to make! I added about 1 tablespoon minced garlic to it and 3 Tablespoons of the chipotle sauce. I also let it marinate over night. The flavors were fresh and simple, it is a perfect summer marinade. Not to mention how easy it is to throw together and leave over night. I will make this again, my mom asked for the recipe;)

I have made this recipe several times and it is a huge hit every time. Instead of Tabasco Chipotle sauce, I use Bufalo Chipotle sauce-- slightly thicker. If you can't find Bufalo brand at your Mexican grocer, I'm sure you can get the same effect by chopping up a chipotle in adobo to add in to the Tabasco Chipotle sauce. Good quality honey makes the difference and only fresh lime juice is right (please don't use the bottled). By using the skin off, boneless thighs, you will really save time on the grilling side. Suppose you can also use chicken breast or tenders if you cut the grill time down. We reserve some of the marinade and use for dipping afterwards...you could also use it to baste a couple minutes before pulling off the grill. Serve with tomato-cucumber- onion salad, grilled corn with butter/chilli powder and some warm corn bread for a delightful summertime lunch or dinner. We kept the grill on last time and grilled some peaches/plums for desertwith a bit of vanilla ice cream. Chicken leftovers make awesome chicken salad, quesadillas, or sandwiches the next day(s).

This is a great marinade. I love the fact that it is not soy sauce based (they all seem to be) and was not too salty. I made some changes. I did take the skin off of my thighs, but I didn't remove the bones because it adds flavor. Also, due to poor planning, I wasn't able to grill, so I roasted them in the oven (would have been much better grilled). Also, I was only able to marinate for around 1/2 an hour. That adds a bit of flavor, but I would recommend marinating for much longer, at least a few hours if possible... maybe overnight. I will definitely be using this marinade again because it had a really nice flavor. It was not really spicy, next time I might add some canned chipotles for a more chipotle flavor.

I made this about six months ago or so. This is such a great dish and not really too hard to make. The tastes seem to blend together really well. I also added garlic as people have suggested. I found the sauce irresistable. We did not even marinade it but a few hours. I recommended this to a friend since I don't eat meat anymore and remembered I never put my review.

This marinade was just okay. I would rather make it with ground chipotle powder. The Chipotle Tabasco has a vinegary twang that I found unpleasant. I would try it next time with ground chipotle powder (order from Penzey's -- it's great stuff!) and some crushed garlic.

I can tell by the ingredients that it was going to be blah. I added 1/2 c. cilantro, finely chopped and 2 garlic, chopped like some reviewers recommended and it came it wonderful. I used mixed chicken pieces instead. This will be great for a mexican chicken rice bowl. I marinated for 2 hrs next time I will do it for 24 hrs. This may probably good for shrimp. I was able to find the Tabasco chiptole at Stater Bros.

This was excellent. Like previous reviewers said, add 2-3 minced garlic cloves and marinate a couple of hours.

I tried this recipe for a cookout and while it was easy to prepare, the result was lacking. I will try it again and marinate the chicken longer - that may have been part of the problem. I will also add more chipotle Tabasco next time.

I loved this recipe. What a great summer dish! My family loved it too including my 3 children. It was not spicy but had a great tang. I added 3 large minced garlic cloves along with 1/2 C of chopped cilantro. I marinated it for 4-5 hours and it was terrific. You need to marinate chicken for longer than the recipe calls for.

Very easy. I made this with chicken breasts as opposed to the thighs, and on a grill pan. I added some chopped garlic and cilantro, which kicked it up a notch, but even though I marinated the chicken for half an hour, I would marinate it for even longer. The taste on the outside was amazing, but it hadn't quite penetrated the middle. I'll definitely try this one again.

I found this recipe after searching for something to do with my can of chipotle chiles. I would highly recommend processing a few of these with the sauce, a lovely smoky flavor. If you're having issues with flare-ups on the grill, my suggestion is to shake off as much marinade as possible, and then keep an eye on it while basting furiously with some reserved sauce that wasn't used for marinating. Yummy with a salad of cucumbers and tomatoes in a lime-cilantro dressing.

VERY EASY and moist, even using skinless, boneless chicken breasts..Marinated the breasts in the sauce about 8 hours..upped Chipotle hot sauce to 3T and used a bit more garlic and more honey..took little time to prepare and was easy as pie, but sauce did notknock me out..maybe will try combining with another fruit juice (orange?) as suggested by another reviewer..still, would make this again for a quick, easy, mid-week meal

This was good, although not great, but SO EASY! I marinated the chicken overnight and it came out nice and moist, but I did not think the sauce was anything special(and I love chipotles). I made this with the peanut sesame noodles, also on this web site, which was more work, but really excellent, so this was a good combo for a mid-week meal.

A true keeper!! I first made this dish exaclty as instructed and it was excellent, as were the leftovers! I then modified it somewhat to make it crowd-friendly for a backyard BBQ: I turned it into sates by using frozen chicken breast tenders. The recipe lends itself perfectly to doubling, tripling, etc. As did many, I added ample crushed garlic to the marinade, and to ease preparation for a large group, I marinaded them the night before and skewered them the following day. Definitely a crowd pleaser, as I have been asked to contribute the same at other outdoor gatherings and can not keep up with the recipe requests!

This will be a workday standard. Very tasty, and very easy. I added 1.5 Tbs of fresh orange juice to the reserved marinade, which added a bit of depth and a tad more sweetness to the sauce that I liked. (Still not sweet, bu any means.) I sliced the chicken and served it with corn tortillas and salad.

Fantastic. Grill pan worked wonders on my gas range. The chipotle Tabasco added just a hint of spiciness and the honey mellowed everything right out. I served it with asparagus.
