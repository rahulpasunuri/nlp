I made this just as the recipe stated - it was delicious. The halibut is delicate and the sauce was a nice pairing.

Loved it! After reading the comments, I used about half the butter, added a little more wine, added a few dashes of orange bitters, and substituted cilantro for the parsley. The sauce was full of flavor.

Great recipe! My husband caught a 75 pound halibut last summer in Alaska so we have tried many halibut recipes and this is by far the best--the cranberries were a magnificent choice. We added a bit more salt and pepper, and paired the dish with a long-grain wild rice, green beans, and Brewer-Clifton 2008 Mount Carmel Sta. Rita Hills Chardonnay. Delicious! We'll definitely be passing this recipe along to our family in Alaska!!

Excellent yet simple, easy preparation. The sauce was wonderful, although the suggestion of cranberries sounds like it might be worth a try for some additional color. Key to success here is getting good Halibut fillets and then not overcooking them!

Good but agree with the previous reviewer that it didnt have enough seasoning. Used dried cranberries as well. I also didn't like the way the butter pooled in the sauce. Might be better with less butter.

This was a quick and easy but impressive fish dish. The textures were wonderful. I too used dried cranberries since I had them on hand. Next time I would add more salt and pepper, I didn't think there was enough seasoning. The store didn't have Halibut that day so I used snapper instead and reduced the cook time slightly to keep the fish moist and juicy. Was a big hit for such an easy dish.

I made this on Christmas Eve and used dried cranberries instead of raisins for the color, and the tartness with the toasted almonds was a delightful contrast. Everyone enjoyed this dish. I will try with the raisins again at another time.
