A really pleasant surpise! I threw this together in 30 min for a dinner party and was very happy with the results. I made it in one 9 inch tart pan (there's a little leftover crust that didn't fit), spread the apricot puree, piped lots of little whipcream stars all over the tart and then liberally sprinkled the sliced almonds. It was beautiful! The crust is VERY sweet b/c of the confectioner's sugar, but the topping and the whip cream are not and so really balance the dessert. I would definitely make this again.

Delicious.Made the shortbread in a mini-muffin pan so no need to scoop out the middle and very little work!
