I've made this many times over the years and have always been amazed at how much people like this. I've varied over the years depending on what I had at hand. I've added a layer of ham salad, garnished with salmon, or just served the egg salad with crackers. Everyone has always raved about it.

Made this a few years ago as an Easter appetizer and everyone loved it, including my mother-in-law with very discriminating (critical) taste. It makes a LOT, so this year I am going to try cutting down the recipe and using a mini springform pan. The yellow from the eggs, orange/red from the caviar and green from the dill are gorgeous together. Totally elegant and not very difficult.

Fantastic - the dish not only tasted great, but visually was stunning. My guests were extremely impressed with a dish that was so easy and was prepped ahead of time, giving me time to enjoy my event!

A friend of ours was kind enough to give us delicious caviar and I tried this recipe. Had the same friends over to enjoy it with us and we all loved it. Delicious.

It was delicious, serves a lot of people! I think when I make it again, I will use creamcheese instead of the butter, but otherwise we all liked it! Used party rye and "real" pumpernickle squares

This excellent spread is a big hit at every party I throw -- no matter the season or the occasion. I highly recommend it.

Just made this last night for my contribution to a New Years Eve party. It was well received. Didn't have chives so i just used the whole scallion. Couldn't get slalmon roe so ussed lumpfish which was probably a little too salty. stick with the recipe and it will be fine. Great for a shower or brunch.

IT WAS EXCELLENT!!! I made it for Christmas Eve and it was well received. I had some left over and took it to my sister's house for Christmas Day; it held up nicely and everyone enjoyed it. Would I make it again - - MOST DEFINITELY! The cost for the salmon caviar is comparable to a pound of shrimp. The torte went alot further. It was also easy!!!!!

I made this recipe for a Christmas cocktail party. It was very easy and absolutely gorgeous looking...my mother kept trying to stop people from digging into it because the effect would be ruined. I did double the amount of caviar on top and the red eggs were perfect for the season. Everyone loved it and the left over "mess" was fabulous stirred into scrambled eggs the next morning!
