I'm not going to rate this as I didn't make it as written. Did the filling as listed but added toasted walnuts, finely chopped. I did want to comment that I think the filling-to-pasta ratio was a bit off. I would do at least a tsp and a half if not more. Used an egg wash (beaten egg + tbsp water) to seal and it worked great. Turned out good.

Delicious! I've made it three times exactly as written (minus the olives) and every time it's as amazing as the last.

Excellent dish! I made the recipe exactly and it is mouth-watering!! My family and I enjoy eating it. You might as well glance for this site www.pepperecipes.com

This is a very fun and light dish (let's pretend that we didn't notice that lake of brown butter). I followed the recipe exactly and now wish that I added at least some fresh basil to peppers right before plating, to brighten it up. The herbs in the filling didn't stand out as much as I had hoped. Also, next time I will replace olives with capers to see if that works better. We enjoyed the delicateness of ravioli that was complemented by smokiness of peppers. I am glad I had spent all that time, it was worth it!

The filling is delicious. I made my own pasta with 50/50 regular and semolina flour, which made the ravioli a bit chewier. The bell pepper sauce was good but barely enough for 4 people and may have overpowered the delicate filling. I had some leftover and just used butter and parmesan for the topping. I would recommend this recipe. Next time I make it, I will try just the regular flour.

Made this for vegetarian friends and they flipped. Followed the recipe exactly. Will definitly make again but will try to make the pasta instead of wontons, if I have the time.

I made toasted ravioli useing the goat cheese filling. It was great.

i've never worked with wonton wrappers before and every single ravioli in my first batch fell apart in the water. I found their texture to be pretty slimy and unappetizing. If i made this again i would try making may own pasta dough.

I liked the raviolis tossed in browned butter and will repeat that. But, I prefer the cheese ravioli filling I concoct with ricotta and egg yolk instead of the goat cheese. I made bell pepper mixture exactly as directed and found it to be just OK -- maybe a little more vinegar would help. I won't make this again.

I did a "deconstructed" variation of this dish using homenade tagliatelle with the goat cheese mixture liberally sprinkled on top with the parmesan, pine nuts and chives. It was equally as tasty as the ravioli version, but a little less time consuming.

Made our own pasta and it made about 48 large raviolis. We love this dish!The bitterness of the olives was a great balance to the sweet peppers and creamy goat/ marscapone filling. Yum

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year as a side for vegetarian friends. It is PERFECT! I changed nothing, followed the recipe and everyone loved it.

So good. The rich creamy pasta and the sharp fresh peppers. Yum! Time consuming, but completely worth it. Egg roll wrappers cut into fours worked well, and the leftover filling (I was cooking for two) was awesome on Goat Cheese Potato Gratin, also a yummy epi recipe.

This is the best pasta dish I have ever made. I made it for a girls dinner party and they all went back for seconds. It was delicious. I will make it again. Very light and very good.

Just wonderful. First time I have reviewed a recipe, but it was so good I felt I had to. An explosion of flavors, complex and rich. Definitely roast your own peppers. I only had red, yellow and orange--wished I had a green pepper--would have been a good addition to cut the sweetness.

I found this recipe a bit disappointing. The raviolis were good but not better than that. I don't think they were worth the 1 1/2 hours of prep time.

I had some Trader Joe's "Mushroom Blend Ravioli With Asiago & Mascarpone Cheese" left over, so I decided to prepare everything but the actual ravioli in this recipe. It still turned phenomenal; I can't wait to prepare everything from scratch eventually.

Utterly marvelous. I was melting with the first bite. Tangy creamy on the inside, tart with vinegar and rich with butter on the outside- it is divineI agree with the original reviewer- I would drive out of my way to visit Bonne Soiree.

These were very tasty. I made the filling as written, but had round potsticker wrappers,so I used my smallest scoop for portioning, maybe like1rounded teaspoon, then folded over . It made around 35. I got too booged down with other stuff to do the sauce, so combined a bottle of Bertolli vodka sauce and added 2 roasted peppers to that. Delicious.

Delicious. I added a plash of red wine and some tomato juice from the canned tomatos.

I didn't follow the ravioli recipe exactly: instead of wonton wrappers, I used homemade pasta with fresh herbs; I omitted the herbs in the filling; and I substituted fresh neufchâtel for the mascarpone. I followed the serving suggestions and everyone loved it - it presents well and the flavors and textures are rich and complex. Also, it's pretty simple to make. I'll definitely make it again.

A-may-zing. Incredible. I made this last week exactly according to the recipe, and it was quite possibly the best dish I've made ever. The varied flavors marry so perfectly. The only thing I might have done differently is to brown a bit more butter, because the cheese filling used more than the alloted won ton wrappers. Other than that, perfect. HIGHLY recommended.

AMAZING!!! I wrote Tina and Chip a letter this morning after cooking it last night. I can understand why they were selected for The Resturant Issue. I will definitely make this again. I did not use the green pepper, I made in the shape of ravoli and browned 1 stick of butter. I have never wanted to take the time to rate a recipe before but this one deserves accolades. I would drive out of my way to eat at Bonne Soiree.
