I made this soup for lunch. Followed the recipe pretty much except for the cayenne pepper, and the calamari. Grilled the tomatoes, great flavors...will make this again.

Loved the dish, the fresh beans are turning up in the farmer's market. But it was Recipe Rage in the comments that gave me the most pleasure...

I did make some alterations, but it turned into a spectacular soup! I used Roma tomatoes instead of "large" ones. They have little water compared to most and roasted down nicely. I used pinto beans and green beans instead of the other ones (it's what I had on hand). I probably used more Cayenne than it called for and added green peppers. I used canned squid and wouldn't really recommend it. The soup should use fresh or none at all. We kept the squid separate so a vegetarian could eat it; I liked the veggie one better. This really needs fresh cooked squid.

Not the best soup. My husband like it, for me it is ok but not the best.

Easy to prepare, and it came out great. I roasted the tomatoes in large chunks and used canned cannellini beans instead, and then blended the whole thing (minus squid) with an immersion blender. Sorta like pasta fagioli. And the cayenne pepper adds just the right level of spice.

Great dish! Easy, well rounded and satisfying. I added green bell peppers, but kept all the other ingredients as well. I didn't follow ratios exactly, but the overall flavor was great. I served it with a fresh baquette.

I made this with Flagrano shelling beans (in my farm share this week). I couldn't find romano beans, so I used grocery store sugar snap beans instead. I found the timeline a bit hard to follow so I made these notes: start - roast tomatoes 0:25 - saute leek, onion, garlic 0:35 - add wine to onion mixture, reduce 0:40 - remove tomatoes from oven, add to onion mixture with shell beans and ingredients, simmer 0:50 - simmer soup, add romano beans, place the squid into a bowl with the parsley and garlic 1:20 - saute squid, plate it up!

i LOVED this. i used heirloom and vine tomatoes about 6 and only fava beans. the calamari was so good on top, i will double that next time. kids liked it too.

I'm going to get in trouble for not having tried this recipe. Squid isn't all that common here in KS. But tomatoes are. Forty minutes seems like WAY too long for a roast. Roasted tomatoes kinda gross me out anyway, but one's that are completely melted makes it even worse.
