I have never had bluefish so wasn't sure what to expect but it was delicious and different. I also used 3 bluefish fillets and sandwiched the filling in, pressing the almond mixture to make an interior crust upon which I lay the lemons and pats of butter. It did cook sooner- in about 20 minutes. Wonderful flavors and the fish was meaty and rich, but not oily. I had cous cous on the side which was a nice pairing and I did not make the sauce since I wanted my 2 year old to eat it and it sounded strong. Didn't even miss the sauce. Look forward to making again.

Used 2 lb. total bluefish fillets and did not use sauce. Sandwiched filling between the fillets. Also crushed coriander used in almond stuffing. My go to recipe for bluefish!

Delicious!!! I must admit, making this recipe as a last minute preparation in a huge Easter feast, I didn't follow the recipe to a T but the flavor combinations were absolutely delicious! I used sliced almonds in the stuffing (mistake as a last minute purchase) but they absorbed the flavors fabulously and were a great textural compliment when served alongside the fish. The vinegar sauce was quite bitter by itself, but did give another layer of flavor to the dish. Definitely will make this again.

I made this with sea bass. Didn't care much for the sauce, the vinegar was too overpowering for me - might try again with either white balsamic vinegar or a dry white wine (something like chardonnay). The spices were great with the roast fish, and I loved the no-hassle preparation, a keeper.

This was a truly surprising and wonderful marriage of coriander, bay, almonds, lemon and fish. The sauce is amazing, the entire creation beautiful. I could not find a Bluefish, but enjoyed success using a whole Red Snapper and found the preparation very straightforward. Lovely.

It was delicious and a big hit at dinner. The fish cooked much sooner than the allotted time in the recipe, so keep an eye on it.

This sounds great. But be forwarned, be sure to use the very mild TURKISH bay leaves in this recipe. If you try this with the extremely potent California Bay Laurel leaves this dish will be an absolute DISASTER! Trust me.
