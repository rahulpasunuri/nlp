Eek. This recipe looked pretty simple and tasty, but it actually took ages and was quite bland. I also couldn't get celery leaves and just increased other leaves a little bit each. In the end my 'jam' really tasteless and had a stringy-spinach consistency. I ended up fiddling with lots of seasonings and spices to give it some taste, and I pureed it to make it more spreadable. The end result was okay but I wouldn't make it again.

I've never tried anything like this before -- it's one of those recipes where the end result seems much greater than the sum of its parts. I couldn't find celery leaves, so I just mixed in extra cilantro and parsley. But the sweet smoked paprika (pimenton de vera) is a must! I had trouble finding it, but ending up getting some from Dean & Deluca. Definitely serve with the Small Semolina Griddle Breads that the recipe links to.
