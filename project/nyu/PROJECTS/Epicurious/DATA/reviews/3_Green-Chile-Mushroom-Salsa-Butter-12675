Made this in conjuction with the rubbed steaks. However, I modified it to death, so in a sense, I rating a different recipe. Could not find epazote leaves, so i substituted about a 1/2C chopped cilantro. Did not want to spend the $$ for morels (especially in a salsa) so used crimini instead. With the spice rubbed steaks, the butter added a wonderful complexity of flavors.

"Sunny" (below) appears to have a pallet that shines brightest over the culinary variety offered in an institution kitchen. (Probably not a some place where residents can freely come-and-go!) Anyway,salsa butter= 95% Added 2 chiles & wow (had to EAT it w/rubber gloves). Uncle Mel w/throat cancer abstained though! Hey wildman Sunny: stick w/Ambrosia Salad & Lime Jello!

I don't know why they call it butter. It has no butter in it and doesn't have the texture of butter. I was disappointed in it. It had decent flavor but nothing memorable.
