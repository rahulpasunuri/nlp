I used a can of rotel for the tomatoes, and did add a tablespoon of adobe sauce. I smoked the chicken using the tea smoked recipe from Epicurious. I found the potato to be a bit undercooked, would recommend cutting it into smaller chunks.

Smoked my own chicken breast in the oven using liquid smoke. This is the corn chowder I have been searching for! They should add corn to the title. I found it by accident. WOW! 10+

This is so tasty! I too didn't have smoked chicken, but I did have a roasted chicken with a mesquite rub. I shredded the chicken, and followed the recipe as suggested. Well almost...as other reviewers suggested, I added more potatoes and that was a good choice. I think next time I might omit the jalapeno and add a little more adobo chilies.

I believe I may have reviewed this before, but after making it for the upteenth time, and just having enjoyed it for lunch, I have to give my kudos once again. This chowder has fantastic flavor, is relatively easy to make and always garners rave reviews in my house with family and friends. A few changes I make: I purchase Jennie-O Smoked Turkey/Ham and dice, definitely double the amount of chiles and even add a bit of the sauce from the can for added heat, substitue fat free half and half for the cream and use canned corn. Not the type of changes that would completely change the flavor profile, but in my opinion it works. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe, you won't regret it.

Good Soup. Wanted to make a lower calorie option so I used whole milk instead of the cream (and less of it like 1 3/4 cup), along with olive oil to saute my onions (and only about 1/2 cup of the olive oil). I also used one tsp of liquid smoke bc I didn't have a smoked chiken. I used two potatoes as well...and roasted canned diced tomatoes (which i drained first). I think the soup is still very thick but not so heavy it weighs you down. I will make it again. enjoy!

So easy and delicious! I mostly followed the recipe except for a few small things: I chopped up some bacon and used its grease to cook the onions, and I accidentally used pepper jack instead of plain Monterey. But we like spicy food, so that turned out good. And like previous reviewers, I used more chipotle peppers than the recipe called for. Again, we like spicy food, so that was a good change. My grocery store didn't have a true smoked chicken, so I just ordered a pound of Boar's Head smoked chicken breast in one big lump from the deli. Served it with corn muffins. This would be perfect for a large crowd during football season.

After reading the reviews, I made a few changes of my own, but kept to the flavor profile of the chowder. To start, I used a small amount of oil to cook some Mexican-style chorizo from WFs. When that was cooked through, I removed it and used the fat to cook the potato, onion, chile, garlic, etc. I increased the potato significantly, to four potatoes. I used smoked turkey instead of chicken, because that's what I could find, and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream. It was fantastic! A great potluck or large gathering.

This is delicious! I have made it exactly as is and with substituting half & half for the cream. Both ways tasted amazing!

This recipe is a fall and winter staple in our house, but allow me to make a recommendation or two. First, we use a Cameron Stove Top Smoker to smoke our chicken breasts and I usually lay bacon slices (usually about 4 pieces for three breasts) over them to help keep them moist. Then I remove the bacon and crisp it between two paper towels in the microwave (about 90 seconds to 2 minutes depending on the thickness of the bacon), chop it and sprinkle it as a garnish on the bowls just before serving. It adds a nice flavor and texture. I have used both all cream and ½ cream and ½ milk, and prefer the cream with additional stock to achieve the desired consistency. Lastly, the parsley; give me a break. 1 Tbsp. is merely for color, and my personal opinion is, why bother? Instead I add about 4 ounces of baby spinach along with the corn, chicken, etc. for not only color, but for the sweet silky element it adds to the soup. Oh yes, it needs more chipotle, and a bit of the adobo sauce to taste.

Rating: 0
This recipe has been a staple in my home for over a year now, my teenage kids ask for it all the time. I do make some minor adjustments. I replace the chipotle in adobo sauce with dried chipotle powder only because I always have that on hand and it's more economical. I add a diced red pepper when sautee'ing the onions to give it some colour. Instead of fresh parsley I used dried but I add fresh baby spinach. I no longer bother with the cheese at the end as I serve it with cheese bread or biscuits on the side. I generally use leftover chicken or turkey when I make this...smoked or not, it's a great comfort food.

I couldn't find smoked chicken so I used grilled chicken and added a teaspoon of liquid smoke. I simmered this chowder for 20 minutes but it never thickened. I think it would have been better to use a stick blender on the vegetables then add the chicken for texture. Ultimately I was unimpressed.

Rating: 4
Like others, I made some changes (which I usually avoid the first time I try a recipe -- but come on, 1/2 cup oil, 2 cups heavy cream for 1 measly potato?). I sauteed 3 pieces of good bacon in the soup pot, removed the bacon, and used the few tablespoons of bacon fat to saute the onions. I used a serrano since I had one on hand from the garden and the last of my tomatoes. I used 3 big Russets (about 2 1/2 pounds). I used homemade chicken broth, and 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of 1% milk. Extra chipotle because I had so much more potato. Next time I will use an ancho or poblano for a little more "vegetable", and reduce the flour by half since I am using so much more potato. Also, I cooked the potato for 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients, and added the cheese right before serving, along with the bacon.

Rating: 4
Read the previous reviews for inspiration, and ultimately made this as written except I used smoked turkey and half and half instead of cream. The half and half is not much of a difference calorie-wise but I wanted to retain the richness. Also, the jalapenos in the store looked like shoe leather so I used half of a good sized poblano, which probably ended up as a better choice for my less spice-tolerant son. This was a terrific chowder and I ended up eating two bowls and my husband pronounced it "fantastic." I feel like a beached whale now but it was so worth it.

I could not believe how good this chowder was. I made it to the recipe the first time, but the second time I tried to use whole milk instead of the cream. This version was not nearly as good. Go with the cream.

Rating: 3
I made a vegetarian version and it turned out great: I used smoked cheese and, since I didn't have cream, used milk for both the cream and the chicken broth. The milk curdled a bit, maybe I should have used more flour, but it tasted fine and didn't look too bad. I used cilantro instead of parsley - I think it worked very well. Didn't miss the chicken - it was thick and flavorful.

so yummy! made this tonight, i added 2 whole chipotle peppers, and it was sooo good!!! i will definitely make this again. we loved it! i loved how spicy it was, but if you don't like too spicy foods, you could use less jalapeno pepper. also i used canned tomatoes which was easier. and canned corn, 3 smaller red potatoes unpeeled. i also used a lot more of the fresh parsley than asked for. about 1/2 a bunch.

It was really good. I followed recommendations from comments and added smoked paprika, creole seasoning, used smoked turkey sausage and added extra adobo sauce from the chiles. ( I like spicy food to make me cry) Served with the Honey Sage cornbread from this site. Fabulous!

made this tonight and used some reviewer advice. I did find it a bit too hot for my family though so I cut back the ancho portion. I was prepared to add more jalapeno but held back. glad I did or no one would have eaten it. I used Yukon golds not russet --maybe that was the prob on the heat factor?? and half & half was enough- can't imagine whole cream! yikes! am anxious to taste the leftovers tomorrow to see if it improves with age.

This was a hit. Changes made: omitted jalapeno (somehow it didn't get home with me from the store), used 2 chipotles plus small spoonful of adobo sauce, used 1 c. cream and 1 c. milk, used a can of fire roasted tomatos and used several dashes of liquid smoke. I used 1/2 of a smoked chicken from a BBQ joint. Like the suggestions of pepper jack & smoked paprika. Will definately try that next time. Thought the fire roasted tomatos were a good addition. Better quality than the lousy grocery store varities this time of year. This was easy to throw together. Will stay in the repitore. Hubby said this was in the top 5 of soups he's ever had.

Excellent soup. Had to make a few changes. I substituted dried mexican oregano for the parsley, pepper jack cheese for the jack cheese and chipotle hot sauce for the real thing (ended up being a good sub as I could control the heat). I gilded the lily by sauteeing the onions in bacon fat and then used the bacon, some chopped cilantro and a little sour cream to garnish the soup. Even w/o my changes the soup would still be winner.

Loved this recipe. I made several adjustments to make it MUCH healthier and it still turned out delicious. I used 1 onion and only 2 tbs oil. Kept flour the same. Added a tbs of smoked paprika with the flour because I used a plain chicken breast. It was deliciously smoky. To make it even lighter, I used fat free half and half.It was absolutely fabulous.

made this for my girlfriend when she was sick. It's a good hearty soup recipe -- the soup that eats like a meal...but...for the amount of work I would say it is not quite there. I kept adding more chipotle to increase the flavor but chipotle is kind of a sweet flavor, with a spicy after taste. I think it needs a more up-front tang to make it the perfect soup. Maybe because I left out the jalapeno. I generally don't like spicy things, but this was too bland. I like the idea of blending the ingredients to increase the creamy consistency but again, too much work.

I have been making this recipe for four years now, and condider it the best soup I know how to make. Here are a couple adjustments I have made, which have enabled me to whip this up in fifteen minutes, although the complexity of the flavors makes it taste like it took all day. Or, you can very successfully use the recipe as written with great results. 1. for your gluten-intolerant guests, skip the flour and double the potatoes. Let simmer until the potatoes have thickened it. Go light on the extra cup of broth. That's for you, Molly ;) 2. I ALWAYS use canned tomatoes. I live in Omaha and we cannot get reliably good tomatoes year round. It is quite good that way...I use one can of petite diced, with juice. 3. Schilling makes a powdered chipolte which is absolutely perfect for this recipe. 4. Buy a whole smoked chicken. Whole Foods Market sells one here for 5.99. You cannot beat that. I even pour some of the juice out of the tray into the pot. Otherwise, call a local barbecue and they will have or be able to produce a smoked chicken or smoked chicken breasts. 5. Skip the jalapeno. If you use enough chipolte powder you will be set for spiciness and flavor. 6. Pepper jack instead of jack. Need I say more about that? 7. Corn. I'm from Nebraska and prefer fresh corn, but I have to say I have tried it with canned and frozen and can't tell much difference in this recipe. 8. The parsley is nice for color but the flavor is lost here. Don't insist on it. 9. Quit cutting corners on the fat content, etc. Watch your portion size instead. 10. Canned potatoes? C'mon, now. You can dice one potato very easily. I have found this recipe to serve about six people, with each person having a second bowl (and they will want one). Good luck with this one. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

This was incredible!! One of the best I've tasted! I couldn't find smoked chicken, so I did use a bit of liquid smoke. I used extra chipotle as well, so it was nice and spicy. Instead of all the heavy cream I used 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of skim milk & 1/3 cup of powdered milk. That made it thick and I saved some calories and fat. My husband liked it so much that he had more for breakfast the next morning!

The consensus of the changes (per prior reviews) is that less cream (or low fat varieties), canned tomatoes, more chipotles, and use of some liquid smoke when smoked poultry is unavailable are all OK.

I had leftover smoked chicken and had made stock from the carcasses, so I was looking for a recipe! I used canned diced potatoes and canned petite cut tomatoes for ease, and cilantro instead of flat-leaf parsley, which seemed appropriate given the other ingredients. A whole can for 1/2 a chipotle pepper seemed a bit wasteful. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and less than was recommended. It was wonderful and easy and a definite keeper.

This dish was good, although I was a little disappointed! I could not find smoked chicken so I used roasted chicken breasts and substituted the heavy cream with half and half. Next time I will stick to the original recipe and maybe it will turn out better. My family enjoyed it and I will make it again.

This was just terrific. I couldn't find smoked chicken, so I used regular boneless chicken breast, which I sauteed in olive oil with a bit of liquid smoke. I doubled the recipe, and I couldn't bear to use all that cream. Fat-free half-and-half worked fine (and I only used half of what was called for). The potatoes were a bit underdone; next time I'll boil those a bit longer in the chicken broth before I add the half-and-half.

Very good hearty soup. One of my teenage daughters friends liked it so much he asked for the recipe and made it himself! Substituted smoked pork chop for the chicken (easier to find)but it would have been fine without also a can of diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes(better quality at most time of the year).

This is a great recipe for a chilly winter night. I used fat-free half-n-half (heresy, I know, but have to watch the waistline- don't scold me) and it was still a nice creamy chowder. For those who have trouble finding smoked chicken, I recommend investing in a Cameron stovetop smoker. You can get one for about 30 bucks right now on Amazon. For the time it takes to run around town trying to find smoked chicken you can make your own! Do try this chowder! It's delicious!

YUM! This hearty chowder serves up big spicy, smoky flavor without too much heat; even the mild of palate in your group will love it. Just add crusty bread and a salad to this rich, thick chowder, and you have a terrific meal. If you're watching calories and/or fat intake, evaporated skim milk (not sweetened!) is a perfect stand-in for the cream; you'll never miss it, and nobody else will ever know. Also, if you can't find smoked chicken breasts at your market, try marinating chicken breasts or cutlets overnight in a little liquid smoke; cook at the beginning of the recipe, then continue as usual. This will be a regular meal for us, especially during the colder months.

This chowder is fantastic! If you have the time/equipment/desire - smoke your own chicken and after you carve it, use the remains to make your own chicken broth - the smoke flavor is amazing.

Loved this! I'm on a low-carb recipe, so I adapted it by deleting the corn, flour and potatoes. This freezes really well if you don't add the cheese while cooking. I make huge batches of this and have it "stockpiled" in the freezer. I also used cilantro instead of parsley, olive oil instead of veg oil, 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of just 3 plum tomatoes, and I used an entire 4oz can of chipotles in adobo sauce. It was a little too spicy, so I tamed it a little by adding a couple more T's of cream. YUM.

I like the flavours in the recipe very much. My wife and a friend who was visiting were very impressed. We will deinitely have this again, and again. Smoked chicken is hard to find but liquid smoke is available at most large supermarkets. Remember that chipotle chiles are smoked. I added four chiles to the recipe and about a half tsp. of liquid smoke. I may skip the liquid smoke next time.
