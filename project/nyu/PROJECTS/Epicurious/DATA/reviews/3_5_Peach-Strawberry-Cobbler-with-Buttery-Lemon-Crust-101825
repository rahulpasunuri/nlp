This could easily just be called "fruit cobbler". I made it with bing cherries, blueberries and peaches, used 1 1/2 times the crust recipe and since it's hard to halve an egg yolk, just used the whole egg. It was delicious. I think whatever combination of fruit suits your fancy would work well in this recipe.

Followed this receipt to a "T", didn't do the multiple cooking times. It turned out to be delicious and we really liked the flavors of the zesty lemon. We served it with vanilla bean icecream. Highly recommend for a really good refreshing cobbler.

I never review - but this is exceptional. I also followed the 350 for 1/2 time and 375 to finish for the temp. As others, I made a double crust recipe and it was absolutely spectacular. Added a bit extra zest than it asked for and used local berries and peaches. WINNER! If you dislike bread-y cobbler and pie you will like this because the crust is actually like a cookie.

I really loved the lemon/buttery crust. However, the strawberries are very bitter unless you coat them in sugar and let them sit for a while before putting the topping on.

I made a slightly larger recipe of this for a church fundraiser using nectarines in place of peaches. It was a big hit and not difficult to make. I plan to do it again later this summer to share with my colleagues at work. It combines two of my favorite fruits.

This came out quite good. I actually added sliced granny smith apple because I didn't have peaches and topped it off with a dollop of fresh whipping cream. Word of warning, the dessert can definitely be on the rich side with the cream.

I have made this recipe since I received my Bon Appetit issue July, 1999. I always substitute blueberries for the strawberries. Otherwise, made as directed. The results are outstanding.

We used strawberries for an Easter dessert - it was absolutely delicious and so easy! We didn't add any sugar to the strawberries because the sugar in the topping was enough for us. We will try the peaches, along with strawberries, next time.

I did this last night and everybody loved it! My guest even requested the recipe. Very easy too do and absolutely delicious. Will try it with double topping next time.

Rating: 3
I used peaches and blueberries because that's what I had around and what looked good. I liked this recipe, but everyone else was more impressed than I was. I thought that it was a little plain, and the topping made it more rich than it needed to be. I did, however, make 5o% more topping per the other reviewers. Overall, this is a good recipe if you want something nice and easy.

Usually use raspberries instead of strawberries. Fresh fruit is best but recipe works well with frozen fruit too. Always add approx 1/4 cup milk to topping mixture which spreads it out and makes it crunchier. Unlike some, I love the lemon flavor.

Rating: 4
This rating is subjective: For a quick and simple dessert - this is excellent. I had some strawberries I needed to use. I only used strawberries and no peaches. And I didn't have a lemon, so I added a tad lemon juice (although I don't think you need it). There were only two of us, so I filled two small ramekins with the strawberry mixture and then topped it with the "sugar cookie" mixture (I halved the recipe). At 375, it was done in about 20 minutes. Crispy on the outside, and gooey in the middle. After about 5 minutes, I topped them each with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They were gone in 5 minutes.

I think I prefer a crisp to a cobbler. I found the topping too cake-y. I did like the lemon flavour, though.

Rating: 2
With this recipie I found out I don't like lemon and peach flavors together. I did 1 1/2x the topping and it came out nicely - sort of between a cake and a cobbler. The topping was nicely browned and delightfully crunchy on top. Perhaps I would have liked it better w/o the lemon rind.

Rating: 4
I took the suggestion of doubling the topping. I was very pleased with the results. The taste and texture of the topping was very different and delicious. I would recommend it to someone who likes to make dishes a little differently from everyone else.

Rating: 1
Disappointing. I doubled the topping, as some of the reviewers suggested, and what I ended up with was more like an cake with fruit than cobbler. Which might have been all right, except the cakey topping was completely unremarkable. I made this for a houseful of people on vacation together at the beach, and ended up throwing away the last third of it!

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious. Combination of flavors excellent. Not too many recipes feature baked whole strawberries! You could double the topping, but was fine just as written. Mine did brown in about 40 minutes, i took it out then, and the fruit was cooked just fine. I look forward to experimenting with other berry combinations.

best cobbler I've ever had! I used yellow and white peaches plus the strawberries and the flavor was delicious with the hint of lemon in the crust. Will make again and again.

I made this last night with strawberries and nectarines for guests. It was wonderful! I doubled the topping like the others suggested and used 50/50 white and light brown sugar (I ran out of white sugar). I'll definitely make it again!

This recipe was great. The peaches and strawberries I used were the perfect ripeness. I had never made this before, and learned that doubling the topping is key. The lemon is a great touch. I agree, add lemon to the fruit as well.

This recipe is mouth-wateringly delicious. The sumptiuos peach/strawberry combination is wonderful. I did double the topping and it was just right. Will make again.

Rating: 3
I tinkered just a bit, used 2 T cornstarch to make it just a tad thicker,, added 1 T lemon juice to fruit. To the topping ( which next time I would increase by 50%) I omitted the lemon and added 1/4 t cinnamon for a very subtle flavor. I love the cookie vs usual biscuit topping. This disappeared quickly, great served with peach ice cream.

This cobbler rules! I brought it to a fourth of July party last year and my friend actually licked the plate. Definitely follow instructions of doubling the crust recipe, and cooking at 350 degrees for 1/2 hour, followed by 375 degrees for 25 minutes. And use all sorts of berrys. I am trying with rhubarb this year.

Rating: 4
Lovely recipe. Tried with forzen mixed berries instead of peaches OR strawberries and also turned out beautifully, though I prefer the original recipe. Lemon for the cookie crust is KEY to overall texture! Also, made slightly more crust than recipe calls for--even *more* delicious.

Rating: 2
I wasn't crazy about this cobbler recipe. The fruit was a little too runny. The crust is very sweet & good, but you definitely need to put foil on top for the last 10 minutes or so.

This was so easy to make...and everyone whose had it absolutely loves it!

Rating: 2
This wasn't bad, but nothing I'd necessarily go out of my way to make again. The crust was too cakey, and got very brown too quickly. I remidied this by reducing the baking temperature to 350, and loosely tenting the cobbler with foil for a portion of the cooking time. I think the Peach Cobbler recipe (Gourmet, September 1999) is the better of the two, so I'll stick with that tried-and-true.

Rating: 3
Must double the crust recipe, and follow instructions of 350 degrees for 1/2 hour, followed by 375 degrees for 25 minutes. Made it with all whole strawberries. Must be served with Vanilla ice cream. I recommend using an extra deep dish or bake on cookie sheet due to bubbling up of fruit juices.

Rating: 3
This is a good desert and people seemed to really like it at our Fourth of July barbecue. I made this twice and both times the crust came out more cakey than I like and too soft. (It did have a teeny bit of crispness to the very top. Not enough though.) I was looking for more of the thick/heavy/crunchy top. The flavors are very nice though. I will continue on my quest... If anyone knows of a recipe out there that has more of a crunch pie crusty top, please let me know. Thanks!

This dish was wonderful and easy! My husband made it for our friends and they had very large second helpings! Next time we make it, we are not going to double the crust, but increase it by 1 1/2 times. Doubling seemed to be a bit too much.

This is the best peach cobbler we've ever eaten!! I only had 5 peaches, no strawberries, so decided to experiment after reading all the reviews: 2/3's of the baking dish was FRESH peaches, 1/3 was CANNED. If you don't think there is a difference, think again!!!! Use frozen if necessary, but NO canned peaches. I also doubled the crust (delicious), and cooked it for 30 minutes at 350, then 25 minutes at 375 as recommended by another reviewer = PERFECTION!! I now have a real summer keeper-recipe.

Rating: 3
Great Peach cobbler with the advice of others doubling topping recipe and cooking at a reduce temp for 1st half especially in a Convection oven. This will become a good summer BBQ recipe, a keeper.

I doubled the crust recipe as suggested and was amazed by how tangy and sweet this dessert was. I'm definitely adding it to my repertoire.

I cheated a bit as I ran out of time, so I just mixed the ingredients (doubled) for the topping together in one go, put it on top of some apples I'd heated up with brown sugar, cinnamon & butter, then put it in the oven until it looked brown. Turned out really well considering the lack of effort (and measuring) on my part! Got rave reviews and tasted really sweet and yummy.

Rating: 4
This has been become my "trademark" cobbler. I make it with a variety of fillings...apples are very nice, I omit the lemon in the crust and use cinnamon. Likewise, omit the lemon, use a dash of nutmeg, and only peaches as the filling.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe twice now...once to specifications, and once with the crust doubled; both are very good! Be sure to adjust the cooking time if you double the crust recipe, to make sure the crust is cooked through. Raspberries also work very nicely with the peaches. The flavor of the crust is excellent, and the cobbler is just as good (if not better) the next day. Enjoy!

Rating: 2
I used raspberries with the peaches, since I was out of strawberries, and the filling tasted just amazing.As for the crust, I doubled it, as suggested. And it did taste pretty good, but as other reviewers have said, it got too brown, too soon. I'll make it again, but watch the oven more closely this time.

Rating: 2
This was better reheated the next day than fresh out of the oven. I definitely wish I had followed the advice of previous reviewers and doubled the crust. All in all, a nice snack once, but not necessarily a keeper.

Great Recipe! Not a lot of work for the reward. I have made it three times, each time to rave reviews!! I have also mixed other fruits when I have run low. When short on Strawberries, I added Blueberries, and when short on peaches, I have completed it with either necturines or mangos. All substitutes have worked well.

This is a hit every time I serve it! I use fresh strawberries, but canned peaches to save time.

Good - really good - WAY GOOD! I too doubled the crust recipe, based on the other reviews. I baked it at 350 the first half and increased it to 375 the last half, again, based on other reviews, and it came out just right. I think the next time I make it I might add some almond extract or crushed amaretto cookies to the filling mixture.

Although this recipe was not bad, I have a peach cobbler recipe with a cake topping that I like much better. The cookie crust was too much for the fruit.

Rating: 3
best cobbler i've tried. crust is much better than those biscuit-like ones out there. agree that doubling the crust would be best. i reduced the sugar because i had exceptional fruit this time. i will make this again and again as different fruit comes in season. a great find!

I had the same experience as the person from Charlotte with the crust getting too brown too soon. I quadrupled the crust and doubled the fruit, so I am wondering if too much crust caused this to happen. It is delicious anyway.

Rating: 4
This was sooooo yummy. I doubled the recipe to serve 7 people and there were no leftovers. Darn, since I was hoping to have a big bowl of it all to myself the next day. Definitely make extra of the wonderful topping. Even though I doubled the recipe, I should have quadrupled the topping. I substituted raspberries for strawberries and it came out perfect. A real keeper.

Rating: 3
Hmmm...I must have done something wrong. The crust browned too quickly and I had to take it out 15 minutes earlier than the suggested bake time. I doubled the crust like others suggested-would definitely do that again. However, taking it out early didn't allow some of the peaches to cook all the way through. I thought the strawberries took over the flavor of the desert. Next time, I think I'll stick to just peaches and maybe add a little ginger to the fruit mixture. The crust is delicious, so I definitely want to try this recipe again. Hopefully better luck next time!

Very easy, and a real crowd pleaser. I added some fresh blueberries too. Everyone had seconds!

This recipe is delish. I quadrupled the crust, after reading recommendations from others, and only doubled the fruit. I used white nectarines that had been picked about a week ago and were as sweet as sweet can be. The crust is like candy. Um, getting hungry thinking about it. Think I'll go heat some up in the microwave! Thanks for the great cobble recipe!!

I made this for my boyfriends birthday party. It was a real hit. The crust is devine.

This is a really simple dessert. The cookie-crust is great. I made it for an Easter dessert so peaches were unavailable (at least not sweet enough) so I used a package of frozen peach slices. You couldn't tell the difference and I will use frozen again, even when they're in season. So simple and a vanilla ice cream is a must!

This dish was very good and very easy to make. I took Elaine's thoughts and doubled the crust recipe. It was a bit runny when served so it would be best served in a parfait glass or small bowl. Vanilla ice cream went great as suggested.

I thought this cobbler was delicious. I'm not really good at picking out fresh peaches, so I used canned peach slices and fresh strawberries. It was terrific and so much easier than cutting up the peaches!! The crust is really good. I would have liked a little more of the crust so i might double the crust recipe next time so i can add a little more to the top.I will definitely make this again!!
