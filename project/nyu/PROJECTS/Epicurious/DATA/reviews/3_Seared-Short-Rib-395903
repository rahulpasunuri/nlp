You can find the original post with different tacos and salsas here: http://www.bonappetit.com/blogsandforums/blogs/badaily/2012/06/homemade-taco-recipes.html I'm making everything this weekend for a birthday party and will update forks accordingly.

I'm with Val23. I want the recipe for the sauce as well!

Short ribs are very fatty, so it's important to stay on top of them to prevent flare ups. This is very much like the way I've seen these made in Korea. Simple but very tasty. If using really sweet onion like Vidalias, there's no need to rinse. Otherwise a quick rinse will make the onion mild enough so as to not overwhelm the taste of the meat.

what are the other ingredients shown in the recipe, and what is the sauce shown in the bowl? I would love to make this, but it seems that the full recipe has been omitted.

Wow, this meal took a lot of imagination.

unexpectedly, these were very good considering there is nothing you do to them. Never thought about using this meat for tacos. I used beef chuck ribs that were cut in 2-3 inch lengths. The rendering fat started a fire in my grill while I wasn't looking (!), so they got seared, all right. After fire was put out, finished them on low heat for 10 min.
