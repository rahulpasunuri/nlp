We just had an early thanksgiving, and seeing this recipe (being a fan of cornbread stuffing) I thought it sounded great. First off, the recipe is quite time consuming and browning the polenta in the oven took forever for some reason. The sweet sausage didn't compliment the stuffing like I expected. All in all it was quite a bit of a disappointment. I would suggest adding italian sausage that's more savory than sweet. Probably wouldn't put in the effort to make it again though...

I am also shocked by the other reviews. This stuffing is slightly more effort than a bread stuffing, but it's worth it. This is both my husband and my sister's favorite stuffing, which is amazing because they rarely agree on anything!

We loved it! Of course, the final taste depends on the kind of sausage you use. We like it very spicey. Also added a few pepperonis. I'll have to admit, I used Swiss cheese instead of parmigiano!

Our family found this to be different and delicious. I found a little pre-planing helped to eliminate some of the utensils and equipment called for.

My family loved it - you can add red pepper strips to zip up the color a bit...

I MADE THIS STUFFING AND WAS EXTREMELY UNHAPPY WITH THE RESULTS. I WILL TRY A POLENTA/SAUSAGE STUFFING AGAIN BUT NOT THIS RECIPE. IM JUST SAD I WASTED MY ALL MY DELICIOUS SWEET SAUSAGE ON THIS RECIPE.!!!!

Wow - I was surprised by the other reviews. This was a great stuffing - the guests sent back for 2nds and 3rds! I made it vegetarian, using Tofurky Sweet Sausage and Veggie Broth. I also used regular polenta and cooked longer. I also chilled the polenta for several hours. this is definitely a keeper.

Yes, you can dirty alot of dishes if you follow the directions. However, I was able to cut some of the dishes out. I think this was the worst dish I have made out of Gourmet! BUT, I did accidentally use Grits instead of Polenta. OPPS. Perhaps I should not rate this recipe? But, it was bad enough that I wouldn't try it again with polenta. I also used a sage sausage that our butcher suggested for stuffing.

The ingredient list seemed straightforward, and it sounded like a nice fall dinner with a salad. Oh, but the items required: medium saucepan, large skillet, small skillet, large bowl, small bowl, 9x13pan, 8x8 pan, slotted spoon, three spatulas, 2 cutting boards, 2 knives, one potato masher. I cut the recipe by 1/4, so that may have been my problem, but after all those pieces of equipment and steps, it was much too wet, and tasted like nothing more than sausage grits. thankfully, my husband likes grits :-)
