Delicious! We simmered canned chick-peas in chicken broth for 20 minutes before adding it to the rest of the veggies. It was great. So flavorful. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

It needs lots of salt! Also could use more spice. But very hearty and healthy. I used a calculator to get it down to what I thought was 4 servings but even then it was more like 6. So made as is, it would serve 15!

Warning: recipe "as is" will feed an army! My 3.5 quart Le Creuset is almost filled. Reduced recipe ingredients by using one 15.5 ounce can garbanzos, one 28 ounce can plum tomatoes, 1 bunch red kale, 1 large onion, 1 bell pepper. Added one chopped carrot, 1/3 leftover jalapeno, and dried chiptole. Like others added bell pepper at the end. Flavors develop the more it sits. Easy and quick to put together. Served with cornbread. Yum!

Yum. Perfect for a cold day - warmed us up during our recent snow/ice storm. Definitely use chicken broth instead of water. I also added turkey sausage, subbed red peppers for green and served with brown rice. I'll admit to being leery - kale and chickpeas just didn't sound good to me but it was delicious! Even the kids ate it!

Tasty, hearty soup. Has a pretty basic vegetable soup flavor, with a bit of spice. Good but but particularly memorable. I do enjoy the leafy kale pieces, and will likely make it again if my CSA leaves me with an overabundance of kale. The recipe as written would make an insane amount of soup, I halved it and still could barely fit it in my largest pot. I too used canned chickpeas, and served it over whole wheat couscous.

As a vegetarian, I am easily underwhelmed by most legume soup/stew concoctions--the typical beige sludges that taste okay but whose leftovers you don't look forward to. But this one is great--I've made it several times. I left out the green pepper (I don't like the dominating flavor it imparts when cooked) and instead added a handful each of carrots, parsnips, and potatoes. I make it in the afternoon and let it simmer for a few hours; it's even the better the next day, thickening beautifully. Have made it for guests and family, meat-eaters and vegetarians; thumbs up all around. It's not a thriller, but a reliable pleaser, tasty and nourishing and head and shoulders above most of its beany peers.

Made it according to the recipe except used canned garbanzos and cut the cooking time to half an hour. Next time I'll add the kale a few minutes after the onions and garlic have been cooking, and I won't add the green pepper until I add the spices, tomatoes, etc. As cwyc pointed out in their review, the green pepper gets mushy. We're vegetarians who like really spicy hot food and although this didn't burn the house down, we thought this was a good combination of heat, flavors, textures, and a very mild note of sweetness to counter the kale. We enjoyed it over couscous.

Like it, don't love it. Good hearty, nutritious meal. Wasn't particularly dazzled with it though because there wasn't much depth of flavour although adding more cumin and chili powder makes it somewhat interesting. Didn't like the green peppers in the stew because peppers don't "stew" well; turns mushy and pasty green. Needs heartier vegetables like carrots, which I added or turnips, parsnips, etc.

So easy and nutritious! Like others, I used canned chick peas instead of dried. I also had a fresh marinara sauce on hand, so I used that instead of the combination of tomatoes and paste. I had no green pepper in the house, so I skipped it and didn't find the dish suffered. I made couscous (using chicken broth instead of water) alongside. We loved it and will definitely make it again.

Excellent and very easy to make. I took one cook's advice and let it simmer 2 hours. I added carrots and celrey since they were in the refrigerator, with great results. I also used chicken broth instead of water and added chorizo for a much more vibrant flavor. Served it just plain with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese for light dinner. Kids ate it served over a small bowl of macaroni noodles. Lots of possibilites with this one.

Delicious. I like it at little less soupy, so reduce the water to more like 8 cups. Very tasty and hearty served over bulgur.

This was a very pleasant and healthy stew. It makes a rather large amount, so I would have to say that after a few meals of it I got bored. I would make it again but halve the recipe.

I like this recipe because it is a delicious, flavourful stew that is easy to make and very nutritious. I've made it before in the winter, but it is also nice to have now, in the summer when I can use fresh stewing tomatoes, and fresh sprigs of thyme and oregano from the garden. I've also added a couple sliced-up lamb shoulder chops which is probably the greatest flavour enhancer. Like other cooks, I used canned chick peas. This time around, I used celery instead of green peppers, and added some carrots. I also skipped on the tomatoe paste, but allowed it to stew longer - about 2 hours.

This is really a mild chili recipe.

In fact, I'm making it again right now! I thought this was a delicious recipe - somehow light and hearty at the same time. I added some browned tofu hotdogs, which may sound odd, but the smokyness was excellent. Maybe you'd rather try a hamhock or some bacon... I also added just a little cider vinager for extra bite. Great dish. Great for leftovers too.

This is an excellent dish. I used red peppers instead of green, and it worked out well. I did use dried chick peas because I think they have a better texture than canned. I like them crunchy, so I didn't cook them as long as the recipe suggests.

I loved this tasty, spicy dish! I used canned chick peas as well, and not as much tomato. Perfect for a cold winter day!

Great! I used canned chick peas...worked very well and made the recipe very easy. I used a Mexican spice mix as I couldn't find the chili powder in my cupboard and added a teaspoon of red pepper. It was spicy and very delicious. It is a snowy, cold day here in New England and I am very happy to have a pot full of this stew!
