good stuff! be sure that your pimientos are diced fine enough to your liking before you mix them in. 3 cloves of garlic is a lot, but I like that. I used a white cabot cheddar that is great with this. A tiny amount of powdered mustard is a nice addition. Make your own mayo and it's even better!

My third time making this. It's a good recipe for a basic pimiento cheese (which in my opinion is the best kind.) I cut the garlic in half and thought it was perfect. More would have been way too much in my opinion. I am going to try heating this under a broiler for a dip...mmmmm....

This stuff is tasty. I trim and flatten white bread (cheap, soft) with a rolling pin and spread lightly with cheese spread. Roll up the pieces of bread and pack tightly into a small sheet pan, and frost the top of the rolls with more cheese spread. Bake in 350 oven til just evenly golden and serve warm. We do a lot of tea parties and these are always a big hit.

I made this for a BBQ and It went down great, but I thought it too garlicky(I used 2 large cloves) so I added a few teaspoons of red wine vinegar. It took out some of the garlic flavor and added a bit of tanginess to it too. It was very good

To really make it adult, add a cayenne pepper to taste. My guests loved it. They ate it all and asked for more.

What makes this "adult" ???

Tasty and easy to make. Different from your regular smooth cheese spreads. I made this last minute before a party and it was a big hit. I used pre-shreded cheese - fine instead of coarse shred. Served with lavash and sesame water crackers.

This is a good start, but when I made it I added some worcestershire sauce, some diced roasted red peppers (they're more flavorful than pimientos) and a little finely chopped onion, and let the flavors meld overnight. YUM!

I refuse to eat mayo in any form, so substituted it with plain yogart and an 1/8th a teaspoon of salt, dash or two of paprika and this makes a much lighter version of the orginal. I enjoyed it!

To make this "adult," add 1/4 cup cream sherry.

Pretty common "cheese ball" recipe. My only sugestion would be to ues Wisconsin Cheddar. Not to degrade Vermont, England or Canada, but Wisconsin makes the very best cheddar cheeses you can possibly buy! The different is like the difference between processed parmesan (that stuff in the round green box/can) and real Italian Parmesano Regiano cheese. There is no comparison!

Dear Cook from Flatland: This recipe comes up when you search by "air" because of the cook's address: an Air Force base.

Tasted a lot like the cheeze whiz made to last a 1,000 years. And another thing, how come this recipe comes up when one searches the recipe data base with the key ingedient being "air"? Try it. Just wondreing.

Delicious and easy to make. I added no-fat sour cream, and it doubled as a dip.

My grandmother used to make pimiento cheese sandwiches for me. This recipe updates the classic version and tastes wonderful. It can also be put on Triscuits and melted under the broiler.

My mother made this on Thanksgiving and it was "gobbled" up. It has now become a standard in both of our homes.

This was really good, everyone loved it. Even my "doubting Thomas" husband who said I don't like pimento cheese - loved it.

Sadly, not a winner. Made this for a big party and it was the only item left at the end. A LOT left!

sounds good--my mom made pimiento cheese spread by melting 2 c. shredded cheddar cheese in 1 can of undiluted pet milk--add chopped pimientos 1 tsp dry mustard and dash of Worcestershire. I have added a shake or two of hot sauce to pep it up. will try the newer version.

My mom used to make pimento cheese sandwiches once a month when I was a kid. 30 years ago, I haven't had one since. She used Velveeta cheese, UM_UM- good and creamy. I'll have to go try this recipe, the garlic is a very interesting twist.
