It says right in the first paragraph that these cookies have a flavor combination of pecan and vanilla, yet, there is no vanilla, as far as I can see, in the recipe here or in the book.

@TOBaker Sorry for the error; it's been corrected. It now reads 6 ounces of butter. Thanks for the catch, and hope you do try Thomas Keller's recipe. -Esther Sung, Sr. Associate Editor, Epicurious.com

Four ounces of butter is NOT 170 grams. More like 117 grams.
