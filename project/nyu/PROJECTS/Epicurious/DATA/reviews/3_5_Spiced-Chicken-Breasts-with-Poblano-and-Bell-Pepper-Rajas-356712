This was a nice dish but nothing special. I always triple the spices, and it was enough. I served over brown rice. Tasty and healthy.

This was delicious and really easy to make. A few changes: Instead of using bell peppers, I used all poblano peppers and half of a hot red pepper to give it a little kick. Served just with a simple lettuce and cucumber salad for dinner on a summer night. But I bet this would be a great dish in the winter too.

This is a very tasty dish. I used ground coriander and served it with the Green Poblano Rice from this site. For troutfishing: In the 4 American supermarkets where I shop, the pepper is called 'Poblano'.

Loved this, and yes, it would make great fajitas. I used ground coriander & a chicken tenderloin and cooked the chicken & veggies all at once in 1 skillet. (I was making just 1 serving.)

This was pretty delicious, but not very hot. I would probably use a spicier pepper if I made it again. Also, the pepper name is actually called Pasilla here in America. What the Mexicans call it doesn't really matter to me. I don't call other plants by their native name, for example maize. I also crushed my own cumin, which was a bad idea.

Delicious and easy! A great way to get rid of a surplus of peppers - the coriander/cumin was very nice too. Had this with couscous.

Delicious chicken fajitas, I ate them with tomatillo (green) salsa. I'm only taking off one fork because it's not really an inventive recipe. I can see this being a family staple though.

I enjoyed the dish but next time i would use ground coriander instead of cracked. I just put the hole seeds in my spice grinder for a few seconds and it was too heavy and strong. Otherwise very good. Would definitely make the recipe as fajitas in the future.

This is a good recipe. Very similar to chicken fajitas. I agree with some of the other post where it says it is lacking something. I believe a good tomatillo salsa or guacamole would compliment the dish.

I sprinkled the chicken breasts with the seasonings and cooked them on the grill. After sauteing the peppers etc...I sliced the chicken and combined everything with the additional seasoning and lime juice--then served everything in a tortilla for a fresh, easy fajita dinner.

I've never had bad Bon Appetit recipe, however I did not enjoy this one. I followed the recipe as is, but this recipe was definitely lacking something.

One of my first Epicurious recipes I've made, and it was a success. I'm not one for spicy food, and this was well within my limited comfort zone. I'd never cooked with a poblano chile before, and I didn't love it. Sauteed it was quite bitter. The next time I make this dish, I'll likely use just bell peppers and onions. Overall, though, it was a hit with me and my dinner guests (one of which spent the last 5 months in Mexico!).
