Very yummy. Crispy toasty and seedy. I used spinach dumpling wrappers and the color contrast was very nice.

Delicious! Black sesame seeds are next to imposs-ible to find, but using all white sesame seeds works just fine. No one who eats them can stop once they start. Have given the recipe to several people and they all say it is a pain to make but worth it in the final results.

Fabulous for parties, cocktails, etc! In fact, I just finished printing out two more copies of the recipe to give to friends who tried them at one of our parties and couldn't get enough.

Made these for a party and people raved about them. I did up the kosher salt a little. These are fantastic with drinks!
