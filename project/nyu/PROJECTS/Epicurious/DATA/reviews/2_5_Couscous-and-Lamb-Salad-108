I replaced the green pepper with an English cucumber. Also doubled the amount of dressing and put half in the couscous salad - dribbled the rest over the lamb and tomatoes. Our family loved this.

We used Israeli couscous, and thought this was an excellent use of left-over grilled leg of lamb. We're not crazy over currants and left them out. This is a keeper.

A change from the normal bubble and squeak with cold lamb. Would do a couscous salad again but probably omit the chickpeas (or the lamb). Do you really need lamb, chickpeas and cheese all in one meal?
