I toasted up our leftover bread stuffing to use as filling, with some shaved medium gouda. We loved the way they tell you to cook the eggs; it gives them fantastic texture, just like the photo! But I mistakenly put 1 scant teaspoon of salt in EACH omelet -- DON'T DO THIS! -- we are now chugging water in an attempt to recover. Other than the salt, these were the best omelets ever.

A nice riff on a classic herb omelette. I have always loved gruyere omelettes, and this recipe only sweetens the pot. The parsley-garlic mixture added a nice intensity to the dish (though the uncooked garlic does threaten to overpower things) and the croutons added a nice crunch (if little actual flavour). Moreover, the recipe is much less complex than it might initially seem (I baked the croutons in the time it too to put everything else together). For once, a Gourmet recipe that didn't take longer than the estimate.
