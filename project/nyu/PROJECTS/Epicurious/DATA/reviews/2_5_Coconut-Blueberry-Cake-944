The cake turned out fine for me, but my husband didn't like it as much as a lot of other cake recipes.

You cook & you learn. . .I made recipe just like it said, and it was easy and great looking, but when cooking, the blueberry topping seemed to be too heavy. It did not raise and when done came out more like a cobbler. Definitely could not cut and serve like a cake, I had to put in bowls and top with ice cream. But everyone loved it! When I make it again I will use a smaller pan and not put on so much blueberry topping and try to swirl it into cake. I'll keep trying!
