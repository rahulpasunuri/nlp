Fabulous butter sauce. Would be great with fresh crab as well. A real keeper.

Okay so like many of the other reviewers I boiled the lobsters and didn't mess with grilling. Still, the butter was fabulous and unusual - all my guests loved it. It will be my standard lobster accompaniment.

It was a nice change instead of just garlic butter

We made this for New Year's Eve, too. I wanted something a little bit different from drawn butter. This lemon-tarragon butter was perfect -- a bit lighter and livelier, yet it didn't overpower the lobster. The tarragon and chives were just right. This was also super simple to make. What could be easier? We brought our lobsters home from the market already boiled, so all we had to do was warm this up, and start crackin'. Yum!

We made the butter sauce to accompany the boiled lobster we made on New Year's eve. Everyone loved the lobster dipped in the butter. Will definitely repeat this recipe.
