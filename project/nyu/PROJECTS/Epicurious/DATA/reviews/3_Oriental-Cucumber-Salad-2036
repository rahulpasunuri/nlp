For more pizzazz, I added 1 small garlic clove & about the same size piece of fresh ginger, both finely chopped, to the dressing. I also used only 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce. It was delish.

I will not be making this recipe again. I used cider vinegar and half sesame oil and half veg. oil. Don't wast your time with this one!

Made this a couple of nights ago, and it was really good and very easy. Don't know how "Oriental" it tasted, but everyone has his own take on what that is. When it comes to hot peppers, we are wimps. I used 2/3 of an Anaheim chile, seeded, and the white membranes removed. Used 1-1/2 Tbs. rice vinegar and 1/2 Tbs. apple cider vinegar. For the 2 Tbs. of oil I used 1/2 Tbs. of each sesame and peanut oils, and 1 Tbs. of water. Did everything else by the recipe, except for adding a healthy sprinkle of both garlic powder and ground black pepper after it was all made. I think that this would have been a 4-forker if I had made it earlier in the day, so that the flavors could have melded more while it sat in the fridge for several hours. Delicious, as cuke salads go.

I only used about 1 tsp of sesame oil and then added a couple tsp of olive oil. It really needed some more zing-so I added cider vinegar along with the rice wine vinegar. It pleased my husband and me!

A very simple, plain, yet tasty side. Used one large English cucumber, left the peel on. Served with the Sesame-Ginger Beef and Asparagus Stir Fry (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=109259). Yum!

I think this recipe is delicious; however, I used olive oil because I didn't have sesame oil the first time, and I toasted sesame seeds in the olive oil. Great addition.

I used a slicer to make my cucumbers extra thin rather than chopping them. I suggest adding some red pepper flakes (to taste) for some more flavor. It's a very delicious recipe, similar to the cucumber salad that is served with the chicken satay appetizer at BIG BOWL.

Great basic recipe.I enhanced it with some fresh cilantro and minced fresh ginger.I used 3 1/2 cucumbers and 3 jalepenos.Needs some onions and less sesame oil (I'll try the other suggestion of part peanut oil. People who don't share my love of Thai food LOVED this recipe!

Use two cucumbers and add a second Jalepeno pepper. Chill overnight for best results.
