This recipe has become a staple at my home. I make it exactly as it is. It's perfect. The addition of the sherry at the end is perfectly counterbalanced by the addition of brown sugar, so it's not too sweet or too boozy and yet very fragrant. I prefer it warm, but my husband likes it cold. It can really serve 6, but as people will undoubtly come for seconds, maybe 4 is a better count.

I made this recipe as written except I upped the amounts by half since I had 9 guests (had some leftover anyway). I put all the ingredients in a neuro fuzzy rice cooker (didn't have to watch it at all) and it came out perfect. I also used a very good cream sherry (less then 1/2 cup) and it really brought out the flavor. It is best warm as it sets up pretty quickly as it cools and gets very sticky. However, it can be rewarmed in the microwave and still have the flavor.

I don't use the sherry or the brown sugar and I use a sugar substitute and it is wonderful.

Pretty yummy, but I thought the sherry was a bit strong. Perhaps cooking it in with the pudding would soften the effect a bit. I think it was plenty sweet without the extra sugar at serving time - omitted that. Finally - I'm wondering in what universe this recipe would serve only 4 people. The servings would have to be huge.
