Lovely, simple dish! This is really fast and easy, and renders a delicious result. I tripled the recipe because I was feeding a crowd. I used half regular and half hot sausage, and only had ten sausages instead of twelve, but it seemed perfect. The hot sausage gave it a very subtle kick. A definite keeper - excellent hearty dish that scales up and transports well.

This risotto is excellent with the kale slaw from Epicurious! A fresh side with a savory main... We would definitely make again.

I used bacon instead of sausages. It was exceptionally simple and so delicious!! :) I would use this recipe again and again.!!

I used an approximate amount of chopped bacon in exchange for the sausage. This was so good I didn't even mind how I probably looked buying wine at 9am.

I thought this recipe was simple and easy to make.. However, I thought the flavors were ok.. Ive made other risotto dishes and this didnt quite hit my palette. That's not to say I wouldnt make it again

pretty good! I used sage instead of saffron... and am still trying to figure out where the other 2 tablespoons of butter are supposed to go! haha

I changed this up a bit to take it to 6 servings, and used turkey sausage and lower-calorie butter/parmesan but WOW - still very flavorful and spicy! It's very filling and reheats well for leftovers. I didn't use saffron either.

We love the flavor of this recipe even when I use less sausage to reduce fat and calories. I often serve it with ratatouille as it makes for a wonderful combination.

I made this for a small group for brunch and everyone raved about it. I doubled the recipe, but in trying to make it a healthier dish I didn't double the amount of butter and I used turkey breakfast sausage instead of hot italian. I used grated parm that comes in the green can instead of fresh parm. I didn't use saffron because I simply couldn't find it at the store. Delicious and very easy to make - will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe carefully and the result was quite good. However, I think the recipe can vary widely depending on the sausage you use. I used medium chorizo sausage (raw not smoked) but they were probably bigger than the recipe had in mind so the result was heavy on the meat and very rich. It was also salty when I didn't add any salt. SO next time I will tweak the recipe to better suit my sausages. I will also try this with other types of sausage. I can get wonderful lemon-thyme sausages that would be very good. And this is not a typical breakfast dish. I made it for dinner with a green salad.

Made this dish for a dinner group. It's my first attempt at risotto and I followed the recipe instructions. I'll try true 'risotto style' next time and use a little less parmesan. I'm definitely a fan of cheese, but wow, this sauce is rich and I think the cheese deflects the rich yumminess of the saffron. I also think the spiciness of the sausage deflects the rich sauce too, so I may try a sweet or not hot next time. This was a great treat.

This risotto was excellent - flavorful and perfect for brunch. Everyone raved. I used five sausages and a little bit more risotto - this was enough for four adults and two kids with a bit left over. Wish I had more. Also used some elephant garlic and green onions because I didn't have any onions on hand. Delicious!

Fantastic response from my breakfast diners. Only change I made was to add mushrooms and use sausage meat rather than sausages...wanted a slightly milder taste

I loved this recipe. I brought it to a brunch and it was a huge success! It had a nice spice to it from the sausage, so I would only recommend adding red pepper or something else after tasting the spiciness of your sausage. The saffron added a whole different flavor that blended perfectly into the risotto. I wouldn't change anything about it!

I added chorizo sausage and red bell pepper to this recipe to give it a southwestern flair.

This risotto was absolutely wonderful. I only had sherry and didn't feel like buying white wine, so I used it instead. I omitted the saffron because my boyfriend hates it, and subbed Pecorino Romano for Parmesan because I had it on hand. I also used chicken apple sausage instead of Italian sausage because the market ran out of everything else. Everything came together into a surprisingly creamy, tangy, sort of sweet and kicky combination. It was reasonably fast (compared to going out for breakfast), and my boyfriend loved it and was very verbal about it, which always wins me over with recipes. My only complaint is that it didn't make very much--or, perhaps we just eat larger-than-usual portions. Either way, I'd double this next time so that we'd have leftovers for multiple days of eating it. Delicious!

I have made this several times. I use half the butter and less meat. It is delicious and great for dinner as well as brunch.

Good for brunch or dinner. Try soy sausage for a vegetarian menu option (brown in olive oil, remove from pan and then add at the end with the cheese.) I added diced celery to onion, used vermouth and vegan boullion instead, and a sprinkle of dried red chili pepper. Give peas a chance! Yummy.

We really enjoyed this - the results were creamy and tasty despite the non-traditional method. Luckily, I took another reviewer's advice and used half sweet and half hot sausage - and the "heat" was just right for us. Used olive oil to cook the sausage, not butter. For my taste, this is not a breakfast dish...but perhaps for brunch it would work?

I was planning a brunch for new year's day and was getting ready to search for some recipes on Epicurious.com. Before I started searching this popped up as the "recipe of the day". It is GREAT, EASY and the hit of the brunch. In looking at the pix it appears to have chopped egg and/or corn in it, when I openned it and neither was an ingredient I too questioned the "brunch" category. Whatever time of day you serve it you will get rave reviews. I did follow their untraditional risotto preparation instructions with perfect results.

While this recipe may be tasty, it is more akin to a pilaf rather than risotto, given the method employed. Risotto uses a short grain rice due to the starch content, and the purpose of adding the liquid (preheated so as not to shock the rice) a little at a time, while stirring next to constantly, is to agitate the starch from the rice and into the liquid without damaging the grains. This is what produces the characteristic creamy texture. Risotto is generally begun with the Sofritto-- vegetables (uaually finely diced onion) sweated in butter or oil. A flavoring ingredient is usually added at this point. Raw meats can be rendered, as in this recipe, and those fats used for the Sofritto. The short grained rice is added and stirred to coat with the fat, and cooked a few minutes. Wine (preheated) can be added next, or near the end, or not at all. Next, hot stock is added a ladel at a time, only as fast as it can absorb it (more liquid will absorb at a faster rate as it cooks) while stirring nearly constantly. This will cause the rice to swell, extracting the starches and making the dish very creamy. Traditionally it is then finished--off the heat--with butter and Parmesan cheese (unless it is a seafood risotto, in which case the parmesan is eliminated). I would call this recipe "Italian Sausage Pilaf" rather than a risotto. If you plan to make this recipe, try using this risotto method for a much creamier texture.

not sure what makes this "breakfast" risotto. seems like pretty regular risotto to me. to add a breakfast spin, use breakfast sausage, and then add a fried egg to the top when serving. also, to really make proper risotto, add broth bit -by- bit as another suggested. make sure the broth is warm!!!! cold/room temp broth slows the cooking process.

I'm in the middle of making this recipe and can't figure out where the rest of the butter goes. 2tbsps in with the sausage, then where do the other 2 tbsps go??

This is delicious! I had never made risotto before as I thought it would be too labor intensive. Even though the proper method for risotto is to add liquid a bit at a time, I followed the recipe exacly and added it all at once--and it was great, with much less effort!

this was delicious. i made it last min for a brunch where i served the ham leek and 3 cheese quiche also on epi (also delicious) i thought making 2 quiches (1 veg 1 non veg) would cover all the "dietary requirements" of my guests but i live in CA so a 3rd dish was needed. i substituted cilantro for parsley (i hate parsley) and whenever making risotto you should never add all the liquid at once. liguid should be added a little at a time (1 cup) wait for it to be reduce before adding more. other than that this recipe is fool proof. happy eating.

I made this for dinner because I didn't think it sounded all that "breakfasty" and it wasn't. It also wasn't very flavorful, but that may be my fault for substituting chicken italian sausage to try to make it healthier. There are much better risottos on this site (like Risotto with Leeks, Shiitake Mushrooms and Truffles).

Truthfully I just used this recipe as an idea. We were out of eggs and needed something for breakfast so this sounded like a good alternative. I made it more like actual risotto, adding the broth one ladle at a time, etc. I also increased the amount of rice by a half a cup otherwise there would have been way too much sausage. I left out the butter as well... the fat from the sausage was more than enough. The addition of shitake mushrooms or diced fennel would also be good. Might try that with future versions.

We had a potluck at work today with a breakfast theme. Breakfast Risotto sounded just different enough. It was a huge hit. Prep was easy. I used regular chicken broth (vs. low-salt) and there was no need to add any salt. I left some at home for my kids to try and they loved it. This is a keeper!
