I didn't have any Boursin, so I substituted freshly grated Parmesan, and it was great. After reading the reviews, I felt I should do something to the sauce: chopped one yellow onion and sweated it with a couple chunks of the steak fat, butter and salt. added a tbsp of minced garlic, dry cabernet, bay leaf and a tbsp of soy sauce, then let it reduce. Turned out fantastic!

I tried this recipe last night and it was good. I changed a couple of things, we bbq'd the steaks, which left me without the scrapings to add the wine to, so I added some steak rub into the wine sauce. Turned out nicely. I cook a lot and try new recipes, my boyfriends comment "this is one of the best".

Just OK. I've had similar dishes in steakhouses before, but those dishes had a depth and complexity of flavor missing here. I was easy enough... but just so so. I'll keep looking for a better version of this recipe.

Excellent recipe! The flavors of the cheese, steak and Merlot blend perfectly. I will be making it again!

This recipe so easy and delicious...We had a Valentine's Dinner Party and served this as the main course and everyone loved it. Fabulous recipe.

The Boursin on top of the steaks was wonderful, but the sauce was disappointing. Even with the butter to finish, it was too tangy & thin. I would saute some shallots, deglaze with merlot then add beef stock & reduce the next time. As someone else mentioned, if you grill the steaks, you have no fond in a pan to flavor your sauce. If I grilled the steaks, I'd just put the Boursin on top & call it good.

It was fast, easy and very flavorful. My families tastebuds are still jumping. The Boursin was a very nice touch for the steak. I also noticed that if you like your sauces thicker. Just let the sauce stand for about 15 minutes, that should do the trick. The merlot sauce was very tantalizing and I am definitely going to use this recipe again.

I made this for dinner tonight to mixed reviews. My husband did not like the sauce but loved the cheese on top. I kinda agreed. It was good and I would make it again as it's easy but it was not a mind blower...

Figured out my issues with the sauce. Too thin and not rich enough for my taste. I would either halve the wine measurements at least and boil for a LOT longer to really reduce it down - or I might even add some demi-glace, stock, butter or something to give it that consistency and flavor a real sauce should have. Hope that helps anyone who might have the same issues as me! Keep boiling and reducing it down to it's yummy essence!

When I cook steaks I always look for ways to add more flavor because my husband thinks they are boring compared with stew or pot roast. This recipe got a big thumbs up. The recipe isn't difficult and I will definitely make it again.

I love recipes that are quick, easy and offer great flavors. You could not ask for more from this recipe. This has becomse a constant during the week when I am too tired to fuss with diner prep.

Yum! And relatively easy. I made the mistake of not cooking the steaks long enough for my 'medium' loving boyfriend, so I had to cook his a little longer, but all in all a simple and excellent recipe! The only thing I did differently was I used steak grilling seasoning. Next time I think I would BBQ and make the sauce seperately (I can understand the doneness more on the BBQ versus the skillet).

This was delicious! I cooked for only myself, and I used a filet instead. I guessed on the sauce since the recipe was for six. Doctored up the sauce with a little beef broth and it turned out perfect! Wanted seconds!

This was extremely good. Came out perfect. Also found a great recipe for ribeye steaks at www.thegrilllife.com

Excellent and easy. Nice presentation as well, with the chives fanning out of the Boursin on top. The sauce is not too bland--it needs to be eaten with the Boursin (which is melted into a blob that you can sort of spread around on top of the steak to mix it up with the merlot sauce). I nearly doubled the Boursin because there were only two of us--this helped make a sauce with a creamier consistency when mixed w/ the merlot- -the combination of flavors is quite good. More flavor in the sauce would be overpowering with the already flavorful Boursin. Served with Julia Child's "quick saute for potatoes." Overall, a must- try recipe. Fiance LOVED it.

Good and easy recipe. I grilled my steaks and the sauce outcome was fine. The boursin is a great addition but needs to be put on the steaks while they are HOT. Next time I will add some more flavor to the wine sauce - shallots, mushrooms, beef broth??

I am a novice cook, and I pulled off this recipe pretty well on two different occasions. If you stick close to the recipe, it's very tasty. Don't get too creative with your wine choice though.

It's great for cold days because it's so rich. I paired it with truffled mashed potatoes and broccoli almondine. I added shallots for a little more zing to balance out the heavy boursin.

Served this with mashed potatoes and Asparagus Amandine to rave reviews. No changes necessary.

AWESOME!!! My husband doesn't like "stuff" on his steak including cheese and sauce, but he allowed me to put the cheese on and the sauce on the side. After tasting the sauce, I looked over to see his steak swimming in a pool of sauce which is decided was well worth dumping on top. That says a lot for how great it was. I didn't find the merlot sauce bland, but it wasn't overwhelming either which is a perfect balance for me. If you want a stronger sauce, try something else, but this was a tremendous combo. We served with baked sweet potato and roasted garbanzo's with swiss chard (try this one, it was shockingly wonderful).

Love the Boursin idea on top of the steaks, however, despite what many others seem to say I was not too impressed with the sauce. Search for Ribeyes in Red Wince Sauce on Epicurious and I promise that is some of the best sauce you'll make for any steak. Although both are similar, the ribeye sauce is lick the pan good!! I also prefer to use a smaller cut of meat when sauteing, rather than a 1 in. thick or larger piece of meat. About 1/2 in. or even thinner is perfect and super quick! Next time I will try some Boursin on my Ribeyes with Red Wine sauce - I'm serious you have to try that recipe, it's phenomenal and so quick!

This steak recipe, paired with the baked potato, creme fraiche and chives, is a knock-you-on-the-floor, do two hail marys and weep like a small child FANTASTIC combination. I highly recommend that all steak lovers try it.

I loved this.. but I have a question. I only made 2 steaks. They were a bit thicker. I trimmed all the excess fat... and found there was very little "dripping" in the pan. It was still very tasty, but I'm wondering if I cut too much fat or not enough oil in the pan? Any help out there?? Thanks.

WOW! this steak dinner was on of the best i have had in a long time! it was o simple and easy , and very delicious! The Boursin just tops it right off! i'm only 14 years old and i could make by my self super easy! i would definatley recomend this recipe

Just made this for Valentine's Day dinner. It was fast, easy and delicious! Made it with 2 larger NY Strip steaks, but other than that pretty much stuck to the recipe. Also added chopped shallots to the wine while it was reducing as I think somebody recommended. Also used fresh ground pepper and sea salt on the steaks. While the Boursin was a bit expensive, I thought it was well worth it. We paired the steaks with sautéed mushrooms (cooked with a little balsamic and some of the wine), and fresh green beans boiled with onions and garlic. The rest of the bottle of wine we drank with dinner.

If my husband were reviewing this he would have given it 4 stars. I also thought it was very good, but I found my palette was depending on the boursin with each bite as the wine reduction added little flavor. The prep of the steak is right on and is the way I typically do them during winter monthes. Next time I will just saute some shallots and garlic in evoo/butter before adding the wine. The wine does reduce quickly so make sure to watch it or you'll end up with too little to adequatly drizzle over all the steaks.

I made this dish last night with a warm spinach salad and a few king crab legs- my husband loved. I did cook the steaks a bit lohger as we are not fans of red meat (5 min each side) and it was perfect. I did substitute with camembert instead of boursin due to availability. To make up for the loss I used fresh garlic in the sauce and garlic and herb butter. We host a lot so I plan to make this again soon.

Made this for the first time for guests. Certainly not something I would usually do, but the recipe seemed fairly sound. Amazing steak! We had really thick NY strips and only 4 of them. I should have used kosher salt as a more course salt would have aided the flavor of the steaks a bit more, but the sauce and cheese was fantastic. Guests swore it was better than what they could get at a restaurant. e had 2 toddlers at the table too who ate it up, with sauce. This is going to be a main staple in entertaining.

This is more a question than a review. Can 1 1/2 cups wine be reduced by 2/3 in 5 minutes or do I need a new stove?

This one is up there with the best. Very fast and easy. I used cab instead of merlot. Next time I might try shallots, garlic, and/or mushrooms with the wine reduction for a variation. A must try!

Just tried the recipe. It was very good. The only thing I would change is cooking the meat a bit longer. I was surprised (not being a professional cook and all) on how rare to med. it was. I will cook the recipe again, but for probably 5 1/2 minutes on each side to actually get to medium.

To the cook from London, England....a NY steak is the same as a sirloin or a striploin. The recipe calls for you to keep the pan juices, but you have to combine the juices from one pan with the other (the recipe directs you to use two pans for 6 steaks). The juices are the goodness...don't discard the goodness!

This was yummy. I had a steak that was too thick, but worked it out. This was super quick.

Good recipe. If grilling steaks - saute shallots and sliced shitake and criminis then you can deglaze and still have that beautiful sauce. I also like a touch of beef stock with red wine.

Rating: 0
Can someone tell me what cut is a 'New York' steak? It looks like a sirloin which I find a bit tough when fried but I guess I could use any cut (ie fillet!) Also, is it necessary to discard the pan juices before making the sauce? Surely the juices would make it even tastier.

Rating: 4
Very good, though I prefer NY strip grilled. As an alternative, try it with garlic rubbed flank steak pan fried to med rare in a tiny amount of olive oil; remove steak to rest, add generous butter and minced shallot, saute, then wine, and finish with butter when reduced. Sliced 1/4 inch thick and parsley dust before presentation.

I made this for New Years eve and it was a big hit. The Boursin was a perfect compliment-- softer than a blue cheese. I had an open bottle of cabernet from the previous night and used that instead of the merlot-- the wine sauce was delicious. Definitely special enough for entertaining and very easy to make.

We had the steak on Christmas eve along with the deep fried french fries and garlic/mayo/mustard sauce that suggested "go withs" in the magazine article. A perfect combo. I used a little of the mayo sauce on my steak and it was even better than the boursin sauce.

I made this at the last minute one night for supper because I happened to have some Boursin in the fridge. It was fantastic and my neighbor who happened to be over said it tasted like an upscale restaurant recipe. Next time I would decrease the butter in the Merlot sauce by half and it should still be great. I also grilled the steak instead of pan-frying it.
