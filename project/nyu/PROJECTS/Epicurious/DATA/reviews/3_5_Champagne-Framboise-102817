This was very pretty and fine tasting, but nothing out-of-this-world. I used Lindmann's framboise and Korbel's brut rose champagne.

Have been serving this for years at holiday get-togethers and it is always well received! Very easy to do, and different enough from "plain" champagne to make it interesting.

Very pretty and very delicious.
