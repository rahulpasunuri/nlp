It definitely doesn't take a special "palate" to like this cake. The simple flavors of fresh, mild olive oil, toasted hazelnuts, and naturally sweet chestnut flour combine perfectly. I found that the extra sugar was unnecessary, so I omitted it. The cake had a great texture, and cooked perfectly on top and in the middle. The main problem is that the bottom and sides burned about 1/2 way through baking time. Not sure why this happened - I have an oven thermometer so I'm sure the oven was at 350. Should I place the springform in a pan of water next time? Or butter, instead of oil, the pan? Turn down the oven temp?

Good texture for a GF cake. but I just didn't find the flavour to be appealing. I used EVO, and otherwise good quality ingredients. It was my first try at using chestnut flour which I had picked up at Granville Island market; normally I enjoy the taste of roasted chestnuts. Maybe like the first reviewer, I just don't have the palate.

This recipe has become a favorite of mine. I originally discovered it after finding chestnut flour in a local Italian market and couldn't resist even though I had no idea what I would do with it. Since finding this recipe I've used up the whole bag making this cake. I love the flavor both the honey and olive oil add. The only thing I have added to it is pouring a layer of chocolate ganache over it. I've been making it for friends for their birthdays... it serves as the best cake for a someone with gluten issues. Better than any special gluten free mix you might find.

This is a great cake for chestnut lovers such as myself. The first review is comical. This cake does not require a Piemontese palate (you should be so lucky) or an acquired taste. Even an unrefined palate would find this cake delicious if quality ingredients are used. The "local" Italians have some of the best quality oils in the world, why would they need anything else?? Use a fresh bottle of Wesson if the idea of olive oil disagrees with your Main Street USA palate.

EXCELLENT recipe. Very good as a desert, but would also be great for an afternoon snack with tea. If serving as desert, I would recommend adding some lightly sweetened whipped cream. I was surpised by how good this was. Note that I increased by 50% for a slightly larger springform pan and had no problems. I'll definitely make this again. IN RESPONSE TO THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER: The 'off', 'fishy' taste described could come only from your olive oil, which was either too strongly flavored, rancid, or just of poor quality. I used a fairly expensive bottle EVO, namely ROI Carte Noire, and my results were great.

This cake's texture is just fine: moist but not wet, dense but light enough. Problem is what my husband and I can only describe as an "off" taste -- to my palate, sort of fishy. Perhaps this is part of the ethnic thing that one is said to develop a taste for, and we have yet to try it with vin santo, the wine that's said to complement it. We think, though, that we'll try it again, only with peanut oil, or perahaps a combination of peanut and sesame oils. (Who knows? A little toasted hazelnut oil? Shot of Frangelico?) Our palates our not Piemontese. Peanut and sesame flavours strike us as more congenial with the warmth and sweetness of the chestnut flour. Perhaps the local Italians would have used these oils if they had had them?
