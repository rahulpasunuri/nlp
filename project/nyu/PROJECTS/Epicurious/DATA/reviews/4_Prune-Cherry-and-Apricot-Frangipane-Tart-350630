Fantastic! Everyone loved it. Doubled recipe - making two - and used all prunes marinated in cognac for 36 hours.

No grappa so used vokda. Came out exactly like the photo. Delicious with a buttery flaky crust. Looked professionally made!

Made to RAVE reviews. Best was from my french neighbor who said (without the fruit) was an exact replica of what they served in France with a trinket hidden for New Years king/queen. I made first time with marinated tart & sweet cherries (not dried) Tonight making again with no fruit with the trinket inside.

I made this for a friend's dinner party tonight. Rave reviews from everyone, even those who say they don't like sweets or desserts. I had a few, minor changes. My dried cherries were nowhere to be found, so I added extra apricots and plums to make up the difference. These were prepared two days in advance, using Slivovitz instead of Grappa, as per another reviewer's advice. I loved the extra plumminess it imparted. When the liquor called for did not come close to covering the fruit, I added another 1/4 cup with a tsp of honey. Next time I will not half the plums... it didn't seem necessary. Maybe the organic plums I purchased were quite small? I used my half of my favorite dough recipe, not the one linked to this one. I had a 9 inch tart pan, so added two 'individual' tart pans, with plenty of dough and filling to go around. The large tart was devoured at the party, and we now have the two tiny tarts to nosh on later. As with many things, a little advance work made it very simple to put together the day of. I'll be making this again and again.

My guests loved this tart. Used a gluten-free pie recipe from Bette Hagman. Thought the grappa was too expensive & will try something different to soak the fruit.

Made it with pears instead of the fruit compote and loved it

Great! Gorgeous! Easy! Grappa is quite expensive, and I agree with previous reviewers about using more - like 3/4 c - for the compote, so I have substituted both Slivovitz (a type of "moonshine", as grappa is, but made with plums instead of grapes) and/or cognac with excellent results. It's a beautiful dessert from ingredients that are available any time of the year, and as other reviewers have mentioned, can be mostly prepared in advance (though best eaten same day once baked. Not a problem, as you will see.)

If you are concerned about the fruits not absorbing enough Grappa, you might wish to pour boiling water over the apricots to cover (and reconstitute) for one-two minutes. Drain, and then continue as directed.

Perfecto!

This was excellent. I had never had Grappa, but found it for this recipe. I made it twice, the second time substituting a pate sablee recipe for the crust recipe given. It is simply excellent! I will be making this for special occasions many more times to come.

This was so unusual and fabulous! It was devoured at the brunch I brought it to. I changed the proportions a little to fill a 13 inch tart pan, since it was for a big crowd. Used 1 cup grappa, 5 Tbsp sugar, a generous half cup prunes, and a scant half cup cherries and apricots. For the crust, I used a little more than half the pastry recipe - maybe 5/8 of it. For the filling, I increased everything by half again as much. It made the perfect amount of filling, fruit, and syrup, and was so pretty! I didn't think it was a particularly difficult or time-consuming dessert if you spread the work over a few days. Started the fruit 3 days ahead - that only takes 5 minutes. Made the tart dough and baked the shell the day before, and made the filling and finished the tart the day of serving - took only a few minutes to prepare the filling. Cooked the large tart at 350 (with convection) for 31 minutes - perfect.

This was exceptional. It takes a lot of planning, but is well worth it. I couldn't find grappa, so used a Mirabelle eau de vie. This was a phenomenal Christmas dinner dessert.

oh, and for the pastry dough recipe, you only use half the dough that the recipe produces. Just FYI.

What a wonderful, wonderful dessert. It's as beautiful as it is tasty. I only had 1/2 c of grappa, so I rounded it out with some white rum, and it was great. Mmmm. So worth the effort it took to round up all the ingredients (grappa is illegal here...seriously) and the multiple stages of preparation. A showstopper.

Wow is all I can say. Made this for Thanksgiving- wanted to do something "different". Next time we will macerate the fruit for 2 days...the apricots didnt soak up the grappa as well as the other fruits. All that said, this was an amazing addition to the Thanksgiving feast roster and will become a staple for many years to come. The frangipane flavor with the tart/sweet of the dried fruits was most memorable. Don't even think about not making this!

This recipe is a keeper. Real crowd pleaser (although I would say it is for more sophisticated eaters). I increased the grappa to 3/4 cup and that gave me plenty of syrup. I also went a little heavy with the apricots because I happent to like them. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I know that I will be making this again. It took a little advance planning, but overall it was an easy recipe. The pastry dough recipe provided on a link is excellent. I used it for all of my Thanksgiving pies.

Yesterday, I tested the recipe on my housemates, wanting to preview it before I made it for an event this weekend. It looked great and tasted phenomenal. Loved it so much I've already started on another one. The flavors compliment each other wonderfully, texture is superb, and not a crumb was left. Couple things: 1/ I macerated the fruit for 3 days. I found the 2/3 cup of grappa to not be enough in order to have syrup left over to brush the final product. So, this 2nd time I increased to 3/4cup. Maybe if only macerating for 1 day the org. qty is best. 2/ Don't skimp on pie weights for the shell. I thought using rice would work the same - no. The shell tasted fine, but it bubbled and took much longer to bake. overall, the amount of time it took to make was worth it.

Just wanted to come back here and put in my two cents again-- I have now made this show-stopper a few times, each time dreading the long process... but EVERY time it's been worth it. It is now my Mom's favorite desert and I am proclaimed brilliant by each person lucky enough to have gotten a slice (with a dollop of whipped cream on it, of course:).

This dessert was amazing. Easy, stunning to look at, and incredibly delicious. I will definitely make this again - many times. This was the first dessert to disappear on Christmas day. It's the best!

This was very very good. I found grappa (Julia, as recommended) in my well-stocked liquor shop. It took a while to make, but was really simple and delicious:)

This dessert will impress and delight your guests. Even prunophobes--I'm not a fan--will totally enjoy the flavors. Grappa was difficult to come by here in Madison--and the tiny bottle I found was way too expensive ($45) for my budget--so I used Kirsch ($25), which is made from cherries, instead. Make the syrup and soak the dried fruit for as long as you can. You'll want to make the frangipane filling over and over again.

I made this tart for Thanksgiving and it was absolutely amazing! I used a pear brandy instead of the grappa, and it worked wonderfully. I also made a second batch of the pastry dough later in the week and used it for turnovers and turkey potpie.
