There wasn't nearly enough cookie dough to get the size and number of cookies listed in the recipe. Cooking time was way too long -- possibly because I made the cookies smaller to get the 18 cookies listed in the recipe. I would make this again and start checking for doneness at 8 minutes.

Agree with so many of the previous reviews, a darn good cookie that basically can be tweaked for any taste preferences. Did not find this too sweet at all, the flavor of the granola is really predominant here. Dried fruit, say cranberries, would be an excellent addition; and depending on the granola used I would add some cinnamon, ginger, or nutmeg, for depth of flavor. Just a nice, easy recipe that amps up the original Toll House recipe. BTW: my local grocery has a very reasonably priced granola which tastes great on its own and really good in this recipe.

Really yummy. I used white whole wheat flour, homemade granola, all brown sugar and smart balance olive oil butter. Texture is great, flavor is great.

Great simple cookie - substituted chocolate chips with Craisins and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar with Splenda Brown Sugar Blend using conversion chart on Splenda package.

this cookie is only going to be as good as the granola you use. I use my own homemade granola which had lots of fruit and nuts. I made them with a store bought granola once and they were nothing special.

Yes, all it really is is a variation on chocolate chip cookies; that said, I still love these cookies. I bake the cookies at 350 because my first batch burned on the bottom. That may be due to my oven, or the fact that I throw in quite a bit more granola than the recipe calls for. As for the chocolate, I was low on chocolate chips so I chopped up a 70% cocoa bar I had and it was fabulous. I have come to appreciate these cookies more than traditional oatmeal cookies. Also, I make my own granola, full of nuts and dried fruit. That way you can really help to control the sweetness and quality of ingredients that go into your treats. Play with the recipe and I bet you will be won over.

I cut out the white sugar, and they were still way too sweet. I used homemade maple granola, and will continue to play with this recipe, because I like that it's a smaller batch.

These were EASY and fast to make. My family loved them. I added dried blueberries, raisins, cranberrys and blackberries. I used half the amount of mini chocolate chips. they were gone the day I made them! Good, FAST, and easy.

I loved these cookies. I added granola with pecans and an additional 1/2 cup of pecans.

What a waste of some fabulous granola! These cookies are nothing special. Basically, they're just plain old chocolate chip with a bit of granola instead of some of the flour. Yes, my kids ate them, but they'll eat almost any cookie. Would not ever make these again.

This cookie was way too sweet. I used Bear Naked Granola from Costco, which by itself is wonderful, but I will continue my search for a granola cookie that tastes more like the granola I eat in the morning without the milk. Thanks.

Great cookies! I doubled the recipe and used half whole wheat flour. Also added some (1/4c.) ground flax seed to the granola and chppoed walnuts. Both modifications were imperceptable to my children who devoured the cookies. Next time I will try substituting apple sauce for some of the butter. Would love to hear from someone who had aleady tried the applesauce for butter variation.

Great cookie idea. I make my own maple pecan granola so this cookie was really tasty. I made a double batch for my son's class at school and they loved the crunch of the granola. I also added peanut butter chips! Lorrainesfav@aol.com

Delicious! A great variation on the traditional chocolate chip or oatmeal chocolate chip cookie.

These are very simple, yummy cookies. The recipe yields about half of what I'm used to for chocolate chip cookies, but it's a nice size for a smaller household.
