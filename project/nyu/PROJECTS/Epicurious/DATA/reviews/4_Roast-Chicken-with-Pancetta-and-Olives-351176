I've made this dish for company, for holidays and for the two of us. It's tasty and goes so well with the broccoli rabe and sausage and polenta!

This is the most delicious thing I've eaten in a while, and I eat tasty sh*t all the time. Really, really great combo of flavors. I cooked it for slightly less time than suggested, but I was only cooking a leg and a thigh, so perhaps that's why. Stop reading reviews and make this right now.

I make this regularly using 10 skin-on chicken thighs and maybe a little extra thyme, rosemary etc. It is easy and fool-proof and everyone loves it. I know it's time to make it again when I start to hanker for the taste of oil-cured black olives.

This recipe is worth making simply for the mouth watering smell that will fill your home. I live in a small NYC apartment and my neighbors actually came knocking asking what I was making. So delicious, so much flavor, so easy. The best part is that the recipe only calls for 1 cup of wine, which is my green light to go ahead and enjoy the rest of the bottle (with friends) while I cook. YUM.

Wow! Wish I could give it 5 forks. Cutting up the chicken wasn't as gruesome and difficult as I expected; I won't mind doing it again. We skipped the pancetta the second time we made it and didn't miss it.

This is one of my family favorites. I use the left over chicken to make the best homemade chicken soup ever.

Easy to make and delicious. Used palmful of capers instead of olives as well as a handful of pearl onions. Would love more pancetta - but then again who wouldn't? Served with green salad and baguette to sop up the yummy sauce. This one is firmly "on the list".

ok, i have to admit that i'm impressed. it was fuss free and delicious. i couldn't find pancetta and just used regular bacon. i used chicken legs which worked really well.

I have made a number of variations on this recipe (with proscuitto when I asked my husband to get the wrong thing; for a dinner party with boneless breasts instead of whole chickens, tonight with legs and thighs and applewood smoked bacon) and all are delicious. You can skip the thyme if you only have rosemary and frankly, I almost like my "mistake" version with proscuitto better - the little bits of ham get so nice and crispy. It's so good it's hard to believe how easy and flexible this dish is.

Rating: 4
Shocking how simple this was to make, prep took me a little while as I'm no culinary master. It came out absolutely perfect. Moist, exploding with flavor. I went ahead and bought the chickens pre-cut to save me some time. If you love pancetta and garlic I would advise you to basically double the amount of both in the recipe; that's what I'm going to do. Not nearly enough pancetta, and it could have used more garlic.

This recipe received a "wow" rating from my ultra-picky teenage son, plus a "please make this again." I used boneless, skinless thighs and cut down on the cooking time accordingly. Also used kalamata olives at the suggestion of other reviewers, and about half the salt.

Rating: 4
Fabulous and even better the next day. I used a clay cooking dish and halved everything as I only baked one chicken. This is definitely going into my regular rotation.

Rating: 1
What a mess! Though I drizzled it very carefully, the wine of course popped and splattered like crazy when it met the hot chicken fat. And by the end of cooking the pancetta and garlic had both begun to burn, filling my kitchen with smoke. I've been using epicurious for a long time and this is my first ever negative review - very disappointing!

Rating: 4
Before cooking, I placed the pancetta and garlic under the skin of the chicken, and cooked as directed. Before removing from the oven, I put on the broil for a few minutes to crisp up the skin (delicious!) Like others have noted, I cut up yukon potatoes and placed them in the pan, and also added some blanched brussell sprouts towards the end to add some veggies and color. Also, I did not add any salt because the olives (I use kalamata) and pancetta provide the right amount of salt .

Rating: 3
A good recipe. I made with thighs and cut down to scale. This time it did it in a small pyrex dish and wound up pouring out the fat -- next time will follow the recipe and put in a shallow pan. Made with roasted squash with pancetta (complementary, I think) mixed with Israeli couscous. Nice!

I made this for my mom's birthday dinner! She loved it, and so did everyone else! I couldn't find oil-cured black olives, so I used Kalamata, which were excellent in this dish! Other than that, I didn't change a thing. Will definitely make again!

Rating: 4
Outstanding recipe. I used pitted, oil cured olives for ease of eating and I doubled the pancetta, cutting it into 1/2" pieces. Also, after cutting up the chicken, I skinned it.I served this with a wild mushroom risotto. Absolutely delicious.

Rating: 4
Oh man this was so delicious and so easy! I could see adding some veggies like brussel sprouts or potatoes next time. I used regular kalamata (not oil-cured) b/c they didn't have those at the store and they were still fabulous- I would also suggest green olives as well. My other tweak to the recipe was by accident- I roughly chopped the garlic and noticed some of the smaller pieces were staring to burn during the cooking- so I slid them into the wine sauce and they came out perfect. This recipe is a keeper. I do wonder, though, if using skinless chicken would work- just to try to make it a tad healthier (but I'm not willing to give up the pancetta!)

Rating: 4
This recipe was easy to follow and the results were flawless, it's going on my regular winter rotation! I used all chicken thighs (bone- in/skin-on) and a mixture of oil cured black olives with kalamata olives. Next time I would remove the pits from the olives and halve the flesh so that people could enjoy them more. I think I caught a couple of guests off guard with the unpitted olives. I also added a handful of sage leaves because I was serving this along with a butternut squash ravioli, brown butter sage sauce. I like the flavors to marry and blend and I usually crossover a few herbs. I think I impressed my husband, who is overly spoiled with my nightly cooking. It was the chicken, I typically don't do a lot of meat centered meals. Follow the recipe exactly and you'll get a moist chicken. I was amazed, considered it cooked so long uncovered in the oven. I will add that I did wrap the pan in foil and kept the dish in the cooling oven until it was time to serve. And use a pretty roasting pan if you're going to serve it on the table, when it comes out of the oven it is simply gorgeous!

Very good and pretty easy. Used 2.5lbs of thighs instead and thick-cut bacon instead of pancetta as I had it on hand. Halved all the ingredients. Bacon worked alright, though didn't crisp up as much as I would have liked. Very moist, usually don't like breasts but they would have worked well here. Took a little over my 1 hour limit for cooking but worth it!

Fantastic recipe. Used 12 thighs and 1 breast, skin-on/bone-in split. I added Brussels sprouts at the start and reduced the salt to 1/2 tbsp. This recipe is a keeper and will find itself in our rotation.

Used all thighs to keep the hubby happy. Added brussels sprouts (halved) plus quartered red potatoes with the wine. When done, removed chicken, put veggies in seperate dish & crisped in the oven while I made gravy from the drippings. Removed quite a bit of the oil from the drippings prior to reducing & adding a bit of cornstarch & water. Hubby said it was the best chicken I ever made. A keeper.

First time I have used Epicurious. Food went down a treat with the family. Straight forward recipe. I did chicken breasts instead of smaller pieces. Worked well. I slided the breasts a little to allow the flavour get in. I also used green and black olives. Very nice.

I love making this chicken during the winter. It has such nice flavor and is easy to make, but you have to be aware of how long the chicken is cooking, or it will become dry. It is one of my son's favorite meals because he likes the crispy skin.

This is one of those dishes I like to make a lot. It smells soooo good with the garlic. There is usually a lot of liquid left over so I add it to rice or risotto if making as a side dish. I tossed the juices with a side of escarole once and that was really good too.

This is our current favorite chicken recipe. The first time I made it, I couldn't remember whether it called for pancetta or prosciutto, so I bought the latter (Boar's Head Piccolo Prosciutto)and it gave the dish amazing flavor. I agree that smoking is an issue so I used a roasting pan instead of a flat sheet. My husband always asks me to make extra so he can take it for lunch the next day.

Rating: 4
This is wonderful! Served for a rustic Italian themed dinner party and used 12 thighs and 5 drumsticks. I found it a tad salty with the pancetta and olives so next time I will decrease the salt to 1/2 - 3/4 TBSP. I love the idea of adding potatoes to the pan and will try that next time as well. Served with creamy polenta (Michael Chiarello's recipe) and green beans with shallots. Fantastic!

For years I have tried recipe after recipe to get chicken this moist and flavorful. Finally I have found it. My whole family enjoys this dish which is very unusual. I do change one thing, I add peeled chunks of potato with the raw chicken and that makes a complete meal. They come out like roasted and sometimes I add carrots. Delicious.

Great recipe. Great dish for entertaining. Always a crowd pleaser. Easy to make. Very flavorful. Always follow recipe exactly which is rare for me! I have drank many different wines with this from Chianti to Gewurztraminer. All were good but my current favorite is a White Riesling since I believe it lets the flavors of the chicken shine through.

This is a winner. One of those dishes where everyone that takes the first bite comments how wonderful! Followed this recipe to the letter. Easy to do. Assembled ahead up to the point of laying it out in the pan. Covered and refridgerated until ready to pop in the oven when guests started to arrive. Will definitely make again.

Overall once it was cooked the chicken was moist and flavorful however with the high heat (perhaps my oven runs a bit hot, not sure) and the bacon fat there was a lot of smoke, that even our oven fan could not keep up with, when the wine was added the alcohol caused a small flare. Next time I will just grill the chicken and ovoid the smoke and fire drama!

This is one of those magical recipes that tastes a lot better than it's simplicity would suggest. Used all half chicken breasts on the bone with skin, and cleavered each in half again. Tossed the chicken pieces with the oil, herbs and garlic in a bag and refrigerated overnight. Served with the pan juice - which is absolutely beautiful. Served for alfresco Easter family lunch with Braised Fingerling Potato Coins, Green Beans with Celery Salt, and Maple Horseradish Glazed Beets (for colour). Pavlova of my own imagination for desert. Made extra of everything. All was devoured to raves and leftover beets sent home with the family beet fan.

This was great! Very easy to make, with basic ingredients, and the flavor was out of this world! I'd serve polenta next time, to sop up the wonderful broth. Only caveat--made this with Amish free range chickens, and they don't have enough fat to roast at high temps! The meat was tough. Be sure to use a fat bird!

This recipe has great bones. I just used what was on hand, no olives but I used small grape tomatoes. The chicken was crispy and everything concentrated, caramelized and tasted fantastic. I used all dark meat because it's harder to overcook and tastes better (to Me.)

This dish is a great go-to recipe. I used what I had in my kitchen and substituted the pancetta with bacon, white wine with sake and it translated very well. The sweetness of the roasted garlic with the briny olives were a great compliment to the chicken. Perhaps a tad salty, so I will adjust this next time. Also if using bacon, add it later so it doesn't overcook.

Rating: 4
This was my first attempt at cooking -- period. This is an excellent recipe -- idiot-proof. The chicken was tender and savory. We served it with broasted red potatoes and fresh green beans. My wife and two adult children raved over it. It will hard to mantain this level of excellence. Didn't change one component of the preparation.

Rating: 2
I should have trusted my instincts rather than the recipe when making a half-version of this for dinner last night. Cutting all ingredients by half, it still seemed excessive to me to use 1-1/2 tsp of sea salt, in addition to the saltiness from olives and pancetta. Perhaps it was the fact I used Kosher chicken, already treated with a salting process, that made the dish overly salty. Other than that, the technique and cooking time produced the result promised. Will consider making this again, but wiser now about the seasonings.

Awesome awesome dish. Besides the fabulous flavour (and only thing I'd do differently is more wine and more pancetta) was how easy it was to make. The timing of it was perfect to make all kinds of accompaniments so your time in the kitchen is maximized.

Truly an amazing and easy recipe! I used chicken breasts with ribs, which makes an easy single serving. Followed directions as written, except substituting dry Vermouth instead of white wine (Julia Child's trick) and upped quantity to probably 1 1/2-2 cups. You could add any amount of garlic you'd like. Second day leftovers heated up uncovered in oven were even better, as flavors completely married in the juices, and olives were milder [I think you could even try this as a pull-out-of-the-fridge dinner]. Meat is as moist and delicious as any I've ever had! Definitely will make again!

A winner! Stupid easy and crazy delicious. First time I made this with roasted baby red potatoes and the Portobello Mushrooms with Goat Cheese. Mushrooms were not a good match- too highly seasoned for the chicken. Made again the other day, again with the potatoes plus steamed broccoli sprinkled with Pecorino Romano cheese- perfection!

This was wonderful! Great flavor and super easy. I used 4 breasts cut in half and 4 thighs. I served it with polenta with thyme and fontina (also on this site) and spinach with garlic and lemon. It makes a beautiful presentation. I will definitely keep this one around!

mmm... very good. I used seven skin-on bone-in chicken thighs that i had in the freezer and didn't have any oil-cured olives, so just used the kalamatas i had in the fridge. I was a bit worried about reading other reviews that the oven would get messy and the house would get smoky, but didn't have that problem at all. i used a deeper pan, like a lasagna roaster. i was also worried about the high heat, but the end result was perfectly brown, nothing burnt, delicious! the only thing is that using the chicken thighs made the dish rather greasy, but everything else was good. quick, easy, and delicious!

Thr best roast chicken we have had in ages.I used small fryers 2.5lb each and the result was tender juicy chicken in a wonderful pan saucw with slightly salty and crunchy pancetta.I have used italian oil cured olives and kalamatras with equally deliscious results. I urge everyone to thr this one

Fantastic! I've made this twice in 3 weeeks (I almost never repeat a recipe in less than 6 months.) The chicken is so tender and juicy, and the flavors are out of this world. One caution, go LIGHT ON THE SALT! Pancetta and olives add enough and concentrate in the sauce. Also, I use more wine to make more sauce. First time used chicken thighs, second time, cornish game hens--both were great. Seved once with polenta and once with wild rice. Husband is a bird hunter (love him anyway) so am going to try this recipe on pheasant, I don't think it could go wrong. Also like that the hands-on time is minimal.

Oh my, this was good! I used thighs & regular black pitted olives. Had to use them up. It is easy, smells soooo good & looks impressive. Next time I may add mushrooms when I add the olives. A keeper for sure!

Have made this twice now and it is our new fabulous dinner party meal because it is so easy. 7 lbs fit very snuggly on a 18x12 sheet pan. Don't worry if it is crowded. Used Teruzzi and Puthow 2005 Vernaccia white wine which is very dry. Also poured the juice into a fat separator, then reduced to make a nicer gravy. Served with Baked mashed potatoes with Parmesan Cheese and Bread crumbs, and Roasted Marinated Portobello Mushrooms (I used white button mushrooms and both recipes are from food network). I have also served this with Fettuccine with Brown Butter and Feta. It's all delish!

Exceptional recipe -- was skeptical about the high oven temp and length of time, but the chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy, and tremendously flavorful. I used more pancetta than called for (and would probably use still more next time, along with a few more garlic cloves), and for the white wine used a 2001 Far Niente Chardonnay (the only white wine I had in the house), which may account in part for the superb taste (we drank the rest with the meal, and it was fantastic).

Absolutely AWESOME. My sister and Husband licked their plates. Let the oil mixture sit on the chicken for a few hours to increase flavour. Also expanded the sauce by adding some reduced sodium chicken stock and reducing while the chicken rested. Served with wilted spinach and pan fried homemade gnocchi.

WARNING: My first batch of this recipe isn't done yet, but if you are in the habit, as I am, of substituting vermouth (alcohol content 18 percent) for dry white wine (alcohol content 13 percent), you may end up with an oven full of flames. I did.

I made this receipe last night with my husband. I had the butcher cut up the chicken, so it was the perfect size to be cooked in this receipe. I agree with a prior review that it did not fit in one sheet pan, I cooked in two totally different batches so that the pan was in the proper position in the oven. I switched out the olives for Kalamata Olives, I do not care for oil cured. It was absolutely fantastic!!

Yum! My daughter made this for us as I was out of commission with a broken right wrist. Easy enough for a beginning cook (if you use already-cut- up chicken pieces), but tastes like it came from a pro! The kitchen got really smoky and I had to clean my oven the next day, but it was worth it.

My new most favorite chicken recipe. Made as written but halved the recipe as there were only two of us. Used a quarter sheet pan for one chicken. Easy to make, could deal with other dishes while chicken roasted. Chicken was moist with terrific flavor, loved the crispy pancetta and the sauce.

This was excellent. I bought two chicken breasts and two legs as did another reviewer and cut those up rather than a whole chicken. I did not quite half the rest of the recipe, maybe about 3/4. It got rave reviews. This halved recipe served 6 people easily if you have other courses that you are also serving and people have average appetities, not huge ones.

Rating: 4
Excellent. A few suggestions:use small pieces of chicken, like wings, thighs and drumsticks, rather than cutting up a whole chicken; also, I don't think 24 pieces of chicken fit in one layer in the pan size specified. The crowding would cause the chicken to steam. I suggest either cutting the recipe in half, using 2 pans, or, if you have a large oven, using a commercial size baking pan. If you want to eat the olives, it is a good idea to add them later in the cooking. They get quite crispy.

Rating: 4
This turned out really well. I wanted to make this for my husband and I, so I just bought two bone-in chicken breast halves and two drumsticks. I roughly halved everything else, and used a smaller pan, and we both loved it. Cooked for the full time as stated in the recipe.

Loved the combination of flavors in this recipe, and the preparation couldn't have been easier. I purchased whole chickens and had my butcher remove the backbones and cut the chickens into pieces. I also used leftover ham from our Christmas dinner. The garlic, pepper flakes, herbs, wine and olives produced a truly yummy final dish that I can't wait to make again. The polenta side dish that was featured in the same article was a perfect accompaniment!

I made this for Christmas dinner, when we had a sudden last-minute increase in the number of guests. It was phenomenal! Very easy, looked elegant, and the taste--whoa, amazing. The meat was very tender and flavorful, the blend of herbs was perfect, and the roasted pancetta was delicious. I put a piece of the chopped pancetta on top of each chicken part, which made it look more festive. Highly recommended!

This was great and everybody really loved it. The wine made a nice lowfat juice that you could drizzle over your rice. I substituted the pancetta for prosciutto, though it might have been better if i had added it when i added the olives so it wouldn't get as dried out. I doubled the thyme, rosemary and garlic. It was delicious.
