I made a batch this morning. If you're proficient with a knife, expect the chopping to take at least half an hour. It tasted great when I tried it; I imagine it will have improved over the course of the day. It's also very pretty with the radishes in it. There's not a lot of heat, so if you want spice add a bit of chili powder. Total quantity is closer to six cups - twice what the recipe suggests.

I altered this recipe greatly, yet used most of its ingredients. I first cooked the tomatillos, 2 garlic cloves and green bell pepper in water for 30 minutes. I then processed this and sauteed it with chopped onion and 2 cloves garlic. I added the chopped celery, about 1 cup nonfat plain yogurt and cilantro. I seasoned it with salt and pepper. You have no idea how good this sauce comes out! I serve it with grilled chicken, fish or as a soup with seasoned tortilla croutons. I make it atleast every other week!
