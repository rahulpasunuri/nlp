I can't get enough of this spice blend. I find myself putting it on everything, even popcorn.

Fantastic flavor but only with major modifications...1/3 the salt, 1/2 the chili powder, 1/4 the cayenne. I didn't have dried basil on hand, used oregano instead. Grilled on a perforated aluminum sheet, four mins. per side, high heat, not medium. Used portabella mushrooms cut in quarters lengthwise, asparagus, yellow pepper, zucchini, and tomatoes, possible because of the aluminum grilling sheet. Rave reviews. Kept extra spice mix in jar in pantry for repeated use.

Excellent on any veggie really. I accidentally used too much garlic powder (misread tsp for TB but it wasn't noticable). Used on carrots, zuccini, brocolli, onions, and snap peas. Fabulous!

I used on peppers, mushrooms, red onions and some ribeye steaks. Spicy and delicious!

AWESOME on grilled mushrooms and grilled lamb!

I reviewed this recipe in 2002, but feel the need to give it 4 forks again! I grilled fresh zucchini, red, orange, and yellow peppers, asparagus, red onion, and portabello mushrooms. Could not have been a better accompaniment to grilled tenderloin. The rainbow of color made a beautiful presentation. If you don't have a skillet with holes in it, you can find one at Bed, Bath & Beyond. I used two to accommodate all of the vegetables. Spray the pan with olive oil flavored PAM and cleanup is a snap. Delicious!!!

This is my ultimate go-to grilled veggie seasoning. I actually think the salt amount must be a typo as it's way too much. Use only 1 TB or about half of what is called for. It does make a lot more than you can usually use at one time so you can save a lot in another spice jar for future use. What I did last time was zap it in my little spice grinder so it mixed well and had nice texture (not so lumpy from the brown sugar). We usually lightly coat the veggies with olive oil, then sprinkle on the spices. A little goes a long way but if you like spicey, go heavier. Fabulous!

Very good flavor, though I would lower amount of salt a bit. I think that the salt overpowered some of the other spices, but if used a bit more sparingly, makes a great seasoning for vegetables or meat!

Tastes great on popcorn, too! But a little messy to eat...

delicious. Big Hit at a sunday BBQ with some grilled tri tip.

As suggested by some reviewers, I mixed the spices with olive oil. It was MUCH TOO STRONG. Threw all the food away. I would stick with the recipe and sprinkle the spices on the veges.

Good - mixed the spice blend with olive oil, then lightly coated the veggies with it and let them sit for a couple hours (not sure this helped the flavor, but I was making them for a party and I wanted to skewer everything ahead of time). Used less salt than called for per other reviews. My guests said these veggies were delicious - I'll make this again because it was so easy and tasty.

I used half of the salt that was called for. I also used New Mexico chile powder to add more heat to the mixture. Tried this recipe out last night on the grill, and we could not stop eating the veggies. It was delicious.

This recipe makes a big batch, so I keep it in a jar in my spice cabinet and use it every time I make grilled veggies. I mix it with olive oil and brush it on all the veggies. I love the taste, and it's nice to be able to spice them with something other than just salt and pepper.

I made this exactly as the recipe said to and used some of it on a basket of vegetables we roasted over the BBQ. It was absolutely delicious but way too salty - I'd cut it down to one tablespoon of salt when I make another batch (wish I'd read the reviews first). We mixed mini zuchini, squash, red bell peppers, cherry tomatoes and mushrooms and it was gone in no time!

We enjoyed this very much. The smokier the paprika you use, the better it tastes! Also very good on barbecued steaks. If you're watching salt intake, it is still good with 1/2 the salt.

Very good. This has been the backbone of all grilled vegetables at the cottage this past summer.

This is a wonderful recipe to bring to a barbeque. People raved and about how wonderful the vegetables tasted. I found the longer the mixture sits, the better it taste. I also reduced the amount of salt. The mixture is also wonderful on seafood/fish.

This was fabulous. My husband and kids loved it. I only used 2 Tablespoons of salt and used red pepper, mushrooms, asparagus, cauliflower, broccoli and red onions. I will absolutely make it again.

I just made this this weekend and it was fabulous. I cut down the amount of pepper as our guests don't like spicy food. The children loved it too! Easy to do ahead of time.

Based on previous reviews, I reduced the salt to 2 tablespoons. With this amount of salt, I give this 4 forks. Absolutely delicious on grilled veggies. It does have a kick, so don't go crazy. This will convert even the most confirmed zucchini hater. We've also started using this on shrimp. Just sprinkle on while sauteing and you've got a fantastic entree in no time. Gets raves every time. I also use on sauted potatoes. A very versatile spice mix that's now always in our cupboard. We love it!!!

Also loved the spice seasoning as a base for turkey chili, mixed with flour in sauteed scallops, and even as a spice on homemade fries!

This was too salty. Maybe I SPRINKLED too generously but it overpowered the vegetables. If you try this recipe--make sure you SPRINKLE and my advice is to be conservative, rather than generous....

I'M ADDICTED!!! I love this stuff!!!!! I've made it the past two nights and am going to make it again tonight (I'm single, I can eat what I feel like on a daily basis!! LOL). I used less salt than it called for, then ended up adding it back in (but don't listen to me, I like things salty, experiment with it to your taste). I also increased the amount of garlic powder SLIGHTLY and added a dash or two of onion powder. FANTASTIC!! I broiled this one night, too, with excellent results.

I too reduced the salt to 2 tablespoons. The spice combination was perfect! I grilled the vegetables in a new non-stick pan that looks like a wok with holes. Try to find one in your local kitchen store. The flavors were delicious. My husband loved the veggies over rice.

Wonderful! I didn't find this to be too salty... but, of course, I'm a salt-oholic. I cut back on the salt by maybe a half of tablespoon so perhaps that helped. The only change I would make is to to maybe make it a bit hotter with some extra cayenne. We served these veggies with the barbecued shrimp with the spicy tomato barbecue sauce, also found on epicurious... YUMMM!!!

I love this on grilled veggies (zucchini, yellow squash, red pepper, onion, mushrooms...the list is endless). Instead of brushing on olive oil, I use one of those oil misters and spray on the oil. I use a lot less, but I still get the flavor without all of the additional fat and calories.

An excellent recipe. I also cut down on the salt as well as the cayenne pepper. It is especially good on portebello mushrooms! It won rave reviews when it was served.

Very nice seasoning - a little sweet, a little spicy, a little salty. Guests loved it - can't wait to try it on some beef or pork.

It's not bad; it's just not my thing. I left out most of the salt, which worked fine for me. Because I don't like my food too hot, I also left out all of the chili powder and most of the cayenne pepper, but I should have cut back on the black pepper too. I also thought there was slightly too much sugar, which was unusual for me given that I always find myself increasing the sugar in sweet/savory dishes :-)

It's nice to have on hand - however make sure to add salt "to taste"!!

I have reviewed alot of recipes and only given a couple of 4 forks. This one is great although I spice it up a notch. It is great to have on hand when you want to spice up a dinner....very versitile!

This was and still is an excellent spice mixture. I've had it twice in one week already! My boyfriend commented at least three times how he enjoyed it so much. Definitely a keeper!

This is a flavorful, unique spice combo. Even as a salt freak, it was way too salty. (I used regular salt, so it wasn't the kosher salt that was a problem.) Since you need to use a liberal amount on the veggies, I would recommend cutting the amount of salt in half.

Rating: 2
Be careful of the salt in this one. I use Kosher salt so I don't know if that makes a difference but it was way too salty. Otherwise it is really good and simple. I agree that it would also make a great rub for a variety of meats....

I make this for some vegetarian friends, and even the die-hard carnivores loved it! I make kebobs with mushrooms, new potatoes, yellow squash, zucchini, onions, and broccoli. I also added about another teaspoon of garlic, and prepared by partially cooking veggies, then wrapping the kebabs and a few ice cubes in aluminum foil, then throwing them on the grill to steam 'till done.
