Woman's Day has a healthified version of this recipe (Pork Cutlets with Cranberry Port Sauce) and I combined the 2 for great results. I made this with thin-cut pork chops. I made cranberry sauce with leftover cranberries that I had in the freezer. Also, I didn't use as much rosemary as called for and didn't sprinkle any on the chops before frying. I used olive oil for frying and added 1 tablespoon of butter to the finished sauce. Quick, easy and very good.

A top favorite and I've made it several times now. I follow the recipe to the letter and it's outstanding.

The presentation of this dish is fabulous. Great flavors. The sauce per the menu like an jus so I reduced the sauce for an extra 20 min or so that conistantly was closer to a syrup. I also added dried cherries and cranberries to punch up the tartness since I had to substitute cranberry butter for cranberry sauce. Also, when you add the liquid add the broth first. I added the port and created a smokey mess! Made this last night and served with arugula salad, roasted potatoes and steamed asparagus.

So easy and delicious. I added a bit of shallot and garlic and used canned whole cranberry sauce.

Also did not have port but did have a good Spanish sherry I used as a sub. Family members who "hate" cranberry sauce (and didn't touch my homemade at Thanksgiving) spooned on extra sauce (made from those same Thanksgiving leftovers) and soaked up the rest with bread. Served with roasted beets with horseradish creme fraiche (also from website) and chopped salad from Eating Well---also left over from TDay) for a pretty quick meal.

This has become a favorite dinner for our family. We even use the sauce for Thanksgiving and any other meal we can think of! totally yummy

This recipe is very quick and easy. I have made it "as is" and also substitued pork tenderloin cut into medallions for the chops. Both work very well. It has been entered into our dinner rotation as a staple.

This was a quick and simple recipe that impressed our dinner party guests. The ingredients all come together very nicely to make a sophisticated sauce.

this was probably the best pork chop I've ever made. Tasted like it took hours and cost a lot, but actually the prep and cooking time was about 30 minutes and the pork chops were about $6. Like many of the other reviewers, I didn't have tawny port so I substituted cooking sherry, which was equally delicious. I will definitely be making this receipe again, it was truly exceptional.

This was just so-so, a little sweet for my taste. I wouldn't make it again.

This was so great. The flavor was out of this world. I did not have Port wine but used another red wine which did work. I added a little extra on the cranberry relish. I will be making this recipe again!

My husband and I had this dish the other evening and declared it "a keeper" (which is not always the case with us). In fact, I served the pork chops with a salad, and drizzled the sauce over the salad as the dressing. It was outstanding!

This sauce was sooooo good! I used a really good reserve port and loved the results.

This is a great recipe. I had no port so I used Pinot Noir. Used whole berry cranberry sauce. One of my favorite pork recipes to date.

This was a very easy recipe. I added a bit of minced garlic towards the end of the reduction. I think this would work very nicely with thin pork chops as well.

Nice flavors,easy to do, and pork is still one of the better priced items at the market. That makes it a winner. Served with baked sweet potatoes and small Brussels sprouts, will do it again for the next group of guests.

As a non-chef bachelor, I found this recipe easy to make and absolutely delicious. The next time around, I will also simmer the chops with the sauce for a while longer.

Incredible recipe. Had thicker chops so I threw them in the oven while I made the sauce, using the meat thermometer to judge when they were done. The sauce was perfect, preparing exactly by recipe. Took longer to thicken, but was still fine and thickened more as it cooled. Might try adding the chops to the sauce to glaze as suggested by another reviewer, sounds even better yet!

Rating: 4
I agreed with the reviewer who suggested letting the chops simmer in the sauce. I used a whole cup of port & chicken broth. Ocean Spray makes a handy little 1/2 can of sauce, perfect for this! At the end I added some cornstarch mixed with a little of the sauce to make a creditable gravy. The family gave it a big thumbs up!

Really a 3.5. I made the following changes: brined pork chops like I usually do, per instructions available everywhere on the internet, halved the rosemary per other reviwers' instructions,, and added a couple tablespoons of chopped shallot to pan before deglazing. I was very worried that the sauce would turn out too sweet, especially since I was using trashy ol' canned cranberry sauce, but I PROMISE it was not too sweet at all. Served with sweet potatoes, cubed and roasted with whole garlic, and it was divinely delicious and sophisticated-tasting (especially since it took zero time and effort). This would be an excellent dinner-party dish for a beginning cook.

This was so easy and delicious. my boyfriend thought it was "awesome." I didn't have any leftover cranberry sauce, so I made the "Best Cranberry Relish" from this site. Soooo good.

I've made this a number of times - it just keeps getting better! The flavours of the rosemary , cranberry and port marry beautifully.

Fantastic! And so simple! I subbed 1/2 cup apple sauce with 1/2 cup dried cranberries and it turned out perfect. Matched with a side of sweet potatoes -- it was the perfect festive meal even if there was no occassion. Will definitely make again and again.

This recipe is so sultry and delicious, you'd never believe how easy it is! I had dried cranberries at home, so i used them instead of canned cranberry sauce and I think it probably produced a more sophisticated flavor, especially with the rich port. This recipe is a keeper and has become a regular on our table.

This recipe was so easy, and came out great! I used canned whole berry cranberry sauce... The sauce was a little on the sweet side, but I served it as a dipping sauce, and got rave reviews.

This is a fabulous recipe with excellent flavor. I actually marinated the pork chops in the sauce and it was wonderful. Great recipe full of flavor!!

Rating: 3
I was unsure of the flavors in this recipe as it was cooking; I was not crazy about the sauce on its own. I'm a huge rosemary fan, maybe it was the cranberry? However, the flavors blended perfectly together. I served it with baby spinach salad and sweet potatoes as another reviewer mentioned. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I used 2 very thick chops but used same amts for sauce. Instead of keeping them warm while sauce was reducing, I seared them for a couple minutes on each side, then after I whisked the cranberry sauce into the broth/port I put the chops back in and kept turning them as they took on the richness/glazing of the sauce and finished cooking. Amazing. Hubby and I both raved.

I thought this dish was really good considering the effort and my lack of preparation and ingredients. I used dried crushed rosemary and to my surprise did not have the required tawny port, so I used a cheap cabernet. I also did not have a whole cup of cranberry sauce, so I threw in a handful of craisins for good measure. I let the sauce thicken and it was yummy. Even my picky 5 year old thought it was good. I will definately make this again. It was an outstanding dinner with zero effort.

Incredibly simple and tasty. Followed the recipe exactly. Couldn't believe a dish could be this flavorful w/o garlic or onions (my two favorite ingredients). A great simple dish for both family and company. Will make again often.

This is an excellent sauce. I didn't have any rosemary so instead added just a shake of dried thyme, which worked well. The sauce took several minutes longer to thicken than was indicated in the recipe, so be patient if it still seems thin at seven minutes.

This was 'way better than expected. What a perfect use for leftover cranberry and to zip up pork chops! Yummy, although I'd also scale back the rosemary (but not omit it altogether).

Rating: 2
I would make this again but I would likely use about half the rosemary. I already cut back on the cranberry and the sauce was fine but the rosemary was a bit too overpowering - I think I will try it next time with thyme instead. I have found lately that there are so many bath products now that contain rosemary, that now the smell of it reminds me of soaking in the tub or conditioning my hair. Still my husband thought it was fantastic.

I used the canned cranberry jell. Made it a little sweet but still good. Will cut down on that next time or use a cranberry sauce that is less sweet. The pork chops were so moist and tender. Yummmmmmmmmm!

This recipe is super easy and very delicious. You can find the Tawny Port at many grocery stores. The cranberry flavor is not overwhelming in any way. If you're using canned cranberries, you the kind with whole berries - adds to the presentation. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I didn't like the way this sauce turned out at all, but everyone else LOVED it. I think maybe I just don't have a taste for rosemary? But I've liked it in other things before. Regardless of how I felt, it was a hit otherwise.

This was one of the easiest and best tasting recipes for a glazing sauce I've made in a long time. Will go well with either pork or chicken! We all loved the flavour.

I tried this recipe with the variation of plums that another reader suggested--because I especially love plums to begin with--and it was DELICIOUS. Made it twice in one week with some of the leftover plum sauce and my husband loved it both times. Paired it with rosemary whipped potatoes.

A fantastic, yummy recipe that's simple and quick to prepare. I didn't have any cranberry sauce so I made some for this recipe, cutting way back on the usual amount of sugar to bring out the tartness, and adding a splash of OJ as well. I used sherry instead of port in the pan sauce, and it worked out well because I had made sure the cranberry sauce wasn't too sweet. Wonderful, rich texture and flavour that complemented the meat beautifully. I might use more rosemary next time. Seems like this recipe would be a good base to experiment from as well.

This was tastey, a good way to use up leftover cranberry sauce. Perhaps mine was only OK because being a graduate student on a fixed income, I just used an open bottle of merlot instead of port. But, it was a nice weeknight dinner and finally got the last of the Thanksgiving leftovers out of my fridge!

Rating: 3
A very a propos example of a relatively simple (and short!) list of basic ingredients coming together to create a delicious entrée. The only "exotic" element is the rosemary (well, maybe the tawny port...). The ingredients combine to produce a quick and really good pork dish. I buy my pork loin chops at COSTCO, freeze them, and then cut them through the center while they're semi-frozen. They are the perfect thickness for this recipe! Great!

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I did not feel cranberry overwhelmed, the sauce is reduced so therefore, it all blended well. I used canned whole cranberry and fresh rosemary, excellent. And yes, I will make it again - what else am I going to do with an entire bottle of tawny port?

Rating: 4
I would give 4 forks to any recipe that keeps pork moist and this one did. I went with my gut though and added ingredients without measuring. It was great. I even used canned sauce (probably only 1/2 cup), with the whole berries and used rosemary from my garden and it was delicious.

We all enjoyed this dish - used fresh, organic cranberries to make the sauce and it really made a difference. Served with a brocolli rabe with garlic and red pepper flakes and the bitterness of the rabe was a good contrast to the sweetness of the cranberry sauce.

Agree with another reviewer in that the quantity of cranberry was too much for my taste. Might try again with 1/2 to 2/3 cup.

Turned out really well. But I think the cranberry tended to overwhelm everything else in the sauce. Next time, maybe 1/4 cup more port, 1/4 cup less cranberry sauce.

Fabulous and fast. Very wonderful meal for quick holiday dining. Even the kids loved it. Made sauce with chicken breasts also, but used ruby port instead of tawny. Kids loved it with sweet potatoes.
