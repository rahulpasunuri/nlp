This was absolutely amazing. I actually only used a turkey breast, but it was more moist than most whole turkeys that I have had. During cooking, I added cider and broth (store bought) to the pan, and basted the turkey with the drippings combined with these. The gravy was amazing. Since I had already added so much cider and broth to the pan, I only added half of the required broth and cider to the gravy. My husband said it was the best turkey he had ever had!

The turkey and gravy were nothing special--next year I'll use one of the herb-filled turkey recipes. The gravy was a particular disappointment. It was rich without being flavorful. The turkey was moist, however--a whole stick of butter will do that.

I made this gravy again and everyone raved. I do the gravy pretty much as-is, with a bit less fat, but using the giblet stock recipe above. It's just wonderful and I add 2 cups of cider to the turkey pan while cooking to match the falvors perfectly. I don't use the chestnut stuffing, but usually stuff the turkey with fresh rosemary, thyme, onion, and garlic. I then make a mixture with the reccommended butter, as well as thyme, poultry seasoning, and honey, and pour over the bird and massage between the skin and meat. It really comes out perfectly. A note to self from the last time I made this recipe though - don't get a kosher turkey unless you need one. The whole feather-plucking thing is just NO FUN and time-consuming when there are already enough things to do to get ready for a holiday!

I hadn't made turkey in about ten years, and I wasn't too great to begin with. However, this turkey came out great. Cooking at a high temperature seals in the juices and browns it initially. The secret though is the constant basting, which is a pain in the neck, but the turkey was fabulous-moist and juicy all the way through. and the gravy was wonderful. I even made soup out of the turkey carcass-also wonderful Would definitely make this again.

i made this for christmas dinner. this recipe is all about the gravy. followed the turkey directions for the most part, but used an electric roaster instead of an oven. and i didn't do this stuffing, but rather the SAUSAGE, CRANBERRY, AND CORN BREAD STUFFING from this site. but the gravy was excellent - i am NOT a gravy person. i made it for my husband. but this gravy was so good, i was putting it on everything. it's tangy (although not really sweet) from the cider so it doesn't have that fatty taste i don't like about typical gravy.

Best stuffing ever! Apple cider in the gravy received compliments, and I was proud to serve a unique gravy for my first Thanksgiving. Used fresh spices and, boy, did that make a difference.

This gravy recipe has become my holiday staple as well--4 years running! At first glance, I was afraid that the cider flavor would be too overpowering, but it really creates such a nice depth of flavor that even my fussy, Thanksgiving-by-the-book-sister enjoys. This year I used a Cranberry/Apple cider, which made an equally delicious gravy.

This was excellent -- the pan juices were plentiful for this wonderful gravy (even after I toppled half onto the floor -- talk about creative fat-skimming!). I used homemade chicken stock prepared well in advance and frozen (and defrosted), and didn't bother with making giblet gravy. Nov '93 Gourmet is my bible! Maple butternut squash, and scalloped onion leeks & shallots have been on my perennial menu each Thanksgiving. Now I add this gravy to the must have list! Hope my stained copy holds up!

I have made this turkey recipe for Thanksgiving three times since 1993 when it was published. It is always a hit and we always have a large and diverse crowd of people for Turkey Day dinner. The 1993 issue had many good recipes and my copy has become quite worn and stained - I would rate that issue as one of the best ever and this recipe as a star.

A classic roast turkey recipe. The only problem I encountered was that today's free range turkeys are much leaner than this 1993 recipe I think intended and, as a result, there wasn't much fat left to make the gravy. There was enough, though, to make a spectacular gravy.
