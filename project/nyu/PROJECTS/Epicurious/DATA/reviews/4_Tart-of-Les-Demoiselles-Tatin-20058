Delicious with Colorado cook's pastry. I couldn't turn mine out, however, because there was a lot of liquid. What did I do wrong?

Great recipe and it turned out so well. I will definitely continue to use the rich pastry recipe from the Colorado cook who was nice enough to post it. Next time, I will only use 10 Tablespoons rather than 12.

My guests thought it excellent. (Thnks for the crust recipe, really easy and good) I usually add cinamon to the caramel and missed that extra flavor.

Fantastic! Many thanks to the cook who posted the pastry recipe. It was unbelievable. This one is definitely a keeper.

This the CLASSIC recipe. Wonderful every time. I use a 2:3 combo of Gala and Granny Smith apples and an all butter short pastry.

This is the PERFECT tarte tatin. The flavors are in perfect harmony, the tart and the sweet of the apples and sugar and the texture is beyond compare - the smooth, creammy apples and the crispy flaky crust. Yum. I'm going to make it again tonight! I did not need to use 12 - 14 green apples (maybe if you were using mini-fruits). Instead 4 or 5 medium sized granny smiths worked just fine. Since it doesn't provide a recipe for the rich pastry, try this: Mix 1 3/4 C. Flour with 4 T. Butter, 1/8 t. Salt and 1/2 -3/4 C. Water. Refrigerate for 15 min. Mix 12 T. (1.5 Sticks) Butter with 1/4 C. Powdered Sugar. Pull out 1st dough, roll out till thin and place Butter/Sugar mixture in a lump in the middle. Fold dough over butter sugar into a square package. Roll out until thin again. Fold and refrigerate while you prep the rest of the tart stuff. Then take out of fridge, roll and cut. Very rich and very flaky!
