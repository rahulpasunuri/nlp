We like spice, so we skipped the Jalapeno and added one Habanero. Also added one small can of Chili Verde. Cut the chicken back to 6 breasts. Soaked beans overnight, which is truly the best. Cooked in the crockpot all day. Wonderful!

Come on people! You want to use dried beans because cans are lined with BPA and your canned beans have been stewing in chemicals that act like estrogens in our bodies. Give yourself time, soups are always better the day after you make them. I agree with the other reviewers. I increased the beans and reduced the amount of chicken, I also use chicken thighs since I feel they have more flavor.

In the universe of food, I give this only 2 stars, but in the universe of easy, healthy weeknight meals, it gets 4 stars. I used 3 cans of white beans (and thus only cooked for ~20 minutes) and only 2 chicken breasts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Very easy to prepare after work, makes 6 good-size servings, and was a great way to stretch 2 chicken breasts. I thought it was tasty, but a little bland, but husband and teenaged daughter said it was great. Served with some corn bread muffins and steamed broccoli. Next time, I'll up the spices and maybe add more chilies; definitely will be making this one again!

PS. I used a can of white beans and a can of pinto beans. In the future, I would add another can of beans to take the place of some of the chicken.

First of all, WAY too much chicken. I used 3 breasts and a small package of thighs, and it was more than enough. I would use less next time. Other changes: I didn't add any water, just four cups of chicken broth. I also added a green pepper, a slightly spicy green poblano pepper, and a can of chipotle peppers in adobe sauce (in addition to the two cans of mild green chilies). The poblano pepper made this dish more than spicy enough. For those who like it spicier, garnish with minced jalapeno chilies. I served this with lowfat sour cream and cilantro over brown rice, and froze quite a few servings, which I'll look forward to eating in the next few months. I'd make it again.

Comon... who wants to "Soak beans overnight'??? Just use the canned..you can't tell the difference. There are plenty of recipes like this with a few more ingredients that can add a TON more flavor@! Tomatillos being one...salsa verde.. sour cream instead of yogurt.. (or light sour cream)

I was wondering what to do with a leftover broiled chicken from the market and this was a perfect use of meat from all parts of the bird. The other major change was that I used a can of black beans and a can of red beans which made for a much more intersting color. So I went further and added some diced yellow pepper. It really was attractive this way. For my crew, we like it spicy so I used a whole serrano instead of the canned chili and added a bit of chili powder. Everyone really enjoyed it. Served it with a scoop of rice on the side. Don't be afraid to add more broth to achieve your desired consistancy.

Tasty, but needs rice.

Very creamy, very good! Especially with sour cream instead of yogurt (or a mixture of both). And of course dried beans are much better than those mushy canned beans. I also added some ground coriander and a pinch of ground ginger. Delicious!

This was not chili, it was a white bean version of cowboy beans. It was too thick (and I added more liquid) and it had NO flavor until I added the jalepenos while it was cooking. If you are looking for a white chili recipe, skip this one and look for another.

My friends love this chili. I make minor modifications, using more chicken broth and less water, adding more cumin, and more jalapenos. I also add a cup of creamed corn to add thickness and a subtle flavor change. It freezes well.

This was one of the best chicken chili recipes I have tried! The great thing is that it is delicious as is, but you can also make it spicier or sweeter with a few additions. I added more chilis and oregano. Fresh cilantro is a must!

This recipe was okay, but it definitely needs some added zing!! I tried it without using any extra ingrediants and first of all, it took much longer than the time specfied for the beans to soften and turn creamy. (Any I soaked for longer than an overnight!) Basically, unless you want to dress it up on your own, this recipe was nothing special.

Try using smoked chicken. Yes, some zing is needed, but any accomplished cook can make this an excellent chili. This dish has been requested again this year for the SuperBowl party. So even traditionalists love this one. Oh yes, Cilantro is a must!!!!

I would love to make this again. I used canned Goya "small white beans" to save time. I drained them from the juice in the can. I added alot more jalepenos because i didn't think it was spicy enough. Next time i'll probably add some red chili's for color and flavor and cayenne maybe even a little creole seasoning. I did add a few tablespoons of sour cream while cooking for creamy texture and for garnish. Yum! I will probably either use less chicken next time or cut it into much thiner strips. Another good idea might be to marinate the chicken in a spicy marinade overnight i felt like there was a lot of flavor in my chili but the chicken hadn't soaked up enough of it. Thanks Epicurious!

This dish was very good, though I did change it somewhat. I used all chicken broth, put in 1 tbsp of oregano, extra cumin, a tsp or 2 of chili powder, and a pinch (or so) of cayenne pepper. Also, after simmering the beans and broth for a couple of hours, and adding the chicken, I added about 1 cup of half and half(one of the suggestions), and simmered the chili for about 1/2 hour more w/ the lid cracked. This helped to thicken it a bit. Finally, the chili was even better (and thicker) the second day.

I also added the jalepenos while it was simmering also. I also pressure cooked the beans and used the bean stock as part of the broth. This thickened it and added to the bean flavor. I sauted the onions and garlic then added them to the pot and simmered for ten minutes. In all it probably took me 3/4 of an hour. Will make this again.

This recipe has become a standard at our house! It isn't necessarily a cold weather dish. I leave the cream out altogether and add more broth and about 1/2 cup of any white wine I have open. Did you know you can boil the dried beans in about a quart of water for 30 minutes and you don't have to soak them overnight? Let them sit for about an hour after boiling, and they are ready for use.

After taking advice from the previous reviews, I added 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce (lightly pureed) near the last 30 minutes of cooking. That added flavor!

Will take this dish to a winter potluck-cooked the jalepenos in the stew for more taste.

Not as flavorful or spicy as I had hoped. I had to add some chicken bouillon granules as it seemed weak and watery. I also put in a half cup of half and half near the end to get the creamy texture I was expecting. Also, an hour and 45 minutes was not enough cooking time. Next time I'll plan on about 3 hours; and cut the 4 cups of water in half.

Great dish - I make it time and time again. Easy and good.

I thought this was good - easy to make and quite tasty. I served it with sour cream and La Victoria Jalapeno Salsa on the side - and that 'made' the dish. I think I'll try using a little less chicken next time.

I lost this recipe when we last moved. I was able to search and find it. Thanks! It's one of my kid's favorites. And a really great recipe for using leftover turkey.

I have made this for my family over and over. It is not too spicy but very flavorful and lowfat. I served it with cornbread and don't leave out the garnishments or the dish will lose alot.

This makes a nice, hearty meal when served with a salad and corn muffins. However, it wasn't as spicy or as flavorful as I had hoped.

Please disregard my earlier review calling this recipe "quick, easy and filling." I was rating a different recipe, NOT THIS ONE!
