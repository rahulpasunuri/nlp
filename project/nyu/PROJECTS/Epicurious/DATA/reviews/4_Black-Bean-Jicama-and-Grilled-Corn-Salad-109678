This is GREAT. I used one can of small red kidney and one black bean, and added some red bell and a jalapeno pepper. I found yellow corn grilled better than the white corn

Made this as a side for grilled pork loin and everyone loved it. I used frozen (and thawed) white corn instead of grilled corn, red pepper instead of carrots, omitted the basil and added some spice (Penzey's Forward) to jazz up the dressing. Easy and delicious. Great for summer get togethers.

I've bastard-ized this recipe and it gets rave reviews. I cook a can of corn in a skillet with adobo and ancho chili powder until some of the kernels get a little charred. I never add the carrot, and I never skip the jicama. I add a little more than a handful of halved cherry tomatoes as well. It's super easy! The jicama really makes the texture pop, though. It's like an apple made it with a potato, it's fantastic.

Not going to rate it because I couldn't find decent jicama, so I didn't make the recipe exactly. I added peppers (in three colors) and avocado to make up for the loss. It was super duper tasty. I would not recommend making this salad very far in advance, the beans get mushy and muddy up the flavor.

Great salad. I make it all the time for dinner parties or picnic, or pot luck. Everyone loves it, it's easy, colorful, you can make it ahead of time, serve it with a protein and it's perfectly satisfying meal. If you don't have jicama, use seeded cucumber.

I have been making this for a few years now. My relatives request it every summer. I usually follow the recipe exaclty, which is best. When Jicama isn't available I sometimes substitute red peppers for color.

Did the recipe as is, except added about a cup and a half of sliced cherry tomatoes. Added color and even more fresh ingredients.. a great summer side.

A hit! Nothing else to add here.

Also pan-seared thawed corn and skipped the jicama. Simple food like this is what it is all about!

Served to the extended family to rave reviews! Tried roasting frozen corn kernels since corn wasn't yet in season - worked great. Skipped the jicama (also not in season) but did not miss it. Making again this weekend for the 4th celebrations and this time will have all fresh ingredients. Can't wait!

This salad is so yummy! I added extra cilantro because I love it and extra jalapeno for fire. I couldn't find jicama at our local store so I omitted it. Pan-roasting frozen corn kernels works, but be careful to keep the pan well-oiled or the wet corn will stick and you'll lose the lovely browned corn skin to the skillet.

This salad is a fantastic edition to your meal. I have made it both at home and for the firefighters at work. Everyone loves it. The crunch of the jicama and lime juice make this a delight during the summer.

Made a gigantic bowl of this for a deck party and got raves from everyone, especially the vegetarians in the crowd. Seems like a lot of work on paper, but very much worth it for it's complex flavors and wonderful chewy texture.

This was a delicious salad and a nice addition to a BBQ. I liked the crunchy jicama and carrots, only change I would make is add a little more cumin next time.

I found this recipe while looking for something to do with leftover corn. I must say, it was awesome! I added some farmstand green pepper as well as half of a serrano chili, tripled the cumin, added a touch of chipotle chili powder. GREAT flavors, I will be making this again and experimenting with more additions.

Delicious summer recipe with exciting tastes and colorful presentation. I added chopped red bell peppers as well, and a bit more cumin than called for. Will definately make again.

This is another dish that I make in large batches and bring to work for several days. I, too, grilled the corn in the summer when it was cheap and easy to do. I also have a large quantity of frozen, grilled corn kernels so that I can make this in the winter.

Great salad for potlucks. Served with a variety of kabobs. I added some chopped red bell pepper and more corn. Very colorful and tasty.

No grilled corn? Just take frozen corn kernels and pan roast them! This is a great summer salad. I thought it needed a little kick, so I added a tablespoon of sriracha sauce (rooster sauce). You could add a few diced jalepenos instead for a little heat.

Delicious. The perfect accompaniment to many summer meals.

This was a great receipe and I cannot imagine leaving the Jicama out. It really adds alot of crunch to the receipe. It was great!I think I would Hve maybe added one more ear of corm.

This was delicious, easy, and versatile. I omitted the jicama as I didn't want to make a special trip to the supermarket. Turned out I didn't have any orange juice either -- but 1/2 a lemon and 1/2 TBS of sugar were pretty good substitutes. I cut the cumin in half and doubled the amount of corn and cilantro, as I prefer those flavors. This was really lovely mounded up on a bed of torn romaine with grilled chicken on the side.

Tastes great and very easy! Perfect for outdoor eating or camping.

This was soooo yummy! I am a picky eater and was curious about how it would blend. Not to worry! Followed to the letter except for the jicama which couldn't be found on short notice. Love it!!

Perfect for Vegans. I brought this to a vegan picnic and served lettuce wrap style in bibb lettuce leaves. I garnished with a couple of grape tomato wedges and small basil leaf. It was a hit.

I too omit carrots & replace with grilled peppers & add lime zest. A favorite of ours!

My friends and I adapted this recipe by adding 1 can of cannellini beans and 1 can of garbanzos. Just double the dressing. A winner!!

The overall flavor was good, but the jicama was not my favorite addition. Next time I will defer to the other black bean and corn salad recipes on this site.

We have served this to three of our catering clients this summer and they all raved about it. In fact, they all wanted the recipe. It has a wonderful balance of flavors, sweet from corn, acid from lime, savory from the beans, and great crunch factor from the jicama.

This recipe turned out nicer than I thought it was. I left out the carrot and added whole grape tomatoes, arugala and crumbled queso fresco on top. Was a hit and held well for several days after. If you make a day ahead add arugala and queso fresco while it is coming up to room temperature. Great party recipe....

I went to farmer's market today and had tomatoes and bell peppers but no jicama or carrots. These substitutions worked great. I also reduced the amount of olive oil. This salad has so much color and flavor. The lime zest is a great addition! Yum.

Trader joe's has a roasted frozen kernel corn that is delicious for this recipe.I used 2cans of black beans drained , NO onions, No cilantro, it was yummy!

This recipe was ace! I agree about reducing the black beans and upping the corn. Maybe use an extra ear and only 1.5 cans of beans.

We loved this salad. We paired this with grilled pork marinated in a tequila marinade, and we thought they worked very well together. Next time, we're going to try adding some grilled pinneaple to the salad.

This was a salad loved by all. If you are lucky to have the store "Trader Joe's" near you, they sell frozen grilled corn and all you do is thaw.

Loved the flavor! Followed the recommendation to add red bell pepper, it added flavor and color. Also followed the recommendation to use more corn, good rec. Goes great with the fresh tuna tacos.

I thought this was yummy, easy and healthy. Nice flavour. Would be a great side-dish for a BBQ dinner. We ate it as a side with beef fajitas and used it almost like an extra salsa.

Excellent main-course-ish summer salad! I was jonesing for something creamy, so substituted 1/2 c plain yogurt for 3T of oil. Also chopped up fresh spinach and mixed it in. Might also try a bit of a kick w/cayenne or Tabasco next time, although improvement would be difficult.

Super easy recipe. In my family, even the kids liked the recipe. The vegis are crunchy and the citrus dressing gave a nice zing to the creaminess of the black beans and corn. I made extra deressing for the side for those that liked their salad a little moister than the recipe called for.

Rating: 3
Tasty! May add all kinds of crunchy veggies, add more cilantro (which I love), and a little chili, i.e., a few drops of tabasco sauce.

A little bland at first, I added a roasted red bell pepper and a roasted aneheim chili and some garlic. Everyone enjoyed it, and the leftovers kept until the next day.

If you don't have time to grill corn, you can use high quality canned white corn with good results. I added an extra 1/2 cup if jicama, and I think it improves the flavor of the jicama to chop and soaki n water overnight in refrigerator. Rest of recipe ingredients are perfect.
