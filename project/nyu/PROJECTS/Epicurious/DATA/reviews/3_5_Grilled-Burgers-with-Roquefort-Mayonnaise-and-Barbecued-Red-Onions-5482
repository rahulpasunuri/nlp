Our new favorite burger recipe - Fantastic! We have these on ciabatta rolls

I didn't rate this recipe because I only made the BBQed red onions, but I wanted to say how fabulous they were! Served with a regular grilled cheeseburger (burger + american cheese + tomato), these really made the meal. Be sure to cut them into thick slices, so they don't fall into your grill, and let them marinate in the BBQ sauce for a good half-hour before grilling them. Also (and this is off the subject but worth mentioning), try grilling bacon slices instead of frying them, for a burger topping; with the BBQed onions on a burger, they're perfection.

The burgers came out perfect! Onions were good but I think I prefer carmelized maui onions along with sauteed mushrooms in addition to the blue cheese/rouquefort mayonnaise.This is not for the calorie counters out there.

Fabulous flavors. I would add a little of the hickory barbeque sauce to the burger next time. Also, put more than one onion slice on your burger. The onions make the dish!

We love this recipe. The Glendale cook had a great suggestion: Use metal skewers and insert sideways into onion rings for easy turning. I also used 85% Angus ground beef instead of ground round because we like our burgers not to be so dry. I also served mayonnaise dressing on the side because it is rich.

Delicious just the way it is written!

I loved the onions, and found the mayonnaise tasty but extremely rich, so I put it on the side and dabbed into it once or twice. Also, I seasoned the burgers with worcestershire sauce and a bit of Dijon mustard, which made them tastier.

This was DELICIOUS!!!! The combo of the Roquefort Mayo, BBQ red onions and the lean hamburger, was incredible. The only thing I added was bacon bits to the Mayo. This is a definite KEEPER - will make again for sure.

My husband and I thought these hamburgers were absolutely delicious. I have made them with and without the barbeque sauce and we prefer them without. The roquefort mayonnaise and the grilled red onions were perfect with the grilled burgers. We have served them to guests, also, who pronounced them astonishing!

We loved the burger....the Blue Cheese Mayo was a hit. The biggest compliment was from my husband....he did not even use his favorite condiment....ketchup.

My husband loved these burgers. Keeping the onions together while grilling was a bit of a challenge but I used a veg. grilling basket with small holes and was fairly successful. I used Gorgonzola cheese instead of Roquefort and I found it very good. I served them with an avocado dressed with Balsamic&Raspberry vinegar and extra virgin oil and it went very well, especially with the "Roquefort" sauce.

As far as burgers go, this is a keeper. Bursting with flavor. I modified the recipe a bit: I added a packet of dried French Onion soup mix to a pound of ground beef and added some finely chopped fresh rosemary to the mayo.. omitted the hot pepper sauce and used balsamic vinegar. These burgers were hit.

This is so easy and a great big hit. I made this several times last year following the recipe, but this year I forgot to make the Rouqefort mayonaise and just put the cheese on the burger. It was perfect that way too. Enjoy!

Delish! The onions are terrific - as is the bleu cheese/mayo -- in moderation - it can be overwhelming! Still - this dish made the meal!

My wife, who is not big on strong cheese or onions, loved this. She especially liked the onions. Now she wants me to cook hamburgers this way all the time. So, most of the time I do since I thought it was great too. The mayo also works on a lot of other things. Use you imagination.

We made this for a crowd on the 4th and they were mighty glad they came! The onions are integral to the flavor, don't omit. We fought over who got the last burger. Yummy!

Forget the roquefort mayonnaise. It's far too rich. Offer sliced ripe avocado instead. Use a metal skewer to hold the onion slices together, like the Glendale cook suggests. Accept the repeated compliments graciously.

Love this and I'm a sucker for blue cheese on red meat. Watch the amount of mayo on the burger-it can be too much of a good thing and overwhelm the taste of the meat.

I couldn't have been more surprised, and pleased, with how these turned out. It truly is the combination of barbecue sauce, red onion and the cheese mixture (I've tried both and prefer the milder gorgonzola that another member suggested). As far as burgers go, these will definitely be returning to the summer table.

I've also been making this since first published and love it. I thread thick onion slices onto metal skewers and that makes them easy to flip. (Thread the skewer sideways through the onion slice so it lays flat on the grill.) Delicious flavors!

Served this to an international crowd (British, German, Polish, Brazilian) with great success. Everyone had seconds and divided up remaining burgers. Easy too. Great flavor combination.

The blue cheese mayo was great! Also like the barbecued onions. This is definitely a "keeper" to add a special touch to plain burgers.Joni

I have been making these burgers and sharing this recipe with friends since it was published. Everyone that has had them loves them and wants the recipe. During the summer, we make these at least two times a month. The flavors are wonderful together.

I made the mayonnaise with light mayo and Rosenberg Danish blue (extra creamy) because that's what I had on hand. It was delicious! I've tried it on sirloin, turkey, and veggie burgers and it really makes a special burger. The taste goes well with the BBQ sauce (I like Sweet Baby Ray's Spicy BBQ sauce with this). My husband and brother-in-law liked it so much I'm making a batch up for a bachelor party they're having this weekend. It's also a great dip for broccoli and cherry tomatoes. Yum!

This is the ONLY way I'll make burgers at home. Barbecuing the onions is a bit of trouble (I always lose a few through the grill) but well worth it. The roquefort mixture is best if made well in advance. The quality of roquefort/bleu cheese used will vary the results, but I find that the hot sauce (Crystal's better than Tobasco, IMO) and red wine vinegar MAKE the Roquefort mayonnaise. I wish I'd thought of it.

Perhaps the mark of a great recipe is when someone that you have made it for (at a party or get together) makes it for YOU! This has occurred a couple of times for me, already, so this outdoor dish must be somewhat of a sensation. Believe me, this dish is ugly, messy, and a bit out of the ordinary. Which makes it positively excellent for the get together of friends or family. I highly recommend it....we have made it many, many times. Beats the heck out of a conventional grill out.

This was fabulous! My husband loved them and I will definitely make them again. The roquefort mayonnaise is the key to these very tasty burgers. I wouldn't change a thing.,

Barbecued onions added a nice touch, but the cheese mayo was unremarkable. I like blue cheese (which I used rather than roquefort), but it was all I could taste, despite adding LOTS more vinegar and hot sauce than was called for. Any suggestions on jazzing the sauce up would be appreciated.

* WARNING: The most important thing about this recipe is that the cheese mixture is UGLY!!!! Never ever ever serve it in a bowl to your guests or they'll think you've gone crazy serving them poi with their burgers!! This recipe is sooooooooooo excellent but you have to slather the burgers ahead of time with the cheese/mayonaise mixture....then the onions...then but only then will you get rave reviews!

If you like Roquefort cheese, you'll love this burger. The flavors work very well together. A big hit with guests at a recent barbecue.

I was a little tentative to make this after reading the reviewer from Utah, but I made it anyway for about 16 people. It was by far the best BBQ I have ever had. Everyone raved about the roquefort may and the bbq red onions. I highly recommend.

After living in Utah for the past 5 years, I thought I'd experienced every culinary insult possible. Not so. This was so bland, it was bad even by Utah standards (or lack of them). I thought it was just a waste of perfectly good ingredients

I just made the barbecued red onions and added them to regular cheeseburgers. What a hit! My husband and our guests just loved them.

These burgers are excellent! The grilled red onions have the best flavor and I feel the burgers would not be right without them. The roquefort mayo is a little strong for my taste(but well liked by my guests) so I also made the mayo with regular crumbled blue cheese-yummy!!

I have made this recipe twice, once for our family of four and the second time for company. It was thouroughly enjoyed by all. Many times I change re cipies and adjust them to my families taste, but I used this recipe "as is" and it turned out great. Everyone agreed that it was a keeper.
