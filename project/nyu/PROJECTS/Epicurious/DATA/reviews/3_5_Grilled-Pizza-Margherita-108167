Holy cow! This is one great pizza. I think purists would call it grilled flatbread instead since the side containing the toppings is grilled first, but whatever you want to call it, it's fantastic. No matter how perfect a circle I made the dough into, by the time it was transferred to the grill it ended up more like a rectangle, but it looked nice and rustic. I did sauté some garlic with the tomatoes and add a dash of red pepper flakes and some fresh oregano to make a more flavorful sauce.

This is a fine recipe. I've improved it by eliminating brushing oil and having to rotate the dough. I build the pizza on a perforated disk and place the disk atop a hot cast iron pan in my grill. Here are a couple of pictures: http://www.pizzahomechef.com/pizza-grill-kit

I am giving 4 forks for my version of this....but the instructions for grilled the dough are fabulous and I even used a grill pan with wonderful results. I topped my pizza with chopped up fresh tomatoes, some fresh mozzarella and grilled marinated eggplant (also from this site)....it was so delicious!!

I made this recipe a few weeks ago and it was the best pizza I ever ate! I followed the sauce recipe very closely, using garden fresh tomatoes along with some snipped oregano, marjoram, and basil in the sauce and adding more basil and some oven roasted garlic when putting the sauce on the dough. I followed the directions pretty closely and the pizza looked rustic (rectangular). Once one side of the dough was browned enough, I flipped the crust and lightly browned the other side. Then, I removed the crusts and put the toppings on in the kitchen (making it easier to work with without it getting over-cooked). Then we placed the pizzas on a doubled piece of foil and put them back on the grill. We closed the grill, watching it very carefully to make sure it didn't burn. The grilled flavor was really amazing!

I followed this recipe exactly and the dough was very difficult to work with. In the end everything turned out okay, but it wasn't pretty.

Loved this! I added mushrooms and pepperoni and everyone thought it was terrific. Crust was crunchy and chewy in all the right places. Cooked up perfectly on the grill even with the extra ingredients.

This was great! Grilling the pizzas makes them more similar to flatbread. Next time I would double the sauce, as it was hardly enough for 2 9 inch pizzas.

For the sauce added 2 cloves of garlic to good olive oil in the pan, sizzled briefly and added about a half teaspoon of salt. Used fresh mozzarella. Really great recipe!!

This was a fine, basic pizza. One thing I learned the hard way is to use less coal and let it cool down some before placing the pizzas on the grill. Our coals were too hot and no matter how much we moved the pizzas to "cool" spots, the whole bottoms were completely burnt before the cheese had a chance to melt.

pizza was fantastic, definitely rotate the pizza during cooking! Added about a tablespoon of garlic to the cheese when tossing it, which greatly added to the overall flavor.

I've used this pizza dough many times in the oven, but last night we grilled it and it was spectacular. We tried all sorts of toppings but a traditional margherita was my favorite. http://fineeats.blogspot.com

I made this along with another grilled pizza of my own design. This one was much better. I added a little garlic, parsley, and sugar to the sauce, and bought some dough from my local pizzeria which was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life.

OK, to ChezDemagZ...is that like when Al Gore invented the internet? Because my mother has been making pizza on the grill size I was a kid--trust me that was many years ago--she was born and raised in a southern Italian village! Loved this , I added Fontina cheese and fresh mozzarella, and I did cook down the tomatoes, I added them fresh from the garden, it was great!

I've had the privlege to work at the place where grilled pizzas are credited for being first developed. See Peter Reinhardt's American Pie. Anyhow on to what matters. This grilled pizza recipe seems very flawed. In order to have a propper crust that is both tender and crisp you need to cook on a charcoal grill (800 to 1200 degrees) build your fire on one side of the grill. Stretch your dough to an even 1/8 inch thickness on the back of a sheet pan coated with extra virgin olive oil. prepare sauce and grate cheese. The freshness and quality of your ingredients really shine through in this pizza. When you have formed the dough, pull over the hot side of the grill and cook untill tiny bubbles form on top of the dough. Check the bottom to make sure its cooking evenly, flip and grill for a few more seconds on the other side and move the dough to the other side of the grill. brush with olive oil and spread your cheese atop that, the oil conducts heat and helps melt the cheese. Proceed to dollop tomato sauce all atop the cheese. Top with fresh chopped herbs and drizzle some more olive oil atop. Move the pizza back over the direct heat and allow cheese to melt and bottom to crisp equally, move around as necessary. Good luck- pretty easy method may take few triesto nail down. Avoid flare ups by topping neatly, ie dont pour the oil into the fire. Goes well with chilled sparkling white wine, the carbonation aids in the digestive process. Remember the sucess of this dish depends on the quality and balance of your ingredients. Enjoy.

Made this recipe on an outdoor firepit over a grating and it was delicious. bought the dough from a local pizzeria, which saved a lot of time. I cooked the sauce down quite a bit, which I would recommend because it gets a nice chunky consistency and avoids making the dough too soggy. I substituted fresh mozzerella for packaged, added fresh basil and topped it with shredded chicken, bacon and carmelized onions. All of the dinner party I made it for thought it smelled, tasted and looked amazing. Highly recommended.

This recipe was so hearty and comforting. My Honey and I each topped out with our favorite veggies. Very fun!

This turned out great! We took the advice of the other posters, and used less salt, just a teaspoon. And we also added 1 tsp. of sugar instead of flour to the yeast mixture. One other thing that made a difference, we added one large clove of minced garlic to the tomato sauce. We will definitely make this again! It was easy and fun.

Had a little trouble with the rolling out part, but it may be because I made a whole wheat crust. Otherwise a rustic and elegant dinner al fresco!

I luv so cal is right, the ingredients were so simple but together tasted amazing... maybe even the best pizza i've ever eaten! Although the dough was a little hard to work with on the grill, it was the grill taste and tomato sauce that really made it great. Besides that, it was a fairly simple recipe- i'd definately make it again.

This is to ILuvSoCal: Try using Trader Joe's pizza dough. I've found that it's a good compromise between store bought and homemade!

The flavors were so simple yet outstanding - I made this for my housewarming party last night - very fun on the bbq :) Used can tomatoes and it was great. However - my only store bought dough option was Pillsbury in the refridge section.....big disappointment. It was hard to work with and not flavorful. So....I'll resign to a homemade dough next time.

This recipe is excellent! I made with homemade pizza dough... which was easy to prepare. I did alter the recipe a little. I grilled both sides of the dough... then topped crust with pesto, fresh mozarella, sliced tomatoes, thinly sliced garlic, carmelized red onions and fresh chopped basil. Then, I put the pizzas back on the grill on low heat for 5 minutes until cheese melted. The results were fantastic. This is a great summer meal... and a great idea for a party. Who wouldn't love to make their own pizza?!

The fun factor gives this recipe the 4th fork. Hanging around the barbeque, relaxing while waiting for the next one to be ready made for a lovely evening with our friends. I too, used sliced tomatoes, but I had other fillings ready as well, such as caramelized red onion, olives, prociutto, and sautéed mushrooms to make a different pizza each time.

All I have to say is YUMMMMMMMMMM! I used pre-made crusts instead (saved a lot of time) and used sliced tomatoes instead of making the sauce (again, saved a lot of time). This is such nice change from the usual meat dishes I cook on the barby (plus a nice alternative for vegetarian guests).

We used a Boboli dough, and were glad we did, because it did not take very long to melt the cheese, and if it had taken longer (as with raw dough), the crust would have burned. So, on a hot night, when you don't have time for BBQ chicken, this was simple, and didn't heat up the house. We would do it again - our way.

We loved this recipe. My husband put some soaked pecan chips in the smoker of the grill, he felt apple chips would of also been good. Great flavor! We had to grill just a minute longer on each side. I also added a some crushed red pepper to the sauce, we tend to add a little spice to everything.

This is great instruction on grilling pizza! (something I have wanted to try, but didn't know cooking times, etc). I used sliced tomatoes rather than making a sauce and that is great. Now I just need to convince my husband we need a new grill that cooks more evenly!!

Alright I just have to respond to Cook from Seattle 6/4/03, if you read my review you would have read. I used purchased pizza dough. Nest time I will make my own (as recipe suggests). I did not like the canned tomatoes. I would also not like it with fresh cooked ones as I prefer fresh tomatoes just sliced into rounds placed on my pizza Margherita. I feel these are valid comments, and at least I did try the recipe before posting a comment.

Excellent and easy on the grill! I used Rhodes bread dough rather then making my own and it tasted great and was a little easier.

I folled the recipe to the letter and it came out beautifully. I have made homemad epizza many, many times before and this is the first and only time it has ever tasted like the real thing! The salt in the sauce was the key for me, as well as the simplicity of the whole thing. Just thinking about it makes me want it again right now.

Sounds like way too much work for me. Pop a Red Baron's or DiGiorno's in the oven and be done with it!!!

I have made pizzas on my gas grill for a couple of years - I purchased a pizza stone from Pampered Chef and KMart (both work fine). That really does the trick - tastes like California Pizza Kitchen.

Just thought I'd add my thoughts. I too have been making grilled pizza for years. I do it on our gas Weber grill with homemade pizza dough (makes 2 14-inch pizzas). [I actually tried Pillsbury pizza dough once and it just wouldn't stretch properly??] Anyway, I usually spread the dough out in a large jellyroll pan dusted with cornmeal, transfer to the grill and grill on both sides. Then I bring it inside and top with sauce, cheese and toppings. Then I bake it in an already preheated 425-degree oven 425 for 10 minutes or so while I'm doing another pizza on the grill. That way, I don't have to bring everything outside and you get the grilled taste without worrying about the bottom burning on the grill while your cheese melts. Just a suggestion though. My kitchen is a ways from our deck so this seems to work fastest. Bon Appetit! [God, now I'm hungry for pizza...:) ]

I've made pizzas this way for years and I'd just like to add for those who use charcoal to be sure to use the best charcoal you can find if you want your pizza to taste like it came from one of those oh-so-trendy wood-fired pizza restaurants. I use lumpwood mesquite charcoal (it looks like blackened chunks of real wood, which it is) rather than briquets. Also, if you want to add other ingredients, be sure to have them ready as soon as you flip the crust. The less time you spend with your grill lid off, the better.

I usually ignore the petty squabbles that folks get into in these reviews, but California needs to read Seattle's message to Columbus again before anouncing who needs to read what. Anyway, I've been wanting to try a grilled pizza for a while, but my grill is too small for 2 9" pies on indirect heat. I'll try laying 4 unglazed quarry tiles on the grill and cooking the pizza covered, for about 10 min- not unlike a wood fired pizza oven.

Obviously the cook from Columbus can't read.

Wow, Seattle and Columbus, I think both of you should read the recipe again. You're suggesting the recipe be changed to do what it already says to do. ?? Anyway, I for one cannot wait to try this recipe.

sorry, i used pizza dough either from the pizza store or the italian food store and it it just great! has to be room temperature though -- grilled pizza has always been a best seller in my house, even with fussy kids who eat nothing --you can be inventive with toppings - pesto with lobster - grilled vegetables, etc -- always a hit!

Sorry, I just read the recipe and haven't had time to try it, but had to respond to cook from Columbus OH on 6-3-03: #1, it states you can make your own pizza dough, and gives a recipe. #2, it states you can use FRESH or canned tomatoes. #3, it says to grill dough, THEN FLIP and add toppings, and then finish grilling. Did you read the recipe??
