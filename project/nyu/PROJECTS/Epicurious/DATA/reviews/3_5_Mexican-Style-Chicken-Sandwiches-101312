This was good. Not hot enough for the husband or me. I would definitely add more spices and skip the mayo. I'll just squeeze lime juice over the chicken next time. Not a mayo fan and it was tooo much. I too used sliced chicken breasts for ease of eating. Loved how the avocado worked with this. I'll definitely make again.

I will probably "butterfly" or slice the chicken next time, as the breasts were a bit too thick for sandwiches.

We make these regularly because they are SO delicious and easy to make! They are a bit messy to eat, but that's part of the fun.

This was DELICIOUS and ESPECIALLY EASY the way I made it!!! Didn't goof with raw chicken--just oven baked pre-grilled Great Value breast fillets (found in the frozen foods at W/M). Found that I was out of black beans and subbed red kidney beans (only used about 2/3 of what the recipe required). Had some left-over salsa from "Catfish Tacos with Tomato and Avocado Salsa" (from this site), and subbed it for the slices of tomato and avocado. Since this salsa is quite limey, I did not make the mayo-lime mixture. Put a thin layer of mayo on both the top and bottom halves of each bun. Also added some iceberg lettuce on top of the layer of beans on each sandwich--to add crunch. ENJOY!!! (P.S. Made in this fashion, they were less sloppy to eat than most tacos I've had.)

Sorry folks, I'm not in agreement. Tried it for some friends last night. My one friend liked them alot, her husband wasn't as verbal as his wife, although he said he enjoyed them. My husband hated them, which really surprised me. And I thought they were "ok". Considering the variety of responses, I'de suggest making these first, then trying them on guests. Maybe this is one of those "love em or hate em" recipes.

These sandwiches have great flavor and are so simple to make. Good for a weeknight dinner or informal entertaining - just add a simple salad. I followed the recipe to a 'T' except that I grilled the chicken.

My husband and I LOVED these easy sandwiches! Can't wait to try them on my son when he visits from college this weekend. I marinated chicken in lime juice and minced garlic for an hour before sauteing and then sliced before making sandwiches...delicious. Have lots of napkins on hand!

Fabulous sandwiches. Agree with reviewer who sliced cooked chicken breast - as it makes the sandwiches MUCH easier to eat.

Thanks to all the rave reviews or I might have missed out on this yummy recipe. I sliced the cooked breasts to make it easier to eat. I added more cumin and salt to the beans and served it on an onion hamburger bun. Next time I might experiment with some cilantro sprigs as lettuce. Will make this again and again.

Wonderful!!! but messy!! i grilled the chicken instead of pan-frying and found it just as easy! we used a salsa instead of the mayo and it was still great!

These sandwiches were delicious but VERY MESSY to eat. I would suggest pounding out the chicken to make it thinner which would help on the messyness. I also marinated the chicken in lime juice/cheyenne pepper for several hours. The chicken could use more cheyenne pepper.

This dish was fantastic! I also marinated the chicken with oil and cayenne before grilling (instead of pan frying), which I think provided superior flavor and visual appeal. I also used low-fat mayo, but would recommend using more lime. Absolutely delicious and so easy!

I used and suggest using light sour cream instead of mayo to give it a more authentic feel. Marinated my chicken in Chile hot sauce overnight that provided for that heat I like!! I also diced the tomato and avocado, while adding diced onions, chopped fresh cilantro and limejuice for a great relish topping. The bean mixture could use a little more cumin, but in all this was a great simple recipe that has room to experiment and build.

I didn't think that it could taste better than it smelled while cooking....but it did!

These sandwiches are fun, colorful and tasty. We grilled the chicken breasts on the bbq instead of cooking them on the stove. Also marinated the chicken in an spicy, herb marinade before grilling. When teamed with a lively salad, these sandwiches make a light, delicious summer dinner.
