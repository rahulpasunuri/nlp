Actually, Bon Appetit (Oct 1988) had a similar but much better recipe that isn't available online. The recipe is: 2 lb red potatoes (quartered), 1/4 c plus 2 T fresh lemon juice, 1 1/2 t dried oregano (crumbled; I increase to 1 T), 1 t grated lemon peel (optional in my opinion), 1 t salt, 1/4 t freshly ground pepper, 1/2 c olive oil (I recommend extra virgin), 20 small bay leaves (Yes! it's a lot; get them bulk from an Indian, Italian, or other ethnic market). Toss all ingredients and bake in a shallow pan at 375 deg F until golden brown, about 45 minutes (mine often take longer and your time may vary). This version is GREAT!!!!!

I agree with the others, it was very boring. I didn't add any other spices and found that the bay leaves didn't add a very unique flavor.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and added fresh rosemary and sage with the bay leaves. Like they said, the herbs give the potatoes a delicate flavor, and we really enjoyed them. We will make this dish again, and maybe experiment with other combinatins of flavors.

I thought that these potatoes were quite boring. I used high quality bay leaves and it was missing flavor. They tasted like regular roast potatoes which is not bad but I was hoping for more.

I modified the recipe slightly and it improved the needed flavor. Instead of only bay leaves, I added herbs de provence, or rosemary, basil, etc. This added more flavor than just the bay leaves. It is always a hit.

This is the perfect potato recipe if you don't want to overwhelm the entree. Use good fresh Bay leaves. The infused oil adds a very delicate flavor and aroma.

You have to really like the flavour of bay leaves to enjoy this very simple recipe. I found that it was missing "something"
