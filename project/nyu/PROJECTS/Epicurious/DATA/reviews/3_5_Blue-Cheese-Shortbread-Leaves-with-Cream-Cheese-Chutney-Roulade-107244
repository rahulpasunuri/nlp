Delicious - particularly with the spiced chutney if you can find it (look for Silver Palate brand). Super easy to make. It's a go-to favorite for parties. I made the shortbread crackers once and didn't really care for them - really dry. I just serve the roulade with whatever crackers I have around. Always a hit!

This roulade is great and very easy, but I decided not to make the shortbread and instead crumbled some blue cheese on top of the chutney before rolling it all up. I also used a spiced plum/grape chutney I'd just made, though it would be great with cranberry. It was amazing with wheat thins.

I can only speak for the cream cheese roulade--you people who had success with this recipe must be wizards, or aren't telling the complete truth about the appearance of your roulade. I chose this as a last minute app (as requested) for Thanksgiving that could travel 2 hours in the car and not take up oven space when we got there...so I bought some good crackers and decided just to make the roulade since time was short. I'm not sure why it didn't work--it would seem that the measurment (after rolling) expected from one 8 oz. brick of cream cheese is just too much for it to bear. Each time (one really chilled), the other put into freezer for a few minutes to REALLY chill the cream cheese), it rolled to a paste so thin NO amount of coaxing with the plastic wrap could help. Total waste of ingredients, BOTH times. And as far as chutney's go, here in Northern Kentucky, I was luck to find more than one type in the Indian food sections of my grocery. Had I taken the time to make the cranberry bourbon chutney from scratch that I make each year, or the blue cheese shortbread leaves, then had the disastrous issue with the too thin paste of cream cheese, I would have been even more irritated.

I found the recipe VERY EASY to make, and I followed it exactly. I used an English Stilton and the flavor was very pronounced. The only change I made was that I simply rolled the dough into a log shape, wrapped it in plastic and left it in the refrigerator for a day. Then I cut the log into rounds. This was way easier than rolling out and cutting into shapes. And...I agree with the other reviewers - it's hard not to eat the whole batch!

The shortbread is a delightful treat. Rosenberg Castello Danish Blue Cheese makes it outstanding. I substitute toasted pecans for the walnuts and consistently receive rave reviews. Have not made the roulad as the shortbread is outstanding on it's own.

FABULOUS!! I have been using this for years - since it first was printed. I always get compliments and requests for the recipe. I serve with a cream cheese block topped with raspberry jalepeno preserves for a quick appetizer. But.....I could eat the shortbread all by itself - ALL of it!

The shortbread is an absolute FIND of a receipe! Easy and Exceptional! Very special to add to one's list of pary fav's! I like fuss free baking & this has renewed my faith in same! I agree w/prior reviewer the only problem is not eating them all before serving! I have yet to try the chutney! But will..

This is an appetizer I have made at least 6-8 times a year from when it was published, it gets rave reviews and there is never any left. Made it for a group of musicians last evening and it was inhaled! I roll the cream cheese between plastic wrap and have never had a problem. The shortbread is delicious but water wafers are great also. Stonewalls-Old World Chutney is the best, I put most of the chutney inside and just a little on top as it is just so pretty with the onions showing.

I served the shortbread with the Mixed Greens with Honey Vinaigrette and Gorgonzola (Gourmet Dec/93). I didn't bother with the cream cheese roulade. I made the shortbread and salad with dolce latte gorgonzola & topped the salad with roasted beets. It was a hit with my foodie friends and British neighbours. One foodie made the shortbread the next day to take to another dinner party. Dough definitely needs refrigeration before cutting. Easy to make, nutty and rich.

Made this for Thanksgiving appetizer and it was gone quickly. I think 10x8 is too thin to roll the cream cheese because mine cracked. I ended up just mixing everything together and molding into a leaf shape and it was great. The crackers are OUTSTANDING and worth making!

This is a wonderful appetizer that you can make in advance that always get good reviews. The crackers are sensational! I made the roulade with a peach chutney this time and thought it was quite complimentary.

Wonderful appetizer! Made this twice and received raves both times, especially for the shortbread. My children think the crackers are the best "cheez-its" they've ever had. Would skip the roulade next time and use suggestion to pour chutney over block of cream cheese and garnish with (fewer) chopped scallions.

This app. was terrible. Hardly anyone touched it. Presentation was tricky -- cream cheese was a bear to keep looking "pretty".

Shortbread was very easy to make and the dough rolled beautifully. Didn't love it though -- good but tasted flour-y. The roulade was great. I used Stonewall Farms Cranberry Apple Chutney. Rolled out the rectangle slightly smaller than recipe indicated and chilled before adding the chutney and making the log. I think that kept it from sticking from the plastic wrap. Will make roulade again but will probably skip shortbread.

Continued from below (how do I delete or modify my old reviews?? I used to be able to do that before the site was revamped...): In terms of amount of shortbread vs. roulade, I also recommend doubling the shortbread or halving the roulade.

Roulade: Good and relatively easy. To avoid rolling the cream cheese too thin (in which case, it will break/rip when you roll it up), make the rectangle 10x7 or 10x6 instead of 10x8. I did not pour extra chutney on top because I didn't want to cover the colorful chopped scallions. Shortbread: I can't rate this because the blue cheese I used was unexpectedly strong, which I felt messed up the entire shortbread recipe! But it was easy enough otherwise.

This was a wonderful, festive, convenient addition to Thanksgiving. As a guest at a dinner of family who frequently dine at one antoher's homes, and slated to bring the appetizer, I wanted something that would be more special than our usual cheese plate or crudites, and that I could make at home and easily transport. This recipe fit all those, and was enthusiastically enjoyed by all. I especially liked that it was "special" enough for a holiday, without being such a big production either to make or in terms of heavy food content as to detract from the big meal to come. The roulade was very good, but it was the shortbread that was the star, and was devoured before the roulade was gone. Next time I would double the amount of shortbread. I cut it in diamonds, which looked fine. For the roulade I used low-fat cream cheese (neufchatel), which rolled out fine, but I wonder if regular cream cheese might have chilled firmer, enhancing the roulade's appearance. I didn't really see the pretty spiral effect I'd hoped for. I used Cross & Blackwell cranberry chutney, which tasted good, but has whole cranberries. Something with smaller chunks might spread smoother and make a handsomer roll.

A hit at a recent party! I used an Indian-spiced mango chutney that was delicious. If the chutney has large chunck, you might cut up before spreading on the cream cheese. The only thing I would do differently would be to either use more cream cheese, or not roll it out so thin. When I rolled it up, it had a tendency to crack. I also cut the rolls in half and placed the two parts side by side on a small white saucer, which I thought made a beautiful presentation. A great cocktail appetizer.

Doubled the shortbread and made some substitutions. used ww pastry four for the flour and cornstarch and almonds for the walnuts and mozzarella for half the blue cheese. yummy. mixed the chutney (homemade banana chutney from "the joy of pickling" L. ziedrich) with the cream cheese and dolloped on top of the crackers.Either way double the shortbread it is a yummy cracker.

This got rave reviews from my family at Christmas and the same from friends when I made it again. Rather than use a cookie cutter I used a ruler to cut the shortbread into diamonds. This went very fast. The first time I made the roulade with half goat cheese. I found this way too much work for the result. The second time I used all cream cheese in a block and rolled it between sheets of waxed paper instead of plastic. This went much better. I found that cutting the roulade quantity in half was just fine for the full shortbread recipe and the amount of scallions can be reduced even more. Also, the shortbread is fabulous all by itself!

My entire family was extremely impressed. The cookies were a lot of work but definitely worth it!

The shortbread cookies were savory and were a great combination with the cream cheese. I would definitely not take the time to roll the cream cheese the next time. I think I will take the cream cheese and either put it in a small mold or just decorate it with green onions and walnut and then pour the chutney over it. I also will make the cookies bigger as they were too small with my biscuit cutter.

tried to make the shortbread leaves and found the dough didn't come together at all. I ended up with a food processor full of blue cheese flavored flour. Not sure what I did wrong. Is water missing from the recipe?

the shortbread crackers are amazing. next time i'll double or triple the cracker recipe since people were fighting over the last ones. the roulade was good, but not extraordinary. i might try something else with these crackers next time.

I used Black and Crosse (?) cranberry chutney. The crackers are interesting by themselves but once paired with the cream cheese and chutney, they really become something. They were a snap to make and add to the presentation, so it's worth the extra effort.

The roulade seems like a lovely way to present a dish that my mom has made in a much simpler way since the 70's - take a brick of cream cheese, pour a bottle of chutney on top, sprinkle with chopped green onion and serve with crackers on the side. It's always been a hit. The blue cheese crackers are good but if you're in a hurry my mom's method works just fine.

This was a great do-ahead appetizer! Made the day before the party, used mango chutney, no difficulty with weeping. It was very tasty and eaten quickly. The blue cheese crackers definitely add something, and are quick and easy - I recommend them.

This was fantastic! Make the shortbread leaves, too, as they are really wonderful! I used a roasted pear chutney from this site, and made a couple of mods to the recipe: used half cream cheese and half goat cheese, plus, I rolled the log in chopped, sugared walnuts before slicing it for serving. I put a few additional sugared walnuts on the plates. The combination of sweet, tangy, salty, smooth, creamy, and crunchy is amazing. I'd give it five forks if I could!

Have made this for several cocktail gatherings and have had people fight over the last piece -- have served it more with crackers than the shortbread. Leaving the roulade overnight in the refrigerator makes it set better. Stonewall Kitchen Cranberry-Apple Chutney is the best.

I made this for a party and the guests gobbled it up. I was unable to find cranberry-apple chutney, and substituted another English import called "Branson pickle relish" it is made with apples and dates and is similar to chutney.

Made this for my sister's baby shower and people loved it and several requested the recipe. The shortbread leaves were incredibly easy to make--I used petit four cutters for the shapes. The roulade was a little "weepy" since I made it the night before. I would make it closer to serving time and make sure not to roll the cream cheese too thin. Overall a great recipe. Will do again.

Will make again! Wonderful blending of ingredients -- and so easy to make! Did not quite have the same look in the magazine. I didn't make the shortbrad. I served with store bought crackers instead. Couldn't find the spiced cranberry-apple chutney. I purchased a cranberry chutney that worked very well.

I found that the dough didn't come together until I added a few tablespoons of water. The shortbreads have a subtle blue cheese taste, great texture, and weren't salty at all. My only problem will be not eating them all before tomorrow! I'll definitely make these again.
