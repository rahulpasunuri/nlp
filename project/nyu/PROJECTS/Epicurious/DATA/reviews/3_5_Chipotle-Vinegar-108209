This is a simple way to give vinegar a tasty, spicy kick and use up extra chipotles. With thanks to the previous reviewer, it indeed makes a great smoky version of a vinegar barbecue sauce. I also must comment to the first reviewer that this recipe comes from a chef known for his Latin American fusion cooking. This style PURPOSELY combines old world and new world ingredients. I think he, like the majority of cooks on this site, knows quite well where both these ingredients come from. If you're that much of a regional chauvinist, make it with a "new world" vinegar instead and miss out on the complexity that Sherry vinegar adds to this recipe. Or stop cooking altogether, since virtually no region or culture's cuisine is immune from outside influences.

Anna: Thanks for the lesson. Here's a history lesson for you: much of Latin American culture and gastronomy derives from Spain as a result of the Spanish conquest of what is now Latin America, so the use of a product from the "motherland" is entirely reasonable. Here's a grammar lesson: it's a "geography lesson" you're wishing to give us. Hopefully you've also reflected on your hastily written posting and learned a valuable good-manners lesson. By the way, the vinegar was pretty smoky and interesting. I'd like to try it on some pulled pork.

Chipotle had absolutely nothing to do with Spanish cuisine. Please stop confusing Latin American with Spain. Spain is in Europe and Latin American countries are in the continents of South and Central America. The Caribbean also includes some Latin American countries, such as Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and others. This is just some geographic education for you dummies!!!!
