This is a delicious recipe! I increased the ingredients by 50% (12 eggs, 12 oz. milk, etc.) and made it in a 9x13 pan, and it turned out great. I'm not a huge fan of thyme, so the second time I made this, I omitted the thyme and instead mixed fresh parsley in with the eggs, milk, and grated cheese.

Served this Strata this morning at brunch to guests who raved. The bread I used was several days old which allowed the egg mixture to be absorbed well. That may be the secret for those who were disappointed with their results. It truly is a delicious and attractive dish.

I doubled the amount of goat cheese and doubled the bell pepper--used 1 orange and one red for beautiful color. I also substituted artisan olive bread for the whole wheat which added another flavor to the mix. I baked it in a 9x13 Emille Henry glazed casserole dish on convection 375 for 20min uncovered then 10 min covered. You might be able to only go 5 min covered. It came out moist, flavorful and really great. I will definitely make it again.

Update to above review. I ended up keeping this in the over for an hour. The top is very brown vering on back in some spots. It does taste good, but watch this so it doesn't burn. I would also imagine a larger pan would lessen the required time as well, also helping this problem.

I am currently waiting for this to come out of the oven and I would first like to say it smells delicious and I'm sure it will tase so when it is done. However, there are a few issues with the way the recipe is written. First, I used a 9x9 pan and it is much smaller than I will use on the future. The bread filled the pan and when I added the onion and pepper it was mounded over the top and I had issues keeping it from all slipping off the sides. I think nest time I will try my 9x11 pan. Secondly, I had the oven was completely preheated and at 25 minutes it still didn't look quite done so I gave it another 10 minutes. However, 10 minutes later when I set it on the trivets I noticed still liquid egg mixture in the center of the dish. Not just not completely set, but still oozing egg. This is clearly not safe to eat, so back in the oven it is. On one hand I don't mind just leaving it in the oven longer, but the goat cheese is already quite brown and I am concerned it will burn by the time the egg is fully cooked. I have a feeling this issue might also be solved using a larger pan with a greater surface area. Anyway, I have followed the recipe and if this tastes as good as it smells right now I will make this again. I will also adjust the pan size and cooking time.
