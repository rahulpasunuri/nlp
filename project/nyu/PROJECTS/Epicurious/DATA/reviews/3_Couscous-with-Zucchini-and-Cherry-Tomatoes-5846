This was really good, what was a side dish could be a meal. I added some craisins and slivered almonds. Very nice!

I used the boxed Near East Pine Nut Couscous mix and left out the Thyme so it wouldn't interfere with the included spice mix.I reduced ingredients by half to match the amount of couscous in the box.YUM!

A nice, simple, and easy dish that makes for a great side or delicious addition to a vegetarian meal!

This is fine, easy enough for a weeknight and relying on pantry staples. However--as another reviewer noted--the recipe is incomplete. It was easy enough to chop the onion, but I didn't realize until we were at the table that I'd never added salt and pepper! Still, this was quick and easy and I'm sure I throw it together again.

This was an easy meal to make, and it was so great. You can spice it up by using different kinds of couscous mix and maybe adding different kinds of vegetables. But whatever you do it will taste great

Forgettable. An ok weeknight side dish, but I have other recipes that are better. Needs something other than thyme to flavor it.

The zucchini is what makes this dish unusual and special. It adds a sort of creaminess and sweetness which is surprising in a cous cous dish. The recipe is unfortunately pretty difficult to follow - for instance, do you add the onion whole (ridiculous thought - I diced), and do you add the tomatoes whole too (I quartered). I substituted homemade vegetable stock for the chicken stock to make the dish vegetarian, and it made enough for a main course for three.
