I don't understand some of the comments, "too much béchamel, bland, etc. If you're a cook, you know that a) the pasta, cooked al dente, will absorb the moisture in the béchamel, and b) if you taste the sauce as you go along, you know to add salt & freshly ground pepper TO TASTE, as the recipe indicates. This is perfect as written. Be sure to use extra-sharp cheese (a bit saltier) of good quality--the kind for which you will pay extra (it's worth it).

This recipe was pretty good. I substituted chili powder for the cayenne pepper but otherwise made it exactly as the recipe outlined. I thought there was a bit too much roux, and it was a little bland. I think I'll look around for a different mac and cheese recipe.

Rating: 1
I made this, instead of my usual, as I was cooking for someone who doesn't like onion. I don't like the seasoning balance and the amount of roux. I was a little embarrased to serve this one. Joy of Cooking's Baked Macaroni and Cheese remains my go to recipe. The onion and bay leaf really do it for me. My only change on that one is using Panko bread crumbs.

Why would you not make a cheese sauce and then pour the mixture over the macaroni? This would be much easier than the way they show it.

A solid, classic macaroni and cheese; how can you go wrong? I substituted three chopped chipotle peppers for the cayenne for a nice extra flavor and kick. I think this will be my go-to macaroni and cheese recipe.

Wonderful, classic mac'n'cheese. I made mine even cheesier than the recipe suggests, using a full pound of extra sharp cheddar and 8 oz. Parmesan. Amped up the bechamel flavor with a grating of nutmeg, a little garlic powder, and a few shakes of Tabasco sauce. Used panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs for the topping, and mixed in some cheddar along with the Parmesan. Baked for 30 minutes, then let it rest for another 30 till everyone was home for dinner. We loved it so much that we ate the leftovers for breakfast.

I've made this several times and my kids love it! I use a 3-cheese blend from Trader Joes (cheddar,monterey jack and one other I can't remember). I also add a bit of worcestershire for zing. I have to cook the milk/roux mixture several minutes longer than the 2 mins in the recipe in order to thicken, but be careful not to thicken too much or the macaroni and cheese will dry out in the oven. I've always made it with seasoned bread crumbs but recently had it with crushed cornflakes and that was even better. Make sure to add enough salt and pepper too.

This turned out really dry and flavorless. Way too many bread crumbs. I would not make this again without major modifications.

This is an awesome recipe for a tasty baked macaroni and cheese. It's my husband's favorite comfort food, and I've tried lots of basic recipes that just don't have any flavor. The proportions of sauce, cheese and seasonings are perfect. Adding salt and pepper to taste is important for the right flavor. And the cayenne adds a nice kick. I used a local, raw sharp white cheddar with lots of flavor, so I'm sure that helped too!

Rating: 1
HORRIBLY bland and mushy, should have only used half the bread crumbs. I used twice the pepper and mustard, used extra salt and was still tasteless :(

Rating: 3
Great basic recipe for a old favorite. As written it's a great base for multiple variations - add ground beef, sauteed onions and chili powder for nacho-style mac & cheese, or go with lobster instead. So many possibilities! I used 2% milk & skipped the Parm.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! We had some great flavored (garlic and basil) penne from Pike Place Market in Seattle and decided to use that. Other changes we made used 1 cup gruyere, 1.5cups cheddar, .5cup of peppercorn jack blend (needed to use it up). Made a YUMMY SAUCE!!! I added a fair amount of salt, not too much though. I did however use the standard Italian seasoned dried breadcrumbs, which have A LOT OF SALT, so if you use those, go easy on the salt in your sauce. Ours ended up pretty salty. Edible still, and mighty DELICIOUS! Also, your pasta can be less than al dente before you mix it and bake it. It cooks a lot in the oven, and if you like firmer pasta al dente is already too cooked to be baked for another half hour in the oven.

Used 1/2 sharp cheddar, 1/4 fontina, 1/4 asiago in place of the extra-sharp cheddar. Used 1/2 pecorino romano and 1/2 parmesan in place of the parmesan.

Everyone enjoyed it. Probably serves 10 - 12 as entree. I burned my milk also. The directions should probably say stir/whisk continuously rather than just occasionally. I could do without the bread crumbs (too grainy), altho I think it needs something. Maybe, I'll try what my mother does and use buttered cubes of bread.

This dish was wonderful, it is grown-up Mac N Cheese! I added spicy brown mustard and chopped ham, blended wheat bread, for the crumbs, with the cheese and butter so the butter was well distributed for the top crust, and served it with crusty bread and a green salad - a great comfort food meal!

I had never made home-made mac & cheese before and have made it several times since. This was the first time my husband had EVER HAD home-made mac and cheese and he can get enough every time. I even made it for him for while I was in the hospital after having our son and for his birthday. The only thing I have changed is that I dont like the consistancy of the bread crumbs so I use Ritz crackers and its delicious.

I made this recipe tonight, and I have to say off the bat that I will be making this again. I point this out because I had many problems with the recipe that would normally deter many. The first, and foremost, biggest problem was that I burnt my milk. I was waiting for my sauce to boil, but it seemed to be taking far more time than I thought, or even the recipe suggested, it should have, so I turned up the heat and burnt my sauce. Fortunately though I kind of recognized this and resisted there on out from scrapping the bottom too much. But when it came out I could tell it was a little burnt, although my boyfriend said it tasted more like a grilled cheese kind of burnt. I also dont think you should use that extra tsp of butter to help your breadcrumbs brown and harden. From the beginning this didnt really seem logical to me, and when I did it, it barely worked. So I used PAM, a gentle mist over the top to make sure it crusted. Lastly, the recipe was kind of bland. HOWEVER, I thought this was a really simple recipe that could be expanded upon. I used Italian herb bread crumbs, and I enjoyed the flavor so much that I think just having Cheddar and Parmesan alone is a waste of good cheese. Like I said I will make this again and rate it then.

Rating: 4
I have never made Mac & Cheese from scratch and did make a few modifications, first only used 1/2 teaspoon of the dry mustard and used 1/2 white cheddar and 1/2 regular sharp cheddar. It turned out AMAZING! I followed all other instructions. My husband and I couldn't get enough. Going to have it at Thanksgiving!

This recipe was excellent! I made it gluten-free by using the same amount of sweet rice flour for the sauce, and using rice pasta for the noodles. I skipped the breadcrumbs on the top b/c I didn't have any GF (but I bet it would have been good). I also upped the cayenne pepper a bit because I thought a bit of a kick would be good - and it was! I LOVE the mustard, it really gives it a lot of dimension. I will definitely be making this again.

I have made this twice now and it is incredible. It is hardly mac and cheese at all.....in a good way. So much richer and more elegant than the usual. I took this to a company luncheon and everybody went insane. It tasts just like the mac and cheese at a bistro here in town that people rave about. I will experiment with a tiny bit less butter and two percent milk next time, just to see if I can get by with that. This time I used all the butter and whole milk, it is rich and wonderful.

Quite delicious, and versatile. I served it as a side with chicken cordon bleu, and even my picky toddler loved it. The possibilities of cheese combinations are really endless, thought I prepared it as-written this time. The mustard also really adds a nice touch, just enough bite to the otherwise very creamy sauce.

Rating: 3
I agree, not THE mac and cheese recipe, but good. I used a little mozzarella (ran out of cheddar) and homemade whole wheat bread crumbs. Mine seemed to slightly curdle or separate, but it was still good. My favorite part was the crunchy bread crumb topping. Oh, and I baked it at 375.

Rating: 3
This was good mac and cheese. I could have done without the topping though just because I'm not used to it like that. The key to a creamy sauce is to take your time with the roux until it's really thick. 2 minutes is not going to cut it. I followed the recipe for the dry mustard and cayenne pepper because my toddlers wouldn't appreciate the extra heat. I seasoned the roux to my taste but as much salt as I added it still needed more. that's why I have my trusty old salt and pepper shakers. I would use this recipe again and real soon. I'm 3 months pregnant and this mac and cheese made me feel reeeeeal good.

I'm looking for THE mac and cheese recipe. I liked this one a lot, but I think there is a better one out there. I did use (as another reviewer had suggested) panko bread crumbs. They were great. I'll stick with this recipe for awhile, and doctor it for my taste while my quest continues.

This has become a staple in our home, it's always a favorite. Best thing is the versatility! You can substitute different kinds of cheese, add things like bacon or ham.

I would suggest following the recipe the first time around, and then use your imagination!

This is my first Macaroni and Cheese. Made it for kids coming over who are not good eaters. Went down a treat! Because it was made for children, I omitted the cayenne pepper and substituted it with a teaspoon of Worcester sauce. Did not find extra sharp cheddar cheese and used the dark orange one instead and then Parmesiano Regiano. Could not find powdered mustard so used regular mustard, two teaspoons of Savora Mustard which is sweeter then most mustards, it was fine. Instead of using 450g of pasta, I stopped at 400 so as to keep the sauce to pasta ratio on the moist side. A fine dish. Will be giving it to the other mothers upon the kids' request.

My hubby and I just got back from Wisconsin and had a cooler full of cheese, I was looking for a way to use some extra sharp cheddar and this was perfect! I followed the recipe exactly except only made 1/2, then divided it into ramekins to freeze the extra. I'm glad I did, or I would have eaten much more! The only complaint I had was that it should have said salt the bechemel to taste. It needed more, but next time I might add some good smoked ham which would be salty enough in itself. Also, I want to try it with some of our other cheeses! Good basic recipe.

I followed the cook from Santa Clara's idea and added a couple of tablespoons of minced onion since I love onion and cheese in combination. The casserole was well received and quite delicious.

I find this to be a great base recipe. I always change the recipes a bit...this one was no exception. I use rotini pasta, because I prefer the shape to macaroni and I add chopped ham and frozen peas to make it more of a "complete" dish. I also incorporate a splash of cream to the sauce at the last minute for added richness. The flavors of the spices in the sauce are delicious pretty much as-is. I like it with cubed chicken and broccoli added to the pasta as well. It's a great dish to experiment with!

have been eating it all week...it does make a lot, but keeps and reheats well. I had a block of tillamook pepper jack to use up, so used that for about 1/2 of the cheese and left out the cayenne...also subbed prepared dijon, doubling the amount. this seemed to give it the kick it needed.

I have made this dozens of times and love this recipe just the way it is. The only change I make is to use up any leftover cheese I have lying around. I will use at least half cheddar but have also put it gruyere, manchego, asiago, and many others. The more the merrier! It freezes well too. This recipe can also be cut in half as this one makes quite a lot of mac and cheese.

Rating: 3
I used medium cheddar and found that the recipe really needs the sharp cheddar that it calls for. I usually prefer low sodium dishes, but this recipe needs quite a bit of salt. Taste the roux while adding salt to make sure you put enough in. I doubled the bread crumbs and broiled 2 minutes at the end for a fantastic crispy top.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It bugs me to read all of the reviews where people have altered the recipe and then say they didn't like it. I thought this recipe was a lot of work, lots of bowls and a LOT of whisking. I do agree with those who found it to be somewhat bland. However I brought it to a potluck dinner and everyone loved it. It's nice that it can be assembled ahead of time. I would probably make it again primarily for that reason.

I love this recipe. I make it whenever I have a hankering for homecooking...and it's better than my mom's. I make these changes: I use 2 cups 1/2 and 1/2 and 2 cups of milk. I use a lot more cayenne, some tumeric instead of dry mustard. I also only use 8 ounces of cheddar and 2 ounces of goat cheese. It's so amazing. Everyone I've given it too has loved it, too.

This mac & cheese was rich and creamy. I added extra cayenne pepper, salt, pepper & garlic powder to the mix for more flavor. After the milk mixture was done, I mixed all the cheese right into the sauce pan and then mixed the noodles with the sauce right in the baking dish. Seems easier this way! Next time I will use Panko bread crumbs and a bit more butter on the topping. Oh yeah, it took almost 40 minutes in my oven. I would cover it with foil for the duration of cooking and then broil for 2 minutes at the end.

This is a staple in my kitchen now. This is a dish my toddler is guaranteed to eat. The quality of the ingredients makes all the difference. I use extra sharp Vermont cheddar, sometimes mixed with gruyere or another flavorful swiss and real parmesano mixed with pecorino romano cheese. The only mods I make are to increase the cayenne quite a bit and I saute a small diced onion in 2 tbs butter and then add it to the breadcrumbs and cheese for the topping in a bowl. You don't need to dot the top with butter then. Like me, when my daughter gets to college and sees that orange box stuff that passes for "mac & cheese" she's going to refuse to eat it. That's not mama's mac & cheese.

This recipe (as is) is great for kids and the less adverturesome adult. Make sure you taste the cheese sauce, it definitely needed salt (about 1 1/2 tsp. to my taste.) I'm sure it depends on the saltiness of the cheese. For more taste: I added sauteed minced onion and parsley, a lot of fresh pepper and Tabasco.

Delicious recipe. It was easy to prepare and made alot. The macaroni was a bit dry for me. I may have kept it in the oven too long on broil to crisp up the bread crumbs. Too many bread crumbs for me. I increased the cayenne to 1/2t which gave it a good bite. I might add some cream cheese to it next time and watch the cooking time.

Okay, I hate it when people completely change a recipe, but seriously, this is the best mac&cheese I have ever eaten, EVER!!! And I've had it with lobster in Boston, and king crab in San Diego...this beats them all!!! I went to Trader Joes (a store in San Diego) and bought a bag of quattro formaggio (a cheese blend including parmesan), for the cheese measurement, I used 2 cups sharp cheddar and 2 cups quattro. I increased cayenne to 1 tsp (to my own taste), and added chopped black forest ham and chopped green onions. Everything else was the same. Unreal and fat full...yeah! Just go for a jog the next day.

I made this using some of the previous suggestions. I simmered the milk with garlic powder, thyme and two bay leaves before adding it to the roux.

I thought this recipe (with all of the suggestions) was fantastic, as did my family and friends! I, too, added 1/2 cup extra milk, but I "spiced" the milk up a bit by simmering it with 1/3 cup chopped onion, 1 sprig thyme, 2 sprigs parsley and 2 bay leaves for five minutes, then let the milk sit for 20 more (straining out the herbs before I added it to the roux). I think this step added another level of complexity and flavor to the dish. I also added 2 cups guyere cheese, 1 cup sour cream and made the ritz cracker topping mentioned in other reviews. And making it a day earlier (sans topping) then baking it the next day helped the flavors devlop, too. A wonderful (if but once-yearly) dish!

I am a huge mac and cheese fan and used the excuse of making this for the kids for Thanksgiving dinner. Needless to say, I have eaten several servings since dinner finished yesterday. I did take everyone's advice into consideration. I cooked the roux and added 2 1/2 cups hot milk and 1 cup of heavy cream. I used the recommended amounts of mustard and cayenne but upped the sharp cheddar to 4 cups. I turned off the heat and added about 3/4 cup sour cream. I mixed the noodles in and baked at 375 for about 20 minutes. I made a topping of 1 cup homemade wheat breadcrumbs, 1/2 stick melted butter, 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/2 cup more cheddar. Then I returned to the oven until browned on top and bubbly-about 15 more minutes. I can't even imagine how many fat grams, but it was worth it!!!

Total hit at my son's first birthday party - both kids and adults loved it. Texture was great...I added horseradish mustard, extra garlic, and extra cayenne (based on others' reviews). Also used some cajun spice (about a tablespoon) and extra-sharp cheddar and asiago cheese. Though it was definitely more interesting than other Mac & Cheese recipes I've had, it still needed a little more "oomph". Would make it again, but will add a little hot sauce to the mix.

I've modified this recipe a little using organic skim milk and cheese - as well as organic whole wheat pasta and organic ww pastry flour. I also add some Dijon mustard when mixing in sauce and cheese with noodles. To top it off, I make my own bread crumbs in the food processor with a whole grain organic bread. It's great. A little healthier twist to a comfort food favorite.

Much better with the modifications suggested. Definitely increase milk to 4 cups, 1/2-1 cup sour cream, onion, garlic, nutmeg, additional cayenne, combination of cheeses, and crumbled crackers on top with additional cheese and fresh parsley for presentation. I will consider using 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cottage cheese (added at final mixing), which I discovered a local restaurant uses in their recipe that I enjoyed immensely. To cook from Vienna, VA on 02/26/05. I have an M.S. in nutrition and am a practicing dietitian as well. With that said; I find it funny you are worried about trans fats as unhealthy when using the suggested cracker topping. First of all, do your home-work; the trans fats in one serving of ritz crackers are negligible at best (1gram in 5 crackers). Second, the gruyere cheese you added in 1 cup servings has 545 calories, 43 grams of fat (over ½ from saturated fats), and 145 mg of cholesterol. Not much healthier. Third, when IS Mac and cheese healthy? It's a "sometimes food" plain and simple. If you are going to splurge on mac and cheese make it taste good! Life is too short to eat bad food; just do it in moderation.

i would've expected a much creamier dish, judging by the amounts of milk, butter, and cheese that were in the recipe. i followed the recipe word-for-word to see where it would take me. i used some great extra sharp cheddar but didn't get that tangy taste at all. in retrospect, i should've used some sour cream for a creamier dish, perhaps added some more cayenne (it was barely perceptible), and thrown in some bacon bits and chives. the recipe is a good base, but i suggest adding your own ingredients to it to add some character. the mac and cheese is still appetizing, but i expected a lot more. i think next time i will try it with some gorgonzola...

This base recipe, tweaked with several of the suggestions offered by other reviewers, makes a great macaroni and cheese. These are the changes I made. I streamed 3.5 cups of milk into the roux and then whisked in 1/2 cup of sour cream after taking the milk sauce off the heat. To the milk sauce I added 2 tablespoons of Maille horseradish Dijon mustard, in place of the dry mustard. I also grated some nutmeg into the sauce, and I added about 1/4 cup of minced onion and 2 teaspoons of minced garlic that I had sweated in a little butter. Then I whisked the cheese into the sauce (I used 1/2 cup Asiago and 1/2 cup parmesan, and I upped the amount of cheddar by a few ounces) until it had a nice thick texture. I tossed the noodles with the cheese and poured all of it into my baking dish; then I baked it without a topping for 35 minutes or so until it was bubbling and starting to brown. For the topping I tossed Panko bread crumbs with melted butter and a little grated parmesan; then I turned on the broiler, scattered the bread crumb topping over the surface of the casserole, and just ran that under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the crumbs. I let the dish sit for 15 minutes or so before serving, and the result was a perfect mix of crunchy topping and creamy interior and it had a wonderful flavor. So thanks to all who shared their suggestions! I love this site.

We were really disappointed with this receipe. Given that it contained sharp cheddar and parmesean, we expected a full taste but found it bland. There are better recipes.

This was my first attempt at mac & cheese from scratch. It turned out wonderful and was a big hit with my guests. I added a bit more cayenne and used some extra sharp Irish white cheddar I had on hand. Passed on the breadcrumbs & used 2% milk and I thought it turned out absolutely yummy. Sad I didn't have enough leftovers to eat cold the next day :)

Good, made recipe with additional spices and sour cream as recommeded by others. Go easy on the cayene and worchestire-a little goes a long way. My guests who are not usually mac & cheese fans, all came back for seconds and thirds.

this is the best macaroni and cheese recipe i have found--my family and friends finished the entire batch in an evening! only a few modifications--of course double the cayenne, and you really wont recieve much heat from it, just a more textured flavor. i added stone ground dijon mustard to the white sauce, not dry mustard, because i wanted a subtler and creamier mustard flavor. about a fourth cup (maybe more) finely diced white onion, raw, to the pasta. a blend of parmesan, asiaggo, and romano cheeses to both the white sauce and the bread crumb topping (which, if you cut a bit of the butter from it won't be soggy, but perfect), sharp cheddar instead of extra sharp, a bit more cream, and finally, a few pieces of crispy bacon. it was delicious!

Definitely a great version of mac&cheese, especially if you add the gruyere, as suggested. A big NO to the addition of crushed Ritz crackers. They're so unhealthy---loaded with trans fats!

The best Macaroni and Cheese ever...I used a small ribbed Penne instead of macaroni...and left out the break crumbs..just sprinkled with the Parmasian..made the dish for 4 then again for 34. Reheated some leftovers at room temp. in a pan on the stove added some more milk..it was fine..re-heating in the oven had the fat from the cheese seperate..

I've made this countless times since discovering this recipe. Here is how I make it creamier: I add the full 4 cups of milk, I also add 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup of vegetable broth or chicken broth. That additional liquid makes the dish wonderfully creamy. (I also add a little more cheese than called for, minced onion and peas.) This is certainly a family favorite.

Very good as is. Could definitely be creamier.

This is a wonderful dish as long as you make several changes suggested by others here. I increased the milk to 4 1/2 cups and added 1 C. sour cream. To add more flavor I added 5 minced scallions, 2 t. salt, 1/2 t. pepper, and increased the cayenne to 1/4 t. I also added 2 cups grated Gruyere that made all the difference in the world. Definately use 1 1/2 sleeves Ritz crackers, crushed, tossed with 1 stick melted unsalted butter - it makes a light, crispy, Pako-like topping. I made the dish early in the day, refrigerated it, then added the topping just before baking. Everyone said it was the best mac 'n cheese they had ever had and I agree.

A suggestion to make it creamier and add another layer of flavour is to add in some goat cheese (to the milk mixture). I also added stewed tomatoes and spinach. It turned out delicious.

I made this for dinner last night and my family loved it! I substituted heavy cream and half and half for the milk. I topped it with with shredded cheddar instead of bread crumbs(my children don't like mac and cheese with bread crumbs) and I added a minced clove of garlic and three green onions. I served this with stewed tomatoes seasoned with Herbs de Provence. It was lushious!

This was definitely good, I made a few substitutions... Kudos to the reviewer who suggested using the sour cream, I replace 1 cup of milk with 1/2 cup sour cream. I also used a combination of 1/2 shredded asiago and 1/2 romano in place of the parmesan. My one problem is this, I found the recipe tasty, creamy, and easy to make, however the bread crumbs do not get crispy. I bought good crumbs from a local bakery and they got soggy. I have a pan in the fridge to bake tonight and I am going to toast them first and use more butter but we'll see. any suggestions?

I made this dish for Christmas, and it was a hit! Like many other reviewers, I also added 1/2 C. sour cream, and reduced the milk by 1 cup. Also, I cooked the bulk of the recipe the day before, and the next day added crushed Ritz crackers tossed with melted butter (in place of the breadcrumbs) on top and baked it. Everyone said that it was the best macaroni and cheese they'd ever had. Delicious!

Even though I was making this for just my boyfriend and myself, i decided not to halve the recipe hoping that we might like it enought to eat for the rest if the week. Good thing- what with lunches and late night snacking and "oh, just a little more" it was gone in a couple of days. Delicious.

I made this exactly as written -- my husband and I thought is was delicious, my child was a little "iffy" on it. As written, it needs generous seasoning with salt and pepper. Next time I will add a bit of sauteed onion (minced very fine so it will be undetectable by a scrutanizing child), sour cream and a bit more sharp cheddar.

Made this dish for Thanksgiving. As others suggested, I added 1/2 cup sour cream and used a sleeve of Ritz crackers instead of the breadcrumbs. Also used penne rigate instead of elbows. Split the recipe into two casserole dishes, making one on Turkey Day and the other the next day. The first one was absolutely delicious- everyone loved it. I baked the second one the next day and it was even better than the first. The pasta must've absorbed the flavors. Yum!

A great, kid-friendly mac & cheese. I added about one extra cup of cheddar and instead of the bread crumb topping, I used one sleeve of Ritz crackers, crumbled and mixed with one stick of melted butter. Excellent! Adds to the flavor and texture of the dish.

Added 1/2 Cup sour cream as previous reviewers suggested, a good idea. Doubled the cayenne. Used asiago instead of parmesan and doubled that as well, used a bit less cheddar to compensate. Added lots of salt. I also added some yellow and red food coloring to make it look more familiar to the kids. The consistancy was perfect until the bread crumbs soaked up liquid and became this meally background once served. I will make again with some additional changes: Stir the crumbs with melted butter before putting on top and make them larger pieces (or maybe just skip the bread crumbs). Add some green onion. More mustard and maybe even a little more cayenne. Leave out 1/2 cup of the cream sauce and add 1 cup sour cream. The base recipe is worth working with though. Definite comfort food.

I am pregnant and CRAVING comfort food...this recipe absolutely hit the spot. But I would not make it for guests! What I varied: I did not have breadcrumbs. I used the following cheeses: parm., mozz., cheddar, and asiago. I doubled the cayenne, and added a bunch of salt and pepper. I also added 1/2 C sour cream as someone suggested. Finally I added a cup of peas and wish I added more. Enjoy!

I made this for a 4th of July bbq and it was a big hit with the adults and kids! I left off the breadcrumbs and added a bit more cheddar cheese, but other than that, I followed the recipe. Next time I will definitely include the breadcrumbs and add a bit more cayenne, but for the kids, just a little is perfect. Great recipe!

I had a thanksgiving pot luck at my job so after printing out a dozen mac & cheese recipes I based my recipe on this one. In stead of 4 cups of milk I used two cans of condensed milk and 2 cups of skim. Also for the cheese I purchased two bags of already schredded cheese (classic melt). It was four cheese's it had american, monterey, sharp chedder and Vermont white Chedder. I didn't have cayenne so I used a pinch of paprika a little extra salt, some pepper and I also threw in 1/2 tspn ground mustard and a splash or two of worcestershire sauce. YUMMY. It got rave reviews and four people asked for the recipe. Oh yeah, I also crushed ritz crackers on top and parmegian (alot)!. Don't look any further for another recipe. Next time I might throw in a can of stewed tomatoes.

I made this for a pot-luck dinner. The group definitely enjoyed it. I kept to the exact recipe - adding only some extra salt and pepper for flavor (otherwise would have been bland). This dish reheats really well in the microwave - makes a great leftover dish!

Instead of "bland", I would describe this version of Macaroni and Cheese as "mild". If you add some very pungent cheeses, you will get a much stronger flavor. If you compare this recipe to anything out of a box, you definately won't get the same flavor; there's 1/100th of the salt and oils. We found this delicious, epecially reheated. The roux and milk combination proved to be a perfectly thick sauce.

This was so wonderful! I made it one night when my hubby needed comfort food. I used the topping from the Macaroni and Cheese with Garlic Bread Crumbs, Plain and Chipotle instead of what this recipe called for. It was fantastic! The only thing my husband asked that I change in the future is to use less pasta (maybe .75 lb instead of 1) to make it more cheesy. Otherwise, a real keeper!

I haven't made mac and cheese from scratch in years. This was absolutely delicious. I used a very flavorful sharp cheddar, and mixed the cheese in with the sauce as many other poeple did. I was out of parmesan cheese, so for the topping I simply mixed 1/2 cup of Progresso bread crumbs with 2 Tbsp. melted butter and sprinkled that on top. It was delicious. I'll definitely make this again soon.

Rating: 3
Like the recipe, but I had to add more pasta because otherwise there was too much sauce, two more tsp of mustard, also some salt, as it was too bland with just the cheese and mustard giving it a 'kick'. I also added 2 crushed gloves of garlic and some chopped parsley. It all worked well together. Finally I left it in the oven a bit longer- for about 35 min and turned the oven temp up so that the crust on top was really nice, golden and crispy. That's my favourite part of the dish!My husband liked it too! So thumbs up!

My kid was having a birthday party and wanted macaroni and cheese on the menu. I've never made mac and cheese from scratch before, and I'm glad I chose this recipe! I substituted 1 tsp paprika in place of the cayenne because of the kids and I added the grated cheese to the milk to form a cheese sauce before adding it to the pasta. I also followed a previous suggestion and added two bay leaves to the pasta water. Because my kid likes the stuff out of the box, I was afraid to do the bread crumb mixture, but I'm sure it would have added a lot to the flavor and presentation. All in all, it was a very good recipe, although I'd probably use the cayenne next time.

Rating: 1
Yikes! I took a couple of liberties with this recipe, so maybe it was my own fault, but this was pretty grim. The changes I made: I cooked the roux longer than suggested - about 8 minutes instead of 3, until it started to brown slightly. I used more cheese than suggested, and used four kinds: parmesan, cheddar, swiss gruyere and winzerkase. I added chopped parsley before baking. And I doubled the mustard and cayenne, and substituted fusilli for elbow macaroni. All this I did to make the dish a little more interesting, but still, I found it pastey and stodgy. I like comfort food in the winter, but this was way too bland.

I replaced the parmesan cheese with Gruyere. I don't kno if cheddar and Gruyere is a bad combination, but it didn't taste as good as I had hoped. The other thing I would have done differently is to add the cheese to the milk and flour mixture to end up with a creamier texture.

This recipe will now be my base Mac 'n cheese recipe. I followed the recipe exaclty as written, and thought it was pretty good, but in the future I will double the amount of cayenne pepper, and mix some additional chedder with the parmesan in the breadcrumbs. I am contemplating the addition of minced onions to the white sauce. I do feel using fresh bread crumbs is an absolute MUST.

This was an improvement on my tried and true Betty Crocker recipe, which has never failed me, and my friend and I scarfed it up. I added a minced Vidalia and nutmeg and put a couple bay leaves, cayenne & nutmeg in the cooking water and the flavor was great. Didn't know if I'd like it with Parmesan but I did.

I thought this recipe had good flavor, but needed more sauce. I had to let it sit before baking it, and thus the pasta soaked up more sauce than it might've had I baked it right away. I used 10 oz. of cheddar, as that's how much came in the block of cheese, and that was fine, and I didn't use the full 1/3 cup of Parmesan. Next time I'll make a bit more sauce and add some chopped herbs for color and interest.

This is a simple recipe that turns out very well. It's neither dry nor overly gooey-- it's textbook Mac N Cheese. I didn't have any parmesan in the house, so I grated up romano in its place, and it was absolutely delicious. The recipe calls for 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, but given the quantity of macaroni, I used 1/2 teaspoon. Everyone loves it. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I've made the recipe on the Mueller's box of elbow macaroni for years, it was good but seemed dry. This recipe has double the sauce. This is wonderful, will be my standard recipe from now on. What did I do differently: used 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 to replace 1 cup milk, a little more dry mustard, a good bit of ground white pepper in addition to black pepper. I mixed the cheese into the sauce before adding to macaroni. Put a little cheddar in the topping, baked in 2 shallow 2 qt. dishes. Crispy top, moist interior, not bland. We loved it!

This recipe was a little bland for my taste. I added Ritz crackers on top before baking and at the end I added fresh parm cheese at the end.

Wow!! What a great Mac and Cheese recipe! I've tried many, this is the best. I did add a few things to spice it up a bit (there's nothing worse than bland food). I added about 1/4 cup chopped onion and 2 tsp minced garlic. I also added some of my left over Easter ham.

i have made MANY of the mac-n'-cheese recipes on this site, and this is by far the best one, thanks to the liberal use of bechamel...and cheese. Add some fresh nutmeg, though, if you have it - it should be well-spiced. Needs to cook about 15 minutes longer, if you like a good crust. With a nice, tart lemony salad, and a bottle of chianti, you can't go wrong. I love this nummy, comforting dish.

This is a good recipie but runs the risk of being very bland if you don't perk it up. I used extra sharp chedder, parmesean and an Italian cheese called crotonese and I use about a half cup more cheese than the recipie calls for. I added a touch of light cream with the milk and used white pepper instead of black pepper and extra mustard powder when seasoning. It came out pretty good for a simple family meal.

The best part about this is that you can make it in advance. Other mac and cheese recipes don't stand up well to advance prep. Perfect for a day when you can prep in the a.m. and just heat and serve. I use whatever cheese I have on hand and sometimes saute minced onion with the butter before adding flour.

Yuckaroni and wasted cheese is more like it. I made a beautiful roux, it thickened wonderfully and I seasoned it with salt and pepper as sugested in the recipe but then I added somecaramelized onions to give some depth. That was the last time i tasted anything worthwhile in this recipe. It was creamy--creamy blandness. I even upped the cheddar and slipped in some blue cheese for more complexity. What a waste of good cheese. The bread crumb toppingcame out loose and added nothing to the final product. If you insist on making this recipe, i suggest cutting the chilled butter into the parm-bread crumb mixture and then season it a little to taste and THEN sprinkle it on top of the casserole. This was the first time I have ever been disappointed with a recipe from Bon Appetit or Gourmet magazines. I hope it's the last...

I have made this recipe several times. Everyone loves it! I too thought that there was maybe an excess of milk and that it might be runny, but it all gets absorbed, so go with the 4 cups because you'll likely have left-overs and it won't end up dried out.

I wanted to mimic a creamy garlic cheese soup I had once, so I substituted the cheddar for montery jack and added 1 tsp. of minced garlic.

A very good mac & cheese recipe. I always add a few tablespoons of worchestershire sauce to the pasta before putting it in the baking pan. I also recommend using sharp -- not extra sharp -- cheese. Extra sharp cheddar cheese does not melt as well as sharp cheddar cheese and isn't appropriate for dishes that require baking. I generally use a bit more cheese than the recipe suggests but I have found that the amount of milk called for is perfect.

I can't believe how disappointed I am in this recipe - honestly it's probably the first failure for me! First of all, there's way too much milk.

I used extra sharp cheddar and the recipe was still pretty bland.

After dinner last night, my husband said this was the best mac and cheese I've ever made. We all liked the recipe-the sauce was creamy, flavor was good. I made lots of little changes, though. I only used about 3 1/2 c. milk. I caramelized a chopped onion, added some garlic and some sherry, and mixed this into the white sauce. I also added salt to the white sauce, and used a mixture of what cheese we had on hand-which included parmesan, sharp cheddar, gruyere, and mozzarella. It was a hit!

I finally found the recipe I was looking for. The secret is in taking time to make the roux.Make sure you cook the flour well without burning, whisking constantly. Add the milk hot and keep whisking until it starts to thicken. The preparation of the roux may take a little longer than the recipe suggests, but it's critical. I followed the recipe exactly as written and found the result to be thick, creamy and very tasty.

I usually dont prepare recipes that I dont understand, but I looked up "roux", made it and it came out good, my family liked it. I substituted garlic salt for the spices and used half cheddar and half american cheese. I also used less milk because I ran out in the middle of preparing this! But it was good, next time I think it would put in some ham or bacon and peas and serve it as a main dish, sure beats the stuff in the box!

Not the ultimate mac & cheese I was hoping for... somewhat milky... can I be surprised with 4 cups?!? I used more cheddar and it still lacked the richness of ooozing cheese... If I made it again, I would decrease the milk, hence flour, by at least 1 cup. Plus, I'm not convinced that the mustard and cayenne add anything special.

A good recipe. I altered it to suit my 10 year old nephew's taste by using 1/2 american and 1/2 mild cheddar cheese and left out the cayenne. One tip for making the white sauce, measure the milk into a glass pyrex measuring cup (the kind with the handle) and heat it in the microwave for 3-4 minutes ('till it's hot, *not* boiling). The milk blends much better into the roux if it's heated. My newphew deemed it the best M&C he'd ever had.

This is uncomplicated, satisfying American cuisine, and the ultimate comfort meal chez nous. This recipe is timeless, and almost identical to the one my mother passed down to me. Instead of elbows, I use penne rigate or rigatoni. I sometimes combine other cheeses with the cheddar (scraps of what's left in my fridge) but never more than 4 oz. of gruyere. The aroma can be overwhelming.
