Good, hearty winter soup. The dumplings in the soup itself were okay. We had a bunch of batter left over so we baked the rest at 400 degrees for fifteen minutes and they turned out very well. I might do that next time just to simplify things a bit. Also, we couldn't find andouille so we used hot Italian. Cooked it separately and added it near the end. It did look kind of odd; like ground beef in your soup but the taste was fine.

My family & I really loved this! Made as directed. It was very flavorful, the dumplings are amazing, very tender with a slight cornmeal crunch. They thickened the soup. Ok, the dumplings, you can't shape them at first, just drop on to the sheet as best you can. I also made them smaller and got about 22. After refrigerating 1 hour they can be better shaped into sort of a ball form as you drop them in the simmering soup. Handle as little as possible even when mixing. They were perfectly done after 20 mins. Really liked the collards here too. Definitely plan to make this again. Inexpensive, easy and delicious.

Excellent! Tasty. Used kielbasa and 1/2 of hot pepper sauce.

A keeper. Definitely a fan of smaller dumplings here. For those of you concerned re soggy sausage. Brown the sausage & set it aside. De-glaze the pan with the broth and add the sausage back in just before serving to maintain the crispy texture.

This was fantastic and disappeared in no time. I had no problems with the dumplings and thought they were delicious - I took another reviewer's advice and did them by 1/2 tablespoons (although I soon ran out of real estate and had to steam the rest of the separately). Used only 1 can of tomatoes, Sriracha for the hot sauce, tofurkey italian sausage, and a turnip/collards/spinach greens combo. Kind of annoyed everyone gobbled it down - I was really hoping for leftovers today!!!! Guess I'll just have to make it again...

Yum! The dumplings were a little heavy, but that could be because I chilled them in the fridge for maybe an hour. Used a big bunch of turnip greens, about 12 oz. of local sausage, homemade chicken stock plus some water and just one can of tomatoes. Plenty of flavor and it's faster than a lot of long-simmering soups, and hearty with the dumplings. Will become a regular way to cook up greens.

Great soup! I make it often. I had a vegetarian to dinner last night so I made it with vegetable broth and cooked the sausage separately and served it on the side for the meat eaters to add. I actually liked it better in some ways because the sausage wasn't overcooked, as some other reviewers have commented on. It was a hit with everyone.

Pretty good soup - definitely hearty and goot for a cool/cold night. Tomato flavor dominated for sure. As often happens when simmering meat, the sausage lost a good bit of it's flavor to the soup. Makes the soup taste better, but the meat itself became a little bland! The dumplings will swell up when in the soup, so I suggest making them so that they seem a little too small when you're looking at them (pre-cooking). You'll end up with more like 20-24 instead of 18.

Great soup! I used white cornmeal instead of yellow,because I had a stone ground bag of it I purchased on vacation. Whatever you use it's still a great dish.

This was a wonderful soup! Great taste! I could only get 12 oz andouille, so I sauteed some pancetta to add more porky flavor. Used all collards, easily available. I added a little extra allspice, and loved the flavor. Because of all the reviews about tough dumplings, I used a recipe and method from ansonmills.com that worked beautifully, steaming the dumplings separately and then adding them to the soup when served. I will make this so much we'll probably get tired of it!

I really loved this soup. I never made a dumpling until I tried this recipe - they were delicious. Nothing about this recipe disappointed me, except we didn't have any leftovers.

Love, love, love this recipie! I've made these dumplins (twice now) as you would shape gnocchi, then cut them in half. This was a hit with everyone! :)

I can not explain how delicious this was. Only substitute was low-fat kielbasa instead of andouille. I upped the hot sauce a bit, but it was not necessary (next time I'll leave it as the recipe calls for). Can I say enough good things about this recipe??? The dumplings were fantastic! Also made great leftovers for lunch the next day.

Quite tasty! I used italian sausage instead of andouille and subbed in a dash each of ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg for the allspice. I also added a few handfuls of spinach leaves in addition to the other greens. I loved the flavors in this recipe, but the dumplings didn't work out as I'd hoped. They never rose or solidified at all, so I ended up dropping liquid batter in spoonfuls into the soup. The dumpling dough largely dissolved; only a few bits remained together. Despite this, I really enjoyed the soup and will definitely make it again, though maybe with cornbread on the side as other reviewers suggested.

I enjoyed this hearty stew; good flavors, and filling on a cold late winter day. I even managed to please a picky teen! I did make a couple of modifications to the original recipe. I subbed in Tofurky Italian Sausage. And for the greens, I used rainbow chard, collards, and kale- I bet any greens would be jsut fine. The dumplings were so-so and time consuming. To speed up this meal, I would follow others advice and use ready made polenta to bake or pan fry cakes to go with the soup, or just bake a pan of cornbread.

I followed this recipe every step of the way - waiting over night and what a disappointment. It sounds much better than it is. I will use parts of it for other recipes but overall I don't understand why you had to wait preferrably overnight. It was way too time consuming for what you got out of it. The dumplings were too heavy. I like lighter dumplings.

This is the first time I have ever commented on a recipe--that's how much I liked it! Amazing recipe considering the small investment in time. I made a few small changes: added a tiny bit of smoked paprika, used collard greens only, canned roasted tomatoes, self rising white cornmeal mix ( subbed for the cornmeal), homemade chicken stock, and added homemade adobo sauce I made from smoked pequin peppers found at the local farmers market. I browned the onions to get them caramelized to add more flavor. My favorite part was the dumplings--although some were a little heavy, most of them turned out very light. Also, I didn't bother rolling them in my hands, but droppped them by spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet.

This was so easy, I used frozen greens. My husband is gluten free so the dumplings were perfect. I would add a can of beans to help fill the soup. We just loved how rich it was.

This is a good winter soup. I made the dumplings and thought they were really good, and not at all difficult to make. I followed the directions as written, which resulted in light, fluffy cornmeal dumplings. There is too much sausage in this recipe for my taste, and I will cut the quantity in half the next time I make it. I used half a bunch of mustard greens and half a bunch of kale.

Great recipe with lots of flavors and texture. I skipped the dumplings this time but will make them the net time. I can see that they would be a great addition.

This is not an 'easy' meal, but it is really good. I felt the dumplings were too work-intensive for how little they brought to the dish, though my husband loved them. Next time I'll just serve cornbread alongside, or a crusty baguette. The soup - which I made with small Italian sausage balls and no mustard greens, + spinach - was so good. Good broth, good greens, good flavor from the sausage. I'll be making this one for years.

This was a delicous and hearty soup that I have made twice, each time receiving raving reviews. I found the dumplings easy to make and a big part of why we liked this soup. The flavors are wonderful and a "comfort food" on a cold night. I used a mixture of greens and probably added a little extra.

Rating: 4
Like several reviewers, we skipped the dumplings. Instead, my husband ate this as a stew, and I ate this as a stew served over a polenta cake (as recommend by another reviewer.) We *might* try this with our flour dumplings (used for Chicken and Dumplings), but...we'll see. You certainly don't need any form of dumpling to make this recipe amazing. Another one pot wonder (my favorites!) --simply throw everything into one pot to cook. My husband doesn't like andouille sausage, so we simply used Spicy Italian Sausage links. Next time, I won't even bother with the links and use ground sausage instead. All the spices I had on hand were dried, not fresh, and we used Kale instead of the other recommend greens. My husband told me that he now loves Kale because of this stew.

This was quite good. The whole thing was very easy to throw together and quite satisfying on a blustery night. The dumplings were fluffy and tasty and all that, but the soup would have been just as good with polenta as another reviewer suggested or a piece of cornbread on the side.

The soup was good, and I will make it again. BUT, the dumplings were very hard and doughy, and I'll not include them next time around. I made the soup without the sausage, and it was still yummy.

Great Winter soup. Very filling. I could only find Kale but it turned out great. I thought there was too much tomato when I was making it but it turned out fine. Loved the dumplings. I want to try again with mustard greens and a nice merguez.

This soup was delicious. I used spicy lamb sausage instead of andouille. I used cornmeal for the dumplings and they turned out perfectly - they didn't even thicken the broth. I think the key is letting them set out for the full hour before rolling them into balls. My hands were also dry while I shaped them, so they weren't slimy when I dropped them into the broth. I will definitely make this recipe again, and next time I'm going to make the dumplings smaller so there are more of them. They're the best part!

All in all, this recipe was pretty good (and the fact that it is really easy make always help.) I too had problems with the dumplings, hence the three spoons.

Really simple, really good, Added some Cayenne and Ginger (I love spicy food!) and it was really yummy. I defiantly wish I'd followed advice and used Corn Flour as opposed to Corn Meal - the dumplings were dense and could have been lighter. Can't wait for the leftovers!

Very good soup but sooooo much stuff! Go with your own judgement of adding enough greens. I just stopped when it looked stuffed. Dont make the mistake of using preminced garlic instead of the whole crushed...it looks kinda odd floating about and the little bits aren't entirely pleasant. I added an extra half measure of the allspice, a splash of ginger and a dash of paprika to the spice mix. White pepper instead of black. Also I only used one can of diced tomatoes and grilled the equivalent of the second can then stewed them up on the stove before adding them. Gave them a lovely smokey aftertaste to complement the soup. Like alot of the reviewers I didn't care much for the dumplings even after trying an amalgam of the suggestions. So what I ended up doing is removing the dumplings and grilling(you can also broil or pan fry) some polenta, cut it up and tossed it in to the bowls as I was serving. This allows you to still get that delicious corn flavor and grainy texture without the hassle and mediocrity of the dumplings.

Made this last night for dinner and just wolfed down another bowl of leftovers for lunch. YUM. Made as directed with the exception of the sausage. Couldn't find andouille at our market so used chorizo instead. Flavor was excellent and instead of chunks of sausage, resulted in more of a ground beef texture throughout the soup. Used full teaspoon of green tabasco and the spiciness was just perfect. Will definitely make this again.

I also used 100% collard greens in this dish. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. I'll definitely be making it again, especially for the dumplings which were airy and tender. It's easy and can be ready in closer to 1.5 hours than 2. The only change I would make is cutting the sausage from three links to two. It was just a tad to meaty. Highly recommended.

This was a perfect rainy night warmer. We love it, and will be making it again. The only thing I change was using all collards since that was what was available to me. In regards to the dumplings, I found mine very tender and not too crunchy. One thing I nearly missed in the recipe was letting the dumpling mixture sit for at least an hour before separating it. I just made the mixture first then did the rest of my prep and caught up on dish washing. It was an easy hour to pass.

An addendum to my 1/6/11 review: To those with dumpling troubles, consider substituting 3/4 cup corn "flour" (Bob's Red Mill is one brand) for the 3/4 cup cornmeal. You might find your dumplings more tender, less cornmeal-crunchy. Good luck!

this recipe was easy, rustic, and perfect for a frigid philadelphia night. we made a vegetarian version, subbing vegan sausages for the real ones, and veg stock for the chicken stock. i thought the dumpling were a snap and really added some soul to the dish. i'm also certain that the soup will only improve with a few days of sitting and make a great winter lunch. awesome.

My boyfriend and I liked this a lot - flavor was very good and effort was minimal. Might not do dumplings next time - for us they didn't seem to add a lot. Added a can of garbanzo beans toward the end liked the add.

I just finished a bowl of this soup, left over from last night. Delicious! My store doesn't carry bags of mixed greens as the recipe called for (collard, mustard, and turnip). In fact, all I could find were collard greens, so I used 12 oz of those. Next time I'd make the dumplings a little smaller. The soup is so chock full of greens and sausage that the dumplings didn't sink at all; they stayed on top the whole time. I think a smaller size would help ensure they're cooked all the way through. Lastly, though no other reviewer has mentioned this, I want to talk about the soup's heat. It calls for 1 tsp of hot pepper sauce. My husband and I both really like spicy foods, though our kids do not. It didn't seem an outrageous amount, so I put in the entire tsp. Yowee, was it HOT! My kids wouldn't eat it. Though the soup was still delicious, it was too hot, in my opinion. BUT--get this--the leftovers today at lunch were excellent; time had dissipated some of the heat and it was perfect. Bear that in mind when making it. If you're not wild about spicy foods, start with 1/2 tsp and taste as you go. You can always add a drop or two of Tabasco right into your bowl.

Soup was really good - great flavour and also very "pretty" with red / green and yellow of dumplings. Dumplings turned out perfectly. They were very light, even on day two.. There were maybe too many of them though, I would half the amount next time. I also made them very small - I did a "test dumpling" after reading the negative reviews on here to make sure I liked it, and it really swelled! I cut them all in half. I would not recommend subbing an italian sausage - you need something cooked and a bit smoky, not fresh sausage. I wish my sausage had been just a bit spicier...

We both ate two bowls of this and even our three-year-old ate quite a bit. Like others, I loved the soup but was a bit dissatisfied with the dumplings. Next time I would make them smaller to allow them to cook more fully. Omitting the dumplings for me would be a mistake. Half the wonderfullness of this soup was that there were little cornmeal flecks in each bite.

Rating: 2
The soup was quite good, the dumplings an abomination, which is why I give this soup an average of 2 forks. My only other experience with soup dumplings is making light-as-air matzo balls for chicken soup. By contrast, the cornmeal dumplings were leaden, and tasted of raw cornmeal despite simmering in the soup for the recommended time plus reheat time. Were I to make this again, I'd eliminate the dumplings and serve with cornbread on the side.

Rating: 3
Good, healthy, hearty, warming. Easy, too. This was my first time making dumplings and they were a success. Just a note to fellow dumpling novices: don't give in to the temptation to make them bigger--they puff an incredible amount during cooking. And to the spice wary: I left out the hot pepper sauce since my andouille promised to be very hot. Glad I did; in fact though I placed bottles of hot sauce on the table, no one used it! May be too spicy for kids; was for mine.

I made this recipe but doubled the amount of greens (it was an exceptional week at the CSA) and omitted the dumplings. The soup was absolutely amazing. The andouille sausage and hot sauce plus the pepperry greens made this have a nice bite to it. Loved it and will definately make again.

Made this tonight and it was amazing. I did make a few minor tweaks based on what I had on hand- turkey andouille and barely half a pound of it, turkey stock, and a bunch of kale instead of the mixed greens. I found the soup deeply satisfying, and I did make the dumplings in advance- my first time making dumplings! They were delicious.

Excellent soup. I just dropped the cornbread mixture into the soup using spoons instead of forming the dumplings. Also, I added them at the same time as the greens (I prefer my greens less cooked).

This is a fantastic recipe. Healthy, hearty, and flavorful, it makes a perfect post-holiday winter meal. It can easily be made vegetarian by substituting vegetable broth for the chicken broth and your favorite brand of vegetarian Italian sausage links for the andouille, which is what I did. If you're in a hurry, as I was when I made this last night, you can easily skip the resting and shaping of the dumpling mixture. Just mix it up before starting the rest of the soup and then drop it in by spoonfuls after the greens have been wilted. The dumplings might not be quite as light and fluffy, but if you're short on time, it's the way to go.
