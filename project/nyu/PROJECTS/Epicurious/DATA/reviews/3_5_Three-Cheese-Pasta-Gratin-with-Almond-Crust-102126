Yummy! A perfect dish for a cold winter's night. I did add more hot sauce because I love it.

This is great mac-n-cheese - certainly not the very best, but very unique, and everyone had seconds. I substitued smoked almonds and it added a nice light smoky flavor.

Not bad. Would be a good dish to bring to a potluck dinner.

Very Good. I felt that it had too much bread in it so I adjusted the recipe by using the bread mixture on the bottom only then using cheddar and parmesan as a topping and cooking less (20min). I bought pre-grated cheese so the work wasn't that much. Also I thought the pepper Jack would be a bit much so I withdrew the extra pepper sauce. Excellent.

I am not that picky of a home chef and maybe I set my expectations too high with this recipe (after reading all the great reviews) but I was a little disappointed with this recipe. It's not that it was bad, I guess it just wasn't as decadent or rich as I was expecting. I followed the recipe almost exactly, using 5 cups of milk instead of 4 and even adding a bit more cheese, and I felt that it was just "ok". Not bad, but not spectacular. It seems much too fattening and even a little time-consuming (grating all the cheese, etc) to warrant less than fantastic results. But again, perhaps I set my expectations too high. I am surprised I feel this way, after reading mostly awesome reviews, but alas, I can't bring myself to get wildy excited about this one. :-(

Forgot to mention that I don't like the hot pepper Monterey Jack so I used Bleu cheese instead, then cheddar and parmesan. You might like to slowly add cheeses to taste as you add them to the milk mixture. Some graters make more cupsfull than others. So don't add all at once. In fact next time I am going to try less of each cheese to lower the fat.

After I mixed the cheeses into the milk mixture and tasted, it was wonderful. I baked too long and cheese taste was not as good or intense as when I first blended it with pasta. One idea I have is to bake plain pasta 15 minutes (no cheese) then add cheese and cook another 15 minutes.

Perfect comfort food! I substituted 1/2 of the cheddar for Gruyere. doubled it for a baby shower and it was all gone...

Very comforting. I used mozzarella and a cut up jalapeño, and non-fat evaporated milk (2 cans + 1 cup water - I know its still not low fat). I forget the hot pepper sauce, and it was really very mild and tasty. I made it again with 1/2 the pepper sauce and pecans instead of almonds. That worked.

WOW, this was yummy. We had to fight the 4 year old for the last bite! Only change I'd make would be add a little more hot pepper sauce. Wonderful flavor and don't leave out the almonds. Gave it a very nice topping.

I was looking for a good recipe for homemade macaroni & cheese for quite some time, and this just happened to be the first one I decided to try. Well, I lucked out because this is one great recipe. I omitted the hot sauce, and it still had lots of flavor and just enough kick. Even my fiance liked it and I never thought I would be able to wean him away from the disgusting stuff that comes in a box. More good news: It's even better reheated :).

This recipe is a slam dunk. It even freezes well - for those who want to make it for a smaller family. I've made it according to the recipe and it has been a fabulous treat for cold winter days!

Now THAT'S mac'n'cheese! This was fun to serve, telling your guests you are serving macaroni and cheese. They are expecting one thing, then you put this on their plates. Everybody loved this!!! Just right on the spiciness and the almond-breadcrumb crust was a great twist. I threw a handful of almonds on top for looks. Ya gotta try this!

As far as I'm concerned, this is the uber-recipe of mac-and-cheese. You MUST use good fresh parmesan that you grate yourself. I just throw a chunk into the food processor and pulverize it; quick and easy and it melts well. Also, to get the cheeses to melt well and turn into a creamy sauce, you may need to put it back on low heat for a minute or two. I also highly recommend adding a couple cloves of garlic to the breadcrumb mixture. And for those who want a little more bite, add some chipotle to the sauce.

Mine was grainy too. I think that part of the problem was using grated parmesean as the recipe calls for - shredded probably would have worked better (the finely grated parm didn't melt and made the cheese sauce all lumpy). Other than that, the taste was fine. I just couldn't get over the texture.

We have made this several times and I really love it. However, for some reason, mine always comes out a little bit grainy. The cheese sauce sort of clumps around the noodle instead of coating it. Is this how it is supposed to be? If not, can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?

Yum yum! This is a Thanksgiving standard in my family. It's a little too spicy for kids, but the adults devour it every year. I love the addition of almonds and the cavatappi noodles are perfect with this.

What a great mac and cheese recipe - this one is in my standard rotation. I make it full fat for guests or parties, but I cut the cheese in half and add broccoli when cooking for my family. I also sprinkle a little parsley on top for contrast.

This dish is rich to the point of virtual toxicity. It was tasty, certainly, but I actually felt bad -- really bad -- after eating it. Especially avoid if you're someone who's not eating a lot of fat in the rest of your diet.

Very good mac and cheese recipe. Not difficult and doesn't take long at all. It was a hit. I'm not giving it four forks, though, only because I wish it had just a bit more BITE.

This is one of the best mac and cheese recipes I have tasted. The crunchy almond crust really makes it something special. Be warned, however, that it is in no way low-fat. There is a ton of cheese in there. However, that said, it is perfect for that cold-weather, post-skiing famished evening where you have a hungry horde to feed. We didn't use a food processor, only a knife, and it came out fine. The crumbs were bigger, but that gave it more "body" and I didn't spend a whole lot of time chopping. Using the old-fashioned implement in this recipe may be easier than the food-processor.

Yum! I will make this again. Have wash the food processer in between cheeses and crumb mixture and I hated that. I added some dried minced garlic to crumb mixture. Over-all very good!AmAx

This was a great macaroni and cheese recipe. We used a variety of nuts and seeds (leftover from a nut loaf) instead of almonds.

To the cook without "hot pepper Monterey Jack cheese", Monterey Jack cheese is a very mild cheese used in many mexican-type recipes, just use a mild white cheese and add some hot peppers sliced fairly fine; such as jalepenos. In any case this looks like a great recipe with or without "hot pepper Monterey Jack cheese" .

I have made this several times for luncheons and everyone always raves that it is the best mac n' cheese they ever had. I have given away this recipe dozens of times.

Although this recipe takes a while to make it is definitely worth it. I have made this for many different people and all love it. I usually make extra topping, as that's my husband's favorite part. I also substitute peanuts for almonds, which is tasty too.

I forgot to use extra milk because it definitely needed it. I thought it could be a little more spicy, but my husband loved it as is. It really needs more sauce to it and I would add more hot sauce and red pepper to it.

Great comfort food. I followed the suggestion of adding more milk in the recipe (5 cups), also added julienne strips of ham and broccoli pieces to make it a one dish meal. I will definitely make it again.

Made this for Easter and it was a hit. Didn't use hot sauce and substituted Gruyere for pepper jack (for the little kids), used 5 cups milk and it was wonderfully creamy and cheesey. Absolutely loved the almond crust - great contrast with the creamy noodles. Will definately make again.

I found the spiciness of the pepper jack cheese a little disconcerting in a macaroni recipe. Without the hot pepper sauce, with more cheddar and less pepper jack and double the amount of almonds, it would be perhaps more predictable but also more pleasing. Also, I found the sauce a little dry; perhaps it would be better with more milk.

I really enjoyed this version of mac and cheese. My husband was put off by the almond crust (he thinks of nuts as something to put in or on sweets), next time I will just omit the nuts, the sauce was perfect,very creamy !!

Despite the fact that my boyfriend pours soy sauce all over this and every other mac and cheese ever created (strange i know) I've made this many times and it is always a hit. The almonds really add a nice touch.

This was very tasty I made it for my family and some family members from out of town. Everyone loved this dish I did however take the advice of some other reviewers and increased the milk to 5 cups it made it nice and creamy there were 6 of us I served it with some ham and there was plenty for all. but it will also make great leftovers. I also found that if you use sliced almonds they will break up in a bag and you will not need to use your blender

This was an easy and tasty dinner. I took the advice from previous reviewers and increased the milk to 5 cups to avoid dryness. I didn't have the hot pepper sauce, so i threw in a dash of tabasco for an extra kick. The exrta milk really worked because the dish turned out very creamy. I'll definitely make this one again. Great comfort food.

Ah, this was so yummy. I want to say just like Mom used to make, but I was raised on the boxed mac and cheese. To think I thought that was good stuff! I can never go back now, no matter how tricky it is for me to make a perfect cheese sauce!

Rating: 3
Mmmmmmm....incredibly tasty! It has a wonderful comgination of consistancies....creamy from the cheeses and that crunch from the almond-bread crumb mixture. And the hot sauce gives it that extra zip! Try not to bake it too long, to prevent that delicious sauce from evaporating. Broiling for 3 minutes will brown it nicely, but don't busy yourself with something else, as it is a just seconds between brown and burnt! The kids will love it, and so will the kid in you!

This was a very special macaroni and cheese recipe. It would be good for a family because both the kids and the adults like it. The almonds add a little crunch and it makes great left overs. I found it to be a little dry, though. I would somehow make a more creamy next time.

Instead of using the cheddar and jack cheeses I substituted american and mixed a little romano in with the parmesan....Instead of sauteing the garlic i infused the milk with the garlic and dried smoked chipoltes...I also had to use walnuts instead of almonds..and surprisingly it came out fabulous and creamy....By far the best man and cheese recipe I have made...Can't wait to try it the way it's supposed to be made

We quite enjoyed this one. We've got another spicy mac and cheese recipe that we like so I substituted mozarella for the hot pepper Monterey Jack to tone it down for the kids. The almonds add a nice touch, especially if left coarse.

If you like macaroni and cheese, you should try this recipe. I've always been a fan of traditional macaroni and cheese recipes and although this one uses some surprising ingredients (almonds, cheese combo.)you'll still have a Howard Johnson's flashback -- which I happen to think is great.
