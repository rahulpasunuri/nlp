I've been making this dip for about 10 years. It is always a hit. People think it takes a true gourmet to make it, even though it is so easy. LOVE IT! I had something similar at a restaurant once but they added feta. It was a nice touch.

This was perfect as is. The strong flavors were delicious - you just have to know your "audience." I know which of my friends to whip this up for. Served with pita and extra cilantro, it hits the spot.

I agree, very strong flavors so the cream cheese should be doubled. I also roasted my own peppers. Guests enjoyed it. The best use however, was the next day as a sandwich spread for a veggie wrap with grilled zucchini & onions. Really delicious.

The finished product just doesn't justify the time and cost of ingredients. The sundried tomato flavor overwhelms everything else.

With a few simple modifications this was a great dip. I recommend roasting a red bell pepper yourself rather than using ones from a jar. I also agree with other reviewers that extra cream cheese helps - maybe 6 to 8 oz rather than 4 oz.

This recipe is great!! With a little tweaking (translation: completely ignoring the portions specified) it is possibly one of the better dips out there... just make sure you go a little wild with the cream cheese because i tend to think that without quite literally tons of it, this may be a little too potent!! this was a hit with all... served it in a bread bowl with homemade pita chips... i think i've found my new fave picnic food...

Very easy and wonderful flavors. I add twice the cream cheese and serve on a cheese platter with the Rosemary Shortbread.

Definitely very strong on the tomato and pepper flavors. I also doubled the cream cheese. I think it would be better to use fresh jalapeno peppers instead of pickled, since the preserved flavor came through in the finished product. I would also recommend thinning with oil rather than water (I used the oil from the jar of roasted red peppers and some of the tomato water), to enrich the flavor. (I did use regular cream cheese rather than light or fat-free, and I still felt that it needed a little more oil.)

The party raved about this one! I added twice as much cream cheese because I felt it was a little too strong in the sun-dried tomato / roasted red pepper taste. The jalapeno gave it a nice unexpected kick.

This recipe is featured in the Junior League of Houston's excellent "Stop and Smell the Rosemary." It is always a hit at parties...

I made this for company and there weren't any comments one way or another. Polite guests I guess! I did'nt like it. The sun-dried tomatoes overpowered the other ingredients. I added 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of 4 but that didn't help much. It wasn't a flop just not great.

This was a great summer snack. It went extremely well with corn chips and sun-dried tomato crackers. Excellent for anyone throwing a party, or just sitting around the house.

Although it wasn't my favorite (maybe I'm just a guacamole girl), my guests raved and EVERYONE asked for the recipe so that's gotta be worth something.
