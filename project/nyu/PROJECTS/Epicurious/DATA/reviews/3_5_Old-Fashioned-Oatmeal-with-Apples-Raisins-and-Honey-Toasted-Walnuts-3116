I make this regularly, from October thru March. I follow the recipe with the following changes: apples are shredded instead of chopped, skip the sugar altogether, use sweetened dried cranberries or a dried apple/cranberry mix in lieu of the raisins and add a dollop of vanilla. I'm not keen on yogourt so I skipped that .. and couldn't be bothered to do the nuts. It's delicious and keeps well in the fridge for a few days. I re-warm in the microwave with skim milk and fruit == breakfast!

Edible but did not like this.

This was pretty good! Neither my husband or I are big oatmeal fans but I wanted to try this anyway. I used craisins instead of raisins and they were very good. The yogurt we used was too bitter and I think it would be better without it.

I have finally learned that I do not like sweetened oatmeal. This recipe isn't for me.

Excellent. Does need all the liquid called for plus some. Used half milk, half water instead of just water. Well received by my Book Group!! Also used Trader Joes mixed dried fruit instead of just the raisins.

The best oatmeal I've ever tasted! I added a sprinkling of flax seed and a touch of olive oil. Delicious!

I always love the idea of oatmeal, but never the way it actually ends up tasting. Finally, oatmeal that doesn't disappoint! Next time I think I'll make more of the honeyed walnuts because they totally make the dish.

This was a spectacular breakfast. I used peanuts instead of walnuts because my husband doesn't like walnuts, but it still tasted great! I didn't put the sugar in because we don't need it, and something that I liked about not putting the sugar in was that it wasn't a sweet dish except when you ate the pieces of apple, raisins, cranberries (I added those), or peanuts. I'll definitely make it again!

Pretty quick and good

Delicious! And a nice change of pace vs. using rolled oats. I do think the oats need longer than 5 minutes to cook fully, and it serves way more than 4 (but leftovers have been very satisfying). I also used milk to cook the oats, as other reviewers suggested.

Made it with water...would try milk next time. Pretty quick and tasty.

I made with milk and omitted the walnuts, and I topped it with maple syrup. Yum! I can see how the walnuts would put this in 4-fork territory. I used normal old fashioned oats.

I found this recipe a few days ago and I'm already addicted to it! I cooked the oats in 2% milk instead of water, and added some butter. I agree with other reviewers that steel cut oats are a must. This might just be the best oatmeal I've ever had!

Yummy! my only complaint was that it needed more spice in the end...I added a pinch of nutmeg and ground cloves and thought it was much better after.

I agree it is better using a good quality irish oatmeal (steel cut). I use half milk, half water. Then add 50% more water and same amount of Trader Joes all fruit dried trail mix (bananas, mangoes, cranberries, variousraisins). I have made this twice for a camping crowd and served it with extra milk, brown sugar or honey, cinnamon, crushed pecans to taste and not one camper said they missed their traditional greasy fried breakfast.

I eat oatmeal for breakfast almost every morning but I was getting a bit bored and thought I'd see what Epicurious had to offer. Wow! I love that this is so healthy but tastes decadent. Sometimes I have it for breakfast and then at the end of the day as desert. I definitely recommend heartier oats (quick oats are great, if you're hanging wallpaper :). I don't bother candying the nuts, I use toasted pecans. I doubt I'll ever make regular oatmeal again.

Like other users, I modified the recipe a little (used quick oats, didn't add the nuts for my kids, added the honey to the oatmeal, used half whole milk, half water). It was still delicious.

This is good but there's another really easy(and tasty!) way to dress up oatmeal. Just cook the oatmeal as you normally would, but substitute milk for the water and add a splash of vanilla. top with brown sugar, butter, and a splash of half and half. As simple as it sounds it's very reminiscent of creme brullee!

Loved this oatmeal, but strayed a bit from the original recipe. I used steel cut oats- they take longer to cook, but have a nuttier flavor and less mushy texture. It turned out great. Also, used candied pecans to save time and added dries cranberries to the raisins. Definitely a keeper!

I made this oatmeal this morning and found it to be really yummy! I run a daycare out of my home, so I nixed the walnuts and honey and was out of raisins. The kid who never eats oatmeal had two bowls! I think next time I'll cook it a little longer after adding the apples as I like thicker oatmeal, but the taste was great!

This was great! Made it this morning for friends and was told that it rivaled the $7 oatmeal you get in fancy restaurants. Substituted applesauce for apple juice (plus a little water), and used almonds coated w/brown rice syrup instead of walnuts/honey as I didn't have either. Fantastic. Yummy. Will make for family at Christmas.

Very yummy. I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts, and I didn't have any apple juice so I used apple sauce - it was still delicious.

This was very yummy on a chilly morning. I didn't change anything, except skiping the yogurt and adding a pat of butter on top. It is extremely satisfying.

This was very good. I made half the recipe, and added some quinoa along with the oatmeal. The quinoa takes longer to cook - I cooked on low the whole time for about 20 mins. I also omitted the brown sugar and used a combination of rice syrup and maple syrup. Very filling, and a great, healthy breakfast. Even better when the weather turns colder.

Great breakfast. I used craisanettes instead of raisans and added bannana. loved it!

Excellent! Very good. The only changes I made were to use soya milk in place of the 3c. water that is called for, and to use a soya yogurt.

I didn't have apple juice and used water instead and it was still delicious. My daughter thought the apples should be chunkier and did not want the nuts or raisins. I didn't coat the nuts in honey because I didn't want it to be too sweet.

The combination of textures ( crunchy nuts, chewy raisins, creamy yogurt) is really delicious. I am a sworn oatmeal enemy and I loved this recipe!

This delicious oatmeal can be reheated if you have leftovers!
