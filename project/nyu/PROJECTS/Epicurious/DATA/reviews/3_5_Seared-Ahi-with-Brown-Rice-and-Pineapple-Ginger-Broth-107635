I made this tonight and it was delicious. It doesn't take as long as to make as it might look. My daughter (age 10) didn't care for the ahi (sacrilege!!), but she enjoyed the broth, rice, and green onions. I think this could work with teriyaki chicken, too, which I'll try next time. My son, husband and I devoured ours.

i bought some ahi (frozen at trader joe's and then found this recipe to accompany it because i love all three parts, ahi, brown rice and dashi broth. i found the broth part the most interesting, and kept and froze it to use in the future as a base for misc. seafood and broth meal. yummmm.

This is a really unusual, tasty and fun to make dish. Don't be put off by making the dashi (fish stock) from scratch. Although at first glance, it looks like a lot of steps, it's really quite easy and the results cannot compare to dashi from a powder mix. I think I would like this dish to have an even more intense pineapple flavor, so next time I might use pure pineapple concentrate rather than pineapple-orange.
