Loved this recipe and so did the people eating this cake. It is very moist and flavorful. I sprayed the pan with Pam and floured with flour mixed with cocoa and the cake popped right out. I used the extra dark cocoa and did not use the mini chips. But I did a ganache topping using chocolate chips and cream. I made this for my boss' birthday party and will make it again for my son-in-law next month.

This cake was okay. I probably will not make it again. But it was easy and quick to make, which was nice. The recommended 50 minutes is too long (at least for my oven).

This is one of my favorite cakes! Quick and relatively easy with a rich, deep flavor. Unlike other reviewers, I have not had issues with the chocolate chips sinking, uneven baking, or cake sticking to the pan. I do usually cut the espresso significantly in the glaze. A chocolate ganache would also be delicious!

This cake is easy to make, looks pretty, and delicious! I followed another poster's direction of substituting 1/2 c buttermilk for 1/2 c oil and that worked just fine. I mixed the batter by hand instead of using the mixer to save the extra cleaning and effort and it worked out just fine. My mini chips did not sink to the bottom as they did for others. Also I didn't think the coffee flavoring was overwhelming as a few others reviewers did. Overall, this is a winner! Very chocolatey and yummy.

Tastes great, was surprisingly not overly sweet, though it is rich overall. Nice balance of chocolate and a subtle hint of cinnamon. I substituted buttermilk for half of the oil and used mini chips. The batter is very thin, next time I will add the chips to the top once I've poured the batter into the bundt pan. I baked it for about 60 minutes and took it out worrying that it would burn. After cooling, I discovered it was still too soft in the middle, but still good enough to eat. I will definitely try again.

The reviews looked great so I wanted to give this recipe a try. There were three test tasters  one who never drinks coffee, one who drinks coffee every day, and one who drinks decaf occasionally but loves coffee taste. The person who never drinks coffee thought the espresso flavoring was overpowering. So if you are making the cake for a crowd that includes non-coffee drinkers, you may want to ease up on the espresso powder. I could use some help with the timing. I baked as instructed but at 50 minutes, the center was still uncooked. It took 12 more minutes for a toothpick to come out clean from the center, but the edges were way too hard to eat. So we just cut huge slices and ate out the moist middles, which were fabulous :-P However, next time I dont want to waste half the cake so I may have to try cooking at a lower temperature for a longer period of time.

I tried this cake on a group of people at a party and it was an absolute hit! I didn't do the sauce as directed, but instead made a simple ganache using chocolate and whipping cream and then dusted the cake with unsweetened cocoa after the ganache had solidified. It was absolutely outstanding and super easy to make.

Love, love, love the cake. Amazing flavor, very intense and chocolatey. My only caveat is that the cake did not come cleanly out of the pan. I thought that maybe it was because I used PAM but my sister (who loved the cake so much, she made one 4 days later) had the same problem using oil. Is it the chips? Any ideas?

I was excited to accidently come across this recipe since I have a large decorative bundt cake pan. However, this recipe did not even come close to filling it up, and even though I checked on it after 35 minutes at 325, it was burnt. I guess it wasn't my day to bake.

This was great -- served it to 7 guests and they loved it. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to sub out half the oil for buttermilk, and that was great. I did find the cake a bit too cinnamon-y, so I'd probably cut it down next time. This was great with vanilla ice cream. Make sure you get mini chocolate chips -- I know from past experience that using larger chips would have caused problems.

The icing was delicious and I'll definitely use it again on other cakes but the cake itself came out a little dry. I was short on oil so only used about 3/4 cup and accidentally only put in 1/2 cup of choc chips so I would try the cake again using the right amounts and see if that helped. And I'd double the icing and cover the cake completely with it. Very easy and quick recipe.

This was awful. Dry and like a rock. Not enough chocolate flavor either.

This cake was delicious, but the chips sunk to the bottom of the bundt pan (top of cake) thus it was too gooey to come out like a regular cake would. Next time I will butter and flour and use mini-chips less of them and not fold in, just pour batter into pan then sprinkle top with chips so they don't sink!

We are very fussy about our chocolate cakes, but this was one met our high standards. Very moist and chocolatey, and the cinnamon made it special. YUM! I'm going to make it again very soon!

The cake is wonderful, moist with great chocolate and cinnamon flavor. We did not care for the icing though...Next time I'll find another icing but will make the cake again for sure.

This is a keeper! I replaced 1/2 cup of oil with 1/2 cup buttermilk per one reviewer's suggestion and it was perfect. Very moist, and good blend of flavors.

Followed suggestion of using 10 cp bundt pan...perfect. It would have not looked as nice in a larger pan. Also followed suggestion to use 1/4 cp regular cocoa and 1/4 c dark; made the cake a little less sweet which complemented the espresso cinnamon flavor. Curious how all regular cocoa would taste and may try that next time. Nice texture, came out of pan easily and chips did not sink. Good with a cold glass of milk.

This was easy to make and delicious! Could be made a day ahead- still tasted great the next day. I love the coffee, cinnamon, chocolate combo.

i made these when my boyfriend's cousins were coming to dinner. his cousin loves cinnamon and here in france there are not very many cinnamon desserts. she was so excited. i made these in mini brioche moulds because that was all i had. it made the presentation on the plate much nicer. i fancied it up a bit with some "cinnamon" ice cream, store-bought vanilla softened just enough to where you can mix in the cinnamon, place back in the freezer. perfect pairing!

I like this flavor of this cake and it is definitely easy. However I didn't use mini chips and the sunk to the bottom and stuck to the pan. Reading others' reviews, it seems that this may be necessary. Batter seemed thin so the chips would definitely sink if they are heavy.

Great cake. Very easy to prepare, very moist. No adjustments necessary for high altitude. Whole family didn't like the taste of the Mocha Icing. Will make it again with a different icing.

I have made this twice now. Very moist cake and super easy to make. I used a smaller bundt pan the second time and it came out great. I liked the mini chips bc they added texture. My kids thought they were nuts but maybe bigger chips would be better. The smaller ones did not sink to the bottom of the cake. I laid the cake on a slotted cooling rack and put wax paper underneath before I glazed it. This way I let the first coat of glaze harden a little and then llifted the wax paper (putting another under) and reglazed using the extra. I loved the espresso in the glaze and in the cake. The second time I made it I forgot the cinnamon (my kids were talking to me) and it tastes so much better with it!

A very good cake, and it makes a nice presentation. I don't know what they were thinking with the instruction about a 12-15 cup bundt pan. My standard 10 cup version was more than adequate and the cake had plenty of room. I might cut back on the espresso powder in the glaze, to make it more chocolate and less coffee-flavored, but that's me. I didn't think there was too much glaze. I cooled the cake 10 minutes in the pan, and when I inverted it I gave the pan a thunk; the cake came out with no problem.

I made this last night for the office today. It was super easy and the only thing I had to buy was the chocolate chips - definately needed them - just ask my co-workers! The cake was moist and delicious. I agree there was a bit too much glaze (I didn't use it all) but my cake didn't stick - I greased (with crisco) and floured the pan and it just came right out. I also used regular granulated coffee - didn't have espresso and don't think it needed it. But, what I dislike about the recipe (and all recipes that do this) is the "divided" thing. Give me the ingredients twice or split them out for me - less chance I'll make a mistake.

Very easy and yuuuuummy! Moist and decadent. Not that it really helps much with the calorie content...but I thought that the mini chocolate chips were completely unnecessary and that the amount of mocha icing was a bit excessive as well.

Wonderful recipe! Moist, delicious, will make again and again! The most difficult part to this recipe was finding the espresso powder. Instead I was able to find Medaglia D'Oro Instant Espresso at a grocery store in the coffee isle. Definitely worth the trouble to find! I was a little hesitant on the amount of cinnamon called for so I added 1/2 tsp instead of a whole. After tasting the batter, I felt it was a good amount - and it was! The cake did stick to the pan like the other reviews mentioned. I think I would spray PAM and/or butter/flour the pan next time. I used a 12 cup bundt pan and it was a perfect size. Anything bigger would make the cake too small in my opinion.

Excellent cake. Extremely moist. I didn't have any problems getting the cake out of the pan, but I buttered abd floured it, rather than just oil. My problem was that it was too short. I think my bundt pan was too big. The recipe calls for a 12-15 cup pan. I would definitely go with a smaller pan.

This cake was very moist and yummy with a side of vanilla ice cream. As with another reviewer, my cake also stuck to the pan. I am not sure why because I did liberally oil it. So, it wasn't the best looking but it certainly was great tasting.

A very easy and delicious cake. I used about 1/4 c. natural cocoa and 1/4 c. special dark. The chocolate flavor was great and SO moist. My only issue was getting it out of the pan, as the top didn't quite come with it. I pieced it back together, but had to call it 'swamp cake' due to its ugly appearance. No one cared once they tasted it. I only sprayed the pan- next time will oil it like the directions said.

I love Bundt cakes and after reading this one, I HAD TO make it. It was not only very easy but also incredibly tasty and moist. Will undoubtedly make this again and perhaps try to use 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c buttermilk next time to cut back a little on the oil. This one is a winner.
