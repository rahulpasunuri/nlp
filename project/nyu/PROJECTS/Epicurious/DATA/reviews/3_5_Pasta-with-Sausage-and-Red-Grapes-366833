yum, the grapes and sausage worked well together. I used sweet italian turkey sausage and it was delish. I would modify it by added sauteed spinach with garlic, it gave it some added color and texture which was key.

Very tasty, simple to prepare, light on the stomach and different. I would definitely suggest using fresh basil instead of parsley, it compliments the other flavours beautifully, and I suspect it made all the difference. I also substituted half of the broth with some rosé wine, and instead of whole wheat pasta (yuck! sacrilege!) I used high quality, organic Italian farfelle. Rather than mild Italian sausage, I used hot Italian turkey sausage, it worked well and packed a nice punch. I'll definitely be making this again, it was yummy.

This was easy to make and delicious. I used white onion instead of red and veggie broth instead of chicken (because that's all I had handy). I also used wheat penne pasta. I don't think the parsley makes or breaks the dish. Would definitely make again.

fine, kinda weird, forgettable. like the concept but I agree that tomatoes would have been better as well as some broccoli rabe or a more substantial green vs. parsley. I wouldn't make as written in recipe.

Excellent recipe!! Made this recipe last night. Based on the previews reviews ended up doubling the sauce (stock, onions and grapes) and sausage. Was planning on leftovers but the dish turned out so good, unfortunately there were none. Will definitely make it again very soon.

Flavor was good, but my sauce never "thickened" - it was too thin. Does chicken broth really thicken? Wished the flavors had more complexity and punch, and wished the sauce was more satisfying. Wouldn't make again.

This was delicious! But I ended up doubling the sauce and sausage, and to be able to use a whole box of penne. Not a huge fan of whole wheat pasta, but the flavors made it so worth it.

Made this last night and served with some bread- very delicious! Love the combination of the red grapes with the sausage. I used sweet italian sausage and probably could've added more grapes!

This recipe is a great summer dish. Red grapes are great with the sausage, nice mix of light flavor with the rich sausage without having a heavy cream sauce. I served it with sauteed zucchini on the side.

Made this a couple nights ago... used spicy Italian turkey sausage; otherwise, no changes. It was delicious and leftovers were great the next day, too. My husband and I agreed we should definitely make again. Would serve to guests.

We made this as a last minute dinner and it was thrown together quickly but came out really nice. I might've liked it to be a little saucier but the flavors were great. I really liked using grapes instead of tomato.

I made this last week, mostly because I already had all of the ingredients except the grapes. I was worried that it would be a strange flavor combo, but it turned out excellent. I used chicken Italian sauseage and the flavors went together well. This would also be good with grape tomatoes.
