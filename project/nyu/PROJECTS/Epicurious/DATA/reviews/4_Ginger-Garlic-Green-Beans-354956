This is quite a tasty dish. It's great for the tastebuds but wicked on the breath! I made it exactly the way it's written and will make it again. The picture doesn't do it justice...it's very pretty.

Used some chicken and 9 oz. of stir-fry veggies (broccoli, snap peas, carrot) in place of the green beans. Through the whole mix over some rice. I tried substituting ground ginger for the fresh, and I think I overdid it. Would try this again in the future with some fresh ginger (as much as I hate grating it)!

So easy to whip up and oh, so tasty! Will definitely be making this one again.

These green beans are just terrific...and they're so easy to make. These are definitely something I'll be making again and again.

I left the garlic out since raw garlic = awful breath later. Without the garlic, it tasted like something was missing, so I added sriracha sauce which did the trick and added a kick!

Very good for garlic lover, the taste of raw garlic is strong but mixed with other ingredients it's amazing!

Another fan of these. I bought the steam in a bag green beans, so it was even easier. I served them at dinner with prime rib, and they were a big hit, even among my vegetable-hating family. Nice to be able to serve beans without having to add almonds, as one of my family has nut allergies. I have since gone out and bought more green beans, because this dish is so good, it may become a regular!!

After making this wonderful recipe the first time around, I decided to try this as finger food for Thanksgiving. WOW! Just refridgerate until cold, then serve. They were gone in no time!

I was expecting this to come out rather like plain green beans, and it turned out surprisingly great. The dressing adds so much. This is a great pairing with other Asian foodstuffs.

Yummy & easy - great Asian flavors. I used chili-sesame oil.

Very flavorful, will definitely make this again. Goes well with an Asian entree.

This was awesome. It paired well with asian style pork loin. I added zest from a small orange and it just added a little something extra.

This recipe made us a family of green bean lovers. Unbelievable !

This was very tasty. Be prepared for some asian flavors when making your menu though. I tried this with salmon and it didn't go so well! But otherwise the green beans were very good. The only problem I had was having cold green beans after the ice bath. Maybe I left them in too long (less than a minute), or perhaps they're supposed to be served cold? Regardless they were good and I'll make again.

Great side dish. Fast and easy.

The green beans are basking in the saucy goodness the recipe guided me in creating. So far, so yummy! I'm serving this dish along side Asian barbecue salmon (recipe from Food Network). The pair will be in matrimonial bliss together--that is, until their in my and my husband's tummies.

This is a delicious easy recipe. I put a bowl out on the counter and they disappear. Great for when your garden bean patch is exploding!

Quick and delicious. I'll definitely make it again. I forgot to garnish with sesame seeds before serving and it was perfect anyway.

Terrific, strongly flavored preparation of green beans - my veggie-phobic husband ate them with enjoyment!

Great, easy to meake asian twist on traditional green beans.

In all fairness, it was the "Asian flair" that didn't go over well with my family - the sesame oil. But also they just seemed too oily. Good idea - will probably tweak the flavors but keep the preparation.

Made this recipe with fresh beans from my garden and they were fabulous! They have a wonderful Asian flare and are easy enough to make for a weekday meal. They would be great for a potluck dish since it can be served at room temperature.
