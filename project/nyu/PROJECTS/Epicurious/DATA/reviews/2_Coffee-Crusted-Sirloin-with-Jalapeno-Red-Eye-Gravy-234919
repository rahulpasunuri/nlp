The ground coffee on the steak gives this meal a grainy texture--which just doesn't work. Next time I make this I'm going to eliminate the ground coffee all together (unless I have coffee powder on hand) as an average grind kills this dish. I did make some modifications to the recipe as I didn't have everything on hand. I didn't have jalepeno jelly so I chopped up a habanero and mixed it with marmalade and then added it to the gravy/ It turned out amazing. I think next time I'll make the sauce and just do a simple sear on the steak/ The reviewers here are right--unless you have coffee powder, don't "dredge in coffee mixture," or you'll be pulling grinds out of your teeth for days.

I made this tonight with what I had on hand. I cut the recipe in half, as I was only feeding two. I used one Nespresso pod for the coffee coating and one shot (N)espresso diluted with water for the red-eye gravy. (I used decaf so we wouldn't be up all night.) My jalapeno heat spike in the gravy came from some homemade hot sauce (really just chopped jalapenos and vinegar), not jelly, and I thickened the gravy with flour. It was delicious. The absolute fine texture of the espresso from the pod and its freshness made the coffee coating tasty and not obtrusive or noticeably gritty. I served it with beets (boiled) tossed with chard and balsamic vinegar. My guest raved and so did I. I only give it three forks because I didn't follow the recipe to a T, but modified it to suit my ingredients. Don't be afraid! The coffee-and-beef thing is great on a cold, dark night. Serve red wine and beets and you are all set. I don't know why the other reviewer had such a hard time with this one, but I think the finer grind your coffee, and the more flavorful, the better.

Looking back, I keep thinking I must have done something wrong, because I can't imagine anyone intentionally cooking steaks to come out tasting like this. The coffee coating made the steaks virtually inedible, and the brewed coffee overwhelmed everything else in the gravy.

sylph9, I think you should have used "ground coffee" instead of "coffee grounds." Or you may be pulling our (virtual) legs!

Maybe the problem was the size of the grounds (medium) or maybe the problem was completely coating the steak with grounds, but either way, the delicious flavor of the steak and gravy were seriously obstructed by the coffee grounds. If you love coffee and want to try this recipe, I'd recommend eliminating the coffee ground coating and giving the rest of the recipe a shot.

Wow. If I could have given this recipe 0 forks I would have. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone. It was really not even edible. The Jalapeno Gravy was good, but the coffee on the steak was too much to overcome. STAY AWAY!!! I did make the corn pudding that was from the menu and it was good.

I have never tasted meat as flavorful. I would serve this to any guest with pride. It is not only good it's healthy.
