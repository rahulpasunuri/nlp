Just made this - SUPERB, even for non-game eaters! I made it as recipe suggested except I didn't have allspice so I left it out. I did have an excellent cut of venison (our contractor shot Bambi on our property and gave us the best piece, I think). The marinade was just right, even with a ton of thyme. I was also worried about cooking it only 5-8 minutes in the oven but it came out perfectly cooked - rare, but not undercooked. For the novice venison chef, this recipe is a WINNER.

This was excellent, and I can't wait to make it again! It seemed like a waste to throw out the garlic with the marinade (I love garlic!), so I picked out the pieces and put them in the pan and browned them with the meat, and added them to the roasting pan too. I ended up with delightful garlic cracklings in the pan drippings, which added a nice texture contrast to the smooth and tender venison.

This recipe isn't complete. It calls for 1/2 CUP of savory / thyme leaves, and then doesn't tell you what to do with it. I'm assuming 1/2 cup is incorrect, so I put a bit into the marinade. Also, like many game recipes, the marinade ends up overwhelming the flavor of the meat itself. I tried the recipe and was underwhelmed. If you don't like the flavor of venison so much that you need to overwhelm it with wine and 1/2 CUP(!?) of thyme, then don't shoot the deer / don't buy the overpriced meat.

This was a great recipe. I used a 1 pound loin of venison which a neighbor gave me. Rather than cut into pieces, I heated a flame safe/ovensafte roasting pan in the oven until hot, seared the entire loin and then placed in oven until done. We also thought a pan sauce would be nice so as the meat rested, I browned a little shallot in the hot pan, deglazed with veal stock and enriched with demiglace. We sliced it about 1/2 inch thick and it was a spectacular dish. Served it with wild rice and my own green tomato chutney.

Simple but elegant is a fair summary. The marinade takes the gaminess out of the meat, and provides a good basic flavor. We still added a cranberry sauce as a side though. A nice way to serve venison, though I'm still looking for a real "roast" (as opposed to chunks) recipe.

I followed this recipe while cooking a Thanksgiving eve dinner in New Hampshire for some dear friends and it was fantastic. I served it with a simple red wine/dried cherry sauce and accompanied it with roasted potatoes and sweet & sour cabbage with golden raisins. Soooo good!

This is a simple, but elegant way to cook and serve venison. I am lucky to have wild game in my freezer that is a little gamey. This recipe did away with the gaminess. I served it with a variation of the Huckleberry Mostarda (I didn't have the Mostarda, but came up with a passible alternative). It is definately a keeper!
