I think this is a good recipe -- I have made it twice. I highly recommend sauteeing sausage first. Also, the dish looks much better if you remove the sausage from the casings. The sausage is incorporated into the dish and it is prettier.

I used smoked sausage and added carrots, 2 c chicken broth (3 1/2 c water but accidentally added in maybe 1/3 c more water), cumin, coriander, thyme, garlic. I think it tastes great except it is a little on the watery side. Don't put in more water than called for! :)

A delicious rustic dish perfect for the cold that can be made with humble pantry staples. I used French green lentils. I also cooked chicken sausage first, removed it, & drained out most of the fat before cooking the onions and garlic in the same pot. I also added a touch of tomato paste for depth and a bay leaf. I don't recommend the bay leaf, though. I took it out pretty quickly when I realized how overwhelming its cloying sweetness was in the dish.

This was very quick to make. I made alot of substitutions with things I had on hand. I substituted chunks of carrot versus celery. I added some tomato puree and a spoon of homemade pesto. I removed the casings from the italian sausages I used but left the sausages whole so the flavour could penetrate better and also added some chopped bacon 2 Tbsp at the beginning with the shallots. I also diluted the chicken stock that to cut a bit back on the sodium. Some bay leaves and voila a very flavourful lentil stew on top of a bed of brown/wild rice.

Add spice by using chorizo. Add chopped tomatoes for color and chicken stock for flavor. Add fresh colored cheese tortellini for color and additional mouth appeal. Tastes even better Day 2.

If you make this recipe as it stands, you wind up with an earthy colored slop that says "sustenance" and not much else. Plus, if you follow the recipe and cut the sausage into one- or two-inch lengths, the pieces will all be floating on the top, bulging out of their casings in kind of a gross way. If you do make this recipe, I'd chop up the sausage more and freelance with some ingredients, as suggested by others. Or instead make a good split pea soup, which has brighter, clearer flavors than this.

Rating this only a 2 forker just because a lentil soup can only be so spectacular. Still and all, this is a great, and incredibly easy, lentil soup. I used chicken broth, added a couple of garlic cloves, some cayenne and a bay leaf and only used 4 sausages. I do think hot sausages would make it more interesting. But it is really good, easy, and great on a cold, wet night.

Like many previous users, I made some changes to the recipe - instead of 5 1/2 cups of water, I used 3 1/2 of homemade chicken stock, 2 of water, and I added carrots, cabbage, a few cloves of garlic, and some oregano to the mix. It came out great. It's one of my fiancee's favorite recipes - she's always excited when I say I'm going to cook it.

My only change to the recipe was to use hot Calabrese sausage rather than a mild sausage. The results were excellent. I did do some additional cooking with the lid off at the end to get rid of some excess liquid, but that was based on personal preference rather than necessity. If I were serving this to guests, I would add some diced carrot to improve the look of the dish. It's fairly uniform in colour as-is.

Good recipe to play with. I added some chopped fresh rosemary, sun dried tomato and basil chicken sausage, and a fresh red pepper. Don't be afraid to add more to this stew. It's great!

I made it as directed (okay, I replaced one cup of water with a cup of white wine) despite the comments about it being bland, as I was using Spanish Chorizo which has quite a strong flavour. It was really nice ... yes, I can see it would be bland if you are using a mild sausage, but the recipe works very well as given if you are using something with a strong flavour to go with it.

I made this recipe as directed and got amazing results. The only change I made was to add a large carrot diced fine. I will make this one over and over.

So easy and yummy. Took no time and had lots of leftovers. I used spicy lamb sausages, which made it all the more flavourful.

The base recipe is boring--but if you add veges--it's great and I only used half the sausage called for. What I did add was 2 small red pototatos chopped, 2 carrots sliced, 1 beef bullion cube, 1 diced tomato and an extra 1/2 cup of lentils. It was creamy and totally satisfying!

What a wonderful recipe! I've made this dish several times, and it's amazingly easy. Just put everything in the pot and walk away! Makes great leftovers, too.

The recipe as it stands is fairly bland. It is a good base recipe to get creative with, though. I added a bay leaf, 1/4 c of white wine, a pinch of saffron and replaced the salt with beef bouillion. My husband suggested using hot italian sausage instead of mild for an extra kick next time. For the cooks having consistency problems: I simmered it uncovered for 30-45 minutes instead of covered for an hour and the dish turned out very stew like.

I made it exactly as the recipe called and it came out as soup rather than stew. In fact, I tried cooking it an additional 20 minutes uncovered to let some of the liquid evaporate in the end, but it was still a pot of soup. The flavor, however was DELICIOUS!

It's snowing again , and this was just the ticket ! I added 2 beef bouillon cubes to give it more flavor . This is really fast and simple . Delicious .
