Marvellous combination of flavours. Of course it might not be hot enough for some, so of course you'd add more chili, but the sweet, hot, sharp and spicy mix, is terrific. I make this often and as it's supposed to be summer in the UK just now I am making it again!

excellent dish with an asian meal. Serve with our without shrimp. Peanuts are a must.

This is a delicious summer salad and is probably very versatile. I think it would be great tossed with Soba noodles for a more meal-like salad.

I made this tonight to use up a bunch of cucumbers from my garden and the whole family loved it! I didn't bother to do the salting step, but because we ate it right away I don't think it mattered at all. I made the dressing as directed, but used some diced snap peas instead of the cabbage (because it's what I had on hand) and didn't include shrimp. Great for a summer dinner!

This was a big hit at home. I've made it twice (the second time sans shrimp, my husband isn't a fan), using Thai red chili paste, and will be making it again for a dinner party tonight.

This is a Thai inspired recipe so instead of the chili paste I used red thai curry paste. Which added complexity to the dressing. much better!

Really good salad recipe! I skipped the cucumber step and it turned out fine. Very fresh tasting and light. I am going to double the chili paste next time for a little more kick.

I LOVE this salad and have made it over and over. I have the same question as another did-- do I need to do the cucumber step? I have a BIG dinner coming up and wondering if I can save time.

I followed the recipe exactly and I'm sorry to say that despite the rave reviews we weren't won over by the dressing, which tasted very timid to us. Might try making the dressing again with double amounts of chili paste, fresh ginger and lime peel and perhaps adding some ground toasted (white) sesame seed or a bit of peanut sauce. Loved the combination of all the other ingredients - made a very fresh, crunchy and colorful salad base. Also recommend grilling the shrimp, as another reviewer suggested, for better texture and more authentic feel.

I used regular 2 large regular cucumbers and green leaf lettuce, because that's what I had on hand, and it was super tasty. Fresh and healthy while still flavorful. My fiance has already asked me to make this again next week!

This is a great recipe to use some of the great surplus of cucumbers I have in my summer garden. I have used several different varieties of cucumber, and they all work equally well. We like spicy food, and add just a little more chili paste than is called for, but other than that, the flavors really are very well balanced. This is a great cool light summer supper, and easy to make.

This is an amazing and versatile dressing. I have used it with our without shrimps, with other types of cabbage and so on. It is always a hit.

I have a question, can anyone tell me if the step with the cucumbers is worth it? Does it make a big difference? Thanks! :-)

Reminds me of Thailand. Wonderful flavor combinations.

I adapted this as an entree salad on a very hot day and it was just wonderful! The flavors are clean and so nicely balanced. I left a little sugar out of the dressing and added a touch of sesame oil, since I love that flavor. I used regular sesame seeds since I didn't have black ones. Delightful - can't wait to make it again! Would be a wonderful addition to a summer dinner party!

This is the best, most fresh and healthy salad. At first it seems a little tedious, but very easy and delicious. Double it for sure...you'll want it the next day. Gets a little limp the next day but still delicious. I don't change a thing.

Excellent flavour combination. Fantastic main course salad, or appetizer for a dinner party. I would use 1 Tbsp less sugar next time.
