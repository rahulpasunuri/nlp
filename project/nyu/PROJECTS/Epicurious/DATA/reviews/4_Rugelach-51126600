This recipe is delicious. We made the chocolate hazelnut filling. I made the dough the night before and put it in the fridge. Two things; I would not recommend putting it in foil, use saran wrap instead since foil will break and stick and nobody want to eat tin foil. Also, it was ridiculously hard to roll out. Some people warned (in the other recipes) that if it gets too warm it'll be hard to work with, but also if it is too cold!
