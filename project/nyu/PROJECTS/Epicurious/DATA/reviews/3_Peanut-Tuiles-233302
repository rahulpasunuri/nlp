I thought these would be great with chocolate fondue....supremely disappointed. No depth of flavor and greasy. Would not make again and unsure what do with the ones that I did make! Followed the recipe exactly, it is just not a grat recipe.

I made these last year for the holidays and again this year. The only issue I found with the recipe is that I needed to cook them several minutes longer than the recipe indicated otherwise they weren't crunchy. This year I added a twist. I left them flat, melted some dark and semi-sweet chocolate and made sandwich cookies. They are excellent that way and everyone seems to enjoy them.

Here's the one with the crumbly tuiles again. I had mistakenly doubled the flour. When I did it properly they turned out beautiful and delicious. This time I skipped the salt but didn't miss it because the peanuts were salty enough.

The batter kept crumbling after a while and I could only make a few tuiles because after the 2nd batch it was so crumbly I couldn't assemble a spoonful to get together. The ones that did come out were a bit too thick for my taste.

A great crunchy treat. I made them with cashews & they were a hit at a Holiday cookie exchange. I also made them with hazelnuts and formed them into cups for serving white chocolate mousse, flavored with Frangelico. Presentation was pretty with chocolate "poinsettia" leaves.

Chalked the first tray up to "learning experience." After that, they couldn't be easier. Take your time, cool them for a minute or 2 on the spoon handle. Now that I have a feel for how they work, I'll make them next Christmas as well.

This was an easy enough recipe to make although it didn't come out the way it looks in the pictures. They weren't picture perfect (kinda limp really), but damn ! are they every tasty !!! Here are a few things I will do the next time: really measure out my ingredients more accurately (like the butter and corn syrup, the rest I did exactly), cook them until they look golden-orange in the center and the edges are brown, and wait 2 minutes to cool before I flip them over, and roll them nice and slow around the spoon handle. I will also measure them out exactly a small teaspoon (it's really small I found out). So the point is, be really precise for this recipe for best looking results. I know it pisses people off when others write reviews when they didn't follow exactly the recipe but I did to a degree. I just wanna warn people not to eyeball it when it comes to measurements for this recipe. I also recommend putting only 6 tuiles per cookie sheets to get good results. If you can fit more, great. So, bottomline, these cookies taste really good for something so simple (but I guess it's always the case). But it may need some fine-tuning to get them to look nice.
