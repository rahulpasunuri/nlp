These were soooo yummy! Watch the time for steaming though...if you steam too much, the fried dumplings will turn to mush. I cooked the pork before adding to the dumpling mixture also, to cut down on cooking time.

Made this for a party last sat .... Easy to make... Only thing I thought was pork had no flavor ..... I substituted bottled Goyza / dumpling sauce. With sauce it was good.

Incredibly delicious. Substituted ground chicken for the pork. Made a dipping sauce with rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, fresh grated Ginger, garlic, brown sugar, and red chili paste.

very easy to make and they were pretty good- but not as good as some other reviews have stated... they turned out a little dry on the inside (they were undercooked if anything) I am definitely making these again but maybe i will try adding in some other ingredients- it seems like this recipe is a good base

By far most superior dumpling recipe we have found....so far. It is a serious crowd pleaser and fun to serve on the fly with friends in the kitchen. Make filling ahead of time and then assemble and cook them all together. The dipping sauce is outstanding. We also make the ginger-chili dipping sauce on the site for variety.

This recipe was outstanding. I made them ahead and froze them per the directions.

The dumplings were fantastic but, the sauce was not so great. Thought it was too sour... I ended up using a differnt sauce for the dumplings

This is a stand by hors d'oeurve for me. Can be made ahead and a real crowd pleaser.

I've been making this recipe since 1997. Like one of the prior reviews I usually sub turkey for pork, and sometimes make other small modifications but basically keep it as written. The sauce sounds (and looks) very unusual (and thin) but it's the absolute perfect. accompaniment. Wonderful recipe.

Everybody I have ever made this for has LOVED them. I usually make them with ground turkey to reduce the fat (and because I don't much like pork). Next time I will try them with tofu, just for something different. I skip the sauce listed here and make the Nam Geem Guy Yang recipe from this site - it's a perfect compliment. I have probably made this recipe more than any other in my life - it's that good.

just had to add my raves to all the others. Made over 60 of these for 33 people last night (froze them ahead of time for a week on wax paper on cookie sheets) and would add one tip for cooking large quantities of them: use one large pan for frying and another large pan for steaming. That way you can keep a quantity going in no time! These flew off the platter. Great sauce; offered that with a little hoison, plum, and low-sodium soy sauce.

I'm always looking for great recipes for hors d'oeuvres that can be frozen and then quickly thawed/cooked for drop-in guests, cocktail parties, etc. This is one of my most favorites! Every time I make them guests ask for the recipe and they are all gone. So easy to prepare and freeze then steam quickly, just make the dipping sauce last minute, or you could take the easy way out and just use soy sauce or plum sauce. A keeper!

This was SO good. I left out the red pepper and sealed them as a pot sticker, as some people did. This is the best recipe I have ever gotten from this web site!

The best dumpling recipe I have tried to date. Excellent flavour, with or without the dipping sauce prescribed here. Will make these again and again.

after reading all the chipping and chopping that was required I pulled out the cuisinart only to discover it had died after 18 yrs. of faithful service. No matter. When I have help (my children) in the kitchen nothing seems to be mind-numbingly tedious and these dumplings are so worth the effort. Absolutely superlative!!

I made this as an appetizer for an asian inspired dinner. The only thing I changed was that I left out the bell pepper and I substituted chopped raw shrimp for the pork. They were perfect. I had trouble wrapping them the way that the recipe instructed, so I wrapped them my own way, folding them into a half moon shape and then proceeding with the fry/steam method. I made a different (easier) sauce for them that went perfectly: one part soy sauce, one part rice vinegar, one spoonful sesame oil, and some thinly sliced scallions. they flew off the appetizer platter! note: I had some trouble at first with the dumplings sticking to the plate that I had put them on before cooking. So I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and then it was no problem to take them off the plate for frying without ripping their delicate skins.

This was the second dish of a Thai inspired dinner. Our guests loved it, and so did we. Used a soy-lime dipping sauce instead of the coriander sauce. (You can search it). Dinner started with a shrimp broth with lemon grass, and entras was shrimp in a coconut sauce

I brought these to a super bowl party and they were a big hit. I couldn't find round wonton wrappers so I used square, and just folded them once into a triangle shape. I pan fried them at home, and then popped them into a frying pan with water for 3 minutes to steam them when I got to my friend's house. This worked out well - they were fresh and hot. I can't really rate the sauce as I used a combination of dipping sauce recipes to make my sauce.

This filling was amazing. Got home from the shops and realised I'd bought spring roll wrappers instead of dumpling wrappers. The recipe made good spring rolls though!

Rating: 4
Very, very good. Seved this as a starter for a Thai meal and everyone loved them. I was able to get actual (frozen) dumpling wrappers at the local Asian food store. They are thicker than wonton wrappers and easier to handle.

My boyfriend and I made these tonight and they were great and fun to make. We substituted carrots for the cabbage, which gave them a nice color and sweet flavor that complimented the dipping sauce well. (We also had fun experimenting with different methods of folding.) We would definitely recommend this recipe.

I would love to make this, but I live in a semi-rural area and wonton wrappers are just not available. Some tips as to what could be used instead (someone said filo?) would be greatly appreciated!

Ridiculously tasty. I'd give this 20 forks if I could! I changed the dipping sauce juat a tad by adding about a teaspoon of hoisin sauce for a deeper flavor. Be sure to buy and use shu mai skins from your asian market (freezer section)! Goyza wrappers do not work well!

Yum yum yum!! At first I was concerned that this recipe would too much work - but it was simple and just fabulous! I increased the amount of cilantro and added one well-minced thai bird chili for extra kick. I agree that the sauce benefits from just a splash of soy sauce. Try this recipe tonight!

These dumplings were just awesome. The sauce matched perfectly. I can't get over how good these were!

I used ground chicken instead of pork and added a lot of red pepper. I also used x2 of the sesame oil. This makes a great romantic dinner for two. Sit on the floor around a low table, light some candles and turn on some music - I've made this dish for a few dinners and it is always successful;-) Cathy Thom San Francisco, CA

These aromatic dumplings are refresingly tangy. My husband & I love Thai food, and this dish tastes authentic. They deliver mucho flavor, nice presentation, yet are simple to prepare & serve. I love this appetizer and sometimes serve it as a first course.

This is a great appetizer and a crowd pleaser. I did use other readers recommendations of using rice vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar and also had an additional peanut dipping sauce. Very tasty!

So easy, and so delicious! My grocery store didn't have plain ground pork for some reason, so I got "meat-loaf" meat (a mix of ground pork, beef and veal) and that worked wonderfully. I skipped the sauce and served them with soy sauce spiked with rice vinegar and garnished with green onion and coriander. Yum!

One of my standards for parties--people are disappointed if I don't have them. I make them into potstickers using round wonton wappers, folding over and sealing/crimping. I freeze individually on a baking sheet, then put in ziploc bags. I cook from frozen (they won't stick together this way) Very convenient to have on hand and really quite simple to make, though no one believes me. Try the sauce.

These were a big success. Instead of using won ton wrappers, I used filo pastry and baked them in the oven for 12 minutes at 190C. Probably gives a slightly different result - but lovely nonetheless. I also used minced chicken. Mmmm.

Not as difficult to make as it looks and actually kind of fun. Well worth the effort. Served with Spicy Peanut Sauce recipe found on epicurious.com (April 1996 Gourmet) which I enjoyed much more than the prescribed Coriander Dipping Sauce which I found very minty. Will try again and maybe go half on the mint. Also used ground coriander vs fresh which made no difference in the dumpling mixture, but might have in the sauce. Also recommend frying in the oil for at least 2 - 3 minutes and steaming for at least 4 for best results.

Very nice as hours d'oeuvres, and not as difficult as your guests will think! I was in a hurry and couldn't get to the Farmers' Market, so I had to rely on my lame neighborhood Kroger, which had neither fish sauce nor fresh coriander. So, I substituted bottled Oyster sauce for the Fish Sauce and used ground coriander, and it was wonderful. I even doubled the quantity of Oyster sauce in the sauce recipe, and it mellowed the ginger. (I had made the sauce ahead of time, and the ginger really became too prominent after marinating.) All in all, it was really a yummy dish, and I will make it over and over again.

My first Four Star rating!!! Like gold in the freezer! Was going to make a batch, cook half for dinner and freeze the rest, but my husband and I ate the whole batch within two days! Coupled with the Herb Salad Spring Rolls w/Spicy Peanut Sauce (see review there), which can also be made in advance, it made for a nice Sunday dinner that took all but 10 min to put on the plate, since all the prep was done the day before or that morning. Will try to keep a constant supply in the freezer.

this dish is simply the best, maybe a little time consuming but worth it. it's best to make this on the weekend, cause then they can be frozen and makes for a quick meal in a hurry. I don't eat pork so I used ground chicken instead and it works very well. The sauce is absolutely wonderful

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC! I made the filling one night and finished the dumplings and served them the next night. It was a lot of fun and easier than I thought. They keep well in a warm oven for 20 - 30 minutes (covered). I substituted scallops for pork and it worked well. Also - the sauce is amazing! I added just a bit of soy sauce. This recipe will be made again and again.....

This is one of my favorite recipes, and it freezes well. (Freeze on a plate for about 30 minutes and transfer to a ziplock bag. I cook it a little longer than the recipe indicates, because I'm a little paranoid about the pork being done, and sometimes I change the ingredients a little depending on what I have on hand. Mild pork sausage works well if you don't have plain ground pork. This is especially good with green tea!

I agree with the previous reviewer, very good, time consuming, but still worth it! I added soy sauce to the dipping sauce, it seemed to need it. This was delicious!!
