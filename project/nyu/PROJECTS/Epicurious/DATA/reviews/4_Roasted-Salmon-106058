This is the go-to approach when you don't have a grill and you have fantastic fresh wild salmon that shines on its own and does not need a sauce or other extras. When you have the right ingredient, don't mess with it!

My family loves this recipe. Simple but that's how they like it! And soooo easy.

Yesterday afternoon, I discovered some fresh Copper River salmon at Costco which I had never before found in the store. After googling information about the salmon, I learned that the season began last Thursday, May 17th. This is the perfect recipe for the unbelievably fabulous salmon because the essence of the salmon shines. I am still remembering the flavors from my dinner last night. My salmon was a bit over one pound, and I baked it whole to 145 degrees. I used fresh chives and chopped rosmary from my garden........no tarragon. I also put the herbs and 1/4 teaspoon salt on the fish before baking, and it was wonderful.

Great fresh salmon. Used chives, sage, and basil.

I made this even simpler. Mix the olive oil with garlic, herbes de provence and red pepper flakes. Rub over the fish, then bake, skin side down as the original recipe instructions. It needs no additional oil after roasting.

I think that this is a great basic recipe. I substituted sesame oil for the olive oil and grated fresh ginger over the fish before serving. (omitting the chives and tarragon)

Just made it. Very easy, though I think the tarragon is a bit overpowering (I didn't put much on and it still wasn't that great). The chives are a good subtle aftertaste, but I think next time I'll try something instead of the tarragon. Quick meal.

This turned out awesome! I was really surprised. The only thing I changed was I used rosemary & chives instead of tarragon b/c I didn't have any. Also used a 9 oz. fillet, so I cooked it for 20 minutes on top of sliced onion and didn't drizzle afterward. It came out PERFECT... moist and tasted delicious.

The fourth fork is for the ease of this recipe. Absolutely delicious, really lets the salmon shine (important to get good fish!). I love fresh tarragon. I served over wilted spinach with lemon wedges. Yum!

I really didn't have high hopes for this recipe, but it's surprisingly flavorful. Just make sure you don't overcook the fish.

I've lost track of the number of times we've made this. Probably 50% of the time we have salmon, and we have salmon a lot. Only used the chives and tarragon once - usually lose the chives and use whatever fresh herb we have. Dill, tarragon, and sage are particularly nice. We usually don't drizzle on the extra oil. Super fast, super tasty. And with the tinfoil, the easiest clean up ever.

Excellent, easy recipe. I have always been intimidated by the idea of making salmon -- Afraid I would over-cook it and ruin an expensive piece of fish, but this recipe turns out a tasty, beautiful, perfectly cooked meal. I served this w/ mashed potatoes and green beans for a simple, but elegant, dinner. I LOVE Epicurious.com!

It's really a 2 1/2 forker...the fish was very moist but didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked. That having been said I would make it again as it was so easy...I think I would add some scallions during the roasting process to add some flavor the next time.

I have made this recipe several times for us and for friends, and it has received rave reviews each time! It is so easy and so delicious. I have substituted rosemary for the tarragon and it is absolutely delectable.

Used a 2.5 pound piece of salmon for dinner party for 4 people following recipe. Cooked about 25-30 minutes. Absolutely delicious! Very little left over --still good next day.

Fresh rosemary is good on the salmon too.

Superb!! This is one of the most delicious and yet simplest recipes I've ever made. I used the fresh chives, but substitued dried tarragon. I also decided to pull the salmon out about 10 minutes into the cooking, spinkled the herbs on the fish and then popped back in the oven for another 5 minutes. It turned out absolutely wonderful!! Served with jasmine rice and simple salad.

So easy and so good. Try other herbs instead of the chives. Capers also taste great on the salmon. I like it with saffron rice and a simple vegetable.

I found this recipe looking for something quick and easy and it was. I didn't have tarragon so I substituted dill. I also spread some minced garlic on my fillet with the olive oil before roasting. My family thought it was yummy! I served with wild rice, broccoli spears with hollindase sauce. Lemon wedges would have been a good accompaniment if I'd had some on hand. They always lend that extra "zing" to seafood.

Delicious and simple! I rubbed the salmon with the olive oil and grilled it on the BBQ instead of using the oven. The mild flavor of the chives and tarragon really go well with salmon. I've been eating salmon all of my life and wish I'd found this recipe sooner!! YUM

Tried this a few weeks ago, and it's now our standard salmon recipe. We've used fresh rosemary (haven't tried chives yet) with delicious results.

I thought that this salmon dish was pretty good but not the best that I've had. Due to the sheer ease and quickness of it, I'm sure I'll make it again. I might play with it all more, though.

I just served a 3-lb version of this for 9 guests last night and it got RAVE reviews. I couldn't believe how easy it was. I roasted the salmon for 25 min and it came out unbelievably tender and delicious. It was almost too easy.

I have prepared this salmon many times now. Since I usually cook for more than one I use a fillet and increase the cooking time (about 15-20 minutes total time)and it always comes out moist and flavorful. Once when I had no fresh tarragon I used a paste of garlic, rosemary, salt and olive oil (stolen from a chicken roast recipe) and it was too marvelous for words. Served it on a bed of wild rice and orzo salad with balsamic and grilled vegetables and a side of roasted asparagus. Stunning flavors-lovely dinner.

This recipe is so easy and wonderful. As a young busy professional, entertaining at home is rare. Recipes must be quick and simple; this one tastes great as well. Made this for a small dinner party and folks just raved about it - they ate the skin and all. One friend said it was the best salmon she ever had - and she eats out every night! Highly recommend to people new to cooking fish.

I have used this recipe for salmon several times - I love it's simplicity! But I have a problem with the white fat of the salmon rising to the surface which makes the salmon kind of overwhelming. My fishmonger suggested skimming the white stuff off with a knife before serving. Does anyone have any other advice?

this recipe was great! its especially good if you put a sauce i call "cucumber sauce"(sour cream and mayo and cucumber-amounts to taste- mixed together)on it and im going to try the herbs in it next.

One bite - and my company was raving! My friend, who is a gourmet cook, hummed and yummed throughout the meal! She wished there was more but I had given the big piece to my husband. She definately will make this at her house soon. I hope it's when I'm there. Could not believe that something so easy could be so good!

This is delicious and easy, but my favorite salmon recipes are in the cookbook Colorado Collage, the Herb Crusted Salmon on page 205, or, better yet, the Barbequed Roasted Salmon on cookinglight.com, which is to die for.

This recipe is simple, fast and easy. The results are delicious and elegant. I didn't realize that fresh tarragon has such a delicate, anise like taste. I've alwas found it sort of a musty tasting herb but perhaps it's because I never used it like this, just chopped and sprinkled over fish. It's wonderful.

Proving once again, everything can be made better with fresh herbs. (Grow your own- chives are a perenial, and can be grown from seed.) Served this with the Mushroom Orzo that was mentioned by another reviewer... good.

Great recipie! I didn't have chives or tarragon so I substitued cilantro and it was still fabulous! My fillets had no skin either and all was good. easy and delicious.

I made this dish for a dinner party I was having. At first one of the guests declined to have any because he doesn't like fish. Then he agreed to eat one bite. Then he polished off the plate! It's a great EASY recipe that works well with a variety of sides. :)

What more can I say than SIMPLE AND DELICIOUS!! This recipe is so good that we have it almost once a week. I usually cut the amount of tarragon in half in order to keep from overpowering the flavor of the salmon.

Sometimes,a simple recipe that doesn't sound that outstanding,IS!!! I chose this because of the little bit of time I had to spend on the lemon risotto,(also on this site). What a delicious discovery! Both of the recipes were outstanding!!!

My husband ranted and raved about this recipe! The simplicity is amazing, ingredients always on hand, and it is so fast to prepare! I did not need to add oil at the end, and I used dried tarragon. Also, I prefer my salmon better cooked, about 16-18 min. rather than 12. This was company-worthy. I served it with the mushroom orzo from the Salmon with Mushroom Orzo recipe, also on this site.

I found this to be quite subtle. Not bad, but not overly exciting either. Just seemed to be missing something that would give it some completion. I made it because I was in a hurry and didn't have time to make a sauce. I would only make it again under similar circumstances.

I had never made salmon before (I'm new to cooking), but it turned out woderfully. I used dried tarragon instead of fresh just sprinkling a little over the fish and I did have olive oil on the side for drizzling and it added a little flavor. Great recipe.

I used this recipe with Arctic Char - like salmon but milder - It was amazing - so fast - so simple - and so good. I did not need the last addition of oil either.

Remove the skin? Discard the skin? Ack! That's the best part! Try this instead, heat the oven to 425. Heat an ovenproof pan on high until it's smoking hot, sprinkle in some kosher salt, and lay the fillet skin-side down in the pan. Put it in the oven for 10-15 minutes until it's done to your liking. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with fresh herbs. The skin will be brown, crispy and delicious and the salmon moist.

I prepared this using a lemon flavored olive oil with the salt and pepper for 2/3 of the oven tme then topped with the onion and tarragon. I was very happy with the end result. Like the others, I did not add the extra oil after roasting. This was fast and easy with excellent flavor.

Rating: 3
This was surprisingly good for such a simple recipe. I took the skin off first, after I put it in the broiler for a minute and then the oil and salt and pepper and roasted according to the recipe. I then used the chives and lemon juice instead of additional oil. Will definitely make again. Couldn't get any easier than this and it was perfect.

This recipe is an excellent choice when the cook is called upon to prepare dinner at the last minute. Properly done, the fish is succulent and delicately flavoured. Both my family and my guests are invariably pleased with its simplicity.

This dish was quite delicious and easy. I've also used catfish fillets instead of the salmon, and/or squeezed some fresh lemon juice over the top. Really, any herbs/seasonings will work on the fish that you use. The beauty of the dish is its simplicity, so let's hope that no one holds that against it.

I omitted the tarragon and used green onion tops instead of chives, and put them on the salmon before roasting, and the flavor was great. I didn't use any more oil after cooking - the fish was moist enough on its own. Very quick, easy, looked great with the pink & green - definitely a keeper. Served it with steamed broccoli and mango couscous on the side.
