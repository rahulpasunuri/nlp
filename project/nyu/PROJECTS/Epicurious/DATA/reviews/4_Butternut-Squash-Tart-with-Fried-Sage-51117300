Is there any reason why I can't just partially cook the squash before putting it on the tart and eliminate the whole cookie sheet on top part? Just wondering if anyone has tried that. Also, any advice about making it in advance?

This is an exceptional recipe. Easy to prepare and so good! We had it at our 2013 Oscar Party and it was a hit!

Loved this dish. Did not change anything in the recipe.

I gave this only a 3fork because I feel the recipe needs adjusting. The squash takes 20 min. to bake with pan on top or crust doesn't get done. Also used much less oil brushed on squash and more squash. Be sure to pat as much oil out of the sage as possible. Otherwise delicious and a beautiful presentation.

So easy to make. The only thing I'd do different is slice the squash a little thinner or even thin slices that over lap.

Took this to a holiday potluck buffet. No leftovers! The only thing I'd change is to cut the squash slices a tad thinner and very slightly overlap them since they shrink while cooking. Or if you're going to make this as a finger food, arrange the slices so that you can cut in between the rows (I cut the square of pastry into 16 pieces). You can easily omit the peppery honey drizzle to make it more finger-friendly for a buffet. Flavors were outstanding. the hubby & I liked it so much I made a second one for us at home.

I've made this 4 times already and each time it was as delicious as the time before. Super easy to make and very elegant. I substituted the jalapeno pepper in the sauce with red pepper flakes and it worked fine. Made this for my college student over the holidays and he loved it so much he's making it for his friends this weekend.

We tried this tonight and loved it. It is truly a lovely dish - and the sweet/hot honey drizzle makes the dish. As other reviewers have said, make sure the squash is sliced to 1/8inch. My husband said "this won't be enough for 8 people -- they will want more". I would have all ingredients ready ahead of time and just pull together when time to bake. LOVE IT.

I have made this as an appetizer twice. Everyone loves it. We have a big kitchen, so it is so fun to bring it out of the oven, cut, drizzle, sprinkle and dive in. I love frying the sage leaves. They are so pretty and everyone is "amazed"... and they are so easy to do!! I use a serrano pepper as I want the heat. Which magically disapates as you eat the slice! This recipe is a show stopper for taste and visual pleasures.

This took slightly longer than I was expecting but was fantastic! The spice with the sweet honey and savory squash was a great combination. I did steam the squash a little longer than the recipe called for to make sure it was fully cooked. And for the fried sage, my husband taught me a new trick....frying in the microwave between layers of plastic wrap. Just google "microwave fried sage" and you'll find the technique. Came out much better than frying in the pan. Enjoy!

I have received serveral requests for the recipe. This is a winner. Easy too. My notes: I did not add water to egg wash. I probably used more than 12 slices of squash. You can overlap a little if you slice a little thinner on one side. Make sure you cut no more than 1/8" thick. I cooked for 15 minutes with baking pan on top. I cooked more than 25-30 minutes with baking pan removed. I stopped baking when the crust was golden brown. Pan on bottom shelf of my oven worked fine. I did not fry sage, I put coarsely chopped fresh sage (more than 12 leaves. 20?) on the top and put under broiler until sage looked crumbled (less than a minute?). Took out of oven, drizzled honey mixture (I used Jalapeno pepper without seeds, could have been hotter), and sprinkled 1/4-1/2 cup of shaved parmesan on top. I did not grind pepper.

This was a homerun. My changes: (1) I sprayed foil and placed it over the tart for the first 10 minutes of cooking; (2) chopped up pickled jalapenos b/c that's all I had for the honey mixture; (3) served it as the main dish w/ a salad side as someone below suggested. My husband and vegetarian daughter loved it.

Made this for a fall themed Teachers treats lunch. They gobbled up everything but this,half was still left. Reheated it with some apple sage pork chops for our dinner and saw their point. Flavors didn't blend well,all in all, it was lackluster. Has to be a better use for quality ingredients.

This tart was wonderful. I baked it with the second sheet pan on top for 15 min. instead of 10 and it was not soggy at all. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. My husband and teenage son both loved it too.

This was great! I did not add water to the beaten egg - doesn't need it.

Did I miss the nutritional info on this recipe or was it not posted? Also, is there a way to translate into realistic portions, the number of "servings" claimed in a recipe? It seems the number of servings claimed in posted recipes are a joke (as compared to what we actually serve- i.e. a cooking spoon size portion of each entree). Many thanks for your suggestions. - Helpless Mr. Mom, aka Heavenonafork.

soggy mess. The puff pastry never firmed up under the squash, which made it impossible to be finger food. The squash dominated the flavor, the sage and parmesan were lost. Also the color of the cooked squash was more pumpkin pie than in the picture.

Beautiful, elegant and delicious! Took it to a Fall Harvest Party and it got rave reviews. Only 2 small edits, after I fried my sage it tasted strangely chemical and bitter so I opted to stir some dried sage into the hot honey jalapeno mixture and let it steep. This turned out beautifully, still got that hint of sage on the tart. The other change after adding the the parm and honey to the tart I popped it all back into the now cooling oven to stay warm, the parm didn't melt, but just softened enough to meld to the squash. I would recommend.

This was a huge hit at a recent dinner party. I'm not a chef and even I thought this was easy to make. Thumbs up!

excellent. A hit everytime we serve it. I agree that extra sage is a must.

I brought this as my appetizer contribution to our Canadian Thanksgiving. I made the tart ahead of time, then reheated it at serving time, and topped it with the spice honey,fried sage and parmesan. Good thing I made two tarts - it went quickly and received rave reviews. Will definitely make this again.

A lovely dish, I would only comment that I used a lot more sage, a beautiful raw honey and topped the squash with truffle oil. I used the tart as a first course and it was a hit with my friends.
