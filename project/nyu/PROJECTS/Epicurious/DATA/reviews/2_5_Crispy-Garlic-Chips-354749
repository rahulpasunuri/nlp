Garlic Chips are my new favorite. Delicious with... well pretty much anything, but esp NY or Ribeye steak and crispy rosemary! The trick is to heat the oil and the garlic slices at the same time over med to med hi (depending on your stove) to avoid the burn and bitter. Great with chicken too.

Since this recipe called for garlic cloves "as large as possible", I bought the biggest elephant garlic I have ever seen. This is my first trial of this recipe and I have to say I find the chips bitter. It might be that I went overboard with the garlic size and I will try this again. But, for the first trial, I am a bit disappointed.
