I wasn't impressed by this dish. The shrimp were too large, so I cut them in half. The dill was a bit overpowering. I used non-fat mayo and used regular pickles, fresh out of gherkins that day. Put on a bed of bagged lettuce.

Yummy. Made with light mayo to save more calories and it was still delicious. I also didn't add all the dressing.

I leave out the cornichons and judge the mayo amount by eye. The lemon juice makes it light & zingy. I just add fresh chives and let the simple clean tastes shine through!

I thought this was way too much mayo.

Quite disappointing, too bland.

Delicious! I've never found the cornichons, but it's a lovely meal without them.

Great summer shrimp salad recipe. Cool, tasty and well worth making again, and again.
