Ugh!! It wasn't the appearance that bothered me; it was the taste. I was looking for a way to use some pea-shoots I had bought. It was very disappointing and I like almost all pasta.

one of the uglier looking things i have cooked. you might think of grating some carrots over it to add some color! a lot of sauce for a little pasta.

Pretty good. I didn't use the lemon juice, but used more garlic,and seasoning.
