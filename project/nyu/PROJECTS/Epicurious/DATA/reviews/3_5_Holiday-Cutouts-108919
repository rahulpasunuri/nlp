My new go-to Christmas cookie. Delicious, dough simple to make, easy to work with. After reading reviews at butter cookie recipe link (almost 70 reviews there; only a few here), I increased butter to one full cup, added 1T brown sugar, and used 1.5 t vanilla. Fabulous. Roll dough out on floured surface under floured wax paper for best results. I cut out some cookies and made balls rolled in chopped hazel nuts of others (also someone else's review recommendation). All great. Used a different icing (remarkably, didn't have any reconstituted egg whites 'round the house); find it at http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Christmas-Cutouts-with-Vanilla-Icing-108973 I cut the recipe in half--next time will cut sugar back further (too much for me, and I'm the person who eats the frosting off everybody's cake at your wedding reception). Took cookies to work, gone in no time. But maybe that's not saying much--who turns down snacks at work?

Perfect cutout cookie recipe. Great flavor and texture. Easy to roll and move to cookie sheet. Rolling a little on the thick side gives cookie just the right firm to soft ratio. This recipe is my new standard. Followed directions exactly.

In added nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves and it's yummy.

The texture and flavor of these cookies were perfect. I took them to work and they were gone within the hour. Watch them carefully to make sure they don't overbake though, and roll them out no less than a fourth of an inch. I didn't do the gourmet's frosting--I don't have powdered eggwhites in my cupboard, so I used vanilla cream frosting instead and that worked great.
