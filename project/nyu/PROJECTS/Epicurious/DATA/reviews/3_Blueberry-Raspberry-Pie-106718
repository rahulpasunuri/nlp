The cornstarch flavor/texture was a bit much, and still lots of liquid. Better results were had by decreasing cornstarch 2 tbsp, then adding 1/4 c of instant tapioca ground to a powder.

I have made this several times and everyone always complements on it.

Altered recipe slightly by adding more raspberries than called for and also by first layering all blueberries on bottom, then raspberries as top layer. Guests said they tasted a distinction btwn two berries. Big hit.

I agree that the berry combination ended up tasting (and looking) just like blueberries. Tasted fine but wasn't memorable.

This pie tasted fine, but not spectacular. Blueberries and raspberries together taste like blueberries. I made it for the Fourth of July, for the colors, but the blue got a little overpowering.
