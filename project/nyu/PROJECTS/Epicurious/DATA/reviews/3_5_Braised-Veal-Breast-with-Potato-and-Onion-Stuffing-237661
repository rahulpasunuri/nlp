We have used this recipe many times - - always (almost!) as written. As one reviewer suggested -- really take the time to brown it well, then add enough wine and stock to match your pan. It's a fabulous entertaining dish after a winter day outdoors. Today, we used the modified stuffing recipe by ellyn. Way easier to stuff! Cuts prep time by about 20 minutes. Tastes very fresh! At $1.69 per pound (then onion soup made from the bones and extra drippings) this is real country french cooking! (read economical!) Talk to your butcher about veal breast -- and cook low and slow to "melt" the fat so you can skim it off. I don't time the period the roast is braising in the oven -- we go and play in the snow -- so mine probably is in the oven closer to 3 hours.

I grate 3-4 fresh potatoes, one medium onion, one egg, 1/4 C flour, salt and pepper (as for potato pancakes) and stuff with that. Use a large needle and heavy thread to close opening (or use some skewers). Delicious!

if you don't know how to buy this cut of meat, don't attempt! This was very fatty. Beautiful presentation, potato and gravy were delicious but the fatty meat was very unappealing.

Breast of veal is very inexpensive, but SO tasty. I've made this twice for company and everyone loved it, children included. It is elegant and delicious.

I've made this three times. And, it gets better and better. It's a little time consumming but is well worth the effort. Plus, veal breast is a very inexpensive and flavorful meat. Be sure to sear the meat well. It makes all the difference in the final presentation
