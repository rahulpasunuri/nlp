I thought this tastes great; the combination of flavors and textures worked well. I did however substitute 1/4 cup of mini expresso chocolate chips for the nuts in the blondies. I would make this again!

Found this recipe under the 'meatless' category, but marshmallows contain gelatin, which is animal-derived. Would have loved a marshmallow alternative!

My family and dinner guests liked this dessert a lot. (In fact, my daughter has requested that it replace her birthday cake this year.) I did simplify the recipe by using a purchased good quality chocolate sauce and also by putting the marshmallows on a cookie sheet under the broiler, with satifactory results. I substituted pecans for the walnuts, as well.

To much work for the results. Nothing to write home about, even my kids were not impressed.
