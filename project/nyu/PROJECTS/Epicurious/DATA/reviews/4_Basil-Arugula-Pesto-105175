delicious! we made this pretty much according to the recipe, but with Parmesan and walnuts and extra lemon zest. we mixed it with gnocchi and served it over a bed of fresh arugula and topped with toasted walnuts. mmmmm

I thought this was just ok. I have made much better pesto. I was sorry that I didn't like this more because I really like arugula and had high hopes.

We love this recipe!! An all-basil pesto can sometimes taste a tad bit too strong. The lemon zest and arugula create a more refined flavor. Even people who claim they don't like arugula loved this.

Exceptional just as it is written..

I've made this recipe many times over the last few summers, and it's really given me the confidence to experiment with my pesto. I think as long as you have four cups of arugula/herbs, this recipe works. I've made it with three cups of arugula and one cup of basil, and it was delicious. My herb garden is growing out of control this summer, so tonight I used two cups of arugula and two cups of mixed herbs -- basil, basil fino, greek oregano, and thyme. Delicious!

This pesto was simple and great. I eyeballed all of the ingredients until it was the consistency that I wanted. I added this to fettuccine so I skipped the lukewarm water and added some pasta water to thin out the sauce and help it adhere to the pasta. Served with broiled salmon and asparagus. This turned out great!

Fabulously simple. And, as others mentioned, it freezes well.

Great dish for a buffet or to take to a pot-luck! The arugula adds a bit of snap.... Definitely a keeper!

I used this with freshly cut herbs over a homemade linguini and it was excellent. Adding a little bit of extra lemon peel gives it a zesty kick.

This was a great variation from the traditional basil pesto! I added extra garlic and it was fantastic. I served it over baked halibut with a side of angelhair...very yummy!

One of the best pestos I've ever had, and it can be prepared in a matter of minutes! A little goes a long way, and since my basil crop was abundant this year, I made a double recipe so that I could freeze some for later use during the winter. I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe!
