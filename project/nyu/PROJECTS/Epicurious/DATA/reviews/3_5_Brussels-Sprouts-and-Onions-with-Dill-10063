i always wonder when something gets a great rating what I did wrong, but I followed this recipe exactly and didn't find anything great about it. The cook time was way under. I found it only good with some very browned parts on the brussels. Too much sugar. I didn't taste the dill at all.

Fantastic! I used veggie stock and added some parmesan, although it was just as tasty without it! Great quick dinner.

I LOVE this recipe. I have been making it since 1995 and always get requests for seconds - even from people who don't like brussels sprouts. I have to say, I *love* these IDIOTS who give the recipe a 1-star rating when they HATE brussels sprouts - you're supposed to be rating the recipe, not whether you like brussels sprouts! If you hate brussels sprouts, why are you making this recipe? GO AWAY!

So yummy and healthy . . . I can definitely see using this simple preparation with a lot of different herbs. (I first made this recipe as written on Valentine's Day, 2004. I made it again last night 4/3/04, but with thyme instead of the dill--it was good, but I definitely like the dill better with the brussel sprouts).

My husband and I must both just be brussel sprout haters--neither of us liked this at all and I definitely would not make it again. Too much of a bitter aftertaste...Served with the almond-crusted salmon with leek-cream sauce, though, which was excellent.

Normally I dislike Brussel sprouts, and I only make them at Thanksgiving for my parents. BUT this recipe was GREAT! I only made a limited amount, but should have made more. I even had seconds! We used butter instad of oil, shallots instead of onions, and packaged dill instead of fresh, (with an "extra" pinch). This was cooked "al dente" and I will definitely make this again SOON!

I loved this recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving and my sister loved it so much she made it for Xmas. We used chicken stock instead of water to cook the veggies in. My sister plunged the pearl onions briefly into boiling water to get the skins off and she said it worked nicely. I found skinning the onions to be the hardest part of the job. The b. sprouts will hold up well in a covered pan if you need to get the other dishes ready for serving. We cooked them briefly and let them sit in the pan while we made the gravy and got the other dishes out of the oven, etc. I used about 1/3 of the oil called for and it worked out well.

My husband loves brussel sprouts, but we were bored with just boiling them. I loved onions, so this was a great match. I will definitely make again many times.

Makes Brussel sprouts edible again. The addition of sugar is key, methinks.
