These were a joy to make and even better to eat. I used a mix of 2 cups AP flour and 1 cup barley flour. Plus I added about a cup of toasted, chopped pecans. Even with the inclusion of whole grain these scones are extremely light. They just melt in your mouth. My only advice, make the glaze a little too thick to drizzle on. I when the drizzle route and the glaze took forever to set up.

I've made these scones many times & always receive rave reviews. I add pecans but otherwise follow the recipe exactly as written. Since the glaze makes quite a bit, I always make two batches. I also cut each 8 inch round into 12 pieces rather than 8 pieces and the size is still generous. As soon as the scones cool and the glaze sets up, I wrap in plastic wrap and freeze. When you're ready to eat them, thaw and warm in the oven and they taste like they're freshly made. Delicious!

i absolutely LOVE this recipe! i just made these tonight for the second time, following directions precisely. the first time i made the scones i mixed the ingredients by hand using a pastry cutter. i needed to add 1 1/2 T cream to get the mixture wet enough. this time i made two changes: (1) i put everything in the food processor (which is how i make my pastry crust for pies). it was much faster and i did not need to add the extra cream; the dough was perfect! (2) i divided the dough into four discs and cut each into four pieces, totaling 16 scones. this size scone is much more reasonable, as i believed the others to be ridiculously large. i baked the scones on an insulated baking sheet in the middle of my oven for 13 minutes at 375F. perfect! i do enjoy the icing on the thicker side and i agree with the others, i seem to have a bit of icing left over.

easy, quick, and delish. wonderful traditional scone texture, and the glaze worked well - I made it a bit thicker than it sounds like some others had it (I didn't actually measure out the powdered sugar, just added enough for a good, thick consistency). Cut it into 12 (which might still be a little big), and used a brush to spread a thick helping of glaze on top and sides. Was wonderful with Devon Cream. I might add a bit more maple syrup to the glaze next time, since, as others noted, the maple flavour is relatively subtle, and, living in Canada, we like our maple... The scones got 7/8 thumbs up (max 2 thumbs per person). Will certainly make again.

Very nice scones. I followed the directions exactly with delicious results. I will make these again with the addition of toasted pecans or walnuts. I also would like more maple flavor in the glaze, or maybe just more of a brown sugar flavor. The amount of glaze worked nicely when poured over the top. Quite a bit drains to the pan beneath, but the overall effect is beautiful and tasty!

Very good! I swapped 1 C whole wheat flour for 1 C AP flour to add some texture and flavor. I also accidentally put all 4 T of brown sugar in the dough (omitted from glaze), and they turned out wonderfully. The maple flavor is subtle, but quite delicious.

My husband and I made these tonight while trying out new recipes for an upcoming tea I am hosting. We were both very pleased with the flavor of the scones as well as their texture. The recipe *does* yield alot of dough for only 8 scones, so I divided it into mini scones with approximately three dozen scones (2x3 in triangle sized). I baked them at 375 for approximately 12 mins and they turned out fantastic. While the glaze did seem like a very large amount for only 8 scones, it worked out perfectly with all my mini scones. All in all, this is a very delicious maple scone recipe that we will definitely serve at our party this spring.

The texture is odd - even baked through, it was dense and doughy like uncooked cookie dough. Maple flavor was not pronounced. I used milk in place of cream and added toasted chopped pecans. The nuts is a must to give the scones another dimension. I'll try the other recipe for maple-pecan scone next time.

These scones were amazing!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. I only used about 1/3 of the glaze because more would have been entirely too rich! DELICIOUS!!!

An absolutely delicious scone! The texture was great - resembled a rich biscuit. I would have preferred a touch more maple flavor. Next time I'll add a bit of maple extract.

I've never made scones before, so maybe I made them too flat... I ended up with 20 scones, but mouthwatering nontheless. My father absolutely loves them. I added a little lime juice left over from dinner to the glaze. Offset the sweetness nicely

I've been making these scones for a few years now. I generally make them once a month just because I love them so much. The last time I made them, after the glaze set, I put 6 of them into a ziplock bag and put them in the freezer. They froze beautifully. Leave them out on the counter for about 30-45 min and they are ready to go. I've also microwaved them for about 20 seconds. Still good, but the glaze gets a bit messy. This is truly one of my favorite recipes.

Rating: 4
These are the best! I have been making them a few years, with a few modifications to make them healthier. I use whole wheat pastry flour in place of the white flour and add a cup of oats, substitute vanilla soy milk for the cream, and only use 1 stick of butter. I also make only about half of the icing it calls for. In addition, I make 2 rounds and cut each into 8 pieces, which helps those of us with smaller appetites. I make the dough in the food processor with the steel blade in less than 5 minutes. They are easy and delicious, and my family always smiles when I make them!

Unbelievably delicious and rich, these scones reminded me of a Tim Horton's maple glazed doughnut---but way better. Mine were cakey, not flakey. I, too, added maple extract to the glaze, and about 1/4 c. more flour because the dough was too wet to knead. In the end, I found it easier to just drop the scones and smooth them out by hand. I couldn't believe how beautiful they were when I pulled the baking sheet out of the oven. Oh, and I'm glad I halved the glaze because it was more than enough for my 14 scones. Definitely the best tasting, best looking scone I've ever made.

Scones disappeared before I could try one, but my family says make 'em again; they were awesome.

To the cook from San Mateo: I'm a huge fan of scones of all kinds and I've learned that there are two very distict types of scones out there. As you pointed out these scones have a shortbread-like taste and texture. This type is actually the authentic scone, as originally created in England (the "tea scone" in the title is a big hint about this). I have several friends who think that it's absolute blasphemy what Americans call scones. As the cook from San Mateo noticed, a big difference between the two types is the addition of eggs, something the Brits would never do. I think many American bakeries choose the version with eggs because they keep better, the traditional scones are best hot from the oven. With all that said, I'm a big fan of both types, but I was prepared for what I got and I liked them quite a bit.

These are my favorite breakfast scone. I make them for guests oftenand always get rave reviews. They are not a typical dry scone at all - very moist. I do sometimes add more powdered sugar to the glaze to thicken it a bit more. I love maple and these are out of this world good.

Rating: 1
I was disappointed in these. I should have read the recipe more carefully before starting, but I love maple scones so I forged ahead. With 1.5 sticks of butter for only 8 scones and no eggs, I was not surprised that these came out more like shortbread. Much too rich for a regular scone!

Rating: 3
I made these scones without the glaze, since I'm not much of a sweet-tooth. They were a little too plain without it. I will make them again (everyone loved them), but next time I'll make the glaze, too, and maybe add some chopped picans. All in all, the scones rock.

Rating: 3
I thought this scone recipe was rather tasty and I always make it in the Fall. The scones aren't too dry, are dense and flavorful. The one downer is that you have to have been reeeeally good throughout summer in order to eat these scones. - they go straight to your hips (if you're a woman. straight to your belly if you're a man). One problem I continually have, being the part-time, half-hearted baker that I am: I can never get the glaze to set. That aside, I always stick a half-nut (walnut or pecan) in the glaze of each scone. Almost perfect.

This recipe is easy to follow and end product is delicious. My whole family--including children--loves them.

If you love maple, these scones are for you. I added about 1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans at the point of kneading the dough. Very yummy. I had some glaze left over. I didn't want a lot of thick icing on top, and they didn't seem to need it, either. This recipe is a keeper.

These scones were fairly nice especially that I added chopped dates, but it's still not what you can find in England. I'll keep looking for that recipe. Besides you should really make more than 8 with this recipe.

So scrumptous...a very lovely treat...great with coffee or tea. Easy, easy to make. I used 1/2 regular flour and 1/2 whole wheat. I did use the cream, so they are very rich, but so good!

These scones are one of my favorites. I recommend making them smaller. I used a round mold and cut them into smaller shapes and ended up making 14. The maple flavor is geat without being overpowering. I recommend using a good quality maple syrup. I will try them with oates next time.

The maple nut scones are a special treat for us at Starbucks and we have finally found a substitute. I followed the readers recommendation of adding the oatmeal, only I pulverized it in the blender first - same with the walnuts. Also cut out the whipping creame and just used milk - These are a special treat.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe. The scones were pleasantly crunchy on the outside and crumbly on the inside. I made a few modifications to the recipe. I used the oatmeal substitution suggested in an earlier review, I used skim milk instead of the cream, I used my food processor instead of my hands, and I just sprinkled sugar on the scones before baking instead of making the glaze. The scones were still delicious!

I halved the recipe (there are just 2 of us), and added 1/4 cinnamon chips. Fabulous right out of the oven. I will definitly try the lower fat version, as I see myself making these often!

These are great scones. I made them with the oats and also added 1/4 cup of walnuts as well. I didnt have any cream on hand and used 1% milk. The flavor was good, although I am sure the cream makes them much richer. Would like to try the fat free evap. milk substitue suggested by another next time!

I made these scones for a women's Christmas burnch and received many positive comments. These scones, I believe, are more of the english style and have a biscuit-like appearance, but the cream makes them rich tasting. Very good with a hot beverage.

These scones were delicious. The dough was very easy to work with and next time I'll try the oat variation as suggested. However, the glaze was too sweet and I won't add it again. It was a detraction from the wonderful texture and richness. Also, next time I will try cutting them in smaller servings. This is enough for 10-12 scones. Please try these, you wont regret it!

These scones are absolutely delicious. I used the substitutions suggested by another reviewer (1 3/4 cup flour, 1 1/4 cup oatmeal), which are a must. For a lower fat scone with all the flavor, I substituted fat free evaporated milk for the cream (only requires 1/2 cup-no extra in the scone recipe). For the glaze, substitute the 2 tsp imitation maple flavor for the maple syrup to get the maple flavor you are looking for.

Yummy, yummy! A very easy dough to work with. Flaky results with a great maple flavour. I didn't quite knead the dough for the time required; I did so only for about 2 or 3 minutes. I ate one right out of the oven with the glaze still dripping off. Yeah, it was heavenly.

Gosh, I'm wondering if there is something wrong with my taste buds. I thought both the scone & especially the glaze were very lacking in flavor. The maple flavor was negligent. I added the oats and nuts as suggested. I did not like the chunky texture this created. I would much rather use this much fat and calories on a slice of cake of a couple good cookies. For scones, I would greatly prefer a lemon poppyseed recipe found in a 1997 Southern Living. These are huge. I made them for tea. My mother and I split one. Now I'm wondering what to do with the other 7! They'll probably go down the garbage disposal.

I already reviewed this recipe once, but had to make another comment. I took the advice of the other reviewer and added oats and nuts. FANTASTIC!! This is how I make them all the time now. And I DID make a gift of this for Christmas for my mother. I mixed up all the dry ingredients, and put them in a pretty mixing bowl with a spoon and maple syrup bottle.

My husband and I are big fans of Starbuck's Maple Oat Scones, so I followed the advice of another reviewer and used less flour and added oats & toasted pecans. They were AMAZING. Our out-of-town guests raved & requested the recipe. My small children even ate them! My only advice is to make half the recipe for frosting; it's great, but there's at least half left over. This would be a great recipe to combine all ingredients in a jar w/ a decorative lid and give as a teacher or hostess gift.

I made these for an office luncheon, and although they went over generally well, I was a little disappointed. I thought they were a bit too sweet and the glaze didn't harden up as much as I would have liked (although that might be due to not adding enough powdered sugar to make it really stiff) The addition of nuts, as one reviewer suggested, probably would enhance the texture. If I make these again, I would try that.

I made these on Christmas morning. I only had 1/4 cup maple syrup on hand and used dark corn syrup for the rest--and the scones weren't as tasty as they could've been. Not having maple syrup for the glaze hurt, too. They were very tender and flaky and beautiful to look at, but they needed the extra maple. I'm looking forward to making them again with all the maple syrup, and I think adding some pecan pieces would be a great touch.

I love the Maple Oat Nut scones from Starbucks, and wanted to try to duplicate it. So I modified this recipe by using 1 3/4c. flour + 1 1/4c. rolled oats, added 1/2c. chopped walnuts. Turned out excellent! Even better than the Starbucks version--light, flaky, decadent! This is a keeper!

I liked these. They are quite big and probably could be cut into 12 pieces instead of the 8. Also, I may have flattened mine too much, but they took only about 10 minutes to cook. Keep an eye on them so they don't burn.

My family went crazy for these scones. I had all the ingredients at home- so I got up early on Sunday and made them. The only thing I did differently is to egg wash the tops before I baked them (using cream and one beaten egg) The scones were flaky and light with just enough of the maple flavor. Next time I might try to add one cup of oats and cut down the flour by one cup. What a special treat anytime- but they're great warm!
