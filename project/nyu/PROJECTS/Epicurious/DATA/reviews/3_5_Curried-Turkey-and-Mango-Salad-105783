Love this! Easy and versatile enough that if you don't have the exact ingredients on hand you can substitute. Make it all the time and do things to taste.

This is an interesting and different way to use up leftover turkey. We enjoyed it, but I think next time I would: add more mango, reduce the amount of chopped onion (I didn't even add the thinly sliced onion and still I thought it was too oniony), add more cashews (added just before serving to maintain the crunch), add a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper (I think the heat would be a nice contrast to the sweet mango). We grilled some slices of pineapple and had that alongside - a very complimentary pairing that I would highly recommend.

this was pretty good and really really easy. we didn't have curry powder so used paste instead. the dressing was a little bland but probably will get better once it sits a day. more heat in the dressing would be good. also the recipe made a lot of dressing - so dont dump all of it in at once

Yummy! I did not have Curry on hand so it was omitted, still delicious but I can see an improvement with the curry. Made sure to chop the cashews for more even taste and next time I'll try different fruit. Fabu!!!

FAB!! Very rereshing. I went and bought another turkey after thanksgiving just to have this dish

This is excellent, not only because it's delicious, but because it's so easy to make. I decreased the mayo and increased the yogurt to curb the fat content a bit and in no way did I feel it was lacking as a result. I didn't have a problem with either the quantity of onions or the curry powder as others have suggested.

I was looking for something lighter for dinner since Christmas eating can be heavy. This was SO good. I did not have red onion, used green onions and celery for crunch plus a few raisens. I would definitely make it again!

I substituted scallions for red onion, used fruit from an entire mango, added more nuts and passed nuts for guests to sprinkle on top; served with fresh asparagas and focaccia: YUM!

Yummy! With a few changes, of course. I used grilled chicken breast instead of turkey, chopped apple instead of mango, decreased the amount of cashews, mayo, and yogurt, used curry paste instead of powder (might have been a little strong) and used scallions instead of red onion - and less of them. It's very good - I'm finishing it off today for lunch!

This recipe would be great around the holidays - it's uses up leftover poultry, is dead simple, and served on a bed of greens is elegant enough for company. Instead of mixing in the mango, I gave a choice of mango and green apple bits on the side. Both were good.

Hey Now this one rocks! Too much purple onion can be the down fall in this dish but it did make the current rotation at our crib with some great Sonoma County vino Bada Bing! Ciao.

Absolutely delicious! My family hates raw onions, but loved this dish. (I did soak them in cold water for 1/2 hour.) I used half chicken and turkey.

This was very tasty and very easy. I didn't use as much onion as called for and I will definitely add more mango the next time I make it. It has flavor, texture and color. What more can you ask for?

Delicious and really easy to make! I didn't put in as many onions as the recipe called for and still thought they overwhelmed the mango, so I'll just sprinkle a few in next time.

this is a good way to use dry turkey meat..however, the curry powder should be replaced with cooked curry paste, as raw curry powder is not mellow and should always be cooked before adding to a ready to eat sauce...u can use any of the cooked bottle varieties..I use pateks
