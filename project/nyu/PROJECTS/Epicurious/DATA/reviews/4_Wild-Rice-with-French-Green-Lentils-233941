Another happy vegetarian here-- prepared this w/o pancetta with delicious results. Love the aromatic combination of cloves and bay. Also didn't have celery, replaced it with a very small sprig of intense angelica from my garden; it was good. I removed the veggies from the lentils after cooking per the recipe and am glad I did; the texture was really nice that way. I'll definitely reduce the salt in the wild rice next time--it was a wee bit too prominent for my taste. And like others, the lentils took considerably longer to cook; I'll start them before the wild rice.

Really very good. Like others, I had to make modifications to fit what I had on hand: a little wild rice and some red rice from France. Wish I had had pancetta but made do with prosciutto. Also added twice the lentils called for and increased water and cooking time. We had this with grilled lamb chops. Yum!

Tasty dish, will def keep in rotation! Needs more time and liquid though for the lentils (I had to add about 1 cup more water and 20 mins or so). this can easily be vegan without the pancetta. Just add some soy sauce and/or mushrooms for that umami goodness.

I doubled the lentils (and everything that goes with it), left in the veggies, and didn't bother with the parsley. Otherwise I followed the recipe and this was really good. I took advice from another reviewer and served it with butternut squash cooked with the leftover bacon from the lentils and simmered in apple cider, water, and balsamic vinegar. You remember when you were a kid and ate a meal that was so delicious and satisfying you actually ate slowly and wanted it to last forever? This was just like that.

I used followed others' advice and chopped then sauteed the onion, celery and carrot at the start. Used canadian bacon instead of pancetta, and substituted 'no-chicken broth' for half of the water. Aside from the popping of said meat in pan, it was easy and delicious. Even with using more 'no-chicken broth' and some saffron in the rice, the dish tasted much more savory and satisfying without the rice. I will definitely make it again, sans rice next time!

The French green lentils make a real difference in the taste--you can find them at just about any whole food/organic grocery. I have also made this dish as a vegetarian side with a cinnamon stick thrown in. This is a standby and especially good with sweet potatoes or yams--if I'm in a hurry for a healthy lunch, I just mash a sweet potato into a bowl of this. YUM

This was an easy and excellent recipe for lentils! I didn't have wild rice or pancetta so I just made it with brown rice and it was still delicious!

Loved it. Used low sodium chicken broth instead of water and cut out the salt. The lentils took twice as long to cook, and I had to add more broth, but the end result was fabulous. Paired this with lamb and minted carrots for a dinner party -- big success.

Delicious! I cheated and used pre-cooked bacon bits (some high-quality ones with no preservatives) instead of pancetta, and it was just wonderful. Pretty easy, too. This is going right into my 'favorites' file.

Excellent dish, flavors and textures. I used diced prosciutto instead of pancetta with superb results. Keeper!

Yummy! I had pre- cooked lentils so I just sauteed up the carrot, celery, et al. and tossed them into the mix. I didn't have enough wild rice so I filled in with brown basmati and cooked both with the bay leaf and a little beef stock. Delish! Will make this again with more lentils as veggie main dish.

I have made this many times and find it wonderful each and every one. I'm vegetarian so I leave out the panacea but I think it stands on it's own. The french lentils are important to the quality and the taste I believe. I love to serve it with a side of winter squash and a glass of red wine.

This is an excellent hearty side, with a wonderful texture. Instead of discarding the vegetables, I chopped them before browning and left them in. Stirred in chopped golden raisins, and a pinch of cayenne at the very end, which added a nice balance.

This is a great winter meal alongside a simple green salad or some steamed veggies. My subs- yellow lentils instead of green- thick bacon instead of pancetta- ground gloves instead of whole. I only used about half the amount of rice, too. Didn't want to lose the lentils and bacon in the rice.

This is a really good recipe. I don't use pancetta -- instead, I brown chopped lamb sausage with Moroccan spices (from Whole Foods). I have also used equal parts of wild and brown rice when i didn't have enough wild on hand. It is a wonderful, satisfying dish.

Followed recipe exactly. Excellent flavor. Served with Standing Rib Roast w/Rosemary Thyme Crust. It was an excellent combination.

My husband and I very much enjoyed this dish with our duck confit. I did, however, chop the onion, celery and carrot and added ground cloves. And, the leftovers were equally as delicious as soup recommended below.

This is a wonderful and different side dish. I often make the middle eastern dish mujadarrah (rice, carmelized onion and lentils)... the nice, nutty flavor of the wild rice - and the meat - make this great. I substituted proscuito for the pancetta, but otherwise followed the directions - will try to find pancetta next time.

This was easy to make. It has great texture, flavor and color. I used regular dried lentils as I could not find the french green lentils at my local market. Cooking the lentils in the pancetta is a must (although you could probably substitute bacon if necessary. This goes well with meat and chicken.

I loved this recipe. I diced up the onion and carrot and added them back to the rice-lentil mix rather than discarding them. We had a lot of leftovers, so after the second day, I added chicken broth, milk, and a little cream to turn this into a very good wild rice lentil soup.

Lovely side dish! The lentils take on a deeply complex flavor and the rice offers a nice texture contrast. We served this with the rest of the red wine pairing menu in the 02/06 issue. Can be made one day ahead. Just be sure to save some of the cooking liquid from the lentils. Stir in just prior to reheating. Can't wait to have some cold for lunch!

This was an excellent side dish that came together more quickly than I thought it would. The contrasting textures of rice & lentils were great. Served it with stuffed veal. Great leftover served cold.
