This is good but didn't knock my socks off. It's at least something different to do with broccoli, cauliflower, or broccoflower.

This dish is a regular at our house...we pile on the anchovies, it eat tossed with good quality whole wheat pasta and a tossed green salad. Divine. We feel spoiled.

I thought this was delicious...my husband thought it was eh...I think my palate is a bit more sensitive. The flavors are not strong but blended very well. If he liked it I would definitely make it again...but alas.

Amazing! I added mushrooms at the garlic stage and then added 2 cups of cooked spaghetti at the end - and we had it as a main with parmesan cheese and a salad - incredible, delicious, marvellous!!!!

This is a great recipe. If you were surprised at how good cauliflower or broccoflower could be - check out the roasted cauliflower recipe on this site. Super easy and yummy!

Very good and so easy. My 18 month old loved it. I also substituted fresh basil for the parsley and will do so again.

Terrific. I used cauliflower and it was a hit. My husband gave this one rave reviews and asked for me to put this in our "permanent recipe notebook" for future side dishes. I think we have a new love for this terrific veggie thanks to the addition of anchovies and garlic!

Made this with broccoli and used a whole 2 oz can of anchovies. Very good and could be made ahead by precooking broccoli and making up the 'sauce' ahead of time.

I used plain cauliflower for this recipe and it was very well received-especially by the teenagers, who have requested it again! The combination of flavors is addictive.
