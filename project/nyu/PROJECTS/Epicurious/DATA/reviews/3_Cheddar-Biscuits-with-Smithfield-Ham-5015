Very yummy, and moist. I do not like most biscuit recipes-this was great. I too added a pinch of cayenne, and used 2T butter plus 1 T shortening. Browned no problem. Did not need full 15 min cooking-only 11. Also cut thicker-always best w/any biscuit.

This is pretty salty -- since Smithfield Ham is pretty intensely so -- but it's good brunch fare for a buffet. The guys will like it. Make sure to not roll the biscuits too thin or they will overbake.

I read the previous review, and for added flavor, I added a little blue cheese and a little cayenne pepper. I used half butter and half shortening, and kept adding until I liked the consistency. My husband and I loved them, and I plan to make them for family dinner this Sunday

I have made these biscuits many times with great success. They are perfectly paired with a flavorful ham...I usually use Black Forest Ham. The biscuits themselves are meant to be somewhat subtle, so a distinctive tasting ham is important.

The biscuits were dry and pale -- even after brushing with butter and returning to the oven. There was very little flavor. I expected some hint of cheese but got a bland pasty taste instead.
