i love this recipe! i used red wine instead of white wine to make the garlic a little prettier - it turned out fabulous! it is wonderful with cheese and crackers or in bloody marys. i have made this several times!

I get loads of garlic every week from a near by farmers market. For months, this has been my staple recipe. I love this pickling process. These cloves are fantastic on salad, they are great on hors d'oeurves trays. I sometimes need to boil tham longer than this recipe says, I take one out and taste test for my desired texture.

I love pickled anything, but garlic and onions are my favorites. I think when I make this again I'll add some red pepper flakes and maybe not cook it as long.

After all the glowing reviews I made several batches of this to give at Christmas. What's the big deal? I followed the recipe exactly and all I got was hard, sour garlic. Yuck!

Scrummy? Scrummy? I love you Kiwi's :) I also love this recipe. I loved it SO MUCH that I didn't actually eat it, I simply rubbed it all over my naked body then sat in the bath enjoying my fragrance whilst listening to the Rolling Stones, doncha know? Actually, all seriousity aside, I find it difficult to dislike almost ANY pickled garlic and this one is a keeper!

I didn't have the chili or white wine vinegar, so I used some crushed red chile and raspberry vinegar. It stained the cloves a bit, but they flavor is quite interesting with the raspberry! I made these last fall, packed them into a large jar, and covered the top with 1/4" of olive oil. They're still in the refrigerator, taste great 7 months later, and the thawed vinegar/oil mixture should taste wonderful drizzled on greens.

This is an excellent appetizer. I looked for this receipt because a local Mexican restaurant makes a mixture of pickled veggies and leaves them on the table while customers wait for food. I eat so much of the garlic out of the veggie bowl that the waiter/waitress constantly has to refill. I am making my second batch tonight and I plan on doubling the receipt so I can have it around for a while. It is also a great item to bring to others homes since few people have eaten this before.

Have prepared this on request for my garlic loving friends. It's great as an appetizer, or as a garnish for martinis! Go=lootinous.

Yummm!!! We love garlic, and this pickled garlic is scrummy! I made it once without using the white wine (I just used 1 cup white vinegar) and it was more piquant, which we prefer. Very interested to hear it lasts for up to a year - ours lasts until the day it's ready to eat (if we're lucky).

The recipe is good but the garlic becomes too soft. I was trying to get a pickled garlic to use in a Martini. So I tried it again and didn't boil it as long, left it on the stove for about 4 hours, then put it in the jar. Instead of the rosemary, thyme, and whole chili pepper, I left them out and used crushed red pepper, and some lenom rind cut off with a potato peeler. The garlic comes out crunchier yet not killer hot like raw garlic and as I finish my Martini, the garlic clove goes down so well!!!! Might just make some for Christmas presents.
