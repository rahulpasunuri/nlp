Wow, delicious and super moist!! I didn't have dijon so i just mixed my spicy mustard w/ a little mayo. I also didn't use the dry sherry in the recipe since i didn't have any and i think it turned out yummy still. And i didn't feel like roasting my own bell pepper so i used roasted red pepper in a jar which worked out great!!

I only gave this 2 forks because I received mixed reviews. i liked it, but my husband, who loves coconut-ate 2 bites before putting down his fork. Oh well. I doubt I would make it again but if I did I might try making it with non-sweetened coconut.

This is easy and tasty. I followed the recipe exactly. The chicken breasts were very juicy. I will definitely make this again.

I had made this a few years ago and thought it was amazing. Remembering this, I wanted to do it again, so I made it last night and my thoughts have not changed. I made the sauce the night before and the sauce alone made me worried, but when it all came together everything compliments each other so well. When I added the sherry, the house took on this delicious aroma that made our mouths water. We accompanied it with a side of brown rice and steamed veggies. The chicken alone would have been fine but the sauce does add a 'little' something nice and the presentation is beautiful. My man said I outdid myself, when in fact this recipe is quite simple. I will make this over and over again!!!!!

Going into it, I was skeptical of a roasted red pepper sauce with coconut chicken. Seemed like an odd pairing -- and it was. The sauce really added nothing to the dish. Would like to make again with some sort of citrus based sauce, I think. Also, would have liked the breading to adhere to the chicken better, but that could be an issue of technique. Any tips?

Fantastic. I marinated the chicken in coconut milk over night and served it over lime and coconut rice, and it is definitely a new favorite.

Have to agree with Vienna. The sauce is incredibly mediocre, even after adding more cayenne. It's a perfectly nice recipe, it's just not great. Also, not nearly as time consuming as others complained.

I was really expecting something fabulous and was disappointed...the sauce needed something in a big way. Coconut milk? Soy sauce? Don't know, but won't try this again. A messy mess.

I LOVE this recipe. I have made it a dozen times! The dijon mustard-garlic mixture makes a big difference and the sweetness of the coconut is perfect with the red pepper sauce.

I have been trying to "wing it" in the kitchen more, so I didn't actually measure anything and I did the garlic in the sauce instead of the mustard, (and the black pepper spilled into the sauce...) and I kind of burnt the coconut... I loved it. It was awesome! Hubbie dug it too. I served it with rice. Meant to serve with a green but my spinach was spoiled and I didn't time right for anything else. I have to say I was very impressed with how good it was considering how hodge-podge my technique and guestimates with measurements were. I will definitely make this again!!! oh - and I used jarred roasted red pepper from trader joes. everything was on hand - so handy!

Rating: 4
The chicken alone was absolutely fantastic! I didn't happen to have any ingredients on hand for the red bell pepper sauce so I improvised & used a ready-made bottle of pineapple-teriyaki marinade as a dipping sauce which was a great combination. I absolutely love coconut, so this recipe definitely appealed to me.

This recipe was a disappointment; considering the reviews, I was quite underwhelmed. The sauce is mediocre and bland, needs more than just a dash of cayenne, maybe some butter instead of or with olive oil give it some life. The coconut chicken was OK; I took the Panko advice which I think was a mistake. The whole recipe needs considerable improvement.

While I didn't make the chicken, opting for a less sweet protein source, I thoroughly enjoyed the red pepper sauce! Even without the sugar (and a lot of cayenne and salt!) it was delicious! Highly recommended even as a saute sauce for any chicken/pork.

FABULOUS! This recipe is a definite keeper! Can't say enough positive things. For a shortcut, I substituted jarred roasted peppers (found in the canned vegetable aisle) and omitted the lemon juice and salt. Not only is this much faster, but it's also cheaper. The chicken is good by itself, but the sauce is fabulous as well. TRY THIS RECIPE!

My family really enjoyed this dish. I did alter a couple of things. I used jarred roasted red peppers and added a touch of half and half to the blender to create a creamier sauce. I then chilled the sauce while I cooked the chicken. I took others advise and used panko along with the coconut. The taste of this dish was very good. I loved the sweetness of the coconut with the spicy sauce. I served this with white rice and sauteed green beans. Very easy to make, a perfect weeknight meal.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I can imagine how the panko mentioned by the previous review would top the dish - but I didn't have any on hand. The coconut was a bit too sweet for a main course for me, so I sprinkled a little sugar into the egg mixture and used dessicated unsweetened coconut shreds instead. I served the chicken over half brown-half white rice with the chilled red bell pepper sauce (spiked with extra cayenne - the cold sweet, sauce with lots of cayenne heat) balanced the flavors perfectly.

Rating: 3
Yum. I really liked the sauce, and I made it with jarred peppers to save time. Also, to cut back on the sweetness, instead of rolling the chicken in plain coconut, I used 1/2 coconut and 1/2 panko, which made it really crispy and yummy! Also, I made some oven fries on the side, and dipping them in the roasted pepper sauce was really good.

Delicious and unusual...a hit for my whole family. We served with white rice and Sauteed Carrot with Lemon and Rosemary (from this site). It was a great dinner!

Don't use sweetened coconut and it is much better and lets teh flavours of eth sauce come through. The coconut then becomes subtle and not overpowering.

Rating: 3
I will make this again, but I will make these changes: up the cayenne (it needs a kick to counter the sweetness of the coconut); cut back on the coconut (again, due to the sweetness); punch up just about all of the other seasonings. The delicious coconut crust really over-powered all the other flavors I spent so much time preparing (mashed garlic, etc.). Also, I'd suggest serving with something relatively tame so that the flavors of this can come through.

Rating: 3
If the guy (or gal) you're cooking for loves coconut then this is a keeper. My guy loved it (and so did his buddy)! It's a bit labor intensive but worth the effort. One thing to note is than this recipe is very portion specific, so if you want to do it for 3 or more servings be sure you make the necessary adjustments. They'll love you for this one!

Rating: 4
This was so YUMMY. I had made the red pepper sauce on its own before, but never done the combo with the coconut chicken. I'm kicking myself for not doing it sooner! I didn't have ground ginger so I subbed in fresh, and used white wine in place of the sherry. I wish I had leftovers, but it got gobbled up so quickly! I would love to try the coconut on shrimp too.

I was a little nervous about this because my husband (who's an excellent cook) favors the 'not too many ingredients' school of thought. I didn't tell him what I was cooking because I knew he'd have reservations... He LOVED it! The sauce is perfect with jarred peppers, and I didn't have ground ginger so I used double the amount of fresh. Fantasic recipe!

Excellent - it came out moist, and was quite easy to make. I would recommend this dish to anybody. I hate coconut in desserts - in this dish it was superb. I didn't use the red pepper sauce, but instead made the coconut curry sauce found on this site, with a few modifications.

I wasn't too impressed with the outcome, but I'm almost positive it wasn't the recipe, but rather just my inexperience with this type of recipe. The flavor was great, but the texture left something to be desired. Mine ended being more soggy and less crispy than anticipated. I will definitely make again, this time I will try to perfect the crispy coating.

I made this dish last week and still can't get over how scrumptious it was! At first, I agreed with the other reviews regarding the sauce. It really wasn't too tasty on its own. So, I added some more cayenne and some orange pineapple juice, and still found it so-so. However, once it was with the chicken and the arborio rice I served on the side, it was fabulous! It is a sauce after all, and not meant to be eaten solo. As a side point, I think this dish would also be good served with platanos maduros. Yum!

Quite frankly the best chicken dish that I have ever used off of this site. And all my recipe's come from epicurious. UNBELIEVABLE!!! My husband could not contain himself and he's used to gourmet pretty much everday. You must try this. Totally worth the prep time, and so sinfully delicious I didn't even think about dessert.

Loved this recipe!! I did change the sauce though, it was to bitter. I added 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil, 3/4 cup mayo and 1/2 teaspoon salt, I also used 2 peppers. This is alot of work but so worth it. I loved the combination of flavors!! Very good for dinner guests, especially if you put the sauce in a squirt bottle and make a circular design on the plate and top with the chicken and a curly lemon zest!! Yum!

My girlfriend and I truly enjoyed this recipe. The coconut added just enough sweetness to the chicken and the sauce was great. She particularly enjoyed the sauce mixed with her white rice.

This dish was fantastic! I made it just for myself - I wanted to make something special and this fit the bill perfectly. I like spicy food, so I added quite a bit of Cayenne to the sauce (maybe about 3/4 t or so). I thought the spicy sauce was a good contrast to the sweetness of the chicken. I also used a whole-grain mustard that has a bit of horseradish in it, and I think that added zip to the chicken. I had the leftovers for lunch today - not as good as fresh from the oven, but still okay reheated in the microwave.

Rating: 3
Even though I like all of the ingredients in the sauce, it was positively vile. Straight to the trash, and thank goodness I had the sense to taste it before I put it on the chicken, which was fabulous. I think a mustard sauce would be better on this, based on the hint of mustard flavor imparted by the rub.

WOW. I made this last night for five hungry guys as we watched the Angels destroy the Giants in the World Series. All night the house was filled with the sound of cheering men, until I served this recipe...then all of a sudden SILENCE as they all ate. They all loved it, including myself. The sauce is WONDERFUL. I even forgot to include the sherry, but it wouldn't have mattered either way. THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST!

My husband usually balks at chicken breast meat because most recipes that call for it are so dry. Not this dish, the chicken was so moist. The flavors were wonderful. He told me at least five times during dinner how wonderful it was! My two-year old loved it too. We love sauces so I doubled the sauce portion of the recipe. I also used roasted red peppers from a jar instead of roasting my own, it's a time saver.

Chicken was excellent. Seems like a lot of work, but if you marinade the night before and prepare the sauce beforehand as well, it takes very little time to put together.

This recipe was reccomended to me by Stu from Richmond hill. In one of the reviews someone suggested cutting up the chicken so that there's more of a coconut taste. I did just that and YUM! Very easy to prepare. However, I would advise making the red bell pepper sauce & the garlic/mustard marinade in advance. Store them in the fridge until needed. This cuts time in half!

Great blend of flavours. I suggest you double or triple the red pepper sauce because everyone loves it. I used Dijon mustard with whole mustard seeds, and also cut up the skinless, boneless chicken breasts to get more of the flavourful coconut "crust".

Fabulous! Although this is a messy recipe to make, it is worth the effort. I used unsweetened coconut, but found it just as good as the sweetened in this case. Next time I make this, I would definetly marinade the chicken in the dijon/garlic/ginger mix rather than just brush the chicken with it.

I was expecting to be just blown away, but wasn't. The coconut made the dish _very_ sweet. I bet people who used fresh grated coconut were on the right track--I'd like to try it that way sometime. The red pepper sauce was an interesting addition, not entirely necessary I'd think. I did like the mustard-garlic-ginger spread on the chicken, though, and the chicken came out wonderfully tender. I used fresh ginger, so probably ended up using much more than 1/8 tsp. So, with a little variation, I think I could really like this chicken. Served it will egg noodles and a salad, and all in all it was a fine meal. I'm just not clamoring to make it again.

Very good and relatively quick to make. Didn't have a lemon so I substituted sherry vinegar. Also, used jarred roasted peppers to save time. I think this could make a nice hors d'oeuvre too - Cut the chicken into bite size "fingers" and serve the sauce on the side for dipping.

I'm not much of a cook, but I was in the mood to try something new, so I came on this site and tried this one. I loved it. my boyfriend hated it. here's the big hint: don't make this for someone who hates coconut! :) I followed the recipe with the exception that I did not bother to roast (or peel) the red pepper before tossing it into the blender. (sounded like work) It was still yummy. i plan on inviting over my girlfriend who likes coconut and making it again soon.

I loved this recipe. I have made it with both Chicken and Shrimp. I did make a few substitutions. I bought and grated my own coconut, thus reducing some sugar content and making it less likely to burn the coconut. Omitting the sherry makes it stays crispier and better tasting. The red pepper sauce is best made a day ahead, then the flavors have more time to blend.

I was worried that it might be too sweet based on the comments of another cook, but I thought the balance of sweet with tart was excellent. Also, I really don't like mustard, but I went ahead and tried this. For any mustard haters hesitating to try it, don't! The mustard flavor was extremely subtle and only enhanced the sweetness of the chicken with the roasted pepper sauce. I served with green salad and orzo.
