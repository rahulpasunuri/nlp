Super! Everyone at Thanksgiving loved this! I'm not sure why some folks say this was bland. Maybe they cut the slices too thickly, didn't use fresh thyme, or enough thyme, salt and pepper - or maybe their expectations were out of line with what this dish has to offer. I actually added more thyme (not only simmered in the cream, but also trimmed leaves off of additional stalks, chopped them and added them to the layers), as well as a *little* bit more salt and cheese (I wanted to make sure it didn't come out bland!).

I wanted to like this recipe but it was just not that good. My husband did like it more than I did, but I think there are many better butternut squash recipes available.

SO simple! I was really tempted to add some extra flavor like garlic & onion but I decided to trust gourmet & try it as is, & it was fantastic! I really think adding extra flavors would hide the star. Some dishes that are super simple are the best, & this is one of them. This is how butternut squash should taste. Delicious!

We sliced the squash into ridgy chips with a mandoline. Made it as part of an Eat Local potluck. We had no leftovers!

Delicious! I had to bake it a little longer to cook in the center. I think it is because I cut the pieces myself. I will make this again.

This was delicious, but I added about a half cup of thinly sliced sauteed leeks, I used chipotle pepper instead of black pepper, and I used Cabot extra sharp cheddar. Also I stripped the thyme leaves from the sprigs and scattered them over the squash. I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and it curdled, but was delicious anyway. I sprinkled some dry breadcrumbs browned in a tsp of olive oil to disguise the curdled pieces. So I did a lot to this recipe, which I think would have been bland without my additions.

made this for our christmas eve family gathering and it was LOVED by all! the funny thing is that i got the best compliments from the kids, 13 and 9, who thought 'it was really good'. i used a mandoline for slicing the squash for a double recipe and that took a loooong time. i knew it would, and it was worth it. it's not a dish to make in a hurry, unfortunately. BUT the ingredients could probably transfer easily to a cubed butternut squash dish. we used cheddar, no rind, it was the cheap stuff. home grown butternut squash also helped make for a delicious flavor. will make it again when i have time! note: if using a mandoline, choose small butternut squash, it's easier to slice.

This recipe was so beautiful and so delicious. Perfect with ham, and beautifully displayed when cut with a biscuit cutter.

The scalloped recipe is great and interchangable, I only had Fontana cheese and it was so yummy. A nice change up with the butternut squash.

I don't own a Japanese Benriner, so instead I thinly cut the squash and it was fine. The nice thing about this dish is you can make it earlier in the day and then warm it a dinner time. It would have been very helpful to see the illustration referred to.

Made this for Canadian Thanksgiving dinner last weekend. I added a few dried cranberries but otherwise followed the recipe. Very rich. Everybody raved and wanted the recipe. I used the bottoms of the butternut squash and made Butternut Squash Soup with Ginger and Lime. Next time I will add some carmelized onions.

This dish is wonderful. I've made it several times and used different cheeses, added onions on occasion and have completely changed out the squash for potatoes (1/2 and 1/2 or milk works best in that case). Instead of thyme, I use tarragon and it's a perfect compliment.

I made this for friends to accompany rosemary and garlic marinated lamb chops. They could not stop raving!!! I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and there was no need to butter the baking dish. I also used mild cheddar. I think I will add nutmeg next time but the dish just like it is great!

Oaka cheese was a great addition but i'm sure Parmesian would work fine too. I liked the dish for a rich side dish served with roasted Pork or Beef on a winter night. Tastes great the next day or 2 as well

We love butternut squash, but this recipe was too bland. Needs some spicing up. Nutmeg maybe?

An excellent side dish. I could not find the Oka cheese, so used the mild cheddar as suggested It was liked by all. I thought it would be plain based on the recipe, but the flavor of the butternut squash carried the dish very nicely. A definite repeat for potluck dinners and for entertaining.
