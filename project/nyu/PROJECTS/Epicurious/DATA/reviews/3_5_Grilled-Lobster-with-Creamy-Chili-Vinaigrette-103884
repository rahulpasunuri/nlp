This recipe has three parts that don't form a good combination. The problem is the sauce: it's ghastly. The recipe does describe a flavorful way to make angel hair pasta and serve it warm without having to make it at the last minute. The simple way to grill the lobster was good, too, and worked using my oven's broiler. The sauce was another story. Even cutting the proportions down by half, I had way too much. I believe the recipe says to use the sauce as a dip, but the photo shows the pasta swimming in it. Yuck! The sauce has an overwhelming taste of mayonnaise and acrid garlic (my garlic was fresh). Why would I want to dip warm lobster in a cold mayonnaise sauce? And no one would want to eat warm angel hair pasta swimming in a cold mayonnaise sauce. I like Southwestern cuisine and have even eaten at Geronimo's. The sauce is the only inventive part of this recipe, and it was a weird combination of flavors that I didn't think made a very tasty sauce. (I am generally leery of restaurant recipes. More often than not, I believe they are not described accurately.) The leftover sauce is still sitting in my refrigerator. I don't think I want to ruin a good artichoke with it.

lovely sauce. tried it first with lobster (sans pasta) and had so much left over that we used it for artichokes the next night. when i made it the second time i substituted creme fraiche/plain greek yogurt for the mayo because i don't really like mayo. added extra crushed red chile peppers for more spice.

I've made this recipe twice and it is simply amazing. Grilled lobster is a rare treat we allow ourselves a couple times a year and with this vinaigrette, it sparkles. I halved the recipe and still had plenty to use later with grilled salmon, scallops and pan- broiled halibut.

I made this last night for New Years Eve. I parboiled then roasted the lobsters (CA Spiny, not Maine), rather than grilled (for ease of preparation). I added a little more lemon juice to the Vinaigrette than the recipe called for, and used only a sprinkle of sugar for personal taste. It was a huge hit all around the table. I served it with a green salad. I will use this recipe again in the future.

As others have noted, the recipe produces too much sauce, and it has overwhelming flavor. I like spicy food, but this didn't appeal to me. If you're spending $15 a tail, I'd recommend finding another way to cook lobster. This was particularly disappointing since it comes from Geronimo.

Seriously..... do yourself a favor and make this recipe it is perfection on a plate!

My husband and I thought this was a great recipe. It's creative served over a bed of pasta and the sauce was unique and extremely tasty- we thought it was as good or better than you'd get at a high end restaurant. I didn't have the cilantro (I used coriander instead) nor did I have the chili garlic sauce (used a few dashes of cayenne). Great presentation and will definitely make this a keeper- especially for entertaining!

This is a really great recipe, but it is much better served over a bed of greens, with a starch on the side...use vinagarette sparingly, drizzled near lobster, not on lobster and I think that it's much more of a winner.

I made this recipe for Christmas eve taking advice from previous reviews to cut the Vinaegrette in half, which I did. We had plenty for 4 lobsters and much left over. The good news is that it was all used up on subsequent panini sandwiches and was wonderful on those, too. The lobster recipe was outstanding. I didn't change a thing (other than 1/2ing the sauce) and it was a huge hit with my family. Great combination! The sauce would be excellent on artichokes, too - as recommended by previous reviewers.

I agree with previous reviewers that the sauce is the best part of this dish, although the recipe leads to way too much. I will make the sauce again, but I won't serve it with lobster and pasta.

Make the full recipe on the sauce - it was way more than needed and we used it all week - as a dipping sauce, condiment for sandiwches, etc. Served it with pasta and jumbo shrimp - great meal.

This was an interesting recipe, full of good flavors. I agree with the person who said the sauce did not compliment the delicate taste of the lobster all that well, but lobster is so wonderful that it was still hard to complain. The pasta with the mayo seemed strange at first, but came off well. We cut back the vinaigrette recipe and had more than enough. I'd like to taste the recipe as prepared by the original chef and see what adjustments might work.

This was amazing! I used Butterflied Tiger Prawns instead of Lobster. I also only used 2 tbsp.'s of oil so it was lowfat. This is an elegant and impressive meal.

Absolutely loved it! Used parsley instead of cilantro. We will use this recipe again when entertaining friends this summer. We needed a little more time on the grill for the lobster.

Wow! What a great dish. We also used the sauce for dipping artichokes, and still had quite a bit of sauce to save for later.

Great sauce and a wonderful recipe.

When I made this for my husband he thought he had died and gone to heaven! Very delicous and impressive. As everyone else has mentioned, there is a lot of sauce however, it can be used for so many other things. It was delicious for dipping with grilled artichokes as one example. Bon Appetite!

Made the recipe just as written. Outstanding!

I have had this dish at Geronimo and since seeing the recipe in Bon Appetit have been making at home to impress guests. I add fresh rosemary to both the sauce and the pasta. I spread a couple of teaspoons of the sauce on the bottom of the plate and then add the pasta and top with lobster.

I loved the vinaigrette, but not with lobster. I think it would be better with chilled shrimp as a cocktail sauce. Today, I added some ground dried chipotle to my leftover vinaigrette and used it as a sandwich spread for a turkey & veggie tortilla rollup. That was fantastic! I will make the sauce again for that purpose. But while I enjoy creative sauces/dips for lobster, this wasn't one that complemented the lobster's flavor and texture....it detracted from the lobster. (Note: we didn't try it w/ the pasta)

There was a lot of sauce, but used it again for shrimp cocktail. Didn't use the pasta, Just the sauce and it was great!

Cut the vinaigrette recipe in half and it was still way too much sauce. Used reduced fat mayonaisse to cut down on the calories. And I suppose there is lies the hurdle. You really have to get over the unappealing concept of spagetti and mayonaisse. My wife and I just couldn't. Now, what to do with all that leftover sauce? We'll use it sparingly as dipping sauce for crabcakes.

It was delicious. For a person like me, this gourmet dish was excellent. The was eceptionally good!

Excellent recipe. I sautéed some garlic in olive oil before warming the pasta to give it a little oomph. The vinaigrette was heavenly but I ended up with too much, matched the lobster perfectly.

I agree with the other reviewers- quite yummy. I will however play with the sauce more next time- it is too thick for my taste (but hey, that's what a cup of mayonaise will do to a sauce). I will try thinning it out next time with some milk.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much! The recipe makes more than enough sauce for two servings. I would suggest using less sauce when serving to guest and allowing your guest to add more if they desire. Too much sauce is overwhelming. It is a fine balance. Ana

Absolutely wonderful and easy to make. Made the sauce 1 day ahead of time. Also, substituted broiled langostino's for lobster and added a bit more garlic.

This was awesome. A great special occasion meal. I made the lobster without the pasta and paired it with filet mignon for "surf and turf" with the sauce for dipping. It was tremendous.

Fabulous vinaigrette! Grilling the lobster gives it great flavor and I can't say enough about how great the creamy-chili vinaigrette was. It can be used on other fish or chicken. I used low-fat mayo and a little extra garlic and cilantro.
