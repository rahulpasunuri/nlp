Delicious way to welcome fall. I enjoyed this recipe very much. Followed Kaneohe Cook's suggestion to cook dumplings with the stew and I loved the results. Will certainly use again! Only draw back; it's time intensive. But would be more than willing to spend a cool winter afternoon preparing.

bland broth, and bland dumplings. suggest cooking dumplings in the chicken broth instead of steaming them--A lot of work with no improvement in flavor.

The recipe took a long time to prepare. When done, the chicken breast tasted overcooked and the sauce had little flavor. The ratio of vegetables to meat and sauce was too heavily weighted toward meat. The dumplings were too bland.

really nice rendition, more refined and updated with the addition of chicken breast, baby carrots and sugar snap peas, instead of just gloppy stewed chicken and mixed veggies. A nice cooler weather main dish
