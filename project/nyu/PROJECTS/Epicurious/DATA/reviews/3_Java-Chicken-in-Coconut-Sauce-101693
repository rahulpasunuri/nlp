The second time we tried this dish, we made saffroned jasmine rice from a box, and it was fantastic and quick. I did not think the dish itself was too difficult to make, and worth the little work and somewhat 'not-on-hand' ingredients (which are not expensive or wasteful) for a refreshing change in the normal menu. Unfortunately, we still have not found the lime leaves, but we are still looking.

Our version of this dish was missing lemongrass and lime jucie and still came out marvelously! We served the chicken with some cold cellophane noodles and two epicurious asian salads, great reviews from our guests!

A dish this labor-intensive I would expect to be more exciting. It was good but not fabulous-or flavorful-enough to offset the preparation. Even with the aromatic yellow rice it was not lively enough.

I have made this dish several times. The chicken is extremely tender and to really enjoy this dish to its fullest, it must be accompanied by the aromatic yellow rice. That recipe is good on its own. If you are looking for a new and different way to enjoy chicken - this is it.

Great dish. I did not have the lime leaves or lemongrass and used 1T of Lime Juice and 1/4t of lemon peel for the lemongrass. It turned out great. I actually lost part of finger tip slicing the apples, but saved the dish! Sevrved with the Aromatic Yellow Rice on the same page.

Baby food. Spent 30 min. trying to make this edible -- I split & stuffed the breasts with julienned red peppers & scallions, then added a variety of spices including SALT! Still needs work.
