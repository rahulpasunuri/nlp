I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. It was light and sweet but not heavy. I served it with french vanilla ice cream but think pear sorbet would just as good.

This dessert made for a nice light but delicious and beautiful alternative on my Christmas dessert buffet table. In my case, what made them even "lighter" was the fact that I substituted Splenda for the sugar, keeping in mind that several of my guests were diabetic, and the pears still came out great. Everyone commented on the pretty presentation, too. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was good but next time I think I would serve it warm, perhaps with ice cream.

I've been making this recipe since it was published in 1990 - the presentation in the magazine is the way I do it - the pears standing upright in a straight sided glass bowl - looks beautiful. I've made two changes recently - I've been coring the pears with a melon baller (much nicer to eat) and have been adding dried apricots to the pears during baking. Very nice.

A very nice fruit desert. However, the presentation was not impressive. I threw some raspberries around the pears to make it prettier, but this wasn't an ideal solution. The flavors were good.

I made these pears for Thanksgiving. Everyone wanted to know if they were an old family recipe. They were Wonderful! Everyone wanted the Recipe and they were so easy to make.
