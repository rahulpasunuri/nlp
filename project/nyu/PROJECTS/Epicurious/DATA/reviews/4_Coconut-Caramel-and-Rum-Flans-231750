Super easy to make and great flavor. I was only sorry to have to wait a couple of hours to chill 'em!

This came out rich and silky smooth. It was a hit at the party I brought it to. Super easy to make too!

This was absolutely devine. You were right about it taking longer to cook, just had to keep checking. Would definitely make it over and over.

I made this last week as the finishing touch for a spanish/tapas dinner party. It was a huge hit! My friend's wife just called me for the recipe, since she loved it so much! I baked it in a pie dish and topped it with the leftover caramel sauce. No one thought it was too sweet.

absolutely great the crowd loved the rum and coconut tastes

I made my own dulce de leche which i incorporated into the flan (instead of the caramel). I also cooked it a bit longer which made the custard more dense. The contrast of the silky flan with the toasted coconut is wonderful! My guests thought i should open a patisserie after tasting it!

This was a nice flan, but was VERY sweet. This is even after omitting all caramel (I was out of it)! However, I added a touch more rum to make up for the loss of caramel flavor and that turned out nicely. The consistency was fine; this was served at room temperature. Took slightly longer to cook. Also, I threw in some pieces of coconut to provide a surprising chewiness to the flan and some extra flavor. That was very nice!

Coconut lovers will delight in this creamy, smooth concotion bursting with intense coconut flavor. Do not omit the toasted coconut topping. I accidentally used 1/4. c caramel sauce for half the recipe. I needed to use 1/2 can of cream of coconut so omitted the sugar; the caramel and cream of coconut have plenty of sugar. The result was lip-smacking good. Any liqueur could be substituted for the rum. I used Triple Sec successfully. This will be my standard flan recipe. It's the best I've ever made.

Had a dinner party for 4, recipe only made 6 so there was a fight over the extra 2 ! Really easy recipe with fantastic results. Don't skip the toasted coconut sprinkled on the top.

Excellent! Made exactly as written, turned out perfect. It was a surprise hit. Served for a dinner party to rave reviews. My husband declared it the best flan he's ever eaten.

This dessert was so delicious that my husband has prohibited me from making it too often. I make a flan that everyone raves about and this recipe will soon replace it. It's very easy and very delicious!

Great texture. Since not everyone in my family likes coconut I was glad that it was a very mild taste. I did not have dark rum so I used coconut flavored rum and topped with whipped cream and toasted coconut. Very Good.

It was super easy and addictive. The first day, I thought it was somewhat too sweet compared to the creme brulees that I normally make. A day later, I couldn't get enough of it.

Simple and delicious. Since I can't have lactose, I made this with lactose-free milk and added extra egg yolks. It still came out with a wonderful texture and the flavor is wonderful.

Absolute perfection...even with light coconut milk. It is a very refreshing desert even after a heavier meal...no one leaves any flan in the ramekin.

Delicious! We made this as a creme brulee. Be sure to strain the custard before pouring it into the cups; that will keep the texture smooth. Also, we recommend dulce de leche instead of caramel for a richer flavor

A delicious flan recipe; we enjoyed this as a creme brulee. After mixing ingredients, strain before pouring into cups for smoother texture, and use a spoon to spoon off any bubbles on the surface. Used dulce de leche instead of caramel sauce -- I recommend this for more authentic flavor.
