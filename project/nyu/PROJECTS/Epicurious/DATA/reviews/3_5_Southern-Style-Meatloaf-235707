Awesome, easy recipe!!!! Although I didn't use the entire pound of bacon, wasn't enough room! So I just covered the meatloaf! Delicious!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, except left out the bacon. It was still swimming in fat, not all that tasty, and I will likely will look for another recipe. I was happy I didnt have company for dinner.

this was very quick and easy to make. i only used 4 slices of bacon and it was sitting in a lot of grease, so when i took it out of the oven i transfered it to another plate. the flavor was nice.

I think this was a very good recipe, and my guess loved it. I kept the igredients exactly the same. The only different thing I did was to place the loaf on some foil with holes in it, on a chicken roasting rack to let the fat drain off.

It WAS swimming in grease, however after draining all the grease (as I have to do with any meatloaf) the meatloaf was absolutely wonderful. I don't care for meatloaf, but this was the best I have ever tasted. I can't wait to try it on my meatloaf loving friends.

No one ate it! too greasy, and slimy, and no taste at all. five slices of bacon and the whole thing was floating in grease. forrget about the 1lb of bacon!!!!

I just saw Miss Crawford make this on Epicurious (the television show) and she used a stand up grater for the onion, creating almost an onion foam.

It says "coarsely grated"

You made an error. The recipe calls for finly grated onion not "coarsly ground"
