Don't use 3 cans of beans. I only used two and the whole thing tastes like beans. Yes, puree everything and I used half a pack of bacon and some deli-type sliced chorizo-this needs more flavor or it tastes bean-pasty. Some crumbled sausage in this would be awesome.

You really have to puree the entire soup, I think, don't you? Maybe mash it up as anothe user suggested. But a nice, flavorful soup nonetheless.

Ironically, my husband wanted butternut squash soup, but once I altered this recipe he was interested in the squash no more. Unlike other reviews we doubled the fat by adding 2 chicken sausages and specialty hot dry aged smoked paprika salami. Caramelized onions and deglazed as suggested but with red wine and allowed stock to condense a bit before adding back in the proteins. Never blended the beans. . . Frankly because I made a mistake reading the recipe - what a great mistake it was. Bottom line, this is a fun recipe to experiment with and add your favorite flavors. Added the squash despite husbands protests - it was a hit!

My husband loved the soup, despite hating squash. Like the others, I made a few alterations. Roasting the squash first gives it more robust flavor. Rinse and drain the beans; you can make up the liquid with more chicken broth. I added Italian seasoning and a bay leaf with the rosemary. I also used a potato masher to make the soup more "rustic." I added a little cayenne pepper to give it a kick.

A lovely soup perfect for a crisp autumn or cold winter night. I pureed the entire thing (except the bacon) so it was totally smooth and liked that texture than I would have if it were chunky. Added the bacon at the very end. I took the suggestion of red pepper flakes; I added a bit too much so it was too spicy for my palate, but this turned out to be a fortunate error when I discovered a swirl of sour cream not only reduced the heat of the pepper but also added a lovely creaminess to the dish.

Continued from below: only use 2 cans of beans... lots of rosemary and don;t puree the soup at all, after all one of the cans of beans is pureed already, which gives the soup heft, leave some whole beans and the butternut intact!

Recipe is a good idea in concept, execution is poor. Use fresh tomatoes and add them after cooking onions to the transluscent stage. Drain and thoroughy rinse beans. Roast butternut squash and add at the last minute. Add a little red pepper....

I made a little extra work for myself by peeling and cubing the squash, then roasting it til golden and crispy. Used only 2 cans of beans, left the bacon in the soup and used an immersion blender like others suggested. I also used extra rosemary and didn't find I needed more salt, even though I'm a "salt person". Great depth of flavor resulted.

A favorite soup in our house. It was delicious and easy in the original form, but like many other reviewers, I made a few changes the next few times I made it. To cut down on fat/calories, I used organic turkey bacon fried in a little olive oil, roasted the squash, added extra fresh ground pepper and a generous tsp. of curry powder while cooking the onions and garlic, and mixed the turkey bacon in the soup before serving. A dollop of yogurt adds a nice contrast to the hot soup.

We love this recipe. I make it with just a few minor variations: 1) we roast the squash first, 2) we drain all the beans to cut down on sodium, and 3) we don't puree separately - we just blend it all with an immersion blender. We garnish with the bacon, a little low-fat sour cream, and chives. Yum.

Rating: 4
This is a delicious recipe, but it does require a bit of aggressiveness when it comes to seasoning. Because of the high quantity of beans, you must put in a substantial amount (translation -- a lot) of both salt and pepper. And, since I like a bit of a kick in my soup, I also added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce. This made the soup flavorful, but not too spicy (once again because of the quantity of beans). The family literally raved about this one. Next time I make this soup I may throw in some smoked sausage. Excellent soup. Just be aggressive on seasoning.

This soup has been made twice now. The second time for company...again, the recipe was requested. The changes I made were... Kept the bacon in the soup but made an extra 10 pieces to garnish when serving. I used a can of traditional Rotel for some spice instead of plain diced toms and used Cilantro instead of the rosemarry. Speeding up the process, I used Trader Joes pre-cut container of cubed fresh squash (2 of them) I also scooped out the large chuncks of squash once the soup was done cooking and pureed in my blender and returned to the soup. Topped with sour cream, fresh cilantro and bacon before serving!

First of all, I roasted the squash for 30 minutes on an olive oil coated baking sheet to make it easier to separate from the skin. I added fresh basil, lots of salt and 1/4 tsp curry powder. You can do more curry and it wouldn't be overpowering. I pureed the soup, which I highly recommend! It came out smooth and creamy. Delicious for dipping french bread in, too!

I made this recipe exactly. It was delicious!

used ingredients as listed - only changes were: sauted bacon and onion together and left bacon in the soup; roasted squash and garlic (as suggested by another reader) and pureed about 1/4 of squash with beans. Also - the tomatoes I used were roasted with garlic. This was good - I think that leaving the bacon in, roasting the squash and garlic and having the roasted garlic style of tomatos added a bit more depth to the soup. Could see making a few alterations (pancetta, or - as my husband suggested - adding leftover roasted chicken) depending on what I had in the house. This is a keeper, however, as is!

So easy to make small changes to the amount of different ingredients and have a different soup each time. I like to use my own tomatoes and squash (fresh from garden) to make this.

Good soup, but wasn't wowed. I only added one can of beans (which was enough for me). I pureed all of the soup and I liked the nice thick texture. However, I think next time I will take the suggestions of other reviewers and add more spice, preferably curry.

Splendid autumnal supper, with a few crucial alterations: add a dash of nutmeg and copious salt, and use an immersion blender to puree most of the soup into a velvety porridge. Serve with a dollop of sour cream or creme fraiche, and garnish with bacon and chives. Even my soup and squash averse husband helped himself to seconds and said it was filling.

My husband and I loved this recipe. In addition to the recipe here, I added a couple of cubes of chicken boullion, some brown rice, and diced roasted chicken(at the end so it didn't overcook). Yummy!

Surprisingly good. I substituted RoTel and tomato paste for the tomatoes, and I really liked the extra spiciness.

Wow- so easy and so flavorful! I pretty much altered the recipe according to what I had available and it was wonderful. I did half butternut and half acorn squash, and only used one can of beans. I also added a bit of white wine and- this is probably the secret- about a half a small onion's worth of caramelized onion. I substituted leek for the onion. I even left the bacon out and it still tasted fantastic!

After reading some of the rave reviews for this soup, I made it in order to use up a squash given to me. I followed the recipe to the letter and thought the end result was very bland. I salvaged it by pureeing the entire soup, and adding curry, ginger and honey. I would not make it again.

This soup is excelllent as is. However, I made it a second time and changed a few ingredients. I increased the butternut squash to 8 cups, coated it slightly with olive oil and roasted it for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. I used only 2 cans of the beans. I pureed 4 cups of the squash with one can of the beans and added this to the soup. To enhance the flavor more, I added 1 teaspoon of minced fresh ginger. To thin the soup slightly, I added about half a cup of half and half cream.

I made this with 3 different cans of beans to clear out my pantry (great northern, cannellini, and navy bean). I thought it was pretty darn tasty! Added pepper for some spice, but other than that, very yummy!

made this the vegetarin way. no bacon grease. olive oil to saute veggies. added carrots and celery. used veggie stock. drained beans and used white wine to supplement the liquid lost in draining. roasted the squash before adding to soup. puree the whole thing. drizzled with chive oil and toasted some pepitas for garnish. delicious and vegan!

Rating: 3
I split and roasted the squash at 375 for 40 minutes. I had a can of navy beans and a can of cannellini, so I pureed the navy beans with the roast squash and added the cannellini whole for texture. Like others, I added extra spices, using savory, cumin and curry in addition to fresh rosemary. Really a great soup, especially on a chilly day when you're suffering from a bad cold.

This was a fabulous soup! Not only was it very easy to make, but it was the perfect hearty supper for a cool Fall evening. I followed the recipe as it is stated, however....I decided to puree all the ingredients. I love a thick, smooth soup and that was perfect! I will definitely make this soup again.

Rating: 3
Yum! I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! I added the beans after pureeing the rest of the soup because my kids don't like soups that are completely smooth. I left out the tomatoes -- simply because I forgot -- but added a dash of lemon juice to cut the sweetness of the squash. It was very very tasty.

Rating: 4
This was so delicious, and healthy! I added a little more bacon and put it in the soup to simmer instead of using it as a garnish. I also added more chicken broth (about 1 c. while making it and 1/2 c. the next day, after it had thickened somewhat overnight). I think sauteeing the onion and garlic in the bacon fat really adds to the flavor of the soup. A great winter meal, which goes excellently with ciabatta bread (esp. if it has rosemary in it!).

I used this as a base along with a couple of others on the site. The primary tweaks were, roasted squash, an extra slice of bacon, shallot instead of onion and 2 cans of cannellini. For a bit extra I added ginger to shallots, and added pinches of allspice, nutmeg, cayenne along with hearty applications of salt and pepper. It was really amazing and came together perfectly. Used an immersion blender and b/c I pureed it early, it splattered (like lava) so I would suggest doing it as a very late step.

I've made this soup twice, once with prosciutto as one cook suggested and once with no meat at all. I prefer eating close to vegetarian and found that a large dollop of Vegemite (the Australian yeast extract) made a satisfying substitute for the meat. Miso might be good as well. I used only two cans of beans, one drained and one undrained. And I saved a lot of time by buying pre-cut butternut squash at Trader Joe's. I microwaved it for a few minutes, then roasted it with six cloves of garlic before adding everything to the pot. A stick (immersion) blender made quick work of the pureeing step. I omitted tomatoes and added chopped mixed greens (chard, kale, collard) for color and texture. I didn't alter the seasoning and liked the results just fine (I think roasting the garlic, and using a lot of it, helps), but in the spirit of experimentation I also tried adding a couple squirts of Vietnamese hot sauce (the red stuff with the rooster on the label). Not bad. Croutons or toasted pumpkin seeds might make a nice garnish. I think I'll try them next time...and there WILL be a next time.

After reading the reviews, I made this soup by roasting the squash (started for 10 minutes in the microwave) and roasting the garlic, substituted 1 cup of white wine for 1 cup of the chicken broth, omitted the tomatoes and added a carrot then pureed 1/2 of the soup. I have to say it was delicious and look forward to making it again on a cold day.

This was OK. But I found myself adding all sorts of things to make it taste better. I added cayenne, cumin, cinnamon, sugar, a little cream, all to give it a bolder flavor. I also pureed half of it because I didn't like the idea of lots of large chunks of butternut squash. Maybe I am just used to creamier, smoother squash soups. But if you make this one, be prepared for a chunky, brothy soup without much of a kick.

This soup was great. My seven year old, who hates squash, ate two bowls of it. I used only one can of beans because my squash was enormous. I roasted the squash and garlic, used pancetta and added the carrot and celery. I also toasted the seeds and used them as a garnish along with the bacon. I will definitely make this again

Delicious! I made it like the cook from Simi Valley except I used white wine instead of vermouth and 3oz pancetta instead of prosciutto. WOW. I've made several versions of squash soup, and I was surprised at how tasty the tomatoes were in it. I did start the quartered butternut squash in the micro for 10min to cut down on the roasting time and used roasted garlic as well.

After making this recipe tonight for company (who immediately asked for the recipe), taking into account suggestions from other reviewers, I'll be adding this four-forker into my regular cool-weather menu. I substituted prosciutto for the bacon, adding it after carmelizing the onion and garlic, then deglazing with a splash of vermouth (I also substituted a cup of vermouth for part of the broth); that's when I put in the carrot and celery others suggested, along with some collard greens. I roughly blended all of the squash before adding (so there were still a few squashy chunks), and only used two cans of beans, pureeing one of them. I also added a small can of corn and, sans the cayenne some suggested, some tabasco sauce, which gave it that little something that seemed to be missing until then. I only let it simmer for about an hour or so before dinner, but my mom was sure I'd been slow-cooking it all day and was shocked to hear the beans were from a can. The mother approval rating, along with my friend walking out the front door with the Epicurious printout in hand, make this recipe the first I'll turn to when I'm looking for a solid soup dinner on a rainy day.

I added butternut squash puree (from William's Sonoma) the first time and not the second time. It is even better with the added puree, but either way, it is a great fall soup.

I agree with many of the other posts- the bare bones of the recipe are good, but it lacks a certain oomph. There's a nice balance better sweet and sour elements. But it's great, bc I can adjust it to different tastes and occassions. DEFINITLY roast the squash AND the garlic ( is there anything not improved by roast garlic?), I agree the tomato is not as good, and only two cans of beans. i added a Tablespoon of Curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, and celery. Add them before the broth (2cups and one of wine), so they can cook a bit. I also pureed the entire pot- it just seemed like a soup that aught to be smooth. A Beautiful color, and definitly a good filling soup.

Wow! I've only had this recipe for for three weeks and have already made it 4 times for various occasions. Everyone, including people who have never had butternut squash before loves it! I'm busily giving out the resipe. I can't wait to make it again.

I made this soup with about 4 oz. pancetta instead of bacon, and left it in the pot with the other ingredients. I can't imagine the soup now with bacon, as the pancetta was just perfect: not too greasy, not too salty. I added a can of white corn and some celery and didn't change a thing on the spices -- though next time I'll try sage instead of rosemary just for something different. It is a wonderful, simple, hearty soup, and my husband and I absolutely loved it. It made enough that I was able to freeze some for later.

Excellent, smooth, and satisfying (and healthy, too!) I roasted the squash before chopping and adding to the soup. I also pureed about half the soup with an immersion blender after cooking. I will definitely make it again, however next time I might play around with the spices/seasonings a bit to jazz up the flavor.

Loved it! Definitely use the bacon grease, but feel free to omit the crumbled bacon garnish-- I feel it overpowers the soup's lovely flavor. I also feel the soup benefits from pureeing about 1 1/2 cups of the cooked squash and liquid and adding the puree back into the soup for a thicker consistency.

This was pretty tasty. I followed other reviewers' suggestions to use pre-cut squash, roast it, and add some carrot and celery. Also, I used only two cans of beans, and drained and rinsed them because I feel that the liquid in canned beans is disgusting. And I substituted a cup of white wine that was hanging around the fridge for some of the broth. And used dried rosemary instead of fresh. And pureed about half of the finished soup instead of pureeing the beans. Okay, maybe it was almost a whole different recipe by that time, but it's SOUP. It smelled divine--better than it tasted--but it tasted good enough. I'm sure doubling the bacon would make it better, but I heroically resisted that.

I tried this soup this weekend. It was delicious. I read some other reviews and agree that roasting the squash would give a better taste.

What a wonderful lunch!!!!!!

This is a very filling, very satisfyng dish. I think the cubes of squash should be smaller, but other than that, it is delicious. IT MUST BE REFRIGERATED FOR 24 HOURS BEFORE SERVING for the best flavor. And it is easy. Makes you look like you spent days preparing.

I will definately make this again but,with changes I have made. On the first try of this soup I followed exactly as the recipe stated ( a rule of thumb) and after tasting also thought it was lacking something; being too bland for my taste. The second try (I don't give up easily when I think there are possibilities ), I added 1 stalk of finely diced celery, 1 carrot finely diced (for sweetness), 1 sweet potato, peeled and finely diced, 1 cup of frozen whole kernel corn, 1 teas. cumin, 1 teas. pepper and 1 teas. Spike. I reduced the Cannellini to 2 cans. I simmered all together then removed 1/2 of the mixture and used a potato masher instead of the food processor to give a chunkier texture. I found this is one of those soups that tasts best the following day. I plan to make this great soup ( with the above changes ) again soon. My next attempt I plan to reduce the sodium by use of fresh tomatoes and beans I have cooked myself. The bacon stays!! This is now a keeper!!!
