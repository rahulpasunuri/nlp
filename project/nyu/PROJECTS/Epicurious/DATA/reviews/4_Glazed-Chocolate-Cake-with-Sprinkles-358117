totally awesome, moist, flavorful. I wanted a chocolate pound cake recipe that wasn't dry, and while the texture of this cake is not quite as dense as pound cake, it is close enough. I made the cake in a loaf pan, used about half the icing (which is not too sweet - fits the cake wonderfully), and it is now my new goto dessert recipe. Very easy too.

I made this cake without the glazing, and it was so good! the cake was moist and perfect for an everyday chocolate cake!

This recipes makes a very moist cake with a rich glaze. It all comes down to the ingredients you use, make sure to use fine quality chocolate and you will get the best result :) Visit my blog for full review and photos http://fridayswithcoco.blogspot.com

It was pretty good. The cake had a good texture and, as other people have said, is quite moist. I put toasted almonds on instead of sprinkles (like a previous reviewer did), which I think are prettier. They worked pretty well.

Great recipe, the cake is delicious and not too sweet. I didn't add any sprinkles. I was asked for the recipe by 2 guests.

Absolutely delicious! Super moist layer, wonderful glaze, this recipe is a definite keeper! Baked the layer two weeks ago to use up some sour 2% milk. Froze the cake without the glaze as an "emergency dessert." Defrosted the layer two days ago and glazed it yesterday, several hours before my grand-daughter and her fiance arrived for dinner. Instead of sprinkles (don't like them--too gritty), I covered the glaze with freshly toasted sliced almonds. Good, but next time I'll use coarsely chopped pecans, toasted. Used Ghiardelli cocoa for cake and a 4oz. bar of Ghiardelli 60% bittersweet chocolate for the glaze. My guests loved this cake! Me too... Our thanks to Lillian Chou and Epicurious.

This cake is incredibly moist, and the glaze is so simple and delicious. I sprinkled the top with a little crushed candy cane -- it added a nice holiday touch and a wonderful hint of peppermint. This will be my go to chocolate cake from now on.

After my chocolate dessert failed this wonderful little moist, tender chocolate cake was my savior for Christmas Eve dinner. I made it the night before (at 11:00)then prepared and spread the glaze over the cake the next day. Served with raspberry sauce that had been prepared for the first dessert, decorated with fresh raspberries and mint. A lovely presentation and no one knew this was dinner's savior
