We make this recipe a lot, and I have found that I prefer the texture of the coconut as it is dried, without the soak. We use hericot verts and I steam the beans and then simply toss them in the oil mixture.

Loved this recipe. Used fresh red jalapenos instead of dried (any fresh hot pepper would be good). Added a touch of garam masala while sauteing black mustard seed and peppers. This is a keeper.

Perhaps I should add that the spices are NOT substitutable! You will have to find an Indian grocery (a lot easier now that a few years ago) for the dessicated coconut and the mustard seed.

Pretty good recipe for this dish, which is a standard of Indian cooking. The bay leaf is a little odd, and you could certainly add something additional like ground coriander or a touch of turmeric (careful...too much and it turns into "Bubba's Curry Special"). Easy to prepare even with the par-boiled green beans.

Easy to make, powerfully flavored, great for less-than-perfect beans. My grated coconut must have been quite dry, because an hour was not enough to absorb the water or quite soften. Next time, I'll use hot water.
