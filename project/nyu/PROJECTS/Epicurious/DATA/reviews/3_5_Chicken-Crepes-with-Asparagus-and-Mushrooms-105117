Another divine chicken comfort dish to add to my collection. Made in accordance with recipe, very slowly poaching chicken breast in homemade stock and breaking apart into bite size pieces. Used a smooth cream sherry and added slightly more to balance. Beautiful rich soft and delicate flavour. I did season gently with salt and pepper at the end. Add a few other vegies and it would also make a good pie or volovant filling. Crepes are easy, and I sprinkled the finishing sauce with a little parsley and lemon zest. Lovely!

This is an excellent recipe for using up leftover Thanksgiving turkey. The only thing I would change would be to add more salt to the filling.

I added lemon to the topping. That made it just perfect. Great recipe. Delicious.

Tasty dish however would use salted butter for filling & topping. I typically don't use a lot of salt but this recipe was very bland & ended up having to put a salt shaker on the table which many guests used. Topping by my standards didn't add much to this dish except calories. Next time I will improvise on the topping. Overall my guests enjoyed the crepes. Lots of prep time needed. I made the crepes & filling the night before.

Delicious!! I didn't have mushrooms but it still turned out really good. I also added a little more sherry and broth than it called for and the sauce was perfect. The crepe recipe is also really simple and a great go-to recipe for something different. I am definitely making this again!

I had to convert this into a gluten-free dish, but it worked wonderfully! I adapted part of a 1973 recipe for the finish, changing the topping sauce a bit and baking with grated Swiss cheese. I also had to substitute for the sherry with what I had on hand: white wine and B&B. I feel like I should have added more than 3 Tbs. to balance the flavors better.

This is an exceedingly delicious and fairly simple recipe. While prep time is involved and I wouldn't say it's a particularly quick recipe, I don't think it's difficult to pull together, either. I had never made crepes before and was amazed at how simple they were, even using cooking oil spray and a plain sautée pan. Since I had to cook the chicken to use for the recipe, it took me longer than it might. I also skipped the topping at the end and simply topped it with some left over velouté sauce, parmesan cheese and the asparagus spears before broiling. This would be a great recipe if you were using leftovers--leftover meat, leftover and already-cookde vegetables, etc. Then the most laborious part of the process would be cooking the velouté sauce and making the crepes. In that respect I think this could be a very versatile and useful recipe.

Loved this rich elegant dish. I skipped the asparagus, added some grated Emmenthal to the sauce and used shiitaki mushrooms. Topped the crepes in the oven with some more Emmenthal for the last 5 minutes and served with a green salad. Didn't take as long as it says to make but it does use a lot of dishes--but I was able to clean everything up while the crepes were in the oven. Definitely worth the effort.

This is good but the topping/sauce was a bust. Needs a different sauce and then would be a great recipe for a light meal. For half the recipe, I used 3 large cremini mushrooms and 8 ounces (before cooking) chicken, both more than the recipe called for and it made a heartier filling. I used skim milk in the crepes and that worked fine. A Cheese or mushroom sauce might be a good sauce/topping. I served this with Quinoa, Artichoke and Hearts of Palm Salad from Food and Wine.

Tasty, but holy prep time. The sauce was not the healthiest ever, so I will save it for special occasions.

Takes a little time, but very good. I need to add milk to crepe batter until it was runny enough to spread correctly. Also, I added smoked gouda cheese inside of the crepe when I assembled. I didnt bother with the topping because I didnt want to wash the blender. Served the crepe with a nice salad and it was great!

I thought this was fantastic, as did my guests. I only had time to prepare the chicken ahead of time but depite that this recipe wasn't nearly as time-consuming or labor-intensive as some of the reviews make it sound. My changes were as follows: I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts and definitely ended up with more than two cups of chicken so my crepes were a little hearty. I left out the sherry since I didn't have any medium-dry on hand. I also prepared the asparagus in the way I most prefer it: I steamed it in the microwave in about 2 tbsp of water. I don't like how quickly it can get mushy in a pot/pan and I've got microwaving it down pat, so that's what I did. The crepes were beautiful and didn't feel as heavy as they are. The recipe seems to lend itself to interpretation rather well, so I intend to make these again with more vegetables and less fat.

This recipe is fabulous. It does take some work but it is well worth it! I didn't find asparagus so I replaced with mushrooms, I also added a bit f chopped green peppers (because I love the taste) and omitted the sherry and it came out delicious!

Somewhat time consuming, but I made everythng but the crepes a day ahead. Everyone asked for seconds, and there wasn't a bit left. Great during the colder months.

Very tasty, great for a casual dinner or even brunch. It wasn't asparagus time in my region, so I left out the asparagus and tripled the mushrooms, which was nice for cold weather. I would prefer a more traditional crepe batter which rests before cooking. This batter was a little tough.

Great make-ahead and use-up-leftovers dish! I had leftover veloute, chicken, and crepes (all great out of the freezer). Loved that the asparagus kept its crunch. Given previous reviews, I was careful not to make things too saucy. I did have a little trouble with the topping, which didn't come together as described. After 10 min in the oven, I scooped it back on top of the crepes so that it would brown a bit.

Some find this bland. So...use 1/2 milk, 1/2 white wine and add some finely chopped onion (or green ones) and 1 tbsp. chopped tarragon- of course the best thing of all GARLIC. Will be fantastic then.

Interesting... Everyone either loved it or hated it. I found it to be a waste of ingredients and time. For so much work, I expected something less bland. However, I do like the idea of incorporating crepes and a saucy filling.

I love this recipe. However, I made it twice - once with sherry, once without, and I have to say I like the one without better. The sherry overpowers the simple richness of the sauce. It's tasty either way though.

Takes a long time to make, but the effort is worth it. Next time I will try to add a little more flavoring to the filling and go a little lighter on the sauce both inside and out.

I made this recipe for a party I catered. Easy to make in advance and reheat in the oven with out the sauce. Reheated sauce in the microwave and laddled over the top to serve. Tip: Boil chicken thighs in water. They are cheaper and more flavorful than breast. Save the water and use it as your "stock" for this recipe.

It is time consuming and labor intensive, but very delicious. I will make this dish over two days next time.

YUM! I made this for a Mother's Day brunch that I hosted, and everyone loved it! I made a few small changes, like using broccoli instead of asparagus, added a clove of chopped garlic to the sauce and cooked the crepes a few seconds longer to make sure they wouldn't fall apart. The down side is that it is VERY LABOR INTENSIVE! By the time I finished, it was closer to 3 1/2 hours. It was worth it, though.

Terrific for a "special" dinner. Would definitely make in advance. I thought the crepe recipe was great although my crepe pan is larger so I made fewer crepes.

I make this recipe with salmon instead of chicken (I also use veggie stock instead of chicken stock, because I keep kosher) and everyone loves it. I brush the salmon with a little olive oil and broil it, then add it to the veloute. It works really well on a brunch buffet, especially if you leave off the topping (less messy). I fill the crepes the day before, and then just pop them in the oven the morning of the brunch. The crepe recipe itself is terrible - I tried it once, and the crepes didn't hold together well at all, so I use the basic recipe from a crepe cookbook instead.

If you are looking for an easier way to combine these wonderful flavors without so much work, here is my recommendation: Stuff your crepes with cooked Chopped Chicken breast, boiled asparagus, and sautéed portabellas and then top the crepes with a can of cream of mushroom soup. You can dilute the soup for a rich flavor with either milk, cream or even water. About 1/2 cup. The Easy Crepe Recipe from Bon Appetit, June 1998 is winner every time. Put the crepes in the oven on 350 until warm and top the crepes just before serving with the mushroom soup mixture. Viola!!!

The sauce for the filling tastes like basic white cream sauce and did not make this dish worth the effort. The crepe receipe was too thin and too difficult to make work. The over all taste of the completed dish tasted like a basic chicken salad and made it into a complicated, over rated, disappointing dish.

I knew going in that this would be a lot of work, and it sure was. It took me about 2 1/2 hours, start to finish, but the end result was very nice. My nine year old (who is the pickiest eater on the planet) told me that it tasted like my chicken pot pie and inhaled the whole thing. I should take it as a complement as she adores my chicken pot pie, but I make that with canned cream of mushroom soup, not veloute that I've stirred for 25 minutes! Next time, I will definately make it in two steps over two days so the work isn't in one lump, but I have to say, I was expecting something a little better than my chicken pot pie :) Maybe substitute chicken for lump crab for a more decadent filling.

3.5 forks. I didn't have sherry on hand so i substituted .5 tsp yellow mustard. i know it sounds unusual but it really works. I used chives in the crepe batter, and found it exceptional. yum yum

This recipe was very good. The taste was wonderful. The only down side was the time involved. This was not a eat and run recipe. The presentation on the plate was great. I served this with the recipe of asparagus and bibbed lettuce from your site.

The key to this dish was preparing crepes and filling the day before. Not sure if the sauce over the top at the end worked - I found it difficult to get right as I wasn't sure how to broil the crepes with the suace over the top but it tasted superb and my guests thought it was fantastic.

Very unremarkable dish, especially for the effort. I expected more assertiveness or distinction. I would not make this dish again.

I made this recipe without chicken and it was still awesome! As I am vegetarian, I also substituted vegetable broth for chicken. I used store bought crepes for conveneience and added 2 cloves of minced garlic along with the shallots. Yum! My only problem was I was completely unable to remove all the baked crepes from the baking dish in one perfect piece. Even so, this recipe is definitely a keeper. I can't wait to try it with shrimp.

Excellent recipe and authentic tasting if you are looking for a French recipe. The velouté sauce is buttery with an extra depth of flavour by adding in the alcohol at the end (I used Brandy to rave reviews)!

We loved this dish. It's easy but time consuming -- making it over two days made it a little easier to handle, though. I only had uncooked chicken and much prefer the flavor of asparagus when it's roasted, so I prepared both the chicken and the asparagus using this method. We were out of sherry, so I substituted white wine (had an open bottle from the night before!); otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It's been several years since I've made crepes, and I messed up a few so I ended up making two batches of batter. Once I got going, it was a breeze making them, though.

I thought the dish crepes and filling were delicious. I added snipped chives to the crepe batter for a little color. Only got 8 crepes out of the batter recipe, using a 7-inch crepe pan. Would omit the topping next time. A little reserved sauce on top with more snipped chives, and the asparagus tips would do just as well, if not better. I poached 1 9-ounce chicken breast in a little salt water, with some peppercorns, and fresh thyme, then shredded the meat for the filling. I suggest seasoning along the way, if you want a really flavorful filling.

Not only did this recipe require a lot of time, but a lot of pots/pans....thank heaven my husband washed as I cooked. However, this dish was so delicious - it was worth all the work. Served with wild rice and great salad - my husgand and our guests thought I was the worlds best cook! - thanks epicurious!

Although I enjoy challenging recipes, the results were not worth the effort. Too many prep steps with multiple bowls of ingredients that required lots of countertop space for assembly. Not a keeper.

I thought this was bland - like chicken a la king in a crepe. I would make it agin with several changes, only because everyone else thought it was good. I am going to try a bernaise sauce instead of the one in the recipe - it needs some zip, like dijon or cayenne and some spices. I added toasted almonds for some crunch. I also doubled the crepe batter because of other reviewers comments. Since I ruined the first couple, I would suggest others try this if you haven't had much experience with crepes.

I couldn't beleive this recipe could actually take over two hours to prepare. But...it did. I am a quick cook and thought I could do it in much less time. I was wrong. However, it was worth it. An employee with a Christmas season birthday had requested crepes for her office lunch party. I found this recipe here and thought it sounded like just waht she was looking for. I had a Christmas-gift turkey to cook, so I cooked it the night before with a typical Thanksgiving recipe and used that cooked turkey in the crepes. I thought it was a great way to use up leftover turkey. No one would ever know it was "leftovers". I will make these again--I'll just plan more time. :) My office team loved them! I served them with a salad, store-bought rolls and the Cranberry and Pumpkin Spice Tea Cake (which I beleive is misnamed, it gives you a differnt perception than this lovely, light cake is). It was a perfect luncheon menu.

Delicious but not extraordinary. Takes a LOT of works. I only used butter when making the roux, subsituting with olive oil for the rest of the recipes, didn't miss a thing. Only got 13 crepes out of the batter. Substituted Sherry with Pernod, nice touch of herbs.

I guess I'm the exception with respect to this recipe. Neither my husband nor I were crazy about the crepes. Both of us said -- at the same time, no less -- that they were just too rich. I felt kind of icky after having two. They were not bad...just not great. I would not make these again. (I got 13 crepes out of the batter as well.)

This was great, time consuming but well worth it. I was only able to make 10 crepes, I didn't make the topping at all, and they turned out great without it. They were great left over as well.

Excellent! Time-consuming, but not difficult. I added extra mushrooms--yummy.

yes, this is VERY labour intensive but worth it, i think. only 13 crepes came out of the batter so there is left-over filling. the "topping" was a mystery, however. why beat 3T of cream into soft-peak stage when the mixture melt immediately upon contact with the hot crepes? it instantly became soup beneath the crepes. also, watch the crepes in the oven as they brown very quickly.
