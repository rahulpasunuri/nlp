I too have been making this relish since I first saw it in Gormet. My boyfriend absolutely loves it! I use all poblanos because we like stuff hot, however you can never really tell from the outside of a poblano (also can be called pasilia chilie) if it will be hot or mild. We take our chances and usually arrive at a taste somewhere around a nice spicy green, cilantro-ey taste. Quite delicious atop a well-seasoned burger with some nutty swiss or smoked provolone melted over and a good soft bun. MMMM gotta go, hungry now!
