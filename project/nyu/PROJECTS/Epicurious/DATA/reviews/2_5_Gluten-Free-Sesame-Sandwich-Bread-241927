This is the first GF bread that we've had success with. Nice flavour, nice crust, bread-like texture. So excited to have a sandwich bread that my daughter can eat!

I followed the recipe to a T. It's better than I expected. Now that I know I like it, I'll premix all the flours in batches to cut preparation time. Had it plain with butter, which is my first taste test and toasted with breakfast and it was delicious.

Too much work for a ill person.

one more thing: I used parchment paper instead of buttering the pan. That sounded gross to me.

This was an adventure for me, since I've never baked GF before. I had some different flours to use than the recipe called for, and kind of did my own thing in that realm. I used oat flour too, though I know it's not 100% GF; but I can tolerate it. I think I'll try to look for other flours that don't have that "just licked the health food store floor" taste. I'm not sure which ones those will be. I'll probably take a little from each stash and moisten it to see which one gives the previously described effect. When I was done baking it, I loosely covered it with saran wrap, and that helped keep the crust from drying out. It is also a rather small loaf, but that's to be expected. I think it will make a good ham sandwich. ...Now for the pizza crust...

Being very familiar with gluten free cooking as our daughter has celiac I am going to try this delicious sounding recipe. Warning to others be careful what kind of molasses you use. Pick one that is gluten free. That wheat hides in the weirdest places !
