I made this quiche for our family Mothers Day brunch and it was a hit! Everyone wanted the recipe! The only thing I did differently is substitute the parsley for the oregano and made my own crust.

I used this for a venison party I had. I removed the casings from the venison sausages and substituted them for the sausage called for. It was a huge hit and was part of a group of venison dishes made for the party. This was Minnesota venison served to non venison lovers and sceptical first timers in downtown Chicago. They all loved it!

I have used this recipe time and time again. It's even better by adding carmelized red onion and sauteed mushrooms. I also increase the eggs and use whole milk to replace the cream. The oregano shouldn't be skipped. My husband loves this quiche too.

I love quiche, so I`m always looking for another variation. This is very good! I used 3 whole eggs and 1 c. of 1/2 & 1/2, which is pretty standard for my other quiche recipes. It turned out perfectly! I can not imagine why you would need 2 c. of cream! I prebaked the shell until set (not browned) for 10 min. at 425, put the sausage on the bottom, poured the egg mixture (including the cheese) over the meat, added the tomatoes, baked it for 15 min, reduced the temp. to 325 and baked it for another 30 min. I used a combination of gruyere and parmesan and did not add any salt, as the cheeses provided enough. It couldn`t have been better! We will have the rest for breakfast in the morning!

This quiche had an excellent flavor. It was easy to make and went over very well with everyone I served it to (men and women alike!). I used 2 whole eggs and one yolk. I was able to use all organic ingredients and it was superb! I will surely make again and again.

Made this for Easter brunch. Everyone loved it but it was a little hard to serve and as others have said, very rich. Great presentation though.

My husband LOVED this quiche AND he's a real man! Real men DO eat quiche! I did use the whole egg not just the yok and I added one extra egg and used a quarter cup less of the half and half. It was super light and fluffy and GREAT flavor!

I make it every year for New Year's morning for a pile of friends and family. It's easy to make the night before and very friendly to altering the recipe. I love the crust brushed with dijon mustard as another reviewer recommended. One caveat: it is very, very rich - using three eggs and substituting milk for some of the cream helps a lot and prevents the need for a Lipitor after breakfast!

I made this for a brunch - it was awesome! But I used hot italian turkey sausage and I used a light cream instead of heavy whipping cream. I also did not separate the eggs from the yolk - just 3 eggs. I don't know if it made a difference in texture but everyone at the brunch loved it and asked for the recipe.

Rating: 3
This was so good, but the texture was a little funny. A little too creamy like custard. Don't know if it needed more eggs to firm it up, or the cheese melted too much. Still, it was really very good.

Takes longer to cook than suggested. Still, it's a simple recipe, and tastes great!

I guess it's just me, but I was fairly bored by this one. I like the way the tomato comes out, but otherwise ... blah.

The only change I made to this recipe was to use Sargento's 6 cheese blend insteaad of straight mozzarella. I had brunch for 60 people and made 6 different quiches and this one disappeared first. It was awesome. I make it all the time, to rave reviews every single time and multiple recipe requests!

After reading all the reviews I too made some adaptations to the recipe, specifically, less cream and more cooking time. The result was terrific. Served this as part of our annual Thanksgiving Brunch. Made 2 large quiches and, unfortunately, have no left overs for breakfast.

I made this recipe following a fellow cook from Chico, CA's recommendation - the quiche came out absolutely perfect. I used mozarella on the bottom, and 3/4 c. of gruyere on the top for a different layer of flavor. I also used spicy, Italian chicken sausage. The meal was delicious, the recipe is easy to remember, and the clean up was easy. My boyfriend said that it was the "best quiche" he ever had, and he knows what he's talking about!

Would use less sausage and less cream. I used hot italian sausage and it made it very spicy! Very heavy dish, I would use less whipping cream and more light cream. It did take about twice the amount of time to cook - would follow recommendations of others to up to 350 and cook longer. Very tasty dish served with a salad.

Rating: 3
Good dish but agree with the other reviewers- at the temps specified in this recipe.. you will need to cook it a lot longer than the recipe says. I will try to reduce temp to 350 and hopefully it will cook in the specified time. at 300 deg, it took almost double the time!

This was the first quiche I have ever made -very tasty and quite easy to make, but I did follow the time/temp recommendations from other reviewers. Served it for brunch with herbed potatoes -it was a big hit!

Easy and fabulous! I used 2 chicken-parmesan sausages and a handful of chopped ham instead of the 3 italian sausages. Also 2 whole eggs and 2 yolks. Served it for dinner alongside a green salad, and all 4 adults loved it. Fluffy, perfect & delicious.

We've made this dish several times and it's been an easy hit. I usually use less cream and the entire eggs.

I love this quiche. I put mozzarella at the bottom, then the sausage (4-6), then jack cheese, less liquid (same amt eggs but less cream), then the tomatos and then sprinkle with parmesan. I cook at 350-375 for as long as it needs. Needs less time with less liquid. Yum!

The baking time and temp given in this recipe is all wrong. If you would like this to come out in a somewhat timely manner, try starting it out at 400 degrees for 15 min, then lower temp to 350 for about 45 min longer.

Rating: 3
I was searching for a quick and easy quiche recipe to make with the tomatoes from the garden. I carefully followed the recipe. Somehow I ended up with extra egg/cream filling. The crust ended up too brown because I had to bake the quiche much longer than the reciped stated. What went wrong?

I did not use the recipe here, but made the reviewer from Chico, CA-see 12/2/02 review below- version. It was to die for. My only regret is that I can't save just that recipe to my recipe box. Anybody know how?

AFter reading the various reviews I decided to use the listed ingredients but to follow Julia Child's quiche formula..put egg in measuring cup, fill to 1/2 cup mark with milk, so for 3 eggs you fill to 1 1/2 cups mark..I also used a 6 Italian cheese blend instead of just mozzarella, and baked it at 375 degrees for 35 minutes. There is only a slight textural change and of course not as rich using milk instead of the cream.

Rating: 2
This dish is impossibly rich. I made it as written and also had to bake it considerably longer than the recipe called for. I also found the flavor to be a little bland. Perhaps a stronger flavored cheese would have helped.

Better Version: Brush pre-baked tart shell with 2T dijon mustard. Top with 1/2 c grated mozzarella or gruyere cheese. Add sauted crumbled sausage (1/2c)and sliced onion (1/2 c) that has been well drained.Top with peeled, seeded,thinly sliced tomato arranged in concentric overlapping circles.Make custard with one egg beaten with 1/2c heavy cream.Spoon over tart. Season with salt, pepper, oregano and top with 1/3 c more grated cheese. Bake 375 for 25-30 min.or until custard sets. Let sit before slicing. Serves 6-8

Even cutting the cream to 1 1/2 cups I had to bake the quiche 20 extra minutes before it was set. I added some sundried tomatoes (packed in oil, drained and chopped) which enhanced the flavor. Overall a very rich dish.

Rating: 2
Jury's out on whether I'd make this again...I found it impossibly rich (and that's never scared me away from a recipe before, but this was sort of over the top). As with so many other cooks, I baked this for considerably longer than the recipe called for. It's a pretty little quiche, though.

This is a delicious quiche, but I had problems with it being under done as well. I reduced the cream by a 1/2 cup and it comes out great!

This quiche sounded great, but even though I followed the recipe exactly, the egg/cheese ingredients seemed to separate in the final product. The quiche had a custard-y (almost undercooked) quality on the top, with a heavier cheese layer underneath... not what I had expected.

Even my children loved this quiche. I made it exactly as called for in the recipe and it cooked perfectly in 55 minutes. Definitely a keeper!

Very good and very spicy! (I used bulk sausage, so I may have used too much). My husband loved it. It could be served for breakfast or dinner. PLAN AHEAD - it took much longer to cook than the recipie states. After an hour, I covered it with foil and checked every 15 min until it was set.

Made this receipe along with baked asparagus and yellow peppers, baked french toast,hash brown casserole, baked ham with fruit tray & ceasar salad. Doubled every recipe and not a bite was left. Everyone raved about the food (and so did the cook). I would highly recommend these recipes as everything can be prepared the day before. I felt like a guest at my own brunch.

This was fantastic! I used deep dish pie shells and found that the amount of sausage was enough for two quiches, however the egg/cream mixture was just right for one - so I doubled the egg mixture and made two quiches. It was a good thing we had two quiches, because our guests split the remaining quiche and took it home with them. Hmm...maybe next time I'll make three.

I am NOT a quiche lover but for some reason decided to try this one. I LOVED it as did my guests. I have since made it numerous times and have only changed 2 things...I use fresh basil instead of the dried oregano and this recipe definately makes 2 pies so you need an extra crust. This is always a hit whenever I have served it...VERY flavorful!

Really delicious and rich! I had the same problem as the cooks from Vilnius and Devon, though. The mixture was not even remotely cooked after an hour, so I kept it in for another 20 minutes and still had the perfect quiche consistency.

Rating: 3
This quiche was wonderful! Even so, I have to share two things - one, I had the same problem as the cook from Devon: the quiche took much longer to set than specified in the recipe. Also - be warned that the mozzarella should not be added to a still-hot/warm pie crust because it melts immediately and adds a very chewy consistency to the quiche... This recipe really is good, though! I will (honestly) make this again!

Rating: 3
I loved the way this came out. The flavor was wonderful and it looked pretty. I served it with a green salad with a strong garlic vinagrette. The only problem I experienced was that even after cooking it for an hour on 300, it was still completely liquidy. I ended up having to cook it for about 25 minutes on almost 350 before it would congeal. Did anyone else have this problem? I will definitely make this again.

My husband isn't a quiche fan, but I had all the ingredients on hand and thought it would make an interesting change of pace for dinner. Well, I'm happy to say "He Loved It!" It's a fantastic dinner, lunch, or brunch treat and can be served either hot or cold. The cream makes it really rich and, although I wouldn't recommend the dish as everyday fare (for heart-healthy reasons!), it is a delicious "special occasion" meal!

This quiche was one of the best that I have made! I doubled the recipe though and had way too much for two 8" pies. At any rate, great flavor, and very pleasing to the eye. Next time, I think I will try it in a deep-dish pan.

I made 5 quiches from recipes on your web site for a wedding shower and all of them were wonderful - but this one got the best reviews! It was creamy and full of flavor! I think the egg yolks vs whole eggs made the difference. I used apple/pork sausage instead of Italian because they didn't have sweet Italian at my store and it was wonderful!!

Big, big, hit at my brunch this Sunday. Delicious and did not need to change a thing in the receipe. Very appealing to the eye when serving. Everyone commented on this quiche.

I tried one of the suggestions and used half and half instead of the cream. It didn't hold together very well, so I would only use cream for this recipe. Otherwise, it was quite tasty.

Rating: 4
I used 3-4 Roma tomatoes, better meatier flavor, also, I used hot italian turkey sausage (omitting red pepper) and sprinkled sausage and cheese layer with fresh basil (1/3 cup) and sprinkled the oregano on tomatoes. I found that when you use the packaged finely shredded mozzarella, it melts more evenly. This was a big winner at the office breakfast.

Standard store bought frozen pie shells didn't work for me. I needed to divide the fillings between two pie shells. Perhaps I should have used a deeper pie shell. The taste is good but overly rich with the cream. I think half and half would work better. I would also increase the cheese by 1/2 cup and reduce the cream (or half and half) by the same amount.

I substituted spicy chicken sausage for the Italian sausage--my husband loved it! Also, because there's not as much fat cooking off the chicken sausage as regular sausage, my crust wasn't nearly as soggy. Health-conscious cooks may want to use 1 c. milk and 1 c. cream rather than the full 2 c. of cream, but I found that using cream resulted in a much firmer texture. This is nice with a simple salad and a bottle of wine!
