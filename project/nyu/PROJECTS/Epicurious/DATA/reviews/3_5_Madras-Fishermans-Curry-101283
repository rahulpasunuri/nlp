My 12 yo daughter recently swore off meat (fish is ok). I have been scrambling for a new repertoire of weeknight meals-stuff I can throw together after a full, frantic workday. Easy, fast and fabulous-this one fits the bill. Like the New Zealand cook I cut the fish into chunks and substituted coconut milk. No need for cornstarch if you just watch your liquid amounts (I didn't use the whole cup of water). I used 5 serranos-we like it zingy-Perfect!

Very tasty and not hard to make. Used coconut milk which worked great. Don't use orange roughy though -- it is an endangered fish. I used farmed striped sea bass and it was great (and sustainable). I only had one serrano, but it was a hot one, so the dish did have a kick to it.

The coconut cream is a good change, and although I thought two serranos would be enough, it had little zip to it. I will make it again using at least 4 chilis. Any fish or seafood would be great in this recipe, although the orange roughy was perfectly tender and very nice. I served it with basmati rice -- it was wonderful.

Like others, I added coconut cream instead of coconut. I also overdid the tamarind in mine and initially it was too bitter, but I added a the juice of one orange and that was perfect. I made basmati rice with the tomato dal recpie on this site as side dishes and they were great together.

Would make again, but I thought it needed tweaking. Substituted coconut cream for coconut, used three serrano chiles. Next time, will use more serrano chiles, or a different type of chile, and up the spices. Could definitely have been more spicy. Might add shrimp next time, white fish was a bit too subtle.

Wow... simply delicious! Made this with tilapia fillets, which worked out very well. Also used coconut milk as suggested in prior reviews (thanks!). I will definitely make this again very soon.

fantastic! I substituted coconut cream for fresh coconut, used monk fish which I cut into chunks and coated with tumeric/salt by shaking in a plastic bag. used 3.5 chilies and it wasnt too hot. also thickened the sauce a bit by adding some cornstarch at the end. will definitely make again!

The tamarind gives the dish a delicate, sweet flavor. Very good. I made this using coconut milk, as one other user recommended, and it came out wonderfully. I'd use three or four peppers; as it is, the flavor is good but not quite spicy enough. Also, the recipe is simple and could accomodate added ingredients: I'm thinking of adding roasted eggplant or spinach next time.

very simple, no-fuss delicious recipe.I used salmon steaks instead of orange roughy and coconut milk instead of the grated coconut and water. Absolutely mouth watering!!!! My husband who is somewhat weary of new recipes really enjoyed this one and is asking for more!!!!

The only thing I would do different is to use halibut versus orange roughy. It's not only easier to find but also has a meatier texture which stands up well with the assertive spices.
