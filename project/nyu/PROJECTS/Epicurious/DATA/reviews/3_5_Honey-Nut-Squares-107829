these are really very good. quite messy and not so pretty ( i made them for a rosh hashanah dinner, so i would have liked them to slice prettier, but for flavor they are wonderful). good with any kind of nuts too.

made this with all whole wheat flour and used all walnuts. the whole wheat flour made a nice counterpoint to the richness of the desert--i may add some ground toasted nuts to the crust as well, or maybe sub out some of the flour for cornmeal to add more texture. served as desert for a rosh hashanah dinner and it was well-received--great with wine or coffee. a very classic butter/honey taste that should be widely enjoyed.

Excellent... brought these to a dinner party and they went in a flash. I lined the baking dish with foil, but also topped that with parchment... so removal of the cookie was easy. You MUST let these cool down completely so the caramel hardens. Then remove it from the pan. Otherwise I can see why some people had trouble with cutting into a gooey mess.

The taste: amazing. The presentation: eh. I followed the recipe exactly and everything was looking good until the time came to remove the foil and cut the squares. Though I cooled the pan for hours, it still may have not hardened. The cookie base stuck to the foil, and in trying to remove the sticky honey mess from the foil, the squares were nearly dimantled. Butter your foil WELL. Cool A LONG TIME. Honey is STICKY. Though I woulden't serve to guests, my roomate and I really enjoyed the mess! Yum!

This was pretty easy to make. However, I found that boiling the honey mixture for two minutes was too long (a bit of a burnt taste). Also, I believe any mixture of nuts works fine. I happened to use almonds, pecans and pistachios. Yummy! By preparing the dough in the food processor and pressing it out, I had no problems with a crumby base.

I liked the cookie a lot. Used soy flour instead of all-purpose flour, and the crust came out just as thick as in the picture. Next time I'll bake the crust less and press the nuts into it so they wont' fall off as easily

Can you drizzle chocolate over the top? Has anyone tried? I would like to know what kind of chocolate you used as well. Thanks.

I made this recipe a few days in advance for an upcoming luncheon and half of them had disappeared from my kitchen by the next morning. I substituted macadamia nuts for the hazelnuts because I'm allergic to the latter, and it yielded an intensely satisfying result. Following the suggestion of a previous reviewer I made them in a food processor and they came out looking just like the photograph. Time consuming, but not difficult. Next time I think I'll add a dash of cayenne to the nut mixture, like one does with traditional candied nuts, and put some cinnamon and nutmeg in the crust.

Very good, very sticky. They taste vaguely Middle Eastern, I think. The most time-consuming part of making these bars is toasting the hazelnuts and rubbing off their skins!

The topping was good (I used all pecans, as they're my favorite, and skipped toasting them), but I found the cake base too dry and too thick. Half as much would have been fine, and another time, I'd go with the standard "Dream Bar" base, which uses much less flour and no egg. I think a little cream cheese in the base would be great, too. Re crumbly base: it holds together perfectly if made in a processor.

Turned out good, however base did not turn out well. It was extrememly crumbly and would not stay together when cutting into bars.

Fantastic. Everyone who tried them, thought that I had bought them at a bakery. Time consuming for the amount made. Next time I make them, I will double the recipe. They didn't last more than 2 days! The bottom crust is very much like short bread. I didn't wait for the bottom to cool,and it still turned out great. A definate impressive treat.

This recipe is delicious! It will surely satisfy the sweet and nut cravers. I had a little trouble with the crumbly dough but it worked out well in the end. Also, I replaced the hazelnuts with pecans and it tasted wonderful! Everyone should definetly try this recipe, be sure to use good quality honey.
