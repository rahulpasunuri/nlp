Excellent. I usually do not follow recipes to the T, just because. But this one I did and indeed it was delicious. I agree that only half as much butter is needed. Be careful about overcooking the chicken. I had a 4 1/2 pounder and 1 hour was a bit too long. I added a bit wine with the broth for the gravy -- mmmn good.

I cut the chicken in half so that it would fit in our toaster oven and turned down the heat to 350 after 30 minutes. The skin came out crispy, the meat was juicy and the house smelled lovely. I would definitely make this dish again.

Definitely a simple recipe. Made this a few times already and my kids love this chicken, especially with the gravy. This recipe is not only for kids. Hubby loves it too! It is a family friendly recipe!

Simple and delicious every time! I used less fat the 2nd time I tried and have made it again that way... 3T total of oil/butter is plenty to cook the chicken and make the gravy. I had a chicken with torn skin and just poured the herbs and fat over it and basted a few times and thought it was almost as good and worth saving the effort of rubbing under the skin.

So good you don't even need to make the gravy!

Excellent, my family loved this. I added Rosemary and cut the butter in half.

Simple, but extremely tasty. My kids devour it, along with mashed potatoes.

A good, simple recipe that my two kids loved (and help make) but you can cut the butter in half. For added flavour, we took some of the oil from a bottle of sundried tomatoes. Also, roast the chicken while it sits on a rack standing in half of the stock. The drippings make for a heartier roux (and another reason for reducing the butter).

The simplicity of this recipe may through you off but in the end you'll see how delicious the chicken is. It was better than any other chicken I've made before. I also turned the carcass into soup afterwards.
