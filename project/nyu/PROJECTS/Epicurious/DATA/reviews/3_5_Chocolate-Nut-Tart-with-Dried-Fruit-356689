This tart was very rich and almost fudge like. Half of my family and friends thought it was pretty good while the rest really disliked it. I had to add a little more cream to make it even workable.

Got rave reviews but it was difficult to serve - it was a bit solid. I think adding extra cream (milk maybe?) would have helped. I used dried apricots, strawberries, cherries and blueberries (Trader Joes mix), almonds and hazelnuts. I agree that it was quick, easy, and a bit rich.

Quick and easy recipe, read my review at pastrynomad.com, blog for January 18, very rich! I used leftover trail mix to make, along with a frozen Trader Joe's all butter pie crust.

definitely easy. The crust got a little soggy though.

This was indeed fast and easy. I also liked it because there weren't many ingredients and I could use what I had on hand. For the nuts I toasted pistachios, pine nuts and almonds and for the dried fruit I only had cranberries and apricots, but it worked out fine. I didn't have any toffee for the top, so I just used a bit of the nut/fruit mix to garnish. It is rich, but we took it to a dessert party where I cut it in small wedges.

We served this tonight at a dinner party, and it was yummy but a little rich. We used dried blueberries, cherries, and cranberries. For the nuts, we used pistachios, pecans, and almonds.
