This soup is great, we like to servce it as an appetizer on Easter. The color is very festive and the soup is rich.

You don't need the sugar in this recipe--I couldn't imagine that you did. I left it out and used a tablespoon of dill weed, very nice. I served it with steaks (rare), baby greens, and mushrooms sauteed in wine, with cream and black pepper. For people who don't like it. . .you have to like beets, I think. Not everyone does.

My boyfriend wouldn't eat more than one spoonful and I didn't think it was much better.
