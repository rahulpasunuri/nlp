Turned out great! I substituted heavy cream for the water for a richer, buttery toffee flavor (as opposed to nut brittle). I also find this to be much better w/milk chocolate so it doesn't overwhelm the candy. Warning: adding vanilla to boiling hot toffee causes a mini-explosion! Add before boiling or after cooling somewhat.

I made this substituting 1/4 dark replacing 1/4 cup light brown sugar 1/8 cup dark replacing 1/8 cup light corn syrup 1/2 lb Shokinag white chocolate replacing chips 1 cup toasted macademia nuts for cashews I tempered the chocolate, and dipped the broken toffee pieces after removing from glass containers and cutting into 1.5 by 3 inch pieces. It was absolutely fantastic. I received rave reviews, and I get constant requests to make this.
