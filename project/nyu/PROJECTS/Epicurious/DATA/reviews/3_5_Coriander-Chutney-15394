It is very tasty, a nice blend of sweet and hot with a good cilantro taste. However, the recipe comes out a bit dryer than I was expecting for a coriander chutney. I really didn't want to add more oil to it to mitigate that dryness, so it lost some of the possible uses that I was hoping it would fulfill. But it still was a pretty tasty condiment.

Excellent! I freeze whatever I don't use right away. Whata great condiment!
