Really simple easy delicious recipe. I served the sauce alongside with rice and the chicken. I also floured the chicken to give it a crust and used smoked paprika. Will make again for certain.

definitely followed suggestions to deglaze. Also think mushrooms would be an ideal addition to this recipe.

Rating: 3
I was determined to make this recipe as written the first time but I became convinced of the need to deglaze the pan as several other reviewers suggest. Too much good stuff accumulates on the pan and I used a little extra butter. I used white wine at the end to get all the good flavor. It is good but I like the other recipe Chicken with Herb-Roasted Tomatoes and Pan Sauce http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chicken-with-Herb-Roasted-Tomatoes-and-Pan-Sauce-51108240

I doubled this recipe and mixed crushed basil, garlic,dried marjoram and dried oregano into the butter for my oleo. Delicious!!! My chicken was so tender and flavorful! This recipe is a keeper.

Good dish! Easy and good...just wish there was more sauce! Put the dish over angel hair pasta....good and nice presentation!

A couple of things: 1) If your chicken breasts are thicker, they will take longer than 5 minutes/side to cook through - mine took almost 20 minutes total. 2) Make sure your butter is room temperature before swirling it in, it makes it much easier

Absolutely Loved the taste of the chicken! The tomatoes were awesome, I used Grape tomatoes instead of Cherry (It's what I had in my fridge). Such a great simple recipe and very affordable! Next time I might pound down the chicken...a thicker breast took longer to cook

Husband and I both loved it! I would make even more "sauce" (butter mix) next time. Deglazed pan with white wine as well, before putting in tomatoes and remaining butter. Quick and easy! Delicious and healthy!

Actually, 3.5 stars I liked this a lot...it's very simple and tasty. I used Air Chilled boneless breast halves from WF. I used sweet smoked paprika, and 3/4 tsp of marjoram and oregano. It's worthwhile to make sure to reduce the tomatoes so as to enhance the flavor. I cooked the chicken mostly covered on med-low...5 minutes per side was just right. I had penne pasta as a side, and roasted root vegetables with rosemary..deelicious!

Excellent! Very tasty! Easy & quick. Savored the caramelized tomatoes.

Followed recipe except I also used dried oregano instead of fresh marjoram (1 tsp). Agreed with other reviewers. Took about 20 minutes to hit 160 on my instant read, though my chicken was thick. 10 minutes on medium heat is not nearly enough. Only rated 2 forks because of personal taste. I didn't care for it, but it was... interesting.

I left a really good review below, but it turned out the chicken was not cooked properly...which was unpleasant later. A second attempt with a meat thermometer revealed that you really have to cook it forever to get the breasts up to 165. At that point the chicken was dry and the garlic charred. Still, the tomatoes and sauce were sooo good that I plan to give it a third try (eventually). I recommend cutting the chicken breasts into tenderloins, to allow it to cook all the way through. And only add garlic at the very end, to prevent charring (only put it in the second half of the butter-and-spice mixture).

This is a great, fast meal perfect for weeknights! In my rotation since I first saw it in the summer.

Really good with little effort. Deglaze the pan with white wine before the tomatoes go in.

I found the recipe to be delicious and easy. I used oregano. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I plan to use it again soon. I may try the sauce with other meats as well.

I prepared this recipe almost as written except I used dried Oregano and Marjoram to total 1 teaspoon. Everything turned out perfectly. The chicken was cooked to the exact desired doneness. I served the chicken with brown rice, steamed spinach and carrots and it was DELICIOUS!

This is a really good recipe. I also deglazed the pan as suggested but I used chicken broth and a little lemon juice. I'll definitely make this again.

this has easily become one of my most favorite dishes. made it exactly how the recipe stated, except i used dried oregano spice because that's what i had on hand. so quick and simple to make, perfect for a busy New York girl trying not to eat out every night! and, agreed with the others, this makes the perfect tomato sauce to also use on pasta!

I doubled the recipe but only used 2 cups of cherry tomatoes and oregano instead of marjoram. As suggested I de-glazed before adding the tomatoes, but I used vermouth (didn't have any white wine). It was delicious and perfect over angel hair pasta. Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe today, and my boyfriend and I loved it. I did not get any of that burnt garlic taste that many reviewers have stated before. I did make some changes to the recipe it self. -used boneless thighs -Marinated the chicken in salt pepper and white wine -2 garlic cloves -2 1/2 cups of tomatoes -3/4 plain paprika -3 tablespoons of butter and I used dried oregano rather than fresh because thats what I have. It came out excellent and was extremely easy to make. I will definitely make this again.

This is soooo good, easy and quick! I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and smoked paprika instead of sweet. Very flavorful - will make again:)

Quick and delicious. I agree that deglazing is a must. I used white wine as well, and it was great. I also agree with a previuos reviewer that the garlic can start to have a bit of a burnt taste, but I added two tablespoons of lowfat sour cream at the end and that smoothed out the flavor. Served it over angel hair pasta with a side of simple cut green beans. No leftovers!

This was a quick and delicious meal- perfect for a busy weeknight but I could see serving this for guests as well. I am allergic to garlic and paprika so I omitted those and added a little truffle salt for the garlicky flavor. We also had some baby heirloom tomatoes which I mixed in with cherry tomatoes and the resulting flavors were perfect for the end of summer. I doubled the butter and used fresh oregano- served with baked potatoes which soaked up the extra sauce. Will definitely be making this again!

The garlic in the recipe became really charred and tasted vile. I added the second teaspoon of marjoram butter to the pan at the same time as the tomatoes, rather than after the tomatoes were almost done, which may have made a difference. But I doubt it because the garlic from the chicken was still left over and blackened and would have ended up mixed with the sauce anyways. Overall, a disappointment. Would not suggest making this recipe unless you tweak it somehow.

Just one additional comment from my review below is that this recipe seems like it would double very nicely in a 12-inch saute pan.

Rating: 4
Quick, healthy, and delicious - I love it. As it mentions in the recipe intro, the secret to this recipe is letting the fond build while letting the chicken cook, and then scraping it up once the tomatoes release their liquid and the herb butter is added. Although I haven't tried it, I'm not sure this recipe would work as well in a non-stick pan since the caramelized food bits may not form.

Yummy and easy! Also served with quinoa and couldn't find oregano or marjarom at Trader Joe's so I used fresh thyme. Not super-flavorful, but perhaps it was because of this substitution.

This was delicious! This is a great recipe if you have lots of tomatoes from the garden (and your friends gardens!) like I did. There aren't many ingredients but it has a surprising amount of flavor. I'll definitely make it again.

This was delicious. Like others I deglazed the pan, which added tons of flavor. The only thing I'd do differently next time was double the butter, and add more tomatoes! Other than that, definitely a weeknight favorite.

This came out delicious and was one of the fastest meals I've ever made... perfect for a weekday dinner. I cut up the chicken into bite-size chunks and then sautéed - this cut the cook time down considerably. Other than that, followed the recipe as-is. Served over quinoa and snap peas.

Rating: 4
this was fantastic. i followed the recipe exactly (and pounded the chicken breasts a little-- which i always do with chicken). i didn't deglaze the pan because we didn't want to open a bottle of wine, and it was still fabulous. i served it with couscous which soaked up the extra sauce nicely.. and some zucchini too. this is going into the rotation for sure.

I love recipes like this. Despite the rave reviews, I never imagined that these humble ingredients would produce something so delicious. I also took the other reviewers advice and deglazed the pan. This was so good. I will be making it again, probably today:)

Delicious and easy! I followed the recipe almost exactly, using dried oregano and grape tomatoes, and served it with rice. Like other reviewers, I had to cook the chicken longer than the recipe says, but that wasn't a problem.

Restaurant quality meal in less than forty minutes? Heck yes! I took TexasGourmet's advice and deglazed the pan and left the chicken in during cooking. Served with quinoa and deliciousness.

Very good dish. Tasty and easy to make. But I agree to pound the breasts first, as I flattened some of them and others left they way they were. Those I left as they were I had to cook longer and they dried a little, but the thinner ones were delicious. Also, I think I got carried away with the tomatoes and I burnt them a little, but all said and done, I'll certainly make this again.

So easy and so delicious! The chicken was tender and flavorful and the tomato sauce had such a strong and pleasant flavor. I took the previous advice to deglaze the pan first with wine before adding the tomatoes - this really added to it. I served it over wheat spaghetti for dinner. This worked well for my 16 month old who isn't a big fan of tomatoes - chicken and pasta were easy enough to separate for her. Definitely going into the weeknight dinner rotation.

best Chicken dish ever double the sauce and add extra butter.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe . . .I made a couple of adjustments. I was out of marjoram, so substituted oregano. Browned chicken breasts for 3.5 minutes per side, then deglazed pan with breasts still in, with a little white wine. Then added sauce ingredients and simmered with lid on another 3 minutes, turned breasts, simmered 3 minutes more. Not only were the thick breasts cooked through, but the sauce infused the chicken making them exceptionally juicy and tender. Perfect over rice or couscous.

This dish was delicious! It was so simple and easy to make. I thought it made a great week night meal and I will definitely make it again. The only thing I would do different would be to pound the chicken breasts, as others have said. They did take quite some time to cook.

Rating: 4
Fast, simple, and delicious recipe. We used a mixture of homegrown yellow and red cherry tomatoes. I also deglazed my cast iron skillet with white wine because the butter did overbrown, but it made for a deeply flavored sauce. I served it over barley couscous with light salad.

Rating: 4
Wonderful fast dish. I agree with other reviewers that breasts should be flattened a little before cooking. I did mine on medium low heat so the butter would not burn. A touch of white wine to de-glaze before adding the final butter also helps stretch the great sauce.

Rating: 3
I love how simple, rustic, and good this recipe is. The only problem is with the suggested cooking times and temperatures. At least with the chicken breasts I used, they needed way more than 5 minutes on each side. And turning up the heat so much on the tomatoes ran the risk of burning the butter. Tastes fantastic, and low in carbs.

This was a great date recipe! Looked impressive, tasted great, but not so time consuming or complicated that I needed to focus all of my time and concentration on it. I couldn't find fresh marjoram so used a healthy amount of dried - still tasted great! I cooked the tomatoes down a little too much - next time I will def keep them saucier! I served this with a shaved zucchini salad: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Shaved-Zucchini-Salad-with-Parmesan-Pine-Nuts-360251

Last night I made this with this recipe as a side: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Orzo-with-Feta-Tomatoes-and-Dill-242827 Great combination. I doubled the recipe. The robust flavor surprised me. I accidentally cooked the sauce down more than I should have. I added water and cooked it down again. The flavor was still full bodied. Great simple recipe.

Excellent recipe! I used small tomatoes and cut them in quarters. Then I sliced the chicken breasts before pouring sauce over them. Loved the taste!
