I read the reviews about the potatoes having to much oil in them. So after roasting the garlic I took the cloves out of the oil and saved it for something else later. I did the boiled potatoes in the bacon fat instead and cut down on the amount of salt. They came out real good! We will be making this recipe again.

Prepared the same way as the cook from bedminster and found it delicious. A good, easy side dish.

My family and I loved this recipe. I used about 6 garlic cloves and 1 TBS olive oil, but kept the rest the same. It was yummy.

Considering all the strong flavors used (bacon, garlic, sage), this dish was surprisingly bland. It needs major changes, such as less bacon, raw garlic instead of roasted, or some additional seasonings (salt, pepper, thyme). We also had problems with not using baby red potatoes (unavailable); we had to cut the larger red potatoes, which caused slipped skins, mushy exteriors, and undercooked interiors. Definitely need the small potatoes to make this one work properly.

My hubbie is a vegetarian, so I made it without the bacon. Definitely missed some oomph with that ommission. Also, I should have cut the potatoes smaller so the sage and garlic infused them more.

This was pretty greasy but the flavors worked well together. Not sure you need that much butter and oil when you have the bacon.

I melted the butter added the garlic and sage (chopped) and mixed them all together. I used no oil, and turkey bacon when I heated the potatoes so it wasn't greasy at all. Added a little salt and it was delicious

It was delicious but definitely a little too heavy on the grease.

Whats not to like, potatoes, bacon, garlic and butter! I roasted whole heads of garlic, instead of individual cloves.

This was okay. I liked the sharp taste of the garlic and the smoky bacon that came through but it seemed like it was lacking something.

This was great and very to make. The fresh sage was a really nice touch.

An excellent side dish for Thanksgiving that is not mashed like the sweet potatoes and does not have to go in the oven!!
