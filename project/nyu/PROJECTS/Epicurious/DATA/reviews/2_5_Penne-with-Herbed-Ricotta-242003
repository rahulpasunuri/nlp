This was very bland. It could be modified - add prosciutto or more herbs or grilled chicken - but why? There are too many much better recipes out there to waste time fixing this one.

This dish was insanely bland as is. I think I will try it again but make some serious modifications.

If you like pesto flavor you will love this one. I hated it.

Great, simple dish... we added sliced Andouille sausage, too!

I've made this twice now and I think it's just great. A few tips - 1) mince the herbs finely to make the sauce smoother and even out the taste; 2) I used a local dairy's ricotta that is much looser than grocery-store ricotta, so no cooking water was needed; 3) a bit of parmesan to finish doesn't hurt and 4) angel hair worked much better with the sauce than penne. Also, the sauce (without cooked pasta) keeps really well in the fridge for a week+, and is easy to add to freshly cooked pasta. This is a great way to use home-grown herbs, if you've got them.

Huh? Too spicy, Grensboro?? Lol! This was delicious for a quick weeknight dinner. If it's too dry make sure to add a little of the pasta cooking water.

This is great! The herbs add a fresh flavor, if you use fresh herbs. I grated feata chesse on this and it was great! Use the peas as the other reviewers added. This is great if you use whole-grain pasta.

Definitely quick and easy, but not very interesting or satisfying. It just tasted like a mouthful of herbs to me, with nothing to balance it out. I don't think that I will make this again.

I followed the directions for this recipe except that I went heavy on the herbs. Since they were fresh and it is early in the season I've noticed that the ones from my garden and not very strong yet. I also followed the cook from Minneapolis and added the asparagus and peas from the other recipe. I cut up the asparagus and put that and the peas into the pasta cooking water. The dish was really pretty, tasted great, but it wasn't very creamy. The ricotta doesn't melt so it was a little grainy. That said, I would make it again.

This was okay but it was actually too spicy for me.

Very easy and delicious weeknight meal. Went all out green and prepared this with the Asparagus, Peas and basil recipe. For leftovers, tossed the two - a taste of spring! Adding some hot pasta water is a good idea.
