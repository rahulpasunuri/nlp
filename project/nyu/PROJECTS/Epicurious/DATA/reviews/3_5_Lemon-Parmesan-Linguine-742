Was serving with chicken picatta, so was cautious with the lemon. I omitted all of the lemon zest and only used two tablespoon lemon juice to a full cup of whipping cream. I would up the lemon juice next time. Also, I always up the cheese. Very easy and elegant recipe. My girlfriends loved. Will be a staple in my menu options.

Easy, refreshing and satisfying. In addition to the fresh flat leaf parsley as a finisher, I'd recommending toasting some walnuts, fine chopping them and adding them during the final toss (toasted pine nuts might be a nice complement as well). This is a great foundation for numerous additions and alterations. Next time I plan to add asparagus tips.

I just made this and it was good, but the lemon flavor was a bit overpowering. If you don't want the lemon taste to be too strong, maybe cut down on the juice and peel. Otherwise it's a great recipe.

This was soooo tasty! Great summer dish. Really refreshing with the lemon and not at all heavy, despite the cream and butter. I served this with some prawns sauteed in a little olive oil and garlic and it was fantastic.

Yes, this has great flavor and it's easy to make but you have to make it, serve it, and eat it FAST because it returns very quickly to room temperature and loses all of its pizzaz. In other words, have everything else ready to go before you make the cream sauce.

Fabulous! I love serving it with chicken baked with fresh herbs and garlic. I also make a nice salad on the side or sauteed asparagus, depending on the season. I have made this pasta many times, and it always receives the highest compliments. It is a permanent fixture in my recipe files. YUM!

This dish was excellent with the ahi I served. Didn't change a thing.

I didn't like this recipe at all. First of all it had far too much lemon zest!. You can't even taste the 1/2c of cheese. The lemon juice added a nice tang to it, but that's the only good thing about this recipe. Yes it's very easy to make, but it's the last time I will make it.

I made this as-is with wonderful reviews from my family. You could easily add more lemon if you wanted a more robust flavor to complement a subtly-flavored entree (sauteed chicken breast, for instance). Will become a staple recipe in my home.

This recipe is easy and good. Made it for guests after work one night.I did add parsley at the end. Earned raves from everyone.

Beautiful (although incredibly rich) recipe! We have made this numerous times as both a side dish and a standalone pasta dish. I simmered some minced garlic in the butter before continuing with the recipe and it turned out excellent. Highly recommended.

Made this yesterday and the only changes I made were: instead of using lemon rind, and then salt and pepper later, I used Lemon Pepper which basically is a combination of all three. Then I added some baby shrimp..... It was a big hit!

This is a wonderful recipe and I've made it often. It needs one thing though - chopped fresh Italian parsley. It makes all the difference in both taste and presentation. It's really good.

Very easy, interesting and good! I'd certainly make it again.

Feb.'98 Bon Appetit issue had almost the same recipe from a hotel in Italy but the ingredients included parsley. I also add sun dried tomatoes. It's definitely a family favorite!
