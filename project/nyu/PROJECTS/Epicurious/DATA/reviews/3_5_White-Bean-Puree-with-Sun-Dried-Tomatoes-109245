Really delicious, healthy and interesting. I used white beans that I cooked and froze a month agoand some of the cooking liquid for the water. Used 1/2 small red onion because I did not have a shallot. I added 1 tsp sherry vinegar to give a sparkle. Served this with thin slices of toasted whole grain bread. My normally anti whole grain family loved this.

My family loved this recipe. I, on the other hand, thought it was just okay. I used canned beans that I sauteed with the chopped onion and rosemary sprigs for about 30 minutes. The rosemary flavor really came through. Otherwise, I followed the recipe but forgot the chopped rosemary -oops. I think that much rosemary would overwhelm the results.

Very tasty despite my substitutions. * Instead of fresh rosemary, I emptied a teabag and put 1 TBSP of dried into the boiling water. * I used a red onion. * Fresh basil replaced the last TBSP of rosemary. * Used leeks instead of shallots * Omitted salt, black pepper, boiling water Also didn't see why you couldn't use the oil from the tomatoes: I did! Barely cooled off, I used a nice slice of organic bread to clean the blender of the extra dip I couldn't get into the storage bowl! Try it!

I make this all the time and freeze in smaller portions to have for company

I make this all the time and most folks love it. The more you make it, the more you know just how to tweak it to suit your preferences, i.e., I like more lemon. You'll also change the taste depending on amount of sundried, etc. I do, however, agree with earlier review which suggests that it is worth soaking then simmering the dried beans because of the flavor they pick up from rosemary & onions--can't be duplicated with canned. Leftover is divine used as a sandwich spread for turkey, roasted vegetable sandwich, etc.

Based upon the recommendations of other reviewers, I saved some time and used canned cannelini beans. I made this as an appetizer to a recent dinner for 4 persons. I think I enjoyed it more than the others. They liked it, but didn't love it. I think I might try other dips before coming back to this one.

This recipe is delicious! I made these with the "Mediterranean Casual" menu for a dinner party and it completely stole the show. Nobody wanted to move on from the appetizer. I know that soaking the beans and cooking them can seem a pain, but having them simmer in the rosemary and onion makes all the difference.

It's a good dip, but I wish I had just used canned beans because the soaking and boiling and cooling etc. made this more time and effort than it was worth for a dip. I really liked the flavor and texture and I will make again, just not with dried beans.

This recipe is a keeper! Like a previous reviewer, I found that the color was not as red as the picture, but the taste was fabulous and the presentation with the olive oil drizzle, lemon wedges and chopped parsley was attractive. I used the oil from the sundried tomatoes for extra flavor for the puree. My guests gobbled it up!

Fabulous! Now I just hope that I won't nibble it all away before the dinner party tomorrow night! Wonderful layering of favorite flavors.

What could I have done wrong? I followed this recipe exactly but mine is not the same color as the picture. It looks more like salmon. Ideas? Thanks!

An excellent dip - I use canned beans as a time saver with wonderful results - It's a keeper!

Ok I didn't make this recipe exactly. Actually I made spicychicken's version. Except I think there was too much lemon in his/her recipe. So I would make this again and follow the original recipe as far as lemon goes. Thanks spicy!

This bean dip is tasty - or rather a spin on this dip that I concocted based on what I had on hand and previous reviewers' tips. I used 2 cans of cannelli beans, drained. I sauteed them in a pan with a sprig of rosemary and two garlic cloves (since I don't like onions). I added about a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes and a three or four tablespoons of olive oil, as well as salt to taste. I used 1/2 cup dry sundried tomatoes and soaked them in hot water for a few minutes before adding them and the bean mixture as well as a teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary, the juice of one lemon, 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1/3 cup water to the blender and pureed. I served with sliced jalapeno bread and toasted pita wedges. The guests ate it up!

I used canned beans and it came out perfect. Raves every time I make this. Everyone asks for the recipe. I use 2 cans of great northern beans sauteed with a little olive oil, 1/2 an onion and a whole sprig of rosemary. Let that cool. While that is cooling, in a food processor, I pulse the rest of the ingredients. I only use half the sundried tomatoes for 2 cans of beans though. Then I add the cooked bean mixture to the processor minus the cooked piece of rosemary, add the water and voila! Awesome everytime.

but I do wish epicurious would let me change the amount of servings for the recipes. Most of the time I'm cooking for just 2, and sometimes just for myself.

This was really good. It's a nice change from a traditional hummus. I thought the flavors complimented each other nicely. I wouldn't say this was bland, but it definitely was more mellow than I expected. I toasted some regular and wheat flat bread wedges at 350 for 25 minutes, until they were golden and very crispy.

This is delicious! Easy to make and worth it! The recipe makes a lot so be prepared to have a lot.

This was so delicious!! I used the leftovers on toast in the morning. It is certainly worth the effort to soak and cook the beans-I am not sure it would taste the same with canned beans.

I made this using canned Small White Beans. I thought the amount of salt in the recipe was way too much - 3/4 to 1 tsp would be enough. Definitely make this a day ahead; the flavors need time to develop. I was not too keen on this dip but guests raved over it!

I originally tasted this at my sister's and loved it. I made it for the first time a few days ago, with her input. I didn't have time to soak the beans, so instead I used two drained cans of Great Northerns. I upped the amount of shallots (skipping the onion altogether)and used 2Tbs. of the s.d. tomato oil in place of 4 Tbs. of plain olive oil. It does taste better the next day and is great celery, flat bread or even schmeared on a chunk of peasant bread.

Cooked it for a dinner party for my parents and it was a huge hit! Guests took the recipe home with them. Definately will make again and again.

we used 2 cans of great northern beans and heated them on the stove with a half an onion chopped and some rosemary for about 15 minutes. also, we had "dry" sundried tomatoes so we used that with just a little olive oil instead of the oil packed tomatoes. it was much easier and really turned out to be a big hit at 2 parties! MAKES A LOT!

Use sun-dried tomatoes to taste. I probably used more than the recipe called for. It was delicious - got raves.

I used canned Great Northern beans and extra shallots to make up for it. I also used some tabasco instead of crushed pepper. It was a hit!

This was a bit time consuming but it was not bland at all... I added a little more lemon juice and shallots. It was a big hit at my party

This receipe was a lot of preparation and time and the end result was not stellar. I found it bland and for the time invested was a disappointment
