I had to modify the recipe a bit to make the cakes stick--more crumbs & mayo + refrigeration--but I was using bigger chunks of crab. Loved that these cakes are heavy on the crab and really let the flavor come through. The lemon zest and smallest touch of heat were perfect with sweet, fresh crab.

This simple recipe is elegant and delicious. Making the crab cakes and refrigerating them for several hours prior to cooking seems to help the materials bind. Perfect with wild rice as an accompaniment. Hope you enjoy these as much as we do.

Good classic crab cakes. They actually stuck together quite well--perhaps because I used reduced fat mayo, and added a dash of green Tabasco? I also used pita breadcrumbs and some rice as a binder because that's all I had on hand. But they were very tasty.

Though tasty, it was so difficult to keep the mix sticking, no matter how small I made them. I have another recipe that I will stick to from SELF magazine.

These are easy to make - slightly difficult to get them to hold together but I was skimping on the mayo. I can't say they were particularly spicy but they tasted good and uncomplicated.

These crab cakes are terrific and easy. I used regular breadcrumbs and they came out fine. Using good quality lump crabmeat ensures the best outcome. Also, I add 1/4 pound of chopped shrimp to the mixture. It made the texture extra special.

In response to question re 75% - there are 2 questions in the rating form - 1 asks for number of forks the other a yes or no as to whether you would make the dish. Some reviewers do not answer the second question.

Dear Epicurious Site Manager- I am confused.If four out of four reviews were (very) positive, why was the rating 75%?

Didn't think it was as easy as it appeared. The difficulty was in keeping the cakes from crumbling before breading. Finally discovered it was best to pack the mixture in 1/4 c. measuring cup to mold before breading. They WERE worth the effort, though - everyone loved them. Made it for a light lunch.

Loved it! Served it for the first time at a dinner party and was a little nervous about not having made it before. It was VERY easy and really tasty.

Liked this dish a lot, and it went over really well. Had a tiny bit of trouble with the texture, but I think that was because I was a little lazy draining the crab meat; my cakes had a bit of a wet consistency. That didn't ruin them by any means, however, but I'd still make sure you're careful with that. I added some flour to compensate. A delightful summer dish - will definitely make again - and also definitely company-worthy. Oh, did I mention they're incredibly quick and easy? A definite plus...

Quick and easy with great results!! I made one addition to the recipe however, I coated the outside with breadcrumbs before frying. I like my crab cakes crispy.
