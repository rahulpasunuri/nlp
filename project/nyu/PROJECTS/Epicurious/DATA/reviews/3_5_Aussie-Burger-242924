I am so excited about this recipe! This was the very best burger I have ever made. Everyone raved how excellent they were. Definitely agree the grilled onions are a must. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this burger the week the recipe was posted,and have been making it ever since! It just takes a burger to the highest level. It's perfect for those who think a burger is just a burger,

I'm an Australian. Yes this is a 'burger with the lot' found at any takeaway in Australia. Often the pineapple is cut thinly (this is a personal preference thing), grilled onions are added, bacon is added and so is iceberge lettuce (I think you call it crisprhead lettuce). The custom is to use ketchup. Mayo and chili are not usually added. We usually reserve these for as a previous reviewer stated to fish burgers and chili to chicken burgers.

Really tasty! I am a big fan of sweet and savory together, and it was really very good! Even my fiance who doesn't like beets enjoyed this.

it was too much for me on one burger...nice concept, but I recommend picking your top favorites and just using them. My guests did not like the pineapple for instance. But I didn't try onion rings because I don't like those...

This is called a "Burger with the lot" in OZ. You have to add the grilled onions.

I was fortunate enough to live in Australia (NE Vic.) in the early 90s, and just as the first reviewer says, this is accurate! I do prefer mine with the grilled onions. Although it seems an odd combo, give it a go - it really is delicious! I became so accustomed to this that we still keep tins of beetroot and pineapple rings on hand for burgers and salad sandwiches. And I did see the chili sauce, but never on a burger - always on fish sandwiches. I never saw mayo used on anything like this. Cheers!

I'm an American living in Australia and I can attest that beetroot on a burger is fantastic, as is fried egg. Not sure where the chili/mayo/ketchup combo comes from (never seen that) but any burger with 'the lot' will have pineapple, egg, beetroot and also bacon. Try it you won't be disappointed!!
