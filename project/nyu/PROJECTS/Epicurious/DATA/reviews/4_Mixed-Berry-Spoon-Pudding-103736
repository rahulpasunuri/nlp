Rote Gruetze from a 'recipe' from a Kempinski hotel? You must be kidding. Jelly?! Only fresh fruit, sugar and a little bit of starch is used in an authentic Rote Gruetze. The money saving shortcuts of a hotel restaurant that caters mostly to foreign (business) visitors should not be mistaken for local fresh cuisine!
