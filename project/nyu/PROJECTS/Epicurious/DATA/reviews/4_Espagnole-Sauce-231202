I like the recipe but I like to add a little roasted, off the bone, beef shank with its demiglace from the pan. I'm putting the sauce over prepared cheese raviolies tonight. I thicken to a sauce and include the veggies.

This is a perfect version to the classic mother sauce. You can add anything to it and it only makes it better.

I also add a few chopped button shrooms to the mix. A delicious and super easy sauce. Can't really go wrong with this one. Perfect every time.

I have made this twice now and it is the perfect company dish. My spouse is a picky eater and I was shocked at the ohs and ahs he made while eating.
