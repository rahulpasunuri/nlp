I made this salad with a couple of changes, and it was delicious. I used roasted yellow pepper in place of golden beet and I made my own pistachio oil. Would definitely make it again. I did not have a cookie cutter but I cut a ring from a plastic container.

I was unable to get mâché or pistachio oil, so I used spring mix and walnut oil. I did not mold the beets because my family would not have eaten this salad if they knew it had beets in it. Only one of the six did not clean their plate. ( all his salads are covered in ranch dressing and cheddar cheese, so I was not surprised.) So far this my favorite recipe for my rather abundant crop of beets.

Loved the flavors. I used only red beets, as I couldn't find golden beets, but it was still delicious. I also just made one big, tossed salad, with the beets cut into large chunks, and used olive oil in place of the pistachio oil. Presentation and flavor were both excellent.

Lovely. I followed the recipe, except didn't have shallots. The dressing was too bland and oil-heavy for me, so next time I will use less oil & make sure to use shallots; I will also add a small dab of Dijon mustard and, after unmolding, I will sprinkle lightly with balsamic vinegar. I experimented with various mold makers and liked best the squat clear Solo drink cups (cut off the top inch). I used 8 of these - easier to apportion than 1 at a time - and since my beets were slightly warm, I slightly chilled the filled cups and then unmolded on plates. This worked well.

made this last night for company. read all the reviews and was skeptical about how good beet and goat cheese could be...well all the reviewers were right..one of the best salads i ever ate. just wonderfully sweet from the beets and goat cheese was cream and bright. couldn't ask for a better recipe. my hubby did the assemble. went to the grocery store and found a can with a flat bottom and no metal rim inside ... ended up being a mandarin orange can. worked perfectly.

Tried this recipe with some variations for a dinner party of 12 basically doubling everything. Could not find pistachio oil so I attempted to make it by combining very warm grape seed oil with roasted pistachios (with some of them chopped and others whole) and allowing them to set overnight in an air tight jar. I then strained the mixture and returned the whole pistachio with strained oil to another air tight container. This worked fairly well. Could not find golden beets so I just used red beets, but I did add a finely diced granny smith apple that I covered with lemon juice to prevent browning. Instead of lamb's lettuce, I used chopped arugula leaves only. The salad was a big hit with almost everyone, even non beet eaters, raving about it. One thing I would watch the next time I make it is the amountt of oil used. I would use a little less oil in coating the beets and I would not toss the arugula since there is more than enough oil in the beets and drizzled on the plate. One other thing I did differently. I place the beets on a bed of arugula instead of topping the beets with the arugula. I will definitely make this again.

Thought this was excellent when I made this using a combination of walnut oil and olive oil. Finally managed to find pistachio oil (on sale, too!) and found this made the salad incredible. Presentation is just gorgeous.

Rating: 4
I've made this dozens of times. I don't use pistachio oil b/c it's too expensive. So I just use regular olive oil. I also don't bother with the pistachios every time. The shallots, lemon juice, salt, pepper and olive oil are a delicious dressing on top of the beets and the goat cheese is what makes this dish stand out. The creamy texture with the sweet beat and the citrus dressing are to die for! Restaurant quality every time and you will make people who don't even like beats, love them.

Love, love, loved this. We love beets but this was wonderful. We didnt use the nuts due to an allergy but it was great. We have done several variations with this using goat cheese and grape seed oil. If you dont have the cookie cutter use a small white ramekin, works fine!

This is a fantastic recipe. I even thought that I didn't like beets. I made this for a Valentine's Day dinner and used a heart shaped cookie cutter for the beets. Lemon chevre tastes fantastic with the beets, and I served the beets on top of a bed of arugula. Yum!

Exceptional! I used red beets and substituted rutabaga for the golden beets and still came out great. Served this on New Years Eve and everyone loved the tastes.

Very tasty. I couldn't find golden beets so just used all red ones. The presentation was very pretty. (Just as a hint, if you don't have a round cookie cutter appropriate for this, you can just use some sharp scissors and carefully cut the top and bottom off a drink can and it works perfectly)

Wonderful. Didn't have pistachio oil, so just used a really good quality olive oil. Next time I would double the dressing recipe. I felt there wasn't enough. Also, the roasting of the beets took me way longer than the suggested time. Not sure if I was doing something wrong?? All in all, fantastic.

This was very good but for the effort I think it could have had more flavor- it was very pretty and had a nice subtle flavor that went well with the beets - I had to use walnut oil because none of the grocery stores in the area had pistachio oil

Nice elegant starter salad for those who enjoy beets. Recommend toasting the pistachios. Instead of incorporating into the mold, we pressed goat cheese slices into half-inch thick disks, battered with egg & breadcrumbs, brushed with olive oil and broiled until brown. The beet tower and goat cheese disk created a nice visual balance and texture.

This was a really lovely salad!! I served on Christmas Eve and even my Mother-In-Law thought it was great and she isn't easy to please. I will say that I thought I was going to have to sell a kidney in order to afford the Pistachio Oil. I plan to experiment with other nuts and nut oils. I also wasn't able to get Mache and my Whole Foods. I used Arugula instead that thought that the peppery flavor of the arugula worked well with beets and dressing. Lastly, I tried to cheat and serve this salad on Christmas Day as well and found that the shallots took over the whole salad when left with the beets overnight. This salad is now a staple in our house.

I made it exactly as directed, using pistachio oil, and it was delicious. I used a green chili tin can with both ends removed for a mold (perfect size). I had help assembling it for a dinner for 10. Took about 10 minutes for mold and topping assembly. Worth it! Next time I would cut down on the oil a bit.

My best friend made this for our potluck Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a huge hit!

Can't wait to make it myself!

I made this a few months ago with homemade pistachio oil and did the little cookie cutter mold and everything for just my husband and I. It was as good as the best beet and goat cheese salads I've had at upscale restaurants, and I always order that kind of salad when it's on a menu. I took the leftovers to my parents and tried to pile the salad without a mold. They raved at how gorgeous and delicious it was. I'm going to make it again today with candy cane and yellow beets and not bother with the mold. Great recipe.

I am looking forward to making this receipe.. but because I am going to a party where the kitchen needs help....

I made this as a first course of an 8-course dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, right down to the pistachio oil which I found at a gourmet shop here in Montreal. My husband and I pre-plated the salads about an hour before serving and left them at room temperature. They looked so beautiful (just like in the photo) and all 8 guests cleaned their plates.

Very good salad. Pistachio oil is a must -- adds depth and flavor that would otherwise be missed. We made this for a dinner party last night and all the guests raved. For a wine pairing, a dry rose (rose of pinot noir if you can get one) is an excellent choice.

I've made this salad twice, and received many requests for the recipe. Since I was making it for a group of people, I made it as one salad. I used a one-quart straight sided Pyrex casserole dish, placed a piece of Saran Wrap on the bottom and up the sides of the dish,layered the golden beets, followed by the goat cheese and then the red beets in the casserole dish; I made it the night before. Placed a plate on top of the casserole dish then turned the dish over, removed the Saran Wrap, drizzled the remaining dressing over the salad,sprinkled with pistachios,then put some arugula around the edges of the salad. It was beautiful.

This is such a pretty salad. I actullay made it with 3 layers, as we had deep purple, pink, and golden beets. I wasn't so sure about the dressing, made it with walnut as did others, didn't have shoalots, used sweet onions; but was great! will keep for a great company salad!

I want to plant a big smooch on whomever posted this recipe! I love it. I made with xvoo as I didn't have the $ for pistachio, but will definitely try in the future. I also prepare my beets differently as I think it enhances the natural flavors: in a pan with just enough xvoo & s&p to coat the bottom - place beets (cut in half) cut side down and roast for 45 min to one hour (or until done) on 425. I also used arugula. Yum!!

OK I made this with walnuts (toasted) and walnut oil cause that's what I had.. but it tasted amazing. My bf who claims to not like beets loved it (he also loved the roasted beets w/ horseradish sauce also on this site..hmmm). I didn't do the presentation illustrated in the recipe, as it was just for the 2 of us. I put a small amount of baby arugula on a plate and then put the golden beets on one side, the cheese in the middle, and the red beets on the other side. Sprinkled the toasted walnuts over the whole thing - it still looked nice.

This was fabulous! We made it for a dinner party for 14. We made the recipe exactly as written, found pistachio oil at our local gourmet grocery store. We also made it with olive oil and it was also outstanding (I'm not sure there was a huge difference). We found the 2.5 inch cookie cutters at Sur La Table (Williams Sonoma and a couple of other local stores did not have them; i'm sure there are other work arounds, but it was BEAUTIFUL as made). Highly recommend!

The presentation of this dish, as you can tell from the picture, is amazing! I served it with the Meyer Lemon Semifreddo (but made with only a tbsp of sugar, recipe on this site), cut in about a 1 inch cube and made without the sugar, then drizzled both with aged balsamic. No substitutions, other than olive oil instead of the pistachio, which i'm sure would make the taste even better.

Made this as a starter for a Christmas dinner and it was excellent. I used a pepery extra virgin olive oil instead of pistachio oil, as 8oz of pistacio oil was $49.99 in my area. Only change I would suggest is using a little more dressing to toss with the beets. Otherwise, a great dish!

Oh my, what a fantastic recipe! This was a last addition to a gourmet Christmas Eve menu as a colorful cool side dish and became one of the favorites of several people at the dinner. I used macadamia nut oil as I had it on hand and couldn't quickly locate the pistachio nut oil - not the best substitute although nobody seemed to notice once the dish was complete. I found I need to add some salt to the beets once diced and that the vinaigrette was a little oil-heavy, so I added some Champagne vinegar which worked perfectly. The only other change made was that I used an 8" springform pan to make a single dish. It was absolutely gorgeous. I will definitely make this one again.

This salad was delicious and lovely. I made some modifications due to availability of ingredients. I couldn't find yellow beets so I used the red and for contrasting color segmented some fresh oranges and diced. Since I used the fresh oranges I substituted fresh orange juice instead of lemon juice in the dressing and used almond oil and coarsely chopped almonds since I couldn't get the pistachio oil. My guests were taking pictures of their salad plates they thought it looked so beautiful and when they tasted it they were all asking for the recipe.

Absolutely superb. I had grabbed a package of French pre-cooked cubed beets but at the last minute decided to also buy fresh. Debatable whether it was that much better to do all the work of roasting and cutting to get the color contrast; next time I'll use the packaged kind and compare. Thanks to all who insisted it was important to get pistachio oil. Luckily, the Fairway in NY carries every kind of nut oil under the sun. It was worth it. A restaurant-quality dish in taste and presentation, and the next thing I will make for company!

Really simple to execute, yet looks very elegant. Didn't have pistachio oil, so used cracked pistachios and slowly cooked them in grapeseed oil, then decanted the oil and used in the recipe. The remaining nuts had a delicious toasted flavor and made a great garnish for the salad.

Substituted pistachio oil with sesame oil and, in a pinch, spring onions and a little garlic instead of shallots. Delicious!

I would personally rate at 3 forks but my guests raved about it so it's getting 4. Like many here, I didn't have access to golden beets and so simply used all red. The beets themselves were delicious and roasting them is where it's at. The red hands/mess were worth it. I could've simply eaten the beats on their own. I used walnut oil and would def. splurge for the pistachio oil next time. Also had a hard time stacking the salad and so it came away not nearly as attractive as the picture. All in all, though, it was a winner. Something so different from the typical tossed salad one usually gets at dinner. And, as a bonus, my 9yr old niece scarfed it down.

Stunning. I did not have golden beets and subsituted diced orange instead. I will do this again in the future; it made for a lovely combination of sweet, sour and salty.

Fantastic and unusual salad! Excellent melange of flavours with a gorgeous presentation. Thanks to a previous reviewer for the tip about using an open-ended can as a mold - worked like a charm. Made this as a starter for my gourmet dinner club (entree was the amazing Pistachio Sea Bass with Crab Salad also from Epicurious) and the menu was received with so many moans of pleasure I actually blushed almost as red as the beets! Even the beet skeptics raved about this salad. Suggest you take the time to roast the beets - roasting brings out such a sweet/mellow flavour that really makes this salad extra special. For another outstanding beet recipe, please try the Roasted Beets with Horseradish Cream (from this site) which is also a great way to make/serve this delicious but often underused veggie. Bon appetit!

This is a beautiful recipe and a lovely presentation. The first time I made it I couldn't find the yellow beets so I substituted grapefruit segments and it was wonderful.

Have rarely if ever awarded four forks, but this was absolutely spectacular - the flavors are simple but work incredibly well together, and the presentation makes it worthy of any fine dining restaurant menu.

Superb.

Simply outstanding. I don't agree with elinimating the cookie cutter. It's what makes it so attractive, the alternating layers. I used only red beets. Just use an open-ended can if you don't have a stacker. And use an easier method to cook the beets. Works well with hazelnut oil and pistachio. I've used both.

Was a great first course at last evening's dinner party.It looked beautiful and tasted terrific. I did take the suggestion of several of the others that wrote in and sprinkled it with balsamic vinegar at the end and also added just a dab of dijon mustard to the sauce. It is a messy dish to make, because of the red beets, and was a little time consuming trying to chop the beets in a uniform size.We did overcome the biggest obstacle, which is the cookie cutter and this is what we did. We cut down a large throw away Solo cup to 2" and left the bottom of the cup intact. We then first filled this with the golden beets, then the cheese and finally the red beets. When completed we just flipped it over and Voila!, it was perfect.

Really great recipe! I served it as as first course to beet-loving friends, and they thought it was divine. I made a few changes, only because of what I did/didn't have on hand. I used only red beets, and "stacked" them in a tuna can size mould....about 4" diam, 1" high. I crumbled goat cheese on top. Set that in the center of a pretty plate, and surrounded it with whole toasted hazelnuts. I added a bit of Dijon to the dressing, and the oil was a lemon-infused olive oil. Wonderful, just wonderful!!

I nuked the beets, ends off. That saved LOTS of time. This is a fabulous recipe. So attractive against greens. I also used hazelnut oil and grapeseed 1:1 instead of pistachio. It was so delicious that I wil used toasted hazelnuts next time instead of the pistachios. Definitely one to serve to guests as an appetizer/starter. I used a stacker instead of a cookie cutter (2" tall) for perfect results. Great recipe.

Delicious salad. Don't fret about the cookie cutter--you can dispense with this unnecessarily fussy step and still end up with a great salad that will impress your guests. Pistachio oil can be purchased on the Internet from a number of sources, including freshcaviar.com. California Press, a domestic producer of exotic nut oils, also makes a great pistachio oil, but I understand that they have temporarily ceased production.

Truly a superb recipe. For those of you interested in making pistachio oilToasted .Ingredients: 1/2 pound salted pistachios, shelled 1-1/2 cups olive oil 2 teaspoons kosher salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 350° F. Toast the pistachios for about 4 minutes, or until fragrant. Let cool. Transfer to a food processor and finely grind. In a small saucepan, warm the olive oil over moderate heat. Add the oil to the nuts and process until blended. Pour into a jar, stir in the salt, and let stand overnight at room temperature. The oil can be refrigerated for 2 weeks.

WOW!! This is one of the best salads I have ever tasted, and the presentation is awesome (assuming you can keep the tower from crumbling when you remove the cookie cutter). I have made several times, but cons are: Peeling & chopping the beets is messy & time-consuming; unable to find a 2 1/2 x 2 round cookie cutter (tried everything, even tried finding PVC at Home Depot that width, but with no success) I finally improvised with a cardboard cannister of those awful french-fry-like chips, removed the ends & cut it in half - anyone know where to find a 2 1/2 x 2+ round cookie cutter? Until I was able to find pistachio oil, I made it w/ peanut oil & it was wonderful, although pistachio oil is better in taste & color (though $$$$). Substituted mache w/ watercress & actually like better w/ watercress. Guests are consistently wowed by this, especially those who say they don't like beets or goat cheese! Wonderful with an earthy riesling, e.g. Eroica or Ch. Ste. Michelle Cold Creek.

We made this dish because it was part of the holiday feast menu we used for a carnavale party. The thing is my husband and I do not like beets.
