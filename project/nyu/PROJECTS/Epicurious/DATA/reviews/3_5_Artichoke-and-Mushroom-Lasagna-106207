I didn't have any nutmeg so I substituted cinnamon and allspice. It is amazing.

I made this recently, along with a traditional red sauce lasagna, for a dinner party for 10 and it was a big hit. I followed the recipe exactly except that, for the artichoke hearts, I substituted a jar of Pastene artichoke pesto and it added a lovely rich flavor, plus I didn't have to chop the artichokes. There was plenty of filling, and the guests raved.

I made this twice, once as the recipe stated and thought it was delicious, but like the suggestion about adding spinach since it adds color. I just made it again, but with small shell pasta and baked it. I also added a bit of blue cheese to the sauce for added flavor. I would also double the mushroom and artichokes. The filling would be good alone just as a dip with baguette slices.

Rating: 4
Definitely 1&1/2 the mushrooms and artichokes also 1&1/2 Bechamel. Be careful on the dish not to over fill. Mixed in blend of Percorino/Romano cheese, used fat-free milk and it was still rich and good.

Rating: 4
I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it two days ahead and it worked out really well. As many reviewes suggested, I doubled the filling, but I think that 1.5 the amount of filling would have been adequate. Very rich and hearty especially considering that it is a vegetarian dish.

Rating: 2
I made as directed except that I used wine instead of Pernod. I really just thought the lasagna lacked a key flavor component and was above all, heavy. I know that lasagna tends to be heavy anyway but this one didn't have enough contrast to balance it. It wasn't terrible, just not worthy of making again in my book.

Rating: 4
Made this for me and my SO, and we loved it. I did everything as directed (except I used 18oz of artichokes) and came up a little light on filling by the third layer. Should've read the reviews. Also, this dish will take you a while if you chop and, especially, grate by hand. At an easy pace, it took me a couple hours before it was all wrapped in foil and ready to go. Still, it's a rewarding dish and will get you big points at holidays or special dinners - it really is fantastic. Some prefer canned artichokes for their tamer flavor, but if you love artichokes, frozen are fine.

Very popular with the veggie crowd and as a side dish with ham for the others. Mixed up the mushrooms with a combo of button, bella and morels. It is quite rich, so smaller portions are OK.

My brother made me this dish for my birthday this past weekend, and it was absolutely delicious. Some of the best Italian food I've had since my last visit to Italy in 2005!! He served it with salad and some toasty baguettes that he'd sprinkled with olive oil and rubbed with garlic... it was a perfect birthday lunch! Definitely would make this again! YUM!

Rating: 3
I'm surprised so many people described this as labor intensive or expensive. I didn't really find it to be so and made it on a Tuesday night because we happened to have the ingredients on hand. I think the pan size is important. I used a 13x9 and was able to get three thick layers. Although a lot of reviewers made modifications, I made this exactly as directed and quite liked it. Not every lasagna needs to have ricotta.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! I consulted a lot of the great reviews and doubled the filling, added onion and spinach, used a mix of white, crimini and shitake mushrooms and subbed wine for vermouth. Out of sheer laziness I skipped the homemade bechamel and used two cans of store-bought alfredo sauce with a pinch of nutmeg added. It was very easy to make and delicious. I'm eating the left overs right now, so I have to second the comment that it tastes better heated up!

Rating: 0
I followed the spirit not the letter of the recipe--and took many comments here to heart--using maybe 1/4 more mushrooms, 2 drained cans of quartered artichokes, a bunch of chard (chopped), 4 sizable garlic cloves, white wine, skim milk, and part-skim mozz. I ended up with only three filling layers even then. But all in all a great combination of flavors and textures. I might add handful of grape tomatoes to the filling saute and/or some red pepper flakes--just barely wanted some piquancy. Also, the filling saute was very liquidy; just drained it off--A-OK and good for something later--tasty!

This was an impressive and delicious dish for company. Will make again. Thankful that I read the reviews and made DOUBLE the filling. Would not have been enough by a long shot...

Rating: 4
Decadent dish, an alternative to traditional red sauce lasagne. I'm a lifelong vegetarian, but even an Austrian meateater swore he could happily eat this every week. I've made the dish several times. Here are my changes: I always use canned artichoke hearts; use a mix of fresh and/or dried wild mushrooms (it really adds depth to flavor); add 1 small or 1/2 finely chopped onion to the filling; sub dry white wine for vermouth; and season the filling well with rosemary, pepper, a little crushed red pepper. As all previous reviewers suggest, double the filling. Also, season the bechamel sauce with pepper, be cautious with salt as parmesan is often more salty.

Rating: 4
This dish is excellent BUT do not use frozen artichoke hearts. They have to much "choke" in them.

Rating: 4
I have made this twice and it is delicious. After reading the reviews I increased the filling using 3 packs of artichokes, 2 cups of vermouth, 1.5 lbs of reg. mushrooms and 8 oz of shitake mushrooms. It does take time so I suggest making it, or at least starting it, the day before.

Rating: 3
Very delicious recipe, and popular when I served it at a potluck. I doubled the filling and added an onion, plus a bit of spinach to fill everything out. I also substituted white wine for the vermouth. It is labor intensive, but worth the effort for a special occasion.

Rating: 4
I thought this was a great recipe, relatively easy to make but would make and being vegetarian this one definitely fit the bill. I would, however, make some changes for the next time around: As other reviewers have noted, you must double the filling. As is, you will only get 2 layers maximum and the dish will be mostly noodles. Cut back on the butter, there's a lot of flavor from the other rich, creamy ingredients, you don't need all the butter. Added about an extra cup of grated parmesan to the bechamel sauce and the results were fabulous. My husband and I have been enjoying the leftovers all week. We plan to make this again.

Rating: 2
Overall I found the outcome only mediocre. The recipe itself is easy to follow, but I had several issues with it: * The bechamel sauce is under-flavored. I significantly increased the amount of parmesan cheese. Even then, an alfredo sauce would have had a stronger and more satisfying flavor. * The cook time for the filling was vastly underestimated, as it took much longer than 10 minutes to absorb and cook off the liquid. * The filling would need to be close to doubled. There was not nearly enough to complete the recipe. Even if easy to follow, this recipe took several hours to prepare. I would have found a traditional vegetarian lasagna much more satisfying, as well as more tasty.

Rating: 0
Taste not worth the calories. Instead, I would recommend using a lemon Alfredo. Less calories and a much more flavorful dish. Also, it's great paired with a '97 Sterling Reserve Cabernet or an 86' french champagne.

Rating: 2
Considering the ingredients, the outcome of this recipe is just OK. But considering the ingredients, it still tastes fantastic. I have made this twice, incorporating a lot of the changes suggested by others: I doubled the filling (only 2T butter) using fresh artichokes, the addition of 2 shallots, spinach, and marsala rather than vermouth. I used 1.5X the Bechamel, which greatly improved the creaminess. Otherwise, it is simply too dry. I used 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 fontina. The fontina was a great addition. Finally, I only used 2 layers of filling. This is a special occasion dish, very decadent and very expensive.

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe. This is a substantial vegetarian dish able to please even the biggest carnivores. I did however add some spinach to the filling, I thought the green looked great in the dish. And as mentioned by others, the filling does need to be doubled if you want a hearty lasagna.

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe! The bechamel intimidated me, but was really quite easy. The only change I made was layering, and I don't see how one could get 4 layers from ingredients. Mine went: sauce, noodle, veggie, sauce, cheeses, noodle, veggie, sauce, cheeses, noodle, sauce, parmesan. It worked out perfectly. I like others idea of adding a ricotta layer, so maybe I'll try that next time.

Rating: 4
I also increased the filling slightly which gave it a heartier taste, and then used fresh pasta. I made this for my new Italian relatives and my father-in-law said it was the best lasagna he ever had! I will definitely make again, it's worth the effort.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! The only changes I made to the recipe were (1) substituting 1/2 of the mozzarella with fontina, which added a wonderful complexity,and, (2) sprinkled the top with chopped pistachios, which provided a lovely crunchy texture to the creamy smoothness of this dish.

Rating: 3
Like others, I think the ingredients need to be doubled. In my case worked perfeclty because I made it in a smaller dish for four people and turned out delicious! Definately will make it again!

I didn't make the recipe as is. Because of my husband's preferences, I used 16 oz broccoli instead of artichokes and left out the vermouth. I also added a layer made from 1 pd ricotta, 4 handfulls of fresh spinach (steamed and drained), and 1 egg, which I put on top of the pasta layer. I think I only got 3 layers of pasta in there total, because I didn't have enough veggies for more layers. Still, we both really enjoyed this, and I would make it again.

Rating: 3
OK, so I did a lot of tweaking to make this recipe a little less caloric. Still, the general idea was the same and it turned out delicious. I used olive oil in the veggie mixture instead of butter, and light butter to make the sauce. Also used 1% milk for the sauce instead of whole milk. I, like others who have reviewed this recipe, added a layer of low fat ricotta/egg in addition to the veggies and sauce. For the cheese on the top I used a low fat italian cheese blend. Also subbed canned artichokes for frozen and added extra mushrooms. Despite cutting a lot of the fat and calories, the dish was still really rich. Very tasty. The nutmeg is absolutely crucial to this dish, as is the garlic.

I doubled the recipe filling, using 1/3 for each layer, and used canned artichoke hearts. Next time I will make another later and triple the filling because this came out very flat (I used four noodles and a 14 x 9 inch pan). It was delicious, but I think the filling was "missing something". Maybe I will try a little ricotta in there next time.

This has become a regular dish in our home. My husband loves it and when we have family and friends over its always a success.

If youre looking for a no-fail crowd pleaser, this is it.

This was quite a tasty dish, though I halved the béchamel sauce, and prepared a simple tomato sauce (one can tomato sauce, one can tomato paste). The tomato sauce was used in the top layer instead of the béchamel. I also added spinach to the layers for extra flavours and nutrition. I agree with the reviewers that more mushrooms are needed, and next time I would also add onion.

Rating: 3
this is a really good veggie lasagna, still very filling and solid w/o meat. I use canned artichokes (a little more than is called for) and some onion thrown in if I have some around the house. Also, I think the nutmeg make a big difference, really adds to the flavor don't leave it out unless you really don't like nutmeg

Rating: 4
This dish is fantastic! I made a few modifications that really enhanced it. I reduced the mozzarella to 8 oz. and added a 15oz. container of ricotta. Next time I will combine the mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, and 1 egg in the food processor to make it more spreadable. To the filling I added 2 tsp. grated lemon rind and appx. 2 T. chopped fresh Italian parsley. The lemon really added a nice brightness to the dish.

Rating: 4
Stellar and hearty. If I make this again, I'll definitely increase the amount of mushrooms and add a bit of variety. For those wondering where the flavor is, here are two suggestions: 1) Do not forgoe the nutmeg. In fact, if you like that sort of subtle, comfortable flavor, add a little more. 2) Instead of using frozen artichoke hearts, buy marinated hearts (e.g. Vigo brand) that come room temperature in a jar. Just make sure to drain them completely first.

Rating: 3
I have been making this recipe for several years now and while it can take a bit of effort it is not crazily labor intensive. There are two modifications that I have made though. First, I substitute dry white wine for the vermouth as the vermouth though dry still gave the dish a bit too much sweetness for my taste. I also do not use the nutmeg. All in all a nice recipe that works well in cooler or warmer weather.

Excellent. I started making this about 5 years ago when the recipe came out and have made it dozens of times since. It is one of those things that just gets better in the fridge over time. I used quartered canned artichokes, and they work perfectly. I also use the flat style lasagna noodles.

we love this with a few additions -more mushrooms,onion & spinach are a must & I added 1c toasted pine nuts to the filling at the end - use eggroll wrappers for the noodles - they are fast,lighter & more like the fresh ones you'll find in Italy - cut the cooking time down to 35 - 45 min. w/ them too - enjoy !!!

This is fantastic! I've made the following adjustments w/ success: use canned artichoke hearts and chop them in the food processor, use sherry instead of vermouth. I also use fresh shiitake mushrooms from a local grower that work very nicely. Definitely double the mushrooms.

Delicious. After reading other reviews here, I made the following changes: Doubled the quantity of mushrooms and used a mix of bellas and ordinary white mushrooms, sauteed a finely chopped (large!) onion with the garlic before adding 'shrooms, and used dry white wine and one can of artichokes for the mushroom mix. I made the Parmesan bechamel as per the recipe, and despite using no-cook lasagna sheets, I cooked them in boiling salted water for 5 minutes before assembling the lasagna. It made 3 decent mushroom layers and served 6 people for dinner with salad and ciabatta. It's a tasty, fairly easy vegetarian dish which appeals to non-vegies also and was a big success!

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious. I took other reviewers' advice and added not one but two onions and sauteed them right before adding the mushrooms. Awesome! I do wonder whether fewer layers with more to them might be better, but that remains to be seen. I may try just two layers (plus the top) next time. Having said that, my husband and I absolutely loved this!

Rating: 0
Not a review, just a comment. I have glanced at six recipes that are part of extolling fresh artichokes, in season now, delicious, and each recipe has called for CANNED or FROZEN artichoke hearts. I like them and use them, but they're expensive and they're NOT FRESH.

I used cooked noodles; I really don't like the no-boils, as I can't figure out what you're supposed to do with that crunchy top layer...maybe it's me. I also added an onion and used extra mushrooms. I used baby portabellos and porcinis and two cans of artichoke hearts. Good recipe.

Made it for a party and everyone loved it. A little dab'll do you, though--it is rich. I added onion and, since I'm a garlic fan, upped it to 6 good-sized cloves. Added more than the suggested amount of 'shrooms for an even "meatier" meat-free dish. I also used drained artichokes in oil with great results.

I decided to tackle this recipe with what I had in my fridge/pantry and it came out great with these changes...I didn't have any vermouth so I just left it out, I added chopped onion, spinach, and zucchini to the mushrooms, I made lots of the bechamel and left out the mozarella slices. It was delish and just goes to show that cooking is not an exact science. Try this and have fun.

Rating: 4
Made this and another lasagna for 20 people after a wine tasting- they are still raving about it. I added the suggested onion with good results. Noting the advice of needing more mushroom flavour I added a package of Knorr wild mushroom soup. Cheating? yes but Wow what great flavour. I made less of the bechamel and thinned it somewhat slowly spooning in the soup mix over some time until I got the texture and flavour right- I could have just eaten the sauce! It was my first time using oven ready noodles & they were great and a wonderful time saver! I served it with sauteed then baked parmesan chicken thighs, a huge arugula salad with a lemon vinagrette, shaved parmesan and crusty Italian bread. Made the 'four favorite tiramisu' for dessert!

I sauteed a whole chopped onion and added it to the mix for moisture, along with a package of re-hydrated wild mushrooms for more intense mushroom flavor. I made it with cooked noodles, and added ricotta cheese. Five layers of pasta is too much; I did it with four, with only three layers of filling, including the rocotta, mozzarella, parmasan and bechamel in each layer, and a layer of ricotta, mozzarella and bechamel on the top. Had three vegetarians among my 8 dinner guests, and everyone slupped it up!

I almost want to give this four forks. I've made this twice now, both times for company, and everyone has LOVED it. It's delicious. I used shiitake mushrooms, 2% milk and part skim mozz and it was perfect. I had no trouble with running out of filling or bechamel. (Doubling the filling & sauce would make for a more dense & saucy lasanga, but I don't think it's necessary since it's quite rich.) The vermouth gives it the unique & wonderful flavor. This one is a keeper!

I thought this was a good basic recipe, although I made a few changes. I found the color of the stuffing a bit bland, so I added some roasted red pepper as well as spinach to the filling. I also found that I only got two layers of filling, so I would make more next time. I used portobello mushrooms and crimini mushrooms, and also added some porcini stock (leftover from using procinis earlier) to the filling just before adding the vermouth. I also added some italian herbs to the filling. I used regular noodles and I did soften them before cooking. I agree with someone else that I didn't think it needed a full hour; I cooked it for 40 minutes or so. For the mozzarella, I used some fresh soft mozzerella, which had a nice, creamy result. I doubled the recipe to make two for a party, and it was a hit. I'd definitely make it again, especially for a make-ahead dinner.

I've made this for two baby showers, and got rave reviews each time.

I normally HATE vegi lasagnas, but this tastes like pasta with alfredo sauce... It's really great!

This recipe was not great, and I regret using it for a dinner party (with one vegetarian). While the flavor of the filling was very good, the overall colors of white & brown, certainly had no beauty. Also, while the sauce seemed ample when I made it, it was completely absorbed by the no-cook lasagna, resulting in a solid mass (albeit a rich one, rather than overall creamy product.

It turned out to be the best lasagna I've ever tasted & every guest asked for a second serving!

I was suprised at how easy the bechamel sauce was to make! That said, I was also suprised, then, that the lasagna was not very creamy. It was instead, quite greasy or oily. The flavor was good - I used shitakes, creminis, and reconstituted dried porcinis for the mushrooms. I replaced some of the vermouth, then, with the strained water from the porcinis. We also used very good parmesan. I made this for a dinner party where half the guests were vegetarian, as am I. But, I don't think I'll make this again. The ingredients ingredients make it a dietary splurge, but the texture is not creamy enough to make it worth it.

We are big meat eaters here but everyone scoffed up this dish. The one thing I did do differently is that I cooked it for 20 minutes at a high heat (the filling is cooked, the pasta doesn't need more than 20 minutes, I couldn't see the point in leaving it in the oven for an hour).

BEING MARRIED TO A VEGETARIAN, I HAVE ALSO PREPARED THE BROCCOLI, MUSHROOM AND RICOTTA LASAGNA. HOWEVER, YOUR RECIPE FAR SURPASSED MY PAST VEGETARIAN RECIPE. I SUPPOSE I COULD HAVE EVEN ADDED THE BROCCOLI TO YOUR RECIPE. ALSO, I TOOK THE ADVICE FROM SOME OF YOUR PAST REVIEWS AND ADDED THE SPINACH. I USED A CORNING WARE DISH TO BAKE IT. ALTHOUGH, INSTEAD OF COOKING IT FOR 1 HR. IN THE CORNING WARE, I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT OUT AFTER ONLY 50-MINUTES. OTHER THAN THE TIMING, IT WAS DELECTABLE. I EVEN SHARED IT WITH MY NEIGHBOR. KEEP THEM COMING! THANKS!

This recipe is fantastic. I chose to use portabello mushrooms and spinach, also. I would recommend this to anyone!! I used FF mozz. cheese, and skim milk, and 1/2 FF margerine- 1/2 butter and you couldn't notice it at all. With the whole milk, butter and whole milk cheese replaced, this is a very low fat recipe.

This is wonderful! A bit time consuming, but worth it. I used 2 cans of artichoke hearts instead of frozen & added more mushrooms. Also used 2% milk and it was still very rich. Will definitely make this again.

A FRIEND OF MINE MADE THIS DELICIOUS LASAGNA FOR US AND IT WAS SOOOOOO GOOD. SHE ADDED 1 CUP OF ROASTED PINE NUTS WHICH MADE IT EXTRA TASTY. I AM GOING TO MAKE IT THIS WEEK. IT IS THE BEST LASAGNA I HAVE EVER TASTED.

Delicious! Even used canned vs frozen artichokes; fat free 1/2 & 1/2 plus skim milk versus whole milk and skim mozz cheese versus whole and it still was exceptional! I doubled the filling, added portobello mushrooms and sauteed spinach. I did only use 1 1/3 cup vermouth. Cooking time was greater than one hour . . .1.5 hours or so.

Fabulous. I also doubled the filling, adding fresh baby spinach to it toward the end of the cooking time (just until wilted). Didn't double the sauce, used low-fat milk and it was great! A keeper.

This was a nice change from traitional lasagna. Great for entertaining because you can make it a day ahead. I doubled the filling plus added baby spinach. I also found it took a full 1lb of lasagna noodles (I used regular noodles instead of no-bake and it worked fine). Next time I will double the sauce.

Excellent dish. I always use skim milk for bechamel with very good results. Try adding a bit of fresh ground nutmeg...it complements the flavors nicely.

I used non fat evalporated milk and it came out great. As suggested I doubled the veggies, added some spinach and used less of the sauce. A nice change

this recipe was a big hit with my family - reheats very well also. i agree with the other reviewers - i would make more of the artichoke-mushroom (i used portabella) mixture and less of the bechamel. used the excess bechamel to dress up leftover whipped potatoes - just add the sauce while whipping - brilliant!

I agree you need to double or triple the filling. I used portabello mushrooms and added spinach as well. It was delicious!

This was a real hit for our holiday dinner party. Everyone raved, and was great to have as an alternative to the meat served. I used portabello mushrooms, with the artichokes, and was very tasty. I will keep this in my file for future use!

This was an amazing lasagna! Instead of using the frozen artichokes (which I can never find), I used two cans of hearts. I also used 2 1/4 cups of whole milk and 2 1/4 cups of skim instead of all whole. I used fresh mozzerella instead of store bought and it was fantastic! As suggested by another reviewer, I may try this as an appetizer, to cut up in small squares after it cools a bit. Definitely a company meal!

My boyfriend made this recipe for me... it was impressive, and made a romantic meal with a loaf of crusty garlic bread and a simple salad. I am a big fan of both mushrooms and artichokes, and noticed that this recipe brings out their respective flavors quite nicely, without masking them. The frozen artichokes taste miraculously like fresh-roasted ones. This recipe earned some big brownie points, and it also reheats deliciously.

I used Portobello mushrooms and have made it about 12 times. Everyone who tries it asks for the recipe. Cut it into bite size pieces and it makes a great appetizer.

Made this for eight people, and made sure to make extra filling since many reviewers mentioned not having enough. Used mixed wild mushrooms and white mushrooms, also used 2% milk for bechemel sauce and it was still nice and rich. Came out great- made with regular lasagna noodles (not oven ready) and put together the day before, let sit in fridge all night. Really is a great dish if you have many people over since it is rich and you don't need a large portion. Just toss a salad, blanch some asaparagus, slice some crusty bread and you have a wonderful winter meal.

Made this for a group of people and I was asked for the recipe immediately. I added a bit more garlic and garlic salt because I thought it needed more of a kick. Will try it with a few different varieties of mushrooms next time.

This dish was absolutely delicious, made especially for a vegetarian friend who raved about it. I used mixed mushrooms and only the most tender pieces of artichoke. I made a half recipe because I really didn't need a whole one and it was fine. I also served it as recommended with a fresh salad, crusty bread and great Barbera. It was perfect!

I have made twice now. The layering is confusing but I just do what seems best and looks good. It has always turned out. My guests always ask for the receipe. Also, I have received great comments from those who are real meat eaters.

I love this! Many others found it too heavy...but I found it to be fabulous...just like I knew it would be based on the ingredients. Excellent and I will most certainly make it again.

I used low-fat mozzarella and 2% milk for the recipe. Even with these adjustments, the recipe was still rich, but in a good way. I also used canned artichoke hearts (Qty 2), instead of frozen. Overall, very tasty and filling recipe. Great for a party when you have a vegetarian and meat-eating men.

Rating: 2
I'm giving this two stars based on original recipe with no modifications (which is how I made it). I agree with many of the reviewers that the amount of filling needs to be doubled. Also, my sauce seemed too thick and too sparse for the amount of pasta. Maybe try using 2% milk or doubling the quantity. I thought the Parmesan dominated the dish; I would use less Parmesan in the future.

I really liked this recipe. I added about a pound of a mild ground italian sausage and tried the baby bello mushrooms at suggested previously.

Great recipe with a new twist on lasagna. I also used baby bello mushrooms and sweet sausage which definitely gave it an edge. Would do it again without a second thought. Using the precooked pasta made preparation very easy.

After reading the reviews I made this with sausage as well to make it hardier. I found it very delicious and am looking forward to making it again soon.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I took the suggestion and added 3 mild itlaian sausages for my meat eating crowd. But would make it a la vegetarisn style as well. The only other notes that I would make about the recipe is that I used less layers than it called for. Also, next time I will double the mushroom & artichoke mixture. It could have used more :) Was very happy with the outcome.

I couldn't find frozen artichokes so I used 2 cans. I also used cremini mushrooms and 2 small spicy italian sausages which i crumbled and pan-fried beforehand. I lightened up with skim milk for the sauce and part skim cheese. Thanks to the reviewers for the suggestions, this lasagna was very impressive!!!

Rating: 3
This is very good and I had no problems with the layering. I used skim milk, canned artichoke hearts (my grocer did not have frozen) and part skim mozzerella. I did add an extra can of artichoke hearts. I made this this day before I cooked it so that the flavors would mingle together. The leftovers were incredible even a few days later.

Rating: 3
A very good dish. I also used 2% milk, part-skim mozzarella, and jar of artichoke hearts -- it didn't seem to make a difference. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8"-square baking dish. Next time I will use the full amount of mushroom/artichoke mix, since I seemed to run out of them. This was delicious and not difficult (just a bunch of steps, as with any lasagne).

Rating: 3
This was a bit too rich for my taste, but was good indeed. My husband likes "meat" in his lasagna, so I made 1/2 with crumbled Italian sausage and 1/2 without. Both were good, but the sausage really blends in great with the shrooms and artichokes. I used 1 can of water packed artichokes (around 15 oz can). Try with a nice red wine. Bon Appetite!

Very good. As other mentioned I lightened this with skim milk and no one noticed. Next time I may add some crumbled sweet sausage to add some flavor.

I made this lasagna as a main dish for Easter dinner. Everyone enjoyed it thorougly. I would definitely make it again. The only problem I encountered with the recipe is the fact it took about 20 minutes, not 10 for the liquid to be absorbed. Just as I started to think I should drain off some of the liquid, I decided to turn up the heat from medium to high and after a few minutes of stirring the liquid was completely abosorbed. Now I'd know the next time and have no problem whatsoever. It was the first time I made a Béchemel sauce. Very easy. I'd use the recipe again for other dishes. The lasagna was a crowd pleaser. Try it!

Rating: 2
I found the layering thing a bit confusing also and ended up just working it out on the last layer. I also had a problem with the liquid not boiling out of my mushroom/artichoke mixture and had to drain. The whole thing was too labor intensive, I will keep looking for another recipe.

This recipe is like the omelet of lasagnas: you can add almost anything and it will still be delicious! Try it with less artichoke, more mushroom, and some crumbled sweet sausage. Yum!

My husband loved this. I used white wine instead of the vermouth because I was out of vermouth. I also used two drained cans of artichoke hearts. I would love to lighten it a bit and try it with low fat milk and part skim mozzarella. Great recipe!

Excellent lasagna recipe! I used a mixture of baby bellas and dried porcinis for the mushrooms. Also substituted 1% milk and skim milk mozarella, and it still tasted very rich. I let it sit overnight in the refrigerator, and baked it the next day for dinner. Everyone loved it!

There is nothing like a "white" lasagna and this one is great! I used Barilla no boil noodles and they actually tasted homemade. I did slim the recipe down a bit and used skim milk and part skim mozzarella. The freshly grated parmesan cheese really made the bechamel creamy. I used a exotic mushroom mix which tasted great. Just be careful to really drain the artichokes before incorporating them into the recipe. I am making this for Easter dinner and my family cannot wait!!

I just made this last night, and my husband and I are in lasagna heaven! It was a little too labor intensive for a weeknight meal, but I'll definately make it for a special weekend dinner or when guests come to town. The mushrooms had such wonderful texture and flavor, and they held up very well throughout the cooking time. I couldn't find frozen artichokes, so I substituted one can of non-marinated artichoke hearts, and I felt that was plenty. Let me stop typing so I can go eat the leftovers!

Definitely a rich dish! It needs some calorie and fat adjustments, but I would make it again. I also think it would be a great dish that can be made ahead 1 day before a party. If ya'll enjoyed this recipe, try the butternut squash and hazelnut lasagne. A friend made it and I'm so looking forward to tasting the flavors again. Yum!

Accustomed to "enlightened" pasta dishes, I found this lasagna somewhat heavy. The flavors are wonderful, however, and it merits some tinkering to make it less calorific. It can be made less fatty by using skim milk for the bechamel, using partly skimmed mozzarella (and perhaps less of it--say, 3/4 lb. instead of a whole pound), and using a small amount of olive oil for sauteing the mushroom-artichoke mixture. It tastes just as good this way, I promise. The cooking time seems inordinately long for a lasagna using the no-boil noodles. Next time, I'm going to bake it for 35-40 minutes covered, then 10 at the higher temperature uncovered. It freezes well, reheats in the microwave. A keeper in my book.

Very cheesy! A little bit on the heavy side. May need to serve it with a steamed green vegetable. On the whole, a very good dish. I used egg roll wrappers for the noodles, and it worked great!

When I read the recipe I thought the sauce and cheese were disproportionate to the vegetables. I added 1/2 pound protabellos ( dark gills removed) and another box of artichoke hearts. The result was well balanced and delicious. My husband and friends have already requested this dish again.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make, very tasty, and worth making again. It makes a nice vegetarian dish that you can add things to, such as spinach, or you can add chicken if you would rather have meat. The bechamel sauce blends very nicely with the ingredients. Good brunch dish.

This is fabulous and very rich. Next time I will cut down on the cheese as it was a little overwhelming.

This is a fantastic recipe, very easy. I was afraid that the bechamel would overwhelm the mushroom/artichoke filling, but they were very nicely balanced. It is quite rich, so a simple green salad is really all that's needed to round it out.

I made this dish for a bunch of guys and they all loved it, even though it was vegetarian. I used sliced portobella mushrooms and half the artichoke hearts. I substituted a box of frozen chopped spinach for the left-out half of artichoke hearts. I also substituted marsala wine instead of vermouth.

Rating: 2
I found this recipe to be too rich. The ratio of cream and cheese to mushroom/artichoke filling seemed to high. I also found the vermouth taste a bit distracting. Overall, however, I enjoyed the taste and think the dish would be successful alongside a large salad.
