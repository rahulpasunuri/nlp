I doubled the recipe and did rounded amounts of all the spices. I upped the pumpkin to cups (instead of scant a cup) and used only 3.75 cups sugar. I used a hand mixer. I also used Non-stick spray and a flour dusting on my pans. The bread came out gorgeous- spicy and moist with a slightly crunchier exterior. Next time i might back off the clove a bit but it is still edlicious. It is especially wonderful with a little bit of cream cheese on top. Yum.

I should add to my comments below that when I found this recipe on epicurious, I realized I had the cookbook it comes from so I used the cookbook recipe. I just realized that cookbook version calls for less sugar, no oil, and different spices than the recipe listed here on epicurious. I didn't realize the recipes were so different. So my comments do not reflect the recipe printed here, online. Sorry about that.

This bread is lovely despite the half-awake mess I made of it this morning in my rush to have something to serve for breakfast. What happened? I was doubling the recipe. I realized I'd put too little sugar into the batter--thank god I caught my mistake before it was too late. Fixed that. The batter seemed too runny so I added another bit of flour. Tasted it and couldnt understand why the spices werent coming through so I added another dose of spices. Something still seemed off but I couldnt put my finger on it. So I poured the batter into the pans anyway, popped them into the oven, closed the door, stood up, and there on the counter was the entire bowl of ALL THE DRY INGREDIENTS I'D NEGLECTED TO ADD. So I pulled the pans out of the oven, dumped their contents into the dry ingredients and mixed them together. Mixed in an extra egg as compensation for that extra flour I'd added. Cleaned the pans. Resprayed them. Poured the batter back in. Popped them back into the oven. Came out great! Yum. I've made this before, and I've made Flay's Pumpkin Bread Pudding too. (I'm allergic to corn so I can't eat Indian Pudding anymore, but his PBPud compensates for it nicely!) No rating... just wanted to share that I made a mess of it yet it still tasted great!

This is about a perfect recipe. My kid stopped eating sandwiches in his lunch, and I made this, added sliced apples with peanut butter, and it was a great lunch. Whole wheat pastry flour works, of course.

Excellent recipe. The texture was perfect - super moist but not at all dense. Flavor was complex and interesting. Go ahead and double the recipe and use the whole can - you are going to need two loaves.

WHOA. This recipe is spectacular! I love pumpkin, and this recipe exceeds all others I've tried. I will definitely make this all through the holidays this year. The other comments were super helpful, so I'll add my modifications to the fray. Like everyone else, I doubled the recipe. But I used half whole wheat and half spelt flour, used heaping portions of spices, omitted the cloves (because I'm not a fan) and substituted ground ginger. I added the zest of one orange and instead of water, I used Knudsen's Morning Blend (an orange-pineapple style juice) because I had some, except I only used 1 cup instead of 1 1/3 cup. Most importantly, I made my own roasted pumpkin mash (I didn't have canned pumpkin but I did have a huge jack o' lantern!), which I cut with whole yogurt, maybe 1/2 cup. My god, this cakey bread is MOIST and delicious!

Followed reviewers' tips. Added 1.5x spices. Substituted ginger for cloves and apple sauce for veg oil. Used 1/2 c. brown and 1/2 c. white sugar. Sweet enough. Used 1/3 c. water. Moist enough. Baked in cupcake foils for 15 min. Offered to make cream cheese frosting but kids liked as is.

I just made this recipe for gifts for the Holidays. Doubled it made 8 mini loafs . Delicious! Tender, not too sweet, or too much spice. Reflect tastes for the season.

This recipe was easy and the bread has come out lovely and moist. However, it is much too sweet for me. A cup and a half of sugar? I should've realised that it would be far too much. I hate ultra-sweet things and this is so sweet it's like nibbling on sugar cane. I'll try it again because the recipe was so easy, but I'm halving the sugar and ditching the cloves altogether.

This was, unfortunately, the worst bread I have ever made. I have made banana, lemon and orange loafs with no problem. I did increase the spices as some of the reviewers suggested and did not use allspice and substituted 1/4 cup butter instead of vegetable oil (I try to not to bake with hydrogenated oils). Otherwise I followed it exactly. The bread was raw in the middle and I even increased the cooking time by 15 minutes. I think the cloves were overwhelming in the bread and I should have just used a grated ginger instead to give it a nice spice. The bread was actually inedible and I had to toss it :(

This pumpkin bread was delicious. I made my own pumpkin puree using kabocha pumpkin and like others, I increased the spices (about 1.5 times the called for amount) and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup light brown. I also added pecans. So light...this will be my go-to now!

I had no idea pumpkin bread could be so fluffy and light. I've made three loaves in the past month since I discovered the recipe, and plan to bring this to family for Thanksgiving. A nice treat for breakfast or a snack.

This recipe is amazing! Nothing says Fall like the blend of sweetness and spices in this bread. Based on other reviews, I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger and cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable. It baked up tall, but kept its shape when I sliced it. I live in FL, so it only needed 55 minutes of baking. Overall this bread was super moist, perfectly sweet, and showcased the pumpkin taste with the perfect amount of spices. I will be making this again and again!

Like most everyone else, I doubled the recipe. I always forget when I do that and only used half the fat and it was still super moist. I also only used half the sugar and it was plenty sweet. I also used pie filling, no problem. I threw a few papitas on top for decoration. The texture was way more cake-y than bread-y. The top spilled over like a muffin so of course I ate the 'muffin top' while it was still hot. Good thing I made two loaves.

Delicious bread. I cut the sugar to 1 cup. I added more pumpkin and a bit more flour to offset the additional pumpkin. Added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger. I also split the flour into half white/ half wheat. I always enjoy other reader's reviews as I benefit from their experience, thanks!

Seriously unimpressive, and I make quick breads without any trouble on a regular basis. This was dense and bland, even with extra pumpkin and ginger added. Nothing like the spicy, pumpkin-y bread I had hoped for, but should be alright with a flavored cream cheese.

The bread turns out amazing! I would definitely reduce the sugar to 1 cup, as that was plenty sweet for me. I made this using half whole-wheat flour and increased the pumpkin to just over a cup. Agree with other reviewers about the spice modifications.

I've made pumpkin bread dozens of times from nearly as many recipes but this one is by far the best. The texture, sweetness and spices were perfect. -- I'm a high altitude baker, 5100 ft, so the adjustments I made were: a) using a full cup of the pumpkin (instead of the "scant" the recipe called for) and b) adding 2 T of flour. I used a glass loaf pan at 350 and the loaf was perfect at 1 hour and 5 minutes of baking and no overflow. -- I used walnut oil for the vegetable oil (for no other reason than I had some to use up.) -- This will be my go-to recipe from now on. I might add another half teaspoon of cinnamon and I'll play with adding a pinch of ginger, or some grated orange rind or substituting OJ for the water as others have suggested.

This is the second time I have made this pumpkin bread. It's flavor is awesome, though I do add pecans to mine. However, the size of the pan is too small for the amount of batter and how much it rises. Both times I have doubled the recipe, so that I can just use the whole can of pumpkin. The first time I made this, I had a little bit of overflow with one of the pans. But this time, both pans are overflowing and the batter is burning on the oven floor. What a mess! Could easily have made 3 loaves with the amount of batter.

Love the recipe...so easy to make!! I doubled the recipe based on reviewers recommendations but when I doubled the sugar, three cups of sugar seemed obscene. So here's what I used...1 cup white, 1 cup light brown and 1/2 cup molasses. Probably still too much. I may use 1 cup molasses next time and 1/2 cup white. Oh yes, added 1 tsp ground ginger and the house smells amazing.

This is a wonderful recipe for a delicious bread. I'm going to try a pinch of ground ginger next time. My husband is going through a series of dental implant surgeries and his diet is so restricted now where grains and nuts are concerned. So this is his source of fibre that he is loving. And I'm loving making it and having it around for a quick snack.

I've made lots of pumpkin bread and this is among the best. Comes together in a matter of minutes, moist without being gooey, and not too dense. I accidentally added only half of the cinnamon called for and no nutmeg and thought it was perfect that way. I also threw in mini chocolate chips...

This is my new go-to recipe for pumpkin bread. It is so light and fluffy. I really think it's in the technique and because it doesn't use the whole can of pumpkin. Using the paddle attachment is genius - you don't overmix, resulting in a delicate sweet bread!

Doubled this recipe - it is light, delicate, yet packs in the flavour! I did 12 muffins (1/3 cup batter) for 15 minutes at 350 plus I had enough batter for 2- 8 inch loaves, baked for 50 minutes in convection. Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is a really good recipe - not greasy and very moist. I double it to make two loafs and use the whole can of pumpkin.

This is an excellent base pumpkin bread recipe to play with. I've made it 3 times now. First time I followed it as written but reduced the sugar by 1/3 and subbed about half the franken-oil with greek yogurt. I thought it was a bit dry, so the 2nd time I reduced the sugar by nearly 1/2 but added dark chocolate chips and more greek yogurt. Third time I decided to sub all of the franken-oil with coconut oil, still keeping several tablespoons of greek yogurt in the mix and reducing sugar by about half, adding a few tablespoons of maple syrup. Agree with other reviewers on measuring spices generously - I did about 1.5x of each. Moist, flavorful and addictive. Can't wait to try it as a bread pudding, with raisins, nuts, etc. Yum!

This is hands down the best pumpkin bread I've made. Not too dense, not too cakey, perfect texture. I did add a little extra of each of the spices. I also added chopped walnuts which went really well with the flavors and added a little crunch.

Wow, this is good. Just go ahead and make a double batch, use your entire can of pumpkin , and have two loaves. They go fast! I used the spices called for, and only increased the cinnamon slightly. They were perfectly spiced loaves. Only other change was using a combination of white and brown sugar, instead of just white.

One of the best pumpkin breads ever! I did substitute 1/2 Cup brown sugar for white sugar. Great flavor and texture.

The best pumpkin bread I've made. The flavor is excellent, but what set it apart is that it baked evenly. I often find that loaf breads are tough on the outside by the time you bake them all the way through the inside, and I have to cut off the ends. This one was tender all the way through. I placed a layer of parchment paper in the pan as well, which may have helped, and certainly made it come out easily. I also added walnuts to the batter and placed a few on top about 3/4 of the way through the baking.

Since I made this for the bread pudding, I reduced the sugar to about 3/4 cup, which was sweet enough once the custard soaked in and had the two dessert sauces. A very good, easy bread recipe.

Rating: 4
I don't have a lot to add; I had the same great result as everyone else here. I followed most of the user suggestions, including measuring the spices very generously, swapping applesauce for the oil, using sugar and honey instead of just sugar, cutting the overall sugar by about a third, subbing cider for the water, and experimenting with chocolate chips. I tripled the recipe and was glad I did. My family gobbled up one loaf the first day, we saved a second for the bread pudding, and I put some mini-loaves with chocolate chips in the freezer to give away during the holidays. Big pay-off for such a quick and easy recipe.

I live in Paris France where I do not think canned pumpkin exists so I have always made my own. Roasted a couple small sugar pumpkins until very soft, a few whirls in the food processor and I have puréed pumpkin. I don't know if this recipe is good with the canned stuff but I thought it was an excellent recipe. I made as is except I also omitted cloves and allspice, but added 1/2 tsp extra cinnamon. Beautiful orange hue and moist delicious bread for snack time.

A very nice pumpkin bread. After reading the reviews I decided to use the granulated maple sugar I had in the pantry with just a touch of white (so likely cut it by about 1/3), used Penzey's Vietnam cinnamon and rounded measures of all the rest. Substituted apple cider for the water and put in a swirl of some cream cheese/marshmallow cream/pumpkin fruit dip I had extra of! Probably can't replicate exactly again, but sure enjoying this experiment.

I took some of the other review's mods and was VERY happy with the result! My bread was light, moist, and cake-like. I omitted the oil and reduced the sugar to 1c (3/4 sugar and 1/4 honey) - perfect amount to taste the sweetness and the flavor of the honey. Also doubled the spices - they did not overwhelm but blended just right. Also used fresh buttercup pumpkin which gave it a bright, clean taste (screw canned anything!)

Excellent, excellent. I added a habdful of chocolate chips to the batter and then sprinkled quite a few on the top. Outstanding, I have to make more today.

I used this recipe as base. I cut the oil, and substituted half the sugar for honey (although I also cut the total of the combined sugar/honey down by about a 1/3 of a cup), giving it more flavor but keeping it nice and moist. After mixing up the batter, I tasted it and decided it was a little bland, so I ended up 1 1/2-ing most of the spices for some extra flavor. Turned out REALLY well to compliments all around. It disappeared quickly. I also threw in some chopped up candied ginger for a little extra zing but it isn't necessary. Reading some of the other comments, using applesauce would work too, I think I might try it next time since it has worked well for me in the past.

This recipe was fantastic! I'm one of those annoying people who make changes...I didn't have nutmeg so I added a bit of garam masala and upped the other spices slightly. I subbed one ripe banana for the oil. I made a dozen muffins instead of bread and added walnuts to half (cook time 27 minutes). They turned out wonderfully! As everyone said, super fluffy and light. Delicious!!

Delicious! Fruit breads can be very dense (which is not necessarily a bad thing) but this was amazingly light and fluffy! I did make two modifications -- I realized after I started that instead of plain pumpkin I had pumpkin pie filling (which they specifically say not to use), so I decreased the recipe spices by about half and decreased added sugar to only 1/2 cup. Second modification was that I made 12 muffins instead of a bread. Cooked them about 22 minutes and it was perfect. Will definitely become a staple recipe for me.

This was sick. We added extra cinnamon just because you can never have too much cinnamon, and we used some brown sugar because we ran out of regular sugar and it came out amazing. We ate half the loaf in one sitting and it made the whole house smell like fall!!!
