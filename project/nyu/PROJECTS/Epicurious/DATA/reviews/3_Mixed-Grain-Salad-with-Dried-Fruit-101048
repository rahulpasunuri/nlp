I used my rice cooker for this recipe - used the brown rice setting. It came out perfect. I also increased the dried fruit and the vinegar in the dressing.

I substituted barley for the brown rice and omitted the apricots. I cooked the grains for about an hour and they were pleasantly chewy. There were no leftovoers served as a side dish for 2 adults and 2 young children. There's room for variation with the grains, fruits, vinegar, oil and seasoning. This will be a regular in our menu.

this was very bland, it was a LOT of rice per fruit even tho i halved the rice and kept the amount of fruit at the original amount.

This is my favourite salad of all time. I've made it again and again, and everyone loves it. Big change though: I use sherry instead of the vinegar - wow! huge improvement. Sometimes I vary the rice, and use red, brown and wild rice in combinations, just adjust the cooking times. And I find the wheat berries need to cook about 15 minutes longer than the other grains, so start them ahead. Just made it for a wedding buffet.

Serves 8? 8 what? 8 dozen is more like it - what alot of rice!!! It was a subtle blend of flavors but nothing really spectacular. 7 of us barely made a dent in it, so I ended up with alot of leftovers.

This was definitely a crowd pleaser, but not something I'd make just for myself. Lacked 'zip'.

I've made this several times for vegetarian friends - just use veg. stock in place of chicken stock. It makes a great main dish or side dish, and, contrary to another reviewer, I found the proportions of oil and vinegar just fine!

The oil and vinegar directions are reversed in this recipe. It should be 1/2 cup oil and 2 tablespoons vinegar.

I had to go to a health food store to find the whole wheat berries, and I hoped that they would enhance this dish. Actually, the basic recipe would have bene fine, with just the proportions of brown and wild rice increased, and the whole wheat berries left out. They added very little from a textural or taste standpoint.
