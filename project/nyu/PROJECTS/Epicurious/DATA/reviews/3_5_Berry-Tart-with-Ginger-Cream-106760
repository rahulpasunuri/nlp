This recipe is a great crowd pleaser! We really enjoyed it and what a great way to use seasonal berries. We live in Switzerland and could not find crystallized ginger - we used rehydrated dried ginger and it was a bit too ginger-y. But I am sure with the right ginger it would be great! It was so easy - I will definitely make this again!

The ginger really makes this tart. It tastes the way I always imagines fruit tarts to taste, but almost never do as the cream is so bland. I made this exactly according to the recipe once; it does make a spectacular presentation and feeds a crowd. Recently I halved the recipe and used a graham cracker crust pieshell instead of the puff pastry, which was REALLY fast, fed 6-8 generously, and was gobbled up.

If you are entertaining a crowd and want to serve a light, refreshing, impressive dessert, this is it. All of my guests loved it and were surprised that the subtle kick in the flavor was ginger. I used a 3.5 oz bag of crystallized organic baby ginger from Whole Foods Market and I reduced the amount of sugar. I think that this is a matter of taste (just like the ginger factor), but due to the sugar contained in the crystalized ginger and the red current jelly glaze, it was just sweet enough. Also, the amount of ginger cream in the recipe is enough to cover the entire pastry with a thin layer and provide a sufficient base for the fruit. I think that increasing amount of ginger cream would overpower the flavor of the fruit and result in a rich, heavy dessert. I did the advance preparation specified in the recipe and that worked out great. I recommend cleaning (drying) and measuring the fruit the day before as well. Then it's just a matter of baking the pastry and assembly the next day. I plan to make this again for a 4th of July party.

I've been making this tart since the recipe was published in 2002. It's always a big hit, and I've used it for birthdays, dinner parties, potlucks ... I love the slightly peppery and refreshing taste of crystallized ginger, but make sure you're using a good quality one, better if organic. Be creative, and play around with different kind of berries, to decorate the tart according to the occasion. And most of all, don't expect the heaviness of flavor of chocolaty, custardy fruit tarts. This is a very delicate tart, with a sophisticated kind of adult flavor.

It was OK, but nothing spectacular....my teens both left half their serving, telling me it wasn't worth it. The whole family LOVES the white chocolate mousse tart with raspberries though!!! I will stick to that recipe

Simple, light and elegant summer dessert. Great for when berries are plentiful. And it looks gorgeous! Leftovers get soggy though. I cut the recipe in half.

I was surprised how good this tart was, since it is mainly a matter of assembly. I am not so fond of the taste of store-bought puff pastry, but it makes this recipe very quick to prepare. I will not be making this tart again, because it was not very interesting or particulary exciting, but as a previous reviewer stated, it is so neutral that one would be hard-pressed not to like it. In my opinion, life is too short to eat food like that...

This was a good recipe, but somewhat boring. It seemed a lot of wasted effort to bake the phyllo in the correct shape just to top it with berries and glorified cream cheese. It was a hit at a summer party due to the design and the flavors that no one could not like.

Used half the puff pastry and all the ginger cream and used mixed fresh fruit, rasberries, peaches, kiwi...Finished with rasberry jam. Took it to a party and it was a hit...every crumb was gone...I will definitely make again, the ginger got lots of comments..oh and it looks like you spent all day and it only took less than an hour.

Lovely dessert--we did a half-sized flag was for the 4th--I was teased for being corny but it did inspire one dinner guest to sing the Star Spangled Banner all the way through. If you cut the recipe, make sure you realize what ingredients are divided use (e.g., the water). I increased the cheese by 1/2 as it was a bit gingery. Also substituted neufchatel with success. Watch that second sheet in the oven, it baked faster than the first.

I've made this tart many times and have used the filling for other tarts. It gets the highest compliments every time and even from people who didn't think they liked ginger!

I made this dessert last summer. It looked beautiful, tasted great and was loved by all the guests. It was requested again this year. As other reviewers have suggested I would increase the ginger cream to 1 1/2 or double. Also, raspberries make a great alternative to strawberries.

This was easy and beautiful. I made two quandrants and created a flag design.

This was a huge hit at last years 4th of July party and has been requested again for this years party. I halved the pastry and kept the same amount of ginger cream. People loved it and it was magnificant looking.

This is a fabulous spring/summer treat, especially for those that like non-chocolate desserts. It wasn't too hard to prepare, and it got rave reviews from everyone in our Supper Club. People said Yes-Yes to it (having two servings each!). A couple of things to keep in mind, though: -know your audience; some felt that it needed more ginger cream, and we put on more than the recipe called for. -the dessert is really only good for a day or two, so it should be made right before it is to be eaten. There is a definite 'smushyness' factor that one complained about the next day. Otherwise, a real crowd pleaser!

Great presentation and guests seemed to love it. Our second one was much better than the first, I credit this to baking the pastry on a pizza pan with perforated holes rather than a baking sheet - it made all of the difference. Also we forgot to coat the blueberries in the currant jam both times and just drizzled it on at the end, a sign that this might have a step or two too many.

I think liking this tart has to do with your preference for ginger. I made the huge size for a party, but had to double the ginger cream.

I loved the ginger, so maybe it has to do with whether you love ginger or not...I made this for my sister's shower and the guests all loved it, makes for a great presentation too!

My husband thought I was a genius! He always admires fruit tarts in pastry shop windows. This was awesome. I have to confess... I didn't have any crystallized ginger, so ours was vanilla-flavored.

This tart looked spectacular but the taste left much to be desired. I followed the recipe exactly. The ginger cream tasted horrible and I think lemon flavor the other reviewer tried must be ten times better. DO NOT USE THE GINGER! Also the storebought puff pastry wasn't great.

My brother and cousins begged me to make this dessert. I finally promised to make it when I had some free time in the restaurant and made it for him. I forgot to bring the recipe with me to the store so I bought raspberries instead of strawberries. I also made the tart half the size, put less sugar in the cream, added more ginger and some candied orange zest, and used orange marmalade as the glaze. It was a smash success. The ginger cream worked very well with the berries with the sugar reduced and not only did my brother and cousins love the way it looked and tasted, my older cousin who is always criticizing the desserts I make had to concede that this one was very good. Even the few regular customers allowed a piece of this tart loved it! There i talk about having it on the menu as a regular thing! its great!

The Party at our dock loved this tart! I did modify it by leaving out the ginger and adding Lemon curd instead. Made for a very refreshing taste.

This is a great recipe, I used 1 sheet of pastry and cut it to fit a 11x7 tart form, it worked out very well, 6 nice servings. Used fresh picked blueberries, three rows and used strawberrie to make an attractive design in the center. I can't wait to try it again.

The hit of the party. Everyone enjoyed the favor and wow about how it was presented.

My fmily loved this tart. We did alter the recipe a bit, however. We made it half the suggested size (easily done), we didn't use the ginger or the currant jelly, and we used low fat cream cheese. The berries this time of year (July) are sweet enough to carry the dessert. We will definitely make it again, perhaps with different types of fruit. Thanks for a fabulous easy one!

I modified for simplicity's sake; so technically I'm rating 2/3 of the recipe... I omitted the puff pastry altogether. I used sugar cookie dough bought at the grocery store and made a big thin cookie crust, with the edges squished in once out of oven to create a crust. I halved the ingredients for the cream, berries, and glaze. It turned out very well, though next time I'll cut down the sugar in the ginger cream.

This is a great hot weather dessert. I used 3 packages of cream cheese and added extra ginger to the ginger cream. The recipe calls for two packages but it seemed too thin a layer. The tart was reduced to a few crumbs of puff pastry in a flash by my very enthusiastic guests.
