This dish was very good! I ran out of space on the stove, so i just broiled the oysters on high until the shells turned a greenish color. Then i cracked them open and put the apple mixture on top. SO GOOD!

A great start to my dinner party - guests really loved the unconventional apple mignonnette. I'm already thinking of what a perfect recipe this will be to kick off an autumn menu.
