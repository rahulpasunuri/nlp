This was delicious and we will definitely make this again. My boyfriend, who does not like fish all that much, loved it. A bit time consuming since I cooked all four cakes separtely in the frying pan--I was afraid they'd fall apart--but was able to keep them warm in the oven.

Having lived in Boston for years, I am accustomed to Legal's cod cakes, which use freshly mashed potatoes. I have never seen a "New England" style fish cake that doesn't have mashed potato. I don't even think I will try this one.

I love this recipe, as do my boyfriend, friends, and parents. I used tilapia once and Basa once, both turned out great.

My husband took one bite and gave me the rest. I found it mediocre. Not worth a repeat for us.

I had been looking forward to making these for some time, but when I finally got around to them--well, what a disappointment. Tasteless, bland, in a word--insipid. I followed the recipe to a tee. Thank God for the tartar sauce; these would have been nearly inedible, in my opinion, without it!

I thought these were mediocre but my husband - who eats just about anything and hates "wasting" food - really disliked them. I made as directed but added some Old Bay seasoning. I wished I had simply grilled the fish.

Wary of other's comments, I tasted my half talipia, half tuna mix before I fried it - kinda bland. So I spiced it up a bunch with a tiny bit of cayenne pepper, Montreal Steak Seasoning, and some garlic salt. They came out great! Yeah, the original recipie lacks a little kick, but it is very easily remedied with your favorite spices! I will be making this again.

What a tasty and hearty meal! My boyfriend loved the herbed tartar sauce.

Yummy!! The ingredients list is different from what the directions say - the thyme really gives the fish cakes the flavor - I used dry thyme. I used Whiting for the white fish, and used whole wheat bread instead of white. I also skipped the capers becuase I didn't have any and just mixed in some thyme into premade tartar sauce. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe.

I was really looking forward to trying this, especially since it evoked long-ago childhood memories. However, following the recipe exactly, I found it quite bland and tasteless, as did my husband. Also, making the bread crumbs as describ-ed yields much more than 1 1/2 cups, so I didn't use them all. These will benefit from chopped jalapenos, Old Bay, or the like.

This recipe was awesome. I used Pacific Seabass and it was great. I used sweet onions rather that the green onions in the fish cake, and had only dried thyme on hand. It still was great. My daughter loved it. We will definitely experiment more with this.

Time consuming. Mild flavor will appeal to people who won't eat fish. Makes 6 large fish cakes.

I was disappointed in the flavor of these cakes.

These were just superb. The best fish cakes I have ever made or eaten. I made the recipe (with fresh cod) exactly as published with two exceptions. I molded them into golf ball sized clumps and flattened them and dipped them into panko bread crumbs. I was a little skeptical about using the food processor for the celery and the fish but these were light and moist and very crispy thanks to the extra breadcrumbs. PS I think the 1 1/2 cups refers to the amount of cut up bread before processing. I think that much of dry store bought crumbs will be way too much and too dry. Personally, I would buy the bread and just chop it finely by hand. The fresh bread adds to the moistness of the cakes.

Great stuff! Easy to prepare and the suggested accompaniments are perfect. An idea for the cook who wanted help with making bread crumbs without a food processor: I freeze leftover chunks of bread then hand grate them on the large holed side of a grater. The results work well. I prefer using French bread for this (or almost any other) recipe calling for bread crumbs.

I used catfish filets, which made the cakes hold together very nicely. Delicious and easy.

Excellent and easy. I used tilapia b/c I had it on hand in the freezer, and it worked very well. Definitely a good weekday meal.
