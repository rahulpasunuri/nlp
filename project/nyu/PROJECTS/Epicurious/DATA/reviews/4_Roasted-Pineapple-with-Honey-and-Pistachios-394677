Easy, easy and a perfect ending to a spring meal. It's a keeper.

A keeper, big-time! We didn't have mint, so I used just the pistachios and then a spring of rosemary for garnish. Fabulous.

Loved this recipe, and extremely easy. Subbed pecans for pistachios because it was what I had on hand; toasted them first, definitely recommend toasting. Very healthy, but it SMELLS like caramel while its cooking. Topped with greek yogurt.

Very nice recipe. Followed the recipe this time, but next time I will add some spices like cinnamon and ginger. I did not have creme fraiche but I did have a nice Greek yogurt that was lovely with the sweetness of the dish.

haven't made this recipe but i did make grilled pineapple a few days ago only to say this, pineapple is naturally sweet! why go to all the trouble of marinating in 3 more types of sugar when the oven will caramelize the fruit and give you a wonderful natural flavor. also, is that much sugar (in marinade) not going to burn in a 450 degree oven for 30 min? anyways, the combination of the other ingredients sounds wonderful!

I loved this recipe! It was a perfect compliment to my Tandori style dinner; a great balance between sweet and tart and had a nice healthy feel to it.

This recipe was amazing, won high praise and I would definitely make this again. A very refreshing dessert. I used Greek yogurt (not the nonfat or lowfat variety).
