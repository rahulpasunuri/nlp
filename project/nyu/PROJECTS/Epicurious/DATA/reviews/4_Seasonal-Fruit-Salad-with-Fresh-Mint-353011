Good color and presentation, plus it tastes much more complicated than it is.(For reference: 1 pineapple = 3 cups cubed.) I will substitute blueberries for blackberries and peaches for strawberries if they are more accessible. We found the overall texture balance to be perfect.

So great & easy. Used canned pineapple & added just a touch of honey. Delicious.

We had this for he 4th of July. It was a big hit. Very easy to make. We use a whole pinneapple which came out as the recipe X 5 and resulted in leftovers which I wouldn't recommend. The salad was still good but became purple from the berries. Great for the summertime when mint is plentiful.

Easy and delicious. The mint gives a great twist and the fruit combo is great. Never would've thought of it on my own

Almost left out the apples in this salad b/c it sounded weird, but they add a nice crunch. Also threw in a capful of Cointreau. So simple but so good. Can't wait to make it again.

It was a hit with my family on top of pound cake with whipped cream. yet i didn't know that the blackberries had seeds so that didn't go over too well but over all loved it and will be making this again!

So easy yet so unforgettable. I had planned to make it for one meal at Christmas but my husband asked me to make it for all four of our holiday dinners.

might increase the strawberries, but still really delicious. where could you find a better way to use fresh mint?

So simple, yet so amazing! It is incredible how just mint totally changes the fruit.
