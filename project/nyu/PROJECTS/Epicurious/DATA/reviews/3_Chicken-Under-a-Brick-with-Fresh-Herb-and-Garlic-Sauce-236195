this is really garicky, but tasty and easy

It was ok, but not worth the effort.

I'm going to try this again, because it just didn't 'do it' for me in the way I'd hoped. I only marinated the chicken for about 2 hours (next time will do much longer and perhaps put a few slashes in the chicken to absorb more of the sauce, and I had skinless fillets. My husband said he enjoyed it - and so did I - but not at the level anticipated.

Oh, wow, this was just wonderful. We barbecued it on the Weber using mesquite charcoal, and it was so juicy and flavorful. Used the leftovers the next night in a Cobb salad...YUM. This is a real keeper, you won't be disappointed. I'm going to try it with fish and also pork tenderloin.

Perhaps it stated this in the magazine article, but this is basically a Georgian (Georgia as in formerly part of USSR, not the US state) recipe known as Chicken Tabaka. Geogian food is garlicky and wonderful, but not too well known in the US. You can find other versions on the Internet, sometimes under Russian recipe sections.

see the part where you take a 1/2 cup of the sauce to marinate the chicken? you spoon the REMAINING sauce (minus the aforementioned 1/2 cup and the raw chicken juice) at service.

to gourmandise2 from rochester... you only marinate the chicken in 1/2 c. of the sauce mixture. the remaining is what you pour over the chicken.

This recepe sounds good, although I have not tried it yet.My comment is that I would hesitate to pour this sauce uncooked that has marinated raw chicken,better look into this.

The bricks came out WAY too dry. I would serve them with more sauce or something, or marinate them longer.

This is great. The sauce is similar to a pesto and it's a great fresh dish for a new twist on chicken.
