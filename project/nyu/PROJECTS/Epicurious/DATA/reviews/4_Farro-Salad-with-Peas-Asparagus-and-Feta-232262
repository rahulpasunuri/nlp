This recipe was incredibly healthy and delicious. I used green onions instead of red, added a can of butter beans and some salt and pepper. I will definitely make it again.

This salad is always a winner! I made it with gluten free red Quinoa instead of the Farro. It was delicious and gluten free!

This was delicious and easy to make. The farro adds earthy depth to the bright, crisp summer veggies. I didn't have sherry wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and it was still great.

Made this for Easter potluck. Added fava beans from my garden and kept veggies nice and crisp. Chopped sugar snap peas in half. Flavors were great, enjoyed by all. I had to cook my farro for almost 2 hours...I purchased whole wheat berries, which may have been why. Even better the next day.

It had been 3 years since I last made this salad and I forgot just how DELICIOUS it is! I definitely won't wait so long to make it again. It took a visit to a few stores to find the farro but it was well worth the hunt.

Salad was nice for a light ladies dinner. Prepped tomatoes, onion & dill mixture night before (added a few TBSP of dressing to it so it would be well flavored). You could definitely make this entire salad day ahead - it kept well and tasted great next day. If you cannot find farro at your market, barley would be a close substitute.

This has been a huge hit every time I have made it. I have also made it with a brown/wild rice blend, and that is good, but I prefer it with farro. You can make this ahead, because it is even better the second day.

We loved this, tho is there quick & long-cooking farro? My pkg said to cook for an hour! I did 15 minutes in my pressure cooker & it was great. I only used about 1/2 the dressing, but otherwise, made as written - very tasty!

This salad is delicious (and healthy, too.) I made it exactly as written. But I think you could cut the amount of cheese in half and use about 1/4 less dressing and it would still be yummy. I've never had farro before, but was curious: it is nutty- tasting, cooks quickly -- worth seeking out.

I also have made this several times....for those of you who can't find Farro, most health food stores carry Whole Wheat Berries (same thing).

I made this salad as directed except that I couldn't find farro, so I substituted pearl barley, cooked as per package directions. The salad was ok, though it seemed a bit hodge-podge. The sherry vinegar and feta flavors were good, but the dill was overpowered by them. The veggies, each great on their own, seemed a bit arbitrarily chosen.

This is one of the few four-fork ratings I've given. Couldn't find farro so I used barley cooked with a tablespoon of chicken-flavored Better than Bouillon base added to the water, and dill wasn't available so I used fresh tarragon. I also tossed in some pine nuts for extra crunch and a minced serrano chile for a little kick. Excellent dish that will go in the "sure bet" recipe file.

This was wonderful. I couldn't find farro, so I made it with pearled barley. Really wonderful - even my picky, meat-eating husband liked it.

I have made this for many people and all love it. I use bulgar instead of farro, it gives it a bit more of a nutty flavor. I of course always add more the vegetables than the recipe asks for. Delicious!

This is a fabulous recipe which I have made for several large gatherings, to rave reviews. I couldn't find farro at my Italian markets, so I have been using the Israeli couscous instead, basically following the same directions. I also reduced the amaount of dressing, adding and tasting until it had enough - about half to two thirds of the recipe. I've also substituted other green veggies and it works great!

My whole family LOVED this recipe! I found the Farro in Food Source. I used Champagne vinegar instead of the Sherry wine vinegar. We all thought that this recipe was really pretty to look at and tasted even better! Thanks!

Delicious (and expensive). I added some port wine vinegar as I didn't have enough of the sherry.

I have made this several times now and it is also delicious with Israeli Couscous instead of farro.

I personally love anything with farro- that chewyness is addictive. This salad is lovely and was a huge hit at a picnic. Peeling the fava beans was the only real work. All else was a breeze!

Awesome recipe - wonderful flavors and the Sherry vinegar makes it. Farro is readily available at Italian markets. I made this for a first/salad course for a gourmet group and everyone LOVED it! Don't change anything.

The ingredient I couldn't find was sherry wine vinegar, so I went with basalmic. I also used fresh basil instead of dill. I'd try brown rice next time instead of the farro/spelt, just as an experiment. I'll eat just about anything with feta cheese anyway!

This recipe is grrrreat. I will definately make it again. Kitchelle, check out www.farro.com Tells ya all about it. Look for Spelt in the grocery stores. Also, I find it real hard to believe that either Spelt or Farro is not available in Jersey... Have fun..

Sounds delicious, but since please list substitutions for farro, as it doesn't sound readily available.

Kitchenella- Faro is defined in the lower section of the recipe.

There is a definition of farro at the end of the recipe: "Market tip: Farro is an ancient Tuscan grain with a mellow, nutty flavor. You'll find it in some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Italian markets." If there's a Whole Foods in your area I'd check there
