Have made this several times with kohlrabi that comes in our CSA. Easy, keeps well and tastes delicious. I sometimes use mayo instead of cream.

This was very tasty. Made it with mayonaise and crystalized lemons instead. Added shredded carrots. I doubled the recipe for the fruit and veg and used the same amount of dressing as recipe called. It was quite good and will make again for sure.

Read this. Made this. Loved this. One grated kohlrabi, one grated apple, and a handful of sweet turnips I had already grated. Free-handed the dressing, omitted the parsley and the sugar. Absolutely delicious. Try this!

I tasted my CSA kohlrabi and hated it. Tried this recipe with canned coconut milk and dried parsley leaves. Great, tangy sauce. Started by picking out the apples, but in a few minutes was even enamored with the kohlrabi.

Good salad. Something different and dressing was tangy. I used lowfat buttermilk instead of cream and a little extra mustard. It was a lot of prep because the kohlrabis need to be peeled, but I would make it again.

Received kohlrabi in our CSA box this week - this was the perfect use! I did use about 1/4 cup Greek-style plain yogurt in place of the heavy cream, and a honeycrisp apple, but we thought this was wonderful.

My boyfriend made this tonight, we followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. We also finally learned to use the julienne function on our food processor. Seriously, how have we not been using this until now? If you want to make it a little healthier, you can cut the cream to 1/4 c instead of 1/2 and it will work just fine. Seriously, it's so good!

I followed the recipe but added some radishes. We liked it and I will make it again.

A little bland for my taste, but then I didn't have granny smith apple so used a red one.

I made this using just what I had in my kitchen, which meant fresh lemon, creme fraiche in place of heavy cream, and no parsley. I also shredded both the kohlrabi and apple in a food processor, making it really juicy, like a coleslaw but lighter. The creme fraiche dressing was fantastic and the kohlrabi/apple combination worked so well. I can't get over how easy and cheap a side dish is and I imagine it would work well with a number of variations.

This salad came out delicious! I didn't make any changes to it and it was easy and refreshing. Served it with a grilled pork tenderloin and couscous and it was the perfect compliment to the meal. I would definitely make it again.

Again made with yogurt, honey mustard, no parsley. Great!

Also, a kohlrabi virgin but I thought it was great. I used yogurt rather than cream because I didn't have any. Died parsley and made for one. So great. I think the combo of mustard and kohlrabi gave it a wasabi bite, which opened my sinuses! Try it if you like fresh, clean-tasting, juicy salads. Oh, I also squeezed out a considerable amount of water from the grated stuff. Yes, I grated, too. No time for chopping in julienne strips and don't have any equipment for it.

Made this dish as aprt of a 7 course meal for 8 guests. It was one of the stars. I did increase the apple ratio and was glad I did, as the bites without apple chunks were not nearly as exciting as those with. Very light, yet beautiful and sophisticated. Make sure you use good mustard.

Very good using the recommended substitutions of 1 tbsp sour cream for heavy cream, 1 bulb of kohlrabi and 1 apple. I also used creole mustard. Instead of parsley I used a sprinkle of herbes de provence. Perfect summer salad.

The more apple vs kohlrabi the better this would be. Kohlrabi's appeal is in its crispness, like jicama, since it is virtually tasteless.

This recipe is great as written. There are no substitues needed, though I would agree that the kohlrabi to apple ratio be more equal. Definitely use cream!! It's good for you and delicious. Don't make any other alterations. It's like a really good cole slaw with a twist.

I tried this recipe last night and it was fantastic. Having never used (or eaten) kohlrabi, I can't really compare it to any other recipes. I grated both the kohlrabi and the apple on a box grater--much easier than slicing and dicing--and squeezed out the liquid (there was quite a bit of it) with a few paper towels. Grating it produces more of a coleslaw than a "salad". The dressing is orgasmic. Yeah, it's heavy cream. Yeah, it probably counteracts the healthiness of the fresh veggies. Whatever. It's delicious. I never realized you could make a dressing from cream and lemon, but it makes sense. A friend who raved about the dish said it was a Scandanavian vinaigrette. TRY IT!

I made this salad with the very first kohlrabi I've ever bought, and I really like it. (For those of you like me who are new to kohlrabi, its like a cross between raw cauliflower and a really really mild radish. Kinda like jicama only crunchier.) I used olive oil in place of the whipped cream and added a bit more mustard than the recipe calls for. I also had some fig jam laying around so I used a dollop of that instead of the sugar. It turned out great!

The combination of kohlrabi and apple was wonderful. I made the recipe as directed, but next time I will try sour cream, mayo or a combination of the two instead of heavy cream.

I gave this 3 forks based on my subsitutions. I used one large bulb kohlrabi and one granny smith apple and it was the perfect ratio. I substituted a tablespoon sour cream for the heavy cream. Instead of parsley I used a scattering of tarragon and I used Creole mustard. It scored big with everyone at the table.

I found it to be too much kohlrabi compared to apple. Next time I will have 1-1½ lbs kohlrabi and 2 apples. Suggest that the recipe wording be changed to: "julienne strips as thin as match sticks". Mine were not thin enough. Overall a good and somewhat unique salad.
