This is amazing bread; even my Wonder-Bread-loving-boyfriend liked it. I took the suggestions of other bakers and incorporated various seeds into the bread during the final kneading, and made it into two loaves. I'm currently in the middle of my second attempt, and I was wondering if anyone else had these issues: 1. the dough seems SO sticky, should it be more elastic? I've added the correct amount of flour, but it still sticks like crazy. 2. When slicing it, the middle fell out of the slices. Is this because I needed to let it rest longer before slicing, or does this have to do with my sticky dough problem. Regardless, at least for now, this is my go-to bread, because it's quick and delicious, and lasted about five days outside the refrigerator.

Easily my new go-to bread! Substituted 1 c. bread flour with freshly milled wheat flour. Incorporated seeds into dough with the addition of sunflower and caraway. Wonderful, hearty, healthy, but not overly dense. Makes awesome toast as well.

This is a simple tasty bread! I shape it into two loaves however. Friends can't believe I've turned into a bread maker at 65. I even used regular flour rather than the bread flour, omitted the expensive poppy seeds. . . . .and it still turned out great.

The recipe was wonderful, I made it exactly what is written above, and it didnt disappoint me. The dish was delightful that my friends loved! Here are some sites that have unique recipes www.gourmandia.net and www.everythingbread.com . Highly recommended for someone who wants to try new recipes and improve their cooking skills.

Wow! Easy and great exactly as written. Lovely toasted the next day with gobs of butter. Might be tempted to work some seeds into the loaf as they fall off after baking. N Healthful, nutritious and delicious.

I made this one Sunday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised at how simple it was. I used a pizza stone to bake it on and the crust came out very well, crunchy and flavorful. I recommend it.

Wow! This is an awesome recipe! Crunchy outside tender inside-best bread I've ever made. Two recipes yielded 18 rolls and two large loaves. Like other reviewers I mixed the seeds into the dough and did the egg wash on top with extra flax seeds and chopped walnuts, salt and pepper on top. Perfect!

If you put your yeast in @ the temp suggested for your "cooled cereal", it could die. Cool to 90F or slightly less.

This bread turned out so beautifully that I almost can't believe I made it, plus it is absolutely delicious. I made it just as instructed except for substituting about a cup of whole wheat flour. I'll bet it would be even better with all bread flour as the recipe indicated. I can't stop eating it! And I never have such good luck with yeast breads! I'll make this one again and again.

This was my first bread! I found all the ingredients at Whole Foods including the cereal. They have a section where you can buy baking produce by the pound. Since this is the first time I baked bread I cannot compare it to anything, but it was delicious. My only wonder is if it is supposed to be very dense.. The bread rose and doubled it's size but the end result was a very dense loaf. Is it supposed to be this way? I used 2.5 cups all purpose and 1.5 whole wheat and the rest of the 1/3 all purpose I used for the kneading as someone suggested.

This bread is wonderful; I usually use part whole wheat and a little rye flour instead of all bread flour. The recipe makes 2 largish loaves. To the reviewer wondering about the cereal, I use Bob's 5-Grain Rolled Whole Grain Hot Cereal (plus flaxseed). It comes in a 1 lb. plastic bag and is in the cereal or baking aisle.

I really want to make this bread but have no idea where I can get an unsweetened multi-grain cereal... Does anyone have a brand name or a store I can find it?

I have always wondered how to get the crust so crusty. The only problem with this was that it went stale very quickly and very noticeably because of the crust.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! I make it every week. I've played with it too, and the greatest is 1-1/2 c. whole wheat, 2-1/2 c. bread flour. The 1/3 is reserved for kneading. I put the seeds in the bread as well and it is so tasty. After trying a 9x13 and an 8x8 pan, then a shaped round loaf, I've settled on a 9x5 loaf pan. That gets the best rise. If you don't have one, get an oven thermometer for the right amount of crustiness.

This is a GREAT recipe!! Followed the reviewers' advice and did half/half ww/white flour. It turned out delicioius. I also added the flax seeds to the dough along with finely chopped walnuts, since I didn't have the other seeds. It was great!!! Will definitely make it again. Next time I'll try to make two loaves in loaf pans since my bread was HUGE, but more wide than tall. Wondering if anyone else's bread turned out that way as well.

This is a phenomenal recipe. I've made it using all whole wheat flour, all white flour, and 3/4 whole wheat and 1/4 white (my favorite). The first time I made it, I shaped it into one big loaf, per the instructions, but I have since been making it in rolls instead. With rolls, you have to reduce the cooking time somewhat, but they come out beautifully. And they freeze perfectly!

This is very good. I am up to half whole wheat flour. Will try 3/4 next. I also mixed in the seeds and just put sesame seeds on top. I am eliminating the boiling water as the bottom of the bread did not brown either time.

Unbelievably great! Soft, tasty crumb and an excellent, crunchy crust. I made one loaf in a loaf pan and one hand shaped loaf and both were perfect (although the loaf pan took a little longer to bake). Very popular in my house!

This recipe would get 5 stars out of four! I will make this again and again. I discovered that I purchased Kashi 7 whole grain PILAF instead of cereal. So I made the following alterations: 1) boiled the pilaf for 2 minutes, covered, turned off heat & let the pilaf sit for 25 minutes and it reaceed 110 degrees. 2)I also used 3 cups of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat. 3)also added pumpkin seeds to the seed topping. The bread turned out hearty, moist and delicious! Lots of texture!!

I somehow messed up this recipe as badly as it could be (added too little flour and had to dump in a LOT more during the kneading process -- don't ask), and it still was fabulous. As others suggested, I added seeds to the dough -- including sunflower and caraway -- and brushed the tops with egg wash before sprinkling the rest on, with sea salt. Two small loaves took 25 minutes to cook, and I tented with foil the last 5 minutes or so. It smelled so delicious baking that I had to have a slice right out of the oven, with butter, mmm.

One reviewer said she used 1 cup cereal and 3 cups water, and that's what I did. Came out PERFECT. Made a HUGE loaf and 8 small rolls - next time I will make 2 loaves. I used eggwhite wash on the outside to stick the seeds on. This bread was absolutely lovely - chewy, crusty, moist, toothsome - just delicious.

Extremely good. And just 'cus I was confused - multi-grain ceral just means oatmeal!! I used a variety of oatmeal types and it worked great.

This is only the 2nd loaf of bread i have ever made, but love to bake. Recipe is pretty easy to follow. this loaf turned out amazing! Firs of all: it's huge. i could definitely see making 2 smaller loaves out of it. Not a big deal in my house b/c we eat it pretty fast. I almost always use coconut oil when baking and it's perfect in this loaf, i don't taste coconut, but some may. My "cereal" was an oat base that i added buckwheat, millet and quinoa to. i added way more seeds than called for and made more of mix (like 5 kinds). I agree at least some of these should be added to the dough. I use about 3/4 flax meal in place of part of the flour (and next time will use part whole wheat as well) I salted the seeds as suggested AND added a few drops of agave nectar... fabulous! Bread was done in about 30 min, could have cooked 35 but crust was browning a bit too much, so i cut it in half (eat a couple pieces) let the loaf and oven cool a bit then leave the rest of the bred on the rack in the oven while it's finishing cooling, this seems to finish it nicely. Also noticed my rise time was only about 40 min rather than an hour. Would like to use agave nectar instead of sugar, but wondering if it throws off dry/wet ratios. This will probably be my base recipe for most breads.

Once you make your own bread, there' no going back to the $7 store-bought loaves. Reading other reviews, I used a 50/50 mix of whole wheat and bread flour, and also incorporated almost all the seeds into the bread - I love a seedy bread. Added sunflower seeds to the mix, and would have added caraway if I had them... next time. Used my KA mixer to do all the kneading and shaped into a loaf shape midway between loaf and boul (large oval). Baked on convect for 25 minutes. Bread heaven. Highly recommended, even for beginners.

Easy to make, I used 50/50 whole white with bread flour. It cooked in 30 minutes. The mixture on top didn't stick as well as I thought it would.

This is a great recipe for a hearty bread. I read the other reviews and decided to follow suit by using a 50/50 mixture of bread flour and whole wheat flour. I also added oat bran and flax seeds to the flour mixture for added nutrition. To the seed mixture I added caraway seeds and sea salt. The salt was definitely key in the crust. Overall, a great recipe and one I will definitely make again.

This is delicious and it comes out perfectly! Like bakery bread. Mine was fully done after 23 min...not sure if anyone else had that experience. I would recommend checking well before 35 min just in case!

I've been making bread by hand for 35 years, and this has become our everyday bread. I use 1 cup of 10-grain cereal, so 3 cups of water. I use at least one cup of whole wheat flour. Delicious!

Ths is probably the best bread I've ever had! I added 1t coarse sea salt to the seed mixture and served it with honey butter. Everybody loved it!

I used quick rise yeast which means you add it to the dries, let the hot cereal temp only decrease to 130F then throw it together. I have a mixer which did the kneading. Then the dough goes right into the large loaf pan. No punching down or second rise. Just let it rise once & bake. Works for me! I didn't bother with the seeds on the outside. I added ground flax seeds and wheat germ to the dough. I also used 100% ww flour and it turned out great. Needs a titch more salt for me. Next time I might throw in some more nuts or seeds in the dough for a change. Try the quick rise yeast. It saves alot of time :)

This is great bread. This is the first time I've made bread; it was easy and it looks like it was baked by a pro. I will be using this recipe many more times. But don't make the same stupid mistake I made....when it says to add water to the baking pan that has been in the oven at 425, use a metal pan. I wasn't thinking, and used a pyrex baking pan. Of course it shattered in a million pieces when the water hit it....what a mess!

This is the second time I've made this, and it didn't turn out so good this time. Perhaps because I let the dough sit overnight. It's edible, but very dense. I also used a mixture of rye and whole wheat flour.

I tried this recipe last week and it came out very nicely. I took the advice to brush with egg white and the seeds stayed on fine. I also used half whole wheat flour. I found a ceral that had flax seed in it (Hodgeson Mill Multi-grain) and that worked very nicely.

Wonderful and easy bread. I have been making bread at home 1-2 times a week for a year now mostly following Peter Reinhart's recipes (They are great!) This bread tastes great without having to rest it over night. I followed some of the tips and added 1/2 of the seed mixture into the dough and used egg white to brush. My husband ate almost half of it. I guess I have to make another loaf tomorrow.

Rating: 4
Excellent bread. I ground up about 1/4cup of flax seeds and added that with the flour. I also knead ed about 2/3 of the seeds directly into the dough. Nice nutty flavor, soft texture with crunchy crust. If you are into bread making I highly suggest looking into the Hearthkit. Got mine on Amazon and it makes breads and doughs as good as a bakery oven.

Awesome bread !!! Wanting a whole-grain homemade bread for sandwiches, I double this recipe and split it into two 9x12 loaf pans and bake longer (45 min.or so), tenting the bread during the last 15 min.or so with aluminum foil to prevent over-browning. However, use either lard or Crisco for greasing the pan !!!, as olive oil caused the bread to stick all over the sides. The 50/50 ratio unbleached flour and whole wheat flour works! I also take the loaves to a local grocer who slices them marvelously on their bread slicer, allowing me to freeze the entire loaf and remove slices as needed. A definite keeper!

This was my first attempt at bread in years. I couldn't be more pleased by how easy it is and how tasty. I've been using soy milk as the wash instead of water or egg whites. The seeds do stay on quite well, but this is definitely not a no-mess item in the kitchen once it's baked.

Couldn't stop eating this one. I made the mistake of covering it with a towel after it came out of the over so crust was softer that it should of been. Will be making this one again very soon.

Wonderful, hearty bread. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular flour with no problems. I kneaded a handful of sunflower seeds into the dough and used a mixture of sunflower, flax and sesame seeds plus some pepitas and coarse salt crystals on the outside. Brushing with egg is a must to keep the seeds stuck. Excellent!

Very good bread and nice straight forward recipe. The seeds really make the crust (I did brush with egg whites and they stayed on great). At the last minute I realized that the recipe was referring to hot cereal (which I got in bulk at the coop) and not the multigrain cold cereal (I just couldn't imagine soaking it in boiling water)

Been using my bread machine about 4 years. Adapted this dough to mix in the machine and cook in the oven. Unsolicited testimonial: the best bread I had ever made! The nuttiness from the crust is key (and the appearance!). In the last batch I added 1/3 c walnut to the dough which changes the texture/flavour of occasional bites. Good! Made two smaller loaves. Froze just fine. Been slowly replacing white wheat with whole without detriment yet at 50/50.

This is one of my favorite bread recipes! The combination of all of the seeds give it a nutty flavor. The loaf looks "professionally made" and is sure to impress both in looks and taste!

yes, brushing the loaf with egg white or whole egg works well to make the seeds stick. Also, coarse salt is another great topping.

My first attempt at bread and it was WONDERFUL!!!! I could have eaten the whole loaf when it came out of the oven. I used molasses as one reader suggested. I've always known the benefits of flax and I'm just incorporating it into my diet now. It's rich is Omega 3 fatty acids which is great for skin and connective tissue. I found a lot of the seeds fell off, too. Would brushing the loaf with egg whites help? It made one huge loaf so next time I might shape it into two loaves. Also, I used whole wheat flour, not bread flour. It's definitely worth the time it takes to prepare and bake.

I'VE GOTTEN INTO THE BREAD THING THIS LAST MONTH SO THIS RECIPE CAUGHT MY EYE. I HAD ALL THE INGREDIENTS(MY FRIENDS TEASE ME ABOUT THAT) HANDY, I GOT RIGHT TO WORK. OF COURSE I DID CHEAT, I DIDN'T KNEAD IT, I JUST STIRRED IN THE FLOUR AND LEFT IT IN THE SAME BOWL TO RISE. DUMPED IT OUT ON A FLOURED SURFACE, SHAPED THE LOAF AND BAKED IT ON A FLOURED PAN. EVERY ONE WHO MANAGED TO GET ANY LOVED IT.

Really liked this bread, though it took awhile to make. When they said 20 minutes for the multigrain cereal to cool down it was more than twice that time. Also, the seeds fall off the loaf every time I slice it. (Any suggestions?) But other than that I really liked the taste and texture of this bread. Will definitely make it again.

This bread is a staple in our kitchen.It is great for sandwiches,with cheese or toasted for breakfast.I sometime use molasse instead of brown sugar and it is also very nice.To get the full health benefit of the flax seeds,I run them VERY BRIEFLY in the blender,just to break some seeds.Anyone who enjoy breadmaking should try this recipe!

Oh boy, is this bread WONDERFUL!!! I had a hard time finding flax seeds and ended up finding them at General Nutrition. This is my favorite bread now. Great fresh out of the oven, for sandwiches, toasted, even as French toast! If you only bake one loaf of bread a year, this is the one you MUST try! It's totally delicious.

I did not try this yet but I will. The Flax seed has Omega 3 oils which are the very best for your body. Finely chopped walnuts are also rich in Omega 3 oil. Use them generously where ever you can. Bless you.
