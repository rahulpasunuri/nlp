Great recipe! Very adaptable to your taste. I did 1.5 the recipe for more chicken (skinless legs and thighs). Marinade in frig for 4 hours. drain. baked on a rack (must)for 35-40 mins (ovens differ). My guys loved it! Hubby wants to grill this soon! Thanks!

Really easy and quite delicious! Lemon juice works just as well as lime juice if you have that on hand. I used regular chili powder and it wasn't too spicy, just perfectly flavorful. Skinless chicken thighs were also as good as the legs. Served with Fusilli pasta, homemade tomato sauce, and sauteed green beans.

This made for a spicy, and tasty dinner. Used staple items, it was quick and yummy. What more can you ask for? Will do this again, for sure!!

I made this for the 3rd time after quite a spell and I love the ease, quickness and adaptability of this week nite dish. I'm a spice nut so I kick it up with chili powder and smoked hot paprika and a little lime juice but soooo great with a side of couscous.

My boyfriend and I thought this was great! Even though he sometimes doesn't like strong flavors, he liked this. It was truly quick and easy. The small amount of glaze did actually cover all the chicken. I'll try leaving it on as a marinade next time.

This is a tasty & adaptable recipe! I made this with a few changes (trying to use up old produce by using orange juice instead of lime juice & adding crushed red pepper flakes to counter the extra sweetness) & turned it into an overnight marinade. Next time I will use seasoned salt instead of plain salt. The flavor is close to adobo sauce! I bet it would be good on thin cuts of pork as well.

I loved this recipe. After reading everyone's review I decided to marinade the chick for over 8 hours. The flavor was all the way through and wonderful, both my husband and I loved it.

Rating: 2
I found the chicken to be far too spicy - all I could taste is the chili powder. I'll make this again, but I'll decrease the amount of chili powder and increase the amount of lime. I think this recipe has potential, it's just not to my taste as it's written.

Rating: 3
Ingredients and proportions are easily modifiable for this recipe (i.e. add more spices or use different sweetener or acid) -- worked well with skinless legs/thighs, too.

Rating: 3
This is a good, quick weeknight dinner that is reasonably healthy. I use a dash of chipotle chile powder to the chili powder. I think most of the lime flavor gets lost in the cooking, but the acid does help the other flavors penetrate the meat, so I squeeze more lime juice over at the end, after baking. I think adding some zest would also help, but I'm just too lazy!

Rating: 4
Very good but I added more lime juice, less chili powder, and more honey and a bit of canola oil to make a glaze. I used the glaze to brush on chicken legs and thighs with no skin on the grill. Brushed on at the end of cooking.

Rating: 3
The sweet honey and spicy chili combination is amazing. When I smelled this cooking it reminded me of chicken mole. I prefer things on the spicy side, however, so I added a dash of crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper (plus a little extra honey to balance it out). I also added about half a tablespoon of ginger to give a bit more complexity to the sauce. I was very happy with the result. I am giving the recipe 3/4 stars because it is a bit simple for my taste, but overall a good base recipe.

Rating: 3
Quick and easy is right! Often I come across recipes that quote prep and cook times turning out to take MUCH longer than expected. This was easy and done on time! I used chicken breasts instead of legs, because that's what I had on hand. Turned out great :)

What is "mild" honey? I have not found that at the grocery.

Unfortunately, my husband and I found this recipe to be very bland. We disliked it so much that we didn't finish our first piece of chicken and threw away the rest.

Rating: 4
This is definitely a keeper. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about how great it was. Since he likes things sweet, I doubled the honey. My favorite part was the hint of lime - might add more lime juice next time. At 35 minutes, the chicken was way underdone, so I did have to add about 10 minutes to the cook time.

Made as directed, tripled the recipe using drumsticks for a party. They were a big hit! A previous reviewer said to be sure to follow the instructions for putting them in the upper third of the oven, which I agree with -- nice and crispy that way.

Rating: 3
Great recipe. I was making this for a big group. I used 3.5 pound of chicken drumsticks and doubled the marinade recipe. I used orange juice in the marinade to begin with because I ran out of limes. I marinated the legs for about six hours, added some fresh lime juice, and then grilled exactly as directed. The legs came out just as pictured and smelled great. For the party, I transferred the legs to a slowcooker set on 'low' and added about 1/2 inch of orange juice to the bottom of the cooker to keep it from scorching or sticking. The legs held up well even after staying on the 'keep warm' setting for several hours.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I used boneless, skinless thighs. My husband was impressed with how the flavor penetrated throughout the chicken thigh. Wouldn't change a thing.

Rating: 4
This is a great, easy recipe. I have made it many times. One suggestion is to remove the skin from chicken, as the marinade penetrates better. It's healthier and the outer layer gets crispy this way. Also, don't drench the chicken in so much marinade that it drips off the chicken - because the extra marinade will just burn and smoke in the oven. Save extra marinade to recoat the chicken when you take it out to flip.

Rating: 3
Simple and easy with very nice results. I had no limes on hand so used lemon juice instead and I cut the chili powder in half as I was concerned the spiciness would present a problem with my three children. Will make again with lime juice and may be more adventurous about the chili powder as well.

Rating: 2
Very quick & easy! I didn't have lime juice though, but I did use roasted red pepper oil.

Rating: 3
EZ! Based on previous reviewers' comments, I marinated the chicken for several hours in a ziploc bag in the refrigerator. Adding a little olive oil to the rub helped distribute it more evenly. My husband really liked the flavor and asked for it again. This time, tho, I'll have him grill it outdoors.

Rating: 3
I used chicken wings as that was most readily available, and let them marinade for about 1/2 hour before grilling. I also added garlic powder and soy sauce to the marinade, as well as a bit extra chile powder (I love NM chile, and use the real stuff - they do make mild varieties that have great flavor too if you can find them!).

Rating: 4
From start to serving in 45 minutes and the whole family loves it. Reading the other reviews there are many different approaches all sounding good. But if it's quickness you want, stick to the recipe and you won't be disappointed. I use Penzey's Chili Powder and Medium Chili Powder, 1 tbs of each and achieve the spice level satisfactory for us and the kids. The time and temp printed is perfect but make sure the rack is positioned as suggested!

Rating: 2
The sauce had an interesting flavor and aroma that I enjoyed, but the meat itself was a bit bland. If I try it again, I think I'll double the sauce and use it to marinate the meat. Either that or season the chicken with salt and pepper and then roast beforehand to flavor the meat, and then add the sauce.

Rating: 2
I needed a quick weeknight meal so I made this recipe using a turkey breast. I added some chopped cilantro and marinated it for about an hour. It came out really moist and flavourful but you wouldn't have known there was any honey. If I made this again, I would cut the chili powder in half and double the honey. The recipe as is would be great as a fajita-type marinade or for southwestern wraps. Just a quick note - I covered the turkey breast about halfway through with some foil as the marinade started to burn a little.

Rating: 3
Very good and easy - I've made it with wings and with breasts - yummy both times! I tried to spice it up a bit too much once - bad idea. Word of warning - I managed to cause a group coughing fit when I placed the pan on a hot stove element by mistake after serving up the chicken - the chili mixture still in the pan burned and almost smoked us out of the house...a dinner party my guests won't soon forget!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts (bscb), since that was what I had in my fridge. EXCELLENT, especially with the hint of lime. The bscb were still very tender. I've made it three times again!

This is a perfect combo of flavors for anyone's taste. My husband can't eat spicy food, but he loves wings so the chili lime sauce is perfect for him. I've used this on wings, boneless, skinless chicken breasts, it works for any cut of chicken! I make it almost every week!

Tonight I made this for the second time, and it was just as delicious as previously. Again I skinned the chicken, and the flavor of the marinate did penetrate the surface of the meat. Used the amount of marinate as written for 8 large drumsticks (2.89 lbs. that yielded 39 oz. after skinning and cleaning). Let them sit in the marinate about 2 hours. We cooked them over indirect low heat (maintained the heat at about 430 degrees F.) on the top rack of our gas grill. After about 50 minutes they were done and YUMMY. Super good served with a fresh spinach salad and hot buttered noodles!!!

This was great. I let the chicken marinate at room temp for about an hour before baking. I used a whole cut up chicken (local and organic) and high quality chili powder. The whole family loved it!

This got 3 forks because it tasted so good and an additional fork because IT WAS SO EASY TO MAKE! Everyone loved it. Great with saffron rice and black beans. As I live in an urban apartment with no possibility of grilling, this is a nice summer alternative.

I liked it for its unique blend of flavors. It is a nice change for my boyfriend and I who eat chicken all the time (since it is one of the more inexpensive meats to buy wholesale). However, I agree with the comment regarding letting the meat marinade for a period of time.

This was great! I did change a few things per the advice of the other reviewers and based on what I had in the kitchen. I added garlic and green onion, used chile powder (we like it spicy!), and marinated for over 24 hours. Then grilled the chicken. My fiance wouldn't stop raving about it!

I combinied this recipe with Tequila & Lime chicken on this sitee. Marinated overnight and grilled the chicken legs. The meat itself did not absoreb all the flavor, but I boiled and reduced the marinate to 1/2 cup and drizzle it over the cooked meat. quite good.

Question to previous viewed - how much white tequila did you use?

Rating: 3
I marinated the chicken in white tequila for a few hours the second time. It made the chicken incredibly tender and the flavor went well with the chili and lime.

I added some chopped garlic, green onion and shallots to the marinade. Also, if you grill it rather than bake it, the chicken comes out a lot crispier.

The flavor of this dish is tasty. However, the chicken was waaay undercooked. The second time i made this, i increased the cooking time by about 20 minutes. Also, my family thought they would prefer the rub on skinless chicken breasts in the future.

These were OK, but nothing special. There are more intersting recipes out there.

We really liked this one, very simple preparation. We didn't marinate it longer, felt it didn't really need it, but would probably make it spicer, add cayenne next time for our taste. A keeper!

I think this recipe has potential. I marinated 5 whole chicken legs. I added more lime juice to cover and i used chipolte peppers. I think I made the marinade too spicy. It needs garlic and olive oil. I will try it again.

We weren't impressed with this recipe. If you like chili powder, you'll probably like it, because that was the only flavor that came through. Maybe marinating it longer would help, but we found it pretty bland.

I used the suggested quantities but I also marinated the chicken for about 8 hours. Rave reviews from both kids and adults. This will undoubtedly be appearing on my BBQ this summer...

Doubled the recipe and marinated it for about 24 hours and it came out very well. This is a great one for kids, but it would also work very well with other spices like smoked paprika or chipotle. Good for cold leftovers, too. This one will be a new summer standby for us.

It's easy and inexpensive. I found the thighs to have more flavor than the legs. If I make it again, I'll use thighs only, make more of the chile mixture & probably throw in a dash of cayenne.

very quick and easy. i did add a jolt of soysauce. the sauce and the outside of the chicken were quite flavorful but i thought the inside didn't taste like much. however, just had some leftovers and sitting in the sauce overnight seemed to have helped with soaking in some of the flavor.

It was a bit too hot. But maybe that's because we might have used the wrong chili powder.

Chili (with an "i") is a mix of chile (with an "e") powder, oregano, and something else, thus is much less spicy. Straight chile powder (with an "e") is simply ground, dried chile peppers - can be very hot, but there are some REALLY nice, more mild chile powders out there. Hope this helps!

I used 2 whole leg quarters (skinned and de-fatted) and decreased the marinate ingredients by 25%, and I did add 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and a bit of water to the mix. Marinated the quarters in a Ziploc bag about 3 hrs. Baked them 25 minutes before turning them for 20 minutes. This was really DELICIOUS. The suggested "succotash" was a good accompaniment (because it was a bit bland).

All winter I searched for an easy chicken parts in the oven recipe. Where was this recipe back in January when I needed to lace up my boots and put on a hat and mittens in order to get to the grill? It's good; I did add 3 cloves of pressed garlic, let sit for about 4 hours and cooked it in the oven (wasn't that nice out yet for grilling, this is New England after all). Next time I will try it on the bbq with probably better results, but it's nice to have a recipe for quick and easy chicken that works well in the oven with no thermal underwear required.

Rating: 0
It hardly seems fair rating this recipe since I vastly improved on it. Honey, lime, chile powder? Sure, but why stop there? I used the same ratio of honey-lime-chile powder, but what's a good marinade (and that's what this SHOULD be) without adding a buttload of garlic and a slug of soy sauce? I marinated for about 4 hours and then cooked according to the directions. Now, that was GOOD. P.S. All I had on hand was New Mexico chile powder, and, tempered by the honey, it just gave a nice bit of heat in the end.
