Absolutely delicious. For years I've enjoyed blackened fish at good seafood restaurants and never been able to duplicate the recipes at home. Now, this is my "go to" recipe for blackened fish. I actually prefer to use halibut steaks rather than fillets. Double the coating mixture and coat both sides of the fish. Brown both sides for 1 minute in the hot pan and then bake for about ten minutes (the halibut steaks are thicker than fillets and require a couple of minutes longer to cook). The result is to die for. Be sure to use real fennel seeds and crush them - the anise/fennel/licorice flavour is a sublime and perfect addition and there's a nice touch of heat from the cayene.

This was DELICIOUS and so easy. The store didn't have halibut so I used tilapia. I also couldn't find sweet paprika so I used the regular stuff. Maybe I'll try putting this on chicken next time for my meat loving hubby.

We use this rub with anything we put on the grille; just waiting for my wife to put shoulder pads in her shirts, tease out her hair, find my Members Only jacket and we will be done!

This is my new favorite fish recipe! I stuck to the recipe but used rockfish rather than halibut. I think it would be equally good with any firm white fish. I'd even serve it to guests . . . although fish is something I usually avoid for company! Loved it!

Good stuff, loved the addition of fennel seed. I made a mistake and seared both sides of the fish, resulting in overcooking. Dumb idea. :)

Fabulous!!! I will be using this recipe repeatedly anytime I want blackened fish. For my son's 23rd birthday party, I used Tilapia as it was on sale and then topped each filet with sauteed bay scallops and florida shrimp. As the fish was baking in the oven, I made the "topping" in the same skillet I had used for the fish, adding some butter, a little bit of commercial blackening mix (used all the homemade mix on the filets) and then finished with the juice of half a lemon. Served with mashed Garlic Dirty Red Potatoes and a Green Salad. Dessert was the Lime Mousse Cake on this website. Next time I want a Lime Dessert however, I'll go back to the Margarita Cheesecake! Back to This Recipe, you cannot go wrong with this method and spice blend on any fish of your choice!

THis was easy and delicious and not too spicy (but very flavorful). I couldn't find halibut that didn't cost a fortune so I substituted cod. I used less salt than the recipe called for

This is an awesome spicy rub for the fish. We served the blackened fish with the tropical fruit salsa with jalapeño and bell peppers (recipe on this site) to cool everything down a bit. Great summer dish!

We really liked the seasoning. Only made 2 halibut fillets, but used the whole seasoning recipe. I didn't think it was too hot, but I like spicy. I would be careful when putting the fish in the oven 8 minutes was too long.

Definitely cut back on the salt in this recipe. You can always add more when you are eating the fish.

AWESOME! My boyfriend loved this, and so did I! Being in a lazy mood, I cut up a ripe mango and served it as an easy condiment. It totally enhanced the spiciness of the fish. (Of course, mango salsa would work, but this was sooo much easier!)A crisp white wine, grilled asparagus and rice pilaf rounded out a perfect meal!

The halibut turned out fantastic. Instead of olive oil, I used red palm and canola oil. Butter was not necessary at all. As a side dish, I roasted two fennel bulbs as described in Roasted Whole Fish and Fennel with Crushed Potatoes, Perserved Lemon, and Charmoula recipe. Will also go nicely with roasted asparagus or cauliflower.

also cooked it in peanut oil so I could really heat out the pan for searing.

Something has to be pretty great on multiple levels to get 4 forks from me. This takes like 15 min to make, including the seasoning. It is absolutely delicious, easy and healthy. I made the rub exactly as stated, but divided it between only 2 fillets. I would do it the same next time, but with half the fish use half the salt (oops). The extra seasoning gave it a beautiful crust. Yes - it was very spicy with the extra seasoning (we loved it), but if you were to do the same you could just reduce the cayenne. I forgot to add the butter at the end, which was fine - it didn't need it. I disagree with finishing it on the stove, it will dry out. Finish it in the oven as the recipe says for a moist result. I served it with green beans finished with lots of lemon and a little olive oil, which complimented the fish perfectly, and the "Buttery Rice Pilaf" recipe from the site. This is a great recipe - and a little flashback to the blackened trend of the 80's! Yummy!

Excellent and simple way to cook halibut. We love this recipe and cook it whenever we can!

Oh so yummy. I seared the halibut in a cast iron skillet on both sides, then covered it and turned off the heat and let it cook for a few minutes. No need for the oven, really. Spicy and good. Went well with roasted rosemary potatoes, salad and a chilean pinot noir.

I used catfish and this was awsome. If you cut down on the spices, then you are a wimp!

this rub is fantastic. used fresh oregano instead of dried and skipped the thyme b/c that's all i had on hand. used it on tuna that had been marinated in soy sauce, rice vinegar and fish sauce. grilled the tuna rare and served as burgers topped with wasabi mayo, pickled ginger and braised leeks. awesome!!

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe many times and love it. I do halve the salt, bake it in the same cast iron skillet, and skip the butter, it doesn't need it. It is just as good-maybe even better-on salmon. Make a double batch of the seasoning and store it in a jar for next time.

to the cook from williamsburg. next time try using peanut oil (or even vegatable oil) which has a much higher smoke point than olive oil & thus won't burn nearly as easily. when I blacken, I use peanut oil.

My husband thought this was great. However, I had some problems with cooking this. I followed the directions and heated my pan, and then added the olive oil, started to swirl to coat the pan--and then the oil caught on fire!! It was pretty freaky. Although an interesting thought is if my fish had been in the pan before it caught fire, it would have been kind of like a no-alcohol flambé--that could have been interesting. So anyway, I ended up using the grill to blacken it (I should have just followed other reviewers' advice & done this from the start), then finished as directed. Other than the brief fire incident, this was a quick and easy recipe. I will definitely make this again, on fish as well as other things like chicken or shrimp, etc. But I think it is safe to say I will not be cooking it indoors in my pans again!!

My husband and I like spicy, so I halved the salt and used the recommended cayenne-WAY too spicy!! Still delicious though, but halving the cayenne is a great recomendation. We had unexpected guests so I also used the spice on calamari rings and shrimp I had in the freezer. I tossed them in olive oil and then shook them in a zip-loc bag with the seasoning. They cooked very quickly in a cast iron skillet and were also delicious!

I used tilapia and, as instructed, halved the salt and cayenne. This was a big hit and the fish was spicy, moist and perfectly cooked in 10 minutes from hitting the pan. I look forward to making this again.

This was so easy and yummy! I usually don't like halibut but this recipe was amazing. I am going to be making this one a lot for our family. I followed the advice in the reviews and halved the salt, but I should have halved the cayenne as well as it was a little hot for our taste, but the flavor was still magnificent. I put a little bit more fennel and thyme in that called for but was very happy with it. I followed the timing exactly for how long to cook the fish and it was perfection.

A great and simple dish - perfect for a weekday meal. Served it with a green salad with lemon vinegrette and some baby potatoes. I cut down on the amount of cayenne by half and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp and found this was much better than the first time I made it, when it was way too salty. The spice mix is really good on chicken too. I used the entire spice mix on only 2 pieces of halibut. To prevent smoking, the key is to add the oil to the skillet AFTER it has heated and only moments before you blacken the fish.

Holy smokes! All I have to say that this dish was incredibly delicious! I never naturally liked fish, but for some reason this dish stood out. For more flavor, I added extra sea salt and extra of all the spices, spiced and blackened both sides, which did wonders, and topped the whole dish with a generous squeeze of lime juice, and also created a a louisiana-style dipping hot sauce with mayo, cayenne, and a pinch of all the spices used. If you're a fish lover...make this, you won't regret it!

I rated this a 4 being one of the best halibut dishes I've ever had. My husband caught a halibut and we had it the same day using this recipe. It was so fresh, it just melted in your mouth. My recommendation is to find the freshest halibut possible with this recipe and you'll see just how delicious this recipe can be!

I'm a poor student so I can't afford Halibut, but I can afford sole, so I use sole instead however sole is a lot thinner than halibut, so I just cook it in the oven for 4 minutes not 8, works great

After more than a dozen meals, this is our favorite. I add garlic powder to the seasonings. It works well with firm cod fillets also.

This has been a hit for several meals. For lots of flavor I double all the seasonings except the salt. Using an oven safe pan the fish can go directly from stovetop to oven, saving a pan to wash. If you try this method, cut the oven cooking time to 4-5 min.

Rating: 3
This is a good blend of spices if you want to do-it-yourself. I prefer the same method but using Chef Paul Prudhomme's Blackened Redfish Magic spice blend. It's much easier and I think the proportions are right on. Do not do this recipe unless you have a powerful exhaust fan, or do it outside on the side burner of the bar-b-que!

I would not make this dish again. In light of the postive reviews by others, I don't know if I did something wrong, but the fish was really salty and there were no signs that it "blackened." And, my apartment stunk like fish for 2 days. To be fair, my husband liked it.

Good with halibut, but great with wild caught king salmon! I finish the dish in the oven right in the iron skillet -- why dirty another pan? Like many other cooks, I think the recipe makes the perfect amount of seasoning for just 2 servings and I add some extra cayenne with the plainer fish (like halibut).

Awesome! Great rub on anything ... chicken breasts, steak, pork chops. I barbecue (instead of finishing in the oven) after searing in the skillet.

This is an easy and delicious dish, that I will surely make again. As a previous reviewer noted, the seasoning for four servings can easily be used for two. I followed the exact timing given on the recipe and it turned out perfect.

I tried this recipe last night and used the George Foreman grill for it. It turned out delicious!!!! After reading some of the reviews I used half the cayenne and salt but next time around I will add more cayenne to give it more kick. This was also the first time I used fennel seeds. It had a licorice smell to it so I was a little skeptical but it tasted great! There was some smoking in the kitchen but we opened the windows to air it out.

great,easy and quick. Comes out perfect every time. Delicious. I always use the recipe with all the spices for four servings for just two servings of fish. I always use tilapia instead of halibut; its cheaper and easier to buy.

This is our favorite fish recipe! We don't have fresh halibut here so I typically use tilapia or orange roughy. I always add garlic powder and as others suggested decrease the salt to taste. This is so easy - add rice and steamed asparagus and its a great weekday dinner!

I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder,made a paste with the spices & 3 tsp olive oil, smeared it on catfish filets & grilled it on the outdoor gas grill. No smoke or smells in the house. Raved over by everyone who ate it.

Wonderful...I had a pound and a half of freshest halibut, and there was just enough herb/spice rub in the recipe to cover the halibut nicely. A hot rub I thought so i served with a mango orange and red pepper salsa...delish. P.S - don't use to much salt in the rub! taste the rub and add salt to YOUR taste.

This recipe was delicious. Always be sure to pay attention to the "heat skillet hot" THEN add oil and blacken immediately. If you let the oil heat up with the pan, it will fill your kitchen with smoke! This was easy and delicious - will make again.

This is sensational. I blackened it and baked it in the same skillet, and cooked it for about 3 extra minutes, as the fish was about 2 inches thick. I served it with green salad and hot bread and my husband loved it.

I made this recipe in a small enclosed kitchen without an exhaust fan. I had read it would be smoky. But somehow I needed to experience it for myself to learn how smoky. I didn't want my guests to sit in the smoke so I kept the kitchen door closed. It was terrible. I had to do three batches after each other. I thought I was going to die. I had watering eyes and a bad cough for the rest of the evening. The fish was really tasty though. Although salt seemed to overpower the rest of the spices. Maybe that was my own mistake. We used wolf fish instead of halibut. It supposedly has a similar flavour. Halibut is harder to get here in Holland. Blackening is totally unknown here. So my guests were impressed with this tasty and original dish. It was delicious. I will certainly make it again. After I get an exhaust fan or two installed in my kitchen.

This dish is so easy to make, but tastes as good as fish from a restaurant. I get very fresh halibut so that it doesn't taste "fishy" and I do cook it a little longer in the oven than called for. I also serve lemon wedges with it.

I love to cook and to eat. I hate dishes. I changed this recipe by placing oil into cast iron skillet and heating until just smoking point. I rubbed the fish with the spices, well into the meat, after I had lightly coated fish with olive oil. I blackened fish in pan, spice side down. When blackened, only took a couple of minutes, I turned fish, drained off remaining oil then placed in oven to finish. 1pan and that was it. It was great and I will do this one many times..

This dish was so easy to make and very flavorful. I had 2 halibut steaks and chose to cut one into bite size pieces. I enjoyed eating the pieces more because I seasoned all 6 sides which brought out more of the spices.

If the smoke alarm in your house doesn't go off, you don't have the pot hot enough. Best cooked in an iron pot directly over the coals in a gas grille outside.
