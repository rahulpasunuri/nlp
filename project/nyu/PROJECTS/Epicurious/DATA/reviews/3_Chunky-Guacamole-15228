Have made this several times. Everyone loves it and it's so easy! I add some jalapeno peppers to give it some more kick. My mother likes it smooth but I love the chunkiness of it.

I love the idea of adding radish to guac...However my girlfriend does not care for it..So I dumped her...How needs a woman who thinks zapping frozen food in a micorwave is considered cooking..

NO, NO, NO! I should have known better than to stray from my own.Everyone has at least one "thing" they do well.Mine is Guacamole.Try this. 2 avocado (Hass only), small sweet onion, CUMIN (a must), small tomato, 1/2 t dried oregano, 1/2 t onion salt, s & p to taste, jalapeno to taste. Mash avo's in bowl to the consistency preferred.In clean bowl, blend rest of ingredients. Fold in avocados. Chill. PERFECT!

This recipe is a good start. I added some chopped pickle, more crushed garlic, a few drops of tabasco, minced cucumber, a few drops of Worcestershire and lemon juice with more minced onion and a few finely Annchopped Spanish olives with less salt for an exciting result!

I was doubtful but had all the ingredients and decided to make this version Sunday night before dinner. This is very good and different from typical recipes. Less fat than others and the combination of flavors is wonderful. I will be using this many times this summer but it is especially good with the 1015 onions right now. You could make a meal out of this and chips but we added a few nachos and beer. Great quick dish. Do try this one.

I love this recipe... but I like chunky as opposed to smooth. The radishes are a nice touch, I make this one all the time now when making Guac.

For my taste it was not nearly spicy enough, though I did like the addition of radish. Louisianna hot sauce and a little cayenne pepper gets you there! Some cold cervesa and warm chips is all you need. OLE!

A rather odd selection of ingredients. What happened to the traditional things like: chopped tomatoes garlic green chile (NOT jalapeno)

It was easy, simple and I would make it again.
