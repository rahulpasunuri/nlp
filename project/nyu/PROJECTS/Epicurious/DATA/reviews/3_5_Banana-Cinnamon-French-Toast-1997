I just made this delicious recipe for myself for breakfast, yummy! I made a few changes as well. I used coconut milk instead of regular and added a bit of honey. I also put it in the oven when it was done in the pan just to make sure it wasnt soggy. For the end I mixed a little peanut butter and syrup together and made a dipping sauce. Peanut butter and bananas always go together!

I made this as a way to use up an overripe banana and it's now one of my new favorite recipes. It's very cinnamon-y and very yummy. Dipping the bread briefly in the milk mixture makes 5-6 pieces .

Doubled the recipe and--here's the trick, folks--substituted JAMAICAN HARDOUGH bread sliced thick (3/4"). Pure perfection, better than a challah or brioche. Bread is quite dense, so let soak for extra time and cook 5 mins per side over lower heat.

A grand success! I used the tips from previous comments by adding honey, and putting the cooked french toasts in the oven to bake and keep warm. I also substituted milk for whipping cream and used a little less than half a cup. The french toasts were tender and not soggy. Definitely a keeper.

This was good and easy, following advice of raters: Did not SOAK the bread but just dipped it. It was not mushy. Was surprised that banana flavor did come through. Used powdered sugar on top but it would have been fine with maple syrup. Oh, and just dipping it, you could make twice as many slices. Too bad I spilled it out after making 4 - before I tasted it and wished I'd made more! This is very simple. I did not add any other ingredients (such as sweetening).

Just to let everyone know..I added the honey! Sure did help...but what an excellent recipe. And to those who said the bread was too soggy...Place the slices that ar cooked on a wire rack and in a prheated 375 oven for about 5-6 minutes...This continues to cook the bread on the middle. Also, I did not soak it for too long maybe 40 seconds to the tee on each side. I also let it drip on a wire rack for 1-2 minutes. Oh and before I forget...I used day old whole wheat bread, I left it out all night... Hope this helps others...

A very good recipe! added about 3 tablespoons of ordinary honey to it for added flavor. Definately a keeper. Made another variant when i came home from a party and added a generous amount of white rum to the mix, tasted good as well....

Way too much milk which made for a very soggy toast, and I used tasty whole wheat several days old bread. I used 1% milk which is watery. I loved the flavor of the banana and would used a few tablespoons of half and half the next time or bake it as a bread pudding. Instead I added corn meal flour, some baking soda and some unbleached flour to the remaining batter. This produced a delicious pancake!

This is the best french toast I have ever tasted and my two girls love it. It's quick and easy and includes a fruit that neither one of my girls are very fond of, this way I can get them to eat bananas. Wonderful recipe!!

Add 1 TBSP Vanilla Extract + 1/8 cup sugar to batter and reduce the milk to 1/4 Cup - just flash dip it on both sides and it is great.

Not a huge success. The bread was bit "wet" for my taste. Next time I may try a different kind of bread that won't get so soggy.

This recipe did not give the right consistency to the French toast. It was too heavy and wet. I would not recommend this recipe. As I ate the French toast, I became more and more sick of the taste of strong banana with whole wheat and sweet maple syrup. It might be better with sugar instead of maple syrup.

This was easy and good, but short of outstanding.

"Fabulous,darling, just fabulous!" said my extraordinarily finicky husband, and that's NO small compliment. I love recipes that are simple and delicious, made from ingredients you have on hand...I've added a twist though, I usually use french bread & then crust it with almond slices just before I turn it over. And of course, garnish with a strawberry fan. MMMMMmmmm...

This was good but It tasted like it was missing something. I think next time I make it I will add a little almond flavoring. I did use thick slices of french bread instead of the whole wheat.

This was really good and SO easy. A much more creative--and tasty-- way of using up old bananas than ordinary banana bread.

This was an excellent recipe. It was very simple to make and turns out fabulous everytime I make it.
