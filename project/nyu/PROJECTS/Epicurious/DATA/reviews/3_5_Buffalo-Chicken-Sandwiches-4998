I've used this recipe for years and it's the BEST!

We enjoyed this recipe quite a bit. One thing I changed which I think added to sandwich was I chopped up celery and added it to the blue cheese dressing and did not use lettuce on the sandwich. We liked the added crunch and texture. Yummy!

I didn't use this so much as a sandwich, but more as an entree. I substituted a couple squirts of Italian dressing and some seasoning, and I used skinless boneless breasts, and it came out great.

I liked this meal because it was easy to prepare and fun to eat. It may not be "gourmet" but not everynight can be. I had some buffalo wing sauce already in my refrigerator so didn't make the homemade sauce - just spiced up what I had. But, the recipe gave me the idea.

I too debated 3 or 4 stars. Made it last night using thin sliced chix breast, no italian dressing and less butter. It was fantastic. Will have leftovers today on a salad. This recipe will be made many more times.

Made this last night and loved it.Used thin sliced chicken cutlets, cut down on the butter and forgot the italian dressing. I will use the leftovers on a salad tonight. This is a keeper that will be made many times in the future, fast, easy and delish.

I debated between 3 and 4 stars. Delicious and easy. The blue cheese dressing can make it a pretty sloppy eat, but it's worth it. I've also had it without the dressing, and it's still quite good. Also, I've served it as a main dish with garlic mashed potatoes and sauted spinach - a nice combo.

Who would have thought Italian dressing was the key to good buffalo chicken sauce? I thought this was a great recipe. As others suggested I dredged in flour, egg, flour, sauce, flour. This is a definite keeper. This is perfect sports watching food. I served the sandwiches with extra blue cheese dressing, carrots and celery, and twice-baked potatoes.

I skipped the Italian dressing altogether and used only Frank's Hot Sauce ( the best hot sauce I've ever had. I made this as chicken breasy strips and served it with some sides: mashed potatoes, string beans and corn. I also serve with home made bue cheese dressing from a old Bon Appetite issue. The cook from Suffolk, VA on 01/31/03 needs to get a life because hisher comments were not nearly as witty or helpful as they must have thought composing them. Overall, I've been looking for a keeper bffalo chicken recipre and this wil be it.

When we get together to watch an afternoon sporting event, this is requested second only to garlic buffalo wings.

Simple and tasty. I omit the butter to save on calories; it also ups the heat somewhat. These can be baked if you don't feel like standing over the stove; just prepare as normal than pour the remaining sauce in the baking pan. We use chicken strips, rather than making sandwiches -- quicker and easier to handle.

This is a very tasty sandwich and comes together quickly. I often have some homemade blue cheese dressing in the refrigerator, which adds to the flavor.

I thought this recipe was great! I used some of the other posters hints and I used the liquid italian dressing instead of the italian and I actually used green habanero hot sauce from Belize. These things were spicy! But soooo good! I will definately be making them again! We also put ranch dressing on the bread instead of blue cheese.

coming from a novice cook, this recipe turned out quite well! highly recommend it for those unskilled in the culinary arts, and those on a budget.

I made these tonight using hints from other reviews. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts, dipped in flour, egg, flour, sauce, flour. Used crisco to saute in. Added 1/4 c. reg. itailian dressing instead of the dry stuff to the sauce. Served with extra sauce (make separately) and blue cheese dressing on the side. Good and easy.

Mu husband and I think this is a terrific sandwich. I make it at least a few times a month. I skip the Italian seasoning and only use Frank's hot sauce - it's the best by far in my opinion.

Nobody with intelligence should eat this sand wich or think that its great.This dish is too boring to make again. If your brain has oozed through you ears and you cant make a decent sandwich, save yourself some trouble go to the nearest deli and get some buffalo tenders, tortilla wraps, lettuce, tomato and crumbled blue cheese. Arrange your stinking sandwiches and eat them. I offered to make this for my family and they removed the stove from our house and hid it until I promised not to make it. Then I grilled some chicken breasts which had been marinated in italian dressing, olive oil, crushed garlic and onion powder. I placed it on top of focacia bread with spinach leaves and mozzarella and they loved me. I have since been reunited with my stove and everytime I get out the hot sauce I tear up. Emotional times.

This has become a familty favorite. Quick, easy and very tasty. I've passed it on to others who enjoy it as well. It's similar to Buffalo chicken tenders we've had in restaurants.

It's a SANDWICH, people! Rate it for what it is! If it is contrast that you are after, I'd like to make this suggestion. Take two pieces of white bread. On one piece, spread a generous amount of peanut butter. On the other piece, do the same, only with jam. Put the two pieces together making sure to keep the spreads in-between the bread slices. (I have experimented with the spread on the outside, and it creates a bit of a mess). This pleasant dish should provide you with the contrast you are looking for.

Great recipe -- I would serve it with carrots and celery!

There just didn't seem to be enough contrast of flavors in this recipe. I love buffalo wings, so was surprised when I thought the sauce in this recipe needed more diversity- the hot sauce taste is too overwhelming, and I usually love the hot sauce on wings. This recipe needs a little work.

I hate to give 1 fork, there was nothing wrong with this recipe, but neither my husband nor I have any interest in eating it again. We love spicy food, and eat buffalo wings often, but as a sandwich ... just didn't do it for us.

A very tasty sandwich that's simple to make and very attractive. Only thing missing was an ice cold beer.

This was excellent and really very tasty. We actually breaded and sauteed our cutlets, then placed the sauce in a shallow bowl and dipped both sides of the cutlet in to coat. My husband was quite delighted with the results (he was sad when I had to tell him, "its not healthy...").

Excellent, easy, tasty sandwich! We had boneless and skinless chicken in the fridge so we did a flour, egg, flour, sauce, flour coating instead to give it some extra batter. It was a great alternative!

Oh - I made these for din-dine last week & forgot to rate - very good! I thought I had kaiser rolls but didn't, so just served on toasted Italian bread. Will make again - would be better on sandwich rolls. We really liked these sandwiches! Great 'buffalo' flavor - like wings, which we love!

A great weeknight recipe! I used less butter and skinless chicken breasts as well, and I don't think I missed out at all. In fact, without the extra butter, the sauce was more intensely spicy -- which I love! My fiance was disappointed, however, that I halved the recipe and he only got one sandwich! Not gourmet by any standard, but who has time for all out gourmet every night? Not me for sure -- which means I'll be making this recipe again soon!

Good recipe. Nothing outstanding, but if you're in the mood for spicy buffalo chicken, this hits the spot. I used a quarter cup of Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette salad dressing in place of the dry Italian becasue it's what I had on hand - worked fine. Quick and easy.

My husband and I just had these for lunch. Delicious! I used skinless chicken breasts. Next time I think I'll cut down on the butter as well.

An awesome guy meal! I significantly reduced the amount of butter called for and used non-stick cooking spray to reduce the oil as well. My husband loves this recipe and it's fast and easy too!

This is the best of diner, comfort food! My boyfriend loved it! Served with french fries & a glass of milk. All-American!!! I do, however, feel terribly guilty about serving up a greasy dinner to my boyfriend. Next time I make this bad boy I'm going to cut down on the butterfat & oil. Also, a bit less blue cheese dressing too. I'm not going to tell my boyfriend & just check out his reaction. Will keep everyone posted!

This recipe was so simple and tasted absolutely delicious. My husband was very impressed and would love to have this again. It is a good Saturday lunch recipe. I served it with homemade french fries and chopped tomatoes in balsamic vinegar.

Very nice and came together in less than 45 minutes. I'll admit I was a bit leary about adding Italian dressing mix to Buffalo sauce but it turned out quite good. I used half the butter though; I used olive oil for the rest. I also added some vinegar and more hot sauce.

I liked this recipe as a starting point. I did make major changes to the preparation though. I made the sauce, with a little less butter and a lot more hot sauce. I cut the skinless chicken into bite sized pieces, floured them and cooked them in the sauce. As the chicken cooked, I shredded the pieces smaller with a fork and pastry blender, keeping the chicken moist with the sauce. Great on the rolls with lettuce and dressing. I was really surpried that the Italian seasonings works with the sauce. I bought a 4 pack at the supermarket, we like this so much.

So absolutely very wonderful! Felt guilty about all the butter, but what flavor! I can't wait to try the sauce on chicken wings.

I thought the sandwiches were fabulous. I made them ahead of time, keeping the extra sauce on the side, and put them in a heated pyrex insuated keeper so they would stay warm while we took them boating with friends. Even though they weren't as crispy as when originally cooked, they were still wonderful. I made eight sandwiches and all the guys ate them up.

Hardly authentic, and not much better than a fast-food version. Under no circumstances should any Anchor Bar-inspired dish have italian dressing mix!

The chicken was so easy to make especially if you had left over chicken. Just put it on a hard roll with some provolone cheese and it's a perfect easy dinner with almost no mess. Great for barbeques too.

My husband and I love this recipe and so do our friends! The flavor is beyond compare. Not extra hot, just flavorful hot which makes this BETTER than wings. I tried adding Caesar Salad Mix which turned out to be a tasty alternative. I have shared this recipe with everyone I know.

Great!! But greater if you use Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing Hot Sauce. Hard to find, but has the nice buttery after flavor without the fat. Some say that you have to use Franks original hot sauce to make this recipe authentic, but I really like Frank's new product. lee

These sandwiches are the greatest! I've always loved Buffalo Wings but I try to avoid them because of the high fat content. This sandwich gives you all the great flavor with much less fat. The added bonus is that they're quick and easy to prepare
