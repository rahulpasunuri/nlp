Easy and quick for weeknight dinner. My kids both loved it and the tangy marinade. I cooked the cutlets on a cast iron skillet on the stove, and pulled them out when they were just barely done. They poached a bit in the sauce but that's ok with me. I will use the same marinade for BBQ chicken drumsticks this weekend.

You do not cook them on the cookie sheets. The recipe simply wants you to spread out the Turkey on one cookie sheet/plate and the potatoes on another and sprinkle them with salt before placing them directly on the grill. Hope that clears that up. I still have to try this recipe for myself.

Why do you oil the grill rack if you are cooking them on a baking sheet? I am confused!!!

Found this to be light, tasty, but like the previous reviewer, I was wishing for more garlic. Definitely more salt. My potatoes seem to take forever - I'd say 40 minutes. I grilled them in a foil grill pan. The char browning tasted great. Next time I'll precook them in the microwave, then finish them off on the grill.

Are you supposed to cook the potatoes and the cutlets on the baking sheets?

This was very tasty and the marinade kept the Turkey from drying out. However, I did double the garlic and cooked the potatoes a little longer than the recipe called for. The hubster loved it.
