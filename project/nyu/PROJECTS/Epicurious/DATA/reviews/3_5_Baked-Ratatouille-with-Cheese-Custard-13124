Chick peas? No zucchini? I don't know if I'd call this ratatouille, but it was very good. I agree with mare722 that it doesn't compare with Julia Child's ratatouille, but it's quicker for a weekday meal, and the chick peas round out the nutrition for a stand-alone dish. And I think I will be adding the cheese custard to Julia's recipe. Now THAT would be wonderful for company, especially since the base mixture improves overnight in the fridge.

Recipe is DELISH!!! (left out the chick-peas too) After watching Disney's Ratatouille 3x when new, I had to find the movie's signature dish recipe. Instead of chunked veggies, I sliced and layered them in the dish, then added the sause on top. (try dry roasting some of the veggies before baking to release some moisture) Made this for our Oscar Party, and it was a HIT! Made it several times! SCRUPMTIOUS!!~: )

Made as written with the exception of the chickpeas. Compared to Julia Child's Ratatouille, it was quite disappointing. The cheese custard was fabulous though. I will use it on other dishes, but throw out the rest of this recipe.

Was really good! I didn't think it was it was a great deal of work. Flavors were well balanced. Totally comfort food. Will make again. Followed recipe as written, next time I want to add more heat.

This was well worth the effort. I used farm fresh ingredients. It's been my routine to add a tablespoon of kosher salt to the eggplant and allow it to drain for 1/2 hour. Then I pat it dry before I saute. We absolutely loved this dish. WE served it over couscous. I printed a copy of the recipe and am giving it to the chef in our hospital cafeteria. She's always looking for hearty vegetarian offerings that aren't so heavy on pasta and cheese.

Tasty, but time-consuming to prepare.

Way too much work for little enjoyment and impact. Probably should have skipped the cheese custard.

I, my husband, and our dinner guest absolutely loved this dish. Really rich (especially if you use a really good olive oil) and satisfying. Our dinner guest is a meat-lover, and I'm a vegetarian, so I'm always looking for recipes he won't call "nuts and twigs". This definately did the trick. If I had the time, I might have made the ratatouille a day early and let it chill overnight before adding the custard and baking it. I suspected this would taste better the next day, but there were no leftovers!

Good vegetarian dish that I served with brown rice. I forgot the allspice so I substituted a couple of pinches cinnamon and freshly cracked dried cloves; used 1/2 c. mushrooms and garbanzo beans; I used skim milk in the custard and it turned out great. Recipe took about 2 hours to prepare, so it's a perfect dish to reheat and eat for a couple of days if you don't have much time to cook during the week.

Wonderful harvest side dish! I replaced chickpeas with mushrooms and added swiss cheese along with the parmesan to the custard. Definately a keeper.

Time consuming and messy to put together, but the bake time of 45 minutes allows clean up before time to sit down and eat. Next time I'll leave out the chickpeas and go with mushrooms. A very tasty dish, the custard idea is smashing.

Somewhat tame unless you add salt to the ratt...must do. I also add a seeded minced jalapeno to the other fruit, and a little gruyere to the custard. This makes a very tasty and different ratatouille.

This was good but not great. Time-consuming but otherwise not difficult.

This dish was actually very boreing. Not at all worth the effort. Will not be making this again!

It's the first Epicurious recipe I tried out with a guest list of 12, so I was on tenterhooks about how it'd be. Needn't have worried -- all it got me was praise! Very easy to make but doesn't look it!

This is a delicious vegetarian dish. Easy to make and leftovers reheat very nicely.
