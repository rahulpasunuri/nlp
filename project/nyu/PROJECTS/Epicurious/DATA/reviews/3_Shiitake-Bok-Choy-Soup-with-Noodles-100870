By substituting Vegetable Broth with 2tbsp Garlic Black Bean Sauce, 1tbs Rice Vinegar, and 2 tsp "Nanami Togarashi" (though I'm sure Cayenne would be a perfect substitute), I found that the dish had the perfect amount of flavor while still feeling light.

you need to cook the noodle seperately in hot water and then add it to the soup at the end. let the noodle cook in the soup for no more than a few mins... that's how most asian noodle dishes should be made.

This soup was a little bit bland, but had a certain elegance to it. I made a more traditional dashi broth than what the recipe calls for by simmering a piece of kombu seaweed in the water prior to adding the bonito flakes. I also added the mushroom stems to the broth prior to straining to add extra depth.

A friend and I made this recipe and when we added the noodles they formed heavy clumps. We have no idea why this happened.0.2
