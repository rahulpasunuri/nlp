NOt enough spices, it needs some work. It came out as a dish easy to forget nothing special about it.

I actually stumbled upon this recipe while browsing through these pages, so I haven't made this dish. I do however, make caponata at the restaurant that I work at. Our recipe includes eggplant in place of the okra, and the addition of basil chiffonade. Allspice, paprika, coriander seed and cumin are also added to give a Moroccan flair to this already tantalizing appetizer.
