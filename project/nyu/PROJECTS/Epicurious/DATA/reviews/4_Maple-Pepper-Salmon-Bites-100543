We've been preparing salmon fillets (as a main course) like this for years and it's our favorite (without over night marinating). Just served the bites for a party this weekend - as recommended, we were a little lighter on the pepper and included black + white sesame seeds. Rave reviews, however, I can't see how the overnight marinating is necessary. I personally feel that the bites would be best if they were basted with the marinade during baking to encourage a nice layer. Therefore, the pepper (or sesame) crust just wouldn't work so well.

I have made this recipe many times and every time it gets rave reviews. I have often been asked for the recipe and people are always surprised at how simple it is. I am a pepper lover but find that it is best to be careful to not overpower the salmon with it. I use very coursely ground pepper and only dip one side of each piece in it.

i often use this when entertaining. i use soy paste (thicker than soy sauce) which helps the sauce cling to the fish. we like a shorter marinade time so the fish isn't as "cured".

Rating: 4
Very easy and a total crowd pleaser. Instead of dipping each individual piece into the black pepper, I just spread them out on a cookie sheet and grate the pepper over them. Much faster and less messy. If you have guests who don't eat spicy food, it's a good idea to make some pieces with a little less pepper.

fast, easy, and delicious. I was amazed at how quickly they cooked and how pretty they turned out. Recipes like these make entertaining fun and undaunting. Even tho I used low-sodium soy sauce, the sweetness wasn't overpowering. The addition of pepper was ingenious and added a nice kick. My guests loved the bites, as evidenced by a clean platter after only a few minutes on the table (48 ounces of salmon gone in a flash!).

This is such a great, simple appetizer! I have made it tons of times now for going to a pot luck or having people over at our place. Even friends of mine who aren't fish/salmon fans love these tasty salmon recipe. The only problem I have ever had was once I bought the frozen salmon fillets from M&M meats and the salmon wasn't very good... The end result was much less pleasing than when I used good, fresh salmon. I will definitely be making this again in the holiday season. Delicious!

Very good and very easy! I did reduce the amount of maple syrup, finding them a bit too sweet. Served to two different groups of people; first group went crazy over them; the second group liked them, but not like the first. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is a staple in my house. I use a big chunk of wild pacific spring or sockeye salmon (I don't bother making it into bites) and add sesame seeds with the pepper. Always a hit!

It was great!! Since I made them for 4yo and for myself, I made some without any pepper, some medium, some with lots of pepper. All came out great and delicious!! (of course, 4yo wouldn't even try, but I'm sure he'd love it if he did). will make again!

this was so simple and tasted amazing! i cooked mine for about 9 minutes cause it didn't seem done enough. big hit-even with the picky husband.

Ugh this was way too sweet. I suppose I can see how this would work as an appetizer, as long as people are only having a bite or two, but anything beyond that is too much.

These are as good as they are easy! I would definitely make them again. May even try some Wasabi or horseradish on the side. Marinate them overnight for the best flavor!

Outstanding. Brought to a party and they were the first gone. Black pepper is far better than the sesame seed one.

I made this for my Father-in-law's 90th birthdy. It was a huge hit and so simple to make. I baked it on baking paper and the salmon did not stick or burn.

Rating: 4
One further worthy adaptation: my friend Bill adds grated or chopped fresh ginger to the marinade; good contrast to sweet and salty.

Rating: 4
There's not much to add that other reviewers haven't already said - this is great! I might decrease oven temp to 450, because the bottom of my salmon bites were just about to cross from "nicely browned" to "burnt". Watch them carefully! Mine had a generous amount of pepper (coarsely ground)...out of 9 guests, only one thought they were a bit too hot.

Rating: 4
I've made this twice, each time as a course in a "tasting menu" so it was a small amount served by itself. It's incredibly easy and very very yummy. It's important not to overcook, though, as it's much less special when the salmon is not tender.

Rating: 3
A little too sweet. I ended up sprinkling it with fresh lemon juice to cut the sweetness.

Huge hit at my lunch party for 30. I marinated a 2.75 lb side of salmon. Coated with pepper and baked in 500 degree oven for 11 minutes (skin side down) then turned off oven and let sit for about 2-3 more minutes. I also reduced the remaining marinade by half. I did this the night before. For party, I served room temp - and right before serving I reheated glaze and drizzled on top and sprinkled with scallions for color. People were RAVING about this dish. Perfect fall lunch with some crab and corn chowder and asian slaw.

Great combo even for fish haters. the carmilization does the trick. i use this as a main dish. Buy skinned salmon then cut across the fish into serving sixed strips then marinate in bag. cook in oven 500(make sure oven is clean) topped with cracked pepper for 11 min, Voila we paired this with a champagne for New years. a cal pinot noir would go well too.

This was truly outstanding! Easy and delicious! Everyone asked for the recipe. Next time I will make it as an entree. Though expensive to make, it is really special.

To save time I sprinkled with sesame seeds and fresh ground pepper before I popped the tray in the oven (instead of dipping pieces individually first as written). Fast, easy and delicious. This recipe is definite keeper.

Very yummy. Thanks to some of the other reviews, I tried toasted sesame seeds mixed with the black pepper, they were faboulous.

Love this easy recipe. I've made it as appetizer, and also as entree using fillet and cooking about 10 min. Also, once I only had time to marinate for 4 - 5hrs, and it was still delicious (altho not as nicely carmelized).

Rating: 4
smashing! my guests went nuts for these. suggestions: 1. ziplocs to marinate work great. 2. make in 2 batches so that you can have an encore (you'll need it!) 3. my guests preferred pepper, but sesame was popular too. TOAST the sesame seeds first for richer flavor

Amazing flavor! Easy to make! Don't skip this recipe!

This was *so* easy to make and a *huge* hit; I made it for a party (both the pepper & the sesame seed options) and four people asked me for the recipe. Making it again this weekend as my contribution to dinner with friends. P.S. Marinating the salmon in a Zip-loc freezer bag worked great -- easy to transport, too.

LOVE THESE!! But do NOT overcook. Served some peppered and others with sesame seeds. I arranged on baking sheet and wrapped tightly a couple of hours before cooking. Popped them in the oven and served to my guests on a bed of radicchio: SO EASY!

This recipe is a keeper. Made 4 pounds of salmon for my open house, and didn't have one bite left. I used a zip lock bag to marinate, and it worked very well.

This was great with the orange miso sauce mentioned by a previous reviewer. Without that sauce, however, it was only so so. Prior to cooking, I put a toothpick into each piece of salmon. Made serving much easier.

Really, really amazing. I made these for the Superbowl, and did half with pepper, half with sesame seeds. I preferred the peppered ones, but the two guys liked the sesame ones better, and I'll admit they were a bit more "addictive". Either way, they were really good, and really easy.

I served this last night at our cocktail party and EVERYONE thought they were terrific. I wouldn't change a thing. Didn't feel it needed a dipping sauce - the flavor already was fabulous.

Rating: 3
These were the hit of the night at a recent cocktail party - everyone was raving about them! I used black sesame seeds instead of pepper, then broiled seed-side down to caramelize the glaze on top. Served with the Orange-Miso sauce another cook suggested and would agree it's a great combination. This will be a staple hors d'oeuvre recipe from now on.

Rating: 4
OMG! Amazing!!! My husband hates fish, and he gobbled these up. One thing I would do differently next time (believe me, there is a next time), is to dip the salmon very lightly into the pepper. Because the salmon was wet from the marinade, it picked up just a bit too much pepper. But seriously, do not hesitate. Just make this dish. It will taste like you have spent hours in the kitchen. Buyakasha!

Rating: 4
As almost everyone has said before - this is an extremely easily recipe and it's delicious. A few of our guests thought the pepper was a bit too much, but others really liked the peppery flavor. Next time I make these I will use pepper on some, poppy and/or sesame seeds on others.

This recipe is unbelievable! The salmon melts in your mouth. It is our favorite marinade. Instead of using these as an appetizer, I added them to a salad with a citrus vinaigrette, walnuts and a little goat cheese.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe using black pepper, but also made some with sesame seeds. Both were great. The thing I did change was that I grilled them on a cedar plank...Awesome! I also served them with the orange miso dip as another reader suggested. Next time, I will try dinner size portions on cedar planks.

I've made this several times for cocktail parties. It's a big hit, and really, really easy. I use a similar marinade (tarted up with some orange juice and chopped fresh ginger) on a regular basis. The black pepper in this version makes it really special. I've also used sesame seeds, which are also delicious and make a nice contrast on the platter

Make these bite sizes slightly small-ish to make an impact (in the "small is better" vein). Simple, yet tasty. I'll probably also use the marinade for dinner-sized portions.

I will definitely make this one again! My nine guests all loved this one. All would have prefered this with less pepper (except one who would have prefered more), but loved it like this. Next time I will use a lot less black pepper or omit it - but this will remain one of my favorite ways to prepare salmon. So easy, so tasty! The maple syrup and soy sauce really work well together!

great taste and simple to do. As long as you remember to start the night before, it's a great party dish, because it's only a few minutes in the oven, which means little time in the kitchen.

We had this as an entree, over basmati rice, instead of an appetizer. We still cut the salmon into cubes, and dipped half of them into pepper and half into sesame seeds. A few we left plain. They were all really good. My sometimes-hard-to-please husband loved it. Since it was so easy to put together and so quick to cook, we'll definitely have it again. I was kind of bored with our previous method of cooking and serving salmon, so this is a really nice change of pace!

Rating: 4
I agree with all. Very quick, easy and an all around crowd pleaser. The pepper is a must and the slightly frozen salmon was much easier to cut.

What an excellent and simple recipe! A friend presented this on a beautiful bed of sorted lettuce greens, prior to a very nice chicken BBQ dinner, what a treat! I still can't believe how simple this is to make! She gave me the recipe and also your website! So here I am! Could you tell me any other simple recipes such as this tasty one? Thanks again for putting a smile on my face and the wonderful taste! Mary ....By the way, I forgot to tell all! My friend offered this wonderful salmon with a chilled seafood cocktail dip (also surrounded in greens on the same plate),(which I thought she had also made - but bought!)...wow!! She didn't add the pepper, but before the oven she pressed at least one side of the salmon in sesame seeds, then baked. Can I say more!!! Believe me, you will never be able to forget this experience... ever!! :) To make the salmon easier to cut, you might want to place it in the freezer to firm it up a bit, the amount of time in the freezer would depend on the thickness of the salmon.

Excellent! And don't be timid about dipping the bites into fresh ground pepper. The blandness of the salmon and sweetness of the maple syrup cry out for this delicious accent, especially if you're serving it with drinks.

I have made this twice to serve as an appetizer and they were inhaled! Big hit with my friends. I cooked a tad longer than 3-4 minutes...more like 5-6, but they definitely didn't dry out. Probably the easiest thing I have ever made and will definitely prepare again.

Rating: 4
The hit of my cocktail party! Everything you could ask for: easy to prepare, easy to find ingredients, tastes fantastic. Even guest who said they don't like salmon tried it and loved it! I just topped with a generous portion of freshly ground pepper, which was plenty. I'd also suggest having your fillet skinned at the market--I found it the hardest thing about the preparation. Also make sure to follow the direction about making sure all pieces are submerged in the marinade, as the pieces become almost carmelized where submerged.

We didn't use nearly so much pepper. I cut the skin off after the marinading time was complete, but before baking--how did others handle the skin? We set out Dijon mustard for dipping, and people seemed to enjoy this addition.

This is the one of the most impressive and yet easiest recipes I've made for a party (and I've made many over the years). I heeded the advise of others and went easy on the ground pepper, mostly because my arm got tired of grinding! The result...fabulous! and my guests couldn't get enough.

I made this dish for company the first time. I let it marinate a little longer than the recipe called for. Also, I used salmon steaks, as opposed to pieces.
