Made this for a large, late afternoon gathering in the fall at a friend's house. By the time I was ready for dessert there was none left! People almost licked the baking dish clean!

Sorry, I would rate this cake as very ordinary & not up to the standards I usually find at this site. It was; however, easy.

Just made this for company and it turned out great. I substituted regular raisins that I cooked for a few minutes to softed and used 5 medium sized apples. Cooked perfectly at about 50 minutes. Defenitly will make again.

Great cake! I halved the recipe, went down to 1 egg, but kept the amount of rum at 1/2 cup. I also soaked the raisons in the rum. Mmmm

Since my neighbor just gave me a bunch of apples from her tree I decided to try this recipe. Despite the fact that I used a 9 x 13 glass baking dish instead of a metal pan, this cake worked out really well. I baked it for about 55 mins. and it was perfectly done - moist but not like pudding in the middle. I think the apples I used were not that juicy so this may have helped. Anyway, a really good cake - enjoyed by me, my husband and my neighbor who donated the apples!

I took this cake to a dinner party. Everyone raved about it! I heard later that the rest of the cake was finished off the next day and people are still talking about it. I made the cake in a 10" spring form pan and it took about one hour and 15 minutes to bake. I thought the presentation was a bit nicer than a standard 9x13" pan would have been. Just delicious!

The flavor of this cake is good, although it borders on too sweet for my taste. I had to bake it for an extra 20 minutes, and it still was a little gooey in the very center. My guess is that the liquid from the apples, which were very juicy, changed the consistency of the batter while it baked. If you're an expert baker, you could probably tweek this a bit and it would be fabulous, but I'm not sure if the recipe works as printed.
