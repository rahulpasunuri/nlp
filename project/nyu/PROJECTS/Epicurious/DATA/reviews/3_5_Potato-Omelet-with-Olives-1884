Very filling. Tasty and an interesting combination, although not an instant favorite. Probably won't make again as written but may play around with it a bit more.

Just made this for lunch because I had all the ingredients. The potato was leftover from last night's dinner, so all I had to do was dice it. My husband thought the olives were a great touch. I'd make this again.

I didn't have green pepper so substituted diced roasted red pepper. After I diced the cooked potato, I sauteed it briefly with the onion and pepper in a little olive oil. I used only 4 eggs and prepared it like a fritatta, adding the vegetables to the eggs, then finishing it under the broiler. Great for a tasty, light supper for 2. Good flavors.

Very Good. I made this for 8 people so I turned it into a scramble instead of an omlette. Cut the egg amount in half and used orange cheddar cheese. The olives added a nice flavor.
