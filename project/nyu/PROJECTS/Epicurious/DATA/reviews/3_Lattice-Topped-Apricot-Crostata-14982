I used this basic recipe to make my own version of a nut-free linzer tart (I'm allergic to nuts but my German mom wanted an old-fashined Linzer Torte), and it turned out great. I made the pastry dough according to the directions, but added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon each ground cloves and ginger. Then I used raspberry jam instead of the apricot filling. The dough was a little difficult to work with (definitely freeze it as directed) but it was delicious. Everyone said it was better than the traditional ground-nut crust - not as dry. I'm making it an annual tradition.

The pastry is great and keeps its crispness, but using straight apricot jam makes this dessert very sweet. The jam should either be cut with a little lemon juice to taste or add a few tart berries (boysenberry or marionberry) to lessen the sweetness. Otherwise the tart is very good to eat and impressive in appearance.

Excellent dessert !! Have made it several times. It takes some time, but is fairly easy to make. I have used a variety of preservers, with my favorite being Mango, which I served with a coconut ice cream. Got great reviews from all my guests.
