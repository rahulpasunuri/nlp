This was as dull as I was afraid it would be. I tried it because I thought I was missing something and was curious to see how it would come together. No surprise--it was just what I thought it would be.

Great flavors, but the cooking time is way too long if you like your tuna rare. Next time I'll cook for just a few minutes.

Delicious! The lime juice gives a refreshingly tangy taste to the already wonderful marinade, and the combination of ingredients on the kebabs is wonderful. We did substitute zucchini for cucumbers (the idea of grilled cukes seemed shkeevy), and added mushrooms. The only trouble was figuring out how to cut the fennel so that small pieces don't result, which are hard to skewer. But grilled fennel is sublime!
