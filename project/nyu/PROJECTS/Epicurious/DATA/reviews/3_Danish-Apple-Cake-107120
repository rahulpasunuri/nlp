This was less than delicious. I ended up throwing the whole thing away.

I am planning on making this dessert. My grandparents came from Denmark to Iowa in the early 1900s and brought a recipe for "Abelka" with them. We have it almost every year around Christmas. This recipe is very similar, although my mother used cinnamon Zwieback or Rusk crumbs. We never use jelly either, so this may be something I will try. We leave the applesauce chunky and prepare it in layers in a 9 x 13 pan. Refrigerate and it is better the second day. Good to see this Recipe. Lori

Being of Danish decent, this apple cake was just about perfect. Thanks for sharing.

I learned about this dessert when I visited Denmark. It is an annual tradition to make this dessert when the apple trees bear fruit. We ate this at 3 dinner parties. This recipe tastes just like the authentic Danish one. Very quick and easy to make. You wouldn't think breadcrumbs and applesauce could be so delicious! It is a hit in my family! I will make it today for Thanksgiving.

Let me just say, I lived in Denmark for a year, and I had this dish all the time. I've been looking for a good recipe in English, and this is it! But I make it with a tart black currant jelly instead of red.

I can't picture the red currant jelly being appropriate for this recipe - did it turn out okay?

This came out better than I expected. I was a little worried when I realized there was no baking involved. Once assembled, I let the dish sit for 20 minutes or so and it was firmer than it seemed possible. It got rave reviews and was deemed a keeper by my husband & guests. I added a cup of fresh raspberries & strawberries. My husband suggested trying it with different fruit next time... peaches, mangoes, nectarines. I will do that.
