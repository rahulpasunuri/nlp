Far, far Easier than Pie!! I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and 3 tbsp lemon juice, about 1" of stick butter...and the 1 tbsp of vanilla. I cooked them about 20 minutes in the oven...it is possible to burn the sugar, so stir it every 4-5 minutes, and keep an eye on the color...dark is not as tasty! Vanilla ice cream with the extra sauce is all you need!

I made the Dulce de Leche Ice Cream at home from the recipe here on Epicurious, also rated 4 forks. It is very easy to make. I served this at a dinner party and it was a huge hit! Toasted Pecans folded into the ice cream or sprinkled on top adds some crunch and really goes well with the pears and Ice Cream.

This was a wonderful recipe and a keeper, but you have to be careful not to let your caramel get too hot. I suggest a candy thermometer for those of you who had trouble with the caramel becoming hard crack. Sounds like you heated your caramel too high and too long. Don't let the caramel get too dark before putting it in the oven and you should have better results. Slower gentle bubbles will prove to give a softer consistency.

Not good!!! The syrup instantly hardens into a very hard candy which no one enjoyed or thought was very good.

My husband was in heaven when I made this for dessert last night. We had some pears that needed to be eaten and I wished I had peeled and used all five of them (instead of three, as the recipe calls for) because there seemed to be plenty of sauce for at least two more pears. I used brown sugar as one reviewer suggested, and we only had vanilla ice cream, which was perfect. I can't imagine the flavor combo being better with the dulce de leche--seem like that would be overkill. Anyway, this is a definite keeper--delicious and super easy!

This is fantastic, but be sure to use BROWN sugar. (Bet the sauce is great with the right apples, too.)

Great recipe! So easy and quick to prepare. I used whipped cream instead of ice cream and topped the pears with a sprinkling of cinnamon and sliced almonds. Delicious!

So delicious....but what did I do wrong? The caramel sauce turned to hard candy when I drizzled over the ice cream. Anyone else have this problem?

So easy and so delicious! Made this recipe for a quick weeknight desert, but it's elegant enough to serve at a dinner party. While I love dulce de leche ice cream, I think vanilla is a better accompaniment to the intense flavor of these pears and the caramel sauce.

I've made this twice but did not enjoy as much it the first time because I was in a hurry, careless, and forgot the skillet handle had been in a 400 degree oven when I was taking the pears out of the pan into bowls. Ouch. This is an exceptionally delicious dessert and so easy to prepare as long as you don't forget like I did. I had a plump organic lemon the second time so I zested it before squeezing it (why waste the zest?) and sprinkled on the zest when I put the pears into the oven. That made this superb dessert even better. Comice pears worked well too.

So simple, yet elegant. I preferred this with vanilla ice cream, and think one more pear could fit and still leave sauce for topping all the pears.

Very, very good. We really enjoyed this dish. I served it as a side without the ice cream. I might use a little less lemon juice next time so it's not quite so tart.

Awesome recipe! The only thing I would change is the amount of sugar. I found this to be a little too sweet for me, so I used a little bit less sugar and it came out perfect. This recipe is a keeper!

It is an absolutely stunning recipie. We eat this, in our house, without the ice cream, but it's good with the ice cream as well. The recipie doubles and halves well. You can use canned pears in a pinch (cut down on the time) and it's still great. Also, having tried many pear-centric recipies over the years, this is one of the best ever.

I made this twice and it was great both times. Everyone raved and asked for seconds. The best part was that I made it early in the day, but only cooked it in the oven for 10 minutes. Then I reheat it on the stove for a minute or two and put it back in the oven to warm up for five. I used store bought ice cream and it worked great. It is a keeper!!!

I made this for a dinner party on the weekend. So simple yet so delicious. Everyone loved it. I'd roast the pears a little longer than suggested next time as they were still a bit hard, but nonetheless, this recipe is a keeper!

Superb! Very sweet. I recommend a good cup of strong coffee to balance the sweetness of the pears. I couldn't get dulce de leche ice cream so I used vanilla, still tasted excellent. I also doubled the sauce and doubled the time in the oven.

Simply wonderful. Try using maple syrup for the sugar.
