Why would people review this recipe negatively who haven't even attempted it? Wow! I am always on the lookout for a good GF recipe and have friends who adhere to paleo diet. Am now on the search for affordable agave and almond flour.

I thought this would be great for my husbands birthday cake .. We loved it.. No, it is not your normal chocolate cake but we are trying to get away from gluten and sugar . I just wanted to like this cake but much to my delight I loved it and so did the birthday boy...

Interesting recipe. I tried this because we have both lactose intolerant and gluten intolerant persons in our family now. I couldn't find almond flour, much less blanched almond flour (though i later remembered it is probably in the section of the store with Bob's Red Mill stuff rather than the bulk area) so I used a fine-ish almond meal. The resulting texture was not the usual for a cake or torte. But the flavor was good. Did not rise much at all. Liked the big dose of vanilla in it. On the fence about all the agave nectar. It certainly was quick to put together. But expensive because of the agave nectar and the almond meal. I think i will look for a different version of this that does not call for agave nectar. $3.99/bottle, and that is for one layer only and you need another half bottle for the frosting. Look for my review of the frosting under that recipe if you are interested.

Is this recipe a joke? Looks absolutely disgusting!

Haven't made it yet as I've recently become sensitive to almonds but more and more people, especially those avoiding gluten, do have almond flour at home. If you'd read the source of this recipe, you'd have noticed that it came from The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook.

I read this recipe, and would not even consider making it. I have a well-stocked larder but, blanched almond flour? I wonder how many readers have that lying around And agave nectar is a bad idea... Kid-friendly? I don't think so.

Ann B: If you are living in a high altitude location you may have to make the high altitude adjustments to this recipe. I am in Colorado and my baking is a disaster without them. I can post them if you need them.

I wish this recipe had turned out for me, but it didn't. Unfortunately, it bubbled up and fell. I had planned it as a birthday cake, but couldn't salvage it. Maybe the recipe as posted is wrong? It's a shame because I like almond flour. This one just didn't "rise" to the occasion.
