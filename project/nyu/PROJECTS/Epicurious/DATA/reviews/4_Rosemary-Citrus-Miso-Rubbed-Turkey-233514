I cut the recipe in 1/2 and made it with chicken instead, loved it! Tasty. Can't wait to make it with turkey.

I made this when I hosted Thanksgiving last year for the first time. I could not have asked for a more perfect meal! It was so easy to make, and I was impressed with how flavorful and tender the bird was. All my guests asked for the recipe. The only substitution was that I used Tahini paste instead of the miso, which I had trouble finding. It worked fine! I had a 22 pound turkey that cooked in just about 5 hours. So easy! And using the bag really helped shorten the cooking time and keep it moist and tender. Excellent recipe!

My Thanksgiving turkey has never turned out so well. I had to make an adjustment because my husband was a little worried about losing the skin by lifting it, so we added those onions to the puree and we couldn't find Miso anywhere, but did find miso soup paste and used that instead. We spread the paste all over the bird, using every last drop of it and threw some celery and onions on the bottom of the pan. The meal was a huge success. Thank you!

I made this turkey for my first Thanksgiving as a new Mom. It was a BIG hit! Everyone was amazed at how flavorful the turkey was. It made wonderful gravy and turkey stock as well! The only think I would do differently, is take the turkey out when the thermometer reads 165 degrees instead of 175 degrees. We took the turkey out when the thermometer read 170, and it was just a little drier than we would've liked. I highly recommend this recipe and plan on making this turkey again!

This was absolutely fantastic!! We whipped this up for company last nite && everyone was blown away by the smells in the kitchen & the flavor that the miso & citrus had given the meat. Awhhh...definitely a keeper & will have to try with a turkey, as we used the outlined recipe for a roaster chix instead. The flavors were quite exposive in your mouth. I really enjoyed the meal. The only thing that we didn't do was make the gravy, but we saved the juices & the carcass of the bird & plan on either making a soup or whipping up some jasmine rice with the juices. This recipe was absolute heaven && surprisingly you didn't really taste the miso. Actually, the mixture b/w the miso, citrus & rosemary smelled like I was also whipping up stuffing mix for the meal. Excellent! Excellent! EXCELLENT!! Thank you for this recipe.

I tried this for the first time having company over. I was totally blown away at the tenderness of the meat and full flavour.
