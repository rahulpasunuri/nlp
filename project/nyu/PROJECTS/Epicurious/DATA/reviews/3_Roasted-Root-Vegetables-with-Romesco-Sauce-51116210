I was hoping for an outstanding vegan recipe, but this one didn't do it for me. The romesco sauce was excellent, but the instructions for it were not complete. If I hadn't made romesco sauce before, i would not have known to blend the roasted almonds in with the rest of the sauce as nowhere does it say what to do with the almonds after you roast them. I found no need to remove the romesco vegetables separately-at 30 minutes, they were all done. I cut the roma tomatoes in half and roasted large chunks (about 1/3 of the pepper) of the bell pepper. I'll use the sauce in other dishes since it was so good. I did not care for the combination of the romesco with the sweet root vegetables, however. What I will try doing with the romesco is roasting eggplant and portobella mushrooms for the veggies, and tossing in some Kalamata olives.
