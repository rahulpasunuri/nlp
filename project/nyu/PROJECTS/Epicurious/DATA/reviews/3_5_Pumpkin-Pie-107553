Followed the recipe. It was a lovely texture - a very "earthy" pie that made the pumpkin the hero. Made it for Thanksgiving & yet my mom's store-bought pumpkin pie was so much yummier.

I only made two changes--I grated fresh ginger and added a half teaspoon of cardamom (thanks for the suggestion)--and it turned out great! Tasty, not bland, lovely. Cheers.

Excellent, straight-forward recipe. I might increase the amount of crystallized ginger or put in a little fresh ginger next time, but really, this recipe allows the taste of the pumpkin to still come through so I wouldn't tweak the spices too much. I made two pies and filled them up with a lot of filling and I had to bake them a long time, but they came out perfect.

This is an excellent, easy to make pie that I always get requests for. I make mine in the blender vs. changing over to a bowl and I add a pinch of jalapeno powder. You don't taste the jalapeno, but you feel the warmth. Everyone always loves it!

This recipe is easy to make and my family and friends always ask for it. I use 2 cups of fresh pumpkin puree and make my own crust and sweet cream. Very easy. Yummo!!!

This is a crowd favorite and will be perfect for thanksgiving. I used Marie Calendar's pie crusts from the grocery's freezer section and they worked wonderfully. If you are interested in using fresh pumpkin, here was my method: - Seed and de-string a 7"-10" pie pumpkin. - Cut into quarters and place in large pressure cooker, skin side down, on a trivet w/ 1 c of water. - Cook at high pressure for 8 minutes and quick release. - Remove skin from flesh (it should slip right off) and place flesh in a colander in cheese cloth to allow the extra moisture to drain out. After a couple hours of draining the pumpkin (about 1c yield of liquid), I started the recipe as written. I do not have a blender, so I simply grated my crystallized ginger very fine and used my old hand mixer to mix the pumpkin, ginger and 1/2 & 1/2. It worked wonderfully. My 9" pie pumpkin yielded 6 cups of perfectly golden cooked pumpkin, enough for three pies.

Everyone always asks me to make this recipe. I have a diabetic boyfriend so substitute 1/3 cup Splenda and 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of 2/3 cups of brown sugar. This recipe is easy to make and always disappears.

I never liked pumpkin pie, but this one converted me and my family. I used fresh white pumpkin and date sugar (kids and diabetics in the family)with a whole wheat crust from the store and it was fantastic! I sweetened the cream with agave.

Doubled the recepie and made two pies -- both came out better than I ever expected. My boyfriend even admitted they were better than his grandmothers (YAY!). Super easy filling, and I used a store bought crust. They freeze well too.

This recipe is less sweet than others I have made. We loved it! It is especially good after a heavy Thanksgiving meal. Easy and delicious.

I used home made puree, and came out with a pie which really surpassed the ones I've made before (with canned)

I made this with fresh ginger instead of candied. My family and I thought it was excellent

I was pretty excited to try this recipe with the candied ginger and other yummy ingredients. However, while it was good, it wasn't anything amazing/special and didn't taste any better than a store-bought pumpkin pie. I'll try another recipe next time to see if I can get something that really stands out- this is a good standard pumpkin pie but nothing extraordinary.
