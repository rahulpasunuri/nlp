So it's really lo-cal. But that's its only virtue. And I'd much rather use heavy stuff (cream and such) and then have a flavorful dish.

Where does the water come from in this dish? My spinach mixture was bone dry, but I was left with pools of water surrounding the finished product on each plate. Perhaps the cheese? I'm so glad I took other cooks' advice and baked this in a pyrex dish. Flavor is ok, but I agree with the cook before me:-)

Eh. Too much trouble for so-so result.

Wonderfully easy dish and very tasty. I used half baby spinach, which I had on hand, and a 10oz package of chopped frozen spinach. I defrosted the frozen spinach and wrung out every bit of moisture I could from the cooked vegetables. I also reduced the milk by 1/4 cup. The final product still had a bit of excess water that I just drained off. Next time I might add a bit of cayenne pepper for spice. I served it for lunch with a garden salad and didn't bother with the frico. The left overs were breakfast this morning.

This a good recipe that can be easily altered. Instead of using just 20 oz. spinach I used a mix of greens, including tat-soi, mizuna, arugula and spinach. Because I was already worried about how watery this would be, I decreased the milk to 1 1/2 cups. I also cooked this right in the oven- proof saute pan at 375 degrees, it was finished cooking in 25 minutes without a problem. The custard was quite watery on the bottom, which I drained off before serving, next time I will put the cooked green mixture in a kitchen towel and wring it out before I cook in the oven with the egg/cheese mixture.

Hate to ruin the reviews here but I thought this was fair at best. What's all the fuss about - I thought it was a dissapointment.

Holey smokes! One of those big bags of spinach from Costco is 40 oz and this recipe calls for 20 oz. I was bowled over at the amount of spinach this needs. In any case, I am glad other reviewers recommended glass dishes, because the springform pan was just going to leak everything all over. I added chopped shallots to help intensify the taste. This is something I can make to get my mom to eat more vegetables!

My friends ALWAYS ask me to make this...everyone loves it. Don't know what all of the comments about excess water are about, but I suggest using frozen chopped spinach and REALLY SQUEEZING the heck out of it (once thawed) with lots of paper towels. Also, do not add water when sauteeing. Also, I just keep the onions and spinach on really low heat until all liquid has evaporated. Finally, I never use a spring-form pan...always a metal or pyrex baking dish. It slices beautifully and holds its shape. Final tip: the leftovers microwave very well. Enjoy!

Really good and a wonderful brunch item when you're trying to do something low fat. This is definitely watery--the aluminum foil was a must since I used a springform pan.

I would make this again but would let the spinich cool and squeeze out the water (also add flour as the other cooks recommended.)

This was a delicious dish. I am always looking for different ways to cook spinach and this was one of them! I substituted skim milk with whole milk instead, and i used ground nutmeg but I only used about 1/4 teaspoon of it. I washed the spinach and did not add water to the recipe, because I did not want it to be too watery. I baked the dish in a glass pyrex square pan. Next time I am going to add some garlic

It tasted great & formed a brown surface. I used an 8x8 glass dish & sprayed w/ cooking oil. I used 2 Tbl flour but still watery. I looked at the spinach souffle recipes, and they use 1/4 c. flour so I might try that next time. Perhaps add bacon too. UPDATE: Tried cheddar which made the dish bland and lacking the delicious smell. 1/4 c. of flour did help, alot less water.

Delish! Made it for dinner last night and the four of us ate it all up! My mistake - I didn't use as much spinach as called for in the recipe (but will next time) and it was still great. A lot of liquid leaked out of the pan - I'm glad I wrapped it in foil - next time I'll make it in a square glass dish and just serve it out of the dish. We're also vegetarian and I'm always looking for something that carnivorous guests will also enjoy, and they did! NEWS FLASH: I just made it again today (also threw in a sauteed zucchini for the heck of it) and used my 8"x8" Pyrex dish - perfect, no leaks. That's the way I'll make it from now on.

Wonderful side dish or entree, even if you're not a vegetarian-which we are. Thank you so much for this recipe. And the Frico(s)? were divine!!!

Great flavor! Like the Havasu cook,though, I had problems with leakage despite the water test. I solved this by cooking the spinach separately, squeezing it out completely, adding that to the sauteed onion, and then sauteeing in about 4 teaspoons flour and a few drops of tabasco. Just make sure to blend thoroughly with egg mixture.

This is SO good! I added 4 oz of feta cheese in addition to the one cup of grated parmesan, plus I grated a bit more to sprinkle on top - mmmm. I also used 2 packages of frozen spinach. One tip: the water test passed for the springform pan so I skipped the foil, however the custard leaked during cooking.....My theory is that the weight of final product caused the leaking whereas the water test did not. At the BBQ potluck I brought this to, it won rave reviews, ...and the NY strip loin steaks, shrimp appetizer, wild rice casserole, strawberry shortcake dessert DID NOT!

Tried this last night and found it to be twice the work and half the results of a similar recipe I've used for years. I combine 2 boxes of thawed chopped spinach, 1 jar chopped artichoke hearts and one can of cream of celery soup with the onions, eggs and seasonings. Very easy and very tasty.
