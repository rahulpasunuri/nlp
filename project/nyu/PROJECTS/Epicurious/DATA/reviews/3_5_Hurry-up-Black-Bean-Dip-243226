Very good. Agree with some others that one onion too much. I put in 1/2 a medium red onion and that was still too much. Had to add another can of beans and two small fresh tomatoes to tone down the onion flavor enough.

Great recipe. Didn't have any cilantro but it tasted wonderful, anyway. I served it with veggies and my guests asked for the recipe. A keeper.

Wow! Fast, easy and fantastic! I too added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, draining it before adding to the blender. The lime juice in there gave it a great tang! My boyfriend doesn't like garlic so I subbed a shallot. I forgot cilantro and was worried it wouldn't taste right without, but it was fantastic anyway!

More of a 3 or 3 1/2 star but I rounded up. I read the reviews first so I tripled garlic & added 1/4 of the onion. It seemed a little dense so I added a handful of fresh tomato (seeded & skinned) which helped a lot. I also added a little chipotle. I thought it was fine but not a showstopper, however my guests absolutely loved it. Most asked for the recipe and they completely finished bowl that I put out. I thought the day old leftovers were even better.

This delicious, quick and easy. I added 2 rounded tbs. of mango salsa and reduced onion to 1/2 only. Absolutely dynamite!!!

Yummy and easy. As others have advised, add a bit more garlic and less onion. I also added some canned tomatoes with chiles. Very flavorful!

Used just a bit of onion as recommended by previous reviews. Added more orange juice. Loved the flavour. I think its the cumin. Didn't have cilantro but I think that would be great in it.

I loved this recipe-I thought it was very easy, and I had most of what I needed on hand. I will note here that I read the recipe as using a "medium" onion. Mine was large, so I cut it in half, chopped it and then used less than the half. But, I eyeballed this-I could tell I still had too much. I thought that the other ingredients really added to the flavor. The vinegar gave mine some depth. I used a large clove of garlic, and a whole lime. I also added salt an pepper before I processed it, then added sea salt after with a bit more pepper. We all fell in love....

I made this recipe today and was not impressed. Yes, too much onion and the balsamic vinegar doesn't do a thing for the dip.

i used half an onion for the entire recipe and it was WAYYY too strong, as others have remarked. i would suggest using 1/4 or less of an onion.

oh come on now, one whole sweet or hot red onion is not a lot for that amount of beans. I have made something similar to this for years now and the only thing that I pretty much do different other than to add more garlic and perhaps a shredded hot chili or two is to sweat the onions in a bit of olive oil while I prep the other ingredients. Then mix it through the dip. As for being similar to Cuban Style black beans after being there this is nothing like that dish!

Delicious - it was the favorite of the three dips I served ... agree should use alot less onion and more garlic, cilantro and balsamic

This is exactly the recipe for cuban style black beans (a side dish) - except left whole and cooked. Not very inventive or interesting. That much raw onion? Pableaux? More like Paresseux!

I made this for a dinner party for 20 (doubled the recipe). Like other reviewers I went easy on the onion. It got rave reviews! The dip was so easy to make. It's going to become a staple, as I entertain a lot.

I made this only using about a quarter of the onion that was called for in the recipe and also put a bit of shredded cheddar jack cheese on the top of it. It was a hit at the barbecue I attended yesterday. In the future I will probably add some more garlic as I didn't feel it was garlicky enough.

I caution you that adding a whole red onion was overpowering and unedible. My wife tried it again using 1/4 medium red onion and it was delicious.

Agreed, super good; a little over kill on the onion. I did not use all of it either. It was very simple and good though. I heated it up and sprinkled cheese on top.

Very good but do NOT add all the onion. I added about half of one onion and it was still pretty powerful.

Everytime I make this dish multiple people ask for the recipe. I tend to go light on the onion and garlic and heavy on the balsalmic and cilantro. It is wonderful with pita chips.

The lime and cilantro really give this a nice flavor. Beware of the amount of onion you use, as it creates a strong aftertaste. I took this to a halloween party and everyone loved it but admitted they felt self-conscious about their breath after they ate it. However, literally took less than 5 minutes to prepare. I will make it again with less onion!

I would have given this 4 forks but I ended up adding some salsa because it needed a bit of a kick. Now it's truly delicious. And it only has on tablespoon of oil so it is truly low fat and very healthy. It's got tons of flavor and is great with corn chips.
