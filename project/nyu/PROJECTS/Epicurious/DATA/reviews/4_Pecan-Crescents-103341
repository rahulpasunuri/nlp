These are great...melt in your mouth. Not too sweet I rolled them 2x in sugar. Only problem was a few broke when I was rolling them...maybe next time just do a ball shape to avoid breaking.

Classically good, with one exception: the recipe needs salt. Dough tastes flat without it. I added 1/4 teaspoon after tasting the dough but next time would, of course, add in with the dry ingredients. It provided the counterbalance needed.

I've made these cookies many times, and they taste heavenly. I add a couple of pinches of salt to the batter, and definitely reroll in more powdered sugar before serving. The combination of salt, sugar, butter and crunchy pecans make these morsels irresistable.

I first had this cookie at a B&B in Mendocino, CA and I immediately asked for the recipe. I had to look it up on epicurious but it was worth the effort. This is probably one of the best cookies I've ever eaten or made. My tips: make those crescents very thin because they spread into an unrecognizable blob otherwise. I did not get 8 dozen out of this recipe, only 5 dozen, still a good amount. Finally, only a dusting of powdered sugar is necessary or you'll detract from the delicious pecan flavor. I'm making these for Christmas, my third batch now.
