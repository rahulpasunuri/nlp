Oh, I forgot one thing...crumble the bacon and sprinkle on top at time of serving, not while soaking. It will get soggy.

I was taught this recipe by my German mother-in-law, in this same manner. I lived in Switzerland at the French and German borders in Basel, and this is how they make it! Even in the video, it states clearly that you must allow the potatoes to soak in the dressing. I always did it overnight in a flat cake pan where the potatoes could lay flat in the dressing. Simply drain before transferring to a bowl for serving. Enjoy!

1 fork means okay? This is awful. I always look at the reviews first and for some reason I didn't think time and I got burned. The only thing I can think is that the short boiling time is because you are supposed to let the potatoes soak up the broth/vinegar mixture and that addresses both the undercookedness of the potatoes and the soupiness. That said, the recipe doesn't say to do so. However, if you end up like me and find yourself with potato soup and go to the reviews for advice on what to do next, maybe try this, or instead just pour off the broth and toss. I let it cool off and sit for a bit and honestly it wasn't bad.

This recipe is a disaster! The flavor concepts are correct - but their is entirely too much liquid! Man, I wish I had read the reviews before I started!! I am a little disappointed that Epicurious doesn't test their recipes... If you find your self with potato salad soup! Drain the potato mixture and reduce the broth / vinegar by half - then toss it with the cooked potatoes. Or, hopefully you will have found a different recipe option!! ;)

They should pull this one for sure. I picked it because it looked simple and I since I'm not big on bacon I liked the fact that it only took four slices. OK, I should have read the other reviews first. It was soup. I reduced the liquid by almost a cup and it was still very wet. Are the potatoes supposed to soak in the juice? I hope so.

There is something wrong with this recipe. There is too much chicken broth; it drowned the potatoes. Was the chicken broth liquid supposed to be reduced??

I grew up in bavaria and this is by far the worst recipe for potato salad. If you call it potato soup it would come closer. And with sauerbraten one should really have dumplings.

To enjoy a proper German potato salad you have to use the basic ingredients used by German cooks. For example, waxy potatoes, white vinegar and white pepper, and what's with all of that chicken broth?

this potato salad recipe is poorly written. it does not call for celery like the intro paragraph reads. you cannot thoroughly cook the potatoes in 15-18 minutes on simmer. unless you want your potatoes crisp like apples, i suggest tripling the time the potatoes spend in the water. also, i'd boil them.

Not to beat a dead horse.. but this was terribly soupy... I am in the process of figuring out how to salvage it as we speak..

The discription indicates celery is a part of this recipe, yet not mentioned in the ingredients. 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth would make this potato soup.

This is how my friend from a little town called Massenheim in central Germany makes hers - only minus the mustard. She tried to teach me - a slosh of this, a sprinkle of that - but mine never matched hers. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe looks nothing like the German Potato I've made for many years. Mine results in a silky creamy coating, rich with the flavor of onion, bacon and cider vinegar. Judging from the video and other user reviews, I don't think I'll be making this version.

I was born and bred in germany, just form looking at this recipe: It don't have to make it to know that this salad does not taste good.

This is a horrible recipe...Agree with both reviewers...it ended up being a soupy disgusting mustard mess.

Last reviewer was correct. Final mixture is quite 'soupy' - Video demonstration confirms it! I would drain before serving. You could reserve the liquid if desired.

OK. I'm not sure what happened. I followed the recipe exactly and my potato salad is SWIMMING in mustardy broth. Could the liquid amounts possibly be wrong?
