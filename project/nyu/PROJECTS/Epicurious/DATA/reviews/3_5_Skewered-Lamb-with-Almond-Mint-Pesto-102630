Great recipe and as others have said- a huge hit at any party. The majority of the prep time for me was trimming the fat off the lamb. *Two changes I would make to the pesto: Definitely add more mint - It was subtle even after almost 2 cups of mint. Also- the pesto seemed a little heavy overall- fewer almonds and oil might have helped. Otherwise, it was delicious!

These were super-easy to make and were delicious. They also look great on the buffet table. I will definitely make them again in the summer and use the grill. I will add a little more mint to the pesto however, I felt the mint flavor was too subtle.

I served the pesto with lamb chops. The mint gives it an extra kick.

These skewers were the hit of our cocktail party. We grilled the lamb skewers since it is summertime and they came out great. Three pounds of lamb went in about 20 minutes, and I got 3 requests for the mint pesto recipe. This is a keeper!

Yum. Yum. These appetizers went quickly for my wintertime and spring dinner parties (different guests, of course!!). As long as you have the food processor, it is very easy. Super satisfying accompanyment to the basic cheese platter. Just don't feel too bad if it overshadows your main course. Guest requests for the recipe say it all.

This was such a fun recipe. Simple to prepare, delicious to eat. The pesto is really tasty and unless you plan on piling it on thick the recipe makes twice as much as is needed for the meat (I used a 2.6lb leg of lamb). I prepared a half batch and still had leftovers.
