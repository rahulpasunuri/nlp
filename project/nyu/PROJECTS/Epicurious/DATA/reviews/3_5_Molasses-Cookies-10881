Definitely a winner! I've made these about a half dozen times and have found that adding 1 T. of espresso powder deepens and broadens the flavor greatly. They now taste more like my Norwegian grandmother's! As others have , I use 1 C. white and 1 C. brown sugar, 3/4 C. blackstrap molasses, increased the ginger to 2 T. the cloves to 2 t. and the salt to 3/4 t.

This is the recipe that turned me on to epicurious reviews. *Always* read what other cooks have to say before trying the recipe. This is a "four fork" recipe when you cut the sugar in half. Thanks to all who recommended this!

These were great, with a really intense flavor. I had to make them with all whole wheat flour cause that's all I had, but you can't even tell. I cut the sugar like everyone else and made them smaller. I topped them with a simple butter cream frosting like my mother-in-law does to her gingersnaps. And then I ate four of them.

Just made them for my daughter's "pioneer days" field trip -- very tasty with the changes made per other reviewers -- 1 c. sugar, 1/2 c. dark brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp more molasses. 12 1/2 minutes at 325 worked for me as well (doing the 2" cookies). I will definitely make them again -- the kids (even my very picky eater) LOVED them! Thanks to other reviewers for the suggestions!

Rating: 4
These are fabulous! Changes I made: 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3 cups white flour, 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I accidentally used 3/4 cup butter instead of 1 cup when I was substituting butter for shortening, and they taste great, so I'll continue using 3/4c butter for the butter + shortening. I can't imagine these with more than 1.5 cups of sugar. These are just lovely, large, puffy, chewy, cracked topped cookies, just like you'd get in a bakery. With my convection oven I baked for 12.5 minutes.

Rating: 3
I made the cookies using the suggestions of other reviewers: decreased the sugar by 1 cup and used 1/2 brown sugar, extra molasses and shorter cooking time for smaller cookies. They are great! My two year old loves them, and I get to slip in a little extra iron in the form of a treat.

This is the molasses cookie I've been looking for. Great spice as written, and perfectly soft and chewy! We make them smaller than called for, and cooking time is only 8 min as a result. I do add another tablespoon or two of molasses, and only use 1 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. They would be insanely sweet with three c sugar, so thank you other reviewers!

I too followed the suggestions of others and only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar (1 cup white sugar & and 1/2 dark brown sugar). In addition I only used unsalted butter (a preference thing for me) and they turned out perfect. I baked the for approximately 10 minutes and they looked like perfect flat gingersnaps!

I also made with turbinado sugar (once again, 1 1/2 cups was PLENTY) instead of white, and whole wheat flour, and it was super duper.

I added 1 cups pecans to this. Based on the yield, I was making my cookies too small (1" rounds I guess) instead the enormous 2" rounds I made later. I didn't quite get the cracked on top, moist chewy in middle that I was trying to recreate. The first 1" batch were almost underdone. THe second 1" batch was too overdone. The 2" batch had that cracked look on top but fell very flat upon being put on racks.

Rating: 4
I also only used a little over 1 1/2 cups of sugar and I thought they were perfect... they were rich, chewy, spicy, and cracked beautifully on top. I added a tough more ginger, but I was really pleasantly surprised by the amount of cloves called for because sometimes recipes can be wimps about it. With the alteration in the sugar, this is my new go-to molasses cookie recipe.

Spectacular recipe! Made it many times. It's important not to cook these too long, but it's tough to tell when the cookies are done sice they are already brown. Basically, know your oven well and trust the recommended bake time.

Oh. MY. God. These cookies are what we have been looking for. They are chewy, spicy and just sweet enough. I followed the suggestions from "tishaslyon from Denver" and I am so happy I did. The cookies would have been waaaay too sweet otherwise. I did add 1/2 tsp. of freshly grated ginger to the sugars. I ran out of white sugar so I used 1/2 c white, 1/2 c raw and 1/2 cup dark brown. It was a very lucky accident to use the raw sugar on the outside. It gives them a nice texture. I found our magic baking time to be 12 and 1/2 minutes. My husband loved these so much he did a little dance around the kitchen.

Rating: 3
To turn this into traditional Scottish Lassy Mogs, delete the ginger and add 3/4 c. chopped, soaked dates, 3/4 c soaked raisins (both of these drained before adding) and another 1/2 molasses. Cut down on the sugar by 1/4c.

This is my go to molasses cookie. It makes a thick, chewy cookie. My husband requests these every holiday season. I reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (1 cup white with 1/2 cup brown) and add a few extra TBS. molasses. I did not make any high altitude adjustments, because there is such a large amount of flour in the recipe already.

Delicious! As people have noted, they are a bit cake-y and it is a good idea to reduce the sugar, but still wonderful. I have made these cookies twice now, reducing to 2 cups sugar (1 1/2 cups granulated, 1/2 cup brown), using butter instead of shortening, and upping the molasses and spices a bit. They also freeze well, a great fall/winter cookie!

Rating: 4
These were great; I made a double batch (which really filled my kitchenaid!) and didn't have enough molasses (was short maybe a third-cup) so I added an extra egg. I don't know if this did it or what, but the cookies were so moist and delicious for days and days later.I also used butter instead of shortening. Not too sweet or rich, just very good.

Rating: 1
If you want chewy, crispy cookies that are dark brown and shiny this isn't the recipe for you. These are soft and more cake-like - similar to gingerbread. It must be the eggs & shortening that make them soft. The only crunch came from the turbinado sugar I rolled them in. I used WAY less sugar - 1/2 cup white (unrefined) sugar and 1/2 cup dark brown & the flavor was good. My 4 yr old niece loved them. I am still hunting for the elusive crispy/chewy molasses cookie & I won't be making these again.

i followed the advice about the sugar, and they're a very good sweetness. I think these are GOOD but not GREAT. But, i can't really complain about a homemade cookie!

It can be scary to play with lowering the fat content in baking, so I wanted to share my success for those who would like to decrease the calorie count in these cookies...I substituted 1/2C applesauce for the 1/2C shortening, 1C each brown and white sugar/splenda blend (this did not make it too sweet), and 1/3C egg whites for EACH of the eggs (since recipe specified adding one egg at a time. As suggested by several other reviewers, I upped the spices, added orange peel, increased molasses to 3/4C and sprinkled cookies with raw sugar. They turned out great without messily balling the dough (I just spooned batter onto cookie sheet instead), and they flatten themselves just fine. Consistency is soft and chewy and raw sugar gives nice crunch. Happy cookie experimenting! :-D

Rating: 4
I was really glad that I read the reviews for this recipe! Used only 2C white sugar. For baking I rolled them into balls and pressed them onto a plate of sugar, so they flattened while getting just the tops coated. They turned out wonderfully and I'll definitely make them again!

YUM! Used all brown sugar, upped the spices and the molasses a wee bit. Didn't flatten them any. Nice and crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. Started disappearing before I could even put them away!

Delicious! I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Next time I'll probably use a little less sugar overall. Definitely increase the molasses to at least 3/4 c.

After reading other reviews, I decided to try the recipe as written, thinking that cookies are *supposed* to be sweet. Big mistake! These were much, much too sweet - and this comes from a sweet-tooth queen! I've decided to try them again, but with about half the sugar called for (I did use half brown sugar), because even though they were cloyingly sweet, they had a terrific texture. I also doubled the spices (except the cloves) which made them very tasty.

The best ever molasses cookies!!! I rolled them in turbinado sugar (sugar in the raw) before baking which gave them a really nice crunch!

I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Added a little more ginger, cinnamon and clove than was called for. Upped the molasses by 1/4 cup. Didn't flatten the dough balls before baking. Baked at 325 for 14 minutes and they came out great (not too thin). I will definitely make these again.

Rating: 3
I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and increased the spices. I also added a dollop of ginger preserves. The cookies came out with nice crispy edges and a delightful chewy center. They did spread a lot though, so next time I would leave more room between cookies and make them a little smaller too.

I want to rate this with 4 forks, but I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I've made this recipe before "as is" and the texture was outstanding, but the flavor was missing something. . .okay, a lot, for me. Here's what I did to give this cookie a little umph: 1) Instead of 3 cups of white sugar, I used 1.5 cups white and 1.5 cups brown; 2) Upped the ginger to a heaping tablespoon 3) Upped both the cinnamon and cloves to 1.5 tsp; 4) Substituted the veg. shortening to 1 stick of melted butter. 5) Baked for 13-14 minutes, cooled on sheet for 5, then transfered to rack. Best ginger- molasses cookie I've ever made. Glad I gave them as holiday gifts, 'cause they'd be on my hips by now!

I used Allspice in place of the cloves, used only dark brown sugar, and used all butter in place of shortening. I also added a tablespoon of grated orange peel. These turned out wonderful & impressive- good enough to give as little gifts.

These are excessively sweet. Just a little taste of the uncooked dough is enough to send you into diabetic shock. I recommend a recipe with less sugar, so that you can actually taste and enjoy the molasses and spices. Also, I always add a little more spice to my molasses cookies than the recipe calls for, but I agree with another reviewer who suggested that the ratio of cloves: ginger and cinnamon is a little too heavy.

As others before me, I made changes to the recipe (added cardamom, fresh ginger), which is why I rarely ring in on my opinion. However, after reading many comments here, I must add that these are quite delish, and not too sweet (and I have 6 and 9 yr olds doing the sugar rolling). People! You cannot substitute sweet dry (sugar) for not sweet liquid (molasses), nor can you expect the proper texture if you exchange butter for shortening.

Outstanding cookie recipe. Soft and chewy the first day. On day two or three (if they last that long) a pleasant thin crust enrobes the chewy center. Love this cookie.

I thought I had enough molasses, but I ended up with only 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 a cup; I added another 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar. The end result was a very crumbly batter and a very sweet cookie. Didn't like them much.

Rating: 4
Great cookie, nice consistency. I used double salt, double ginger, and about 3/4 more each of cinnomon and cloves. I also used only 2 cups sugar, 1 each of white and brown. Nice taste, not too sweet. I cooked them for 10 min. Make sure too wait a bit before eating after taking out of the oven, they get chewier.

Rating: 1
I love a good molasses cookie and when I saw that these received an average of four forks, I decided to try them myself. But I was really disappointed. Within minutes of cooling, they had hardened to a unappealing texture: not the delicious crumbly hard of shortbread or a nice cripiness, just kind of tough and almost stale-tasting. And the flavors that had been pretty tasty in the raw dough ended up cloying and too heavy on the cloves. Definitely not the recipe for me -- should have heeded the warnings of a few other reviewers!

Rating: 2
This recipe was OK, I wouldn't rush to make it again. I used all butter instead of butter and shortening and upped the spices a little(as per other reviewers) and did 3/4 c each of brown and white sugar. These cookies were just nice, ginger-snap-like cookies. Rolling them in sugar made them almost too sweet, I would have liked a little more savory/spicey. Overall, nice cookies, easy to make.

Lovely saucer-sized cookies made for a picture perfect presentation. The quintessential molasses cookie. Look out Starbucks - Starbucks molasses cookies taste thick and doughy and commercial compared to these. Followed the recipe exactly and scaled the first few balls of dough just to get a feeling for the size...(63 grams of dough per cookie in case anyone out there is as obsessive as I am)

Doubled the salt, used 1/3 brown sugar and blackstrap molasses...mmm...

I took others' suggestions and used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 1/2 cups brown and also used the blackstrap molasses. I also added about 3 Tbls minced sugared ginger. These turned out good - I did not regret making them - but I have actually tasted a molasses cookie that I liked better, which means that I will more than likely not make these again. However, I agree with other reviewers that they were superbly textured, with crisp edges and soft middles. I wish I could put my finger on what I preferred about the one that I liked better...

You know, I reviewed this recipe a day or so after I made the cookies, and at the time, I was pretty lukewarm about them. Well, a week later, I saw the long-untouched cookie tin sitting there, and decided to taste them again. WOW! They were really good -- very chewy and spicy, crispy around the edges. Make them, but don't expect them to be fantastic for perhaps several days!

Rating: 3
These cookies involve an excellent combination of flavors and result in a chewy center and still "bendable" outside. With the posted time they came out perfectly. For those not familiar with baking, would encourage folks to flatten their cookies a bit if the dough or the cookie sheets are cool.

great cookies. I used recs from other reviewers and used only 2 cups of sugar - 1 white and 1 golden brown. I also used blackstrap molasses. I think 1/4 cup of sugar is all thats needed for the rolling, 1/2 cup left alot of wasted sugar in the bowl.

The cookies are delicious! I used the blackstrap molasses (which I feel is stronger than regular molasses) so I didn't add the extra tablespoons as some suggested. I did add more ginger (1/2 teaspoon more). I also baked them for 12 minutes. The outsides are crispy and the insides are wonderfully soft and chewy. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 2
After reviewing some of the comments below, I changed the sugar to 1cup brown and 1 cup white. I also melted 1 stick of butter, instead of using veggie shortening. The consistancy of the cookie was wonderful - soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. Baked for 13 or 14 minutes max. My problem with this recipe is that it was missing umph. Next time, I will use blackstrap molasses; add crystalized ginger; add more ground ginger.

Rating: 2
I made this recipe exactly as called for, and although the taste and the smell of the cookies (even after three days) is wonderful, they come out rock hard after cooling. My second batch, which went in for a little less time, was softer, but still much less chewy than I would like. They look beautiful, though. Also, this recipe makes more like 40-50 cookies, not 25 - I have a huge ball of dough in my freezer after making 24 cookies.

Rating: 2
These cookies were not as good as I had expected based on the positive comments in the earlier reviews. I reduced the sugar and used a combo of brown and granulated as previously suggested. Mine turned out too hard when baked at 15 minutes, so I reduced cooking time and got a softer cookie. However, I was not wowed with the taste as I had expected.

I made this recipe as written and it was fabulous! I can't stop eating the cookies and have gained about 5 lbs. in the last week or so due to overindulging in these. They taste good crispy or soft, but I love when they are crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, sort of like snickerdoodles. I recommend taking them out of the oven on the earlier side. It's rather hard to tell when they're done because they're still soft and mushy when hot; give them a minute or two to harden up and you'll be able to tell if you've cooked them enough. Yum!

My favorite cookie recipe! I reduce the sugar as other reviewers suggest and bake about 15 minutes so they are the perfect texture - chewy on the inside and almost crisp on the outside. I highly recomend.

Excellent. Enjoyed by even the "non-molasses lover" in my life. Used blackstrap molasses, per the comments. I took out one batch after 13 minutes, which made them soft and chewy, and the other at 14 minutes, which made them slightly firmer. I think 15 minutes would yield an excessively crispy cookie. The 13 minute batch was tastiest, I thought.

Rating: 3
These were very good, though not as spectacular as I was anticipating. Part of the fault was mine-the dough was very sticky and the resulting cookie was thinner and crispier than I was hoping-but it turned out when I got to the bottom of the Kitchenaid bowl that all the dry ingredients hadn't incorporated thoroughly. If I make again, I'd add more ginger. I did of course reduce sugar and add extra molasses as previous reviewers had mentioned (1 1/2 cups sugar, half and half brown and white)-I cannot imagine it any sweeter than this.

I followed the previous advice of using 3/4 C sugar & 3/4 C brown sugar and they were fabulous. I like the shape better if I did not flatten them out.

I don't hate these but this is not the best cookie I've ever made. My Mom's family has a great recipe for Maple Syrup Cookies that I couldn't find and didn't want to bother anyone for. The maple syrup cookies (made with the real stuff) look a lot like these but aren't as cloying sweet as these - even with the recommended reduction of sugar. I'm baking for the Christmas Fair at the school tomorrow and didn't want to deal with the "nut issue" so I thought after reading all the reviews this recipe would be good. Perhaps those with a real sweet tooth will enjoy this cookie, in the mean time I'm going to bug my Mom for the Maple Syrup cookie recipe again.

Great cookie recipe! I cut the sugar to 3/4C white & 3/4C brown, plus white for rolling. Perfect sweetness - got applause all around. Note - this recipe is very forgiving. I've made it with shortening and butter & all butter, used a mixer and done it by hand (melting the butter). The cookies came out great every time. If you don't roll them in sugar, tho, the tops don't crackle as much. I liked the look, texture and tast better when I rolled them in sugar.

This is the recipe to use to satisfy that periodic molasses cookie craving. Like others, I used the full amount called for, half white sugar and half brown sugar (to make them softer). It was sweet, but good. I used Blackstrap molasses. (I mean, if you want molasses, go with MOLASSES). I can't say enough about these cookies. Just thinking about it makes me want to go have another right now.

These cookies are very dangerous - you cannot eat just 2 or 3! Everyone who tried them at my open house just had to have the recipe. They are crunchy on the outside and softer in the center - and I especially liked that I didn't have to refrigerate the dough first. When I am in the mood to bake, I hate waiting 2 - 3 hours for the dough to be ready!

Very good cookies! I didn't have cloves or ginger, so I used some allspice instead and I put in about 1/2 cup of carob powder that I had in the cupboard. The carob gave it a slightly nutty flavour, which was nice, and the allspice seemed to work alright. I will definitely make these again and would especially like to try them with the ginger.

With some modifications as suggested by earlier reviewers (cut sugar to 3/4 cup brown sugar plus 1/2 cup white, and add an extra 2 tablespoons molasses, bake 12-13 minutes), these turned out very, very good. They have a slightly chewy exterior, soft interior, lovely cracked top. I didn't roll them in sugar and don't think they needed it. Next time I'd reduce the amount of cloves to 1/2 teaspoon, as that taste was a bit too strong. But definitely one to make again.

Divine flat and chewy cookies!!! I had no large granular sugar to roll them in so I substituted crystalized ginger. Just press the ball of dough into ginger chunks, they will distribute throughout the cookie when baked....Wow..nice match with the molasses.

I moved to England 2 years ago and have recently been craving molasses cookies, but - they don't actually have molasses here. So I decided to try making these with the closest thing I could find, which is Black Treacle. It worked well, so in case anyone else was wondering if black treacle is a good substitute for molasses, it seems to be. I also changed the amount of sugar, following the recommendations of the earlier reviewers. But I found that there was no way I was able to mix in all 4 cups of the flour mixture. This may have been becuase I was using a spoon rather than an electric mixer, but the cookies turned out just fine with just under 3 cups of flour. They did turn a bit hard around the edges about an hour after coming out of the oven, but I divided them up into a bunch of smallish tupperware containers and after sitting in a closed atmosphere overnight they were perfectly soft again by the next morning. I'm not sure exactly why this was, but they kept deliciously for over a week. I'll definately be making these again soon!

This is a great soft molasses cookie (with modifications). I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup, half of that brown, added 2 TBSP extra molasses and rolled them in raw sugar. The dough is quite soft, so I refrigerated them before rolling them and I froze them prior to baking them (added a couple of extra minutes to the baking time) It is a little tricky determining if they are done or not because of the color. But they turned out a perfect circle with just the right amount of chewiness. My family loved them. I will most certainly make these again and again.

My husband just made these cookies using the suggestions of previous posts; i.e., 1 1/4 cups sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of the 3 cups called for, and they were excellent. Probably the best cookie I have ever tasted. Great for the holidays. Definitely rivals Starbucks.

Fantastic cookie recipe! I make a double batch and freeze the cookies after they have been formed and then place them in a ziplock bag. They are then wonderful for impromtu vsits from friends. 10-12 minutes (I have a convection oven) and the house smells great too. Several people have requested the recipe.

if the total sugar is 1 1/4 cups and about half of it is brown and you add an extra 2 tablespoons of molasses, you get a cookie almost exact to the incredible chewy ones starbucks makes ... for anyone out there that is as addicted to the 'bucks molasses cookies, make this alteration and thank me later! ;-)

This cookie is absolute perfection...with a few alterations. Yes, the sugar quantity is a bit skewed. However, I have made these 'altered' cookies a dozen or so times with perfect results. I substitute 1 1/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup dark brown sugar for the 3 1/2 cups the recipe originally calls for. Also, be sure to carefully scoop the flour into your measuring cup to avoid packing the flour; this will ensure they turn out tender and moist. And, as always, DO NOT OVER MIX the batter, cookies should be blended with the same care as muffin batter...too much gluten released will toughen up your finished product. Finally, do not over bake them, I cook them for 13 minute using an ice cream scoop for even baking and uniform size...which works beautifully. Enjoy!Thank you Mocha Molly's.

OK, I've made this twice now. The first time I followed directions exactly and got very-very sweet, hard cookies. The second time I took everyone's advice and cut back the sugar and make extra large cookies. These were much better, but I am still looking for the perfect Molasses Cookie recipe. I guess I'm looking for a darker, richer cookie- much like the kind you can buy at Starbucks! I wonder if brown sugar would accomplish this?

Wow, way to sweet! Yes sickening. I should have read the reviews before baking these. But I'm sure I'll make them again; only next time I will cut the sugar back to only 1 1/2 cups and go from there.

These are GREAT! I am not a molasses cookie lover, but could believe how yummy they are. Our family, neighbors and people at work all want the recipe.

These cookies were as good the next day, as they were warm out of the oven. Everybody's favorite at last night's Valentine's dinner.

Sorry, this cookie was way too sweet. I usually follow recipes closely so I did not heed the advice of the previous reviewers. There wasn't much I did like about it--I still have some in the freezer from Christmas and will most likely toss them.

I made samller cookies - about 1-1/2 inch balls and baked them for 9-10 minutes. Was hoping for puffier cookies, ut they taste wonderful.

I have one word for these cookies: AWESOME! My daughter wanted to make molasses cookies for a class assignment, so I chose this recipe because it looked easy. Boy, are they good! It makes many more than 25 cookies -- we got about 35 huge cookies! I will definitely be making these again and again.

I have made these cookies more times than I can count. Everyone loves them, especially around the holidays. I usually bake by rounded tablespoons and get about 4 dozen from the batch. They are still soft, chewy and delicious.

I just made these cookies again, and loved them! I could eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I used the suggestion to cut the dough into eighths then roll each eighth into three balls and they came out perfect!

These came out perfect and looked terrific with the cracked tops. I did cut back the sugar to just over 2 cups, I was afraid the texture would be compromised but they were fine - a crisp outside with a chewy inside. These are better the next day.

I love these cookies! I've made them several times and have tinkered with the recipe a bit. Here's what works best for me -- I cut the cloves back to 1 teaspoon (just thought it was a little strong), reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups, chill the dough a few hours, and cook them at 350 (though that may be just my oven -- 350 gives me a puffier cookie than 325) My family loves them!

I was looking for a softer cookie, but the taste was great.

Rating: 4
These are wonderful large chewy cookies if you do it right. The easiest way to get the correct size and amount of cookie, I've found, is to turn the finished dough out onto a board. Divide in half, then in quarters, then divide those quarters in half. Now each ball can be divided in 3 to equal 24 cookies. The balls will be about the size of plums. Be sure to spoon the flour into cups lightly when measuring. And don't overbake even a minute. The charm of the cookie is the crisp exterior and chewey inside.

These cookies are great!! I made them with a bit less ginger & grated cinnamon fresh from the stick. Instead of rolling in the extra half-cup of granulated sugar, I rolled them in half-cup of coarse sugar for a little crunch. I will surely use this recipe again!! Yum yum!

Very good! My kids ask for this recipe all of the time. Not too much spice for them. I prefer the Ginger Spice Cookies. They're out of this world!

This is absolutely the best molasses cookie. I did cut back to 2-1/2 cups sugar in the recipe with 1/2 cup for rolling. Excellent recipe -- this will become one of my staples for Christmas cookie baking.

Rating: 3
Delicious! I added an extra egg by accident and made small cookies (ended up with about 4 dozen I think), baked at 325. I burned three batches because I don't have a timer and just judge by color (golden brown) but the ones that I didn't burn were the perfect combination of crisp and chewy.

Rating: 4
I made absolutely no changes to the recipe. Used the full amount of sugar and thought it was fine. Be careful with the cooking time. 15 minutes was too long. After the first batch, I cooked the cookies for about 11 minutes, and they stayed slightly chewy in the center. Of course, my cookies were a lot smaller than the recipe called for, so this could account for the difference in cooking time. The recipe made about 75 cookies, by my estimation.

My son's 10th grade history assignment was to make molasses cookies for his class because they are studying the molasses act. The class will vote today on who's cookies are the best. We cut down on the sugar as suggested and they are yummy! We'll let you know how he does in the voting!

Wow! This cookie lives up to its reviews. My son couldn't wait for the sugar cookie dough to chill enough to make xmas cookies, so we searched here to find something else. The reviews for this cookie were unbelievably high--its a spiced molasses cookie for goodness sake! He looked skeptical (and I was partially, but I take the reviews here pretty seriosuly for I know these are informed critics). As many recommended, I cut down on the sugar, using 2.5 cups of sugar (I'd cut that back more by .5 - .25 cups for 2 - 2.25 in the dough--in future) and allspice substituted for cloves (no cloves on hand). They are perhaps the most perfect cookie I ever made. My son (11) stated that this was the best cookie that he had ever eaten. (We ate them still warm with milk. What a wonderful dunkin' cookie!) He's taking some to our neighbors now.

These cookies have become one of my few select holiday treats - always made to rave reviews and recipe requests. Followed the advise of others and cut back sugar to 2-1/2 C in recipe and 1/2 C to roll. If you're looking to make big, beautiful bakery-style cookies with lovely cracked tops, these are it!!!

Absolutely delicious! Never baked with Molasses until I saw this recipe. My family liked them so much that now I bake two recipes at one time and it has become our favorite cookie.

I mistakenly added an extra egg and worried about what the result would be. What a happy accident! They were slightly crisp at the edges but beautifully soft and toothsome in the middle. The entire batch was gone in one day! The perfect cookie recipe for a winter afternoon.

I've made these at least 4 times now and have all of my friends making them as well. I agree with everyone on using only 2 cups of sugar, and I add in ground anise seeds as well for a little extra kick.

Took note of the suggestions and used all butter and 2 cups of sugar. Made mine a bit smaller so I ended up with 30 cookies. Shortened the baking time, but could have cooked longer as they are chewy, a bit under done chewy. Hoping they harden a bit. Still good, but I'll stick with my other recipe.

I also cut down to 2 cups of sugar and the cookies came out awesome. They just smell like the holidays and taste divine.. I recommend them. Great addition to my holiday cookies!

These turned out great! The only changes we made were to use less sugar - 2 cups and cook for less than 10 minutes. (I have a convection oven and it cooks faster.) Would definitely make these again!

Mmmmm! This recipe really wasn't what I was looking for (I wanted a darker, more molasses flavored cookie), but they were fabulous just the same! DEFINITELY heed the advice of the other reviews and go with 2 cups of sugar and all butter. I uppped the amount of spices in this by a pinch or two and added about 1/2 tsp finely ground white pepper and a bit of ground star anise to give it some kick. They made the house smell divine! Also, make sure you don't let the dough get too warm (I refrigerated it between batches)or it may spread when you bake it.

I also changed the recipe to have all butter and 2 cups of sugar. The cookies turned out so delicious--a perfect recipe for a care package to a kid in college. I think that if you have had a problem with this recipe, you should check your oven temperature. I think if the oven is too hot this could really be bad. I have an old convection oven, and I reduce the temperature and check after 8 minutes. Don't overcook this recipe. I left them in for about 10 min. or maybe even less. These were really great.

I had a craving for moist molasses cookies, even though I have been trying to cut back fat in my diet. So I made a change to this recipe to create a low-fat, still delicious cookie. I substituted 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce for the butter and oil. The cookies turned out with kind of a different texture, but they had a nice shape and were spongey in the middle. They tasted excellent and my family devoured them.

I had made these at x-mas time and gave them to many friends and they were a huge hit....but I had no idea how much so until this week. The daughter of a dear friend narrowly escaped (by inches) the plane crash at the Pentagon. Her mother called and asked if I would bake her these cookies. She had fallen in love with them at the holidays and thought it would make her daughter feel better! There is no better reason to bake!! I, too, cut down on the baking time, 12-13 minutes, on an air-bake sheet, is perfect.

Excellent! thanks for the good advice Milton MA. Next time I'll use even less sugar - probably just over a cup - and a few Tbsp more molasses. Baking time perfect, no running, and good the next day. Finally an easy yummy cookie recipe that we all like!

I have made these cookies many, many times. They have become my signature cookie -- that which I am always requested to bring to Potlucks. I used to follow the advice given below to reduce the sugar to 2 cups in the recipe, but yesterday I ran out of sugar and was only able to add 1 1/2 cups of sugar (I never roll them in sugar). This was surely the best batch yet. I will always make them with 1 1/2 cups of sugar going forward (remember, the molasses add a lot of sweetness as well). I also bake them for no more than 12 minutes and they always have a really nice, soft consistency. I would urge the last reviewer to try again. This is one of my most favorite all-time cookie recipes.

Talk about disappointment! After all the reviews I decided to try this recipie, and I have several complaints about it. I for one followed the recipie to the "T" as I always do, the cookies were truly the sweetest "going on sickening sweet". The shape of the cookies was not appealing really, yeah they came out round but they were flat not nice round and puffy with a crackle top. They spread as if there was a flood going on. The cookies came out very gooey and once cooled they started to get tough, I honestly don't want to know what are they going to be like tomorrow. I have a huge amount of batter I have to dispose of now and all I have to show for all of my work is dirty dishes and tough as rocks cookies. I messured everything accurately, did all of the processes described and I am no novice to making cookies and baking. There is something fundamentaly wrong with the recipie. I believe that recipies specially comming from a well known source should be true and tried not just posted to fill up space and brag about how many thousands of recipies the site has. I have tried other recipies from this site and there is often tweaking to be done in order to get the right result. Better quality, less fill up I say!

I followed the recipe to a T ( maybe even under baked them) and yet my cookies came out super crunchy. Where did I go wrong? The flavor was still great - nice and spicy - but mine were hard to eat unless dunked in milk.

I used to live in Whistler and this deli there,"Auntie's Em's" used to make the best molasses raisen cookies. I will miss them no longer :) This recipe is it! I read the reviews and cut the suger back to 2 cups. Plenty sweet enough. I also baked them for about 11 mins. This recipe made alot!! I made 24 huge cookies and froze the rest of the cookie dough, It will produce the same amount. My family loved these. Will be making alot.

This is the molasses cookie I've been trying to make for years. I've passed the recipe on to several grateful friends and don't know how anyone who likes ginger and molasses could possibly be disappointed.

These are wonderful and smell incredible while baking! I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups (3 would be sickeningly sweet), used all butter and substituted allspice for cloves, which I think overpower most recipes. Underbake a bit to get a chewy texture. And FYI, they nearly burned-up my hand-mixer. The dough is quite stiff and better suited for a standing mixer, such as Kitchenaid.

These are possibly the best cookies I've ever made. I have to ration myself to only eating one or else I would eat far too many. They are soft, chewy and bursting with flavor. We have joked that I could sell them to Starbuck's & make a fortune

Thes went over very well with my family.I cut back the sugar to 2 cups,omitted the ginger and cloves(as I did'nt have any)raised the cinnamon to 1 1/2 t ,added 1 1/2 t of nutmeg,and 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal to boost the iron content.I also substituted the shortening(which also was not available) with another stick of butter and cut back the cooking time to 10 min.We keep them in an air tight container and store them in the cupboard,as the fridge tends to make them hard.

I read the reviews ahead of time and cut the amount of sugar. I added some cinnamon to the sugar that I rolled the cookies in. It a was a nice touch. Since these were included in holiday gift baskets, I also used a cookie cutter to add a faint impression of a tree or star or gingerbread man on the flattened cookie dough. They turned out great!

These were incredibly good. I followed one reviewer's suggestion and cut the sugar back by a half a cup. I think next time I'll try cutting it back by 3/4 of a cup. They were still a little too sweet for my taste. But they had great flavor and texture and I'm looking forward to making them again.
