This does sound like it would be good with some lemon, maybe zest some in? Also, thought I haven't made this yet, I would also consider putting garlic in with the parm, mince it really fine or buy garlic paste from the store. I would also try substituting broccolini for a nice subtle change in taste. Just a couple thoughts, happy eating!

My hubby's favorite way to eat broccoli.

Easy and yummy. I use lemon infused olive oil, and toasted pine nuts are a good addition. It's good over pasta as well.

This was by far the yummiest broccoli I've ever had. So simple, fast, and tasty. I'll definitely be adding it to my regular rotation.

I slightly overcooked my broccoli. but you know what it was still good. Simple dishes require really good ingredients. I will make it again. I served it with steamed fish.

This was okay. I would have used a different cheese  the parmesan does not melt as easily, so some pieces had cheese on them and some didnt.

this is my boyfriends favorite item for dinner. he makes me make it every week. i make it just as the recipe calls and it's always a hit. i even bring a giant plate of it to parties and it's gone in an instant!

I added lemon zest as others suggested and was liberal with the black pepper, but it was decidedly underwhelming. It also didn't help that the cheese clumped together into grainy blobs but didn't really melt.

I, gulp, used gruyere instead of Parmesean and it was spectacular. I also used a bit less oil than recommended. Finally, added some black pepper. This recipe is a terrific base from which you can play with.

It was pretty good... I added lemon zest and it was better. Perhaps some black olives or capers?

To A Cook, wow, I thought the last reviewer was being harsh but honestly, what ARE you talking about? Bizarre. Anyway, made this. Loved it. Agree that spicing it up makes it even better.

The addition of cracked pepper (black or white) and some finely grated lemon zest make this so good it could serve as the main course. Use the freshest broccoli you can find, and only high quality cheese and olive oil.
