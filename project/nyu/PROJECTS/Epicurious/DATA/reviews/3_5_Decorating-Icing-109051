This icing was just what I needed to ice sugar cookies for my son's birthday, though I did end up needing the extra teaspoon or two of water that the recipe suggested I would need. It was relatively forgiving since I took forever to ice 3 dozen small cookies while doing other things to get ready for the party--the icing thickened a bit as it sat, but it still responded nicely after a good stir. I found a link to this recipe under the "alphabet cookies" recipe, but for some reason this recipe doesn't link back to that cookie recipe in the same way. To be clear this is decorating icing for cookies (not cakes). If you're looking for a good cake decorating frosting, search "creamy vanilla frosting" on Epicurious--it will change your life!

I intended to use this recipe to pipe flowers and decorations on a cake and it was a total flop. The frosting was far too soft. Would be better suited to spreading on cookies with a spatula rather than try to pipe.
