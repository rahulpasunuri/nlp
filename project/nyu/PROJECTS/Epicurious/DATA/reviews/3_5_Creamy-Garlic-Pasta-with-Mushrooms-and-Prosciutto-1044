Granted I used the recipe as a guide.... I added 1/2 cup white wine to the sauce, and this made it take FOREVER to reduce. I pressed the garlic into the sauce, and I agree with others that it could've used more red pepper. I also added shallots to the mushroom mixture for a little depth. The sauce ended up being a little thinner than I would have liked, but the taste was quite nice. I had a problem with my cheese all clumping together though. As long as no one minds getting a clump of peas and cheese, it's great!

Delicious. Added a bit extra broth and cream (1/2 and 1/2) since I was adding extra veggies (more mushrooms, broccoli rob, snap peas, roasted red pepper). Therefore simmered it longer too (about 30 minutes). Of course, doubled the garlic. Didn't use any meat. Mixture of whatever cheeses we had - just shy of a 1/2 cup. The end result is a surprising light and fresh taste for the heavy cream with an amazing garlic background. Will certainly make again.

This is a great recipe with simple, easy to find ingredients. The fragrant mushrooms are really what makes it happen. I added a little bit more than the recipe called for, only because I didn't want the last few left in the carton to go to waste. The proscuitto and peas add a great addition to the flavor. I've made it twice already, as it takes no time at all. It doesn't make a large amount of the cream sauce, but I think that's the point of the recipe since it's made with heavy ingredients like cream and lots of cheese. You're supposed to taste both the pasta and the sauce, not slather and drown your pasta in it. Best with pasta cooked al dente.

I used ham instead of proscuitto. I minced the garlic and sauteed it a little bit before adding the stock and low-fat sour cream, which I substituted for heavy cream. I had some time, so I let the sauce simmer for a while, and I found it plenty thick, especially if you add it to the pasta pot and lot all those flavors marry for a little while. My wife has high standards and she quite liked.

If you are concerned it might be a bit runny, cut back on the chicken broth. I only added half of it and it was fine. If it gets too thick you can always add more. We thought this was excellent.

Mine didn't thicken either which was a major drag (I'm guessing it's because of my using fat free half n half; but that has thickened things before so...). That being said, the flavors were OK with the potential to be better. You should definitely increase the amount of crushed red pepper flakes and garlic. it's OK to use other fresh mushrooms (I used oyster and shiitake). I also recommend you cook the prosciutto strips in the mushroom pan for a few minutes to provide more texture. I'd pepper and lightly salt the mushrooms as well (I didn't find it too salty from the prosciutto). There are better ways to approximate this dish and I'm not going to try it this way again.

I was looking for a recipe to feature the new spring peas from the garden and this one looked perfect. Due to the cautions from earlier reviewers about salt, I substituted a broiled slice of high quality ham for the prosciutto and sliced it as directed. The dish was delicious. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
I thought this turned out really well, so I am a little bit surprised by the number of people who thought it was bland. It is a little rich, so I wouldn't do it regularly, but we really liked it. To lighten it a bit in the future, I might try it with grilled chicken rather than proscuitto. BTW, I agree that the direction is lacking on what to do with the garlic--I just sliced thinly. I couldn't discern their texture in the finished sauce, although the good garlic flavor was there.

Pretty decent pasta recipe, but I would definitely double the sauce or reduce the amount of penne. Instead of peas, I used edamame, which added a nice pop, and spinach.

1/2 & 1/2 works just as well as cream; make sure to use only 12oz. of pasta if yours has turned out dry in the past.

When you read serious suggestions, take heed. Yes--double the sauce and the garlic. My sauce did not thicken (as others had experienced as well). Did not have the intensity I was seeking. Prosciutto is much too salty for this dish--cut amount in half.

I was actually very suprised at how good this was, since there seemed to be nothing exceptional about the ingredients. So yes, while I like more adventurous foods, this was very very good and got great reviews from my neighbors, who I shared it with. I would caution: do not add extra salt. The salt from the proscuitto and the chicken broth is probably enough.

Rating: 4
Extremely tasty & fairly easy- the prep can take longer than you'd think, but it's still very simple. Mince the garlic, & do add pepper & a little salt. I made it last night (not the first time though, nor the last), & I forgot to add salt & pepper until it was on the plate so don't forget that, but definitely make this- It is so tasty.

I will definitely be making this a few times a month. I was really craving a creamy garlic pasta, and here it was! I also added asparagus, and I left out the prosciutto. I refrigerated it and brought it to lunch at work for a few days, and once it was all gone I was still craving it. Some odd things about this recipe: No salt and pepper, and it doesn't say what to do with the garlic cloves. Do you add them whole and then remove them before serving? I minced mine, but I wasn't sure.

I added some chicken, substituted cream with milk (a bit less fattening), and sprinkled parsley for flavor and garnish at the end and it turned out great!

Quick and easy for a weeknight dinner, although probably not every night. Added asparagus because I had some. A bit of chopped parsley at the end probably wouldn't have hurt either. I look forward to tossing in a few shrimp into the mix the next time as an earlier reviewer did.

This is delicious! I didn't have any chicken broth so I made it without it and used black pepper instead of red pepper. I also used more garlic. I thought there was plenty of sauce.

Rating: 4
A new favorite in our house! After making it the first time as written, I streamlined the prep time without sacrificing taste/quality: I saute the mushrooms first, until almost done, and then make the cream sauce with the mushrooms still in the skillet. Instead of defrosting the peas, I add them to the pasta when there's 5 minutes left. I've added plumped sundried tomatoes to the sauce with rich results, too.

Rating: 3
This is a nice recipe, although it took a bit more time in prep work than I thought. I made it a bit healthier by adding more mushrooms and peas to the 'sauce', using 1/2 cream and 1/2 skim milk for the cream. I upped the garlic a bit too. I will try this next time with pancetta instead and brown it first.

Rating: 4
What also works with this dish is bacon. Instead of prosciutto, saute 1/4 lb. of diced up bacon and drain. Get rid of all but a little of bacon fat, and then saute the mushrooms in the bacon fat. Add the drained bacon to the rest of the mixture as per the original instructions. I use this variation when I cannot get good quality prosciutto.

Removed the peas but cooked it otherwise just as the recipe calls. My husband rarely cooks and this was easy for him to make on his own. Turned out great. We're making it again for a dinner party later in the month.

Absolutely delicious. My husband and I both agreed it was decadent without feeling like you just ate a bucket of butter and cream. I minced the garlic (doesn't say to do this) and doubled the amount. Also took other's advice and doubled the sauce which was perfect. My husband liked it so much he actually asked me to make it again the next night - a first!

Excellent, but a tad more crushed red pepper for a bit of a kick and extra garlic as well...have to agree though that it wasn't that creamy even with cooking 20 minutes. However I added extra broth so that's probably why. Even though it was a excellent dish and more then willing to make it again and again and again.

I doubled the sauce as others recommended, but I think I did something wrong. The sauce never got thick and stayed really watery and ended up just being a mess. It might have tasted ok if it was a creamy sauce, but mine just didn't turn out that way.

This was super easy weeknight pasta dish. I used shitake mushrooms mixed with buttons and tried out a mushroom broth instead of chicken. YUM. Only negative thing I'd say is that if you love sauce - double it. I made the full sauce recipe with pasta and peas for two and there was barely enough sauce to our taste. Will definitely make this one again. I think adding rosemary would be great.

This was very good. Very easy to make. I used less pasta than called for and used zuccini instead of peas. I also broiled in lemon, olive oil and pepper, 3/4 lb. shrimp (medium size).

As others have commented, this recipe requires more sauce. I would make about 50% more next time. Go 50/50 whipping cream and Half & Half and add a splash of white wine! Also, I found it too hot so would cut down on the dried crushed red pepper.

This is truly wonderful and so easy to make. The only thing I do differently is sautee the mushrooms w/the butter and the prosciutto so they absorb the flavor of the prosciutto. This time we also sauteed some chicken cutlets and added them to the mix. YUM!

This is restaurant food--I never make stuff this rich. I used half-and-half and thought the sauce came out perfect. I also chopped the garlic; it doesn't say to, I'm wondering if people leave it whole. Other changes--spaghetti instead of penne, sundried tomatoes and no peas, since I realized at the last minute I didn't have any. Also added a fair amount of freshly ground black pepper. And didn't stir the cheese (shredded, not grated) in till the end, which probably kept it from getting stringy. I'll use this sauce as a base next time I decide to make creamy fatty food.

Where did the sauce go? I made this dish according to the recipe, and the sauce pretty much disappeared when I mixed it with the pasta. The flavor was good, but next time I would figure out how to make it creamier.

I have made this dish several times now, and every time has been delicious! After adding the parmesan, I do find my sauce to be a bit stringy (I may be missing out on a technique here!), but that does little to detract from the full flavor of the garlic cream sauce. As usual, I tend to add about 3 times as many garlic cloves as called for in the recipe, and I actually only used about half the peas (otherwise they become a bit overwhelming to me).

Great flavour. Mixing in the parmesan cheese took longer than I'd hoped-- it took a bit of time to get a creamy sauce. But the end result was very yummy. Instead of pepper flakes, I used ground chipotle, which lended a nice, smoky flavour to the dish, and a bit more heat. I served it as a side to grilled chicken and with a baby spinach salad; with 1999 Marques de Borba... it was fantastic.

I had to substitute chicken bouillion for the broth, since I discovered, in the middle of cooking, that my broth had gone bad; I also omitted the red pepper (personal taste preference). I used prosciutto instead of bacon, and was looking forward to this meal. The parmesan cheese was incredibly overpowering and did not make much of a sauce once it was mixed with the pasta, prosciutto, and peas. I was terribly disappointed and could not finish it due to the parmesan. The essence of the recipe is good - maybe I needed to use a different kind of cheese, because that much parmesan ruined the whole experience.

Superb and very versatile. Everyone we make for loves it. Ideal for substitutions, i.e. have usesd pancetta and even italian or chorizo sausage in lieu of prosciutto. Found you can use less cream or bit of skim milk plus touch of cream.

The key is to follow it like it says but add sun dried tomatoes and top with a sauteed chicken breast that is sliced for presentation and top off with fresh grated parmesan. yum yum -on it's own very good but it is better topped with a 4 ox breast

I used bacon (because I am cheap) and 1 cup of that fat-free half and half because I wanted less fat. You need to let it cook down a little longer to get the right thickness, and I probably lost some flavor, but I was satisfied with the results. A good dish, and I've deluded myself into thinking it is somewhat healthy.

This was my first time using prosciutto in a recipe, the flavor was great and I'd definitely make it again. I increased all the ingredients for the sauce by 1/2, increased the rest by 1/3, and decreased the peas by half. White, creamy sauce was a nice alternative to red sauce.

I added about a pound of bacon to the recipe instead of prosciutto, gave it nice flavor. I also had to 3x the quanties and I was wondering if doing so made the consistancy different. I would have prefered it to be a little thicker. Do you think it could have used a little light roux. All and all it was good.

It's a great dish if you like the proscuitto and peas combination found in other Italian recipes. Its a refreshing twist with the addition of the hot peppers and the slow cooking of the garlic. I substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the whip cream at an attempt to slightly lighten it and used the assortment of mushrooms I had in the frig.
