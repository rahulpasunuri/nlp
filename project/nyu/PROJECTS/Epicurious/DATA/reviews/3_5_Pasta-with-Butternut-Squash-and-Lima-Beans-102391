This recipe was easy to do while chatting with dinner guests. If you buy the precut squash, it's even easier. I used Better Than Bullion veggie base for the broth, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious -- a real Northern Italian-inspired treat. Hearty enough to pair with a light to medium bodied red wine.

I make a variation of this with cinnamon and coconut milk in place of the thyme and 1/2 the broth, its creamier and adding green curry paste makes it really special

I used soy beans and whole wheat pasta like many other people. Didn't have red pepper flakes, so I used Siracha instead. Added more thyme, another clove of garlic, and twice the parmesan. I agree with some others, this recipe wasn't all that impressive. Just okay. It would have been more along the lines of bland if I hadn't used the Siracha sauce.

I've made this several times now, and I like it best with about twice the crushed red pepper flakes, whole wheat penne, and fresh butter beans from the farmer's market rather than lima beans. Easy and delish.

This was not very flavorful nor was it tasty. It needed something else...

Made just as listed although I replaced the lima beans with soy beans (I highly recommend that). It was quite tasty. I used whole wheat penne pasta and that paired very well with the butternut squash. Next time I think I'll add a little more crushed red pepper but that's because I love spice.

Yummy and delicious - perfect for a cold, snowy winter night- I added a dash of cayenne papper, Pepperman (Frontier foods) and a crushed cherry pepper from last years garden. I did not cover the veggies and let the broth simmer down some - we all loved it. I would never have found it if I hadn't been issued a challenge by my daughter to use what she had while I babysit this week.

Followed recipe exactly using fresh thyme and family thought it a pleasant dish, but will not be asking for it again soon. Two cups of broth yielded a very liquidy vegetable mixture - can't imagine adding more pasta water. I think it might have been better if the vegetables had not been covered while cooking. The broth would have concentrated more and perhaps the squash would not have been so mushy.

So good. Easy and delicious. I made the scalloped butternut squash recipe a few days ago using the necks. Then I used the remaining bases to make the pasta. It was delicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes-- quick, easy and delicious. Have made this several times with several variations (sweet potato in place of butternut squash, peas instead of lima beans, less garlic, more crushed red pepper, etc.) and it comes out excellent every time.

'Tis the season for butternut squash, and I can only have so much squash soup. This recipe is a GREAT quick and easy weeknight meal. It took maybe 35 minutes start to finish (I used a Cuisinart to slice the squash.) Add a salad and bam, dinner. I did not include the lima beans - not many people are fans - but I would recommend adding some frozen peas during the last few minutes of cooking, which is what I'll do next time I cook this. Definitely include the hot pepper flakes to give it more body (not really spicey-hot at the end), and I also added a little white wine to deepen the flavor. It's not a fancy meal, but very satisfying for dinner - and for leftovers the next day.

I used canellini beans and it came out great.

after reading other reviews, I have something else to say. Take it or leave it: don't be afraid of the red pepper flakes , it adds a nice dimension. The parmesan cheese works well with the squash. You are toning down the flavors if you skip this. don't be afraid of a little cheese.

this is satisfying and yummy. I've made it three times and a friend asked for the recipe a week after I served it to her. I made it with soy beans because that's what I had. This would also be good as a side vegetable dish without pasta. I like to use the 'little ears' (don't know to spell it) pasta. This is a Keeper

I made many changes in this as I used what was at hand. I used green onion, added some leftover collard greens, used mixed frozen veggies, and omitted the red pepper. It was delicious, very fresh and healthy tasting. I'll definitely make it again.

I thought this sounded odd but it was delicious and easy to prepare. I used acorn squash and peas. Am looking forward to having it regularly!

This turned out far better than I expected. The butternut squash pretty much turned creamy, it was so soft, and I just really loved all of the flavors together. We subbed peas for the lima beans as someone else had done, and we skipped the red pepper and the cheese. I would probably add the cheese next time, as it would only make it better! This is definitely going in the regular rotation.

It was excellent. Easy and quick to make and everyone liked it. I used the peas as suggested by prior reviewer.

This pasta dish was a disappointment. Made it for a dinner party last evening and no ones really liked it, there was lots of left overs. Even after adding lots of extra flavoring, it was still bland. One guest suggested using pumpkin instead of the squash. However,I don't think it would change the recipe enough to try making it again.

made this with orecchiette pasta and pumpkin instead of butternut squash. very good, simple. another time i roasted the squash in the oven with fresh rosemary. . the lima beans give it a creamy texture. so easy, i'm sure i'll make it again soon.

As the forks say: Two forks: Like it, don't love it. It seems like the general opinion of the recipe is high, so don't go by me, I just didn't love this recipe, the leftovers are still in the fridge from a week ago.

I made this for dinner last night just because I needed a recipe to use some fresh lima beans I found at the farmer's market. My husband and I loved it. I didn't have vegetable broth so I used low sodium chicken broth instead and tossed in an extra clove of garlic. I also let it simmer for 15 minutes or more so that the squash was very soft, more like a puree. yum.

This is a great recipe! My mother-in-law made this for us when we were visiting. She was out of Lima Beans so she used Soybeans. I have made it several times since and couldn't imagine using anything but soybeans.

We make this one at least once a week. The pasta we use makes this dish complete. A black pepper pasta adds kick and is a perfect complementary taste. This dish sounds funny, but it is excellent!

I have made this recipe twice so far - once for my mother and grandmother who loved it and once for my boyfriend. When I think about the texture and taste my mouth waters and I will be making it again!

This is a good fall receipe for vegetarian/pasta lovers. It tastes better than it sounds. Try it.

They really need a "maybe" response under the question "Would you make this dish again?" This is one of those dishes that is good but not great, but you would make it again if you had all the ingredients on hand and didn't know what else to do with them. It's a tasty surprise, but not so much a surprise that I would seek out the recipe to do it again. I think it makes for a good lunch (I am bringing it to lunch all this week) or light supper. Otherwise, save the butternut for a good soup recipe.
