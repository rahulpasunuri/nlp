Excellent recipe. The only trouble I had was that the crust didn't adhere to the scallops very well. I should have dried them better.

this recipe was very disappointing. The scalllops had very little flavor. I would not make this recipe again, without major modifications to the coating.

This is an absolutely wonderful salad. Solved the blandness of the scallops by eliminating the egg dip and lightly flouring with seasoned Wondra (or could use rice flour. Seasoning was salt,white pepper, and just a touch of Spicy Seafood Seasoning, (could use paprika or Cajun blackening spice). Used heavy stainless pan, elimated sesame oil because of its low flash point, and sauted hot til golden, one minute per side.

I always read the reviews prior to making anything. However, this time I was quite disapointed with the results. The vinaigrette was just ok. The flour-sesame seed-egg crust around the scallpos did not add any taste. It was quite bland in our opinion. We will not make this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for, except I used frozen scallops from Trader's Joes. They were wonderful!!!! The ginger vinagerette is great and I can imagine using it on other dishes. Loved this dish and would definately make it again.

Scallops were a bit challenging to cook for me - but the dressing was just fabulous. Pretty presentation.

The salad dressing in this recipe is fabulous. The scalops were a little difficult and work intensive and I didn't enjoy them as much as I usually do.

This is a fabulous salad which I have made over and over again for entertaining. I do not change a thing. It is always a hit! It is great as a main course for lunch.

This is a wonderful and inovative approach to scallopes. The sesame seeds add a great textural and taste component. I did add salt to the flour coating and used only enough ginger dressing to lightly dress the salad. I like the idea of putting the scallopes in a puddle of the ginger dressing. I will definitely make this again and again.

It was awesome. Great salad as an entree with a few more scallops per plate. A good wine, a great bread and voila!

Delicious salad, and yes the dressing was very good...I added salt to the flour mixture for the scallops, and they turned out quite well, although the flour crust didn't stick very well to the scallops. Everyone enjoyed this dish..

This salad is beyond compare! I am a diabetic, so I substituted one half packet of Sweet n Low for the honey in the Ginger Vinaigrette, and it was still great.

Absolutely LOVED this salad. Makes a great light main course for easy weekday dining. Will definitely make again soon!

The ginger dressing is what makes this dish. The scallops alone really don't have much flavor, but if you serve them in a puddle of the ginger dressing, they're delicious! The ginger dressing tastes just like that of a japanese steakhouse so if you like it there you'll love it at home!

I made this for a dinner party on Saturday evening for a group of girlfriends and everyone raved about this dish, especially the ginger vinaigrette. I have made the vingaigrette on numerous other occasions for a mesclun salad with some chopped green onions, sweet red pepper and cucumbers. Definitely my favorite vinaigrette to date. I also added a sprinkle of salt to the scallops as they were finishing cooking and really enjoyed this appetizer. I used Digby scallops from Nova Scotia and they were moist and succelent and I will definitely make this dish again.

This was a great salad. The dressing was delicious. I had alot of flour/sesame mixture left over. I would cut back on that but beyond that suggestion everything was perfect!! Very nice flavor!

Very good. Agree, the scallops were a little bland. Will add some salt next time.

I've made this twice for dinner parties and my guests seemed to really enjoy it both times. However, the first time I made it I found the scallop coating a little bland, so I added a pinch of salt to the seasame seed/flour mixture the second time around, and found it made a world of difference.

Easy to prepare. The sauce really wakes up your taste buds and enhances the scallops. We really enjoyed this meal.

A simply lovely dish! The recipe called for too much oil in which to saute the scallops. I coated them as directed and browned them in a hot pan using only 1 1/2 teaspoons of oil. They were perfectly golden and crispy outside without a pool of grease leaking onto the salad. The dressing is divine and great with other seafood or chicken recipes. Truly a keeper!!!

This dish would have been fantastic with a grilled seaffod instead of fried. Grilled is more healthy and more in line w/ the "Thai" essence of this dish. The vinagrette was great

Very good recipe. I also added some sliced portobella mushrooms that were marinated in a sherry-soy mixture (from recipe Marinated Stuffed Mushrooms). Will definedly make it again.

This recipe is simply delicious. The steps are easy to follow and the dish itself is fantstic! A "must try" recipe.

Sesame makes a tasty addition to the sauted scallops. I served them separately from the salad. Reminiscent of Japanese steak house ginger dressings, this one has a touch more soy sauce. Excellent!
