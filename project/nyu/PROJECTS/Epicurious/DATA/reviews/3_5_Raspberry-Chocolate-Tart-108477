I made this for a garden party. It was so easy to make and especially ahead of time. The only modifications I would make next time is to cook the crust a bit longer and I wouldn't use the glaze as I found that it made the bottom a bit soggy (maybe I just used too much?). In any event it was great and I will make it again when organic rasberries are in season.

Made this for a ladies evening event to rave reviews. Followed the recipe exactly. Next time I'll add only about half the raspberry to puree to the mascarpone mixture, as it was perfect right out the fridge, but quickly became too soft. It would also help to cut the sweetness. I put all the filling ingredients in my kitchen aid with the whisk attachment and it turned out perfectly whipped. Delicious and easy!!

I made this recipe for an event to feed 100 people. The test run came out bad. I figured out you have to cream the mascarpone (actually, I used cream cheese) and sugar first, then add the other ingredients. I also skipped the water. For the crust I used oreo crumbs, and it didn't hold together great. I also used strawberry slices instead of raspberries. In the end the recipe was a great success. Everyone loved it! Even though I made a few changes, this is a great recipe.

Made this for a wedding shower about 3 yrs ago for 1st time with rave reviews. Loved it as it's fairly easy and a true make- ahead dessert (something that can be done the day before gets an A+). HOWEVER, made this yesterday for my twins 1st birthday (adult desesrt) and the filling was a COMPLETE disaster! I have NEVER had a recipe go so far South on me for no explicable reason what-so-ever. Have now read other reviews and will try their suggestions of chilling the bowl. NOT a comforting feeling that I need dumb luck for the filling to come together. I agree with another reviewer who faulted the test kitchen. Hopefully third time will be the charm.

Delicious! My guests said it was the most unique and delicious dessert they ever had. You can buy the chocolate wafers at Bristol Farms or gourmet grocer. I couldn't find seedless preserves anywhere so I used with seeds and it was a gloppy mess. Any advice?

This tart was excellent. Followed the recipe exactly as written and had perfect results. I do have a food mill which makes straining the raspberry puree a breeze. It looked like something out of a magazine.

This was delicious! I did not have time to run to the store for mascarpone, so I had to use cream cheese, and it was still amazing. Oh, and I did not have any seedless preserves on hand, so I just skipped that step. I will definitely make this again!

New Year's Eve 2006 Progressive Dinner. Made it in 11" tart pan to keep the serving sizes a bit smaller and it worked great. No problems with whipping mascarpone and cream - just chilled bowl and beaters a few minutes before starting. Instead of the preserve glaze I drizzled some melted dark chocolate on top for a great look. Filling recipe just needs to indicate that the 1/2 cup sugar is divided between the raspberry portion and the whipped portion.

This was delicious and so easy! I didn't have time to refrigerator overnight, so just put it in the freezer for 1 hour and then the refrigerator for 4 hours and it was wonderful! My guests asked for seconds! Great the next day too!

Made this for a large family gathering and it was a huge hit. It is not too sweet, and surprisingly light. Couldn't find seedless raspberry preserves, so I substituted a simple sugar syrup and it turned out beautifully. This one is a keeper!

I was surprisingly impressed by this tart, as were most who ate it. It was so light, which is not expected. I could not find chocolate wafers (whatever happened to the good ol' Nabisco wafer?) so I used reduced-fat oreos and cut down on butter and sugar. I did have problems getting the filling to be smooth, and didn't want to overmix, so left it a bit lumpy. Once the raspberries were on, you couldn't see the lumps. The biggest problem I had was with the glaze - brushing it kept moving the raspberries so I ended up dabbing some on each of the berries, which seems silly. The presentation is amazing - people thought it was made by a professional, which I'm not. Very easy to make, delicious, great for nice events. And thanks to a previous reviewer for pointing out the one half-pint issue (and to my husband for pointing out that half-pint is equal to one cup).

Easy and delicious! I used chocolate graham crackers in the crust. Frozed thawed and drained raspberries for the fillin-skipped the water and lemon juice. This filling would also be a great parfait or dessert by itself.

Wonderful recipe, very simple with excellent results. This one's definitely a keeper!

This dish has come out great each time I've made it. Keys to making it turn out well, as others have said, are to use the correct amount of raspberries, to keep cream and mascarpone very cold until whipping (I chill the bowl and beaters as well as ingredients), and to fold gently. I have had trouble finding the chocolate cookie wafers and have substituted a graham-cracker crust and just call it a raspberry tart; still is a crowd-pleaser and no one seems to miss the chocolate.

I love this tart. I have made it a number of times with this adjustment: I make the shell and filling exactly as written, but use half blueberries and half raspberries on the top. The first time I made this, it was for Independence Day, and I made a blueberry star on top surrounded by raspberries. I love the blueberries as topping since they are slightly sweeter than raspberries. Either way it is really delicious.

I made this for an anniversary party, as my sister in law is a raspberry fan. It was wonderful! I shy away from anything using mascarpone, as it is expensive, but it was totally worth it. I did use frozen raspberries for the puree, and skipped the glaze. In addition to this I served the fallen choclate souffle cake from this site, and the raspberry tart was preferred!

Ohhhh, you mean one half-pint container raspberries, not a one-and-a-half-pint containter raspberries! Please, no one make this same mistake -- my tart came out shockingly pink, a little runny and leaky, which was a shame because I had stiff peaks going and everything. Maybe this accounts for some of those other leaky reviews, too? Still, very yummy. Can't wait to try the recipe properly.

I made this recipe twice - the first time it was easy and beautiful. Apparently I was a little too confident and careless the second time, because I had problems with curdling and separation like some of the other reviewers. I had taken the cream and mascarpone out of the fridge while I was finishing the puree, and I think they weren't cold enough. My advice - leave the cream and mascarpone in the fridge until the moment you're ready to use them. Even with the separation problem this dessert was edible and pleasant, but it's divine when prepared properly.

To the previous reviewer: I buy the cookies either in the baking aisle or the cookie aisle-- they are called Nabisco Famous Chocolate wafers, and they look like giant oreo cookies, minus the middle. They come stacked, about 30 or so cookies in a clear package. But if you still can't find them, I have also used straight oreo cookies; don't even bother to scrape the filling off. Hope this helps.

Can anyone tell me where to get chocolate wafers? I have seen only the creme layered type in the stores and I have been searching off and on again for years.

The cheese and whipping cream curdled on me the my first try and I have a Kitchen Aid mixer. The trick is the cheese and whipping cream need to be cold- straight from the fridge cold. Second time around it worked perfect and it was a huge hit. Not only is a really delicious but it is also lovely. I got a lot of Martha compliments on this one.

My food-savvy guests tonight declared this one of the best desserts they'd ever had, and I have to agree. It's beautiful and completely delicious! I used two and a half packages of berries for the topping, so it was densely covered, and didn't skimp on the glaze. The filling is excellent. I used my heavy-duty Kitchen Aid mixer to whip it up, and folded in the puree with the paddle afterwards to get everything very smooth. Did not have any problems with separation as some other reviewers did. I highly recommend this one.

Whoa! This one's a keeper. I substituted strawberries with wonderful results. Regarding the marscapone - it whips up beautifully, but I used a Kitchenaid - formed stiff peaks, fabulous. The folding in of the puree is the trick - it's a gentle fold, the less strokes the better - use a large spatula and a gentle touch. This was a huge hit, and a sweet ending to a wonderful Valentine's dinner with my honey. And, yes, I'd increase to 2 Cups for chocolate crumbs, too

Easy and absolutely delicious. I made it for a party, and it was the biggest hit of all the food. It looks heavy, but the mascarpone cheese is actually light and makes the whole thing refreshing and mildly sweet. Next time I will crush two cups worth of cookie crumbs, but otherwise the recipe worked great for me with no problems.

I would make it again, but I need big help. As a matter of fact, I have to make it again as my guest that evening has requested it for her birthday. I had the same problem with the filling. The mascarpone NEVER whipped. Just separated when I added the cream and I used 5 different kitchen gadgets, including my hands before getting it to even come together - like butter and milk curdles. Forget it when I added the raspberry puree. Is it possible that the freshness of the mascarpone is the issue or the cream wasn't cold enough? Or do you whip the cream, then fold in the cheese? I finally froze it. Looked beautiful, but thankfully it didn't melt before they ate it. I'm a pretty accomplished cook, but this one threw me.

We made this for a friends wedding, and found that it was easy, beautiful and delicious. I am planning to make it again fir a friends birthday, if I can find the three 1/2 pint containers of Raspberries I wil need.

Oh my gosh this is a disaster ready to be made! Who tested this recipe? The picture doesn't even look like the ingredients! Let's be more precise than 2 1/2 pint container... how much is that really? (weight? measurement?) The only thing I could do was stick it int he freezer for a "frozen" dessert. What a disappointment.

This was almost a total disaster. The mascarpone mixture immediately turned to butter and I had to go get regular Philadelphia cream cheese and repeat the whole process. The amount of puree was too much and it made the filling too pink and watery and I had to quickly add a gelatin mixture. My guests thought it looked good and tasted good but I don't think it was up to the usual standards of the recipes I've gotten from your magazine and there have been a great many.

I really liked this tart...very fresh tasting with the raspberries. My husband would actually give this one a 4! I didn't have a problem with soggy crust I thought it held up great. I wouldn't omit the raspberry topping I really liked it. It got a lot of oooh's and awww's from our guest...it does look beautiful and they loved it as well.

Great recipe. Beautiful presentation and very easy to make. I agree with other reviewer--omit water. I kept it in and as soon as I took it out of fridge it started "leaking". A great dessert for guests as it looks most impressive. I also think you could omit the raspberry preserve on top.

Easy to make, tasty, and looks impressive. The filling made the crust a little soggy, though, so next time I'll omit the water.
