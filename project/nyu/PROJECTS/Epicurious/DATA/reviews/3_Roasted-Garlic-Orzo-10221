This was a great side dish for Chicken Scarpariella. The poppy seeds gave it a nice appearance and texture. It was easy to make, which was important because I am 13 years old, and prepared this as part of my Mom's Mother's Day dinner. There were five guests who liked the dish, Only my Mom commented favorably about it, but no one commented negatively, and everyone ate it with gusto.

Yum-yum-yummy! I doubled the recipe amounts but used a whole head of roasted garlic and flat Italian parsley. Also mixed in 1/4 cup of warmed herbed chicken broth rather than the pasta water. The toasted poppy seeds were a wonderful addition - loved their crunch and nutty taste. Very flavourful and creamy - not dry or bland in the least! One of the best orzo recipes I have made - truly pleasing to the eye and the palate. Another winner that I am sure to make again and again.

Because I love garlic I didn't think this recipe would give me the flavor I was looking for. Instead of following it exactly I used it as a guideline. My own recipe uses 2 whole heads of roasted garlic to one pound(box) of orzo. I add almost an entire stick of butter, extra poppy seeds, lots of parsley and salt and pepper. I always get really rave reviews from everyone. Making this according to the recipe would give you a dry and pretty bland dish.

For a tasty addition, add corn and tomatoes to this dish. The garlic flavor is accented perfectly!

I agree with the first reviewer. This dish is ok but fairly bland.

Good sidedish, but needs something...like some "zip", or an "edge". Okay, but nothing special.
