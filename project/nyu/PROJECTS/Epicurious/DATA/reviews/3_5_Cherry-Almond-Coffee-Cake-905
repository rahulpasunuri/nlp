I made this for a coffee I had this summer, and all the women really enjoyed it. I used Trader Joe's jarred Morello cherries as another reviewer suggested; cannot imagine making it with canned cherry pie filling although in 1995, when the recipe first appeared, there probably weren't as many options for cherries.

Excellent recipe, light and delicious. I used fat-free greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I don't like almond extract so used all vanilla. I used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 all purpose (which I almost always do in baked goods). I made my own apple filling by cooking medium-diced fuji apples, brown sugar and cinnamon and thickening with a bit of corn starch. I topped the cake with sliced almonds mixed with one egg white and some sugar. Excellent

A nice, simple cake with good flavor and nice moist texture. Like others, I added more almond extract (1 full teaspoon), and also added some lemon zest to the batter. I find canned cherry pie filling to be lacking in flavor and presence of actual fruit, so I heated my can of filling and strained out the 'goop' - leaving just the cherries. To this I added a dash of almond extract and some lemon zest and THEN I had some nice cherries to layer in the cake. I toasted the sliced almonds for the topping, and dusted the finished cake with powdered sugar. I'll make again.

I really enjoyed this coffee cake. I ended up using real cherries instead of pie filling and just cooking my own sauce to use. Everyone really liked flavor of the cake and I'd like to try this with all sorts of different fruits.

This is a favorite, go-to recipe and always a hit. I add 1 tsp almond extract and more cherries, but drained . I've even frozen it--it doesn't look quite as good, but still tastes great.

I also used canned cherries and thickened the juice with arrowroot and added 1/4 cup sugar. Bumped the almond ext to 1 teasp and made a crumble topping of almond meal, brown sugar, butter and cinnamon. Added the sliced almonds on top. Excellent, moist cake. Made the cake using gluten free flour and it was very moist and yummy.

Had to make due with fresh cherries (warmed with kirsch, thickened the liquids with arrowroot), very tastey. 1/2 tsp of Penzey's almond extract was plenty.

This was NOT noteworthy. Moist, yes. Decent flavour. Easy to make. But no depth and no body. I made mine for the holidays, hoping to capture some of the qualities of my mother's cherry cake recipe. This kinda fell short of the mark. That being said, I will try it again using some of the suggestions listed here, i.e. canned cherries and more almond extract.

This was really quick and easy to make. The longest part was pitting the cherries and baking it. I used fresh bing and ranier cherries and did nothing else to them. I substituted 2% greek yogurt for the sour cream b/c i had some and took the advice here to boost the almost extract to 1tsp. it was delicious and still moist even though i overcooked it. the cherries did sink to the bottom -- i suppose next time i would lightly coat them in flour to prevent that from happening...or just sprinkle them on top like another reviewer...but whole cherries hidden inside the cake are a nice surprise. Would definitely make again.

I made this with Trader Joe's jarred Morello cherries instead of the pie filling. As per other reviews, I also used 1 tsp. of almond extract instead of 1/2 tsp. It was easy, moist, fabulous! Everyone loved it. I also sprinkled the top with coarse granulated sugar. It looked pretty with the almonds. I will definitely be making this over and over again.

I am not a fan of canned cherry pie filling...no flavor, too gloopy, too artificial. Made this coffee cake with those lovely jarred Morello Cherries from Trade Joe's. They are slightly tart, and come in a thin cherry juice...so added a bit of corn starch and a tsp of sugar and heated in sauce pan to thicken slightly. I also passed on sandwiching the cherries between two layers of batter....just put all the batter in the pan and dotted the top with the cherries and juice, topped with the almonds. Turned out great. Very pretty...finished with some powdered sugar after it came out of the oven and cooled. Strongly recommend the Morello Cherries. They actually taste and look like cherries. I used about half the jar. Plan to use the rest to make a clafouti ..yum.

I love this recipe. It is easy to make and tastes great. I get frequent requests for this coffee cake from coworkers and friends.

I have made this many times, and everyone loves it and wants the recipe. I use 2 teaspoons of almond extract and the whole can of cherry pie filling, but I only use the cherries from the pie filling. They do not sink to the bottom. This is a permanent recipe in our house.

Wonderful...Used a little more cherries

I made this cake using blackberries (from a jar but not the pie filling kind) instead of the cherry pie filling, and with 1 teaspoon almond extract, and it was great. I definitely would not use less than 1 t almond extract. Next time I might try some liqueur in it. I made it in a regular pan instead of springform and it popped out just fine. Delicious and much bigger than I expected!

I was not at all impressed by this cake. It was bland and a little bit egg-y tasting. The cherry pie filling didn't help perk it up a whole lot, in my opinion. Not worth the time it took to make it...

I thought this was a great recipe. I took it to an office pot-luck and it went over really well. I didn't have the almond extract and used vanilla - I would not suggest that again. It did seem it was lacking with only vanilla. I plan on making it again w/the almond. Very pretty cake!

I didn't want to assign a number of forks b/c I didn't make this cake exactly as specified. I substituted 1 cup of nonfat vanilla Stonyfield Farms yogurt for the sour cream, increased the almond extract to 1 tsp, omitted almonds and added a crunchy brown sugar/cinnamon/butter/flour topping. Also, for the people who felt there was too much filling, I rinsed some of the coating off of the cherries. I think this improved my cake. It was DELICIOUS! And a pretty presentation. I am sure it would be very tasty the way the recipe is stated(though I would still increase almond extract due to other reviews)but it is definitely adaptable!

This cake is being gobbled down fast! Everybody who takes a slice has to have "just another little sliver" afterwards. This is my advice to anybody considering this recipe--taste the cherry filling before you start baking. The cake batter is good but mild, so the cherry filling ends up making or breaking the finished product. If you don't love the cherry stuff as is, try jazzing it up (we always add about 1/4-1/2 cup more sugar to each whole can, believe it or not, and it makes a big difference, or try adding almond extract or spices if you think that would be good). And if you still don't like the filling, then you aren't going to like the cake. The little changes I made were to omit the almond extract and increase the vanilla to 2 tsp, use around 2/3-3/4 of the can of cherries, and sub fat free yogurt for most of the sour cream. A few of my cherries sunk, but most stayed right where I left them.

I love coffee cake and this one is fine. It's pretty and my friends loved it but, I didn't think it was terrific. The cherries are a bit bland and I overloaded it with pie filling.

I LOVE this recipe -- I have made this coffee cake at least a dozen times, and give out the recipe each time. It is so yummy and moist. A tip: don't put too much pie filling close to the edge, or it will ooze out the sizes of the cake, once removed from the springform.

I love this! I replaced the almonds and extract with cinnamon in the batter and a cinnamon-sugar topping. I'm definitely making this again.

This cake is just so-so. The texture is nice, and it is fun to make, but the results were nothing to write home about. A crumbly cinnamon-sugar topping and real cherries would improve this greatly.

An excellent coffee cake! I read some of the previous reviews and found that my cherries did not sink to the bottom, but rested nicely on top. I would cut back on the almonds. Half as many would do. I did increase the almond extract to 1 teaspoon. Will definitly make again. Yum!

I am not a fan of cherry pie filling so I used Oregon Brand canned cherries. I strained off the juice first. I also substituted walnuts for almonds. I took the cake to a breakfast meeting and it was eaten very quickly. I received many compliments and would make it again.

Hi! I've made this many times - it's the basic coffee cake recipe - mix and match the fillings...everything works! Try lemon curd for the cherry filling...it's a real treat!

This is my favorite coffee cake. I've made it many times and people love it. I've also substituted peaches and pecans for the cherries and almonds.

A great, incredibly moist coffee cake that turns out beautifully. I used frozen (then thawed) cherries in the batter instead of pie filling, and it came out really well. The basic batter leaves a lot of room for imagination- a lot of combinations of nuts and fruit could be used.

Took this in to work and it was a HIT with every one. All the gals what the recipe, even my husband who is not a coffee cake type of guy LOVED IT. I will make this again and again.

I have made this coffee cake twice. My married daughter just said, it sure would be nice to have some more of that cherry coffee cake again. Everyone here loves it!!!

Although the cake was moist, the flavor was nothing special. I'd anticipated this from another review and added cardamom to the pie filling...but it didn't add much. This is fast and easy to make but I'd prefer something that took longer and was really special.

Using a previous review complaining of not enough cherry flavor, I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract to 1 full can of cherry filling. After having the cherries sink to the bottom, I spread the filling over the bottom of a greased pan and poured the batter over it in the fashion of an upside down cake. It looked and tasted better.

The cake was very good, moist, and the almond topping was very crunchy but the cherry filling was flavorless. We thought using a different fruit or a homemade pie filling would be better than the canned we used.
