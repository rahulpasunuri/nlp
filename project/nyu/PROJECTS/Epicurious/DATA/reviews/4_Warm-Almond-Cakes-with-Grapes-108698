I was craving something sweet and this cake came up during a search. I'm so glad I found it! I didn't have almonds, so I ground up walnuts and hazelnut filberts instead. I also used a mixture of Madeira and Calvados instead of the Cognac. They turned out really well! I baked them for 24 minutes in a convection oven in 5 6-ounce ramekins. Definitely a go-to recipe for a quick, delicious dessert. This would be great for company too, not your typical cake or pie!

Very tasty and easy to make. I substituted 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract for the 3/4 tsp of vanilla, and used Coronation grapes (season Aug - mid Sept) and got rave reviews.

Fantastic!!! I made it with some leftover apples that I had roasted the night before as a light dessert. Completely fresh ones might be kind of crunchy after 20 minutes but my semi roasted ones turned out great. If I had almond extract I would have thrown it in just because I love the flavor of almond but I didn't. It still turned out delicious. I also used already ground almonds that I found at the store which eliminated a step. I will definitely make again. It's sitting in the kitchen right now still warm... so hard not to go back for seconds. Yum! Very easy.

Delicious, easy and versatile. I did it with a few variations - used almond flour instead of grinding the almonds myself, used only 5 instead of 8 tablespoons of sugar, and used port instead of cognac.

So delicious, and so lovely, and quite easy; I loved it topped with a little creme fraiche; I'm sure whipped cream would also be nice.

Excellent recipe. I had to make some changes based on ingredients I had on hand, as follows: used blanched sliced almonds (weighed them), peaches instead of grapes, baked in a small tart pan instead of ramekins (25 mins was perfect). Since I baked it in a tart pan, I was able to get 8 modest servings - perfect for a small dessert after a pasta-heavy dinner. It is a very versatile recipe that I plan to try with apples in the fall, pears in the winter, and berries in the summer. Delicious!

This is a very quick and satisfying dessert. I've made it 3 times and liked it best with plums. It also tastes significantly better if you use top quality almonds and blanch them yourself (a fairly quick process) or else add some almond extract for that almondy taste.

I've made this three times in the last month. It's fabulous. I think I will also experiment with different fruits. Definatly make sure however that your cake is lightly brown all over not just on the sides or you will have a gooey mess.

This was very easy and delicious. I didn't use the cognac and I don't think that I will the next time I make this. The cakes were like warm cookies and were very pretty with the big black grapes that I used. If you're looking for an easy dessert that everyone will love, this is it.
