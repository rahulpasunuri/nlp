I made it as directed (but less olive oil) and found it very blah. Leek, celery and carrot simmered in water with white beans tastes like...well...you can picture it. I add vegetarian Italian sausage and vegetable broth concentrate along with salt and pepper. It was okay. I served it with garlic bread which made it more of a meal.

I have made this recipe countless times, as it is a wonderful melange of winter flavors. It can even stand up to being fully pureed (a necessity discovered after oral surgery) and is plenty filling to serve alone. Even non-vegetarians find it satisfying and do not miss the meat. The combination of herbs marry the flavors and guarantee my return to this recipe again & again.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago on a cold winters' night when my husband and I were looking for something healthy, yet not lacking in the taste department. I changed up the recipe in the following ways: Instead of leeks, I used onions since that's what I had on hand; I omitted the celery since I didn't have any, and used dried herbs instead of fresh ones. Also, I used chicken broth instead of water to add more depth of flavor (I'm not a vegetarian). The recipe turned out great! I made the rest exactly as written and it turned out to be a keeper for us! The bread crumbs I made by chopping up week old bread loaves that I had leftover and toasting them in the oven.

Excellent but I had to make it "un-vegetarian" for my husband. I used chicken broth instead of water and when the cassoulet finished, I added sliced sautéed chicken breasts and a light dusting of grated parmesan cheese before adding the garlic crumbs. Loved it.

Rating: 3
The first time I made this it was good, but seemed a bit "thin" on flavor. The next time I added a tablespoon or two of dark miso paste and that gave it a 'meaty" flavor -- so much so that vegetarians that ate it couldn't believe that it was indeed meatless. It was a big hit.

Rating: 3
Excellent but I made a few modifications, one of which I picked up from a prior review. Instead of the quart of water, I used one can of Fire Roasted Tomatoes w/juice and 1 1/2 cups water. Just to make it interesting, I added some turkey sweet italian sausage (squeezed out of it's casing - about 4 of them) which I browned first and then cooked w/the veggies. Loved the crumbs. Worth the extra work.

Rating: 3
I'm giving this 3 forks for the first day, but 3.5 for the second, as it gets better with 24 hours in the fridge. The garlic bread crumbs just make this dish, so don't skip them. Use a really good oil, and don't be tempted to cut back on it. You really do need it both for texture and flavor.

Made some changes the 2nd time I made this. I cooked white beans in the crock pot with veggie broth. I added fire roasted tomatoes, doubled the spices. On the bread crumbs, I sliced then cubed a baguette and made as written, but added dried herbs, garlic powder and sea salt. Delicious and filling.

Rating: 3
This was a very good, hearty meal. I added some crumbled rosemary and about 1/3 c. oil packed sundried tomatoes, diced small, when I added the stock. To accomodate family members with a gluten-free diet, I served the cassoulet in big soup bowls topped with garlic mashed potatoes with a sprinkling of sharp cheddar on top. Melted the cheese under the broiler and voila, dinner was served.

Rating: 3
My husband loves this. I thought it was ok...spoiled by the meat version, I guess. I'd make it again, but might play with the spices or add mushrooms or something just for funsies. My daughter won't eat it because it has celery in it. No accounting for taste.

I did this last night for the first time. I wanted to start doing Meatless Mondays, and this looked to be a good starting recipe. Overall, it was a good dish. I did add some diced tomatoes after the leeks and carrots had softened some. I also used vegetable stock instead of water, and upped the herbs a bit. I served this with toasted baguette slices that I gave a good brush with a thyme, parsley, shallot compound butter, then topped each piece of toast with brie. When you took a bite, getting the crunch from the toast, the tang, from the cheese, and the heartiness from the cassoulet, it actually worked really well. Definitely something I'd do again. Its a good, hearty, "comfort food" kinda dish. Not mind blowing, but my 6 year old liked it, so its a hit by my family's standard.

This is a great, cheap recipe - the herbs make this dish, but word to the wise - watch your ground cloves amount - I misread it, and added 1 tspn instead of 1/8 tspn - it went from smelling delicious to smelling like Christmas potpourri.

This was fabulous. I added the fire-roasted tomatoes, but otherwise followed directions exactly. The salt is important, but I think the olive oil could be reduced in both the sauteeing process and in the bread crumbs, if you wish to reduce calories. Easy to prepare - I would serve this for company, and my husband just loved it.

Thought this was fabulous. I followed previous advice and added a can of Italian tomatoes and doubled the herbs. Also added 2 sprigs of rosemary which was a great addition to the flavour.

I thought this was a great base! I utilized items I already had to make it and omitted the things I didn't have so here is how it shook out: No leek or fresh parsley -- added fennel, one potato, shallots, 1/2 an onion. Used duck broth instead of water (which I realize doesn't make it veg. anymore but that was ok with me.) I thought the spices were right on -- and will make it again!

I can't highly rate a vegetarian recipe that needs significant modifications in order to achieve the same richness of flavor imparted by the traditional recipe. I was very happy with the results based on these vegetarian friendly modifications: * Substituted 2 cups homemade roasted vegetable broth plus 2 cups mushroom broth for water * Substituted diced sweet potato for carrots * Substituted 30 oz navy beans plus 15 oz red lentils * Added 1 pint sliced baby portabello mushrooms, think fresh morels would be amazing in early spring version of recipe * Doubled fresh herbs * Omitted garlic crumbs * Omitted cloves * Prepared in slow cooker on low for 8 hours With this preparation, the mushroom broth and additional mushrooms add a strong, earthy flavor that speaks to the deep flavors of a traditional cassoulet. Some sweet potato, navy beans, and lentils broke down during slow cooking to thicken the broth to a traditional consistency. Served with a dense whole grain baguette and an intense brie for balance. Banon would have been a great cheese with this meal.

So good and healthy. We added chopped spinach. It reheats really well. Served with a side of white rice.

This is seriously good. It's kind of hard to believe it can be so good considering the simplicity...I did take everyone here's suggestions of 1.) broth instead of water and 2.) one can of fire roasted tomatoes. I added them when I added the beans and broth. This is the first time I've ever made bread crumbs. They were delicious. I was nibbling on them while the soup simmered...

Very good. Used homemade vegetable broth with garlic and spices already combined. Used tuscan bean recipe on this site to use dried beans. The leeks and the celery really helped. Used roasted corn instead of carrots. Added salt.

I made a few changes, but nothing major. Used about 6 large bulbs of garlic, doubled the thyme and used organic low sodium vegetable broth in place of water. Then instead of making my own croutons, I used Garlic Cheese Croutons for Caesar Salad. Fantastic and has already been made again! Simple, low cholesterol, low cal, healthy and delicious...

Followed reviewers advice: added one can fire roasted tomatoes, and used vegetable broth, not water. It was creamy, delicious, and filling. Very easy and fast. The garlic breadcrumbs are delicious (though a little greasy, I might use less olive oil next time) and the garlic and fresh parsley added a nice touch to the stew. Would definitely make again, very happy with the result!

Delicious!. Made these changes: used dried beans instead of canned, added 1/4 c red lentils, used vegetable broth instead of water and used fresh thyme instead of cloves. I followed the cooking instructions. To serve, I put the mixture into a casserole dish and added a layer of sliced tomatoes on top of the beans and then the bread crumb mixture on top. I put the casserole in the oven for 40 mins until the topping was crsip and bubbly. Will be making this again.

I try to cook 1-2 vegetarian meals and week and I've added this to our vegetarian rotation. It was great on a cool autumn day and there was a lot left over for lunch. I took the advice of other posters and added a can of fire roasted tomatoes. There's no missing the meat in this dish.

I made this exactly as written. I didn't have enough of one of the vegetables so I added zucchini, just for the vegetable factor. It's delicious!

I'm vegetarian and found this to be a good, filling recipe. I agree with others that it's definitely not very flavorful without making a few changes. I added veggie broth. I'll make this again but next time will take a few suggestions from some of the others who make other changes.

Also my fussy six year old will eat it :) Today I didn't have leeks or celery, but I made it anyhow. I substituted the oil for some cream, soooo good! Also I added baby spinach, turned out fantastic, what a great meal to whip up fast after a long day at work!

This is the first recipe I tried after my husband quit eating meat-usually I would start it off with some bacon and then add chicken broth.

Since I found this recipe we have made it LOADS of times. I am sure that it is the leeks that give it its particular flavour. I cannot buy tinned beans where I live so I use fresh cannellini beans (they have a fabulous creamy texture) and boil them gently for about 15 minutes with chicken or veg stock and a clove of garlic, and we use this stock for the dish, which by the way we have to use a LOT more liquid than the recipe asks for and also we use a nonstick pan to toast the breadcrumbs with the parsley mixed in.Seems quicker than heating up the oven. Also we serve the breadcrumbs apart at the table because my family likes the max.crunch and it tends to get a but soggy underneath with sitting at the table while everyone serves themselves, so this works out better and I can freeze the leftover crumbs in a ziplock to use again.

Rating: 3
Simply delicious. If you're looking for something light, flavorful and easy to make this is it. I followed the recipe exactly (except for the parsley part, I accidentally baked it with the crumbs) and it turned out fantastic. Froze the leftovers. Will make again and again! Will try variations too. This was made for a cozy Christmas Eve dinner with my husband, who had his fair share of holiday eating (Thanksgiving feast, fondue feast, homemade cookies, decadent chocolates, too much wine, etc) and he truly wanted something vegetarian with no cream, butter or animal products. With an elegant and festive table setting, this dish is perfect to fill a request like that.

This was delicious! Of course, I have to admit that since it was a last minute idea and I had some but not all of the ingredients - I was improvising a bit. Only had one leek so I added a regular yellow onion chopped up. Had no cloves so I substituted ground nutmeg. As for the three cans of beans - I had 1 can of cannelini, one of red kidney, and 1 of chickpeas so that's what I used! The chickpeas I kept separate until part way into the cooking, then mashed them up before adding them, leaving the other beans whole. I made croutons instead of breadcrumbs as one other reviewer suggested and used vegetable stock instead of water as another reviewer suggested and the whole thing was pretty wonderful! My visiting vegetarian daughter loved it and so did I. I guess my modifications (plus the absence of any meat) made it not an exactly traditional cassoulet but it was the perfect thing for a cold winter night.

Since I don't eat meat, I cleary can't add pork or chicken broth to a "vegetarian" dish to try to make it taste better. So I followed the recipe closely but did substitute the water with vegetable broth and added some of the liquid from the canned beans; and guess it what? It turned out beautifully! Even my finicky carnivore husband like it. I'm actually rating this at 3.5 stars; the parsley in the breadcrumbs was a little too strong for my taste.

Rating: 3
I have a much higher opinion of this then other cooks. I agree it could use a little more, but don't rule out the breadcrumbs with garlic. Those add a lot of flavor. That being said, I also sub half the breadcrumbs for parm cheese and use crushed tomatoes in place of some of the water. Also be sure to salt and pepper. That makes all the difference.

Even though we used stock, added more seasoning, and used cheese, this recipe was still very bland. The cloves gave it a "perfumy" taste. Maybe we should have tried the bacon addition.

I followed others suggestions and started by browning some bacon in the bottom of the pan, rather than oil, followed the remainder of the recipie exactly, but did finish it off with some grated cheddar.

I'm puzzled by all the positive ratings for this recipe. I cook quite a bit so I can adjust when it needs it, like this BLAND recipe which SCREAMS for more seasoning, stock, and tomatoes. It is just okay after those additions, thank goodness for the bread crumbs, a saving grace in this scenario. There is no acid to add balance in this recipe, nor is there enough salt. It doesn't have to taste bad to be vegetarian. Shame on Gourmet, didn't you TRY this recipe before you published it??

Four forks because it's easy, healthy, relatively inexpensive and just got better with age! What more could one ask from a recipe? Added a can of petite diced tomatoes, tossed in chopped fresh thyme and parsley and used veg. broth and grated fresh Parmesan on top. I think parsnips would be a great addition. Don't leave out the ground cloves....I'm not sure what it enhances as I was unable to detect the flavor, but I trust this interesting choice of spice in this recipe. Bread crumbs were good, but the "chunky crouton" idea sounds even better!

This is good, and is even better as leftovers for lunch. I followed the advice of several other reviewers and made this with broth instead of water and threw in some diced tomatoes at the end. I also made big chunky croutons rather than breadcrumbs. They were like big cassoulet sponges which frankly, was delicious. This is tasty, easy, and fairly inexpensive. Definitely a keeper.

Like so many others below, made it not-quite-veg-friendly by subbing broth, but found it quite easy and tasty. Cooked the leeks until they were practically disintegrating, they got all good and melted into them, then tossed in the other veggies (added some parsnips to complement the clove taste) The cloves are indeed a very particular taste, but we enjoyed it!

I made this in the crockpot - big mistake. It had a very odd flavor that no one could stomach. The odd flavor may have come from slow cooking the leeks and using too many.

This is just fabulous! I have to mention that I added four strips of chopped bacon and used chicken broth instead of water and it was just delicious! Perfect for a cold wintry evening instead of your everyday chili. I also shredded a bit of parmesan cheese to top it off when it was finished and used only a dash of garlic powder in the crumbs. Otherwise it would have just been too garlic-intense for me. I just finished eating it an immediately had to write this review. I can see it tasting better the next day as standing over it for one hour breating in it's delicious aroma is a bit cloying. I will be making this many more times.

Took one reviewer's suggestion for more grains but added 1/2 cup of almost- cooked wheatberries at the same time beans were added.

We loved this recipe! It is hearty and rich with interesting flavors. I did alter it slightly by adding 1/3 cup of bulgar (and 1/2 cup more liquid) about 15 minutes before it finished cooking to make it a complete protein, since I didn't think the bread crumbs would provide enough grain protein. I'll definitely make it again.
