This is a great recipe! We dried "non-wild" strawberries which not only saves the creme from dilution, but intensifies the flavor. Like one reviewer suggested, we made the caramel from just one cup of sugar, and beat 1/4 cup into the egg yolks. Having been caught out without the tart shell baked -- a small crisis while making Veal Prince Orlaf for the main course -- I served this to guests as a creme caramel with strawberries. I'm not sure that I will ever bother making the pastry again. Without the pastry step, this dessert becomes a week-night delight when strawberries are in season.In fact, I'm going to experiment with other fruits from our garden. This is the forth time we have loved this super easy recipe -- which, without the pastry step is a 15 minute "hands-on" delight.

One of my favorite desserts. I use 1 cup of sugar for the caramel and add 1/4 cup of sugar to the custard. Also, I bake the crust only 25 minutes. Wild strawberries - forget it. Just fresh local berries are fine.

I have made this several times and love it. The custard is a wonderful consistency, and relies only on the caramel for sweetness. The crust is a bit tough, so I've found it's better if you let the caramel sit on the crust for a while after you unmold it.
