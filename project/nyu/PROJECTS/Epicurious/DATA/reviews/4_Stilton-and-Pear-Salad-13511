I actually used this recipe as an appetizer and it worked wonderfully. I used endive leaves as the base and put a slice of pear, the blue cheese crumbles and chopped pecans on the leaf and drizzled the dressing over it. Great way to make salad into an appetizer!

This was a perfect salad. Dressing couldn't be easier and its simplicity was a perfect complement to the rich flavors of the cheese and pecans. Used stilton and when you got a bit with all the ingredients together it was a party in your mouth. Super delicious - will definitely use this as a staple winter/spring salad.

Made this for a dinner party and my guests raved about it! A keeper for sure. The combination of flavors was perfect. I made exactly as the recipe is written and it was wonderful. Easy substitutions would still result in a fabulous salad - blue cheese or gorgonzola, any type of pear as long as it is ripe and any mix of bitter greens, arugula!!

Loved this salad. It was my go-to for this holiday season. Substitutions were as follows: Usded D'anjou pears since that is what was ripe at our produce stand. Did not roast the pecans and used a less expensive blue cheese. Stilton is pricey and I was not sure would be worth it. It was absolutely elegant and recd many compliments.

Just made this for TG Dinner and it got RAVE reviews. It is so simple. I did get amazing pears which of course only enhanced the salad. But this is going to be my new winter staple salad and take-along to potlucks this time of year.

Lovely salad for any season. Can't beat the combination of flavors is unbeatable. We used beautiful red and green oak leaf lettuce along with belgian endive. Be sure to let the stilton come to room temperature before serving to bring out the maximum flavor.

This is a good base for a main meal salad. I added some craisins, leftover turkey some cucumber and apple slices. Hubby doesn't like blue cheese so I gave him Feta. Overall, it was an easy to prepare dinner.

Had no Stilton, so I made "Gorgonzola and Pear Salad" -- I think any kind of strong, mellow blue cheese would work well in this recipe. Delicious.

I had Maytag blue cheese, so I used it. Great salad!

I made this over Christmas, the only change I made was to candy the pecans. I served to my family of 16 and everyone loved it. I'll make this one again for sure.

Too bitter, even with the pear. I recommend more mustard.

This is one of my fall staples. The salad is great when pears are really in season, like now. I have used red raspberry vinegar w/o a problem. I also add just a "pinch" sugar or a small dollop of honey. The dressing is good on other salads as well.

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner and it was a big hit! I read reviews before hand and a lot of people said it was too 'vinegary so I decided to use Champagne wine vinegar. I used the called for amount and it was fine.

This is fabulous.Pretty easy to make.Ask the deli counter for the cheese in better grocery stores. The only drawback is how much fat is in the cheese. But,the cheese is delicious! It's good even without the pecans.

I've made this salad too often to count. It is absolutely wonderful. The flavors blend very well. When I've served it for guests, they rave about the mix of pears and cheese and when I've brought it to pot-luck parties, I always see people go back for seconds.

I loved the stilton and pear together. The dressing is DEFINATELY "vinegary" and needs some changes. I'll play with that next time.

Always a hit with company, I use a little less oil, and sometimes use walnuts instead of pecans.

Lovely salad for the fall and winter seasons. The pears and stilton are a great flavor combination.

Served at a dinner party, all enjoyed. Nice textures and flavors. I did alter the dressing...it was to "vinegary". I added almost twice as much oil. I also added some sliced scallions. I would definitely make it again.
