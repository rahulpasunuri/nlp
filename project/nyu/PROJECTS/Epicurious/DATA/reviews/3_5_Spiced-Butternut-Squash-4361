I don't know if I did something wrong, but I don't think so and except for using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, I followed the recipe. The end result had a very odd flavor that neither my boyfriend nor I liked. I expected to love this because I love all the ingredients, but it was not tasty. I threw out the recipe and won't make it again.

I had been saving a butternut squash in my pantry since fall and this was the perfect recipe to use it on. Very enjoyable just on it's own. I plan to cook up some basamti rice to use up the leftovers. so glad it included ginger and it was a great way for me to use some of my chinese five-spice, which I rarely use.

Great dish. I took quite a few liberties. I added Red Chili powder and more garlic. Once the oil was hot I added a high quality Orange, Ginger marmalade and then added the squash. Once the squash cooked almost all the way through I added molasses. What a great sweet and savory side dish!
