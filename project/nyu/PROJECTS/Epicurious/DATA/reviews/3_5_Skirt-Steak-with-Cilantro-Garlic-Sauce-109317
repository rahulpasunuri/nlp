I had this sauce on broiled salmon and it was great! I used half the oil, as other users suggested, and it tasted light and full of flavor. I did use a blender, but you could also use a Food processor and have less clean up; smaller batches tend to be messier clean-up in the blender. Next time I intend to make a double batch of the sauce and freeze it into cubes-- so tasty!

Instead of skirt steak, I used a london broil. I roasted the whole bulb of garlic prior to adding to cilantro sauce. I added some white rum to the sauce and flambeau it. Sliced the London broil thin and on an angle. Drizzled the sauce all over the sliced meat. It was off the chain!! Everyone agreed at the cook off I was competing in as well. One first place! Yay!

I found the combination of the cumin (for marinating the steak) and the cilantro sauce a little overpowering, especially since the natural flavor of the beef is so nice. I couldn't taste the steak at all, only the spices & sauce.

I really liked this recipe, both the steak and sauce. I didn't use this specific cut of meat and I used only one tablespoon of lemon juice which is enough for my taste. Next time I think I'll put less oil though, the sauce is so good it was enough for two persons only so that makes 1/8 cup of oil for one person, which is a lot if you are on a diet.

My fiance and I made this recipe last night for our first dinner party with friends in our new place. We used sirloin instead of skirt steak and added the extra garlic and lime juice as suggested by many other reviewers. Our guests loved it! It was a great and easy success. This is such a simple, flavorful thing to make, and the sauce can be used on so many dishes. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 2
Certainly not bad, but I found the steak to be under seasoned and lacking in flavor. I love cilantro and garlic and have made sauces like this before; however, this one seemed to lack a depth of flavor. While I prepared it I kept adding seasoning and an extra clove of garlic in an effort to give the sauce a bit more oomph. I love skirt steak and would make a recipe similar to this again, but not necessarily this one.

The sauce was absolutely delicious. This recipe took about five minutes to make and was restaurant quality.

I didn't realize this was supposed to be for 6 people, so when I made it and started eating it, I thought, "This is a lot of steak for 4!" But it was delicious! I love the sauce. It was a little like Argentine chimmichuri sauce, but not as spicy (thank goodness). As for technique, I pan-seared it, then finished it in the oven, according to Alton Brown's recipe here: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pan-seared-rib-eye-recipe/index.html The only thing I'd change about the recipe is the portion of the sauce. It was so good, I'd make 50% more for a good amount of sauce to steak ratio.

Rating: 4
This is really delish. For the grilling directions, though, I decided to follow Alton Brown's pan-seared, oven-finished directions http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pan-seared-rib-eye-recipe/index.html I was a little too hungry/eager to take the steaks out, so they came out rarer than I expected. But still, rare steak is better than overdone steak. And the sauce is really tasty--like chimichurri, but not as spicy.

I actually happened upon this recipe by accident. In a hasty shopping rush I bought Cilantro instead of Parsley and found this tempting treat. I used Top Sirloin Round Tip instead of Skirt Steak but was astonished at the end result. The flavors and seasoning are spot on and combine a Pesto style sauce with a hint of Indian spice for an amazing result. Outstanding!

Simple, easy recipe...took me only a few minutes to prepare. Our blender broke so we ended up only whisking the sauce with a fork, still great results. It's best to have the steaks rare, cooking only about 2 minutes on each side over high heat. Excellent, though, I must admit, but my wife and I are Tex-Mexican raised, and we always have cilantro and garlic in the refrigerator, so we doubled the garlic and cilantro. Served with baby carrots in chardonnay and fresh soda bread. Excellent...will make again.

This was really tasty, although I used an adobo spice rub from a local shop, Savory Spice Shop, here in Denver instead of the cumin on the steak. the sauce was terrific, and I could see serving it with other meats. Might be a little much for most fish, but perhaps a grilled halibut steak would be good. I served this with cornbread made with mild cheddar and green onions, and a simple arugula salad with thin sliced onion. Very popular with my guests.

I was expecting alot more from the cilantro sauce. It was okay--not much to it. It was fine on the steak, but nothing special. My diner's were split, 2 hated it, 3 liked it enough. There was plenty leftover. I won't add this to the rotation.

Rating: 4
I first had this at a friend's house and couldn't get enough of the sauce--it's great on mashed potatoes, too. When I make it, I find it's much better with flank steak. Also, using the best olive oil makes a HUGE difference in the flavor of this sauce. It's worth it to splurge because the olive oil flavor really shines thru. FABULOUS!

While the recipe as a whole is fantastic, the Cilantro Garlic Sauce is especially wonderful. I made it with lime juice in place of lemon juice and nearly doubled the garlic.

I did not use the rub on the steak, but I made the cilantro sauce. I used less lemon and more garlic, also a splash of balsamic vinegar. My boyfriend and I loved it. I bet it would be great on other things as well. You better believe this will be an all purpose sauce at my next BBQ! Try it out!

The only changes I made to this were to use lime juice instead of lemon in the sauce, and use a lot more garlic because I love garlic. This sauce is not for people who aren't garlic fans.

Wonderful! The cummin from the meat and the sauce merge into a fantastic taste. Tried it with fresh asparagus and roma tomatoes -- and a Rose wine. Strongly recommend!

I've eaten a version of this exact skirt steak and sauce at an Argentinian restaurant and this tasted nothing like it. As another reviewer noted, it was the cumin that created dissonance in the flavors. The sauce itself is good, but not great. I added extra garlic and used lime juice, too.

This is similar to a version of chimichurri sauce I make (which I think is much better than this recipe,and just as easy) 2 cloves minced garlic, about 1/2 c each chopped cilantro and chopped flat leaf parsley, olive oil, and splash of red wine vinegar. Just generously salt and pepper the skirt steaks, grill and serve with the sauce. NOW we're talking!! Guests RAVE, I make this all the time during grilling season.

Vibrant and full of fresh flavors. I will definitely make it again, but I will cut down on the olive oil in the dressing; skirt steak is quite fatty; the extra oil in the dressing is unnecessary.

I used just half the cilantro and lime juice instead of lemon juice, at another's suggestion. Whirled everything- rub ingredients and all- in the blender, then tossed it into a plastic bag with sirloin tips and marinated it for 2 hours.

Something about the rub that detracted from the delicious taste of skirt steak on the grill. Should have perhaps added some lime or used less rub. Either way the sauce was too thin and would have preferred a plain garlic aioli. Oh well, better luck next time. By the way, I am not a novice cook.

As a long time foodie, I have to say this sauce ranks in the top 5 of all time good flavored sauces.

So darned good...the only change I would make is that, because I am such a fan of garlic (the more, the merrier!) I went with another reviewer's suggestion and used three cloves.

Perfect! I used a flank steak as well, since the skirt wasn't available. The rub was perfect (we did it on the grill), and the sauce was wonderful.

I don't think I'll change that; it was wonderful with the blend. A quick and easy dish with great flavor.

I used flank steak and my family loved this -- however, next time I will use a healthy handful more cilantro in the sauce. I will also again double the amount of the rub which seemed the perfect amount and, next time, I would only consider grilling the steak on the barbecue. When I cooked the steak in our grill pan we all agreed that the taste and crispy texture of a barbecued flank steak would be much better with the wonderful cilantro sauce. Served it with the Roasted Asparagus with Feta (from this site) and Garlic Roasted Smashed Red Potatoes -- delicious!

Absolutely yummy! I doubled both the rub and sauce recipes, and used the extra sauce the next day on freshly caught, barbecued Columbia River salmon.

Fabulous! I made some adjustments (but not by choice). It was just too nasty to prepare this on the grill outdoors. Also, I cannot find skirt steak in our area. I used tri-tip steaks which I sliced into pieces about 1" thick. My husband claims he doesn't like cumin, so I marinated the slices for about 15 min. in "The El Paso Chili Co. Smoke Signals Smokey "BBQ Faijita Marinade" mixed with the cumin. I browned the beef in a large fry pan (along with whole scallions). I plan to prepare it this summer on the grill for our wine club BBQ. The cilantro sauce is divine. This is a keeper!

I made this for a dinner party & the sauce was a HUGE hit. As an accompaniment I made the roasted asparagus... also tasty. (I've never roasted asparagus in the oven, but the dish proved to be REMARKABLY easy to prepare.)

In my nearsightedness I thought the Italian parsley was cilantro in the produce aisle. Luckily I had some cilantro at home so I just mixed half and half and found that that was a flavor closer to authentic chimichurri sauce. I didn't bother making a paste as the blender turns it all into a sauce anyway - that saves time. Instead of serving it on the side, I brushed the sauce on each side about a minute before taking the steak off the grill. Made excellent filling for soft tacos.

The sauce was a hit - very fresh tasting and mixes wonderfully with the cumin rub. You definintely can use the sauce with almost any cut of steak. Quick and easy dinner.

Super quick dinner. I will make again but will definitely double (at least) the rub for the meat next time. The sauce was VERY tasty and I didn't feel having to chop cilantro required much effort.....especially knowing that if a few stems should be inadvertently included that cilantro stems are not bitter like parsley. I will make this again with skirt steak, but also will try flank steatk and boneless chicken breasts.

Great recipe. Easy, but a little time consuming with the cilantro. Flavorful with the cumin rub.

This was a little time consuming but very easy to make and spicy and delicious. I used flank steak.
