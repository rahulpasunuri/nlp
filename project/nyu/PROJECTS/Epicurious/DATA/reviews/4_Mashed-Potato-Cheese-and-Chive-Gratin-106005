delicious! I made this for thanksgiving and it was the hit of the table. Everyone raved about it. you can't go wrong with all that creamy cheese. I topped it with shredded parmesan and I think that added that extra tang it needed - balanced it nicely. very easy to make and quite the crowd pleaser.

I made this last year for Christmas and have been trying to plan my whole meal around this again this year. It is superb!

This was good, but it was missing something. Maybe a breadcrumb/parmesan crust would have helped. Or the addition of a stronger tasting cheese in the mash might have helped. Maybe a little hot sauce? This was pretty good, and a nice change, but not the ultimate... needs a bit of tweaking to get there. Make sure you salt the water that you boil the potatoes in very well, potatoes need a fair amount of salt.

made as is and was fantastic! my group of teenage boys gobbled it up.

Great addition to a holiday buffet table without the last minute prep work of mashing potatoes. Very creamy, and especially liked the way the edges browned a bit, forming a crust. I used low fat sour cream, non-fat milk and only 1/2 the amount of lowfat cream cheese, and it still had a rich taste. A keeper!

These were really good; I used mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese (because it's what I had on hand!), and it added a delicate flavor to the potatoes. I'm sure they're great too with regular cream cheese. I also added extra butter on top.

We make this every year now for the holidays. I too add some garlic and a bit of parmesan before I put them in the oven. The best part is that you can make them ahead of time; with so much on and in the stove, this a great help!

Great! Added the garlic to the water as previously suggested. Used a scallion instead of the chives. These really are great mashed potatos.

Rating: 4
This is the best mashed potato recipe ever! The only thing I added were about 4 crushed galic cloves to the boiling potato water and mixed them in with the potatoes. I can't show up to the family Thanksgiving dinner without them!

I really liked these potatoes. They were very creamy and tasty. These would be great for a party because you can make them ahead of time and then pop it in the oven.

Honestly, I felt I was eating sour cream and onion potato chips, and since I like them, I liked this dish. If you crave that taste, this recipe is for you. I'll stick with my traditional recipe.

This was yummy...I doubled the cream cheese and sour cream, and I sprinkled a bit of parmesan on top. My boyfriend absolutely LOVED it! Will definitely make again.

The best I have ever made. I have made these potatos several times for company. I am always asked to hand out the recipe at the end of the evening. Doubles well for a big crowd.

Rating: 4
Awesome! I've made it twice now. A sure crowd pleaser. No gravy needed for these potatoes!

Rating: 4
I realized that I'd followed the recipe exactly, except used abuout half of the recommended potatoes (or in proportion - double the good stuff that goes into the mash.) Have also made it with half and half instead of whole milk. Top the gratin with shredded parmesan, and bake until golden on top. Decadent. Have made it this way several times to rave reviews from guests.

The hit of Thanksgiving. I topped of dish with some Guyere - it was heaven!

Rating: 4
Unbelievably good, especially considering how little work was required. These potatoes are appropriate for a special occasion dinner, when it's nice to have one or two items that are easy to prepare.

Rating: 4
I've tried this recipe exactly as described and liked it. I've also made it using whipped cream cheese and no sour cream and liked it equally as well. I have made these potatoes early in the day, refrigerated them, and brought them to room temperature before baking - worked out fine! I agree with the reviewer who said to make sure the potatoes are really creamy when you make them because they do dry out a bit in the oven.

Rating: 4
We loved this-I cut back on the chives thinking they would overwhelm the recipe but next time I won't hold back. I will certainly make this over and over.

Rating: 3
Very good and easy side dish, especially for large gatherings or dinner parties. I add shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the top prior to baking just to give it a little something extra. I always get asked for the recipe!

Tried this so I could make the mashed potatoes in advance at Thanksgiving dinner. I thought it was fine and easy but still prefer regular mash.

Rating: 4
This is a great alternative to traditional mashed potatoes. I took the advice of another cook and sprinkled romano cheese on the top. That was the key to this recipe.

Delish! I made this with beef Wellimgton and vegetables sauteed with brown pecan butter - yummy! I think my boyfriend actually swooned!

This recipe makes a monsterous six portions. I wonder if they really mean 3-1/2 pounds of potatoes?? I used a 3 oz. package of cream cheese, about 2/3 cups of sour cream, and 1/2 stick of margarine (as a previous reviewer suggested using less cream cheese and using 1/2 stick of butter). Deleted any salt; used about 1/4 tsp. of white pepper and a generous sprinkle of garlic powder. I also increased the milk to about a cup. (I probably needed more liquid as no food store in this town sells fresh chives, so I used about 1+1/2 Tbs. of dried instead.) Do make this recipe, as it is DELICIOUS!!! A hint for those of you who cook for 2 (as I do): When it comes time to bake the gratin, butter 3 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 inch glass loaf pans, divide the potatoes evenly between the 3, and you will have potatoes for the night you make it and two leftover meals that you can either refrigerate or freeze.

Unbelieveable! The pefect dish for hosts expecting a full table. Don't hesitate to make it 2 or even 3 hours in advance - it holds up incredibly well. Besides, your guests will want to run around the block a few times the moment they hear what's in the recipe!

Made this last night for 10, doubled recipe and had a few leftovers. Wonderful recipe and pretty easy. Took suggestions to use red potatoes which took about an hour to peel were yummy. Added 3 heads of roasted garlic (we love garlic). Added shredded Romano cheese on top which browned nicely and made nice presentation. Nice make ahead recipe. Keeper and will do again.

Rating: 3
Loved this dish. Easy to do ahead. The chives and added cheese on top adds some color. Major comfort food, with a little elegance thrown into the presentation (by putting in a pretty casserole). A great addition to our New Year's meal!

Rating: 4
A great make-ahead dish that complements nearly all main courses! Very rich, so you can count on the "6" serving rating actually being good for 8. HUGE fat content, however, so save it for only the most special occasions.

Rating: 4
This version of mashed potatoes is wonderful. The make ahead step is great for letting the roast set, or cleaning up while they're in the oven. It also lends itself to many many variations. I tried the romano cheese thanks to the previous reviews and they were scruptious!

Rating: 3
Great recipe for make-ahead. I never liked all the last-minute fuss to make mashed potatoes just as the roast gets out of the oven. This is my husbands favorite Mashed potato recipe. He's requested it for Christmas Dinner!

Rating: 4
It was great!! Even though the recipe was only for 6 servings, it ended up being quite enough for an 8-person dinner. I used just a little butter and milk to make them creamy (I don't like super-hard mashed potatoes), but otherwise this was right on the money.

Rating: 4
This dish was just wonderful. My family and company have also loved it. It's a great make-ahead dish and looks so appealing w/all the chives. Can't go wrong. Have made it w/different types of potatoes w/great success.

I paired these potatoes with grilled rosemary marinated lamb chops and roasted root vegetables and got rave reviews. How can something with cream cheese and sour cream taste bad? I loved the ease of making them ahead of time and popping them into the oven just before serving. Will make again!

This was a big hit at a recent birthday party for my husband with both adults and children. So easy and went great with barbequed pork tenderloin and sirloin. Will do again!!!!!

I made this for Easter dinner, and my whole family loved it! It was great to be able to make it ahead of time and just reheat it, too.

Our family enjoys this recipe and has been doing so for at least ten years but we call it Party Potatoes and I believe the original came from Southern Living. We sometimes vary it alittle with Paprika on top or nutmeg.

This recipe is similar to one which I got from a friend & have made for several years. In my recipe (calling for 6-7 large potatos), the cream cheese & sour cream are halved & 1/2 stick butter is used in their place. Dry onion flakes & garlic powder are added. It's fabulous - if anyone wants the recipe they can e-mail me. All of these recipes of this type are good - and I always make them a day ahead - which works fine.

Wow! 'Nough said!

absoluteley delicious and SUPER creamy!!!! Everybody loved it! I took the suggestion of other cooks and threw in some grated pecorino-romano and baked garlic.

We added some grated pecorino romano (about 3/4 to 1 cup I think) and used about half as many chives. It was great!

This got rave reviews at Christmas dinner. It's really nice to have a mashed potato dish which can be made ahead

Rating: 3
Fantastic potato dish! One thing I will say, it is necessary to add plenty of salt and pepper. Otherwise, the dish is a bit bland. Next time I will probably try it with low fat versions of sour cream and cream cheese.

Rating: 4
I was a first-timer on mashed potatoes, so I messed up and over-cooked them the first time I made this. The second time I messed about with the recipe to RAVE reviews: add 2 heads of roasted garlic, and cut amount of chives in half. (Also, regarding chives, I really chopped the chives into tiny bits on the second go-around.) This ones a keeper!

I made this mashed potato recipe on Christmas Day and everyone loved it. It was delicious, very rich and creamy. I used red potatoes instead of russet potatoes which gave the dish a smoother texture. I did not bake it at the end. Just reheated in the microwave. Perfect recipe!!!

Rating: 4
This is the best mashed potato recipe that I've tried. I added a little butter as I was mashing the potatoes.

Rating: 3
Left out the final butter and just ran the dish under the broiler for a few minutes (watch carefully!). I made this for the office Christmas potluck lunch. Beautiful presentation and generally well received (people went back for seconds although I did have leftovers). One thing I noticed is that the additional baking/broiling/reheating after the mashing tends to dry the potatoes out. Make sure they're really, really creamy before baking (and transporting and reheating).

I love trying new twists to old classics, much to my family's dismay! They always want the same old meat loaf, the same old potato salad, the same old mashed potatoes, etc. I made this for Thanksgiving and they couldn't get enough. They will never be satisfied with "plain old" mashed potatoes again. I left out the chives...

I served this at a Christmas buffet and received rave reviews. I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
Simple, delicious, creamy, terrific! Made as the recipe stated but with low fat sour cream, low fat milk and low fat cream cheese. Whipped the potatoes with a stick blender right in the pan. Could have served them right away, but did 2 hours ahead and put in the oven prior to serving which was nice as I was finishing the main dish. Wonderful as is but lends itself to lots of variations with roasted garlic, cheese, etc. My family and guests loved them. Will definitely make again, many times I'm sure! This recipe serves more like 8 than 6.

this is an easy and delicious dish...it will go with any dinner. My family loved it!
