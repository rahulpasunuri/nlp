We'll make this again, but add more salt, at least half a cup of lime juice and maybe some hot pepper.

Good Holiday Item served with a cranberry chipotle chutney..I have attempted (I think successfully) to mix the middle-eastern and southwestern spices to create a uniquely bold flavor profile.I did not add the soy sauce but did make a paste with olive oil and a little honey. I only had the opportunity to marinate the steak for an hour but the flavor was still excellent. I plan on playing with the spices more on my next try.

This recipe was delicious and super easy. I too added a little soy sauce and olive oil and made it a paste. I only marinated for an hour, but the results were fantastic. Will definitely make again!

Yum, yum, YUM! This marinade was fantastic! I added a bit of olive oil and soy sauce to make the rub more of a paste and it was fabulous. Unlike some of the other comments, I thought the cinnamon was excellent as is. The steak smelled awesome as it was cooking and tasted even better.

The rub makes a nice subtle flavor but lacks acid and bite. Serve with lime wedges and dress with a sprinkling of crumbled feta cheese.

I've made this recipe many times now with great success! I add a touch of olive oil and a touch of soy sauce after I apply the spice rub and let marinate for at least 24 hrs. It works great! Don't over-cook.

Very nice, simple, quick recipe- I don't find prolonged marinating time makes much of a difference, so I usually grill this only 1 hour after applying rub. I find the most important steps are to really make a "paste", and then rub-with your fingers-the paste into the meat fibers.

A keeper, according to my husband! Super easy.

I was disappointed in this dish. I think the cinnamon was just too peculiar with the meat. My husband thought that it combined well with the basmati rice with sugar snaps that it was paired with in Gourmet, but I really didn't like it.

Made this for guests the other night and everyone complimented me on the dish and even asked for the ingredients of the rub. Quick and extremely flavorful. I've tried a number of flank steak recipes and none have never really stuck until this one. Definitely a keeper.

Parisian flophouse: You're right. I tried this raw, and I barely finished the whole thing.

I'm drawn to review this recipe once again for two reasons. First, I'd hate for someone to see the negative reviews and miss out on one of the best recipes I've ever found on this Web site -- it's outstanding, simple and lean. The second reason is to thank the cooks who recommended the Indian Baked Rice (recipe on this site) as an accompaniment. We served those two dishes last night at a dinner party and they were a huge success. Both are so simple to make, so rich in flavor and so perfect together.

Marinating flank steak is usually a given and this recipe intriged me because it was a 'rub' similar to that for barbeced ribs and we love fresh ginger. But this 'rub' is much too strong for the flavor of the meat. I let it stand overnight, maybe that was the problem. Perhaps a shorter time would have sufficed. But we felt that the flavor of the rub was so strong, that it overpowered the flavor of the meat itself. We also found it too salty.

Flank steak must be prepared before eating. I strongly advise taking such a measure.

This is my new flank steak favorite. A morter and pestle make the rub a snap; the flavor full and rich. I served it with "Baked Indian Rice" from this site. I will certainly make this again!

Delicious flavor really went through the whole steak. Made it with Quick Moroccan Vegetable Cous Cous from this site and Israeli Salad.

I enjoyed this steak - I am a flank steak fan of many years, and this was very tasty. However, it was difficult to have chosen accompanying dishes to compliment it until I had actually made it. It had a distinctly middle eastern flair, and would be wonderful with a good cucumber raita and some traditional Indian condiments. Next time I'll serve it with jasmine rice, mango chutney, currants, etc. Very good recipe!

Great Dish and my husband (who is a very picky eater) just loved it!!

Great recipe - very easy and tasty. Sometimes I don't have time to let it sit overnight, but just a few hours is plenty of time. All my guests request this recipe.

I was skeptical at first, but this turned out really well. I usually marinate my flank steaks in a wine-based marinade and was worried that a dry rub would produce a dry product; not so! Everyone loved it, and a two pound flank steak was killed off by six people in fifteen minutes flat. This one is a keeper.

Great recipe. I used a filet mignon roast and seared it then finished in the oven. I made extra of the spice rub and made a chili butter with it. I sliced the filet and put little pats over the slices. it melted and made a little sauce, yum!

I prepared the spices per the recipe, but rubbed it onto filet mignon instead of flank steak. It was delicious! My entire family (including my picky daughter) loved it.

Very interesting result with the unique spice combination. Since I used my old technique of scoring both sides into a diamond pattern, the spices were a tad heavy. On the next attempt, I'll probably cut them back by 25%.

Really loved it. Made it for family BBQ along with chicken dish and it was the first to go. Wish I would have made more!

This was easy to make. The spices worked so well together. It's a keeper. I'll be making this one again.

Cinnamon not being my favorite spice and with the warning from another reviewer, I reduced the amount by about 25 percent. After marinating for 48 hours it was ready for the hot grill. The flavor was very different for flank steak and very good. We had some leftovers the following day and the spices had permeated the refrigerated cut meat even more, making us wish we had more leftover.

This is the best marinade I've ever come across. My family loves and I've served it for guests and they loved it to. I add a little extra of each ingredient now to make it even more flavorful. Even put it on a pork tenderloin and browned it in a pan, just as good. Also my 14 year old son loves the leftovers in tortillas.

This recipe makes a really good flank steak. I broiled instead of grilling, and marinated for 24 hours. I will use a bit LESS cinnamon the next time, and probably a bit MORE cumin and black pepper. The meat gets so tender... an excellent rub. Don't skimp on the ginger or use dried; the fresh gives it zing.

Thought the menu was excellent, easy and fast! Have made it a couple of times!

Fabulous and sooo easy! We were out of ground corriander, so we substituted fresh cilantro. Marinaded for about 7 hours and enjoyed an extra yummy result. Leftovers made wonderful sandwiches the next day.

This was OK, but it's a mistake to marinate this overnight. If you do, the cinnamon and garlic take over. Do yourself a favor and marinate it only for a few hours.
