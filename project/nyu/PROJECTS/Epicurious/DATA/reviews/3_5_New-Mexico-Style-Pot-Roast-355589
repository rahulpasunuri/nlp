Very easy and really delicious, we enjoyed it very much and I'll make again this winter...

Very easy and good do-ahead recipe, especially for football night! Used Frontera brand jarred enchilada sauce with success. Did not have the hominy, and was still delicious.

I loved this recipe, especially the flavor of the sauce. I would have given it 4 forks, except that the chayote takes longer to cook than the sweet potatoes. Next time, I'll put it in at least 15 minutes earlier. I might add some jalapenos or other chilis as well.

Hmm...not sure what folks were expecting with this, but I really liked it. It's a wonderfully simple recipe, especially in a slow cooker. As a native New Mexican, I can't vouch for any authenticity, but the flavors are great and the vegetables involved are a nice change of pace. I wouldn't break it out for guests, but it's a solid weeknight option.

Made the slow cooker version (you can find it on the Cookie website) tonight and it was awful. The only flavor I could taste in the beef was beer. The flavors from the enchilada sauce, broth and everything else did not come through at all.

I liked this very much but my husband, who is a plain meat-and-potatoes midwestern farm boy, kept asking what that funny taste was. He ate it but didn't think I should make it again. I loved the kick it got from the enchilada sauce but I love him too so this is a one-time only recipe for me. The meat was extremely tender however.

I didn't exactly have high hopes for this simple recipe, but it was very, very tasty! I followed the recipe for the most part, adding some garlic and substituting butternut squash for chayote (we aren't exactly swimming in chayote in Massachusetts...). Husband and son both enjoyed it, and next time I'll know to buy a bigger roast for more leftovers. Bet this would work well in a slow cooker, too.
