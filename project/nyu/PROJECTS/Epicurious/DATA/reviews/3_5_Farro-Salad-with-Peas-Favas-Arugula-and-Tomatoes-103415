I made this recipe exactly as written except that I reduced the amount of oil to 4 tablespoons. This is a fantastic summer recipe whose simplicity allows the flavors of fresh ingredients speak for themselves.

Made as described. Good olive oil is what makes or breaks it: and when the olive oil is good, this is a really good salad -- with true farro or with wheatberries.

I have a suggestion for drkai - don't like the modifications people are suggesting? Don't use them. Even better, don't comment at all. As the old saw advises, "If you don't have anything nice to say...." Other people, myself included, appreciate reading how various reviewers have modified recipes. If I want to follow the recipe to the letter instead, I'm free to do that, as are you. Besides, I'm sure that posting reviews on the Epicurious forum is much too low-brow for you. Enjoy your Saveur.

I made this last night with wheat berries instead of farro. The only other changes I made were using pomegranate vinegar (out of red wine) and roma tomatoes instead of plum. It was incredible. It was so good, we could hardly stop eating it. The contrast of flavors and textures was really satisfying. I will definitely be making this again, it was the perfect summer salad, and I love that it is vegan! Great way to use fava beans from our CSA, too.

You pretty much nailed it drkai..couldn't agree more!

farro and spelt are not technically the same grain by the time we see them, but they are - an ancient wheat strain. I'm always amazed at how many of you basically take the concept of a dish, then modify it so much that you've created something new. Maybe it's good, but clearly has nothing to do with reviewing the recipe posted. If you want to review a recipe, do so. If you make substantial changes, don't comment. Go watch Rachel Raye, read any of the increasingly stupid cooking magazines, and find a blog. You can't just substitute artichoke hearts for fava beans, romaine for arugula and roasted peppers for tomatoes. that's a new/different recipe. Methinks you simply want to chat - sorry, maybe this is why I'm ditching my subscriptions to Bon, Gour., and all the others. They think they need to dumb themselves down like the Food network, leaving those of us who know how to blanch, poach, saute and such, to buy Saveur. To me, it's the Potterybarnization of faux haute cuisine. thanks so much!!

The salad is good, but the recipe doesn't indicate that the favas should not only be shelled, but the outer skins must be PEELED after the beans are cooked and cooled. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this. The outer skins are tough and if you've never worked with fava beans before you would never know of this necessary step.

Farro salads are not meant to knock your socks off. However, they make terrific lunches at the time of year when you're wearing sandals and don't feel like eating heavy things. I suggest using plenty of lemon juice instead of vinegar. I also recommend slivers of artichoke hearts, celery, ripe cherry tomatoes, a little red onion, a tiny garlic clove minced and Italian parsley.

I was too lazy to deal with fava beans, blanched asparagus instead. Used cherry tomatoes, red onion, marniated artichoke hearts, kalamata olives and asiagio cheese. Topped it off with a Zinfandel vinegar and a buttery EVOO. Yum!

My husband and I both love this and I have made it several times. Usually I increase the amount of vegetables. I don't think it's much work, except peeling the favas. As much as I like favas, I think you could skip them and just increase the peas. The vinegar and oil (with ample salt) really bring out the flavor of the dish, so don't skimp on that part.

This was certainly good enough to eat. Wheat berries are nice, and so is arugula, but favas and grean peas are pretty boring. There was absolutely nothing special about the dish. The time and heat it took to cook the wheat berries, favas and peas just wasn't worth it. I won't make it again.

Just a note- Farro is spelt. Rotonda

I followed the recipe without incorporating rater's adaptations. I loved it but my husband didnt. He thought it was bland and tasteless. In fact he said "why do all things that are good for you taste like nothing?" I enjoyed the texture and will use more beans next time I make it... just for me!

This was fabulous. Of course like the other reviewers here, I made a few substitutions. I used Cheerios instead of favo, and low-fat milk instead of the oil and vinegar. Sprinkle liberally with sugar, you've got a great salad. (What is it with you cooks who change virtually everything about a recipe except its major ingredient and then rate it???)

Obviously, once you make the farro you can go anywhere you please with it. I made the farro according to directions, chilled it, and then added chopped zucchini, chopped cashews, and halved red grapes. Then I added more lemon juice to taste. Easy, quick and delicious!

Great!! The only change I made was to change the proportion of oil and vinegar - I used 4 tablespoons of each. This is such a great flavor and texture combination!

Used spelt, not farro; leftover grilled corn instead of peas and favas, added the toasted walnuts recommended below, and used both yellow and red tomatoes. Delicious and had wonderful texture. I might decrease the oil by a tablespoon, and it does need fairly profuse salting. Extremely easy to make.

I doubled the dressing and used half fresh lemon juice for the vinegar, as well as grated lemon peel. I also added toasted walnuts and gorgonzola cheese. I thought it was terrific

This has become one of my staple dishes. Though I prefer more beans--and slightly less wheat berries--than the recipe calls for. I recommend always using fresh shelled favas since they're so delicious. I substitute peas for 1 cup limas (never canned!) and 1 cup shelled edamame. All my friends rave about this dish.

This recipe has become one of my trademark dishes and I have used quite a number of substitutions when I haven't been able to find everything. I really like it with wheat berries but bulgur is acceptable too. Watercress has a similar peppery taste to the arugula and lima or edamame are good substitutes for the favas. My touch that really improves the basic dish is shaved parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.

I used farro/spelt (bought at healthfood store)and the edamame which made this a lot easier than the fava beans. The flavor was good and very Italian. I really liked the farro. Later I read that it doesn't cause a reaction in people who are sensitive to wheat.

I couldn't find farro so I used orzo instead. The combination works really well together and it makes a great pasta salad. Very qick and easy to make...a keeper!!

This is a very tasty recipe, although the first time I tried it I thought it was a bit oily -- I'm going to cut back on the olive oil and give it another try. I've used favas but I suspect edamame would work; I don't think I'd use lima beans b/c they have a much more distinct flavor. You can find spelt (farro) in health food stores and stores that sell grain in bulk.

This is a wonderful summer salad, with a great blend of flavors. I am not usually a big fan of lima beans, but I used the frozen baby ones from Green Giant, and thought they were very good. I might try edamame, though, in the future, just to see the difference--thanks to previous reviewers for the suggestion!

My mom made this twice using wheat berries and it was very good. We all felt good about eating it since it's so healthy. She substituted spinach for arugala once and it didn't affect the flavor much. For those who are having trouble finding farro in the U.S., look for spelt berries. Farro is the name for spelt in Italy and dinkel is the same thing in Germany. I've found spelt in natural food stores.

Edame is a great idea! I made this with wheatberries and barley, the first time, but on a recent trip to NY I found Farro at Fairway. Everyone loved the farro, and I'm asking my local stores to find it.

I took the Tuscany issue to Tuscany with me this summer and found the farro salad at a local deli. It was made with green onions, tomatoes and cucumber and was delicious! I bought some farro in Italy and made it at home and was very pleased with the results. Does anyone know where I can buy farro in the states?

I made this using edamame too. Excellent! My boyfriend raved about it. Added a little red onion...it was perfect.

I've made this salad three times, it's wonderful! Early in the spring I used fava beans but recently I substituted Edamame (soy beans) which I think is a better choice than lima beans.

This is a very unusual and appealing salad, very easy to prepare. It was a hit with my guests, and I will definitely make it again. I would strongly suggest doubling the amount of the dressing, though, as the amount as shown in the recipe was skimpy and inadequate until I adjusted it.
