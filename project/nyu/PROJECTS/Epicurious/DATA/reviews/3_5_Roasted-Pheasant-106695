I grew up eating pheasant and wanted a fool-proof recipe that I could use to make this for my husband and children for the very first time. This recipe is great--easy to prepare, quick to cook, and delicious! I do agree with those who said that's an awful lot of stuffing to fit in one tiny pheasant cavity, and I did use pork bacon instead of turkey bacon (I think the pheasant needs the extra fat actually, especially since the one I got from the butcher was skinned already!). But otherwise, this made for a wonderful, tender bird and the vegetables were excellent with it as well.

Used this recipe for 2 pheasants (planted birds I shot). Baked for 60 minutes, removed bacon and baked for another 15 minutes. Came out perfectly! Absolutely loved the birds.

very nice - the sauce could do with a little reduction at the end and I think I would have 2 pheasants for 4 people

Made this almost exactly as recipe says except I used regular bacon and basted every 20 minutes to avoid the dryness other reviewers had. I had a 3.5lb bird and still couldn't fit all that stuff in the cavity. Anyway, it came out very tasty, with a pleasant but subtle tangerine flavor. The tangerine was much more noticeable and delicious on the vegetables.

The pheasant my husband brought home were plump but roasting this way, they seemed dry. The flavors in the roasted vegetables was delicious, however.

The taste is unique. I felt that the Tarragon sprigs were too strong of a flavor. I tried brining the pheasant for about 12 hours before preparation which may have changed the flavor. I will never know since I will probably not prepare this again.
