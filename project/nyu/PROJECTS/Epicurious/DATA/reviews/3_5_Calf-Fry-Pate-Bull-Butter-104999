I haven't tried this recipe, but once a year in the spring, just outside of Boise, we have a "Nut Fest/Nut Fry". Most often we just call the testes Mountain Oysters or preferably, "Beef Tendergroin":) They're not bad. Certainly nuthin' to write home about. We usually just slice them into medallions then pound them into tournedos, bread them like another Northwest favorite, steak fingers, and deep fry them. Served with BBQ sauce or fry sauce or cocktail sauce....some kind of dipping sauce! Anyway....I'll try this recipe this spring and get back to you :) P.S. How come so many people think cows have balls? Americans are idiots....I am an American....eeeeeeeeeek! I wonder if balls would make a decent Tournedos Rossini?

Excellent recipie for an item that is considered a delicacy in many parts of the country. Open your minds up to new foods. I am reminded of my boyfriends teenage son rolling his eyes and making fake upchuck motions when he was presented with a new food. From a former cattle country girl (NE)!

To the Cook from Spain on 10/18/03, and others, if you were to ask for cow testicles at the market the butcher would probably laugh you out of the place. The referenct to cow is typically to the female version of the bovine species, and they do not have testicles. Only bulls carry that equipment.

First, I couldn't get myself to ask for cow testicles at the market, second, I could not put them in a blender, third, I could not get the fork anywhere near my mouth. Lot's of great parts on a cow to eat, what's hanging between their legs isn't one of them.

Oh My Goodness!!! Those poor calves! I like the recipe, however I also could not ask my butcher for calf's "jewels" either! I would consider replacing the "jewels" with duck or calf livers though....the rest of the ingredients sound fabulous! I shall try it and get back to you!

Never heard of calf fries, but around Virginia you'll find Mountain Oyster, Turkey Dainties and Sweetbreads. If I could find fries, I'd try 'em!

Y'all are funny! I grew up eating "Mountain oysters" and "turkey fries." They're both great and traditionally are deep fried and served with a nice cream gravey. I must admit I never thought of frying up a dish of this ingrediant myself, much less making a pate of it!

I have cooked some unusual things in my life, but I have never even seen "bull's butter." Furthermore, I would NEVER ask the butcher to order this -- ever.

This is a great recipe...better than at an actual branding where they take them out of a bucket and fry them on sticks or wires over the branding fire.

I would love to know who first thought of eating any animal's testicles. And to go so far as put them in a blender. Yikes!

I'd like to know how many guys read this recipe & crossed their legs. Lord! Don't anyone tell Paul about this one!

Just can't picture the rough-tough cowboys at the Dead Horse Ranch sitting around eating "pate" on melba toasts, sipping wine, and discussing the day's bronco-busting.

you would have to have balls to try this one.
