I fudged this a bit - carrots, green & yellow beans, and tri-color bells were all the veg I had on hand.The beau likes some heat, so I increased the chili flakes and added some sliced Thai peppers as well. BIG HIT! This is gonna be a staple in our fridge fromm now on. I may experiment with a little bit less sugar next time, but it's pretty effin excellent as is, so maybe not!

My batch chilled for five days before serving. The pickles developed a good sweet-sour bite. My guests enjoyed them, but they seemed just a bit too sweet to me. Next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar.

These were a great, but next time I'll try just a bit of salt and a touch more pepper. A new Christmas fave.

This is at the top of my pickle list now. My brother-in-law had a whole jar by himself. The fennel is not very strong if anyone is concerned about that flavour. Next time I would either cut the peppers larger, or not put them in the hot water as long because they were limp. Everything else was awesome!
