This is delicious. I used buttermilk, sourdough bread, fresh type and green chilies. Instead of mozzerella, I used colby jack. Yum!

I used 16 ounces of mild Italian sausage, 3 cups of milk, 1/2 cup heavy cream, dried thyme, hard Italian bread cubes, and omitted the goat cheese. I also sauteed the onion while cooking the sausage in the pan and added a dash of olive oil so it wouldn't stick. It needed to bake less than 45 minutes in my oven. This is a very rich dish so a little goes along way. Very good though!

This egg strata is one of the best I have ever made or tasted. I seem to always be throwing bridal and baby showers (mostly brunches because they are fun and easy) and this is my GO TO recipe! I don't change a thing and the goat cheese on top just adds something extra! Easy to make the night before and pop into the oven in the morning!

I went with the "French" variation in the introduction and the flavors were nice. As another reviewer noted, the texture of this is more of a bread pudding - not nearly as eggy as I was hoping for in a brunch food. I bet it would be really good with the sausage and sun-dried tomatoes.

Made this (using turkey sausage and leaving bread crusts on), and really enjoyed it. Because the bread is cubed (rather than sliced as in some other recipes), it almost has more of a bread pudding consistency.

My sister made this for the day after Thanksgiving brunch. It was VERY good. I will make it for my friends.

I made this for the second time and both times it was a huge hit. It's really decadent with all the cheese and whole milk, but worth it. I didn't take off the crust this time and I thought it added a more rustic taste and look to it, so I wouldn't bother with the trimming.

Delicious! I served this for brunch on a Sunday, then ate it for lunch AND dinner on a Monday (it reheats beautifully) - THAT'S how good and satisfying it was. Portions are generous. I can also see varying the types of meats, cheeses and spices for a unique strata each time. I served it with roasted yams, melon, Prosecco with a pour of St. Germain in the bottom of the glass to drink - very nice combination of flavors.

Great brunch recipe. I made this for Christmas morning. It is quite easy to make and the flavor is wonderful. I may use something other than goat cheese next time. I don't like that it doesn't melt so you get bursts of the unique flavor that doesn't particularly work with the other cheeses, etc.

I served this strata to a bunch of hungry runners after a 5 mile race. They raved over it. i had so many requests for the recipe. My secret is one i followed from a review. i bought crusty sourdough loaf from the fresh bakery section of the grocery and cut it up crust and all. i prepared the night before. I didn't have large eggs so I used 10 medium. I will make this again. a big hit

I've made this recipe several times and I never have leftovers. Last time I made it I only had oil- packed sundried tomatoes and 2% milk - still rave reviews. I also mixed crusty sourdough bread in with regular bread - Yum. I've also used really good breakfast sausage instead of hot Italian sausage if the company I'm making it for can't stomach hot sausage.

I made this for brunch from the Bon Appetit cookbook (same recipe)--excellent. Everyone loved it--used sourdough (w/crust) instead of white, but otherwise followed exactly. Made it the day before and popped it into the oven. Quick, easy, delicious! Would make again, no changes.

This was great without the sun-dried tomatoes and with mild sausage, carmelized onions and gruyere instead of parmesan. In consideration of the kids, I put the goat cheese on only half the strate. It will definitely be a regular entree in our house.

I made this dish for a large brunch with my in-laws. It was the first and only pan to be completely emptied. It is very simple and very tasty.

I made this strata for brunch on Christmas morning and thought it was very mediocre and uninteresting.

Rating: 4
This recipe is yummy - everybody I've ever made it for thinks it's yummy. Even my hubby, who doesn't care for goat cheese, loves the recipe. I'd suggest to those who made it and thought it was awful to get cooking lessons. Obviously you're not doing something right! And please don't tell me you've made changes and then complain about the consistency or the taste! Ugh!

Great strata! Easy to put together and the flavors were wonderful together. I also make the Proscuitto and Goat Cheese strata regularly and I think I might actually like this one more. This one has less bread so there doesn't seem to be a risk of it coming out dry.

I'm extremely fussy about recipes. This was a fabulous strata that I will make often. My "lunch group" just left and each of them wanted the recipe!! The only changes I made was using extra large eggs,whole milk,left out the salt (sundried tomatoes, sausage and parmesan cheese are high in sodium) and used extra goat cheese and mozzarella. Don't overbake and it will be nice and creamy. Bon appetit!

I added some mushrooms, red pepper, and added left over cheese's that i had in the frig. It was awesome! I made it the night before and let sit in the frig over night. I cooked it easter morning. The crowd that came for brunch raved about it.

Tehis dish was simple to make and excellent! I mixed Jimmy Dean sausage and some good smoked ham, used leeks and added Guyere to the Mozzarella. Very flavorful. Did not use the tomato, goat cheese, or the thyme. For those who found it mushy maybe their oven isn't at the proper temp or it wasn't preheated. This puffed up beautifully and was very light. Will make again for sure!!

I had high hopes for this recipe. No one in the family really liked it and no one ate the leftovers!!

This is a wonderful dish. I was worried that it would be too spicy with the hot sausage - I used 4 hot and one fennel sausage. I also didn't have the mozzarella or goat cheese so shedded a little cheddar on top. I was happily surprised with the results. Next time I'll just use the hot sausage as it wasn't spicy at all.

This is a FABULOUS recipe -- I have made it many times and will make it many more -- always to rave reviews. I skip the goat cheese (too strong) and double the shredded mozzarella.

It never ceases to amaze me that people will say they didn't care for a recipe, but then admit that they changed it in some way (witness the 5/2002 comment from a reviewer in Oklahoma). The changes that person made were substantial. No wonder she didn't think this recipe was good. Personally, I enjoyed it very much. I cooked it--in accordance with the recipe--for my church men's breakfast. Serves 8? Ha! Four of us demolished about 3/4 of it! This was definitely good.

My brunch guests liked the strata, but I wasn't so crazy about it. I did use breakfast sausage instead of Italian & I added salsa & monterey jack. Trust me, without the salsa, it would have bordered on bland.

I found this dish to be just so-so. Since it's a strata, it comes together in a snap, but as for flavor - there are better stratas out there. I would rate it a (1), but since I think it could be improved with tweaking (add veggies, etc.) I won't rate this.

Call me old fashioned...but this dish really tastes like badly done quiche to me... the texture was just off...I've tried it with regular home made challah, and a baguette, hoping for better results...but no luck. It was mushy and strange. The second time around, one of my guests suggested he run out and get bagels. It was very embarrassing.

I have been making this dish for Easter Brunch for several years and recently lost my copy which is why I logged on to get a new printout. It's a favorite with everyone who comes to brunch. It's flavorful and unusual, easy to prepare in advance, and stays warm well on the buffet table.

First I followed recipe above, very tasty. The second attempt with hardy french bread, westphalian ham, fontina, fresh rosemary and oregano. Omitting the tomato. It was outstanding.

Really great. I had 6 people for brunch and there was nothing left. I went with the french version, but used sauteed leeks instead of the onions. It turned out more like a souffle than an egg casserole. I'll be using this recipe again.

Yuuuuummmmy! I used regular Jimmy Dean sausage instead of italian and it was just great. My husband didn't like the goat cheese but I did. I also let the bread dry a couple of days over Thanksgiving along with the rest of the bread I was going to use in dressing. A really nice holiday brunch dish.

This is my absolute fav for breakfast company. I have used this for Christmas morning a few times and have been thankful for having something that I could make the night before. I have tried to halve the recipe and I had trouble with the centre not cooking thru. I would suggest that you follow quantities and cooking as stated.

A great basic strata recipe: add or substitute almost any vegetable or meat. Somehow, the strata ends up tasting much lighter (though still satisfing!) than one would expect.

A really great brunch dish. one successful variation substitutes sauteed red peppers, carmalized onion, sweet white corn and a dash of cumin. delicious

I made the "french twist" version for a family get together. It was very good, however, next time I would include some low salt ham and perhaps some mushrooms.

Used it first 4 weeks ago and have been requested to make it twice since plus my daughter wanted the recipe and also received rave reviews. We used the French version and it was wonderful. Since it is made the day before, it is also easy on the cook.
