Like the earlier reviewer, I added "minced garlic, chopped onion, garam masala, a touch of tumeric and a touch of paprika. Served with couscous and drizzled chopped cilantro on top." Added tamarind chutney to the dressing as well as some agave nectar & a bit of olive oli which all helped the consistancy & mouth-feel & added some sweetness. A bit of salt to enhance it all. Used Fage non-fat Greek yogurt. Poaching the chicken is key -- so moist! Served the dressing over chicken, couscous and greens.

The title, which reads "Chicked," tells you all you need to know. This is for folks with no taste, and no talent. Yucch.

A satisfying weeknight meal, but nothing to write home about. The double-kick of the yogurt and lime juice made the sauce way too tangy, and it completely overpowered the relatively bland chicken.

Helloooo? Folks, this is not a curry sauce. This is a curried yogurt sauce. I can't imagine anyone seeing these simple ingredients and expecting some kind of magical transformation of a major ingredient they don't like! HINT: Yogurt is sour. If you don't like it, don't make this recipe! If you do like yogurt, then this is a nice not-too-in-your-face sauce for poached chicken.

I lost this recipe and went nuts till I found it again. If you like yogurt and curry, this great way to use up extra yogurt. Very tasty.

Though I like the poached chicken and will use this method again (though with boullion cubes instead of canned broth, since this requires a lot of broth), the yogurt sauce was not very good. We did not eat it with rice, which I think would soak up some of the sour tang of the sauce, but there is entirely too much of it, and the dish really needs more flavor than that sauce provides. Also, the curry and cumin powder aren't really incorporated, so it even felt a little gritty. I will poach chicken this way again, but will definitely find a better sauce.

Yuck! Don't waste your time. I took a taste of the sauce and threw it away. I love curry and cumin. Better recipes can be found.

I had originally gave this recipe a poor rating because I don't like it as written. Once I tasted it on the chicken it was actually really good. I added lots of cilantro, green onion, ginger and garlic and pulsed in the food processor. It was very sour so I added mango chutney which really helped and I'm looking forward to using it with shrimp or on a salad tomorrow night.

Wow - was this ever oddly sour - and I hardly used any lime juice at all (my lime was one of those useless pulpy ones). I didn't make it with the mango salsa so I'm assuming that the sweetness would have made all the difference. So I added some mango chutney which really improved it. But, as written, I would not make this again. (I made it in the food processor and added cilantro, green onion, ginger and garlic which was very pretty.)

This dish compelled me to write my first Epicurious Review. I made a few additions to the sauce because my boyfriend and I like more spice: minced garlic, chopped onion, garam masala, a touch of tumeric and a touch of paprika. Served with couscous and drizzled chopped cilantro on top. It's a healthy, savourous dish which I will certainly make again. . . next time I'll try it with rice.

A winner! Light and luscious, great with couscous and the mango salsa. And easy too!

I have made this several times now, each to positive reviews. Most recently I ended up with extra chicken breasts and quite a bit of extra yoghurt sauce, so I diced the chicken, boiled some potatoes and then mixed it all together to make an excellent curried chicken salad. The only thing missing was a crunchy element. Next time I'll add a bit of onion.

We loved this recipe. True that it is 'limey' but that's one of the reasons we picked it. It made way, way, way too much sauce; even cut in half I believe it would have been too much for me. I added and extra tsp of curry powder and the kick was fine. I thought another variation would be to mix the sauce with rice and serve under grilled chicken. This is quick and easy, also looked and tasted as though a lot more energy went into it.

We really did not like this recipe. It was very plain, and had way too much lime. With all the good curry recipes out there, I don't know why anyone would want to make this.

I'd rate this recipe a 4 on ease and speed of preparation. Our guests rated it delicious. Presentation of the dish - which is monochromatic - is enhanced by serving the breasts on a bed of greens, cilantro or other green leaves strewn on top, and a sprinkling of curry or chili powder over the chicken. Of the mango salsa (a suggested accompaniment) and the curried yogurt sauce, we preferred the yogurt (which is not, by the way, very spicy). I'd definitely prepare this dish again; a very good selection for a prepare ahead-of-time buffet or dinner.
