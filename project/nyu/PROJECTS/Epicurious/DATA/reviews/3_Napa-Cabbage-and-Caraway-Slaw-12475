Yes, it's not elaborate. However, it's light, fresh and clean-tasting and goes with a lot of things and takes 5 minutes to prepare.

My husband loathed this. I liked it okay but think it should be a garnish rather than an individual salad. There are too many wonderful slaw recipes out there to waste your time on this one. The redeeming qualities are ease of preparation and simplicity of ingredients. If you don't enjoy cooking and just want to throw something together because you need a green vegetable, you might like this. If you're looking for a creative and outstanding dish, this is not it.

Simple but unique flavor. The napa cabbage makes such a light texture compared to other types of slaw. This salad was still good four days later. I used canola oil and partially ground the caraway seeds. Yum! I would make this for guests or a pot-luck since it's simple and can be made in advance.

The only modification I made was to use less green onion - by half. This was a delicious, refreshing cabbage salad and was well-received. I will also use this next time in sandwiches i/o lettuce.
