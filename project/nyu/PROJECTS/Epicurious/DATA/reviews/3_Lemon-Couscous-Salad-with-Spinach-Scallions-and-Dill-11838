This is a great side dish, especially for grilled fish. Used chicken broth to up the flavor, and using the whole wheat couscous adds more nutrition. Needed a LOT more lemon for my taste, and crumbled feta on top added a salty bite. It's a keeper.

to jazz this up, i made the couscous with chicken stock instead of plain water (and omitted the additional salt). i also tossed in 1/2 c. toasted pine nuts and upped the lemon juice to 4T. we can't get enough of this stuff.

I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe. It was pretty bland, and was not very filling. I definitely wouldn't call this a main course, and it has too many calories for a low-calorie side dish. I won't make it again.

this recipe is great! My husband and I are attempting to eat healthier. more green veggies and whole grains. This recipe was perfect! I added a bit more lemon as we like our foods acidic. but mostly I kept it pretty much the same as written. My husband loved it and I wasn't expecting it. He always says he doesn't like couscous but paired with the fresh veggies and lemon he just raved about it. I paired it with lightly sauteed and spiced prawns. It was just perfect. I will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe for Easter with the Roast Lamb Loin Persillade (also very, very good when using cooks comments.) After reading the reviews I thought I'd spice it up a bit. I used less oil than it called for, substituted arugula for the spinach, tossed in crumbled goat cheese and topped with slices of fresh lemon and sprigs of fresh dill for garnish. It was amazing! My family is requesting both the Lamb and the couscous next year. I love it so much I'm making it again this weekend with grilled Mediterranean herbed Cornish game hens and grilled eggplant "fries."

This dish was fantastic! My boyfriend loved it so much that he asked me to make it again the same week --- only this time he requested that I double the recipe. It has a very unique flavor. However, when making this dish be sure that you refrigerate it for at least 2 hours. It's best when it's really cold.

Great recipe. Made it to take to a BBQ and everyone loved it. I used a lot more lemon and dill than called for an added lemon zest. Nice and light.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!! This is my all time favorite summer side dish. I have 4 dill plants growing in my garden specifically to make this recipe. =)

I did a "Greek twist" on this recipe by adding some crumbled feta and fresh chopped tomatoes, and omitting the spinach. It was very flavorful this way and healthy too!

I have been making this recipe for years - ever since I found it here 6 years ago. I love it!

I thought it was great. I did add a little more lemon and a little less oil. Very refreshing.

It's a nice basic recipe. I spooned the salad into small cups to make individual serving molds, which looked pretty on the plate and held their shape well. Next time, lots less dill and scallions, more lemon and maybe some hot pepper sauce.

This recipe read well. I used fresh spinach, scallions and dill from my garden, but it was kind of bland. I tried jazzing it up with extra lemon juice, salt, pepper and garlic, but it still tasted bland. Maybe I should have added some smoked salmon like the previous reviewer did, but I really don't think it would help.

Pretty good. I added smoked trout (~4 oz.) and it was a great addition to the lemon and dill. I also substituted Swiss chard for the spinach with very good results.
