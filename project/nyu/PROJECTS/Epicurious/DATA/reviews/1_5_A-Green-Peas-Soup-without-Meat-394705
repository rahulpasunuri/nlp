If you follow the instructions regarding the cooking time of the peas, the soup will not be bright green as shown in the photo. Cook the peas only until they are just tender - for fresh English peas that may be only 3 - 5 minutes and for frozen peas for only 10 - 12 minutes. The cooking time of 45 minutes is too long. In addition to decreasing the cooking time, I would add additional salt, pepper, mace, thyme,and majoram, as well as sauteed leek the next time I make this soup.
