Two sweet potatoes didn't quite give me three cups of mash, so baked another one and ended up with four cups of mash, so I set one cup aside. Here in Canada, Ricotta comes in containers of 475 grams, but 12 ounces = 340g, so I set 135g aside. Drained the ricotta, finely chopped my grated parm in the food processor and added the first three together. After reading the recipe again, decided itcouldn't hurt to add the bit of extra sweet potato and ricotta (which I mad sure to squeeze), so I did. Added the rest of the ingredients as written and ended up with so much dough. Used about 3/4 cup of extra flour for the extra potato & extra ricotta. Placed 5 of the 6 balls of dough into baggies and refridgerated for later. Made the most amazing gnocchis we have ever had! Too tired to do the brown butter with sage, so just melted some fontina cheese over mine, and some blue cheese over my husband's portion... SO GOOD! My husband said it was "Excellent!"... and it was!!!

This was awful. Tasted bland and soggy, no sweet potato flavor left. Not impressed. Try another recipe!

This recipe was fantasic. Every memeber of my family of four loved it, including my 2.5 year old who can be a tad particular. I halved the recipe, used about 3 Tablespoons of butter in the first batch and then olive oil in the second. I also added minced garlic to the pan when sauteing. I would certainly make tihis again, especially if we were having guests that I wanted to impress. The seasonings were really nice and the texture was lovely. My four year old even helped me make the gnocchi. As I cut out the pieces, she pressed them down with the fork. Even though this took a little bit more time, it was nice for us to have bonding time in the kitchen.

This recipe is restaurant quality. I travel often, and eat at the best restaurants around the country. This competes with any pasta dish I eat at an upscale restaurant. I made this for a group of friends, and they loved it. This was a time-consuming recipe, but not bad considering how much it yields. I did this in two steps. I baked the sweet potatoes, and let them cool overnight. The next morning, I made the dough, and then finished the recipe. Everything worked for me, just as the recipe indicated. To make it a dessert-like dish, I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar to the brown butter. Will definitely make again.

I thought the gnocchi came out perfect. I loved the flavor and texture. It was honestly a bit too much work for me, but I had tons of dough left over to freeze for future use. Regarding the brown butter and sage, I think I prefer just some olive oil, parmesan, and maybe some fresh chopped basil?

I made this as a side to a spiced pork tenderloin with a maple chipotle sauce. The gnocchi was very good, but I have to admit it was a fair amount of work. Fortunately, there was enough left over to freeze for future meals.

This was extremely time consuming and came out very poorly. Too much flour, maybe? And the butter sauce over everything was a bit sickening, too rich.

This was my first time making gnocchi and I was amazed at how easy and fun it was. While a bit time-consuming, it was completely worth it in the end! This recipe makes a lot, probably 150-180 gnocchi. I made it as an appetizer at Christmas dinner for 14. Everyone wanted more! I only used 1.5 sticks butter for sauce. Extremely savory!

I also used far less butter. I really enjoyed this recipe however. I didn't find that the cooking time changed that much in terms of texture. I tried everything from 3 minutes to 6 and didn't find much difference in the end results.

Absolutely delicious. This is a somewhat heavy dish and the portion sizes can really be small because you'll fill up fast. If you're only cooking for 2, definitely cut this recipe in half. It took me a couple of hours to put this dish together. Nothing about it is terribly complicated, but a few tips: 1. Make sure you cook the sweet potatoes all the way through. This took longer than the time suggested on the recipe. 2. When you go to boil the gnocchi, put a timer on for EXACTLY 5 minutes. Any longer than that and they will get too mushy. 3. The amount of butter suggested in the recipe was a little much for our taste. The next time I make this, I will likely cut down on the butter or try to do something with olive oil and safe. 4. I used a little more nutmet and brown sugar than recommended to really bring out that sokey/sweet/wintery taste. Turned out really nice!!

I made the first batch and sauteed them, but couldn't get the light crust I wanted. I boiled the second batch, let them dry, and dusted them in rice flour. When I sauteed these, they were perfect! Also,I only used about 3-4Tbsp butter, not the 2 sticks called for!

Rating: 3
This recipie needed more flour than what it said it needed. I used finely milled wholewheat, and it worked out just fine. Remember to fold in the flour lightly using your hands, rather than mixing it in, which would destroy the texture. But despite the lightness of the gnocchi, this was still a heavy meal. I'd recommend a sharp tomato salad beside it, nothing complicated.

I'm making this right now. I've already cut enough gnocchi to cover one cookie sheet, and it looks as if there's enough dough left to feed about 30 more people! For future reference, do I have to complete the recipe up to boiling the gnocchi? Or up to cutting the raw dough? Or can I divide the dough and freeze it in small discs?

My family loves gnocchi with sage butter, so we couldn't resist trying this variation using sweet potatoes. We love it, and it has become a regular, with a couple of modifications. I don't use ricotta - mainly because it's something I don't usually have on hand. We just make the gnocchi the same way we usually make it with white potatoes, just adding eggs, flour, and salt. The sweet potatoes do seem a little stickier, and require a bit more flour. Also, we don't like to use nutmeg in dishes that aren't sweet, so that gets left out. The only other clarification I would add is that it is important to cook the sage in the butter until the sage is crisp but not burned. The combination of browned butter and crisp sage is remarkable.

My boyfriend and I made this for our Valentine's Day dinner, and thought it was exceptional. We cut the butter in half, and were generous with the nutmeg, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and only had to add 2 1/2 cups of flour. They were very flavorful, especially against the brown butter/sage combination. For those reviewers who complained that they weren't 'fluffy' enough - they're not the light as air gnocchi served in some restaurants, but they are pleasantly chewy without being tough at all. Definitely recommend.

Great recipe! I've made it twice now and both times it's turned out well. I agree with other posters - make sure the sweet potato is completely cool before making the dough and also dry out the ricotta as much as possible (paper towels worked well for me due to time crunch). Don't handle the dough too much and only use enough flour to form a workable dough. Didn't love the sage butter sauce - too rich for me. This time, I made it with homemade pesto and it was delicious!

Rating: 3
Gnocchi was tasty and easy to make (though time consuming), but the main flaw of this recipe was the recommended boiling time. Only boil for 3 minutes, at most!! I boiled one batch for 6 and each piece was ruined. I also used greek yogurt and fat free ricotta cheese. I would also recommend decreasing the amount of butter in the sauce (just unnecessary, and an easy way to cut some calories). This recipe makes enough to feed an army. I froze some to hopefully boil and reuse. Tasty result though!

If you are wondering if this recipe is worth the trouble, wonder no more - IT IS! I have been making this recipe 3-5 times a year since I found it in 2007 and my husband and I (along with anyone else who has ever tasted it) LOVE IT! It's a lot of work-takes me about 3 hours from start to finish. Making half the recipe saves time and still feeds plenty of people-only problem is there are no leftovers to store... so next time I want them I have to do the whole thing all over again from scratch! So I rather do the big batch and save some. We like the sage-butter sauce but skip it all together for these gnocchi and serve them instead with a gorgonzola or blue cheese sauce - YUM! Sweet and salty all in one and the blue cheese keeps up with the strong flavors of the gnocchi-not too light a sauce or too overpowering(assuming you like blue cheese)just make sure you use GOOD CHEESE & find a good recipe! We also like these gnocchi just drizzled with some honey for a sweeter meal. Enjoy...

Excellent gnocchi, with flavour enough to stand alone. The brown butter sage sauce (very Italian) is the perfect finish. Building on the suggestion of another reviewer, I added chopped hazelnuts: squisito!

We make these every Easter in my family and the kids get involved doing the rolling and cutting while we are finishing the rest of the meal (usually a fish and a salad). The gnocchi turn out perfectly and the sauce (it *is* an authentic "sauce" if you're Italian) goes well on lightly grilled fish with lemon, too. Add a nice butter lettuce salad and you've got a light and bright spring meal!

This was not the light fluffy gnocchi I wanted but I think it was user error. I'm not a dough person - I rarely make bread or pastry - so I think there was too much flour in my dough. Gnocchi will remain a good reason to eat out for me.

Really delicious. I can't believe how well they turned out! Not difficult, but time-consuming. However, this recipe makes plenty of gnocchi so now I have a pre-boiled stash in my freezer. I only boiled the little buggers until they floated; then pulled them out. I only used 1 stick of butter. And seriously, since when is sage swimming in cooked butter a "sauce"? You could just saute these babies in a mist of oil and they'd still be delicious. I served them alongside a pork tenderloin. Yum.

This was totally outstanding. I had never made gnocchi before & was quite nervous. They turned out beautifully. I was just cooking for me & my husband, so I actually put about half the dough wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge. The recipe makes enough for an army. I was a little unsure how to do the fork-indentation thing, so I actually referred to an Italian cooking bible, "Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking" by Marcella Hazan. Her description of how to do this was much more detailed, but I must confess - I was still confused. So that was one part of the recipe I sort of "made up," and it was fine. I found the rolling out to be a little tedious, but everything was fabulous, so really, no complaints. Did a spinach salad with parmesan & pears to accompany this. And the rice pudding/gala apple caramel sauce dessert. Fabulous anniversary dinner!

I didn't drain the ricotta first, so I ended up having to add more flour, which unbalanced the sweet-potato.flour ratio a bit. But regardless, this recipe was absolutely fantastic, and I'm still thinking about how delicious it was the next day. Definitely recommend it.

Great stuff. Best gnocchi secret I ever learned was to let the riced or milled potatoes get completely cold before mixing everything else in. They absorb MUCH less flour that way

this recipe was pretty good- apparently, the key to fluffy gnocchi is using the minimal amount of flour, and i would focus on this aspect if i made them again. i used way less butter than was recommended, and as another reviewer had suggested, i added pecans to the butter sauce with the sage. they were overall pretty good, but i was hoping for lighter than air gnocchi and i didn't quite achieve that.

Oops. I forgot an important freezing tip. Freeze them on a flat sheet without touching each other first. Then you can vacuum seal them. If you drop them together before they are frozen they'll stick together so hard they won't come apart. I used a hammered to shatter them apart. It was a bad day for gnocchi.

We love this recipe and have made it several times. One tip to consider. If you want to make a large batch and freeze them for later. Don't boil them first and then freeze. Just freeze them, and later drop them frozen right into the boiling water. They'll still float to the surface when they are fully cooked even from frozen.

This was delicious - despite burned fingers on the yams. I think I will boil them for more even cooking and then cool them almost completely before mashing next time. I boiled them all and froze half. A few weeks later, desparate for something yummy on a cold night, I tossed them back in the boiling water for 2 minutes and then into the pan with the butter and sage, and had a spectacular meal in just a few minutes. A green salad is a good counter balance for the richness of the brown butter. Next time I make this, I'll do a double batch to freeze even more. This is a real winner.

I have made this recipe at least 5 times, and every time I get tons of compliments. Like the other reviewers, I half the butter. It's not necessary to use the full amount. It's well coated with just 1 stick. Also, I drain the ricottaby sitting it in a bowl wrapped in paper towels. I et it sit for about 20 - 30 minutes and it's totally fine. Not too runny at all. The fork pressing at the end is cute, but honesty, you will save tons of time by skipping that part. No one will notice. Garnish with a few large leaves of sage on the side. I usually serve this dish as a side dish. I have served it with pork medallions with onion vinegar sauce on top (recipes for pork and sauce from the joy of cooking) and also for those who don't like pork with baked chicken stuffed with olives and chevre. I think the pork goes best though. Be careful when you microwave the yams. They are very hot to the touch.

Good recipe, but I struggled a bit with it. I think I overcooked or over-punctured the sweet potatoes because my dough was dry. Also, the amount of butter called for is WAY too much. I used half the butter and it was still too much. I may try a different sauce to make it lighter.

The flavour was incredible - I made this for Thanksgiving (as the appetizer) and it was loved by all.

However, it is already being requested as a repeat for next year...so...I'm definitely going to make it again!

Just came back from serving these, they were delicious! As I said below, I boiled the gnocchi and them froze them. Then today I let them defrost slightly before throwing them in the sage butter. I only cooked half of the batch tonight, so I only used 1 stick of butter. It was not too rich, but it may have been if 2 sticks were used. There was a mild sweet potato taste, and a strong Parmesan cheese taste. Every loved it.

I have completed the gnocchi through the boiling. I am freezing them and then will be frying them the next day. It took 3 1 pound yams to get 3 cups, so be prepared. I drained the ricotta overnight, and even though it looked completely dry when I put it in the sieve, 2 Tbsp had drained the next morning. I only needed 2 1/3 cups of flour to get a good consistancy of dough.

We make this frequently. It is divine. The raw gnochhi freeze well and can be prepared at a moment's notice. I have found that the gnocchi are much better having sat a room temp at least 30 minutes (to dry out a bit) before sauting in sage butter. If I have not allowed time for that, I put them on a cookie sheet and pop into a 350 degree oven for a few minutes before sauting.

Very good. I'd never made gnocchi or any kind of fresh pasta before for that matter and these were delicious. I felt the brown butter sauce was too rich and cooked the second batch in olive oil, sage, and garlic for a lighter flavor. Also, these freeze really well as one batch makes a lot.

I loved the recipe, but didn't like the browning in butter. I think that I would substitute a different sauce, such as a tomato cream or vodka sauce instead. Don't worry about the "fork" step - its overrated and the dumplings turn out just fine without it.

This is a great idea, but I agree it needed some adjustments to keep it from turning out kind of insipid. I found that tan sweet potatoes work much better than the red (less watery), and that it was better without sugar. Absolutely make sure your ricotta is as drained as it can be, otherwise you'll end up with a lot of flour and not much sweet potato flavor. Oh, and if you're quick it's better just to roll them straight off the fork into the pot; it's just less of a mess that way. Finally(!), I found the sage sauce just doesn't stand up-- I used toasted pecans and less than half the butter called for; you want to make sure there's a nice salty-sweet balance between the gnocchi, butter, and nuts. After all the experimentation, though, it turned out a huge hit.

This was the first time I made gnocchi and it turned out great! I had no problems with the dough and actually didn't have to use all the flour called for before the dough reached the right consistency (I did drain the ricotta overnight in the fridge, perhaps that is the key). Also used a combination of white sweet potato and red yams, the white sweet potato seemed to be less watery when cooked as compared to the red yams. I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the amount of butter: I used about 1 stick and even that was plenty. I'm not looking for other gnocchi recipes I can try, maybe pumpkin for the fall?

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was very easy and the best textured of all the gnocchi I've made. I would reduce the butter a bit in the sauce though. It's a winner because the gnocchi are substantial enough to go without meat, and subtle enough to pair with simply prepared cuts (I served w/ breaded pork chops).

This dish was good but the method of the recipe was a total disaster for me. I had the wettest mess of a dough and probably added twice as much flour just to be able to work with it. It did not hold any shape and therefore did not look like the picture but the flavor was great. Next time I won't bother forming it and will just drop tiny spoon fulls in to the water, luckly I refrenced a carrot gnocchi recipe from Marcella Says and that gave me the idea to free form the dumplings. It made enough for a family of twelve but reheats fine.

This is how I always cook gnocchi but I followed the recipe and cooked for 5 minutes. The first batch turned out very soggy. When we finally ate the finished product we felt the gnocchi was definitely lacking in the sauce it was served with. Perhaps if they had some other sauce they could be very good. We thought a light cream sauce.

Absolutely divine. I made this only for myself, so divided the recipe by fourths. And not realizing beforehand I needed to drain the ricotta, I put it in a bowl with a lot of paper towels, worked very well. The fork squashed it, won't do that next time. Can't wait to make it again!

Easy, but time consuming for me. Also had a tough time with the fork. I ended up with a bunch of funny shaped orbs of dough. BUT - as I don't usually like gnocchi, this was really good! I wonder if my dough was still to wet? I had trouble with it sticking -and ended up using about 3/4 cup of extra flour (even with very well drained ricotta)

This is a fabulous recipe! Very easy (though my gnocchi looked nothing like the picture! Can't figure out how to do the fork thing). Also I sauteed them in the brown butter for a while longer than called for --this browned them nicely and made them a little crisp on the outside -- which was a great contrast to the softer inside consistency. Was definitely as good as anything similar I've had in a nice restaurant. Somehow these gnocchi just come out well without the fuss (I've made other regular gnocchi recipes with mixed results). I tried to freeze the leftovers, but they came out of the freezer in a lump, even though I had floured them. Oh well. Definitely try this recipe. Great for guests (either as appetizer/first course or entree). Delicious.

Wonderfully simple recipe. The bits about rolling the gnocchi under a fork were not terribly clear to me, and that was the hardest part, requiring the most dexterity. When I make this again, I'll cut back on the butter considerably, and put more ricotta into the pasta itself to make it fluffier.

This is a fantastic recipe. I Knew I wasn't going to have time for the baked potato step so I picked up a can of sweet potatoes (yams) and put it through the ricer. The ricotta I used did not have water, so skipped the sieve procedure too. The end result? Everyone flipped out over them. The dough was the most pliable dough I've ever worked with and I've never made gnocchi's so fast. One more thing - I skipped the skillet step - just boil, skim gnocchi's as they pop to the top of the water and toss in the butter and sage. I cannot wait to make again.

Makes 6 servings if preparing as an entree. Used half the butter (1 cup) and it was still more than enough - I would recommend 3/4 cup. Also, with no microwave, I baked the potatos at 350 for about 40 minutes, but still needed to use the cuisinart to get them smooth enough. Added to the total time, about an hour with a friend helping with the ghnocchi rolling/cutting. Turned out wonderfully, definitely a repeat.
