I picked this recipe specifically to make an extraordinary chocolate dessert to use some beautiful raspberries and hazelnuts that I had. I followed the recipe exactly and what a disappointment! I baked them about 35 mins, just 'til done in the center. They were SO dry, not moist, not fudgey, not chocolaty! They tasted more like a dry chocolate cake than a brownie. There are so many better brownie recipes out there! If you do insist on trying them--I agree with the others--mix the chopped nuts in the batter, sprinkling them on the top looked awful and made them even drier! I cut them with a round cookie cutter, added more seedless raspberry jam and fresh raspberries on top to dress them up for a ladies luncheon. I am known for my baking, but with these I felt I had to give a disclaimer before I served them, and I did not get one compliment--everyone agreed that they were just ok!

I made this recipe for a picnic and it got rave reviews! I personally like softer, more 'gooey' brownies so it worked out great for me. I will with out doubt be making these again.

I thought these were good, but not as good as I'd hoped. The inside brownies were more gooey than those on the edge, and I liked them the most.

I loved the chocolate-raspberry combination. However, I think it would be better if the hazelnut flavor was incorporated in the brownie, rather than just chopped up and sprinkled on top. Next time I will grind the hazelnuts in the processor and mix them into the batter.

This is my favorite brownie recipe of all time. Absolutely fabulous!

It was very good but fairly dry for my tastes. perhaps the pan i used was not big enough but next time will add some veggi oil to make it little more moist. Raspberry and Hazelnut went very good together and had a nice underlying chocolate flavor that wasn't very strong so if your big into chocolate flavor you might want to add more. but overall got good reviews.

Yum! Very tasty indeed!

These were good and cakelike, but do not make them if you want something fudgy and gooey. I liked them but found it necessary to double the amount of jam used. We used seedless jam and it save on time and effort. Our oven runs hot so we only needed to cook them for 20 minutes. I agree with others, don't spread the jam to the edges due to it baking onto the sides of the pan.

These brownies are amazing!! The combination of flavors is really delicious and a nice change of pace. I strained the seeds from the preserves (Trader Joes-loaded with seeds). Needed to bake about 40 minutes, as previous reviewer noted. Tip: don't spread preserves all the way to the edge, they stick like glue to the pan!! Otherwise, a fantastic recipe. You won't have to worry about storing them in an airtight container, they'll be gone in a snap!

This is so good I could finish the whole thing in one sitting. I used Valrhona bittersweet choc so I reduced the sugar from 1 to 3/4 cup only. I have been sustituting olive oil for butter even for baking, so instead of using the whole amount of butter, I used only 1/3 cup butter melted together with the choc and then added 1/4 cup pure olive oil (not extra virgin). I've also done the version using only butter which tastes amazing, but bec I bake this too often, I try to keep the fat down with my butter-olive oil combination. Just as good without the guilt.

Really heavenly...made it twice already. The first time I used 1 1/4 cup hazelnuts & the next time 3/4 cup hazelnuts & 1/2 cupfinely chopped almonds...both were very very good. Wouldn't use cashew nuts tho as that would go better with white chocolate. Hazelnuts with raspberry are like a marriage. Would suggest that one gets a good raspberry preserves (not too watery...the higher the fruit content, the better it is).

Thank you for all of the reviews - increased the cooking time by 10 minutes and the brownies came out perfectly. Otherwise made exactly as indicated. I also want to thank the cook from Hong Kong and the tip for substituting olive oil in baking recipes. I'm going to try that, as the good ones (like this recipe) always have so much butter...

My advice: Follow the recipe exactly, do it often! It produces a silky, moist brownie with a delicate raspberry flavour, exactly what I'd hoped for! I made these yesterday for company who never arrived, but the brownies are long gone anyway (I live with three other people though-still 2.25 each).I'm making them again today and hope the company does arrive because I worked hard to lose my post pregnancy weight but these are IRRESISTABLE!

These brownies are FAB!! I didn't think that straining the seeds from the raspberry jam was necessary, so I didn't, and couldn't even tell they were there. I loved the flavor combination, and moistness of this recipe! The pan was gone in 2 days, enough said!

These were gooey good. I baked them for 20 minutes then brought them to a party - almost too gooey. Will bake them longer next time.

This brownie recipe was excellent and I would definitely make it again. One of the best brownie recipes I've made. I was looking for another Gourmet recipe I used to make with raspberry and couldn't find it so tried these. Highly recommended.

I had to make this recipe 3 days ahead and carry it on the airplane to my parent's 50th Anniversary. The brownies were still wonderful.
