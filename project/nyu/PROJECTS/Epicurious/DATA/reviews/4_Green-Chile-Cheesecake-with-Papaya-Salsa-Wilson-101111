To the person thinking it was awkward with plates and forks - I just serve it with tortilla chips and let everyone dig in. Amazing flavors and a beautiful presentation....a must serve at any special gathering!

I've made this cake mutliple times and so has a friend of ours and everyone we know who has partaken loves it. We like a bit of heat--ok more than a bit--so don't be afraid to up the ante on that front.

I have made this cheesecake over and over through the years but this time decided to write a review. It is the one recipe everyone can agree on: they all love it. I use a mix of fresh roasted chiles and a double batch of salsa. I also halve the recipe usually and make it in a smaller pan. Awesome, easy, and awesome!

I LOVE the flavour of this cheesecake -- it was a definite hit at a New Year's party. I gave it three forks because it's an awkward serve for an appetizer to require plate and fork. Also you do need to substitute the crust with a tortilla chip recipe. But the flavour and texture of this cheesecake is so delish and unique -- try it with an Indian mango chutney -- incredible!

I made this to take to a party and had many requests for the recipe. It was a very tasty savory cheesecake, not at all what people expected from a cheesecake.

Very good and great for serving large crowds. I add a bit of chopped jalapeno's to the filling.

Fabulous!! For those reviewers who said this was like a dip, they didn't cook it long enough. It should cut like a quiche or cheesecake- wedges. Filling: Added sliced green onion and tobasco. I make a blue tortilla chip crust based on other reviews-1 3/4 c. crushed tortilla chips and about 5 T. butter- pressed into springform pan and baked 15 min. Also, thought the salsa was a bit vinegary- I won't use as much vinegar next time (but my mango wasn't quite ripe which may have been the issue) I added a tablespoon or so of juice from some canned peaches and it fixed the problem. Everyone wanted the recipe for this- it's a keep!!!

I made this in a mini cheesecake pan and it was wonderful. My guests loved it and were talking about it for weeks after. I'm making it again for an Easter appetizer. I followed the recipe to the letter, except used mangoes instead of papaya.

This is the second time I've made this recipe, this time I used mango instead of papaya---but only because it was more readily available. I serve it as a dip vs. a cheesecake because both times it was for an appetizer at a party. As nice as it would be to serve and eat as a cheesecake--I don't like appetizers that have to be cut and then eaten with a fork. I just cook it in a shallow pan and serve with tortilla chips. It's been a big hit each time. My only complaint is roasting and peeling the peppers, it's kind of a pain.

this recipe sounded like a lot of fun but i was disappointed with the results. i thought the texture would be more cheesecake-like but it was more dip-like. the salsa, on the other hand, was delicious. i used frozen mixed tropical fruit from trader joes because my papaya wasn't ripe and it worked great.

I took this to a party yesterday, and it was gone within 20 minutes. I used crushed blue tortilla chips mixed with the butter for the crust and a mix of anaheim, poblano and jalepeno peppers in the filling. Next time I would use more jalepenos to give it more heat. I also used mango and added diced avocado and lime juice to the salsa, and it was delicious. I spooned it around the chessecake on a big platter, and it made an eye appealing presentation. A great party dish that I will make again.

I used a mix of sweet and jalapeno peppers to give a bit more complex flavor. Served the salsa on top - absolutely gorgeous. The only big change I would recommend is adding some seasoning to the crust. At least a little salt. It was very bland in comparison to the complexity of the cake and salsa combo.

I will make half of the cheesecake recipe next time. Everyone loved the salsa! I made it with mango instead of papaya.

People LOVE when I make this one. People tell me for days afterward that they crave it.

This savory cheesecake is excellent and if you bake it until it is completely cooked it is a cheesecake-not a dip-and slices beautifully. I did use the blue cornmeal which makes a nice color contrast. I used a combination of Anaheim, poblano and jalapeno peppers in the filling. I also doubled the salsa recipe because I knew it would be popular (which it was). I added a jalapeno to the salsa. If you couldn't find a ripe papaya, I'm sure a mango would work equally well in the salsa. It should be served at room temperature for the best flavor. My guests were very impressed with this unusual cheesecake and I highly recommend it.

This is a good recipe but I definitely suggest the Colorado Collage cookbook Chili Cheescake recipe more. The crust is made of crushed tortilla chips. It has a great zest and flew off the table quicker than this one. The book is from the CO junior league and is amazing.

Each time I make this, it gets rave reviews. I'm ofter asked to make it for special occasions. It's one of the most creative appetizers I've run across.

Great appetizer! Have made this numerous times. It is NOT a dip; it is NOT a casserole. It is a cheesecake and should be made in a springform pan, then unmolded after chilling in the refrigerator.

Excellent flavor and presentation! I strongly disagree with the other reviews, please use the spring form pan. It make the presentation much nicer. I have made this severeal times to great reviews. It is my most requested item to take to a party. I always serve with tortilla chips and use 1 1/2 canned green chilis instead of roasting them myself. As far as the salsa goes, I wouldn't change a thing! I think the others must have had an under ripe papaya. I always try to get mine a few days in advance. The cheesecake can be made days ahead, just do the salsa day of serving.

I used a combo of Anaheim, poblano, and jalapeno chilis. I thought it was really good, but definitely more of a dip than something to eat by the slice. Next time I would leave out the crust and serve it with tortilla chips and maybe bread. The papaya I bought was really awful so I didn't attempt the salsa, next time I may try it substituting mango. Also I cooked it in a cassorole dish and it worked perfect.

Excellent flavor! This savory cheesecake was awesome and received rave reviews. I made it for a dinner party of 10 adults and had plenty to spare. Here's just a couple of things I would do differently the next time; and there will be a next time. I could not find blue corn meal and I tried five different stores. I finally found it at a health food market. If I had known how little difference the blue corn meal had made, I would not have gone to the trouble. Now that I know where to get it, I'll use it again. I would also make double the salsa. It has an awesome flavor and goes great with the cheesecake. A single recipe was just not enough. If you want to make this even easier, forget the springform pan. Because this is a dip, it would have done just as well in a large pie dish or casserole dish. Because I was already late for my get together, I had to remove the spring form before it was completely cooled. It immediately started falling apart. It looked a little funky but still tasted great.

I have made this recipe at least 10 times over the past 3 years and it is always a smash hit. The best thing is that it feeds so many and I've used crackers, crisp vegetables, taco chips, apples and pears as the accompaniments. Jalepenos and lime juice added to the salsa really brighten the taste. Best of all it's so simple.

This was a big success at the office party. Several people have asked for the recipe. I'll definitely make it again. I added a handful of chopped jalapenos for a bit more heat, and it was terrific.

Made this recipe this weekend, it was a hit! I think I will make my own version of the salsa, it needed something more! Great presentation.

I have only made sweet cheesecakes. I saw that a couple of reviewers served this savory cheesecake with crackers. Here's my stupid question. Are savory cheesecakes supposed to be served with crackers like you would a cheeseball?

So yummy! I served the cheesecake whole with the salsa on top. We used tortilla chips. It was a big hit!!!

I have to admit, I haven't made this recipe, but it sounds intriguing. However, when I first read it, I thought it was a sweet cheesecake, not savory. Now that I find out that it isn't, I'm wondering, would it work to have a jalapeno sweet cheesecake? Any thoughts on this? If so, e-mail me! Thanks!

I love to make savory cheesecakes as an appetizer. My favorite recipe is a red pesto one, but saw this and thought I'd try something summery, using a mixed-fresh-fruit salsa. My guests fell in love with this dish from the first glance, and taste confirmed it. I have to stay away from cheesecake -- I can't stay away once I start -- but had to see what the fuss was about. All I can say is, it was well-deserved. OK, I can also say I cannot be trusted alone with this cheesecake.

Wow, this was really great. I served it as an appetizer and everyone loved it. We all agreed that with a nice salad it could have been a meal. It was very rich. The salsa was really good, it would be great served with carnitas or some other roasted pork.

I love any kind of cheesecake! I had just harvested a bunch of peppers so I used a combination of poblano and Anaheim chilies, with a jalapeno for spice. The salsa is outstanding. It is a good foil for the richness of the cheesecake. I think it would also be wonderful with chicken or fish!

This was great. However, I used canned chiles and they were not hot enough.

Awesome. All gone! I used a prepared mango salsa and added some cumin, cilantro, etc to it. Yum. Rave reviews from a fairly sophisticated crowd.

I added pepper jack cheese for extra intensity. I also doubled the salsa. Next time, I will try the canned peppers. Roasting and peeling was messy and time consuming. A HUGE hit at the party I took it to! Many recipe requests!

I made this for a pot luck, it went over well, I would tend to use hotter peppers next time, the italian hot peppers I used did not quite do the job.

Made this for a party and served it with crackers but people ate it by the slice. I'm planning to make two for the next party.
