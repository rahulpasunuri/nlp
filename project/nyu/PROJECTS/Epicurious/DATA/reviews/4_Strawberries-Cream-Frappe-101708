Made this with fresh strawberries from a local farm. For the summer, this would be a perfect recipe as is since you still get small ice chunks in it. For my second batch, I increased the half and half and decreased the ice - perfect for a spring day.

This recipe came out in 1998 and has not been reviewed ???? Even by me! My bad! This is a great summer multi age crowd-pleaser. I just made it for 10 young adults at beach house on a sweltering evening and we had first silence of the trip.Strawberry milkshake without the bother of ice cream.
