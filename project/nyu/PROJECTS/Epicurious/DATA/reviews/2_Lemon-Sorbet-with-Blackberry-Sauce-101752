this recipe was the perfect dessert for my other favorite recipe: KFC chicken -- picked up on the way home from work. Thanks for making me feel like a 'cook' with this recipe... although I spent hours trying to find a good recipe for 'tap water' to go with it.

Sometimes I question the sanity of others. This is a recipe website, where you post recipes. If you are going to make Lemon Sorbet with Blackberry sauce, you make Lemon Sorbet AND blackberry sauce. There isn't even a link to get a recipe for Lemon Sorbet

Barely a recipe for the blackberry sauce and definitely not a recipe at all for sorbet--some of us have posted real lemon sorbet recipes on epi, when you do your search, click on "member recipes" to bring them up.

Just noticed that others shared my sentiments. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. I think most of us are smart enough to figure out that if we don't want to make our sorbets, we can go to a store and BUY them. Duh. But, hey, the web site is free, so no harm, right?

How is this a recipe? "Buy sorbet." This web site continues to deteriorate. What a joke.Wish I could have given it negative four forks.

Wow. Me. Too. I was looking for a recipe for lemon sorbet to serve after my crawfish boil next weekend, and instead a recipe for blackberry sauce. Wasted my time.

Geez, lighten up. For a last minute emergency dessert this was pretty and delicious!

Gee, do you think it is too hard to make? I wanted a RECIPE on how to make lemon sorbet, NOT one that used it. I hope the rest of this site isn't so stupid.

I hit on this while looking for a recipe for Lemon Sorbet. THIS IS NOT A RECIPE! How annoying!

This is stupid; not a recipe. Try making Lemon-buttermilk sorbet, on this site. Easy and great.

This isn't a recipe. It's more like a suggestion. A really obvious suggestion.

I haven't Made this "Recipe", but come on using store bought sorbet and topping with berries I would hardly call this a recipe. Not to mention what does it mean to "unthaw" something isn't that the same as Frozen?

This was delicious and easy for a hot night...I used martini glasses and used lemon sorbet in bottom then raspberry sorbet and put in freezer . When ready for dessert I put the blackberry sauce on and put edible flowers to add some color... very pretty and delicious !!!!

This is so easy and good. It is such a refreshing light dessert. I will make this for the rest of spring and summmer.

I can't say that I prepared this dish, but my sister-in-law did two days ago. It was wonderful -- refreshing, light, hit the spot. We also used the berries the next morning on our waffles -- another winner!
