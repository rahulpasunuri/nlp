Delicious and beautiful. Followed previous cooks, used olive oil to cook chard and cornstarch in sauce instead of butter. The skins burst on the cranberries in about 4 minutes, then is smashed them with spoon, turned out just fine.

Needed a good and quick recipe for some fabulous pork chops in the fridge. Good basic way to cook double chops and the sauce was down right tasty! Paired it with braised kale,braised leeks with lemon and brown rice. Yumm!

SO delicious!! I've made this several times and I don't bother with the swiss chard as it's just average. But the sauce is wonderful - I have started to add a bit of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it. I've tried this on chicken and beef and it's excellent on both as well.

Pretty good recipe. The chard and the pork chops were fantastic, but I did make some changes with the sauce. I didn't have any cranberries, so I used cherry preserves instead. Worked well, but I do have a problem with the thyme as it is written into the recipe. I think next time I will put the thyme in with the shallots right at the beginning instead of waiting until the end so that it is better incorporated into the sauce rather than floating randomly in it.

This wasn't as successful as anticipated. I liked it but my kids didn't. my husband found it just OK. I guess the cranberries just didn't do it for them.

I was very disappointed in this recipe - after reading the reviews I was looking forward to a real knock-out of a pork chop. I cooked it to 155 - too long, you can now cook pork to 145 and be fine; the ingredients in the cranberry sauce sound good, but it was ordinary. I don't think I'll make it again....

Boy did I love this! The only change I made, since it's July and there are no fresh cranberries, was to substitute a mix of 50/50 blueberries and fresh white currants, both of which have the same tart/sweet profile. It was absolutely delicious. In cooking the chard, it gave off that strongly mineral smell that spinach also has, which I really hate. But when combined with the sauce and the pork, the chard was terrific. My only suggestion would be, when adding the butter to the sauce at the very end, consider making a beurre maine instead -- creaming the butter with an equal amount of flour, and stirring that into the simmering sauce in little bits. The sauce was great, but a beurre manie would help it cling better.

I love this recipe. I've made it many times and people are always impressed. The only problem is that the recipe does not mention what temperature to roast the pork chops at. I heat the oven to 350.

Made this for Valentine's Day. Enjoyed the pork chop and and the chard very much, but try as I might, for some reason my cranberries absolutely refused to collapse. I used fresh from the store. I've never had that happen to me before when I've made cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving. I ended up simmering the sauce too long, trying to get the berries to cook down (finally gave up 25 minutes and two supplements of water later). It was still still tasty, but it lost the fresh red color and it was a bit sour biting into whole cranberries. Someday I'll try this again if I work up the courage.

This was easy, quick, and delicious. I had dried cranberries so used a little more wine. No leftovers whatsoever.

This was fabulous; absolutely the best pork chop recipe we've tried by far. We used thick boneless pork-chops and ours looked much nicer than the photo!

The cranberry sauce was very good. Having now made this per the recipe (with one exception), I would make a few changes for health. 1) Saute the swiss chard in olive oil, instead of butter. Leave out the butter in the cranberry sauce and thicken with a little cornstarch and finally, the change I did do, cook the pork chops on the grill (I used the George Forman grill for 4 minutes for perfect tender boneless chops).

Can't go wrong with 113 other cooks in the kitchen. Our pork chops were dry but everything else was perfect. This is a recipe was so much fun and the end result was awesome. We want to try this with a pork tenderloin next time.

Wonderful recipe for pork loin chops! I rubbed cumin and corriander, salt and pepper on thick 1 1/2" chops, then seared them on the stove and put them in a 325 degree oven to finish roasting. I took them out when they reached 155 degrees. I had left over fresh cranberries from the holidays and the trick to avoid a watery sauce (as mentioned in previous reviews) is to cook down the the sauce a little longer than 3 minutes mentioned in the recipe (more like 8-10 minutes on simmer). I did add the 2T of butter and it came out velvety and delicious the way a sauce should be. The presentation was elegant and the taste amazing - even without the swiss chard.

Rating: 1
Usually I agree with reviews for recipes but something must have gone really wrong .... I followed the recipe to a tee but I used thinner chops...I think they were treated somehow because a lot of water came out of them....and it was sort of downhill from there. Seems like I could have used 2 cups of cranberries to make the sauce thicker and with more cranberry flavor. The chard was a lot of effort for the end result....but at least it was relatively healthy.

Whoever made this recipe should be given an award! I used dried cranberries-the orange flavored ones .And I doubled the sauce.

Fantastic pork chop and cranberry sauce. The Red Swiss Chard was just OK. I'd recommend making the Applesauce from the "Gourmet" Pork Chops and Applesauce recipe on this site. The cranberries and applesauce go together so well. I brined my chops for two hours in 1 qt water, 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c kosher salt. Rinsed and sprinkled with pepper (no salt), coriander and cumin and followed the directions in the recipe. I doubled the sauce and it was pretty liquidy but delicious enough to drink! The chops were juicy, probably from the brining. Easy to make and worth making again and again. Good presentation and very suitable for a dinner party.

Made this chard and sauce with a pork tenderloin and it was fantastic. I made the sauce separately since we were grilling the pork and we will definitely have this combo again. The sauce makes the dish and goes really nicely with the chard. I used craisins and onion and added a bit of whole grain mustard. Don't bother chopping the thyme and reduce it to about 1 C.

I was looking for something different to cook up some pork chops I had on hand. Also, we were snowed in, so had to use other ingredients I had on hand. So...I substituted apples for cranberries, and a beef broth/apple juice mixture for the chicken broth and I had to use red onion instead of shallots. It was WONDERFUL! I can't wait to make it as written.

Really lovely recipe. I subbed chicken breast for pork chops and olive oil for butter to lighten it up a bit and make it a bit healthier. I also used a bit less sweetener (honey bc I was out of sugar). Very pretty and the sauce brought a very nice flavor and texture to the chard, which my husband was (for once) not reluctant to eat. The substitutions worked well - it did not seem like anything was missing. I also added quite a bit of pepper and more shallots. The presentation was quite nice. Minus one fork for the original recipe bc of too much butter and because I think it was a bit bland without added pepper and shallots.

This was absolutely delicious. Simple to make yet sophistcated enough to serve for a dinner party. I used dried cranberries, softening them by putting them in water and heating in the microwave for about one minute and letting them rest til needed. PERFECT!

I really like this recipe and I've made it many times. My kids love it too. I recommend using the thinner center cut pork chops and not the thicker boneless ones, it makes a real difference. I also forgot to add the chicken broth one time, and I really did not miss it. Very tasty, very nice presentation, esp. if you have company, and really easy.

I'd give this recipe 3.5 stars. I made this last night and everyone loved it. It's a beautiful dish. In keeping with the autumnal theme, I served baked yams with a jazzed up butter and a hearts of romaine lettuce, toasted pecan and apple salad, which is somewhere on this site, and fantastic. Next time I make this, I might brine the pork the day before and I'd make twice as much chard - it's really tasty! Also, I made the chard about 2 hours earlier, re-heated it, and it was my favorite part of this meal.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and a great way to use up all of the greens I have been getting from my CSA. I used a mixture of red chard, rainbow chard and beet greens because that is what I had in the fridge. I used dried cranberries as I didn't have fresh on hand. I soaked them in the wine as another review suggested. My only suggestion is to prep everything ahead of time and then cook the pork chops and greens at the same time in separate pans. I served this with a thyme polenta which was excellent.

I made this for my wife's Mother's Day dinner, because she enjoys pork chops, and because she LOVES almost any recipe that includes cranberries. Suffice it to say that the dinner was a success; both of us thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I only made two changes: I substituted rainbow chard, because I couldn't find any decent looking Swiss chard anywhere; and I used dried cranberries, since I couldn't find them fresh or frozen this time of year. The rainbow chard was quite attractive, and didn't require any recipe modifications. But I steeped the dried cranberries in some of the warmed wine, which I then strained before I made up the difference and added it to the sauce. Near as I can tell, this worked quite satisfactorily, though I imagine that the fresh/frozen berries would have been tarter. I would have rated this four forks, but I was overly cautious and slightly overcooked the chops, so they weren't as succulent as they might have been. Yeah, I know: my bad, not the recipe's. Oh... I used a nice Argentine malbec both in and with the dish; I though it was a good match.

Rating: 2
Did not like the sauce with shallots and thyme. Or maybe it was the brown sugar...A classic marchand de Vin w/ cranberry would have been better. However, the pork should have been dusted with Flour and Seasoned before cooking. A pad of butter mixed with the oil would have cooked the chops to perfection. I felt the recipe fell short on technique which is the base for good flavor.

Rating: 4
took advise- added cumin/coriander rub to pork. Definitely would DOUBLE sauce. It IS the "4 forks"! I used Costco boneless (fat) chops..took longer to cook. I only had collard greens (not sure WHY?) but they turned out great cooked as the chard. My hubby isn't really excited about pork- HE LOVED THIS recipe. LOVED the sauce! Prep was a little longer using all from scratch. Used FRESH thyme. YUM! A definite RE-do and fun recipe to play with!

Rating: 4
Shockingly simple, and delicious, too. I've made this about a dozen times since the New Year! It's very popular in our household, and the more chard and leafy greens in our diets, the better. Sometimes, I've substituted steak for pork, or just made the greens and sauce as a side dish. Really great recipe!

Rating: 3
Really worth it; but I'm kind of confused as to why they wanted you to seperate the sauce from the pork until the end. I would have liked the pork to soak in the, (really delicious), sauce a little. I used a whole bag of cherries instead of cranberries because they were easier to find but I imagine it worked out just as well. It was the first time I had Red Swiss Chard and I definitely will look for more recipes with that ingredient now.

Excellent, didn't change a thing here. Pork was moist and sauce was extremely flavorful. I did add soy sauce to the swiss chard in place of salt.

Rating: 4
The best thing about this recipe is how easy it is. The sauce is delicious! I used dried thyme and wished that I had fresh thyme on hand, since this is a quick sauce and could use the immediate infusion of herb flavor. Pork chops were easy to make. I actually browned three in one pan (all that could fit) and one in a smaller pan. I then used the drippings from the smaller pan to saute some shallots and garlic (WISHED that I had bacon on hand!) and saute some cut up kale. I added 3/4 cup water after it was softened and let them steam off until the kale was tender. The flavor combo of kale, cranberry sauce and pork was awesome. It literally took 25 minutes to cook the entire meal.

I have been planning to make this recipie for some time now; I'm so glad I did! Had top loin chops from Costco, so they took a little longer, and with high humidity here in Honolulu, decided I would prefer just to do stove top, so took a little longer to cook, but the rainbow chard I had from local farmer's market was so tender, it took less time, and all equaled out. Cranberry/red wine sauce was wonderful. Served over instant brown rice with a cab sauv to drink. Very good! Would not hesistate to serve to guests; such a pretty presentation and very seasonal.

Yum! Made the chops alongside roasted butternut squash drizzled with balsamic vinegar and sauteed spinach. Perfect pairing. I did use dried thyme because I had no fresh on hand; I found it a little strong in the sauce. Try to use fresh if possible.

Until I made this recipe I never really loved pork chops. They were never on my list of meats to cook. Then I discovered this recipe. All I can say is the cranberry sauce is yummy! I used spinach the first time I made the dish and, since I didn't have 1 1/4 in. thick pork chops, I cooked the pork chops in a frying pan until they were cooked through. I made the dish last week and then, yesterday, I made the pork chops and sauce again. Now pork chops are a meal I will looks forward to making quite often all because of the cranberry sauce.

This dish is very tasty and easy to make. The only changes I made was that I used cabbage and boneless chops. The sauce is delicious and added nicely to the somewhat bland cabbage. Be cautious of the times mentioned for sauteeing and cooking. My boneless chops were pretty thick yet cooked just perfect at the least amount of time specified; 7 minutes. Would definitely make again!

You can also prepare the pork chops without the cranberries but try adding a handful of dried cranberries (craisins) to the chard toward the end cooking. also, a few toasted pine nuts is a nice addition to the chard and dried cranberries.

To the cook from SF who couldn't find good pork chops: I highly recommend heritage pork chops from Bi-Rite on 18th in SF. They're amazing, completely unlike "regular" pork chops from the grocery store.

I couldn't find good pork chops, so I used lamb shoulder chops. Couldn't find cranberries, so I used thawed frozen cherries. Though a different meat-sauce combo from the one intended in this recipe, it was delicious and went very well with the chard. I loved the crunchiness of the chard ribs -- be sure not to overcook them.

A delicious, elegant, one dish meal. I made the recipe exactly as written except I halved the swiss chard as I was only making it for 2 people. I made the entire recipe of sauce, though, and we used all of it. The presentation on the plate is very pretty with the combination of colors: looks like something from a fancy restaurant! My husband declared the chops were cooked to perfection. I was a little leery as 155F is a low temp. for pork, but it must have continued cooking under the foil as the end result was marvelous.

Made this for Christmas Day with porkloin for finky family. My Grandmother finished her whole plate! I was so pleased. Uncle was hesitant about the sauce - he hadn't had fresh cranberries before. He devoured it. I LOVED the chard. We made this with celeryroot apple mash - what a surprise to those who thought it was potato. A HIT!

This was the first time I've cooked with either swiss chard or cranberries. Neither has ever appealed to me. But this recipe has made me an instant fan of both. I followed the recipe exactly (although my pork chops never hit 155 and they were plenty ready) and it came out brilliantly. Besides the taste, it simply looked gorgeous on the plate, so festive and fitting for the season.

I was looking for a way to use the chard I recently picked up and this sounded good. The only change I made was to chop some bacon and brown, removed the bacon, sauteed the shallots and garlic in the bacon drippings. This added a wonderful yet subtle flavor to the chard. Otherwise followed all the directions exactly and was very pleased with the outcome. We will serve this again for ourselves and for company. It was a very pretty, festive, and delicious dish.

Wicked Awesome Dish!!! Sorry for the Boston talk, but this dish was incredible. Made it on the first time I cooked for my best friends in-laws, they were blown away. Asked me if I would cook the cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving! So I substituted rainbow chard for red, and served the dish with Jasmine rice. Caesar salad with homemade dressing and fresh sourdough rocked everything to perfection. Served the Caeser with a "Clos Du Bois" Pinot Grigio, and the pork with "Pepperwood Grove" Zinfandel. Amazing meal.

I have made this recipe several times and both my husban and I love it. I have used swiss chard, kale, beet greens and they each work equally well. When cooking the chard I use red onion in place of the shallots and add garlic and a touch of honey when cooking them. And I don't include the stems, I think its better without them. This dish is easy and very, very tastey.

This was an amazing dish! I've already made it twice. I was given some home grown chard. I searched your site to find a good way to prepare it and came across this recipe. I made it that night for my husband and he loved it. Then I made it for my parents when they came to visit and my dad, whom you can rarely elicit a response from, declared that he could just eat the sauce over rice. They loved it too. I did substitute the cranberries for frozen cherries that I had in my freezer. It worked just fine. This will become a dish that we will share with friends and family over and over.

Fantastic! The most difficult/time-consuming part was removing the ribs of the greens. Other than that, it was one of the easiest "gourmet" dishes that I've made. More often than I care to admit, when I cook I don't have all of the ingredients that I need, so I have to make substitutions. I had kale instead of chard, threw in a bit of onion along with the shallot, and had boneless, butterflied pork chops. Obviously the cooking time for the chops was shorter, but I treated everything else the same, and it was still delicious! Imagine how good it would be if I actually had all of the components that the recipe called for... :-)

This was my first attempt at making a gourmet meal for my husband (who is the chef in our house). It was very simple to follow for a novice like me and after the results I would be a 100% confident of trying it again. The most exciting part of this was neither us had a clue as to how it would actually taste. So it was a pleasant surprise altogether! The sauce was great. I also roasted Buttercream spuds and sweet corn. So our entire meal was sweet. It wasn't too bad... but next time... probably stick with russet spuds and another veggie choice. Do not want to try to compete with the sweetness of the sauce.

This is an excellent recipe - simplistic but sophisticated. Used all my shallots cooking the chard so I subed sweet white onion for the sauce with no compromise to the flavor. The pork chops took a little longer than the recipe reccommends. I would cover them the last half of the oven cooking time to avoid dryness. I served the pork over wild rice and stemmed haricot vert for the side dish. Garnished with fresh pomagranate seeds and sage - delish. Definately a re-do!

I've made this dish twice now and think it's wonderfully delicious and very easy. Served it with long grain and wild rice. Be sure to give the shallots a whiz in the food processor, otherwise it's a lot of tears and mincing. But-- really yummy! And pretty to look at too. If you are looking for a Christmas dish with red and green and wonderful rotund winter flavors this is a good bet. I'm thinking next time I will serve a fresh orange and olive salad after the main course and have raspberry truffle brownies for dessert. Very special!

I made this dish for the second time last night. (Liked it so much the first time, just had to do it again...unusual, as I like to try different recipes all the time.) Used kale since the grocer was out of chard. As I was preparing the dish, my heart sank when my boyfriend told me he didn't like kale. But, once he tasted it, he couldn't say enough good things about it! Pork was very tender, combination of flavors is unique and delicious. I think this makes a nice presentation around Christmas - as long as you don't cook the cranberries so long that they turn to mush. Put greens around edge of platter, with chops in center. Spoon cranberries on greens to look like a wreath. Pour remaining sauce over chops.

I have yet to try this but may tonite, I must say I am most amused by all the controversy "Oliver ClothesOff" has started.. don't you realize he probably didn't even make this recipe he is just some kid messing around on the PC just to pull pranks. Don't spend any more time being angry at him he's just getting a bunch of laughs out of it, and probably succeeding in his attempt to irritate you. I think his made up name is pretty funny actually -low humor but amusing nonetheless. Anyway Oliver, you need to find another place to be funny, we are much too serious about food for that nonsense here! Try a yahoo group.

For me, it's tougher to make pork interesting without the aid of a great, flavorful sauce. Beef is another story. The cranberry sauce was perfect! Just sweet enough, yet tart enough to take you in a few differt directions at once, without confusing the palate. Definitely a keeper in my book.

Mr. "Clothesoff" Those of us on this site take our food seriously, most of the time anyway. You obviously have nothing better to do with YOUR time. Anyway.....I'm trying this dish tonight because the other legitimate reviews were so good.

You know that the reviewer below did not make or eat this dish. Don't trust him, trust me--it was excellent. I followed it exactly, with fresh cranberries, and it was like something out of a restaurant. Very impressive. A little bit labor intensive, but worth it.

Followed the recipe exactly and used dried cranberries instead of fresh. Delicious! My picky child asked for more chard! Everyone loved this recipe.

I made this last night for company and everyone loved it! I served it with polenta--the colors were gorgeous. I would definitely make this again. Oh, I added a dash of nutmeg to the swiss chard.

I had never made anything with swiss chard before and was a bit intimidated by the recipe but everything turned out very nicely and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and did not change anything.

This is a crowd pleaser - don't be afraid to entertain with this one! I passed it along to neighbor and they loved it too! My husband is a meat critic and went crazy over this! Serve with a nice bottle of wine on a romantic evening!

Excellent recipe,easy to make. The second time I prepared it I replaced pork chops by pork filet and reduced chicken broth to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 of port. I also reduced brown sugar to 2 tbsp. The results were pleasing as they were no left-overs

This is a lovely combination of flavors. Used dried cranberries, re-constitited in red wine; and fresh red, yellow and green chard from the garden. (Originally planted for ornamental purposes.) Great with mashed potatoes.

I made this dish last night (a weeknight), and it was very good. The sauce was not too sweet, which was good, and the chard was delicious. I've never had swiss chard before, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out. I'll definately be making this dish again.

To my memory I had never tasted swiss chard. I bought a combo bunch of red, yellow and green at the farmers market and was looking in here to learn how to cook them. The cranberries caught my eye. I had purchased dried cranberries from a bin several years ago and decided to use them with pork chops. It was apple season so I pan seared/roasted the chops and removed them to keep warm. In the same pan I scraped up the tasty bits from the pan and added shallots, whole smashed garlic, thyme and about a cup of dry white wine. I threw in a handful of the dried cranberries while the wine reduced by half. At that point I removed the garlic and added some sliced apples and some butter. As soon as the butter incorporated and the apples were warmed through but still crisp, I poured all over the pork chops. It tasted so good it has become a regular at our house. I read all your reviews before I tried this recipe and it seemed that the bitterness of fresh/frozen cranberries was the only problem. I implemented this recipe by omitting the brown sugar and adding sweet dried cranberries instead of fresh/frozen and we loved it! By the way, the swiss chard was wonderful as well!

The combination of flavors in the sauce and chard were amazing. The sauce really highlights the pork while the chard made for a great foundation. Make this recipe for a dinner party!

This was one of the tastiest pork recipes I've tried. I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the cranberries until they were completely cooked to prevent biting into a sour berry. I used boneless pork chops. Outstanding!

Easy to make. Followed the recipe as is. Sauce to die for. It has that restaurant gourmet taste that impresses. The chops come out crispy on the outside yet moist on the inside. Highly recommended!

I made this dish and my girlfriend loved it, the colors blend well together and the flavors are excellent. I made the chops on the stovetop and they turned out excellent! I would recommend this dish for everyone.

This is an excellent dish that I have made twice already. The swiss chard is delicious and goes well with the cranberry sauce. I freeze extra cranberries left over at Thanksgiving so I can make this dish later. The pork comes out moist and overall it is an easy dish to make. The only real labor involved is chopping up the swiss chard but this can be done ahead of time. Very Good!

I couldn't make this according to the recipe because cranberries are out of season right now, at least for me. I used defrosted frozen rasberries instead, and it came out good. I also used red onion in addition to the shallots and garlic. Overall it was very tasty. The swiss chard was a nice change from the usual vegetables. I made it with wild rice, which was a nice side dish. The pork didn't yield much fat after taking it out of the oven, so I added more olive oil to make the sauce. Therefore, I don't see any reason to wait for the chard to cook before preparing the pork, or the pork to cook before preparing the sauce. You can do them all at the same time, and therefore save time. BTW, if you don't have an ovenproof pan, simply transport the pork into a baking dish from the frying pan. It does come out better finishing in the oven, I think.

I thought this was great--made it exactly as is, except I used port instead of plain red wine. I have to say, though, that next time I'll let my cranberries cook down much longer than the ones in the accompanying picture (which still have a berry-like shape to them), as the whole berries were way too tart in the sauce, and my husband and I ended up picking them out. But a great blending of flavors--wonderfully garlicky chard, and great with mashed potatoes in the winter!

Didn't care for the sauce. I guess I was looking for something sweeter...it was strong, but not exactly sweet. I tasted too much of the thyme in it. I would omit the thyme altogether, I think.

Great recipe to make on the fly. In order to save time, I undercooked the swiss chard and left it covered to finish steaming in my wok.

Delicious! The sauce was wonderful, and the swiss chard went with it well. It was surprisingly easy to prepare. I pan-fried the pork chops instead since I don't have an oven-proof skillet.

This was absolutely delicious....the sauce was fabulous. Would work equally well with a pork tenderloin.

This was an absolutely wonderful dish. The sauce was very flavorful and went perfectly with the garlic mashed potatoes I served on the side. It was easy to prepare, and the red and green colors of the cranberries and the swiss chard make it a perfect dish for the holiday season!

It's labor intensive but we'd make this dish again. It tastes good and presents beautifully. Caution: don't use oversized pork chops; they overwhelm the lovely accompaniments

I found this dish easy to prepare and delicious. Raves from both my husband, and dinner guests. A great meal !

This was a great pork dish. The color combination made for a very attractive plate. The bitter taste of the swiss chard was complemented by the sweetness of the sauce. A real winner.
