I haven't made this yet, but it looks delicious. Instead of the potato rolls, I will be using the slider buns. I will also be scooping out some of the bread inside to create more room for the shrimp salad.

This recipe does not make more then 15 stuffed rolls. The family really loved it.

Wonderful recipe. I wouldn't change a thing about it. The shrimp salad by itself is delicious. The potato rolls, though, bring it all together. This is a great appetizer and was a hit at a recent get-together.

not a very good recipe, the flavors were not very good and the roll dominated

Meh. The shrimp salad itself is very good, it just needs a different vehicle. WAY too much bread and I used the exact potato bread buns recommended. I know they are just shrimp rolls, but the presentation is kind of terrible. It looks like kid food at picnic.
