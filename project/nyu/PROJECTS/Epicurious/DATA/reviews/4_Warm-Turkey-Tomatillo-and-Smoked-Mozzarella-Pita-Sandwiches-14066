this came out a little dry and kinda low on flavor, if I made it again I would not use smoked mozz.

Very tasty and easy! I used whole wheat pita and jack instead of mozz (it's what I had) and served it with slices of avocado. The sauce is easy to make and worth it. Yum!

I thought this was really great. I used some leftover smoked turkey drumstick meat (from my own backyard smoker - yum!) and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I might use a bit more jalapeno - we like spicy and this was very tasty but we wanted a bit more heat. My husband declared it a "keeper."

What a wonderfully tasty sandwich, resembling a deli specialty offering. I used muenster. smoked turkey dark meat, and a hot green salsa. The combination of roasted red peppers, melted cheese, cilantro and salsa rules! Next time I would wrap the sandiwiches in foil so the pita does not get crispy.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe for using up leftover Thanksgiving turkey (and I think would be great with regular sandwich turkey from the deli too). Our turkey was smoked this year so I used meunster cheese instead of the smoked mozzarella. Everything else I did as called for in the recipe and was very happy with the outcome. While the ready-made salsa idea makes a lot of sense, the tomatillo concoction really doesn't take that much extra time so don't be afraid to try it. Also, don't forget that another word for coriander is cilantro...! (I always forget!)

Really great, quick, sandwich, with lots of flavor! Per another reviewer's suggestion, I also used bottled salsa (Herdez Brand Mild Green Salsa) to cut down on prep time. Also, I substituted poached, shredded chicken breast from last night's dinner for the turkey.

Although I think it might be a good idea to sprinkle some salt and pepper on the turkey as you are assembling the sandwich, my husband loved it as is and said he wouldn't change a thing.

Instead of the tomatillo puree, I used a tomatillo salsa that I had in the fridge. The only different ingrediant was serrano chile instead of the jalepeno that this recipe called for. It saved me some work and worked fine. Instead of mozzarella, I used some cheddar and jack cheese leftover from another meal and it worked fine. This recipe is very versatile! I added some sliced tomatoes and slice red onions before serving. My boyfriend loved it and we will be making it again, perhaps this time as the recipe says! The puree and the cilantro make this so tasty!
