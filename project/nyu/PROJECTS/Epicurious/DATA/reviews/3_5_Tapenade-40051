I have only read about tapenade before trying this recipe after recieving a gift of a large amount of olives. This recipe is delicious and simple. I was going to use it as an ingredient in another recipe but we couldn't stop eating it over crackers and crusty bread! Again...delicious.

Each element in the tapenade came through. I too made it in the food processor, allowing it a bit of coarseness. It looked, felt, and tasted somewhat like caviar! I've got loads of the stuff left...I think I'll spread it on a pork roast and marinate it before cooking.

There are a number of tapenade recipes on this site, but this is the classic. I must admit I add a clove of garlic, but we prefer it without the addition of herbs or brandy.

Due to time constraints I used a food processor and made this at the last minute before a dinner party. Absolutely fabulous and addictive and can't wait to eat it again.

The beauty of classic recipes is the simplicity and the ease of making it your own by not measuring but by taste and feel. I love making tapenade because it tastes just a little different each time.
