I am hitting the delete button on this one. Tangerine to strong, and very bland.

The dishes are done, and I am still wondering why this dish had no body. After I had made it as prepared, and found it to be very bland, I added two more cloves of garlic, and another teaspoon of fresh ginger. I increased the spice using red pepper flakes. My only thought is that maybe I did not drain the marinade sufficiently prior to sauteing the chicken. Any thoughts?

Not sure where the "sweet and sour" comes into this recipe. It was pretty bland so I added more soy and more cayenne to kick it up but it was still only a so-so recipe. I used broccoli instead of snow peas and also added baby ears of corn. The only redeaming factor is that it is a quick and easy recipe.

This was a great recipe for the post-holiday season. Quick, light, delicious. I made two changes based on ingredients on hand -- used clementines instead of tangerines and half tsp of ground ginger for the fresh. I also threw in some left over steamed broccoli, which my husband said made the dish. Sauce was great. Next time I would use just a touch more cayenne.

This is good, but nothing really special. "Like kissing your sister," my husband says.

Okay, so maybe it's my changes that caused this to turn out so poorly--so let this review serve as warning: do NOT use a wok instead of a pan, and do NOT substitute cognac for sherry (I know, I know, I discovered last minute I was OUT)--resulted in a poor dish that called for a lot of prep work. Dear Husband says "skip it."

I doubled the amount of vegetables, as another reviewer suggested, but also doubled the sauce amount. We like lots of sauce with our rice, and this was really tasty. I also used Odwalla juice as someone else suggested, as tangerines are really expensive right now. Saved a lot of work not having to juice tangerines. I'll be making this again soon!

We substitued orange peel for tangerine peel in a pinch, still tasted good. Served it over rice. Make sure to chop the chicken into small chunks for stir-frying. Good, but not great, for the effort.

Very good recipe. Only suggestion would be to double the vegetable amounts, would have liked more of them. A nice alternative to the standard fried version at restaurants.

tasty tasty! the tangerine gives this dish a really nice flavor. I spiced it up a notch and the sweet/spicy flavor combination worked well.

the store was out of snowpea pods, so i substituted broccoli florets, but everything else was according to recipe. i, too, found the sauce too thick, so i added some water to thin it out. i think next time i'll make it with shrimp and some extra cayenne. it lacked punch in my opinion, although my husband thought it was lovely.

Used regular dry sherry and pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Was delicious - not overly sweet, not overly sour - just right! Also very quick and easy, once you've marinated. A Belgian dubbel beer (dark and sweet) went very well with it. You can add extra snow peas (I added 100 g). I served it with rice and a vegetable side dish.

After reading the previous comments about this recipe I made a few alterations in it and was extremely happy with the results. Instead of using a microplane to grate the tangerine peel I used a zester. This gives much longer strips of peel that you can either mince finer or leave long. I also think this cuts down on the bitterness that can come from the peel. Odwalla Juices makes Tangerine Juice so I used that instead of trying to juice the tangerines and deal with a multitude of seeds. I also ended up using 1/4 cup more (3/4 cup total) of the Tangerine Juice because I thought the sauce was too thick. Instead of cream sherry, I used plain old sherry. And in place of cayenne I used a scant 1/4 tsp. of chili flakes, which provided a nice gentle heat without being overpowering. I also increase the amount of snow peas to about a 1/2 pound. The last change I made was the biggest. Not being in the mood for chicken I substituted shrimp, 1 pound of peeled and devined medium (21/26 count). This recipe is really good with shrimp. Neither the sauce nor the shrimp were overwhelmed by tangerine flavor, but the citrus flavor was clearly there. Okay, so I guess I made quite a few changes :-), but the basic structure of this recipe is sound.

I enjoyed this recipe. I ommited the tangerine peel because it took too long. I didn't have fresh ginger so I added dry ginger. Served over rice, it was delicious. Pat. Oakville, Ontario. Canada.

This is a great basic recipe to tweak toward your own personal tastes. I added a fresh, diced jalapeno for kick, and added fish sauce and chicken stock to balance the sweet and salty. Reduced the sauce, added veggies I had on hand, and it turned out great. Oh, and added a little cumin to the mix--but that's just personal preference.

This is the easiest, tastiest receipt i have ever tried and i would do it all over again. Sonia

The citrus flavor was overpowering at first taste but it blended later. Dish made a beautiful presentation. It is not a meal you would anticipate making, and rush to buy ingredients for. We will problably make it again sometime, but I believe you need a very rich food to have a citrus sauce.

A nice easy stir-fry with a fresher taste than any carry-out. I had all the ingredients on hand except for pea-pods so I substituted broccoli and that worked great. Also used a teaspoon on chili-garlic sauce instead of the cayenne. Will make this one again.

I thought the tangerine peel gave the recipe too strong a flavor. Otherwise, I found it to be a bland dish.

This is a very tasty rendition of a classic sweet and sour dish. Due to the nice blending of the tangerine flavor and the cayenne, even my most picky child ate it. This is a keeper!

I made this for the second time last night, and it still tastes great. The cayenne pepper adds a kick to it, and all the flavors work well together. The tangerine doesn't over power the sauce, and I place all of the stir-fry on a bed of white rice.

Great quick recipe. Just enough spice and taste. The dish is colorful. A great mixture of fruit and vegatables.
