I did this with baby summer squash and carrots. It was pretty good.

Very tasty side dish. I have a few suggestions for those having trouble with the dish. 1. Sweat your vegetables before sauteing. Simply toss with a teaspoon or two of table salt and set in a colander with a paper towel under it to catch the moisture for about a half hour to 40 minutes before cooking.(This is also a great way to firm up your eggplant recipes.) When doing this just be careful seasoning the dish when you are finishing. 2. Use a balsamic glaze instead of vinegar. This is available at most decent markets. I also used about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to kick it up a bit. A very nice side for a change of pace.

This turned out really wet for me. There was a lot of water from the veggies - too much to reduce. I should have drained that before adding the vinigar. Flavor was mild, but good.

Hm. I don't know what I did wrong. It was too sour and "vinegary" so I added some sugar. Edible, not great. My balsamic vinegar the culprit? I've used it to roast mushrooms before that were great. I don't know what happened...

Would be much better with a small bunch of fresh herbs, a bit more balsamic vinegar and olive oil, and definitely roasted.

I did as many suggested and roaseted the vegetables with the mixed oil and vinager. I roasted them 20 minutes at 350 degrees and stirred once or twice. It is easy, pretty and very tasty.

I made this for 2 dinner parties and it was an easy way to get all your vegetables made in one go. I used eggplant in place of summer squash (as I'm not sure what that is) and it worked very well. I may try roasting instead of sauteeing next time.

Others thought it was better than I did. Added a lot of s&p and savory. Could use even more seasoning. Cooked veggies longer and used a red and white onion

Tried this with baby carrots in place of the zucchini and summer squash. Everyone loved it.

I also roasted the vegetables and everyone thought they were excellent as an accompaniment to the Tuscan-Style Pork Roast.

I also roasted the vegetables, adding chicken pieces and potatoes for a wonderful one-pan meal. I had to double the amounts of vinegar and increase the oil by half (because the chicken adds some fat). My husband, who generally doesn't like zucchini, loved it this way and raved about the dish.

I wish I would have taken a previous suggestion and roasted these veggies. I loved the vinegar, just not cooked this way. I will try it again, but only roasted, and that would really be a different recipe.

I used a previous reviewer's idea of roasting the veggies in the oven, and they turned out great.

Made this as indicated but added carrots and used a purple onion for a great colorful side dish. Great flavor and easy to make!

An easier variation: We mix the olive oil and balsamic vinegar with about 1/2 tsp of dried herbs, toss the vegetables in the mixture, and roast the whole batch on a non-stick cookie sheet for 20 minutes or so.

Sounds like an echo! Great, easy recipe. Takes a little bit more cooking time on the zuccini.

Great tasting, easy to prepare, a great compliment to the paneed red snapper we had for dinner. We will definitely have this again, and soon.
