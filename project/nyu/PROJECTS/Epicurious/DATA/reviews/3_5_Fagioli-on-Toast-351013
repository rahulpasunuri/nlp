This is great for such a simple recipe. It's not mind-blowing or anything, but very satisfying and nutritious and budget-conscious to boot. We'll definitely make it again. My husband LOVED it.

I loved this recipe because it was so simple and quick. I let it stand for several hours before serving to let the flavors mature. I will make this often for an easy, healthy weeknight meal.

So, this was pretty average, why not just use stewed tomatoes for a little more flavor. I added spinach, basil, red wine and red pepper flakes after sampling the recipe as written. My 2 day old garlic bread added the most flavor. If you love tomatoe sauce you will probably like this.

Incredibly easy and quite delicious. I added a handful of red pepper flakes and garlic on the toasts. Probably the easiest meal I've throw together in ages.
