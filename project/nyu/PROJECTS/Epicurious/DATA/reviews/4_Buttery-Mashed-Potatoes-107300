We had Yukon Gold potatoes on hand, so used those instead and peeled them before they were put in the microwave, and used 1% rather than whole milk. Very good and would make again!!!

Wonderful with the shepherd's pie ... added a bay leaf and a few garlic cloves to the potato water. To the mashed potatoes I added about 1 cup shredded white Irish cheddar cheese ... truly delicious!

I put my potatoes in a plastic bag before putting them in the microwave. Plain bag, not zip lock, and just twist and tuck the end under the potatoes. This keeps the moisture in. And 16 minutes sounds way too long! I start with two minutes more than the number of large size potatoes, then check them for softness. May need 2-4 minutes longer. Also, no need to cut and scoop. I stick a fork in the whole potato, just enough to pick it up, then peel it like an apple. The skin comes right off like an egg shell. Do this over a bowl and hold the fork upright so the potato doesn't fall off. Might want to heat the butter and milk before adding to potatoes to keep them warm.

I love this recipe because it's so simple, but I have to go make it complex, changing the sour cream for low fat plain yougurt, adding garlic sauteed in olive oil, asiago cheese and rosemary. Delicious!
