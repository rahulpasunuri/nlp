This was very different and delicious! Turns out raw artichokes are quite edible, although I confess to doing some research on the web before committing. Thanks to the other reviewers for persuading me to try it. I'm also going to try some of the suggested variations with mushrooms etc.

Raw artichoke is not edible. It is just too bitter. Fennel, parmesan and olive oil are great together.

In the interests of time, I used jarred artichokes rather than fresh. In retrospect, this was a mistake. I missed the stalk portion of the heart, and had to toss out (well, Ok, ate) large amounts of tender artichoke leaves. Overall, I'd say the salad was good but not as good as I expected. In the future I'd mix the oil before hand; toss each layer in oil, salt and pepper, and lemon in that order; and salt and pepper more. I was surprised that the fennel didn't taste as strongly as I expected, but this may be because I had to transport the prepared ingredients before using them. Also, I used black truffle oil rather than white. Not having had white in the past, I'm not sure how this would have affected the dish.

i was really skeptical of this salad.. i wondered how such few ingredients could be good, and on top of that, the fennel worried me as it is such a strong flavored vegetable. i was very pleasantly surprised to taste a delicious and fresh salad. i thinly sliced cremini mushrooms instead of the artichokes. this salad is superb.. i used a mandolin and the strongness of the fennel was gone. please try this.. it's a fantastic spring salad!

Simple and sublime. [It brings me back to Chez Panisse.]

Wow for a salad! It seems quite simple but the results were stunning for a dinner party. Didn't use the artichoke but the other vegetables suggested and put the layered veg on a bed of mesclun. A nice way to use precious truffle oil. Followed another rater's suggestion of using less lemon and fleur de sel. I'm making all my dinner party salads like this!!

An almost identical version of this salad was on the TV Food network some time ago. I have made the salad many times, it is fresh and crisp, and one of my favorites. It's great especially if you like fennel. The only difference is that I add arugula, like the recipe I saw on TV.

Wow! I enjoyed a similar salad at Serafina in NYC and this was just as good. I added very thinly sliced button mushrooms and chopped frisee and a sprinkling of fleur de sel and cracked black pepper. It was superb!!

If you like fennel, and even if you don't, you have to make this salad. I was whisked off to Italy with every bite. If artichoke's are out of season, make this dish with fennel and fresh, tight, white mushrooms, it's just as good. Few quick tips: First, you really must use a mandoline. Everything must be sliced very, very thinly. Second, be sure to remove any tough outside "leaves" from the fennel AND any tough core. Third, go easy on the lemon juice. Fourth, I like a little pinch of kosher salt and a grind of fresh black pepper between each layer. Fourth, be sure to use an excellent quality olive oil and the best parmesean you can buy. And finally, be sure to make this dish at the last possible moment. Can't wait to try it with pears and serve after the main course.
