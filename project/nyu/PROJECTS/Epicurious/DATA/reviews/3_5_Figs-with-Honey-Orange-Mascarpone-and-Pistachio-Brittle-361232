Orange blossom honey? Must it be? That's ridiculous!

This is one of the best and easiest desserts I've ever made. Well I did have trouble with my first batch of pistachio brittle seizing up, but smooth sailing on my next batch. I served this as the end to a dinner party about a year ago and the guests still talk about it. I had quite a bit of leftover honey-orange mascarpone, which was delicious, and I put it to good use spread on pumpkin bread. Now I make the two together on purpose. Great recipe!

All of the individual parts are very tasty (the mascarpone mixture, the pistachio brittle, and the ripe figs) but all together they are too sweet, and not well-matched. I would not make this again. The mascarpone mixture might be really good drizzled on angel food cake with some fresh berries.

Made 40 of these for an appetizer reception at a foreign consulate in SF - huge hit! The pistachio brittle doesn't yield a whole lot - more like candy-coated nuts that you need to chop (not a wedge like peanut brittle). Delicious none the less.

This is delightful. I tried it during ripe fig season, when I was looking for more ways to use lovely ripe black mission figs. You can substitute a little softened cream cheese for the mascarpone. You'll want to find more uses for the pistachio brittle, too.
