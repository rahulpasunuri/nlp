Incredibly simple and delicious! My husband called it "awesome". I love the fact that the beans can be put to two different uses. Since I do not use alcohol I replaced the sherry with 1/2 water and 1/2 red wine vinegar (I have found this seems to work well in many recipes that call for wine, but sometimes I will use less vinegar depending on the recipe). I used tamari soy sauce and replaced the balsamic vinegar by a store-bought balsamic glaze that I happen to have (I have run out of the vinegar itself). I used the full two tablespoons and at first felt I had over-seasoned the beans, but after letting them sit as recommended the flavour seemed to have mellowed. I pureed the soup and did not add anything else but some lime juice, and it was just right!

I started with dry black beans. I cut up one onion and added 3 Tablespoons of Olive Oil, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar. I took out the bay leaf and onion prior to blending. The soup needed a touch of sweetness so I added a 1/4 tsp of sugar. It was really good at the end.

We love this soup, even my 13 year old who is very picky. I used the Kemp's Black Beans as a base and used medium (amontillado) sherry rather than sweet. Went on the heavy side of the seasonings in both basic beans and soup recipes. I have made it several times fand am about to again.

I thought this soup recipe was bland. As a caveat I did not use the underlying recipe for black beans, but another recipe I like. This soup needs more zip and flavor...I had to add more sherry, salt, and added some belizean hot sauce for extra flavor. With the additions it was four forks, without them, a very boring soup.

I loved the combination of the lime, sherry, and black beans!
