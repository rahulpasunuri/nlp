Made this a day ahead and refrigerated. Cooked as directed and it was perfect. I had never worked with phyllo dough before and had absolutely no problems following the directions. I got "Athens" brand phyllo and had it refrigerated for a day before I used it- don't know if this makes a difference.

A lot of work - and every bit worth it! MAde it when it first came out and still love it.

Quite a bit of work for an less than exciting result. Husband was non-plussed as well. Tip: cut all the vegetables ahead before you begin cooking. Since it's difficult to measure cubed vegetables, I used roughly just under 1 lb per each vegetable.

How could you not love this- very elegant and delicious-I've made it various times and it's always a hit- I also like that you can make it ahead of time- a real time saver when you are having company-

The title intrigued me, the recipe as well. Looked great, felt the results were mediocre. Had an abundant butternut squash crop this year, was hoping to use this recipe to use them up, but a lot of work and the taste was not all that memorable, good, but not great.

Wonderful Suprise. I Got a lot of questions on "HOW DID I DO IT". Have you ever heard of a butternut squash with orange pudding recipe?

Is well worth the extra effort of making the individual parcels- I had people asking if they could take extras home!
