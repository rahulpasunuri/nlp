These worked out really well for me - I decided I wanted to make a Moroccan meal just 2 weeks before and didn't have time to preserve for a month. I'd never preserved them before, so maybe they're not as good as the real thing, but I got such raves about the zucchini & honey & preserved lemon recipe I made that I find it hard to believe...I'll try the long one next time, but will keep this in my back pocket in case I want preserved lemons on short(ish) notice again.

Awesome. This is my first preserved lemon - I used Meyer lemons. They are really really GREAT and I used this recipe rather than one that used a lot of spices so the spices could be optional later. I just made a chicken tagine which really benefitted from them. I'm happy.

I've made a very similar version of this recipe from a Patrica Wells cookbook a few times, and it works well. (I use kosher salt, by the way.) The latest batch gave me a shock,though: when I opened the glass jar lid, it opened with a little violence, and I'm sure some gas escaped. The lemons smell delicious, but I worry what the accumulated gas might mean: could this be a sign of botulism, or just something benign?

I've used this recipe for years w/ good results. Use Meyer lemons = thin skinned, very tasty &juicy. Thick skin lemons= bitterness,due to their high amount of pith. Toss well w/ salt, shake off some salt, transfer to clean glass, cover with juice, close tightly, then put in fridge for a week or more.

i'm curious to know if any of you who have made this recipe found any bitterness in the lemons. i see that most everyone is not happy with how this recipe turned out. does anyone know of a better recipe he/she might like to share?

This recipe just does not work. Some things cannot be hurried, and preserved lemons are one of them. These need to sit, much more heavily salted, at room temp in a glass jar for at least one month, shaken about daily. This hurried version is to real preserved lemons, as cucumbers are to pickles. Do not waste your time or attention.

This is an odd version of the recipe. For a good one see Paula Wolfort's "Mediterranean Cooking". She takes the lemons and quarters them, but not all the way through. She also cures them with less salt over a longer time.

I understood this as it was meant (I think?) Towel dry lemons. I can see how easily it could be misunderstood. It is poorly written. Gary's comment sure made me laugh though!

Gary, I think you may have misunderstood. I think that in any recipe to make preserved lemons you do not have to dry them. They were referring to drying them with a towel after scrubbing them (I think).

Had some teensy trouble with the first instruction: "Dry lemons well and cut each into 8 wedges". Tried sun-drying, but the other items were no longer fresh afterward. So, tried oven-drying. Either way, once they were thoroughly completely dry attempts to cut wedges resulted in broken lemons instead of wedges, and chipped knives. Went to the band saw, fine toothed blade. Perfect. Kidding above. Interesting, easy, stimulates the culinary imagination. I had equally good results with potassium/sodium "salt substitute". Liked them in the CRACKED GREEN OLIVES WITH HERBS AND PRESERVED LEMON recipe online here.
