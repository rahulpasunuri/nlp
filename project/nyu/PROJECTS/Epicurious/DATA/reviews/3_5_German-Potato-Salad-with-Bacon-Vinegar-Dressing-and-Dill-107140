I should have followed the recipe instead of the reviews! I used all vinegar instead of a mix of vinegar and water and I thought it was too much. I suggest you start with the recommended amount of vinegar and add more later if you want. Also, I only had 4 slices of bacon and it was still good.

Made this for an Oktoberfest party-- I did the recipe x 8 and needed to prep the night before so I prepared the potatoes and kept them covered in the fridge overnight, then made and tossed them with the dressing the next day and served at room temp. Rave reviews! Don't skip the dill. It adds a pickle taste. I also used all vinegar instead of water and it was perfectly tangy.

This is so easy and actually healthy. I buy the Applegate Sunday Bacon, which has little fat and no nitrates. We found that we had to double the dressing otherwise the potatoes absorbed too much. Also added a little more vinegar. I brought this to a BBQ and everyone loved this potato salad. It's a keeper!

I've made this several times and it is always well received. At first I felt it needed more flavor so I bumped up the vinegar (others have done the same), mustard and bacon. We prefer it without the dill all together. I serve it with the Bratwurst with Apples, Onions and Sauerkraut. 5 yums from Chef B.

this was fairly easy and a classic german potato salad. i didn't have fresh dill, but used dried and i think the fresh dill would have made this outstanding.

Great recipe. I will nix the water and use all vinegar next time. Really good as it was however!

My husband was worried that this dish would be too salty, but three different people asked for the recipe at the cookout. Used extra mustard.

awesome recipe. i used half pancetta half bacon. I left the skin on red potatoes. I boiled them for 12 mins. then, I layered them and "drizzle" the dressing. I subbed shallots for red onions.I also added some minced cucumber as my mil does it. I thicken the sauce with at ts of cornstarch. Delicious.

Very tasty. Made this to go with bratwurst for an Oktoberfest party. Everyone loved it, someone even wanted the recipe. Definitely add more bacon!

Brought to a lawn picnic and served at room temp, a touch salty but got rave reviews from kids and adults. Did not have any dill and it was fine. The cold leftovers the next day were also a hit. Nice change from the mayonaise version of potato salad.

Loved it. Big hit!

This is merely good if you make it as directed. Why? Because the fresh dill is in such quantities that it is texturally distracting. There is not enough vinegar to give it good pucker and not enough bacon to make it delicious. That said... add more bacon, onion and vinegar and ditch most of the dill (or make it dry dill) and add some green onion right at the end and you have something pretty good. I also used more bacon fat. It needed it. One fork. That's something given it is potatoes and bacon. It is just not that wow without the mods. With mods it is a three forker. I would make it again with the mods.

I used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of red and was generous with the red onion, but kept everything else according to the recipe. This turned out great, and really isn't too much work for a warm potato salad. I think next time I'll add more bacon.

Went well with beer braised sausages and sweet/sour green beans for Oktoberfest dinner. Can use regular grained mustard. I cooked potatoes, made sauce, and le sit; then combined and heated through right before serving

I think this is the best hot german potato salad I have ever eaten. I added extra bacon and a german vinegar because I was out of white vinegar. It was quicker to make by slicing the potatoes and cooking them. Incredible!!!

I really like this kind of potato salad vs. any mayo-based version. A quick scan of the ingredients and (if you're like me) you'll agree...What's not to like? Here's how I "massaged" it, based on the ingredients I had on hand... -I used a smooth dijon mustard and it worked out just fine. -I used more bacon (again, what's not to like?) -I tried a blend of white wine and champagne vinegars. -I used more fresh dill (I got a double bunch for $0.99 and went wild). This recipe is a little more work than your basic potato salad, but more than worth it. Play with it, massage it, make it your own. It's a really good basic recipe.

Made the recipe with slight adjustments. I used chicken broth instead of water. I also did not have any fresh dill so I left it out. Otherwise, my recommendation would be to keep the recipe as is except to increase the onions slightly and reduce the salt. Also, use Yukon Gold potatoes. Very good recipe.

I used cider vinegar and just a little less water. The taste was was plenty pungent. Decided not to add the fresh dill. Would have liked fresh parsley. Great basic recipe.

This came out great with some tweaking. I used seasoned rice wine vinegar so I omitted the sugar, added to taste, with darker spicier mustard. Didn't have dill, so I added chopped Ba-tampte garlic dills (made without high fructose corn syrup)into the warm mixture as it reduced. It was actually excellent.

I made a vegan version, omitting the bacon and substituting olive oil for pan drippings. Added a little extra salt. Used white balsamic vinegar, and reduced the vinegar mixture a little more than indicated. Came out very well. I like the tanginess of the vinegar sauce.

This was a *tasty* potato salad but required a bit of tweaking. Most preferred a stronger flavor and I agreed. I omit half the water at first, but ended up adding more vinegar at the end so you can just omit all of it. I added an extra teaspoon (per single recipe) of mustard, but my German friend said that traditionally a less coarse, yet more pungent mustard is more common in potato salads. I doubled this recipe and served it to an audience that adores bacon so I doubled the bacon ratio and used a bit more of the drippings for flavor. It could stand more dill, in this case, to balance out the bacon but was delightful regardless. I cut and steamed the potatoes the night before, using reds, then putting them in tupperware and refrigerated overnight. The reds held up *just fine*, and were not at all mushy. If anything, leave them just slightly underdone. I then prepared the recipe as directed the next day and the final heating and stirring of the potatoes put them at the perfect tenderness. A bit of warning though, the vinegar is OVERWHELMING if you're cooking in a small confined space. Make sure to have open windows and vents while reducing the sauce. If the vinegar is too much flavor-wise, increase the sugar slightly. Definitely best served warm, and it was devoured! A bit of work, but very very worth it.

PS to my previous post...I used Yukon Gold potatoes and it has been my belief that these potatoes do hold up to this kind of recipe. If they are sliced- boil them for 10 mins only. These potatoes will not get starchy if cooked for that amt of time.

Made the recipe as instructed and it was very good. If one wants a little bit more intense flavor, they could SLIGHTLY increase the mustard or the vinegar (perhaps even mixing a flavored vinegar with a regular white vinegar). This was served with brined pork. Overall, very good...and one that I would make again.

We had a recipe for a German Style potato salad that didn't include the bacon, but have misplaced it. So we thought we would try this. I used turkey bacon because it was what I had on hand. To accomodate that it doesn't give off the fat required I just put a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in the pan with the bacon and the diced onion. I didn't even need to take the bacon out of the pan as I chopped it before putting on to cook. This came together quickly and easily. I used a slightly spicy pub style mustard and it really worked well with the sugar and the bacon. We will make this all summer.

I would make this again, though I like a stronger-flavored salad. A couple of changes that suit my palate: double the vinegar and omit the water, use 3T of spicy (not hot) mustard, and a bit more chopped red onion (plus sliced onion...below). I carmelized the onion dice in the bacon fat and then added all the spices (used dry dill and some tarragon) and 3/4 cups of the vinegar, reducing the volume by a third or so and thickening the liquid to more like cream. Toss this with the potatoes with the remaining 1/4 cup of vinegar, uncooked for piquancy. Also, rice (or brown rice) vinegar can be a nice touch here as it adds an extra degree of depth and a bit of sweetness. I also tossed in the remaining red onion, very thinly sliced, which "melts" in the presence of the marinade and heat. One last note, I dislike mushy potatoes (I'm from Idaho!), so I boiled potato halves till they were barely done, and then sliced (or cubed) them. A bit of snap between the teeth can really make this recipe. I've gotten great reviews on the taste and overall quality of this dish. Marshall.

I've made this salad 2 years in a row for our neighborhood 'Oktoberfest' and both years the salad has turned out runny and mushy. I followed directions both years, only variation was the potatoes. Altho the neighbors commented the flavor was wonderful, the presentation (and amount left over, in spite of their positive comments) is unacceptable. I'm looking for a new recipe for this year.

Used red, unpeeled potatoes. Did not omit and -- for ONCE -- did not add anything to the recipe as presented. Chose very lean bacon and saved ALLl the fat for the dressing. Everyone at my daughter's San Francisco barbecue pronounced the salad outstanding. I will keep it in my permanent collection. I don't promise never to alter the original recipe, but it's pretty darn good as is. Hurray for the Germans! Ann Woody

This is a basically good recipe - but beware that you'll probably have to tweak the amounts. I doubled the recipe and ended up having to add tons of the vinegar/water/sugar/mustard solution at the end for more flavor. More onions and probably some garlic, too. BUT the taste, in the end, is really unique... just be patient!

Brought as a sidedish to a street block party and all loved it. The bacon is just soooo delicious.

i liked this, but i think it was a little too vinegar-y...i did however use half white wine vinegar and half apple cider vinegar, and wasn't too precise with the measurements, so it's probably my fault. to balance out the taste, i just added a bit more sugar. i also used more of the bacon drippings---not too healthy, but it was good. added chives along with the dill, and some garlic to the onions. all in all, a very good dish that i will make again.

This was a very good side for beer-can chicken. Used 2 pounds of small red potatoes; otherwise, followed the recipe pretty darn closely. Quite perfectly seasoned -- even my salt-everything husband resisted an extra shake.

This is really good...please read on...I actually used part of this recipe and part of another recipe on this site, and it turned out fantastic (with the following adjustments)! Good, high quality bacon is a must...used part yellow and part red onion...a little white wine vinagar and a little cider vinager (definitely to taste)...grey poupon (to taste)...I used the 2 t. of sugar, but not the two t. of salt, this is also definitely to taste. I also used ALL of the bacon grease because I thought it would better coat the potatoes, I was right about that. I also added a couple shakes of Penzey's Bavarian Seasoning and sprinkled chopped fresh parsely just before tossing potatoes with the dressing. I did not use dill. My version is really good. Trust me. I am well known for my good taste in food. Try it.

We really liked this recipe! This is actually the second time I made it. I am not a big fan of a "traditional" potato salad and this had just the right twist. Like someone else mentioned in their review, I also increased the bacon to my liking. It's fairly simple to prepare too...perfect for a picnic type menu.

Very, very easy: I used Ba-Tempte kosher mustard one time, dijon the second - different tastes, both excellent. Chop the onion a little coarser to get more taste, and use cayenne instead of black pepper for a tiny but interesting zip.

The potato salad was delicious; however, I used center cut bacon and increased the amount to 8 slices and also added chopped green onions to give it more color and flavor. Additional salt and pepper were required for the perfect taste.

We didn't care for this at all. I had to re-season several times, and it was still just not right. We almost always save and reuse leftovers, but the bulk of this went into the trash. Yech.
