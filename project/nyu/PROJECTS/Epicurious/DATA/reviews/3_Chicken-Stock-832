A wonderful and tasty staple - easy for even the beginner cook!

Seems like an incomplete recipe to me. What about skimming all the fat that would be produced by all those chicken wings? Also, how does it compare volume-wise to regular stock...Doesn't seem worth the hours of cooking for 1 1/2 cups.
