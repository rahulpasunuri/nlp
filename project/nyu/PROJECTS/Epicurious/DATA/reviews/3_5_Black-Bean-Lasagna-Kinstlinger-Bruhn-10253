unless you like black beans like some people like chocolate, this recipe is not for you.

Based on previous reviews, I expected this to be fabulous. It wasn't. It was a LOT of work for a bland result. Sauce is too dry; there's WAY too much cheese, making it very, very heavy; and it had very little flavor. I thought a night in the fridge would bring out more flavor, but it was even blander the next day. Will not make again.

I made this with fresh lasagna sheets (which I bought), dried beans and basil since I couldn't get coriander. I thought it was ok but my husband and guests raved about it. Next time I'd make more of the tomato sauce for a juicier lasagna.

I enjoyed this dish. I used canned beans. Both Black and Red.

I used canned beans as well. It was good the first night, but left overs the next day were dry and not as good.

Delicious-Didn't miss the meat at all! I took other reviewers advice using canned beans and was not disappointed. I wonder about how it could be made using precooked pasta noodles as this seemed to be the most time consuming part.

I made this dish for a vegetarian aunt and quite a few serious carnivores (myself included). This recipe was just awesome! I never felt that anything was "missing" as some vegetarian recipes feel as if they are lacking something.

My most requested potluck dinner contribution. I've always thought I should send Ms. Kinstlinger-Bruhn a thank you note.

Made four different lasagna dishes for a party. This was the first dish to be totally eaten and there were requests for more. It makes a large amount but the flavor is worth the effort. I would highly recommend this recipe. It is wonderful!

I made this recipe especially for my pregnant daughter, who is a vegetarian, and this seemed a good way to provide lots of protein! My only complaint is that the sauce was too thick, and I added both more wine and water. I used canned beans as someone suggested; perhaps 4 cups was too much and that caused the over-thickening of the sauce?

We loved this recipe and I will make it again. I took others' advice and used canned black beans and commercial spaghetti sauce (Prego w/sausage). Next time I will use a little more spaghetti sauce and make the full recipe so that I can freeze half for an even quicker and easier meal.

Its a welcome variation to a classic dish, but whatever you do, DO NOT use no-boil pasta. It will come out dry as a bone.

I tried this recipe as a competitor to a black bean lasagna recipe I already have. It was good, but too much messy work. Use a large jar of your favorite sauce (I use Prego tomato, onion and garilc) and use canned black beans. Makes your life easier and tastes just as good. Also, I mix in some pepper jack cheese with the mozarella to make it a little more interesting. Fresh cilantro and red pepper flakes make a beautiful garnish.

Great flavor! Makes alot, divided into 2-9X9s and froze one pan before cooking. Even my three year old liked it!! Skip cooking fresh beans and use 4 cups canned (mash one and use three in sauce)

The sauce was extremely thick and made a mess of my stove when it was simmering. I used the crushed and pureed tomatoes and they were both the consistency of tomato paste. Is that how they're suppose to be? Next time, I'll maybe try adding some wine or water to the sauce. Otherwise, this was great lasagna!

Makes alot - big pan. Definitely would feed 8. Not too bad to prepare - if you do it in stages and sort of work a bit at it all day. Interesting flavor. Unfortunately it gave me such horrendous heart burn (on the first night and the second night with the leftovers) that I'll be shying away from this one. My toddler hated it - but I think that was more of an appearance thing than a flavor thing.

Wonderful! This is probably the best vegetarian lasagna recipe I've ever tried. The cilantro (fresh coriander) adds just the right flavor.

I love this dish! I have made it for guests many times and they always ask for the recipe! It makes enough for eight, easily, if you just use tons more lasagna noodles and spread the rest more thinly.

More time consuming than I thought it might be; divide the cheese in half to lower fat; great sauce -- would definitely serve again, my guests loved it!
