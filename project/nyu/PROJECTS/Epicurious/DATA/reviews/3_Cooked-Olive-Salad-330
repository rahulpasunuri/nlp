An excellent companion to fresh Italian bread, this salad reminds me of a Sicilian dish my grandmother makes. Her dish is a main course with a base very similar to this salad and chunks of chicken, carrot and celery stewed together. I would recommend the addition of any of those items to this salad, although it is wonderful as is. Caveat: don't be overly generous with the oil. 1/3 cup MAX.
