Whoever Dave is, I love him! I used a whole, wild salmon fillet & substituted agave syrup for the hoisin sauce. The result was wonderful. Rather than discarding the marinade, I brought it to a low boil to kill off any bacteria from the fish, then stirred in 2 T of cream & served it over the salmon. To DIE for! Alongside, I served Asian Pear and Watercress Salad with Sesame Dressing

I think this could have been REALLY good but I have to agree with others regarding a longer marinating time. I did it from 10 AM until I cooked it for supper and the flavor just wasn't there. Will try again as the one person did and marinate it for two days!

Definitely agree with other reviews, a longer marinade time only makes this better.

This has become a family favorite - especially for my 10-year old daughter. If you have time to marinate a bit longer, it definitely adds to the flavor.

I was looking for a new way to use hoisin with salmon, and this was good and pretty simple. Somehow I didn't have soy sauce in my fridge but had terriyaki sauce, so in that went instead.

I have made this over a dozen times for my family. My two kids LOVE it; it's the only way they want me to cook salmon. I have also made it for company and received compliments on it.

Rating: 4
Even without the hoisin sauce this was very good! I was cooking for two; 15 minutes bake time was plenty. Next time will marinate for at least a couple of hours, though, as the thinner ends of my fillets were the tastiest part (having soaked up more marinade).

Rating: 4
This has become our instant favorite way to prepare salmon. It is super easy, quick, can be done in the oven which is much easier than grilling, and comes out moist and delicious every time. I usually omit the lemon juice and scallions, simply out of laziness, and it is still great. We've made this at least 5 times and haven't grown tired of it yet.

I was having a dinner party for 8 in a new condo, where living room, dining room and kitchen are all part of one space. Wanting to make things ahead of time because of this, I made the marinade in a large ziplock 2 days ahead of time, put the individual pieces of salmon in the bag, and kept it in the fridge, turning it once or twice during the 2 days. I baked it as instructed, and it was literally one of the best salmon dishes I've ever tasted. My gourmet cook of a friend said "This is the best salmon I've ever put in my mouth." Coming from her, I considered it a great compliment. Wonderful dish, particularly for entertaining.

This dish is fabulous and the easiest way to cook for even a crowd. Start checking at 12- 13 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon. You will not be disappointed.

I have made this recipe over a dozen times and it is a crowd pleaser each time. I forget that there are people who don't like salmon, so I don't remember to ask my guests if it's okay for me to cook them salmon. The 3 times I cooked this for people who I found out later didn't like salmon, they all DEVOURED the dish. It is an easy dish to prep and so tasty.

Rating: 1
I followed the recipe exactly as written when I knew that it's 12-13 mins. in the oven for 1" thick fish. My fantastic salmon was too dry- in part due to the over cooking and I believe in part because of the soy sauce, eventhough I used low sodium. I love salmon, I love Epicurious and use at least 2 recipes a day from this site. But this one would get a 0 fork if such a rating were possible.

I don't normally review the recipes I find here, good or not, but in this case I had to make an exception. This was simple and quick to make and absolutely delicious. My wife is a piscatarian so I'm always on the lookout for a fish recipe that I might enjoy (I'm a confirmed carnivore and find fish about as exciting as Grey's Anatomy reruns, i.e. not very), and this is the first recipe I've found that I could eat again and again. Highly recommended.

Dave is a cook who submitted this recipe to the magazine. I remember seeing the original entry and it was one of those where he said he like to share his recipe. His last name was used when it was published in print...it's a shame "DAVE" doesn't get full credit here.

This is very tasty and easy. It's surprising that only 90% would make it again. And, who is this Dave? He isn't identified in the Epicurious recipe.

I have made this a number of times and it's always delicious. It gets 4 forks partly because it tastes good, and partly because it's so darned easy. You can cook the rest of your dinner while the fish is marinating and/or in the oven. Perfect!

Would I make this dish again? You betcha! Followed the recipe to a tee -even using measuring spoons - and it was moist and flavorful. Kinda wish I had kept the marinade and used it for an au jus - sans garlic, ginger and all the other chunky bits - but as it was, it was awesome. Wouldn't change anything. Can I marry you, Dave?

The best & easiest salmon marinade out there! I often omit the ginger if I don't have it, since the other ingredients are pantry staples. Doesn't seem to matter a bit! Goes very well with any kind of packaged couscous or rice, and cold green beans tossed with sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds. A favorite even of those who don't think they like fish.

Rating: 4
Okay, it is simple, but great. I panicked because I didn't have the scallions or ginger, but I added some Raspberry Chipotle Sauce (just a touch) and got the little sweet and spicy edge. My husband is allergic to salmon, so I will make this when he is out of town as a special treat to myself. I paired it with a curried couscous and a Chardonnay - marvelous!

I've made this recipe several times, and my guests have loved it every time. When pressed for time, I've started marinating it several hours in advance and left it chilling in the refrigerator, and the marinade has never overpowered the flavor of the salmon. I usually grill the salmon with great results - about nine minutes for 1 1/2 inch fillets. Last night I paired this with Ginger Fried Rice and green beans with almonds - best meal I've had in a while.

There are soooo many ways to make salmon. My husband and I weren't that impressed with this one. It was just so-so in our book. Its hard enough to get my husband to eat fish. I'll move on to another salmon recipe next time.

I would have given this a higher rating had I not prepared salmon with Asain Barbecue Sauce (Gourmet, June 2002) the week before. That recipe has similar flavors, but is just better in my opinion. I thought the ginger in this one to be a tad overpowering.

i've made this recipe probably 100x's for various guests with different tastes and there are never any left-overs. in fact, when i visit friends and family they ask me to make this recipe for salmon every time. i do alter the ingredients slightly, but really only in quantity for intense flavor. first, i use 1 tbsp. ground ginger instead of freshly peeled/sliced and add twice as much garlic and scallions. you do not need to double this recipe for 4 filets, however, i do triple the marinade time (2 hrs.) and bake at 475 deg. F. for 15 - 20 min. depending upon filet thickness. this may help those who thought this recipe was not very flavorful. by making a few relatively minor adjustments i guarantee thay you will make this one of your staple recipes.

I do not consider myself an experienced cook. Just someone who likes to eat! I am getting married in the fall to a doctor who will be working alot of hours, so I become overnight "Chef Jeff" This site has been wonderful. Anyway in regards to chef Dave. This dish was a big hit for my soon-to-be in-laws. I have made this dish twice. Both times it was tasty however the first time was better. When buying the fish try to get the filets and not the steaks. I found the filets took the marinate a little bit better. Dont be shy with the Hoisen sauce, let it marinate for at least 30 minutes and throw it all in the oven together. Dont feel that you have to wipe anything off before cooking.

Rating: 3
My salmon came out very nice, but it didn't have the flavor I was expecting. As a matter of fact, I didn't taste the marinade at all! This might be because the salmon I used was still a little bit frozen, so perhaps the marinade didn't "take" the way it should have. I like some of the other suggestions to marinate the salmon in a baking dish and put the whole thing in the oven rather than discarding the rest of the marinade.

Rating: 3
I initially thought this sauce would be a bit too strongly flavoured for salmon, but it turned out very well. I don't eat salmon, but my boyfriend loved it. I have a very similar recipe that I use for pork tenderloin, so I'm certain this sauce would taste nice on pork tenderloin as well. Thanks for a great recipe!

Rating: 3
Very tasty, although i think i might try just one tablespoon of Hoison instead of two next time. it was pretty sweet. i think it would be excellent grilled. i mixed the marinade in a baking dish, marinated it, then put the whole thing in the oven rather than moving it to a baking sheet. simple and good, had it with brown rice, orange-pecan-ginger green beans, and vinaigretted arugula.

I made this last night for some friends at their home. The marinade tasted a little too sweet, so I added about 1 tablespoon more of soy sauce and about a teaspoon of minced ginger. I intended to bake the salmon in the oven as per the recipe, but at the last minute my host threw it on the barbecue. It was very good and I'd like to see how it tastes after being prepared in the oven. I'd also add some cilantro, as per a previous cook, just because I like it.

Extremely good. My parents hired me out to cook for themselves and some of their friends, and it was delicious.

I have dozens of good salmon recipes, but this is one of the best. I made one pound of salmon, but the full amount of sauce. As others did, I baked the fillet with some of the marinade and solid pieces on top. The recommended oven temperature and cooking time was perfect for us, although I did leave it in the oven, turned off and with the door ajar, for about five minutes. I boiled up the remainder of the marinade and used it as a sauce at table. Excellent and easy to put together.

Rating: 4
This was a really good "terriyaki" marinade. Like other reviewers, I used some of the marinade to baste the fish while baking. I also cranked the oven up to 500F for the last 2 minutes to really carmalize the sauce. Salmon turned out a perfect medium rare (350F for 17 minutes and 500F or 2 minutes).

Rating: 4
This was absolutely positively the best salmon I have ever made! I can't wait to make this again. I did marinated for a total of about 3 1/2 to 4 hours, removed from marinade, but spooned the extra garlic, ginger, and scallions on top before baking.

I made this recipe for guests, and absoloutely loved it!! We love Salmon, and this was a very quick, inexpensive and easy way to prepare it. I served it with a stir fry of asparagus and snap peas, steamed white rice, and sauteed sweet corn. Also with garnishings of some sesame seeds and sliced scallions on top of the salmon. I will be making it again this weekend for my Mom and Dad. Oh, by the way, I prepared it in the morning, and let it marinade until dinner...no complaints at all! No leftovers either!

Great dish, Dave! The marinade is so easy to make. I went just a little light on the pepper and now wish I'd put just a bit more in. The flavors of the hot + slightly sweet + salty are just out-of-this-world. Couldn't ask for an easier cooking method.

Wow. I've never felt compelled to reveiw any other recipe I've tried from this site, but this dish was truly spectacular and I've already recommended it to my friends.

My boyfriend (who is an excellent cook) said this was one of the best meals he's ever had.

I have to recommend as well as one of the reviewers some 3-4 hours to marinate the fish. It tasted great. I served it with wild rice and offered the marinade as sauce. However, I boiled it a little bit before, just in case the fish left some water in the marinade.

Rating: 4
This is awesome and has become one of our regular favorites. My husband prefers it barbq'd, but I personally think baking it leaves it more moist and does a better job of retaining the marinade flavors. We usually make it with stir-fried green beans (in place of asparagus using the STIR-FRIED SESAME ASPARAGUS recipe) and fettucine tossed with a little reserved marinade.

Rating: 4
Dave has become my new best friend. Have prepared this dish several times now for salmon-loving husband and for dinner parties--always easy, elegant and delicious. A few alterations: I double (at least) the quantities of the ingredients, marinate for 2 to 3 hours and bake the salmon right in the marinade with all the yummy bits on top of the fillets. We especially love this dish served with garlicy greens like kale, and brown and wild rice. Mmm, mmm.

I have used this recipe twice in recent weeks for company and receieved great feedback each time. To enhance the flavor a bit, I cooked mine in the oven on a well-soked cedar plank. I cooked it on the plank on the grill once, but the plank kept catching on fire, so I've found it's much easier to ensure consistent results in the oven and the flavor is just as good.

Rating: 4
quick, easy, and tasty. a couple of minor altercations, however...doubled the scallions, added a tinge more ginger and pepper, and marinated for 2 hrs. during marinating period, juliened carrots, napa cabbage, bok choy, zucchini, shiitake mushrooms and spinich and sauteed while salmon was baking and served along with non-seasoned wild rice. a seemingly light meal quickly fills you up and satisfies the palate. in addition, doubled the marinate for guests, serving the usused portion at the table for those who wanted to add a little more flavor. no leftovers for tomorrow!

Very good. My husband and I eat a lot of salmon, and this was an easy and tasty preparation. I will definitely make it again, and would consider it for the basis of a "company" meal. I added some fresh chives and a little wasabi powder for some addtional flavors because I had them handy, and it punched up the taste nicely. This is also a good recipe if you, or people you are cooking for are following South Beach, or Adkins, because the marinade doesn't include sugar, or rely on sugar for flavor, like many others.

I eat salmon at least twice a week and am always looking at new ways to prepare it . I've already made this at least half a dozen times -so delicious. The fish comes out moist and wonderfully glazed, plus there's no clean up since it is made on a foil lined tin. Another huge plus is that it doesn't leave a "salmony" smell to the house afterwards like some of the methods I use where I sear it on the burner first and then finish it off by roasting the fish in the oven. It is also a lot easier than poaching. Perfect for a midweek meal but also special enough for company with a few interesting sides.
