I made the fruit to go with these cookies, but haven't tried the full dessert together yet, however, the cookies are exceptional! I didn't fuss with rolling them out - I refridgerated the dough as a log, and then baked thinly-sliced rounds. They are lovely, crispy discs. These would also make excellent holiday cookies - they aren't as "summery" flavored with the cinnamon and cardamom spices, but they will be delicious with fresh fruit.

Still working on perfecting this, flatter cookies have better flavor/texture so if you make balls (no need to refrigerate) vs cut-outs, press them w small glass dipped in bit of cornmeal.

Cookies only: very good, love the crunch from the cornmeal! Still a bit sweet, will cut back to 1/4 cup each. Tried rolling (and I'm very experienced w cut-out cookies) and though the wax paper process was as helpful as it could be, still didn't think necessary so just cooked rest of dough in balls, baked 12 min. Perfection!

I made just the cookies and loved them. Perfect with a cup of tea after dinner - not too sweet, but still satisfying and crunchy.

A great ending for a summer dinner party! I usually make the cookies and fruit topping day ahead. The cornmeal makes a nice crisp cookie.

I fixed this as dessert for our wine and gourmet club and it was a big hit. Very delicous and just right for a warm summer evening. The cardamom gave the cookies an "out of the ordinary" taste and the cornmeal added a good texture.
