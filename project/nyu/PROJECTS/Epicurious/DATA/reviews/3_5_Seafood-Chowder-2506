My husband and I LOVED this recipe. However, I modified the recipe according to "A Cook from Seattle". I added salmon, halibut, large prawns, mussels, 3 crab legs,large scallops, choppped stew tomatoes instead of the tomato paste. I did not add the chopped clams only the clam juice. And I added tarragon. I am happy to have followed the Cook from Seattle's recipe. However, next time, I will add some chorizo for meat. Yes, this recipe becomes expensive but it is delicious and you won't find this much seafood at a restaurant. We had another round a second night, so it is plentiful.

This is a GREAT recipe. I added fresh tarragon to it (3T) and put 1/2 # of scallops and a small lobster tail in it for more shellfish flavor (plus more tomato sauce/water). This is a new winter staple for me. For extra heat, use 2 tsp crushed red pepper.

it was ok, the canned chopped clams and the abundant tomatoe soup made this a truly pedestrian experience, and for the cost of the ingredients, not worth it at all. Dave

I have made this over & over throughout the years, usually for out of state friends that all expect seafood when they visit. I use whatever looks good at the fish market (living in Seattle I usually have many choices). My standby's are a combo of salmon, halibut, shrimp, mussels, clams and perhaps a crab leg or two. I also delete the tomato paste and add a can of chopped stewed tomato's, and add more cayenne. Serve with a good bottle of wine and some bread, and it's always a hit!

I would make this again because it's easy and fast. It's not the ultimate but it certainly fits the bill if you're looking to save time and eat well.

good, simple dish. i will probably back off on the spices, though, as it was a bit on the hot side. we have shortlisted it for the christmas soup.

Having read the previous warnings about the soup, I used an organic tomato soup with roasted garlic and added a bit of cream. It worked beautifully. I served it to guests, who loved it. Everybody asked for seconds -- and for the recipe.

Have made this recipe 3 times in one month, but changed it everytime. The first time we used salmon instead of red snapper. Second time clams, shrimp, and scallops. And finally prefected the recipe using clams, shrimp, and scallops, stewed tomatos, and basil. Kind of expensive, but worth it.

Maybe I should have known that we would be less than thrilled with this recipe -- neither of us are big tomato soup fans. the shrimp and the fish were delicious, the clams just a filler. We added some fresh basil, which helped. But this is basically the tomato soup we had as children with fish added. If you liked it then, you'll love it now. As for us, we'll pass.

My family really liked this recipe. It was easy and fast! I served it over steamed rice with sourdough bread on the side. Changes I made: finely chopped the onions and added white wine to the stock before adding the fish. Delicious!

This was really delicous and quite easy to prepare. I thought that the proportions would be off when I read it, but it was perfect. Quite rich- a little goes a long way.

This chowder is very easy to make and was a big hit at home. The canned tomato soup can make or break the recipe. I tried an organic brand that had no chemicals but it tasted unnaturally sweet. I added 2 whole canned tomatoes, white wine and a little cream to counteract the prepared soup taste.

I thought that this recipe was excellent and easy to make. I used haddock instead of the red snapper(it wasn't available) and I used tomato paste in a tube (who wants to waste a whole can for one tablespoon). I have given this recipe to a couple of friends.
