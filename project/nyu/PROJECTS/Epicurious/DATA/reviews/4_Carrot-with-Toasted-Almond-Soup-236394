Good soup, but needed some work. I would add some minced garlic to sauté first, and it definitely needed some kick. I also added some white wine while it was simmering. Without these changes, it would've gotten two stars from me.

Very yummy soup. I made it for Christmas dinner and got lots of compliments. Wish I had more for leftovers. I used fresh grated ginger instead of ground and it was great!

A fall favorite with some chunky bread. This year I'm serving it as a "shooter" before Thanksgiving dinner (in clear 2 oz shooter cups.) The toasted almonds are KEY as are the sweet carrots. I never change a thing in the recipe. Enjoy!

THERE IS NO VINEGAR IN THIS RECIPE. If you think you saw it, look again before you make it! I've made this soup twice in the last two years and am making again for this Thanksgiving. Don't skip the almonds - make extra!

I haven't tried yet, but Montecore form New York, please read the recipe again. It calls for apple cider, not apple cider vinegar! No wonder you didn't like it!

Vinegar soup. Used unfiltered and very sweet carrots but the vinegar still overpowered all other ingredients. Suggest you start with just a 1/2 cup vinegar instead of the full 1 cup recipe calls for. Really surprised this has received so many good reviews.

Loved this soup!! So did Pa & sis. Made second batch the very next day. The toasted almond is such an unexpectedly lovely addition. I should note I used a generous teaspoon of curry powder and a 1/2 tsp of ginger- this made it very kicky, maybe just a touch too much.

I thought this soup was very good, but not exceptional. Exceptional means I am so excited to have leftovers, and I wasn't. I can't really describe why it didn't wow me - it was just a little boring.

Yummmm! This hit it out of the park. I doubled the recipe, added a touch more spice because that's what we like. I also did 1/2 evoo and butter. I used 2 bottles hard cider because that's what I had.. If you love rich tasting, curry flavored things, you will like this. You feel guilty eating it, it's so rich tasting, but it's actually good for you. What more could you want from a soup!

This recipe was fabulous. I am not a carrot soup fan but I had so many leftover carrots in my fridge that needing using... I am going to make another pot tomorrow. I used olive oil instead of butter and only about 1/2 of what it called for. I also used home made turkey broth (the turkey was an apple cider brined turkey so that added to the apple flavour). This is really an extrodinary soup

Wish I could give 3 1/2 forks. Made as directed except had no cider so used apple juice with a tbsp of cider vinegar. Served for company with roast beef dinner and it was a hit...but the carrots ARE very fresh and sweet here in Panama.... Sandra McNally Calgary/Panama/Edmonton

Very delicious! I cut up a few strips of applewood smoked bacon, and sauteed them until crispy. Take them out with a slotted spoon and put them back in the pot after the veggies are sauteed in the bacon fat. San Rafael, CA, I think you used apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider!

Made this last night and am looking forward to see how the next-day flavors have melded. Pretty good, but not knock me off my socks delicious. Would have liked a slightly more complex flavor, perhaps doubling the curry and thyme would have helped. Would be a great base soup to try out some different and exotic flavors though. Still delicious, just not quite 4 forks worthy.

This was the favored dish at our Thanksgiving. While everything turned out well, I think our guests were a bit shocked by the idea of having a soup composed primarily of carrots. I doubled the recipe to spectacular effect, and the soup came out amazingly. I'd definitely recommend this dish. It really pays to use slightly more curry powder, especially if you're used to spicier foods. I probably went a bit heavier on the salt and pepper, too, but I don't pay much attention to those two.

Doubled the spices because my family enjoys spicy food. I ended up adding about a cup of milk to this because I felt that it was too thick when I made it (I guesstimated the amount of carrots, so that could be part of it). Everybody loved the flavor of the soup. They didn't even leave me any! I will HAVE to make this again now.

I've only ever posted rave reviews on this site but this soup was inedible for me and I feel I must contradict all of the great reviews this has received. I followed the directions precisely and it tasted like a bowl of vinegar. Very disappointed with this one.

I made this today to test it out for Thanksgiving dinner. It passed with flying colors! The only difference is I had extra shallots (about 1.5 C) so used them all. Fantastic flavor, important to use very fresh carrots and UNFILTERED apple cider. All the flavors blended beautifully. Would order it in a 4* restaurant.

Delicious! I've made this once exactly as shown and once with half olive oil/ half butter, the butter was richer but both were terrific. The almonds on top give it a nice crunch. Definitely a keeper!!

Terrific! Got rave reviews from my guests and several requests for the recipe. Definitely a keeper. Used organic snack size carrots & chopped them up. Madras curry powder & 1/4 tsp dried thyme rather than fresh thyme. Still delicious cold for lunch the next day.

This was excellent. It had a very subtle sophistication to it. Perfect for the start of fall. Substituted veggie broth for the chicken and we didn't miss anything. Also didn't have any almonds on hand so used toasted walnuts instead. It was delish! Looking forward to making this again and again.

Excellent! I roasted the carrots with a bit of olive oil and salt and pepper along with a head of garlic. Garnish with sour cream, the almonds and chives. Simply amazing.

Divine! I didnt have apple cider or juice available, so I replaced it with Mango Juice. The sweetness was heaven! I also didnt have Thyme (I know...what sort of a kitchen do I have?!)so I replaced it with fresh corriander. Even with all the changes, this soup is a winner! 4 Stars!

Exceptional...short and sweet describes this fabulous soup...it took me a short amount of time to prep and cook, and the lingering sweetness of the apple cider matched the spicy heat of the curry. I used MDH 'curry masala' (1T) that I purchased at the Indian Foods shop--perfect. Toasted almonds added textural interest, plus a wedge of lime for those who crave a citrusy tang. A keeper.

This is A a wonderful recipe everyone are trying enjoyed . I added a bit more pepper.

I made this recipe with the last of my garden carrots. What a great soup! I did not add the curry as my family are not fans. The soup has been added to the family list of "must have" when the garden is in full bloom.

This soup was very good but it did not reheat well. I actually made it 2 days before and heated it up. It did not taste as good as it did when I first made it. I would rather make it the same day then to make it ahead. The soup is very tasty and flavorful, I would definitely make it again.

Fantastic. Made ahead of time for thanksgiving, great flavors. A forgiving recipe, too, as I ran out of room in the pot, and had to estimate my amounts of water,stock, and cider. The almonds are a very nice touch. This was very popular with my guests.

Perfect carrot soup! I doubled the recipe and used fresh ginger. Rich and hearty for a pureed soup --- the butter, shallots, and chicken stock add substance. The toasted almonds are tasty and good for texture, but not a deal breaker IMO. Gorgeous color!

I was skeptical for some reason, but this soup came out fabulously delicious. Used fresh ginger and plenty of it and other spices, and the toasted almonds are absolutely necessary. Made it again shortly after - definitely a keeper. So easy and cheap!

Very tasty carrot soup! I used olive oil instead of butter. The toasted almonds set off the soup quite well.

Fantastic! Just made this for my very particular family and they all thought it was perfect. My only changes were: 1) using fresh ginger rather than dry (1 tsp) 2) adding a squeeze of lemon at the end for extra "zip" 3) substituting 1/4 c. olive oil instead of butter 4) using coarsely chopped whole almonds rather than sliced ones since that's what we had in the house. I will definitely make this again, and will double the recipe next time since it will certainly store well.

Loved this recipe! I've made a couple of different carrot-apple soups before and this was the best one. I added about 1/4 cup more of apple cider and 1 Granny Smith apple, because I wanted more apple flavor, and it was delicious. It was the first thing to go at my friend's dinner party!

I've made a few different carrot soups, but both my husband and I agree this is the best one. I also used olive oil and veggie stock. The toasted almonds are a must! I've already passed the recipe on to a couple of friends.

Excellent soup! The toasted almonds were the perfect compliment in taste and texture. I made it almost exactly as written, however, having no verification of my bay leaves origin, and suspecting they were a tad....less than fresh....I tossed in three of them. I also coursely chopped the carrots in the food processor prior to adding them to the broth (and I will admit I also used this very same processor to blend the soup in the end...so sue me...) That being said, it was easy and tasty and a definite keeper.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving, and as leftovers... I doubled the recipe, keeping all proportions the same. I also substituted olive oil for the butter and veggie stock to make it vegan - it tasted fantastic.

I just made this to serve at Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow. Fabulous!I made it exactly according to the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing. The combination of sweetness of the apple cider and the spiciness of the curry makes this a complex and very flavorful soup. It will probably be even better tomorrow!

Re: earlier post - it always confuses me when someone disregards the listed ingredients in a recipe but still feels entitled to review it. At any rate, I didn't make any changes to stated recipe and it was very good. I agree that the quality of carrots is key, but I suppose that goes without saying when a dish is so focused on one ingredient. Easy, comforting, interesting with the almonds.

hansej03 from Lake Zurich, IL on 11/03/06 Perhaps if you tried the recipe the way that it was listed ( san garlic) your guests would have liked it better. Duh?

This was a meal w/ a good sour dough bread. I added a small yellow onion and 2 additional potatoes (small red skin). Increased water to 1-3/4 cups and threw in 5 whole garlic cloves. This had a unique flavor that not all people would like unless they were accustomed to out-of-the-ordinary flavors. Some of my dinner guests don't have sophisticated palates and I would not serve this to them.
