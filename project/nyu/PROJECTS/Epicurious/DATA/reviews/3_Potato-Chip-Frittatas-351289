I agree with the cook from Detroit--15 minutes is not enough. I did 25 minutes, until I saw some brown on the top. Yummy and easy!

I made them in ramekins which was great, but I definitely should have increased the baking time. They were slightly runny, but if you mix the frittatas a little bit when they are still hot then they cook themselves out of the oven. Overall, really great, I added bacon which was aweaome. Can't wait to try again!

I love the potato chips twist to the frittata muffins. I tried these today and all of them were gone in like 2 mins! a keeper recipe for sure. Thanks.

I thought I was the only one that made these! I use different ingredients though. It happened by accident. I was making a scallion frittata and dropped a chip into the mix...in the end, it was worth it.
