I brought these to a party and cooked them on a mini George Foreman grill and they were a big hit. I followed others advice and marinated the shrimp (I also brought some extra sauce to dip in but nobody used it.) I sliced prosciutto into 3 strips and used one strip per shrimp but I might even use less next time. It was still slightly overwhelming. I cut regular skewers in half and sharpened the other side to make mini skewers of each.

I use half cup olive oil and add balsamic dressing instead.

I made this as an appetizer for a brunch, everyone gobbled them down and several asked for the recipe. After reading the reviews, I made two changes. I didn't use a whole slice of proscuitto to wrap them, I cut the proscuitto in half lengthwise, then wrapped the shrimp. I also didn't use the sauce as a sauce. I threaded the shrimp on skewers, coated them with the sauce on both sides, then refrigerated them overnight before grilling them the next day. A perfect start to a wonderful afternoon with good friends.

The shrimp were wonderful. The sauce as a marinade and baste for the grill wonderful. The sauce as a dipping sauce not so great - my guests did not seem to enjoy. I'll make again and play around with the sauce recipe.

delicious! I skipped wrapping the shrimp and just marinated them in the sauce, as others suggested, for 20 - 30 min at room temp. I reserved 1/4 cup of the sauce for dipping. It was the hit of the party!

This recipe is delicious! However, instead of using the dipping sauce to dip I marinaded the shrimp in it for about an hour in the fridge then wrapped the prosciutto then grilled it. The final product was to die for and the people who had it were talking about it for days after. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Delicious! Thanks to most other reviewers, I marinated the shrimp in the garlic sauce for a couple hours before making it and used about half the amount of prosciutto. I also added some honey to the sauce as I thought it needed some rounding out. Grilling the skewers is key. They were extremely messy to eat but worth it!

Yummy! Big Hit at Book Club. I marninated the shrimp in the garlic sauce the day before. I also added basil to the dipping sauce as it made it both tastier and prettier!

This recipe is really good, but you do have to play with it a little. i suggest using half the prosciutto, or even doing half prosciutto, half panchetta. Also, when i made the dipping sauce, i threw in a 1/4 bunch of fresh basil leaves, and it gave the sauce, just the tang it was missing! Overall, i love this, and so did everyone i made it for!!

This wasn't a hit with us - the prosciutto overpowered the shrimp. I marinated the shrimp in the sauce as some recommended, but it didn't impart any flavor that could be tasted over the prosciutto (which I did halve.). Sorry to be a party pooper, but this is the first time I've ever had left-over shrimp!

A little labor intensive, but well worth it. Everyone loves these.

I made this last night and served them at room temperature. I wish I had taken another reviewer's advice and marinated the shrimp in some of the sauce; I think it would have added to the flavor. I thought the sauce was ok, but next time I'll play with it a little more. It needed something more, maybe garlic. But an easy, good looking appetizer.

Great appetizer. Really nice mix of flavor and texture.

This is delish! I loved the garlic sauce (I do love garlic) and didn't feel the red wine vinegar was too strong at all. I used half the prosciutto for each shrimp (1/2 is plenty) and marinated half the shrimp in the garlic sauce, and did half the shrimp w/o any sauce at all. Both were good, but the sauce added another layer of flavor which was wonderful. I did not notice the basil as much, and almost would have preferred two leaves. I ate some hot, some room temp, and almost liked the room temp ones better as the flavors seemed more pronounced. Drank with a rich Chardonnay and I thought it was lovely. Nice appetizer or even dinner for one with a side of steamed green beans and crusty bread.

Always delicious and well-liked even by finicky eaters. I brush the shrimp with a little olive oil just before grilling.

I found the prosciutto to overpower the shrimp. 1/2 the amount of prociutto is more than enough and adds just the right amount of zing to this amazing dish.

I wish I had read the suggestions about using half the proscuitto, because it did overpower the shrimp. I would also brush the shrimp with olive oil.

Ok, wow. this was the big hit of my christmas eve party. I found the prosciutto a bit hard to deal with-- unpealing it from one another, etc-- but it is very forgiving and made a nice presentation wrapped around the shrimp. Next time I might try a sweeter dipping sauce, but I have no complaints about this one. I also think it would be good with crab inside instead of shrimp. I cant wait to whip these out at my next barbecue.

I've made this appetiser several times with rave reviews every time. I use 1/2 slice of proscuitto, and half or even quarter the amount of dipping sauce depending on how much shrimp I'm doing. Very yummy.

I had this on skewers as part of a main course. They were wonderful. I took reviewers suggestions and was sparing with the amount of prosciutto. I served them with baby artichokes so and used the garlic sauce for dipping those as well. It was wonderful.

I agree that a small slice of prosciutto should be used so as not to overpower the shrimp.

We have made this many times. Our guests rave about it and request the recipe. I cut the sauce in half since we had way too much left over the first time.

A bit hit. I took others advice and didn't use too much prosciutto (1/2 pound for 2 lbs of 30 count shirmp). Also I marinated the shirmp in the marinade for 1 hour instead of using it as a dipping sauce.

This is a great recipe and a true crowd pleaser. I made this for a long marathon of present opening on Christmas Day and my family loved it! If you can grill them vs. broil them, they have a better flavor. I also think that next time, I would use smaller strips of proscuitto rather than the wide slices because it's a lot of meat and makes the appetizer a bit salty. Other than that, this is a great recipe and I will definitely make it again!!

Excellent appetizer! I made it many times and it has been a hit. I usually baste the shrimp with some of the sauce before grilling. I also make the sauce a bit thicker with mayo.

The marinate/dipping sauce was fantastic (I did add more garlic) but the prosciutto was a little too chewey after grilling and it's flavor over powered the shrimp. I made some without the prosciutto and liked those better.

Rating: 3
Great flavor and so easy. I, too, would drizzle the sauce over the shrimp next time. No one realized what the sauce was for and I had to keep telling them to go drizzle it on. I, too, would toss the shrimp in some olive oil to help it stay a bit moister...but an impressive appetizer or side dish for an elegant barbeque.

Great appetizer for a dinner party! Our guests loved them. Instead of using the garlic dipping sauce to "dip", we just marinated the skewers with the sauce and continued to re-apply while cooking. Definitely will make again!

The flavors were great here - but the shrimp was a little dry. I broiled it instead of grilling - but next time I will toss the shrimp with olive oil, salt and pepper before wrapping and broiling/grilling. The sauce was overpowering with red wine vinegar so I remade it with white wine vinegar and it was much more compatible. I drizzled it over the shrimp before serving - which worked better than dipping.

Hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this recipe. It's beyond easy, a great flavor combo., and pretty. The sauce is worth the minimal effort, but do halve the recipe. Nice for a no-carb. appetizer.

This is so easy and can be prepared ahead of time. I had to baste the shrimp on the BBQ with some of the dipping sauce and flip skewers frequently. My guests devoured the shrimp, even the ones not crazy about basil. This would be a great main course served over some linguini. I also served with the Roasted Red Pepper & goatcheese bruschetta garnished with basil, Yum! Cheers!

I have made this several times, it's very easy and it's always a hit with the guests. The first time I made this I didn't have time to make the garlic sauce, so I had a mustard sauce instead. Since the mustard sauce was a hit I have never tried the garlic sauce. Also, they are very tasty w/o any sauce. To make the sauce mix 1 part prepared dijon mustard to 3 parts mayo, horseradish to taste and capers(optional.

I made this appetizer for a holiday party and it was a big hit. Used just enough proscuitto to wrap around the shrimp once, otherwise the salty proscuitto taste overpowered the shrimp. I liked the sauce but didn't use as much garlic as called for. When I first made the sauce it came out nice and thick and creamy, but as it sat out at room temperature for a while I noticed the texture of the sauce became much thinner and liquidy. But the sauce still tasted good even at a thinner consistency. Would definitely make this again.

Very nice recipe! Here's a presentation idea...place the bowl of dipping sauce in the centre of a platter, add a sprig of basil to it, and place the skewers standing up around the bowl. And like the others said...DO NOT OVERCOOK!

I have made this shrimp many times, although I have never tried the sauce. My husband and I have always enjoyed it. I do modify it a little by adding one or two thin slices of garlic with the basil when I roll up the shrimp. This adds alot as long as you like garlic! Had these just last night with a nice bottle of Merlot! :-)

This is a great recipe. As long as you don't overcook the shrimp, it's wonderful. Have made it twice, and everyone loved it. Me too!

Used tiger shrimp and made it twice. Was so perfect the first time but the second time was grilled too long and it was ruined. DO NOT OVER COOK! The ham infuses too much salt and the basil will have no taste. The garlic sauce we did not even try as previous reviewers stated it was not worth the effort. We did make the 'Best Ever Shrimp Sauce' and the marriage of the basil prosciutto shrimp with that sauce was absolutly incredible!

This is one of my all-time favorites. Although delicious on their own, we really do like the sauce a lot. I find that it is VERY flavorful - anything but bland.

very tasty. Make sure you don't over-cook the shrimp, especially if you use smaller shrimp. It becomes VERY dry.

Loved this recipe, but didn't care for the sauce so I made a basil aioli. Threw a handful of leftover basil in food processor, added a large dollop of Dijon mustard, 3 med. cloves pressed garlic, lots of fresh ground pepper, a couple of egg yolks, processed that really well, then slowly added olive oil until it was the correct consistency. Delicious. I'm still eating the leftover aioli on crackers.

This dish is fantastic, with the sole exception of the dipping sauce! It was rather tasteless and just not in keeping with the great flavours of the proscuitto/basil/shrimp. I didn't even serve the sauce. These little morsels were so flavourful, they don't need a dipping sauce. I certainly can't manage to conjure up a better alternative. Easy to assemble ahead of time, and we didn't grill them (it was -13 C last night!), we just broiled them. Super easy, and super tasty. This is now a favourite of ours and our friends!

The shrimp, basil, prosciutto combination is delicious, the sauce is kind of boring and uninspired...I only realised this AFTER I made it. I ended up serving the skewers without the sauce and they flew off the plate. I would love to find some Wild Boar Prosciutto! How exotic! I also wrapped the shrimp the night before and assembled them on the serving platter. Covered tightly with plastic wrap, everything stayed just-made fresh. A definite keeper.

This has become one of my favourite appetizers to make a day ahead (both wrapping of the shrimp and the sauce). This is a major hit with friends! Took the suggestion of adding some cayenne to the dipping sauce .... not only does it give a "zing" it adds a lovely colour. I've had no trouble with the sauce .... perhaps other reviewers have been adding the oil too quickly?? Barbeque the shrimp if you can .... great flavour!

The shrimp were fabulous! However, the sauce was another story. The first time I made it, I had no trouble with the emulsification-it just worked. The second time, it would not work (after three tries!). So, I used mayonnaise, dijon mustard, a touch of balsamic vinegar and garlic oil (from the recipe for garlic bread with gorgonzola). Actually, we liked this better than the original garlic dipping sauce as it was a milder flavor.

Rave reviews of this recipe! I used single shrimp, size 31/40, and used soaked wooden toothpicks (large sturdy ones). I made 2 pounds worth and they went in no time! Also, made them the night before and they kept fine in a couple of large baggies (the basil didn't discolor)
