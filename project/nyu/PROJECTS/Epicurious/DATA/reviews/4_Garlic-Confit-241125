I looked into the risk of botulism and it seems serious with this recipe. It can be avoided by washing thoroughly, refrigeration, and adding one tbsp. lemon juice or vinegar to the oil during cooking. This prevents growth of the toxin. I read about it here: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/safefood/newsltr/v2n4s08.html

This was so easy and delicious. I used up most of it right away on nice bread with some cheese, broiled for just a few minutes. I will definitely make this again very soon. It was a little difficult to keep the garlic from browning, even on the lowest setting on my stove. I had to check it a lot and sometimes take it off the heat for a few minutes.

I've been making garlic confit for years. No one has ever gotten sick. Usually I make it with 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 canola oil and add pepper flakes and salt towards the end of cooking. Much better than any minced garlic you can buy in a jar.

It's great, but I, also, wondered about the risk of botulism. Perhaps the refrigeration and the advice to use in a month eliminates the risk.

Doesn't this run an extremely high risk of botulism?

Made this to give as gifts. Very easy to make but make sure you keep the flame very very low so they don't brown.
