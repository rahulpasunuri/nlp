I love this recipe! It is absolutely perfect for a cold night in the winter. I have used italian sausage and chicken sausage in this recipe but never kielbasa, so I want to try that next. Also I always use chicken breasts, even without browning the meat ahead of time it is delicious!

I didn't give this 4 forks, but that doesn't mean it isn't worthy. With a few modifications, it was definitely a 4 forker. I used chicken drumsticks and browned them before putting them in. I wouldn't recommend leaving out the tomato paste- I added a bit more than called for. I also substituted chili powder for red pepper flakes which worked out well. Parsnips were good in here and the chick peas were also essential. The couscous came out really fluffy and delicious. It needs salt, but that is usually the case in most recipes. I would definitely make this again.

I made a veggie version, but I just didn't love this -- although I think my partner will when he gets home. I didn't have any usable tomato paste -- would that have made all the difference?

This is a regular in our kitchen. Absolutely essential to brown the chicken and sausage first, however, and then drain the fat. Otherwise, too greasy.

I've been making this regularly since 1993. I prefer parsnip to turnip - makes it a little sweeter. Always a hit!

This is a regular winter dish at our household, but it is much better with a few modifications. We use chicken thighs and skin them. We brown the chicken and kielbasa slices and drain the fat from the pan before beginning the recipe as written. And we simmer the dish quite a bit longer than called for to allow the chicken to become tender and to make the turnips tastier. These modifications make the recipe take longer, but they are well worth it.

I also have tweaked this recipe to my liking. I used andouille sausage instead of keilbasa and leave the turnip out entirely. I use a zucchini and sometimes I add mushrooms.

The Pilao recipe is also keeper. Thank you!

This dish was good but not great. I had to add salt and it still seemed like something was missing. I just noticed that some similar recipes contain cumin and coriander -- might try adding those next time.

This was fantastic! With a few tweaks, it will be a 4-forker! Per suggestions, I subbed a potato for the parsnip... delish. Do not cut down on the pepper flakes... I added the recipe amt and it wasn't very spicy. Definitely add some salt and pepper; it needs it. Can't wait to try out different sausages!

My substitutions: I used 1/2 pound turky kielbasa and no chicken. Used celery as I didn't have turnips and chick peas. Also used extra pepper flakes, as I like things spicy. It also needed 1 cup couscous instead of 3/4 cup. Very nice flavor. This dish seemed to lends itself to whatever veggies are in the frig. Will make again.

This recipe is wonderful, but I did make one substitution that worked really well. I buy chicken when it goes on sale really cheap to make stock, and I keep the cooked meat frozen for soups, stews, echiladas, etc. So I used some of my 'stock chicken' instead of the chicken wings. I simply added it in with the chick peas. I was able to put more meat in the dish, and it was easier to eat!!

I substituted onion and pepper chicken sausage for the kielbasa, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Very flavorful, healthy and tasty, easy to make. I recommend trimming the fattiest parts of the skin on the wings off, but not all of it so that it doesn't dry out. I also suggest a bit of garlic and a dash of salt. Won't make this a staple in the house, but will make it again.

We doubled this recipe and had more than enough for 4 people with leftovers. I agree with the other reviewer that cutting the red-pepper is a mistake. We did the same thing and it was rather bland. Plus, we used Moroccan cinnamon sticks which are milder. But this is a keeper. We'll make it again for sure!

A very easy recipe, and very forgiving. I used 1 pound of chicken sausage, more carrots than the recipe called for, and mushrooms and new potatoes instead of turnips. I think I hedged a bit on the red-pepper flakes, and that was wrong. It needs the bite. The cinnamon was a nice touch. My 2 year old devoured this.

The sausage overpowered the dish too much. Next time I suggest removing the sausage, adding sauted garlic (6 chopped cloves), and substituting boneless skinless chicken breasts (cubed & seared).

At last! A quick and authentic couscous recipe. Next time I will add corinthian raisins as well.

This has become one if the most popular dishes for our family, and the easiest couscous recipe around. I would use 2 cups of water for the couscous though and let it stand longer. Even pre-cooked couscous keeps expanding much longer than all stated recipes admit.

Very easy and quick recipe. Nice blend of flavors. Don't get the tumeric under your fingernails. It'll never come out!

With kielbasa and all the skin on the chicken wings, this can get real greasy. In the future I'd use skinless chicken breast instead of chicken wings. Overall pretty tasty though.
