My usual "go to" recipe for Mexican meatball soup is the Mexican Meatball Soup (Bon Appetit, 12/2000) also on Epicurious. This Poblano Albondigas, which I've made once, is more labor intensive, but has a richer flavor. If I make it again, I would definitely double the rice, and I would reduce the amount of Ancho chile powder to 2 TBS, and then add to taste. (I used McCormick's ancho chile poweder.) The soup was a little too spicy for my husband's tastes. Also, the meatballs in this recipe tended to fall apart; using the other recipe they do not.

I added 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes to the base and upped the rice to about 1/2 cup. Made the meatballs pretty much according to the recipe except I only used 1 tsp. of cumin. Thought 1 tbls. might be overpowering. Topped each bowl with lime juice, chopped cilantro and diced avocado. Fantastic!

This is a flavorful recipe but I agree with others that the cumin overwhelms the rest of the flavors. I made this a second time, adjusting the cumin to 1 teaspoon in both the meatballs and soup. I also added slices of avocado to the soup just before serving. It was a much better dish to serve the second time around.

After searching all over San Diego for the best bowl of Albondigas, we gave up and decided to try it ourselves...I followed this recipe pretty much as it was written. The amount of cumin was just right,as well as the ancho powder. The Poblano chiles are well worth the time to roast and peel etc, don't take the easy way out and use canned green chiles, it is a whole different flavor! I added carrots and half cobs of corn, as this is the way it's done in S. Calif! It was delicious, the cilantro and lime on top are just another layer of goodness! Will definitely keep this recipe in my book!

This was a mix of hits and misses. We used canned mild green chiles in the meatballs; they have always proved much easier to use than roasting and peeling peppers. I doubt that sub caused it, but our meatballs totally fell apart while simmering. And like some other reviewers, we had a "fat slick" floating on top of the finished product. (I never got that from Italian Wedding or similar meatball soups) There was too much ancho chili powder, but that allowed me to discover its flavor. I think ancho will make a much better chili con carne than normal chili powder. And for some strange reason, the amount of chili powder seemed to talk all the flavor of salt away. Despite everything, I will say this: the soup WAS tasty. I doubt I'll ever make this particular recipe again, but I did learn a lot from it.

Loved this recipe. But I tweaked everything. haha. For the meatballs I used ground turkey, I omitted the poblano chiles, zucchini, and cumin. I substituted the chiles with a bit of serrano chiles, zucchini with carrots, and cumin with paprika and black pepper. For the soup I omitted the cumin and substituted with more powder chile. I added potatoes, carrots and corn to the soup. And also substituted the beef broth with chicken. And I didnt bother with the tortilla chips. I used avocado for toppings. Best albondigas I've made so far. I'm sure following the recipe would be delicious too, I just didnt have the ingredients.

Using what I already had: lean ground turkey instead of beef, red pepper instead of poblano chiles, finely chopped celery and grated potatoes instead of zucchini, and sprouted wheat breadcrumbs instead of panko. For a rainy Sunday afternoon, and not wanting to leave the house, I think it turned out very well. I think the measurements for the cumin were just fine, unlike some of the other reviewers. I did skimp on the salt and I used low-salt vegetable broth instead of beef broth. I also didn't have any cilantro in the house and traded lemon for the lime. Great to freeze and eat left-over as well!!

We will make this again. I used 22% fat ground beef and it was too fatty. Leftovers were great with fat skimmed off. My husband was melting from the spice, but I didnt detect any so added lots of Cholula! I used about 1.5 lbs meat so we'd have more meatballs. Loved avocado on top!

Loved this recipe. My family requests it regularly.

I really liked the soup base, but I wasn't too impressed with the meatballs. I would suggest cutting back on the cumin in the meatballs and I would prefer pork over beef in the future. I agree with others that there needs to be more rice.

The broth was delightful and super easy to make. The meatballs could have used a bit more salt. I think next time I will add chipotles to them for a little extra flavor.

I had higher hopes for this one as albondigas soup has been a favorite at our house for many years and thought that the addition of roasted poblano and crispy tortilla strips would be a great touch. Agree with other reviewers that the spice is a bit out of balance and the soup overall needs more substance. For the "leftovers" I added some frozen corn and sliced zucchini and it was much improved. Agree that some diced tomatoes would be good. I'll still probably go back to my own Albondigas Soup - to be posted soon!!

I had high hopes for this, but we couldn't even eat this. There was WAY too much cumin in the meatballs. My internal alarm was going off using it and just a pound of ground beef. I didn't even put the cumin in the broth so we at least had that with a jalapeno - cheese piece of bread. Lived in the SW for a LONG time, but this was just WAY WAY too much cumin. So all those meatballs hit the trash. Which is SUCH a waste. We can normally "eat" things that don't turn out quite right, but this was just nasty.

A great recipe. It does take a while to do all the steps, but well worth the result. I cut back on the quantities of some of the spices in the meatballs . . for instance, a tablespoon of dried cumin is fairly extreme. Let's just say you won't have any trouble picking out the flavor. same goes for Mexican oregano . . it is potent stuff. But if you like your flavors brash and bold, the recipe quantities will work.

A delicious crowd pleaser - 6 people with disparate tastes all enjoyed them. Used New Mexican chile powder when I could not find the ancho. I see the logic in using more rice to make a heartier soup.

Very tasty, and not greasy if you use 15% fat ground beef as instructed. Ancho powder easily available at at Mexican market.

Canned Chile Poblanos, already charred, peeled and sliced into strips are available in Latin grocery stores. We poach the meatballs in boiling lightly salted water with a sprig of mint,thus providing the broth for the soup. In another soup pot sautee chopped onions until they are translucent. Slowly add two cups of pureed tomatoes and stiring slowly cook until they are 'orange' in colour. Carefully add meat balls, and the broth required. Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes. Correct the seasoning. These same meatballs are delicious served in salsa (hot of course) over "arroz a la mexicana." Serve with "bolillos" or freshly made hot tortillas.

Very flavorful soup. Lotsa meatballs. It seemed a little thin though. I agree with adding more rice and some corn. Maybe a can of black beans too.

I really liked this soup. It was not greasy -- I used ground sirloin and not ground beef for the meatballs. McCormick makes the Ancho Chili Powder and the only grocery store that carries it in my area is Kroger. I also added a little Chipotle Chili Pepper, too. For the soup, I always sautee my onions till golden (8-10 minutes), then add garlic. I julienned my zucchini and then cut into 1/2" pieces. I also added finely chopped yellow, orange and red bell peppers for color, as well as sliced mushrooms.Great spicy soup and delicious meatballs. As another viewer suggested, corn might add to the soup -- roasted corn, no less!

This soup was excellent! The ancho chile powder is definately work seeking out. Served with flour tortillas for dipping and diced avocado. The broth was so tasty - next time I would add a little more rice to the broth!

I was shocked at how greasy this soup was. The fat from the ground beef really made the broth very oily. I would not make it again.

This is an insane meal served with spanish style flat bread and a good glass of wine. Poker Guys are now Meatball Soup Fans! This is a hell yeah i will make it again recipe!

This soup was very good. I will definitly make it again. I thought the meatballs were excellent. Next time, I will probably add a bit more rice and and a cut up zucchini to the actual soup base itself. Give it a try.

This soup was good - liked the meatballs the best. I added more rice, but there is something missing in the broth base.

Yum! Made this as directed except I didn't have the ancho chili powder, so I used 2 Tbsp of regular chili powder and I Tbsp of smoked paprika. A little more rice is a good idea--I'll do that next time...and there will be a next time!

Great recipe, though finding the ancho chile powder was hard! Ended up making my own from dried ancho chiles sold at my local hispanic food store. I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the rice and added a can of corn - both of which made it a more substantial soup. While this was not a time intensive recipem, if you are short on time, I would use canned green chiles instead of roasting your own poblano and use store bought tortilla strips. Great weeknight meal that I will definitely be making again!

I think it was definitely lacking something as well. I will try it again. The meatballs were definitely the best part of the soup. I broiled mine first to eliminate some of the fat. I also added extra pasilla chile to the broth. Corn might be a good, traditional ingredient to add. I also prefer my soups to have a bit more body . . . I would definitely make the meatballs again, maybe in another recipe.

This was a hearty soup but not heavy  the addition of zucchini really lightened the meatballs. We added a roasted jalapeno to the meatballs and kept some of the poblano strips to throw into the broth mixture. I also toasted the cumin before grinding it which always seems to give a nicer flavor. After sautéing the corn tortilla strips, we sprinkled them with sea salt and added diced avocado to top the soup. Served with tamarind margaritas  it was a lovely way to end the holidays. .

Made this last night and while tasty, it was lacking something....not flavor-wise but ingredients...I think if I make it again, I would add some diced tomatoes, and even a tad more rice. I used basmati and it added a bit of bulk, but given the amount of stock-vs- the quantity of rice called for, I would increase it. Still, it warmed us up on a really cold night!

A hearty cold weather soup. The flavor was excellent. We liked the addition of the rice (we used brown rice) for the additional body it gave the soup. We served it with a salad and fresh cornbread for a satisfying meal. The only addition we made was some thin slices of avocado for garnish.
