The smelllllllll......OMG, the only things i added were daun salam instead of bay, and red pepper flakes instead of peppercorns. THIS will make PERRRRFECT scampi. Or something?..... And look, dont sweat it, i threw the head in, and the tail, n everything. Onion skin, scraps from the freezer collection. You get it.

Time consuming - Are you kidding me? Simple stock recipe but add an onion, 3 stalks of celery, 2 carrots, bay leaf, whole pepper corns and whole corriander seeds. Cook uncovered for at least 2 hours then strain. Cook it even longer to make a concentrate and freeze it in an ice cube tray.

The flavor is exquisite! Making the soup is simple but very time consuming. However, the homemade fish stock is well worth the time if you want something really special. Also, it would be easy to make the stock in advance and freeze it.
