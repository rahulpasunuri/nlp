Definitely use fresh raspberries if you can. I added a couple of tablespoons of Chambord. Amazing on mousse inside of a meringue nest.

Just wonderful with the Chocolate Mousse.

Don't forget to let the raspberries defrost before you begin or this will take more time than you anticipated. It is fantastic!

I made this recipe as a topping for a cheesecake I made from this site. I followed the recipe at the bottom using fresh raspberries. My raspberries were a bit tart, so I had to use a little more sugar. Also since using as a topping to a cheesecake, I also added a cornstarch slurry at the end to thicken it up a bit. All in all it turned out nice, with good flavor.

Very quick and easy but, like the other reviewer said, make sure you have defrosted the raspberries. It is also much nicer if you allow the sugar to dissolve into the raspberries for about a 1/2 hour before you blitz them. To make straining it easier, use the back of a ladle in the strainer and work in a circular motion. In no time, the seeds will collect into a ball and the coulis will drip into the bowl.

Quite easy to make and worked well with a cheesecake. Very tart. It didn't strain well through a sieve, but squeezing it through cheesecloth got the job done (although it was a bit messy).

Super easy, super tasty...I'm thinking of just quietly eating the leftovers with a spoon!

Great over vanilla ice cream

Great basic coulis. Only, the recipe should mention that the frozen raspberries should be thawed first, otherwise you will end up with a paste which will become a coulis once it thaws.

I made this raspberry coulis to top a baked brie. It makes a beautiful appetizer. Just wrap a round of brie in about 10 layers of phyllo dough brushed with melted butter. Bake until golden and top with fresh raspberrries, green apple slices and the raspberry coulis. Very impressive appetizer! The coulis ties it all together.

So simple and delicious. I couldn't find frozen raspberries in syrup, so I used 2 1/2 cups of frozen whole raspberries and added about a 1/4 cup water and increased the sugar only slightly. A good compliment for key lime cheesecake.

Added mint as per another poster, it was terrific. I used frozen raspberries with no sryup so I used the sugar guide for fresh berries. I found it needed a bit more, maybe 1/8c or so. This got better reviews than the cheesecake I made for it to go on. It is also terrific on vanilla ice cream.

Good basic recipe. I found that adding some fresh chopped mint jazzed it up - and I'm thinking about adding lemon verbena next time. I layered this with fresh citrus fruit slices (a mixture of orange, satsumo tangerines, blood oranges, ruby red grapefruit) and everyone at the Easter brunch loved it!

It was great. I made this to go with the lemon cheesecake with shortbread crust and it complimented it perfectly.

I'd try to find a different recipe. This didn't turn out so well for me- although it was probably my fault!

I used frozen raspberries and served it on ice cream for the kids and as a sauce with pound cake for the adults--a really bright flavor.
