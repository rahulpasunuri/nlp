I couldn't find chocolate wafers so I bought Nilla wafers and put dark cocoa powder in after I ground them. I also upped the peanut butter (crunchy) with an extra 3/4 cup. The springform pan was a great idea from previous cook. This recipe is so good! I hope my husband enjoys this version over the cream cheese version his mom makes for his birthday!!!

Excellent! The pie was light and not too sweet, unlike the cream cheese version I've made which was way too sweet, heavy and with a twang from the cheese. I made a graham cracker crust instead of the chocolate wafer one. It was very good with the fillling. I increased the chopped peanuts to 1/2 cup also. Next time I serve this, I plan on drizzling chocolate syrup on each serving and on the dessert plate.

I have made this pie several times and have always about doubled the peanut butter. I do the same when I make peanut butter cookies. Trick I learned from one of the chef's I worked with, if you add a bit of oil (about a teaspoon or two) to your chocolate and then melt it, it is so much easier to cut the pie later. Try it, it really works.

This recipe is phenomenal! Every time I make it, I get requests for the recipe. I make the "inside" exactly as the recipe states. For the crust though, I use Oreo cookies -- about 3/4 of the box -- chopped in the food processor. No need to scrape the middles out of the cookies before chopping. Mix with a stick of melted butter and you are good to go! I make this pie in a springform pan, so it is extra deep and thick. YUMMY!

Kids said it was "too peanut buttery". I think it needed more chocolate - perhaps a chocolate topping would suffice. Will try again, but next time with the aforementioned sauce.

Thought this pie would be richer. Maybe I didn't mix it enough - but the consistency was strange and the peanut pieces made it stranger. Not very swwet or rich - tasted like frozen milk with peanut butter mixed in.

This pie was stupendous, period. Most time, when I write a review for an epicurious recipe, I have additions or deletions to report, but not here. It is perfect as is. My husband announced in protest (before I baked it)that he wasn't going to have any because he wanted something else (I have three kids who wanted this!) but he ended up raving. It is not two sweet, incredibly easy, looks beautiful and the crust is fabulous. I am too ignorant about piping and all that, so I just sprinkled the crumbs and put whole peanuts on top of the crumbs and all around the edge about an inch apart. It looked great. PS I first wrote the above comments a year ago--I have to add something now. I promised a colleague that I'd make this for his birthday and the store was out of chocolate wafers. So I bit the bullet and bought oriole sandwich cookies and scraped off the white inside stuff with a sharp knife. It only took about 15-20 minutes and the crust was so much better, richer and darker than with the wafers. I increase the crust amount (the crumbs I mean) by 1/4 cup or so cause the thicker crusts are popular when you are dealing with cookie crumbs!

This pie is ambrosia! Not only is it delumptious, it has magical power! Trust me! Try this pie! You'll swoon! The pie is fun to make. I love the fact that it does not require cream cheese, so it's not too rich. I used a graham cracker crust instead of the chocolate, and used cool whip instead of making whipped cream. So, I cheated a little. Next time, I'll follow the recipe and use real whipped cream and chocolate crust.

Wonderful! I first made this recipe about 5 years ago, and lost it in a move a few years back. I was thrilled to see it on this website, and have made it a few times since. Probably incredibly high in fat, but definitely worth it!
