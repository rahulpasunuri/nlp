Great dressing! I love salads with greens & fruit. I'll make this again, for sure.

The dressing was great i don't like endive so i used fennel instead. Orange and fennel are great together.

I added sliced hearts of palm and subbed rice wine vinegar for the wh. wine vinegar. It was delicious. An easy salad that looks pretty on a brunch table.

I only made the vinaigrette, which I used over watercress. It was a nice accompaniment to the scallops with bacon and haricots verts from the April 2004 edition of Bon Appetit (not yet on this site at this writing). I tend only to eyeball, and my dressing was a little too liquidy - definitely need to step up the olive oil. I imagine this might be delicious with some fresh thyme and/or a small amount of rosemary if served over nonbitter greens, or cold poached shrimp with greens.
