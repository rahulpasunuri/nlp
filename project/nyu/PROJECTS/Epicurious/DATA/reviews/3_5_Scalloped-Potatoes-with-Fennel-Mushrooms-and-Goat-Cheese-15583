Came out very well but just slightly bland. Added fresh thyme and rosemary to the milk mixture. With just a little added heat this will be a go to for taking to dinner parties.

This was very good. Be sure to let the sauce thicken a little more before mixing it in with potatoes, etc. My fennel slices weren't that thin and they cooked through fine. Thought it was a delicious side.

We loved this, albeit with some changes. After reading the critique of the cook from Florida, I sauteed the fennel first. To make it low fat, I used a combination of low fat products: chicken broth, coconut milk, and sour cream. Yum!

I was unforunately disappointed with this dish. It has everything in it I love but the end result was a bust. I followed instructions to the letter but the fennel never got tender (my slices were extremely thin). I try new things all the time and my whole family (5) didn't like it. It was way too runny also. Unless someone can explain to me what may have happened, I'd never make this again.

This dish was a big hit at a party. Definitely a nice change from the basic scalloped potatoes.

Very yummy cold weather food. Reheats nicely.
