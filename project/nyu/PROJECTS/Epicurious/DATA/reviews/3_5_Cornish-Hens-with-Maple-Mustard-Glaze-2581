This was very tasty, simple & easy. My only complaint is that the skin never crisped but I expected that, at the end of cooking I set it under the broiler for about 3 minutes just to brown it a little more to make it look better & caramelize. Alton brown once said on his TV show, "don't bast your turkey" because the skin will turn out soggy. Due to Alton's advice, as a rule I generally don't baste any type foul. But I did baste it according to the directions in this recipe anyway. I doubled the amount of sauce I made and I'm very glad I did. I basted bird 3X's with a brush {every 20 min. = 60 min.total not using up all the sauce.}While the hens were resting after I took them out I added the pan juices to the leftover basting sauce in a little saucepan and cooked it to kill any raw chicken residue left from basting & reduced it until slightly thickened. This resulting sauce was delicious over the hen meat! I will always double the sauce in in future meals of this recipe. This is slightly sweet and something I think children would also like along with adults, use pure maple syrup don't skimp with that fake stuff. My Husband and I each ate 1/2 bird, we are saving the other bird for our dinner tomorrow night! A 'weeknight Keeper' although not fancy enough for entertaining guests.

Exceptional! Easy! I loved this dish. It took me about 5 minutes to make the sauce. The ingredients are easy to find in one's pantry and the active time is minimal. I added a touch of 5 spice powder to the maple syrup glaze, as well as used a maple pepper I had to season the birds. I cooked mine for about 48 minutes (they were all natural, Bell & Evans birds) and they were perfect (juicy, sweet, and amazing!). I glazed 3 times throughout the cooking time (using additional sauce I made - double the glaze recipe.. or even 3x it just to glaze / baste the bird). Enjoy!!!

Very tasty and extremely easy to prepare - here are a couple of thoughts: 1) cornish hens from the regular market are pretty large - you might consider splitting the bird before cooking, then 1 bird can feed two people, 2) I don't think an hour is enough time, esp if you are convection roasting - next time I make this i will likely plan on at least 1.25 min to cook.

This was so good and easy! We used chicken breast and broiled it. We will add this as a regular for a quick weekday dinner.

Good Recipe. I used both marinade (3-5 hrs) and glazing the birds. In the end, there was a 'hint' of flavor in the meat. I don't like the flavor to over power the meat. It was just right. I did cook on Conv. Oven at 360 for 1hr. With a temp of 180 degrees internal temp.

Wonderful recipe. I took other cook's suggestions and marinated (made marinade of syrup, mustard, fresh thyme, salt and pepper - no butter). Also, butterflied the hens. Vacuum sealed for 2 1/2 hours in the marinade then threw on pre-heated grill. Cooked around 25 minutes, got a great char to the skin, allowed to sit under foil for 10 minutes and served. Beautiful and great flavor.

I made this recipe to serve 130 people at a club dinner. I planned one hen per person. The hens I got were large so most people took half of it home. Everyone raved about how moist and flavorful the chickens were. I marinated them for about 3 hours prior to baking. I served with rice pilaf and roasted asparagus. A big success!

Wow, I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was "blah" and the smell of dried thyme baking smelled terrible I'm surprised so many folks liked it.

Doesn't get any easier. And I found the dish flavorful even without marinating prior to (well, I should say the skin was flavorful!). Will become a staple in my home.

This recipe was so simple and so good I cant wait to make it again! I did make extra sauce first and marinated the hens in it for a few hours. I also added a little bit of minced garlic to the cavity.

I used this recipe the very first time I made a cornish hen dinner for my boyfriend. That was 10 years ago, and this has turned into one of our favorites; he always requests it. The juices make a great gravy, so I always make some garlic mashed potatoes as a side dish. Turns out perfectly, every time!

Simple, delicious and elegant. Loved by adults and children... this is a winner. I like the idea of marinating in the sauce first. Deepens the flavor.

This was delicious on a cold winter's night. We served with stewed mushrooms (Bon Appetit)at a dinner party & it was a big hit.

A crowd-pleaser with the kids and adults alike. I make extra sauce and pour a little over the hen before serving. No one wants to have them any other way.

Maple syrup adds a wonderful, rich flavor! I brined the hens for an hour in equal parts brown sugar and kosher salt, 2 quarts water, then butterflied them. Moist and delicious.

The first time I used this recipe I thought it was a bit useless because I could barely taste the glaze. It just wasn't enough flavor for me. But I decided to try it again and use the sauce as a marinade and I have grown to love it. I trippled the sause and marinated the hens for about 3 1/2 hrs. You might want to do it longer, but it turns out great. Also make additional glaze to drizzle over the hens once they are served. TRY IT. It's great.

Make this but triple the ammount of the glaze to use along with crispy, fried corn fritters. I also made whipped turnips and rutabega - A nice green salad with a hazel nut oil and balsamic vinegar dressing is a nice compliment- Since the hens are so easy you can spend additionl time on thes side dishes!

I used the rotisserie on my gas grill to cook the hens for about 50 minutes and basted regularly with the glaze. Although the hens were very tender, the glaze added next to nothing to their flavor. Taste was very bland unless eating the skin which we no longer do. I agree with the cook from Boston...the glaze would be far better on pork or served on the side so that it can be enjoyed.

We loved the glaze from this recipe. It's even better with pork tenderloin. In fact, the glaze can be doubled and drizzled as sauce over the meat once it's served. This really kicks up the flavor of the glaze, as much of it does tend to dissipate in the oven. Very simple to make. I'll definitely do it again.

IT was good, but not very flavorful - you could hardly taste the glaze. If I try it again, I would baste with glaze throughout cooking.

I agree with the other reviewers that this is a very easy recipe but it lacks taste. I didn't eat the skin so that is probably why I didn't even taste the glaze. The hens were tender but boring. There is no point in making this again.

I made this last night for Valentine's Day dinner and it was very good. It was also very easy and, except for the hens, used ingredients I almost always have on hand. Elegant and easy, my two favorite things!

Made them for Thanksgiving Dinner with the Wild Rice with Wild Mishrooms recipe! It's definitely a winner!

oh how easy is this to make! With 3 kids, I look for easy recipes, and this is one of them! I look forward to making again! I swear, since I found epicurious.com, my husband thinks Julia Childs lives in my basement!!

I have made this recipe a number of times. Each time it turn out be really enjoyable. Wild rice cooked in half chicken stock and half orange juice is an excellent compliment. The hens and the maple syrup/mustard glaze add a distinctive taste that is sure to please. It can be made for a large group of people with the same ease of preparation that you might have in making just for two. A sophiticated, but simple, dinner menu. Try steamed artichokes as a starter and a simple tossed green salad with a balsamic and olive oil dressing. Sure to please your most discriminating guests.
