This is a GREAT recipe! Simple, unique flavor and presentation. The black sesame seeds add a nice crunch to the rice.

Great recipe. Nice flavor and great presentation. Have made this multiple times for company and family. My son loves it. Great with fish!

I gave this 4 stars because it's simple and tasty enough for a side dish with a main course that is very flavorful and you want something with great presentation and doesn't take away from the main dish. I served it with swordfish. Also, you can make ahead and just reheat last minute which is great if you have alot going on for your dinner. I also cut the sesame seeds in half. Great find!

I found the sesame seeds to be a bit excessive--I had to go back and check the recipe to make sure I hadn't made a mistake. But it really does say "tablespoons" there. If I made it again, I'd use half the amount.

I made it to accompany sea bass with oriental sauce (from epicurious) and it was perfect. The presentation is so beautiful. I will definitely make it for company.

This was so easy--and made for a great presentation. I prepared several hours ahead. Placed a few chive spears on the bottom of the ramekins before filling. Let them sit at room temp for about 4 hours. Zapped them in the micro for a couple of minutes, inverted them & they looked sooo pretty! The toasted sesame oil makes it. Without it, it's just plain ol' rice. Great comments from guests! So easy for a great touch!

This is easy to make and but impressive when served. Great addition to chicken or fish dishes. I've served it a number of times and always receive high compliments. Try it!

Excellent. I didn't have white sesame seeds on hand, so I used toasted black sesame instead. The rice turned out beautiful; I think I will continue using black seeds even though they are more flavorful. This recipie is definitely a keeper!

These turned out perfectly! I love it when that happens. This is a great accompaniment to lots of dishes, especially anything that hints of Asian.

This rice was served at a dinner party I attended as an accompaniment to salmon. It was delicious. As I wasn't the cook, I can't comment on the ease or difficulty of the preparation, but the end result was very good. Everybody enjoyed it quite a bit. Thanks!

What did I do wrong? The rice was so gummy, I pitched it and started over with long grain rice, butter and chicken broth.

Very unique, classy dish. My guests were suitable impressed. Makes way more than 6 servings. Next time I will make half the recipe and put them in smaller custard dishes. Don't give up on the sesame oil...it gives the unique flavour.

I love this rice dish. Not only is it simple to prepare, its clean simple flavor is outstanding. The sesame oil is a "must" ingredient.

A good idea, and an elegant way to serve rice. Next time I will omit the sesame oil, it has a tendency to burn and I wasn't wild about the flavor. Also - I will add more salt next time, this definitely needed more salt. A great accompaniment to the sea bass with coconut-curry sauce (this website)

I modified this dish by removing the sesame oil and only using 1/2 tsp. margarine instead of the suggested amount of butter. The rice was cooked in the microwave with the margarine added. Then, I added garlic chives and the sesame seeds. (I did not compact the rice in a dish. I just served the main dish atop the rice.) Served with steamed broccolini and grilled, sliced sirloin steak w/ oriental dipping sauce and wasabi. Awesome!

Rice dish with attitude! Perfect pairing with the Mahi-mahi with Macadamia Nut Crust. Compose a tropical fruit salsa on the side. Light the candles, pour a chardonnay and enjoy fine dining at home.

I decreased the oil and didn't make the individual timbales. An outstanding side dish to a Japanese meal. Try it with the miso salmon! I found black sesame seeds for $1.69 on homegrocer.com, in case anyone is having trouble finding them.

I think that this is a wonderfully simple side dish with a great presentation -- and great flavor.

great colour & texture addition to the plate. I couldn't find black sesame seeds so I substituted poppy seeds instead

A great look for the plate that tastes that little bit more special than just plain steamed rice. Very easy to do.
