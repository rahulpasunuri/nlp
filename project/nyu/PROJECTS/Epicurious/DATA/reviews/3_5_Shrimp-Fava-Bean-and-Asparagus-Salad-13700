I made this without the shrimp and it was delicious. The dressing is great for other types of salads as well.

I used a coarse Dijon and reduced the honey per the reviews. I've never had favas before and this was the recipe to try them with! Also, no fresh tarragon to be had, so I used dill. The dressing was wonderful.

My family and I love this salad. I have to make it EVERY Easter since '97. Back then I used fresh fava beans, however I've discovered that there are frozen favas to be had, and they are just as good. I also use frozen shrimp. Totally tastes like spring!

Make it simple. Use canned fava beans, frozen shrimp and mesclun salad. Next time I would use chopped green onions rather than chives.

Made the recipe with green beans instead of asparagus. Good flavor, but a little too sweet. Added additional teaspoon of mustard, and next time will use just a drop of honey. Also let the shrimp marinate a while in separate bowl with dressing. Yum!

I made this quickly for supper tonight - very nice! I used green beans instead of fava beans and fresh dill instead of tarragon. Also, frozen cooked shrimp made it easy. Served with fresh bread and rhubarb crisp.

This salad was great....however, the fava beans were a lot of work, as I was cooking for 14!! However, I'd do it again in a minute for 4! I added fresh black-eyed peas for a bit more interest, they could probably be substituted entirely if you didn't have time to do the fava beans. The use of fresh herbs is essential to make the dressing one to remember!
