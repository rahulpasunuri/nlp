This is an easy and elegant choice for bread and contrasts well with almost any fine dinner. I made the dough ahead of time and spooned it into a pastry bag and refrigerated until 1/2 hour before serving my meal. I piped them into generous rounds and baked them. Timing was perfect and they were all eaten up!

I grew up on gougeres in the 70s and 80s - my mother is a sophisticated cook! - so I've made these many times. This recipe omits an important step, which is to brush formed mounds with egg wash before baking for a beautiful golden shine and top with more grated Gruyere for a crispy, cheesy top. I also remember forming them with a second, smaller mound on top of the larger mounds, like a two-tiered free-form snowman.

I've made this receipe multiple times and never had a problem. Yes, you do have to make sure you beat the eggs in full. I've never had a problem wtih a thin or runny batter. I've made them in advance to bring to parties where we just reheat them according to the receipe. These little treats are always a hit.

I haven't tried this version, but here are some tips for successful gougere: Taste the cheese. If it's very salty, go easy on the added salt, and vice-versa. You only need to cook the dough on the stove for a couple of minutes, to cook the raw flour taste out. The real trick to getting good "puff" is to beat your eggs well. I use a kitchen aid mixer with the paddle attachment. Stir the hot dough to help it cool for a minute, then turn up the speed and add the eggs one at a time, making sure the dough turns smooth after each addition. Then stir in the cheese. You can also add the pepper to the water/butter at first. That's how I do it. I add minced fresh herbs in with cheese. A few tablespoons should suffice. Use parchment-lined sheet pans and pipe the dough to get uniform shapes. Try attaching a piping coupler to a freezer bag. no tip is needed. The hole in the coupler is the perfect size. Pipe them about the size of a quarter for more bite- size treats. Brush with an eggwash for a beautiful shine. Make sure your oven is hot. I bake mine at 400' for about 15 minutes. If you're baking ahead of time, keep in mind that reheating will brown them further. Once the puffs are cool, freeze them in freezer bags for a few months & have them on hand for impromptu guests. Reheat at 350' for about 5 min. Enjoy!

Give this recipe a try! It's incredibly easy and will impress friends and family. Very easy to eat three of four of these little delights without feeling full. They don't keep well, best eaten there and then (which isn't hard to do!). Interested in playing with the recipe by adding crumbled bacon or chives.

Ok, I made these again and found out it was my mistake they turned out like cookies the first time! I used the ole' kitchen aid this time, and figured out I didn't beat it nearly well enough last time. This time, they are killer, nuff' said.

Mine also turned out like flat cookies! Maybe it was from beating in the eggs with the hand mixer? They were tasty though, but ugly!

I found this to be the best recipe for gougeres yet. Those who said the dough was too thin probably did not cook it long enough. Mine were perfect piping consistency and rose beautifully. I had always beaten the eggs in by hand and felt like I had done 100 push-ups! Loved using the mixer.

Easy and delicious-it was hard not to eat the whole batch in one sitting. Come to think of it, I think we did.

I made this recipe for my mom's 50th birthday party. Was the hit of the party. I totally recommend this for any gathering.

While I agree with the comments that the texture is not what I expected, they were so delicious and simple to make that I have to rave. I brought a huge bowl full of them to a get-together and they were gone in a few minutes. Everyone referred to them as "addictive."

I loved them but it was almost like cookies. when my sister and aunt made them I said I don't like them but I did. But next time we will follow the real thing

My grandniece and I agree with the other reviewers who said the batter was too runny and that the gougeres came out like puffy cookies (She said the recipe should be renamed "gourgere cookies") Mark Bittman's recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of flour and three eggs. This recipe called for 1 cup of flour and 4 eggs which why the batter was too runny. Next time we'll try Bittman's recipe.

Made these for a Mother's Day brunch and was satisfied with the results, if not overly thrilled. I have a question: about how long did it take the dough to pull together in a ball and form a film on the bottom of the pan? I'm not sure I cooked the dough on the stovetop long enough, and maybe that's why the dough was so thin.

Mine also turned out runny and flat, taste was good, but not the appearance I expected. Will compare to other recipes.

i made these a few hours ahead for a dinner party. they reheated beautifully. my guests loved the texture and gruyere flavour of the gougeres.

My guests ate these up, but my dough was too runny, and they never really raised (looked more like puffy cookies). I will make these again, but I will beat the eggs in with a wooden spoon and not an electric mixer. My other cream puff recipe has the same ratio of liquid/flour and is done by hand and I've never had the "runny" problem. Hopefully that will be the trick next time.

I will make these again for sure because while they were yummy, I'm not sure I did them correctly. My dough seems runnier than expected. I noticed another reviewer on here said the same thing. I made them to accompany some onion soup, they were wonderful, and the leftovers were great reheated for breakfast the next day.

I made these as an appetizer for Easter dinner. They were wonderful with wine as described in the article. Easy and satisfying to bake, rich and fun to eat.

oh my dear they are so delicious and easy to make. i think next time i may add a little extra salt though.

i had a problem with the dough - it seemed like there was too much flour for the water, so i ended up adding more water. it worked fine, and i see that nobody else has had this problem, so maybe i made an error measuring? either way, they were good - super light and airy :)

These were really good and so simple to make. My two year old loved them. I think it will be a "go to" recipe for me since I am basically a flop at yeast breads.

Easy, great with a glass of wine. These freeze beautifully, just take straight from the freezer and pop into the toaster oven. A sophisticated appetizer

Really easy recipe that wowed everyone! Most everyone took one and went back for 2 more. This will become a staple for me.

These were delicious but mine didn't puff up all the way. I baked for 30 min and they were golden when I took them out, but about half the puffiness compared to the photo. Does anyone have any idea why?

These are great! The prep is easy-- just like the recipe described. The final batter looks thin, and I was worried about how the final product was going to be, but they puffed up and browned beautifully. I did use Parmesan cheese instead of the recommended cheese, and they were a bit too salty--i would cut down on the salt if you use a salty cheese. My five-year-old LOVED them, he asked for more and told me to make them all the time :-) I think I'd like to make them for breakfast-- omit the cheese so it could be sweet. I love this as a fast home- made bread.

Made these tonight, just because I could--I was inspired to do so by the article that accompanied the recipe in the magazine. The gougeres lived up to my expectations: easy to make, tasty, and fun to eat. I think they'll become part of my repertoire. YUM!

This was simple to make and served warm they have a nice consistency and flavor. would make again. However, i think they could use a little something, might try a different cheese next time. overall though yummy!
