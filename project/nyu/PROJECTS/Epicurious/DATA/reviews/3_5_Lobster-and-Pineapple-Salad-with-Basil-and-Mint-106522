I like the concept of the salad - I picked this recipe because of lime, basil, mint and chiles combination but overall the salad was kind of bland. If I were to make it again (too many other recipes I would put ahead of this one), I would reduce the pineapple & sweetness (I'm not a sweet person) to give the lime and chile a chance to stand out more. It needed more tang and sharpness. Make sure you have enough people to eat the salad because it will NOT keep. The directions are correct, 30 minutes and it starts turning mushy & mangles the flavor of the lobster.

This was light and refreshing. Used as a summer main course it was both delicious and visually impressive. Prep time is only about 20 minutes. Definitely don't combine the lobster meat and pineapple mixture until ready to serve to keep the lobster at its best. This is an great guest worthy entree.

I made it with shrimp but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Light, tasty meal.

A nice, light and pretty meal for a luncheon. I substituted using what I had on hand, crab meat for the lobster, celery for the bell pepper and anchovy paste for the asian fish sauce. I served it as a luncheon where one member was a vegetarian (seafood only). Everyone raved!

Beautiful, delicious! To cut down on time I substituted three 12 oz lobster tails which worked great. It's so good there won't be leftovers. Besides, the lobster turns mushy after sitting in the dressing overnight.

Very, very impressive. I made it for Valentine's Day dinner!

Very classy and delicious recipe. Will definitely make it again, and will probably add a little cilantro and salt.

This is one of our all time favorite recipes. I often subtitute shrimp for lobster so as to keep the cost down. Plus, the shrimp aren't as quickly effected by the pineapple enzymes. It is a perfect romantic dinner, light, flavorful, and exotic.

What a great, fresh salad. Nice combination of sweet and spicy with the pineapple and the serrano chili. Impressive presentation and pretty easy to make. My wife has already requested it for her birthday dinner.

Why does everyone think lobster can only be eaten boiiled and served with drawn butter. Think outside the box and live a little. We made this for six of our best friends. Thirty minutes to make if you boil your lobsters earlier in the day. Use real sea water if you can - nothing tastes better. A wonderful appetizer. Will definitely make it again but only with Atlantic lobsters - not spinies. They are too dry!!

This recipe is simply flawless. Although, it is not an easy mission to obtain quality seafood (originally, I am from Croatian coast) in Minneapolis, my thanks goes to Coastal Seafoods for freshly caught live lobsters. After I made it for my girlfriend and few people, her roommate, who is a chef, liked it so much he introduced it as a wine tasting menu at his restaurant. The flavors melt in your mouth. Would be great as a Valentine's dish.
