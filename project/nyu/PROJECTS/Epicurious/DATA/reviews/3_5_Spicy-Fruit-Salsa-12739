very good, very easy. i didn't have any mint, and didn't miss it. then again, i don't know what i missed. i upped the jalapeno, skipped the sugar, and threw in some fresh lime juice. served over grilled chicken on a bed of spinach. excellent.

I added chopped plums, nectarines, peaches, apricots, watermelon and doubled the peppers and tripled the mint. To this I added one small diced red onion and 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro along with some salt and pepper. I needed no sugar with all of the ripe fruit. The results were great.

What a great blend of flavors! I have made this dish several times. I usually increase the peppers and the mint. (Some, like me, love it HOT, HOT, HOT). No need to measure anything, just toss in what you have. So far, everyone has loved this recipe. Adjust (or omit) sugar depending on ripeness, sweetness of available fruit.
