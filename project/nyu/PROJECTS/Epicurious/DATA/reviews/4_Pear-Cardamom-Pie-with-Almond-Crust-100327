I was a bit disappointed - I thought it wasn't as flavorful as I might have expected. Maybe my pears weren't perfect. STill, it was still all gone at the end of the party.

Wow -- I'm not sure what happened here, but my experience with this pie was very different from the bulk of the reviews. I found it incredibly bland and dry, and I am not a novice baker. My crust came out dull, heavy and flavorless, the filling shockingly bland (and i ground my own cardamom in a mortar!) and pasty. I think the idea of the pie is a fine one and mean to experiment with it a bit to see if i can figure out what went wrong... but based on following this recipe once i would not do it again. it was a waste of some nice pears.

I have made this pie about a million times as it is my family's favorite. The crust is amazing and I use it for many other pies and tarts. It is great with a pear frangipane tart. It is easy to work with and is much more flavorful than most other crusts. It tastes like an almond shortbread cookie and in fact, with crust scraps, I make cute cut-out cookies!

I have been wanting to make this for a number of years, and finally got the chance this Thanksgiving. My family never wants to sway from the apple cherry pie (also from Epicurious) that is a turkey day staple. However, I think we may have turned a corner, this pie was excellent. We all love marzipan, and the crust was a winner. I didn't have pear nectar because the only kind I saw had high fructose corn syrup. Using water worked just fine. Will certainly make again.

This was very good, a big hit with my friends at a pre-Thanksgiving party. I felt like it was missing something though...perhaps a hint of citrus?

I made two of these pies this Thanksgiving--first let me say awesome flavor with the cardamom and vanilla, yummy almond crust. Rave reviews from my guests. I baked the first one as directed, but the crust got too brown, but I couldn't take it out because it wasn't fully baked yet. The second one I put in the oven fully covered with foil, and then took the foil off for the last 20 minutes of baking, which made for a fully baked pie with a perfectly done crust. Also, I was surprised by the amount of liquid in the pie despite the cornstarch. I will try tapioca flour next time--and there definitely will be a next time!

I've made this three years in a row for Thanksgiving and will do again this coming Thanksgiving..Has become our own tradition now - my family asks for it.. And I am not a baker - only does this once a year....Easy and perfect every time..

This recipe was fantasic. I brought it to a Thanksgiving dinner with the Rum Raisin Apple Pie and there was none left of either. Everyone Ooh-ed and Ah-ed about both. These are definitely on my "pie rotation" now. If you don't want to buy cardamom, I think you could substitute other spices. It provides a unique taste, but it isn't imperative.

I just made the crust with 1 substitute: cold water for the pear nectar. I also added a bit of vanilla. I used the crust for an apple pie (it was superb!).

This pie is incredible! I can't believe how little attention it has received from reviewers. This pie tastes so fresh. It is super simple to make and is such a wonderful break from apple pies. I followed the recipe as written and noticed only one minor flaw: the crust, especially the leaf cut-outs got a little too dark, and I didn't even let it bake the full time. Keep an eye on it since it seems to bake faster than suggested. Pear nectar can be found in many supermarkets in the Latin foods section- -Goya makes one. After cutting the pears in half, I found three slices from each half was just right. I highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious! Definitely use more cardamom. I also added some ginger. The crust baked very quickly, even in my ancient oven, so keep an eye on it.

I made these as mini pies in my mini muffin pan. The dough recipe as written makes 24 mini pies. There was too much filling for this application, but oh well. They came out perfect little bite sized pies with wonderful flavor. Will definitely try this again as a regular pie, too!

This is a great pie recipe, especially the easy almondy crust. I can imagine using just the crust part again with different fillings. I followed the other reviewers and used baby food pureed pears and pear juice (1:3 ratio) instead of nectar and it was great. Couldn't resist adding a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling along with the cardamon...

This is absolutely my favorite pie ever. It is so delicious, and so different. The crust is unbelievable - no one had ever tasted anything like it. It was just beautiful too. Because of the texture of the almond paste, it worked really well to press extra crust into some leaf-shaped chocolate molds, rather than use cookie cutters, and that made beautiful decoration. The filling is also delightful - the vanilla bean makes it really special. I couldn't find pear nectar so used baby food - pureed pears in a jar. I made the crust 3 days in advance for Thanksgiving, and also mixed up the dry filling ingredients, then Thanksgiving morning all I had to do was slice up the pears, toss them with the spices, and throw it in the crust. This recipe will not let you down!

I make this every year for Christmas. If you cannot find pear nectar I have used baby pear juice with 1-2 tablespoons of pureed pears--it works pretty well.

I made this 5 or 6 times by the recipe, and everyone loved it. The last time, we happened to have a ripish mango in the kitchen, and we used it so: mix 1/2 C. sugar with 1/2 C. water & bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil about one minute, stirring. Transfer syrup to pyrex container - it will be very hot! - large enough to hold the syrup and the mango, pureed. Peel the mango, cut the flesh away from the center, and puree in a food processor until you have a uniform pulp. When the syrup has cooled a little, put the mango in the syrup and let steep for an hour or two, according to taste; steeping too long, or too hot may make the mixture bitter. Strain the pulp, pressing, in a fine sieve. Substitute the pulp for the almond paste when you mix together the paste and nectar for the crust. Use the liquid for the pear nectar, both in the crust and the filling. You may also use some of the mango pulp in the filling, but it must be quite dry. Enjoy.

This is a great pie - the crust is delicious. It sold for $35.00 at our church pie auction!

Wonderful, and quite easy too. I would not reduce the cardamom as much as some people have. Everyone at my party loved this, as did I. I ate it for breakfast several days following (there were 3 other desserts as well, hence the left-overs). Serve it with homemade whipped cream.

I came to the web site to email this recipe to a friend & realized I'd never rated it here -- a shocking omission on my part, as this has over the years become a requested pie at Thanksgiving by the extended family. Even requested by the picky teenagers! I make it exactly according to the recipe. Simply delicious, and not too sweet -- which is a nice change from all the sugary, syrupy pies out in the world.

Ah, such a great pie recipe that I had to come back with additional praise. I used 1/8 tsp. cardamom this time. A perfect amount! Plus, slice the pears thicker - - this way the pear carries the spice and keeps it distinct and the pear itself really comes through. Do note that I up-ed my fork from 3 to 4.

Great crust recipe! I use it with other filling - easy and different.

The crust on this pie is so good but you have to like cardamon in order to enjoy this pie. The spice has a very strong flavor even my guests didn't care for the spice. I would make this again with the great pie crust only leave out all of the cardamon. It was just way to strong for me.

It has become a fall family favorite

One shortcut (which I attribute to my friend Janet) is to simply roll out the marzipan as a thin layer on top of the crust (which is made using ground almonds rather than marzipan), and layer the sliced pears on top (no top crust).

I would leave out the almond extract. I think the paste was "almondy" enough. Otherwise it was a lovely and different pie

Wonderful! Easy crust to make and the almond paste makes it easy to use scrap crust to decorate the top of the pie. I've made this several times over the year and will keep on making it!
