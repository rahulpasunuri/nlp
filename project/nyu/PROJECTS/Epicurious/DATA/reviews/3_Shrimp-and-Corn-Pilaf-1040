Yummy and easy. I used chicken broth and added a little garlic when sauteing the scallions. Also sauteed the shrimp in a little olive oil and white wine before adding to the pilaf.

This is a family staple! My kids are picky, and they love it! I make it basically verbatim (for 15 years), and think the fresh herbs and lemon are key. I squeeze extra lemon at the table. It's best with fresh corn, but any corn will do in a pinch. And for picky eaters, this is a great, quick and easy meal.

Just okay. Nothing great. And it took much longer to cook the shrimp in the covered pot.

We enjoyed this dish, though I tweaked it - I think the basic recipe could be taken in a bunch of different directions. I didn't have fresh basil or thyme, so I substituted cilantro. I also added garlic, red pepper flakes, and cumin to the green onion. Like the cook from Arlington, I marinated the shrimp (but in olive oil, lemon juice, s/p), seared them, and then added them to the rice. I think I'll use this recipe for its basic idea and play with it some more!

This recipe was very bland. Absolutely no character, no zing, no chutzpah.

Tasty dish! My family loved it. I added about 3/4 c. frozen peas, much to my brother's dismay - it was great, though! Easy, too, and smells terrific while cooking. I can't wait to make it again.

Great basic recipe, I subsituted peas for the corn. Will make a wonderful side-dish without the shrimp and more veggies.

This one just didn't do it for me. I like the fact that it's low fat, but it was just ok taste-wise.

This is REALLY good, and easy! I love corn and shrimp, but was surprised by how much depth of flavor this dish has. I've made some substitutions with great success: I substituted a small shallot for the white part of the green onions, and chopped chives for the green part; I marinated the shrimp briefly in white wine and a tiny bit of olive oil, then seared them and added to the rice at the last minute; I added some peeled diced tomato with the shrimp; and finally, added a little cayenne for kick. Yummy!

Wow! It was quick, good, and best of all low fat. My whole family enjoyed it!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I've only had the recipe for 2 weeks and have already made it twice. The second time I made it with brown rice to add fiber. It was good, but better with the white rice. The newer canned chicken broths with garlic, herbs, etc. adds additional flavor. We don't make many seafood dishes at home...this one is a keeper.

This recipe is a staple in my house. It's light and delicate, but also very satisfying. If you want a quick, one-pot meal that everyone will love, this one is hard to beat.

I prepared this dish for a large family gathering, it would have been better if eaten immediately and not transported. I did add peas and diced carrots for color.
