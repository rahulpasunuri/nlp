I was disappointed with this recipe. The 20 minute baking time is not sufficient; the brownies are too moist and gooey. The small amount of instant coffee does not result in any noticeable coffee taste. The brownies really are very thin. My advice: stick with the tried-and-true brownie recipe on the back of the Nestle cocoa box!

these brownies are very rich, and the coffee flavor is perfect. actually didnt really become 'brownies' more like a chocolate mush...to be eaten with a fork or spoon on a plate - not served as pieces... i finished off the entire thing straight from the baking dish!!!!

I tried this recipe after trying the other recipe for Mocha Brownies on this site. These are better, although they do not cook noticably faster. The proportion, and therefore the taste, of coffee, is much greater in these brownies, and the texture is excellent.
