I made this for Xmas dinner several years ago and it was a hit even with my Dad who is a VERY simple meat and potatoes man!

Excellent results when you add the chicken broth. I also substituted fresh french and sourdough breads torn into pieces and it was yummy! A huge hit for the holiday party!

I really liked this recipe. It does make a lot of stuffing. Be sure to add chicken broth so as to not have it dry. The apples and sausage work well together. Will make it again, just cut the amount

One of the best stuffings I have ever had, my Husband loved it

There was so much stuffing from this recipe! I added the eggs and chicken stock to moisten the stuffing as suggested by the other reviewers, and baked it, and it was really good!

This recipe was amazing! This was my 1st time preparing Thanksgiving dinner and I was extremely nervous about the stuffing. It was so good there were no leftovers!

Everyone loves it. I serve it at Thanksgiving and again at our Christmas Parties for 200+ people every year. The only thing I change is using spicy italian sausages (I even add some extra red pepper seasoning) and extra broth with the breadcrumbs. I've even had stuffing competitions with friends and this one always wins.

A big thanks to all the previous reviews. I combined your suggestions and wanted to let you know that this combination worked well. Modifications to existing recipe: *4 Cups Onions (not 5) *4 Granny Smith Apples *1 Tablespoon Fresh Sage (Chopped) *1 1/2 Bags of Pep. Farm Herb Cubed Stuffing Mix Additions: * 1 1/2 handfuls of chopped pecans * 1/2 bag fresh cranberries * 1 can low sodium chix stock * 2 eggs Cooking: 45 minutes at 325 degrees covered w/foil. Remaining last 15 minutes with foil removed to crisp up top of stuffing. I fed 14 people and still had enough for leftovers. This cooked in 2 casserole pans, 1 large and 1 medium size.

I make this every year for the holidays, and everyone loves it. You will definitely need to add extra broth or water to moisten it though. This recipe makes a lot of stuffing.

This is wonderful with the following changes: 4 cups onions, 2 tsp poultry seasoning, 7 cups stuffing mix (14 ounces), 4 cups chicken broth to moisten stuffing when mixed before stuffing turkey or placing in oven. Sometimes I wonder if some of the recipe components are left out from the transition from the magazine to website as the above changes I believe were included in the original magazine recipe?!

Just ok. Nothing great.

This is the second holiday in a row that I've made this dish and the leftovers taste even better! I couldn't find the sweet Italian sausage so I substituted the mild Italian sausage and it tasted just fine.

The recipe was almost a catastophe. The finished product was too chuncky. It was also too dry on top and too moist on bottom. It almost looked like a breakfast casserole. I saved it by chopping the stuffing in my food processor. Evryone loved it!

Like others, I didn't add all 5 cups of onions. I love onions, but it seemed like too much. Only used about 4 cups and that was enough. Added a whole can of chicken broth and could have used a little more (I didn't stuff the turkey with this). It was my first time making stuffing and it tasted great. Makes a lot of stuffing!

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving.. didn't end up using all of the onions it called for... I'll definitely make this again!

i made this for thanksgiving 2001 - and i took a previous reviewer's advice, i added a whole can of chicken broth. I didnt add the 5 cups of onions - seemed like too much - I used about 2 cups of onions instead (pleanty in my opinion unless you are an onion freak). I used cornbread stuffing - and also added 2 eggs. It was moist but not soggy AT ALL. I actually can't imagine it without the added eggs and broth - would be awfully dry! Oh - at the last minute i decided to stick it in a non stick springform pan (cheesecake pan) because i didnt have enough corningware to go around - and it came out GREAT! i sliced it like pie - it was the biggest hit of Thanksgiving dinner! I let it sit for about 15 minutes after it came out of the over and it didnt fall apart at all. It's my new classic - I'll make this for the rest of my life. TRY it just the way i made it - you'll be glad you did!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner. It was a hit! Would add at least a can of chicken broth. Also, it serves a lot more than 8 people.

I made several modifications to this recipe - used country sausage not Italian; used cornbread not stuffing mix. I also threw in some pecans and fresh cranberries. It was great - not as greasy as other sausage cornbread stuffings I've made.

Are you supposed to peel the apples?

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner and every guest asked for seconds and thirds of the stuffing! The only leftover that I didn't have!

Great dish, with one modification. I would add an entire can of chicken broth to the recipe to give it some moistness. Or at least melt an entire stick of butter into the saute. Or perhaps a beaten egg or two. Something. Otherwise, it's much too dry for my taste. (May be a personal preference though.) I did not stuff a roast, and this recipe completely filled a 9x14 pan. Enough to feed an army. Really took an hour to cook through (but I had made a day ahead, so it was starting out kind of cool). I also like to take the aluminum foil off for the last bit of cooking to crisp up the top. I served with Cider Brined Pork Chops with Leek and Cream sauce. Turned out perfectly.

I made this recipe for my first Thanksgiving Dinner in our new home 25 people RAVED about. Now, even if I don't have stuffing at my house I am asked to bring it along!

I made this for a Crown Roast of Pork. I added one pound of ground pork, some chiptole seasoning and some white wine in the process of sauteing the onions. Got great reviews for the Christmas dinner.

An excellent recipe, which has made it's way around my family. You can modify it with small additions. Truly the best stuffing for a Turkey or pork loin. I use chorizo sausage to give it a little kick, and it's to die for!

This was fabulous. I've been looking for a good pork chop stuffing recipe, and this was it. Can you get any more perfect with the apples and sausage?? The only thing I did different was add some corriander, dried tarragon and fennel; and I added more allspice, thyme and sage than it called for because I didn't use preseasoned stuffing bread. But this recipe had a wonderful flavor and everyone who tried it wants to know when I'm making it again.

I had this stuffing this past thanksgiving and I thought that I would die! This is a very flavorful stuffing that goes very well with turkey I highly recommend this to any one who loves their stuffing.

This is an excellent recipe. it was a little dry using only the butter so i used a combination of chicken broth and apple juice to soften the stuffing. I have also added cranberries along with the apples. You do not have to saute the apples in the recipe. We love the recipe and use it every thanksgiving
