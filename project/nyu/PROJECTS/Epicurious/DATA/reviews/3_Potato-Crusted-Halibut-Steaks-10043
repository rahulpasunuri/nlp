An exceptionally well balanced dish. Not entirely easy to prepare but well worth the effort. I served the fish with some hericot vert and some pan-seared mushrooms (shitake, crimini and king oyster) provided an earthy quality and texture that was a nice foil to the moist, meaty halibut. I was looking for a white Chateauneuf du Pape to serve with this but found a lovely Marsanne (and Roussane) blend from Qupé in central California. Lots of wet stone minerality and binned apple. A great pairing for a great dish.

This is a really good recipe! I was concerned when people said the potatoes stuck to the pan so I used a really hot skillet with a little more oil than called for - worked great. Nice and crispy potatoes. The oven time is off unless you want overdone fish. I baked the fish for about 8 minutes. Like others said - forget the sauce. It not only smells bad it adds nothing to the prepared fish.

I usually have really good success with Gourmet and Bon Appetit recipes, but this one was extremely frustrating. The potato crust kept sticking to the pan and not to the fish. I tried squeezing the water out, adding some potato buds, more oil, but it didn't help. I also agree with some other reviewers, the sauce didn't do it for me. I think the oil to everything else ratio wasn't quite right--tasted very strong of olive oil. Definitely not trying this again

We love this recipe and have been making it for years. Salmon is my preferred fish. I used warm Italian dressing for the sauce once and it worked. Leftovers (if any) are great the next day cold on a salad.

I would give this recipe four stars if not for the sauce. Putting a whole T. of Worcestershire sauce in the sauce gives it a very strange flavor. A dash maybe, but not a tablespoon. Next time, I will try it with a dash only. The fish was great- made it pretty much as directed except I didn't have anchovies, so I put a dash of Worcestershire sauce in the mayo mixture-- It was super great. If you want your potatoes to stick to the fish, make sure you grate them just before putting them on the fish and cooking them. The starch in the potatoes will help it adhere to the fish. It was a little tricky getting the fish down on the pan with the potatoes underneath, but it came together very easily. Even my daughter like it. Very elegant and tasty.

I will likely make this again as my husband really liked it, but I found it kind of greasy, and ironically I found it stuck to my pan so the potato crust got separated from the fish. Not very attractive. The mayo with capers/anchovy adds some nice tanginess, but I might add some lemon zest to it as well. I don't think the sauce adds much.

We followed the recipe pretty closely and, after all the positive reviews, were pretty surprised how poorly this turned out. It didn't look very appetizing and the taste was not an improvement on just plain grilled fish. Considering all the preparation work required I found this to be a rare dud from this site.

This was quick and delicious, a keeper! I made it with no substitutions except anchovy paste instead of chopped anchovies. I liked the added flavor of the sauce. I appreciated the previous tips to use Yukon potatoes (yum) and to squeeze the moisture out of them before topping the fish. For the flipping stages (in & out of the skillet) I just used 2 spatulas, 1 held on top and 1 held on bottom of each piece of fish and it worked great. Make sure that skillet is HOT to cook the crust nice and brown.

I have made with and without the sauce, and I would agree that it is not a necessity (as I just made this for a weeknight dinner this evening) but does add something special if you have the time. The first time I used a halibut filet and today I used a haddock filet and to my suprise it worked wonderfully.

This is in our regular rotation. It is easy and delicious. I usually halve the ingredients for the two of us and use Yukon Gold potatoes. Otherwise, I make it as written. I had problems initially in fliping the fish and having the potato topping fall off, but now I just put the baking sheet over the skillet and invert it. It seems to work well, but then I haven't the training & experience of a real chef.

Great recipe. Always on the lookout for fish recipes that are good for fish that I've caught then frozen for future use. Frozen fish is never that same as fresh, but recipes like this make the meal enjoyable. The potato bud suggestion was a nice time saver and it helps that I got used to potato buds in college.

I have made this over and over for dinner parties. It is always successful. I love the sauce though others have gone either way. Cannot beat real potatoes. Especially good with the spinach with sour cream and pine nuts.

Followed recipe exact without additions or substitutions and was very pleased with the results. Wonderful alternative to those oh-so-ordinary fish dishes and made an elegant presentation. Liked the tangy flavor of the sauce which served as a unique twist to the tartar sauce more commonly used by most folks. It's also a great *fix* for anyone who has problems (like me) with occasionally overcooking their fish!

If you want to save yourself alot of time making this dish, I'll give you the secret. Potato Buds. If you've never heard of them, they are dehydrated potato flakes. To make this dish in about five minutes total, simply pour a generous amount of Potato Buds on a plate. Generously salt and pepper the halibut filets. Press both sides of the filets into the Potato Buds. Place into a hot skillet with olive oil and butter. Brown on both sides. Add a little more salt and pepper before serving. Done. Five minutes total... Just don't tell anyone that you used Potato Buds. They'll never guess. By the way, alot of restaurants use this trick...

This recipe is a keeper, JUST how the recipe instructs! An instant classic! So easy and elegant. We just tried it last night for the first time, and already plan to make it for company this weekend. Fabulous.

A very interesting combo of flavors. The potato mix stayed on the fish better than I thought it would. I probably wouldn't bother making the wine sauce next time, it didn't need it.

Haven't made this yet, but one request: will people PLEASE refrain from passing judgement on recipies when they substitute half of the ingredients!!!

My husband loved this. I did change it -- I used peanuts instead of potatoes to make it low-carb, used low-fat mayo, no sardines (didn't have any and don't think we would like them), and didn't make the sauce. We didn't miss a thing. The presentation was beautiful and my husband said it tasted like something you would order in a fancy restaurant.

I used skinless salmon filets instead of halibut and took a shortcut and substitued a prepared roasted garlic aioli for the caper mayo & anchovy mix. BLAND BLAND BLAND! If capers and anchovies aren't your thing, be sure you substitute with other salty ingredients...olives?? I also soaked the potato in cold water first as did another reviewer, which results in a nice brown crust. Served in a puddle of Tomato Ginger Vinaigrette with a nice Pinot Nior. Will try again a punchier mayo mix and perhaps even shredded onions in the potato crust. (Try frying left over shredded potatoes in 2" diameter rounds and use as garnish).

A SUPER recipe...used Haddock and it was just great! Sauce, potato crust wonderful

Made this a few times.Best when fish is seasoned well first. Also tried another recipe where potates are sliced and layed across fish.Good also, but more difficult to wrap around fish.

Wonderful & easy dish! I couldn't get halibut so I used striped bass instead which is sturdy enough and very tasty. I found the worstershire sauce too overpowering and cut the sauce recipe with about 2 oz of chicken broth (added at the end)- beleive it or not it did the trick. Will definitely make over & over;)

I altered this recipe a bit. I used crushed Macadamia nuts instead of the potatoes. It came out wonderful. Although you must take care not to burn the nut crust when you saute. Also,for the sauce I reduced the amount of worsteshire (sp?) sauce. Also, you might try using a dill sauce, I did that once and it was very good also.

I am constantly making new meals for my boyfriend, and he said this one was "a keeper"! I used halibut filets, and skinned them (this recipe says nothing about the skin, which is almost always on the fish). I omitted the accompanying sauce, and instead used the SPICY CILANTRO SAUCE which you can find on this site. It was amazing! (sauce on plate and fish on top of that) Along with, I served a simple black bean corn-salsa. We didn't have rice, but will next time to round it out.

Easy preparation, nice presentation. One thing that I'd like to add is to squeeze the moisture out of the grated potatoes for better browning. I opted to not make the sauce since the mayonaise spread already contains strong flavours. A squeeze of lemon was perfect. I accompanied with a green rice pilaf and also a medly of baby carrots and fresh snap peas sauteed in butter and finished with alittle brown sugar and plenty of freshly ground pepper.

I make my husband rate all my meals (A+ to never make again) and I got another A+! I used salmon, added a few extra anchovies and served green beans with bleu cheese as a side.

Potato keeps fish beautifully moist. Sauce is one flavour too many and not really necessary. Goes with steamed new potatoes, green beans, fennel with red pepper and parmesan (contact us for the recipe!). Does NOT go with tomato flavours. Wine recommendation: white Chateauneuf-du-Pape; well-aged Savennieres (we had Coulee de Serrant!)
