So delicious and unique. I could only find mustard greens (instead of broccoli rabe) and had to substitute mini farfalle and it was still so great. I love the unique flavors- slightly bitter, toasty, and creamy. YUM!

Really delicious, quick, healthy work night meal-- half an hour or less from when the water boils. Only reason I didn't give it four forks is because I agree with the other cooks: the pasta/greens ratio is way off! I make it with a big head of broccoli rabe, just 1/2 lb pasta, and one can garbanzos and it turns out perfectly. (Obviously cut down on the cooking water addition, too). Agree with other cooks that it is improved by addition of a pinch of red pepper flakes (I add it when I add the sage) and some lemon zest or juice towards the end of the cooking time. Another note: while I'm sure it's fine with broccoli, it's the bitterness of the broccoli rabe that really makes this dish special. I can't imagine a broccoli version rating more than two forks.

Very well received at the table, and a nice flavor, despite my having forgotten to salt the pasta water. Coupled with a nice antipasto, and a nice white wine, a very enjoyable meal. Easy to prepare, and lends itself to a lot of nice variations. Would definitely make again.

After reading the reviews, I thought this dish would be very tasty. I found it very bland, and had to add more wine, cheese, salt, and even cream to give it some flavor.

I loved the flavor of the fried chickpeas: nutty and more complex than I've had them prepared before. Slightly bitter, grown-up pasta dish that I would definitely make again.

This is a great side dish as it provides both starches and veggies in one. I think using a decent white wine makes a difference in enhancing the flavors.

This was good with broccoli and I can't wait to try it with broccoli rape. I used red pepper flakes, dried sage leaves and the juice and zest of one lemon. My husband, who detests my bean-y adventures, thought this one could be repeated! Yeah!

I'm a disorganized cook, with clippings of recipies and boxes of magazines pilling up since 1990. I always try out new recipies, and fail to keep my keepers on hand, many separations and moving out hindering my repertoire! I was so trilled to put my hand back on this much loved recipe, thanks to my new computer. So, how did I mingle with it? Used salt in the pasta cooking water. Cut back to one can of beans. Added lemon zest and fresh pepper while frying the garbanzos. Added salt when adding the rape and cut pasta water to 1/2 a cup. I vary by using a combination of fresh herbs from my garden. And sometimes add at the very end halved cherry tomatoes: their sweetness teams up beautifully with the bitter greens. Will definitely try the red pepper flakes and lemon juice as well. Would never consider cutting back on oil and butter, because they bring it all together. I think 2/3 c. of sherry would be too much, but the acidity and alcohol content of white win are just perfect. I think reviewers who thought it was bland should give it a try with a bit of salt to bring it to life and not cut on the oil and butter. My guests always rave about this dish and I refrain from licking my plate.

I discovered the delights of broccoli rabe a few years ago and am always on the lookout for new ways to use it. This recipe has become one of my favorites. I always use fresh sage (it makes a world of difference)--as much as 1/2 cup--and unlike some reviewers, I find the butter to be indispensable as well. Orecchiette can sometimes be hard to find, even here in the capital of food diversity, so I stockpile it whenever I find it: it's the perfect shape for this sauce.

Rating: 3
Good simple recipe. I added a fair amount of crushed red pepper when frying the chickpeas to give it some extra flavor and heat. I've also used spinach when not in the mood for bitter greens. Finally, I've found adding a dollop of ricotta at the end instead of parmesan makes a nice change.

Rating: 3
This is quick and my family enjoyed it (I didn't try it because I'm dieting) but they said it was good but not great. I subbed broccoli for broccoli rabe (which I've never seen here) and used sherry instead of wine. I also cut back a bit on the olive oil. I'd make again when pressed for time because it's fast and I typically have all ingredients on hand, but for something special would probably try another recipe.

This is one of my favorite week-night dishes! I leave out the butter, usually use dried sage, and add red pepper flakes.

Yes, I will absolutely make this again. We all liked it! I used only about 2 Tblspoons of oil for the chick peas and let them get nice and brown. Substituted broccoli and used asiago cheese. Another change, oregano for the sage. Sounds like a lot of subsitutions but it really is a great recipe.

I cut back on the olive oil and butter as recommended by others and used a bit of sherry instead of white wine. I am not a fan of sage so I left it out. Delicious and easy dish to make. Makes a good weekday meal.

I make this recipe all the time and it's great, but with some basic changes. The secret is in proper seasoning during cooking and reducing the amount of liquid. People may be overcooking their pasta and try other brands of canned beans (highly recommend Goya) or even use dry beans that have been soaked. You can also toss a little curry powder with the beans while sauteeing or even toss the beans with curry, dried sage and a little oil then spread out on a cookie sheet and roast til fragrant. Go for a drier final dish by withholding the pasta liquid and simmer the rabe separately from the beans. Then toss the pasta, beans and rabe all together with cheese, season with salt and a little red pepper flakes then add liquid as you see fit.

I loved this recipe. Easy and delicious, especially if you like garbanzo beans. I omitted the butter, and used slightly less olive oil and more pasta water. I also used brocolli and dried sage, as I did not have any fresh. Still very good. However, I do not consider this company fare!

This dish contains some of my favorite foods, but I was disappointed with the results. I prepared it as written, with good cheese and wine and fresh sage (I did use radiatore instead of orcchiette). It was OK, but somehow the flavors just didn't go together - and I'm an adventuresome eater. It was kinda...bland and gloppy. We also tossed the left-overs.

Rating: 1
This was just o.k. Thought it would have more "oomph". We ended up dousing it with more cheese. Ended up with leftovers that didn't get used again. Too bad, this looked like such a great comfort food recipe.

Rating: 3
Definitely a keeper! I enjoyed the texture of the "fried" chickpeas and the lemon and zest really added something to the dish. I ommitted the white wine and just used a bit of veggie broth to help bring it together. Would tweak a little more next time with some spice other than sage, but a relatively simple dish to prepare.

Rating: 4
This is a splendid dish. After my guests had seconds, there was not a chickpea left in the pot. I often make a version of it without the chickpeas, but they are a great addition (plus add fiber and protein without fat). I will now include them as standard. Do have the following suggestions, however. 1) OMIT THE BUTTER. It brings nothing to the party but bad fats and is certainly not authentic. 2) Add some red pepper flakes, to taste. Also, it is great with broccoli if the rabe is not available. Finally, do use the best quality pasta you can find (I used artisanal tri-colour orecchiette) and remember orecchiette take a long time to cook (mine take a good 20 minutes).

Rating: 3
I added lemon zest and juice, used all of the sage. It was delicious. I'm a chickpea fan, and wouldn't dream of leaving them out. My two-year old and hubby loved it as well. Was good the next day, (cold.) Will try to reduce oil amount next time.

Rating: 3
I was intrigued with the wide range of reviews on this recipe, so I decided to try it myself. I thought it was pretty good. The sage, garlic and wine gave the dish a very good flavor. I could take or leave the chickpeas, but since they do add a good amount of fiber, I'll probably leave them in next time but reduce the quantity. I also didn't like the addition of the fresh sage at the end, I thought it was too pungent. The sauteed sage was enough. This isn't special enough for a dinner party, but it's great as a quick, nutritious and "pretty" weeknight meal.

Rating: 2
This recipe wasn't without its merits: the mix of flavors was pleasing, but some of the components, I felt, were off. First, I would skip the chickpeas altogether. In an already carb-heavy meal, they add a lot of density without adding much flavor or a nice contrast in texture. Perhaps I did somthing wrong, but mine turned out mealy. Second, I'd use penne instead of orechiette; orechiette has the annoying tendency to clump into clusters and not cook properly. I used broccolini instead of rabe, which I liked better because it's sweeter. My husband actually really liked it. I'd make it again but with the above alterations and much, much less oil (no chickpeas to fry).

Rating: 3
This dish is a treat for the eye and the palate. I love the way the chickpeas nestle in the orechiette, and the broccoli rabe contributes just the right accent of bitterness. Like several other testers, I added a little lemon juice and zest.

Rating: 3
We just loved this recipe, but then again, we love rapini and are always looking for new ways to enjoy one of our favorite greens. It was easy and definitely filling. I used organic garbanzo beans and fresh parmesan. Letting the cheese sit to room temperature helps release its flavor as well.

There was too much pasta and not enough flavor, despite my having added extra garlic, salt, pepper and cheese. Perhaps I should have cooked the pasta in a broth???

Delish!! Sounded weird at first, but I threw my doubt aside and jumped right in! Yes I agree that the amount of sage seems huge, but it really crisps up to nothing, leaving only yummy flavour!

I loved this so much I gave it my first **** review. Just wonderful, I halved it, for two and only thing different was a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, just because we like the slight spiciness they give. I couldn't find the orecchiette except for the imported artesian packages, but that was a good thing as it was soooo good. If you like broccoli rabe and pasta, this is definitely a must.

No wonder the grocery guy looked quizically when I requested OR-A-CHE-ET-A! OY! At least I knew rap-peh since that's what I eat for greens on New Year's Day sauteed with lean bacon and Vidalia (VI-DALE-YAH) onion with my Hoppin John. I am going to take a leap of faith because I would not usually mix pasta with another starch (garbanzos) but the reviews are so promising, I diving right in. Thanks for the option of Gruyere!

We haven't tried this recipe yet but will soon. We like this vegatable and use it often. Goes well with anchovies and garlic. Broccoli rape comes from Italy where it is pronounced RA PEH. However the English spelling was altered due to obvious marketing problem. Maketing problems in English

I too chose to use broccoli because broccoli rabe was not readily available in this small town. Although I recognize that this diminishes the authenticity of the dish and is not a suitable substitution in some eyes, I did want to add my voice to those who also had to substitute. This dish was very delicious with the broccoli and all other ingredients as stated. Do add lemon juice or sliced lemon at the end as suggested by others. This is a nice diversion from the familiar pasta meal. My husband loved it also.

I thought this dish was wonderful! Comfort food at it's best. I have never cooked with broccoli rabe before and didn't know if I should use the leafy part or not. Well I did and it was great. Also added a little lemon juice and it really made the dish "pop"! Will definitely make this again.

hey guys- thanks for all the great feedback and ciao to you too daniela. come stai? i grew up calling it rape- pronounced RAH-PEH, short for broccoli di rape, but different regions of italy have their own variations. there is no right or wrong, so there is no point correcting anyone on this. even i have conceded to popular culture and just call it rabe-ROB because it's easier than going through the whole story. when in Rome......but when in NY- that's a whole other story. you don't want to get into an argument with a new yorker, they don't back down for anyone. what i know about rabe is that it is one of your dark leafy greens-so it has many of the same properties as spinach-loaded with iron and vitamin C, tons of calcium and various other vitamins. very healthy. i loved everyone's messages and am glad everyone is enjoying and experimenting with new foods. peace and good health. BACI A TUTTI- kisses to everyone.

Definitely trying this recipe. Non-tomato based recipes have turned out excellent. Broccoli rabe has many health benefits. By the way, "orechiette" is more interesting than "rabe". It works very well with sauces and pasta dressings with "pieces" like shrimp or chicken. It should work very nicely with chickpeas.

Rating: 0
It looks like a stalk with lots of leaves and tiny broccoli florets on it, and has a more bitter flavour than broccoli. I always thought it was young broccoli, but it is actually a different vegetable. In the U.K. we have something similar, sprouting broccoli, which I'm going to try in this recipe; it looks delicious!

Loved it. I just wanted to added to the pronunciation conversation; I pronounce "rah-beh." I have seen it spelt many ways: broccoli raab, broccoli rabe, broccoli di rabe, broccoli rape, broccoli di rape, and broccoli di rapa. When languages and recipes come across the great seas, many changes occur causing much distress and great joy. :-)

Orechiette, broccoli rabe, chick peas....three of my favorites in a comforting, fragrant combination. Don't even consider using broccoli in lieu of the rabe -- you'd miss that distinct bite that does create future cravings. I can't recall ever craving broccoli.

A delicious winter pasta (we finished it all). I will also try a summer version with broccoli and basil + lemon instead of the rabe and sage (good suggestions from some of the other reviewers). If you can't find orrechiette, I'd suggest shells rather than penne to better trap the chick peas. Buon appetito!

I too used regular broccoli, not the rabe - I would make this again to try it as written before I wrote it off. It was ok, but not fantastic. As advised, be sure to use PLENTY of Parm, and serve with more Parm and lemon wedges (thanks for that suggestion!)
