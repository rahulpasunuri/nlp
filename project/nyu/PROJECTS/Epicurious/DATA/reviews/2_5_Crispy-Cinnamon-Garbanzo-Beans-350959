My family is a fan of the regular baked garbanzo beans. I never expected they would taste good with sugar and cinnamon. Thanks for sharing.

ok--I really had fun and realllly liked playing with this recipe. Did the cinnamon version. I used Saigon cinnamon and doubled it by the time I finished. I would never use canned beans (ick--sodium!!) and already started to soak another half pound of GBs. I did soak overnight and also cooked beans 1/2 hr, draining before and after each action. I also made savory version and not sure about sugar, left it out, but added it halfway thru baking, for the "candied" coat to grip the seasonings. I used 1 tsp Spanish smoked paprika, 1/4 tsp hot paprika and 1/2 tsp fresh black pepper+ sea salt to taste (1/2 tsp max) I look forward to some new versions.

I agree with previous reviewers wondering where the horrible reviews come from. I think these are a great treat to snack on. I used canned garbanzo beans and it took more along the lines of an hour for them to fully crisp up (although might have crisped a bit too much in the last 10 minutes, so keep your eye on them). Also, next time I will add a little less salt as I was hoping for a sweeter snack.

helps if you give them a stir every 10-15 min. perhaps in between a few cocktails!

I might have given these 4 forks, but they're too simple to call exceptional. I've made them twice in the past week to rave reviews. I'm using probably 4 or more cups of garbanzos, but I think I use less sugar. I sprinkle it lightly, then bake it, then taste it for sweetness before adding more and baking longer. I skip the salt. They're addictive, delicious, loved by all, and so quick and simple if made with canned beans. Try them!

i've tried garbanzo beans coated in a random assortment of italian seasonings- my friends threw it together with every spice they could find in their spice rack- and those were really tasty.

The general consensus on these in our foodie house was that they were mildly addictive - kind of sweet, kind of salty. Not sure I'm understanding all the negative reviews, feel like I missed something - they take 30 seconds to throw together, then you just stick them in the oven and wait, and then ... they're not half bad. I've tried them with dried and canned garbanzo beans (hello economy, try an 89 cent snack), they work ok both ways. I wouldn't say they're the world's most gourmet delight, but they're not half bad.

I thought the recipe looked great and easy so despite the reviews I gave it a try. Flavor not great- the sugar and salt didnt work well with the beans and it had a strange after taste. I also had problems cooking it evenly- I almost broke my teeth on a few and others were not cooked. I'll keep looking for another snack recipe.

Same experience as the cook from Rhode Island. Too crispy or too soft. I am adventurous in my cooking. A tad too adventurous in this case. I tried hard to like these. My family agrees; there are some foods you can develop a taste for but these are not it. Problems with this recipe extend beyond flavor. I intentionally left the container at my brother's house after our holiday party. I had such high hopes.

What a waste. No child or adult would eat them. I ate a few because I invested so much time into them.

I have to say: eh. These were a disappointment. The first reviewer was right -- about half were perfectly crunchy, the other half turned out too soft. Overall, they lacked interest and weren't really worth the time.

Don't waste the effort here. Even though I'm a garbanzo fan & can make odd things into desirable ones, this one is beyond my scope. At best it reminds you of some kind of cereal. Chickpeas were either too soft or too crunchy-hard. 86 this one.
