I made this using heirloom tomatoes and it was amazing. Simple, fresh and quick. I will definitely make it again soon.

This was very simple to make and the tomatoes taste so delicious. I used heirloom tomatoes. I'll definitely make this again next summer!

I made this with tomatoes right in the middle of August. The dish was delicious! Simple but so satisfying on a hot day. I didn't have shallots on hand so I used a handful of finely diced yellow onion. Really good. I will definitely make this a regular meal during tomato season.

delicious! although february probably isn't the best time to make this dish (we had to use dried basil, which was a shame) the pasta still came out great and i'm all the more excited to try it again in the summer when all the ingredients are actually in season. very simple, fresh flavors. perfect!

Great receipe,especially for those of us who grow heirloom tomatoes in the Sacra-TOMATO-area. We live in Davis Calif and I used Bradywine, mortgage lifter and Nebraska wedding for the tomatoes. I didnt have any green heirlooms-oh well-next year?. I did add Kalmata olives and the parmesean? Reggiano of course. Fabulous receipe for a dinner for friends who appreciate heirlooms and fresh garden grown basil and oregano
