Just made this dough to have with drinks on Christmas.....I'm a little worried....the dough is completely crumbly. I gathered it and am chilling it overnight. Has anyone else had this experience??

This recipe is perfection. I have used both parmesean and asiago cheese...both are very good. Everyone who has had these loved them!

LOVE IT! Not sweet, not savory just something in between. Very interesting and the addition of fennel is a must. I reduced the sugar (as I always do) to 1/3 cup or 40 grams and it was just perfect, I thought. Great with espresso or as hors d'oeuvres.

We thought they were very good. Savory & sweet at the same time. We liked it as an appetizer with wine. Agreed - do not overcook! 20 mins is a bit too long.

Just a little sweet. Sort of an adult cookie. Don't let them get too brown.
