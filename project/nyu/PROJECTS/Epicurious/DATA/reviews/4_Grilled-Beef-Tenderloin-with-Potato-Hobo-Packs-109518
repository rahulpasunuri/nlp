Very good recipe. 4 layers of foil is overkill, and moderately low burner is too low, even on my Viking. Keep it between 350 and 400 under the hood if you're going by the 40 minutes for the hobo packs.

Delicious! Out of this world! The sage is a crowning touch on this amazing recipe. My husband took the leftover to work the next day and had a dozen co-workers crowding around his cubicle wondering what he was eating. (Also, I cooked the meat inside the hobo packs and thought it much easier that way and it still tasted great).

I make the potatoes all the time! They are always a big hit, super easy and have become a staple of my summer BBQ.

Fabulous!!! Took a little longer to cook to med rare...but it was exceptional. Will make again. One note..I wouldn't serve the bacon/sour cream/chives again. Nobody used them..not needed.

Made this for my picky inlaws and it was great. Meat came out perfect. I made the hobo packs in the oven since the grill was smaller. It took longer than I expected but still perfect.

Exceptional!!! I prepared this for 25 people with ease. I used 13 lbs. of tenderloin which provided adequate proportions but I would recommend 14- 15lbs to be safe. Highly recommended for large parties as there is little work once prep is done.

Does anyone know how many adults this would serve?

Outstanding. Used store-bought coarsely ground black pepper and the rub was great. Made potatoes in oven with mix of small red and gold skinned potatoes cut in half, and mix of red, yellow and white pearl onions. Rosemary instead of sage. Beautiful colors and aromatic. Sour cream, chives and bacon on the side. For oil, used partly garlic olive oil. Double batch in two packs of foil took 90 mins. Blanch pearl onions no more than a minute or they get mushy.

Delicious!! The hobo packs allow for creativity as well - throw in a sprig of rosemary, herbes de provence, a bit of shallot, whatever herbs tempt you. I also recommend turning the hobo packs once about halfway through the cooking to prevent burning.

haven't made this yet, but, to answer the first reviewer's question, according to the actual June 2004 mag, this recipe serves 6. has anyone used small red potatoes? just as good?

Not only did this preparation turn into a fantastic dinner, but it was fun to prepare too! For goodness sake, throw the packs into the fire. Live a little! While our two adults and three kids do not go through a lot of meat in a sitting, I get the sense from the potato packs that this dinner would feed four adults very well.

While I didn't fix the entire recipe - only the potato hobo packs - and I didn't really make packs, I just roasted the potato mixture in the oven and then mixed in some sour cream, etc., the potatoes were absolutely delicious! I will definitely make again, maybe even the right way!

This was a wonderful dish, especially the potato hobo packs. I will make them again and again as the fresh sage, pearl onions and garlic added such a wonderful flavor. I cut the potatoes into a bit smaller pieces (quartered vs. halved) to allow for quicker cooking. Total cook time was 40 minutes but I left them on the top shelf of the grill for the last 10 minutes to keep warm.

Excellent! The quality of the tenderloin was amazing and it cooked great on the grill--took a little longer than instructed for medium rare, but there were some grill problems. Did the potato packets in the oven and they were fantastic. Definitely will fix again!

Just a question: how many is this recipe supposed to serve?
