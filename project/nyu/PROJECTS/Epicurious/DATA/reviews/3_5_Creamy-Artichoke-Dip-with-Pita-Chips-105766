Very good recipe, left out the jalapeno and onion because I was taking it to a work potluck. The cooking time needs to be at least 45 minutes to an hour even if the ingredients are at room temperature.

This was a fun dip to make. Its not quite as quick and easy as some I have done, but was very flavorful. Made for a small gathering of friends, and served with pretzels instead of pita chips.

Very tasty and popular with my book group. I made it in the food processor -- first chop scallions, garlic and jalapenos, then add other ingredients except artichokes and mozzarella, which are added last and gently pulsed. Also, worked fine with canned artichokes in water.

This recipe got a four because it was ridiculously simple and everyone LOVED it. I left out the Dijon and sprinkled about 1/2 cup of shredded Asiago cheese over the top just before baking. It was a perfect addition and gave the dish a little depth.

this was disgusting. i made it for a block party and no one touched it. "no taste and way too creamy" is how my husband described it-- and his favorite food is mayonaise. usually artichoke dip is fail-safe and devoured, this one i will never make this again.

I followed it by the letter for the first attempt. It was fine. I served it for a house full of college students...it was just okay....these kids usually devour evertying, so to have any left always tells me the truth. Just not enough flavor, in my opinion. My search for the best continues....

This was a lovely dip that my husband and sister & brother in-laws loved! They could not get enough. I cannot find bagel chips here, so I served this on Carrs Water Crackers. After reading the reviews I took the comments to heart and tweaked the recipe. Here are my changes; I used 1- 8oz pkg cream cheese, 1-14oz can artichoke hearts, 1 cup parmesan and 1 small can chopped mild mexican green chilies. The recipe turned out fantastic. The comment was made I could make this dip anytime! This is a lovely recipe when tweaked goes from good to awesome.

My New Year's Eve guests loved this, even my boyfriend who generally hates anything with a sour cream/mayo base. I made two minor modifications: 1) doubled the amount of hot sauce and used a Mexican habanero instead of regular Tabasco or whatever is called for and 2) split the recipe between two glass pie plates to bake. That way my late arriving guests had something warm out of the oven when my early arriving guests had already polished off the first one.

I've made this dish time and time again and it's always been a huge hit at every party I've made it for. It's also great for pot luck things as well. The only challenge has been keeping the dip warm. To solve that, I purchased a mini crock pot for use at my home and a little candle heated fondue pot (from Crate and Barrel) for use at pot luck gatherings where I'm unsure if I will have a plug in available or not. I use baked pita chips from Trader Joe's to serve with.

Luv this recipe. Made some adjustments to kick it up a cheese flavor a notch. Added Asiago, Aged white cheddar and a little smoked gouda instead of mozza. Increased the garlic and dijon and added horseradish. Kaboom. All the guests were huddled around this one dish. However you make it, it's got a good foundation.

I don't usually give four forks, but this one got such good reviews at my daughter's graduation party I decided it was deserving!! The only adjustment needed is to increase the amount of minced jalapeno to take the flavor hit up a "notch"!! If you like artichoke dip, this one is a definite keeper.

I chose this recipe for our neighborhood's Memorial Day bbq (2006); like others, I only used 1 8-oz bar of philly cream cheesewith a few changes (thanks to everyone for their suggestions!). I also used fresh squeezed lemon, added parmesan cheese, and only 1 14 oz. can of artichoke hearts (packed in water). I included 1 10-oz pkg of chopped spinach (defrosted overnight in the fridge). I left out the jalapeno chili. I mixed it by hand rather than using my food processor (saves time cleaning). Needless to say, both my husband and I agree it's going to be a hit tomorrow. Really tasty, nice consistency. I was able to pick up a 1-lb. pkg of garlic parmesan flavored pita chips from our local Kroger. Thanks again!

I made the following changes for a different style of dish: I didn't use the mozzarella cheese, and I didn't bake the recipe. Instead, I hollowed a large, round loaf of bread (cutting it toward the top, like a lid) and placed the dip inside. Cut the hollowed-out bread into chunks and place around the loaf on the plate. When the chunks are gone, start using the crust. Yum!

Definitely not a dip for dieters but I'll be making this dip again and again. It's quite rich and I'm going to try it next time with less mayo and more jalapenos. Even with regular pita (untoasted), it's great!

Everyone who tries this recipe loves it!! It is great as is, or I like these variations: add 3/4 Cup drained spinach and delete some artichoke to maintain proper texture. For those who like it hot red pepper flakes and some finely diced jalapenos are WOW, AWESOME!!!

Thought the recipe was too rich and thick. Maybe need to use less mayo, if I decide to make it again. Also, could use a little bump in the spices. Overall, so-so.

This is just a brilliant recipe but I always add a few extras to any recipe as all recipes should be done to taste. I added 1 package of chive cream cheese and 1 plain, also spinach, a whole jar of red jalapeño chillies for extra flavour and color, extra garlic and a good handful of fresh parmesan cheese...I also omitted the mayo as no need I think. Try it this way and tell me if it is not better than the original! Enjoy!

Rating: 3
Very tasty! I did make some mods which made it sublime (my 93 year old grandma and my 9 year old as well as everybody in between raved). I added a package of frozen chopped spinach (after draining very thoroughly). I also put in four cloves of garlic (one is too little for garlic lovers!). Finally, I baked it longer (about 30 minutes). The result was a dip that wound up being the main course (we decided not to eat the steaks and just nosh!). The pita chips are also great - need more time, though (15 min or so). You can get creative with them: sprinkle them with lemon pepper or chile and garlic powder or dried thyme and rosemary (whatever suits your fancy). A fifty cent loaf of pita bread (care of my neighborhood Middle Eastern themed farmers market) makes as many chips as are in a $5.00 tub of Waleed's chips (somebody is making some $$$!).

I made this recipe for the first time in november of 2001, and it has become a family and friend favorite. cut the recipe in half to reduce the amount the recipe makes a lot. If you leave an ingredient out, it still has a chance to taste good. A little imagination can turn this recipe into other apps. This is a great recipe and the pita chips are great for just snacking.

This dip got such rave reviews--almost everyone asked for the recipe. This was huge and rich--would cut the recipe in half for a smaller gathering. I used canned artichoke hearts and think it was the right decision. Almost skipped the pita chips, but they are so perfect for this dip (and easy)-I will never make it without them. To the reviewer who thought this was bland--if you want more zing, use some cayenne or more jalapenos. I thought it was great!

This is the MOST sinful, delicious, creamy dip I have tasted to date! And the terrific thing is, if you go with fat-free or lowfat ingredients you don't have any of the guilt! I followed the advice of the previous cooks and went with canned vs marinated artichokes ~ MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! I also added the seasonings with a heavy hand. It turned out simply delicious! One note, when I reheated it for lunch the following day I threw in a handful of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, it absolutely brought all the good flavors to the fore and made it even better than the original recipe. I would definitely add the cheddar next time. Fantastic!

I used 2 jars artichokes and added one package frozen spinach. Worked well. The jalapenos make it -- nice depth but not too spicy. Got several requests for the recipe after taking this to a party.

A good version of a popular favorite. This can take lots of fiddling (as other reviews indicate). I cut down on cream cheese, substituted yogurt for sour cream, and doubled jalapenos. Yummy and still incredibly rich. I also use a herb/spice salt mixture on the pitas - makes them even tastier (everyone kept asking where I bought them!) and used the large very thin pitas instead of small and fat. A definite party favorite.

This was not a bad recipe. I brought it to a friend's birthday party and it was quite well received. I, on the other hand, found it to be a touch too sour.

Served in a carved-out boule to a bunch of displaced midwesterners, who all loved the creaminess. I used two 14 oz cans of artichoke hearts, and loved the texture. I also upped the mayo and sour cream, and substituted Parmesan for the mozzarella. Next time I will also add a package of spinach. I served it with bread and vegetables, and sent people home with leftovers. P.S. - The bread bowl was heavenly once the dip was gone.

I had a New Year's Day dinner to go to, and needed an idea for a fast appetizer. I chose this from the website, and it worked wonderfully. It was a hit - and the first to try it was a gourmand. He loved it! I took some of the suggestions previously mentioned (1/2 C mayo and 1/2 C sour cream, add handful of freshly grated parmesan) but left in the two pkgs of cream cheese. I like it spicy so also increased the hot sauce a little and added a little more jalapeno. I will keep this one.

I thought this artichoke dip would be yummy with the jalepeno chilies, but it was way too thick and rich. Too much cream cheese, not enough mayo.

Calling all dip lovers!!! We are dip experts, and this is one of the best dips we've ever had! It takes a little more work than your normal dip, but it's worth the effort.

Also added extra garlic and some extra canned chopped chiles for extra kick. The dip turned out great, and we'll definitely make it again.

I used my food processsor to ensure that the consistency was good. I baked it in a ceramic pie plate. The dip was quickly and completely devoured at the party.

Wow! The few adjustments I made gave it just the extra oomph we like in Louisiana. A generous sprinkling of Emeril's Essence and just pour the Tabasco pepper sauce right in. It needed a little salt and some cayenne pepper as well. It's best to just add all 4 seasonings till it has the power you want. I also used no fat sour cream to cut some calories after dumping in about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.

This recipe had a wonderful array of ingredients, but the resulting dish was a bland disappointment. The pita chips, however, were quite good. Too much cheese without much taste.

This recipe is tasty and very easy to make. My guests really enjoyed it, but I felt it was missing something that would make it really terrific.

I read all the reviews and made this anyway. First for a bookclub meeting where everyone loved it. Second, for a big open house where I doubled it and added a pound of crab meat. I baked it in a small souffle dish and an au gratin dish. I think that helps it stay creamy and moist. We all thought it was great. Oh yes, since we live in New Mexico I added chopped fresh green chiles to taste instead of jalapenos. I did not have any leftovers!

I made this to use up a large jar of artichoke hearts that had been sitting in the pantry. This was rich, but it was dry and and heavy. . . not light and bubbly like the "old" version that showed up on every buffet in the '80s. I think probably too much cream cheese and not enough mayo.

I tried this out based on the rave reviews. It wasn't as good as another Artichoke Dip recipe that I regularly use. I found it a little too bland, but that's probably because I didn't have jalapenos so I substituted roasted red pepper instead. I always use fresh baby artichokes rather than canned/jarred, so it's possible that also affected the outcome.

Great recipe. Most similar artichoke dips are overly heavy and dense and this had a light, fresh character, owing mostly to the fresh jalapeno and lemon juice.

I read all the reviews decrying this recipe, and I feel that the first thing that needs to be considered is that it comes from Ligonier, PA--a beautiful city, but not one known for being on the edge culinary concepts. Second, the ingredients are very good, the proportions listed just make it a little bland. I tried the following combo of the same stuff and it was AWESOME--guests were eating it with a spoon: 12 oz. cream cheese; 14 oz. chopped chokes, marinated and drained; 1/2 jalapeno pepper, chopped, seeds and gills removed; 1/3 cup low fat sour cream; 1/4 cup mayonnaise; 1/2 cup parmesean cheese; 1 tbs. worstershire sauce; 1 tablespoon dijon mustard; combine, bake at 400 degrees for 20 mintues, serve it and watch the crowd go wild! So the recipe takes a little alteration, but isn't that what cooking's all about? This is a definite crowd pleaser.

Made this last night for New Year's Eve and it was hot and bubbly when guests came in from the cold. I know, Texas is not cold! Can't figure out how all of the reveiws are so different from each other.

After reading the other reviews, I was a little nervous about trying this dish - thanks for the input, though--it helped! Before baking, I added freshly grated Parmesan cheese to the dip mixture (to taste) and then (liberally) sprinkled some more Parmesan on top of the dish. I also added a LITTLE extra sour cream, Worcestershire and Tabasco. I took the dip to two different family gatherings, and it was enjoyed by all. The pita chips were a nice touch - this recipe makes a lot of dip, so I would recommend doubling the amount of pita chips.

I thought this recipe had great potential given the ingredients,but it was a big disappointment. Way too dry. I have artichoke dip recipes that are much better than this

My family and I really enjoyed this dip, but I had to make some substitutions - I used 1 can of artichoke hearts and two small cans of water chestnuts, chopped. I had no jalapenos so I used red pepper flakes. No onions in the house, so I used the ole standbye envelope of french onion soup. Ultimately, not really the same dip at all, I guess!

Have made this twice already and am making it again for Christmas Eve! It is very tasty and easy to make. Be sure the jalapeno you use is spicy (taste it before you cut it -- some are so mild you'd think you were eating a sweet bell pepper). You might need to add more red pepper sauce if the jalapeno is mild. I also found it tasted better only slightly warm as opposed to hot from the oven.

My company loved this appetizer before thanksgiving dinner.

LOVED this recipe! Made just half of it for my family (7 of us with inlaws and "outlaws") and it was the first thing to go. I omitted the jalapenos (I'm allergic) and substituted a tablespoon of minced dried onion for the green onions, as mine had spoiled in the crisper. I also used 2 jars of marinated artichoke hearts, and that may be what the previous cooks need (more of this) to kick up the taste. Increased the mozzarella as well, for volume. EVERYONE left with the recipe.

I agree with the reviewer that gave it 1 fork---it certainly does not bubble or brown. I think the recipe calls for too much cream cheese. I might cut down on the cream cheese next time and add more mayo. My guests liked it, but it certainly was not one of the best dips I have ever made. Needs salt and something else to zing it up. It certainly has good ingredients. It has the potential to be very good, but something is missing.....

I made this last night to bring to a cocktail party. I thought this dip was a just ok and certainly not that eye catching...there are a lot of great ingredients that somehow never quite come together. I increased the jalepeno and it still was blah. Not sure about the browned and bubbly part either...this was just the great white mess! The best part about this dip was the pita chips....which guests used to scoop up other dip offerings.

This is the best artichoke dip I've ever made. I really liked it with the pita chips, too, although 20 minutes is WAY too long to bake the chips--they were blackened after 15 minutes! I would suggest checking them for doneness after 8-10 minutes. The recipe makes a lot of dip, so unless you're making it for a big party, I would suggest cutting it in half.
