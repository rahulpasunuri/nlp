I thought this was wonderful! Make sure the peppers are completely charred for best flavor and seed them over a bowl with strainer to catch the flavorful juices within. If you like more "punch," add more garlic, or consider a pinch of cayenne. My guests raved and all wanted the recipe.

I have to agree with a previous reviewer that said she found this recipe to be bland. It didn't have any "punch" to it and the flavors didn't seem to flow like they do in good tomato bruschetta.

I served this at my cocktail party and while it was eaten quickly, I thought it was lacking in something. I would probably add tomatoes to the recipe next time.

This dish had beautiful presentation...but was a bit bland. Would make it again with a few add ins...the goat cheese sounds like a good idea. Will try that next time.

A nice taste and colorful presentation. A bit of feta is indeed a nice addition.

I add crumbled goat cheese along with the basil and it adds a really nice zing!

As a visual, these look wonderful! In addition to the olive oil, I added a dash of balsamic vinegar as well as large shaved parmesan cheese curls topped on half of the bruschettas and toasted pine nuts on the others. Great raves!
