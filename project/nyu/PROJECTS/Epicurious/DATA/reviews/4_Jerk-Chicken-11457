I've made this recipe several times over the years for different people and get the same rave reviews. The only thing I do differently is I bake it in all the sauce instead of grilling it. The sauce whips together easily. Very little hands on time with this dish. You can definitely up the peppers and still keep the heat palatable. I highly recommend allowing 2-3 days for marinating. The meat comes out so flavorful and moist. I usually serve this with plain rice and either sweet potatoes, squash or pan fried sweet plantains. Excellent recipe!

This was great! I made exactly as in the recipe, except that I baked and used all thighs. Not as spicy as I feared after reading the Scoville numbers on Scotch bonnets; I'll pop it up some next time. I served with a rice and black bean "salad" (and some carrots). Had a 2nd dinner by mixing shredded leftover chicken with the rice and black bean salad, and with corn kernels mixed in. Was two days later, and anyway felt more like a new recipe than leftovers.

I made this marinade last night. I had a jar of Jerk Sauce brought back from Jamaica on hand to compare it to. The jar was more salty, but otherwise this is dead on. Plus some points for the freshness versus the jar.

I used this marinade to make chicken wings for a neighborhood "Tropic al Winter" theme party. I was surprised at how green the marinade was (due to the scallion), but it turned the expected brown during cooking. Rather than grill the wings, I baked them according to the method given in the Gourmet 1991 recipe for Jerk Chicken Wings (450F oven for 30-35 min). Flavor was exactly what I was after - and recieved compliment after compliment from the guests. I will definitely be repeating this in the summer on the grill!

this recipe is simply outstanding. I do use 4 habaneros with the seeds and a tablespoon of molasses and marinate the chicken for two days. just BBQ it slow over low heat otherwise it will burn. it is incredible

OUTSTANDING! I cook this recipe for Jamaicans and they all want to buy my sauce. I have taken the advice of previous reviews and double the Scotch Bonnets, plus add a tablespoon of molasses. This sauce is just incredible

Soooooooo amazing, I made this a year ago for the first of many times. Everyone loves this and you don't get tired of it. I marinate it for 3 days. I use dark meat only (whole leg quarter or cut up.) then I grill them over direct med. heat with the lid closed for 15 minutes per side. Always perfect. I always marinate this in large batches and freeze some after marinating for three days.

I have been trying to find a recipe for jerk seasoning that is close to what I used to get from a Jamaican supermarket in North Carolina. This definitely was not it. It tastes okay, but not what I'm looking for in a jerk. I doubt I will make it again.

This is amazingly tasty for the minimal effort it requires. I baked it out of necessity (no way to grill it) and loved this. My husband asked after the first bite "When can we have this again?"

Excellent! I have made this dish twice so far. The first time, I grilled it. The second time I baked it. I actually prefer baking it. It made the chicken very moist. I wrapped chicken in foil and baked 375, then I remove top foil and broiled the top brown. Then turned the chicken over to broil the other side. I will try the grill again this summer, since so many cooks praise the grilling method. The only adjustment I would do is cut back on the salt. We used three habeneros - spicy!!!

Took the advice of former reviewers and doubled the habaneros and added a bit of molasses. I can't stop eating this! I wish I had made much more - but it was so simple, that I'll certainly make it again very soon. Very authentic.

Rating: 3
This was really good. I used leg quarters and cooked them on a rack in a roasting pan since it was too hot outside to fire up the grill. The only change I made with the seasonings is I used a teaspoon of salt (kosher) instead of a tablespoon. I will definitely make this again and will make it on the grill. I served spicy black beans, rice, and a mango salsa with it.

wonderful and left the recipe as it. A nice accompaniment for this dish is papaya, mango salsa with red onion and cucumber. I made a citrus sauce for the salsa and also served coconut rice. What a winner. I even made squash fritters for an appetizers and I could not cook them fast enough. WINNER!!!

Delicious! I made two batches for dinner guests; one with Scotch Bonnets, one with jalapenos. Essentially, both batches tasted the same; one was just hotter than the other. I also took the suggestion of one reviewer and used about a teaspoon of molasses, which added a touch of sweetness.

Rating: 4
I consider myself a purist and I can't image this without Scotch Bonnets. It gives the dish the real flavor. I recommend a little molasses rather than the overwhelming traits of soy sauce. Fresh thyme, Jamican pimento (allspice) and scallion are also a must. Ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, garlic, onion are optional and add only hints of character to the flavor. This is the perfect summer dish and if you ever go to Jamaica, go to Boston Beach for the most authentic Jerk you will ever taste.

This recipe was easy and tasty. However, I'd cut the salt a little ~ and, do NOT taste the marinade before using it (you'll think "this is awful!") ~ it cooks up beautifully :)

Rating: 3
Very very good! I agree-- don't you dare reduce the amount of allspice-- that's what makes it wonderful! I used chicken breasts, and marinated for 36 hours-- the chicken was *wonderfully* juicy and moist! I will admit, I tweaked it a tad-- I added a splash of bourbon-- the puree seemed a little thick, and doubled the sugar. I think next time-- the only change I would make would be to double the habaneros...It wasn't quite spicy enough for us. True jerk in my opinion should burn as well as tantilize, and this was surprisingly mild. But then again, here we eat chiles for breakfast, so it could just be us. :)

Rating: 4
This was damn good. To keep the true Jerk Chicken taste, don't reduce the allspice...its a great flavor. If you like your food hot, don't hesitate to add another pepper or 2.

Alright kids, this is the recipe for jerk chicken. I made this last night for a dinner party and my friends went nuts. Instead of Scotch Bonnets I used 4 jalepanos instead and it worked out great. I also added 1/2 cup of vinegar as well to add a little liquidity to the marinade. This is a spicy number that I'll be sure to make again!

Rating: 4
I have prepared this recipe >5 times. DO NOT reduce the Allspice as suggested by other reviewers. It's perfect as is. It's also great when using boneless chicken breast strips and grilling on a stick (kids love it this way). Freezes very well. Have frozen for two months with spectacular results.

Rating: 4
I made this over the fourth of July and was sufficiently satisfied with the outcome. As suggested by other reviewers, I cut back on the allspice by more than half, and because I marinated it for a couple of days, I didn't add the lime juice until a few hours before I put it on the grill. This recipe is very easy and I was glad that it came together so easily. I used only half of the sauce and have stored the remainder in my 'fridge since July. I used it today to marinate chicken for tomorrow, and it held up very well over the last month. I will certainly make this over and over again. It's much better than the purchased sauce that I got while I was in Jamaica last year, and better than anything I ate while I was there. I will probably try it with tofu, too, as one reviewer suggested.

I throw a some in with chicken parts in zip lock bag and freeze. Chicken will marinate during freeze and thaw. A great way to have something special on hand to throw on the BBQ.

We make this for our family events which include my 11 children and spouses. They absolutely ADORE it. Making it today for Mother's Day. We're used to midwest cooking and since we're Irish/Italian-Americans, we never had exposure to anything other than meat, potatoes and pasta. However, we love variety and love "Island" food.

Please disregard the previous review. The reviewer HATES onions and garlic, yet prepares jerk. Does he/she also HATE vinegar yet prepares Eggs Benedict? Does he/she also HATE lard yet enjoys properly made frijoles? I wouldn't eat a spoonful of salt - does that mean I hate salt?

I've made this many times, and it's perfect. My uncle, who frequently travels to Jamaica, says it's very authentic. Make-ahead note: this stuff freezes GREAT. After marinating just pop it in the freezer, and it's on hand any time for a really spectacular last-minute supper.

I cut the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I increased the habaneros to 3 (if it doesn't make the eyes water, it's not hot enough), used 2 Tb fresh thyme and cut back the allspice to 1 tsp. I eliminated the lime juice as well so I could marinate for 24 hours. The marinade keeps for up to a month. Hint to the cook that burned herself: oil your fingers well before handling hot chiles or don't seed them. I have used this marinade on peeled chunks of potato grilled over indirect heat for 30 minutes. Comes out great.

Can't wait to try this one. Sounds delicious. A comment re: the "stinging fingers" I did that once so badly I was about to call the hospital (after trying almost everything I could think of). Then I thought I would try ONE MORE THING. Chloraseptic throat spray. Yes, on my fingers. I WORKED. I don't think the manufacturers have thought of listing that use on the bottle.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe. I've made it twice now...once for a quartered chicken, and once with wings for a party. The second time, I used three habaneros and a serrano (since just using two habaneros did not yield sufficiently spicy jerk sauce), and the results were fantastic -- quite spicy and delicious. Also, in case you need to make a vegan/vegetarian alternative, use same marinade for some extra firm tofu (though just marinate for one hour), and bake at 350 for about 20 minutes. Enjoyed by everyone!

Rating: 2
Since we can't barbeque, my rating probably isn't fair. I broiled it and it came out kind of dry. But the important part is DON'T FORGET THE RUBBER GLOVES! I ignored this part, and as a result, not only did my cat get sick immediately after eating something I touched after I touched the peppers, but it took 3 days for my fingers to stop stinging!!

Rating: 4
Tremendous recipe. However, strongly advice that, if you want to marinate overnight, do not add the lime juice until 4 hours before bbq-ing. Citrus and other acids actually cook the meat, and will drain the flavour if marinading too long.

We made this over labor day weekend and it turned out wonderful. We let the chicken marinate for 48 hours and it was really flavorful. Next time I would probably add a bit more habanero for some extra kick. This one is a keeper!

wow! this is permanent addition to the file. the market had no fresh habaneros, so i used serranos from the garden plus a jalapeno. i trio-ed this with "west indian rice and beans"(bon appetit, 3/97) and "fruit salad with poppy seed dressing" (bon appetit, 3/96) it took some time to get together, but well worth it.

This was the first time I have made Jerk Chicken and it came out pretty well. I tweaked the recipe a bit - used jalipeno peppers which I roasted and seeded for a milder touch. I also upped the amount of lime juice and added a splash of apple cider vinegar, merinated for 2 full days and then broiled it. I recommend broiling vs. baking... And wow, it was really, really Yummy.

Rating: 4
I LOVE jerk seasoning, but many will not. The intense scovilles will turn off a good bunch, and the agressive aromatics of spices like cinnamon and allspice will inspire either worship or loathing. This is a fine "wet" version. I would encourage all who love this recipe to dig up a "dry" rub recipe or invent one (based on substitution) to have a supply on hand for use at any time. Shrimp, chicken (especially dark meat) and pork tend to be my favorite uses for jerk, but beef is also a popular subject, and I would encourage people to use creativity if this range of flavors inspres them. I think the key to this dish is using freshly ground allspice. Try it with candied squash and braised greens.

The second time I made this, I baked it. Bad decision! Grilling is the only way to go!

Rating: 2
I will admit that I baked vs. grilled my chicken, which may account for my less than stellar rating, but I just didn't really love this recipe. I thought it was too heavy on the allspice, and the marinade was thick and clumped onto the chicken. It seems like it needed oil to get things flowing! I've never tried Jerk seasoning before, so my objection may not be to this recipe per se.

We add the juice of one orange to the marinade. Serve with black beans and rice and fried plaintains.

Rating: 3
This recipe got a feverishly good response from the guests we had at our cabin over the Labor Day weekend. Another couple bumped me out of serving it the first night, so the chicken got a chance to marinate for almost 72 hours and I think it was probably even more delicious because of that. The spicy/sweetness of this is perfect for barbeque and a refreshing change of pace from the ordinary BBQ fare.

GREAT recipe. I kept everything the same (don't omit the cinnamon!!) except for the peppers - couldn't find required ones so I used one jalapeno and two unidentified peppers. This was not too spicy at all, in fact I could not sense any peppers in the dish except for the flavour. Kids would like this chicken, too, which suprises me.

The only change we made to this recipe was to use serrano peppers instead of scotch bonnett or habanero chilies (none available). My family loved it! Once my youngest daughter tasted it, she ate only the chicken until it was gone. Later she finished the rest of the meal. I would recommend that everyone try this at least once.

This recipe is perfect. There are a lot of ingredients in the sauce and every single one is important. If you can't find the scotch bonnet or habanero chiles...don't bother.

It was okay, but not great. Even after marinading the chicken for two days, the flavor did not seem to infuse the meat to the extent I would have expected.

Now, if we could get that recipie, I'd gladly spend all day in the kitchen! Anyone know the place I am referring to?

Oh, my. We just finished this. I can't imagine why I'd ever want chicken done any other way.

Here's another idea for this great marinade... For Jerk Chicken Wings, prepare marinade as directed then place 5lbs of chicken wings in a Reynolds oven bag, pour the sauce over, tie the bag and cut 2-3 small slits for steam to release. Bake at 350 for 50-60 minutes. The chicken is moist and falls off the bone...lovely. I prefer this method over the other jerk chicken wings recipe on file. *Addendum: Use the Large size bag and be sure to place the chicken wings in the bag on a cookie sheet or pan so that the bag does not touch any part of the oven..otherwise, enjoy your wings with a touch of noxious plastic seasoning.

Rating: 4
The chicken had complex and delicious flavors, and it was not as fiery as we might have expected. On a previous reviewer's advice, I took the processor out on the deck to combine the marinade ingredients. The habaneros do make their presence known. Served this with Caribbean Rice and Beans - (Bon Apetit Light and Easy)- (excellent!) and the salad of Cuban-Style Grilled Mojo Chicken with Greens, Avocados, and Mangos (Bon Apetit, Sept. 1997)- minus the chicken. This salad was perfect with the dinner. I would make it again with the Mojo Chicken for a main-course salad. Grilled garlic bread rounded out the meal. We will certainly have this again.

We have been making this recipe for 6 years - ever since it was published, and we love it! We have made it with every kind of chicken part, and yes, it is great on pork - especially tenderloins. We have also used it on shrimp - only marinate it for 1 day - save a little of the marinade you make for the chicken and put the shrimp in a separate bag on the second day - and most surprising of all - we marinated firm tofu for our vegan son - same way as the shrimp, and he said it was fabulous - just slice the block of tofu into 1/2 to 3/4 inch slices, and grill very quickly! Enjoy!

This recipe is wonderful. Even though I have the Gourmet issue with it in it's on our computer because we've had so many requests for it.
