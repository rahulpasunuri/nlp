Yummy, easy, greasy. It's a Mexican sausage casserole, don't ask it to be anything more. It might get most of it's flavor from sausage and cheese, but that doesn't make it bland at all - just something you might want to enjoy occasionally.

I served this at a football party yesterday, and it got raves. I used hot italian sausage and drained it on paper towels twice before adding to the casserole. It was fine. added cilantro and some green onion to the top after baking.

Thought this was very good - used hot sausage and didn't find the outcome greasy at all - I did cook it to death though. Added scallions to mixture and used Mexican Blend cheese - also put some jalapeno peppers chopped on top of the cheese. Was plenty spicy. To the cook from Sakatoon SK - guess you not only rate recipes but are a Doctor too! - leave the smokers be for crying out loud!

This is typically called a Queso Flameado, except you put alcohol on top and light it on fire after removing from the oven. You can also do it with steak or chicken. Very tastey. Made with chorizo and will make it again. Did have to use a strainer after cooking the chorizo as it can get pretty greasy. My husband LOVES Mexican (obviously cause I am too!) and he really liked this recipe.

I agree with others that even with draining, this dish was still greasy. I'd also agree that this dish needs a lot of doctoring to make it interesting: adding chicken, only certain sausages, olives, more hot sauce, etc, etc. There are just too many other recipes to try, I wouldn't bother making this again.

Even with good draining it was still too greasy. Maybe I didn't have high enough quality sausage. I agree with some of the other reviews that a spicier sausage might be better.

A few additions- chorizo & precooked chicken breast. Added guacamole at the end to quell any fires my kids couldn't handle. Everyone LOVED this.

Very tasty. You definitely want to drain the sausage well (I used Octoberfest sausage but I agree with others that chorizo is probably best) and drain off some of the fat from the cheese (you could probably reduce the amount as well) to reduce cholesterol. I didn't find the dish at all lacking in flavour; those who did are undoubtedly smokers. I will definitely make it again.

This is a great, easy and fast recipe! I didn't feel the need to change it but you can easily make it spicer by the amount of chilies you put in and the tobasco. Definitely a keeper.

I doubled the recipe for a party, and it turned out great. Because of time constraints, I cooked the sausage, added the chillis and celantro, and refridgerated overnight, adding the cheeses the next day prior to warming. Also a little spicier would do no harm. Definitely a Keeper! Salut

I tried this recipe incorporating the suggestions of the other reviewers -- anduille sausage, extra hot sauce, black olives, etc. -- and while it was a bit spicier than it otherwise would have been, I found it was still was quite boring overall. Best to skip this recipe and try something else...

This is a great base recipe to work with. Try hot sausage and pepper jack or taco blend cheeses to spice it up. I really enjoy working with this. It's fast, simple and can really be delicious if you take a little creative liberty.

I have to agree with the rest of the reviews, if the dish had more flavor I would give it 3 or 4 forks, that's not to say I didn't like it because I did. But I spiced it up right from the start with hot sausage, hot peppers, scallions additional hot sauce and added sliced black olives to the cheese topping along with the cilantro. Turned out very well. I make this one again.

Do not attempt to make this without using chorizo or anduille sausage. It needs this for flavor and to carry the description of being "Mexican."

I used Chorizo sausage and it was a big improvement! Gave it just the kick it needed. The kids loved this and it is incredibly easy.

This was sooo easy but lacking in the flavor department. I added an equal amount of habeneros peppers finely chopped (I like my stuff hot) and doubled the tobasco. I also used a monterey Jack with peppers already in it. Big improvement

I don't cook a lot so I wanted something easy, but it really did end up on the bland side. I used some onion and twice the amount of hot sauce suggested, and it still tasted a little flat. I suggest more seasoning and maybe even some black olives on top.

The one really good thing about this meal was its ease. Kind of boring taste-wise though. Next time I'll have to jazz it up somehow... Maybe MORE tobasco sauce!

Very tasty. I added some onions, served with refried beans and rice.
