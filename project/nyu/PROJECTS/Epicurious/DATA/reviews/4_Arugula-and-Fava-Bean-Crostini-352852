I've made this numerous times and ways. Here's my final verdict, in order of preference: 1: Make the recipe as is, with fresh fava beans. I've never understood the complaints about the work to get to favas, they are always worth it. 2: Substitute lima beans for the favas. I've done this a few times, when arugula was still plentiful and favas were gone. This needs a bit more umami, it's missing the lovely, subtle flavors of the favas, but a little doctoring does the trick. More lemon juice and zest (to taste, I used just a bit more) and an extra tablespoon or so of cheese. And, it's lovely. 3: Substitute edamame for favas. I really struggled with this one. When I made it as is, the whole thing was bland, dominated by the soy. Note that I use really peppery, strong arugula from my local market. I ended up with a mixture with about 1.5 the amount of arugula called for, double the lemon juice and zest, and almost double the cheese. If you're going to use a substitute, take limas over edamame every time... But the favas! Oh, so very, very good.

These were very tasty! I couldn't find fresh fava beans yet but they were great made with canned (just not as vibrantly green).

I make this whenever fava beans are in season - great for something fresh and earthy.

I thought it was good, my friend thought it was bitter. Was it the edamame? It definiately needs more salt and more olive oil.

Made this again last night to bring to a dinner party. I was unable to purchase arugula this time, so substituted baby spinach with good results. Of course it didn't have the peppery flavour of arugula but was good in a pinch. Served it with a Californian sauvignon blanc which was a lovely pairing.

Delicious! My kids love it too -- even the one who can't stand greens. I took others' suggestion and added garlic to the blender. Then I chopped the mint with the arugula. Both adjustments made it easier to make and serve w/o diminishing the taste.

Very good, will make it again, and have no reservations about serving it to guests. As suggested by other reviewers, I added the garlic left over from the crostini, and added a little more lemon juice than the recipe required. The texture and colour were beautiful, and it was both healthful and delicious. And I used frozen edamame as well.

Using shelled, frozen edamame makes this a snap. I recommend putting the garlic clove, chopped, into the processor with everything else (can never have too much garlic...). Consider evening out the chopped and processed arugula as well. Then go to town eating, adapting, mixing with pasta, goat cheese, whatever! It's really quite good and a great way to use arugula that might spoil before you get around to that salad you were going to have...

Wow did this recipe ever surprise me! It is delicious. I used piave vecchio for the cheese, and arugula and mint from my garden. Substitutes: ciabatta bread cut into crostini size slices, and frozen lima beans in place of the fava.

Delicious - I made it along with 5 other Italian appetizers and it was the standout. I used shelled frozen edamame and it was still great.

I made with edamame and loved it. 'HUGE hit at my Oscars viewing party this year as "Soy Story III."

Pretty nice, made with edamame instead of favas because it's what I had on hand. Made for a nice lunch, and it tastes good just with potato chips!

Great easy, impressive dinner party appetizer. I used frozen edamame and it was great. Im sure it would be good with fava beans too but they didnt look great at whole foods. I used much less oil and didnt drizzle at the end it was plenty rich. Great leftovers - mix with brown rice and put over a bed of arugula for a great lunch. Making this again for a dinner party on Saturday!

This was fantastic. Refreshing and a little spicy with the garlic and arugula. My husband made it while I was away, so I assume he didn't change a thing. Everyone at the dinner party loved it.

I have made this countless times, usually with edamame. I play with the amounts and it always turns out fine. Lemon zest is essential. We love it with crostini and goat cheese as a light dinner.

Incredibly flavorful and fresh tasting. The fava beans take some work to shell, but I thought it was worth it. Great creamy texture and the arugula gave it a great kick.

Delicious! I used edamame for ease, and the flavor was excellent. I didn't, and wouldn't, change a thing. You have to love arugula, but if you do, you'll love this dish. Got rave reviews.

This recipe is delicious, but calls for just a bit too much salt. I used fresh cranberry beans instead of fava beans, which turned out well, and I bet canned beans could work decently well in this recipe, too. Next time I might try using less olive oil.

This takes a while to prepare and it can be difficult to find fava beans but it's well worth it. It's great with some wine and liver, like in Silence of the Lambs

I used fresh fava beans from my garden and so upped the amount of them and backed off arugula as others suggested. Real nice. Possibly worth a post on my blog even.

I made this again and have to up the rating to 4 stars. Not only were the crostini popular at a dinner party, I tossed the leftover fava bean mixture with some whole wheat pasta, fresh cherry tomatoes, mint leaves, and extra cheese and it was outstanding.

Love it! I used edamame instead of the fava beans and lime instead of lemon. Was lazy this time and just spread the topping on premade crostini from Whole Foods. So delicious!

Everyone loved it but I felt the arugula overpowered the fava beans. The fava beans have enough flavor to stand on their own. Will try again without the arugula.

If you like fava beans and arugula, this is just perfect. I wouldn't change a thing.

Had everything but the arugula on hand. Made it without, was fabulous. Did not measure the ingredients, just kept adding until it popped. Like the idea of the peppery arugula not only for taste, but also to help stretch the pricey fava beans.

I have made this several times (with the edamame, never tried the fava- beans) for parties and it is always a hit!

Rating: 4
This is a go-to hors d'oeuvres for me. I've made it with both the fava beans and frozen edamame, and prefer the edamame for both taste and simplicity in prep. I get a lot of doubtful looks when I explain what it is, but they're always followed by an empty platter.

Couldn't be easier and can be adjusted for available ingredients and preferences in flavor: more or less lemon, more or less cheese, etc. Fresh and tasty and not too filling.

The color of this is phenomenal. I like the varied texture and health benefits, too... But it was missing a punch... needing more lemon zest, garlic, cheese? Not sure. Liked it & would try it again with some tweaking.

I had never used favas or arugula before, so was excited to try this recipe when I found both at the farmer's market this weekend. I liked the favas just on their own, but really didn't like the favor of the arugula. When combined and on the garlic crostini it was good, but not great for me. My husband liked it, so will try again. Would like a green to sub out the arugula though.

I had another recipe for fava bean crostini but this is my new favorite. The lemon adds the right amount of zest. I served this to an extremely picky eater and he raved about it. I had some left over and tossed it with whole wheat farfalle and goat cheese.

Yummy! Great flavor and fresh taste. I ate a half recipe for myself as a light dinner. It was great.

Brought this to a friend's birthday party and the crowd seemed to enjoy. I subbed edamame and added a bit more cheese than the recipe calls for because I love pecorino romano. It was yummy! It tasted best when the toasts and the bean mixture were at their freshest--when I came back to the tray later in the evening I thought they had lost a certain something.

Rating: 4
absolutely delicious. The earthiness of the beans is a perfect foil for the spicy mint and raw garlic rub. It's more delicious using fresh Pecorino Toscano, but the Parm-Reg is a passable substitute. These have become a regular light evening dinner with a bottle or two of Maremma or Chianti wine!

Fantastic, fresh and simple recipe. I used edamame and parmesan.

The flavor was ok, but I found the texture to be strange, kind of like baby food. I used a blender for the processing, however, and if I did it again I would pull out the Cuisinart, in hopes of improvement on that. Not my favorite crostini recipe.

I made these with edamame beans and they were terrific. The only changes I made were to up the amount of lemon zest to about 3/4 teaspoon and skipped the juice. I also cut back on the olive oil a bit. The extra lemon zest gave it some needed zip. I also brushed the bread with a mixture of olive oil and finely minced garlic to give the crostini more garlic taste. Our guests asked for the recipe.

I made these crostini for a wine tasting party and they were perfect. I had never made favas before, but really pretty easy, albeit it took some time to get them out of their pods and outer skins. I used parmesan instead of pecorino. The flavor was delicious and they looked really lovely on the platter.
