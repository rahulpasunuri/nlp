I made this exactly as instructed and enjoyed it very much. I thought the flavors were great. Then I made it several more times using just whole eggs instead of the more egg white ratio and adding some garlic salt. Even better and even better at room temp. I could see any sort of veggie and spice substitutions could work, but I love oregano in a frittata.

Clean eating at its best! I've made this twice. The first time, exactly as instructed. Second time with these modifications: used half quantity of potato (I really don't care for potatoes all that much and I'm trying to be low-carb), added about 3 cups of fresh spinach that I sauteed in 1 tsp olive oil in advance and used dill instead of oregano. Who puts oregano on salmon? *lol* Finally, 50 g of goat cheese in dollops on top. EXCELLENT! My only issue is the asparagus which was 'tender crisp'. Perhaps it could go in earlier so that it's cooked through OR I could cut them smaller. In any event, it was delicious!

Loved the fresh ingredients, except not fond of the asparagus; will have to find a substitution. Easy to prepare. Even my husband liked it -- a major coup!

Lovely ingredients but tasteless and dry. I almost never used Ketchup - but this time I did - just to give it something. Maybe frittatas are not my thing.

This was a delicious and easy dinner that was very filling. I used smoked salmon from Seattle and the flavors together were just delicious.

Made this for a brunch. It was excellent. I will halve the potato portion next time but the rest was excellent. I used leek instead of onions.

Prep time took awhile, but it was delish! I just need to make it a habit of doing prep stuff on weekends i.e. having chopped onions, bell pepper, & other veggies on hand so I don't have to mess with it during the week. I took the advice of one of the other cooks & broiled the salmon before hand. I was afraid if I didn't the salmon wouldn't have been cooked enough. The whole family liked it, even the baby!

Delicious and light supper. I omitted the red peppers (personal preference) and added some fresh snipped dill. I also par-broiled the salmon before adding it to the pan.

Very easy and delicious! Substituted hot-smoked salmon (not lox), roasted red peppers, spring onion, and added tarragon. Reduced cooking time somewhat as peppers and salmon didn't need to cook. Omitted potatoes and roasted some to serve on the side.

Very good. I used cooked salmon. Question, should the salmon be uncooked? recipe does not say.

Simple and pretty tasty, although I found I was wishing for a little more...something. I will make it again with some fresh dill to liven it up a bit and maybe some lemon to garnish. Overall a nice spring dish.
