A ridiculously good pasta salad. I used half pitted olives from a can and half I chopped myself (even still, cutting around those pits took forever). It was well worth it. Awesome salad!

Excellent and very refreshing on a warm summer evening, notably when we have our own homegrown cherry and regular tomatoes to even make it more sensational! I followed the recipe adding more garlic to the olivada. When the pasta was finished cooking, I drained it, placed it in a bowl and immediately mixed the olivada into the hot pasta, stirring it around so the pasta would absorb the flavors. I later mixed in the additional ingredients, adding a can of drained cannellini beans as another reviewer had noted. The salad was wonderful and it has already been saved to my recipe file for future preparations!

Great recipe! I used good (fresh) store-bought olivada, which made the whole thing much easier, and heirloom tomatoes. Delicious. Next time, I'll add artichoke hearts as another reviewed suggested.

This was soooo delicious, and relatively easy to make too. Makes great leftovers. I plan to make this over and over.

I usually don't like pasta salad, but it was a very hot day, and I had my mother and sister here, so I went for it and made this. It was so simple, and it was great! Made it exactly as the recipe and wouldn't change a thing. Served it with Central Market roast chicken. Big hit. Everyone said to make it again.

Excellent flavor. As other reviewers noted the flavor just gets better each day! No changes to the recipe -- don't skip the anchovy paste if you want great flavor. Making the olivada is not 'time consuming' -- did follow the suggestion of the reviewer to pulse the olives alone, remove from processor and then puree other ingredients in order to control the consistency of the olivada. Took this to a pot luck -- it quickly disappeared. Will definitley make again, but it makes a lot, so would cut the recipe in half when it's just for my family.

I left out the anchovy paste because I didn't have any. My family and I loved it and i will make it again. The leftovers have gotten better every day.

I thought the recipe was great. As it is written it would be very time consuming. Instead of making the Green Olivada from scratch, I purchased Olive Tapenade from Trader Joe's and just mixed in with the pasta and the rest of the ingredients. I decided to make it more of a "greek" recipe and used feta cheese instead of mozzarella. I also added shrimp and white beans to make it a meal. It was fast, easy, and delicious!

I initially was disappointed in this recipe (I didn't use anchovy paste) because it tasted bland. But after adding parmesan cheese and letting it sit in the fridge for a day, then 2 days, then 3 days (eating it all the while), this pasta salad started to grow on me. The texture of the pasta holds up well (I used rotelle) and if you add extra seasoning, the flavors come out. I think the flavors also get better after it sits in the fridge for a day or two. Next time I make this, I may want to add sun-dried tomatos for more a flavor kick.

This was great. I made two changes- I decreased the olive oil by about half and added a can of cannellini beans to give it a bit more protein since we had it as a main dish. It was so easy! I'll be making the olivada for other recipes too.

This is a great pasta salad. Thought there were a bit too many tomatoes so I substituted a can of artichoke hearts (wihtout the leaves) for 1/2 the tomatoes. My husband, who can be finicky about food but loves artichokes really liked the salad. So this was a winner all the way around!

This was tasty, but took more time than I expected (chopping the olives, cutting 2 pints of tomatoes into halves, chopping fresh oregano). I made it tne night before a potluck lunch, at which it was well-received. Leftovers 2 days later were actually even better, as pasta really absorbed the flavors. I am wondering whether substituting jarred tapenade might simplify this dish?

Made for a big family dinner, and everyone loved it. My brother is constantly begging me to make it again.

I have made this salad twice, once for a neighborhood barbeque and once for a work picnic. On both occasions, this salad was a definite hit because not only did it taste good to my family but, more importantly, people at both picnics liked it too. Both times, I used the anchovy paste, which in a 1 tsp. quantity is simply a flavor enhancer. It does not cause the salad to taste like anchovies. I bought Italian pitted green olives from my local Co-op's deli which worked quite well. I'm not quite sure why the salad recipe requires 6 oz. of whole unpitted olives to pit and chop because I've had to buy 9 or 10 oz. of pitted olives to produce 2 cups of chopped olives. Last I checked, an olive with a pit weighs more than one without. Oh well, wonderful salad!

I used black, green and kalamata olives, reduced the capers and left the anchovies out. I made it the day before and it was so delicious after the flavors had a chance to meld. I also added red and yellow peppers, the sweetness of the peppers cut the sharp olivada just a bit. I added shredded romano cheese too. This was a hit!! I will make again. The olivada is so delicious - perfect for spreading on bread or crackers

Wow.Loved this salad.Letting it sit for a day or two in the fridge only made it better. The green olives carried all the flavour!

Fantastic. Two people were "fighting" over the leftovers. We used spicy green olives and it added a nice kick.

I substituted black olives for the green olives and actually skipped the anchovy paste all together. I did decrease the amount of crushed red pepper as well for the children. My whole family absolutely loved it (including my parents and my child)! Good as a side dish or main course on the lighter side.

I doubled up the quantities for a barbecue for 42 people, it was really delicious and easy to make but as an additional salad rather than a main meal I think i rather overdid the quantities.

I was suprised that the olivada tasted so much better on its own than on the pasta. Perhaps it would be more appealing in a smaller amount, as in the intended side dish serving, as opposed to the larger main course serving that we attempted to eat. It was just too strong of a flavor. My whole family agreed that the pasta salad would have been much better if it had called for pesto instead of olivada, and the olivada had been used for a Greek sandwich!

quite good especially after a few hours to mellow and meld. it was salty so i'l hold back on additional salt until it's set for a while. took to a party - kids and adults ate it (shocked!).

This is the best pasta salad. I followed the recipe, excedpt I subbed whole tomatoes that I seeded instead of using cherry tomatoes. I used really nice Sicilian olives which added a lot. The olivada is good enough to eat on bread. I can't wait to make this again.

Easy, delicious and looks great. My kids do not even like olives and they ate this. There were no leftovers - double the recipe so you have leftovers!Can't wait to make it again...

I really liked this salad. It was easy to make and I made it as written including all the oil. I only had whole anchovies so i threw them in the processor along with the garlic. Delicious!

This recipe is ridiculously easy and delicious. Even my picky 4-year old liked it. It's important to use really good quality olives since they are the centerpiece of the dish. I made one change. Instead of pureeing some of the olives with the other ingredients I put all the olives in the food processor alone and pulsed until I had the texture I wanted. I moved the olives to a bowl and put the remaining dressing ingredient except the oil in the food processor. I pureed those until the capers and garlic were fine, then I turned on the processor and poured the oil through the tube, emulsifying the dressing. I added the dressing to the olives and the olive mixture to the pasta. The only thing I will do differently the next time is to add a little more red pepper.

This is an excellent pasta salad, though I agree with the other reviews - a little heavy on the olive oil. I felt it made the olivada a bit runny, and not as coarse as I had hoped. Next time I will just use less oil and I'm sure it will be terrific.

This is basically a good recipe. The second time I prepared it I used Feta cheese, black olives and roasted red peppers and it was out of this world.

This salad was a hit at our bbq... I used all the dressing and it kept it moist and flavorful the whole day (and even for left overs the next day - eating it now :) The only changes I made was to include heirloom cherry tomatoes (made it so pretty!) & used whole anchovies instead of paste as I didn't have any on hand, and added one extra too.

delicious. i made it as written (except i used a little less oil) and served w/steamed brocolli and a icy cold sauvignon blanc. very simple to make as well.

made this for an anniversary party, and had no left-overs! Only change I made was to use only half of the olivada.
