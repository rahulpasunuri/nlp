wow! what else can i say? i am not a gormet cook by any means, but this was so easy, i actually felt like one. everyone loved it, and with my 14yr old that is impressive (at least to me) he actually went back for seconds! that doesnt happen very often! i made fresh corn on the cob, broccli and cauliflower, and scalloped potatos with it and it was fabulous! i will definately make it again!

We aren't broiled fish people. So I lightly floured and pan sauteed the fish until they were golden. During the last minute the fish was cooking I spread the basil butter over the fish and it turned out great. I did go easy on the garlic since it was not going to be cooked much.

This is one of my go-to recipes for fish. I usually use tilapia or catfish as it is less expensive than cod. Recipe is great on the grill ... takes only 8 minutes over low heat. I always spray my foil with cooking spray before baking or grilling to prevent sticking. If you're in a hurry and your butter is not soft, you can melt the butter, add seasonings, and spoon over the uncooked fish before baking/grilling.

I used olive oil instead of the butter. Very good. Next time I may add a bit of bread crumbs to the top as well for more texture.

I'm usually not crazy about cod, but I made this recipe with a few alterations, and it turned out absolutely delicious. I was out of lemon juice, but put some white wine in the pan and used about half the butter. Yum!

I made this with cod and flounder and both tasted great. Next time I'm going to use less Old Bay seasoning and butter.

I didn't read the recipe directions closely and it turned out as more of a steamed "en papillote" recipe than "broiled" fish fillets. Nice and easy though and tasty though, nest time I'll try the broiled version!!

Very Tasty! My husband really liked it -- and he's not a fish eater!

Wonderful. Used tilapia. DIdn't have any Old Bay, so just threw in some onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, oregano & paprika into the butter. Gave the filets a light dusting of flour & pan fried 2 mins/side. Let the butter brown just a little. Couldn't believe how something so easy turned out so delish! Served w/rice with spinach, sun dried tomatoes & feta.

I've already posted a review for this recipe, but I want to report I made it again with tilapia and yum...once again used fresh basil, parsley, garlic and oregano. My guests went nuts for it!

I thought this was pretty good, and very, very easy. As with all fish dishes, the freshness of the fish is the most important factor. I used grouper fillets. It went over well.

BAKED THEM IN A PAN WITH THE BUTTER AND SEASONINGS. USED MY GAS WEBER. GOOD. WILL MAKE IT AGAIN

This was yummy but you'll need to watch the thickness of the filets to make sure they're uniform. Made it last night and wound up burning the garlic/basil/butter mix on top of the fish b/c one of the filets took longer to cook than the others. Easy dish though, and very good. I'll use olive oil next time though. Served with mashed new potatoes and steamed broccoli.

First, to the "healthy cook" from Phila..where do i send your roses! I had bought tilapia earlier in the day at the Maine Ave Wharf here in Wash, DC and THEN looked up broiled fish on this site and bingo, the first review listed raved about using tilapia. And I ditto that, my fellow epicurean. Three words - fab-u-lous! If I'm ever on death row THIS will be my last meal. Used dried basil w/ few drops of EVOO. Spread basil butter on filets, covered w/ Saran and refrigerated coupla hours. Broiled exactly 7 min and turned off broiler. Basted with pan juices. Served over ginger rice ( Minute rice w/ roasted garlic teriyaki sauce, soy, ginger, finely chopped red pepper and scallions) and OH MY GOD...the rest is history! This will be an entertaining favorite as well as a weekday treat!!!And Fellas....this one will impress the ladies!!

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by how good this dish was. I couldn't find cod, so I made this with talipia and it was "absolutely fabulous". Everyone who likes fish should try this!!!!! We'll make this dish often. I have have already passed this onto my friends. Hooray for Epicurious.com

Very tasty, very quick, very good. I made this with haddock. My husband said it was delicious. I will try it with cod next time.

We made this with cod and it didn't do anything for the flavor. I might try it on a firmer fish and grill it.

I like a simple recipe now and again for fihs, and you can't go wrong with butter and herbs. A squeeze of lemon just before serving is nice, too. My only complaint with this particular recipe is the Old Bay seasoning...this kind of thing is good to have around for quick, simple dishes, but it would have been nice to see some spice-rack staples listed here as substitutions.

This is an excellent and relatively simple dish to make. I made it with Halibut, and got rave reviews from my guests!!

Added a little extra basil, a little less butter, & thought it was a fast, easy & delicious way to jazz up white fish. I used dory fillets, tasted just fine!
