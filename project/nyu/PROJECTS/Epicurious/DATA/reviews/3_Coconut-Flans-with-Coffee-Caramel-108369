This was absolutely delicious. I noticed the other reviewers complaining it was lacking in creaminess. The ticket to having this still be creamy is to not overbake them. They should still be a little jiggly in the center. Remember they will firm up substantially when they chill in the fridge. Also be careful not to over caramelize the espresso sugar. If you do, it will overwhelm the hint of coconut in the flan. I will definitely make these again. Absolutely amazing.

The coconut flavor was not as intense as I though it would be. The Coffee Caramel sauce was an excellent balance to the light-tasting flan. Easy to make and everyone liked it.

Just not creamy enough. I made this exactly as instructed and was disappointed with the less than creamy flan.

I have noticed so far that none of the reviewers have commented on using lite coconut milk. Both stores that I went to were out of the regular stuff, so i used a 14 oz can of lite coconut milk. I used heavy cream for half the regular milk portion to try to make up the difference in fat content. Didn't work. The result is a very fine grain (but still grainy) custard that lacked any real depth of texture. The flavor was still good, but the texture was a huge disappointment. So the moral here is stick to the full fat coconut milk.

I have made this dish a couple of times now. It's delicious when the caramel is slightly bittered by a longer cooking time, and great also when the caramel is lightly browned. It's not a difficult recipe, and it's quick!

I thought it would have more of a coconut flavor but it was creamy and I liked the coffee taste to the caramel. What is the purpose of putting the pan in another pan? I just cooked the cups in a hot bath.

I followed the recipe and actually made this twice. The first time was not a success because the flan cooked too long/too hot and the texture was not creamy enough. The second time, I added water to the pan the flans were sitting in (in addition to the pan of water the pan was already sitting in/and no kitchen towel). The result was a tasty, creamy flan.

This is one of the best flans I've ever tasted. (My husband is Cuban, so I've enjoyed a lot of flan over the years.) The coconut milk infuses the custard with just a hint of coconut and the espresso does something really fabulous to the caramel. I made the recipe exactly the first time I tried it . The individual flans were very elegant. This time I made the flan for family, so I baked it in a 9" porcelain tart pan. (All the custard barely fit but it was fine. I baked it for the same amount of time as required for the individual flans. ) I increased the amount of sugar for the caramel to 1 cup and put a shot of real espresso into it rather than the insant kind. This is a delicious, sophisticated desert that I'll be making frequently.

This recipe is not creamy enough. Tastes a lot better if half of the whole milk was replaced with sweetened condensed milk.
