This is a wonderful fast, light and easy meal. I added crushed red pepper to spice it up and dressed the pasta (I used fettucine) with a special extra virgin olive oil rather than using so much oo to wilt the arugula. I also did not add the parmesan to the pasta. I served it surrounded by spinach sauteed with olive oil and garlic, topped it all with the pine nuts and Parmesan - WOW!

not a lot of flavor in this recipe. I was very disappointed. I love arugula, so I added extra. I also added garlic and tomatoes as suggested in previous reviews, but it still didn't wow me. Not worth the calories...

Very tasty, especially if you love arugula! We added fresh yellow & red cherry tomatoes and finished it off with some good olive oil.

It was enjoyable, but it seemed like a lot of pasta to not that much arugula. The cheese and the pine nuts totally drove the dish.

This was really good, but I needed way more arugulas - it just disappeared when I added it to the pasta. I also added some garlic to add to the flavor.

Even though this was a good dish it need something else. Try sauteeing fresh garlic before the arugula and using a sun dried tomatoe pasta, or some other variety. Cut back a bit on the olive oil. This recipe does not lack calories!!

It's just delightful. A crowd pleaser.

We really enjoyed this dish. It is very quick and easy to prepare, plus it takes advantage of the abundance of arugula growing in my garden! I'll definately make this again.

Simple, but excellent tasting pasta dish. Could add in seafood or chicken to make it even better.

I liked it but I added some sundried tomatoes packed in roasted garlic olive oil (drained) and a little chicken broth at the end to moisten it up. It was a nice meatless dinner (and easy)

Really good, simple food. Reminds me of true Italian dishes. If you love pasta and arugula, this is definitely one to make...over and over.
