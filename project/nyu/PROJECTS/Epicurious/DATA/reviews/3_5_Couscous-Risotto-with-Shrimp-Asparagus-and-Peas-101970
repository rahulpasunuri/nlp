Quite tasty. i added the lemon zest as people suggested. I also added lemon juice but i think that was too much even though I put lemon on everything. To go w/the spring theme, I topped w/chopped chives.

Delicious! I absolutely love this recipe. Occasionally I will leave out one vegetable or another, based on what I have on hand, but generally stick to the recipe as written. It is a rich decadent treat that I look forward to every time I make it. Yum!

Fabulous! I cut the cream and butter in half and did find that I had to add splashes of water to get the couscous cooked to the proper consistency. I cut the recipe in half and used 1 1/2 cups couscous and one cup each of wine and stock (I used chicken). Still required a few splashes of water. I threw in a splash of lemon juice at the end. This recipe was divine!

Outstanding recipe. I used chicken in place of shrimp, but very tasty, I to would not make this often due to calories, but very tasty for that special evening!

I thought this was a delicious, decadent risotto. A few substitutions helped it have more flavor. I know you're supposed to read the recipe all the way through before you start to cook, but I was part way through the recipe before I realized it was not for regular couscous. I had some orzo on hand so I used that instead. This made the preparation a bit more labor intensive, as I had to pay attention to the doneness of the orzo and add extra liquid from time to time. I used about a cup of wine rather than 2 cups, and used chicken broth instead of vegetable. I added two cloves of garlic with the shallot and onion. A little lemon zest and juice at the end added some brightness. I didn't have any peas, and so didn't include that. I used all the cream, butter, and cheese called for. It was certainly a very rich dish and I wouldn't want to eat it all the time because of that, but it was a great treat. My husband said it was great.

This was a super easy and delicious dish. It was very adaptable to what I had on hand -- tossed in a handful of grape tomatoes for the plum tomatoes, left out the carrots, and used miso broth rather than the vegetable broth. I cut it down to serve two so found I had to add water from time to time to keep from drying out before the couscous was done. I plan to make it for a casual dinner with friends soon.

A disappointment. I made this as an alternative to traditional Easter entrees and regret that decision. The presentation was great but the flavor was lacking. If you're going to make this, I would definitely try adding lemon zest and juice for some flavor. Without modifications, this is extremely bland.

As others stated - proportions definitely off. although I used 2 cups of the couscous (definitely worth it to find the Israeli type), there was too much wine (1 cup would be sufficient and more subtle), too much asparagus and too much tomato. I added a little red bell pepper instead of the carrots and used chicken stock to enhance the flavor. Like others, made this sans cream, and it was fine. I also decreased the parmesan and butter by half - still very rich tasting. I made this as a side dish, so no shrimp. Will make this again but will try adding some fresh herbs. Although I'm not a huge garlic fan, wondered why garlic was not included.

I was pressed for time so I used Lundberg boxed Risotto Garlic Primavera. I sauted shallots, mushrooms, garlic, asparagus and shrimp. Then I stirred in the Risotto and grated and shredded Parmesean cheese and parsley. Wow. We ate every bite and wanted more.

This is a great spring recipe, chock-ful of the new season's produce! We don't eat shrimp, but I served this with broiled fish and it was wonderful. I also only used 2 cups of the couscous; thank you to all those who suggested this! And I couldn't see why this needed cream, so I left it out. The stirring during cooking, a bit of butter and the cheese combined to give it a creamy texture without all the extra fat.

Maybe my coucous was bigger than Israeli - it was pea-size when it was done cooking. It took much more liquid and much more time than the recipe said. The recipe needed more flavor. When the couscous was just tender it had a strong flour taste so I kept cooking it until it was gone, but then it was just bland. The colors were very nice but the shrimp were lost in the sea of couscous. I may try again with less cousous and add more flavor, but I'm not sure.

Yummy! A great blend of flavors! I'm not a shrimp lover so I used small prawns and I can't imagine that the shrimp would be better! I did not cut the couscous in half but wished that I had because it was too much and kept falling out of the pan! I used garlic and herb flavored couscous and it really added to the overall flavor. I will definitely be adding this to the favorites!

An excellent choice for a special dinner. Only trouble is finding the Israeli couscous. Well worth the effort. A family favorite. Tried this at Fearrington Market Cafe and couldn't wait to try it myself.

This is a good recipe well worth making again. However the amount of couscous should be cut in half - ratio of one cup per four persons - assuming that Israili couscous is no different from Mediterranean or Moroccan couscous.

The addition of a couple of cloves of garlic in the veggie broth while cooking the pearls adds a nice touch.(remove before presentation) Also, the use of some of the great mushrooms we have available today is highly recommended...
