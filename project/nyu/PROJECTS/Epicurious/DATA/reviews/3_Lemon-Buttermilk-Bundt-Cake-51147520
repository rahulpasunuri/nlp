The Lemon-Buttermilk cake is a great cake that can take on many variations. The contrasting flavors of the lemon with fruit preserves for the glaze are a show stopper.

I made this for Easter dinner and it was a big hit. Regarding the amount of zest, I used a microplane grater which produces really fine, fluffy zest and eight enormous lemons from our backyard tree. The lemon flavor was subtle but definitely there. To those who complain about the amount of sugar: this is a dessert; you make it to serve a crowd on a special occasion and everybody has a small slice.

I had this at an Easter dinner, and liked it so much I got on here to grab the recipe. It was delicious, a tiny bit on the dry side, which I don't mind in a cake of this type. The glaze was fantastic - subtle and and just the right thing. I loved the browned and just-this-side of crunchy exterior. I will make this cake and hope mine comes out as well as my hostess' did.

I added a quarter cup of fresh lemon juice and a teaspoon of almond extract and that enhanced the flavor of the cake. Make sure to add about a quarter cup extra flour to balance out the added liquid. Also, instead of the glaze from the recipe, I topped it with a chocolate ganache glaze.

Meh. Nothing really interesting. It was ok.

What a disappointment. What a waste of ingredients. I should have read the reviews in advance. The recipe was made EXACTLY as written. The bundt baked beautifully but as to lemon flavor????? I was also disappointed with the glaze.

Cut the sugar to 1 1/4 c. Added 1 drop of lemon oil. Perfect lemon taste ensued. I agree with reviewer re glaze becoming jelly-like even after reduction. Not sure if I'd make this recipe again.

This was OK but not great - I'll rather consume the butter, sugar and eggs in another form. When reduced to 1/2 cup, the glaze was too thick (basically jelly).

I used the 8 lemons recommended, but maybe didn't quite have the butter soft enough because my cake came out drier than I would have liked. It could be because I needed to adjust the cooking time due to using a convection oven but I took it out before the prescribed time and still it was overcooked. The glaze didn't even soak into the cake. I agree though that there are lots of other lemon recipes that are better and I probably wouldn't make this again.

I agree with the cook from BC Canada -- an *insane* amount of sugar, for both health and taste reasons. I routinely halve the amount of sugar in recipes, but would reduce it even further in this one. Kick the sugar habit folks; it's like salt, the more you add, the more you want and the less you taste other flavors.

To Herbaceous: Yes, you can use an angel food cake pan.

This cake was Yummy and Easy. The outside was perfectly almost crunchy and the inside moist and lemony. The glaze was perfect too...I made apricot..lemony and not to sweet. I will make this again soon!!!

Is a bundt pan necessary to cook a bundt cake? I have an angel food cake pan and glass pans, but no bundt pan.

Why not replace the preserve with lemon curd (from a jar) - after all it is a lemon cake, why not further enhance the bright lemon flavor?

How about using lemon curd instead of the preserves - it is a lemon cake after all.

2 1/2 sugar -- really? That's 20 oz of sugar divided in 10 servings, 4 T per serving. Seems ridiculous if you ask me. It might taste good but there is a limit to how unhealthy I want to cook.

I used zest of 6 meyer lemons. The cake was good, and moist, but not amazing. I thought it needed some ice cream on top, or whipped cream, or something else. It was good (especially on day 2 after the glaze had soaked in), but there are so many wonderful lemon cake recipes out there, I don't think I'll repeat this one. Not remarkable.

Delicious! I almost didn't make it based on that first review but thankfully it did come out "wonderfully moist" and with a crunchy crust as advertised, and sweet but not too sweet with the apricot glaze. The lemon zest smells amazing when mixed with the sugar, which made the baking all the more fun--I used 8 meyer lemons and didn't find that the zesting took very long.

My husband is a huge lemon pund cake fan so I thought I'd check this out. I used seven large lemons and that was just the right amount of zest. The cake was dense and moist and enjoyed thoroughly by my whole family. It was alot of work but had a much more fresh flavor compared to the box-and-pudding bundt cake recipe. I would definitely make it again, may be with some blueberries next time.

Cake was not "wonderfully moist" and was a lot of work. Recipe calls for zest of 8 lemons or 1/2 cup; I zested 3 lemons and it was 3/4 cup, so I stopped there. Flavors were nice though. I might consider making it again if others have better luck.
