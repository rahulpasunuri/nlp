It's a very soft dough and difficult to work with, even with refrigeration. But, SO worth it! These cookies have the most delicate buttery taste, with a light and crispy texture. They just melt in your mouth. My son's teacher last year requested them 3x(!!) for various class parties and activities. She said that all the teachers were fighting over the extras.

these cookies were so good but the chilling is not entirely necessary if you are trying to save time

This is my Granma Cowan's sugar cookie receipe. It is outstanding- I've had this for over 40 yrs-- Use a meat cleaver or a textured bottom of a glass - I use one with bubbles on the bottom. For Christmas- use Red and green sugar mixed with regular sugar to roll and stamp them. Enjoy- they melt in your mouth

THis was an amazing recipe and it was very quick, easy, and very yummy! Instead of putting plain sugar on top of the glass cup bottom, I tried chocolate sprinkles and they tasted good to. Another thing was that I set the oven for 12-13 minutes and the bottoms of the cookies were a light golden brown, just how i like them! but this might not apply to everyone. I loved this and would make it again and again. I thought they were perfect party cookies.

This is the perfect sugar cookie. In reading all of the reviews of those who found them dry or difficult to work with: you must measure the flour exactly, and notice that these are not roll-out, cookie cutter cookies. They are meant to be made exactly as written. Also, the dough must be kept cold, at least 2 hours. These cookies have the perfect taste, and are tender, flakey and soft, provided you don't overbake. Try this recipe, you will love it!

Perhaps my oven, but I found 9 minutes to be great. Over 10 and they were too brown on the bottom.

These are exactly the same as my grandmother made for YEARS..from a recipe from a Swedish friend. We always had a coffee can full of then when we went to visit. Lately they are turning out flat, so I updated my ingredients. Also, watch the humidity. They were never a "roll out" type of cookie; better with milk. Colored sugar is nice on these, also good frosted.

I've had some difficulty with this recipe, too. First time, the dough spread like crazy. Second time, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and the dough was too stiff. Both times, cookies came out crispier than I expected. I'm looking for a chewier cookie. At least, the stiff dough gave me something like a tea biscuit, okay with tea or milk. Maybe the third time will be the charm.

I don't like to make sugar cookies of the cut-out variety so when I found this recipe I was delighted. These make the best sugar cookies and they are easy and don't make a mess! I made them for Christmas and they went over fabulously!

I so wanted to like this recipe, but have to agree with a couple of previous reviewers... Dough was oily and left oil puddles on the cutting board. Didn't roll easily even after over 24 hours in the fridge. Finally got some cookies onto parchment, and they melted everywhere. Had to throw the whole batch out. Yuck.

I followed the advice of another cook to add a bit more flour to this dough...bad idea. The dough was so stiff it was nearly impossible to work with. In the interest of flavor, I added a bit of lime zest and almond extract which rendered the few cookies that turned out beautiful and slightly citrus-y. I would make this again WITHOUT the addition of extra flour.

Ohhh - I can't stop eating these cookies! This has to be one of the best, most easy to make recipes I have ever come across. It's cookies like these that make baking so rewarding. They are light and crisp, yet tender and have wonderfully rich flavor. Be sure not to overcook them and they will melt in your mouth. I'm going to have another one right now...

My first try at sugar cookies, so I don't have anything to compare them too, but they sure were delicious! The edges of the cookies were crisp, whereas the middles were soft and chewy - a great combination! I didn't see a problem with following the recipe as is (oil included), and had no problem with an oily flavor or anything. After chilling overnight the dough was easy to work with, and resulted in some beautiful yummy tasting cookies!

11 YR OLD: these are REALLY good cookies. i used a different recipe last time. i'm sorry i did. i took the advice of the cook from New Brunswick, and used 2 1/2c flour. i also used 1/4c vegetable shortning, and 3/4c (1 1/2 sticks) butter.i added a few drops of mint exstract. it gave the cookies a hint of something between lemon and mint. I liked it. i (on someone else's advice) chilled the dough for 45min. it was fine. instead of dipping a glass in sugar and squishing the cookies with that, i rolled them in brown sugar and flattend them wiht my palm.like i said before, these are REALLY ,REALLY good cookies.

Great cookies! Yumm...awful for doing cutouts though because they go soft really fast.

Would almost give 4 forks. I was amazed that I liked these so much; they might very well replace my "ususal" sugar cookie recipe- their texture is different, very light & almost melt-in-your-mouth. I actually made the dough & froze it, and did the same to my "ususal" recipe then thawed & baked both a couple of weeks later. No problem rolling & cutting. I added just a bit of cardamom powder to both of my recipes which I would do again. I did not ice these, but might next time. They don't look very exciting but they taste great (no prob with oil taste either)!!

Best sugar cookie I've ever made. I used canola oil. There was no "oily" taste mentioned by some others. The texture was wonderful. I put some pecans on them. Even better.

Rating: 4
These taste like a sugar cookie should. I've been looking all over for a good sugar cookie recipe with cream of tartar. I think that's what makes them so good. I doubled the batch and added a half cup more flour than was called for. Also, as others did, I used crisco instead of oil. I just don't like the idea of oil in cookies. I tried to roll out the dough to make cut outs after only chilling the dough in the freezer for 25 minutes. It was a bad idea. The dough was very hard to work with. The dough definitely needs to chill for the allotted time. Next time I will chill over night if I make cut outs. Over all, an excellent recipe!

Rating: 4
I agree whole-heartedly with the cook from New Brunswick - these are exceptional sugar cookies. I took their advice and used a combination of butter and vegetable shortening (butter flavored) and increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups. Perfection.

These are so delicious. I was skeptical at first because the batter wasn't that tasty (and what cookie batter isn't that tasty?), but once they were covered with sugar they were excellent. Mine were a little thin so I baked for 12 minutes and they came out perfect, light and flaky. Yum!

I've been trying and discarding sugar cookie recipes for years - no more! This is the one I have been looking for. Soft but not too soft, sweet but not too sweet, great for cut-outs. I used 3/4 C butter and 1/4 C vegetable shortening in place of the called-for butter and oil. And I increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups. Will ice and decorate for easter today, and will be making these again and again. Finally, a go-to sugar cookie recipe!

These cookies were quite good and very simple to make. I made the dough the night before, chilled overnight then baked the next day on parchment-lined sheets. I pressed them with white sugar and then sprinkled red and silver sanding sugar on top. Makes a good, basic, simple sugar cookie.

I thought these cookies were great. They had a very delicate (light & fluffy) texture. I used my oven's convection feature and ended up cooking them about 17 minutes with three pans in the oven. This is a recipe that I will make over and over again.

I made these on a cold night, right tough to find in Canada. But we were doing Christmas crafts early, and my family has a sweet tooth so I doubled the recipe. I also put a few drops of red food coloring into the sugar, so that they looked more festive. They disappeared before I could keep up. I would suggest under cooking them for a soft cookie at about 10-12 minutes, and super crispy for the whole 15.

This is the sugar cookie recipe I remember from childhood. It got lost when my mother moved out of her home and I've been looking for it since! Yes, chill the dough overnight if you can and it will be a lot easier to work with. Also, it isn't meant to be used with cookie cutters, just smash it down and it's great!

Perfect cookie to do w/ kids. You can make & refrigerate dough. Then afterschool you can have the kids make the dough balls & decorate w/ sprinkles etc. Dipping the balls into the sugar or sprinkles & then mashing works great for kids.

i've used this recipe twice before. the first time, i followed the recipe, but the second time, i made a little mistake and put in 1 1/2 cups of flour instead of 2 1/2. it wasn't until the recipe was way underway that i realized this--but they turned out great! they were harder to put on the pan--much stickier, so i had to sprinkle the sugar on top instead of smooshing the sugar in--but it was worth it because they turned out chewy, buttery, and good!

I made these for my nephews for Father's Day. They were delicious. I changed the butter/vegetable oil requirements based on previous recommendations. I put in 3/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of vegetable shortening instead of oil. They came out great and didn't have that oil aftertaste.

Followed the recipe exactly except dipped the glass into sanding sugar instead of regular granulated. The cookies came out nice and crisp, with beautiful "glittery" tops. Chilled for exactly half an hour while the oven preheated, and they scooped out and rolled into balls just fine. Next time will make a double batch and freeze them!

Rating: 3
You really need to keep the dough well-chilled, and should prob. work in small batches if you are using cookie cutters. It does become "oily" if you let it get to room temp. Also have a spatula on hand to lift the unbaked cookies from your work surface - the dough will absorb lots of flour if you overdust while rolling.

Rating: 2
This recipie is easy and quick, but the taste is also a little flat. Although the texture is sandy and crisp, the taste of the vegetable oil comes through spoiling the pure flavor of the cookie. Next time I might add either more vanilla or some citrus extract to combat this unfortunate problem. And I will try it again, because it is just the easy and simple.

Well, this was fantastic!! We could not stop at just three each...we just kept on eating. My kids wanted M&M cookies so I used this recipe and added one cup of M&Ms. Dropped dough the size of small golf balls onto cookie sheet without pressing down. Baked for about 12 min. and out came heaven on earth. Moist and divine!

By far and away, the best sugar cookies I've ever tasted. I believe the powdered sugar adds to the "melt-in-your-mouth" texture. I make these every year for the holidays and always end up sending the recipe to others. Use parchment paper on your cookie sheets and they are very easy to remove and keep whole.

These cookies were great. Easy to put together from start to finish. I added 1/2 cup sprinkles to the dough when the dry ingredients were partially incorporated to make them more fun, especially for kids. They had a "confetti" look to them. To comment on all the other reviews: don't add more flour to combat stickiness, just chill longer. Have patience! The dough set up fine in the freezer for 45 minutes. It wasn't sticky at all. Too much flour will yield a tough cookie. Perhaps it doesn't roll well because it's meant to be scooped into balls and then flattened, not rolled out. If you find the taste lacking, then add different extracts and experiment. The texture was crisp and crunchy. Great for a sugar cookie.

Rating: 3
Fabulous recipe. These make wonderful cookies. I will definitely make these again. I found that the dough was so sticky, I didn't cool them for the alloted time, that I did not need to dip them in water before the sugar. I used large multi-colored sugar from Dean and Deluca and they were wonderful.

My husband hates that I rated this poorly before, so I am here to set the record straight. Yes, they are a little grainy and greasy, but for some inexplicable reason, he loves them. And our friends love them and always ask for the recipe. Maybe it's me. I do like them, I just don't sneak them in the middle of the night. (For the record, I'm mad about the dough). I add a cup of dried cranberries and 1/2 tsp of cardamom, which I think makes them quite unique, tasty, and suitable for holiday occasions. It's definitely worth a try.

Great and easy. Wow, they were so easy that we made them two nights in a row and the second, my 10-year old son finished them by making the balls and rolling them in sugar before cooking them. He forgot to smash them down a bit but we liked them better, they were a little moister and much yummier than those that were thinner and cooked more thouroughly. Highly recommend it and will be distributing this recipe as I was asked for it by several.
