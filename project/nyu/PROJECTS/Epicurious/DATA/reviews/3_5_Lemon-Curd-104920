This is a great recipe made many times before. But today it didn't turn out like curd. I've always used a wooden spoon and should have heeded another reviewer's advice. A whisk just broke it up and the butter separated out. Hopefully I will be able to recover it by mixing with whipping cream. I also substituted 1/2 the sugar with Splenda as I have 2 diabetics at the dinner table. So, some of the food science might not have worked in my favour. However, the flavour is still fantastic.

I will never serve jarred lemon curd again - this was outstanding! As others suggested I added an extra egg yolk and strained it for a silky -smooth texture. I was also vigilant with whisking it throughout the cooking. Just wonderful and it all disappeared at the Tea Party!

Epicurious saved me on this one. I made a curd using another recipe which was not specific about the thickness of the curd when it is done. I reheated my thinner curd and had good results. My recipe calls for 3 eggs, 1/2 C lemon juice, the zest and only 1/4 C of butter ( half a stick) cut up in cubes. It takes patience to get the curd thick enough but it will get there.

I made this as a filling to the Lemon Meringue Ice Cream Pie with Toasted Pecan Crust. I used about half of the recipe for the pie, and was very glad to have leftovers for scones. I did cook the curd in a double boiler - it was nice and smooth, and cooked very evenly.

I can't believe I've never made lemon curd before. This recipe turned out great. I don't really understand the part about using a whisk the whole time--seems like it breaks up what you want to keep together. I switched to a wooden spoon (with the little corner edge to get the edge of the pan) and stirred up like I would ice cream custard. Thickened perfectly.

SO easy. Definitely strain it to get out small pieces of egg, then stir in a little fresh zest to the strained curd.

this is amazing! i use it all the time - it's easy, fast, and delicious! one tip: you can cook it over high heat, it's much faster than what the recipe says, but doesn't change the final product at all. all in all, a fabulous recipe! :)

This recipe was so easy to make and so delicious! I cooked it over medium heat and had no problem with it thickening. I left the zest in but would strain it out next time as I think it interferes with the silky texture of the curd.

It's not setting up! How frustrating. I followed the recipe to a tee but it didn't thicken enough once it started to simmer. Maybe I should have cooked it even longer (12 minutes), maybe I should have cooked it over a higher heat (it said moderately low). I'm used to a recipe in which yolks and whole eggs are used with more juice and less sugar. Then the butter is whisked in tbs by tbs off of the heat after the ingredients come to a simmer. That usually produces a nice, thick curd. This recipe is much lighter and a bit soupy. I'm just hoping it's thick enough to support the blueberries for my tart!!

Super Easy until you realize you are whisking away and it is not thickening...because you forgot the eggs! Talking on the phone and cooking not good. I whisked the eggs in another bowl and tempered them with about a half cup of the lemon mixture, poured everything together and THEN I had curd. I used Meyer lemons and it took 5 of them for this recipe. The smell is amazing and the taste even better!

Delicious, if a little rich (and that's using the right amount of butter 1 3/4 sticks, not cups). I thought it was taking a long time to thicken over low heat so I turned it up to medium and it thickened beautifully. Not going to strain it because it sounds like a messy job and I like the bits of lemon zest.

I didn't rate this. If I had rated it the first time I made it, I'd have given it 4 forks. The 2nd and 3rd times, it wouldn't thicken. I never got the whisk marks in the curd. I threw away batch #2. Batch #3 is cooling. I hope it will thicken but have my doubts.

Didn't have enough lemons on hand, so halved the recipe. Excellent results without sieving. Time to cook was right on. As a curd snob, this will be my go to recipe because the results are good and it is EASY!

This was SUPER easy, and a great way to use up some eggs I had that were at risk of going bad. This is the perfect balance of tanginess and rich buttery flavor.

I made this almost exactly as written. The only change being that I used 5 eggs, because I had "home grown" eggs that are a bit small. This lemon curd is the easiest I've ever made. And the flavor is incredible. My English friend says it's as good as her mum's. I'm going to try this again using other citrus (I'm thinking blood orange and lemon?). Fantastic!

Decided to try my hand at lemon curd after being ridiculed by my British friends for buying it. This recipe was easy and worked out perfectly--even down to the 10 minute time suggestion. I will never used purchased lemon curd again! I did not strain it but left the zest in that was produced with a microplane zester--very fine and adds some appreciated texture and zip. The only down side was seeing HOW MUCH butter goes into the recipe. I will be enjoying it sparingly on toast and scones, but enjoying it all the same.

I have a meyer lemon tree in my yard so I make lemon curd quite a bit. This recipe is easier than some I've made and makes a great curd with a good color and very nice consistency. I doubled it with no problem at all and will use the curd as a filling in the Fresh Coconut Layer Cake, also found on this site. Will definitely make this again.

Very easy, tart and zippy...just what I look for in a lemon curd. I actually reduced the sugar by 1/3 cup. This recipe could never be bitter unless you don't zest the lemon properly. (NEVER include any of the white part!)

This recipe yielded the worst lemon curd I have ever had. With this amount of actual fresh lemon juice and zest, the curd was bitter beyond the wonderful lemon flavor we all make this for. Also, the directions did not work for me, I heated this curd for 20 minutes at the directed level of heat and did not achieve wisk tracks in the curd. There are better recipes out there.

MMmmmm! Yeah! Why didn't I know about this earlier in life???? This recipe was so easy and yielded almost 4 cups of yellowy goodness. I'll never, never buy it again! Soooo Good!!!!!

This curd is fabulous and could become the central ingredient of many deserts and sweets. A good balance between tart and sweet. No fussing with cornstarch, no water to thin out the flavor, just yumminess through and through. It's straightforward to make also, once the lemons are squeezed. I used lemons picked fresh from our tree which must have helped the vibrant flavor. However, I think it would be stunning anyway.

Gourmet's Lemon Curd recipe produces distilled sunshine! I do not strain out the lemon zest, myself. I prefer the result with the zest and not straining eliminates one moderately messy step.

I have made this lemon curd many many times after finding it here and it's wonderful every time. It's also great when turned into mousse by adding a little whipped cream.

OK, so I tried it, and it's a really good thing I was alone in my house when I did, because I would've been embarassed if someone had come in to see me "cleaning" the saucepan with a spoon!! It was SOOO good... tasted restaurant quality, and really easy. I made the whole thing while watching TV. I plan on serving it with whipped cream, raspberries, and the lemon-olive oil cake from this site for a late mother's day when my mom comes up this weekend.

Has anyone ever made this or thought about making it keeping the zest in? It just seems like it would be interesting, and people seem to have had problems with getting it through a strainer.

I have made this many times and never found it too buttery. Note: the recipe states 1 3/4 sticks, NOT CUPS of butter. Excellent lemon tang from the zest used in the curd. A little of a pain to strain all the pieces out, but worth it.

What a terrific and easy lemon curd! Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out brilliantly. The only problem I had was in the end step the curd was too thick to go through my strainer so I ended up using cheese cloth, but then some of the curd leaked through. A few pieces of lemon rind snuck through, but that's no crisis. I used the curd to make lemon mousse (folded it into freshly whipped cream ) and it was awesome.

This recipe doesn't call for 1 and 3/4 cups butter, as the reviewer from oakland says. It calls for 1 and 3/4 sticks. That's a little less than 1 cup. I've made this one, and I think it is fine.

Rating: 1
Too much butter as one of the earlier reviewers noted! I had to skim off at least a quarter cup of liquified butter...Other recipes call from 1/4 cup to 1 cup, this is 1 3/4 cup!YIKES.

I am on spring break last week and this week from my cooking class from B.O.C.E.S. I've made repice in class and twice at home. It's a winner. It's my favorite desert. In fact, I like to have it when I'm watching ABC's reality show "The Bachelor."

um...i've made lemon curd many times (i'm a pastry chef) and tried this recipe because of all the rave reviews. this was the worst experience i've ever had with a curd, but i think that's because i doubled it. but besides that, it was waaaay too buttery. i won't try this one again.

I completely agree with the reviewers below--I've made a lot of lemon curd, and this was one of the easiest recipes I've seen. Delicious in tart shells topped with mint, whipped cream, or even a blueberry.

I used this recipe to make lemon pancakes. I followed my usual recipe for buttermilk pancakes and spread them with lemon curd immediately after removing them from the griddle. I then sprinkled the pancakes with powdered sugar and topped with a lemon peel curl. Outstanding!

Lemon curd is one of my favorite comfort foods. I could eat the stuff with a spoon. and more often than not, I end up making a double recipe. One recipe for a cake filling, and then one to fill me.
