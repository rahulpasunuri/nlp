I have made this recipe twice, without modification, and served it with roasted potatoes. It is a pretty presentation, tastes good and keeps well for leftovers the next day.

The steak was okay. The salad was a total flavor-bomb!

great idea! i added chopped pickles to the salad, since i love a good dill note in a bloody mary. i added some wetness to the marinade with a bit of worcestershire and hot sauce. i served this with honey glazed cornbread.

Excellent! The rub is really nice; made with chicken instead of beef.

First time cooking flank steak and as other reviewers pointed out (a) dry rub made too little and (b) a wet marinade would be better to keep the meat tender. The tomato salad is a keeper and went really well with the meat. Its flavor is bold and really made the celery shine- usually celery is hum hum for me but it popped in this recipe. A few changes to the salad, I used a mixed black/green mediterranean olive blend which cut the brinyness down and added a 1/4 cup tomato juice to the dressing. Made everything the morning of and then threw the meat on the grill for no more than 10mins total. Served with Corn and onion grits and lettuce salad. Delish, easy and I would definitely would make this again.

Leftover salad is terrific w/ the addition of a can of drained black beans & avocado. I used one 1.5# flank steak but still doubled the rub. Leftovers make outrageously delicious sandwiches (use ciabatta) that are exceeeeeedingly picnic worthy!

this is great! the rub is fantastic. I cooked the steaks in a cast iron, and they came out perfect. Salad is assertive, but delicious. I added some avocado because I had it at hand. I will make this again and again.

Awesome recipe. the steak was amazing, even though I cooked it on the stove. The salad is sharp, but delicious. I added avocado to it (because I needed to use it) and it mellowed it a bit. I halved the recipe. Very easy too.

I made this the other night and it was delicious. Even hubby who doesn't particularly like tomatos enjoyed it I don't know if the rub added anything special to it, though. I will make again and I think it would be really good with shrimp instead of steak - a bloody mary shrimp cocktail.

This was absolutely wonderful. A real change of pace in terms of flavor--calling it a "bloody mary" salad actually doesn't quite do it justice, since it is much more balanced than dumping some overly strong bloody mary flavors on your steak would be. We live in an apt, no outdoor grill, so we broiled the steak. It took much longer than 5-7 mins per side to cook, but maybe our broiler is not as hot as a real grill. We had to stop in the middle and rub some oil on the steak to help it along. I'm sure this would be even better on a real grill, to provide true char.

OMG this salad is soooo good. I ate a triple serving of the salad. Very unusual. Not something I'd want every single day, but very yummy and different. The steak was nice too - the sweetness of the rub was a nice complement.

Loved this recipe. Intended to cook it the day I made it, but couldn't do that. I think it was better for sitting an extra day. Also...........we used the leftovers for sandwiches.........which were terrific. Sort of like a mufaletta sandwich. Just use good Italian bread with a great crust.

The flank steak was good and everyone enjoyed it although I prefer using a marinade vs this dry rub. The salad was a real hit and will make it again. Overall was a winner with our family.

This was excellent. I made it using cut up heirloom tomatoes because it seems a shame to have cherry toms at this time of year, but otherwise followed the recipe. Agree that the spice rub was skimpy, though i liked it  might double. The tomato salad, on the other hand, made waaay too much, but we solved that problem by blending it with vodka and ice the next day and making ACTUAL frozen bloody marys!

I thought the brown sugar in the rub complemented the tartness of the salad beautifully. I did substitute smoked Spanish paprika for "generic". My only negative about the rub was the quantity. Generally rub recipes make a wild excess. This was barely enough to coat one steak - luckily I was cooking only one and made a full batch of rub.

Loved the salad and have already made it numerous times. Used red wine vinegar because I could not fine the sherry vinegar. The steak rub was just okay. I have a better one that I will use in the future.

i followed the advice of others and didn't bother with the brown sugar for the steak, instead just doing a salt/pepper/cayenne/paprika rub. I did make the tomato salad and stuck the recipe completely, except for using cider vinegar instead of sherry. The salad was...good....but the flavor becomes slightly weird after the first few bites. I also thought the celery hearts were a bit bitter and it would have been better to use 'regular' celery. That said, next time I feel like a bloody mary, I will probably just make a bloody mary.

I made this steak tonight using a top round instead of a flank steak and slow cooked the steak over a cooler grill for nearly an hour in order to make the beef nice and tender. Really fantastic. I, personally, would add a bit more horseradish and tabasco sauce to make it more like a bloody mary, but that's just me. I'll definitely be making this again.

This is a great summer recipe. I'll be making it again. The ingredients are always available,it goes together quickly and it truly tastes like a bloody mary and is just as refreshing. I can't wait to try it with heirloom tomatoes from my garden.

The tomato salad was delicious, I made the recipe as recomended. I did find the rub to be lacking as stated by a few other people. The brown sugar was odd and smoked paprika might have been nicer. I did serve the tomatoes (and dressing) piled on top of the steak. So even after all the flavors mingled, the sugar was still very apparent. I will use my own rub next time. Salad was awesome.

I also doubled the rub on this. I served it with the iceberg lettuce wedge with blue cheese dressing from this website, and it was a heavenly summer dinner. I am planning to make it again this weekend for guests. Mmmmmm.

I doubled the rub and used one flank steak (about 1.5 lbs.). The rub is great -- a nice change from our usual soy sauce/rosemary/garlic marinade. I halved the amount of tomatoes but kept everything else the same and it still made LOTS of salad, which had great flavor, great crunch and added a fresh, healthful component. Served w/ good bread and broccolini and dinner was done!

Easy to make ahead and great flavors when you put all the bits of the salad w/ the steak! My younger kids even ate it.

This recipe gets 4 stars (or more) for the tomato salad part. It was fantastic, literally tastes just like a bloody mary made right! Left out the olives since no one was a fan and substituted the celery seeds w/ Old Bay. Made the salad 2-3 hrs ahead of time and wow, the flavor was just incredible. I'd love to try this on lamb too. The steak part on the other hand...a simple kosher salt and peppercorn dusting would have been just fine. I used 4 12oz NY strip steaks and doubled the spice rub. Unimpressive. In fact, I think the brown sugar made the steak get overly charred on the outside. And with such strong flavors in the tomato salad, the spice rub got lost anyways... P.S. I understand this goes against what grilling gurus say, but I am a regular charcoal grill user...and I say, forget about the vegetable oil brushing (unnecessary) -- also, if you want your meat RARE like we do...don't worry about letting it sit out to room temperature. This is only if you want even cooking throughout (medium to well, and if you like your steak that done...don't waste your money on a nice cut) ;)

Used white balsamic vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, but other than that, kept to the recipe. The dressing was so good that next time I'm going to try marinating the steak in some extra before the rub & grill. Great recipe!

This is good!! Made exactly as written, no changes, no substitutions. Served with white rice, with chopped green onion, spinach, cilantro, parsley and butter stirred in. And avocado slices. Very nice summer dinner on the deck.
