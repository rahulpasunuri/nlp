Ok, I cheated - a lot! Used bagged tortilla chips and jarred salsa verde, but the dish was still terrific. I was looking for a way to mask the icky taste and texture of my free-range Thanksgiving turkey. While I wouldn't necessarily categorize this version of the dish as authentic or even fancy, it was so delicious and comforting. Turned a bad Thanksgiving main course into fabulous leftovers.

I reviewed this last Thanksgiving, and I have made this a few times since. The one thing I can recommend is that, unless your turkey meat is not very tasty, or you are using chicken that isn't from a roast, you don't have to cook it in the onions and broth. I just cook the onions after frying the tortillas, omit the broth, mix everything else together and bake. It's delicious and much easier.

No need to fry - lay out tortillas on cookie sheet and spray with Pam. BAKE at 425 for about 7-10 minutes on each side. When you flip, spray again with pam. Buy premade roasted tomatillo salsa at the store - I like Arriba! brand. It comes in a 16 oz. bottle which is the perfect amount. I use chicken instead. Boil 2 breasts in water about 10 minutes. Cool. Chop or shred. I also use whatever cheese I have on hand - usually cheddar. I skip the creme fraiche, milk and queso fresco. Finally - and I believe this is key - I layer it like a lasagna and let it all soak overnight and then cook it the next day. Add the cheese at the end on top to brown. I don't mix it in.

Unbelievable way to use leftover turkey. I added avacado to this, served it up with some black beans. Made excellent leftovers too. I baked my tortillas to keep it on the healthy side.

My son loved this and was so disappointed that it got eaten up so quickly. We used leftover Thanksgiving turkey and then a jar of regular tomato salsa (it's what i had on hand). It was very fast and easy and delicious. This will go into my regular rotation (probably with chicken).

What a great way to use leftover turkey! My family loved this dish. LIke other reviewers, I have given up making tomatillo salsa from scratch, since the ready-made is just as good. (I like Frontera Grill's.) I also baked the tortilla strips instead of frying them. They turned out really crispy and stayed that way. I think the fried version would have made the dish too heavy for our taste.

I substituted grilled chicken breast halves (marinated in lime juice & olive oil) and thought this was a fantastic dish! Very flavorful!

Yep, that the cook from Bezerkely wasn't even aware of where chilaquiles originate is telling in and of itself. That my Mexican in-laws demanded the recipe for this dish and request it when they visit on Thanksgivings is much more illustrative, I think. I would even say it's hard to call it "unauthentic" given where food is going in contemporary restaurants in Mexico, but untraditional may be apt. Great recipe!

To the cook from Berkely: I'm from a Country in Central America. Chilaquiles are Mexican, not from C.A. C American countries don't have this dish, but in Mexican restaurants.

After a hockey-watching party I had partial bags of tortilla chips left over and searched for tortilla recipes and this one came up. A big hit!. I use commercial bagged tortillas flavoured with "A hint of lime" and as we speak, I'm making a salsa based on eggplant and red bell pepper puree to use in today's version. I'm also going to barbecue skinless chicken legs and strip the meat.

Loved it! Big hit in our household!

I cheated and used tortilla chips and La Costena's Tomatillo salsa. We all enjoyed these chilaquiles very much, even left over. The milk added to the sour cream makes it a little reminiscent of Mexican Crema which is what an authentic Mexican restaurant near uses. I omitted the cilantro because I didn't have it and put chopped Bryan tomatoes on instead.

I have made this dish for friends and family a number of times (with chicken) and it's always a HUGE hit. It comes out perfect every time. I can't understand why previous reviewers didn't like it. I've had chilaquiles in Mexico and at well regarded Mexican restaurants in Los Angeles and this recipe is every bit as good, if not better.

A hint to make the chilaquiles even better..and no, these aren't authentic, but who cares?? A lot of people can't get the ingredients to make the real thing. Let the tortillas get good and dry before you fry them, that's the key. Otherwise, they will never be truly crunchy. The moisture left in the tortillas prevents that crisp texture you find in toritlla chips. You can either dry them in a very slow oven or leave them in the sun on a patio, or wait a couple of days at room temperature. An excellent green sauce is made by Herdez, I used to make it from scratch, but theirs is superb, so why bother? Add some serrano chiles (at least one!) to the salsa and definitely throw in a couple of minced garlic cloves and you'll be much closer to the original.

I made this reipe for a family gathering and even the finicky eaters enjoyed it. I didn't find the recipe particularly time-consuming or difficult, especially since I only had to use one dish! The tomatillo sauce was not hard to make - well worth doing yourself. For easy chicken, cook some frozen chicken breasts overnight in a crockpot on low.

I have made this dish for several pot lucks and the dish always comes home empty. Not sure what problems the earlier reviewers had -- possibly a dislike of tomatillos? I loved it.

i didn't make this dish but -- to the cook from berkeley: chilaquiles is in fact an authenthic mexican dish. it's a way of using leftover tortillas. the chilaquiles recipes on this website are a bit lacking in authenticity, yes, but the idea behind them isn't.

Very tasty and not too time-consuming. As to the chef from Berkeley's scathing remarks: If you are so worldly and better-knowing than the rest of us regarding latin american cuisine, why did you make the recipe???

This totally rocks. I made it with chicken and no blender! It was a lot more involved than I thought, but well worth it.

I agree--a second hideous attempt at chilequiles from this site. The real dish, btw, is well worth eating--order it in a Oaxacan restaurant to try it. This was just plain bad, and nothing like the real thing.

I cannot believe how bad this recipe was. We were really disappointed in this time-consuming and hideous dish. How such an unimaginative, 50's style casserole could have made it into this recipe database is worthy of lengthy debate. I have travelled extensively in Central America and there is nothing authentic or reminiscent about this dish. Try again!

I baked the corn tortillas instead of frying and used a canned green salsa with good results. This is really quite authentic. Worth making - good mexican comfort food.

Excellent recipe, and my family are not Mexican food fans. Couldn't find tomatillos, so used roma tomatoes instead and it was a hit!

This is a great recipe! It works well with chicken, as well--I just bought one of the supermarket rotisserie ones and shredded it, and it came out beautifully. Definitely a recipe to make over and over again--even if you don't have turkey leftovers!

DELICIOUS! I will make this again and again. I did use store bought tomatillo salsa and rather than fry the tortillas, I tossed them with oil and baked until crispy. What a great way to enjoy my turkey leftovers, everyone LOVED it!
