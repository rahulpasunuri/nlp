Tasted like rice. Either I used way too little mint or it was a waste of the mint I did use. If I make it again (probably won't), I'll dress it up a lot.

bland and very disappointing. made it for friends and was embarrassed to be serving it.

I would make this recipe again, but add more mint, garlic, onion and maybe some cumin because it seemed a bit bland. My mistake was that I browned the rice too long so when I cooked it in water it was a bit overcooked. I made with the Chicken Mole with Chipotle Peppers and it was a really nice compliment to the spicy, rich mole sauce.

even after reading the other reviews, i was tempted to make this. a few tweaks, and this turned out great! here's what you do: use as much garlic as you are comfortable with (i used about 7 cloves), half an onion, a handful of mint (i used dried), and salt to taste. put it all in the food processor with the hot water. add it all to the browned rice, and cook for 20 minutes as directed. the taste is truly unique and delicious. if you are so inclined, a wonderful compliment to grilled lamb.

Horrible. I made it for guests tonight and was horribly embarrassed. It was bland, and what flavor it did have was disgusting.

very easy,and a great side dish with spicy beans or meat. I also tried it adding dill and 1/2 cup chopped plum tomato.very good variation with skewered meat or seafood

It's funny. In reading the recipe, I miss the part where the point of the recipe is that the rice "is_not_yellow." (I do however see the part where is calls for mint.)

this was easy and excellent. great with enchiladas and a little tomato paste, or something to make it pink like traditional mexican rice. i skipped the mint.

Wonderful. I make it in my rice cooker, adding the pureed watery stuff and water up to the line when I add the rice. I actually omit the mint, since personally I dislike it, but the result is flavorful, aromatic rice that still fools the eye and looks like plain white rice. I absolutely disagree with the previous reviewer's suggestion to add tumeric--the whole point of this rice is that it's _not_ yellow.

This is a nice change from plain rice, especially if mint grows in your garden. I used well-washed basmati rice with 1 3/4 cup water for each cup of rice. At the end of cooking time, I added a lump of butter, and more salt because initially I used less than specified. I opted to chop the mint (rather than leaving the leaves whole) and stirred it in just before serving. Oh yes, at the beginning I threw in a generous pinch of turmeric to color the rice a pretty yellow. The same effect could be had by using annatto seed oil in the first step.
