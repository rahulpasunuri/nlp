I will make just about anything with fresh ginger in it. I've made it twice, as the recipe reads, and I wouldn't change a thing. I used it first on a carrot cake, and then on carrot cake cupcakes. My friend's husband at three in a row, and all the leftover frosting. Enough said.

Mmmm! I cut back the sugar to 2 cups and upped the fresh ginger by maybe a teaspoon. Light but rich consistency, just sweet enough, and buoyed by the subtle aromatic flavor of the ginger mixed with the tang of the cream cheese. As others have written, it's much more than is needed for a dozen carrot cupcakes; probably half the icing remained when had finished.

This is one of my favorite icing recipes I have made. I put it once on devil's food cupcakes and once on green tea cupcakes (inspired by Japan during the Cherry Blossom Festival). You can vary the amount of ginger depending on what you are paring it with. I don't like super heavy frosting where all I can taste is the butter and the feel of my mid section expanding. This frosting it absolutely amazing and it not heavy.

Aloha! Read the ingredients list and could only assume that the 3 oz portions of cream cheese must have been a typo if 3 cups of powdered sugar were to be combined.So, I used 2x the 8oz. bricks of cream cheese. I also used a bit more ginger and julienned crystallized ginger for a garnish. Definitely on the sweet side but yummy! Had such a great response from all who shared in the end product. Definitely added to my recipe box!

I thought the icing was a bit too buttery. I would make this again because I love ginger, but would use more cream cheese, less butter. I made this for the Carrot Cake with Maple Cream Cheese recipe; the carrot cake was out of this world.

I thought this icing was great and perfect for the carrot cupcakes. At first the icing was a bit too sweet, buy I added a little extra ginger and that brought out the sour cream cheese flavor.

I also doubled the ginger, added some vanilla and orange zest. Overall it had a really nice flavor, but is a tad on the runny side. It was more than enough to ice 20 cupcakes.

I give this recipe 4 forks with these modifications...I used an 8oz package of cream cheese, 1/2 stick of butter, 2 cups of powdered sugar and doubled the ginger. I also added about a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and a teaspoon of grated orange zest and this was honestly the most amazing icing EVER!!

I used the proportions from the Carrot Cake with Maple-Cream Cheese Frosting and used half Neuchatel and half regular cream cheese. As suggested by another reviewer I added a teaspoon of vanilla. This frosting is really tasty!

Made this as directed and was not impressed. It just didn't have the gingery flavor I was looking for. So, I took it back to my mixer, added a tsp of vanilla, minced up 1/3 cup of crystalized ginger, a couple Tbls of buttermilk and 1 Tbls of cinnamon. These changes made it really tasty. Next time, I'll sprinkle the minced crystalized ginger on the outside, instead of mixing it in.

I used 2- 8oz. pkgs. of cream cheese, the suggested amount of butter and about a cup of sugar. I doubled the ginger and also added grated orange peel and some cinnamon. The result was a delicious, spicy icing (just the right amount of sweetness) that was fabulous on carrot cake. I topped it with grated dark chocolate and a little more grated orange peel. My guests (age 9 and up) gave it rave reviews!

I used this icing for some pumpkin cupcakes I made. I used lower fat cream cheese and double the amount of ginger. I added a bit of molasses at the end and I think it really gave it a great flavor.

i added quite a bit of orange zest and it came out with a nice complicated flavor.

I found the icing to be a bit sweet for my taste but my family loved it. Other than that it topped off my carrot cake perfectly.

I think this frosting is delicious. It does make more than the carrot cupcake recipe calls for though, unless you like really think icing.

I found the consistency to be way too runny. Maybe okay for a fruit dip, but not for icing.

Very good. I expected more ginger flavor- it was barely present. Maybe add more, or accent with chopped crystalized ginger as previously suggested. Very good with carrot cake.

Yum! I use this recipe with the carrot cake from the Carrot Cake with Maple Icing recipe on this site. I usually add an extra tablespoon of ginger to counteract the sweetness. When the cake is iced, I sprinkle minced crystallized ginger on top. Very tasty.

Made this for a spread on a carrot bread as well a pound-cake at a party a little while ago, it was a smashing success. In fact, some decided to skip the bread and just eat this. I doubled the recipe with everything except the confectioners' sugar, tasted just fine.

This icing is delicious! I used it on a spice cake and added 3t. ginger + 4 T. chopped crystallized ginger. Also good as the "sandwich filling" in between gingersnaps.

Great icing recipe. To give it a little more flavor, I added a pinch of salt and a little orange zest. I will definitely use this one again the next time I make a carrot cake.

Love the addition of the ginger. I used only a 1/4 stick of butter-worked well. Served w/ the accompanying carrot cupcake recipe.

This makes a wonderful icing. It's quite sweet and I dare to say that you can half the amount of icing sugar. I also learned the hard way about using whipped cream cheese - it won't work. Use the regular store bought brick.

This icing has a perfect consistancy. I used it to ice the Carrot Orange Cake. The two together create a truly mouth watering carrot cake.

Used this (1-1/2 batches) on the triple layer carrot cake! Yummy!
