delicious and easy! made it and canned it as Christmas presents. Used seedless raspberry spreadable fruit jam and didn't need to strain it. Also used raspberry Schnapps instead of the cassis and used the larger amount. wonderful taste, especially with the organic dark chocolate chips from Whole Foods bulk section for the bittersweet chocolate.

I didn't have Cassis, so I didn't use anything. I also substituted seedless strawberry jam, and topped it with fresh strawberries. Everyone loved it!

I used Chambord rather than the cassis...terrific. Also, try to use seedless jam. The sauce was excellent served at room temperature with plain cheesecake (garnish with fresh raspberries).

Wonderful velvety texture and complex flavors and ever so simple to make. An unbeatable combo! I have used it over poached pears and almond ice cream for an elegant dessert.
