Briught these to my bridge club christmas party-great reviews. I made the mini version in mini muffin tins,but following advice from others Iadded an egg and they still crumbled. Because of that they were awkward to serve on a buffet table.Any suggestions

P.S. Forgot to say that I made these a bit smaller and the recipe made 20 cakes...enough to serve 6 people 3 each with 2 left over for the cook to sample :-)

I took these to our gourmet dinner group last night and they were a huge hit. My husband said he likes them even better than my famous crab cakes. I did add 1 beaten egg to make it easier to keep the mixture together and used Panko breadcrumbs as I think they're much lighter than regular crumbs. Also, used the baking method at 400 for 18 minutes, turning 1/2 way. Served with a Cajun style remoulade sauce...1/2 stalk celery, chopped fine, 1 green onion chopped fine (include the green), 1/4 c chopped Italian parsley, 3/4 c mayo, 1 T Dijon mustard and 1 T creole type mustard, 2 T ketchup, 2 T horseradish, 2 tsp smoky paprika, couple dashes of tobasco and worstershire, 1/4 tsp cayenne. Puree in food processor or blender. You can use this on crab cakes and it makes a killer spread on a sandwich. We'll be making these often...just fabulous flavors.

Gave it 3 instead of 4 because I modified as per other reviewers, but very good. Used raw shrimp, added one egg, and baked at 400 for 18 minutes. I used Panko for the better crust, although it was a bit hard to tell when they were done, because they didn't brown well. Served over sauteed bitter greens and with remoulade for a summer dinner. Delicious!

Yes, this is tasty, but there are some major changes that I made. First, there is a misprint. The recipe serves 6, but it says to form 8 cakes. Secondly, I agree to add an egg to help bind the cakes. However, it says to cook in butter over med-lo heat to brown. Nothing browns on med-lo heat. I used vegetable oil and cooked them over med-hi heat and they browned and crusted much better.

The combination of the shrimp and andouille was great. I made these as mini appetizers and served with a remoulade sauce. I will make again but this time add an egg so that they stay together. Like the comment about the mini tart pan - may try that next time.

I have cooked this multiple times. Always great. Get steamed pealed shrimp, pre-cooked andouille sausage and it is a snap. Everyone has loved it.

So easy to prepare, so different, so economical, and so tasty. These were indeed exceptional. I baked them at 400 for 18 min or so and used raw shrimp. This method reduces fat and does not require tending. One third recipe made 4 shrimp cakes about 3 1/2 inches in diameter and half an inch thick. This is a great do ahead. Bake them while you are eating the first course. Shrimp cakes will be a repeat at our house.

Press into sprayed mini-muffin cups, bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. Remove from pan with the handle of a fork. Serve as an appetizer with aoli made with mayo, lime, mustard and seafood or asian (etc) spice mix.

Subsituted cooked fresh chorizo sausage, red bell pepper, and added 2 roasted jalapeno peppers. Formed with a 1 1/2" cookie scoop to make 70 appetizers. Served with a Jalapeno dip. Got rave reviews at a party and everyone wanted the recipe.

The best and easiest recipe for something that tastes restaurant quality. Didn't have andouille so I used proscuitto and pepperoni. Added an egg and baked. Freakin' unbelievable. Highly, highly reccommend

I like the idea of this recipe and the flavor is great but mine also fell apart. I will make them again with the addition of an egg.

I make these with RAW shrimp or scallops. They are fabulous and bind well with only 3/4 of the mayo called for in the recipe. I have also baked them with equally good results, thus less fat. Bake at 400 for 10 minutes per side. These get RAVE reviews every time I make them.

This recipe was really easy and delicious. I used turkey andouille and low-fat mayo for a more healthy meal, and it was great. My cakes held together fine - I used panko breadcrumbs. They freeze and re-heat well too... I'm going to make a double-batch next time.

Tasted OK but the cakes would not hol together. Need a couple beaten eggs.

These were a great alternative to crab cakes! I wasnt crazy about the spicy andouille sausage and thought using smoked meat was overpowering for the shrimp but will try a milder one next time that isnt smoked. Didnt need extra binding-the mayo worked just fine. Even tho I live on the coast, I am a believer in time-savers-used frozen peeled shrimp and they worked great. (cheaper, too). These were a hit on New Year's Eve.

These are outstanding! I used turkey kielbasa in place of the andouille sausage. I did not decrease the breadcrumbs or add egg--there was plenty of mayo to bind. I may reduce the mayo next time. I made a caynne aioli to go with: 2/3 c. mayo, 3/4 tsp. lemon juice, 1 pressed garlic clove, 1/2 tsp. cayenne and 1/4 tsp. dijon mustard. Combine in a small bowl with a whisk and refrigerate.

I made these cakes as an appetizer course last night for friends. We loved them! I used less bread crumbs but added an egg, and they held together perfectly. I served them with a roasted red pepper aioli, and my guests (and my husband) raved. Will certainly make these again!

As far as flavor goes, this recipe is magnificent! I used panko breadcrumbs and scallops instead of shrimp, and I would HIGHLY recommend adding an egg to the mixture to keep the cakes together. Mine crumbled a bit, but they tasted great! I also used a lemon and red pepper aioli on these. YUM!

Everyone loved the shrimp cakes. They are an excellent alternative to crab cakes that can be a bit more costly. I also add a touch of sour cream to add zest. Andouille suasage was not available so I substituted hot italian sausage (removed from the casing)instead.

This sounded so good in the recipe, but something got lost in the translation. Mixing the shrimp and the andoiulle created a weird combination of flavor and texture, kind of like a spicy bologna. Sorry, didn't care for it.
