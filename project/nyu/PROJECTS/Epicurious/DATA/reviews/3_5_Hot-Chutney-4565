This chutney has a real zing to it. My friends who aren't adventurous eaters didn't like it but my friends who do like lots of different foods raved about it! Easy to make and has a very unique flavor.

This chutney was really excellent and refreshing. It was too spicy for my husband, but I suspect this was due to the heat of the Thai chile that I used rather than any problem with the recipe itself. Recommended for any lover of cilantro, and a good use for the rest of that bunch that you bought for another recipe and now need to use up!
