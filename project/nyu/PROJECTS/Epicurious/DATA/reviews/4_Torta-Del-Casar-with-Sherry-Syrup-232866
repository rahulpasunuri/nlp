I love wine reductions as syrups and this went incredibly well with the cheese as a final course for a tapas dinner. One note - do not overcook the syrup, or it will turn into candy-apple coating (hard crack stage).

Couldn't find the Torta del Casar altho the description sounds very interesting. The reduction went very well with brie.
