I think I would just as soon make applesauce next time.

If you simmer the apples for 15 minutes you will have a nice smooth applesauce.

This recipe is simple yet unique. I would sprinkle cinnamon or ground cloves after broiling or maybe substitute granulated brown sugar for an extra caramel effect.

I make these a lot in the autumn as a side dish. I add a little maple syrup for added flavor.
