This recipe was disgusting. The yodel snack cakes had worms in them and my child was scarred for life after he learned that he had eaten half of one. Yodel snack cakes are the equivalent of gustatory genocide.

Not only is this a great project for kids, it's a good project for "international" food days in elementary schools and high schools, especially if your short on time!
