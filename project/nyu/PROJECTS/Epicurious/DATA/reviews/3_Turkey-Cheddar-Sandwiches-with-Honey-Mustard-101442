This is a very good sandwich, I love the flavor combo. I made the mistake of using a sourdough sub-roll instead of bread. The roll was really hard after being toasted. I would stick with the wheat bread. We also toasted the turkey. Very good. Yummy!

I made theses using a nice white Cheddar and sliced Golden Delicious apples. The result was amazing! The perfect balance of ingredients adding up to a wonderful sandwich. I especially loved how the multi grain bread was crunchy and toasted on the outer side while it remained soft and most on the inner side complimenting the honey mustard and cheese very nicely. This made for a great texture. Just a fantastic turkey sandwich.

Very good. I have also had this on toasted sour dough bread with the turkey, cheddar and a slice of apple. Then a honey mustard sauce - thin not thick....great! This is one of the special sandwiches served at a local sandwich/ice cream shop.

This was easy and yummy (to quote the last reviewer). I made it with the apple and celery salad. It made a nice TV-night dinner.
