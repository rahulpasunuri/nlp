Agreed with several reviews that this dessert isn't beautiful, but it's pretty tasty. As my boyfriend said, "baby, I'm not in this for the lookin'". The cake was in the oven by the time I bothered to read the other reviews that said the lemon flavor wasn't very prevalent so I squeezed half a lemon over it shortly after I flipped it out of the pan. I think this might be a more economical way to get that lemon flavor without zesting all the lemons in your house. As an aside, we didn't have any powdered sugar to sweeten the whipped cream. I mentioned that in passing to my boyfriend and he suggested using maple syrup (his favorite food). It was delicious! Whip cream to soft peaks, add maple syrup to taste and whip a bit more to mix it in. If not for this dessert, try it on something. Yum.

I made this to bring to the office. However it's so unappetizing looking I can't. Cake doesn't taste very lemony. If you make this for guests, you definitely need to plate it and serve with whipped cream. There's a mixed berry cake on this site that's just as easy and looks and tastes so much better.

WOW! I subbed dried lemon peel (Penzey's Spice) for the fresh grated. I used 2 T dried and rehydrated it in water, then strained out the peel and added it to the batter. The cake is dense like pound cake, rose nicely, baked almost to the minute per instructions. I used an 8 inch square pan instead of the round one. Garnished with thin lemon peel strips. It's soooo delicious!! I will definitely make this recipe again.

Great cake. It's sweet, but the flavor of the cake, a wonderful combination of lemon & almond, pairs beautifully with the blueberries & brown sugar. Make the Lemon Whipped Cream. It's the perfect companion.

Because I couldn't buy almond paste, I looked up a recipe for it. Upon discovering that it was basically almonds and sugar with egg white or water, I decided to use almond butter (ingredients: ground almonds) and a little extra sugar. It worked very well. The cake was a little golden in colour, but delicious. I reduced butter and sugar in the blueberry layer as others advised.

Made some adjustments after reading the reviews. For the blueberry topping, I decreased the brown sugar to 6 TBSP and the butter to 1/4 cup. As for the almond paste, after it did not break up well in the mixing bowl, I placed the cut-up pieces in a food processor and let it run for about 30 - 40 seconds, until it looked like cornmeal.

While I'll agree it may not be the prettiest dessert at a party, the taste is phenomenal. I got raves from my stepfather who normally doesn't care for cake...he even had seconds. Today will be my third time making it. I might try the recommendation to ass some raspberries - might improve the color and make it more eye pleasing. I highly recommend this recipe!

Tastes great but the method needs some work. The cake was absolutely not done after an hour. I turned it out and put it back in the oven for another 20 minutes so the bottom of the cake could finish baking. I think the topping is too heavy and rich. The cake itself is extremely rich so the topping can be lighter. Next time I'll try half the sugar and butter in the topping with the 1 1/2 cups blueberries.

I'm compelled to review this recipe because of the bad reviews. I first made this cake 3 years ago and it is very consistently great. I make it with fresh blueberries (will try raspberries also per other review), and I'm making for about the sixth time - for my in-laws. It is a great recipe and I did happen to get oohs and aahs on presentation.

Wow, I had problems with this recipe, too. I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but it was still uncooked in the center even though I cooked it about 10-15 minutes longer than directed. However, the parts that were cooked were delicious, so I think I'll try again. Might have been due to the type of pan I was using?

There are several problems with this dish. First, who the heck has an 8-inch cake pan? Second, there is way too much butter, especially in the topping. It just turns into a buttery slab when chilled. Third, this can barely be considered a cake, as it's about an inch tall. It's more like a tart. This recipe has good intentions but just doesn't deliver.

Rating: 0
Tasty, but not a cake you can bring to the table for oohs and aahs! It is best to serve to plate this dessert individually. I served slices with a rich vanilla ice cream, drizzling some of the sauce from the cake. As for the lemon, I believe the primary taste of the cake is almond and blueberry. If you want to intensify the lemon accent, best to use zest with either whipped cream or ice cream or maybe even some mascarpone.

This cake is delicious. The topping is especially scrumptious. Two things I did differently: I didn't have a lemon but happened to have lemon curd so I threw that in and it worked perfectly, and for the topping I used a half & half combination of blueberries and raspberries I'd picked the day before. Oh my it was so good! The cake was very moist and wasn't too sweet at all. My husband and daughter raved about it, and today I am going to make it again for dinner with friends. I have to disagree with other reviewers who said it was unattractive. My topping turned out a nice shade of purple (but maybe using raspberries helped), and as it cooled the topping got kind of shiny and you could see the texture of the fruit, which added to the presentation. Today when I make it again I am going to fool around with garnishes. This is definitely a keeper in my book.

This is perfect when blueberries are in season. Pros: flavorful, delicious, and easy to like Cons: Too sweet for some, not pretty to look at (bad presentation). I thought the sugar and butter was a bit excessive, for the topping. The cake was perfect, though.

Make this while blueberries are fresh and cheap. It makes grown men whimper. This is one of the best dessrts you can add to your file.

This is a really wonderful rich, easy to make cake, that even a 10 year old loved and ate happily. I am making this for the 2nd time tomorrow for mother's day.

Fantastic! I made this for a friend's birthday and it was a big hit. I agree that it needs more lemon so the lemon whipped cream is a good addition.

Exceptional! As a restaurant pastry chef I am always looking for recipes that are seasonal, have a good shelf life and will make my customers happy. This sure fit the bill! I had one from my test batch five days after I made them and they were still FABULOUS! I actually made little individual portions in ramekins and served it as a trio: lemon berry cake (served warm), pavlova w/ lemon curd and berries, lemoncello shot w/ sugared berries on a pretty pick.

I made this cake for a family potluck and it was the hit of the night! (A good thing, because the small bit left over didn't keep long.) We all thought the flavours were amazing together and I took the time to garnish the top to make it look great. I placed lemon slices and fresh blueberries on top and served the whipped cream on the side. A total success!

I love this cake, probably because I am a blueberry lover and this cake is full of 'em! I've made this cake several times(because it's my boyfriend's favorite dessert) and have never had any troubles, and it always turns out looking great. It is definitely a keeper!

This cake is unpretentious quality.... Didn't have any almond paste, so made my own with what I had (cream cheese, ground almonds, confectioners sugar and a drop of almond essence). Worked fine. Took the cake to a dear friend, along with tea and sympathy. This cake is perfect for those days when beautiful doesn't matter, but delicious does!

I thought this was great. Took it to a dinner party and it received rave reviews. I will say that to call it Lemon-Blueberry is not really accurate as there isn't much lemon in it. So the lemon whipped cream is a necessity, and tasted so good (I hate to admit that I didn't make the real thing... I bought fat free whipped cream and added the lemon juice and zest - it was great, and lower in fat/calories). I also thought the appearance of the cake was awesome - covered with the blueberries and then garnished with some lemon slices and fresh blueberries enhanced the presentation. A definate "do-again".

I made this dessert for Easter and it was wonderful! It seems that this recipe has gotten reviews that are both good and bad. I am definitely rating this as a keeper! I recommend making this dessert a few hours before serving. I presented this on a beautiful crystal cake stand and the blue color from the sauce looked very pretty. I actually liked the way it looked. I baked it in a non-stick cake pan, so it popped right out. If you are on the fence about trying this one, I would see for yourself as it is a fantastic blueberry/almond/lemon dessert for any occasion!!!

The cake portion is delicious; lemon- butter-almond flavours well combined resulting from a high butter and sugar content. Problem: appearance is very drab as blueberries and caramelised brown sugar are not a good combo. Not a good keeper.

While this was a good dessert, it was not great and I would not recommend it for company when you want an excellent presentation. It just isn't pretty. The flavor, however, is good. I would recommend decreasing the amount of lemon peel, as this gave it too much of a bitter edge. The lemon whipped cream complimented it nicely and helped to hide the unattractive (but tasty) cake topping.

True, this wasn't a particularly lovely cake, but it sure was rich and delicious. Great combination of flavors. Of course, lemon and blueberry is a classic combination, but the addition of the almond paste really made this shine and added to the richness and density. Nice and moist. I baked it in one of those silicone baking pans and it popped out easily.

Not spectacular but a nice variation on the blueberry lemon theme. I agree with previous rating-not especially great presentation but very tasty.

Rating: 3
Out of the 5 lemon dessert recipes in this Bon Appetit article, this was the only one without a picture. I now know why - it is not a pretty dessert. The blueberries turn the caramel bluish brown, resulting in a cake covered by bluish brownish blueberry lumps. The whipped cream helps, as would the lemon twists and other ganishes suggested in the recipe, but if you want a beautiful "look at me" show off dessert, this isn't it. However, it is fairly easy and tastes very very good. A great recipe to feed family or for a casual picnic type thing.

To the cook from San Antonio, TX: There is no reason why you can't make this ahead and refrigerate (or even freeze!) this dessert. Make sure the cake is cooled COMPLETELY. This may take an hour or two. Do not garnish. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Two layers would be ideal. If you leave it at room temperature, it will be edible, but the crumb will begin to change as the cake ages.

To the Cook who wants to make this for Easter- Make it a day ahead and keep it covered on the cake-plate at room temp. If it's humid, the sugar syrup will be a bit moist and then soak in, but it will be great. Do garnish it, and DO use a stand mixer- this is basically a pound cake and you cannot overbeat a pound cake. All the lift comes from beating air into the butter.

I have not made this recipe but would like to make it for Easter. Can anyone advise on whether this dessert can be made ahead of time? If so, does it need to be refrigerated, or can it remain on a covered cake stand at room temp.? I am not an experienced baker, so if someone could provide any helpful hints, that would be great! Thank you very much.

Didn't take the time to drag out my kitchenaid stand mixer - so did this with a regular electric mixer - big mistake. Other than that - this was delicious - the brown sugar topping was a little sweet - but my husband loved it. Will definitely make again! If you love lemon - make the lemon creme brulee tart on this site - it's the best lemon dessert I've found so far.
