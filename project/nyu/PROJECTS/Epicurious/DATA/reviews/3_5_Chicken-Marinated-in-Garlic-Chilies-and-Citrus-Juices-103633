Good recipe with simple changes. Added about 4 times the seasonings and 3 times the smoked chilis. I also added a couple of tablespoons of honey, and most importantly, added about 1/2 cup of cilantro! The cilantro made the flavors pop! But there are better recipes out there, this is not a "wow" dish.

I wasn't wowed by this recipe. I had to grind my own pasilla peppers, which was no easy feat. Not wanting to use my coffee grinder, I cut them into small pieces and tried unsuccessfully to grind them in my blender. Then I turned to the food processor, to which I finally added all of the maridade. By the time the pasillas were small (large flakes), the marinade was the consistency of mayonnaise! Oh well, after 30 hours of marinating, the flavors were not very impressive. I usually like most of Flay's recipes, but this one was pretty disappointing.

I made the marinade per the recipe, and then tasted it. I agreed with the reviewer who said that it was spicy but lacked flavor. Increased the OJ to 1/2 cup, added 1T honey and 1tsp salt. Wow! The honey really brought the flavors out and made this a 4 fork recipe.

Very good. There's little room for substitution of the peppers. I had dried ancho flakes and chipotles, and used top-notch chili powder (Pendery's, no McCormick bland stuff) in place of the pasillas.

I made this recipe as directed with VERY good quality peppers. I marinated large boneless chicken breasts about 16 hours and cooked them over a charcoal fire about 20 minutes. When you cut them you could watch the juice run out. Not a bad recipe at all, just nothing to write home about.

I've made this twice now, and bdespite my wife and I both loving spicy food, we were disappointed with the results both times. The first time I didn't have the right peppers, so I substituted (using a crushed red pepper melange and some pickled ahi peppers) and it wasn't that great. Having high hopes, I decided to make it again, obtained the right peppers, and made the recipe exactly as specified. Unfortunately, my wife and I both liked it even less. It is very spicy hot but it's just not very flavorful and the smokey aroma is a bit overpowering. The oragnge flavor was non-existent and sorely missed. I think this recipe could be better with more orange flavor and a touch of sweetness... maybe I'll use orange juice contentrate, or a bit of orange zest and honey and try something a variation. But as is, I will not be making this recipe again.

This is a great recipe. I've made it numerous times and everyone always raves about it. Great for grilling with friends. Has a little bit of heat, but not too much. Follow the recipe just as it is, the balance is perfect.

I served this chicken to a group of friends and they were literally licking their fingers! I marinated it for about 7 hours and it was moist and very flavorful. I'm not surprised though, I've made many of Bobby Flay's recipes over the last few years, and they have always met with rave reviews. I can't wait to try the rest of the recipes from this article!

I followed the Canadian cook's advice and made the entire Bobby Flay menu. The chicken was very good, but I couldn't find ancho peppers. I'll be interested in trying it again. Asparagus was orgasmic! White peach sangria a huge hit! Didn't need desert - the pound of white peaches and the cup and a half of grapes worked for desert for us. Tomato bread salad a disapointment.

The balance of flavors in this recipes is superb. I do feel it is important to use as many of the different chilies mentioned to create a more intricate layering of "heat". I made this recipe in winter and did not want to cook outdoors, so I marinated, then broiled the chicken breasts in the marinade. The thickened marinade created a nice, almost pasty sauce to serve over the chicken. May want a cooler side dish for relief!

Perfect summer grilling! I doubled this receipe for a dinner at our family gathering this summer and everyone raved. Great flavor! Easy to make!

This is a terrific marinade for chicken! We did the entire menu with the tomato-bread salad in spicy vinaigrette and asparagus with saffron-garlic aioli, washed down with a white peach sangria. Finished it off with a raspberry creme fraiche tarte and the meal was awesome.

Very flavorful marinade. My husband loved it. I marinated chicken breasts for an hour in it. I also doubled the chilies and garlic for more of a kick. I will definitely make this again.
