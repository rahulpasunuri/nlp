I made this for Easter this year; it was delicious! It is tart but so good with the shortbread. I was so happy the lemon curd set up well - I have made several lemon meringues with mixed results - this recipe was easy though time consuming - worth it! Lemon slices were beautiful yet pith inedible - perhaps you need to soak them longer - I would follow other review & leave the lemon slices out or just use lemon zest. All in all, I can't wait this again!

This recipe doesn't work too well. The lemon slices offer quite a presentation but as you slice through them it mawls the presence of the portion you serve. They probably are best to be omitted. The honey does not integrate well, and agave nectar may be a good substitute as a looser natural sweetener, but either way there is not much flavor imparted from that ingredient. The cook time may be a bit under-estimated, as well. I also suggest incorporating about 2 teaspoons of zest into the shortbread.

So, my follow up review. I don't think the shortbread need to be salty for this dessert to be wonderful. I'd make it again but opt for the normal amount of salt. I loved the lemon filling,and yes, VERY lemony and not for the faint hearted. Next time I'm going to make this as individual tarts with some Chantilly cream on the side.

I just pulled this out of the oven. It looks great, but it took twice as long in the oven as the recipe said which may be due to the high altitude I live at. Also, I upped the baking temp back to 325 from 300 because after 30 minutes it was still soupy. I think it is also worth mentioning that you should buy a BAG of the Meyer Lemons, I used up a whole one but am glad I bought a second bag just in case! Anyhow, I'll update my review after I try this dessert tonight!

This is a fantastic recipe. I've made it twice once using a mandolin and the other using a very very sharp knife to slice the lemon. Paper thin slices are the key to this recipe, and the mandolin (though much more efficient) just didn't work as well. Take the time to cut beautifully thin slices and you won't regret it as this is really a wonderful dessert.

Delicious and pretty! The crust and filling are a perfect balance of sweet, salty, and tart. I would only make them with meyer lemons, although I'd be interested to see how this recipe would taste with limes or oranges...

Only ok. The crust was too sweet to balance out the filling of which there was not enough.

Very tart, adult type of dessert. I would make again for the right guests. (i.e no children!) Agree with cook from Toronto that Meyer lemons are a must - so juicy and flavourful without being harsh at all, even with rind included(aren't we lucky to have PC! The ones at my store were perfect)

Superbly tart, but MUST be made with Meyer lemons to enjoy the full effect of the recipe - since they have a fuller, gentler taste.The sliced meyers are a toothsome surprise. If you are accustomed to a North American level of sweetness you will want to increase the sugar or honey.

I think this is a good base recipe--but think that it would be great with a couple tweaks. For me, including the rind made the lemon slices much to bitter. Next time, I will peel the lemon first and then thinly slice. Also, the tart itself is VERY tart. I believe the honey/sugar could be increase slightly. Lastly, I found the shortbread crust to be DELICIOUS.
