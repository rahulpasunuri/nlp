These are great and perfect to make ahead. I used a bit less cream cheese as suggested and put the blue cheese right in the potatoes with the cream cheese. I left them in the pot overnight and heated them up again on the stove. I topped them off with roasted pecans instead of candied pecans. Will make this again.

This was a very plain sweet potatoe dish. I was disapointed and I usually love sweet potatoes. They were dry and I had to add water to get them 'creamy.I was looking for savory but ended up with plain.

I made this one year for Christmas dinner and it was a screaming victory! I am making it again for Thanksgiving. Highly recommend this!

I would actually skip the cream cheese and just sprinkle more of the blue cheese and pecans on top as that's where the flavour came from.

This is quite tasty - and I agree - much better than the marshmallow version. The amount of cream cheese it calls for is insane though - Less butter can be used as well. I did put all the called for cream cheese and butter in but took it out after a couple minutes - it seemed like their was more butter and cream cheese than potato! Can't say or my family loved it - none of us care for sweet potatoes too much - but way better than the usual:)

This is such a great change from "the marshmallows" we usually see! We all loved the sweet/savory combination, and it is so easy to partially make the day ahead. That helps a lot in a busy kitchen! ;-)

Yum! This was a hit at Thanksgiving this year. I only used 1 8oz. package of cream cheese.

This a great simple and easy recipe. I love the salty and sweet components. Definitely better than regular sweet potatoes on Thanksgiving. We'll make these again next year!
