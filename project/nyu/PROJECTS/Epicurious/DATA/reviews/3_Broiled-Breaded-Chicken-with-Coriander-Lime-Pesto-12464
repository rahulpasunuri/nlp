I found the lime pesto very bland. If I made it again (unlikely), I'd leave out the parsley which seemed to neutralize the cilantro. The breaded chicken was okay by itself.

This was good! I added garlic to the pesto but other than that made it as written and served over chicken. I paired it with orechiette that I mixed with leftover pesto and a scoop of ricotta. I'm a huge fan of traditional pesto and this isn't quite as good in my opinion but nice for a change of pace.

I made just the chicken part of this dish, not the pesto. Under the broiler, the bread crumbs started to burn, so I turned the chicken before the prescribed 7 min. I ended up baking (with foil cover) to finish, 375 for about 15 minutes. I served the chicken with mashed potatoes and some leftover Thanksgiving gravy and it was a big hit!

I made this recipe with no alterations. It was easy, and had a fresh, subtle flavor. My husband loved it, because he's not a fan of regular pesto, which has too much garlic for him. This tasted great, even without any garlic, and the chicken was easy and tasty, too. The leftover pesto also makes a great addition to vinaigrette and tuna salad. I think it was the best tuna sandwich I ever had.

I also changed a few things and it turned out fantastic. I marinated the chicken breasts for 3 hours in garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper and a generous amount of lime juice. I also used half cilantro, half fresh basil in the pesto, and substituted pine nuts for walnuts. This dish was a big hit even with my 5 year old. It's a fairly complicated recipe with quite a few steps but it's worth it!

I was expecting the pesto to have lots of flavor, given the coriander and lime, but I was a bit disappointed. It was good, but not excellent.

My father is on a no sodium diet so this recipe is perfect - great flavor with no need to add salt. Does take some time to complete all of the steps.

Delicious, but I screwed with the recipe a lot. I wanted to grill the chicken, so instead of breading it I marinated it in some olive oil, a bit of lime juice, cumin, cayenne pepper, and some garlic powder for about an hour. For the pesto, I didn't have any yogurt so I used fat-free mayo instead, and I also added a bit of white pepper and seasoned salt. The chicken, grilled in a Foreman grill, came out semi-blackened - delish - and with the pesto spread on top was WONDERFUL. (If there was any left over it would have made superb day-after sandwiches with some tomatoes and greens.) I made grilled red and yellow bell peppers on the side, and plain white rice. Served with very cold beer garnished with lime. Yum!
