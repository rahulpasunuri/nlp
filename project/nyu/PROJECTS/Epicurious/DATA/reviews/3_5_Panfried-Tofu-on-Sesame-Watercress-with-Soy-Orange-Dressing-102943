I was disappointed with this recipe. As a vegetarian, I'm used to much more flavorful tofu dishes. I found this to lack flavor and the sauce was a disappointment as well. I'd substitute out the watercress next time for some more flavorful green.

Watercress is hard to come by in these parts (we live in Dublin at the moment), so we were forced to use spinach instead. We believe that watercress's bite would be an improvement on our result, which was less than inspiring, but more than edible. The main problem with the dish was simply that its flavors were underdeveloped. As we munched through our fourth piece of tofu each, pondering who would be lucky enough to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow, we asked ourselves how to improve this mediocre gem: freeze the tofu first to give it more body, use more sesame seeds to gain texture, and consider adding some chili oil for kick. With standards, G+J

Great flavor with minimal work! If you're making it as a main course and having rice with it, triple the sauce- it's very tasty and you'll want to sop it up.

I didn't have any watercress in the fridge so I used baby bok choy instead. It tasted great -- this simple, quick recipe is definitely a keeper.

I've made this twice, doubling the sauce both times. The first time I coated the tofu with cornstarch first - this resulted in the tofu having a crunchy outside but a soggy inside. I definitely prefer the tofu without cornstarch. I marinated the tofu the first time in soy sauce, ginger, garlic and sesame oil; I think it was fine without the marinade. I also substituted spinach for watercress. This is one of my husband's favorites.

I clipped this recipes a few yrs ago,and make it quite often.Though I dont normally need recipes for tofu I was tired of the same old thing.I really liked this dish but I do double the sauce amount and add cornstarch also.I think people who dont normally eat tofu would like this.I also use spinach in place of watercress.

This is now one of my staples for weekday meals. Its great. Its best with Watercress but is good with spinach as well. The tip about cornstarch on the tofu from a previous reviewer is great - I now always lightly dust tofu with cornstarch before frying to create a lovely crispy texture.

Pungent taste but this recipe needs some work. At the very least, next time I'll add some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it - too runny. I doubled the sauce but it just isn't right. Will tinker with it some more. Very easy to make and a good starting place playing with tofu!

Love this dish...it's simple flavors are sublime. I use spinach instead of watercress and double the sauce. I also put the cooked tofu into the sauce once it's simmered, which adds more flavor. The key is really the fresh ginger. I keep a knob of ginger in a baggie in the freezer, then peel what I need and grate on a fine grater. The frozen ginger grates easily and with no mess, and still has the fresh ginger taste. My husband adores this dish, and he's a confirmed carnivore!

not sure what all the fuss is about this recipe! I'm a vegetarian and i've had much better tofu dishes. For this one I doubled the sauce and then forgot to not double the soy sauce as recommended in the reviews so i added some extra orange juice and toasted sesame seeds to compensate. this was okay, and others seemed to like it, but i wouldn't make it again.

I've made this numerous times since I printed it a year ago.Definitely use corn startch.Most of the time I use spinach instead of watercress.This is a nice easy dish to make if you're having vegetarian guests and are at a loss as to what to prepare.You could even double the sauce recipe and amount of greens and serve as a side for the rest of your party.This is a simple,quick and nutritious meal that will leave you satisfied.

I have made this recipe many times and find it a wonderfully refreshing dish, particularly in the summer. I, too, coat the tofu in corn starch but have found after about four or five attempts that it must be a really light coating. I use organic extra firm tofu that also seems to hold together better. I've made it with whatever greens I have on hand or what looks best at my local market. This is a winner.

This was OK. The sauce (like others I doubled the sauce) and greens were great. I found the tofu to be a little flavorless. Any suggestions?

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and coated the tofu in cornstarch. Also doubled the sauce (except for soy), and was glad I did, because it's so yummy I could eat it like soup...but next time I might add some cornstarch to thicken it a bit. Also used spinach instead of watercress, which was delish. Am really happy to have found a good (and easy) tofu-as-main-course recipe. Yum!

Rave Review here too. Such an easy dish with such good flavor. We substituted baby argula for the watercress and nama shoyu for straight soy. We took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, but not the soy. A big hit on our table. We'll make this again and again.

Using Spinach instead of Watercress worked well (thank yuo previous reviewers!). I also coated the tofu in egg, and then dipped in cornstarch before putting in the pan (I used a little more oil) and it fried up quite crispy and yummy! I doubled the sauce and also added some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it before putting it on the tofu, which also worked well but I think it was a little too orangy. Next time I'll add less orange, more soy or perhaps teriyaki (i don't think i'd mind the saltyness...) I'd also add some crushed pepper to make it spicy! overall, excellent recipe when you tweak it a little :) i highly recommend scrolling down to read all the reviews! there are many helpful tips.

Delicious! I took the advice of preview reviewers and doubled the sauce (but not the soy sauce) and coated the tofu in corn starch before frying. This was the crispiest tofu I've ever made! I loved it, and so did my carnivore husband. The extra sauce came in handy--it was great poured over the rice I made! I also used spinach instead of watercress, just because it looked better at the market. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! I followed all the previous reviewer's suggestions and added carrots. My husband liked it even though he usually does not care much for tofu. Can't wait to make this for my vegetarian son!!

We all (two young boys and husband) gave this a big thumbs up. I marinated the tofu in a soy ginger marinade prior to grilling it in a cast-iron grill pan. Once the tofu was removed, I stir-fried onion, broccoli, and carrots, and then added spinach near the end. Put the veggies on a serving dish, sprinkled on the sesame seeds, topped it with the tofu, and poured the slightly reduced sauce over all. It was a huge hit with brown rice (which the boys don't eat without a generous sprinkling of furikake on top.) Nothing more was needed for a complete meal.

I made this with tofu that I grilled over charcoal, and it was GREAT! This recipe is so wonderful. Have made it for company to big success. It freezes well too (the tofu and sauce part). I agree that doubling the sauce is a must.

FANTASTIC if you follow readers' suggestions. Double sauce, panfry cornstarch-coated, marinated, pressed tofu (I used grapeseed oil for high heat). Add julienned red pepper for color, tahini for flavor,a dash of hot sauce for spice. Used all spinach; served with jasmine rice. Really, really good.

Following other reviewers' suggestions, I doubled the sauce (except for soy) and coated the tofu in cornstarch. (I then added the corn starch remnants to thicken the sauce) Fabulous!! Cornstarch is my new favorite thing. No need to bother marinating cuz the sauce thickens enough to adhere giving each bite lots of flavor. And the texture of the tofu was simply sublime - crispy and wonderful! By the way I was worried about the OJ ingredient, seemed strange combo but it really was delish!

This was a great tofu dish! I also doubled the sauce (without doubling soy sauce) and it was fantastic. I like to dip the sliced tofu in cornstarch and then panfry it -- it has a nice texture that way...I also used half watercress and half baby bok choy -- both were great although the watercress does get a little bitter. Also, used julienned red pepper as per another reviewer's suggestion - very pretty that way.

double sauce for sure, and keep soy sauce the same! it was great BUT all i tasted was the soy, so be sure ti reduce. i marinated 1 hour in combo of garlic ginger, soy and sherry. then did panko as recomended. used all spinach and jasmine rice, i rarely give a four, this is it.

Hello, I have not actually made this dish yet, but I am more looking for suggestions of what to serve it with for Valentine's Day. My boyfriend loves this kind of food, but I am stumped as to what else to make. The dishes have to all be vegetarian. . .any suggestions? What have you served it with? Thanks! Please email suggestions to powellkristy@yahoo.com. : )

This is a wonderful dish, and very traditional Chinese cooking. I would highly recommend this dish and it had become one of my favorites, and it is very quick and easy to make. The rice is a must side dish. One change I would make to this is increase the orange juice to 2/3 cups and instead of puttting the sesame seed on the napa. Stir in the orange juice mixture and pour over the tofu and napa, Wonderful!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I make this every other week. It is so easy and fast. I used both watercress and spinach (cooked them seperately)because I love watercress, but my boyfriend hates it. Like other reviewers, I also doubled the sauce.

After reading other reviewers' comments, I decided to give this ago. Very satisfying and perhaps one of my favorite tofu recipes (and I am easily bored with tofu. Pressing the tofu between towels and then marinating is definitely a must. Threw in a red bell pepper at the end- a nice of touch of color with spinach (instead of watercress). Served on a bed of brown rice. A great weektime dinner. Oh, I used good sesame oil for everything and cut the tofu into little squares.

I was impressed at how quick and easy and inexpensive it was. The first time, I used watercress and spinach. The second time, I used bok choy. I think in the future I will just use spinach. The first time I fried the tofu as directed, but the second time I made it in my George Forman grill. I really liked it grilled; the tofu was lighter and more tender. The one thing I'd like a tip on is how to give the sauce a little more punch. I marinated it but it was still a bit thin on taste.

The sauce for this recipe was delicious. It reminded me of the ginger dressing used at so many Japanese restaurants. I've made this recipe sevaral times. Once, I only had romaine lettuce around the house. The dish still held up.

This has turned out to be my favorite tofu recipe. Recently, I had to cut out all red meat. Tofu has been a break from chicken breasts. The flavors combine so well in this recipe, that I would choose this over many chicken breast recipes. You can substitute fresh spinach for the watercress. This is a winner!!

Very good and tasty. Definately press tofu between clean towels to get out as much water as possible. I used good paper towels (the kind that are strong and don't tear when wet) wrapped around tofu and weighted down with cook books. I changed the towel several times until they were no longer soaking wet. Then I dipped the tofu in beaten egg and dredged in panko (Japanese style bread crumbs) before frying. This gave the tofu a lovely, crunchy texture, almost like tempura. Soooo good! Even my friends who aren't fans of tofu loved this dish! The watercress seemed to get a little more bitter when cooked, so maybe next time will toss in some other greens to cut down on the bitterness, but still very tasty as is.

Rating: 4
I followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers and marinated the tofu in sesame ginger. Yummy! It's extremely important to get as much water out of the tofu as possible, this will make it easier to handle. The watercress, seared tofu and light dressing go exceptionally well together. I will serve this next time with plain white rice or glass noodles.

both the tofu and the watercress ( or spinach in my case) would be delicious on their own. its the best way i have found to prepare tofu or spinach. definately use less soy sauce.

I just love the versatility of tofu and the classic Asian flavors of the sauce combined well with the spicy pungence of the watercress. Served it over a bed of jasmine rice. This was a super-easy weeknight meal that I will make again.

This was a really fun meal to make! I doctored it up a bit as suggested by previous reviews- found a great ginger/sesame marinade which really made the tofu so lovely! used spinach instead of watercress, and added a little drizzle of tahini to the lot as i did not have any sesame seeds, other than those in the marinade. Overall, it turned out wonderful, this is one to invite friends over to show off! YUM! As a side note- may use less soy sause next time- just a tad too loud of a taste competing with the ginger & sesame flavors.

This was my first try with a tofu recipe...and it was absolutely delicious. I even felt healthier after eating it. I did marinate the tofu in the dressing for a few hours before pan searing it. I may like to get the tofu a little more browned than most people, and this is easy to do. I did need to cover the pan with a lid due to spattering because I sauteed it on a high heat.

Easy and delicious is how I would describe this recipe. I didn't have any watercress so I used 2 1/2 cups of fresh baby spinach and it worked great. Also for my taste I added alittle extra garlic and ginger. I will definitly make this again.

This dish was very easy to prepare and tasted great! However, I definitely concur with previous reviewers that the tofu is much better if marinated first. The sauce was wonderful, though. We exceeded the recipe's recommended amount of orange juice by a little but added a dash of corn starch to help thicken the sauce slightly.

Tasty! My boyfriend really liked it. I made the mistake of skimping on the watercress -- I used one big bunch and it really wasn't enough. I wanted the make a bed of watercress to put the tofu on -- the result was more like a watercress doily. Use lots. Also, I didn't have a nonstick pan so I used a reasonably well-seasoned cast iron pan, and boy did the tofu stick. It broke apart, too. It still tasted great, though. Definitely use lots more orange juice in the sauce. This doesn't look like it makes much, but it sure is filling. Eat a lot of tofu and ten minutes later it's like you've swallowed one of those animal-shaped die-cut sponge capsules.

I substituted spinach for the watercress, and it was terrific with the sesame seeds and orange sauce. But the tofu seemed bland and uninteresting--even though I marinated it for 45 minutes. If I try this recipe again, I'll marinate it longer--and make extra sauce.

This was a very good recipe for tofu, and was very easy to make. The first time I made it I used firm tofu (which worked great) and added the already fried tofu to the sauce as it was reducing which made the tofu more favorful. Next time I would double the ingredients for the sauce and add a sliced jalapeno to make it spicy. Be careful not to over-brown the tofu or it will be chewy.

This had a delicious orange flavor--I cooked the tofu for a minute or two in with the sauce to reduce the sauce a bit and flavor the tofu at the same time. I found myself wishing I had more of the sauce to flavor the rice with!

Excellent dish! I made it with spinach per the suggestions in the other reviews, and it was perfect. I only needed about 1/3 the oil to brown the tofu the way I wanted (with a non-stick pan).

You might think that four forks is overstatement for relatively plain seeming tofu, but I have to say that this is a great dish (particularly if you are avoiding meat and are at a loss). I think the key is fresh ingredients. Fresh chopped ginger gave it a great (but subtle) heat and the fresh OJ gave it zest. I used about a third less oil than called for, and I think 1.5 tablespoons could be overkill. I had to sautee the tofu for about twice as long as called for to get the tofu golden on my electric range. I also substituted spinich for watercress, and it worked well. Just remember that greens reduce significantly when they wilt, so don't be skimpy.
