i love this recipe. i was concerned about the steaming of the potatoes but they came out tender for me. i too added rosemary and that was nice, it was a little bland though and needed sea salt and black pepper, and extra dressing. great all week, warm or cold, just good!

Absolutely delicious! I did make a few changes to the orignal recipe. I substituted red onion for celery, and increased the amount of bacon that the recipe called for. I also added a little bit of sugar, a glug of balsamic vinegar, some good quality German mustard, and a dash of cayenne pepper to the vinaigrette. I can't wait to make it again--both my husband and I agree it's a do-over, despite the fact it does take a bit of work to make.

I've made this salad a few times and it is my favorite potato salad recipe. I like it because it is lite and not so full of fat. But my favorite way to eat it is chilled, the next day. It gives the flavors a chance to come out.

We really enjoyed this. I added a touch of salt and sugar to the dressing and tossed in some garlic shrimpjust before serving. I did find it a little time consuming for every day, searing and chopping peppers, doing bacon etc. but it was really tasty. Will make again but will start prep a little earlier.

Neither I nor my dinner guests particularly enjoyed this salad. The dressing was rather bland and the potatoes were oddly crunchy despite having steamed them for slightly longer than the recipe called for. What's more, I didn't like having to focus on the timing of the fussy, hot elements of this salad only minutes before we were ready to eat in order to ensure that the spinach would be adequately wilted. It wasn't worth the hassle as far as I'm concerned.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe with the following changes: I added sliced mushrooms and chopped red pepper to one tsp. of the remaining bacon fat and cooked for 2-3 min over high heat to get a bit of browning & added them along with the warm dressing (this was in lieu of roasting the peppers - I didn't have enough time for that) I found the dressing to be a bit sharp for my taste, so I added 1 tbsp. of maple syrup which mellowed the tang of the vinegar & garlic nicely. I had about 2 tbsp. of toasted sliced almonds on hand so I threw those in as well - they added a nice crunch. I definitely used more than the two cups of spinach leaves but I didn't measure. This is easy & very tasty, try it!

Everything was fine with this salad except it was a cold day in November so I threw the whole salad back into a frying pan and ate it as a one dish dinner. I keep making it again because with yellow and orange peppers it is pretty, it's easy, it's warm and it tastes good.

This dish was delicious and easy. It is important to time everything correctly so that the potatoes are hot and the red pepper is hot, and the dressing is warm, so that the spinach will wilt slightly. I cooked the potatoes too far ahead of time (5 minutes too soon) and the dish was not warm enough to wilt the spinach leaves.

What a wonderful low-fat salad! The potatoes give it substance without adding meat. This is one of our favorite salads.

This recipe is one my husband loves as well as I. The bacon flavor just makes it and it's one of our favorites. The potatoes satisfy the beast in my man (steak and potato man). Thanks.

I used small red potatoes instead of Yukon gold; yellow bell pepper instead of red. I also added pan-seared scallops. Everyone was very extremely pleased.

I found the dressing was too sharp. If I cooked this again I would halve the amount of vinegar used. The dressing seemed to overwhelm the salad.
