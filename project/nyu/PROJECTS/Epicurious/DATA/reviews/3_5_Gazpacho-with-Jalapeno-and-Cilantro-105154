Made it exactly as directions detailed and it was a delicious popular dish at my dinner party. It tasted clean and refreshing. Use fresh tomatoes from the garden/farmers market if possible. The only difference was I put in 4 cups of tomato juice, not 3 1/2.

This was tasty, but in appearance, texture, and taste it seemed more like a blended salsa than a gazpacho.

I made this soup for a summer birthday party and people loved it. It was a little bland after chilling overnight, so I added hot sauce which made it perfect.

I really enjoyed this even though half way through the blending process, the blender went haywire and me and my kitchen were covered in gazpacho. I abandoned the blender at that point and ended up having some chunkier gazpacho. Omitted the jalepeno and used extra cilantro. It was great, very hard to mess up I guess. I topped it with sliced avocado and shrimp. Delish! Fresh, and oh so healthy!

I tried this recipe a few weeks ago and it was delicious! I added extra jalapeno, which made it very spicy. The cilantro also gave it great flavor. It's great topped with chopped avocado or a sliced boiled egg.

I loved this recipe. The cilantro gave it great flavor, and I didn't miss the oil that some other recipes call for. Easy and delicious!

Very good, but next time I may not put in as much garlic (I put in 3 cloves, that's too much).

I used extra garlic and added a few drops of habanero hot sauce. It worked very well and I'd easily do this again.

I agree with those who found this a bit bland and recommended some additional heat. Use the seeds of the jalepeno or a hot sauce or oil. I also used fresh yellow tomatoes, which required some adjustment to the recipe. But the recipe is a good base to start from. Add a grilled shrimp, avocado and lettuce salad and a white sangria, and enjoy!

Great recipe! I prefer lime juice to lemon juice in this recipe. I serve this in a Martini or Margarita glass with cubed avocado and cooked shrimp in it. It makes a fantastic shrimp cocktail. Great on a hot day!

Once I added hot sauce (and make sure it is a great quality hot sauce), this is the best gazpacho recipe I have ever tried.

Excellent. To give it more variety and zing, I added a chopped green pepper, subbed lime juice for lemon juice, and kept the seeds in the jalapeno.

Best Gazpacho recipe I have tried. I forgot to get a jalapeno, but it was not missed. This is a good recipe to prepare well ahead of time because it takes a lot of time for all that chopping, even using a food processor. You also use a lot of bowls for all the chopped ingredients. But it's worth it.

Very tasty and extremely healthy! Since I love spice, I added extra onion, garlic, and hot sauce.

This is a wonderful gazpacho recipe. I also add the juice from at least one lime and one stick of celery, chopped. I have made this recipe for family twice and gotten rave reviews each time.

Surprisingly good, although I was skeptical about the absence of olive oil. A very good alternative to the traditional gazpacho, especially if you want something fat free and spicy.

The only thing I changed on this was put in more cilantro and left out the parsley, just personal taste. Also top it off by shreading up some fresh basil. Out of this world and so good for you.

I made it exactly! as the recipe suggests and the soup was fantastic. To the cook who felt this gazpacho required too much chopping, don't chop the parts you are going to put into a blender. With temperatures saring at 36.6C presently here in Vancouver, (98F) , it was an incredible, cool weekend dinner course.

Delicious. Fresh. I doubled the recipe and it was still great. I found that there is LOTS of chopping, so chopped the day before, then blended a few hours before serving. It worked out great. The first time I chopped the veggies too small, so I made the second batch with a little larger vegetable pieces and liked it better. Guess it is all so individual. The celantro was the prize flavor, which made this stand out from other recipes.

Yummy and simple. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested a splash of Worcestershire - it really makes a difference. Wow - spicy, too.

Great summer meal. I used canned diced tomatoes and it was still delicious. Used Muir Organic roasted tomatoes which added some nice depth to the taste.

I made this gazpacho for a party and it was fabulous. I doubled it, but did not double the onion, as I thought one raw onion in a double recipe was enough. I made it the night before and it was a real crowd-pleaser the next day. Seeding and chopping the tomatoes was a lot of work (16 for the double recipe) but the result was delicious so I'd make it again.

This soup is very refreshing. I have varied the proportion of blended to chopped vegetables, depending on what texture I want.

A little extra work but well worth the effort. Excellent testure and flavor. I tried many recipes for gazpacho and this is my favorite.

Even before I saw this recipe, I made my gazpacho in a similar manner. This is a great reicipe. It can easily be adapted to anyone's taste with minor alterations.I add some cumin and cayenne(or Emeril's Essence), increase the jalapeno content and add lime juice instead of lemon. Also, authentic or not, I use V8 instead of tomato juice.

I would make it with more Jalapeno! I have tried lots of recipes for this excellent soup and this is goodie!

This gazpacho didn't have any zing to it. I wouldn't make it again or if I did, I'd add a lot more spice.

I think this is a terrific recipe. Its simple to whip up during the week and with some crusty bread makes a perfect summer meal. Its not very spicy, but is very tasty. I added a little yellow pepper as well for color and Tobasco for a little kick. I'll definitely make this again!

Very blah. I have made gazpacho before and have always used Snap-E-Tom tomato cocktail as the liquid. I also use 4 or 5 different types of fresh chiles. IE. jalapeno, serrano, anaheim, cayenne. They all contribute to flavor and heat. Also shake some worcestershire sauce in. YUM!

This gazpacho recipe was good but it wasn't great. Inspite of the name it wasn't very 'hot' and I used Spicy V8 for the tomato juice. Next time I'll use additional lemon juice, cilantro and jalapeno or look for a better recipe.

This is the perfect gazpacho. I tempered the heat a little with a milder chili and used canned tomatoes. Served for dinner with some crusty bread. This is a great one for hot summer days!
