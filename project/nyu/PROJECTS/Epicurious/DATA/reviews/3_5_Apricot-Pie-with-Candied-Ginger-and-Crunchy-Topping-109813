This is THE Best Apricot Pie I have ever had! The ginger is the perfect touch and the grapenuts(which I usually do not cook with)added a great crunch without getting soggy. Made this for a dinner party & it was a huge hit!

Good flavor, loved the ginger. Topping was nice and crunchy-perfect foil for the apricots. Used packaged crust.

Loved this recipe. My mother had given me a ton of Apricots from her tree and this was one of the first things I made with it. Needless to say I made three pies for dinner parties and there was raves for each one. The ginger component is a bit light though, so feel free to amp it up

This pie was exceptionally good. Especially the next day!!! I did alter the recipe as I am allergic to gluten. I made the crust from ground gluten free oatmeal cookies (1 cup) and then the additional flour was gluten free all purpose from Bob's Red Mill Flours. I used this flour as a substitute when the recipe called for flour. The result was delicious, and my whole family loved it.

made this recipe last weekend and it turned out a complete success. It involves a lot of work but turns out to be delicious. I added peaches to apricots and reduced the sugar by half

This was just okay. A lot of work for the result. Served with vanilla bean ice cream. It all did disappear but I wouldn't make it again.
