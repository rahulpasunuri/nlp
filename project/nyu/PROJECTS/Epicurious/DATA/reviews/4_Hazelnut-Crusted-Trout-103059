I used rainbow trout and pecans. I skinned them (interesting and delicious) as suggested by "bdobbins" below. Also, Instead of frying for six minutes a side, try three minutes a side then remove, put in baking dish, and then bake at 350 for five minutes. Tonight is my second time with this recipe. The best trout this side of Gatlinburg, TN.

Tossing abandon onto the flames our second night of trout was a success! This is a simple, great recipe there was no need to change a thing. Served with a bottle of Falanghina Campania

I thought this dish was very bland. It would have been unedible without the sauce. I won't make it again.

Isn't it always the way that the simplest recipes are often the best. This has the potential to be an outstanding dish as long as you get the best and freshest fish. It's greatness is in it's simplicity which highlights the freshness (or not!) of the fish.

I substituted Mahi Mahi in place of the trout and Macadamia Nuts instead of hazelnut, and followed the rest of the recipe. It was wonderful! The leftovers were even better the next night. I would double the sauce next time as it was very good on the rice too! Definitely a keeper!!!

The seafood lady wouldn't skin the trout so I used tilapia filets instead. Didn't have hazelnuts so I used almonds coarsley chopped and followed everything else. It was delicious!

Delicious, fast and easy. A great way to serve fresh trout. I'd suggest skinning the trout first, simple to do if the trout it fresh. Remove the head, hold near the tail, and pull the skin from the head area towards the tail. Easier than cleaning corn. Instead of frying for six minutes a side, try three minutes a side then remove, put in baking dish, and then bake at 350 for five minutes.
