A good chef/cook makes soup in one pot. Anything else is poor planning. I recommend searing off your bacon, then saute your veg in the fat, then slowly add your liquids/seasonings to deglaze the pan, then add your seafood. When your ready to burr/blend the soup just scoop out a couple of cups of veg and seafood, burr, then add the stuff back in. Much easier, less dish, and more flavor in the pot!

De-lightful! De-licious! De-lovely! Didn't have any clam juice so substituted chicken broth. We really enjoyed it and will absolutely make it again.

This was an excellent recipe. It was the highlight of the evening and enjoyed so much the recipe went home with several people.

Excellent recipe. Savory & delish - I loved the color, flavor & texure. The only slight adjustment I made was to cook the bacon first and use the bacon fat to cook the first batch of leeks, rather than butter. I served it with a couple of toasted romano sourdough crostini, just so that it wouldn't be TOO healthy - heh!

We made this exactly as directed and were very disapponted. Flavor and texture were not as good as the white chowder recipe we've used which is thickened with cornstarch.

Love this recipe! Made it almost as written, but I didn't have enough clam juice so I used 1 c. clam juice and 2 c. vegetable broth. This was a very flavorful chowder with great texture. I especially love having a chowder that is rich and satisfying but doesn't use cream! Definitely try this one!!

I thought this recipe is okay. prefer the corn and lobster chowder. I thought the instructions as listed were crazy. I made this a 1 pot soup...started with leeks, added bacon, then added carrots, celery and clam juice...added vegetable broth and red pepper. Cooked sccallops separately and added at the end. IT was good but not great and don't want to wast scallops in this recipe... good luck if you take this on

I made this for my mother on Mother's Day and it rocked! I tossed in some corn to stretch it a bit and paired it with a simple salad and French Bread. Very good stuff!

An absolutely exquisit recipe. Easy to do, quick and the clam as well as vegetarian variations are just as good!

The recipe was very savory given the speed of it's preparation. I was pleased to see the results of parboiling the vegetables and adding them to the prepared stock. It left the chowder with a much more toothsome appeal than I had been able to achieve in the past. An excellent, fast recipe, and one that I will surely keep.
