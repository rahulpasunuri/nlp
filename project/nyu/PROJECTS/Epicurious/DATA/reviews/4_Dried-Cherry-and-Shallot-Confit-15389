Way too much vinegar!! Why do reviewers give recipes 3 - 4 forks when they change it so drastically? I made as per recipe, now I'm going to add about a cup of port and reduce it again hoping to tame the vinegar taste. I won't look at the fork ratings of any of these recipes again - only read the comments. Will NOT make again according to the recipe. And technically, it's not a confit.

Great as appetizer served over thin slice of manchego cheese on wedge of baguette. First had this confit served as appetizer at my neighbor's house and became a fan. Making it as appetizer for Easter this year.

This was soooo good, I am getting hungry just thinking about it! Easy to make and worked nicely with the duck in port wine sauce recipe (also on Epicurious) which I made. A sweet and savory alternative to cranberry sauce --I think I'll make this the next time I have a turkey.

This was really good. Although I did make some changes. I was unable to find dried cherries so I subbed dried cranberries. I read the suggestion of another reviewer of less vinegar. So instead of the wine vinegar I used port. It turned out awesome. This was a lovely side to the Duck Breast with Port Sauce recipe. I would use this confit with other roasted or grilled meats, as it would compliment the flavor. My husband was skeptical at first, but then had several serving and said he really liked it. I highly recommend this recipe to others.

I made this recipe twice. The first time, I could only find sweet dried cherries, and even though I cut down on vinegar and added more sugar, the taste was still too overpowering. You had to use very little of it. This time I needed a cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving, so I made the recipe with fresh cranberries instead of dried cherries. It was good! I added very little vinegar, and a lot more sugar, and used red onions.

To the cook from Stockholm, a confit is to be served alongside a main dish as a condiment, much like a chutney. The term comes from the French verb "confire", meaning to preserve. Traditionally, a confit referred to a meat that was cooked and preserved in its own fat. Here, you are creating something more like a 'confiture' that is an accompaniment to a complementary main dish. (I hope I am not too late with this response!)

I haven't actually made this recipe yet. I'm not familiar with confits. I planned to make this to accompany the Breast of Duck with Port Sauce on this site as suggested, but I'm not sure what to do with it exactly. Is it to be served on top of the duck breasts in addition to the port sauce, or served on the side like a side dish, or just in a little bowl for people to take and put on their duck? I hope somebody reads this and answers before next week when I'm making it:-) thanks to whoever might enlighten me!

This is amazing with any roast (chicken, pork). I added a bit more sugar. Everyone loved it-even those who do not love sweet foods.

We served this with lamb at a dinner for ten - just the right amount. Didn't have wine vinegar but used raspberry vinegar, possibly even better to accentuate the cherries. Everyone loved it and it was very easy to make especially using a mandolin slicer. I had to cook it a lot longer than specified, probably because I was generous with the shallots - my favorite onion relative. Delicious!

AMAZING. I used dried bing cherries, and guessed on the measurements since dinner was for 2. I served it with a baked ham, brown rice pilaf, oriental salad, and was told this confit is what makes a good cook a chef!

Wow, wow, wow. Pure decadence! I added 4.5 tablespoons of sugar and it was PERFECT! I urge everyone to try it.

I give this recipe a qualified three: I add more sugar than the recipe calls for (can't say exactly how much, each time I adjust the sugar "to taste." With the bumped up sugar this is one of my favorite condiments. I make it instead of cramberry sauce to accompany turkey dinner. Without the extra sugar, this recipe is too, too sour and vinegary. Either that, or I'm using dried cherries that are much more tart than the kind used in the test kitchens. The black pepper finish is great, too.

Outstanding. Go find some sour cherries.
