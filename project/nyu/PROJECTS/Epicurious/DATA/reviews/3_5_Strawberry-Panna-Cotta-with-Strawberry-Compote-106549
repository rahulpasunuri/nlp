Gave it three forks for flavor, but what a disaster mine turned out to be - didn't set at all. In fact, it never got more firm than a smoothie. I'm pretty sure it's because I used frozen strawberries (defrosted). So bummed because not only did I not have a stunning dessert for Christmas Eve dinner, I wasted my last strawberries from summer's garden...

Well.... did not set as I expected. I used organic strawberries and dairy -lacked flavor. Compote was average at best. Sadly will not make again.

I should have added more gelatin like the other reviewers suggested but because of a prior experience with panna cotta thought I could get away with the recipe as written.

I forgot to add that I used a fine mesh seive to strain the berries...I don't think that anything else would work quite as well as the seeds are so tiny.

WOW! This was amazing and hard to believe that it is a low fat dessert! I didn't even bother with the compote, because the natural berry flavor was so amazing (and I was lazy). I used 2% milk instead of whole and added an extra teaspoon of gelatin. I can't wait to make this for guests in the summer when I have fresh berries from the garden. A new favorite for sure!

Delicious. I made this for a party and based on other reviews, I added one and a half packets of gelatin-- it was perfect. I found that an ordinary strainer did not get rid of the seeds--it required a very fine strainer. It was a fantastic summer dessert and I will make it again.

Added extra gelatin per suggestion and it was definitely needed. However, had a problem with a few lumps. Reserve more of the buttermilk to mix with gelatin. You can also just chill & serve in a dish w/o unmolding. I skipped using a sieve (Don't own) but it was a little grainy.

This was delicious. Only change is I cut the sugar a little because the berries were quite sweet on their own. As far as it not firming up enough, mine was perfect -- typical for a panna cotta. It should still be giggly when you turn it out and start to lose it's shape. Adding more gelatin wouldn't be bad if you're looking for a firmer texture. Mine came out just as it should have though and I wouldn't change a thing.

I lucked out by accidentally adding more gelatin--approximately 4-5 teaspoons instead of two---and ended up with a firm but not too hard consistency. Also used 1/2 cup cream instead of 1/4 cup. The strawberry compot was great with a little bit of port added to bring out the flavor!

This recipe was quite yummy. Depending on how sweet the strawberries you are using, I would use less sugar if necessary. I'll keep that in mind for the next batch.

Because Panna Cotta is one of my favorite desserts I have made different recipes before and I know that it is usually a good idea to add MORE gelatin. I wish that I had done so. The flavor of this recipe was quite good but it is a soup not a custard.

Thank goodness I did not let others keep me from making this dessert for Christmas!!! this is now be a regular to use many times since we live in "strawberry land CA"! Since I was "warned" about the consistency, I used dessert glasses and saved plenty of room for the compote. Well, I missed out on a beautiful presentation!! It was very firm and very delicious. Anyone having problems with this recipe must have not followed the simple directions!!! If you want to "take it up a notch" add some orange liquor to the compote. Hope you try it, great for Valentines Day is heart shape molds. Peggy, CA

This is a great recipe; we have a local restaurant in Truro, NS, Canada that serves a great version of this recipe. It is called Strawberry Lucien and is served at the buffet on Sunday night and at the Roast Turkey buffet mid-day Fridays at the Howard Johnson Hotel and Convention Centre, Prince Street, Truro, NS, Canada. It is my husband's [Larry]and my, favorite. Thanks so much for this recipe.

Yhis recipe should be renamed strawberry soup. With many years of cooking experience I followed the recipe to the letter, only to end up with a lovely tasting soup! Is it possible the strawberries do not allow the gelatin to work? I would not waste my time or wonderful California strawberries!

Can I substitute agar agar or another seaweed-based product for the gelatin? many thanks!
