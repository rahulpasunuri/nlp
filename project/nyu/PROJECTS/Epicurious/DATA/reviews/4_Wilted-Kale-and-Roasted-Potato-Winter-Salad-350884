I agree with the last reviewer. I also rely on the reviews and would tend to trust a review that so consistently gets 4 forks. I made this with roasted sweet potato (cut around 3/4 in., roasted 25 min. before adding cheese) and leftover roasted kale last night. I thought it was good and, surprisingly, my teenage daughter made a point of telling me she liked it. But it wasn't 4 forks, not sure I would make it again except that it is a great way to use leftover roasted kale.

I followed this recipe exactly, yielded results that sound much like everyone else's, enjoyed a second helping, but still, I have to wholeheartedly agree with a previous commenter that this dish is bizarre at best. When a recipe from Gourmet has 50+ reviews and maintains a 4-fork-epicurious-rating, I generally have high expectations, and this dish just didn't measure up. If I were to make this again though, I would roast the potatoes longer to make them more crispy, add more cheese, wilt the kale on the stove rather than with the heat of the potatoes, and maybe even add some lemon zest or sriracha to the dressing. So if you're like me, and looking for an excellent vegetarian dinner to make in the middle of winter, I must advise that, as written, this one is overrated.

Loved it. Just tested it for christmas. Par boil the kale just for a minute or less? I doubled the dressing because I like tahini, and my Meyer lemon tree is on overdrive..

After reading the prior reviews, I had high expectations for this recipe and it certainly DELIVERED! Wow, this is an amazing recipe. I made it exactly as written with red Russian kale from our Farmer's Market. I highly recommend you try it.

I tried with sweet potatoes, as some recommended, the second time I made it, and it was soooo good. Sweet and salty and bitter together--YES!

We absolutely loved this recipe. This is easily one of the best dinners I have ever made. In my life. It was so easy and so delicious that my fiance and I ate the whole thing between the two of us. I did make some changes: I used coconut oil, instead of olive oil (olive oil is great but it burns at a much lower temperature than coconut oil and a slew of recent studies have found coconut oil to be very healthful). I also used a mix of sweet potatoes and red bliss potatoes. Lastly, I used raw cheddar cheese (the only thing I had in the house). Don't be shy with the garlic! After mixing the hot, roasting potatoes with the kale (and cut the kale VERY small), I covered the bowl with the baking sheet from the oven for a couple of minutes to thoroughly wilt the kale. Perfection.

I thought this recipe was bizarre at best. We are big fans of kale, but I thought the tahini dressing was a strange combination. The parmesan was completely lost in the final product. I believe I used too much kale, and I followed the suggestions to use sweet potatoes. I ended up picking out the sweet potatoes and pitching the kale.

I made this tonight using kale, sweet potatoes, and red skinned potatoes from my CSA. I didn't have tahini so took another reviewer's suggestion and used half olive oil and half whole grain mustard instead. I also covered the potatoes and kale after tossing them together so the steam from the hot potatoes would soften the kale a little more. I found that the dish itself was a little tart for my taste, and in an effort to balance the tartness and make a meal out of it, I added a gently fried egg on top. That took it to a "whole 'nother level." I would recommend, especially with the egg addition (you could poach or boil also). Great winter salad idea.

I made this with sweet potatoes and also substituted feta for Parmigiano & a tbsp of Dijon mustard and a slug of olive oil for the tahini. A little worried it would be too tart/salty, but it was delicious and got raves. I popped the kale and potatoes in the oven for about one minute after tossing them, which wilted them a bit more without being too much.

Rating: 4
I followed the suggestion of another reviewer (thanks for the tip!)and used unpeeled sweet potatoes. To my taste, the cheese could have been cut by a half and still have added the appropriate touch. The suggestion that the hot potatoes be tossed with the kale and covered with the hot pan helped to fully wilt the kale. I liked the dressing with extra lemon because I used meyer lemons. Lovely recipe and it was good for lunches during the week.

The first time I made this, I loved the flavors but didn't love the not-fully-wilted kale. For round two, I used chard instead of kale, and blanched and drained it very briefly before tossing with the potatoes, and it was great. I also used purple farmers market potatoes for a striking appearance. One of my favorite mid-week meals.

THE WHOLE FAMILY LOVED THIS! I used sweet potatoes instead of yukon golds, which was AMAZING. Also, I used baby kale, which was really nice and tender in this nearly-raw application. My husband said this one has to be moved into the regular rotation for a winter side dish.

This really does rate the 4 forks. To me it sounds as if it should be not very good, but in fact it's truly wonderful. The other reviewers' tip about wilting the kale in the oven is a good one. The dressing just makes this! Try it TODAY!!!

Dressing is amazing. Maybe broil potatoes for a min in the end to crisp. While the pan should have 4 sides, make sure it's a low baking sheet--not high like a brownie pan (the high walls make the potatoes steam--not brown). I recommend pouring potatoes into a bowl--and adding kale in batches and then tossing (I followed the recipe, and it felt like too much kale so I added in batches until it felt right). Kale is tougher than spinach and doesn't always immediately wilt. If this happens, put kale on the sheet and put it in the oven for a couple of mins.

This is our 5th time making this recipe and just find it to be an amazing use of kale. We prefer more potatoes to kale (perhaps 2 lbs to 1/4 pound), but we think this is probably personal preference. We also have chosen to blanch the kale for 2 mins and then shock in ice water, which seems to make the flavors meld a bit better. Any which way you make this dish you can't help but like it.

I made this with farmers market potatoes and kale - the kale was curly and tougher, end of the season kale. I thought it would be good, but not great. I did modify slightly, finding I needed more than 1/2 t of salt (I used slightly coarse sea salt) and I brightened the taste with some grated lemon rind. This would work up quickly for a main dish if you had prewashed kale. I will be making this again - and by the way - I think the cheese is not a necessary component!

Quick tip on "stripping" kale for axolotlart from winston salem, nc: grasp the stem at the top with one hand and wrap your other hand around the stem just below the other. Pull down with your lower hand (hold tight with the upper) and the leave will strip right off the stem - no knife required, and very quick.

A one dish wonder. Added leftover grilled chicken apple sausage and sauteed mushrooms, and thanks to suggestion from "A cook from Madison" in an earlier review, yogurt instead of tahini. Nicely balanced flavors and textures, a total keeper.

I always make this dish with the Spanish Crusted Roast Pork Tenderloin, also on this site, and the combination of the two recipes is perfect. I find it's easier to make the potatoes and the kale separately. I cook the potatoes ahead of time and reheat them in the oven just before serving. I wilt the kale in the microwave for about 15 or 20 seconds. Then I mix them together with the sauce. Delicious.

Rating: 4
Superb! I was very pleasantly surprised and will make it again, though it seems rather labor intensive to cut the ribs out of the kale.

I came across this recipe because it was recommended as a side to a main I was making and I couldn't have been more pleased - it was delicious! I ended up with leftover dressing so I was able to whip up a couple of small batches afterwards as well.

This recipe is on my regular rotation. I'm a rather huge fan of potatoes and they dress up very well with the Tahini. Kale itself is a bit on the bitter side, but this dish balances all the flavors very well. I suggest having this dish on a cold winter's night!

Loved this. I did pop it back in the oven after adding the kale to get it wilted a bit, it just took 2 minutes or so.

Rating: 0
This was delicious! I had all the ingredients except for the tahini. I used plain yogurt instead and it worked great. I piled the hot potatoes on top of the kale for a few minutes before mixing and I found that the kale did wilt just enough. I also waited to mix in the dressing until it had cooled down a bit. I will definitely make it again.

This is so simple and great. I never would have thought to do this. In the summer, the potatoes would be great to roast on the grill. So easy! The potatoes definitely took longer than 20 minutes, and I just put the chopped kale on top of the potatoes and closed the door of the oven to ensure wilting. YUMMY! Can't wait to have it for breakfast!

This was delicious and easy. I used sweet potatoes which added a nice sweet contrast to the tahini... I also used goat cheese and cooked the kale before mixing it with the potatoes. Perfection!

Rating: 4
Great recipe - always gets raves. As some of the others have mentioned, though, it's much better if the kale is cooked a bit as it doesn't actually wilt if you follow these directions as written. I toss the kale with the other veggies in the roasting pan for the last approx. 3 minutes of roasting and then following the rest of the instructions as directed...

Rating: 4
This was excellent. I had kale from my CSA box and didn't know what to do with it. I left out the tahini because I didn't have any. The lemon added enough of a kick that I didn't miss it. I also found that the kale did not wilt enough, so I put some of it back into the roasting pan that i had used for the potatoes (which still had some olive oil in it). After a couple of minutes in the oven, the kale was just right. I thought I would tolerate the kale in this dish just to get to the poatoes, but it was quite the opposite. I found the potatoes to be less interesting than the kale. Overall, this a great, healthy recipe.

This was excellent and simple. Just a few ingredients and most of the prep work can be done while the potatoes are in the oven. The kale was sweet (although only very slightly wilted) and the lemon was a great addition. I did cut the potatoes slightly smaller than required because I thought the bigger chunks weren't potato-salad-sized enough.

Rating: 4
great! used the framework of this recipe with about 1 lb of leftover roasted potatoes: heated the potatoes with some EVOO and some new garlic. then wilted the kale with some salt, then with medium heat and a bit of oil on a pan (that I was going to use to cook up pasta as another course anyways). otherwise made the dressing with an extra splash of water. DELICIOUS! and nutritious!

I have made this twice. The second time I doubled the dressing and added some thinly sliced and crispy fried roasted garlic and gruyere sausage to make it a meal. I didn't use all the dressing but saved some for the leftovers the next day as the potatoes absorb it all. This is delicious.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe twice. Both times I made it to accompany the Spanish Crusted Roast Pork Tenderloin, as Gourmet magazine recommended. The two go very well together, and make a complete meal. The one problem I had with this recipe the first time was that the kale didn't wilt when I tossed it with the potatoes, so I had hot potatoes and cold, stiff kale. The second time, I microwaved the kale first to soften it, and then mixed it with the potatoes. It was delicious, and distinctive.

Followed the recipe exactly and it worked perfectly, not mushy, not too dry. Served it as a vegetarian main course and the unusual flavors really hit home. This is my 4th kale recipe this fall and I'm wondering why it took me so long to discover this incredibly versatile veggie. Go kale!

This was a lot better than I thought. I found myself picking through the potatoes to find more Kale (I had thought it would have been the other way around). Easy to make (followed recipe exactly) and all flavors seemed to work well together.

A really tasty dish from simple ingredients. Make sure the sauce has a little body to it (add a little more tahini if runny) and it won't make your potatoes mushy. Slice the kale as thinly as possible, and also you can put the hot sheet pan on top of the bowl for a minute or two after dumping the potatoes into it to help wilt the kale. (Actually, I used a combination of kale and mustard greens.) I had serious doubts about this recipe, and it surprised me; the flavor combination is awesome. I'll definitely make it again.

I think I must have done something wrong after reading all the rave reviews for this dish. I really like the combination of roasted potatoes and kale but the tahini sauce (which was not too flavorfull) made the wonderfully crispy potatoes soggy and disappointing.

I used the kale we had in our garden, and it was Delicious! I did not have the Parmigiano-Reggiano, so I just use the cheese I had.

Really delicious. To the cook from Brooklyn, I served it with baked fish, since Middle-Easterners often serve fish sauced with the same dressing used for this salad. My kale wilted no problem just being tossed with the hot potatoes in their baking pan. Even my kids adored this one. My son chopped his fish up and stirred it into the salad. Great combo.

this recipe is great and always a big hit when I serve it. I found if you slice the kale very thinly, then salt it and let it sit as the potatoes roast, the Kale is perfectly wilted. Don't forget the extra squeeze of lemon at the end!

This is absolutely DELICIOUS! It's my new favorite, either as a side dish or as a main. The simple ingredient list (everything right out of my pantry except the kale) and super simple prep mean that I'll be making this all the time. Like other reviewers I let it cook a little more after adding the kale. I also use fewer potatoes and more kale/dressing/cheese. A huge hit!

Really enjoyed this recipe. Tossing the potatoes, garlic and oil right from the oven and still HOT into the (thinly sliced) kale made the kale wilt, no problem. Don't forget a squeeze of fresh lemon at your plate, really brightens the flavors.

This was really good. I already had the oven at 350 for something else, so I just made all the cooking steps a little longer to compensate and it was fine, although the potatoes probably would have been crispier at the higher temp. I put it back in the oven for about 5 minutes to help the kale wilt.

We really enjoyed this dish - I made it for Christmas Brunch. I have been serving roasted kale for years - just toss with oil, salt, and pepper and let it get just toasted in a high oven. Takes about 15 minutes. For this dish, I roasted the kale separately, so the steam from the kale wouldn't soften the potatoes.

Rating: 4
So delicious! I heeded the kale warnings and didn't use quite as much as called for and put it under the broiler for a bit to help it wilt. Otherwise, everything went according to plan and it brought rave reviews from my husband.

To the cook from Houston: Kale is much more than an ornamental cabbage, it is a nutrient laden and tasty vegetable. This preparation was really delicious, even the non-kale eaters in my family loved it. The key is to slice it very thin so that the heat from the potatoes will wilt it. If you want it a little more cooked, put the whole thing back in the oven as one reviewer suggested.

Rating: 4
After taking out the center ribs, you can roll the leaves up in a bundle, then slice very thin so you get super thin strips. If you do this, and you put the kale in right when the potatoes are out of the oven, the kale will wilt. However, because of other reviewer's comments, I popped it back in the oven for another 5 mins after mixing in the kale to be sure it was cooked. In any case, this was completely unusual and delicious. It also holds up well after being cooked. I'll definitely be making it again. I think you could do about 2/3 of the dressing and have it still be full of flavor, but slightly more healthy.

Rating: 4
This was surprisingly delicious - both interesting and satisfying, even for the non-vegetarian members of my family. The kale did not wilt much for me either, but that didn't detract from the overall dish. I will definitely make this again!

I made this with my cousin and it all came together easily. It was a huge hit our kale wilted no problem, just make sure to add the kale right away and do not add too much. We had it being almost 50 / 50 and even the children who do not eat kale ate and really enjoyed it. Everyone has seconds and it was a hit.

I disagree with the previous reviewer. I made this over Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. I did put it back under the broiler once the kale was added to help with wilting. Used the very little leftovers to make an impromptu frittata. Will add to my rotation.

Kale is an ornamental cabbage. It doesn't wilt to any degree in this preparation. The whole doesn't come together as one would want.
