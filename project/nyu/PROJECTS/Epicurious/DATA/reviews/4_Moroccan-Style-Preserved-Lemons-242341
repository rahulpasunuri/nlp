Not so curious, though it seems odd it ran just a year later. The recipe is the same, just written a little differently. The other calls for 6 lemons, and a cup of lemon juice (from 5-6 add'l lemons); this one calls for 10-12 lemons, using 6 for pickling and the others for a cup of lemon juice.

This is curious..This is the exact recipe from Gourmet 2007 on this website except it says 6 lemons. I have used the other one and its fantastic. i guess this one is less salty???

I have tried several recipes but this one turned out the best. Import to have the thinnest skinned lemons you can find. The best I found where Sunkist Florida Lemons or if you are lucky, Meyer Lemnons from Florida. The olive oil used in this recipe makes for an excellent air barrier ans since the oil floats, it stays that way as you pull lemons from the jar. This great if you do not have more lemon juice to fill up the jar.
