I really loved the chicken and tomato sauce, but found the onions to be a little disappointing. I'm certain that part of the problem is that I mis-read the directions and used too much oil, but I just thought the cinnamon was a little too strong. I might try again halving the amount.

YUM! Wanted something different to do with plain old chicken breasts, and this is a winner! I made smaller fillets of the chicken, and used a mix of jasmine rice/brown rice I had on hand - it was delicious! I used 2 cans of tomatoes, and thickened the sauce with potato flour at the end, which was perfect. The onions got rave reviews by all but one guest, who doesn't like sweet and savory together. Serving the onions on the side solved that issue. Love epicurious recipes!

The overall ingredients sound like a recipe for a tasty dish, but this is really lacking. The dish is very bland and has no fresh flavor. I tried to add some other ingredients to get rid of the bitter taste and it helped a little. The dish really needs garlic, sumac, harissa and some fresh figs. Having said that, it is better to start with a whole new recipe. Or, buy a frozen dinner...some may taste even better.

Wonderful blend of flavors. I'd cut down on the sugar and the oil to make it more healthful, though. What happened to the cilantro? B

The recipe took more time than I planned, but the cinnamon onions made it worth it. I've made the onion garnish repeatedly; they were especially good over pecan-crusted salmon fillets. Yum.

Disappointing. Something inthe gringer/paprika/cumin combination just left an off, metallic taste to the sauce. Husband liked the onions, but not enough to keep them as a leftover snack. Will look elsewhere for middle-east inspired chicken.

This was very tasty. It's similar to a tagine in flavor. Made as written except added a bit of crushed red pepper to the sauce for a little kick. My husband and I both wanted more sauce, so I will double the marinade and sauce ingredients next time. Will probably use chicken thighs next time instead of breasts. I always feel that dark meat absorbs marinades better than white meat. The cinnamon onions were incredible!

Delicious - easy to make, great flavors, and your house smells wonderful while it's baking.

This was even better than I expected. The cinnamon with the caramalized onions was very good.

Although it takes a while (well over an hour, but I was going through the directions carefully), this dish is easy enough for a beginner like me and is quite tasty! The ingredients are all easy to find, and no equipment more complex than a food processor needed. A terrific dish, but either make parts ahead of time or allow for a lot of prep.

I had high hopes for this dish but it was a complete disappointment -- a fair bit of work for little return. The sauce was good but the chicken was flavorless, and the onions were just weird. I've tried several disappointing Middle Eastern recipes on Epicurious, so I think I'll just start looking elsewhere for those.

Very tasty - but rather labor intensive for a weeknight supper. Would make again though!

Excellent dish - wonderful melding of flavors. My oldest daughter raved about the cinnamon onions and would have spread them on bread had I allowed it! As a side dish, I stuffed some zucchinis with veggies and pine nuts. Very nice meal!

This was an excellent meal - I served it to friends and they raved about it! Can't wait to make it for more of my friends!!!

Excellent. Make sure you make the onions saucy as they will boil down.

A good recipe but I have only word or caution - do not use the same pan you browned onions in to cook chicken. I ended up with tons of small crunchy burnt bits of sugar when I seared the chicken. My own stupid fault I know but good to know. Also I would add a foil to the sweetness of teh dish. Next time I think I will add either some red chili powder for spice or some Greek or Italian green olives. It really needs soemthing to contrast the sweetness of the overall dish.

This recipe is delish! I made it the second time around with basmati rice as my husband is not a big fan of couscous. Added the cinnamon onions to the rest of the sauce too- made the flavours more complex.

I loved this dish! If you like the taste of sweetened carmelized onions with cinnamon you will like this dish. It adds to the whole dish. The diced tomatoes also make the dish quite tasty.

While the cinnamon onions were interesting, the tomato sauce was only adequate. The entire dish failed to exicte and, thanks to the raw onion marinade, we breathed onion fumes for days afterwards. What a disappointment, after the other rave reviews!

I followed the recipe closely, only substituting fresh ginger, since I had it. This cinnamon lover's dish is spicer than I expected -- but easy enough for a weeknight and different enough for dinner with friends. You can make about half the recipe ahead of time. Next time, I think I'll make it with brown rice instead of couscous.

My family is not a big fan of onions. When i made this dish with the cinnamon onions, they didn't even know that they were onions to begin with. The chicken was perfectly cooked, the onions made the dish! Excellent recipe. I would definitly make it agian in the future.

The carmelized onions really make this dish! The aroma is wonderful and tastes great with couscous. I did not have any cilantro on hand so I'm not sure if this would have helped the sauce any. Very good dish and fairly easy to prepare!
