Great recipe to make for a party--easy (I made the skewers in advance), festive, and crowd pleasing.

This was OK. It is hard to get the fresh pineapple grilled nicely without turning the shrimp to rubber.

I love this recipe and make it frequently for guests. You can get the sugar cane swizzle sticks at www.HulaGirlFoods.com. Delicious!
