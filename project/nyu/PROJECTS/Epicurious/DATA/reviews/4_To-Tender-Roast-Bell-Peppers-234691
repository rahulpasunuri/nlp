Place roasted peppers in plastic bag and seal. Peal skin away from pepper under cold water faucet. If peppers are sufficently roasted, skin will rub right off.

Easy and not very messy! I gave three forks because I suspect that charring the peppers over a BBQ or open flame probably gives them a more smokey flavor. But this way works so well and is so convenient I'll probably never do it any other way!

A very easy and tasty recipe. Perfect for red, orange and yellow sweet peppers.

Yes, I have tried many ways and this is the best. I put a layer of parchment paper in the pan because the peppers can really make a messy pan that's hard to clean, but the paper makes it a breeze!

This is the first recipe I have tried for roasting red peppers that actually worked and was easy. And no messy barbecue!
