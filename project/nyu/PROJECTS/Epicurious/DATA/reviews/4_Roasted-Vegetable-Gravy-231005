Just finished making the roasted vegetable stock and I'm super impressed with the rich flavor and texture. Our guest requires gluten free food, so I'll finish the gravy using corn starch instead of flour.

I love this gravy! I have made this stock and gravy for the past five years; one batch split in half gives me enough for both Thanksgiving and Christmas (small to medium gatherings). I'm a veggie, but my carnivore family and friends like it too.

My oldest sister is vegetarian and she loves when I make this for her and now makes it for her friends. It has really great depth of flavor. Please make the homemade stock as well, it's slightly time consuming, but easy work that can be done in advance. I like that I can make her something special so she doesn't miss the meat on Thanksgiving and other holidays.

Since I was just making enough gravy for five but liked the idea of reserving broth for soup, I added parsnips and a couple more carrots than the recipe called for, and added more water to make the stock too. For the gravy, I used about two cups of liquid but 3 T flour to help it thicken. I suggest you factor in your diners' gravy needs before using all your stock to make the gravy or make extra stock. Yum!

I'm making this gravy as a tester for Thanksgiving. Neither my sister nor I eat much meat at all and I thought it would be nice to have an alternative to meat-based gravy on the table. Planning on making a cornbread dressing, too. Does any one know if this works well with dressing(stuffing)?

Insipid. Reading the reviews, I was expecting something much more special. It's OK, but there isn't anything particularly exceptional - it tastes like lots of other vegetarian gravies that I've made before.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe, and it made perfect gravy. I didn't have time to make the stock so I purchased it - based on the reviews, I'll be making the veggie stock next time!

I had a mix of vegetarian and carnivorous folks at the table for Thanksgiving. The veggies loved the dressing and really appreciated the fact that I went to the extra trouble, which was minimal.

Great tasting sauce, but I wouldn't call it a 'gravy'. It's actually an amazing dipping sauce with bread and some goat cheese. Also, the stock is quite a bit of work and time consuming. Worth the effort, but really only if you double the recipe so at least you have double the stock to work with.

OUTSTANDING!!! Hands down, this is the best gravy I have ever made or eaten. The vegetable stock is time consuming, but makes the gravy prep a snap. Out of a gravy making habit, I added the butter first and then made a thickener of the flour and water that I stirred in slowly. I then continued to cook on low heat for about 15 minutes until the gravy was nice and thick. This will be a Thanksgiving tradition from now on.

Awesome recipe! My husband and I are vegetarian and have been looking for a good veggie gravy forever. This gravy is more than good...it made Thanksgiving dinner!

Hands down the best gravy recipe ever. No one touched the turkey gravy after tasting this one.

The stock for this recipe is a bit labor intensive, but it is amazing! I have used it for other recipes as well. I have found that this gravy is a bit thin - I will remeber to use extra flour or cornstarch next time. However, it tastes great. I make it for myself to take to our family Thanksgiving because I am a vegetarian and I want gravy for my potatoes, etc! Many of my family members try the gravy, and they always like it, too. Sometimes they have mine instead of the regular meat gravy!

This gravy makes a nice accompaniment to anything. It's so rich & flavorful without all the bother of using pan juices and animal fat.

This is now the only gravy I will make as it goes well with poultry or meats. The secret is in the roasting and don't skimp on this step. It is the caramelized vegetables that make this so superior to your average vegetable stock recipe. I have used it for the last two Thanksgivings, making it a couple of days ahead and slowly warming it over a low heat or in the microwave. Make extra of the stock and keep it in your freezer. It is a great base of soups.
