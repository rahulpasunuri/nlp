This will be the fourth Christmas I have made this oustanding and simple salad for our family dinner. It is refreshing, beautifully complements the main dishes on your holiday table, doesn't get limp or soggy like a lettuce-based salad, and uses easy-to-find ingredients that are in season in the winter. Five forks for sure!

This was a wonderful, easy recipe. Tasted great and looked beautiful! The different textures were fantastic. I used clementines as someone else had suggested and plated everything on a crisp white square platter. I also garnished with the mint leaves in the center. (flower pattern)

I just remembered that I added something to the recipe, balsamic vinegar. I didn't measure, but probably about a tablespoon to the syrup. I also would use less water when cooking the cranberries. I would have preferred the syrup less diluted when poured over the orange slices.

I just made this recipe yesterday for a barbeque we were invited to. People were still raving about it when we packed up to leave. I made a double recipe on a large flat platter, and people kept going back for more till it was all gone. I was asked many times what it was called, what the spice was, where did I get the recipe. Comments were made about the beautiful presentation, and one person said, "I can't stop eating this." It looks gorgeous on the plate, tastes fabulous on the palate, and is very easy to make. People were also speculating about how it would taste with other fruits, like pineapple and even apples. I think I would lightly cook apples if I used them. Fabulous recipe. Make with confidence that it will get rave reviews.

This is such a simple show-stopper. It is perfect for winter entertaining - it looks great on the table and tastes even better. I didn't make any changes to the recipe.

this is actually a little unfair as a review, because i jut made the walnuts for a separate recipe - baby greens salad with dried cranberries, blue cheese crumbles and walnuts with balsamic vinaigrette - but couldn't resist saying how excellent the walnuts turned out. I baked for half of the time, then switched out the parchment paper - removing the sticky piece, and putting the walnuts on the clean paper for the remainder of the time, and they were really crispy and perfect for the salad. definitely a keeper.

Absolutely love this- I made it one year for Christmas morning and I haven't stopped since. Very refreshing and a nice change from standard fruit salad offered at any brunch. Be careful to cook the walnuts very well drained as another poster said- they really need to crunch! I usually use pecans instead- I just prefer them over walnuts.

This recipe is simplicity at its finest! What an outstanding, flavorful, and beautifully colorful dish--the perfect addition to any holiday (or other!) table! If I made this recipe again, though, I would just toast the walnuts, rather than coating then in the honey and spices (so I'd just add the honey and spices directly to the cranberry mixture). It seemed that the honey/spice mixture didn't adhere all that well to the nuts anyway, and you'd pick up the flavor of the spices, etc. in the cranberry mixture--it would just eliminate one step and make this recipe even easier! Also, instead of allspice (which was mysteriously missing from my spice rack), I used a blend of cardamom, coriander, and cinnamon--divine.

A refreshing addition to a Thanksgiving feast! I cut the time for roasting the nuts (14-15 min.) It's easy to burn them so watch carefully. Otherwise, so easy and so delicious!

Fantastic contrasting crunch. I used clementines instead of regular oranges.

This is a fabulous salad to lighten and sharpen up a stodgy main. I served it last night with tourtiere and it was terrific.

Beautiful and delicious salad for any time of year. As others have said, a perfect complement to a heavy main dish. I served this with the Braised Lamb Shanks with Fennel, Star Anise and Port and the Gorgonzola Polenta from this site - a super-rich combination. This salad was a refreshing, colorful counterpoint that married perfectly with the flavors in the lamb. Make the walnuts and cranberries a day in advance if you're entertaining.

This was outstanding. It got rave reviews from the moment it hit the table. The interplay between sweet, tart and the mild spice of the walnuts is wonderful.

made this to complement a heavy main course and it was very refreshing and delicious. it's pleasing to the eye and the tastebuds--the colors all together are gorgeous, plus i added baby spinach like the other reviewers recommended and it was so beautiful in the dish! the oranges are a really nice burst of flavor and the nuts add a great crunch and flavor. i topped the greens with the parmesan balsamic vinaigrette from this site, delicious! never knew dressing was so easy to make. we made this for valentines but it would be great at any time of year.

I served this over a bed of baby spinach. It was really wonderful as a starter to our Thanksgiving meal. 2 people didn't take some because 1 didn't like spinach and the other didn't want fruit salad and was expecting something Caesar-ish. But for those who took, the compliments were immense. And the best part of all - no oil - no fat. The perfect starter for MY Thankgsgiving meal

marvellous: a brightly flavored, unusual and thoroughly sensuous dish. I served this as a plated side salad in a multi-course meal, arranging it on top of baby arugula and stretching it to 20 people. I burned the nuts the first time and had to prepare them again: when I make this again, I will be careful to drain off as much syrup as possible before spreading the nuts on the baking sheet, and will probably bake them a little longer at a lower temperature.

I am planning on serving this for brunch next week with the egg, cheese, artichoke strata. I made the salad today to try it out before we have our company next week. We ate a serving before it had cooled, and it was delicious. I will let it cool though when I make it for brunch next week. My husband especially liked it, and it is so colorful. A very pretty dish!

Very good salad. I added gorgonzola cheese and did not soak the cranberries in the dressing but added them to the top of the salad before serving. I used the juice from the cranberry-soaking for the dressing. will definitely make again.

This salad made a beautiful and delicious contribution to our Christmas buffet. The citrus provided a refreshing complement to all the other dishes. However, instead of putting the cranberries on top, I mixed them in with the oranges and just made a ring with the walnuts on the top. Then I garnished it with mint sprigs. Really pretty and so, so good!

Nice salad for a holiday meal.

This salad is easy to prepare, can be made in advance and assembled before serving. It looks so beautiful and is delicious. I did add a tablespoon or so of raspberry vinegar to the dressing as I wanted a bit more tartness. I also sprinkled a few crushed red pepper flakes on the orange slices as a like the contrast of the tastes. This is a keeper!
