dressing was delicious, though used only roasted beets for the salad. Will try again with beets, radicchio and julienned carrots

The dressing is wonderful! Can be used for many different things, but what makes it best is the color when it has been seeping in the beets for a while!

I found the orange/anise flavors to be totally uncomplimentary to the cauliflower. I made it based on others comments and neither the spouse nor the couple I had over for dinner touched it after the first bite. I fed it to the chickens.

The jury is still out on this one. It was very easy to make and pretty to look at, but I tired of this salad after a few bites. The dressing was strange--really tasty, and at the same time, completely overbearing. I might fix again when beets come around next season just to see if I've changed my mind.

This worked well to clean out my fridge and turned out quite tasty. I used fennel instead of anise and didn't do the straining bit. The dressing is very heavy on the oil, and even with half the dressing, I found it oily. Good though.

marvelous....we love cauliflower and all those "ciferious" veggies...this is heavenly....i will fix it for dinner tonight with the mac and cheese! we eat heart healthy....even the mac and cheese, less than 3 grams...long live veggies and we are not vegetarians! the produce dept. is our favorite dept! we enjoy re-doing recipes, but all of yours leave very little room for improvement. thank you from the bottom of our healthy hearts!
