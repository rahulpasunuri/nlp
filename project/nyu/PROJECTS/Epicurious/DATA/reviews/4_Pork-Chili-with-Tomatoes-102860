This is great chili with an alternative meat. As another reviewer suggested I did use the adobe sauce and even rolled pancetta chips (not bacon) in the left over sauce for a zesty kick,

Fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly, but did add a can of hominy, That is the only change made and it is wonderful. Garnished with lime, radish, cilantro, and scallions. Served warm corn tortillas on the side and my guests swooned!

This was a really delicious recipe. I followed it as written except: used pork roast, only had 2.6 lbs poblanos, substituted 2 cups tomatillo salsa for part of the chicken stock, added an extra Tbsp each oregano and cumin, added a sprinkling of red pepper flakes, Tony Chachere's seasoning, and 4 minced pickled jalapenos (my stomach won't tolerate the fresh ones.) It won our annual neighborhood chili cook-off tonight - and I'm sad, because that means I don't have any left. Going to make it again immediately.

Great great chili. Labor intensive for me. Used 2 jalapenos, 2 anaheims in addition to the poblanos. Probably 3* on the heat scale (out of 5). Served with corn tortillas, excellent. Would use some tomatillos and/or hominy next time to thicken. Best chili ever.

This was a great recipe. I only had dried pasilla chillies on hand, so I just added boiling water and reconstituted them. I then cooked them as the recipe directed. I also had black beans pre-soaked, so I added a few cups and used less meat. I love all the reviews with the changes folks make! In a pinch, when I am missing an ingredient, I always read the reviews-who knows who had the same problem before you.

Delicious. I didn't have quite so many poblano peppers on hand, so I rounded the chili out with a couple of finely diced japalenos and dried ancho chilies that I first reconstituted in some hot water and chopped up. The more time this simmers on the stove, the better.

Cook from Northern VA - I'm sorry but I have to disagree and most recipes on this site have reviews from people who have changed up the recipe somewhat. Many of the best recipes I've tried on here were because I took the advice in the reviews and made some modifications. Even if everyone followed the recipe verbatim, it doesn't mean it would always turn out the same. Thats why cooking is both art and science.

Delicious! Very filling and hearty! I added the Tomatillo (as others suggested) after it cooked for about an hour. Definitely making it again!

delish, and easy. Used a cheap cut of pork, let it cook and yum, yum. This would be a good candidate for a crock pot dinner.

Excellent recepie. Just about any cut of bone-in pork with a lot of marbling can work here. I threw in some fresh yellow tomatoes, because they are yummy and they were just gonna go bad, and hominy is a nice option for a bit of texture. I garnished it with some sour cream, fried tortilla strips, and a squeeze from a nice lime wedge to brighten the dish.

Haven't actually made it, but made something similar last week. Not to sound like a downer, but I never understand why people write in these long reviews that basically describe how they changed up the entire recipe! I understand a few changes here and there, but please don't review the recipe if you essentially haven't followed it. I'm all for doing my own thing and not following recipes all the time, but if I want to read a recipe review, I want it to be of the posted recipe in its entirety!

I halved this recipe and my husband didn't want to eat anything else for a week! It took a while to make but it was completely worth it. Very tasty.

I took this to a chili cookoff at work today and got second place - lost by one vote. The rave reviews were well worth the effort and I will definitely make it again. I halved the recipe and used a boneless pork loin instead of a pork butt since thats what I had in the freezer. I also used 4 Poblanos, 2 Anaheims and threw in a fresh jalapeno diced really small once it was done cooking. I also added a half jar of Frontera tomatillo medium salsa towards the end too attempting to give it more of a green flavor. I wanted to put hominy in it but couldn't find any at the store last night. I also served it with freshly grated white queso cheese, green onions, cilantro and sour cream. Would be good with avocados and lime wedges as well.

This has become a family favorite - replacing Texas "bowl o' red". Served it to out of town guests during the week of my daughter's wedding to rave reviews. It freezes beautifully. When reheating, I add a couple cans of yellow posole (hominy), and serve with fresh cilantro, sour cream and avacodos. This is a great recipe!

Excellent. A very flavorful green chili. I halved the recipe and added 2T. of chili powder. It is not spicy, so next time I'll add an jalepeno or two.

I normally make red chili and wanted to try a green chili for variety's sake. I tried this recipe and just loved it. It's easier to make than my favorite Texas red and tastes just as good. I used 1 lb (approx 10) poblano peppers and one (1/2 lb) cubanelle pepper, and for the pork I used boneless pork loin (or "country ribs" depending on where you live.) Wonderful flavor, tender meat and just the right amount of heat. When (not if) I make this again I'm going to try replacing maybe 20% of the chicken stock with liquefied tomatillos.

This chili was fabulous. Served it with rice and sides of sour cream, cilantro and jack cheese. Will definitely make again soon. I also substituted pork tenderloin instead of the pork butt, and it came out very tender.

I made this last weekend and am already craving it again. I made 1/2 recipe exactly as written except I did toast whole cumin seed and grind it. With the leftovers I added some crushed tortilla chips to thicken it up a bit while reheating so I could use it as a burrito filling and that was great too. Freezes very well. This will be a regular on my menu.

This is an excellent recipe. If the proportions are followed, this makes enough to serve a small army. I've made this recipe 4 times. It's labor intensive but well worth the work. My one piece of advice- poblanos sometimes vary in heat level. I recommend monitoring the level of spice and not simply going by the 3 lb. recommendation stated in the recipe.

Made a double batch of this for an outdoor graduation party. It was more work than I was used to in preparing the peppers and 14 pounds of meat, but I've never received so many compliments. Will make this again many, many times.

A completely different kind of chili! Very delicious. I added double the tomatoes. Next time I'll definately put in some celery and green peppers. It needed some more vegetables in my opinion.

With 5 small children in the home I am always looking for ways to use leftovers and substitutions from my pantry. This was perfect for that! I halfed this recipe and used 3 lbs. of leftover barbecued pork loin that I had slow cooked in the crock pot. I cubed it into small bites and threw it in after I had made the base. I cooked 3 cups of vidalia onions (after finely chopping because the kids are always complaining about onions!) in about 1 Tablespoon of pork fat from my freezer. I roasted 7 garlic cloves and chopped with the onions. Didn't have time to go to the store so I used 1 lb. chopped green chilies from my pantry, a can of rotel tomatoes, one fresh tomato, ground cumin, and dried oregano (that I toasted a bit) and canned chicken broth. Served it in bowls with guacamole, cilantro, and shredded monterey jack cheese. I know this is less than "gourmet" and not as good as it could be as directed, but it worked great for my busy family, and the kids loved it! I will use the leftovers to make enchiladas. 3 dishes out of one pork loin! And I didn't even have to make a run for the store! I love that.

Wow, this was amazing! Halved the recipe, but used 10 cloves of garlic and roasted 8 poblanos, 2 anaheims and 1 habenero pepper. It was spicy, but the flavor was out of this world (I followed the suggestion to toast whole cumin seeds and then grind them, excellent!), it was not a bowl of pain. My mother (who claims to hate garlic and spicy food) said it was excellent and had 2 bowls, and her sinuses are clear now. Also, used boneless butterfly chops and cubed them, just had to cook it an extra hour or so for the meat to be oh so tender. Perfect food for a cool evening.

This is the third time for this dish. It's a great party dish, served with rice or tortillas and a green salad. I prefer to cut the calorie count by using cubed pork tenderloin instead of shoulder and slow cook it longer until it falls apart. We double the recipe and serve it in crock pots so it stays hot for the evening. Excellent taste.

Awsome chili, the roasted pepers make it great. I used anahiem and poblano peppers. I also roasted the garlic. Will defenately keep this recipe.

I didn't mess with this recipe much, which is unusual for me. The only things I changed were that I used toasted cumin seeds instead of ground, then ground them with the toasted oregano in a mortar, since pre-ground cumin loses a lot of flavor. I also used half fresh tomatoes because I had a lot of beautiful roma tomatoes already getting too ripe. I make a lot of Mexican food and though this doesn't seem to correspond to any dish I've ever heard of, it has all the authentic ingredients. Certainly beats any Tex-Mex "Chili" out there. I added cubed chayote during the last 40 minutes of the cooking time so that I'd have another veggie in the stew and then served it over Mexican "arroz dorado". Delicious!

Great flavors! My kids loved it although I had to omit some pasillas (a little too spicy for little ones). A great party dish. Perfect for the cold weather coming up.

I made this Chili for 25 coworkers on Superbowl Sunday. Used a whole pork shoulder, well trimmed to reduce the fat somewhat. Also added 1 roasted red pepper, 3 roasted italian frying peppers & 3 roasted jalapenos, all stemmed, seeded & diced for variety. Served it with white rice, chopped scallion and grated cheddar. The raves just keep coming!

My husband and I really enjoyed this chili, but found it to be a bit too fatty. I would probably trim the pork butt a bit more next time and add one more roasted poblano. The flavor was wonderful.
