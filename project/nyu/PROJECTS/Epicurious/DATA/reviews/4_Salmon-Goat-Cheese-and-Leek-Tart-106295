We made the recipe a little more family friendly and affordable by using fetta cheese instead of goat cheese and canned pink salmon in place of smoked salmon. It may not have been as indulgent but it was yummy, the whole family loved it and we can afford to make it regularly :)

From all the raves, I was so excited about this tart. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations and wasn't worth all the effort. I most of the ingredients on hand and was looking for something to make with my farmers' market leeks. This tart is very rich and I think the goat cheese is very overpowering for the delicate flavors of both the salmon and the herbed cheese. I much preferred the plainer leek and swiss chard tart here. This one was just too rich.

While I normally would reserve the phrase "a dish beyond compare" for something with lobster or filet, this tart deserves four forks. I have made it many times since it first appeared in March 2002 -- for brunch, first course or casual dinner -- and it's terrific every time. I use at least 6 oz. of smoked salmon, but otherwise don't change a thing. It also freezes and reheats beautifully.

First bite was OK but the salmon became overwhelming very quickly. Nobody ate more than half of their portion.

Love this, have made several times, always a hit. I have made in a rectangle shaped tart pan as well, and cut into smaller squares, to serve as appetizer.

I've made this twice for a buffet, and both times it was GONE! Although the recipe puff pastry quantity calls for the specific size that Pepperidge Farms sells as puff pastry, it is worth finding the real thing made with butter (Dufour, for example) since PF uses hydrogenated vegetable fats (these don't belong in puff pastry!) I couldn't find boursin or rondele, so I substituted herbed goat cheese the second time. It was a little stronger, but the guests didn't seem to mind. A very simple but impressive tart!

Guests loved this for a spring baby shower. Very rich and creamy, made a second time without the Boursin cheese and it was just as good. Best to make ahead let flavours meld a bit before serving. Freezes well.

This tart is incredible. I made it last weekend for a crowd & it was a hit. The longer it sits, the better it is. Needs to cool before serving though. I'll leave out the whipping cream next time, it just adds calories & I'm sure it wouldn't be missed.

served this with a green salad as a first course last night at a dinner party -- everyone raved! guests took slices home to eat for breakfast the next day (my husband had it for breakfast too.) the only change I made was making my own crust -- I think it probably worked better for the dish than puff pastry.

Wonderful combo, VERY rich. I made my own crust, just because...Otherwise followed recipe. Made a caper vinaigrette for some greens to serve. Make sure to let this come to room temp or just under...mine was too cold straight out of the cooler!

I really like this dish! So far, I made this dish twice - once following the recipe (really good but very rich, I agree), and second, trying to make it lighter by using just the boursin and fat free cream cheese (which I was wary of but it also turned out very good and kept its consistency). I also subsituted leeks for onions the second time, too. But I love this dish and will make it again.

this is a wonderful starter! it is a bit rich as a meal unto itself, but a sliver of this with a green salad is divine. i've made it for several dinner parties and all my guests have loved it!

What a find! This is surprisingly easy to make and tastes fantastic. A classy, elegant dish, this will be my new standard holiday party hostess gift. Really, for the small amount of work involved, this is an extraordinary tart.

a real winner! I have made it over and over again and our guests always enjoy it.

OK, so it looked delicious and tasted nice if not a way bit too rich, but it was definitely too rich for my stomach cos I was throwing up non-stop for the next half and hour. I know it's disgusting but you have to agree that two packs of boursin + goat cheese + cream cheese + whipping cream + salmon (which in itself is strong food) do actually sound (and to me they felt) like WAY TOO MUCH...

Wow! Absolutely sublime. We used left over fresh smoked river salmon from a recent barbecue and the results were awesome. Excellent warm or room temp. Following another reviewers suggestion I beat the cheeses in the kitchen aid, but did add the leek/cream mixture by hand. To the reviewer who mentioned the dish did not set up, not enough reduction in the cream/leek mixture may be the culprit. It does reduce down to just short of dry.

I found that the puff pastry puffed so much even after pricking with a fork and baking w/ weights, that i ran out of room for all the filling. I put the leftover filling in a ramekin and stuck it in the oven while the tart baked - delicious! The tart was delicious. I did however think that serving 10-12 was unlikely. More like 6-9 MAX.

Delicious - when I served it as a dip after the center refused to set but what could I have done wrong? I got all the ingredients exactly as specified... I gave it a 3 (unfair but there it is) only because I screwed it up somehow.

Absolutely fabulous! I love recipes that come out just as you expect and this one does. I used a frozen pie crust to save time and it was great, though I bet the puff pastry is even better. I couldn't stop eating it!

This is a delicious tart, a perfect meal with a green salad. I don't like Boursin, so I added a handful of fresh herbs to the leeks and increased the cream and goat cheeses. As the restaurant serves the recipe with a red pepper sauce, I also added 2 tablespoons of Adjvar, a Bulgarian red pepper spread, which added a nice touch of sweetness. I also arranged julienne of smoked salmon across the top, which looked nice when baked.

Wow. I made this for a baby shower brunch that I catered and it was a smash - even with people who wouldn't ordinarily know the difference between a leek and a leech. Be sure to use a lot of weight (i.e. beans) when blind baking the puff pastry as it has a tendency to, well, puff. Moreover, the sides on the pastry shrunk down considerably after blind baking. I was afraid that the filling would run out over the shrunken sides, but was pleased to see that everything stayed in place. I found it difficult to mix the cheeses and herbs manually, so I threw them into my Kitchen Aide. Worked out wonderfully.

I also used served this at a wine tasting party and it went over great! As another rater suggested, I also used pre-made frozen tarts (Athens) and baked for 10 minutes which made this real easy to cook and serve. Perfect bize size for a party. I made the "batter" the day before and brought to room temperature before I baked. These even taste great at room temperature so don't worry about serving hot.

YES YES YES!!! This dish is super-fantastic!!! We loved this. I added a little marscapone in the pan while sauteeing the leeks (no particular reason, I just had it on hand and needed to finish it). Also, I added some spinach in there because it just sounded right. I also bought pre-made tart crusts to save time. I will definitely make this delicious recipe again!

This is one of my favorite dishes from one of my favorite Bistros. Bistro Banlieue serves the tart with a a sweet red bell pepper sauce-yummy!

This was fabulous! We served it at a wine-tasting party and everyone loved it. One friend calls it "salmon cheesecake" and begged for more. It's a keeper and a showstopper. Great idea to serve as the main course with salad for a bridal or baby shower luncheon--it can all be done ahead of time.

This was extremely good. It was an extra special treat at the party it was served at. I used extra goat and spreadable cheese in my recipe and had enough of the filling left over from my tart for the mini puff pastries that I had bought at the little gourmet store near our house. The little mini bite size (which I only cooked for 16 minutes) tarts were better than the big one! this recipe was definitely a keeper.

This is tops, it tasted even better than it looked on the paper. I did it for a lunch on a Boat and people nearly fainted when they tried it. A green salad was all it needed for a bit of freshness in the heat of summer.

This was such a hit with my family! I suppose you could tell that this tart is a success just by looking at the ingredients. Just don't be tempted to add salt because there is a suffiecient amount of that from all the cheese. I also cooked mine in a springform pan and it turned out fine.
