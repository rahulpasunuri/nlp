My family thought this recipe was too strong with the onions. I'd probably try 1 cup next time. Will also try mix of shallots and onions as other reviewers have suggested. I did not try to use shredder. Just cut the corn off the ears and put in food processor. Worked great!

What a hit for Thanksgiving! I used sweet corn and just mashed with a heavy ladle once I took off the cob. I only made a half recipe and threw it in a vintage casserole, and it came out beautifully (cook time was just a little shorter). Will be on the holiday menu for a long time to come.

I followed the recipe directly and it looked pretty much like the photograph. But I wasn't a fan of corn pudding to start with and this did not convert me. I won't make this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it might have been everyone's favorite side. Instead of sour cream I used Greek yogurt for some added nutrition, and it worked really well. Also, I used 2 bags of frozen corn, (instead of fresh), put through the food processor (ok, it was a magic bullet...).

I grew up eating creamed corn out of the can. As an adult, I came to realize this was not really the greatest thing for me, and never bought a can. When I came across this recipe I thought "just this once, for the sake of memories..." and decided to make. It was incredibly easy to make, and EVERYONE loved it. I've made this 3 times and it's been the standout dish every time. Great side for Thanksgiving!

I have made this recipe two years in a row now for Thanksgiving and always get complimented. It is always a hit. Will continue to make. The first year, I made the full batch and the liquid wouldn't evaporate. The second year I made a half batch and it worked out much better.

the only reason I give this 3 forks instead of 4 is because I (ME ME ME) burned the bottom of the pan as I was rewarming this dish. I'm so glad I did the extra work to grate all the corn myself. It was sweet and delicious, a beautiful foil for the brined deep fried turkey. I ended up serving the pudding in chunks on a platter, avoiding the burnt section. woo! close save and well worth it!

Made it for thanksgiving with the shallots and frozen corn it was great! I cooked mine in a pampered chef stoneware dutch oven thing and it worked great. Definitely going into rotation. I am making it again this weekend for a friend half way to thanksgiving meal looking forward to being able to try it with fresh corn this time. I was wondering if anyone has made it in a normal glass or ceramic casserole dish. Also was thinking of adding some leeks...any thoughts?

It was very good! I used creamed corn that we put up this summer. I will definitely make this again, but next time I would dice or mince the onions and celery. I also would advise using the mixer to whip those eggs (both yolks and whites) as a time saving method.

I made this for thanksgiving following another users advice to use good frozen corn since fresh corn was not available in my area (just defrost and pulse in a food processor). I also used 1 cup onions and 1 cup chopped shallots. Other than that this was very easy to make and got rave reviews

First of all, I used 15 ears of corn and still did not get the full amount of milky pulp called for. Second, the amount of salt here is entirely too much. I found the dish to be entirely too salty and next time would add maybe half the amount of salt. Or less. If you do not like overly salted food please heed my advice. Next time I will not make the same mistake.

This dish got great reviews at our Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone wanted the recipe! I used shallots in addition to the onions & agree that it added depth to the dish. Next time I'll cut the kernels off with a knife & place them in a food processor; it was just too messy to grate. I had to put the bowl at the bottom of my sink to keep the kernels from spraying the entire kitchen. I prefer fresh corn, since in my experience, frozen is just never sweet enough for me.

Followed the idea of using frozen corn - the southern girls at our dinner loved it.

Wanted to add... Don't bother grating fresh corn. Not only is it difficult to find this time of year, but it's quite time consuming. Instead, I threw about 4 cups (I medium bag) of thawed frozen corn into the food processor and pulsed it until it reached the same consistency described in the recipe.

Great addition to a holiday dinner. Made this for our early Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Be careful with the salt as the amount in the recipe is already on the borderline of being too much. The addition of some herbs might be a nice touch. Do note, this dish does NOT reheat well. It loses its bread-like consistency and becomes mushy.

Very good; however, I prefer the Sweet Corn Pudding recipe on this site more. This recipe is nice for those who prefer a more savory corn pudding and agree that addition of shallots, etc would add more complexity and interest to it.

Everyone I served this for loved it! It had great flavor and texture. I agree with the previous post that I may experiment next time and add green chiles or subsitute shallots for the onions to give it a richer taste. But following the recipe as is returned great results. Definitly heat the butter in the cast iron skillet before adding the pudding...it resulted in a nice crust. Will def make again.

Good but not great. Good for a nice alternative T-Giving side. My veg daughter loved it. I'm leaning towards experimenting by making this a more southwestern flavored side with chiles, cumin, maybe some fire roasted tomato (diced). ??
