I made this for a dinner party. It was quick, easy and a winner. Served it with ice cream. Everyone ate it up!

The lemon juice is only used to prevent the sugar from crystalizing- the bananas will not turn brown if it's left out. I added a bit of cream before adding the bananas (1/4c.) to make sure it didn't harden against the cold yogurt

I couldn't get over how delicious these bananas were. I have always been afraid to make my own caramel but it's so easy and it turned out yummy. I would have given this recipe 4 forks but I too thought there was too much lemon juice called for, I would definitely halve the amount. I served it with macadamia nut brittle ice cream, the perfect compliment to such a wonderful dessert.

I think you might have a) had wet bananas and b) let the sugar get too browned or c) been cooking in too shallow a saucepan. I could see if the sugar was super-hot and the bananas touched the bottom of the pan the sugar in the bananas could start to burn and set syrup to burn too, even though it might not actually look much darker; resulting in that carcinogenic taste. My suggestion would be using a deeper pan, making sure your bananas are dry (use a paper towel) and removing the caramel mixture from the heat just before it's as dark as you'd like it to be. It will keep cooking. Once it's the appropriate color but before it has started to harden at all, gently slip the bananas in. Good luck.

I made the banana part of it twice and it came out tasting like poison both times...any suggestions about what i did wrong? The first time I obviously burned the sugar mixture which was a disaster...tasted like poison. The next time i was extremely careful, the sugar mixture looked good, i took it off the heat, and added the bananas right away (which im thinking might have been the problem because as soon as i did the mixture started smoking). The carmel came out really thick and terrible...it tasted carcinogenic (as my mom put it) both times!

Sinful~ but without the calories you would think!!! I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on the bottom of the bowls before serving the bananas; the effect was wonderful! Make sure your guests are ready to eat, because it melts quickly. This was a perfect end to an all-epicurean meal... Fiery Skewered Shrimp, Grilled Corn on the Cob, and Grilled New Potatoes with Parmesan and Herbs!

This is no substitute for banana's foster. I thought if I used soft serve ice cream that the carmel would not get as hard as a rock, but I was wrong. Even with adding nutmeg and cinnamon, this recipe just doesn't have the taste. For those who truly enjoy their desserts..skip this recipe..

I used ice cream instead of frozen yogurt. The bananas were nice, but I think that there should be NO lemon juice. Think about it: the lemon juice is only used in the recipe as a preserving agent for the bananas to make them last longer. If they are made without the lemon juice, they'll taste so good that everyone will eat them before they can go bad!

This recipe was good, but I don't know if I'd serve it with ice cream/frozen yogurt next time. The carmelized sugar was gooey (aka Yummy!), but the ice cream made it rock-hard, which I thought, ruined a great recipe.

Loved it and so simple! I used ice cream instead of yogurt. The toasted pecans were a nice touch.

Very good & very easy. Have tried several times with a number of variations: marinate banana slices in rum or brandy before caramelizing; add a dash of rum or brandy to the caramel; serve topped with chocolate sauce or over coconut ice cream--great after a Thai meal!

I thought the caramel was too sour from the lemon juice--it might be good with less. An odd dish...

Great Ski Weekend dessert. I would cut the bananas in half, then slice lengthways.

For something so simple, it was delicious. I make it with fresh yogurt ice cream and added a splash of Grand Marnier. Wonderful, and the best part, low in calories
