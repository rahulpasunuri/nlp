Next time I'll leave out the flour. I had to thin the sauce down with chicken broth. I halved the recipe for 2 people and there was barely enough sauce even thinned down. Great flavor though.

Classic, simple white sauce French style mussel recipe. I use this recipe all the time (with Great Eastern Farm Mussels, of course). I don't bother with the Pineau or grape juice typically. I found there's enough alcohol for my taste without the Pineau. French bread is mandatory with this recipe. Mussels are an under-rated food, and hopefully this recipe we'll get more people to try them.

I cannot imagine what the first reviewer did incorrectly - the sauce is never thick! This is the absolute all-time best mussel recipe on the planet and i would stack it against any other - home or restaurant. when we haven't had Pineau des Charentes, we've subbed cognac and it is fantastic. Be sure to have plenty of bread for mopping!

I am still in pursuit of the perfect sauce for mussels after having tried this recipe. Admittedly, perhaps the addition of the Pineau is crucial - it was the only thing I didn't have on hand so I substituted a combo of a fine white wine and a splash of cassis hoping to get the desired grape intensity..perhaps this is what made all the difference. Additionally, I found the sauce to be slightly too thick - I prefer the sauce to be runny enough to drip out from the shells and gather at the bottom of the plate for dipping a great crusty french bread in. We found it difficult to do so with this b/c the sauce clung inside heavily in the shells and we were forced to slurp it out to get to it - I think it was the flour/roux. In any event, did not feel the complexity of the sauce did justice for the wonderful fresh mussels we had. At restaurants I've had simpler creamy wine sauces that were a thousand times better..

This was wonderful! We've been buying Pineau des Charentes for years, ever since discovering it in France, so we had all the ingredients on hand, except for the mussels. With a salad and lots of French bread, this recipe made an adequate main course for 3 people. Used white burgundy for the recipe, and drank the same wine with the meal. It was truly superb.

I love this dish. I make it for every party, and use white grape juice instead of the pineau (I don't use it for anything else & didn't want to buy the bottle).

This is without a doubt the best mussels I have ever had.

I am a caterer/personal chef in Boston, and I have made this recipe from the moment it appeared in Bon Appetit. As a matter of fact, almost everything in this particular issue has become a standard in my repertoire. Never have I found a better recipe for mussels - I have tried provencal, baked, roasted, etc. My children don't eat mussels, but they appear to devour the sauce with great french bread (Iggy's or Clear Flour here in Boston). All my guests lick their fingers after this one, and demand it the next time they visit. People who have never eaten a mussel in their life are stabbing the person to their immediate left in order to get the last meaty mussel. It is extraordinary. I have tried 40 other recipes; none come close. I serve this with a great bread, salad, and Gateau Breton from the same 5/94 issue. Heaven. Not much is better. Try it.
