I only planned 1 day ahead so didn't marinate as long as some other reviewers. I might not have experienced the same depth of flavor as those who marinated longer but I still loved it. I closely followed the recipe. Made 1 minor change in technique. After removing chicken and before returning onions, mushrooms and bacon to the sauce I poured it into a fat separator. Worked well. Making this again very soon.

Preview reviews were correct! This recipe is an excellent rendition. I did marinate in very good pino for two days and then cooked entire recipe, brought to room temp and refrigerated for 2 days not 1. Flavors were amazing. I doubled the recipe to feed 12 and even added a few more thighs...not one piece of chicken left! And my friends ate in silence..goggling up every last bit of sauce!Served with noodles w/parsley and peas with sauteed shallots.

The flavor of the sauce this dish produced was outstanding, but getting there was a bit laborious. The good news is that the recipe is unusually well written. It's easy to follow, the quantities are straightforward (no 1.25 tsp fussiness), and the ingredients are separated by step. I decided to make coq au vin for some friends after scoring a Rhode Island Red rooster, the perfect stewing bird, from my favorite Amish farmers. The results would probably have been more tender if I'd used a younger hen or maybe stewed it longer? All cooking time combined, mine stewed about 90 mins. But the flavor was excellent, so I'm not complaining about a bit of toughness.

This dish proved to be an excellent entree to serve on a crisp autumn evening. My dinner guests loved it. I marinated my chicken for 3 days and the effort paid off. The chicken was moist, tasty and the skin carmelized to a crispy perfection. This recipe is a keeper.

I followed this recipe exactly, though I didn't take the extra fat off at the end, and I have to say it was exceptionally good. The recipe is well written and the proportions are good. I don't live in the US and so a roaster chicken is about half the size, but even with 2 cut up chickens, the recipe was still good. I would make this again, no doubt.

Made it for friends a couple weeks ago and it not only was completely gone and plates cleaned (nearly licked off), I will be making it again tomorrow. I wouldn't say it's too much work, just takes some planning in advance. I made the recipe almost exactly as the recipe said. As other reviewers suggested, the dark meat was fantastic (only made drumsticks and thighs).

Easter dinner with great friends. We marinated a fresh local chicken for 1 day and then cooked the meal together with the 4 of us. We also used local bacon and shitake mushrooms. It was a treat going through all the steps and at the end our sauce had zero extra fat. The roux was exceptional and I would make this dish again!

Rating: 4
This was truly exceptional. Yes there are lots of steps and lots of dishes in the steps. The work is over a long period of time, so it's not that big a deal. But you can do it all 2 or 3 days ahead of time, so you can be relaxed and serve a memorable meal at your dinner party - I followed the recipe pretty much exactly (thank you to the reviewer that suggested being sure to have the mise en place ready).... except I used thighs and legs only. (I find that chicken breasts used in a recipe like this tend to dry out or get tough anyway). I did let it marinate for 1-1/2 days. I then cooked and served it the same night - and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Next time I will make it 2 days ahead - to let the flavors deepen.

God this dish is goooood. Dont skimp on the parsley, and definitely go for the bacon. I didn't add the pearl onions, and quite honestly I'm glad I didn't. The dish was absolutely spectacular. Really it's not that much work, but the final result is amazing.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I made it for my New Years Day dinner, and it was the perfect way to start the new year. I used salt pork rather than bacon, and poured myself a glass of the Pino I used and subbed that amount with port. I also used turkey broth from my Christmas turkey, which melded well with the rich, deep flavors of the sauce. I would suggest starting with an empty dishwasher (or having a volunteer wash dishes as you go) and have all of your mise en place ready before you start cooking the chicken. Once you start cooking, the recipe moves pretty rapidly and there is not a lot of down time to chop or peel. If you love cooking and do a lot of it, I absolutely recommend this recipe; but if not, you might want to find something a little less intense. From beginning to end on just cooking (not the marinade) I spent about three, very involved, hours in the kitchen. Lots of "mmmm's" during dinner made all the work worth it!

Cooked it last night and loved it! The flavors were definitely there, and I should know, i'm french. :). Anyway, any suggestions as how to make the chicken more tender. The only criticism is that my chicken didn't fall off the bone. I used a farm-raised organic chicken, so I don't know if that's why (maybe less fatty), but I would love to perfect this recipe. Any suggestions as to have I can make sure the chicken is more tender? Thanks.

I cooked this recipe last night, it's simply great. Some time ago, I ate this recipe in a very famous French Restaurant in Chile, called "The petite France". I must to tell that the final flavor of this recipe is very good and similar with the french restaurant. I can't understand how some people don't like it. The recipe is very similar with the recipe of Le Cordon Bleu, with some ingredients more, like bacon and little onions. Cheers, Ceci.

I wonder if duck might work in this dish as a viable substitute for chicken? Many reviewers of this recipe state that they would only use thighs which are dark meat. Duck is dark meat. I know that the dish would also be named Canard Au Vin instead (instead of Coq Au Vin). There would then be also the issue of how fatty a duck is compared to a chicken, but there are ways to render fat from duck. I think it might be a delicious option however..

This is a wonderful, traditional coq au vin. Give it time! Marinade it in a good wine (I used a 10 dollar bordeaux this time) for the full 48 hours, and cook at least a day in advance to easily skim the fat from the sauce. The best advice I can give? Use a whole, free range chicken, make the chicken broth from the back and neck parts (again, let that sit in the fridge to easily skim the fat before using), use quality ingredients, and give it time! I've made it 3 times. This last event was for my students who just received their degrees. They've all been raised on white meat and kentucky fried chicken. A couple saw the purple color and balked at first, but from the first moment that one declared, "This is the best chicken I've ever eaten!", they all jumped in and devoured it. The only real work is cutting up the chicken. Read earlier reviews, there's great advice throughout. And those of us who gave it at least 3 days, are all very, very happy with the results.

I thought this was just okay. For the amount of effort involved, I'm only giving it 2 forks. For this much time and effort I expected to be floored and was not. It's not that it was bad, it just wasn't great. I will not be making this again.

I was disappointed. There were points along the way it smelled like the most amazing dish I'd ever make, but at the end it wasn't that special. I think the addition of the bacon at the end maybe overpowered it all. However, I am not clicking a fork to rate because I might just be bitter- it was a lot of work and my husband doused it all in barbecue sauce. I still haven't recovered from the insult.

I rarely bother to review recipes but this was outstanding even though I didn't have time to marinade for more than a couple of hours. I have made coq au vin using other recipes before and it has never come out so good. The vegetables were not soft enough to be pushed through a sieve so I just put them in with the chicken. Even my children said it was delicious!

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I didn't add celery. It was tasty, but not as flavorful as I would of thought. I do not think it was worth all of that work and the money for all the ingredients. I can probably put something together myself for half the price, and that is much more tasty. Maybe I did something wrong. I used a drinkable quality Pinot Noir, and made sure to use plenty of fresh herbs, good quality bacon, etc.

Seriously. WHO has time like this??? Utterly fabulous results...but had I bothered to read beyond the marinade part I would certainly have opted to wait until the weekend. And yet, I'm so proud of myself and it was indeed worth every minute. I will use only legs and thighs and include lots more little onions the next time and will invite a large number of people over rather than just cooking for two.

Excellent recipe. I have made it four times and just came to refresh my memory as to what I needed to buy tomorrow if I want it on Sunday. Other than it has to be marinated for a day or two, it requires as much work as any other meal. Sauerbraten for example, takes longer. Someone rated this two stars after using "cooking wine"?? Ugh! Spend the $8 on a half decent bottle of red. And I am not a food snob

I ended up making this recipe with a little more liquid than it says to use- I used maybe a glass more red wine and an extra cup of chicken broth- but then I like my dishes with lots of sauce. The dish came out really nice, full of flavour. I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 0
Excellent recipe. Don't underestimate the amount of work required, but it's worth it to develop and layer in all the flavors that make up this dish. Get a good wine for this, since it's a major element in the dish. Also -- it's work trying with white wine as well!

Cant imagine anyone not liking this! Use dark meat, its just yummier for soaking up the marinate. Wonderful *do ahead* recipe so you can spend time with your guests. If you are lucky enough to have leftovers, better the second day or even freeze it up for a microwave treat on a busy day!

This is a great recipe! I first made a regular batch at home as a tester then I made a huge (ingredients x 10) batch for a camping trip. Made it over the coals in a large copper pot. Changes: used only legs & thighs, used a cheap burgundy, did not marinate veggies with chicken. Forgot bay leaves but that did not really affect taste. Everyone loved it! Would absolutely make again.

This recipe was good. But for all the work, I wanted it to be CRAZY good. I'll try it again and tweak it--cut out some of the oil, simmer the wine/herb/veggie mixture longer, add extra broth and try for more of a robust reduction sauce.

I thought this Coq au Vin was fabulous! Well worth the time to make it. I would advise not rushing to make this as I think you would lose alot of flavour. Everyone loved it and many asked for the recipe! A special occasion treat. I too used just skinless chicken thighs.

The sauce was very good. I use a tempranillo wine, but thought the chicken called for too much cooking time. There are ways to make this that require less total time with equal or better flavor. I would advise less mushrooms and no white meat unless it is removed from the cooking liquid after 15 min.

Loved this recipe. Next time I'm using just thighs and drumsticks - the dark meats came out more flavorable. I also froze portions and they taste wonderful after thawing and heating. I don't mind the several-day-progression, since I make several batches at once.

Worth every moment spent chopping and simmering. Used boneless, skinless thighs and had no issues with fat, although I suspect it has four-fork flavour if you use chicken with skin on it. Only have access to button mushrooms locally, so I used a mix of dried, reconstituted porcini, morels and chanterelles and everyone raved. If you follow the basic proportions, use quality ingredients and make it a three or four day project, you probably won't have any leftovers. Darn! Now we'll have to make something else for Tuesday night. Great recipe for company. It's all done ahead.

Hmmm... I really wanted to love this recipe, but alas... no. Don't get me wrong, it was good. But that's it. Good. Not fabulous like I would have expected after all of the labor involved here. I've made other versions of this dish with much less effort and much more flavor.

Making an authentic coq au vin without a rooster is a challenge. This recipe comes very close. I used thighs and legs only. Next time I will use only thighs. I also added the port wine called for in the January 2001 Bon Appetit recipe. Definitely cook the marinade, marinade for at least two days, and make the dish two days before serving. The delay in serving really improves the flavor, and as several reviewers have pointed out,the recipe is labor intensive... you really can use the extra time.

I have never had Coq Au Vin before but decided to try it using this recipe. It was a lot of work, but I was happy with the results. I'm not a fan of bone-in chicken or thighs/wings - only breasts - so next time I may try using boneless breasts.

Rating: 2
Dissapointing. I agree with reviewer from Gold River, BC; labor intensive with mediocre results. When preparing a recipe for the first time I try not to deviate. I used a very good Pinot Noir and followed the recipe as written. In my opion, the greatest flaw was that our chickens today have huge breasts (too dry. Too much white meat) . I would suggest using thighs and legs exclusively. If you use the whole chicken (as I did) don't brown all pieces 8 minutes per side; use your cooking savy to judge browning time. I love Coq au Vin; this recipe is just O.K. Good luck.

Rating: 4
Delicious,but very time consuming. I omitted the oil in the marinade and in frying the bacon, and it turned out just fine. I used an electric skillet because none of my pots were large enough. It worked out ok, but I had to add water at the end because the sauce almost disappeared.

This truly had a nice, rich flavor. I made it with 4 breasts and 2 wings. I would recommend draining some of the bacon fat before placing the chicken in the pot. It ended up being too greasy for my tastes. I also left out the pearl onions and it was still full of flavor.

Because I didn't have time to marinate overnight, I added the marinating ingredients and cooked in a slow cooker for 2 hours, than added the rest of the "cooking" ingredients and cooked for 3 more hours - delicious!! Made one teeny little addition - added cognac first, and then the wine. My guests - the guines pigs for my cooking - raved!!! It was even better the second day. Liked it so much I'm making it again (using a slow cooker) today :- ) !!!

I made this for a dinner party I catered. Very time consuming and lots of steps and dishes, but not really difficult. I marinated the chicken for 2 days. Everyone loved it ("the best coq au vin ever!") - it's an impressive, rich, and formal dish. Next time I will chill when complete to separate the fat as the sauce was too oily for my taste and I didn't have the proper tools to separate while hot. Served Coquilles St.-Jacques as first couse and paired coq au vin with baby parsey-ed potatoes. Rich rich rich. Followed with bitter greens/citrus salad.

I thought it was tasty-the marinating in two days is a really great idea. Maybe it's my taste, but even at first pass, without cooking additionally with chicken stock, the flavor was way too rich. I prefer a more simple chicken in wine. Since I'd do so many things differently, I'll probably find another recipe! But I will marinade for the 2 days.

Use Crock-Pot, for less trouble and better results... Many of you mentioned about having to use many pots and pans. I made this dish a couple of times, and I decided to use Crock-Pot the third time, because slow cooking allows for the sauce to be absorbed by the chicken very nicely... It's perhaps not the "authentic" way, but the results are way better, not mentioning less work. After straining the sauce, and skimming off the fat, during the last step the whole thing can be cooked in slow cooker for about 6 hours, on low heat. Delicious.

It was good, but I was expecting more, especially after the amount of time and effort that went into the preparation of the dish. Did start it two days in advance and used skinless chicken breasts on the bone. It is crucial to eliminate as much fat as possible. I took the approach of straining the sauce allowing the fat to rise to the top as well as making it in advance so what remained congealed on top after chilling. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans with creme brulee for dessert. For my liking there could have been more sauce. Would much rather order this in a restaurant and not use up so much of my free time.

Start this one a couple days in advance and you won't be sorry. Great for a dinner party as it can be started (and finished) way ahead. I, like others, was alarmed by the amount of fat. Cooking with the fat is mandatory for flavor development, but you don't want that fat in your finished product. No skimming of fat is instructed until the end of the recipe, so it's essential you have a gravy separator or, better yet, chill the sauce on its own one day before and then skim the congealed fat before pouring back over the chicken. No need to bake the chicken separately (as others have done) because it braises long enough in the liquid to cook thoroughly and tenderize beautifully - and why waste even a drop of flavor, to say nothing about dirtying another pan? After the marinating, I used only two pans: one medium-sized one for cooking the mushrooms and the pearl onions toward the end, and a large copper pan (with lid) for everything else. Cook/reduce the sauce for the times specified and the flavors will naturally intensify. I can't understand how others got bland-tasting sauce. I'm guessing they didn't reduce enough because I didn't add ANY salt and the results were perfect. Most importantly, don't cheap out on the wine. Use one you would drink; and pour the same wine with dinner!

Rating: 4
Delicious! Perfect dish for the large dinner party I had the other night. However, I did make one major change -- I'm not a fan of dark meat, and I did want to cut down on fat content, so I made the dish using skinless boneless breasts. The resulting dish was still flavorful, and no one missed the extra fat. I served it over buttered egg noodles and peas/carrots on the side.

Help! I'm trying to make this dish right now. I prepared the marinade last night. I was just reading through the recipe, and am unclear whether the carrots, celery & large onion are supposed to be in the final product or not.

I'm reviewing this recipe because there are several Coq Au Vin recipes to choose from, and I'm happy I chose to make this one. I used a Santa Maria valley Pinot Noir ($15). I thought the dish had a very nice French quality. I used a Kosher chicken that had already been cut up--this is my favorite kind of chicken to cook with when available. Also, instead of boiling onions, I used one big sweet onion (I don't like dealing with fresh boiling onions and the frozen ones have a weird taste and texture to me). After the marinating phase, this recipe took 2 hours of active cooking start to finish. Yes, it takes a few pots/pans, but you end up with meat, sauce, and a vegetable side. I served this with mashed potatoes with a dash of white truffle oil. It was delightful. You could add a few extra chicken pieces. There is plenty of sauce. If you really want the French bistro taste, make this one.

I have never voted a dish four forks, because I cannot, in all good conscience, say this is "a dish beyond compare." However, If 3.5 was a possibility, this dish would get it from me. Yes, it is complicated. Yes, it takes time. Yes, it takes a lot of cookware. And, yes, it is absolutely delicious and worth all of the above. The only difference in my cooking was that I discoverd that I had skinless chicken thighs in the freezer instead of bone-in thighs with skin. Made the dish anyway; still very good. One shortcut: I used frozen pearl onions which is a lot less work. Just thawed them and proceeded withthe recipie as written. It all worked. Served this with simple steamed asparagus and a crusty sour-dough french bread from a local bakery. One thought: it does have a lot of fat; I suggest slightly chilling, removing the fat and reheating.

This is a truly classic coq au vin recipe, and a fabulous one at that. Yes, it is very time consuming and takes foresight and advance preparation. Yes, the chicken is purple -- it's marinated and cooked in red wine, for heaven's sake! But, this is a "classic" recipe, and to me, that means prepared the old-fashioned way, just like it has been done in France for ages. I thought it was one of the most delicious meals I have ever prepared, and I enjoyed taking the time to do it right. Ok, I should admit that I used a jar of pearl onions and didn't peel my own. Otherwise it is SO worth following this recipe, and for goodness sakes, please do it properly and use RED wine. It was not remotely unappealing to me nor to our guests. It was elegant and tender and flavorful and fabulous.

Next time I think I will follow the advice of the caterer below by baking the chicken separately and some of her other tips. I used a Merlot and my chicken went totally purple, as did all of the vegetables! Despite browing the chicken, the long cooking left the skin soggy and unappealing. Overall, the dish tasted wonderful, but was a visual disaster. As I said, perhaps the caterer's tips will help on presentation and I certainly won't use a Merlot again.

I made this recipe for a "gourmet club" dinner party for 12 over the holidays. When I was making it I thought that I would never make it again because it was so labour intensive, but the results changed my mind! Next time I might condense a couple of the steps though. I do think that it is better to make 1 day ahead and then refigerate so you can scoop off the layer of fat that has formed on the surface. Good luck!

I followed this recipe and loved it. It was not difficult to prepare, but planning 3 days ahead was. Despite this minor difficulty, I would certainly make it again.

I needed to make this dish more manageable for a drop off catering job. Some of these tips will help cut the pot and pan clutter. First, I made it with Sauvignon Blanc so the chicken wouldn't be purple. After marinating, I crisped the bacon in a large skillet, and took the bits out. I dried the chicken and browned it in the bacon fat. Then took the chicken out and put it in an ovenproof dish and into a 350 degree oven. While the chicken baked, I browned the veggies from the marinade, and the garlic and herbs. Added the flour and sauteed that. Added the wine from the marinade. Added a little slurry to that (flour in cold water, shaken vigerously) and some chicken broth, cooked until a nice consistency. Drained the veggies and saved the sauce. Washed out the skillet and carmelized baby carrots, then onions, then mushrooms in the butter recommended.(watch the butter...I only used 3/4 stick for 30 servings!) Took the chicken out of the oven, put the veggies over all, and added the sauce. Baked at 350 until chicken was done and everything was bubbly. Perfect! Served with salad with citrus vinaigrette, wild and white rice pilaf with thyme and garlic, sauteed green beans and dinner rolls. My client is still raving!

This dish took a LONG time! Still everyone was very impressed with the results. The chicken was so tender that it fell apart if you even looked at it funny. All the flavors melded together beautifully. I served it with simple boiled potatoes for sopping up the sauce and buttered green beans. I will make it again but only if I'm feeling energetic.

THIS IS NOT A HARD DISH TO MAKE AND TIME COULD BE SAVED BY ORGANIZING THE STEPS. I ADDED TWO MORE LEGS AND TWO MORE THIGHS AS THE DARK MEAT IS NATURALLY MORE FLAVORFULL. JUST REMEMBER TO READ THE RECIPE THOROUGHLY, HAVE ALL INGREDIENTS ON HAND, HAVE ALL UTENSILS ON HAND AND THEN START THE PREP AND FINISHING WORK.

This recipe is overall easy to follow, however maybe too much fat is used? It is crucial to skim the fat couple of times, unless you end up with not-so-attractive (and not so yummy!) thick oily layer on top. I find it better to use skinless chicken. One thing: one must use good wine for this, because the quality of wine basically determines the taste of the dish.

This was a LOT of work, but it was worth every minute I put into it. This is a great Sunday dinner, and even better the next day for lunch. I will make this again, and again and again. I made roasted grapes with this (yes it sounds funky, but is really delicious.) and some lovely garlic crushed potatoes.

This was a decent recipe, but was short on flavor considering the amount of work involved. This tasted like a mid-week meal with the work and ingredients of a special-occasion meal & I tend to cook many involved dishes. The chicken was also not particularly moist and tender although I marinated it for 2 days. I think you could achieve similar results with seared chicken and a wine and mushroom sauce. I don't think that the bacon added much to the dish either. I'm not really sure why this dish received such high ratings.

Made this for our 8 member gourmet dining club this past weekend. Everyone enjoyed the dish. Next time I would use only dark meat - maybe only drumsticks as those seemed to be the favorite. I did not add any oil - the bacon fat and butter are more than adequate. I also took the fat out of the sauce a couple of times. This is not a difficult recipe but it does require a lot of time. I marinated the chicken Wed. night with Friday night as my target cooking time. But Friday I prepped the onions, mushrooms, shallots, etc. and then cooked Saturday morning. I used several dishes and pans and spent 3 hours at it! Chilled the finished dish and slowly reheated it for Saturday evening. Perfect! It made my evening very pleasant - with little to do except enjoy my guests.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! It is definitely time consuming, so it is in your best interest to marinate it for two days, cook it the day before you want to serve it and then simply reheat on the evening of your dinner. I made this for a dinner party and am thrilled with the results. Because of my appetizers (curried wild mushroom pate and onion & sage tarts), and other courses (first course: Coquilles St. Jacques {family recipe}; salad AFTER Coq Au Vin -- mesclun w/pear vinagrette dressing with baked goat cheese sprinkled with white & black sesame seeds; dessert: pear tarte), I opted to only serve the Coq Au Vin with green beans that I sauteed in a shallot butter. Yummy meal. I would absolutely make this again for a special occasion. The only thing I would do differently would be to clean & cut my mushrooms and onions the day before I cook.

Marinated chicken for 2 days -- was totally purple. Long process, but good results -- and moist chicken. My guests and boyfriend raved about it for 2 weeks, so I'll probably make it again. But, I wasn't completed thrilled with the taste - the sauce wasn't quite complex enough, maybe because of all the bacon fat and oil; or maybe a more expensive bottle of wine might help next time.

The lengthy preparation was definitely paid-off. Our guests raved about it. I skipped bacon, and marinated for a day and half, and the result still went out great! I served with Gratin Dauphinois to match the French rustic feel.

My only question is.. Where is the sauce in their picture? My chicken did look like the picture, but when I put it back in the sauce, it lost a little of the nice colour it got when browning. I left the oil out of the marinade as suggested, but I'm wondering if that might be why my chicken was a wee bit dry? Or perhaps I should have reduced cooking time. HOWEVER, don't get me wrong, the end result was fantastic. As another reviewer said, the process was enjoyable. Marinated it on Sunday and cooked it on Tuesday.

I can't understand how the chicken was dry for other reviewers - stewing it in the wine sauce kept it very tender. I skipped the bacon and it was still extremely flavourful. I just served as-is with some crusty bread to mop up the sauce. Very, very worth the time. (By the way, it may take a bit of time, but it's very simple.) DELICIOUS!

The recipe deserves 10 FORKS!!!! Excellent...You must marinate it two days to get the full flavor. I didn't find it that much work since I love to cook. We didn't add the oil to the marinate since we were going to use oil to cook it with. We cooked it 15 minutes less than called for and it came out so tender. Our guests raved about the flovor and there was hardly any sauce left due to how delicous it was. We went through one and a half loaves of homemade wheat french bread that was terrific with the sauce. I served key lime pie for dessert which topped off the evening. I will make this again and give out the recipe to all my friends. One of the best dishes i have ever made.............

While this is recipe was quite a bit of work, I felt that the results were really worth it. Some of the chicken dried out a little in the cooking process, however the Sauce was spectacular.

I served it on a bed of noodles, pouring the sauce over all, and I think this was a mistake. The noodles diluted the flavor of the sauce. It seemed a bit bland after all that work. Next time I think I will serve it with mashed potatoes instead, with Burgundy instead of California Pinot Noir. If I still think it lacks flavor, I will search for another dish.

This is an excellent recipe. I think it is the best Coq au Vin I have ever made and I have been making it for almost 35 years. There is a lot of prep and a number of steps. But nothing difficult. And as noted here the labor can be spread over 2 or even 3 days. I have no trouble cutting up a chicken (and would prefer to) but you could easily buy chicken parts and save some effort. The flavor of this dish is incredible and just keeps getting better.

This recipe sure made my house smell wonderful, but it took way too long for the ultimate product. Plus, with all the transfering back and forth with the chicken, it seemed a little dry by the end. Too much work, in my opinion.

This dish was delicious and tasted even better the second day. It was very labor intensive however, so you need to be willing to put in several hours to prepare this dish. It can be made over several days. Worth the effort!

Delicious. Have made twice, aromas are wonderful. Leftovers better than the first night. I like using boned, skinless chicken thighs and (for those who like white meat) breast pieces.

I enjoyed the challenge of the dish and appreciated having three days to work through it! Overall, I thought it was a terrific dish but I'm not sure it was worth all the effort. You can definitely leave the extra fat out -- the amount of fat I spooned off after overnight refrigeration was incredible. Would I cook this again? I'm not sure. I think there are equally tasty dishes out there that don't require three days of labor.

Lots of work best done in segments over a few days before the party, but WHAT A MEAL! I served this for New Year's dinner and it was a huge success. We enjoyed the meal for a few days afterward as well. Would definitely make it again. The house smelled divine!

It did take a while, but very delicious. My favorite part was the presentation - the chicken turns out beautifully browned - very elegant. Served with Amy's Basil Risotto (on this site) steamed asparagus, and green salad with goat cheese and candied almonds - the family loved the whole meal!

I thought that this recipe was great, labor intensive yes, worth it yes. I would leave out the bacon in the future it does add fat and doesn't seem to inhance the flavor. It's been a big hit twice at our house.

There is really no need for all this fat. I left the oil out of the marinade and why does bacon need to be fried in additional oil?? I then drained the excess bacon fat before adding the next ingredients. Also taking the skin off the chicken will cut it back.

Oh my gosh! This is a great recipe. I fair amount of work, but worth it.

Like other reviewers, I wish there was a way to cut the fat and the extra oil. I would prepare this again but there has to be a way to reduce the oil.

This tasted great, but was just too labour intensive - it seemed to take up every pot in my kitchen (some more than once)! Also, it seemed to be a bit too oily; I wish I could have chilled it over night and removed some fat. I would make this again, if only there was an easier way...Guests liked it by the way (served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans).

This recipe is very similar to Cook's Illustrated's Coq au Vin. The sauce was very smooth and delicious. I added a beurre manne to the sauce at the end to thicken it slightly. As with any Coq au Vin recipe, this was very labor intensive. Your kitchen will be a mess (kid you not). I used crimini and shiitake. Started with a mache and roasted beets salad and served the coq au vin over garlic mashed potatoes with a side of roasted asparagus. Don't forget a crusty bread to soak up some of the sauce. Great meal. Husband loved it. Well worth the time. Great to make for guests ahead of time and slowly reheat on low. You will impress them.

I marinated the chicken for the full 2 days and prepared exactly as written except had to substitute frozen pearl onions due to availabilty in my market. I was worried that the chicken would be overdone and was reluctant about the reheating idea but I heated it slowly in a covered dish in the oven and it was actually perfect.The sauce was rich and flavor was great. But, I feel that the oil in marinade was uneccessary as it just congealed on top and there was more than enough fat in the rest of the sauce that it wouldn't be missed. I would do this recipe again because it was easy to assemble, can be done ahead on a flexible schedule and I could build a menu around this dish to suit many different occasions.

I made this exactly as written. I started in on Thursday (marinating overnight), finished on Friday night, and then re-heated and served the dish on Saturday night. It was excellent. My only slight disappointment was that it was a bit greasy and somewhat messy with all the skins and bones. However, I'm used to eating skinless chicken most of the time so I knew what I was getting into. Obviously, the skin, bacon and butter would produce more fat. The fat did rise to the top overnight, however, so I was able to scoop it out with a spoon here and there...around the chicken pieces. I may give this a try with skinless breasts and thighs, just to see what happens. Overall, I thought this was just perfect for a fall evening with a salad, red wine and side of parmesan-sage polenta. In fact, I am looking forward to having it again tonight! Bon Appetite!

After receiving the October issue, I couldn't wait to try this. Very good recipe; although I'm sure not recommended by any purists, I left out the oil in marinade and the 4 Tb butter for the veggies. Also, skipped the bacon saute for the chicken & veggies - used real bacon bits added to the onions instead. The sauce was still thick and velvety. Appreciated the two day prep method as I can set this up for Sunday Dinner ahead of time.
