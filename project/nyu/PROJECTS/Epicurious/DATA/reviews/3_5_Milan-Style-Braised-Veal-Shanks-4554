Fabulous. Very easy to prepare. I prepared a few times and it was good every time.

I don't bother tying the shanks. The meat shrinks and the cord comes off anyway. To serve, I take the meat off the bone and serve the bones separately so the marrow can be spread on bread. Yum. Also, I don't use as much broth. As long as the meat is covered 2/3 of the way up, it braises well and I do this in a 300 degree oven for about 3 hours, separate the meat from the sauce, chill and degrease the sauce. Then I mash the vegetables lightly into the sauce and reduce. Makes a wonderfully thick sauce.

An extremely tasty dish. I was forced to substitute beef shanks, which I believe really effected the outcome. There was an abundant amount of "sauce" which was greedily sopped up by a bed of polenta. I would like to make it again with veal.

It took a lot longer than 15 minutes to reduce the broth at the end, and it was still too thin for my taste. I would serve the veal in a shallow bowl and the sides separately, unless you plan on putting the broth on them anyway. Next time it will be much better. Kind of a lot of work, but almost all of it happens before the guests arrive.

Easy and very flavorful. I cut back a little on the oil and butter (Used just enough to coat the bottom of the pan). This dish is one of those homey fall comfort foods that takes the chill out of the day.

Very tasty autumnal meal, especially when paired with risotto. For the money, however, I think I did much better last week when I made filet mignon with cognac sauce (see Julia Child, pepper steak, made with fielt migon) for about the same money, much less work and more flavor.)

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it!! It was very easy to make compared to a previous ossobuco recipe I made. I highly recommend it.

I had such success making this osso buco for the Thanksgiving's eve dinner a couple of years ago. A lemon bavarian for desert will make this dinner tops. I lost the osso buco recipe and I am so happy to have found it. Will serve it again this Thanksgiving's eve.

I made this for guests last night and it was a huge success. I thought it was somewhat bland which could be because I used unsalted beef broth. My experience with salted when reducing liquid is that it gets way too salty?? I also made the Peas with Pancetta and the Campari Poached Pears with Raspberry Sauce - both (BA 12/97) were good and well worth making. The Polenta recipe sounded too ambitious

I made this dish when it was first published in 1997 and haven't forgotten how delicious it is! I was relieved to find it on Epicurious because I lost the recipe and want to make it for Christmas dinner. Try it -- you won't be disappointed!

A great dish for entertaining. Get it started, cover well, let it cook slowly on a back burner. You've got the oven and three more burners to do vegetables, dessert, etc. Don't even think about skipping the lemon & garlic at end - it really adds a fresh touch.

Wonderful!!! This dish is very elegant, and the best part is that you can prepare it the day before. I think the flavors actually are enhanced if prepared ahead.

Easy and delicious. Made it for company one night, other guests dropped in delaying our dinner for an hour. Didn't seem to suffer at all. This would be a great dish when your actual dinner hour is up in the air.
