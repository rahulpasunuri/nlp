This has become my go-to chocolate cake, since it's not only delicious, but it's also fast and easy - no need to drag out the mixer for the cake OR the frosting. I've made it 6 or 7 times now, always successfully. Once I didn't have buttermilk and decided to sub yogurt/milk mixture - still edible but the texture was not as light and flavor was not as nuanced. The frosting is soft and would not hold well to piping, although I have swirled it on cupcakes from a bag with a basic bead opening. Everyone from small children to sophisticated adults love this.

Wonderful cake, tender, moist and great chocolate flavor. Also quick and easy to put together. I reversed the mixing process and mixed the wet ingredients into the dry, no lumps that way. The layers are not very high and I think next time I may increase the ingredients by 1/2 to get a higher cake. Wasn't impressed with the frosting and will use another one next time. But overall an amazing cake for so little effort. Emily in Michigan.

I made this cake with buttercream icing and it turned out ok. It was pretty dry, so I might not bake for quite as long, or perhaps add 1/2 cup applesauce for moistness. If I made it again, I would definitely tweak the recipe a bit to guarantee a more moist cake.

light, moist, yummmy and easy to make!! I reduce the amount of sugar both in cake and frosting because every time I bake cakes and follow recipes exactly, my cakes always turn up too sweet. So, now I always use less sugar than the recipe (any recipe)calls for. I also made cupcakes from this recipe, added some chopped chocolate and marshmallow to the bater for extra 'zing'. yumyumyum all the way!

This cake was a huge hit! It was yummy AND looked very nice. I didn't change anything except cut down on the sugar (which I do for everything) and found it fantastic.

Four forks as long as you use a little less sour cream in the frosting than the recipe calls for. Made it for my daughter's birthday and am making it again for a potluck. VERY easy.

i used this recipe to make "cauldron cakes" for my son's Harry Potter birthday party. I added cinnamon, reduced the cooking time, and used buttercream icing with almond extract instead. all in all it was a fantastic recipe. moist, flavorful, and super easy.

I have now used this frosting three times, once on this cake, once on chocolate cupcakes, and once on a chocolate ambrosia cake. I love it! It spreads smoothly and looks so nice. Also, you don't need to make it too sweet. It's my ideal frosting!

This was a really easy recipe! It needed to bake for 4 minutes longer than directed. I didn't add salt and I thought that it was fine the way it was. It needed to be in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving to firm up the frosting. Everybody loved it!

A perfect chocolate cake! This cake was moist, chocolatey, and delicious! I did add the 1/2 tsp. of salt that another reviewer suggested, which I think is necessary. I also added 1/4 tsp. salt to the icing + a sprinkle of coarse grey salt as well. It nicely off-sets the chocolate and sweetness of the icing. The recipe was easy, to boot, which means I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This was very very easy to make. And it was good. But not exciting. Be sure to sift the powdered sugar.

Not only was this cake very tasty, it was also extremely easy. It came out beautifully to rave reviews from my party guests. They have already requested another one for a future get-together. The frosting is so smooth and decadent that it's difficult to believe it wasn't beaten by an electric mixer! Note: I also added the 1/2 tsp. of salt, which was the only change I made in the recipe. Even though everyone loved the cake, I think next time I will take it out of the oven a couple of minutes sooner to keep a bit more moisture in it.

Just as advertised. My two kids made this one, while I supervised in the event of fighting. Added the extra salt as suggested. I got a bit nervous when I poured the batter in the pan and it only seemed to just cover the bottom. It rose up perfectly and evenly right to the top edge of the pan. Popped easily from the pans too. Didn't try the frosting though it sounds nice--the kids always vote for canned (yikes!) I love that it's relatively low fat too. This is a go-to recipe from now on.

WOW! this cake is amazing, who would had thought that sour cream in frosting could be so good. I am defiantly a dark chocolate person so this cake is perfect for my taste. The only problem with the cake is there is no salt in the recipe but if you just add about 1/2 tsp you will be fine.

I made the cake only, using a Duncan Hines frosting (I always scrape off the frosting anyway). I made the cake with one minor alteration -- added 1/4 t. salt as suggested by a previous post. Cake was very quick and easy and came out nice and moist, nice light texture. The problem was the flavor: although the first couple of bites were okay, I soon began to taste something off about it. I think this cake is too cocoa-y -- the cocoa isn't really balanced well by other flavors and so I think the cake tastes a little harsh. It's too bad because this really is an easy recipe, but I'll keep looking for something easy with a better flavor.

The recipe needs SALT. The flavors were totally flat due the the lack of salt in the recipe. If you added 1/4t of salt, it would be much better.

Was looking for a quick cake recipe today & found this. Wanted something to go with homemade vanilla bean ice cream. Made them into big cupcakes and did not use the icing recipe. Ice cream is already fattening enough. They were delicious with the ice cream and my family loved the entire dessert!

This cake is great. I love that it is fast. I used yougurt instead of buttermilk and acidentally forgot to add the cocoa, but it turned out just fine... I just had to bake it for an extra 10-15 minutes.

Read previous reviews that the cake was dry so after baking, I brushed on a sugar syrup flavour with kirsh. The icing was wonderful, so easy to make and had a creamy, rich chocolate flavour. Everyone loved the cake, and it was so easy. Cake was not dry.

Very simple and fast recipe with great results. The cake, made without adjustments, was extremely moist and had a wonderful texture. It was a perfect vehicle for the unusually smooth and creamy frosting. Next time, I will try reducing the sugar in the frosting, as I prefer it less sweet, but it is delicious as-is.

Since the reports said this was unnappealing and dry, I thought, well that's easy to fix. An egg for the dryness, salt for the unnappealing. It wasn't dry and it wasn't unnappealing but it didn't have the same smoothness as a box cake. Maybe cake flour would fix that. I'll have to try it again. It was very easy though.

Well, it was certainly easy, but the cake was dry and unappealing. The frosting was quite good using Scharffen Berger chocolate and cocoa - I'll use it again sometime with a different cake recipe. Guess it's back to the humongous but absolutely delicious Double Chocolate Layer Cake from this site.

Very good and very easy recipe! Great if you don't have a electric mixer. I am a student living in Scotland, so I don't always have access to certain ingredients. This recipe is very starightforward. I have made it as cake and cupcakes. Made 12 good sized cupcakes. Icing is wonderful

This is our standbye chocolate cake recipe. It is very easy (almost as easy as a box!) and it turns out perfect every time (I usually cook for about 30 min.). I've used it for birthday cakes and cupcakes. Since we like cream cheese frosting a lot, we use that on this cake which we find compliments it very well.

As an experienced chef, I feel compelled to write a review on this recipe. I love chocolate but I am not a cake lover. I needed something fast and good as I was making this cake with kids for my husband's birthday. I was surprised at how Good this cake was. First off, I knew it had potential b/c of the ingredient list. I notice some reviewers didn't have the same experience but also modified the method, which when baking can truly change the cake all together. This was so simple, not rich, not too sweet but the perfect birthday cake in my book and coffee companion the next morning. :) Stick to the recipe and give it a shot. It is worth a try and maybe you will love it just as much as my family, friends, neighbors...

Very easy, very quick recipe. I added a tsp. salt after tasting the batter- it tasted like it was missing something. This recipe also makes 18 cupcakes when cooked for 23 minutes.

After years of success with Epicurious recipes this is the first one I've felt compelled to review. This is fast and easy. Almost as fast as a boxed cake mix. I like that the icing recipe gives me a generous amount, enough for a layer cake. The consistency is perfect for spreading. I darken the cake with a good Dutch process cocoa (half normal half DP). The buttermilk can be made with soy milk and vinegar (1c to 1T). Maybe you could add a bit of salt to the cake recipe. The flavors are fine. Not too sweet. A welcome find in this world of too-sweet cakes. What I like is that this is not a delicate cake to prepare. Because of the ease of the making I recommend it when you need a decent, frosted cake now, fast and easy.

I made this cake for a group dinner at my home. It was easy, that's for sure! However, the sour cream frosting while certainly creamy and pretty, was somewhat bitter - tart. The cake was more on the unsweet-chocolatey side, so if you like chocolate for chocolate's sake, then you will love this. If you are looking for more like the typical American sweet, chocolate cake, you are better off trying something else.

I too have been making this devil's food cake since 1992. It's a family favorite and every time I make it I get lots of compliments. Such an easy homemade cake to make. If you're a choco-holic this will hit the spot (add some vanilla bean icecream and you're all set)

I used this recipe to make cupcakes for my son's birthday and it was perfect. The highlight was definitely the icing and I would continue to use this icing for other things. I had a lot leftover, so I added more sour cream a couple of days later and made a creamier version for my next set of cupcakes. A huge hit!

Rating: 4
Haven't made the cake yet but can testify that the icing is excellent. Too often my icing has been kind of blah, too much sugar or not enough butter. The sour cream makes the icing creamy and accents the chocolate very nicely. I added a bit more sour cream and got the consistency I was looking for. Can't wait to try it with the cake recipe.

I should have known that this cake would be a disappointment based on the directions. I tried a modified creaming method, not the one-bowl method. I tried to incorporate the sugar in to the oil for a few minutes, and also alternately added the milk and the flour mixture. It really didn't help. No time saved here, as I ended up making a different cake.

I made this cake for my daughters first birthday. While the cake was moist, personally I like a much sweeter and more chocolatey cake. My husband did not like the cake and he commented that he thought it had a strange off taste of raspberry. If you like cake that is not too sweet then I would definitely recommend this.

This is the cake for the burnt out, too busy to cook, yet another birthday Mom...there is no limit to the variations one can make with this recipe. I baked then soaked it in liquor (chocolate), used whipped cream frosting on another, regular choc frosting on another, and put ice cream in the middle of another and they all came out tasting different and yummy. Definately a keeper.

I've been baking this cake and using the frosting since it first appeared in March of 1992. It is a never fail, moist, delicious, chocolatey cake and the frosting is my all time favorite. I make it for many occasions, family and entertaining. I'm making it again for Valentine's Day and will bake it in heart shaped pans this time. My family expects this cake whenever we're all together. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 14" cake pan for a fund raiser dessert party and it got rave reviews and not a crumb was left!

I've made this cake several times now. Easy and delicious! Even my kids like the sour cream frosting. I might make something "fancier" for a really special occasion, but for that weekday chocolate cake craving, it sure beats store-bought or cake mix--by a mile.

i was searching the web for an easy to make chocolate cake(the only thing he eats) for my husband's birthday. made the cake night before {i made two cake recipes to one recipe of frosting} and the icing the next morning. i added grated white chocolate as garnish and it made my guests wonder whether it was coconut or cheese. (adds mystery to the taste of the cake.) i put the cake in the freezer for 2 hours after frosting for the icing to set. then transferred the cake in room temperature for about 2 to 3 hours before serving...MMMMMMM good! everybody loved it and thought it was store bought--my simple garnish added the flair to an already sinfully delicious chocolate cake! it was good, not too sweet and since there's no coffee, i let the kids eat some too! thanks!!!

My first cake attempt ever - cake turned out moist, and frosting was sweet and rich. Easy enough for beginners, but impressive when nicely garnished (used starfruit and passionfruit). Made a sauce with butter, sugar, passionfruit and reduced red wine - a great addition to the cake.

The consistency of the cake was unappealing, dryish, and instead of a light springy texture it reminded me of a large cellulose sponge. The frosting was too tart for my taste. I substituted sweetened condensed milk for the second portion of sour cream. I did not measure the exact amount, just added until the taste and consistency were right.
