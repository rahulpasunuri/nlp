I think this is a great combination. I even tried a variation with regular whitefish and onions instead of shallots. Still good flavor. I would suggest a shade less olive oil - probably 4 would do it.

You can avoid dryness by adding pasta with some cooking water to the whitefish and finishing the pasta there. I used some tarragon instead of parsley, worked great.

Well, I won't give this a rating since I skimped on the olive oil. It was dry and not all that great. We ate it, but my husband did NOT ask for the leftovers for lunch the next day. Hee hee hee! Where gourmet is at? Good God, can't you eat food without being trendy? They are called taste buds, Willie.

This dish is very European, which is where gourmet cuisine ia at right now. Add some asparagus spears and you have a great summer dish.
