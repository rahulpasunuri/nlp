I made this recipe once for a potluck and I have requests over and over for it. Its fairly easy and always a winner. I always use fresh nutmeg and I do think that makes a difference.

I made this for Easter and it was not well received. My guests said I should have added brown sugar and I agreed. I doubled the bourbon and still didn't taste it whatsoever. fyi, it took about 20 minutes for the cream to reduce, and you need a big gratin dish to fit these in a single layer. I will not be making these again.

This was a huge hit at yesterday's Thanksgiving gathering. Everyone wanted the recipe saying they never really liked yams or sweet potatoes because they were covered in sweet gunk. I used whole nutmeg and grated it over the top before baking. Just delicious!

I have made this recipe for 4 years in a row for our Thanksgiving sweet potato side. In fact, I get requests every year to make these. Most men I know say they hate sweet potatoes but change their mind once they taste these

Scrumptious! We made this with pork shoulder and purple cabbage cole slaw for a Bourbon Heritage Month Party in September. People are still asking me for the recipe!

Despite the other reviews, I thought this dish was delightful. I doubled the Burbon (cause that's the kinda gal I am!) - and I used Jim Beam, which has a distinct flavor as far as I'm concerned. It worked well with the sweetness of the potatoes. Mine were not significantly mushy - I ate it all up & got rave reviews. I served this with part of a thanksgiving dinner & was a nice variation on more typical ways to prepare sweet potatoes. I'll make this again.

Blah. The bourbon is nearly imperceptible. The texture is mush. The flavor is like cream and yams. Ho-hum.

I had my eye on this recipe for thanksgiving. It was moist and pleasant, but nothing special. I made half the amount listed here, but still used the full 2 tablespoons of bourbon, and STILL couldn't taste it in the final results. I think there have to be more interesting ways to fix sweet potatoes. But again, if you are a big fan of sweet potatoes, you may well love how moist these are.
