Excellent! However, I would recommend making 8, and shape each turnover individually.

Made this with my 4 year-old daughter, with the crust from Epicurious' Cinnamon Crumble Apple Pie. It was delicious and satisfying! And a great way to use 4 plums that were borderline edible...

You serve each person a HALF a pie crust? Is this a misprint?

This was really easy and fun to make. After I was done making the Turnovers the entire house smelled so good. The only thing I did differently was instead of Cherry Balsamic Vinigar (i couldnt find any of it) I used honey. Its a bit sweeter then I imagine it would be but its still delicious.
