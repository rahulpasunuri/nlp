I'm not sure what went wrong, but I followed this recipe exactly and for some reason it lacked flavor.

Delicious!! I won the "corn bread" category at a chili cook-off with these biscuits - so good they out-did all of the competition. Sadly they just don't taste the same the next day - eat them right out of the oven or within a few hours!! I increased the buttermilk to 2 cups like other reviews suggested! Off to make these for a brunch!!

Made these for a Super Bowl party to go with chili...they were fabulous and loved by all. My version: - switch out 3/4 c. flour for whole wheat - add 1 tsp. garlic powder with dry ingredients - use 1.5 c cheddar and 1.5 c jalapeño jack cheese - increase buttermilk to 2 c - baked 12 biscuits at a time on a parchment-lined baking sheet by dropping 1/4 c mounds of dough, then pressed each flat - before baking, sprayed each biscuit with a little Pam, then sprinkled on fresh ground black pepper - baked two sheets of biscuits (24 total) for 20 minutes

I was expecting these to be amazing given the "addictive" descriptive word of the recipe, so I am honestly a bit disappointed. Granted I did swap out the bread flour for wheat flour, but I wanted more cheese flavor than what I got with the 2.5 cups. I think my husband will like them regardless of my slight disappointment, so I'll make them again but I think I'll play more with the recipe next time.

I did everything wrong/different and these were still fabulous. I halved the recipe, very roughly, was not that precise. Used the wrong size muffin cups. Brushed on the melted butter before baking, not after. (I was in a hurry, didn't read carefully enough.) Didn't have enough cheddar so mixed in jalapeno jack. These are great fresh and equally good re-heated the next morning. Total winner recipe.

I made this as my very first biscuit attempt (while I cook/grill, I don't so often bake). These came out simply fantastic--they can't be good for you, but they taste wonderful! Like others have said, I made mine on a baking sheet. Also, I added a little garlic powder in with the dry ingredients and some cut chives at the end with the buttermilk addition. I did not have a food processor, so I used an electric hand mixer instead. It took a while to get the butter pieces mixed in properly, but it worked out just fine. Also, they are really filling, so they would be best paired with something light, like a salad.

i'm a biscuit fan, and these are near the top of my list. wary of grease, i skipped the melted butter, and the tops browned beautifully and the crusts came out crispy with just a little touch of oil in a nonstick muffin pan. i used the cheese i had on hand - pepper jack - and made my own "buttermilk" by adding 1.5tbs lemon juice to skim milk. i got twelve tall muffin biscuits with humongous golden, craggy tops. probably could have made twice as many short biscuits if i wanted to. i would make these for company. very good lookin' biscuits.

Quite good. Crumbly, tasty and moist.

These are delicious and rose up big and fluffy. Didn't use muffin pans but shaped into large round, then cut like pizza slices. Spread them apart on a greased baking sheet. Will definitely recommend these for company.

Really good and simple biscuits, and I'm NOT a biscuit maker. Would have liked a more rounded flavor-garlic, parsley, etc. I'll add that to my remaining butter as I've only had one. Even using salted butter, DON'T skimp on the salt, you need it!

These biscuits are very good. Recommend not baking in muffin pan - they do not expand as well in the pan but cook bigger and fluffier on a baking sheet. Added parsley, salt, garlic powder to the remaining butter to be brushed on the biscuits after baking, received rave reviews.

Tasty, but not really worth all the fat. I like another user's idea to add chopped ham and dill and if I make it again, I'm going to try that modification. I think that would have filled out the recipe a little better. As written, it tasted like it needed something else, something to make it a little more interesting.

Delicious and moist biscuit! I used King Arthur Bread Flour and added another 1/2 cup buttermilk to make the dough sticky. I baked them in a cast-iron muffin pan, and recipe yielded nearly 20 muffins. Butter coating the pan created a much crispier crust than crisco.

The best biscuits ever!

Nice flavor. Made 16 very large muffins. Cooked more quickly in my oven.

When I have made these biscuits, I cube the cheese and add ham and dill. Great breakfast for the drive to work.
