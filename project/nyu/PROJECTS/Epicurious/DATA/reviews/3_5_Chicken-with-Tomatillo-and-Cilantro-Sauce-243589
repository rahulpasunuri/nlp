I made this recipe tonight pared down for 2 people. While I may have made it on the spicy side, it was very good. I did not cook the chicken as long as the recipe intends, that would have made the chicken SO overcooked. I took another's advice and cut the broiled chicken into bite size pieces so that the sauce could have more of an impact on the chicken. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight, and it was my first time ever cooking with tomatillos. The recipe was hit with my friends. I added an extra clove of garlic to the recipe. Instead of chicken breasts I used thighs and legs. I deboned and skinned the thighs, but left the legs as is with bone and skin. My chicken pieces were quite large, so I broiled them 10 minutes on each side. After I moved them to the pan of tomatillo/chili mixture I let the chicken simmer on medium for about 40 minutes to assure the chicken was cooked completely through. I served over a bed of white rice (with butter) and fresh corn. My friend's husband loved it so much he's taking the leftovers for lunch to work tomorrow. This was very fast, easy, inexpensive and delicious. I'll definitely be making it a part of my regular dinner "line-up."

was a little leery of the lack of spices, but this recipe tasted fantastic! I cut up the chicken breasts into inch-thick slices after broiling to allow them to absorb more of the sauce and I dumped all of the juices from the broiler tray into the pan as well. great served over roasted potatoes or even mashed (if you can handle the mix of flavors).

I love roast chicken and I love tomatillos so I don't think for me this recipe could go wrong. It was a tasty and healthy meal which is much needed this time of year. Since I have a lot of tomatillos from the garden in my freezer I'm sure I'll be making this again soon. I also liked the side dish of roasted pumpkin.

wow I LOVE this dish....I make it almost weekly. It's fast, easy, and healthy! Usually I just throw chicken breasts on the grill then slice them before adding to the sauce. The bit of kick this has really sates the appetite. I've substituted 1 jalepeno pepper for the serranos at times. I'll be making this for company over the holidays it's so special. And I think the 'guys' would love it for the Superbowl too!

Easy and good. Very simple and full flavored. Process tomatillos and chilis in advance to save cleanup. Try with Roasted Acorn Squash with Chili Lime Vinagrette (Oct. 2006), Cheddar & Jalapeno Corn Sticks (Feb. 2001), Chocolate-Ancho Crème Brûlée (Sep. 2002), and a margarita.

So... cook chicken breasts for 38 minutes? No thanks, I'll wear my leather on my feet. The sauce, however, is great.

I happened to have a can of tomatillos in my pantry, and when I saw this recipe I thought I could finally use it up. (We've only ever used fresh tomatillos before,) Even with canned tomatillos this recipe was delicious! Since the cilantro was abundant in my garden, I was extra generous and wasn't disappointed. Our meal was served with a side of jasmine parmesan rice and fresh tomatoes, and it was just right. The next time I make this recipe I want to try to add one more serrano pepper to see if the little extra kick makes it even better. Although I was anxious to get rid of that tomatillo can, I might just have to keep another on hand so I can make this recipe at the spur of the moment at another time!

I made this for dinner last night and it was fantastic. I did have to make a minor modification - I forgot the serranos at the store, so I subbed a can of roasted green chilies. Not ideal, but it was still delicious. The tomatillos pureed easily even with their skins intact, and the flavors were so fresh! I served with cumin-scented lentils, and look forward to making this again.

I think the peppers are spicier here in Texas. The dish had great kick and flavor. I did double the cilantro and opted to dice the chicken and add it to the garlic and onions instead of broiling it. It was perfectly fork tender. This one is a keeper.

Good flavor--not as hot as I thought it would be so I would add a little more spice/pepper next time. Served it with roasted butternut squash flavored with cumin and it was great.

VERY good! I pulled off the chicken's skin before I broiled it, which cuts down on the fat. Also, I didn't have any fresh chilis, so I substituted dried a chili. The sauce is great and could be used for almost any meat! I served it with brown rice.
