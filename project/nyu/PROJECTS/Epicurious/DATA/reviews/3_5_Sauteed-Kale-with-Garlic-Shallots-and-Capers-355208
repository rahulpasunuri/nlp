Kale is left out of the ingredient list. For 12 servings I used 2 bunches curly kale. I've made this a few times and its a solid recipe, but I prefer using coconut oil to EVOO since it stands up to heat better and also gives the dish a richness. This is one of our favorites.

The preface to the recipe states that you should "use 3 pounds of Kale about four large bunches." It also advises that any variety of Kale can be used.

This is a solid recipe. My husband and I eat a lot of kale and this will be added to our repertoire.

This was great with brisket and fried potatoes. I never had Kale before as I didn't think I would like it - I was wrong. I will definitely make this again. My guests loved it.

Great with mashed potatoes and brisket. Half butter, half olive oil makes it taste even better.
