This sauce is phenomenal; very singular. Make sure you take the time to find one of the chili pastes listed, as that lended it its very unique flavor. I couldn't find the deep purple potatoes, but used the purple ones from trader joes in the mixed potato bag. Their flesh was a light lavender and still looked strikingly beautiful juxtaposed against the sauce.

I'm raving about the sauce. It's easy and addictive and goes with many things beyond potatoes. The purple potatoes make a striking presentation, but you can use regular potatoes, or boiled or fried yuca, or chayote squash, asparagus, etc. The traditional Peruvian recipe uses potatoes and also adds hard-boiled egg and olives as complements.

Those are purple potatoes, I've seen them a lot in my area recently.
