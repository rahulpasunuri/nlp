I have cooked this and served this many times over the years and it always good. Be sure to have everything prepped because it takes no time to cook.

Not sure if I did something wrong, but dish was not very good. Took suggestions and added extra garlic, shallots, and ginger, but still a little bland. Also used half & half and some broth instead of heavy cream to lighten the recipe, since others had mentioned it, but sauce never really thickened, and was more curtled than creamy. Definitely will not be making it again.

This was terrific but I made some changes as I thought the recipe had some problems. 1) We get good sized sea scallops and three per person (half a pound) works fine. A recipe like this should specify weight rather than quantity due to the varying size. 2) Despite making only enough scallops for two, I made the full amount of the sauce. The excess went on the rice. 3) I used peanut oil. Olive oil makes no sense in this recipe and fights with some of the ingredients. It seems like the de-Asianing of the recipe. 4) Same thing with the wine. There is no reason to use white wine - use Chinese dry rice wine instead. If you can't get that, use sherry, which tastes almost the same. With those changes, it came up tasting like one of the best dishes I've had in a Chinese restaurant.

I have made this several times and it is one of my all time favorites. Very easy to make. I cut polenta into 1 inch thick slices, broil them and serve the scallops and sauce over them.

I would have entered 0 forks if possible, this was flavorless and tasted greasy, fatty, nasty. I followed recipe exactly and couldn't even stand to eat it until I was full. Had to have something else for dinner.

Just made this dish for the first time, and love it! Didn't have any cilantro on hand, but didn't miss it at all. Used double the amount of garlic and green onion, and added a bit of cayenne pepper as another reviewer suggested. Gives it a great kick! Served over Basmati rice, but would double the sauce next time. Great dish!

So easy & tasty. It was a little too creamy for me - perhaps some lemon or half stock, half cream. I will definitely make this again with some tweeking.

Extremely simple but great! Prepared the recipe with my 7 year old daughter. We did not use cream but double the wine (good quality white), ginger, and green onions. We also added shallots to the recipe. Would definitely use again!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but I have to say that it was quite bland. I did substitute the fat free half and half for the whipping cream, but I don't think that was the problem. I think previous reviewers who suggested doubling the garlic and ginger were right. Using the proportions in the recipe (even adding more ginger), the main taste that came through was the cilantro - no ginger or garlic. If I were to make it again (which I probably won't), I would definitely add at least twice the amount of those two things. It was a disappointment - not terrible, just nothing to write home about.

Fantastic! We took a tip from a previous reviewer and added some lemon zest to the sauce. Used cilantro 'from a tube,' which worked beautifully. Just delicious served with Basmati rice. This is our new favorite scallop recipe.

Rating: 3
Yummy combination of flavors. Used scallops from Sam's--hocky puck size. Used less butter to sear. Would decrease cilantro by third and grate ginger, adding to taste (I thought it should be more pronounced). Served on basmati rice with asparagus. My husband wanted to lick the plate (we were out of bread). Outstanding dish!

This is amazing! my first time cooking scallops (followed recipe exactly) and I will definitely make it again! I used Trader Joe's frozen wild Japanese scallops and did a fresh shitake/zucchini/carrot/ginger stirfry w/ lemon cilantro green onion couscous for sides...so delicious and easy, especially if the chopping is done ahead of time!

We loved the taste. My sauce didn't thicken as much as I thought it should, but that should be resolved next time.

Made it with what I had (used parsely at the end and used butter instead of cream) and used 3 cloves of garlic and will use less ginger next time. To be fair, this ginger seemed really strong when I was chopping it. Leave out the cream and add soy sauce and sugar and you've a basic szechaun dish.

This is a house favorite here. I use more garlic, ginger and scallions that called for. The sauce is just enough for two as we add basmati rice, tho.

Rating: 3
Even after doubling the garlic and ginger and adding more white wine, I found this to be a little bland for my taste. It has HUGE potential though and I will make it again with some tweaking. More aromatics, some lemon zest and maybe even a little cayenne for punch. Definitely make it....just adapt for your taste.

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT COMPANY DISH BUT EASY AND QUICK ENOUGH TO PREPARE OFTEN AT HOME. IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE INGREDIENTS READY BEFORE STARTING TO COOK THIS DISH AS IT IS VERY FAST ONCE THE COOKING BEGINS.

My company loved this and even my husband who is not seafood crazy liked it enough to eat it as leftovers the next day. I had the big sea scallops as the bay scallops can get tough really quickly. I doubled the sauce and used it as a salad dressing for the mesculin the scallops were laying on as well as for the scallops. Very Very tasty.

Rating: 4
Love this dish - I've modified it slightly by sauteeing shallots and fennel in butter/olive oil combo in the beginning and adding this in to the sauce with the cream. I also did not add the green onion or cilantro but added sprinkled chopped italian parsely for garnish instead. A great easy one for dinner parties or used as a starter course.

SUPERB!!!!! Perfect as written - would make this a regular dish if the large sea scallops were not so darn expensive, so it will remain on my 'special occasions' list.

This dish was tasty, but was not as good as the Sauteed Scallops with Lemon-Mustard Sauce I tried last week from this website. I used Smart Balance Buttery Spready (it's Trans Fat-Free)instead of the butter,and Land O'Lakes Fat Free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream. I didn't notice any negative effect on the taste, and the substitutions made the recipe healthier.

YUMMY. I followed the recipe fairly closely, I added more ginger and garlic as so many suggested, and didn't have an open bottle of wine so I subbed chicken stock. Both worked well and made a really great dish. This one gets added to the "special" rotation.

This is excellent! I have made ir before following the recipe but I found myself without any heavy cream so I substituted lite coconut milk. I sauteeded some shiitake mushrooms before adding the garlic and ginger and added a tsp of chili-garlic sauce along with the coconut milk. Served with rice.

This was a delicious recipe! My family really loved it. I served it again to some out-of-town guests who raved about it as well. I did substitute fat-free half and half for the whipping cream which worked just fine.

After having made it, I was surprised to see that this recipe was in a June issue of any cooking magazine. All be it delicious, and easy, my husband and I thought it was too rich and heavy for summer. Maybe next time I'll try diluting the cream with miso soup, like one cook suggested.

The scallops were delicious. I used half abd half instead of heavy cream and even substituted some of the half and half with miso soup. ( Just add boiling water to a packet in a mug-very easy) I served the scallops on udon noodles instead of pasta. A very quick dish to make!

This is the best sauce my husband and I have ever had. This recipe is fantastic. We think this sauce would make shoe leather taste good. He and I are on Atkins, so we just had scallops and sauce, but it would be awesome on rice or pasta. I would double the recipe though.

This was very good. We followed the recipe except didn't have enough cream, so used half cream and half milk. It is a very nice and velvety sauce and attractive to serve, and was good dribbled over our rice too! We would make again as is, or even using less cream and maybe some broth as well.

I thought this was okay, although I wouldn't make it again because of its high fat content. Make sure to add some of the pan juices to the cream first, then add the cream.

I don't really like scallops, but this dish was delicious and easy. We were at the beach and could not find rice wine vinegar so we substituted a small amount of lemon juice (about 3/4 tsp). It worked wonderfully. Made the receipe a second time and didn't even bother to look for the rice wine vinegar.

Is very tasty. Make sure to use fresh ingredients. First time to make scallops, and I overcooked a bit, but the sauce was still terrific. I would make more sauce next time.

I turned this into a seafood pasta. Made recipe according to directions, but replaced half of the scallops with shrimp and served over linguine. Serve with a nice crusty roll and salad for a perfect meal! I served this while at the beach and everyone raved. We had some sort of seafood dish every night and this was, by far, the best. Also try the Pan Seared Tuna with Ginger Shiitake Cream Sauce - it is another outstanding recipe. I will definitely be making this again and again and again!!

If you're looking for a low-fat healthy meal, this is not it. But if you want to indulge yourself an absolutely sinful dish, you've the right recipe. This dish is extremely easy to make, and tastes great! I would suggest finding fresh sea scallops, rather than the frozen, it really makes a difference.

this was as good as any restaurant meal if not better. The flavor of the sauce was rich yet not so rich as to take away any of the flavor of the scallops. I didn't serve with rice or any starchy sidedish because of the richness of the main course. Served with a nice simple salad and a healthy green vegetable, this makes a wonderful meal.

This was awesome! Followed recipe to the letter until the end. I was so excited to eat this that I left the cilantro and green onion off! But it was still delicious. Served on top of Israeli toasted pasta (pearl size couscous) and steamed spinach. Can't wait to make it again.

Okay, I started by making this recipe verbatim until i discovered that i didn't have any heavy whipping cream but only skim milk instead!! So I used it and the sauce did not thicken but curdled instead. The sauce was thin and did not stick to anything. I topped basmati rice with the scallops/sauce which was also a mistake because it just looked very bland. However, the ginger did make a pleasant, light flavor in the scallops and my guests did not render this meal a total failure. However, I was disappointed with the turnout which is why i will not be making this dish again.

I served this dish in sea shells as a first course for a very special dinner, and received rave comments!The only change I made was to add a few pieces of lobster which seemed to further enhance the flavors of the scallops and ginger.

I tried this recipe even after reading the previous review, and my husband and I loved it! Perhaps the previous reviewer had used seasoned rice vinegar instead of unseasoned? I almost made that mistake shopping. I used scallops and shrimp, and the shrimp were especially tasty in the sauce. I also threw in some corn I shaved off previously cooked cobs, and they added a complementary sweet crunch to the sauce, and looked festive besides, clinging like little pearls to the shellfish. I served this over rice with grilled asparagus on the side. I might make a little extra sauce next time, but will definitely impress some guests with this soon!
