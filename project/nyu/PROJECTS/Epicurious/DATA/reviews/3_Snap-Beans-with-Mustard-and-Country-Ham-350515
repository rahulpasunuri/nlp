I made it pretty much the same as the recipe. However, I substituted yellow mustard with German whole seed mustard.

I like the mustard glaze, but I will definitely toss in diced, cooked ham at the end next time. I think it could use a little more kick as well. The scallions didn't come through.

To die for!!! Because I couldn't find country ham the week after Canadian thanksgiving, I used 5 slices of cooked turkey bacon and added them in at the end. Also, I forgot about the black pepper. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was a great side to roast chicken.

It's a good, down-home cooking kind of recipe. I was skeptical about the proportion of flour to liquid, and I think I'd back off a little on the flour next time, but otherwise it was quite tasty.

I made this as a thanksgiving side dish for our thanksgiving with a southern twist. The flavor was excellent. I'm making it again for a dinner party this week.
