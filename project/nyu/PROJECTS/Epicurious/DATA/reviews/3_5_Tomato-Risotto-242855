Very good. Fresh tomatoes from the garden made the dish. Skinned and diced tomatoes but didn't bother straining the seeds and juice. Threw away and added a bit of tomatoe paste with first stock addition. Added goat cheese at the end

Utterly delicious if you have ripe, flavorful, preferably organic tomatoes. I used vegetable stock and the dish came out perfect.

I agree that this recipe was a fair amount of work. Noting that off the bat I tried using diced tomatoes, which worked out okay. But I also used vegetable stock. I wouldn't recommend this combination with this recipe, only because it came out a little saltier than desired. I'll definitely try again, and thought it was tasty enough even with the heavy salt flavor, worth a try but maybe not worth all the work initially suggested.

I frequently make risotto, and this recipe seemed interesting. It was time consuming with the tomatoes, and I didn't find it to be that great. I may try to use canned tomatoes next time to further promote the tomato taste, but this wasn't as savory as expected.

Time consuming, but very worth it. I turned it into a risotto frutti de mare by adding mussels, scallops and shrimp at the end. I used mushroom stock instead of chicken. I also added a couple pinches of red pepper flakes and replaced the onion with 5 shallots. I didn't have a sieve so I just threw the blanched, peeled tomatoes in the food processor and pureed until smooth. I did not have any broth left over. The recipe was fantastic! I will definitely be making this again.

This was really good! I added some mascarpone cheese to the risotto and it was even better!

I think the Lemony Risotto recipe is much better. Then again I don't think we like fennel that much. It was good but not amazing. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Lemony-Risotto-with-Asparagus-and-Shrimp-352773

We would have given it 3 1/2 stars; it was very delicious! I got confused by the directions to simmer broth & water. What water? I ended up using about a cup more broth, vegetable, than was called for.

I loved this recipe, the combination of the freshness of the tomatoes with the creaminess of the risotto was excellent. I made it as written except that I didn't have any fennel so I just used a little extra onion. I assume the fennel would change the flavor a little but would also be good. I ended up with more liquid than I needed to cook the risotto.

I agree with the reviewer who found this to be a lot of work for the outcome. It was definitely good, but not amazing. Next time, I might add more spices and perhaps shrimp to make it more substantial

Great way to celebrate tomato season! I also would substitute chicken stock for the water to give a little more depth to the dish. This recipe also is great because you really could add so many other ingredients to fit with any other dishes on your menu... fennel sausage, red peppers...

Delicious. I've never cooked with fennel or made risotto for that matter and it came out perfect. I used heirloom tomatoes from the farmer's market and really good parm. And I actually used all of the stock. I can't wait to make it for guests.

this was excellent though I didn't use any water and instead used all chicken stock. Will definitely make again!!

This was very good but it is a fair amount of work. I would have given it three stars, but my tomatoes were not the best, and I could tell it would have been amazing if they had been really good tomatoes. So I would say make this, but only when you get the good tomatoes.
