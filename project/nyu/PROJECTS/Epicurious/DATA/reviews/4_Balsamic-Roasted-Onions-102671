I make the Balsalmic Glaze with olive oil & honey vs. butter and sugar. Either way, try to keep glaze tart-sweet so can still taste the sweetness of the roast onion.

I made these a few years ago for christmas with a roasted duck and decided to remake them for this thanksgiving in lieu of creamed onions. They really are delicious. It got to the point where I had to stop asking my husband to check on them for me because I discovered he was eating them at high volume each time the door opened. I like someone's suggestion of putting them on a sandwich - maybe beef and smelly cheese on rustic bread with arugula and some oil and vinegar.

My family loves this recipe. Great with steaks or rib roast, or served on roast beef sandwiches. Remember to remove the root ends before serving on sandwiches.

Loved the onions, the balsamic vinegar glaze gave me trouble. What did I do wrong? The butter and sugar would not mix together. In desperation I removed from the heat and added the vinegar. All seemed well. I set it aside to cool. When reheating, the butter separated from the sugar and vinegar. Quickly the sugar and vinegar turned into a hard candy like consistency. Loved the onions like I said, roasted at a lower temp as one reviewer recommended so the onions did not burn. The glaze , for me was inedible.

Ok-it was a two but potential three fork, I'm just wondering if they have the temp listed too high? I found they were starting to burn on the edges, so I turned the oven down to 400. This was ok, I'll give it another try.

I rarely rate a recipe 4 forks, but this is superb! Served with roast tenderloin one night, then a night later used the leftovers atop crostini with goat cheese as an appetizer. Thankfully there was even more leftovers so we could have the appetizer version again the next day. A definite keeper!

Wow -- this is truly one of the best recipes ever. I made it and served it with mean (good) but then served the leftovers with goat cheese and crackers an an appetizer (even better!) My husband loves the onions on sandwiches and wraps for lunch. This is really a winner..

I would make this again in a heartbeat! Even substituting Splenda for the sugar did not detract from the recipe significantly.

Delicious! Someone, please let the last reviewer know that she should cut the root end off before cooking.

I've made these several times and everyone loves them. They are easy and delicious, but they aren't that attractive after they've been roasted -- they tend to fall apart and the root ends look unappetizing. I would make them with whole peeled cippolines instead.

Made exactly as written (actually, made 1/2 recipe). No changes needed. These are incredibly easy and fantastic!

Excellent! Definitely adds to the beef tenderloin. Based on reviews, I made it the day before and it reheated beautifully.

This dish may have been the biggest hit of my Christmas dinner, even though the main course was beef tenderloin. I was a bit worried that the onions were charred but they tasted fine with the balsamic sauce, which would probably be good over carrots too. This was a really easy and yummy dish!

Made it as it but a day earlier. Reheated well and then topped with glaze. Very good! People who don't like red onions well were eating them. Great with the beef tenderloin!

Made these onions as part of a Christmas dinner. Onions and glaze were prepared a day ahead of time and refrigerated. Reheated well. I had other recipes competing for the oven at crunch time, so I reheated the onions first. By dinnertime, they were warm and approaching room temperature but that did not detract from their flavor. The onions darkened significantly by the time they were finished cooking. Don't worry--the taste is rich and delicious. Once put onthe onions, the balsamic glaze was surprisingly subtle. Very nice dish that I recommend. Special, easy, and forgiving

Had my doubts about this recipe as it cooked. When I drizzled on the glaze, the onions became really dark and looked burned (they weren't). However, the raves from everyone proved these onions a success and there wasn't one left. It was indeed yummy and a perfect side for the tenderloin.

Easy, elegant and goes so well with the Tenderloin recipe in the same issue (dec 99). Everyone loves these

These onions are so easy and so delicious! Try the recipe with cippolline onions to serve for a special meal .

This mixed with the Pork Chops with Ham Vinagrette is the best thing ever. The sauces complement each other so weel, I can't believe it was so good. Our friends called it "The best sauce Chris has ever made."

I made these for our Christmas Eve dinner to accompany Beef Tenderloin and everyone LOVED them!!! I made the day before, and then threw them in a sauce pan, added the glaze and heated over low heat. YUM!

I did not rate this recipe, assuming I must have messed up big time since so many others thought it deserved 3 or 4 forks. My entire Christmas dinner menu came from the epicurious site. Six dishes...5 merited raves...1 (this one) was politely ignored. I scraped uneaten onion off every plate! Except for that, everybody had 'licked the platter clean'. What do you suppose I did wrong??

I really liked this recipe. I made them a day in advance of our Thanksgiving meal, and they reheated beautifully! My mom wants them every year now!

Rating: 3
I made this for friends accompanied by barbecued spareribs and everyone loved it (including my finicky husband). The only mistake I made was trimming the root ends too much so that the onions separated into ribbons instead of remaining intact. I won't make that mistake again. It will be a welcome addition to my Thanksgiving menu - and a lot easier than creamed onions!

I made it and loved it, including as leftovers. But my family -- confirmed vegetable-shunners -- turned away from it. Don't make it for people unwilling to be adventurous with vegetables; just give them green beans.

Simple with great flavor and can be made ahead. I served this to guests last night and we all loved the flavor. It was an accompaniment to a beef tenderloin recipe.

We all loved this recipe and I have made it several times. I think it is better done ahead of time and reheated at the last minute.

Was alright, but not great. Forgot to heed the warnings of others regarding the oven temperature and basically charred half of the onions. Good taste, though, but I would need to work on getting them just right and don't really love onions enough to put in the effort.

Very sweet. A big hit with the beef with horseradish and garlic crust. Only regret-should have made more!

I also served this dish with beef tenderloin and the Gratin of Yukon Potatoes with Bacon and Arugula. I had a little difficulty getting the sauce thickened; watch it closely. It definitely worked as a holiday dish, as it could be made successfully the day before. The aroma of the roasting onions was fabulous.

The comments are true, even people who did not usually like onions ate this dish, so you cannot make too much. We served it w/ a standing rib roast. If you are making it for a party, I highly recommend roasting the onions the day before since they generate a lot of smoke.

Served with a standing rib roast, this was a well recieved side. I did have to cut back the temperature because I was having a hard time controling the browing of the edges.

Easy, yummy and different. Great with meat (I served roast pork loin). Definitely on my side dishes to remember list. I actually like a few pieces to be charred (great caramelized flavor).

These onions were wonderful and my dinner guests could not get enough of them!I served them with the herb and garlic crusted beef, which also received a standing ovation.

These were very flavorful and extremely easy!! I served them with marinated beef tips as a side dish and everyone loved them. The only thing I would do differently is not roast them at such a high temperature. I felt they could have used a lower temp as I did burn the outside of some. Other than that they were terrific and definitely will be used here again!!!

I made these for Christmas along with a Rib roast and they were excellent!! We had to lower the temperature of the oven for another side dish to 350 degrees for 1/2 hour and they STILL came out delicious! I appreciate that kind of flexibility in a recipe.

These onions were terrific and very easy! As the instructions in the magazine suggested, I did roast the onions and made the balsamic glaze a day before our dinner party. Neither the flavor nor texture suffered from making ahead and it only took 10 minutes or so to reheat them in the oven in the same glass casserole dish I used to store them overnight! I would recommend them highly! DELICIOUS- all our guests raved and asked for seconds!
