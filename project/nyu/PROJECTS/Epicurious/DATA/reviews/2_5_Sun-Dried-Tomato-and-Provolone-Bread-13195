How disappointing! Given all the tasty ingredients, was expecting a much more flavourful, lighter and moister bread. This was sadly lacking in flavour and the texture was very odd/strange - like a dry dense cake or a heavy stale scone. Have to agree with the previous reviewers - don't waste your time and effort on this one!

I would reword this bread - "Long haul for a short slide". Lots of steps - including boiling two cloves of garlic for 15 minutes - for what is essentially a quick bread. Not worth the time.

This came out like a soda bread or a cake - not what I was expecting. But I guess if there's no yeast... that's what you get. I was hoping for a more moist bread.
