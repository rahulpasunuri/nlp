I used this vinaigrette as a marinade for Grilled Sturgeon. I then boiled the marinade to use as a sauce for the fish. It was by far one of the most delicious fish dishes I have ever tasted.

This is a great vinaigrette--Very versatile and yummy. I wish people wouldn't review recipes when they don't have a clue what they're talking about. IT IS NOT A SALAD! It's the DRESSING for the salad--get it? Vinaigrette?

What a wonderful vinaigrette! My wife and I have been making this dressing for four years and still love it! We use it as an everyday dressing for red leaf salad. I don't know about using it in pasta and of course it is too much olive oil if one were to eat the vinaigrette as a salad, but it is an amazing dressing!

I have made this recipe many times. Instead of using Bulgar, I use pasta mixed with steams spinach. Guests love it!!!!

Though I have not yet tried this recipe, I think that it should be noted that it is meant to be a dressing for a vegetable and bulgur salad. I don't believe that it was intended as a dish on its own, as was suggested by previous reviewers.

This recipe, as many others,has too much olive oil. In this day and age of lighter cooking, 3/4 cup oil for such a small quantity of tomatoes is just too much. 1/3 cup would be sufficient
