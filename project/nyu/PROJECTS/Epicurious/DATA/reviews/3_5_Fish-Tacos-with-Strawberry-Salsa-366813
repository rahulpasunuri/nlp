These just didn't have decent flavor. Two things I did that compromised the recipe. Firstly, I used organic corn sprouted tortillas from Whole Foods. Flavorless and not soft but not crunchy. I really should have used those soft white tortillas you find in fish shack eateries. Secondly, I sprinkled the cumin on the skin of the halibut but then removed the skin (to reduce the fat in the recipe). The fish had no flavor because I stupidly disposed of the cumin layer, which was the only seasoning for the fish. I need to find a different fish taco recipe, I think I'll pick one using crema and other traditional Mexican ingredients.

Delicious! I substituted tilapia, flour tortillas, dried chives, mesclun salad, and added chopped fresh avocado. Just be sure to make the salsa ahead of time to allow the dried chives to rehydrate.

These are delicious, I like the reviewer below's suggestions although I followed the recipe exactly with cod as my fish. Also, the picture here is not what the tacos end up looking like. For one it doesn't not look like napa cabbage in the picture, there are no chives, and there is no jalapeno in the salsa! And what is the white sauce in the picture?

I made a bunch of variations- used tilapia (herb and butter encrusted) as that's what the fish counter had. Cooked the tilapia in a skillet and the tortillas in the broiler. Cut out the jalapeno since I don't handle spice well, and swapped fresh cilantro in for chives. Upped the lemon juice to at least 2 tablespoons, and trust me one pint of strawberries is more than enough. I also added half an avocado, cubed, into the dressing. And used fresh spinach in place of the napa cabbage. Alright, so I basically remade this recipe- it was a good starting point for something utterly fantastic. The leftovers might not make it past breakfast...
