Made this without green beans, without pepperoncini, with tiny yellow potatoes that I didn't have to cut up, and extra parsley. Still delicious! (I've made it as directed before, also great.) My boyfriend didn't love it, though, so I think the miso with the potato is not for everyone.

I use this sauce for dipping artichokes too. Very nice.

This recipe is delicious and so incredibly healthy. I left out the pepperoncini and it was still very flavorful.

This dressing is delicious, not too salty, not too sweet. Made it exactly as called for.

I love miso but really did not like this recipe - it just tasted strange with the potatoes.

This has just become my favorite potato salad! I made it for Cinco de Mayo, so I added the sauce from a can of chipotles to the dressing and added a little more miso, plus doubled the citrus. I also doubled the entire recipe so I had leftovers for salads. Wow! The smokeyness was wonderful on the potatoes. I used the tiny purple spud for festive color...wow...they were PURPLE!! Everyone was dumbfounded! I've even served the salad hot and it was a hit.

I lifted the dressing and made it only. Forget the potato salad - just make the dressing and drink it straight. I'm giving it 3 forks even though I haven't bothered with the potatoes. I'm a huge fan of miso dressings and this is the best one I've come across. I substituted cranberry juice for orange juice last night and used red miso, and it was FABULOUS.

I didn't have parsely so I skipped that. To save time I had to make the dish the night before my picnic. That was a mistake. The miso dressing tasted funny when it's cold, almost raw. I liked it better when it was on warm potatoes. Not a dish I would recommend if you are short on time.

This salad has a really good flavor and texture. The fresh citrus makes the dish. I didn't use the pepperoncini ,and I substituted the parsley with some scallion.

Great complement to seared Tuna w/ Miso sauce. Used cilantro instead of parsley. Sauce has a great texture. Very good. Didn't use peppers, thought they would clash - added some rice vinegar and sherry cooking wine instead.

excellent. I think the best thing is that I try stay clear of mayonnaise on food ( fat ) and this was literally unreal. Kudos to the originator.

I'm always looking for new ways to use basic Japanese cooking ingredients I always have around. The dressing for this salad is extremely flavorful, with a great balance of sweet/tart/salty flavors. I used walnut oil for extra depth. I did NOT use peperoncini, as I always find their vinegary taste too overwhelming. A little shredded pickled ginger (sushi-style) adds a similar,gentler note and a little color contrast.
