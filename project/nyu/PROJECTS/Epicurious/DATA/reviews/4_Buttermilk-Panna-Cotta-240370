I followed the directions exactly except for using the zest of a whole lemon. I wanted a stronger lemon flavor to compliment the fresh blueberries that I was using on top. Perfect! Did not need more gelatin! Made it the morning of the dinner party. Set up beautifully.

Great flavor but VERY runny. Most panna cotta recipes call for more gelatin but I read the reviews for this recipe and trusted the reviews. Wrong! A big disappointment at my dinner party.

I make the recipe exactly as written. I wait until it has cooled and use a collander to pour about 2 T into tall shot glasses. I let cool for a good 4 hours and then put just a bit of chopped kiwi, mango or strawberry on top. I also make a coulis (cooked and strained strawberry or mango) and put just a bit on top to give the fruit flavor and color. I have not tried to invert these from the ramekin but just serve at a cocktail party in the glasses with tiny spoons. People love itl

Took a chance on a box of vegan gelatin i found in the cupboard and used the recommended 1 1/2 tsp. Turned out too runny to unmold from the ramekins. Next time will try regular gelatin and possibly increase the amount as others have. Infused the cream with fresh basil, strained before adding gelatin. Good summer flavor!

This dish is exceptional! I had buttermilk left over from making biscuits and so I thought I'd try this recipe out. I prepared it as the dessert at a dinner party and it was incredibly well received. I served it without any topping and it was wonderful, but I think it would be better with some sort of sauce (chocolate, caramel, fruit compote, etc.).

If you hate reviews that describe major changes to the recipe, please move along! I used 2 cups organic heavy cream and one cup buttermilk, and I used the whole packet of gelatin (about 1 tablespoon), softened in 3 tablespoons water. Chilled in 4 individual serving dishes for about 6 hours, the panna cotta was firm but still silky. Served it with pears sauteed in butter and brown sugar to make a butterscotch sauce. Fantastic!

Fantastic recipe! I have made this many times and I follow the recipe exactly. The texture and flavor are perfect. I don't bother unmolding, and just served with fresh berries on top. Sometimes I substitute the cream with an equal part milk. The result tastes just as good but the texture is slightly less silky. It's also easy to overheat the milk, so more care must be taken.

I love this recipe soooo much! I have made it a bunch of times. Today I will make it as a goats milk panna cotta, substituting goats milk yogurt from Whole Foods for the buttermilk. I can't wait to taste it.

Made this with strawberry Kefir, to great effect. It is a delicious use for our buttermilk substitute after a good pancake breakfast.

Very much like a vanilla yogurt flavor. I didn't make the fruit compote, but instead roasted figs with honey and a bit of olive oil and served warm aside the panna cotta with a pistachio gelato from the supermarket. Good.

Really really nice - not too sweet and really easy to prepare. Perfect for entertaining since they can be made a day in advance. If you cannot find gelatin powder (difficult in Denmark) then 1 teaspoon translates to 2 sheets of gelatin. Just soften in cold water for 5 minutes and stir into the warm liquid. I served with red pomegrate seeds and blueberries - very light and delicous. Will I make it again - yes - actually this weeked :-)

I found this recipe to be PERFECT as-is. I wouldn't change a thing. I made it exactly according to the directions and let it set up overnight. The texture was amazing and the flavor superb! I can't imagine changing a thing. My favorite panna cotta recipe to date!!

ATTENTION!!!!! Use the original gelatin amount. Panna Cotta is not creme brule and should melt in your mouth with little resistance. I made the mistake of adding the extra as others have suggested and decided to remake it the next day. Perfect!!!! Super recipe!!!!! It's the easy to make desert that I like to make for dinner parties. I would be careful with compotes. If you use too much, they will overpower the taste of the panna cotta. A spoonful will do. A little mango sorbet goes well.

yum! This was delicious! I made it with 2 tsp of gelatin instead of 1 1/2- all the other panna cotta recipes seemed to call for more, and most reviewers either doubled it or wished they had. I figured 2 tsp would be a good compromise for my first attempt. It maintained the delicacy of texture, but allowed it to firm up well. I also didn't spray with PAM and simply served in the ramekins, and I made a blueberry compote from this website to serve on top. Delicious!

I'm always looking for ways to use the extra buttermilk and now I have found it. This is a great desert and now I will be buying buttermilk just for this recipe. Loved it.

Very delicious! It was very easy to make. I had 1 cup of buttermilk leftover from a different recipe, so I halved the recipe and made three panna cottas. The only change I made was slightly increasing the amount of gelatin based on other reviews, and it was the perfect consistency. For half the recipe I used 1 tsp. gelatin rather than 3/4 tsp. I served it with a kumquat-blackberry sauce, because I also had leftover kumquats. Yum!

Made this even lighter using lowfat milk & a little half & half - still very delicious. The buttermilk and lots of vanilla were a great combination

Great recipe. I used larger amount of gelatin as suggested in reviews, skipped spray and product worked out fine. I would have preferred the original gelatin amount and a more delicate product that could be served in the custard cup.

Fantastic. Such a break from normal desserts. I agree with other reviewers it could set up a little better and I will use more gelatin next time. I served it with fresh blueberries and raspberries that had been soaking in tequila. Great sweet-bitter-cold-warm sensations.

This was delicious and I will make it again. It is a fast and easy dessert. I prefer the Strawberry Panna Cotta recipe on this site, however. I added an entire packet of gelatin based on other reviews (that was perfect). I had trouble unmolding them. In addition, I thought that the nonstick vegetable spray added a bit of flavor. Next time I will not worry about unmolding them and will serve them in the ramekins. a great dessert for a summer party using fresh berries with a little sugar and Grand Marnier.

It was delicious, but 1-1/2 t. of gelatin was not sufficient. I found it to be a bit runny. Next time I will try 1 package of gelatin.

Great recipe!! Served just the panna cotta with a fresh ruby grapefruit granita added to the top after unmolding. (see "granitas" and substitute grapefruit for the tangerine juice). Received some seriously entusiastic reviews from my guests for about 15 minutes of total effort!

I've experimented with quite a few panna cotta recipes, and I found this buttermilk one very good. Proportions are right, sweet but not too sweet. Berries weren't in season, so I took some pomegranate jam and water and reduced it to a glaze to spoon over. I was impatient and served it at 3 and a half hours and it wasn't set yet. So you really do need at least four hours. Otherwise, a great buttermilk panna cotta!

So easy to make for something so excellent. I use blueberries instead because I don't like like raspberries because of its graininess.

Very simple and delicious! Went very well with frozen raspberries.

This has been my favorite version of pannacotta for years.
