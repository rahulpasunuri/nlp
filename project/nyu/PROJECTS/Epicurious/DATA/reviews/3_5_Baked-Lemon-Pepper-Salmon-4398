Great recipe! I've been making this for a number of years. My only change is to use salmon with the skin on, and place it on the foil without the oil spray. When baked, slide a spatula between the skin and the fillet, and voila - skinless salmon! For a company dish, I use skinless salmon and wrap it all in puff pastry dough instead of foil. A very elegant presentation.

Loved It! Easy and perfect for guests. I did not use lemon pepper as other's had not. I substituted with some fresh lemon juice, lemon zest and cracked pepper. Great Flavor!

I made this and it just wasn't that tasty. It might be because I baked it in the oven at the same time as a stuffing which required a lower temperature. I think it would be better if the toppings were sauted first.

This is a real keeper! Easy, fast, no exotic ingredients along with being low cal, low carb and low fat. We roasted some asparagus using the lemon pepper seasoning as a side.

Great weeknight salmon recipe. i make this every week. i use onions if i dont' have shallots and its still wonderful.

This is a good salmon recipe. Delicious served with rice, using the juices to pour over the rice.

This was so easy and delicious. My husband and I gobbled it up. Like other reviewers, I used fresh lemon zest and fresh pepper in place of lemon-pepper seasoning. I also used yellow onion in place of the shallots, and salmon "steaks" in place of a fillet. It was so flavorful. I roasted some zucchini and yellow squash on the pan right next to the foil packet, made some couscous, and voila--a very good and easy dinner.

Great recipe, but like others I skipped the lemon pepper and used the juice & pulp from 3 large lemons. Fresh ground pepper & sea salts make a difference too. This is a family favourite and very easy to make.

I made this for a luncheon and would definitely do again. I used lemon zest and fresh grated pepper in lieu of lemon pepper seasoning. It was easy to prepare in advance, wrap in foil and refrigerate until ready to bake. I solved the appearance problem by serving it with a white wine sauce made from the same flavors: shallots, dill, lemon, wine, butter and some capers.

I think I'll try this again without the lemon-pepper seasoning (or perhaps mine was too old - the flavor seemed a bit overpowering). Using a little fresh lemon zest sounds like a good idea. The ease of the dish was great!

wonderful and moist salmon recipe. full of flavor

I've made this dish 20 or more times and people just love it. So it doesn't look that good, then make it look good as I have. Try adding more capers if the flavor is soso. great dish going to use it again this weekend.

I busted this out for my girlie in like 30 minutes and she was all "daaaaamn, diggitus! this be some fine, fine fish!!" and I was all "check it: I threw this sucker together my OWN bad self, ya dig??" and yeah, we did it and we'd do it again

I don't like to strike a negative chord, but I wasn't crazy about this. It tasted fine, but didn't look that good. I certainly wouldn't make it for company.

Made it almost exactly as recipe states -- didn't have lemon pepper so subsituted regular pepper & lemon peel. Made it the night before, and served at room temperature with more fresh deal at brunch. Wonderful!

Rating: 3
Surprisingly excellent for its simplicity. The strong, bright flavors of the capers and shallots together are a wonderful with the richness of salmon. I didn't have lemon-pepper, so I used grated lemon peel, salt, and pepper to make my own. Cooked it for 20 minutes then let it rest in the foil for another five before serving -done perfectly. For a side, I roasted green and red peppers in olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the same sheet for the same amount of time - a nice contrasting sweetness to the sharp fish garnish. There were very few cooking juices in the foil so don't rely on them to flavor a starch side. Would definitely make again.

This was suprisingly good. I thought the salmon would be too flavorful for the dill/shallots/capers but I was quite wrong. I loaded up on the latter and completely forgot the lemon pepper but it was outstanding and powerfully flavored.

Prior to placing the shallot mixture on top of the salmon, I marinated the fish with lemon juice and the lemon pepper for about 20 mins. My family loved this recipe and I recommended it to other family members and friends.

This is an recipe with a simple preparation, using ingrediens commonly found in ones kitchen. Using a foil packet means there are no pans to clean afterwards. It is uncommonly moist and very flavorful. I would recommend it for an every day family meal.

As others have said, this is a great weeknight meal. It is quick and easy. I used fresh lemon and ground pepper instead of the l/p seasoning. This recipe has a nice delicate flavor that doesn't overwhelm the salmon. That said, it isn't "wow", just "quite good" and superfast.

Simple and delicious. I rinsed the capers as suggested by another cook and it turned out perfectly.

This is perfect for a weeknight. It had a lot of flavour, especially considering how few ingredients were needed. Preparation is effortless--if you can chop a shallot, you are halfway there.

a nice simple recipie, I substituted parsley because I had some fresh. maybe it would be better with dill, but it seemed to miss something. wine might help as someone suggested here.

This dish is wonderful and relatively easy to make. My wife is not a great fan of fish but she had three servings. I topped the salmon with fresh lemon slices. For the rub I sauted the shallots in butter for couple of minutes and mix it with fresh dill plus dried dill weed, 1 Tsp of Cajun powder spice, 1 Tsp of Garlic powder, added couple extra dashes of salt and fresh ground black pepper and just 1 Tsp of caper before rubbing it onto the salmon. I also inserted fresh slices of garlic into the salmon. My wife and I are not used to the saltiness and the flavor of the caper so I did not use the recommended amount but we do love garlics. For the spice, I used the Lemon-Pepper with garlic and onion (available at any spice rack!) My in-law was amazed that my wife would enjoy fish that I cooked and my two daughters just kept asking for more. I will definitely make this dish again.

I made this dish for a small dinner party, and everyone loved it. The capers and shallots added a nice flavor to the salmon, and the lemon pepper was just spicy enough so that we didn't need extra pepper.

This recipe was quick and tasted pretty good. I consider it a good week-night dinner. I wouldn't serve this for guests, as it tasted a little too "low fat" for me. When cooking for guests, I prefer to cook something a little richer. However, I will make this dish again sometime because it was so easy. If you are looking for another very easy, yet delicious, salmon dish I recommend the roasted rosemary salmon with onions and lemons - simply fabulous!

My son, Matthew, found this recipe and luckily we had the ingredients to prepare it that night. We love this dish and try to make it at least once a week. It's wonderful. The only change we made is to use lemon juice instead of lemon-pepper seasoning.

Wonderful recipe - very easy, very attractive, especially if made with a thin slice of lemon on each portion. It's delicious hot or cold and is one of my favorite company dishes. I skip the butter, use fresh lemon instead of lemon-pepper seasoning, and sometimes substitute minced red onion for the shallots.

I do not cook, but this was easy and delicious. My boyfriend and I both thought it was magnificent. No dill or cappers, because I don't like them. Served with rife pilaf and sauteed asparagus, quick and easy.

This dish was incredibly easy and it was wonderful. The lemon pepper wasn't very strong, so you may want to try a little more. I also like garlic, so we added more than the recipe called for and it turned out great!

This was easy from start to finish and tasted great. The fish stays very moist and the flavor is nice, compatible with different side dishes. Good summer dish....will probably make again.

This dish always gets rave reviews. I use a combination of chopped shallots, garlic, and sweet onions, rather than straight shallots. Also, my lemon-pepper seasoning is quite salty, so I cut back to 1 teaspoon rather than the 1 tbsp called for in the recipe.

This is a great recipe. Everyone loved it. The fish was moist and tender. I made one changee to the recipe; I substituted the juice of one whole lemon (I just squeezed it over the fish)and fresh ground pepper for the lemon pepper seasoning.

I've made this several times with good results. The salmon comes out moist which I've found it difficult to do with other recipes. Tried the fresh lemon and corse ground pepper. Good! I'll try another reviewers suggestion next time and try adding some red pepper.

Wow! This turned out to be one of the best fish dishes I have ever had (my company loved it, too!) However, I substituted to lemon pepper seasoning for fresh lemon juice and cracked pepper, and omitted the oil (you really don't need it with the butter in there. Overall - it was fantastic!

Never have I been praised so much as when I made this recipe! It was the most flavorful salmon I have had. I did make a few changes however: I added 1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped, to the caper mixture. Also instead of lemon pepper I poured the juice of 1/2 lg. lemon atop the fillet, then added 1 TBLS cracked pepper (before adding caper mixture). My family was in awe over the flavor and presentation. I served it with the baby carrot & asparagus recipe that is also in food.epicurious.
