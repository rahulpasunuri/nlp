This is a great idea for a light coleslaw. But...the recipe for the Lexington BB "sauce" is way too overpowering and way too much for what you need for the slaw. I suggest you take no more than 1/2 cup of the vinegar and add the rest of the ingredients to your own taste. Or, you could even start with a high grade aged balsamic and wouldn't need to add any sugar at all. Best advice on this one is to experiment.

I was looking for a no mayo cole slaw recipe for a catering job I was doing. This is different, but it is very tasty.

Very spicy, but tasty.(cut down on the red pepper flakes in the barbecue sauce recipe)
