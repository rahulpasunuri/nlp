I LOVED it! We accidentally froze some of it and it made a terrific sorbet. If you're not a big ginger fan, use powdered or ginger juice instead of the candied variety.

i'm not sure why the other reviewers hated this sauce but my guests and I loved it. we served it as a parfait layered with ricotta whipped cream and alternated with the passion fruit caramel sauce (also on this site) and some fresh raspberries and blueberries. it was delicious. I did alter the recipe some. I added mango nectar, some lemon juice, and star anise to it and cooked it down before pureeing it so it was more like a fruit coulis.

You got to be kidding?I thought this would be better than the stuff you get in a jar.I'll stick to the jar stuff.

I have to agree with below -- this really disappoints (and I spent lots of time fiddling with the ingredients trying to improve it!) Stick with sliced fresh mangoes.

BLAH, this recipe just wasn't what I imagined. It's boring and would suggest using something zippier with the cake. Also unless you really like ginger, omit it because even a little really overpowers the mango flavor.
