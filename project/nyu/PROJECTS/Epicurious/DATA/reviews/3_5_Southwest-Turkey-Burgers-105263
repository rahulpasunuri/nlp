I am always trying to find ways to zip up chicken and turkey, since that's all I can eat. I made a huge batch of these -- with two pounds of ground turkey, essentially quintupling all of the ingredients, following the recipe to the letter. The chipotle peppers really made the dish. I mixed it up in the morning so that the seasonings and meat could marinate. Cooked them in the broiler, since it's too cold for grilling, and served them with cheddar cheese, guacamole and a delicious salad. Makes about 12 burgers, so we now have 10 in the freezer for easy dinners in the future.

Love this recipe, but I tinker will all recipes. I used this same basic recipe for grilling a whole turkey breast.

We make these burgers all the time, especially when we have lots of cilantro from the organic farm. They are best with ground turkey thighs (rather than breast meat). My husband doesn't like guacamole, so we usually serve these with roasted red pepper hummus. FYI -- the extra canned chilies keep FOREVER in the fridge, so don't think you have to toss them if you don't you use a whole can.

These have become a staple in our house all year round. Excellent flavor, and definitely healthier than regular beef burgers. We add sliced avocado and chipotle mayo (mayo, lime juice, cilantro, chipotle peppers and adobo sauce... yum!) and serve on onion rolls. Very easy to make on a busy night when you don't have much time to cook.

This is wonderful ! Not usually a fan of ground turkey but the spiciness piqued my interest. I used onion powder instead of the green onions and added garlic powder. Served over a bed of romaine/iceberg with grape tomatoes, ranch and salsa on top.

This recipe is a hit at our house! Even my husband, who is not a fan of ground turkey, liked this. I have made them several times and have adapted it to our taste. Instead of just cumin I use a McCormick's southwest blend spice. I usually cook these on in the house on my grill pan and they come out great. Make extra to freeze for another night!

Delish. The chipotle adds a nice kick. For a moist burger, be sure to avoid ground turkey made from "all breast meat." You want a mix of dark and white for more fat and flavor. And for even more spice, try topping these with the chipotle mayo from the "turkey wraps with chipotle mayo" recipe on this site. Yum.

Very yummy. Didn't have any cumin (don't like it anyway). I'll be making it again soon.

This was very good...It was too cold to grill so I just prepared the meat in a skillet. Good, Fast and Easy

Make this without the tortilla wrap because we are on the low carb diet. I thought the cilantro, chipotle and cumin were good, I would probably add more cumin and some chili powder next time. I think it would have been tastier had we been able to add the tortilla and guacamole. Want to try the mayo refered to by another reviewer. Good way to use ground turkey, which is not a family favorite. Best recipe so far for ground turkey is the asian turkey lettuce wraps also on this site.

Cilantro and chili give it a nice flavor. After grilling, I put the the burgers in the tortillas with some shredded cheese, wrapped each in foil and left them on the grill for another minute to heat the tortillas and melt the cheese. Served it with the mayo mix from "Scallop and Shrimp Fritters with Chipotle Mayonnaise." (This mayo mix is excellent, very simple, and I'm using it as a condiment on everything now!)

Great weeknight meal! We put them in regular hamburger buns, added sharp cheddar cheese and iceberg lettuce for added crunch, and a 1/2 teaspoon of chilli powder. I can't wait to eat the extra ones in the freezer.

We really loved these burgers! They were spicy without being too hot but I did alter the amounts - I doubled the amount of turkey but only made 1 1/2 times the other amounts. Very happy with the results - the spices and herb weren't too overpowering.

An amazing recipe. Everyone loved them. The cilantro was a delicious addition to the burgers. It took me awhile to find a latin market that carried chipotle peppers, but was well worth the wait. Definately going to make them again....soon!!!

This is a great weeknight dish. It's easy health and tastey. We skip the tortilla's and eat them on whole wheat hamburger buns and add soma jalepeno jack cheese while they are on the grill. I would highly recommend this.

I have been making this recipe for a year now and my kids (college age) love it. I am making it again today to freeze and send to college with my son!!! He and all his friends love the spicyness of the recipe!!! To make things a little easier I often make them round so that they work with regular hamburger rolls.

Great way to add flavor to turkey burgers. We make these regularly and keep a few pre-formed burgers in the freezer for quick meals. We make them round and use with standard buns (or English muffins) and condiments. Also add extra chipotle - about 1 T. Combining the extra lean and dark ground turkey cuts the fat but keeps the burgers juicy.

We love this recipe - it's very easy and flavorful. We add cheese to them while on the grill. I think they are even better the next day - the flavors have a chance to "get together". It's a great meal to make for a summer bbq.

Did not like this recipe at all. Made it exactly as described but found it boring and tasteless.

I think this recipe is great. I love the chipotle chilies.

Nice change of pace from hamburgers or tacos. I'd like some suggestions as to how to kick up the flavor a bit, though. Also, the burgers came out a little dry, but then I've never cooked with ground turkey before. Will make again, though; the additions of guac and salsa made the taste worthwhile.

This was quite tasty, plus it was very quick and easy to make. We will definitely be making this again.

Very easy -- skipped guacamole. Our middle school son had two! Shapped the burgers as hot dogs -- they fit in the torilla easier.
