Do not compare this pizza to chicago style, the crust is all wrong. I'll never try this again!

This recipe was Ok, but only Ok. It did not taste like Chicago-style pizza--the crust was too fluffy, and Chicago deep-dish pizzas have a fantastic heavy crust. The toppings were good (although I think next time I would use regular sausage...I like my pizza to be unhealthy without compromise :)
