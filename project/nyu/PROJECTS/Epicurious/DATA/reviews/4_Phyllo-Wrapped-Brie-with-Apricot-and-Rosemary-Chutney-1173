I love this recipe and have made it many times to rave reviews. But last night was an evening for special friends, and I decided to modify it as a reviewer suggested by cutting the brie in half and putting chutney in the middle. HUGE MISTAKE. Because the cheese was cut, it leaked out of the phyllo, onto the baking sheet and into the oven. What an awful, smoky, smelly mess! Great recipe, but be careful with changing it. Learn from my mistake.

This dish was really beautiful looking and I had high hopes for it. Upon tasting it however, I decided I am not a fan of the chutney. I usually LOVE chutney but this was sub-par. The flavor was somewhat sweet but mostly it tasted of cooked onions which are ok but too much for this dish. I'll probably make it again using a different chutney. The other thing to mention is that the chutney recipe made like 5x the necessary amount. Now I have a whole huge container left over, and I'll probably end up tossing it because it was my least favorite part of the dish. If you do make this, definitely cut the chutney recipe down to 1/4 and you'll still have plenty.

Score!I needed an outstanding appetizer for a Super Bowl party attended by foodies, and this was a hit! Not only was this recipe scrumptious but flexible enough to allow for variations:the dimensions of the phyllo were not the same so the cheese was wrapped differently and I did not have time to chill the chutney or cheese per the recipe. (Used freezer instead.) Instead of the rose, I rolled up 2 "snakes" of phyllo to shape a football outline and put some chutney in the middle for contrast. Very nice presentation, if I must say so myself! Judging from the reaction, I will be bringing this to all future Super Bowl parties.

A-MAZING! This chutney is to-die-for. I made it for a party last night and people couldn't get enough. I think I will use this for thanksgiving turkey, like tpuntel mentioned in the 11/8/09 review (btw, is that you kim and tom?). I used the chutney on just a plain cut of brie, no phyllo, and it was wonderful!

This was a wonderful recipe. I had an evening party were I was mostly to serve desserts. I had a cookie and cheesecake table. Last minute I decided to have a cheese plate just in case someone craved something salty. I found this recipe and after reading all the reviews I went for it. It was the hit of the party. I did make a few changes...after reading that someone soaked the apricots in port, I thought of doing the same but used muscat instead. I also cut the brie in half (horizontally) to stuff some chutney in the middle, poured the rest of the chutney on top and then wrapped it in the phyllo. The outcome was fantastic! I served it with apples and sliced baguette. Everyone seemed to like it with bread the best. Great recipe, I will certainly make it again :)

This and the Spicy Pumpkin Soup with Mexican Cream & Toasted Pepitas are 'must-haves' for our Thanksgiving Dinner -- not even turkey is on the required list! I usually serve both for a light lunch before our dinner. I know it's a time-consuming recipe; but making the chutney is so worth the effort and the leftovers are yummy with turkey the next day. If you want a truly awesome variation, go to the reader review by Michelle on 9/27/01. She mentions soaking the apricots in brandy or tawny port for 5 days before making it. My 2nd year making this, I did just that with tawny port and the results are amazing! I'm off to the store today to buy my apricots & port!

Just a note to the person whose brie did not turn out so well - if the cheese was leaking all over the place during baking, I'm guessing you removed the rind before wrapping it. I may be wrong, but that's my guess as to what happened to yours.

This was marvelous. I was only making it as an appetizer for two people, so I quartered the chutney recipe, but it was still more than enough for the small wedge of brie that I purchased. I made it two times -- once with the phyllo (though on a much smaller scale) and once without. It worked equally well both times, but if you're only making it for a small group, I would just make the chutney and then bake it with the brie quickly before serving it to warm it. Anyway, absolutely fantastic and my girlfriend was totally wowed.

This was great. Didn't have all the ingredients, so improv. Used leftover cranberries from Christmas (in lieu of cherries), diced fresh apples (in lieu of appricots) orange zest (in lieu of lemon peel) and pecans (in lieu of almonds), added a slight pinch of allspice - amazing! Also, phyllo is hard to work with to make lovely, so I did indiviudal pockets w/ chutney on top which was a show stopper and it goes great w/ champagne! Happy New Years - am on my way to make again!

i really had high hopes for this recipe, and i spent about $50 on everything to make it. i took special care to make sure it came out great. before i put it in the oven, it looked so pretty--i even did all those roses and i thought they came out so nice! when i put it in the oven, i started to notice that the cheese began to melt out of the corners of the phyllo after about 10 minutes of baking. in the recipe, it said to patch it with foil--this did not work!! a patch of foil does nothing against a 2 pound hunk of melting cheese!!! i ended up trying to wrap an entire ring of foil around the cheese/phyllo package. in the end, i had cheese melting all in my oven and probably lost 50% of the cheese. by the time i served it, i was so frustrated with the process. people seemed to like it, but i dont think i would ever make this again.

MAKE THIS. I made this brie for a Christmas party this past weekend with a few small modifications: I had a group of about 10 so I used a brie that was a little over 2 pounds and halved the chutney recipe, which worked out perfectly. I could not find dried cherries when at the store so used cranberries which worked out wonderfully. I followed other commentator suggestions and when it came to assembly placed two sheets of phyllo parallel to my counter, 4 sheets forming an X over this one, and then the last down the middle. Gathered the dough around the brie in sections and made a couple of 'rustic' roses to place in the center (still looked great). I also trimmed the top and side rinds from the brie before wrapping it, just to cut down on the chalky flavor. Also left out the almonds only because a guest was very allergic, but the dish did not seem to suffer for it. Long story short, I thought I would have a ton left over for another party the next night but it was INHALED, one tiny sliver left over, I could not believe it. This has a real 'holiday' feel, and was enjoyed by everyone. Also looks impressive and a bit special. I was helping my parents with a cocktail party they were hosting the next night and they basically demanded that I make this again (I did and it was devoured then as well) Seriously, make this at your next party

Rather than doing this in one wheel of Brie, I cut small squares of Brie, spread with the chutney and made individual bite size starters. They looked really chic, like wontons or beggars purses, and tasted absolutely delicious. I halved the recipe for the chutney, and yet still got a full jar so I had plenty left and used it to coat some haddock before baking it....Also delicious! I will definitely be making this again, a new favorite!

I made this recipe for a wine tasting party I had in July. Once we got to the red wines, I put this on the table pretty much straight from the oven...just a bit of cooling. As the host of the party, I had to tend to some other things...when I went back out to the food area, about 15 minutes after putting the Brie out, it was already half gone....I'm not joking, minus one small piece, a 2.2 lb wheel of brie and chutney was gone in about 25 minutes. Everyone loved it. I had no problems with runny brie or oils. I used Peacock brand. I served it with a Oregon Pinot Noir. Very nice. Having another wine tasting this Sat 13 sept and will make it again by request.

Great chutney! First time I've tried chutney and it was easy and delicious. Accidentally added almonds while cooking, so I sprinkled more almonds across the top of the finished brie. Was a big hit at our Oscars party.

I cater and made this for a large function. I had people trying to cut wedges off to take home with them. The contrast between the crunch of the phyllo, the zinginess of the chutney and the buttery-ness of the brie is amazing. Takes a bit of time to get those roses right, but GREAT even if you skip the roses.

Rating: 4
I used dried cranberries instead of dried cherries, and left out the almonds. This still comes out amazing, and the tang of the cranberries and cider is a wonderful contrast to the sweet and spicy flavors of the sugar and cayenne. I used puff pastry instead of phyllo dough, and it came out just as beautiful and delicious. I've made this 3 times and every time it disappears so quickly with such wonderful compliments! The leftover chutney is amazing on toast too.

Fabulous!!! I did as small triangles and am freezing to have some ready to go. I made two to taste as there wasn't room for them on the cookie sheet for freezing -- my husband just demanded more!! Which definitely makes it a 4 fork dish.

The chutney is excellent with cream cheese too. For a quick, delicious, no muss no fuss appetizer, just spoon the chutney over a brick of cream cheese, garnish with fresh rosemary and serve with crackers. The presentation is nice and it always gets rave reviews. It might even be better than the brie...

I have made a quick, easy variation of this recipe for years. Just spoon the chutney over a brick of cream cheese, garnish with fresh rosemary and serve with crackers. It always gets rave reviews and is much easier than perparing the brie. I actually like the chutney with the cream cheese better and I'm a pretty big brie fan!

Rating: 4
My accolades are not really necessary after 83 reviews, but this was too delicious not to comment! I used 3 1-lb wheels of brie and 8 sheets of phyllo per wheel. I made the roses from the scraps left from trimming the dough. The chutney is amazing and the presentation is stunning. I served it with apple slices and ginger thins. AND I still have enough chutney to make one more-- which I plan to do for Xmas Eve. This recipe is going permanently in the holiday repertoire!

Guests will be impressed with this and it's not nearly as difficult as the recipe makes it sound! Be creative with the phyllo - don't worry so much about how the top looks, I just add extra chutney and rosemary skewers once it's out of the oven. Family and friends crave this one!

This is the BEST. Note the chutney makes enough for four recipes and it freezes well so it is already made for next time, I just freeze it in separate containers. This size brie is for sale at Sam's Club at Christmas time and it freezes as well. I have made it many times and it is always excellent!

Like the cook in Seattle (Hi, neighbor!), I couldn't figure out the whole roses thing either. I used a 19 oz. wheel so did the same. Just pulled the phyllo together over the top of the brie wheel and twisted. I made half a recipe of the chutney, and substituted pistachios for the almonds. Very pretty. People loved it.

Rating: 4
I made this for a dinner party that I catered. I cut the phyllo into strips and made individual triangles with a small piece of brie, and 1/2 tsp. of chutney for an easy to serve and eat appetizer. Huge hit. I made a double batch of chutney that enabled me to make many appetizers to freeze up for future use. I generally place the filled triangles on parchment paper and freeze individually. Once frozen, I place in a container or zip lock with cooking instructions.

Very good! I was having a small dinner party, so I just used a small wheel of brie and then froze the rest of chutney for another evening. I couldn't figure out what they were talking about with regard to the assembly & roses, so I just pulled up the sides of phyllo and made a nice twist on top.

I made the roses with the left over pastry (trimmings from circle). The rough edges and the different/uneven widths of the pastry when rolled made the roses looked way more realistic! I used the remaining sheets to make a couple triangles for leaves. Looked great!

Everyone LOVES this dish and I'm asked to bring it to parties all the time (spring, summer winter, fall).

I've made this a Thanksgiving staple every year since 2001, but this year I served it for Christmas (made two at Thanksgiving and froze one - it froze and heated beautifully). I am also serving it tonight for New Year's Eve. Again, I'm making two so I can freeze one and have it on hand for a quick appetizer.

I made this dish shortly after it came out in Bon Appetit a number of years ago and then made it again this week for a holiday party. It was devoured quickly. Everyone loved it. While my very favorite brie dish remains the baked brie en crote with tomato chutney from Gourmet December 1994, this one is actually equally as good. I would give it four forks, but I do have the one other brie dish that I can compare it to. I highly recommend this and think it is definitely best when made with the size brie called for. Working with the phyllo in the smaller size might make it difficult, as one reviewer noted. Also, don't worry about cutting it into wedges -- just let your guests dive in. It is a beautiful presentation - the rosemary and the chutney are a wonderful combination. I will definitely be making this again.

Very delicious. As I wrapped the phyllo around the brie, I pleated the dough so that it folded evenly around the cheese round. I used chives as stems for the phyllo rosettes and dried cherries as "rose hips". The presentation was beautiful and guests loved the way it tasted.

Rating: 2
I had high hopes for this, given the rave reviews. My biggest problem was how to serve it. I read all the notes for suggestion on how to "cut the cheese into wedges", since I knew the phyllo would be very flakey and fall apart, but no one mentioned this issue. I bought two 8 oz rounds of brie, (had no time to find a 32 oz). I spooned about 1/2 cup of the chutney onto each round. After wrapping the first brie as directed, it seemed the phyllo would be too thick. So I wrapped the second round with only 2 layers. After cooking, cooling, and slicing the first round, the dish was a mess. The round could not be sliced into small portions since the phyllo would just fall apart. Before cooking the second round, I pull the phyllo off the top to create a bowl. This worked slightly better - guests could now scoop and spread the brie onto crackers. I found the brie was overpowered by the very sweet chutney, and it melted and disappeared into the bottom phyllo layers. This seemed like a waste of brie to me. If I make again, I'll cut down on the sugar, use much less chutney, stack the two 8 oz rounds on top if each other, use 2 layes of phyllo, and create a bowl with the phyllo, leaving the top open. While the phyllo may need 400 degrees for 25 minutes, brie does not take that long to melt. The guests seemed to like the dish, but I thought it was kind of disappointing.

Rating: 4
this is a sinful and delicious appetizer for special occasions. i also had a bit of trouble with the final presentation. my roses looked more like droopy lumps and the pastry fell apart upon cutting. i think i would do individual packets next time as suggested by another reviewer. i used a jar of fig jam for snappy prep. the rosemary was divine.

Rating: 4
This brie is awesome! I made it with a smaller brie, about 19 oz. and did as a previous reviewer suggested with the philo - unrolled the first two sheets vertically, then the next two on top as a cross then two more sets of two sheets as an X, then put the three little roses in the middle. I used the butter Pam and that worked really well. I had never worked with Philo and it was a lot easier than I expected. I cooked for 40 minutes per the recipe, but it wasn't melted/hot enough, so next time I will leave in longer. Next time I will put more chutney on top, I put a thin layer and it could have used more. If you're a rosemary fan you'll really like this.

OK...this recipe made me really nervous and apprehensive, but I gave it a shot anyway. It was a lot easier than I thought! I made this as an appetizer for Christmas Eve dinner...I thought my presentation wasn't too great, but no one seemed to mind! I thought it was going to be too much (I used a 32-ounce wheel of brie) but much to my surprise, 95% of it disappeared! Everyone LOVED it! I cut up some baguette bread to go with it. I didn't make the rosettes, but like I said, no one seemed to mind. This is a DEFINITE keeper of a recipe.

This was splendid. I couldn't get the rhythm of the wrapping, though, and my final result looked like a bundled diaper! With the roses added it wasn't so bad. The flavors were divine! As other reviewers have said, there was probably twice as much chutney as I could use. It was great, though, and easy to prepare.

One of my favorate appetizers. I altered the assembly of the recipe to make this an easy finger food. Laid out a sheet of phyllo dough, brush w/melted butter, lay out another sheet and brush w/melted butter. Cut into 5 strips. place a piece of brie and a teaspoonful of chutney at the bottom of each strip, and roll up into triangles. Bake in a 375 oven until golden (about 10-15 minutes). Loved them. This chutney is so delicious, I think I will use it in other recipes as well.

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer and everyone loved it. it looked beautiful, the brie stayed melty even an hour after taking it out of the oven, and the flavor was delicious. My mom, unbeknownst to me, doesn't like brie but couldn't stop eating this! I had leftover phyllo and some blue cheese so made little packets of phyllo-wrapped blue cheese with the chutney and those were really good too.

Fabulous!!! I had phyllo issues, so went without. Instead, I removed from rind from the top of the brie, returned the brie to the wooden box, topped with the chutney and baked for 30 minutes at 350. Would definitely skip the phyllo step again. This presents beautifully. The colorful, flavorful chutney are perfect for an elegant fall appetizer.

This got rave reviews at a recent party! It was a great make-ahead recipe, too, always a plus for me! I found one-pound wheels of Brie (at Costco), so I made two individual smaller items. This worked out great, as I didn't have to patch together pieces of phyllo to make a large rectangle for the two-pound wheels. I used eight pieces of phyllo, forming the first two double layers into a cross shape, then the next two into an "X" shape over that. I put the wheel of Brie in the middle and gathered up all the layers at once and pressed it all very gently into a topknot. I placed the two wheels onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and froze them, then placed into Ziploc bags. The day of the party, I took them out of the freezer about two hours before the party, then baked them as directed, although the total baking time may have been longer (someone else baked them). I agree with others that the chutney is fabulous and a real key to the recipe's success! We also had it with a chicken salad and it was fantastic!

FABULOUS!!!! I make this recipe every Thanksgiving and it's a hit every time! It looked intimidating with the many ingredients, but it was so easy to make. I cut the recipe in half, used a 16 oz wheel of brie, and used dried cranberries instead of cherries... I also omitted the almonds. I didn't measure the rosemary, but instead just saturated the phyllo dough with it (I love rosemary). The left over chutney was a nice "cranberry relish" with our Thanksgiving turkey. Yummy!

I haven't made this recipe, but wanted to recommend something for the time-savers out there. When in a rush, I often use Pillsbury crescent roll dough as the wrapper instead of the phyllo. It is a little less delicate, but much easier.

Hate to sound like a broken record, but I also love this recipe and get asked for it everytime I bring this to a party. I just wanted to add some time-saving comments. 1) You can substitute a 16oz. jar of any kind of thick, fruity jam in place of the Chutney. I put it in the fridge and then stir in some nuts when I'm ready to prepare the dish. 2) Get some PAM butter-flavored cooking spray. I always use this with phyllo dough. It's faster than brushing on melted butter so you don't have to worry about the sheets drying out. Probably saves some calories too. Another tip for those that can shop at "Trader Joe's" - they carry a 2-pound wheel of Brie for about $10.

I absolutely love this recipe. I have made it multiple times and each time it has stolen the show. At one party, no one wanted to eat any other food (which kind of upset the host!) This is my favourite recipe I have ever made from Bon Appetite. Its easy but looks complicated! I wanted to add a couple of hints: 1) For the chutney, if you don't want leftovers, just half the amount of ingredients. It always makes way to much. 2) Especially if you are using an electric stove, I recommend you cook the Brie in a jelly roll pan. Otherwise the butter can drip off and cause a fire.

I've made a many brie en croute before and this is the best. To be perfectly honest, the only part of the recipe I followed was the layering of the pastry, butter and rosemary and design on top.

THIS IS DIVINE! The chutney is so flavorful and multi-dimentional, I cannot even describe it. When you combine the chuntey with the brie, it takes on a new creamy sweetness.

OUTSTANDING! I make this often for dinner parties and holidays. What I do is 5 days prior to making it, I soak the apricots in apricot brandy or tawny port so they absorb this great flavor. I then make the chutney the way the recipe states. When assembling the dish I saute 1lb of mushrooms in some butter & parsley and cook until there is no liquid. I add this to the chutney and continue on with the recipe. It's just fabulous! No leftovers, ever!

I made this for a Valentine's Day dinner party. It was time consuming but not too difficult. Flavor was delicious, would use chutney again with grilled chicken. Great.

Decadent and delicious. To cut down on time I used Major Grey's mango chutney, and added some toasted pecans. I also used a baby wheel of brie (13 oz.), trimmed the phyllo to cover completely and made a large ruffle for the top of the brie with the phyllo scraps. This appetizer presents beautifully, especially with an assortment of fresh fruits and a basket of diagonally sliced sweet baguette. Yum!

I made this recipe with a different chutney, using mixed dried fruits (apricots, pears and cranberries), thyme and a splash of balsamic vinegar. You can't beat the flavor combination with the brie and the flaky phyllo. Working with the phyllo is tricky, but the result is well worth the effort.

This is a truly impressive and tasty recipe. Made it for my in-laws who loved it! I does make a lot of food tho! The chutney alone is worth making and keeping.

Absolutely delicious. I had never worked with phyllo and the directions made it a snap. I ended up with way more chutney than the recipe called for. I have no idea why, but I only used a third of it. I ended up spooning more over the cheese as people ate. Beautiful presentation. Makes you look like a genius. Expect to spend $30 to $35 to make this, however.

I've made this several times and it's usually the hit of the party. It looks impressive and serves easily. The chutney is perfect and worth the little bit of extra effort.

The most crowd pleasing appetizer I make. I use prepared chutney when in a time crunch and add cranberries and fresh sprigs of rosemary for the presentation. This is always a hughe hit.

This recipe was everything the previous reviewers said. I would recommend not altering the chutney recipe as it is absolutely perfect. Any substitute chutneys would change the overall effect dramatically. It is both elegant to look at and elegant to taste. I was one of 9 people asked to contribute a elegant center piece appetizer for a friends 50th birthday bash. After extensive searching on this site I decided, in grand part due to the other reviews, that this was the recipe for the occasion. It was "the hit" of the party. Thank you epicurious for another award winner!

I just made this for a wedding shower and had many jaws dropping. Most people thought it must have been purchased from a local gourmet deli. Thanks for the consistently great recipes!

I've made this dozens of time, and it's fabulous and very impressive. The preparation gets easier every time you do it. To make it really easy, I usually purchase the chutney. In addition to apricot, I've also used cranberry, which was especially good, and very pretty at Christmastime.

We used a small wheel of brie but followed the recipe proportionally. We served 5 adults and the results were exceptional. Keep up the great website!

This recipe is fabulous! But note that depending on the diameter of your wheel of brie, you may not have an exposed center upon which to place phyllo rosettes if you follow the dimensions provided in this recipe!

Timely to make, but well worth it!
