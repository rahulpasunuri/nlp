I loved the flavor of this stock. I bought a small turkey a few days before Thanksgiving and used the neck and giblets for this stock and simultaneously used the turkey legs to make the Turkey Stock recipe from Gourmet, Nov 2006. Two great resources to have ahead of time.

This was a very nice stock and added the right dimension to the rest of the trio, Stuffed Turkey with Lemon, Oregano & Red Onions and the Italian Sausage and Bread Stuffing of Gourmet, Oct 2007

I made this stock on Thanksgiving, it was easy and awesome. I used it to baste the Turkey, and to make my stuffing. I used the remaining stock to make the gravy. Everything was delicious.
