These were good, regular biscuits. Couldn't find the malted milk powder, even at Whole Foods, so I did without. They taste very rich and satisfying, even with only 3T of butter!

These were REALLY good. I used half whole wheat flour (rather than all AP) and didn't have whole milk, so I just used 2%. Also, replaced the malted milk powder with plain powdered milk. They were super easy to make and came together perfectly. My favorite biscuit recipe so far, though I'm still searching!

This recipe goes very well with Cornish Game Hens stuffed with rice, raisins and nuts. However, the biscuits are so tasty they would probably be a hit as part of a breakfast buffet.
