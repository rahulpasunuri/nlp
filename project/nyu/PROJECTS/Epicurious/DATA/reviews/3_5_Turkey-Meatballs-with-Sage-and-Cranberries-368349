I made this recipe for a family holiday potluck. I used spinach, and Locatelli cheese. I hade to forego the chutney because my grocery doesn't carry it and they did not have cranberries for me to make my own. It was delicious and commented on by multiple family members. The leftovers were wonderful. I doubled the recipe and made it exactly and did not find them to be dry.

These were very yummy meatballs with a great flavor profile. I did what some of the reviews suggested and put all the ingredients (minus the turkey) in a food processor, gave it a whirl, and then added the mixture to the ground turkey and combined. I used walnuts instead of pine nuts because that's what I had around and it worked well. I would definitely make these again.

Made the mixture for these the night before Thanksgiving, and then baked them the next day as an alternative to the traditional roasted turkey. Served with a sage-cranberry gravy, next to BACON MASHED POTATOES, and the rest of the fixings, they were REALLY good. I used a #60 disher to make the balls, and the recipe only yielded 40 balls. But 5 balls for each of us was plenty. They seemed a little heavy, but perhaps this was because I refrigerated the mix longer than required, or because I used store bought bread crumbs. Next time I would use less bread crumbs. Flavor was excellent

Very tasty! Throwing everything, except the meat and eggs in a food processor works well. Have made these with ground beef - almost as tasty as ground fowl.

Very nice flavor. Kind of dry, but then I failed to soak the bread crumbs in milk, so that may account. Will try again with some liquid, and am sure they will be perfect.

It's a bit of work, but definitely worth it. Super tasty!

I thought these were outstanding in flavor but I also panfried them in a bit of olive oil and that added a nice crust. So good! I did use a food processor for the pine nuts, onions, cranberries, and greens because I like smaller bits and also I wanted to make them mini meatballs. I froze some raw, which I hope works out well. We'll see on Thanksgiving when I plan on serving them as a snack while waiting for the big turkey. I couldn't stop popping these in my mouth after I cooked them. Watch out!

I'm disappointed that the photo of the recipe shows the optional store-bought cranberry chutney, and barely shows the meatballs at all! Regarding the pine nuts, it most likely is a typo, and the author meant to have them mixed in as well. Although since they're small meatballs, personally I'd chop them first.

I agree with A Cook from Switzerland and lisagez, . The recipe instructions indicate "combine all ingredients from turkey through pepper" from the list of ingredients. Pine nuts are not a part of this list!

This was a very elegant way to prepare a standard that is boring. Great recipe!! I made a couple slight changes... I used more Parmesan cheese (1/4 cup) and used my own breadcrumbs with shallot and garlic. I chose to use baby spinach and have to admit that I would not have thought to use greens in this kind of recipe, but it worked and added nutrients. To help "isagez" who posted right before me - the toasted pine nuts go in the rest of the mix. After toasting the pine nuts, the recipe says to combine ALL ingredients. If you made these without pine nuts, I am sure it was still delicious! I made my own cranberry chutney with fresh cranberries, because they looked good at the market. THANKS ROBIN!! UNIQUE AND WONDERFUL DISH!

looks good, but please clear up what you do with the pine nuts...

I don't understand what the toasted pine nuts are for. The recipe instructions don't mention them being used after they are toasted.

i was so impressed with this recipe, and had just about everything for it on hand, i had to make it right away, only modifications were frozen squeezed out spinach, no ounce of skim milk, and,... SHHH.......don't tell anyone, ground chicken.......ABSOLUTLY DELICIOUS!!!!! i had no chutney or other suitable condiment, but what i was wishing for was something with a little bit of blue cheese in it. anxious to hear other reviews
