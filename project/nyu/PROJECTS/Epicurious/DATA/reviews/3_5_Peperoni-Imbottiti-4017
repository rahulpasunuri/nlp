if youre overcooking the peppers then you need to turn the gas up on your stove and srub the peppers with a soft brush to try to get the wax off them and let them drain on top of the bag instead of in the bag, that way they wont get soggy

This recipe was outstanding!!! My guests loved it and had seconds. I mixed the anchovies with a bit of olive oil, lemon juice and peel and then drizzled over the mixture. This helped to mix the ingredients. Definite use fresh bread and not packaged breadcrumbs. Thanks to the comments I really watched the peppers. They don't have to be charred 100% - just about 75% to be able to get the skin off. I put the peppers on a plate and covered with plastic wrap and let for about 2 minutes then started to peel. As the peppers became softer, I uncovered the plate. I also just warmed the completed dish to prevent further cooking. They stood up just fine.

loved the flavour combination however, I seem to have trouble charring the peppers without getting them too soft...any suggestions?

This would be a great dish to serve at a dinner party. Multi-color peppers would make a great presentation. I accidentally over-cooked the peppers - too much time in the bag. Remember that they get cooked again in the oven. Mine were a bit flat and not as pretty as they could have been. The flavor unique and very delightful.

I might not have done it right, but I am incapable of charring the peppers without them getting soft. But no worries! This recipe is great even with "soft" peppers. Great combination of flavors, and this comes together in a snap.

Served this at a small dinner party. People seemed to really enjoy the complexity of the flavors and commented on them throughout dinner. Thought the toasted pine nuts made the dish.

Made this for a dinner party and it was exceptionally well liked. A wonderful combination of flavors, complex, almost meaty.
