we added lots of garlic and thinly sliced Ginger (my new favorite technique). served with brown rice, Asian garlic chili sauce for the adults, and everyone - including my 15 month old and my husband - loved it. we will definitely make this a staple as our CSA delivers napa cabbage!

I doubled (or more) the garlic and ginger and dried the cabbage before cooking it. Delicious!

No prob with watery because due to others comments I drained off the cabbage well and added 1/2 tsp corn starch to the water.I rated this so highly because it turned out great even though I forgot to put the cilantro on the table and because it is so easy. Served it with garlic chili sauce.

Would make it again mainly because its very easy to make and don't require many ingredients. Good for napa cabbage fans, have seen this dish called twice-cooked pork in chinese restaurant. Good but agree with the comments that recipe is too watery. For extra zing, i added some chillies in fish sauce while eating it. It worked well if you don't like your food too bland (added saltiness and heat)

This recipe went off with only one hitch. and for the Casual Chinese Cuisine buff that I am this hit the spot. I ran out of Cornstarch and managed to save this recipe by straining off the veggies, making a tiny rue with one teaspoon of butter and one 2 teapoons of flour, then returning the strained liquid to the skillet and mixing the veggies and meat together. Splendid and simple recipe with ingredients on hand!

This dish was kind of boring but my husband liked it; we agreed that it was decent, low-key comfort food but probably not worth making again unless we could add some zippy ingredients. With additional ingredients, it would be a different recipe.

This started out tasting really bland and too watery (even tho I doubled teh cornstarch) when I initially served it. Wasn't until the next day that the flavors intensified and it was tasty, then.
