Have made this dish several times to rave reviews. I look for oxtails when they're on special at Uwajimaya and freeze. I don't change anything about the recipe, except to use black bean sauce instead of brown bean sauce.

Excellent way to braise oxtail, the star anise is cleverly complimentary. Forget the brown sugar, it makes this dish too sweet. First time, I used the leftovers to make ravioli filling, this was marvelous. The next time I used the meat to stuff onions, Great!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a pound of (grass-fed) stew meat with 6 oxtail pieces (2.8 pounds). It was OK, but bland and too sweet. Some garlic chili sauce on my serving gave some needed pizazz. The "brown bean sauce (not ground)" was a pointless expense, as it added no distinguishable element, and now that'll be in the fridge 'til next major clean out.

If you love oxtails and are short on time (not total cooking time, but rather time to watch the pot over the stove) then the trick is to get a Nissan Double Thermal pot. These things are not cheap but well worth the money cause you can use it for osso bucco, stews, anything that requires slow cooking. You cook everything in the inner pot on top of your stove--get it to a boiling temp and take it off the stove and put it in the thermal pot, lock it and walk away. In a few hours, perfect oxtail. Saves you time and energy. I usually do my Chinese oxtail with root vegetables and have never added the Chinese brown bean sauce, but will try it. Star anise is the killer ingredient in the recipe.

Thanks to Akpharmboy for the tip on putting the star anise and ginger into cheesecloth. I could not find brown bean sauce, so I used black bean sauce. I used white wine for additional water- about a bottle. This was my first time cooking oxtails. So Delicious!

Very delicious, and flavorful. And simple to make. The prep time is so little, and it can sit on the stove while you're doing something else. I also added some (about 1tsp.) Chinese 5 Spice Powder, and a little (about 2 tsp.) fish sauce in the first step. Not necessary, but a lovely addition. The dish really must sit for a day or so before eating. I've made this a few times now. And it never disappoints.

The finished product is nice and flavorful. Unfortunately, it takes time to prepare that I often don't have. It seems it could be a regular cold weather dish. Husband and son loved it. The star anise was not overpowering at all, even though there was so much initially added.

Very easy, very impressive, and incredibly delicious! Don't be intimidated by the idea of oxtails, they are worth it. I served it over sauteed (instead of boiled) choy sum & brown rice. A friend said it was better than any oxtail he'd had in Hong Kong! I prepared it on a Friday, while cleaning the house, then pulled it out on Sunday & had dinner on the table in no time! Will make many times in the future!

Certified D-Lish-Us. Oxtail is quite simply some of the richest, most flavorful meat on the cow. This braise really brings it out. Mmmm.

This recipe is fragrant and deeply flavored, really great if you love oxtails. I would make it again with slightly less star anise next time, and make it a day ahead.

Looks like a fine recipe. The last posting was in June. So that makes it a favorite?

ok--I'm not saying this is not good. I have it copied into my recipe box. But the last posting was in June /07. And this is a favorite? What is wrong with this picture?

This is a great rendition of a classic Chinese cooking technique and my guests loved it. I took the leftover oxtail and shredded it and put it back in the sauce and turned it into a soup with rice noodles and greens the next day. Excellent!

I've made this dish several times; it's a good all-purpose stewing recipe-- I've used brisket several times. Use low sodium soy sauce, and you need not worry about the reduction getting too salty.

Really outstanding! East to prepare. The next time I make this, I will put the ginger and star anise in a cheesecloth sachet for easy removal. This would be great served with any fresh greens!

This dish is very simple to prepare. I made it a day in advance. Everyone LOVED it! It is rich so a little goes a long way.

This was very simple to make and VERY good. My family and guests loved it! We ate it the day after I made it. It is quite rich, so a little goes a long way.
