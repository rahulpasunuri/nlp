Amazing - but I love beurre blancs!! We made this as a main course for two for New Year's Eve (upped the scallops but kept the rest of the proportions the same). Like some others, I replaced the clam juice with chicken stock. My husband and I did not find it bitter in the least, which is saying something, since I tend not to like citrus-y sauces. I will say that the butter evened everything out and made it super delicious. Perhaps those who found it too bitter/too grapefruit-y shied away from the admittedly high fat content of the sauce?

Excellent! I left out the sugar too. Served with steamed broccoli and roasted rosemary new potatoes. What a great dinner!

Wow! Wow! Have I said "Wow!" yet? One of the best dishes on the site! Relatively easy to prepare and assemble--and the flavors are just brilliantly complex. Makes a great starter. I used small scallops. I recommend not slicing even large scallops. If they are simply gigantic, give each guest a single scallop on starter plate.

Absolutely delicious! I didnt use clam juice and cut the butter in 1/2 and still amazing. Husband said it's one of my best.

We have been using this since 1990. Sometimes with heavy cream and no butter, usually with no clam juice and we put it on several kinds of fish. No sugar is used, sometimes it is leeks and fennel. The basics are there and I made it again tonight to go over tilapia that was on sale. This is a classic.

Very refreshing. Not bitter at all. Even left out the sugar.

We loved this recipe. Very different and not at all what you would expect. Didn't slice the scallops, left them whole, used chicken broth instead of clam juice, but otherwise followed the recipe. Have made it several times (once without the butter) and even that was great!

The sauce was delightful. None of the bitterness of the grapefruit was left after the sauce the strained. My father, who dislikes grapefruit, didn't even realize that it was a grapefruit sauce! It was an interesting alternative to the usual buttery scallops.

This was an unusual and wonderful dish. The sauce tastes like a grapefruit-based hollandaise. I would recommend doubling the number of scallops and serving it with some asparagus and white rice.

This scallop dish is very easy to make but the sauce doesn't do justice to the scallops. I found it still a little bitter even with the addition of the sugar and not all that exciting.
