awesome! let marinate at least 24 hours so all the flavors can marry.

I'm sure that I have made this recipe 50 times since it was first published in 1994. In the winter, I serve it with mashed or baked potatoes and in the summer in delicious sandwiches with roasted tomatoes or red peppers, carmelized onion and rosemary-garlic aioli. Don't be afraid to marinate for a good long time.

Not what I was looking for.We named this steak Marco Polo--started in Italy, wound up in China.The soy sauce way overpowered the other ingredients.It wasn't a happy marriage.What saved the whole thing was that it made OK sandwiches using the sauce for dressing on the bread.

I marinated this steak for 3 days as our weekend plans changed. Finally got around to broiling it and it was delicious! Very tender and great flavour! Do not be afraid to marinate days in advance.

Have made this now a second time and the flank steak didn't fail to impress once again. This time I did use a different brand of horseradish (Beaver) and that made all the difference - the flavours popped as this horseradish had the zing and bite that I had originally expected. Excellent recipe for company!

Rating: 3
I made this on the weekend for guests and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. The flank steak really deserves 4 forks, but for me, the recipe lost a fork because of the horseradish sauce. It really was much blander than I anticipated. Perhaps it was the brand of horseradish (Woodman's) that I used that lacked the expected punch? I will make this again but next time use a different type of horseradish and see if that makes a difference. I also recommend adding a bit of kosher salt to the sauce as there isn't any in the recipe and I think it is needed to enhance the flavours. Having said all that, the steak was fabulous! For flank steak,this is now 'the' marinade that I will use.

I've made this recipe several times now for company and am making it again this weekend. I think the trick is to marinate the steak at least 48hrs. It makes a huge difference. The flavours marry together so well. Its so easy, always a hit, and everyone keeps coming back for more!

Not bad, not amazing either. The marinade was a bit too salty, next time I'd cut the soy sauce by a bit.

The marinade was good, but for the sauce, I would only have used 1 green onion, otherwise it seemed to be too much for the sauce, and maybe more horseradish would have given it more flavor. I might make this again, but would alter it next time.

The marinade was decent but didn't wow us. I found it a bit too sweet, but it did have a good flavor. Horseradish sauce is a must as it provides a really good balance to the marinade.

The marinade was GREAT! I used this recipe with organic skirt steak and marinated (fridge) it for 10 hours. I added some mesquite chips on my charcoal Weber and got an excellent flavor. The sauce was a little bland...I would've almost gone with a 50/50 horseradish/sour cream mix, but overall it was doable and agreeable to many.

Rating: 4
The person who made this recipe should go straight to Heaven - no delay at the Food Channel! It is a perfect balance of flavour; the horseradish works well with the steak and the salad is simple but exerts itself. I always marinade for 3 -4 days and did so here.

This recipe rocks!! With one variation this has become my default "must impress (insert boss, friends, in-laws...) go to recipe". Instead of Flank Steak (which is great) I've been using this marinade with Flat Iron Steak. I discovered it by accident. I went to New Seasons in Portland Oregon. The butcher, out of Flank Steak, recommended that I try Flat Iron Steak. I find that it is much more tender, has great flavor and is foolproof to grill! Pair with a Chateauneuf du Pape or Bordeaux and you'll be thrilled.

Rating: 2
The marinade was way too salty for my taste. I used regular sodium soy sauce because I was out of low sodium. Lo-so might make a difference but I don't think I will try it. As for a previous reviewer who said the oregano gave it a funny taste, that wasn't on the ingredient list.

Rating: 1
I thought the white wine added nothing to the marinade. The oregano gave it a funny taste. I am surprised since so many liked it. I am now going to take the left over flank steak and make the flank ginger sauce that so many raved about and see if I can restore it to something edible

Rating: 3
This dish has become a weeknight staple for anytime flank steak is on sale, but it also impresses guests when sliced and presented nicely! I find the sauce is also good with plain fat-free yogurt, maybe even better because you can really load up on it with no guilt :-) Great leftover sandwiches as well.

I, too, purchased my flank steak at Costco and increased the recipe to accomodate a larger crowd of people. It was an absolute hit. And, being a total horseradish fan, I increased the amount of horseradish called for in the recipe. I received rave reviews ... even from those who didn't care for horseradish. The marinade will also work well with other cuts / types of meat. I'm eager to try it again

Rating: 4
As I usually buy my flank steak from Costco and they come three to a package, I triple the recipe, marinating them in zip lock bags, grill one the next night and throw the other two in the freezer. I done this for a party of 85 and it works great! I always get asked for the recipe.

Rating: 4
I am not forking or saying if I would make again because I only made the horseradish sauce with this recipe. However, if you are a horseradish lover, I would not recommend the sauce. Too sour cream, you don't even taste the horseradish or green onion flavors.

This is a very tasty marinade. I used sirloin since I cooked 4 lbs of it and flank steak is pricey. It turned out very nice and tender after marinating over night. The rosemary flavor really came through. I probably quadrupled the horseradish in the sauce and used chives instead of green onion. It is basically sour cream if you go by the recipe, I would recomend adding the horseradish to taste. I thought the sauce was very complimentary to the beef. It was a big hit with the group I fed it to.

Fantastic steak. I marinated for 48 hours prior to bbq'ing and used equal parts horseradish and sour cream for the sauce. Great crowd pleaser. I served with boiled new potatoes smothered in chipotle butter (butter mixed with a few diced chipotle peppers) and the corn, black bean and tomatoe salad.

I love this recipe!!! I've made it several times for family get-togethers; in fact, I think my family is now suspicious about whether I can actually cook anything else. But why mess with a winner? The steak is easy, delicious and beautifully presented and I have yet to serve it to anyone who didn't love it. Also- the sauce is great but I've also served the steak without it as well and it's still terrific. Try it- you'll be happy you did.

this is a great combo. i've made the sauce many times and everyone loves it. i make one part horseradish to two parts sour cream, for our taste. as for the marinade, i never do soy sauce overnight-- it makes mushy steak. worcestershire instead, and red wine for the white, and it's great! also, i don't have a grill so i heat a grill pan (any large skillet would do, not nonstick) over high heat for 4-5 minutes and lay the steak on it, pressing down occasionally. each side for 3-5 minutes, until very browned, and it's great!

Rating: 4
It's winter in New England so the fresh rosemary was unavailable, and as we didn't want to trek through the snow to the store, we used a combination of dry oregano and thyme. The marinade/baste was outstanding. We also added to the horseradish as we prefer a bit more bite than the recipe suggested. It was simple, attractive in its presentation and something we will consider for typical evenings or to serve guests. Delicious.

Wonderful! I served at a party and the 2 flank steaks were gone in a flash. I used red wine, doubling everything but the soy sauce, which was the light. It was really tender and very tasty.

Served with the horseradish sauce, crusty bread & a cherry tomato-olive relish.

I've been making this for years and it's always a favorite. Fairly easy to prepare. I omit the green onions and add more horseradish to the sauce, and use a low sodium soy sauce. Fresh rosemary is good, but I use a ground dried rosemary and it's excellent. Flank steak shrinks during cooking so be sure to account for that. Great for barbeques and parties, and looks great, too!

My family loves to marinate...this was an excellent grilling steak (even though I didn't use flank steak). I would highly recommend trying it...we're having it again in a few days. Very easy to make.

This is good, but nothing special here. Do NOT overmarinate on this one (on some flank steak it's okay, but here the wine penetrates too much and turns slightly bitter when cooking). All things considered, however, I would rather have a nice simple grilled steak with some fresh horseradish/sour cream mix on the side.

Definitely a keeper for quick and easy flank steak. I didn't chop the rosemary leaves as sometimes this flavor can be overpowering. I had two great flank steaks from Sam's club, so the second was in the marinade for almost 3 days and it was even better than the first. Had to substitute red wine for the white. We thought the sauce might detract, but it was a fantastic addition to the meal. As others have indicated the leftovers (if you have any) are fantastic too!

We really liked this recipe, and will definitely be making it again. Actually, I can only comment on the marinade, because at the last minute, I forgot to make the sauce. I will try it next time, but my husband and I both thought the marinated steak was excellent even without the sauce. Because of a last-minute change in plans, we ended up marinating it for much longer than the suggested time,(something like 48 hours or so!) and it was just fine. For those reviewers who found it too salty, you might try using reduced sodium soy sauce, or getting a thicker cut of flank steak. Our steak was very thick, but we noticed that where it was thinner, at the edges, the flavor was much saltier. In any case, this is an excellent and easy way to make flank steak, and this recipe will be one we make often.

I will definately make this dish again... except for the horseradish sauce ... the sauce tasted ok, but it suffocated the flavors of the marinade which we liked very much! Next time I just won't bother with the sauce. (the best part ... it makes for GREAT sandwiches the day after !!!)

I've been using this marinade recipe for years. I use low sodium/light soy sauce and use granulated garlic instead of fresh.

This is a pretty tasty dish, but I have no experience with grilling. In fact, I'm the kind of type that they classify as "quaint," preferring the more ladylike tasks such as washing parsley and making toast. But I do like a good steak.

Makes you just throw in the towel and go back to bed.

I look forward to making this often on the bbq this summer. Flank steak cooks very fast, is very lean and flavorful. Serve rare to med. rare and cut it thinly on the diagonal.

Great marinade for almost any type of steak. Letting it set overnight really makes the meat melt in your mouth.

This was very good and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Didn't get a chance to let it sit for more than 4 hours in the marinade, but it was still very tasty.

I have made this recipe many times and it always receives rave reviews. Even guests who don't often eat red meat come back for seconds!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I thought that marinating the meat with soy sauce overnight would leave it salty, but it was tasty and tender. and I loved the horseradish sauce. Paired it with mashed potatoes and an easy baby greens w/vinaigratte salad. I will definately be making this again.

My husband and I both thought this was the best tasting, moistest piece of meat we have ever eaten. It was succulent and the meat melted in our mouths. I use 3 Tablespoons of horseradish and I poked the garlic into the meat before grilling. We decided we will serve this whenever we have special guests over for dinner.

very, very nice. I used sirloin steak instead of flank steak and it turned out excellent. Great flavor....many compliments.

Nice and tasty, tender steak. I made it with a side of the Spinach Salad with Pears and Avocado (Epicurious) and it was a hit. I'm sure the horseradish sauce would have complimented it well if only I would have remembered to put it on the table!! I used dried rosemary. I had to double it so I'll use the lefover steak on salad tonight.

Flank steak has so much flavor. I never knew. This recipe definetly encourages the flavors of the meat. I used red wine ( had no white around) and lots more garlic. Great! I once made a dish called "ropa vieja " (Old clothes)with flank steak. Braising the meat for a long time, then pulling it apart adding all kind of vegies garlic etc. Flank steak has the flavors of the beef that other cuts just don't put out.

Wonderful--I only marinated the steak for 45 minutes but it was still very flavorful. I also added twice the amount of horseradish--even then the flavor was still quite subtle. I paired it with garlic mashed potatoes--a big hit with my boyfriend!

The marinade was wonderful and it went very well with the horseradish sauce. However, I substituted the flank steak for some small filets.

I loved this recipe! My husband is not fond of flank steak so I used top sirloin instead which turned out fantastic. I served it with the Pasta with Corn and Tomatoes which was a perfect side dish. The sauce was wonderful, but not really neccessary... I had some quest use it and other not and they all loved it.

The marinate is not overpowering leaving the steak just right. A good basic recipe, works easily with other flavours. Try adding fresh herbs, yummy!

I have made this recipe successfully for years. It is the kind of dish that is prepared for a crowd and the recipe is requested over and over again. I only use flank from a gourmet butcher, so it's considerably more expensive, but tastes like tenderloin. If you like horseradish, you'll be nuts for this one!

Although this wasn't bad, there are so many truly delicious recipes for flank steak that I probably won't make this one again.

I have made this many times, everyone loves it! The marinade makes the meat melt in your mouth and the sauce is great. Grilled over charcoal with corn on the cob and fresh tomatoes with tarragon and balsamic vinegar make an excellent summer meal. I served it with a California Sryah. Enjoy

Delicious. I didn't get to marinate the meat overnight as suggested, but for about 7 hours, and the meat still tasted great! I made it for a party, and everyone commented on how flavorful it was. Also made great sandwiches the nest day!

Fast, easy, and a nice kick to the sauce!

I suggest using a better grade of beef, and making the sauce at least one day ahead to let the flavors blend. Actually, grilled beef steak Verciano from Bon Appetit, Feb. 1996 is much better.But y'all judge for yourselves.

I would skip this one and go to the Sept. 95 recipe - Grilled Flank Steak with Rosemary. It is much better and just as easy.

It was tangy and delicious.

Quite simply, excellent. The rosemary and soy do wonders for the flank steak and added flavor. I've made it 5 or 6 times now and have plans for serving it to friends when they come to visit in March 99.
