Next time I'd skip the balsamic vinegar. I think that's what tipped it over the balance into zantec territory. Otherwise, excellent.

The sauce from this recipe is great with roast lamb, with a couple of modifications; use pan juices from lamb instead of duck demiglace and add fresh Rosemary

The duck skin did not crisp up and the apricots were useless. Couldn't even taste them. Could not find veal/duck demiglace ANYWHERE and since duck is heavy, I used beef. The sauce was good but tasted more like a medeira sauce.

We love duck. I keep a container of Gastric in our fridge. My wife really loved this recipe.

This was a very good recipe but I agree with the other writer, duck does need something with more zing. The sauce was delicious, but very, very rich.

This recipe is great. I have made it with regular onion instead of shallots and it still turned out well. My whole family loves it.

Try the Duck Breast with Orange, Honey and Tea Sauce instead. This was easy, and the sauce was fine, but I believe duck should be more "special".

I think it is very important to use the demi-glaze sauce and not chicken broth, but be sure to read the directions on the package so that it is diluted to the perfect consistency-and, not too thick.

Very easy recipe to prepare. Did not have demi-glace, so used chicken broth instead and came out delicious. Will definitely make again sometime.

I cheated (well took the easy way out) in making this recipe - used regular old broth instead of the glace, didn't do either of the strainings, cut the amount of apricot a bit - and still it turned out really wonderfully. Heaven, and I'm sure it would be even better actually following the recipe.

Made this last night, and it's now our favorite duck recipe. The sauce is wonderful and luscious! I usually don't like dishes with dried fruit, but this one's great. Great hint of sweetness and much flavor in the sauce and the fruit was wonderfully tender. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.

Living in Austria I have learned to AVOID fish as their traditional Christmas dinner and in order to pleasently surprise my guests I decided on this wonderful duck with port and apricots instead. Results? FANTASTIC! I left the duck breasts however marinating overnight in a very delicate garlic,worcestershire sauce and some port wine as well and made sure to poke the meat a bit too. Not only the sauce but the duck itself tasted like any 4 star restaurant would make it. The whole menu consisted of a carrot and ginger creme soup and I served the port duck with wild rice and mushrooms and it really complimented it. I don´t know if I´ll be able to beat this one next year but thanks anyway for your great recipes...you saved my life and reputation!!

We made this recipe with wild duck that my husband had shot, it was fabulous! I am generally weary of fruit in game recipes, but this was perfect- my guests loved it even their two year old couldn't get enough of it!

This dish was fantastic. I was lucky enough to find a rich duck stock at a specialty store here, and I didn't strain the shallots out of the sauce. I also added julienned pitted prunes with the apricots (borrowing from a recipe my French mother in law has.) I served it at a dinner party with 5 French couples who all agreed it was one of the best duck dishes they ever had.

A very easy and elegant entre to make. The most time consuming part was chopping the shallots and apricots. It was tender and juicy and to reiterate another review, the sauce is wonderful.

I had to use a whole duck as Duck Breast in my area of VT are next to impossible to find. I had orderes demi-glace for an internet source but wonder if I did something extremely wrong as the sauce was as thick and dark as chocolate pudding.Will try agin using the porportions recommended by the demi-glace makers.

I made this on Christmas day and roasted a whole duck instead of using a breast. The duck good, and the sauce was WONDERFUL!

A great way to prepare Duck. The demiglace makes a difference! We usually serve with risotto or polenta.

it was simple to prepare and delicious. I would add to let the breasts rest for about 5-10 min so juices can be redistributed before carving.

A deliciously quick dish and something a bit different to do with duck. I didn't have duck stock or veal and duck demi-glaze so used a rich chicken stock instead and it work well.
