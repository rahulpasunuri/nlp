Cooking time and method is right on. Only reason for three forks is that I find it is SO much better with garlic, which I use now--have made three times in two weeks! Finishing with a squeeze of lemon doesn't hurt. And being able to serve at room temperature is a huge plus!

Delish. Used baby broccoli instead and finicky fiancee loved it.

Simply and delicious and even great cold the next day. Make sure you finish with sea salt.

This vegetable is the perfect compliment to a Thanksgiving spread. It's hardy, dark green (great contrast) and this dish will get you much better reviews then roasted root vegetables (like carrots). Broccoli Rabe is expensive but you don't need to make much. (And aren't you tired of all those left over root vegetables! I don't make them anymore). I blanched the broccoli Rabe for 2 minutes to keep it crunchy (also a great texture improvement over roasted root vegetables). I lightly peeled the stalks after blanching. Let the Rabe stand in roasted garlic, black and a red pepper if you like spicy. Sauté and finish using a good sea (gray) salt.

I need to try it again. The rabe was well cooked - a good texture and color, but it was bland. I think I may have messed up the proportions - I think I had more rabe than I realized. So I need to up the garlic and red pepper flakes.

Delish. Light, super fast and easy. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic.

easy and delicious. I also added the cloves from 1 head of roasted garlic.

The garlic recommended by others is key. I use this to make a sandwich with either grilled chicken or Italian sausage on garlic bread with melted provolone.

This is an OK recipe, but I saute fresh garlic and minced anchovies with the hot red pepper flakes first, then saute Rabe. I garnish with generous amount of Parmesan. Much deeper and richer flavor.

Super easy, super yummy. I might up the red pepper next time and add a little garlic, otherwise, great!

Wonderful! Easy! Delicious! Won't cook the rabe as long next time, since I like it a little more crisp, but otherwise everything went beautifully.
