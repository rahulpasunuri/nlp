I didnt have scallions, but I used a bit of chopped onion and I sauteed the onion and potato in butter first, added caraway and cauliflower, a vegetable boullion cube and 2 C of water - pureed it...delicious. Will make it again.

I know this recipe needed a lot of help but what I really loved about it is that until I read it I didn't know you could eat the leaves of a cauliflower! I used the whole thing! I get a kick out of how people find a recipe on this site proceed to pick it apart then, by all means, use that very recipe for inspiration. Hilarious!

The basic idea of potato, cauliflower and caraway soup is delicious. As written, this recipe is pretty terrible. If you have no basis in cooking and decide to try this, you'll be disappointed. To make it have some flavor, I sauteed mirepoix (lots of yellow onions for this, celery and carrots) in BUTTER (it makes everything better) then added the potatoes to the butter, let them sweat a bit, and finally added the cauliflower with the caraway seeds. I sweat this for a minute then added water and better than bouillon chicken (I was out of boxed broth/stock). I let this boil until the veg. was cooked, then immersion blended the whole things. I added lots of ground pepper, a smidge of soy sauce and a couple of tablespoons of half and half (this was unnecessary but I thought, what the heck). End result: tasty. It isn't super-smooth because the cauliflower makes little granules when it's blended, but overall it has a lovely flavor and a stick-to-your-ribs feeling. Please don't just boil potatoes and cauliflower in water. Bleh.

I tried to boost the flavour as well by using yellow onions and celery that I sauteed in oil first. I then added chicken broth, potatoes and caraway. I also added paprika after using an immersion blender. Simmering the cauliflower until just cooked through and adding worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper did the trick. My husband,son and I thought it was deliciousl.

Following on the advice of others, I replaced the water with an equal amount of broth. I did not have caraway seeds on hand, so I used cumin in its stead. I enjoyed the leftovers for breakfast - I thought of trying to convert it into a potato pancake.

Thanks to other reviews I changed a bit but the idea is the same. My cauliflower-hating husband LOVED it (me too). Sauteed 1/2 a yellow onion first (skipped scallion), then added chicken broth & potatoes. Used cumin and nutmeg instead of caraway, then continued recipe. To the final product I also threw in some chopped celery. Forgot the Parmesan. Was fabulous with French bread. Easy to double. I might try blending the cauliflower too next time, just to try a full puree. But great just like this!

This is, without a doubt, the worst recipe I have ever read. I couldn't believe it was on your site. Appalling, in it's pretensions to mediocrity..what were you thinking?

The problem with this recipe as is, is that no foundation for depth of flavor is created. After reading all the reviews I opted to use some regular onions in place of the green onions. I sauteed 3 slices of bacon in a nonstick dutch over, poured out all but a teaspoon of the grease, then sauteed the onions, caraway seeds and the cauliflower core/leaves until the onions were soft. Then I added the potatoes and used chicken stock as the liquid. Finished the soup per the recipe with the addition of extra pepper and a dash of hot paprika at the end. Garnished with l.f. sourcream, the bacon bits and chopped green onion. Delicious. The flavor combination was there, it just needed to be boosted. Will definetly make again, my husband loved it and itwas still very healthy and lowfat.

Not enough flavor even with cooking potatoes and cauliflower leaves in chicken base.

This soup is awesome. Changes I made: boiled potatoes/cauliflower in chicken stock. Doubled the amount of onion. I used a hand held imersion blender.

Comment on the earlier review: of course it needs broth, because everything is so mild! I had no scallion, so I sauteed a large leek (white and green) in about 1 Tbsp canola oil (for a triple recipe). Adds a bit of fat and lots of flavor. I also used water from cooking vegies (a light broth) for about 1/3 of the liquid, which adds flavor. And Osem soup nuts (or any Israeli type) are great with it!

Easy, light and delicious. It does need a soup base, rather than water: I added a couple of spoons of Osem vegetable stock. Made it many times - everybody likes it.
