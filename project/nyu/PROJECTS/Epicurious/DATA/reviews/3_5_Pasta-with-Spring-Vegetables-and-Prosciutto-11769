This is a good, basic recipe for a tomato-cream sauce pasta dish with lots of vegetables. I agree with another reviewer that there wasn't enough sauce, so I added a little more cream and chicken broth. I had fresh rosemary on hand and used it instead of basil, and it worked. I also used about half the red pepper flakes, and that was perfect for my palate which favors milder flavors. Another reviewer used chicken instead of prosciutto, and I could see that being a very tasty substitute.

What a handy recipe. I was playing my own version of CHOPPED, trying to figure out what to do with Prosciutto, zucchini and broccoli slaw. It is so versatile, you can substitute whatever you have in terms of vegetables - definitely make the sauce as written, though. An added bonus is that my children actually ATE some of the vegetables in this dish without complaining!!

Great for week night meal. The vegetables are all adaptable--I had less zucchini, no asparagus, but it all tasted great. I also did not have enough plum tomatoes, and added tomato paste w/ water and it was fine.

We really enjoyed this last summer, and just made it again recently. It is a little involved but totally worth it! Feel free to play around with the vegis you use.

the sauces just did not combine well. the tomato part is good, but the cream-parmesan sauce never melded right. Maybe there was something wrong on my end but all in all too many dirty pots and pans to try to make this again.

I love this dish. However, I leave out the zucchini and peas. It makes a great meal, but it is a little on the spicy side.

This was fabulous..I used Chicken, grape tomatos and yellow squash instead of Prosciutto, canned tomatos and peas. I was amazed at how good this tasted. Do not skimp on the cheese - the sauce turns out light and tastes excellent.

I made some additions which I thought were for the better, but they weren't. I added shallots and mushrooms to the garlic along with some juice from the tomatoes.Then I tossed in toasted pignoli nuts and a roasted yellow pepper at the end.BUT I used less cheese. Separately, the tomato sauce and the cream sauce tasted great, but when put together , it fell flat. Maybe that's why the recipe calls for so much cheese. I also only used 12oz.of spinach fettuccine, and there barely was enough sauce to cover it.

This was wonderful! I used broccoli, red peppers, and zucchini for the vegetables. The kids loved it, and my husband called his parents and told them to come over for dinner because his wife just made this outstanding dish! I will make this again and again.

this dish took a little more time than expected but was well woth it. I used chicken instead of the proscuitto and omitted the zucchini and peas. Instead I used mushrooms and onions. It was delicious, definitely would make again. I told the people at work it was like going to Amici which is a very popular italian restaurant where I live.

Definate success with the family. I found it a great way to use up any and all leftover veges in the pantry. I had no peas or asparagus, but I substituted with a red pepper, green onions, shallots and extra snow peas. Then I exchanged the prociutto with a thick slice of cooked ham. I also added one mozerella ball. Delicious!!
