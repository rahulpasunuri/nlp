We enjoyed this very much. The nutmeg added a unique twist. I drained the tuna but did not rinse it and it was fine. I agree with a previous reviewer you can vary the crunchy veggies, "use what you have."

A really nice concept and a fresh take for tuna salad lovers. Maybe a can of tuna could be stretched to serve 3 or 4 in 1956, but today's shrinking size (6 ounces) surely won't. I used two cans of light tuna and two eggs. The seasonings are perfect as is, but the crunchables can be varied. Red bell pepper or diced radishes, for example. Don't be ruled by exact measurements - go with your own sense of proportion on the mayo, etc. I did add a 1/2 tsp of Dijon and chopped parsley. Delicious.

My husband, who is not even a fan of tuna fish, loved this and so did I. I served it on toasted whole grain bread with tomatoes.

We have tuna salad sandwiches for lunch frequently and I've been working my way through various recipes. This one is a WINNER. My recommendations: use 2 hard-boiled eggs; increase green pepper to 3 tablespoons; increase scallions to 4 or 5 but use only white-to-light-green portion. I added 1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro and WOWEE did that go over big at my house!

I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I'm not a tuna fish lover and I made this for a friend. I was so impressed that I will again make it for myself. The nutmeg lends a wonderful flavor.

My husband *loves* tuna salad and this is his fave. I cut the nutmeg to a little over 1/4 tsp but otherwise this recipe is delicious!

Loved it! I ran out of Nutmeg so I used Pumpkin Pie Spice; amazingly, it was great.

A nice variation on the normal tuna salad. Surprisingly, I really liked the hint of nutmeg, but I thin I'd omit or reduce the amount of lemon juice. The cucumber was a nice touch also.

YUM! I omitted the cucumber and added extra green pepper. Really great in a pita with some fresh lettuce but best if eaten right after it's made.

WOW!! For all the "odd" things in this tuna salad, it tasted surprisingly normal! After tiring of my husband's tuna with celery and onion, I gave this a try based on the reviews. Even he said it was the best tuna salad he'd ever eaten! This is definitely a recipe we will be using again. (Goodbye plain old celery and onion!)

YUCK!!! I followed this recipe exactly, and it was not good at all. If I could have given it a 0, I would have!

Have made it twice in a week! Didn't get enough the first time! Tried-and-true simple in preparation, An American Classic, Just plain good. Using the new foil pouch tuna was even easier!! give this a try.

Absolutely delicious! I made grilled tuna w/swiss on rye for my husband. He said it was the BEST sandwich and tuna salad ever. I wouldn't change a thing!

This salad took me 10 minutes to make and the surprising part was that it was absolutely delicious! The nutmeg added a very unique and interesting flavor. I will definetely make this again.

This is a fantastic tuna salad and a nice change from the old standby. I excluded the bell peppers, but am inclined to add them back in. I used light mayo and ate it over a bed of mix greens with chopped tomato. YUM!!!

I'll omit the green peppers from now on.
