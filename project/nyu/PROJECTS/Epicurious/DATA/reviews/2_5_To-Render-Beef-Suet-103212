Yes, definitely add a bit of water at the beginning. I was planning on making all-beef Chicago hot dogs and needed suet when I came across this recipe. Got 6lbs of beef trimmings from the butcher, hacked 'em up with my cleaver, added about 3/4 of a cup of water to the fat in a large pot and stuck in the oven at 200 for about 4 hours. Worked like a charm, sieved and chilled, ended up with about a pound of pristine white suet, and a pound of beefy-jiggly-gelatin on the bottom (which will go into a Guinness stew this week!). Also, since I'd used trimmings the leftover fat had little meaty fat-poached pockets, that I picked out and made tasty tacos with. Only advice, I think my yield would have been higher if I'd ground the fat, or whizzed it in the food processor for a few minutes instead of just hacking at it like a blind woodsman. Fortunately I have just enough suet left over after the 'dogs to try the Spotted Dick recipe!

Put a half cup of water in the saucepan also. This will allow the suet to heat up evenly and will eventually steam off. Rendered suet is excellent for sauteed potatoes.
