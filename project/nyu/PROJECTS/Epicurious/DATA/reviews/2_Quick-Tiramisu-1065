A bit too dry, so I would suggest doubling the liqueur mixture so as to soak the cake.

I would make this again with a few change-ups...I can't find lady fingers (I live in the middle of nowhere, I can't even buy a prepared pound cake at the store), so I have to either make lady fingers myself or make a pound cake...so I'd make the lady fingers. It's true, the real recipe isn't that difficult and it does not take too long, so it makes sense to use the real recipe. Oh, and I have to drive two hours for mascarpone, so it's a sad thing that I usually HAVE to use cream cheese *sigh* If you've never had the real thing, you'd probably like this recipe very well.

Quick or not---don't waste your time on this one!! If you like tiramisu, you won't like this! I don't know how you can call it tiramisu without marscapone and ladyfingers. For a real delight, use the Kahlua Tiramisu recipe from this site.

Your guests that don't like tiramisu liked this because it wasn't tiramisu! If you used marscarpone anyway, why not just go the whole hog and make real tiramisu? It really takes no more than half an hour, plus time to chill.

Tiramisu in less than 20 minutes, prep time included. I also layered it in one dish, like a trfle. I also used mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese. I also mixed equal parts chilled coffee with Kahlua with a couple teaspoons of sugar(or to taste)--instead of the instant coffee granules. And also mixed equal parts cocoa powder with sugar. Very good. It was a hit with dinner company! And they said they usually don't like tiramisu, but they liked this. I also made it one time with a thin layer of Hershey's chocolate syrup instead of the cocoa powder. Yummy!!

Rather than make these individually, I layered it all in a dish. I topped with whipped topping before garnishing with the cocoa. Seeing that the cream cheese mixture was a bit thin, I froze it for a few hours, then placed it in the refrigerator. I cut it into wedges and it served up very nicely. Not the real thing, but good if you're in a hurry for a nice Italian dessert. My husband and friends enjoyed this very much!

I might like to make this recipe again if I could figure out what I'm supposed to do with the remaining Kahlua mixture and the other half of the cheese mixture????? Please correct and re-print this recipe.

I echo the UGH comment! It was quick to assemble, however the liqueur was so overpowering! It might be ok if i halfed the liqueur and added something else. Neither my husband (who loves Tiramisu) or myself ate more than two bites of it.

Ugh ugh ugh! I love tiramisu, and this ain't it. The coffee flavor is simply too strong, and the cream cheese is soupy. It was *horrid*, and I couldn't even finish half of it. I would *never* serve this to guests, no matter how much I never wanted to see them again. I might serve it at an April Fool's meal, as a literal *gag* dessert.

I hate to be negative, but the flavor of it just wasn't right. it was quick, though.

This works for a quick and easy dessert and when you can't get real marscapone cream cheese. Chances are this is what many restaurants serve when this is on the menu

Quick and dirty tiramisu...use with undiscriminating guests or 'on a lark.'
