This was really delicious. We thought it was a bit like mini pizzas. My sun-dried tomato spread was runnier than I'd have preferred. Next time, I'll add half the water for the puree and add more as needed. The puree was really delicious and inspired me to add a bit of olive oil and oregano to make a pizza sauce.

Easy, great ingredients, but we just weren't blown away. (Ouch--poor phrasing.) Taking the advice of previous reviewers, I doubled the tomatoes and kept the mushrooms hot. To the second batch I even added more garlic & more vinegar. We liked it, but won't add it to our "great for company" recipes.

Yes, Chicago, you are alone. Why did you let the mushrooms get cold??? Sheesh! Great recipe. Just follow directions on this one.

I know I'm alone in my negative comments on this recipe so far but I just didn't think it was anything special. My guests didn't seem to love it either...maybe because the mushrooms got cold...and I ended up throwing alot out. It didn't look very appetizing either in my opinion. I don't think I'll bother to make it again.

Delicious. I made this the day before I was to serve it, and just heated the mushrooms. Like one of the other reviewers, I used a half cup of tomatoes, instead of a quarter cup.

I used sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, so I cut the water back by half in the recipe. Instead of using large pieces of bread, I sliced up an Italian loaf, brushed the pieces with olive oil and sprinkled them with basil before tossing them under the broiler for a few minutes per side. The overall flavor of this appetizer was great & a hit with our guests.

Very delicious- make the mushrooms and tomato ahead of time and reheat the mushrooms, delicious!

I don't like mushrooms or tomatoes (unusual for a vegetarian), but I made this for a party and everyone LOVED it. The meat-eaters found this a great substitute among the entirely vegetarian spread.

The bruschetta was absolutely delicious - everyone loved it!! The only problem was that the recipe proportions were totally off. One serving serves many more people than two - and requires more slices of bread. Just get a loaf and cover as many slices as you can. ENJOY!

When I made this recipe for my last party, it was gone in minutes. I would double the sun-dried tomato spread to the amount of mushrooms. This was incredible! I will make this again!

This was tasty, but how can you go wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? The tomato puree seemed runny but was fine once spread onto the bread. The portabella mushroom mixture was superb, but again, how can you go wrong? I enjoyed a few slices with black olive spread topped with the mushrooms...equally excellent. I almost wished this was my main course!
