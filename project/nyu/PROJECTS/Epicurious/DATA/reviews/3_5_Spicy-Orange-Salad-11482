super easy and a big hit with the guests! we loved it as written, but it's pretty spicy, so adjust to your taste.

MMMM, very good. I added just a dash of Thai garlic chile sauce and about a tablespoon of sugar (I had doubled the recipe) It was a very unexpected and excellent combination of flavors. We had it with the Grilled Maple Brined Pork Chops, which were delicious. I will make the oranges again as a side dish with something like carne asada.

This was pretty good. I liked the unexpected meld of flavors, but it just wasn't quite spicy/sweet enough for me. I added a dash of Thai garlic chile pepper sauce and a tablespoon of sugar (I had doubled the recipe.) I was really craving an orange so this hit the spot.

This is easy to prepare and my family loved it. It was a very good starter for a Mexican flavored steak dinner.

This was simple and really very good. My guests loved it. I used clementines because it's that time of year -- they went really well with the spiciness of the dressing and the cilantro. Try this!!

I thought this was very good. I made it with oranges off our tree. Just the right combo of sweet and spicy. I doubled + 1 orange the recipe and drizzled the dressing over the sliced organges in a bowl. Definately will make it again.

I didn't like the combination of flavors. I make a dressing for oranges from oil, red wine vinager, a health dose of chili powder and a bit of sugar for a salad of oranges and onions that makes a spicy orange salad that is much more to my taste.

The flavor of this salad takes you by surprise! The combination of garlic, olive oil and other spices was perfect. My husband really liked it.

This is a keeper if you like colorful, spicy dishes. You can make this in the morning -- slice the oranges onto a beautiful serving tray, put the dressing on it, cover with saran wrap, and refrigerate(put on the garnish when you serve it). You really ought to take advantage of the color that this dish has -- for example, I laid the orange slices on dark purple serving platter, which really showed up the orange color. I could not get fresh coriander for a garnish, so I used some of my fresh basil, which I cut up and sprinkled on top for a third color. This "salad" could even be used for a brunch and would surprise people with its spicy flavor.

This is a very pretty and unusual starter. I had something similar to this in a favorite Italian restaurant, and was delighted to find it here. Make a little extra dressing and dip pieces of French bread in it after you've eaten the oranges.
