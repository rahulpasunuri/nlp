I have been making this recipe for years, it's always a hit. It has become a staple for summer gatherings. The only changes I've made are to add lemon zest and cut down on the cheese a little bit.

When I made it as directed, I found it to be bland and oily. But I think this recipe is a great place to start embellishing. The second day, I tossed a serving with a generous handful of arugula. Much better. I think this would also benefit from some olives and/or fresh tomatoes.

I have made this as written and loved it. I've made it using white basmati rice in order to make it gluten-free for a friend and it was delicious. I'm thinking I would like to try it using brown rice, a mixture of lentils and brown rice. I made it with Trader Joe's Rice Medley and added some cherry tomatoes from my garden. Oh my goodness was that ever delicious!

I resisted the urge to add some of the extra ingredients suggested by the other reviewers- and I'm glad I made the recipe as-is. I can't stop shovelling this salad into my mouth. A wonderful summer picnic food for those of us who hate potato salad!!

This recipe was awesome. I added sundried tomatoes and lemon zest. I served it at room temp. I even used fat free feta and it was still wonderful. Made it one day ahead and it was gone at the end of the party. I must for an easy but flavorful dish.

This is a versatile recipe that can create a lot of flavor. I read through the reviews and adapted some of the suggestoins. I added dijon to the lemon juice and olive oil to make the dressing. I had several handfuls of baby artichokes. After removing the coarse outer leaves and stems, I parboiled for about 6 to 8 minutes, then patted dry and cut in half. I grilled the artichokes, a pound of asparagus and two sliced lemons. For the feta cheese I used Bulgarian Feta, which is creamier and lemony. And I added both chives and green onions when tossing.

This was a very simple and delicious recipe. I added chopped kalamata olives and a bit of lemon zest to the mix. I also used French sheep's milk feta, which has a creamy texture and mild flavor. Next time I will also add chopped sundried tomatoes.

I've made this recipe about 10 times. It's good because you can pretty much add whatever you like or have on hand. I've gotten so many compliments and everyone says "send me the recipe!" For whatever it's worth, I like to add about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar, halved grape (or cherry) tomatoes and sliced olives. Make sure you toast (carefully, I burned them last time) the pine nuts.

This was a decent recipe,, I did add sundried tomatoes, but I wasn't blown away...my sister and brother-in-law, who are foodies, thought it was good...I just thought it was a bit bland.

One of the great things about this recipe is that you can pack it up and take it to a picnic - nothing wilts and room temp is fine. We love it - and perhaps the only reason people didn't devour it in Maine is those low-carb diets!

I made this recipe as is, and it was quite flavorful and delicious. I served as a side dish to the Salmon w/ Chili Mango Salsa (on this site & also delicious) and some grilled asparagus. Perfect meal. Was great for lunch the next day heated in the microwave, as well. A few changes I will make next time: cut the oil in half and add a bit more lemon juice. I agree with many of the other reviewers, the possibilities are endless with what you could add to this dish.

I,ve made this dish several times. It is an excellent side for grilled foods and especially shell fish. Tonight I had some left over wild alaskan salmon (a friend caught it fresh and brought it back from a trip to Alaska) which was previously grilled. I added about 3/4 lb. to the salad for a great summer week night meal.

YUMMY! I will definately make this again and again and again... :) It was extremely helpful to read everyone else's tips. I made a little chart of all the suggestions (I know, I know...), and came up with the following myself: make the base orzo salad (all the basic ingredients you'd like every time). That way you can spiff it up with different ingredients each time you have it (or straight-up since you have all the basics there already!). Diced and sauteed sausage is great with it. When done, lightly toss in the base orzo salad with the sausage in the still warm pan and voila! Chicken's good. Roasted veggies too. So versatile! I toasted my pine nuts first, then kept them in a seperate container to be sprinkled on each time afterwards to prevent them from getting soggy. When coming straight from the frig, and am starving, I just zap it in the microwave for 30secs. Ok. Back to eating my orzo. ;)

I was invited to a summer barbeque and wanted to make a version of this that was light and appealing in the hot weather. I used a vinaigrette that I had leftover from another salad (which goes to show that you could use almost any oil-based dressing that you like to toss with the orzo) and added blanched cut up asparagus, grape tomatoes, and yellow peppers to the recipe. It's light and delicious, not to mention very pretty, and takes advantage of the freshest summer ingredients. I will definitely make this again, and will continue to adapt it to the season. Oh, and I also squeezed a few drops of fresh lemon juice on it to make the vegetable taste their brightest and freshest.

Rating: 3
I have made this several times with sliced sun-dried tomatoes and it's very tasty and easy. It also ages very well in the fridge. It's good hot or cold. I think it needs those tomatoes for color and flavor. I agree that more feta rather than less is a good idea.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and EVERYONE QUITE LIKED IT. It can accommodate lots of improvising. I put olives and roasted red peppers in it and next time I may add Dijon mustrad to the dressing and might add some sliced sun-dried tomatoes. The pine nuts and feta are key to its success however and I'd add more feta than less.

I love orzo, and this salad is a definite keeper. Would use a little less pasta next time or make additional dressing, as the leftovers had become a little dry by the second day. This salad is best cold from the fridge, once the feta has had time to soak up some of the dressing.

I've made this twice now and it is exceptional. Everyone will love it. Like others here have suggested, I added sliced olives, flavored feta cheese and balsamic vinegar. I also doubled the amount of pine nuts to a full cup, but make sure they are toasted nicely to a golden brown. I suggest cutting the amount of oil in half. The recipe makes a large amount, but how can you have too much of this? It is THAT good. Your guests will make sure none of it goes to waste anyway.

Very good with the following additions/changes: used roasted garlic olive oil, added 1T more lemon juice plus splash balsamic vinegar, added chopped, drained artichoke hearts in oil plus roasted red and orange bell peppers, and cilantro at the end. Also made it a few days before the brunch nad added a little more oil- lemon juice before serving as it had gotten a bit dry. Yummy!

Made this as a sidelight for dinner, and it ended up being the highlight. Added sun-dried tomatoes, a bit of balsamic, lemon zest, and some oregano. Very yummy. Looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow. Will make it again---perhaps adding bits of chicken and some kalamatas.

I agree with the person below from Thailand. This is a staple in my home. I like it for dinner parties because you can make it several hours ahead and serve it at room temperature. It's also great cold from the refrigerator the next day. Once you make the lemon and olive oil "dressing" and toss the hot orzo in it the possible additions are endless. I also add some minced garlic to the dressing, and I prefer sliced toasted almonds to the pine nuts. I like the texture better,and they're cheaper,too! I also up the amount of feta to 8 oz. If you added cooked shrimp or chicken this would be a great main dish salad. I have added chopped roasted red peppers from a jar and that adss great color as well as flavor. This is one of my top ten recipes...please try it!!

How did I live before this orzo recipe? I make this twice a month and cook the orzo in broth. I mix a garlic or other herb infused olive oil in with the (extra virgin extra light) olive oil called for. Add sliced drained sun dried tomoatoes (packed in oil), drained artichoke hearts, kalamata or mediterranean brine soaked black olives, the called for feta..can use different flavors of feta as well.Lots of chopped cilantro and generous amounts of toasted pine nuts on top before serving. I can not imagine life without orzo!

This dish is delicious! It has all the right flavors and textures, and it's very light. This salad looks as wonderful as it tastes, and it makes great leftovers. I like to add just a bit more lemon juice than what is called for, and use tomato and basil feta in lieu of plain feta.

I actually probably would give this two and a half forks if that were an option, since it is indeed a trifle bland as is. To give it a bit more flavor, I use feta crumbles with sundried tomatoes, black olives, and herbs, and add lemon zest. I also serve this as a side dish for the Greek Cinnamon-Allspice Chicken from the September 2001 issue of Bon Appetit. This dish complements the tangy, aromatic sauce for the chicken perfectly!

This recipe is the perfect BASE to creating a wonderful Orzo salad. I made this for a Channukka party and it was a big hit.

Make the recpie a few days in advance to give the flavors time to mesh. You won't be sorry!

This is really yummy. I added black olives, marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped, a couple roma tomatoes, peeled and chopped,and fresh basil. My guests all LOVED IT. I wouldn't change the amount of orzo, I thought it to be just right. I did however add a couple more tablespoons of fresh lemon juice that it called for. ( in my humble opinion if you decreased the orzo by half it would be too oily )

I would definitely decrease the amount of orzo to 1/2 pound and keep all the other ingredients as is, plus lots of extra lemon. To add more zing to this recipe I've added pickled beets, parsley and red onion. Unfortunately it still lacks something...

My husband and I albsolutely loved this recipe. I ate half of it while I was waiting for another dish to be ready! The flavors all go so nicely together. It is a wonderful accompaniment to fish or chicken and can be made ahead and served at room temperature. It is definitely a keeper!

This recipe has potential to be Fabulous. I like the suggestions for adding extra lemon, but I also tried a variation from an old cookbook that called for adding roasted red/yellow peppers and eggplant (roasted with garlic) and adding a good handful of fresh mint. This makes it a main dish recipe that my whole family enjoyed.

Rating: 3
The big secret to this recipe is to use only 1/2 pound of orzo, and keep the other amounts constant. This not only produces a much better finished product, but also produces a much more managable amount. I like to add sliced kalamata olives to mine, and a big handful of fresh herbs, especially parsely and cilantro, and a shot of good olive oil just before serving at room temperature.

Yuck. Sorry to be the lone voice of doom here, but this was just awful in my opinion. I made it exactly according to the directions, at first, then tasted it. Bland, bland, bland. It was like I was chewing air. Pretty much all I could taste was oil and pasta. I then added lemon rind, as suggested, plus tomatoes, more lemon juice (lots more), black olives, more salt, fresh mint, and even a little hot sauce as a last resort, all to no avail. Nothing improved the taste. For much better results, try the Orzo with Feta and Cherry Tomatoes, also from Gourmet.

Very good. I didn't have pine nuts so I substituted toasted almonds. A suggestion- try to buy the best (i.e. Greek/Bulgarian) feta you can find in your local market or deli. It's much more expensive then the supermarket variety, but it's worth it. The taste and texture of Greek feta is fantastic.

I agree with the other reviewers that this dish needs less pasta and more seasoning and/or vegetables. I made it with ditalini (because our grocery was out of orzo)and used a combination of lemon and basil infused olive oil with the lemon juice - but it needs a little more than the recipe calls for. I also added some lemon pepper and more scallions. The toasted pine nuts are an excellent addition.
