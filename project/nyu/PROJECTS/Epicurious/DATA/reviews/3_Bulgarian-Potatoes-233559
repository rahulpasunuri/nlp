This was really nice. It was puffy and light, maybe a little dry? I was the only one who thought so; guests and husband disagreed and thought it wasn't dry at all. It wasn't greasy like potato gratins can be sometimes. It was a good compliment to our smoked leg of lamb and steamed asparagus.

Having lived in Bulgaria for some time, I am puzzled by the name of this recipe. Bulgarians eat lots of potatoes and cheese, but I have never eaten a dish even resembling this. As one reviewer pointed out, you cannot find cottage cheese in that country. Having said this, I tried the recipe and found it uninspiring.

I made this recipe based on the picture and the fact that I liked the idea of using cottage cheese in place of less healthy alternatives in a potato gratin type dish. I was disappointed however in the custard topping and thought the dish overall lacked the complex flavors I am used to creating. I might try this again and add some garlic, lemon and onion flavors and top the dish with some cheese or something like that instead of the custard. Interesting though.

That's definately not a Bulgarian potatoes recipe. I don't know who posted it, but in Bulgaria there is no cottage cheese at all. So how it can be Bulgarian?

I halved the recipe and made two substitutions with ingredients on-hand: ricotta cheese for part of the cottage cheese, and 2% greek yoghurt for whole-milk yoghurt. I really enjoyed it, but will probably skip the custard on subsequent occasions. Unlike other reviewers, I found the dish to be flavorful and moist.

This was pretty yummy though it should be eaten right away because it tends to get gluey when it starts cooling off (all the butter, I guess). Made it exactly as written so I have no suggestions re changes - just follow the recipe and enjoy. I'd give it 2.5 forks if I could but I couldn't give it 3 'cause it just wasn't delicious enough.

My husband and I loved this dish! But, I agree with many other comments. I would definitely decrease the butter, perhaps by half. I would also make more custard - add an egg and some yogurt. Also, I used nonfat yogurt and found that it tasted fine, not tangy at all (for us, at least). And I do think that blending the cottage cheese until smooth is the key (and a mandoline, of course!). Next time, I'll add some garlic to spice it up, but very satisfying overall.

Not bad for scalloped potatoes but no zing! I'm looking for recipes for progressive dinners that need to be really good and this just didn't pass the test.

This recipe was disappointing. The texture of the cottage cheese mixture was too grainy and the flavor was bland. I like the other reviewers suggestions of adding chives or garlic, but probably wouldn't make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed this rendition of scalloped potatoes. I used a mandoline to slice the potatoes very thinly; easy to make. This was an accompaniment to roasted, stuffed pork and was a big hit in my house.

Too much work for the result. Cottage cheese is too bland. Doesn't compair to traditional scalloped potatoes, using a flavorful cheese.

Yes, this can be a type of "Bulgarian" potatoes, which are easy to be made. I would like to add something really traditional to it: mix some sqwashed garlic gloves to a boul of bulgarian yougourt, stir well until creamy, poor over the hot gratin in each plate and serve.

Thank you for restoring an old family favorite. I had lost this recipe and was thrilled to see it restored to my files. Use the "full-strength cottage cheese" and s sprnkling of snipped fresh chives to get the full effect of this marvelous dish.

This recipe had potential but there was not enough custard to cover potatoes.

Even being an unexperienced fifteen year old I was able to successfully complete this recipe and recieved more compliments than with any other. The recipe says it is for 10 to 12 people but my party of five easily finished it off.

Outstanding - a bit of a gamble to make a new recipe for Christmas dinner but every bit was eaten. When I make again I will probably decrease the amount of butter to 3/4 or even half a stick - the original had pools of butter which I mopped up with a paper towel (would increase cottage cheese to compensate). While it might be possible to substitute 2% cottage cheese, I think whole-milk yogurt is necessary - low fat or non-fat might be too tangy. Great dish & a fun conversation piece. Could possibly increase the amount of custard to 3 eggs and 1 1/2 to 2 cups of yogurt as the custard barely covered the potatoes. And a sprinkle of thyme or marjoram.......
