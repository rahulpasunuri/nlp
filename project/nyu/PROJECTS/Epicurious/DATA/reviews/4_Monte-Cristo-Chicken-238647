Decent...not great. Was hoping for more flavor and the sauce was runny without some cornstarch. Spinach was a nice accompaniment. Also roasted broccoli and baby carrots.

I've been an Epicurious user for years and have tried many wonderful recipes, but this one finally prompted me to register so I could review it. I honestly couldn't believe that such a fast, simple dish could be so good, but it was. Like other reviewers, I doubled the sauce, but it still didn't net me that much. Otherwise, I followed the recipe completely and served it with the spinach (steamed, not boiled) and a simple angelhair pasta with pesto. The whole family raved - even my picky kid! One little reminder: When that pan comes out of the oven, the handle stays hot, so keep your oven mitts on. (I know this is probably unnecessary advice, but I grabbed the handle not once, but twice - after all, it *is* a handle! - and now have two seriously burnt digits. What an idiot! But the dish was worth the pain.)

This is a great recipe! I have made this several times (following exactly) and I think it is wonderful- even my husband loves it and he is usually not thrilled with my lower- calorie "healthy" cooking. This is a lower cal recipe, hence the small amount of sauce - since a few have complained about that, if you are not concerned with the calories you may want to make extra by increasing the wine, stock and butter, it is delicous! I highly recommend. FYI - Self has alot of really great healthy recipes

Not sure why others said this was bland; I thought it was pretty tasty but I also spice to my palette as well. The only thing I would change is thickening the sauce a bit afterwards as it was a bit runny.

Not worth the effort. Just mediocre. Definitely not a 4 fork recipe, as many have rated it. Join Cooks Illustrated if you want consistently 4 star recipes. I have found several excellent recipes on epicurious.com, but this is not one of them.

This was very tasty and easy. I doubled the stock and wine but otherwise made exactly as directed. I served it with roasted potatoes and carrots. An excellent meal!

This was perfect! Followed recipe just as written, it came out perfectly. My son couldn't believe how yummy it was, and so simple! Will definitely repeat. The spinach is a marvelous accompaniment, I would however double or triple the amount. Two of us polished off the entire 12 ounces.

Awesome, easy to assemble and tastes divine! Absolutely delish. I didn't have chicken breasts so used 4 thighs and it was perfect. Will double the sauce next time!

This was amazing juicy and the Herbes de Provence were perfect in this combination. I accidentally quadrupled the sauce instead of doubling it and was still perfect(a little Wondra does the trick). Besides the sauce, I made as written. I could not get enough of the sauce/gravy. So glad I made extra, goes great on mashed red potatoes! Will definitely make again and again!

My husband doesn't usually like chicken breast because he says it's too dry. He loved this and so did I. I did increase the amount of wine and chicken stock a bit. Next time I think'll I'll add a bit of flour to thicken it a little more. This is an excellent, fast and healthy recipe . . . a hard combination to beat!

YUM!!! I made this for myself the other night by dividing the portion into fourths, and it never fails to please. I will not hesitate to make this again!

Great, healthy dish! The flavors from the Herbs de Provence were incredible, chicken was super juicey and the sauce was delicious. I agree, definately double or triple the sauce. Also, the sliced garlic in the sauce was surprisingly tender. Served sauted baby spinach along side grilled portobello mushroom and leftover au gratin potatoes. Will definately make again!

Great taste. Took a while to find the Herbes de Provence, since I'm in a rural area, but it was worth it. Gave the dish great flavor.

Wonderfull flavor. Had a hard time finding Herbes de Provence, but glad I did. One of the best chicken recipes I've tried in a while. Didn't change a thing. Quick and easy. May add mushrooms next time.

My boyfriend always asks me to make this for him- we love it and it's a regular dinner for us now! Goes great with garlic roasted sauteed spinach and egg noodles (you can spoon the left over juice over the noodles)

Delicious and very easy! I forgot the notes about doubling the wine and broth and will definitely do that next time. The whole family liked it. Also very elegant.

This was both easy and delicious. I took other's advice about doubling the broth and wine - there was plenty of sauce. I did not add the sliced garlic at the end, didn't think it was necessary-sauce was great - everyone loved it!

Wonderful flavor and presentation. The quantity of sauce is scant - and would probably double the broth an wine next time to yield more sauce.

Excellent, easy, and my kids loved it...of course I did not have the lemons so I used lemon pepper instead. I will keep this on my quick and easy list.

Pleased with the recipe and the possibilites are endless for something fast. I used chix tenderloins which cook very quickly and are quite tender. I agree that the sauce should be doubled. I added diced up grape tomatoes and added some capers.

This was OK but not great. The flavors were a bit bland for my taste.

Was not impressed with the results. I'm not sure what I did wrong but the sauce never cooked down. Regardless the end result was not that great. I would have had less work and better flavor from just seasoning the chicken with some of by seasoning blends and baking it. Wasn't bad, just wasn't worth the effort.

I thought this was delicious and quick. I only used one breast because I was making it for just me, but I kept the same amount of sauce, using only a small amount of butter at the end. There was only a little sauce, but it was enough for one because it seemed concentrated (but really good). I didn't have an oven-proof pan on hand, so I just covered the pan and cooked it on low for about the same amount of time. (Maybe this had something to do with the amount of sauce? ) I put the chicken on a bed of the recommended spinach dish, which was also great.

Quick, easy, healthy, and (most importantly) delicious! I think my pan was too hot, so the sauce wasn't very saucy and the chicken was a little dry. But it was still great, and it spelled amazing. I will definitely make it again, making sure to control the heat better.

This was a great quick meal for my family. Did not use the butter at the end and got many compliments from my normally picky family. Will definitely make again!

I thought this was very flavorful!!! I did not even use the extra butter at end. There were enough juices that were thick and no butter was needed...Made my homemade mac and cheese which of course isn't as healthy as the Self recipe, but a very yummy weekday meal for me and my kids. Didn't use Herbes de Prvence, hard to get here, so used a combo of basil, oregano, thyme, and garlic powder, salt and pepper...

This is a delicious classic and my go-to recipe for boneless breasts. Tonight I made a nice variation - instead of the spinach I served it over a bed of steamed broccoli and orzo. Rather than the butter, I added some more broth and wine at the end and made a more copious, more brothy sauce. Delicious, healthy, fresh-tasting one-bowl meal!

Not that impressive. Based on the wonderful reivews, my expectations were sky high. The chicken was a bit dry (could have been my technique) and the sauce was just okay. Easy recipe, but not worth it.

Rating: 4
Quick, easy, and very good. Served it with sauteed baby spinach (great combo) and left out the lemon zest. I'm sure a good white wine is the way to go, but I am not a white wine drinker, so I paired it with my favorite Zinfandel and it was perfect.

Made the chicken exactly as instructed. It was a very tasty dish. Served it over cous cous. I will be making this dish again!

I'm going to reserve my "forks" until I make this again. Nice flavors but it needs more sauce, at least double, maybe more.

This is fantastic! I used half an onion because I didn't have a shallot and it was FANTASTIC!!

Easy, good, healthy and filling. I left out the butter, and the taste was still rich. I served over a bed of kale, blanched and then sauteed with some red pepper flakes, garlic and lemon. I think this will become a regular part of the reportoire.

This recipe was *so* excellent! I doubled the amount of garlic and will probably triple the amount next time. I also added a little extra wine and chicken broth, and the juice of a whole small lemon just to give the chicken a little more sauce. Since the recipe didn't mention how much of the Herbes de Provence to season with I have to say I went a little bit crazy and used about a 1/4 of the bottle on the 4 pieces of chicken - massaging it into both sides of each piece along with salt and pepper and then letting the chicken sit for about 15 minutes before lightly dusting with flour. It turned out perfect! I disagree with the earlier reviewer about the flour making the chicken soggy, for me it added an extra golden color and a nice texture. This is a definite keep and will be made again for sure!

This is an easy dish to make. I did not use the flour, as brynnem recommended! The herb de provance is a very different and unique spice. My only advice would be to add more garlic or perhaps some chili powder to give it a little more zing!

Pretty good and easy to make. I think next time I would do a few things differently. First, I would omit the flour. It didn't add anything to the dish and just resulted in a soggy crust. I made my husband's portion with no flour and it came out better. Second, I would reduce the lemon juice. It was overpowering, and I would've liked to taste more of the herbs on the chicken.
