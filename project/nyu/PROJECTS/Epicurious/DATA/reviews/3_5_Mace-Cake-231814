I've been looking for this recipe. Made it a few times when it came out in Gourmet. Delicious. Will now make again...

Love it! Very moist and plan on using the cake recipe to make other flavors. Two small children also gobbled it down. And yes, I used Penzey's Mace.

I HAVE MADE THIS CAKE MANY TIMES.iT WAS ALWAYS GOOD, BUT WITH A NEW JAR OF PENSEY`S MACE--WOW A GOOD ARGUMENT FOR TOSSING OLD STALE SPICES

I LOVE this recipe and have made it many times for home or taking to a friends. It's great as a coffeecake, for a brunch or after-school snack. Give it a try!!

I liked the cake. Although, I thought that a half cup of sugar on the top was a bit excessive (particularly with 2 cups of sugar in the cake). I served with whipped cream and the strawberries in red wine from this website as well.

Have made several times. Serve with strawberries and cream -- much, much better than shortcake.

Serve with fresh whipped cream and a slightly sweet Spanish sherry-WOW!

I thought the cake was a little bland (except for the mace flavor). If I were to make it again, I would let it darken more on top.

Great flavour and texture. Didn't change a thing with the recipe. Very easy to put together.

I forgot how good mace can taste on its own. This is a very flavorful and easy to bake cake. I added butter to the streusel (sugar and mace) to make a richer topping for the cake. Great with a cup of coffee.

delicious & so easy. LOvely texture, somewhat like a Victoria sponge. I did add some of Penzey's cake spice (1 tsp.) to the batter and a dash to the topping
