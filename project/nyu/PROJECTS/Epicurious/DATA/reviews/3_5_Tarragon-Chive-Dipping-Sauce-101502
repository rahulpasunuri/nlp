This was very good. It complimented the salmon cakes very well. The only change I made was to add more lime juice for some tartness. A definite keeper

I made this to accompany the Salmon Cakes and it was a perfect combination. I followed a previous suggestion and used whole-milk Greek yogurt from Trader Joe's instead of sour cream, which cut the fat content in half, and everyone loved it. Yes this would be good with chicken, or shrimp, or green beans, or anything else that works with tarragon. It was terrific licked off of my fingers, too.

My favorite dip ever for chicken or veggies. Refrigerates well for several days afterward.

This was a good dipping sauce, but I added 1 T lime juice and some salt to give it a little more flavor.

I found this was an excellent dipping sauce for artichokes. Don't be shy with the fresh herbs. I also substituted plain whole milk yogurt for the sour cream with great results.

I gave it one fork because it was easy to make. It tasted just like sour cream and looked just like sour cream, with little pieces of grass stuck in it. Mmmmmm!
