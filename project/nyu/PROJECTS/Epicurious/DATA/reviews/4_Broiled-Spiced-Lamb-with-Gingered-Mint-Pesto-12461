Alas. This didn't work out well in either my husband's or my taste opinion. I adore lamb with basil pesto -- but the mint twist here just didn't ignite us. ;-(

What a delicious blend of flavors! The cardamom mixed so beautifully with the pesto, and oh the pesto! Who knew mint, ginger, and cashews could make such a delectable combination! I used lamb shoulder chops and sauteed them instead of broiling, they came out tender and perfectly medium rare. I paired this with a baby portobello and goat cheese quinoa, some lightly seasoned green beans, and a nice malbec. It was a hit with everyone; I would definitely recommend this recipe!

My son (17!) made this recipe for Father's Day. The rub and the pesto go well together. The pesto makes the meal. We served this with a bordeaux. The butcher didn't have the cut of lamb, so we used lamb sirloin steaks (and broiled to medium rare). In hindsight, I would have done a boneless butterflied leg of lamb or a lamb London Broil as an alternative. We ended up with leftover pesto sauce, which we will use with pasta.

Excellent! The cardamon made the dish especially flavorful. I seared the lamb instead of broiling it and I aggree with the chef from Fairbanks, I would use less vinegar.

My husband (a cooking novice) picked up this recipe when we had a top round of lamb, and it was delicious! Not too difficult, either. The flavors meld really well, and the pesto is especially good.

Wow! The pesto and cardamom make a great combination. The only change I made was to cut the vinegear, since it made the sauce a little too tart for my taste. I served this with rice pilaf and roasted vegetables. It was a big hit!
