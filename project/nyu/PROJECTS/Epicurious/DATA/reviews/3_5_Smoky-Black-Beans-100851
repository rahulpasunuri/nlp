I'm really surprised how many positive reviews this recipe received! I have my go to recipe of black beans with cumin, garlic, onions, jalapeno, and a bit of mexican beer. It's fantastic, but was looking for something different. Although I can appreciate how easy and quick this recipe is, I feel it really lacks some depth in the taste. It is overly sweet, from the orange juice, and very watery (that's with the liquid cut in half). Esentially, all you taste is smoky orange juice. Won't make again.

I found this recipe looking for something to approximate the black beans at a local restaurant that have a smoky bbq flavor. These are dead simple and absolutely delicious. I used chipotle canned in adobo and fresh oj, just squeezed a couple oranges over a strainer into the pot, and added a few tablespoons of the adobo sauce with the beans.

Surprisingly good and easy. It made me a big chipotle fan. I melt a little cheese on top and throw on either salsa or avocado. Goes well over brown rice.

I wasn't that impressed with this dish the first time I made it, but I made it again anyway because it's so easy. This time I added less water to begin with as other reviewers recommended, doubled the chipotle to give it more kick and I also added some chopped fried bacon to make it more hearty and ate it on its own as a meal. I loved it this time, it's great for an easy pantry meal.

Simple and tastey. I make these often, and like to add some fresh sqeezed lime juice as well. I make a fairly dry version which is great in quesedillas. Leftovers keep for a couple days in the fridge for easy snacks and meals.

I saw this recipe and realized I had most of the ingredients in my kitchen right now, so I made up a batch! I didn't have any onion, although I might use onions next time I make this - although that would make the recipe a little less "quick". I used Embasa brand chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I used it sauce and all, scraping the can. The peppers are whole in the can and needed cutting with a knife and fork while I heated them up in the pan with olive oil. Then I opened a can of REFRIED black beans by accident so I put that in. Then I put in a can of black beans (drained). I put in enough orange juice to make it a good "dip" texture. It only took about 5 minutes to open all those cans and mix up the ingredients, then another 10 to warm them up together and mix them. I served it with a mixture of chips: Tostitos Light Restaurant Style and Tostitoes Natural Blue Corn (organic). It went perfectly with beer. It was so easy and tasty that I'm definitely making it again.

I hate to be in the minority, but I wish there was a 0 rating. We thought these beans were just awful!!!! They were bland and the little flavor they did have was icky. The old "pinto beans with bacon, onion,cumin, crushed red pepper and a dash of oregano" is by far superior, we feel.

I've been making this since it first appeared in Gourmet and even used store-bought o.j.once. It's delicious either way. The amount of water depends on how soupy you want your beans to be. It's a matter of taste, and how you're serving the beans. As a side dish, you may want less liquid; over rice, or as a main course served in a deep dish, soupier might be preferable.

This recipe is fast, easy, and delicious (not to mention, inexpensive and very low fat)! I use 2 chipotles and all oj, no water. I also add a touch of cumin and chopped cilantro or green onions at the end. I make this at least once a week as I always have these ingredients on hand. To make a complete meal, I add shredded, cooked chicken breasts to the beans at the end of cooking and serve over simple rice cooked with cumina and turmeric. Excellent and healthy!

Great recipe. The O.J. gave the dish a really great flavor. We used two canned chipotles for even more of a zip, and cut the water down by half, as recommended. Served the whole Tex-Mex shebang: chicken fajitas, homemade guacalmole, rice, and these wonderful beans. Yum!

A big hit at my dinner table this evening! We ate the beans with simple white rice. My father-in-law, who doesn't like rice, was thrilled with the kick the chipotle gave the dish and my mother-in-law, who hates food that is even the least bit spicy, absolutely loved this, as did my husband and I!

Previous reveiwers are right. Either add less water (1/2 cup), or be prepared to cook/reduce longer. Works great with black beans or pintos. Really needs a nice dash of cumin though (1 tbl.), and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Nice accompaniment to marinated-grilled pork or chicken.

Excellent recipe and easy to make. I agree that the water should be cut in half. Otherwise the beans would be the consistency of soup. I tried it with dried beans rather than canned, but since it made no difference in the result, I recommend sticking with the recipe and using canned beans to reduce the cooking time.

These are great but I would offer a few suggestions: cut the water down by half and use blood orage juice if you can find it (whenever I see them in the store, I buy a bunch, squeeze and freeze the juice.) I just served them this weekend with a jerk pork loin, salad and espresso flan. Yum-ola!

This dish was so easy and turned out great! It did require some salt, however...I highly recommend making this - delicious!
