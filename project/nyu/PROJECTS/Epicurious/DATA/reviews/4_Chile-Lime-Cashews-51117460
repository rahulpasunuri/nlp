Excellent recipe. The kaffir leaves really make this interesting and delicious.

These were exceptionally good. When I made them a second time, I dialed back the chile powder and subbed Garam Masala (just to see what it would be like). Fantastic! A twist I highly recommend.

very good simple idea for a party!

Just made this recipe as a preview for my annual holiday party. I really like it but I think it could be a bit spicier. The lime leaves are essential. The nuts are not greasy or too salty. I gave it 3 forks for delicious but not worthy of 4 for exceptional. I will be making this for the party.

Excellent. Everyone at Thanksgiving loved these and I got several requests for the recipe. Found the lime leaves, chiles, and ground ancho powder at a local Asian market. Followed the recipe exactly except roasted nuts longer to get them nice and golden. Will definitely make again.

I've been waiting for this: it's like the nuts they serve at the JW Marriott bars in Phuket, Thailand! Thanks BA! They also use it with corn nuts and peanuts. Note to cooks trying this: the lime leaves make a world of difference (wonderful)-- but be sure to cut them in hair-thin strips, as the taste is powerful (not the 1/4" strips recommended).

Delicious recipe. I made it without the kaffir lime leaves, and it was very good. It was spicy and falvorful. I will be making again. Makes a delicious, spicy snack.
