Chicken was so moist and tasted great in the salad. I have also made this with dried figs. I add goat cheese to the salad. What an easy recipe.

Wow! I made this as written (including the figs) for a barbecue where the hosts did the meats and the guests all brought some kind of salad. By far this was the most popular thing at the event. People kept shouting out "who made the salad with the figs?". Tonight I am making it for a cooking group and the theme is honey so I added some honey to the marinade/dressing and so far it tastes great.

The balsamic marinade is brilliant! Makes for very succulent chicken. I did (add the optional) figs to the salad which I broiled with some brown sugar to carmelize them. Delish!

Very much enjoyed. If you can't easily find fresh figs, try sliced dried dates. We loved them in it.

This was a nice change to Grilled Chicked Salad. My husband loved it. I has some papaya so sliced it and put around it. It was a nice touch for appearances and flavor.
