All the ingredients sounded great, lots of good reviews, so I made this per the recipe. Big disappointment. Lucky for me I able to give the rest away.

Tripled the recipe expecting 18 people-- only 12 showed, but there were no left-overs. Everyone went back for seconds. Used skinless,boneless thighs & made a day ahead. The parsleyed pasta was the perfect go-with. Would not hesitate to serve this at another dinner party...

This recipe was great, i used reg andouille sausage and also added a serrano pepper when i added the carrots and onions and it added way more spice, which i loved. It does take longer to make when you chop the veg yourself, so a food processor is helpful. definitely worth the time and also the calories.

Ragu is very nice, very tasty. I wish I'd used chicken thighs instead of substituting breasts (which is what I had handy)--more flavorful and moist. Also, I'd prefer the chicken shredded into the final ragu instead of cut in chunks.

Made this using boneless, skinless thighs-it was a lot less work, and came out simply delicious. Subbed dried oregano for the marjoram. Made it 2 days in advance, and served it at a ski tailgating party. A huge hit! Will make it again.

Based on the reviews, I can't wait to make this! Thanks for all of the tips and tweaks to the recipe. To those who think that this is time consuming, it is a Ragu, which should have tipped you off that this was going to be time consuming. I know that people are busy, but if you want to make food that tastes like it took hours to cook, then that's what you have to do, no matter what Raytard says.

I made a meatless version from fresh tomatoes with a little tomato paste. Didn't have the fresh marjoram, but it's just as good with dried!

This took a lot of time to prepare, but I was able to prepare it over a couple of days. I don't think the parsley butter added anything special with the ragu, but it was tasty by itself with the broccoli rabe.

I used pork andouille sausage because that is what I had. I subbed oregano for the marjoram. As suggested by another reviewer I did start the ragu with the onions, carrots, tomatoes, broth and seasonings so it could get a start and reduce a little while I browned the chicken and sausage. I deglazed the pan with white wine and combined. I expected it to have more interest, but I suspect it is all up to having quality sausage which maybe I didn't have. We did enjoy the leftovers. I did use the pasta with parsley butter and that was good, but the flavors were probably lost in the sauce.

Yum! I cut this recipe in half to make dinner for three and it was perfect. I substituted red wine for white, but other than that I kept the recipe as is. Very rich, full flavor. Served with rigatoni.

If you cook this recipe as written you'll find it to be delicious with a complex sauce. Use thighs with bone in order to give the ragu some flavor. I removed the skin with the exception of about 3 thighs, which cuts down the fat somewhat. I also added the bones back in when reducing the sauce and cooked it until any remaining meat fell off the bone. Absolutely delicious.

Rating: 4
I wish I had read through the recipe carefully because I would not have bought bone-in chicken thighs. Very labor intensive to bone! I also chose to skin the thighs to cut the fat. Next time I'll skip this step and buy boneless chicken thighs. Used thyme instead of Marjoram (about 2 tablespoons). Added peeled and quartered white potatoes (about 6 small) and only boiled sauce for about 10 minutes when I decided it had now become a stew so thickened it with a couple of teaspoons of corn starch mixed in with about 1/3 cup sauce mixture. Added 3 quarterd and sliced small zucchini in the end. Okay...I'll admit, it doesn't sound like the same recipe, but is was truly delish and we didn't even miss the pasta!

This is a great recipe, but I tweak it a bit. I use boneless, skinless thighs; red wine instead of white; italian seasoning with marjoram (instead of just marjoram); a 1- pound bag of baby carrots; and I add 2 bay leaves. Much richer this way!

Nothing to rave about. I did not like it and my husband though it was one of Campbell soups!!! Won't make it again.

A good, hearty stew, not over the top great, but definitely something to keep in mind. Changes I would make in the future: Crushed tomatoes instead of diced, boneless/skinless chicken with additional pre-bought chicken bones would cut down the prep time considerably.

Super dish, best served with the parsley butter.

This is really good. Definitely use the andouille sausage, and the marjoram: both add a really interesting flavor. I served this with the accompanying pasta, which was very good. Be sure to use a shape of pasta that will pick up the ragu well.

Rating: 3
I wouldn't serve this up a dinner party but it's perfectly suited for a weeknight family meal. My family, like other reviewers', doesn't do "dark meat" so I used cut-up chicken breast (no bones). Other reviewers commented about letting the flavors blend, so I decided to expedite the melding a bit by cooking the chicken and andouille together, and, instead of serving the ragu over pasta, adding the cooked pasta to the ragu at the end -- the pasta helped thicken the ragu liquid and it absorbed the flavors for more 'melding'. I didn't have marjoram, so I chopped up a Tbsp of fresh thyme. I served the end result straight off the stovetop and it was quite tasty!

Excellent and unique recipe. I couldn't find marjoram so I substituted oregano and some thyme I had in the fridge. Also I left the meat on the bone till the very end. Seemed unnecessary to carve it off in the beginning. Flavors were amazing.

This is one of the reasons I look forward to winter! I've made this ragu many times and have even used boneless, skinless chicken thighs with great results; but the bones do add a depth to the stew. Time consuming but worth it...left overs are even better.

I have made this recipe twice. It is much better the second day after the flavors have had a chance to mingle a little bit. Generally a good recipe to make a day or two in advance of when you would need to serve it because of the cooking time it requires.

Very Good...A lot of work but not if you prepare in advance. Much better if alowed to sit over night!! WELL WORTH THE EFFORT

Rating: 3
This is very good, and it's wonderful the next day. A few notes: The marjoram flavor is very strong, so scale back a bit unless it's your favorite herb. Also, when this is served with the Campanelle Pasta with Parsley Butter, the lemon flavor is also very strong -- so between the ragu & the pasta, you get a heavy marjoram-lemon flavor that nearly overpowers the other flavors, so next time I'll use only 1 tsp lemon peel in the pasta.

My family and friends love this recipe. I substitute boneless chicken breasts for the thighs, as a personal choice, and for ease and time. I have shared this recipe with many friends, all of who now make it as a family favorite.

Rating: 2
I thought this was pretty good, but my family can't get past the thought of eating chicken thighs (they like white meat only). Apart from that, they did like it, although pretty spicy from the sausage for my 10 yr. old, and I didn't even use a whole pound! I used fresh rosemary instead of marjoram and cut it down to 1/4 cup. I didn't make the pasta as recommended, just made buttered rigatoni, still great comfort food, though.

Rating: 3
I've made this twice and it really is a nice dish. One suggestion -- if you're a fan of the old faithful Silver Palate Chicken Marbella - is to make the Chicken Marbella for a meal one night and save the leftovers (since it makes more than enough for an average family) for this dish. Cut the chicken from the bones, then use the bones as directed. It works beautifully and saves a few steps on day 2. Also, I use a bit less marjoram than the recipe calls for; it can overwhelm a bit.

I made this recipe last week just to get a different spin on pasta and sauce. The only thing I changed was the Andouille Sausage due to the supermarket strike; I could't get it. I substituted Hillshire Farms beef smoked sausage and it came out fantastic! The family and friends who happened to stop by around dinner time said it was the best dinner I ever cooked! I'm still shocked because everyone is still talking about it! Being a gourmet cook, as many of you out there are, I rarely ever "do not" cook a full dinner and I've reviewed many recipes on this site. I've been collecting Bon Appetit since the late 70's when I was still going through adolesence.

With the grocery store strike, we had to make this with what we had on hand, even so, it was delicious. We used boneless skinless chicken breasts that we cooked seperately, cut into bite size pieces, and added in for the last 15 minutes. Used beef andouille, dried Marjoram (about 1-2 tsp.), and had no parsley for the compound butter. Despite all of the changes, this was still comfort food at its finest. The buttered noodles made the dish with the wonderful layering of flavors. A definite keeper.

My family really enjoyed this. More time-consuming and more ingredients than I usually use, but worth it. Used boneless, skinless thighs, and just 1/2 t. dried marjoram (thought the sausage was flavorful enough.) Used chicken andouille sausage from Costco--it wasn't greasy at all. There was a lot of liquid to reduce. Next time I would start the ragu with the onions, carrots, tomatoes and broth and seasonings so it could get a start and reduce a little while I browned the chicken and sausage in a saute pan, then would deglaze that pan with the wine. This way I think that you wouldn't have to remove the meat to reduce the sauce at the end. It would probably also be good with Italian sausage and rosemary as suggested by another reviewer. A great make ahead party dish. Served with buttered wide egg noodles. Great!

This was fantastic. The only thing I did differently was skin the chicken. I highly recommend this dish for casual dinner parties.

I first saw this dish on Micheal Smiths "Chef at Large", decided to give it a try. It is definately worth the effort! People, if you don't take the time to debone the chicken, you can put it in whole. Then the dish is kinda like a cacciatore. Still very good, and the point of the bones is to add more flavour to the dish so the Sausage doesn't overpower it. I couldn't find the camponelli pasta, so I tried it with Potato Gnocchi, and it ruled! If you can't get marjaram, try to use a little fresh rosemary instead. I think it goes better with the dish anyways, compliments the sausage and the wine better. (Also great for the winter!)

I thought this dish was awesome! A friend brought it the first time. I immediatley made it for some new friends. Everyone loved it. You must use chicken thighs as they have so much more flavor. Next time I would use boneless, skinless thighs to cut down the time (as my friend did)

Wonderful pasta dish. Very flavorful.

Rating: 3
This was delicious...with some changes. I prefer skinless boneless breasts but they dry out so I cooked them separately and added them at the end. For sausage I used pre-cooked chicken mild Italian sausages and they were perfect, not greasy and not over-powering. Parsley butter was good but not worth the effort, plain pasta is fine. As others have said the flavor is best when it is made one day ahead.

Rating: 3
This is a rich, hearty stew that did, in fact, get more flavorful and spicier from resting a day before serving. I skinned the chicken thighs after cooking and deboned them to make eating this less messy. Also skimmed the excess fat from the broth to help lighten it up! It does take time, but as a make-ahead dish that is so delicious, it's darn near perfect! Served it with a delicious, fruity zinfandel that helped soften some of the spice and blended beautifully.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and I thought that the andouille sausage completely overwhelmed the dish. It was so spicy that all of the other flavors were obscured, and it was pretty unpleasant to eat. That being said, I bet the dish is great with a milder sausage, and I am eager to try it again.

Very, very good. Do: reduce the sauce (makes it much more flavorful); use andouille, or another hearty sausage. Don't bother: deboning (works just fine with whole chicken thighs); making parsley butter (there is plenty of fat left in the bowl!); using fresh marjoram (hard to find around here and the strong flavors would overwhelm--dried is fine). Will definitely make again, with less fuss.

Thankfully this came out well, I'd sworn not to make it again after boning the chicken thighs. I found it took a great deal of time but was worth the effort. My guests raved about this as well as the parsley pasta and sourdough baguettes with manchego cheese and roasted red peppers. A magnificent winter meal.

OK, there must be something about this recipe that makes us all want to cook it at the same time! I made this dish yesterday during the kids nap time, refrigerated it overnight, put it in the crock pot around 2pm and dinner was ready after baseball practice. Served some fresh french bread and watched it disappear! We very rarely call a recipe "A Keeper", but this one made the hit list. I used bonelss skinless chicken thighs and didn't thinkt that it was too musch trouble. A good "Sunday " meal, but not for the typical rushed family week-night dinner. One word! Yum!

I made this recipe based upon the rave reviews. It is fabulous and will be added to my collection of all-time favorites. I reduced the ingredients by half and it provided five generous servings. I also increased the wine, chicken broth, and seasonings to allow for more liquid. Boning the chicken thighs was time consuming but friends suggested I purchase boneless thighs in the future. This one's a keeper.

This recipe was WONDERFUL! Although a bit time-consuming, I thought it was worth it. I did not reduce the sauce which was fine with me and my guests and instead of serving it with pasta, I used jasmine rice (which absorbed the unreduced sauce). Overall, me and my guests were impressed with how good this dish turned out (an impromptu dinner party). I gave the recipe to several co-workers which I insist they make immediately! Enjoy!

I was very anxious to try this, sounded great. It makes a lot of food. Also, it involved so much "dinking around" with the chicken that by dinner time I couldn't even look at it anymore. It was flavorful, but not really worth the effort. My hubby took leftovers to share with the guys at work and they all loved it. At least the hours I spent on this dish fed a lot of people. Beware, this dish takes more time than it you'd think when you read the recipe for the first time. Everything seemed overcooked and lifeless on the plate,added a sprinkle of chopped parsley which helped the appearance. The wine was great though!!

This stew is simple to make, everything in it is discernable, but the flavors are layered and interesting. All 20 people at the table asked for the recipe; they polished off the ragu but left me with most of the noodles (which overall were a waste of time). I made a couple of changes: I used kosher smoked polish sausage instead of the andouille, and I used Barilla green and black olive tomato sauce instead of the canned tomatoes.

To reduce the fat content I drained the chicken and sausage after cooking on paper towels which resolved the issue raise by previous reviews. It's really a great recipe and perfect for cold snowy evenings -- the fact that you can make it ahead is a total bonus.

Something went wrong with the making of this recipe for me. I suspect the wrong type of sausage, which totally overpowered the dish. The sauce was also greasy.
