This is a very rich and delicious recipe. I changed a couple of things. The original recipe was a little too thin, so I added 1 1/2 more cups of powdered sugar. Also I added 2 cups of coconut to the icing. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

When making this cake, I should have used my better judgement when the recipe said to add flour, then the cream of coconut...I think it would have been a softer more tender cake if they were added alternately... The frosting, 2 8 oz pkgs of cream cheese is overwhelming in the taste...takes away from the coconut flavor. If you are looking or a heavy cake...this may be the one for you...I am looking for something a bit lighter with great flavor...

This is such a good frosting. I can see endless possiblities for it. How about a little lemon zest and juice in place of the coconut cream, and use it on a lemon cake. Just amazed. I didn't find it to sweet with the ingredients just the way they are listed in the recipes. I wish I would have had coconut extract though to give it a more coconut flavor. We'll see how it turns out though after the shredded coconut is placed on the cake. No matter what, it is going to be good.

I made this to go with the Coconut Layer Cake, and it was delicious. The only modification I made was adding 1 tsp. coconut extract; other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and I did not have a problem with the frosting being too soft, runny, or overly sweet. It is very rich.

Based on reviews from others, I reduced the amount of powdered sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups. It was sweet, but not overly sweet imo. And, while it could have been a tad more stiff, it still held together.

This frosting is amazing!!! I made it with Fun Fetti cupcakes and it was super good. I used coconut cream and it was awesome.

this is very easy and not overly sweet. You might use a little less cream of coconut as it makes the icing quite soft.

The frosting and coconut cake meant to accompany it are delicious! I have had repeat requests for this cake (and frosting).

Too much butter and cream cheese - I cut it in half - it worked out well

Be certain to mix the Coco Lopez thoroughly before adding. It separates in the can so you need to scrape the entire contents out to mix the paste from the bottom. Failure to do so will ruin your results. This is true for ANY recipe that calls for canned coconut milk (sweetened or unsweetened).

This, along with the coconut cake recipe recommended to go along with it, is one of the best cake recipes you'll ever have in your collection. Use only the finest and freshest ingredients. The heartburn comment must be a prank or they have a more serious health problem, or perhaps used inferior products. Made this cake 6 times and received dramatic praise!

No forks for this one. Ugh! Coconut? Are you kidding me? This is disgustingly sweet. Unless you love sugar, sugar DO NOT make this recipe! Two days later I still have heartburn.

This is NOT the recipe from the restaurant as stated. There is no coco lopez in the original; it's just a cream cheese frosting. It should read: 3/4 lb cream cheese, 1/4 lb butter (softened), 2C confect. sugar, 3/4 tsp vanilla extract.

I've made this many, many times to go with the Coconut Layer Cake recipe from this site (Bon Appetit December 1999) - and I make it exactly per the recipe. AWESOME and DIVINE would be two good words to describe it.

My rating is for the recipe as written. Here's my version of a great coconut flavored (or plain) cream cheese frosting for 24 cupcakes or a two layer cake 16 oz cream cheese, softened 3 sticks (3/4 pound) unsalted butter, softened 1 tsp vanilla 1 tsp coconut extract or any other flavor you like, or just add a little more vanilla if you like 3 cups confec. sugar 2 Tbsp cream of coconut(optional)or a liqueur if you like, just enough for spreading consistency refrigerate at least one hour before using if it is too stiff, let soften a little before frosting the cake, or add just another tbsp or two of liquid

I enjoyed this recipe with carrot coconut cupcakes. I think it could be a little sweeter but is good.

I used this frosting for the "Coconut Layer Cake" that it goes with on this site (which, by the way, is the best cake I've ever made). Based on the reviews, I beat all the frosting ingredients together first, without the cream of coconut, then added 1/2 t. coconut extract and about 2 T. cream of coconut. My batch tasted fantastic and had the perfect consistency!

The directions on how much of the Coco Lopez to put in the cake(coconut layer cake) vs. how much to put in the frosting recipe are horrible! Nowhere does it say exactly how much to put in either. I know I put too much of the Coco Lopez in the frosting and it was really runny and wrong. Next time I would use maybe 1/4-1/3 of the can in the frosting and put the rest in the cake.

This icing is fabulous. Just chill it a little before icing cake if it is too thin. Karen

I have to agree with the other cooks. This "frosting" is more like an icing - it was very loose - I, too, found myself adding more of the other ingredients in hopes that it would thicken - I even tried chilling it - it never set up to the consistency I was hoping for. Also, very disappointed in the flavour - was expecting a more coconut-y flavor - very disappointing.

To make traditional cake frosting, the recipe needs an additional 6-8 cups of confectioners' sugar, resulting in enough frosting for 3-4 double layer cakes! Halve the cream cheese, double the sugar, and you should be okay. This is not a well-thought out recipe.

This is NOT the recipe from the Shubox Cafe. Their recipe has 1/4 lb butter, 3/4 lb creamcheese, 2 C powdered sugar and NO cream of coconut. It is much better than this version. This one is far too sweet.

This frosting recipe is fine as is ... thick as the stuff you'd find in a can! You guys MUST be using "Coconut Milk" instead of "Cream of Coconut" ... big difference! Cream of coconut has a very gel-like consistency ... not liquidy at all! (Future recipe makers, make note: Take these reviews with a grain of salt ... they are not always true!)

This is the 2nd time making this cake.i remedied the problem of being too runny by adding a 13 oz bar of lindt white confection.(i got this idea from a frosting for a red velvet cake.)i also added a few ounces of flour and corn starch.To make this cake ridiculously rich i cut each cake horizontally in half and filled it with a white chocolate filling from the "Chocolate-Glazed Coconut-Almond Cake",also from this web site. I usually make my cakes and cookies by taking certain ingrediants that i like from 2 or even 3 different recipies.

This frosting was way too tangy and soft. I heeded the advice of some previous reviewers and I only added a couple tablespoons of the coconut milk for flavor, and I added a lot more powdered sugar. It still wouldn't set up worth a darn, not a good thing when you're trying to frost a layer cake. It did firm up a little after being in the fridge overnight. I think next time I'll just dust off my old carrot cake recipe and adapt the frosting from it.

I really liked the taste of this frosting, too, but it was definitely too "liquidy." The second time I made it, I cut down on the coco-lopez (which is basically the liquid part of the recipe)and added a little coconut extract instead. It's not that easy to find in grocery stores, but you can order it through King Arthur Flour. With the extract in place of the cream of coconut, it tasted almost exactly the same but had a much better consistency.

The taste of this frosting is exemplerary, however I found it too thin to adhere to the cake without running. I added more powdered sugar to try and stabilize it, but doing this diminishes the nice cream cheese taste. I also tried refrigerating it for approximately 20 minutes prior to adding to the cake and sill no noticeable difference in the consistency of the frosting. Something is missing to thicken the consistency without changing the taste. bbennet in Miami
