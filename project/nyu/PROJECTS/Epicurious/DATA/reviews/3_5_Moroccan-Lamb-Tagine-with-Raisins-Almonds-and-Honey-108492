This is an outstanding recipe and a crowd pleaser. I made my own ras-el-hanout - it's simply a mixture of spices, very easy to make (you can find a recipe at http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/maindishes/r/ras_el_hanout_recipe.htm). I don't like my tagines very sweet, so I put a third less honey in and only used a cup of raisins. I thought there were too many almonds - if I make it again I would only use half of what's called for. But it is delicious and fail-proof. If you use lamb shoulder and cook it over very low heat (until the end when you let some of the liquid boil off), you cant mess it up, it will turn out succulent. I highly recommend!

I substituted beef broth for the water. EXCELLENT!

I was a little hesitant about making this recipe when I saw the requirement for 'ras-el-hanout'. I shouldn't have worried as there are lots of recipes for simply combining the necessary spices. Perhaps the recipe could have mentioned that this can be made up fairly easily. Notwithstanding this, the tagine was superb and definitely enhanced by the suggestions of previous reviewers, especially cutting back on the honey but keeping a lot of connective tissue in the lamb. I've now made this twice, with rice and couscous. Both were agreeable accompaniments and the meals were enjoyed by our guests.

This is my second review of this dish, which I love. But in making this recipe most recently, I used lamb shoulder rather than leg of lamb, and it made a huge difference. The extra (I hate to say it) fat and connective tissue in the shoulder cut gave the lamb much more tenderness and made the whole dish even more flavorful than using leg of lamb. I think for any kind of stew, you need to use a cut of meat that has a lot of connective tissue and enough fat so that the meat will be able to sustain long cooking times without drying out and becoming too tough. I'll be making this dish again tomorrow, and look forward to another great meal!

Fantastic recipe! It tasted awfully close to a tagine I had in Morrocco. I made just a few changes...browned the lamb, added cardamom and cut down on the amount of almonds.

Rating: 4
A smashing success! Given the sweetness of the raisins, I followed the advice of the other reviewers and reduced the honey (I was making a half recipe--my clay pot is a bit smallish and there's just the two of us at my house), I used a very scant tablespoon. I also only used a dab of butter since the meat provided plenty of fat content. All in all, a fabulous dish we will certainly make again soon!

This was a delicious dish. I recommend making it at least one day ahead. I didn't know what "ras-el-hanout" was, but I looked it up and it is a spice combination which includes cardamom, clove, cinnamon, ground chili peppers, coriander, cumin, nutmeg, peppercorn, and turmeric. So I combined any of these spices I happened to have around. I would recommend several modifications. Cut the amount of butter by half. Instead of water, use beef broth, but then reduced the salt by half. I also added some ground red pepper (you'll have to do this by taste--some like it hotter than others). The sweetness of the dish needed to be counterbalanced by the heat of the pepper in my opinion. The dish was a bit runny. I would dredge the lamb pieces (I used leg of lamb instead of shoulder) in flour before cooking. When reheating, things might get too runny again, in which case, just add a bit of flour mixed with water to the mixture. I served the dish with couscous. I also served a cucumber salad in which I peeled and diced the cucumbers (removing all seeds), added chopped green onions, chopped parsley, and a combination of Greek yogurt and plain yogurt. It was a hit. I loved being able to make everyting ahead of time. Enjoy!

I made this soon after a trip to Morocco with a newly acquired Tangine pot. Not only did the recipee come out wonderfully but it was as good as the majority of tangine dishes we ate had in there (although certainly not all). I find that the recipee works equally well with chicken thighs.

Made it for a group and they loved it. I had made tagines before that were too sweet, so I took the advice previous reviewers and did not add honey. It was just sweet enough. I did not have the ras-el-hanout; I look forward to trying it again with it. I also cooked it for a longer period... But my friends are still talking about it, so it must have been good.

Excellent, excellent flavor. A few notes on where I went off the ranch: I didn't have the on hand, so I chased down a recipe for it here: http://www.recipezaar.com/Ras-El-Hanout-87818 And added a few things--a teaspoon of hot curry powder, and a teaspoon of hot paprika. Instead of stirring the spices into water--I mixed it into flour, deedged the lamb cubes in the flour/spice mix and then browned the meat in oil. In lieu of water, I used organic chicken broth--and substituted dried apricots for the raisins. My dinner guests all declared it to be the best lamb they'd even eaten--and all stepped off into the night happily holding a small tupperware to-go portion.

This was excellent. I prepared it pretty much as described, except that I already had a top quality Moroccan rub mixture which I used instead of the spices in the recipe. Also I let it simmer about one additional hour uncovered and found that this made a big difference, allowing the color and flavors to deepen.

Rating: 3
Easy to make and very satisfying to eat and serve. I was glad to have taken the advice to use less honey as the raisins are already sweet, and to quarter the almonds. The ras el hanout was difficult to source so I used a good quality mild curry and it turned out fine.

Rating: 4
Incredibly good and easy to make. Proportionnaly, whole almonds were too big. I used quartered and it was perfect.

This was a four star recipe, at least having made the following changes. Instead of adding spices and lamb to water, I tossed the lamb cubes in a bit of ras-el-hanout and then browned them. After searing the cubes, I added all of the water, spices, onions, etc and cooked as suggested. Following other suggestions, I used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 stick butter. It turned out to be the best lamb I've ever cooked.

This was absolutely delicious! Loved the mix of spices, the texture of the lamb and the raisins and almonds together. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make this one again.

This was tasty but definitely too much butter. I would decrease it by more than half if I made this again. I did feel like it could use something else - not sure what but something to make it a bit heartier and more colorful - I guess veggies.

I left out lots of the extra spices, using the ras el-hamout. It reminds me of Chinese five-spice powder if you need a substitute. I am making it again for Monday!

A rich, satisfying dish, everyone raved about it. The key is the freshness of your spices. I added 12oz of a fire roasted crushed tomato, to balance out the richness of the lamb broth, and I think it also added some more visual interest. Didn't need a thing otherwise.

Fantastic combination of flavours, I took note of previous reviews and used less honey, next time will add dried apricots and may substitute chicken.

You can find ras-el-hanout in two sizes and mixes at Cost Plus World Market. The smaller package, with a better spice blend (in my opinion) is only $1.50 here in WA and has at least 3 tablespoons in it.

Good dish but not quite the tagine I was looking for. There was something off about the flavor but with all the spices I don't think I can pinpoint what it was. It was a fair amount of effort and I probably wouldn't bother again.

PS -- couldn't find saffron either...big mystery, because I thought stores in nyc had such an incredible variety of all sorts of things. Anyway, it was still fabulous without it.

Fabulous, easy dish! I used skinless, boneless chicken but only had about 1.75 pounds. No big deal, it turned out wonderfully. Used less honey than the recipe called for, because other reviewers said it was too sweet. Loved it! I couldn't find ras-el-hanout (even at Fairway in NYC), but I made my own after I checked out some online recipes for it. You could be really creative with this dish. Next time I might add dried apricots & maybe some carrots. Fantastic! Also, this is a great dish to do when you're home, but have lots of other odds & ends going on. It just simmers and simmers. Easy!

Very good, and tastes like what we ate in Morocco. I halved the honey, as the real Moroccan dish is indeed too sweet. It did take forever to cube the lamb shoulder, since I tried to remove the fat and membranes.

I've made this recipe several times, a couple of times in a real "tagine" an it's become one of my standards. If there was a criticism, it would be that the recipe as-is is a bit sweet; I usually cut the honey and cinnamon powder in half. Note: this recipe freezes very well, so I frequently double or triple it with good results.

This was good, but not great. I made it the night before my dinner party (using slivered almonds and the spice mix from this website) - the next day I needed to add more spices and then strained the meat and boiled the sauce to thicken. I served it over seven-vegetable couscous (minus the raisins and lima beans), topped with chunky onion harissa to counterpoint the tagine's sweetness. My guests were appreciative but it just didn't wow me, so I probably won't make it again.

I've made this a few times now and it is delicious. True, it's a bit on the sweet side, and depending on your taste, the almonds might be too many. None of this stopped the three people I've made it for from complementing the dish. One of whom doesn't even like lamb! I'm not even that crazy about lamb and I quite like this.

Great recipe!! I loved this dish and will definitely be making it again. I didn't have ras-el-hanout and used garam masala instead...i also added prunes and used sliced almonds, though I thicker ones would have been better like the recipe called for. I also salvaged the bones from the lamb meat and mixed those in for extra flavor during the simmering process.

This dish was amazing. So easy to do, and a huge hit with my guests. I used leg of lamb, prepared the dish a day in advance, and skimmed off the fat before I reheated it. I also used Turkish raisins, which gave it a richer taste.

I made this recipe last night with a friend who just returned from Africa with a armful of spices including saffron of which I was the lucky recipient. The dish was fabulous! We added cauliflower for texture and agreed that it was an excellent addition. We also agreed that using half the amount of almonds would be more than enough. The house smelled wonderful and the dish was relatively easy to make. A perfect recipe to allow friends to catch up!

Delicious. I halved the portions to make less but forgot to halve the water -- I thought it would be ruined but I just thickened it for a little bit longer at the end and it was beautiful served with some couscous drizzled with a little olive oil. I took the advice of another post here and used flaked almonds instead of whole ones but after eating it I think whole ones would have been fine too. 'Matures' nicely in the fridge for the next day!

This is a crowd pleasing dish. I agree with many of the reviews in that the almonds were a bit too much. One guest actually asked if the "beans" were supposed to be crunchy! I would recommend using fewer almonds and refrain from using whole ones altogether. Slivered (not sliced) almonds would have worked much better. Other than that the dish was wonderfully sweet and rich. I used Bon Appetit's recipe for ras el hanout from January 2002 which is found on this website. I had enough leftover after using it in this recipe to use it as a rub on a chicken.

As a graduate of the Hotel School of Lausanne and now living in the Provence where I cater to a few selective people. I tried this recipe after having tried a few French Morrocan ones: This was the best that I have tried so far. The honey was too much. I would reduce it by half. Poix chiche or Chick pees are more Moroccan than almonds (almonds are from the south of France), therefore chick pees would suit the dish better. If one has a Cousance pot, reduce the cooking time by one to two thirds if not meat reduces to filaments. If using traditional Moroccan cooking platters the time is enough.

Wow. I made this in an attempt to replicate the lamb tagine at a great little San Francisco restaurant called Baraka. They use prunes instead of raisins and also add some cooked garbanzo beans, so I did the same. It was amazing -- the meat is so tender and the sauce thickens really nicely once you add the fruit. I substituted two types of garam masala and a tiny bit of chinese 5 spice powder for the ras el-hanout and it seemed like the taste was a fair approximation. Next time I might add less almonds and less prunes as the recipe could be a bit less sweet and there are almost 2 almonds in every bite with this amount. But that's a personal thing and all in all I thought this recipe was fantastic. I will be making it again and again.

This is one of my favorite recipes - I get cravings if I go more than a month without making it and it makes the house smell great. I've started using venison since I have a freezer full of it, and it works just as well. I only use about a tablespoon of honey, but otherwise it's great as is. So, so good.

This is a delicious and easy recipe and it tastes better the next day. I'll use less liquid next time.

This is one of my favorite dishes! I substitute currants for the raisins and reduce the liquid to really get that great flavor. If you go to an international market, look for dried, whole lemons- one added to the stew makes a nice addition, as well as adding some whole cardamom pods. I took some to the owner of the Middle Eastern store where I buy my spices and he has since called and asked that I make it again. It is just that good!

Having eaten many tagines in Morocco, I'd say that this rendition isn't bad at all! Helps if you have the special, conical-shaped cooking vessel from which this type of dish takes its name. In Morocco, the tagine is served beside (not over) the couscous, which is often flavoured with tangerine juice or orange blossom water. Slow simmering is key to allow the fat on the meat to melt into the pot, yeilding an unctiously tender, falling apart piece of meat. try toasting the raisins and almonds together before adding to the dish near the end.

To cook from Australia, tumeric is no substitute for saffron!!! They taste completely different. ADDITONAL COMMENT to Cook on 09/26/03: I KNOW what tumeric is called--they can call it Ralph if they want, but it won't change the fact that it TASTES DIFFERENT. And if color is your only criteria, add food coloring.

An FYI to the cook from NY, saffron and tumeric may taste differently, but tumeric is well known as the "poor man's" saffron, as it adds the same color to a dish as saffron and is commonly used as a substitute.

Very nice! Very fragrant! Only thing that I would change would be to add fewer almonds. They become a bit overpowering and make an already rich stew even richer. I used a mixture of loin and shoulder meat and it was wonderful!

Meat was very tasty and tender. Flavors were great. However the stew was very greasy. I probably wouldn't make it again, if I did I would use a leaner part of lamb than the shoulder - maybe a leg cut. Did find several recipes for the spice mix online. that was not a problem.

I used this quick substitute for ras-el-hanout: 1 teaspoon Garam Masala, 1 teaspoon Chinese Five Spice, and two star anise. This recipe was magnificent. Star anise can also be hard to find, can use a pinch of ground anise or allspice or a few splashes of anisette (liquor). Also, I served it over a Toasted Pine Nut Couscous mix made by Near East and commonly available in grocery stores. It was a perfect accompaniment.

A substitute for saffron is tumeric.

Rating: 0
Saffron's flavor is hard to describe, it's very pungent and aromatic. You should be able to find saffron in the spice aisle of most large supermarkets, but be sure to get threads and not powder. Often the powder is adulterated with turmeric to extend it, as it has a similar color. As for the res-al-hanout, just from reading the description of the stuff (50 different spices?!) I doubt there's a good substitute. I suppose you could try garam masala, but you might have to go to an Indian market to find it as it's not as common as the saffron.
