Used silicon muffin pan so it didn't brown up as I might like but it tasted perfect.

This recipe sounds delicious and I plan to try it. What's all the fuss from people about adding bacon? I have Jewish friends who do and some who do not eat pork. So what? Can't non-observant Jews eat Kugel? How about non-Jews? Please be tolerant! Not everyone thinks like you do! This is the first review I've ever written to epicurious although I've been a reader for many years. I just felt like mentioning that people who aren't Jewish should be able to cook and eat "Jewish" food without criticism! If you don't eat bacon, don't add it!

I prefer savory kugel to sweet and this one was the best I've ever had (sorry, Mom). Thanks to the excellent tips here, I reduced the butter by about a tablespoon, used a mixture of yellow onion and leek, used reduced fat ricotta instead of cottage cheese (but used regular sour cream), and used mustard seeds instead of poppy seeds to add texture and a little zing. I also increased the salt & pepper a bit. Baking the kugel in a muffin tin makes for a fabulous presentation and creates lots of nice crispy edges. Love this recipe and all of your tips!

These are phenomenal! Perfect for a holiday meal or a small potluck. I used ricotta instead of the cottage cheese.

Very yummy and also pretty presentation. I used low fat cottage cheese and sour cream and it was still very rich. I passed on the poppy seeds as others had recommended. Next time I will cut back on the butter as I don't think it was necessary. I liked to keep it in the oven a little longer to firm it up and make the tops even more crusty. Great Christmas eve with Apricot Ginger Chicken that I found on Epicurious. It was a savory counterpart to the sweet main dish.

I took the advice of many of the reviewers and decreased the butter by not quite half. I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese - and subbed a bit of parmesan for the ricotta (like a quarter cup in a doubled batch). I also added some chopped garlic to the onions towards the end of their browning time. I also added fresh chopped sage. I doubled this recipe to make for a BBQ I was hosting and received rave reviews. I even had a guest be bold enough to ask if he could take a couple home with him. It wasn't until later that I realized that in doubling the recipe, that I neglected to double the eggs... so I used four instead of eight. I think the only downside to this was that the kugel didn't hold together as well as they otherwise might have.... they were a bit tricky to get out of the muffin tins... but I don't think the flavor was lacking at all. In fact, I'm afraid they would have been too eggy had I used all eight. I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on the tops about twenty minutes into the baking time... which added a nice extra flavor. I will definitely make these again!

Totally forgetting that I had made this and reviewed it six years ago, I once again dug into my Epi recipe box last night and made a 1/2 recipe of these little kugels in muffin tins. Used finely chopped leeks, Vidalia spring onion, and a shallot for a unique oniony flavor. So easy, tasty, lovely presentation, definitely worth repeating.

What attracted me to this recipe was the individual portions, as my mother used to make individual potato kugels in muffin tins for Passover. Kugel can be as touchy a subject as stuffing, everyone in the family clinging to their sacred recipe. Since the passing of my grandmothers and mother, the Orange Currant Noodle kugel on this site has become my signature kugel for brunches and dairy suppers. This one is a kugel of a different sort - totally savory, not sweet like the more traditional - but still very good and worth repeating. I put the ingredients together exactly as written, using sweet onions and letting them brown for about 25-30 minutes, but opted to make it as one large kugel, in a Le Creuset tarte tatin pan - perfect size. The adjusted cooking time was 45 minutes. a novel accompaniment to the Moroccan Slow-Cooked Lamb dish also on this site.

My wife and guests loved it, but I think a little more spice might improve it. Perhaps a little mustard or sharp cheese to give it a little bite. As suggested I doubled the noodles and that was the right call by nokelleh. To make the onions go faster, I just microwaved them for 15 minutes then browned them in a skillet. To make it a little more heart healthy, I used non-fat sour cream and non-fat ricotta asw suggested by cjbwein. A definite keeper for parties.

Where in the ingredients does it say bacon? Traditional jewish meals do not include bacon or any pork. Not sure where these reviewers got the bacon from.

Rating: 2
They tasted good, but I think the noodle-to-other stuff ratio was too small. I was looking forward to the crisped-up noodles and that didn't happen. Also, I'd broil them towards the end and maybe throw some cheese on top to get browned.

We made this recipe for a Purim Party. All the guests loved it! I doubled the recipe and made it in 2 casserole dishes and used fine noodles and red onions. I've never made kugel before, but I'll definitely be making it again!

Made this for Shabbat dinner, used ricotta cheese and not nearly as much butter as the recipe called for. I did not add bacon because that would have upset my guests.

This was a great success and my guests at Rosh Hashana dinner loved these. A few changes I made - I used part skim ricotta instead of the cottage cheese and I used low fat sour cream. Additionally, there is really no need for using that much butter. I cut it down to half a stick and I could have taken it down even further. I also eliminated the poppy seeds.

This dish was a hit at our recent Rosh Hashana celebration. I did not alter the recipe at all.

I caramelized the onions in about 1/4 C of olive oil instead of the butter. Like other people before me, I omitted the poppy seeds and added chopped garlic toward the end of the browning of the onions. I also added Worcester sauce and some hot sauce to the custard and increased the amount of salt. It was very well received.

Not really sure what all the bacon adders are talking about, this recipe came up on a Rosh Hashanah Search. So clearly I made it WITHOUT BACON. My husband and guests loved it, It was pretty easy to make but I needed more like 40 minutes to caramelise onions in that much butter. I lifted the onions out of the pan with a slotted spoon so as to avoid including all the extra butter. I think I could have cut the butter down by 1/2 to 3/4 stick. I also found the cooking time to be on the short side, needed an additional 10 minutes. I made the recipe as printed WITH poppy seeds, Why all the complaints about poppy seeds? I like them but I dont think a single person realised they were in there. I will make this again but I have to say it is hard for me to justify eating this unhealthfully! When my friends asked to take leftovers home I was happy to give them away lest my husband gobble up any more! Definitely a crowd pleaser, a cardiologist...not so much. :)

I've made this twice, both times in a baking dish instead of muffin cups. Used a little more sour cream and cottage cheese than called for, and no poppy seeds. It's incredibly decadent, yummy, out of this world. I had a guest last time from out of town who went crazy for it. He just arrived back in town for vacation and asked me to make it again!

I grew up eating savory kugels instead of sweet and thought this was great. Finding good quality poppy seeds was tricky, so I omitted those, and tweaked the recipe in other ways. Following other reviewers' advice I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, but I reduced the ricotta by about 1/3 a cup and substituted some grated parmesan cheese for a sharper flavor (I probably would not have done this if I had had poppy seeds available). About halfway through the cooking time for the onions, I added 3- 4 large cloves of garlic (minced) to the browning onions. To reduce the saturated fat a bit, I used a mixture of 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter (used olive oil to grease the muffin tin, too) and I used a reduced fat sour cream with no ill effects. Finally, added a lot of freshly cracked pepper.

I _love_ onions, but I really thought this recipe was overwhelming and way too rich. I felt sick after I ate it. :(

These were just OK. My family complained they were dry and flavor- lacking. And I cooked 6 slices of minced bacon and sauted the onions in the bacon fat for even more flavor. Other than that, I followed the recipe. This WAS NOT asked to be put in the rotation. A bit of work for disappointing results.

Does anyone know if the poppy seeds can be left out without effecting the taste?

This was absolutely delicious. Per the suggestions, I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, browned the onions for about 1/2 hour, added sage to the onions while cooking them and did half with the poppy seeds, half without. Was quite delicious. I also drizzled the melted butter on top before cooking, definitely was beautiful. Think I may have cooked it a bit too long, as they were definitely deep brown out of the muffin tin. Also, using Pam was a great idea; I had no problems with sticking.

My son made these for his German class. They looked great. I took the advice of another cook and sprayed the muffin tins with Pam instead of butter and they came out with ease. They needed a bit more salt than the recipe called for. Maybe the bacon suggestion is a good one to add a bit more flavor. Overall nice dish.

Excellent! I added some nutmeg and fresh chopped sage to the onions as they were cooking. I also included the bacon as one of the other people suggested in the reviews - very good. I used mini muffin tins and served as an appetizer - in the samller tins cook for about 15 minutes at the same temp.

This recipe was delicious and very attractive. I used light sour cream and 1% cottage cheese to cut down on the fat a little. As suggested by another reviewer, I will try adding cooked, crumbled bacon to the next batch.

Excellent. As suggested by one reviewer, I did add some fresh nutmeg to the mixture and drizzled melted butter on the top before putting in oven. They look prettier when piled a bit high. Also, I added well-browned crumbled bacon to half of the batch. Both versions were great, but the bacon-onion kugel won. A keeper!

I think this is a suberb and easy recipe and perfect for a luncheon or shower. I've made it several times and served it with a chicken couscous salad and a ceasar salad. I made the recipe just as it's written and even used the poppy seeds. I mixed up the onion, cottage cheese, sour cream and eggs the night before and cooked up the noodles in the morning. I combined the noodles with the cottage cheese mixture, put them in the muffin cups and baked them. I then took them out, cooled them on a cookie sheet and gently reheated them before I served the luncheon. Everyone raved and they're good reheated for dinner too (if you have any left!).

This did not taste like any kugel we've ever eaten but it was delicious and I've made it a couple of times. I lightened it up using canola oil instead of butter,low fat Balkan yoghurt instead of sour cream, added 3 tbsp. of dijon mustard,no poppy-seeds, and baked it until browned in one paper-lined pyrex dish,easy to turn out and slice.

This recipe was a great hit at my book group. I used sweet Maui onions instead of brown onions which I think added to the flavor. I would suggest reducing the number of eggs by one to make it a bit less eggy.

Made this yesterday and we were all disappointed. The onion flavor didn't really come through (I used 3 large sweet white onions, thoroughly browned yet still soft). I agree with the prior reviewer, it was missing... something. The amount of butter called for is way over the top! I cut back to 3 Tbs plus 2 Tbs oil and it was still a lot. I didn't care for the medium noodles--I'll got back to using wide. I used ramekins instead of a muffin tin and the individual servings is a nice idea. Did use poppy seeds but they didn't seem to add much; even their usual texture got lost in the overall creaminess. I've had better savory kugels.

This is a good side dish. I recommend adding a little fresh nutmeg and brushing the top with melted butter before putting it in the oven.

I like sweet kugel, but the boyfriend doesn't. These sounded like a good savory alternative and they looked nice in the magazine, so I whipped some up (according to specs, except I used chernishke instead of poppy seeds) In the end we thought they were, well, fine. Probably good as a side; as a main course, it needs a little bit more something. (a little chopped smoked salmon, a bit of celery, or maybe even just a little more salt) . Not sure I'd go to the effort another time.

In my family, we almost never had sweet kugel, except around Rosh Hashanah, when everything is cooked sweet, so this was pretty close to traditional, though dairy. (If that's not your experience, that's OK; since my family is from Galicia, it's also Kigel to me. To each his or her own.) Because I was making it for my father, who believes browned onion should start any recipe not including chocolate, I actually caremelized two sliced onions very slowly separately with a hint of brown sugar and balsamic vinegar, then added the 3 cups of chopped onion. I used poppy seed on half (my dad likes them) and skipped them on the other half (I don't). I served it with roasted salmon. I think if I add chopped carrot and celery, along with some roasted garlic puree, it'll be four forks. Certainly great for a dairy meal. Since I usually make kigel for meat meals, it was different for me. (And yes, fish is dairy, according to Jewish tradition; I don't make up the laws, it only seems like we're making them up as we go along... :-)

I found this easy to make. I did cut the recipe in half but used all 6 oz of egg noodles. I also subituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese and add a little Parm... It was nice to have indivual protions.. we did like the crispiness of the noodles. I will make it again and it is basic enough to change and modify some ingredinets like adding bacon or sauasge..

Took a really big chance making this, since my grandaughter's dietary choices leave me weeping and gnashing my teeth. However, everyone said it was definitely worth repeating. My son-in-law is a gourmet cook and he is getting a copy of the recipe (I love it when I pull something off while he is at the table!!!!) Didn't use the poppy seeds and did use a rather creamy small-curd Cabot cottage cheese. Don't skimp on the onions. Cooked it for 25 min. Six at the table--no leftovers.

A good jewish daughter knows that when you try a new recipe or dish, "it's never as good as your mother's." Aside from my daughterly duties, I thought this dish was wonderful - the onions were a delicious addition to a traditional recipe. I left out the poppy seeds as well.

Great taste! Didn't like the look of the poppy seeds. Wouldn't make this without bacon. Lithuanians make their similar potato casserole (kugelis) with lots of bacon. Considering taste only, it's a great combination; considering tradition, I guess it doesn't go. Eh?

Rating: 3
I have to say; the addition of bacon to a kugel is sort of like having a salami sandwich on white bread with Miracle Whip. It's just, well, wrong...I know, I am supposed to comment on the recipe. I loved the idea of indivdual kugels, since we always sort of try to stake out our corners when we make a large one. I also think the idea would be wonderful as potato kugels.

I haven't yet made this dish but I will. Even if it's only for the great reviews. They were so hilarious. Obviously if you can break tradition by adding pork to kugel you can bend many rules. Anyway noodles and onions are always a big fave here so can't wait to make this dish.

I made this recipe first and cut it in half, (except for the noodles which I used almost 2 cups of no name brand cheap egg noodles) sauteed up some chopped up bacon and browned the onion with the bacon. I know my recipe makes it a non- traditional "kugel" with the addition of pork, but it was really good!! And my parole officer really liked it!!!

It was great. We didn't use poppy seeds, but only because they violate the no opiate clause of our parole agreement. Just kidding. We forgot the poppy seeds. The kugels were super duper good nonetheless.

I tried this because my husband loves burnt onions (even though he can live without noodle kugel). Straight out of the oven, it was really delicious - like little onion-cheese omelettes, with some noodles thrown in. Reheated, they were less spectacular but still yummy. I left out the poppy seeds. Don't cut back on the onions - they're the whole point.

Tried this because my husband saw it in Gourmet and wanted me to break out of our "rut eating" and try something new. I did, and we were not disappointed. I would recommend cutting back by a third on the amount of onion though. Even though they were onion kugels, the onion flavor was overpowering. Added some leftover diced chicken and will add some parmesan or asiago cheese next time. The poppy seeds were an added plus for texture.

I've never heard of onions and poppy seeds in kugel. I wouldn't use them. I like the idea of the individual servings, as it will be easier to serve, and be a big help with portion control.
