Wow - I made this recipe for a coffee morning at work. Before I wiped my eyes out all the tarts were finished and I was being asked for the recipe. I made a few alterations. I used half goats cheese and half Boursin with Garlic cheese. I also used spanish onions but mixed olive oil and butter with 6 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar. This is an amazing recipe and will now form part of my party arsenal.

My husband made this for us and it was easy and tasty and is even better heated-up the next day. We used a premade piecrust because we work and commute during the week. We used basil instead of thyme, any herb will do.

This was tasty but the bottom was soggy. I guess I didn't cook it long enough the first go around. I also baked it longer than it called for overall. Its a good appetizer and I will try it again.

A huge hit! I needed onion peels to dye eggs and thought I wold try this to use up all the onions I had. Cooking the onion long enough on low heat is key. They need to turn light brown without burning. I used puff pastry to save some time and because that's what I remember my mom using. Simply delicious! Served with a big green salad and freshly baked breat.

I made this on New Year's Eve. I followed some other reviewers tips and increased the amount of onion. I used goat cheese from the grocery store and felt that the custard was too bland, so next time I may reduce the amount of sour cream and increase the cheese or find a more robust cheese to use. Overall, it was delicious and everybody loved it.

These are great. Even when I cheat and use frozen pie crusts, I get great reviews. Brought them to our firm Thanksgiving lunch and was the first thing gobbled up.

This was a total hit at dinner tonight. I served it as a main course, plus a salad on the side. 4 adults and two toddlers ate the entire tart (I used 1 11 inch round tart pan) I made several alterations: I only had 2 yellow onions, so I also used 1 whole leek. I added balsamic vinegar to the onion/leek mixture after they were soft and golden brown. For the cheese custard, I didn't have enough goat cheese, so I used half mild, plain goat cheese and half Boursin. It was fantastic. This recipe lends itself well to small changes.

I have made this many times as an appetizer, and they are always a hit. I make a few changes - I add some balsamic vinegar to the onions at the end (3-4 tablespoons, and let it cook down.) This adds a greater depth to the flavor of the onions and the balsamic makes a nice pairing wih the goat cheese. I use mini filo cups - and spoon the sauteed onions 3/4 full in each cup, and mound the goat cheese mixture on top. I make the onions and goat cheese mixture the night before, and then assemble the hors devours an hour or so before I pop them into the oven - 350 for about 20 minutes. They are always a big hit. Highly recommended.

I got rave reviews for this, all 3 times i've made it (exactly as the recipe states)...The only thing I've found is that there's a little too much of the custard and not quite enough of the crust. Other than that, it's great (and I use red or vidalia onions, not yellow onions)

I made this exactly as directed. The crust was wonderful and came together very easily in my food processor. I plan on using this tart crust in other tarts. However, I found the onion flavor was over-powered by the goat cheese custard. My husband and I both agree that next time the onions should be doubled and the custard reduced by 1/3. With those changes, we will definitely be making this again.

This is so good...I'm not one of those people who say "Oh this is too rich," I love rich food...this is really rich! My hubby and I eat the leftovers for breakfast...

Hardest part was making the crust as this was the first time I made a crust. Crust came out okay. Filling was great. Drizzled some balsamic vinegar over the top to add a little extra flavor. Everyone loved this appetizer.

This is an excellent recipe...the combination is to die for. I have made it over 20 times and it always impresses my guests.

Good, but not Knock-your-socks-off. Used non-fat sour cream and herbed goat cheese. Accidentally put the thyme in the tart as opposed to on top, but still was good and not overpowering. I piled the filling up a bit as it did fall when cooling.

This is a fantastic recipe. Great sliced in thin strips as an appetizer; I got rave reviews and will definitely make it often!

Really good and easy! I made for a party of 80 and in a casserole pan, approx 8x11, cut in squares. They hold the flavor and shape very nicely - and were a hit!

I made it for a cocktail party. It was really easy...i cheated like the other reviewer using store bought puff pastry. A real success! Didnt change anything else. Every loved it, it was all gone.

Very rich. This paled in comparison to the salmon, leek, and goat cheese tart that I made for the same party, but it was really good. Beautiful, too.

Good recipe and well received by guests... not spectacular though. A few comments: 1) I would recommend using a goat cheese with a strong flavor, not one of the really fresh/light ones. 2) Don't use a shallow tart pan... the 1" depth is necessary in order to get an adequate layer of onions before pouring the cheese custard over it.

We had this at our martini party last night and it was fabulous. Just the right balance of sweet and tart. Our friend prepared it with store bought puff pastry. There were no leftovers.

EAsy, good, but not great. I made it to serve slivers on a salad as a starter. Nobody left any behind, but it wasn't the highlight of the meal. I do recommend that you don't let it get too cold. I'd left it at room temp. for a few hours and it really would have been nicer slightly warm. Also, I think it could stand with light sour cream and a stronger goat's cheese flavour.

Very good and very popular. Made it in an 11x8 inch tart pan and then sliced. Need to slice thin since it's rich. Made it in advance and reheated as recommended.

Looks impressive. Tastes delicious. The onions (plenty carmelized and sweet) in contrast to the goat cheese is fantastic. This has become a party standard at my house, although sometimes I cheat with pre-made crust. I make a 10 inch tart and the filling is just the right amount -- right to the very top, but no spill over.

I use this recipe in my catering business. I would recommend it to anyone.

This was very good. I used an 11-inch round pan, and had LOTS of extra filling. This looked very pretty, without any fancy garnishing (my weakness), and I loved the fact that it could be prepared ahead of time. Another easy, pretty recipe from epicurious!!

I have made the recipe from the September 1997 issue of Gourmet and served it several times as pictured in the magazine. The suggestion of baking the tarts in mini pans was a great idea and worked very well for us. Thanks for all the reviews!

For my 9th grade English project I had to make some French recipes. The caramelized onions were really good. Everyone who tried it liked it, but not everyone was adventurous enough to try goat cheese.

I made this for a party, and it was a big hit! I used 2 10 inch round tart pans with removable rims, and doubled the recipe -- it worked out well. The only complaint I have is that the tarts were not as "thick" as I would have liked. The custard fell quite a bit after cooling, as expected, but it would have been nice to have a bit more of a fluffy custard layer on top of the onions.

I made this recipe as cocktail appetizers for 50 people and got rave reviews from all of them. I doubled the custard and onions and had enough filling for 120 2-inch tart shells and one long, rectangular tart. I served them at room temperature, but I find they are better slightly warm.

This tart is divine but you must be sure to caramelize the onions properly or else the sour cream comes through too much.

I increased the quanitites a little for both the crust and filling and made two 9-inch round tarts (the only tart pans I have). It was delcious! Made it for a party and people loved it.

Made these yesterday using 24-cup mini muffin pan and they were great. Had leftover onions and custard, but no dough so put the filling in buttered ramekins. They were even better. The previous reviews were a big help. Thank you.

Wonderful.Made individual mini tarts.put mixture in raw dough and baked. Make sure you spray tart form with pam. They came out perfectly. We had leftovers and heated them up the next day they were great. Definetly a make ahead dish.

Made this for a catered event. Everyone loved it. I made mini-tarts using mini-muffin tins. I didn't blind bake the shells first as indicated in the recipe. Instead, I chilled then used a cookie cutter to mold the dough into the mini-muffin tins; it came out wonderful. Also, I also added fresh thyme leaves in the goat cheese mix as well as garnished it with the thyme.

A great addition to the party food list. I was surprised at how many people went for this, including people who, if told beforehand that it was a goat cheese tart, would have turned it down.

I absolutely loved this recipe, the combination of goat cheese and onions was heavenly. However, I cooked the onions until golden and one guest commented that he would have preferred the tarts if the onions hadn't been sweet.
