Made this exactly as written. Found the end product to me far too liquidy. Although you can taste the freshness from the ingredients, the salsa is quite bland. To save this runny bean 'soup', I pureed the remainder white beans, added them to the salsa, then added 1 tsp of pureed chipotle chili. I then added 1 ripe avacado, diced. This version was a vast improvement of the original recipe.

The first time I made this recipe, I didn`t have fresh basil leaves but I did have fresh cilantro, so I transformed it into a Mexican dish with the cilantro a some fresh diced jalapenos. The second time, I made it exactly as the recipe says even though I didn`t feel like dirtying my blender for just one tomatoe. It is worth it and the basil leaves really make the salsa. Enjoy it! It is a very healthy dish.
