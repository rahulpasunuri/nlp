I added double the potatoes for a thicker soup. Use Yukon Golds.

A sweet elixir of watercress. Very refreshing. I made some changes to the recipe, which simplify it, but in a good way. A famous restaurant in France makes a watercress sauce with scallops using two ingredients: cream and watercress. The watercress is wilted in butter, cream is added and the whole thing given a whir in the blender. Back in the pan, it is then seasoned with white pepper and salt to taste. Using that as my inspiration, I eliminated the potato and substituted water for the broth. I sweated the onions in butter, wilted the watercress, added hot water and cream and then blended and strained it. The present recipe thins the soup too much. Not the lack of color in the photo. I used a cup of water only and a tablespoon or two of cream, which is needed for texture. Add a whole cup will make the dish too heavy, obscure the flavor and give you the uninspiring gray color seen in the photo.

Delightful, fresh taste, thought a little heavy with the cream. I would probably use half and half, or a blend. I also forgot the potato during my grocery shopping, so I left it out and it was fine. Served this as part of a first course with seared jumbo shrimp with a watercress gremolata--very tasty.

Very subtle, nice and refreshing on a summer's day.

Per previous comment made with a Yukon Gold potato and the texture was very light and silky. Good for hot weather, but if you want more body another potato could be added. Didn't bother to strain the solids - really didn't need it. Sprinkled some cayenne on top for a bit of contrast.

Used water instead of broth, infused 1 lemongrass stalk, slice of ginger and a leaf (tender) off my orange tree in it. Removed after boiling a floury potato, then continued as per recipe. Served it chilled, with a sprinkle of chinese five-spice powder. Not the same, but very good.

The soup, though delicious,did not have enough substance. I wonder if one potato was the reason.

Mine was a smallish bunch of watercress, and a few leaves were yellow. I added some chopped baby spinach leaves. It only slightly altered the flavour.

What kind of potato did everyone use? The small russett I used made the texture kind of mealy. Would a waxy potato be better for this??

Easy and delicious with bouillion cubes too. I served this in tall juice glasses on saucers with extra watercress leaves for garnish - impressive and yummy.

Yummy I made this twice. The second time I bought the watercress and forgot the cream so I adapted it using three cups of milk and chicken stock cubes instead. Delicious both times. Don't overcook once the watercress is in, 3 minutes absolutely maximum for the freshest taste.
