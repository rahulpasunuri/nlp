Excellent pastry dough! I used a silicone rolling pin with the colored rubber-bands to ensure that the thickness was and even 1/8 inch. The thickness was perfect! I also thank those who wrote before me about the importance of pinching the dough. None of the cookies unraveled. The dough produces a lovely cookie, with truly outstanding texture. I wish epi. had given us a filling recipe. I don't like all of the extras in the canned stuff. I made a homemade poppyseed filling from another site. It tasted good; but I couldn't get the seeds to grind down into paste. Oh well. If anyone has a good poppyseed filling, and would like to share, I'd really appreciate it.

The dough recipe reminded me of another very popular cookie the 'rugelach' I suggest you roll the dough with the filling of your choice as if it were a 'croissant' as this will prevent it from opening while baking (if you want to keep the 'danish pastry shape' of the cookies s pictures try wetting your fingers with a little water before pinching the dough hope my tips helped!

Followed the recipe as written: this is a lovely, delicate pastry with a rich, buttery flavor. Baked until the pastry was just slightly colored at the corners (~ 11 min), and the resulting texture was tender, melting and not at all dry. Took extra care to pinch the corners together very tightly (appreciate the advice of previous reviewers!), and did not have a problem with "unraveling." Agree that jam tends to melt and ooze during baking; result was not as pretty as the photo on the recipe. Also tried poppy seed filling, which stayed in place much better. Different, and less sweet than the typical filled cookie.

I'm Polish-American and even though all of my Polish family love kolacky - I'm not one of them. It's not the recipe - I just have never been fond of them. My cookies came out hard and I believe the dough was thicker than what I was supposed to roll them to be. I believe it would be better if I would roll the dough out thinner. I didn't have a problem with my cookies unraveling like the others.

I refrain from giving these cookies 4 forks. For the taste alone, they would be. However, it appears that only one other reviewer ACTUALLY made them & could tell because she had the same problem I had....several of mine opened up as well. The directions leave a lot to be desired. They would have been a lot easier to make if you would have told us to roll the dough SUPER thin....NOT 1/8"...thinner than that. I found they only opened when the dough wasn't thin enough plus, you should have suggested that we dab a little water on the corners prior to pinching as well. The teaspoon of jelly was too much....1/2 teaspoon worked much better by staying IN the cookie during baking. The good news is I did the flower motif, using a 15" round white platter, using raspberry filled in 2 layers around the edge, and apricot filled tripple layered in the center.....looked like a beautiful stained glass flower.....oh, and yes....36 cookies???? Way off...I ended up getting 72! All in all, a lot of trial by error ON MY PART.....wish your editor would have EDITED on this one! However, I will make these again! They tasted like 5 forks. BTW....I live in heavily Polish populated Buffalo, New York, and NOBODY I spoke with knew these, but had seen them before.

These are quite delicious, and easy to make. However, I had a terrible time keeping the cookies pinched together. As they were baking, they kept unfolding back to the square shape. You must REALLY pinch them together well prior to baking.

My mothers side of the family is Polish/Albanian and I remember these cookies in a cake dish on grandmas table. She would always make both these and the Kolache rolls (Walnut or Apricot filling was my personal favorite) for the holidays. Unfortunately I never got the recipe from her and I deeply regretted losing that bit or my heritage. These look EXACTLY like those cookies and I hope their every bit as good...:) Sorry Napasandy, I had Kolache sent to me in Korea in 1999. But send a reminder anyway, the guys couldn't get enough...soo much better than just cookies. It's been to Kuwait, Germany (I'm sure not the first time) and many states in the union as well with me...:)

I am first-generation Hungarian-American and what napasandy describes is what we call beigli. It is made with poppy-seed or walnut filling (from scratch - NEVER canned!) and a similar dough made with sour cream and rolled. It's an all-day affair that is my sister's domain so I'm going to try these!

My family is eastern european and this recipe is pretty similar to the one we have made for many decades. Great recipe as is. Personalize it with fillings. I go for the poppy. We also do a honey/nut filling that is quite good.

Kolache is the name my Hungarian mother used, and her recipe was very different and baked in a roll form, sort of like a cinnamon roll. The dough is a yeast dough. It is cooked and then sliced up. I have not tried this version, as NOTHING could be better than my mom's version. It is a holiday tradition in our household to make Kolache. Last year I did quit a bit of research into this eastern European dessert, and I have to say that I think this version, while easy to make, just does not compare visually, with the one my Mom passed down. This year Kolache will be introduced to South Korea, since my son is stationed there, and I will be sending it to him. lol Who knows, in the future there may be a Korean version of Kolache.
