I made this as part of a New Year's Eve meal. It was so tasty! I left out the parsley and used Leffe Blond instead of a lager. Leftovers the next day were just as delicious.

I enjoyed this recipe, but I think I will keep looking for another one to use as my go-to. Good over pasta and/or with crusty bread

we really enjoyed this, will def make again. i was in a rush so just did butter, garlic (scapes) and thyme, then used a wheat beer and the mussels, didnt do the tomatoes, celery, cream or mustard, was a big hit

This was a tasty broth if a little underwhelming. The flat-leaf parsley added an unpleasant bitter note, and I found myself picking it out. More of something would probably be a good idea. . . maybe just salt?

Dull, dull, dull. I can't believe how little flavour this has. What a waste of cooking time.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used Ommegang and it was awesome. The beer flavor isn't as strong as you might think. I've made something just like this with white wine and it was very similar.

I browned some bacon and added it to the mussels, and that was also very tasty!

this was very good, but it didn't have the amount of flavor that i expected. would probably add more garlic and some red pepper flakes. other mussel recipes are definately tastier.

I've made this 3 times now, tripled with clams as well as mussels and it's fantastic. I don't think the quality of the beer used makes much difference as the best version of this I made used Miller High Life (the Champagne of Beers after all).

Easily my new favourite mussel recipe.

Don't use a lager. Prepare it like the Belgians do and use a Belgian-style white beer such as Hoegaarden.

These were delightful! My guests truly enjoyed them as an appetizer.
