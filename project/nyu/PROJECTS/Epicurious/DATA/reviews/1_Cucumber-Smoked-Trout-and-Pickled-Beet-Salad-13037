check me if i'm wrong here, but you don't actually "cook" this dish at all..... not that i've made it, so i'm in no way endorsing it..... just pointing out that mr. marin, ca. obviously didn't make it either..... he just wanted to throw some flowery language down in a review...... i'm not sayin, i'm just sayin.....

I was looking for a smoked trout salad, but this doesn't seem very appealing. Based on the other reviews, I'll keep looking. It says it's a side dish, but a side dish to what?

The smell of this cooking made me think of Manteka Ca and the spreckels plant with the raw, rotting, fetid beets steaming with thier self generating boomer thermals wafting that pungent spuz into the oily air of Manteka California. We tossed it out and went out.
