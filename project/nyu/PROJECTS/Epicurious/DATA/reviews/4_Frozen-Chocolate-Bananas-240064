Not bad. I would have liked the chocolate to be sweeter but it is a great way to get kids to eat bananas. If I make it again I would try milk chocolate instead.

Husband says these are probably the best dessert he's ever had. Says it all, doesn't it? I made them bite sized and used toothpicks. Also, did not freeze them, just put in fridge. Dipped them in toasted coconut, pecans, and sprinkles. Back in fridge til time to eat. Once served, we dipped them in fresh whipped cream! YUM!!!

Pretty darn tasty! Loved the suggestion from a reviewer about using chop sticks rather than purchasing popsicle sticks. Kept them in the freezer but in prep for serving, moved them to the fridge for about 30-45 mins. Next time I make, I will use olive oil (per another's suggestion). I found the veg oil a tad off-putting in the chocolate.

Quite a few reviewers noted the mushiness of the frozen bananas. To get past the shocking texture, think of the texture as slightly denser ice cream and then you might not be as shocked. This is a simple, healthy alternative to ice cream or any other cold treat. Great as dessert or breakfast on the run. Popsicle sticks are not necessary, keep it cheap and simple!

I'd like to add a couple of tips to this recipe that I've learned from experience. First, it's really important to let your... bananas ripen until they are covered with *small* brown spots. That ensures that their sugar level is optimal. Next, when you freeze them, do not place them in a freezer bag. Moisture that evaporates from the bananas as they freeze will result in ice crystals on the bananas if it is trapped within a plastic bag. This ice will melt into the chocolate when you dip the bananas and cause the chocolate clump. If you do see ice crystals on the frozen bananas, brush it off prior to dipping them. In addition to being a great tasting treat, frozen bananas are also a good food source. For a good description of nutritional benefits, see: http://www.totally-bananas.net.

Delicious, and fun to make with kids. We use the chop-sticks the thai take-out won't stop sending with the food for the skewers. As one reviewer mentioned, sometimes freezing makes them mushy, try refrigerating instead. I've made them various ways - such an easy recipe, why not experiment? Olive oil brings out the chocolate flavor in a crazy-good way (but you'd never guess that's what it was) and if you have hazelnut or walnut oil on hand definitely use that. Yum! I like to dip them myself then plop them onto a plate of granola, and let my kid add chopped nuts, coconut, whatever. Great for using up bits left over from more-involved baking projects. Also fun to make them in winter, and set the whole platter of them outside on the porch under a bit of waxed paper to chill and set-up. Fantastic for breakfast! I've made them skewer- less in slices & then let them melt on a hot waffle or french toast when we have family staying over for breakfast. Fun.

I made this for a college dorm program a while ago and it was extremely successful- they were more popular than any of the baked goods, and hey, it's fruit and super cheap. They didn't have sticks, but it wasn't much of a problem, so don't let the lack of popsicle sticks discourage you (unless, of course, you don't like chocolate on your hands). A really nice recipe for leftover bananas if you're tired of banana bread or it's hot outside.

This was really easy to do. My 3 kids and I did it this afternoon, to have for when some company and their kids come over. They loved it. The kids were really into the sprinkles, and I made some with Hazelnuts for the adults. I used 60% Ghiradelli choc chips, which melted really easy, and I like these because both the Dark choc, and milk choc crowds like the taste.

I did this once before and the bananas were rock-solid, and then when they are finally soft enough to eat they are just mush. I suggest not freezing, but just refrigerating them, because in theory it's delicious but mushy banana is gross. MUCH better if you don't actually freeze them

Really good! My friend's mom just loved them and ate four. I had a very fun time making them and they were very easy. They are also healthy compared to other chocolate desserts. Taste great on a hot, summer day.

the banana were way too hard, would leave out a while before serving, most people just ate the chocolate and nuts off the banana.

use good quality chocolate with a splash of Grand Marnier or Cruzan or Baileys or.... for a great adult summer treat. "ALMOST better than s**!"

So yummy, but I only used 2 teaspoons of oil. They turned out perfectly. Using 60% cacao chocolate made them decadent.
