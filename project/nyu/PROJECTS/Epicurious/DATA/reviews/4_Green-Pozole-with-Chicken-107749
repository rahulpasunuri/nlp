This is a 'keeper'. The only alteration I made to the recipe was to use fresh hominy (made from nixtamal) rather than canned. We had a couple Latino workmen at the house and I invited them to join us for a bowl of pozole. They loved it, which confirmed my own opinion that I would make this again. Next time, however, I will double the recipe so I can freeze some for a later date.

Excellent! Easily worth the time - this has become a Christmas favorite. I will try with dried hominy rather than canned next time.

This is an exceptional recipe that we have successfully made and devoured on multiple occasions. It does take some time, but is fully worthwhile. Also have used the tomatillo sauce recipe on its own to eat separately with other dishes and works really well. This one's a keeper.

I love this recipe. Delicious and forgiving. I love serving it to friends who have never heard of hominy, much less pozole. As the weather gets cooler, I make double batches and freeze some for quick dinners. One variation: I much prefer dried hominy to the canned version. You need more lead time to soak and cook it (much like preparing dried beans) but the flavor and texture are so much better.

Delicious! Perfect hearty consistency and robust flavor. I used chicken stock instead of water to amp up the flavor even more. Even though this recipe takes some time to prepare, every step was simple, and the outcome was more than worth the effort. Great football food. This will be going in my repeat file.

I used store bought roasted/salted pumpkin seeds and it still turned out great! What a fantastic receipe.

This was a delicious dish! I made two changes -- I used a rotisserie chicken plus pre-made stock, and I broiled the tomatillos, garlic, jalapenos, and onion until lightly charred instead of boiling. The consistency was fantastic, and the flavor was great -- a little spicy, a little tangy, a little herby. I'll definitely make this again.

My new comfort food right here! Worth every bit of the time and effort. Took me just a bit under 2 hours but for the results I didn't mind.I used the full amount of chiles but have pitifully low tolerance for spicy things so I'll either use a smaller pepper or take out some of the seeds next time. Other than that, wouldn't change a thing. Definitely gonna make this again soon. Fortunately, there are some leftovers. :)

After having posole at Margarita Grille in Bartlett, NH (they have awesome cooks) I started looking for recipes. None that I found even closely resembled the soup I had there, but decided to start trying ALL of them! I made this exactly as written with the exception of using dried hominy. Had no idea how much to start with or how long to cook it, but ended up with WAYYYY too much (ended up eating it out of the bowl with butter, salt and pepper - yummy). Anyway, the end result was definitely worth the work. I will definitely make this again -- after I try some more of these recipes.

I had never tasted posole and a Mexican friend from work described how wonderful it is and recommended I use this recipe. Wow, I couldn't believe how wonderful all the ingredients came together to make this soup taste like I had ordered it in a fancy Mexican restaurant! My family raved and it is now one of my favorite soup recipes. Try it, it is worth the effort!!

As usual, reviewers here are right on target. The recipe takes much longer to make and it is absolutely worth it. The toasted pumpkin seeds provide a wonderful flavor. This is a keeper!

OK, I totally cheated but it turned out AMAZING: I did do the pepitas, but instead of making the sauce, I blended the cilantro and oregano with 2 jars of Trader Joes green salsa. After it cooked down a bit, I added the ground pepitas, 2 large cans of hominy and a shredded roast chicken, along with 6 cups of homemade chicken stock. Served with shredded cabbage, cilantro, avocado chunks, radishes and lots of limes, it was devoured and enjoyed by all! And, it only took me 25 minutes!

Fantastic! A little labour-intensive, but don't change a thing.

I'd say the overall time involved was more like 3 hours, but well worth it. The only change I made was to go ahead and puree the onions and garlic from the stock rather than discarding them. A full flavored meal.

Absolutely delicious! This turned out much better than what we can get at the local Mexican joint. It does take a lot of work to bring it all together, but worth it. In fact, next time I am going to at least double the amount as I am sure it will freeze beautifully.

So delicious! I made some substitutions, which cut down on the time involved. I used a roasted chicken and a box of broth, as well as a can of tomatillos. I did toast and grind the pumpkin seeds, though. My husband loved it, and requested it for future dinners. I would also make it for dinner guests. Definitely don't forget the lime!

Active time 1.5 hours? Pshaw. Maybe after you get some practice making it a few times but this seriously just took me 3 hours. BUT . . . it was a nice winter soup. Totally authentic Mexican flavor without the stereotypical chili powder, cumin, grated cheese. Nice heat to it, though I might even use a bit more jalapeno next time. I reserved the rest of the chicken poaching broth because my soups always end up being high on goodies, low on broth after the first servings get doled out and after the leftovers sit in the fridge over night. I probably added another 1.5 cups broth and probably could've reserved more. Glad I will have some leftovers to show for all those hours of work! Yum.

Really delicious recipe. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it, and if you make enough, it's even better the second night. Don't skip the pumpkin seeds -- it really adds a nice layer of flavor. The first time, I made this almost exactly as described, but added a tablespoon of lime juice to the tomatillo mix in the blender and another tablespoon at the end. The second time, I used some roast pork leftovers instead of chicken. I didn't have that much meat, so I doubled the hominy, and I also tossed in a poblano pepper I had lying around. Spicier, and with the pork richer -- still delicious. Will be making this again and again.

Rating: 4
This is an amazing dish -- no substitutions are needed because it is perfectly seasoned as written. The lettuce is essential and authentic -- as are all of the garnishes. Fun for a party.

This had wonderfully complex flavors for posole. The pumpkin seeds, tomatillos and jalapenos really come through. I used canned tomatillos and twice as much pumpkin seeds as called for. And I let it cook down for quite a while. Best posole ever!

One of my favorite recipes...this stew is terrific! I couldn't get the green pumpkin seeds to puff, but it still tasted great. It also freezes well, just add a little water or broth if it gets to thick after it comes out of the freezer.

Rating: 4
Outrageously good dish! But rather than adding broth, I make it. I typically use a whole chicken, cut up for the posole. When the meat is cooked and torn from the bones and skin, I return that skin and bones to the pot and cook some more, before straining. That gives me broth for the posole and some left over that I freeze for another use. Also, I never seem to find hominy, so I use chickpeas instead. It's superb!

Rating: 4
This was amazing!I thought it was going to be too "ethnic" for my husband, but he loved it! The only changes I made was to add two chicken boullions and cumin to the broth. All garnishes a must. Substitute cabbage for lettuce, used red onions, and Sour Cream adds a nice velvety touch!

Rating: 4
I usually don't care for the technique of boiling a raw onion without sweating it a little in some oil first, but this was really outstanding. I used chicken breasts, but added a spoonful of organic Better Than Bouillon to the water to make up some of the flavor that the thighs would have supplied and it was perfect. I also blended the pumpkin seeds along with the tomatillo-onion mixture because I didn't want to clean the coffee out of my grinder. Definitely use both jalapenos. I used only one and wished for a little more spice. I served it with lots of crisp chopped romaine, avocado, and lime juice. Next time, I'll definitely try the radishes as well.

Rating: 4
Just wonderful. Have made for company a few times, which is a big hit because of the build-your-own aspect with all the garnishes - which are essential. Do cabbage instead of lettuce. Others are right that as is, it's a bit low on hominy and liquid. Make the math easier and just reduce the amount of chicken. I also used chicken broth and thus no salt till near the end (but just water for boiling vegs). Really really great. NOT a weeknight meal - leave yourself plenty of time.

Rating: 4
Delicious. Amazing flavors! It was a challenge to find hominy where we live, but it was worth it! It says "pozole" on the hominy can, so I'm guessing it's not used for much else. We found it at a Latin market called Best Way.

This is a wonderful soup. I did not use the pumpkin seeds. The second time I made it, speed was in order and I used canned tomatillos (similar to crushed tomatoes) that can be found in the hispanic section of most grocery stores. And I just tore up a store bought cooked chicken. Still wonderful, one of my favorite soups and I always get rave reviews with I share it.

Rating: 4
My boyfriend and I LOVED this. The only changes I made were to add 1 poblano and 1 anaheim pepper, subtracting one of the jalapenos. It was really spicy the first day, but completely lost its heat by the 2nd day. The flavor otherwise on the second day was freakishly amazing. After adding up the calories, it surprisingly came to less than 400 calories per serving. I had been worried about it once I saw all that chicken thigh fat floating about in the broth.

Delicious! things i did to improve: 1. braised chicken with ancho chile powder before boiling it. 2. roasted tomatillos on grill/open gas flame before sauteeing/simmering with onion and garlic 3. used cumin as additional spice for simmered tomatillos; didn't add water to this -- enough juice in the tomatillos...but added canned tomatillo salsa to supplement Yummy!!!

Sometimes I see recipes that have many positive reviews and the outcome doesn't quite measure up - but make no mistake, this is an excellent recipe. It's better the 2nd day, but you'll rarely get to that point since everyone will eat it the first time! Beautiful presentation if you have garnishes like diced avos, chili flakes, limes, radishes, chopped onion, shredded cabbage.

Fabulous soup! Used chicken stock, no jalapenos (needed to be kid friendly), and didn't have pumpkin seeds. It was absolutely wonderful and everyone in the family loved it. I thought there was going to be tons of leftovers, but they ate almost all of it!

I love this recipe. I've made it twice in a month. The first time it was waaay too hot. I love spicy food but it was out of control. Second time made it with just one jalapeno and it was still hot but just the "very spicy", very flavorful version.--- Absolutely delicious!--- Made it exactly as the recipe suggests. Next time will use the chicken broth instead of water...forgot about that. BTW-freezes beautifully.

This recipie produced a marvelous pozole to rival any of the best I've had in the Southwest! The green pumpkin seeds may also be found at stores carrying south american ingredients. Also, I doubled the recipie and used an anaheim and hatch pepper in addition to the jalapenos. Lovely!

Ok, I cheated! I used bottled salsa verde which was made of tomatillos, cilantro and green chilis. I'm sure that the a\ammounts were not exact, but, for convenience, I was ok with that. The family loves this dish and I will make it again. I used all the accompaniments listed, and I recomend that you do. Very yummy.

I am a soup & stew aficionado and I love this recipe! I followed the suggestion to use chicken broth instead of water (sticking with H2o would likely have taken a fork off my rating). I also garnished with sour cream, which was a great addition.

This recipe is GREAT!!! Everyone loves it including my Mexican boyfriend and his food critic mother. She even asked me for some tips! Like some of the other reviews I doubled the hominy and I used chicken broth instead of water. Also for the garnish I use shreded cabbage instead of lettuce. It's alot of work but well worth it.

I thought this was an outstanding recipe. A little work though. As some other reviewers noted, I thought the chicken to broth ratio a bit low, and I wasn't about to waste the broth that the chicken was poached in (yes, I used half stock, half water). So I doubled the hominy and used all the liquid. Next time I will double the tomatillos, cilantro, peppers, pumpkins seeds, etc. to keep the flavors concentrated. The garnishes are a nice treat.

I've made this twice and both times it got gobbled up very quickly. It's a hearty crowd-pleaser. I vacuum-sealed it and brought it camping, and it was perfect after a long day of hiking.

This posole recipe is AMAZING! Flavors blend perfectly. I have made numerous soup/stew recipes on this website and this by far is my favorite. Did make with other recommendations of chicken stock instead of water and extra 1/4# tomatillos and 1/4 c cilantro. Do seek out the natural pumpkin seeds - it gives it an earthy flavor and if you want a lighter recipe, chicken breast works great (2 - 2 1/2 # is definitely plenty) and reduce oil to 1 TB (for its purpose, it's fine).

I made this with pork loin and my own homemade pork stock and it was wonderful. Very full in flavor. It was nice to have another recipe to help me use up the tomatillos I have growing like a jungle in my vegetable patch.

I used Quorn "naked" vegetarian chicken cutlets and vegetable broth, but this soup was great. Next time, though, I'll try to cut down the salt -- between the canned hominy, the vegetable boullion cube (watered down, even!) and the salt called for in the recipe, it was almost too salty. Other than that, it was great. Tangy and hearty. My BF and I had 2 bowls each and we wished there was more left over!

One of my all-time favorite recipes. I use chicken broth to cook the thighs, and like to use a package of large hominy kernels (soak and cook before using) instead of canned hominy - the big kernels have more flavor and texture.

This recipe fast became a family favorite. It is filling without being heavy. The flavors are bright and fresh, which makes it especially tasty in the winter. The toppings are fun (and essential!), making this a great dish for a casual get-together. Goes great with the "warm tortilla chips and spicy cheese dip" recipe also on this site. One problem, I couldn't find canned hominy, so I substituted about 1/4 cup instant grits. Works fine.

One of our new favorite soups. We'd never had green pozole before, but have tried many versions around Austin and found this to be the tastiest yet. We wanted a large batch for extra leftovers, so we used 12 cups broth (in place of water). We wound up wasting about a cup of the broth, so next time will go with 10 or 11 and use water for cooking the tomatillo/onion mixture. Substitutions: Canned chicken broth for water, 3 lb. chicken breast instead of thighs. Additions: 1/2 onion, 1 extra clove garlic, 1/4 extra pepitos (pumpkin seeds), 1/4 extra lb. tomatillos, 1 more jalapeno, 1/4 cup extra cilantro, 30 oz. add'l hominy. In addition to the avocado in lime juice (very tasty), we recommend making a small batch of pico de gallo (tomatoes, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, lime juice, splash of red wine vinegar, shake of habanero hot sauce) and serving it as an accompaniment (spoon these into the soup). With the pico and lime-avocado, you may not want extra lime juice, so taste first. Even in our very Tex-Mex grocery store, we could not find raw pepitos. We had to stop by our local health-food store which had them in the bulk section, but it was worth the extra stop. Lastly, we found the amount of chicken to be satisfactory with the extra broth, but agree that this recipe would be too meaty w/o adding broth. Even with our large batch, we could've reduced the chicken by 1/2 pound easily.

Delicious! After having green pozole in Zihuatanejo, my husband came home and found this recipe. And it was also excellent! This pozole was a little thicker than the kind we had in Mexico ... next time I'll add extra broth. The flavor ROCKED though!

Rating: 4
I've looked for a recipe for green pozole for a long time after having it in Mexico and this is perfect. However, I used Swanson's chicken broth instead of water as I like a little more robust soup. Next time I will poach boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the thighs as I think I would like the flavor more. This time I used bone in thighs and they took forever to get done if you are poaching them.

Rating: 4
I had my brother over for dinner and he ate HALF of the pozole himself! The green pumkin seeds, or pepitas, are an important ingredient. Most supermarkets these days have a Mexican/Latin spice section, you'll find them there. Otherwise, go to a local tienda (Mexican grocer), if there's one in your area. I used bone-in thighs for a more robust broth, added epazote *and* oregano, and like everyone else, more hominy. The accompaniments are crucial - don't skimp on them!

Made this for a large-group casual party. Followed prior suggestions to add more hominy. Also followed more traditional preparation and added 2 split pig's feet to the water, as well as using bone-in cuts of chicken (remove, debone, shred with fingers). Requires more skimming and one pass through a lined chinois but a very silky broth. Guests loved it.

Great recipe. My wife grew up in Mexico and New Mexico and she says I get it close (apparently a broth w/ pigs feet would be closer, oh well). Like everyone else I double the hominy. I also use thighs w/ the bone in for a fuller broth. Finally, I don't like straining the chile/tomatillo sauce - I like it to be a little less refined.

This was a fantastic pozole! Being a vegetarian, I easily left out the chicken and made 4 cups of simple veggie stock instead. I also added more hominy, which everyone seems to do anyway.

I loved this recipe! My fiance and I just got back from Zihuatanejo, Mexico (the origin of Pozole) and this recipe nails the flavor of the pozole we had down there. I wouldn't change much - maybe a little less chicken and add diced jalapeno peppers in the group of condiments.

This was just wonderful! Like others, I didn't use as much chicken. I'll add another can of hominy next time. I'm not sure what made this dish so great - maybe the pumpkin seed mixture. There's a pork and hominy stew from this site that I make often. This now replaces that as a favorite. Much less fat, even better taste.

Rating: 0
Very evocative of the green pozole I've had in Mexico, where fried pork rinds are also served as an add on condiment. Will try that with it next time. Will also cut the amount of chicken in half (although will use equivalent amount of wings/necks/backs for the broth) and increase amount of hominy.

Rating: 3
This is delicious, excellent flavor. I halved the recipe and used boneless chicken breasts and poached them in homemade chicken broth instead of the water. That produced a rich flavor. My jalapena wasn't hot and we had to add hot sauce, but that was the jalapena not the fault of the recipe. Next time, I might use less chicken and twice as much hominy, just because of personal preference. I didn't think the pumpkin seeds ever really changed and were beginning to turn brown so I stopped roasting them. I wasn't sure what to expect, and don't know if I wasn't doing it correctly or if the puffing is so slight I didn't notice it.

Excellent flavor. Made it exactly as the recipe called for. Everyone loved it.

This was delicious. Plus it was fairly simple to make. The pumpkin seeds and hominy are crucial, so don't try to make it without them. I used drumsticks and thighs on the bone for a richer stock (boneless breasts would be very bland, I think). Then I shredded the meat from the bones and had the skin and bones left over for another stock. Lime and avocado are great garnishes.

Very tasty dish. Good for the winter. Not too spicy. Even my kids liked it. I made it with chicken breasts instead of thighs, so only cook the chicken for the first 20 min and then add to the soup when serving. I found the green pumpkin seeds at the local health food supermarket.
