Made just the chutney to serve with another grilled pork recipe. The chutney was easy to make and perfect with the pork. I used 1/2 rhubarb 1/2 apple and raisins instead of currants.

Made this exactly as written - with the minor exception of a slightly longer cooking time for the chutney - and it was outstanding. The chutney was so good I ended up trying to use it as a sauce for the other meal components as well. I can vouch that it tastes great with grilled potatoes.

I made this as part of the Mother's Day menu several years ago and it has been a house favorite ever since. I follow the recipe as is, but sometimes I do cook the chutney a bit longer to break down the rhubarb into smaller pieces.

I made this recipe and it was a total disaster!! The sauce tasted both too sweet and too vinegery at the same time...terrible!! Luckily, I was able to fix it by adding a lot of lemon, mustard,and cream. I had to throw away a large amount of the original sauce. It turned out pretty well BUT I would NEVERRRRR make this again and I would advise all of you to do the same!!!!! DO NOT MAKE THIS!!!

This chutney is amazing. I always make extra so that we can have it on hand because it is great with so many things. The tenderloin is always very tender and sliced, served cold with a salad and the chutney makes a wonderful presentation. My family can't wait for the rhubarb to come into season so we can make this recipe.

Wow, this chutney is a winner. I used apricots and dried cherries, but its the whole combination that really makes it special. It would be great on chicken, too!

The pork tenderloin turned out tender and juicy. I didn't have any rhubarb, so I substituted chopped dried apricots. I also substituted raisins for the currents. The chutney was delicious. I will try it with rhubarb when it is in season.

Yum! I made this with some nice thick boneless pork chops that I grilled on the BBQ. I love anything that makes a pork chop more than just a pork chop, and this was perfect.

Terrific! I did brine the tenderloin as one reviewer suggested. Substituted peaches and apricots for the rhubard and dried cherries for the currants. Outstanding. Will make again. Elegant!

I have made this twice and love it. The second time I made double the quantity but it ended up a lot runnier so in future I wouldn't double the wet ingredients

My family LOVES this chutney, and it's so easy to make. We've done two substitutions. The first time we used Rhubarb and dried cherries, the second time we used fresh cherries and dried cranberries (craisens sold in the packages), i think you could use almost anything, it's wonderful!

This is so good! I use dried cherries instead of currants, it takes just a few minutes to make the delicious chutney. It doesn't get very thick, as other reviewers note, but it doesn't matter. I follow Cook's suggestion to brine the tenderloin for an hour (1/3 cup sugar, 1-1/2 tablespoons salt in 1 quart water) and it makes the pork stay juicy (cook to just 145). A really great recipe.

Rhubarb is not exactly indiginous to Alabama, but we found some frozen rhubarb at our local Publix. This is a really easy recipe that tastes great.

Made this as part of the Mother's Day menu and it turned out wonderfully. I only used 1 1/4 pound pork tenderloin, so I have leftover chutney, which is great. Followed the advice of other cooks and added a little cornstarch/water at the last minute to thicken it some. Very tasty. Pork was tender and juicy. Perfect for 4 people. Mom loved the recipe so much she took my copy. Will definitely make this again. Easy, elegant and tasty - perfect! (Only 3 forks because something has to knock my socks off to get 4, but this was really very good.)

Reviewing the chutney only: This was great on Salmon. Grilled with seasoned pepper, then the room temp chutney alongside. All the individual ingredients combined to make the most amazing flavor! It was indeed sweet and you could cut down the sugar, but then it wouldn't thicken itself when cooled to room temp. I simmered mine longer in the last step because my cut-from-the-garden-this-minute (mmmmmmmmmmm!) rhubarb wasn't done the way I like. Next time, less sugar and a bit of arrowroot powder. Maybe.

Super spring dish. I substituted golden raisins and it was quite tasty - also added a little cornstarch to thicken the chutney.

This was very good, but a little sweet for my taste. I will reduce the amount of sugar next time. I used rhubarb compote instead of fresh (which probably accounts for the sweetness) and added an apple to increase volume. Also used rice vinegar. Really lovely flavors. I recommend adding ginger to the pork marinade for extra kick.

This is fantastic. I made two modifications: I marinated the tenderloin in a red wine/apple cider vinegar/garlic/ginger combo for about an hour to flavor it, and I added a cornstarch/water mix to the chutney to thicken it up. Highly recommended...will make again and again.

This rhubarb currant chutney has become a staple in my cooking repertoire. I added ginger to the pork marinade to give the tenderloin an added kick.

I really loved this recipe. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used white wine vinegar instead and I used raisins instead of currants. It was so simple and delicious.

Loved this. Made the pork in the oven, but I'll bet it's even better grilled. The chutney was wonderful. Will make again and again.

Loved this! I didn't realize how easy it was to make chutney. I used apple and rhubarb so I had to cook it a little longer to get my apple to soften, but you could basically use any fruit you want for this. This recipe doesn't make much though - and you're going to want more! I cut it in half for 2 people - and it wasn't enough. So don't be afraid to double the recipe. Just eat the leftovers on vanilla ice cream! mmmmmmm

Chutney: I followed the recipe with the substitution of orange zest for the lemon zest. Strong tangy flavor but didn't like the runny "sauce". I drained the warm "sauce" into a pan and added approximately 1/2 cup cranberries, approx 1/8 cup brown sugar, 1/4 tsp of ground cardamom. This made a whole cranberry relish. Then I mixed the rhubarb mix with the cranberry mix. This is tasty, thick and a stronger color. This gave me exactly 2 cups of chutney. Very good.

Wow. What a fabulous combination with the pork. I didn't add the currants to the chutney, and I also marinated the pork first in soy, ginger & s&p. Will definately create this gourmet meal again.-

This chutney is fabulous! I pulled this together for a quick weeknight meal. Upon finding out at the last minute that both my husband and kids would be out for dinner, I found my self eating this gourmet marvel alone. Wonderful! Next time I would marinate the pork to make it a bit more flavorful, but the chutney made the dish. Try this! By the way, rhubarb is not yet in season so I used frozen with great results (just had to cook a bit longer).

So good! I used it with pork chops to make the dish in under an hour.

WOW! What great flavor! The chutney was VERY easy to make and went splendidly with the grilled pork. I look forward to trying it with grilled cicken or fish. I'm not sure, however, that these flavors exemplified the best "summer" recipe I've ever tried, but certainly with the brown sugar and currants, it will make a FABULOUS fall and winter recipe! I will definitely make it again!
