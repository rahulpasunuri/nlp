Omg, the roasted grapes are super delicious, and I thought far better than the often too-sweet fruit based sauces that frequently accompany duck. I made this without the kale portion, lavender blossoms, or bay leaf, but all of that sounds good, too. You don't need to finish the duck in the oven, which easily leads to overdoing it. Just flip the duck over after rendering most of the fat, and with the duck on the stove in its final cooking minutes, you can more easily poke at it with a utensil to see how firm it is getting, avoiding overdoneness. Then follow the instructions for the grapes while the duck rests, but to avoid over-resting the duck, you might want to take the grapes out after 10 mins, not 15.

While the flavor of this dish is fantastic, the problem is the cooking method - the duck just didn't come out very tender. And I used very high quality Muscovy duck breasts. I think they need to cook at a lower temperature for longer or something...the meat was very chewy. I couldn't find Cavalo Nero, so used regular kale, which was very good.

Great technique for duck breast. Easy and delivers a ton of flavor. I kept mine in the same sautee pan that I seared instead of transferring to baking sheet. Just threw whole pan in oven with great results.

Amazing flavor- a spice combo that makes the duck not sweet but nearing that. The kale and grapes round out the duck and made a perfect Sunday supper with friends...easy to prepare. It was oohed and ahhed in thank you emails the next day. Just follow the forks.... sadly no leftovers.
