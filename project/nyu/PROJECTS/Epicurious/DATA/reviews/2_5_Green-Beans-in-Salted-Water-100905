I spruced the recipe up a little and used mineral water that was eco friendly. I also dehydrated 18 gallons of Charleston sea water to get the salt. Overall, we liked the green beans (and we now have a distillery in our living room)...

darn, without a photo I just couldn't figure out the presentation on this one... What do you think Should I serve the beans with the water on the side as a dippping sauce?

Just like mother used to make, totally uninspired. Gourmet should be ashamed to charge for recipes like this!

OH MY GOSH! This recipe is so close to the FAMOUS boiled salt water recipe that I expect to see it on the "most popular" reviews any time!

The water added lovely flavor and the addition of green beans to the salt is fantastic. This one is a keeper, especially when water is in season.

The green beans were a hit at a recent dinner party. I will be making them again for Easter.

I used fresh green beans just picked from the garden. My family likes sauteed onions, so I fixed this dish with one half of a 1015 onion browned in a teaspoon of bacon drippings. I then added the cooked beans to saucepan with the onions and a tablespoon of butter. Everyone loved it.
