This was an excellent way of serving eggplant. I made this for a wine party, everyone loved it. I'll make again. I used a store bought pesto sauce which was easy and tasty.

I did like this recipe though I made some modifications to it. I made it in the form of eggplant "stacks" by layering the eggplant slices with rounds of mozzarella (use a cutter) and the tomato and pesto sauces. I top with a round of cheese and bake in the oven. Very good.

I'm disappointed with result using 9" x 13" pan - gratin watery on bottom, oily on top, and lacking salt. Ideas for next attempt: (1) Slice eggplant crosswise into 1/4 to 1/2 inch slices; much easier. (2) As per The Silver Palate Cookbook's approach to eggplant parmigiana, heavily salt eggplant slices; allow to drain in colander for 30 minutes. Rinse slices well and pat dry with paper towels. Heat 2 Tablespoons oil (not 1/4 cup!) in skillet and add one batch of eggplant slices. Turn slices quickly to coat both sides and saute until light brown on both sides. Add 2 more Tablespoons oil and fry another batch, etc. Drain on paper towels. (3) Add small amount of salt to cooked tomato mixture. (4) Buffalo milk mozzarella hard to find and expensive; try regular, fresh mozzarella. (4) Parmesan cheese and pesto burned under broiler. Omit this step or increase distance from burner. Good luck!

This is like a vegetarian lasagna. I made it several times and while I was happy with the original recipe,I preferred it made with my modifications. I brushed the eggplant with garlic-infused olive oil and baked the slices in a 375 oven (instead of frying) until cooked and fairly dry. I cut back on the mozzarella and made up the difference with bechamel. I think the addition of a bechamel layer made the final result more "juicy". I found the carrot to be extraneous, except perhaps to add a little sweetness. I drizzled some of my best extra-virgin olive oil on top of each serving as I plated. I also tried with canned diced plum tomatoes and was satisfied with the result. I also tried it with green and yellow zucchini - good also. I tried building up the layers to make it more like a lasagna and preferred it that way. Add some sauteed Italian sausage to the tomato sauce and you have a meal.

I guess the recipes been fixed since last review? I made it as per the instructions and had no problem... my main gripe would be it was a bit too cheesy, I'll cut down on the mozzerella next time.

totally lacking in directions: including whether to brown the eggplant, or if the mozzarella called for is fresh and what temperature to bake and for how long.

Where is the rest of this recipe?? Anyone made this? I guess you layer it and bake it. 350? untill bubbly and browned? Pesto under the cheese?

I would really like to try this reciple, but there are no directions, so I didn't make it - I don't even think all the ingredients are listed!

I was intrigued by the title ingredients ... but confused regarding the recipe. Was there a "glitch" and the recipe incomplete? It sound like it *could* be good, but I need more instruction.

I see ingredients to make a yummy sounding dish, but NO instructions! Please add instructions, no matter how simple!

Where are the directions? I'm a first time member and just found some very interesting recipes, but this one -- which sounds wonderful -- really had no instructions. I feel I can do it, but there are those that might not have the expertise or just plain chutzpah to tackle it. I will definitely continue to search for and try out recipes and most probably will review and comment on them. Thanks for the opportunity.

I'm addicted to this eggplant recipe. Have made it twice since being served it at a friend's birthday luncheon. The flavours are just great.
