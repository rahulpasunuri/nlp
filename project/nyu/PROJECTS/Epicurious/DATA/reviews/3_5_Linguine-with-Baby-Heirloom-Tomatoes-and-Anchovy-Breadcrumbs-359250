Disappointing. Followed as written, including the anchovy - which I have never used before. Also added shrimp that others recommended, which saved this recipe sort of. Unimpressed with breadcrumbs given other reviews; weren't very flavorful and when mixed in got mushy. Maybe I didn't cook them long enough? Would only add at end.

easy. delicious. consider rinsing pasta, - especially if made with fresh pasta - it can become gluey! don't cook pasta too far ahead. provide olive oil when serving, and, save more pasta water for the those second helpings. . great breadcrumbs!

EXCELLENT! I've made this recipe several times and it has come out great every time. I made my own breadcrumbs by baking slices of sourdough until they were dry and crumbly. It adds great texture to the dish. I will try the addition of shrimp (and scallops?!) recommended by others the next time I make it!

This is an awesome recipe. Everything works so well together. If I want some extra protein, I sautee shrimp with the tomatoes.

This was delicious! Light and summery and very easy to make. We took the advice of other reviewers and sauteed the garlic and anchovy for a bit before adding the breadcrumbs. Also held off on adding all the parmesan, only added half and drizzled the remainder on afterward. Easy, light and tasty without being overpowered by the anchovy. Definitely a new staple.

Delicious, wonderful flavor! I made this as a side dish, but will do what another user did and add shrimp next time to make it an entree. The only thing I would change - instead of tossing parmesan with pasta, I would sprinkle it on top of the bread crumbs and serve. Tossing it made it melt and all the basil stuck to it - forming a few big clumps of basil, instead of it being evenly distributed throughout the dish. Otherwise, very tasty and elegant.

This might be one of the easiest and best recipes I've gotten out of a Bon Appetit ever. I fed this to guests last night, and they had to write the recipe down they were so impressed! I added shrimp to the tomatoes and garlic to sautee just to have some protein, and it was delicious. Even when the shrimp were gone, the pasta was still heavenly. I'll definitely make this over and over again.

Turned out even better than I expected! I followed the recipe exactly as written and found that it didn't need any modifications. A great way to use cherry tomatoes, basil, and garlic from my garden!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make and very delicious. I made it with my boyfriend and he liked it so much that he wants me to make it for his birthday. The only thing is that I forgot to buy basil so I skippd that ingredient. I'm pretty sure that the basil would have added the kick that was missing.

Good but not great, we have similar but better recipes from other issues of Bon Appetit. The anchovy breadcrumbs do stand out and are delicious.

Served this to company. Everybody loved it. I followed the recipe exactly. Easy. Abundantly flavorful. Anchovy paste is a really nice touch and I am generally not fond of them. Will definitely make again.

I added a lot of garlic and since I didn't have basil, I used a lot of dried basil and it turned really good. I think I'll try it next time and add some green pesto and maybe some mushrooms as well!

Maybe I shouldn't have given this four forks because I didn't use the anchovies and added some sauteed shrimp. But otherwise followed the recipe exactly and thought it was delish. The breadcrumbs gave this simple meal some nice texture and complexity. Easy to make, tastes/look fancier than it is and delicious!

This was my first attempt and it turned out fine. I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies (1/2 tsp for every anchovy) and cherry tomatoes. Make sure you allow the anchovies to cook down a bit before adding the bread crumbs; otherwise you end up with large clumps of anchovy in your crumbs. Make sure to stir the bread crumbs constantly. I walked away for a minute and they nearly burned! For the tomatoes, do not add the garlic with the tomatoes! Wait until the tomatoes have cooked down before adding them. Even though I had the burner on medium-low, the garlic still burned a bit. Overall, not a bad recipe.

Sorry to be a naysayer, and maybe I did this wrong. I love anchovies, garlic, tomatoes, and basil, especially in combination. But the 1/2 breadcrumbs became a yucky mush when mixed with the foregoing, 1/2 c. reserved cooking liquid, and 1/2 c. parmesan cheese. Even adding the 1/2 unmushy breadcrumbs to the top at the end couldn't redeem this.

Loved the addition of the breadcrumbs!

Was excellent, but made the following additions: After cooking breadcrumbs, add more olive oil to pan and sear 1 pound of scallops, set aside and cover scallops. Continue on to cooking tomatoes, using the liquid and crushed tomatoes to deglaze pan. Add the scallops back to the pan with basil, cheese, and breadcrumbs.
