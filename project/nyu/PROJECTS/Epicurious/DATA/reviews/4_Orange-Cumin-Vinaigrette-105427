This vinaigrette was very well received at Christmas dinner. Served w/salad of mixed greens, goat cheese, pistachios, dried cranberries and thinly sliced red onions. A few modifications: - Lemon juice instead of lime. I thought lemon would go better w/this particular salad , but I bet lime would be good, too. - Olive oil instead of vegetable oil - 1/2 tsp of cumin powder instead of the seeds - added a little bit of orange zest from the orange I juiced. Maybe about 1/4 tsp.

This recipe works wonderfully as is; it also works with olive oil and/or without garlic.

This dressing is an awesome accompaniment to a salad of mixed greens, shrimp, avocado and hard boiled eggs.

This dressing came out blah for me - I thought it lacked the zing of a good vinaigrette. I did use valencia oranges from my yard, though, which tend to be sweeter rather than on the tart side. Based on the previous reviews, I'll try it again with different oranges. I served the dressing with a baby spinach/mixed green salad with dried cranberries, toasted almonds and goat cheese.

This was delicious. I didn't have lemons, so used lime juice. I think I would like it better with lemon juice. I also added 2 tablespoons mango preserves.

My modified version was excellent, receiving rave reviews from my diners. Like the previous reviewer, I used cumin powder, rather than seeds, and I added dijon mustard for additional flavor. Also: I used about 1/2 the oil and substituted walnut oil for vegetable oil (produced a lighter dressing and was very tasty). Finally, I used lemon, instead of limes (didn't have any limes on hand), and I increased the amount of juice to add more tang. All in all, the recipe survived my modifications and was appreciated by all. This is an easy (and obviously) versatile recipe. It will now be a staple in my kitchen.

Excellent! I also did not have cumin seed on hand,so I used ground cumin. The only change was to add about 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard for a little zip. I used the dressing on a salad of endive, parsley, spinach with oranges and dried cranberries.

This is a delicious light dressing. I served it over Boston Lettuce topped with dried cranberries, mandarin oranges and thinly sliced red onion. Beautiful and delicious. Plan to try it on a spinach salad with fruit.
