Used whole 1.5 cups of whole-grain flour , less sugar (only 0.5 cups), added 3 tbsp olive oil and threw in an extra cup of zucchini. Omitted walnuts. While you can see the veggie, you can't taste it. This is perfect with tea or coffee and it's so very moist. Only change next time would to add cinnamon sugar with a dash of lemon zest as a light topping for each muffin.

I have been making these muffins for the past three years and every time they come out perfect and oh so yummy! The best part of this recipe is that you can vary it however you like and still have it be a success- one time I added grated carrot, another time chopped apples, and recently added chocolate chips for a sweeter version. This is one of my fav on-the-go breakfast grabs!

Can you still rate the recipe when you change everything? It was delicious. I used: 1 cup regular flour + 1 cup wheat bran flour; olive oil instead of butter; 2 cups zucchini + 1 cup grated carrot; 3/4 cup Brown sugar, not white; added 1 tsp 7 spice powder; walnuts instead of pecans; a little more baking powder Very moist and with a great consistency.

I subbed cranberries for raisins, pecans for walnuts and left out the cloves. Not fantastic or unusual. Just a good, solid zucchini bread.

This is a very good - not great - moist muffin. I agree with most of the suggested substitutions. Mine include: using 1/3 cup oil instead of butter. If miller's bran or wheat germ not available, try 2 cups of Natures' Plus Flax Bran cereal. I will try adding molasses because I find it is not sweet enough. I used brown sugar and added 2 T of Truvia (natural sweetner). My new favorite ingredient for muffins is Chia seeds. Great added crunch and rich in omega-three fatty acids. Try 2 tablespoons plus sprinkle on top. Instead of cinnamon/clove, try 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon of ground ginger. Raisins, cranberries, blueberries a must. Added fruit complements the bran and zucchini well.

I make these muffins about every two weeks except I use shredded carrots instead of zucchini (and a little less sugar). They are great for breakfast and my children love them too!

Made these to serve with soup and salad. Followed the recipe with the suggestions from previous reviews, halved the butter and added 1 small banana. Used brown sugar instead of white. Then made a mistake and added 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2, once mixed there was nothing I could do. Added cranberry and pistachios (all that I had available) and baked as per recipe. The end result was perfect, they are nice and moist without being soggy. Next time I will double the amount and freeze some. My lunch guest went home with half of the muffins and the recipe.

These taste bad. I know others have said they need more sugar, molasses, whatever. They have great texture, look pretty and all that. Onward.

Rating: 2
Much too salty, and even then, I found them rather plain. Not a bad recipe, but definitely benefited from the addition of some molasses. I think I'll stick with my Joy of Cooking bran muffin.

Great muffin recipe! I always like muffins right out of the oven, but I think they're too dry and heavy by the second day. However, these have a nice texture and are stay quite moist for a few days. (I did reduce the salt to 1/2t, and I might try a bit less sugar next time.) I'm planning on trying the basic recipe with banana or pumpkin soon!

Rating: 3
I agree with a few reviewers, these are good muffins, but not exceptional. I added 2 Tbs. molasses to give it a little more flavor, but still didn't achieve the bran muffins I was hoping for. This recipe yields moist muffins, but not big bakery style muffins that you may be looking for. I'll keep looking...

Wonderful muffins. Subbed 1/3 cup veg. oil for butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar for white sugar. Used all whole wheat flower and a full cup of bran. Was generous with the zucchini. They are delicious and healthy. Will definitely make them again.

Love these muffins. As suggested by the other reviews, I substituted applesauce for the butter. I also substituted maple syrup for the sugar (3/4 cup maple syrup = 1 cup sugar). My almost 2-year old loved the result.

Rating: 3
These are great! I made them for my 13 month old daughter and we both love them. I did make a few changes, only used half the sugar and added about 1/3 cup of pureed prunes and dried apricots, the zest of an orange and some shredded carrots. I will make these again for sure.

LIke other reviewers, I made this recipe healthier. I swapped one banana for the egg; used vegetable oil instead of butter; cut the sugar in half; and used pecans instead of walnuts. I also used oats instead of bran because that's what I had. The muffins are delicious, very moist, flavorful and hearty.

Great muffins! They tasted so rich and delicious. Feels like a splurge. Next time I will try to make it healthier, replacing the butter with applesauce.

I was kind of skeptical when these came out of the oven. Mine looked like scooped out balls of tuna salad but they are delicious! I'm a sugar fiend and tried this in an attempt to get healthy. I substituted half the butter with banana as suggested and half the amount of sugar. Yum!

Rating: 3
Great! I also used apple sauce and 1/2 the butter. I added millet, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds and a bit more spice. Moist and tasty. Thanks

Rating: 3
Like others suggested I substituted banana for part of the butter. I also added flax seeds because my husband can't eat nuts and I wanted a little something extra in the texture. The flax seeds were a good choice and I loved these muffins. They are great for someone who doesn't want muffins that taste like cake. Can't wait to make them again using cranberries.

I followed most of the suggestions: I substituted 1/4 cup of banana for a 1/4 cup of butter, used oatmeal instead of bran because that's what I had, and added more spices adn they were delicious! I would definitely make them again, very moist muffins.

Replaced half the butter with banana or applesauce, increased the spices slightly, and used half dried cranberries, half raisins. This recipe is very adaptable to taste and health concerns. My 16 year old, football player who recently rejects breakfast prefers the mini-muffin size, pops them like candy and leaves the house with a handful.

Pretty good muffin, nothing exceptional though - good way to use up some zucchini. I liked that these were not too sweet. I added some blueberries as well and I think these might be a bit bland w/o the addition of extra fruit. Would be good with apple chunks added as well. Spices could be increased - could not really taste them.

I love this recipe! We used Oatmeal instead of the Bran, yummy!

Rating: 4
Made a double batch. Used 1/2 cup butter and 1/3 cup oil, so I'm not sure what that would amount to in a single batch. They were really tasty, good bran flavor without being overly grainy. I also used 1/2 t. allspice rather than the other spices; I thought this made them more suited to summer rather than fall. Cinnamon and cloves = fall to me! A good way to use zucchini.

Rating: 3
I took the advice of previous reviewers to substitute 1/4 cup banana for 1/4 cup butter. I was amazed at how tender and moist the muffins were with only 1/4 cup butter in the whole batch! This is a really great, healthy muffin. Even my butter-loving husband liked them. The cloves add a great element. My batter only yielded 11 muffins. We had these for breakfast with berries and yogurt - can't wait to make them again!

I, too, followed some of Howard's changes, using a mashed banana in place of half the butter. I used 1/2 cup dried cranberries for the fruit but I did add the milk. Found them perfectly cooked around 22 minutes. Nice, dense muffins.

Getting back to the topic at hand - muffins - this recipe is quite good but I too, made some changes to make it healthier. Thanks Howard, for all of your suggestions - very helpful. I also substituted some almond meal for the regular flour and applesauce for 1/2 the butter. Perfect results. As for bigfanny, if you simply want a "#&$@ muffin" as you so eloquently profess, make the recipe as is and get on with it without subjecting us all to your unnecessary venomous remarks. Although from the sound of it, you might benefit from a few healthy substitutions yourself.

I'm with you bigfanny! I love the reviews where the cook has changed most of the ingredients and then complains that it doesn't work.

After reading the recipe and reviews I made a "few" changes. As you'll see, after these changes the given name no longer fits. For the bran I used "Bob's Red Mill Wheat Bran". I cut the butter in half (to 1/4 cup) and replaced the other 1/4 cup with mashed banana. I used Turbinado (raw) sugar (note: creaming is more like mixing after the sugar and butter changes). I used double strength vanilla. Instead of raisins, I used 1/4 cup dried blueberries and 1/4 cup dried cranberries. Instead of walnuts I substituted almonds (diced medium). Finally I eliminated the milk completely as the consistency of the batter was great and I was concerned about the issue of the muffins being "gooey" in the center. I then cooked them in soft, Teflon "tins" without liners or further greasing. They came out great, didn't stick and were done in the middle! We brought them on a climb of Wheeler Peak (the highest mountain in New Mexico) and they not only didn't disintegrate, they were moist and tasted great even on the way down. I'd definitely do these again!

I'm not going to give this a rating, as I made several changes which produced the Great Muffin Calamity of 2008. I'll share what I did so that others don't make the same mistakes. I too subbed 1/2C of applesauce for half the butter. I creamed the butter and sugar together, added the eggs and then added the applesauce with the vanilla. I used wheat germ (had it on hand) instead of miller's bran. The final batter had the texture of muffin batter so I wasn't worried about too much or too little liquid. However, the muffins were quite gooey after 30 minutes. I baked them for another 5 minutes and still gooey. After another 5 minutes, they were burned on the bottom and still a bit gooey in the middle. I also used muffin papers, which I wouldn't recommend as the muffin sticks like CRAZY to the papers. I called the folks at Bob's Red Mill about Miller's Bran. It's unprocessed wheat bran. Hodgson Mill apparently makes some. Bob's sells regular (processed) wheat bran. I was able to salvage a few muffin tops but had to throw away the charred bottoms. Next time I'll try wheat bran and won't use as much applesauce (or none at all).

Just tried this recipe and they are really good with some changes. I did like a prev cook did and used half the butter, 1/2 C applesauce. I also increased the white flour to 1 cup, used only 1/2 C whole wheat flour, and then added a little more milk and some veggie oil to get the consistency I needed. They took right at 30 min. to bake and yielded 11 tasty, healthy muffins.

I heeded reviews and halved the butter and added 1/2 c applesauce. Also substitued dried blueberries for raisins. They were awfully delicious. More like moist delicate blueberry bran muffins and less like dense sweet zucchini bread.

Rating: 3
Nice taste, but like others have mentioned mine were still a little mushy inside after 35+ minutes in the oven. I pressed out much of the excess liquid from the grated zucchini, even. Perhaps I was not using the correct kind of bran. I used 1/4 c butter and ~1/4 c banana since others mentioned the muffins were a bit greasy, and I liked the result. I'll try them again, maybe with extra dry ingredients next time.

I was looking for muffin recipe that a) used zucchini b)was somewhat healthy and c) my kids would eat. I used Natural Wheat Germ instead of the miller's bran because I had it on hand and brown sugar instead of white. Even with the subsitution they were really sweet - I will reduce the sugar next time as another reviewer had suggested. My zucchini was rather large and had a soft centre so although it wasn't specified I scooped it out, grating the firm flesh. I was concerned that leaving it intact might cause the "watery" texture another reviewer mentioned. This recipe produced a sturdy looking muffin with a nice, light texture. The kids loved them!

I used dried blueberries instead of raisins -- very good. They reheated well, too, and are very good with some yogurt and honey.

Great recipe, and a great way to get a healthier, hearty muffin! Here's some of my variations, all of which have met with resounding delight: 1. add dried fruit, such as cranberries or cherries. 2.peel and grate apples instead of zucchini and add chopped apples. a great way to use up those inexpensive but yummy end-of-season apples from the farmer's market

Great recipe! I grated the zucchini finely--my muffins remained moist. You can also substitute the bran it calls for with "All-Bran"---tastes great. Nice way to get bran & veggies.

These are really delicious and I'm an experienced cook. I did, however, double the recipe and when I did I left out 1/3 Cup sugar and added only 3 Cups of zucchini. They rose nicely and are simply perfect. I hope all will try my version. :o)

Rating: 2
I too got soggy muffins...even after baking much longer than stated. I used only 1/4 cup butter and added 1/4 cup applesauce as another reviewer recommended. I also substituted the millers bran with all-bran which maybe wasn't a good choice. Perhaps millers bran absorbs more moisture? Anyways, I really like the flavour so I'll try them again only next time either reduce the amount of zucchini or increase the flour.

For those who want a lighter zucchini muffin, use 1 1/2 cups white flour and a half cup of wholewheat. Skipped raisins and walnuts and added grated rind of a lemon. Sprinkled slivered almonds over the top. Had to add a bit more milk. Very good!

These were allright. I guess I was looking for something more like zucchini bread, dark and gooey. I substituted Oat Bran, because that's all I could find...at least I think it was oat bran, lable's in Swedish. If anyone is interested, I did a nutritional analysis on this and came up with the following per muffin (assuming you make 12): Calories: 244, Fat: 12.25g, Carbs: 32g Fiber: 2.5, Protein: 4g I wonder how Splenda would work here...

Yikes! What a waste of ingredients. Followed verbatim, should have listened to advice about increasing flour. Even with extra time in the oven, these turned out a soppy,sunken mess. Way too much butter didn't help matters. Straight into the garbage.

I loved these muffins and my co-workers liked them too! I made some minis and some regular size. Alterations to the recipe: For the stick of butter I substituted 2 T butter & 2/3 cup apple butter. I used 1/2 c packed brown sugar, omitted the milk and used pecans instead of walnuts. When using raisins I always plump them in warm water first. I like tall muffins so I heaped the thick batter in the cups and they did fine!

Rating: 3
I only made this recipe becuase I had a giant zucchini to use. I really cheated and crushed raisin bran cereal instead of using miller's bran. I still added the raisins on top of that. I also did my usual baking substitution of replacing half of the butter with unsweetened apple sauce. I didn't have any cloves, so I skipped them. I also found the dough quite moist and they took longer to bake than the recipe called for. I made a double batch and got more than 24 muffins. They were really good -- I was surprised at how tasty they were -- even my husband liked them!

Rating: 3
This recipe is excellent. I increased the zucchini to almost 3 cups (only because I grated that much and didn't want to waste it!) and it worked beautifully. I left out the nuts, which I think I will be sure to add next time - they would probably give it some crunch that is needed. I was able to get 12 muffins, however they just barely rose to the top of the muffin tin. By the way, these taste better after they have cooled - letting them sit a day intensified their flavor - your kitchen will smell wonderful!

Substituted quick oats for the bran. Recipe was very wet so I doubled the white flour. I chopped up the raisins too. Made 12 hefty muffins. A bit greasy though, will decrease the butter next time.

I didn't use the nuts or raisins in the recipe. I had to add about another 1/3 to 1/2 cup of milk to get it to a moist enough consistency to use. But the muffins were quite good, nice texture, and were very filling. Didn't get 12 muffins though, only 9 because we like the tins to overflow a bit.
