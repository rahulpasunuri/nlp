I made this for a friend's birthday lunch today. We all thought is was delicious! I added a half tsp of cinnamon and a quarter tsp allspice to the apple mixture. I made the crust using all butter, but it still came out so tender and flaky. I had a bit of trouble with the dough sticking to the parchment, so next time would probably roll it out on plastic wrap and transfer it. It is lovely when it comes out of the oven!!

THIS RECEIPE WAS EXCALLENT!!! NOT TO SWEET BUT NOT BITTER JUST ABSTOLUTLY PERFECT...I RECIEVED SO MANY COMPLIMENTS...LIKE...'THAT WAS THE BEST APPLE PIE IVE EVER HAD' FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE!!! YUM-O

This is the best apple pie ever. I used whole wheat flour for the crust and all butter instead of shortening and butter. Otherwise I followed exactly. My husband loves apple anything and he can't get enough of this. I don't even like apple pie - except for this one.

This is a very nice twist on the traditional apple pie, with a rustic look that is nice. I suggest cooking the apples in a saucepan with some butter and sugar and cinnamon for about 15 minutes before putting into crust. Speeds up oven time, and will make the apple filling more tender and a lot more juicy. I think this recipe would be a failure without sauteeing the apples first. I also made the crust using 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour, and Earth Balance Buttery Sticks instead of butter... adds to the rustic quality of the recipe, and is a lot healthier for you! Oh, and I put an egg wash glaze on the crust to give it a nice shine and sprinkled cinnamon all over the top before popping in the oven -- also makes it much prettier. My husband and I can't stop eating it!

Also I did not use parchment..I rolled the dough out on a piece of floured plastic wrap (to help move it to the pan), and very lightly oiled the pan. (My review is below this)

The best apple pie I have ever made! And quite simple. The crust is indeed crumbly, like a shortbread cookie. Delicious! I do agree about adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the apple mixture, just a pinch. Also if it is left in the hot oven after cooking time is over (as suggested by another poster), there isn't a problem of filling dryness. It doesn't have the exact same texture as a regular pie, so if that is what you are looking for, use a different recipe. However my boyfriend and myself are very happy with this one!

I love the look of this and the topping, but found the apple filling to be somewhat dry (maybe a necessity because of the free-form...?)

Was a wonderful simple alternative to the traditional apple pie. The crumble and preserves add a fun touch.

I don't know why this recipe didn't work out for me -- maybe it was my apples. First of all, 4 apples made a HUGE mound of apples in the middle of the pastry. For me, the filling just wasn't sweet enough or juicy enough (it seemed to be just cooked apples, without much sauce). And I thought the parchment was a pain; I think it would have been easier to have skipped it altogether. I baked the full suggested time -- I think I could have reduced baking time a little.

Oh dear. The crust would not fold; I ended up using it to pull the crust up so I could fit a 10" springform ring around the pie. It took forever to bake and the apples came up dry. The filling lacked flavor. Next time I will season the apples as well as the topping. Cinnamon and nutmeg should do the trick.

I love it! We'll never make the boring traditional apple pie in a glass pan again. This pie is really tasty with some heavy cream poured over each slice when serving. Yum!

this is the best apple pie ever! I don't understand all these chickens who don't want to do the freeform crust! I have been making this once or twice a month since the summer.The freeform crust is what makes it great and everyone loves it!

We (and our company) loved this dessert. I wasn't brave enough to go without the pie pan, and will continue to use a pan when making it in the future. We warmed the slices and served them ala mode (vanilla ice-cream). I forgot to cut each slice crosswise into 3 pieces, but will do so next time.

I thought this was great fun to make and I really enjoyed the free form pie. Served it with cinnamon ice cream. Everyone loved it!

Highly recommend and fairly easy. I've made it twice and used a refrigerated pie crust both times. First time free form and second time a pie pan (which I preferred). For pie pan version I kept rest of recipe the same, including the apricot jam and crumb mixture on the bottom of the crust before adding apples then remaining crumb mixture on top. Watch cooking time - mine was done in less time than recipe called for. You'll only be disappointed when there aren't any leftovers.

Yup, always fantastic. I've made it a half dozen times in the last four months, and have both followed the recipe exactly and improvised (different crusts, apples, spices). Seems to be fool-proof. My favorite epicurious.com recipe.

Great recipe! I have made this twice already but both times I did it the lazy way with Pillsbury Pie Crusts. It works out great and looks really impressive.

Very good! The last time I made it, I just wasn't up to making or having crust; so, I pressed half of the topping mixture into a pie plate, spread the preserves, put in the apples, and then sprinkled the rest of the topping on. Worked really well, though I did toss the apples with a bit of flour. I also added some clove and allspice to the apples.

Outstanding! The crust was very easy to prepare and delicious. The flavor of the crust was almost shortbread-like. We served the pie with vanilla ice cream and would highly recommend this pie to anyone.

Great pie! Last minute decision to make, therefore I did cheat and use the Pillsbury Refrigerated Crust. Based on other reviews, I added toasted pecan pieces to the topping mixture, and sprinkled the filling mixture with a teaspoon of cinnamon. Came out perfect. Didn't love the free form shape... some of us thought it looked like a meat pie. Next time I am going to make it the same way but try it in a tradition pie plate.

Wow! This pie is a winner. Not only is it delicious but it makes a great presentation. As far as the apples that I used, I bought what looked good to me that day. I love to try new receipes, but I will make this again and again.

Just as wonderful as all the other reviewers described! Made two of these pies for Thanksgiving. Easy & fun to make. Used 5 apples (instead of 4), added cinnamon & nutmeg to them in addition to a little extra suger. Was worried about the apricot, but it really blends well with the other flavors and doesn't stand out. I used Pillbury pre-made pie crusts and they worked beautifully, but did have to use both in the package to make the 14" round. I used just a beaten egg white to glaze the crust and really was happy with the super shiny result. Once in the oven, it browned really quickly, but turned out fine. Received lots of compliments on presentation and wonderful flavor. This is a keeper!

Very good. Added pumpkin pie spice, dried cranberries, raisins,and walnuts. Used 4 golden delicious and 1 cortland & more sugar. A lot of appples. Made "crunch" into crumbs on top. Made mistake when lifting dough, and redid fold, which made dough weak, and cause juice to ooze. Took 1hr and 20 min, and apples were still al dente. Next time I'll use more spices and sugar, and remember to put crunch on before I fold top.

Excellent! Tasty, rustic, not overly sweet. Made w/Pillsbury crust rolled out & subbed 3 T pomagranite jelly for preserves. Added small handful dried cranberries for color & flavor. Will add more apples next time, if I can fit them in. A little more filling would be nice, & I may cut back the crumb topping slightly since there seemed more than enough for top of galette. Quick & easy w/ingred you probably have on hand (keep pie crusts in your freezer for a quick galette or dinner quiche in a pinch).

This was not hard to make. I didn't use the crust suggested but made a low-fat crust of my own. I added a little extra lemon juice and mixed the preserves in with the apples by accident but the pie still came out wonderfully. I will definitely make this again when company comes over.

Great pie!! My 3 year old helped me roll out the dough, since shape didn't matter so much. The result was a terrific, flaky crust and well flavored apples with a wonderful crunchy topping. I had no problem with the dough at all. I found it easy to work with as long as we floured well. Will make this one again and again.

This is an outstanding apple pie recipe. The crust was delicate and flakey and so easy to make. To the topping mixture, I added 2 teaspoons cinnamon instead of 1 teaspoon and I added a 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Also, I didn't bother with the circle shape, I made a rectangle as it was easier to roll out, it fit better on the parchment paper and cookie sheet. This is a steller recipe I will make for family, office, and dinner parties.

I made this pie for my inlaws and they loved it. Because of a lack of time, I used a prepared pastry, but the next time around I'll tackle the crust here as the comments indicate it's pretty special. The only other change I made was to add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples themselves. The presentation was excellent and the taste was great.

This was my first apple pie and I must say that it was nearly perfect. I used the flaky dough recipe and followed it to the T. My only variation was making a lattice top. This looked like a work of art and tasted absolutely delicious. I'll definately make this again.

This was okay, which surprised me after all the rave reviews. I cheated, too, and used the Pillsbury pie crust, which I hate doing, but I was pressed for time. I think this could be quite good if there were more spices in the apple mixture itself. It was just lacking something, but was nice.

I love this pie, I wanted to use the mixture of 5 assorted apples (red delicious, rome and macintosh) before they spoiled. I altered the recipe based on what I had on hand. It came out remarkably well. I didn't have time to make crust so I used a deep dish pre made pie crust, I used salted butter and dark brown sugar. I didn't have old fashion oats but I had a package of instant oatmeal; It was baked apple flavored so that worked well. One package is exactly one half cup. I brushed the glaze on the bottom and crust, but the pie was so tasty and looked really good, so even though the glaze was interesting, it wouldn't have been missed. Thanks, great stuff!

I made this for a baby shower that I catered, and it was a smash. Moreover, it was, as they say, "easy as pie." I just made it again today after finding out that I was going to have last minute company - did I mention that it is quick. I did cheat and use the Pillsbury pie crust. I recommend making it right before you plan on serving. For the shower, I made the pie the night before, and it didn't present as well the next day (though taste was not compromised).

Fantastic! Served it at a party to rave reviews. The crust was delicious. I made the crust dough and topping the day before, and used the apples suggested in the recipe and they were perfect. Will definitely be making this again, soon!

What an unbelievable apple pie! Made it with Lobo apples...to make sure apple are well cooked, shut off oven at the end of cooking time and leave in the hot oven for 1-2 hours..absolutely divine!!

Amazing!!! This was excellent and you will impress everone with the presentation. Everyone kept asking me where I bought it and when told my kitchen, mouths just kind of hung open. I did add a little cinnamon and nutmeg just bexause I can't imagine appl pie with out it and only brown sugar. I also used these appples called 'Transparents' which are very tart and used a lot more because they cook down quite a bit. Made extra topping and the stuff I didn't use I just stuck in the freezer.

Awesome!! Simple to make, delicious and spectacular presentation worthy of a restaurant (with a few modifications). I used the Pillsbury refrigerated dough to save time, I rolled one round out thinner for the bottom, and then rolled another round out thinner to place on the top. Before I set it on the top though, I used a mini "cookie" cutter shaped like an apple to make cutouts. I also added nuts to the topping for crunch!

A wonderful pie! I baked it 24 minutes after turning down the temp to 325, rather than 40, and it was perfect. I've never used golden delicious apples for a pie and now won't use any others! I also used refrig. pie crust, and skim milk instead of cream for the glaze. Beautiful!

This is BY FAR the best Apple Pie I have ever had. It got rave reviews at both Thanksgiving and Christmas. Also, I tried using store-bought Pillsbury pie crust (from the refrigerated section) and it works just as well, if not better. Making the crust was the hard part - this recipe is really easy if you use the pre-made dough.

This was a hit! Since I was also making a pumpkin pie the same day, I used another pastry (Flaky Pie Crust on this website)..... it worked perfectly. I also added a handful of slivered almonds to "crunch" mix. I'll be making this again soon as it was even easier than I anticipated.

This was definitely a keeper. I added walnuts to the top with the crumb crust. Next time I will not use all the milk in the crust at once, I thought it was a little to moist. But I will definitely make it again. Very easy
