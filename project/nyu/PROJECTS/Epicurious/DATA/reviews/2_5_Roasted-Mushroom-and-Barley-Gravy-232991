Ok so the recipe I can tell if I made it as stated would not turn out right and would take way too much time. Here's my updated version for everyone who didn't like the original: roast the mushrooms w the gills dry. Barley still roasts for an hour. Sauté onion, carrot, garlic and celery in a big pot w olive oil, add fresh tomatoes large chunks (tomato paste, really?) fresh thyme, kosher salt, fresh ground peppercorn and some bay leaves. Cut up the mushrooms and throw in there and the barley too. Add filtered water just to cover by 1 hand, bring to a boil for 5 minutes or so, put in the blender till its absolutely no chunks. There, you're done. Please don't strain it!

As a meat eater who prefers the flavor of vegetables this stands out as the most flavorful gravies I've ever made. If you like the taste of meat gravy, then just skip it. There are many time consuming steps that require patience and skill. This recipe is exactly what I look for in Gourmet magazine, RIP.

I've made this recipe for vegetarian friends for Thanksgiving and thought it was wonderful. Using a really good strong vegetable stock helped (all sorts of veggies, not just the onion skin, etc), and I didn't bother de-gilling the mushrooms either. Perhaps the chefs who found it too sweet were using too much paste or a somewhat low quality brand (no offense). It really doesn't take much paste. Also, I tried it once with a hand blender and once in a standup, and the standup blender did a much better job. Keep some stock on hand in case the finished product is too thick. Otherwise, it's a wonderful gravy.

the tomato paste dominated and made the gravy too sweet. this recipe wasn't worth the work

This gravy was alot of work, but it was worthwhile. It had alot of flavor, although I ended up having to add more H2O because it was so thick. It goes well on the tomato chickpea tarts!

WAY TOO MUCH WORK for mediocre results. The flavor was good but the gravy was thin. I ended up making a roux and adding it before serving - which helped. Invest your time on something more worthwhile.

One word: revolting. Thanks to this horrific recipe, I had no gravy for Thanksgiving this year. I should have listened to my gut instead of a recipe that says "don't worry about the burning smell from the barley"...unless the gravy was SUPPOSED to taste like bland burnt barley. After hours spent making this thin soupy mess, we ended up throwing the entire thing out. Next year? Back to my own Oyster Mushroom Gravy & no more experimenting!

I made this for a "practice thanksgiving" last week. It was a tremendous amount of work for a gravy, I will say. It did turn out delicious, but it's way too much work for all the effort involved. Besides, my vegetarian guests didn't really eat it -- they didn't need gravy without the turkey, I guess. I ended up using it as a braising liquid for sautéed chicken breasts. Yummy, but not worth the effort, I think.

A heck of a lot of work for not much oomph. Bummer - any suggestions on a "knock-your-socks-off" veggie gravy?
