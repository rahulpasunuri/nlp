I have been craving this recipie since I read "Julie and Julia". It wasn't a book terribly involved with the art of cooking but it did leave some cravings in its wake.

As simple as this recipe is, it is divine. I took London's advice and served it plated on toast, as opposed to doing the eggshell bit.

Delicious - another twist on the presentation is to do away with the egg cup, cut thick slices of toast, and cut out an egg-sized hole with a cutter from the middle of the slice, so that the eggs are supported in the middle of a slice of toast - hand round extra toast fingers if you want.
