I did half apples and half pears to do something different, and it was delish. Not my mom's apple pie, but definately the best apple dessert I've made!

To make vanilla sugar, place 2 cups sugar and one whole vanilla bean in a food processer. Grind, then strain. Extra sugar should be kept in an air tight container, and can be used in coffee or sprinkled over fruit.

This is really good, really easy, and it makes a bunch. Keep an eye on it after about 40 minutes....it started to burn around the edges after 45 minutes.

As it didn't give the amount of cinnamon (and I love cinnamon), I added 1 tablespoon to the vanilla sugar which I made. I took it to work for a Friday breakfast and everyone loved it.

Outstanding!!! A real comfort food dish, the company scrapped the bowl clean. The recipe left out the amount of cinnamon, so I added one teaspoon to the white sugar before adding on top of the apples and sprinkled on a teaspoon of vanilla because I didnt know what vanilla sugar was. I also cut the brown sugar to 1 cup.
