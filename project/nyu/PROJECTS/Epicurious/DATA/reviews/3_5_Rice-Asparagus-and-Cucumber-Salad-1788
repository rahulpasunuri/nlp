this recipe was delicious and cool for a summer dinner beside a grilled chicken burger. I did increase the amount of vinegar and the number of green onions. We also grilled the asparagus rather than steaming it, and that turned out well too.

I substituted orzo for the rice, omitted the dill, not a big dill fan, added chopped basil and halved grape tomatoes, 1 smashed clove of garlic (rubbed on board with the kosher salt) and plenty of black pepper. I also added 1 pound medium boiled shrimp, what a wonderful delightful summer meal served on beds of butter lettuce with carrot curls! Thank you epicurious for inspiring me.

Yuk! Very boring and bland. Was NOT the hit of the party.

Excellent summer side dish and not your usual tossed salad. I'll bring this one out every year!

This salad was amazing. It's fresh, colorful and easy. I thought the mustard flavor was just right-- I will definitely make this one again.

This is delicious! I got rave reviews from all the guests and everyone wanted the recipe. Definately NOT too spicey. All the kids ate it too.

The dressing was to mustardy - kids thought it was spicy and would not eat it, althought they like the salad ingrediants individually.

I prepared this as a side dish and served it to a group of well bred and fed couples. It was absolutely wonderful and colorful. Everyone raved. I served it in the fall but it would make an outstanding "summer salad".

This is a wonderful salad and I'm not even a fan of mustard. When I made the dressing, I sampled it and thought I was in heaven. I think I will make this dressing many times just as a salad dressing. The rice, asparagus and cucumber was also wonderful. I think it would be possible to use green beans when asparagus is out of season.

Every time I make this for company they rave. It is really delicious!
