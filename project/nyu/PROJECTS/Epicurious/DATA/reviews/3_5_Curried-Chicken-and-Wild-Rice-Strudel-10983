Based on the reviews (thank you) and some pantry items I made some alterations that worked really well. I added some morels I had laying around (my son roots around the woods like a french hog and they marry up nicely with the chicken and wild rice), I used a combination of raisin types as well. The phyllo is a little work but was tasty as well as attractive. If you want a moist stuffing, add some chicken stock and/or cream to the filling. I did whip up a reduction sauce made with butter, curry, white wine, chicken stock, heavy cream and chutney which I served the strudel on. That not only solved the dryess problem but really took it to the next level. I found Major Grey at my local grocery ( Mild mango ginger chutney imported from the UK). I would suggest serving with a mixed green salad with mango, goat cheese and carmelized cashews. Fume Blanc was a nice touch though I cooked with a sauvignon blanc. The fact of the matter is you can stuff anything into either a casing or pastry and it will taste good.

Made this for my family and everyone really liked it. I too think phyllo is to fussy, but one suggestion of tortillas I thought would be too thick and doughy. I put this into crepes, baked, then drizzled w/a cream sauce of butter, chicken stock, curry powder and cornstarch. Any gravy type moisture would do.Also, I had a bag of dried raisins, cherries and blueberries that I used instead of just raisins. Also, I saved a step by cubing chicken first then cooking in curry butter Will make again for sure.

Major Greys I saw in the supermarket and its a mango style chutney

The filling tasted much better the next day therefore I'd say make the filling a day ahead. I did find the filling a little dry but everyone who had it for dinner the day I made it, loved it and I guess that's all that matters. Will hold onto this recipe but will try and figure out how to make it more moist next time. I did dbl the recipe and made 2 strudels as the 4 of us are big eaters but it turned out one was enough for the 4 of us with a vege dish on the side.

Major Greys I'm pretty sure is British

Hi, Can any one tell me what type of chutney "Major Greys" is? As I'm not from the US... I must say the use of brand names in recipe ingredients happens quite a bit on this site, and it makes it hard for us international users. Any way, I used Tamarind Chutney and this came out well, but I would definitely user either 1/2 or all yogurt instead of the mayo, as it was a bit heavy. Also made it as individual parcels which came out very well

I followed the suggestion below to make this into a casserole and it was a great hit. I quadrupled the recipe and it fed four hungry brothers, myself, and a boyfriend-- probably eight people with normal appetites. This amount fit perfectly into my 10-inch square ceramic baking dish, and I baked it around 45 minutes at 350-375. It also reheats very well. Delicious!

I admit I did not follow the recipe exactly and made a few substitutions (apricots for raisins, peach chutney for mango chutney, added cilantro, green onion, peas etc etc) - but that's the great thing about this recipe, you can change it based on what you have in the house - increase and decrease ingredients - make it in a casserole - and it still tastes great! My boyfriend even had the soggy leftovers for lunch the next day and still thought it was a winner. I also did not bother with curry butter or the bread crumbs and it worked fine.

I hate to be the one to ruin this recipe's perfect score, but I just made it this evening and it was AWFUL! Very dry and boring. I would never even attempt to make adjustments to improve it...I will just never make it again.

I am hopeless with a stack of phyllo dough so I skipped that part and just made it in a casserole dish. Very tasty. I was tempted to skip the chutney since I find it very unappealing, but I'm glad I didn't. The flavors are very subtle but very complementary. Will make again.

Very tasty, no need for all the butter tho. substitute olive oil for butter definitly. Skipped the vermouth part, cashews and bread crumbs. went half yogurt half mayo, and used red onion red pepper, carrot and broccoli in the sautee before I added the chicken. ( Had left over chicken just diced it and added it to the finished veg sautee) Good call on the wheat tortilla wrap, will definitly try that next time.

I'm not good with phyllo, so mine dried up beyond hope halfway through making the purses. I had some extra flour tortillas on hand and substituted them -- I actually liked the tortilla version better, and it was certainly easier!

Upon consideration of other reviews, I decided to make individual phyllo "purses" instead of the whole strudel for a recent dinner party. Also, I used regular plain yogurt instead of mayo. Turned out spectacularly. When the purses were finished baking, they had a lovely golden brown color and I finished them off by tying the 'purses' with fresh chives right before serving. They were very elegant, when plated, and because they could be made and frozen the day before, I had plenty of time to spend with my dinner guests.

Delicious recipe and fairly easy. Use serrated knife to cut to avoid crumbling, and cut wider slices - about one and one half inches wide. Check at 20 minutes, as another chef suggested.

Fabulous recipe, rave reviews. Let the strudel sit for about 25-30 minutes prior to serving. Cover with foil & it won't crumble (at least mine didn't) I'm not a raisin fan so I didn't add them also did 50/50 mayo & yogurt.

This is a delicious, novel recipe - a whole curried chicken dinner wrapped in phyllo. What a great combination. I did add some chopped green onion since I like it so much with curried dishes. I agree with others that a nice presentation is difficult, but iot tastes so good. I may try it aganin as individual packets of phyllo triangles to avoid having to slice it.

This was very unique and delicious. Any suggestions on how to cut it into slices that don't crumble would be appreciated.

This was a fun dish to make, and it tasted wonderful. I can't stand mayonnaise, so I used yogurt instead, and it was great. This is one of the best recipes I've found.

Made this for a dinner party and it was wonderful. It is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever made. Everyone went back for seconds.

This was a tasty and lovely recipe. I couldn't find the specific chutney mentioned in the text, but made my own out of apricots and apples and it worked just fine. I also went light on the mayo with no noticable shortcomings to the dish. I prepared this meal with my non-cooking friend and she was absolutely wowed by both the process and the final presentation. My only problem was that the whole strudel looks elegant, but when sliced it tends to crumble and lose its form. For me and my friends, that's okay, but I'd hesitate to do this for big time entertaining. Don't let that stop you, though, enjoy!

I have made this recipe at least 3 times by now and it one of my favourites. I did find the baking time listed too long, at least for my oven. twenty minutes was fine, and too be safe it is best to start checking after the 15 minute mark to avoid the risk of drying out.
