This is one delightful salad, popping with color and flavor alike.

Delicious low-calorie side. Fresh tasting and beautiful. I replaced the arugula leaves with baby spinach. Still tasted great.

Try the dressing before doctoring the recipe, in my opinion. I wonder if it has something to do with different varieties of lemons that some are finding this dressing bland? For me (I like citrus based dressings already) the recipe is perfect as written. I did use mixed baby greens but as much as I love arugula, I'm sure I'd like straight arugula as well. We had this at Thanksgiving and I'm getting ready to make it again for Easter - seems to go with a lot of festive menus!

The fennel, apple combination is a great complement to the arugula, but I felt the dressing needed something for depth of flavor. I whisked in about a tablespoon of dijon mustard and it did the trick. We had this with chevre omelets and a glass of chardonnay for dinner, and it was happily gobbled up by the husband and proved to be a great introduction to fennel for my four year old.

This salad won rave reviews from our foodie friends... perfect light course - and a great way to let high quality ingredients shine through. One adjustment: Raw shallots were a bit too aggressive, so I lightly sauteed them to reduce the bite...

i've never used fennel before, but this salad turned out great. i had everything on hand already (except for the fennel), and it was a nice, easy, refreshing salad.

I made this recipe for a dinner party, substituting only baby greens for straight arugula, and it was a huge hit. This salad is super easy to make and tastes extremely fresh and light. I did use about 1/3 of a large shallot instead of a whole one, but I think that is just a matter of personal taste and doesn't affect the recipe either way.

This was served at our Thanksgiving dinner and it was outstanding! Everyone raved about it. It was very refreshing, light and fresh tasting. The pomegranate's added a unique, fresh and tart appeal to the salad.

Although it looked beautiful, this salad had no zing or tang. No vinegar in the dressing? Needs something, not quite sure what.

This is my favourite salad. It's fresh tasting and crunchy and such an easy dressing. I'll often use the dressing on other salads. I started growing Arugula and Fennel specifically because of this recipe. The pomegranate is best, but I've used dried cranberries or cherries (or omitted it altogether) if I was pressed for time or they weren't available.

Beyond fabulous. Beautiful looking, easy to prep ahead and refreshing. Amazingly the leftovers keep - this is an absolute winner.

Nice presentation, but strangely flavorless. All I could taste was the peppery-ness of the arugula.

I love this salad and make it all the time. It spoiled me for regular old salad. It's always popular when I make it for company, and is a simple way to impress.

As a professional cook there is nothing better than seen a clean plate after you serve a dish, and that is what I got with this great salad. I used half aragula and half romaine and that is the olny change that I made. Very tasty, crunchy, full of flavor and elegant

Perfect before or after a heavy main course. My guests have loved it. I do add a dollop of honey to smooth out the dressing. The pomegrante seeds make for a pretty presentation.

Beautiful presentation, wonderful taste, simple to make. I have made the salad three times, each time it was appreciated.
