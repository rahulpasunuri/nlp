Really liked these cookies but I made them a day ahead, and honestly, I liked the texture better the day they were made. However, my guests, who had not had them the day they were made, loved them, especially with the melon/granitas dessert.

This is a lovely cookie with great texture. It makes a nice alternative to a standard shortbread. Enjoy with an espresso!

This is a really nice twist on a traditional shortbread recipe. The texture of the cookies is great... the cornmeal adds a satisfying crunch. I subbed almond extract for the vanilla, and added about half a teaspoon of cardamom.

I love these cookies, my Italian mother used to make a great polenta cake and these remind me of it. It's basically a butter cookie with cornmeal, delicious. I used white cornmeal too, it works just as well. Buonissimi!
