Added mushrooms (to saute) and feta (when cooled). Substituted a bit of chopped italian parsley for the arugala. Took it to a bbq where there were 3 other macaroni salads, this was raved over by the guests! Wonderful.

Although I thought I would like this recipe, it was really lacking something. I too had the ingredients on hand and looked forward to making it - but in the end, it was rather dull. There are better pasta dishes out there.

I'm not surprised that I'm the first one--the recipe looked kind of weird. But I had all the ingredients on hand, so I figured why not. It was surprisingly good! I couldn't imagine using jalapeno pepper in an Italian pasta dish, but it melded in perfectly and just made it, as the Italian title says, piccante. I did follow the instructions to let it rest for an hour & I suspect that helps a lot. I had an extremely large jalapeno, so I just used half of it, and I tossed it into the Cuisinart with the garlic-pine nut mix so that it got chopped very finely. I also had very large bunches of arugula, which made quite a mountain when thinly sliced, so I added a bit more pasta water (about 1/3 cup in stead of 1/4) and another T of olive oil to extend the sauce. Also, there's no mention of serving it with grated cheese, whereas I think it's quite necessary to add 2-3 Ts of cheese per serving. I used Parmesan, but a feisty dish like this might do well with a salty cheese like Locatelli or Pecorino. An excellent dish for a Sunday night when we're heading back to the city and want to use up the fresh produce.
