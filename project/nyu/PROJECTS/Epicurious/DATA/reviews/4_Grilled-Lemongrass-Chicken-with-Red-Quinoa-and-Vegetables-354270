This was fantastic. The marinade was excellent but a bit thick and pasty. Also, I ended up with pieces of lemongrass that were inedible (I guess I need to peel a lot off but it seems like a waste...). Unfortunately I have yet to get my hands on organic chicken but I hear it is delicious. I think I used tricolor (mixed) quinoa. My husband loved it.

The chicken was very dry. I made the mistake of following the directions and pan-frying on medium till chicken is done. Next time I would put chicken in the oven at 350 (as others recommended), or change the protein to be tofu, shrimp or fish. Also, quinoa was bland even though i used my homemade stock. I added chopped mint and basil, then tried a squeeze of lime, but still bland. next time would add perhaps sauteed onions and/or ginger to perk it up. peas and sauce were terrific, so i would try this again!

The Quinoa really lacked any true flavor. The chicken was good, but not amazing

Monster hit with family. This is a very fresh tasting sauce that has a great Asian feel. Lemongrass, lime and ginger notes very strong. Really nice. I doubled sauce recipe. Had to be careful to count medium sized shallot bulbs, not whole shallots otherwise not sure what would happen. Fresh ginger was key. Cut soy sauce in half and added Vietnamese fish sauce for richer flavor. Next time might substitute 100% of soy for fish sauce. Used only half sauce for chicken marinade. Make sure breasts not too thick. 3 minutes per side on high non-stick pan for chicken, then finish in 350 oven until chicken is done. For balance of sauce, heated and thinned with 1/2 cup of chicken stock, for great sauce per another comment. Great idea! Added handful of chopped cilantro and mint to regular (not red) quinoa and it came out great. Cut vegetable oil on veggies by 1/2 teaspoon, and replaced with dark sesame oil for more flavor. Garnished with some toasted sesame seeds for nice look.

The marinade was very pasty. I didn't know if I added too much shallots and ginger. It was OK. My husband enjoyed it. I used the leftover marinade to make a sauce by adding a bit of cream.

Yum! Thanks to the previous reviewers, whose enthusiasm and positive comments made me want to try this dish! I did sear the chicken breasts, then put them in the oven, as so many recommended. They were fantastic and moist (I could cut them with the side of the fork). When making the marinade, I realized I did not have soy sauce, but it still was delicious, so try this even if you don't have an ingredient on hand! The most noticeable tastes in the sauce were lime, lemongrass and ginger. After cooking the chicken breasts in the oven, there was a little sauce remaining. I don't know that it needed to be doubled, but it was just me and my husband tonight, and I scooped the extra sauce onto the chicken breasts and quinoa just before serving ... FABULOUS! I have no more sauce for tomorrow's leftovers, so maybe upping it a little works! I used French green beans, and they were a hit. Don't think I needed the extra time and expense of the bell pepper. My husband loved it, and so did I!

I made this one for Father's Day, and my entire family agreed that this was a "4 forks recipe".

This was very yummy. I overdid it with the salt, so beware and take the added sodium from the soy sauce and broth into consideration. I followed others' advice and seared the chicken first then finished it in the oven. The chicken was juicy and tender.

Delicious marinade - wish I had doubled recipe. I seared the chicken and then finished in the oven for 18 minutes. So tender. I kept about 1/4 cup of the marinade and added it to the pan while the chicken was resting (with some chicken broth). Sauce was wonderful.

Great dish, very easy to substitute tofu for chicken. There was more than enough marinade to go around without doubling the recipe. I took some liberty with presentation after reading other reviews mentioning that the quinoa itself was a bit bland. I ended up cutting the tofu into bite sized pieces and mixing the tofu, veggies, quinoa and mint together (once each separate part was prepared) as a stir fry. I added some extra marinade to the whole dish. The sauce makes the dish!

The marinade for the chicken is almost tasty enough to eat by itself. I followed JennieC's advice to jazz up the quinoa and it turned out great.

I used Mahi Mahi with this tonight and it was wonderful. Because the marinade was so good, I baked the fish @ 375 for 22 minutes and served with the quinoa (as directed) and steamed green beans. I liked it better this way than grilled!

I made this the other night for a house full of family. It was excellent! I did make additions. I doubled the marinade like many reviewers suggested and I was glad I did, I also added about 5 Kaffir lime leaves. I marinated a mix of chicken and tofu, because some of the guests were vegetarian, everyone raved about their protein. I also followed the advice of many reviewers to sear the chicken and finish it in the oven which I always prefer to do and it was perfectly moist and juicy. Instead of tossing the veg with all the fresh mint I added half of it into the cooked quinoa, along with some chopped fresh cilantro and basil. To finish the meal I heated up the remaining marinade with some stock added into it to thin it out a bit. I used it as a sauce to pour over the chicken and tofu right before serving the meal. This meal was quick, easy and impressive and I will added to my repertoire of go to meals.

We loved this. Next time, I'd double the marinade in order to have a little on hand for dipping sauce. Something about big hunks of chicken sometimes freaks me out, so I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and mixed it in to the quinoa/snow pea mix. I think that distributed the flavor from the marinade a little more evenly. I will definitely make this again.

Amazing! This dish will renew your interest in chicken breast.

This marinade is incredible. Doube the amount (of the marinade) and set aside the extra portion to use as a sauce (heat it up for 15 seconds in the microwave) Also, I suggest NOT cooking the chicken completely in the pan. Sear the outside for a few minutes and then put it in the oven @350 to bring it up to 165 internal temperature. If you follow the above directions, you'll dry out the chicken and burn the outside.

The chicken has a wonderful flavor and the quinoa has a very nice color and texture. Didn't make the veggies, probably would tie the flavors together - maybe next time.

Quick and easy and looks beautiful. First time for trying Quinoa and really enjoyed it. Friend didnt like anything that was in the marinade and he loved the chicken. He even asked me to save the recipe to make it again. Perfect for week night dinner or company.

I couldn't find red quinoa, so I used regular. This recipe was delicious and fresh and healthy. My fiancee liked it too.

This was great. The marinade really made the dish. The quinoa is a little bland by itself but a wonderful accompaniment when eaten with the chicken. I also used the marinade on the veggies. Highly recommend.

Quinoa, is not a grain, but a seed packed with protein. It is excellent as a substitute for couscous in any dish.Or as a substitute for pasta in any salad. A wonderful addition to any persons palate, this dish is just one example of the delicious use of Quinoa.

This is wonderful! Simply wonderful! I also used the lemongrass in a tube found at the grocery store. Worked wonderfully. Used on chicken first time around. Making with prawns tonight.

Great marinade! I used in on tofu steaks instead of chicken, and the brown sugar gave those bland tofu steaks amazing carmelization. Plus, without having to worry about contamination, I used the raw marinade as a garnish, which really enhanced the flavor of the quinoa and the sauteed swiss chard we had on the side. This marinade goes to the top of my list for chicken, fish, and (yes) tofu.

This isn't bad - the chicken is DELICIOUS. The rest is a bit bland. But man, the chicken alone is worth making. We had it in salads all week!

The chicken was AMAZING (3.5-4 forks for sure). Great flavour. The rest of the dish was a bit meh. Not bad, but lacking in zip. But the chicken makes up for it.

This was very tasty, and actually made me FEEL GOOD! There was quite a bit of the marinade left, so it was helpful to read that one cook sauteed the veggies in it. Lemongrass is not cheap, so I hated to throw out the extra sauce. I cooked the Quinoa with just water and salt and pepper, and it was still very tasty. Other veggies to saute would be helpful, as snap peas were not available. What about squash maybe? Ideas?

This was a very tasty meal! The chicken took a lot longer to cook than the recipe called for, but perhaps my pieces were too big. The marinade was delicious and copious. I cooked the chicken in all of it, removed the chicken when it was done, and cooked the veggies in the remaining sauce. Healthy and good!

I didn't think 2 hours would be enough time for the marinade to penetrate the chicken breasts. But I was pleasantly surprised, it was very tasty. I cooked the chicken in a grill pan until it had nice dark grill marks, then finished in the oven for 10 minutes while I stir fried the veges. I made extra chicken breasts for lunch (over salad), they were even good cold.

I really like the marinade and will use on fish too. I saved some on the side to use on the cooked chicken and it was great. I did cheat by using the Gourmet Garden brands of pre-minced lemon grass and ginger that come in a squeeze tubes. I found Red Quinoa in a box at the health food store. It is similar to cous cous in the preparation, but toasting it added to the flavor. Check out www.quinoa.net The only other thing I did differently was to toss some french green beans in with the Quinoa near the end of cooking to let them steam instead of cooking snap peas in oil. What a healthy, refreshing, light meal.

It was ok. The marinade was way thicker than I thought. Instead of Quinao I used a pack of Kashi whole grains. It was a good healthy dinner. My boyfriend and I are dieting.

I did not know what quinoa was either. You can look it up in the food dictionary provided by Epicurious. It seems to be some sort of grain similar to couscous. Apparently a very good one.
