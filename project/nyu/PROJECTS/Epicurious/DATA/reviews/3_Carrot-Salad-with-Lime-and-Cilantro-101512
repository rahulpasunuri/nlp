I added fish sauce to the dressing along with garlic chili paste and some sugar for a carrot version of the thai green papaya salad. Yum.

We are undergoing a stink bug invasion, so my family cannot stand anything with cilantro in it (they smell the same). I substituted flat leafed parsley, which worked great. I also doubled the lime juice and added a touch of honey as suggested by other reviewers. A great summer side with my grilled Tandori chicken.

I used lime juice, oil, and cilantro to taste. I chunked the carrots with the slicing blade of a food processor instead of shredding them. Refreshing and delicious.

Easy, easy, easy. Perfect for quick side dish. Based on other reviews I added a touch of honey and a squirt or two of chopped chili (always on hand in the fridge). I also added a small handful of currants to up the sweet and cut the hot chili. Nice healthy summer dish.

Nothing special.

This dish was much improved after I doctored it up, based on the suggestions of a couple of other reviewers. I added 3 small chopped tomatoes, much more lime juice, more cilantro and sauteed onions (half a large Vidalia one). After the onions were cooked, I added a couple of big squirts of Thai hot chili sauce and mixed it into the onions before adding to the rest of the ingredients. The chili sauce definitely helped the other flavors meld together and provided just enough bite.

This was nice and it was easy to prepare. It went very well with the tandoori chicken.

This dish was nothing special - not really worth the time it took to grate a carrot. Also, carrot and cilantro don't really go that well together so thats was little flavor harmony. For something much better, try the GARBANZO BEAN SALAD WITH TOMATOES AND CHIPOTLE CHILIES on this site. THAT is devine!!

Made this side dish for monthly Chick Night. Perfect picnic dish, everyone enjoyed it.

Fast, easy, healthy, and delicious...what more could you ask for? I added a little more lime juice than called for in the recipe. It nicely balanced the natural sweetness of the carrots. Another winner!

I added 4 tablespoons of lime juice and 4 tablespoons of cilantro. 2 teaspoons of sugar to balance it. The recipe as written is far too bland for my liking. Next time I will add honey like one reviewer did. This is a refreshing salad for a hot summer day.

I added some honey to sweeten it up a tad - it was a HUGE hit with my hard-to-impress family!

This is very nice and refreshing. I don't think the oil adds much, so if you are concerned about fat you could leave it out.

This is a fantastic variation from the routine carrot recipe. We served this for Mother's Day family gathering, and it was a big hit.

This was outstanding for a low fat vegetable salad option. My guests loved the cilantro and carrot combo. I would add about 1 extra tablespoon of lime to give extra flavor.

This dish was so simple to make and the taste was fantastic! If you shred the carrots in a food processor, it takes all of 15 minutes to make. I served it with grilled Tandoori chicken, and it really set off the flavors nicely. Plus, the bright orange color is a nice addition. I will definitely make this again!

Very light and refreshing side dish. Goes great with the Tandoori BBQ sauce and Chicken.

A nice picnic side dish - A local market makes a salad similar to this but throws in about 1/4 of a thai chili to give it a kick.

I cubed the carrots instead of shredding them and served them with Indian food. The color was great. Even better the next day. Will make again when cooking Indian food.

We make this salad all the time at home, with a few variations. Shred the carrots and add some chopped tomato, as much as you like. In the meantime, heat a little oil and add about a tablespoon of mustard seeds (for 4 carrots) when the oil is really hot. When all the mustard seeds are popping, add half an onion, minced finely. Cook until the onions are soft and add to carrot mixture. Add chopped cilantro and 1 minced serrano chile. Season with salt and lime juice. The result should be tangy. You can also add cooked chickpeas if you like.

Wonderful side dish served with sauerbraten and mashed potatoes. The different sweets, sour, and spices really compliment each other.

It sounded interesting but.... a pretty unremarkable salad. One notch above eating carrot sticks...
