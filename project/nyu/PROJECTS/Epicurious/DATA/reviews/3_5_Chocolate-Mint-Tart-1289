I made these twice over the holidays (mini tarts as suggested) and did love the pastry. However, I wasn't overly impressed with the filling and glaze. This is an extremely rich dish, perfect for chocolaholics! If I make it again, I might try to lighten up the filling but keep the glaze the same.

I made this for for my family for Christmas and everyone loved it -- including my picky husband. I had to continue to heat the chocolate to get it all melted. This is easier to make than it may appear. I'm not expert cook and I had no problems -- even with crust.

This is a 3 Wow recipe. Served this to some guests and thats what I got...3 WOWS! Used really good semisweet. This tart is the perfect after dinner mint.

I only made the tart crust because I have a more simple recipe for the filling. The crust is wonderful. I made 20 2 1/2-inch tarts. I used a 3-3 1/2-inch cookie cutter to cut rounds then pressed into fluted tartlet pans. You can keep these crusts for weeks in covered dish. Leave them in the pans and fill as needed. I've made the crust several times now.
