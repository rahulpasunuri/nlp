This was very good. Light but flavorful. The potato didn't cook enough (hard) so I would slice paper thin or skip, it's just fine with out.

Potatoes were not cooked enough and dish was bland. One of the packets leaked. Nothing special.

This is now one of our favorites and in the weeknight rotation. My kids think the foil packets are fun and it's so easy to make them. You can prep in advance and just throw on the grill when you're ready. As the last review said, it's the adaptability and cooking direction that's great. I love using haricot vert, cut into bite sized pieces. I've never used butter but am sure it's delicious. This is probably the 4th time I've made these. Tonight I'm trying chicken broth instead of wine and added regular green onions. Yum!

I think the best part of this recipe is the adaptability of it. It's a great jumping-off place. The fish was cooked so perfectly, but the general flavors were lacking. I think asparagus or green beans would be better than snap peas, as they had the wrong flavor. Also, consider using chicken broth instead of wine and also adding some dried herbs, pepper, etc. Also, capers should be optional. Enjoy!

I was unable to locate snap peas at our local store so i used Green Giant Garden Vegetable Medley(Simply Steam) which has Roasted potatos, sugar snap peas, red pepers & garden herbs. It must have been the herbs because I found the end result AWESOME!

This was lacking taste. I added some dill and extra lemon juice at the end and it was good, but not great. The foil packets are a bit tidious and the liquid ran out of some of them.
