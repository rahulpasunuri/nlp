Inspired by this recipe, I take a large, white platter and randomly place honey dew melon wedges. Tuck the prociutto slices here and there. Scatter fresh blueberries, halved yellow pear tomatoes, and crumbled feta. Drizzle the basil oil over all. (I dont strain it.) Sprinkle with toasted pine nuts, kosher salt, and coarse ground pepper. I serve with crusty bread which can be dipped into the basil oil. I've also done this on individual white plates as a first course. Easy, elegant, and colorful.

I served this to my family and got a range of reactions. I liked it a lot, as did one of my brothers. My boyfriend and another brother thought that it was okay, and my Dad thought that it didn't make any sense at all (although he ate all of it). I liked the mix of sweet and salty, although some found it disconcerting. Overall, I think that this dish is easy, and it will probably impress some of your more discerning audiences. I just wouldn't serve this to anyone with simple tastes. This dish is also nice because it can be prepped ahead of time and thrown in the fridge.

Loved this. I seared my prosciutto (to make it crispy) and cut in matchstick sized pieces, but this was a lovely salad to serve for company. Yum!

Made this with wild boar prosciutto. Did not use the cantaloupe, but had a nice watercress salad dressed with a vinagrette made with some of the basil oil plus balsamic and lemon. Added 1 clove garlic and salt to the basil oil - excellent suggestion from a previous reviewer. Shaved parm/reg instead of feta. Impressive first course.

Had I not already tried the cantaloupe, basil and prociutto recipie with fresh mozarella also on this site I would have rated this a three. But the other recipie is so much tastier that I only gave it a two. To me the blended basil did not taste as good as the cut up pieces in the other dish - which I gave four forks to!

This recipe is one of those little gems that lurk around behind the "most popular" scenes. Simple, showy, and fantastic flavour - good quality ingredients is the key. Like another reviewer, I used 1/8 of a melon per person.

An excellent and simple recipe. I used only 1/2 cantaloupe and served it as an appetizer for 4 ppl.

It doesn't get much better than this. The surprising mix of bold basil, fresh cantaloupe, and savory prosciutto topped with the pleasantries of feta and roasted pine nuts creates a real masterpiece.
