I was initially worried about cooking the chicken in the open skillet, making the kitchen smokey and greasy. Well, it was totally worth it. The chicken turned out to be the most tender chicken breast I'd had in a while. For the salsa, I decided to roast the shallot and garlic with tomatoes because I'm not a big fan of raw garlic or shallots. I also skipped the onion. The "salsa" turned out wonderful; my husband loved it. The best part of it is, this recipe is so simple to make. It took an hour to make this and couscous out of a box. Can't wait to do this again after the herbs replenish themselves.

I was surprised by a comment about how much chopping was involved - not that much, really, and a very fresh-tasting and simple result. I used all shallots rather than onion/shallot, and you could certainly add more kick if you wanted. Overall a flavourful and healthy meal that I will absolutely make again.

It's really bugging me that this recipe is called 'griled' chicken, seeing as how nothing in this recipe gets anywhere near a grill. Am I just missing something? In any case, I thought that it was pretty good. I don't usually pan-sear chicken, but this had a nice flavor. I also liked the salsa, but I would suggest only using the shallot. If you use the onion as well as the shallot, it will be way too onion-y. People complained that there was a lot of chopping inviolved, but I think that it wasn't bad and that they should maybe work on their knife skills. Overall, I think that this is a good way to use summer ingredients. I may make it the next time it rains.

I've made this a few times now, with a variation each time. I use a full cup of onions in the salsa and a whole jalapeno, still cored. I also prefer to cook the chicken uncovered so the oil remains thick, and garnish the plate with a few slices of a bread of your choice, to dab up the left over oil and salsa. Pretty time consuming though.
