This dish is not realy spicy, but it is a good base to start from. I made this adding olive oil, lime juice and zest along with garlic rosemary and cumin seed. I also cooked it on the grill med-high for 5 minutes per side or until pink in the center and after cooking covering the meat for 5 minutes to let the juices reenter the meat. I made this a second time using a butterflyed pork loin marinating all day in the fridge. this is served with buttered Nantes Carrottes on a bed of rice. This is super easy since all you have to do is put all the ingredients in a zip lock bag and stick it in the fridge.

Decent but not amazing. I tried to marinate the pork for several hours, but the marinade still wasn't zesty enough. My boyfriend said it tasted great, though, and he usually likes his food to be very spicy.

The flavor from the marinade was much fuller than I expected and paired perfectly with the pork. My whole family loved the recipe. It will definitely be added to the regular menu.

My mom used to make overcooked, tough, dry pork chops. I was in the market for a marinade, and used a few of the ingredients in this recipe and the reviews and it turned out great. I marinaded the chops in a ziploc in the fridge all afternoon with 1/2 c fresh OJ, 1/4 tsp each of black pepper and chili pepper flakes, and 2 cloves of minced garlic. I threw these on the BBQ grill, along with a bunch of asparagus sprayed with olive oil. The chops were wonderfully tender and juicy, and the asparagus was a dream. Will def make again.

Like other reviews stated, this is bland and needed a lot to be spiced up. I sauteed onions and garlic before seering the pork, which I chopped, and stirred it with rosemary sprigs. I added the pork to a salad. Quite a change.

this was ok. the nice parts: a sweetness from the citrus, and a nice kick. however, there just wasn't much flavor--too bland. i doubt i'd make it again. but, it was fairly easy so i don't regret trying it the once.

We doubled the orange juice and increased the proportion of spices (except black pepper). Scored chops and marinated for about 45 minutes. We browned garlic in olive oil before adding chops. Sauted chops in garlic olive oil until nearly done, added marinade and heated until sauce reduced. We then added fresh, sectioned Tangelos and heated through. Served immediately w/ wild rice. Delicious!

Not very impressive. I thought it was a little bland, but stragely had too much black pepper. Just Ok. Probably won't make this again.

I have made this a couple of times - not as spicy as I'd like - but very juicy. 6 min. per side was perfect. Just be careful not to cook on too high of heat or liquid will cook out. Overall it is a very nice mild flavor.

This was fantastic. I went very heavy on spices and added garlic to olive oil when cooking pork. When the pork was just about cooked, I added the marinade and juice of 1/2 lime, then reduced it to glaze pork on high heat. Served with garlic risotto, salad of tomato and broccoli with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and fresh plums for dessert to make the best meal in years.

I've made this a couple times and like it, though I always use more maranade (1/3 to 1/2 more, usually) and cook the chops for 7 or 8 minutes on a side.

I have to agree with Debbie from Delaware. This is the first recipe from Epicurious that I wasn't wild about. I thought the chops were too dry and the marinade contained WAY too much pepper. Still searching for a good pork chop recipe!

I've made this one several times. However, I double or triple the amount of the marinade and pour some of the marinade into the pan with the chops. As the sauce cooks off, I periodically spoon more over the chops. This seems to provide much more flavor (they're quite spicy) and also helps keep the pork chops moist. And I also find that I need to cook them for longer than the 12 minutes specified.

I marinaded the chops for four hours or so in hopes there would be more flavor to this marinade. I found it bland and quite a disappointment. This was my first DUD on epicurious. I am usually really happy with the recipes I pick.

I thought this was very good a hit with my family. I made a sauce out the exess marinade it really added to the dish.

This was okay but next time I feel like a citrus sauce I'll make one of these much better recipes: Ginger-Orange chicken or Orange-Brandy chicken.

This was very tasty, however I would double the oj and be careful not to over cook.

We like our meat more well done so cooked it considerably longer than 12 min.. Probably because of that fact we didn't have much sauce so next time we'll add extra orage juice at the end. This might make a great stir fry sahuce.
