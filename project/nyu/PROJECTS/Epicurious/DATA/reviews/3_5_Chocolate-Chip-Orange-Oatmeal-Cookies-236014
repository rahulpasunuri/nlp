I used 1/8 tsp orange oil (from Sur La Table) in place of the zest, and they turned out amazing. Will definitely be making again!

Very good. Three modifications: I baked for 10.5 minutes (brown on the edges, soft in the middle), added dried cranberries, and used quick-cook oats.

These are so great. I love the combination of orange and chocolate all of the time, and oatmeal cookies are my favorites, so I thought why not try it? Really great. My husband and I almost ate the whole dozen! I found that they did cook faster than the recipe said. Sadly some got burned on this first attempt but I will definitely be making them again. Maybe tonight....

I made 4 changes to this recipe: melted the butter (was in a hurry), used grapefruit zest (no orange), used baking powder (no soda) and added a few drops of pure orange oil. The result was a very hard, deliciously perfumed cookie that kept well---perfect with a glass of milk, and they were gone way too fast.

I already rated and reviewed this cookie--which we love--but have been puzzled by the negatives from other reviewers. As I thought about this, I thought it might be useful to add that the expectation of this cookie might have an influence--this is not a cookie jar cookie. It's delicate and, in my opinion, best served as a part of a special dessert--along with a sorbet, etc.--than a stand-alone cookie. I would have to agree with the less-favorable reviewers that if one is looking for a great plain cookie,your basic chocolate chip/oatmeal cookie, perhaps with a little orange zest added, would much better serve your purpose.

Omigosh..these are amazing! Paired them with a tangerine sorbet on this website for a casual dinner party--yum.

I don't know what you people did, but this is n-a-s-t-y! What a waste of ingredients!

I made these twice because the first time they were so bad, I thought I did something wrong. Second round was just as bad-not at all what I expected. No flavor.

A huge success! Perfect balance of crispy/chewy and comforting/exciting. And so easy! No electric mixer necessary, which is perfect for my dorm kitchen. I even used whole wheat flour, but my guy friends didn't notice because the orange masked the taste.

Not sure if I did something wrong but neither I nor my guests were impressed. The cookies were hard, not moist and chewy like I like them. The orange alsocame through very strongly. Probably won't try them again.

Great cookies. Loved 'em.

This is a weird recipe; so much melted butter, and it doesn't make very many cookies. They do spread; I use parchment and it also helps to chill the batter between batches. I add 1/2 teaspoon orange extract to pump up the citrus flavor a bit. These are worth making; they're homey but just a little more interesting than ordinary oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.

Go on and double this one; you'll want all the cookies you can get! I followed the suggestion to add coconut and walnuts; my only suggestion is to toast both first for added flavor.

Yum! I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 teaspoon of pure orange extract. For chocolate, I used a 12 oz pkg. of Hershey's special dark chocolate chips and I found 12 minutes to be a good baking time . My expert cookie reviewer - my husband - says it is a definite keeper!

Kids didn't like it. Nothing special

Yummmmmm! I doubled the recipe, used 1 & 1/2 cups choc chips, 1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts and 1 cup sweetened coconut - the orange zest really sets this cookie apart...

These were not impressive. Not a lot of body to them .... won't make them again.

This was so simple and delicious. I agree with other reviewers that you can afford to be heavy handed with the chocolate chips My boyfriend ate all 12 in one night (well I snuck in one) and declared them the BEST!

I thought this recipe was fabulous, but 2 small changes. I don't think they needed to cook for 15 minutes and I like a little more chocolate in my cookies. :)

These were good on a fall day. However, they only took 11 minutes to get very dark, not the 15 minutes in the recipe. Be careful! I think some walnuts would add a lot as well since they were ok, but not that special. Nice orange flavor.

This is the BEST cookie I have ever tasted with Oatmeal in it. The orange zest adds a great zing to the chocolate.

I made a double recipe last night and brought them to work today. They are tasty and chewy, as easy to make as any other drop cookie, and especially good right out of the oven when the chocolate is still melty. I made a couple changes (keep in mind these were for a double recipe): I used 2 tsp. of orange zest instead of 1.5 tsp. I used a little extra vanilla, which I always do for baked goods. I used only 1/2 cup of butter, instead of 3/4, and replaced the missing butter with 3/4 cup flax seed meal (as per replacement instructions on flax package). I was nervous making this significant a substitution, as I usually just embellish whats already in the recipe, like the extra vanilla I always use, but they turned out well. They were probably darker brown than they would otherwise be, and not quite so rich and buttery, but hey, at least they have omega-3 :) Coworkers liked that they were chewy, a little "healthy" tasting from the oats and flax, a little sweet (not too sweet), liked the touch of orange, and of course appreciated that they had chocolate! I might use a little more chocolate next time, but I am otherwise happy with how they turned out.

I have just tried the recipe tonight and was pleased with the results. I like the orange zest - it makes the cookies a little different. I also added a couple of tablsespoons of almonds to give it more texture.

A nice clean taste.

Not spectacular. Kids thought there were "just ok". Don't waste your Callebaut on these ones.

I haven't made this particular recipe but for years have used the oatmeal cookie recipe on the Quaker Oatmeal box and added orange zest, chocolate chips and walnuts. They are my very favorite cookie. Definitely worth a try. Everyone that has tried mine loves them.

Very easy and delicious. Will make again.
