Is Indian rice pudding supposed to be this soupy? The taste was good, with the basmati giving it a really nutty flavor. But is there a typo in the recipe... is it really 1/3 cup rice to FIVE cups of milk? The milk thickened nicely, but this never reached any kind of "pudding" consistency. Next time, I'll go back to a traditional baked rice pudding.

If you like the rice pudding served at many Indian restaurants, you will surely like this. It is about as close as you can get. Delicious!

This is an Indian or Pakistani Kheer and it is as good as any I have had in either country.
