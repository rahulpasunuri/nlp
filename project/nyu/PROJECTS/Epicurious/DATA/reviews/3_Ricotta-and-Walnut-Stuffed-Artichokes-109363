I agree with the cook from Redlands - steam or cook the artichoke before taking out the center - it is much easier - I too think the baking time was too short in the recipe - 30 minutes is closer + 15 uncovered. Be careful not to use too much stuffing it can overpower the artichoke. I might make it again but only to see if I can do it better.

I've never made anything like this but it sounded terrific. I got confused when I read the review that described the preparation differently. Should I follow the instructions with the recipe or something else?

I can't believe that this recipe had been give 4 forks. I made it for my dinner club and found it to be very disappointing. The flavor was marginal and it was difficult to eat. I would not recommend it.

This recipe was wonderful. I have been eating artichokes since I was a little kid and this was a welcome change! Filling enough to be a main course.

Remove the choke BEFORE cooking? The two other cooks I showed this recipe to also laughed at that instruction. I steamed 4 large artichokes for 25 mins first, and then the melon baller worked just fine. I wish I'd stuffed a couple layers around the center first, and 1/2 stuffed the centers for baking. For baking, I cut off the trimmed stems, slivered them, and dropped them into the wine/water around the chokes. After baking, I inserted the succulent stem slivers into the stuffing. It took 20 mins in the oven for the chokes to warm to room temperature after being in the fridge, and another 40 for the ricotta to set. I steamed and stuffed the 'chokes one afternoon, and baked and served them the next evening. Convenient for parties. Unusual and very rich taste.
