I wasn't that impressed. I was shocked to see so many 4 ratings. This was a decent recipe, but nothing special. I don't think I would make this again.

Really enjoyed both eating this and cooking this. May try it again and use less chicken and add shrimp, otherwise it was great. Plus, we're eating our left overs with bread, cheese and some red wine tomorrow night. Thinking a cows milk semi soft or soft cheese.

Good recipe...nice and fresh, and deliciously healthy. Fresh herbs are definitely the key here.

I made this recipe as written and it came out pretty good, but some simple substitutes could make it excellent (IMO). Rather than using dried herbs to roast the tomatoes, I think fresh always create a better dish. I will most likely use a combo of basil, parsley and a pinch of either rosemary or thyme. Not sure that I agree with the Worcestershire, so will omit. Replace the red wine vinegar with balsamic and,of course, some fresh grated cheese to finish it off! Served over pasta.

I prepared this recipe tonight and both my husband and I loved it - I didn't have the herbs de Provence so I used a substitute spice I frequently use from the Columbia restaurant in Tampa - this is certainly a keeper and I sent it to my daughter...

This has become a staple as it is one "bird" recipe that my husband likes. I think the oil is a bit much and used at least 1/3 less. It is easy to add additional veg. to taste. Serve over jasmine rice cooked with chicken broth and more herbs, usually tarragon.

I made the recipe as directed and served it over rotini with garlic bread. While the sauce was good atop the garlic bread, it wasn't flavorful enough to make the chicken exciting. Maybe adding some tomato paste would help? Also, though the recipe doesn't specify, you should make it with split chicken breasts--I used whole ones and had to roast it for an extra 7 minutes.

Yummy! The sauce reduced and thickened nicely, great flavor and very easy. This would adapt well with any herb combination that you have on hand. I served it with egg noodles, which went very well together. Since there were just 2 of us for dinner I only used 2 half breasts, but I used the full amount of tomatoes and sauce. My only complaint was that 6 T of olive oil was a bit much, you could use much less and it would still be a hit.

I made this for dinner tonight. It was a real hit. Since this was the second time I made it, I made some changes. First off, since my partner has allergies to everything in the onion family I left out the scallions. Rather than reducing the sauce, I added some french olive oil (which has a somewhat verdant taste) and marinated the entire chicken breasts uncut and covered in the sauce. It was positively delicious.

The exact recipe was far too sweet for me, so I split the amount of tomatoes in half and added 3/4 lb mushrooms. that helped cut the sweetness. I had to use anise, since my S.O. is allergic to onions. Also, the original recipe was a tad salty. I found adding a very small pinch of Better than Bullion helped perk it up a bit without making it too salty.

I have completely fallen in love with this dish. Cannot believe how sweet and flavorful the tomatoes were, even in the off season! Tempted to throw in some Kalamata olives next time to make it even more delicious.

Delicious, simple and easy. There is something so satisfying about roasting tomatoes and transforming them into what gives this dish such great depth. This comes together quickly and is made up of pretty simple ingredients, so it's great for weeknights.

Made this on election night with 2 minor changes... No parsley because I'm not a huge fan and I added 2 cloves of minced garlic with the shallots. So delish and easy. Served it with quinoa. Obama 2012!!!!!

This was soooo good! I made speghetti squash tossed with garlic, and paired it with the chicken. The chicken was very moist.

Fairly quick and easy recipe, but much too much oil. Next time I would cut nearly half the oil and maybe supplement with some chicken broth or white wine in the final stages.

As beautiful a dish as it is tasty, loved by my entire family on a Thursday night (and we almost never eat skinless, boneless chicken breats). So good!

This was WONDERFUL!! So colorful on the plate and rich tasting with the tomatoes. Definitely liked the Worcestershire, but only used one tablespoon of herbs.

My daughter picked this recipe as the first real meal that we cooked together. It came out fabulous! Everyone in the family loved it. It has become a favorite meal.

Mediocre - not great, not terrible. Not good enough to make again, for sure. The flavors didn't meld and weren't very striking. It was just chicken, tomatoes and some pan juice to me. Disappointing, as I went to a fair amount of trouble to find tarragon and make my own herbs de Provence and was expecting to be delighted.

Very easy to make and delicious! I seasoned chicken and tomatoes w/o measuring salt quantities and I cooked the chicken in the pan, covered because I wanted to cook faster.

I made this recipe the other night for my husband and I and we both absolutely loved it! I used smaller Burpee tomatoes and they were perfect (sweet and super falvorful!). Like other reviewers, I used a little less herbes de Provence than the recipe called for. I served it over white rice, and it was delicious! This will definitely be included in the recipe rotation. Oh and the presentation was really nice, I'll definitely be making this for dinner guests as well :)

Really enjoyed this recipe. Like other reviewers, I too used a blend of our late season heirlooms and fresh herbs. I substituted sherry vinegar to finish the sauce and the flavor was fabulous.

My husband who doesn't like 'bird' really likes this. We don't have garden tomatoes in Texas at this time - too hot. I used whole tomatoes and it worked fine...the oil can be cut. Used other herbs the first time and that was fine too.

This is just OK. Cut the herbes de Provence down to 1 tablespoon, as suggested by some reviews. What is the point of the Worcestershire? I used less than called for, but would leave it out, completely. As some reviewers suggested, I would cut the oven roasting time WAY down-felt it was a waste, using beautiful little tomatoes from my garden-could just as well have been store bought toms. Basil as a substitute for tarragon? I don't think so. I'm sure it tastes fine, using basil, but it's not the same, at all-you've just changed the dish.

Rating: 2
The tomatoes are delicious, and can go with any grilled or broiled chicken. The chicken itself is so plain. The flavors do not meld--you just have very plain chicken with a yummy tomato side.

Follow the recipe as written. Not bad but definitely not great. Two tablespoons of herbes de Provence is way too much in this recipe, one tbsp would probably be more than enough. I liked the tarragon in this dish and wouldn't replace it with basil as suggested in some reviews.

Rating: 3
My husband loved this. I enjoyed it, but glad I put it over rotini pasta and saved some pasta water to give the sauce more heft. Did feel it was a waste to use fabulous cherry tomatoes this summer. I would be more likely to make it in off season. Agree with reviewer that basil was much better substitute for tarragon.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and so easy, it will become a staple for weeknight dinners. I used garlic as I did not have shallots, after all. Also, I think some black olives may have been yummy. Next time I'll increase the tomatoes since they would make a nice light lunch.

Rating: 4
OK, this was absolutely delicious and a must-make dish particularly in August when tomatoes are at their peak. I substituted with heirloom tomatoes and quartered them. The juice was so delicious, think the worcestershire sauce actually took away from the dish. Next time, reserve the juices to deglaze the pan and you can probably skip the vinegar. The natural juices of the tomatoes + herbs make this outstanding alone.

Really quite delicious! Did little if anything to alter this meal (altho I never measure anything, just eyeball stuff) and it turned out great! will definitely make again for guests or something. Super easy, super quick, no fuss, no mess.Lots of garden tomatoes!

This was delicious. I didn't have as much sauce as the picture suggests but that was not a problem. The only thing I did different was use red wine instead of red wine vinegar.

I did not have an herbes de Provence, but just used others and it came out delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.

I used onion instead of shallot, red wine instead of the vinegar and added kalamata olives and garlic. Didn't have tarragon so used basil instead.....was excellent! Will make again for sure.

I loved this. I like herbes de Provence, so I knew this would be a winner. I made this mostly to recipe, but did make a few changes. I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry and I liked the texture of the small ones. I am not inclined to use any bigger size next time. I did increase the roasting time for the tomatoes in the oven to 20 min. Next time I will stir the fresh herbs into the sauce right before serving rather than topping with them. That way they will maintain their strong flavour, but soften slightly. I think it would make for a better texture. I will add a touch of red wine next time, as well. As I finished the sauce, I did add a bit of thickener to the sauce. Additionally, I pressed down a bit on the tomatoes to help them release their juice and soften. Good dish, pretty easy.

This dish was delish!! I had to omit the savory, basil and fennel seed from the Herbs de Province, (cause I didn't have them) and made it with the rest, was still so good! My family who is extremely picky with food went nuts over it and finished all that I made.

Rating: 3
This was great. It didn't take too long but it did generate plenty of dishes. I used full sized tomatoes form my garden along with a few heirloom cherry tomatoes. This gave it different colors and textures. I also used basil instead of tarragon, I think we all agree now that basil is good here.

Rating: 3
Would agree about reducing the Herbs de Provence. I also added some red wine to the pan to increase the amount of sauce. All in quite tasty.

This recipe is similar to one I do with a cut-up bone-in chicken, but this recipe takes less cooking time. All-in-all, a simple, tasty dish. I would have preferred the sauce with a bit more liquid in it by adding a bit of chicken stock to the finished sauce, and rather than garnishing the dish with the fresh herbs, would incorporate them into the sauce itself at the last minute. Had fresh tarragon and parsley on hand, but other soft, fresh herbs (i.e. basil)could be substituted.

Rating: 4
Loved this dish! Made as written with the exception of using basil my instead of tarragon and I did decrease the herbes de Provence to a little over 1 TBSP per other reviewers suggestions. I used mostly cherry tomatoes (out of the garden) but added grape tomatoes and few quartered Campari tomatoes that I also had to make up the 1 1/2 pounds. The sauce cooked perfectly in 15 minutes. I was skeptical about the Worcestershire, but it's only a little bit and it added nice depth to the sauce. Served the dish over rice. Husband raved. It's quick and easy but also company-worthy. A great use of summer tomatoes!!

Wowwww...This was SOOOO GOOD and easy to make! I wanted to eat it all! My 4 yr old is the pickiest eater, and after talking her into a bite, she loved it! I only used a little over a tablespoon of herbes de provence and that was enough. Will DEFINITELY make this again.

I had to make a few substitutions based on what I had in the cupboard. Still, this came out so well, served over savory mashed potatoes. My husband fell in love with me a little extra at the dinner table.

Made the recipe as written, with cherry tomatoes, flat-leafed parsley and tarragon picked from the garden minutes ahead of time. Excellent in every respect. We no longer use regular supermarket chicken breasts as they are tasteless, but get organic chicken from Wegman's or similar quality stores. Served this on farfalle, slightly al dente. Would absolutely not serve this with parmesan - it would detract from the incredible freshness of the roasted tomatoes and fresh tarragon garnish.

Even though I reduced the herbes de Provence to 1 tablespoon, we found the rosemary too strong. We liked the roasted tomatoes so I might try the recipe again with different herbs. We used about half the tomatoes with the chicken, and we have leftovers to serve over pasta.

I was really impressed with the ease of this recipe compared to the resulting delicious meal. My guests raved about it and all said that they would be trying this on their own. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used slightly more chicken than the recipe called for (1.5 lbs total) and substituted chicken strips for breasts. The thinner chicken strips cooked for 2.5 minutes on each side on the stove top, then I put them in the oven for 6 minutes at 400 so they wouldn't be overcooked. They came out perfectly done. I also used a large shallot rather than a small one, and added garlic to that saute mix at the end. I think it was a nice touch, and was frankly surprised that it wasn't included in the recipe as written. Would definitely recommend this if you're looking for an easy, inexpensive dinner that will make a great impression on your guests!

Next time we make this we will remove half the roasted tomatoes after 5 minutes of roasting time. Set them aside and add to sauce at the end. Because... After 15 minutes they were too soft and all turned to sauce so it did not look like the picture. It was delicious even though it wasn't pretty. Also two tablespoons of Herbs de Provence seemed a little heavy. Could have made it with one tablespoon.

Yummy weeknight dinner - quick and easy. If I make it again I would decrease the oil, since I'm using a non-stick pan, and I would sieve the sauce to remove the tomato skins. Otherwise great!

Everything about this recipe worked, but those boring, tasteless chicken breasts are banned from my kitchen. Try duck breasts smoked/grilled on the BBQ, then cook your pan sauce with duck fat. Also, deglazing your pan with vinegar? Dry white wine please. A little grated Romano atop the dish also is a plus.

We have an abundance of tomatoes from my husband's garden, this was a perfect way to use them. Followed the recipe as written. Served with a potato galette, fresh baked rustic loaf of bread, and rapini. All the kids ate it, but the teen aged daughter loved it.

Wow was this was good! Definitely a keeper. I used herbes de Provence with lavender since that's the only variety my market carries, but it was still delicious. Served with crusty bread but it was a little hard to soak up the broth. Next time, will serve it over orzo or quinoa. And there will be a next time!

I really enjoyed this recipe, the best part being the sauce. I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand so I used rice wine vinegar instead. I cooked green beans in the pan I used for the tomatoes as a side and I thought it went perfectly with this dish. The only thing missing was some good bread. Fantastic recipe.

Made this for a casual dinner for guests. Easy, healthy and full of flavor. Very little prep and doesn't take too long to cook. Served with parmesan mashed potatoes. Tasted even better the next day. Could probably use basil if you don't have tarragon on hand.
