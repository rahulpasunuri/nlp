Not enough apples for my tast, I made the pie in a non stick pie form, it browned way too quickly, even after I protected the rim. you cannot eat it alone, you have to have ice cream or whipped cream to make palatable

Apart from the crust browning too quickly, it was delicious. I prefer more cinammon so I upped that. I adapted the crust to suit a gluten-free diet and it worked quite well. Will make again.

The first time I made this as written and found that the apples had very little flavor and tasted more like pears. The second time I used Cortland apples and it was much better!

I've made this several times and love it! I think the honey crust really makes the tart, adding extra flavor that compliments the apples. The recipe made a little too much streusal topping and the first time it didn't brown completely, but since then I've used less and it was perfect.

Pretty good tart. I would definitely serve it with ice cream and add more lemon zest next time. I also had to bake mine about 10 more minutes for the top to be slightly browned.

Good tart, and everyone liked it. I can't say it's my favorite, but there is a lot to like here.

Pretty good. Was a hit with guests, very visually appealing. Yes, peel the apples. I also added some more spice to this, upped the cinnamon, added allspice, and decreased the lemon. The honey crust was great and I definitely would use over plain crust any day.

There are easier apple tart recipes out there that taste just as good. I'm happy to invest effort if it pays off, but this tasted like an Entenmann's Strudel. Life is too short!

I couldn't think of a way to ask this. I notice the recipe dowesn't call ofr peeling the apples, is that just assumed that the apple needs to be peeled before grating? Thanks, MN

I almost didn't try this recipe, thinking that it was just too complex and time -consuming. First, there was the matter of the crust -- ALL those things I don't usually put in crust. However, the crust was not only highly manageable, behaving well and forming beautifully; it was delicious. I substituted Granny Smith apples for the ones suggested. I prefer a tart apple. I also increased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. and added freshly-grated nutmeg (about 1/4 tsp) to the filling. In addition, I increased the lemon zest by a good, healthy "pinch." The result was great. I don't own a tart pan, so I put the crust into a deep 10" ceramic pie dish. The crust WILL brown almost instantly. I covered the crust edge with aluminum foil, but not before it was almost too late. In spite of a browner-than-desired crust, the dessert was lovely, and I'm going to serve it to my family at Christmas. Loved it.

I made this just as stated and it was yummy!! It did take a few more minutes of baking time and I might try the suggested added spices next time also.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a lovely alternative to pie. The streusel didn't brown a lot, but it was cooked through and tasted great. It was the first leftover to be finished off the next day!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving dinner and it was the hit of the desert line. I thought the grated apples really absorbed the flavors well, but my sister thought the texture seemed a little strange. I would definitely recommend serving this with nutmeg ice cream (1 quart vanilla ice cream, softened, with 1 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg). The flavors really complimented each other, and I didn't need to alter the recipe. I've already had requests to make it again for Christmas... yummy!

THis tart was a nice change. Not too sweet. I followed the recipe faithfully and it turned out perfectly. The crust was browner (maybe because of the honey?) but not burnt. I'll make this again with some of the enhancements suggested by others (nutmeg, lemon zest).

Excellent twist on an apple tart. I added, as suggested, 1/2 tsp. lemon rind to crust, increased cinnamon in filling to 1/2 tsp. and added a dash of nutmeg. Everyone loved this recipe.

The cooking time on this seemed off. The crust was hard and dry and the streusal wasn't even browned yet. I wouldn't make it again.

Everybody in the staff roomed raved about it! Totally a keeper.

I made this for our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner and not a crumb was left over. What a great switch up from a regular apple pie. I did everything like the recipe said only I added 1/2 tsp of lemon rind in the crust. DELICIOUS!!!

Very good. I did add fresh grated nutmeg - just my standard apple pie spices. To prevent the browning, you have to make a tin foil collar to go around the tart pan. Take it off at the end to allow some browning.

I liked this tart but I think the filling needs more spice. If I made it again, I would increase the amount of cinnamon and possibly add some nutmeg. I might also use some brown sugar in place of white to add more flavor. Also, while I liked the crust, I felt it baked too fast (it started to brown) and I had to take it out of the oven before the recommended baking time. Any tips on preventing this?

The crust is great--tastes like graham crackers. Not sure about the shredded apple filling however, might slice apples next time. erinskitchen.blogspot.com
