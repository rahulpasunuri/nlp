The beans and rice portion of this recipe are easy and tasty. The salsa left a lot to be desired. I think perhaps the limes I used were unusually sour, which left the salsa very bitter and inedible. I was glad I had several store bought jars of salsa on hand to use instead, as I threw out the whole batch of fresh salsa, even after trying to doctor it up. I will probably not make this again, as it is pretty much just plain old rice and beans. If you do attempt it, beware the tartness of the fruit you are using!

We made the recipe with no changes and quite enjoyed it. It makes an attractive presentation and it is a very fun combination of tastes and textures.

We thought it was great as an entre or side with fish or chicken. Made as per recipe. To all those that insist on reviewing when they change the recipe in this case Cook NYC please don't.It's ridiculous when you substitute and then complain go somewhere else.

What makes this recipe is definitely the jalepeno-ginger salsa. I like the suggestion of topping with an egg. This is a great meatless entre.

We were really pleasantly surprised by this! I only used one jalapeno (we usually tone down the spice) and the salsa initially seemed way too spicy. But a big dollop mixed in with the rest of the bowl added a delicious brightness and tang. I think the 2 peppers would have been just fine. The ginger was a stroke of genius! This is going into our regular rotation.

Really delicious. I halved the recipe for two servings and only made substitutions that the pantry dictated. Used diluted chicken broth and pickled jalapenos that I rinsed off. I probably used a bit more coriander and cumin than the recipe called for. The fresh cilantro and lime really wake this recipe up.

Made this last night and it was quite good. Only changes I made were to use quinoa instead of brown rice and I added a poached egg on top...because why not? It was filling, flavorful, and no bite was ever boring. I gave it 3 forks because it wasn't mind blowingly awesome but I will absolutely make it again.
