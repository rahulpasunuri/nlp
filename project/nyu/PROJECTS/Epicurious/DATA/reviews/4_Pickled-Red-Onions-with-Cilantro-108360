Super easy, very tasty. I made them a week ahead and they were a great compliment to the grilled steaks with red chili sauce. Yummy on their own, too.

this was a super quick and easy way to jazz up some bbq chicken sandwiches. we ended up cooking the onions down for a while longer, because the sandwiches weren't ready to assemble, but they tasted great and I would probably cook them down next time too. My only change would be to go light on the cilantro -the onions are delicious on their own and really fragrant cilantro can overwhelm the other flavors.

Went great with a grill smoked pork loin.

Fabulous with the Grilled Steaks with Red Chile Sauce. Even people at the BBQ were eating the onions by themselves and raving about them. Different and very tasty. Will definitely make again.

This is a keeper. I did make one change -- I cooked the onions in the vinegar/sugar until they were soft. Makes a great topping for burgers too.

cebollas en escabeche. Don't usually add cilantro, but why not?
