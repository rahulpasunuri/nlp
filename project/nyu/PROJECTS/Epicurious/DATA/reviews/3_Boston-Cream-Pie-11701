I've made this for years. Do NOT add the water to the chocolate for the glaze. It ruins it.

I wish I would have read all the reviews before making this. jmlandon is correct in her assessment of this recipe: the cake was heavy, the filling was too thick and pasty. Also, the glaze was far too bitter. I used a high quality chocolate (Scharffen-Berger) and am disappointed I wasted it on this recipe. The vanilla pod was also expensive and wasted on this recipe. Very disappointed.

I have made this recipe several times. I found that the cake was light, tender, and moist, with beautiful flecks of vanilla. This cake was served at gatherings and was always very well received with people requesting the recipe.

I felt weak in the knees when I took my first bite of this incredible dessert! It is appealing to the eye, and extremely satisfying to the palate. I recommend that the recipe is followed exactly, in order to achieve the most delightful dessert.

color me stupid. Tried this for the last 5 count 'em 5 years....must be me, doing something wrong....relatives said, it's too heavy...finally my boyfriend, who I diligently tried again and again and again to do this for his bday.....said...did you read the reviews...hm...ok then, moving on, have a new recipe and won't attempt this again...to think of the money I wasted on vanilla beans!!!!

I consider myself to be a skilled baker, and nothing about this cake was right. The cake itself, as reported, was heavy, sank in the middle and had an unpleasant taste. The filling was pasty and too thick. Fortunately, I had already identified a disaster, didn't make the glaze and saved my Callebaut chocolate for another occasion. Here was my mistake. I was in a hurry and didn't read the reviews. I won't make that mistake again!

Lame-o dessert. I completely agree with most of the negative reviews. I use a box mix (shh!!)--butter cake, add some vanilla. This is not the best custard or glaze; you can pretty much piecemeal this together using your fave vanilla custard and chocolate glaze recipes. DON'T use a springform pan, just 2 8" or 9" straight-side cake pan. Also, I like to slightly undercook the cake to prevent dryness.

Definately NOT my favorite recipe.

I'm not sure why folks had a problem, this cake turned out great for me. It was fairly easy to make and put together and all worked well.

only tried to make this once... was very disappointed. maybe because my mother used to make it so well, maybe cause i expected more. Was iffy on spring form pan before i started but went with anyway. cake turned out until it cooled. at which point it sank into itself to bottom of pan.. and was raw on outsides. should have stuck to 2 9 in pans and leveling bottom.... live and learn by trial and error i guess. :)

Boston Cream Pie is my Mom's favorite. I made it this year following this recipe since I couldn't locate the usual & we were all a more than a little disappointed. The cake was very over cooked to the point of tasting more like a biscuit-type cake & the bittersweet chocolate was a little to bitter on the otherwise mellow & not overly sweet desert. The custard FINALLY turned out after whisking myself into a newly oversized bicep & out of some texture ruining lumps. Not impressed. But! I have eaten worse

50-55 minutes was too long, and my oven usually cooks slower than most. The cake was done at 45 minutes when I checked and probably should have come out sooner. Next time, I'll watch more carefully and will use high quality vanilla extract rather than the bean. The vanilla seeds spoiled the texture of the custard.

I consider myself to be an experienced baker, although this was my first attempt at a boston cream pie. I was skeptical about the directions for preparing the custard since most recipes require that you reserve the eggs until the end of the cooking process but I followed the directions anyway and was not suprised when my custard was filled with tiny lumps of egg at the end of the process. I remade the custard using a recipe from marthastewart.com and was not disappointed. I also followed previous viewers lead in using 8 oz. semi-sweet choc. chips and 1 C. cream to make the glaze- yummy!

I've made alot of desserts from this sight and this one just wasn't fantastic. It tasted fine but I just expected great. The cake was blah. I used semi sweet choc for the glaze but still the whole thing packed no punch. We were disapointed.

very good - not difficult to make

Like a few other reviewers, I had a lot of trouble with the cake itself falling. So like them, I ended up making 2 cakes and sort of just cutting off the tops to make them even. Other than that it was a good, tasty cake overall. I would make this again but just use another white cake recipe. Note: The chocolate glaze was no overly sweet, which half of my guests liked, and half did not. LATER: I used a recipe for this from MarthaStewart.com and liked it MUCH more (which I normally would not admit...LOL)

I'm no pro baker and I thought this recipe was easy and it turned out beautifully. I used chocolate chips instead of the bittersweet because I made it for my Great Grandmother who has a sweeter tooth than most.

We loved it, with 5 boys in the house, all in love with Boston Cream pie, this was the best! Most recipies always have either cake mix, or pudding mix,this was all from scratch, which I love. The custard came out thick and flavorful, the cake was moist and the topping was a perfect bittersweet. Also, brought it to a couple of different parties, it was gone in seconds!! Thank you!

Cake was delicious, my two gluttons gobbled it up for dessert and breakfast. I was lucky to get a slice. I used plain old chocolate chips, omitted the salt, and used half and half for the water. Glaze was nice and fudgy. Next time I will make a sheet genoise, split it, fill with the custard and cut into petit fours and ice with the glaze. will be nice for Christmas party.

My review is quite different--I really liked the cake; I thought it was moist and flavorful! I found the custard a bit disappointing, but may have been satisfied if I had used 1.5 to 2x that suggested in the recipe. Chose a different glaze because I'm not fond of corn syrup.

Rating: 2
OK, but not great. I would rather make a good yellow cake recipe and a good custard. I used 1/2C cream and 1C semisweet morsels for the glaze. The cake seemed heavy and flat, even with the cake flour. It was good but I wouldn't make it again.

I am not an amature baker...have attempted more complicated recipe from Epicurious with success, but this one didn't turn out right, especially the custard part. I followed the recipe but was rewarded with gluey custard, I think too much corn starch was called for.

I was only loooking for a superb custard filling to enhance a chocolate cake with a butter cream topping.The custard is fantastic! I used a high-quality vanilla in lieu of the bean. Can't comment on the rest of the recipe, but I know Boston Cream can be tricky and disappointing.

I was very dissapointed with the glaze.Dont waste your money on the best chocolate like I did. It was far to bitter and I also dont think it should have so much salt in the glaze.

I really liked this cake. I was uncertain about the glaze because of some of the review comments, so I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet, and just ordinary Baker's chocolate at that -- nothing fancy. I finished making the cake about an hour before we ate it, so the glaze was still a little runny. I would suggest letting it sit for longer before serving it. It was totally different the next day, sitting in the fridge overnight. The glaze had became thick and fudgy. I really enjoyed the cake both ways.

I found this cake to be absolutely perfect. The cake was moist and rich, the custard was creamy and full of vanilla flavor, and the glaze was just bitter enough to cut the richness and sweetness just a bit. It tastes completely different after being refrigerated, but still delicious. I have made this cake three times, but since it is so labor-intensive, I only make it for special occasions.

The only decent thing about this cake was the custard. I liked the flavoe of the yellow cake although it was dry. The glaze was awful! I bought an expensive bar of chocolate ($9.00) and it was wasted. I LOVE dark chocolate but that glaze was straight bitter. Big disappointment. I will use the custard for other recipes though.

This recipe was a lot of work, and I'm not sure it was worth all the time. The cake tasted great when it was still warm(a little piece broke off which I sampled) but it seemed to get dense and dry sitting in the fridge. I used my own bittersweet chocolate glaze recipe after reading previous reviews for this glaze. The custard was the best part, very creamy and full of vanilla flavor from the vanilla bean. And thanks to a previous reviewer for the tip about slicing the layers using dental floss; it worked like a charm. Overall though, I was expecting more from this recipe.

Rating: 2
The cake was dense and not very "soft". I should have guessed this, given that the recipe has too few eggs and not even a touch of melted butter or oil. Otherwise, I liked the custard and the chocolate glaze. I used Valrhona chocolate though --so it couldn't taste bad.

This was a delicious dessert. I made a different frosting, though. I used 1 cup of heavy cream and 8 oz of semisweet choc. cooked for about 12 minutes. I let this cool and poured of cake. It was great.

Excellent cake! However, after reading the previous reviews I didn't use their glaze, but...ahem...Hershey's syrup. (that's what I used on the first Boston cream pie I ever baked...waaay back in college:-) It was very good.

The cake was very moist, almost too much because it was a bit difficult to handle. The custard was delicious!! I found a Tahitian vanilla bean which gave it great flavor. I would recommend using a different chocolate glaze, several people scraped it off because it was too bitter (I followed the instructions exactly). I will definitely make this again, using a different glaze.

I had trouble with the cake collapsing in the middle and had to make a second cake. Then I used the bottoms of both cakes for the layers. It turned out fine, but I don't know why both cakes fell and cooked faster in the middle.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe and a great hit at my brunch. The only reason I did not give it 4 forks is because I did not like the glaze. I actually threw it out and made a chocolate glaze with 9 oz chocolate, 1 cup heavy cream, and a Tb of Grand Marnier. Also, substitute 1 to 1 1/4 ts vanilla if you can't find any beans.

Mmmmmm. Truly yummy. I used regular flour and the cake was a tiny bit dense, but nothing to fret over. Otherwise, I recommend a raspberry garnish -- they go great with the bittersweet glaze.

I made this cake on Christmas and served it well-chilled. It was as heavy and dense as could be. The next day I nuked a slice to take the chill off, and the results were much better. I could not find cake flour, so I substituted all-purpose flour (my cookbook recommends substituting 1 cup cake flour with 1 cup minus 2 Tb. all-purpose). Perhaps that was part of the density problem.

To quote my husband, "This rules!" I have one other recipe for Boston Cream Pie, and this version is clearly superb. Instead of using a long serrated knife to halve the cake, I would recommend using a long piece of thread or dental floss. In one easy swipe the cake is cut all the way through.

I definitely would make this again! It got great revies by everyone to whom I served it. To make it easier/faster to make, I used instant vanilla pudding for the custard. That way it was cool and ready when the cake was cooled, while I made the glaze! It is a great treat for a special dinner.
