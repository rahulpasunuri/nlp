Used good quality beef bones. Although it was interesting, I won't be making it again. I'm not put off by the fatty gelatinous qualities, but the flavor didn't wow me. It was actually quite mild with a sea water smell. Parsley salad is a must to cut through the thick fattiness. Drink something fizzy or hot to wash it down.
