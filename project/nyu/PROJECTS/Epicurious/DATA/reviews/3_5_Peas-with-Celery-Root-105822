I am a huge pea fan and this is delicious. I served this at a Thanksgiving style dinner party and it was very popular. The celery root is a nice surprise. I will definitely make this again.

This has been a part of our Thanksgiving dinner every year since it was published

Remarkably tasty! Simple. Nice addition to a Thanksgiving meal filled with casseroles. Successfully substituted celery seed. No additional salt or pepper needed.

searching for the unusual for our first Vegetarian thanksgiving, this was well liked by our Romanian American friends.

I made this along with turkey dinner. Added a half a small acorn squash, steamed. Made a nice color combination. Everyone was raving about the taste of cerey root. Very flavorful.

This dish was, surprisingly, one of my family's favorites at this year's Thanksgiving dinner. I thought that the subtle scent and flavor of the celeriac came through nicely and added a nice contrast to the buttery peas and shallots. For a family who seems to subsist on only meat and potatoes at holidays, sneaking this one in resulted in success.

The celeriac had little impact on the overall flavor of this dish. Given that the preparation of the celeriac was time-consuming and we made it for Thanksgiving when we're plenty busy with food prep already, we would not make this recipe again.
