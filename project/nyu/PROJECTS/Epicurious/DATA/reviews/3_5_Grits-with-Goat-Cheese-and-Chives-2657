I love all of the ingredients, grits, goat cheese, broth and chives. But put them all together, it must be an acquired taste. Maybe these grits would have worked better as a dinner side rather than with breakfast. If it were not for all of the 4 fork ratings I would have given it a 1 fork.

Nice 'n easy. For me, the chevre wasn't overwhelming at all, so if you like its flavor, don't hold back in this recipe.

I make this every year for a Christmas breakfast. I'm always asked if I'm going to make it. It silenced the grits mockers.

My brother, who was a wonderful cook,first made this for our family Christmas dinner in 1992. We have eaten it every Christmas since then. Everyone, even people who think they don't like grits, loves this. Make extra, and the next day slice, saute in butter, and top with a fried egg. Yum!

I found this recipe while looking for a shrimp and grits recipe. I had on hand goat cheese, fresh chives, grits, shrimp and fresh lime. This grits recipe is great! Take it from a true Southerner. Add shrimp sauteed in butter,lime juice and hot red pepper flakes and you have a real winner. Better than any shrimp and grits I've had in the local restaurants!

I've made this dish three times this month already. The last time I made it was for a brunch and everyone liked it so much, they asked for the recipe.

We made this according to the recipe. We found the goat cheese scent to be overpowering and a definite detractor. Note: we love goat cheese in just about everything else. Regular old cheddar cheese grits are better and more cost-effective.

Very easy and quick. Didn't have enough chicken broth so i substituted with some whipping cream and water. Served as a side with pork chops in pear sauce and cauliflower.

I am a true grits fan. Naturally, I thought it was delicius. My wife and oldest daughter, however, are not big fans of grits. They absolutely raved about it. This dish goes well with any red meat. Substiute for rice or potatoes for a real treat!

We made these and substituted them for the grits in the 'Folly Island Shrimp and Grits' recipe. Yum.
