This is a good recipe that you could modify according to your tastes. I used Earl Grey tea (didn't have lapsang souchong) and it was really tasty. I found it a bit on the sweet side, even though I used Lindt 70% baking chocolate, which isn't very sweet at all. Next time I would reduce the sugar by at least 1/3. Texture was great, mine took a little longer to cook but they were bigger (I only made 6). I baked in jam jars in a water bath, so rather than covering with plastic to cook them, which I thought was a bit dodgy, I just put the lids on and it worked great.

The taste is amazing, but I found mistakes in the recipe. Cover with plastic wrap? Hello, plastic wrap melts in the oven (and it stinks; I tried it)!!! I checked Joy of Cooking and it should be covered tightly in aluminum foil; that works great. I also found that 300 degrees is not enough; mine were still runny after 55 minutes. Joy of Cooking says 350 degrees for 35 minutes. So I split the difference and did 325 for 40 minutes...it worked well.

This was my first time making a custard. It turned out decent, not too sweet in a good way, nice flavors from the tea. I used earl grey. My bf liked it.

The smoked tea and chocolate are a great combination. I gave it only two forks because of the way the recipe was written...At the end it tells you to fill the ramekins and then cover with plastic wrap before putting into the oven! There is no way plastic wrap is going to survive a 300 degree oven. I tried it on one of mine and what a disaster.

Fantastic dessert. I will add extra tea next time, I love lapsong suchong and although I thought they were amazing, didn't really taste the tea as much as I expected. Worth the effort though!

Great texture and flavor. Very rich, small portions are adequate. Next time I would try Earl Grey tea for a different flavor. Worth the time and effort.
