I found this very blah, even after increasing spices and tahini. Ended up throwing most of it away.

Isn't this the recipe from Josie's exactly? I don't believe these are the authors listed in the book Totallu Dairy-Free Cooking cookbook.

Fantastic recipe! It's very easy to prepare and I receive compliments every time I make it. It's one of my staples for entertaining.

Great recipe! It's easy to make and delicious. You can add to or reduce the amount of spices depending on your preference. I've made it twice and since it can be made ahead and stored it's a great side for entertaining.

Would most likely be reluctant to make this again. Needed much more spice and the recipe should indicate toasted/roasted tahini.

Everyone loved it especially my daughter the nutritionist. She's always looking for delicious ways to prepare vegetables containing carotinoids. This one made the cut.
