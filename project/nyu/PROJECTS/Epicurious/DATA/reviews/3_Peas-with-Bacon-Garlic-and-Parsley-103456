Excellent and easy to make side dish. The guests loved it. A little oily though.

Perfect for a simple dinner with cheesy mashed potatoes on the side and perhaps a few grilled tomatoes or mushrooms.

I made these peas to go with a Tuscan dinner. I ate peas with bacon all over Tuscanny. Unfortunately the ones in Tuscany were canned and cooked grey with wiggly boiled looking bacon. These peas on the other hand were delicious! Bright green peas with crispy bacon and fresh herbs. Wonderful!

An excellent dish that inspired a lot of grins and giggles from family and chef. We had recently learned that peas and bacon were the detested staple diet of World War I German submariners, and were amused to discover that good things could be done with that combination. We've decided to call it Peas Miedtank, in honor of the sensitive, put-upon cook of one of those early subs.

not a bad recipe, i suppose, but my family was not impressed.

We fixed this for a dinner party of 10, and it was universally enjoyed by all. Quick to fix, and has a great appearance.

I think this is a nice side dish, pretty flavorful. I have made it several times with veal, pot roast and chicken,

This was an easy way to dress up some left over peas. The flavors weren't as strong as I had hoped and seemed a little mild. I think my husband liked it better than me. I might go a little heavier on everything next time. I had halved the recipe since I was using about half the amount of peas. I will definately give it another try.

This was a tasty pea dish. I used fresh mint instead of parsley, which gave it a sweet, fresh from the garden taste. I also used peas with pearl onions, which I think added to the flavor. Seeing as Kimberley didn't use half of the ingredients, (DUH), no wonder it didn't turn out as well as she might have hoped. I would definitely make it again.

Great way to jazz up peas. Did bacon day ahead so it made it a quick side dish. People raved about it. I included all ingredients.

Nothing wrong with the recipe, it just didn't wow me. Although, I forgot to add the parsley & decided not to add the roasted garlic because I had made roasted garlic mashed potatoes. I thought that roasted garlic in everything could be overpowering. So, with that in mind, perhaps my alterations had a negative impact on my results.

Quick, easy way to dress up veggies. (Will try with green beans and corn.)
