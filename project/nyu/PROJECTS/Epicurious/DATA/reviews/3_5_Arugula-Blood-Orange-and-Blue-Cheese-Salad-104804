I made this recipe without any substitutions or changes. We used the very best ingredients, but still felt that there was something missing. Next time I will add some toasted pine nuts for texture and depth of flavor.

Blood oranges are best in late winter...Jan thru April. Arugula on the other hand is sweetest in the summer. Thus, I substituted Mache and it came out really lovely. This is a simple and refreshing salad with red meat.

So yummy! This salad was a perfect balance of fresh flavors! Make sure you serve it right away, though. I made it for when I thought my boyfriend would be home, but by the time we ate it (about an hour and a half later) it was a little soggy.

Absolutely perfect combination of flavors! Used all organic produce and a Spanish blue cheese--it was so good, we're having it again tonight! An ideal starter for a meaty main course.

I think the recent reviews were positively uninspiring but I thought that I would try it. I used the freshest Argula, Best Blue Cheese and a very ripe blood orange. My it was very good! Just use (like you would use all the time) the best ingredients avalible.

I fixed this for a family potluck, and it was a big hit! The flavors of the blue cheese, the arugula and the blood oranges along with the tang of the lemon are wonderful together. I will definitely make this again!

This a wonderful treat if you make sure you use very ripe, very sweet blood oranges. I lucked out in that department, so the flavor combination was excellent (sweet and tart/tangy) and a hit with my guests. I lightly coated the greens in olive oil, then squeezed fresh lemon and added salt and pepper to taste. Mmmm... just don't forget to be picky about your blood oranges! The sweeter the better!

I agree with the reviewer from Atlanta, I made this recipe for our "Bon Appetit" cooking club it was a big disappointment. The combination of flavors just didn't go well together and the dressing was too bland.

The flavors in this salad seemed to me a little out of whack. The tartness of the blood oranges (delicious in themselves) overwhelmed the blue cheese and arugula. I added some toasted walnuts for a little extra flavor and crunch, but I still felt something was missing. Not sure I'd make this again without some major modifications.
