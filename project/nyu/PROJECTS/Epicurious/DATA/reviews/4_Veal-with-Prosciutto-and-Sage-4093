I've been making this one for years and keep coming back to it. I've never had the meat pounded and often buy the procuitto but forget to use it. last time I made it with veal scallops and used the procuitto, but I felt like the procuitto overpowered everthing else. maybe add small pieces instead of wrapping a whole slice.

I added a variety of mushrooms to sauce. Good! Recipe was ok, I have much better veal recipes.

Outstanding! I ended up using 1-1/2 lbs. of chicken breast halves, left as is instead of pounding thin, and did not use the flour to dredge in. The sauce is fantastic and I had no problem getting it to thicken up on it's own. This one is a keeper! KIMBER

This tastes kind of like something made with a can of soup! What a waste of veal - use it for chicken instead.

THIS WAS SPECTACULAR!!! And quite easy to prepare. The only change we made was we grilled the chops instead of cooking them in olive oil. An A+++++++ for sure. Do try it!!!

The sauce is a real winner. I'll use it repeatedly on other dishes, chicken and pork. You do need to thicken it a bit with a slurry or cornstarch. Easy to prepare this sauce and it tastes elegant and decadent.

This is a great dish!!! It's reasonably easy to create and tastes like it took a lot longer to prepare. One piece of advice is add a flour and water mixture to the sauce to help thicken. Big thumbs up on this one.

The sauce is wonderful. If you boil it a little longer, it will eventually thicken. Used boneless pork loin & fried pancetta instead of veal & prosciutto. Made a "sandwich" with pancetta in the middle. Made no additions, but left out the salt.

Awesome!!! The sauce was outstanding. However, I do agree with a previous reviewer, that using a slurry to thicken the sauce is a good idea. I kept the side dishes simple: fresh green beans and boiled new red potatoes with butter salt and fresh parsley. What a great meal.

This is really a grand, subtle dish. I increased the amount of shallots a bit and added additional fresh sage leaves. I also thickened the sauce a just a little bit with a slurry. And don't strain the sauce! the fresh sage leaves add a bit of color and texture.

I use scallops of veal pounded thin for this dish and it works out great. This dish is a wonderful indulgence and I agree with the previous reviewer about the sauce. It is the best! It could definitely be used with many other dishes. Be sure to use fresh herbs if at all possible, it makes a big difference!
