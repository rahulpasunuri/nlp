These pancakes could not be simpler to make and just delicious. I didn't have pecans and they were still very good. Love mixing everything in the blender. Used butter instead of vegetable oil. The cornmeal gives a great crunch and the banana is just right. I thought all of the quantities were spot on. Even my picky one year old gobbled them up. Definitely a new favorite. Looking forward to adding the pecans next time.

Even my husband, who doesn't much care for bananas, liked these pancakes, but yes, they were a little limp and I found them hard to flip (suggestions anyone?). A few changes: I used whole wheat flour and buttermilk, and added blueberries rather than pecans.

They were good, but came out a little limp (for lack of a better word). Every once in a while you could feel the granular cornmeal, but it didn't bother me. They were fine, but nothing special and I wouldn't bother to make them again.

Boy, these were really light and flavorful. I added about 1/4 cup melted butter, which is probably what made them so good. Very nice, easy and fast recipe.

Very good! I doubled the recipe and used buttermilk instead of regular since I needed to use it up; also subbed walnuts since that's what I had on hand. Light and fluffy, though subtle on the banana flavor. Also, DO NOT use coarse ground cornmeal - it will be gritty. Use fine ground or do what I did and grind it up in the blender to make the texture finer.

Foul. These tasted like baking soda and were gritty like sand from the cornmeal.

Just got done eating them, and they turned out great. They are a nice departure from the norm, and a little allspice gives them a nice fall touch. I actually used pine nuts, and it was fine!!

I should add that I would not make them in my blender again- -it's kind of a pain. My blender is cheap, and I had better results just whisking the batter in a bowl (after I had blended the bananas in the blender). I served them for brunch to rave reviews.

These are the best banana pecan pancakes I've ever had. A true chef always adds her two cents, so I did add some vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. I used only 1 egg (because that's all i had) and added some ground flaxseed. I used 1/2 ww pastry flour, and I subbed 3/4 c milk for 3/4 cup plain yogurt plus 1/4 cup water. I doubled the recipe with great success.

Easy to make and very good. I used a very fine cornmeal meant for tamales, and the texture was light and fluffy. We didn't have maple syrup, so I dusted a little powdered sugar on top. Yum! Would make them again.

These were fabulous. Easy to make, and the family loved them. Such a treat.

Super fast and easy recipe--great mix of flavors. I used half whole wheat and half white flour and they turned out fine.

Very good pancakes; I also chopped the pecans finely to have uniform pecan flavor throughout. Adding cinnamon and nutmeg complemented the banana flavor nicely. A refreshing changes from the standard pancake.

This is a excellent pancake recipe. I used ground pecans instead of chopped and the mixture of flavors is just amazing!! Very good! This has quickly become a family favorite!!

I make a lot of pancakes and these are among our favorites. Terrific banana and cornmeal taste and the toasted pecans make this very special. I love the low-fat aspect of this recipe since these are wonderful with pure Michigan maple syrup that we make each year with friends who have a sugarbush.

I would give this a higher score for the ease of preparation but as for the taste, well, it's just ok. The kids didn't like them but I would make them again for myself and the hubby. Don't leave out the pecans!

These pancakes are really tasty and very easy to make. I don't like complicated pancake recipes, since I only make them on impulse. Most pancakes just taste like cooked flour, but these are very flavorful. I didn't have pecans, so I used toasted walnuts. My husband and I are probably pigs, but we wolfed down the 10 pancakes quite easily. I recommend doubling the recipe for more than two adults. Yum!

This recipe was great and simple. I think next time I would use a little less milk since I like thicker batter. It's the perfect recipe when you only have 1 overly ripe banana!

Rating: 4
The kids and I love this recipe because it makes fluffier pancakes than traditional cornmeal cakes. The flavors compliment each other nicely, and this is certainly quick and easy! We use fresh ground cornmeal from a mill that we visited recently. Today I felt creative and used brown sugar, added a splash of rum extract, and mini chocolate chips. I was named "The Pancake Queen" by my 5 year old!

This was good but not great -- rather heavy, I found. My main reason for making them was to use up some very ripe bananas and I would make them again in similar circumstances as my kids consider pancakes a real treat. My son didn't care for them as he doesn't like pecans (so next time I would either omit them from part of the batter or use another kind of nut) and my 4-year-old daughter also wasn't wildly enthusiastic, but my 12-year-old thought they were great. They're a nice change from regular pancakes, but I still prefer the buttermilk pancake recipe on this site.

this is the 4th pancake recipe i have tried on epicurious, and the best so far. i did add 1 T. of brown sugar as well as the white. bananas and brown sugar go so well together. no matter what recipe i try though, pancakes from scratch are never fluffy?? even so, this will make it to my personal cookbook of recipes i will make over and over. my boyfriend loves bananas!!

Tasty, fluffy, and the banana taste is delicate rather than overwhelming. It's extremely easy to make and great for when you're looking to make breakfast and have only one egg to do it with.

Light, delicious, done in an instant. Didn't use pecans the first few times. Now that I have, I won't go back! Excellent addition.

SO EASY! I just threw it in the blender and threw it on the griddle. A great recipe for leftover bananas.

So easy to make, and so delicous - perfect balance of flavor - altho 1 of my kids said it "needs more banana." Guess my banana was too small?

Very disappointing! I made these for company and was embarrassed. They were flat, chewy and bland, although the flavour improved noticeably when smothered in syrup. They were also hard to flip, maybe because there was no shortening in the recipe?!?! Definitely far from the best pancakes I've made.

I've stolen a lot of recipes from this web-site and have never taken the time to write a review about them until now. This is now the third time I've come here to get this recipe (yes, I need better organizational skills) because I love it and everyone for whom I've made it loves it too. You can't go wrong.

These pancakes are wonderful!! I've made them several times and they always come out perfect. Mind you, I'm a novice cook---so this reciepe is goofproof and definately gourmet--a quality which I strive for and appreciate.

This recipe was easy and delicious; the only change I made was to add a few additional tablespoons of milk to thin out the batter. I will definetly make this recipe again.

I'm not a lover of pancakes either. I usually find them too heavy and dry. These were neither and only needed a bit of syrup to be tasty. Also, another plus is how easy they are to make. Didn't add any nuts.

Delicious and very quick to prepare. Didn't have pecans, so used toasted almonds. Still good, but pecans have a lighter crunch and would have been better.

Wow, these were good. The recipe doubles nicely, but, then, we had leftovers because they are pretty filling.

So simple and so good. Everything just pops into a blender and is ready to cook in less than 5 minutes! A great "special" breakfast before church. I cooked in a non-stick skillet sprayed with Pam. Perfect.
