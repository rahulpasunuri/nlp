Very good! Following the other reviewers, I subbed scallion for red onion and fresh red pepper for bottled, and used a lot less olive oil than called for. Also used more olives than the recipe called for. I tasted it at the end & added raisins, which was an excellent addition and goes well with the feta, cumin, and olives. One warning: I have found with cooking spelt and farro that the recipes are almost always oversalted because of the cooking water. If you salt the water the way you would for pasta, the dish will be way too salty. I recommend being VERY conservative with the salt in the cooking water (like 1/8 tsp), and only re-season after adding your olives and feta. Raisins helped cut the over-saltiness of my first batch.

This is truly an exceptional recipe. The ratio of flavors is just about perfect. I think the cumin is a necessity, so don't skip it! Also, I do add an extra tablespoon of chopped kalamata olives. One is not quite enough for my taste. A great way to pit a lot of olives at once is to lay them out on a cutting board, cover them with a kitchen towel, and beat them with a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Remove the towel and those pits will fall right out. I hope that helps!

One of my favorite summer dishes! I use fresh chopped bell pepper instead of bottled and roasted, and scallions instead of red onion. I add half a pint of grape tomatoes (halved). Lots of flavors and textures. Mmm.

Excellent, will make again (and again...)Per suggestions, I used fresh red bell pepper and spring onions. Terrific!

This was so good! And very healthy.I made this with some spelt I got from my winter csa share. I also used fresh red pepper and I soaked the sliced red onion in some hot water for a while before putting it in the salad. this way you still get that red onion flavor but its not as strong.

Great basic & easy recipe. Followed others and used fresh red peppers instead of roasted; wish I'd used scallions instead of red onions, they are a bit overpowering. Thought it needed more freshness, so added tomatoes as well. Yum.

This is a wonderful way to introduce people to wheat berries! Delicious and easy to make.

Super, super yummy. Great to make on the weekend and take for lunch all week. Used raw red bell pepper instead of roasted, and would probably use scallions instead of red onion next time (the red onion gets a bit overpowering after sitting a little while in the salad.)

I love wheatberries for their chewy texture. I made this salad, cooked the wheatberries with cumin seeds, delicious. Served with grilled salmon, yum! On another note, please be advised that although spelt is lower in gluten than wheat, it does contain gluten so those sensitive to wheat/gluten may also react to spelt, those with celiac's must avoid spelt! A common misconception.

My husband and I love this salad. Delicious with spelt berries. I cut the olive oil down to 3 T (5 seemed like a lot) and it's absolutely wonderful.

I made this with spelt instead of wheat berries (which I love, but was entertaining someone allergic to wheat), and I subsituted pomegranate seeds for the olives. Also used fresh red peppers, per previous reviewer. Delicious.

This is a solid wheat berry salad recipe. Just the right amount of dressing... just enough veggies to keep it interesting, but a little light on the olives and cheese (but what isn't?). Sometimes I toss in some mung beans to shake things up. A good intro to healthy eating for the confirmed carnivors in your life.

So as not to skew the ratings, I have given this 4 forks based on other people's ratings. What I would like to know is, how much garlic does one use?

Rating: 4
What made this a four fork recipe to me was the ease of prep & the opportunity for experimentation. I skipped the roasted pepper & used fresh instead & felt this dish was screaming for shrimp to be added, so I did. I made 1 1/2 x the recipe & used 5 T of olive oil & no salt. I definitely think it needs the cumin & I agree with the red onion proponents. Oh yeah, I forgot to add the olives, but the shrimp gave me enough additional extra texture that it wasn't missed.

An excellent pot luck dish because it can be made ahead, kept at room temperature, and was well-received perhaps because it's both healthy and delicious. For a crowd, I successfully tripled the wheat berries and doubled additions. To save time I used bottled red peppers but I always rinse because I don't like the acidity (I prefer to roast peppers myself). I'm not a fan of tabouli; this was better.

I have made this salad multiple times; it is a great way to eat the ultra-healthy wheatberries. The cumin in the dressing is necessary. Also prefer red onions to scallions as they add much more of a tangy bite. Left out black olives b/c it seems that the salad already has enough disparate flavors.

Admittedly, I added a few other complementary ingredients to this salad: tomatoes, al dente green beans, chopped yellow peppers, and scallions (in place of the red onions). The results were delicious, with a heady variety of flavors and textures. I served this over mixed greens with no additional dressing; I put the dressing mostly over the grains (I used a 50/50 combination of wheatberries and whole barley) so it would soak in. I also used a generous amount of minced Italian parsley and fresh mint. I'd like to try this with any kind of blue cheese and walnuts, with pretty much the same other ingredients. An excellent dinner or lunch salad!

My family loves this recipe and we've made it countless times with wheat berries. My changes: Roast a whole red pepper; sweat it in a plastic bag and remove charred skin. Slice it and marinade at least 10 min. with 2-3 T olive oil, 1-2 cloves of garlic, a dash of hot pepper, salt and black pepper before mixing it with other ingredients. This marinade takes up the garlic and most of the oil, salt and peppers. If you don't have the three fresh herbs (and I rarely do) cilantro is a delicious substitute. Wait until entire salad and seasonings are mixed before adding more olive oil to taste; the red pepper marinade may be enough for your taste. Wheat berries also make beautiful short-lived house plants. Sprinkle raw berries on top of the soil and keep moist with a mister. The grass is bright green and looks good shaggy or clipped.

This is very delicious (and easy to make). Wheat berries have a fantastic texture. I added golden raisins and used fresh bell pepper instead of bottled. Also, you don't need much olive oil. Very flavorful and each forkful has a different combination of ingredients.

We love this recipe! To save fat grams, we use fat free feta(which holds together better than regular). We used wheat berries. Extremely healthy salad.
