I doubled the mushroom, it was still very light on each layer. Quadruple may be enough to notice/taste. It is super dry. It is bland, it needs some sort of acidity like a tomato sauce, or a balsamic reduction drizzle, or something. It smelled great while cooking, but that's because Parmesan toasting smells great. I would not make this again. I love butternut squash, but there are many better recipes than this one that take much less time/effort. The leftovers were thrown out, and that is not something that happens very often in this house.

My family loved this recipe. I made it exactly as written. My husband who likes neither butternut squash nor lasagna loved it. It was quite a bit of work, but it made 10 servings. It froze beautifully, and it was lovely to be able to take out enough for dinner on a night no one wanted to cook. I'm getting ready to make it again.

With a few changes, I've been making this recipe for three years to rave reviews from family and friends. I bake/mash buttercup squash every fall and store it in quart size bags in my freezer. When I make this recipe, I get two bags of squash and thin it down on the stove with vegetable or chicken stock until it's the same consistency as a tomato sauce would be for traditional lasagna. I use more herbs, one container cottage cheese and one container of ricotta. I use about 1.5 cups of onions and add garlic and white wine. I also layer 5 noodles on each layer. A fall favorite!

Rating: 1
I'm not a fan of this recipe. As others have noted, the amount of cheese is excessive. Also, it's too sweet. The butternut squash and sage make for a sweet taste that isn't off set by something tangy or tart, like tomatoes. There are better lasagna recipes out there.

I only use one tub of ricotta and added sausage and a white sauce. Tweaking the basic recipe has turned it into a terrific lasagne.

I've made this lasagna twice now. The first time I took others' advice and only used 3 15-oz containers ricotta and 3 eggs. I thought the lasagna was kind of dry and agreed that it needed more vegetables. Second time I used 3 1/2 pounds butternut squash and double the mushrooms (did not alter the herbs). These amounts were better, although I did have maybe 1/2 pound squash which simply did not fit in the lasagna pan. Also, to address the dryness I added 1-2 spoonfuls of the squash broth to each layer of the lasagna. Perfection!

Yes, way too much cheese, but we must ask the question "3 tubs". The cook is not a chef, which is a disappointment. This is a simple recipe for Lasagna. Just look it up on another site. Besides Gourmet mag. is bankrupt. Wonder why???

Rating: 2
The ratios of ingredients are off. There is way too much cheese, not enough squash or mushrooms. Could be really excellent if it were in better proportion. If I make it again, I will definitely cut the cheese mixtures in half and double the mushroom & squash mixtures.

I made this lasagna last night, along with the suggested bell pepper saute. My only changes were white mushrooms, fat-free ricotta and porcini broth. I thought it was delicious, my husband thought it was good, but would be better with sausage. Loved it with the peppers!

So disappointing, even with all the tips from reviewers: reducing ricotta, increasing mushrooms, adding garlic and wine splash. I cooked the extra mushrooms down well, but still ended up with a bland white mess. I didn't believe such a thing was possible, but the truth is it's entirely too cheesy. Even with the eggs it just didn't hold its shape. I cooked it about 15 minutes extra but suspect it needed even more cooking, more like an hour and 45 minutes. A lot of effort but it's oddly much less than the sum of its parts.

Rating: 3
I think all that ricotta made the lasagna a little dry. I was also hoping for a little more sweetness. Perhaps I'll add a touch of brown sugar the next time around. Not sure that my kids would go for this really rich dish, but I would make it again with less ricotta and more veggies. Spinach would be so fantastic, and I agree that there should be more mushrooms (and less onions)!! Great recipe though

Rating: 3
Delicious but rich, needs more veggies! Stuck to the recipe, found 3 containers ricotta WAY too much - too much cheese for the pan! Added thinly sliced zucchini - very good. Next time will eliminate 1 container ricotta and add more mushrooms and perhaps spinach.

Rating: 4
Stuck to the original recipe precisely. It's a terrific lasagna, extremely rich and autumn-y. Next time would do as other have recommended, cut the ricotta down to 2 containers. Would also increase the amount of mushrooms and squash (and, by doing that, increase the amount of herbs).

Rating: 3
The flavors in this dish were a bit too mellow for me, being a vegetarian. I added some heat with crushed red pepper, and the herbs specified took over the taste of the squash. Next time I'll cut back on those so the sweetness of the squash can come through. Otherwise, good recipe!

I made this with wide egg noodles, cooked them in the vegetable broth, omitted 3 eggs and the riccota, and it turned out pretty well. I only cooked it about 15 mins in the oven, and my carnivore husband liked it, too.

I know, I know....we all hate it when people change a recipe and then rate it, but I think the changes I made were small and the basic flavor was kept. I roasted the squash and made a puree instead of slicing it b/c it was much easier. Also, I made a bechamel sauce with fontina cheese that I layered instead of the ricotta (personal preference). First layer was white cheese sauce, then noodles, then white sauce, squash, mushrooms, mozzarella, etc. I made this as a veggie option for a holiday party and everyone loved it, including the men. I was pleasantly surprised by this dish.

Rating: 3
This is a really great dish, a nice twist on a classic. I took other reviewers suggestions and used only 2 containers of ricotta, that was more than enough. I also used some marinara on the bottom and top and that was a nice addition. You definitely have to take the squash out of the broth before adding it to the lasgana - if not it would have been a complete mess. This was pretty easy to prepare and everybody loved it.

I miss lasagna since going vegetarian this year. I thought this lasagna was great, but I would definitely add more mushroom/onion mixture and perhaps different veggies in general. I'll have fun playing with this one. I didn't use no-boil noodles, and instead let it sit overnight before baking. That takes care of any extra liquid from additional mushrooms which might make lasagna runny.

Rating: 3
I made this with only a few small changes. I used leeks instead of onions, and used 2 cups cottage cheese and 2 cups ricotta because that's what I use in traditional lasagna's. I did use a bit more parmesan to add a stronger flavor. I added no eggs into the cheese mixture and it turned out fine. This is a great alternative to a traditional lasagna.

I actually added some marinara sauce to this, a little on the bottom of the pan and enough to cover the lasagna noodles on top. Also, I used three types of squash: Italian, Yellow, and Butternut. It was absolutely wonderful, served with some garlic bread. My guest devoured it!

Intriguing and a nice flavor, but I thought it was a bit bland and needed color. It did not look like the photo. Needed more mushrooms, more squash, less ricotta and definitely a more tangy/strong cheese to add saltiness and flavor. Make a few changes and it would be much better. Also, must drain the squash, too much liquid to put in the lasagna.

We loved this! I took the advice and doubled the veggies - used less cheese, added 6 cloves of garlic. Then I assembled in two smaller lasagna pans. One for tonite and one for later. I will make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly, and thought that this was good - a nice change of pace from heav(ier) tomato-based lasagna dishes. The only possible improvement in my experience would be the addition of a more pungent cheese - something stronger than mozzarella or parmesan could stand up to the squash and mushroom flavors. Still yummy as is though!

Rating: 4
This was so so so fantastic! I did take into account the reviews, and made some modifications. I halved the ricotta and the mozzerella. I used three eggs instead of two. I roasted the butternut squash (using trader joe's precut since I made this on a week night). I used shallots instead of onions and added six cloves of garlic. I sauteed the mushrooms in white wine... Ah, for the mushrooms... Since I live in San Francisco, I have access to a wide array of mushrooms through Far West Fungi in the Ferry Building. Drawing on the expertise of the mushroom guys, I used just over a pound of the following fresh mushrooms: Candy Cap Cinnamon Cap and King Trumpets The mushrooms were amazing- cinnamon caps taste kind of like cinnamon, candy caps are pure mapley goodness, and the king trumpets are earthy with great texture. I cannot reccomend the mushroom mods highly enough. Oh, and don't forget the nutmeg. This is a new household fave. Amazing!

I made this recipe for my annual Christmas open house and everyone loved it except those who do not "love" mushrooms. It is a very unique dish and I will definitely make it again because it has impressive appeal. Some modifications I made based on other reviews: I added 4 cloves of garlic to the butter/onion mixture, I added red wine (3 times around the pan) to the mushrooms. I roasted the butternut squash in a store-bought basting oil with it's own herbs (about 45 minutes on 350). I reduced the ricotta amount to 2 1/2 (15 oz) containers and used only 2 eggs. I used an over-sized disposable lasagna pan and assembled the day before.

Rating: 3
just tried this yesterday and wanted to give some suggestions. first, everyone loved it. i would definitely modify the cheese like others have suggested. i'm glad i did. i used 3/4 of the ricotta suggested, all of the mozz and parm and two eggs (instead of four) so the ricotta would have some stability. also, it took longer for the squash to become tender (almost 25 minutes) so be aware of that if you're a stickler for prep times. i wanted to make sure there wouldn't be hard chunks of squash in the lasagna once it was baked so i made sure it was really soft and then mashed it a bit with a fork.

I made this dish for a potluck, and everyone raved. I, on the other hand, thought it was a bit dry and lacking in flavor. I think it might be nice with a squash cream sauce over the top. I must admit, though...it held together very nicely and looked just beautiful. Fun to try!

Rating: 3
I give the final dish 3 forks, but the directions 1 fork. This can be a really tasty dish, but you have to adjust the amounts - I ended up with enough for another partical pan of lasagna. You can use 2/3 of the ricotta, and I used a little bit of smoked mozzarella, which gives more depth that meat-eaters might be looking for. For flavor, the mushroom/onion mixture and the herbs are key. I used about 1.5 times more criminis than called for and then added some chopped porcini - I also added the porcini soaking liquor to the stock. This also gives the flavor more depth. Use more fresh herbs than called for, and salt liberally. When it came time to assemble, I only managed two layers of ricotta-mushroom-mozzarella (3 noodle layers) because the cheese and squash are fairly thick. Last step, I dribbled some of the squash broth over the top of everything, which helped keep things moist. In the end, very tasty, but you have to know what you're doing and think.

We really did not like this lasagna. Some guests were excited by its looks (it did look beautiful out of the oven) but after the first bite nobody touched it. I had many guests (32) so I made two of these and had to throw them out in their entirety. I think butternut squash is an unfortunate choice for a lasagna. Enough said when this many people did not like it.

Excellent. Everyone absolutely loved this dish! It's something different from the same old basic lasagna dishes that we are all used to. I have even substituted half of the ricotta mixture with cottage cheese one time when I was running low on ricotta. It worked out excellent. Both ways are great. Enjoy!

uhhh, sorry, didn't like it. I should have had a flag going up when it said 3 tubs of ricotta. That's all there is to this lasagna, so if you like ricotta that much, then just buy a tub of it and eat it straight and save yourself the hassle. I've got a ton of the stuff left over so hopefully it will taste better on the reheat.

Rating: 4
Amazing. My boyfriend and I made this one night, and it was our first time cooking with ricotta. Peeling the squash was a chore, but well worth the effort. We accidentally mixed all the cheeses together, and forgot to add eggs, but it turned out so amazing that I think I'll make it the same way again. This recipe reminded several people of turkey stuffing due to the sage; it might be good with turkey added in. It also brings out the sweetness of the squash a little; next time I may roast the squash with butter and salt before putting it into the lasagna.

Rating: 4
WOW! I never give recipes four forks, but this one gets it! My husband could not stop raving! He said its the best lasagna he's ever had!! I modified it only slightly: I used fresh lemon thyme, blended cottage cheese (instead of ricotta- just as tasty and less expensive), and put in a few extra mushrooms as recommended by previous reviews. I goofed and cubed my squash instead of slicing it, but it turned out fantastic all the same. I prepped the squash a day before- this really helped make the final preparation quick. I made it on a weeknight after work!

Rating: 4
Well, I made this for a staff potluck and won in the entree category, so I think it turned out pretty good! However, I had printed out all five pages of reviews and taken the best ideas from each, so this is what I did: 1. I added 4 cloves of garlic and 4 green onions to the chopped onions 2. I added red wine and ground sausage to the mushroom mix, along with double the amount of mushrooms using a wild dried mixture 3. Roasted the squash and used 4 small butternuts to increase the amount, and sauteed a red pepper to mix in there as well 4. Added asiago and nutmeg to the cheese layer 5. Added slivered almonds on the very top mixed in with the cheese for an added crunch. The only thing I think it didn't need was the sausage - the mini veggie dish without it was actually better! It turned out very pretty with all of the colours - but leave yourself a lot of time to prepare this!

After reading all 35 reviews, I decided to give this recipe a try. I even consulted a similar version on CookingLight.com before cooking. The final vote was "you don't need to make that again". No matter what I added to boost the flavor, butternut squash is just too sweet to pair with lasagna noodles.

Rating: 4
I used this recipe as a starting point. I really felt the butternut squash should star in this dish, not the cheese (an excessive amount IMO), as well as I wanted to make it healthier. I doubled the butternut squash (maybe even more---used 1 large squash) and roasted the cubes with a bit of olive oil. I cut the butter for sauteeing to 1 Tbsp and I also increased the mushrooms by 50%, combining baby bellas and regular white mushrooms. Finally I cut the cheese dramatically---I used 1 container of light ricotta cheese, 1.25 cups of parmesan and 2 cups of mozzarella and only 1 egg. I did assemble it the night before and baked it the next day because with the roasting, prep and assembly, the dish took about 90 minutes just to assemble. I also think the fresh sage is absolutely critical to the flavor. This dish was a huge hit with my boyfriend who is always wary of squash and the flavors just improved the next day.

Rating: 1
This was too dry in my opinion. It also could have used more squash-enough to cover each layer would have been nice. I also would have liked more mushrooms. I added garlic to the onion and mushroom mixture as I don't think lasagna is right without garlic. I also used traditional noodles just because that's what I prefer.

I made this lasagna following some tips from other reviewers on this website, and it turned out great! I roasted the squash before combining it with the herbs & broth; doubled the mushrooms (and still could have used more); added the splash of sherry to mushrooms; and used fresh herbs. The other thing I would HIGHLY recommend is finding a market or Italian deli that has freshly made lasagna noodles. I went to and Italian deli and got 4 long layers that I draped over the dish (according to recipe), then cut around edge of dish with pizza cutter. I was able to fit everything in a 9x13 dish, although I had to push down a little bit before baking. It turned out beautifully. My lasagna made 12 servings. The 9 people I served, who are ususally meat eaters, all agreed it was delicious.

This recipe is okay if you're a vegetarian I suppose. Followed the recipe exactly and could not fit it into an 8x13 pan. There's alot of cheese in this which would make anything good but it certainly was not insanely good as one cook wrote. My son is a chef and he was not impressed. We all love lasagna but sometimes a cigar should just be a cigar if you know what I mean.This is not a keeper but I did get rid of that squash that's been sitting on my counter for a month.

A note to all those who have a hard time cutting butternut squash. I slice off the ends first with my best chef's knife, cut it in half at the point where the bulb begins and slice the skin off downwards toward the cutting board, again with my sharpest knife. I have tried using a peeler and will never try again. The easiest way I've found is by using a knife.

This is excellent. I had my doubts and made it for the first time for a potluck with some picky eaters and everyone liked it. I will definitely make again. Took the advice of another reviewer and added some garlic --- not roasted, just minced, added it to the onion and sauteed. Also added a touch of wine to the mushrooms. Make sure your 9 x 13 is big enough so you can incorporate all of the noodles into the dish. I ran out of room and ended up with 1/3 package of the Barilla noodles left over, but it was still wonderful.

My son has an egg allergy so I substituted a mixture of 4 tsp baking powder, 4 T water and 4 T balsamic vinegar in place of the eggs, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was fantastic! We served it at a dinner for 10 people and everyone loved it. The balsamic vinegar added a really nice flavor to the cheese mixture, so much so that I would add it even if I made a version with egg.

This was marvelous! I used the Trader Joe's pre-cubed squash and blended the squash mixture. My only recommendation would be to double the mushroom mixture (w/ which I used green onions for a bit more color). Browned ground sausage could go easily in the mushroom layer for a 'meat eatin' crowd.

It was rich, savory, and a nice alternative to traditional lasagna. I also used the Barilla no-boil noodles. They worked great and didn't get dried out edges, like lasagna sometimes does. I like the suggestion to cut the squash in half and roast it first. Cutting the very hard butternut squash was the most time-consuming part of the recipe. A lot of different vegetable mixes would work. I think those who found it too sweet might not like ricotta in other dishes -- ricotta is sweet in itself, and there's sure a lot of it in this recipe. Ricotta lovers like me will think the recipe is dreamy!

I too thought it dry and that was even after I added the broth left after cooking my squash. I used no-boil noodles that called for soaking in hot broth so that may've been the difference.

I added Bell's seasoning to the ricotta and liked that a lot.

Hey, Epicurious, let's get the math right. Prior to writing this, one reviewer out of fifteen said that she would NOT make this again. So how did you get that 100% would make this again? Last time I divided 14 by 15 I got 93%!!!

I served this at a dinner party the night before Thanksgiving. It was a very big hit. We cut the prep time a bit by halving the squash, then roasting with a drizzle of oil, then scooping out the flesh. Since some guests do not like mushrooms (my 10 year old) I omitted these for 1/2 of the lasagna pan and added some dried cranberries to the mushroomless half. Delicious. We served the dish with our own homemade cranberry sauce.

Rating: 3
OK, so I hate it when people alter a recipe beyond recognition and then rate their own rendition, but I made just a few small changes (which worked out well), so here goes: made almost as stated, but with more mushrooms (almost twice as much, by a happy mistake), and added a little vermouth to the broth for cooking the squash. On a lark, I also added a tiny sprinkle of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture, and tossed in a small handful of finely chopped nuts with the last layer of mushrooms. None of these changed it too terribly much, but each was nice in its own way. The taste of the dish comes from the mushrooms and squash-- if you don't have nice veggies, or season them enough, it's gonna taste bland. (I highly recommend Barilla flat lasagna noodles for this dish; they cook quickly and then get toasty and browned while the cheese gets bubbly) My only complaint was that it was a bit dry once it had sat and everything got absorbed. Next time, I might add a little bechamel over the ricotta layers to add some creaminess (not much--maybe a cup in total) The sauce would make a good place to stash the nutmeg, too.

I too do not understand all the rave reviews. I had no issues with this dish being too sweet, but... it was average at best. With all the 4 fork reviews I thought for sure this would be a hit at Thanksgiving, but was very disappointed!

We made this last night and used it as a starting point. It turned out very nicely, even though I modified it extensively (I wanted more veggies, garlic, and less cheese). So what we ended up with was this lasagne with double the mushrooms, layers of spinach, and a layer of sauteed red peppers, yellow romas, and fennel with a sprinkling of cheese on top. I second roasting the squash-was very nice. So I'll totally make a again, and probably do something equally nuts to it next time.

I loved this, and so did my husband! I doubled the mushroom mixture and added a splash of sherry to them while cooking. With the squash sliced as written, you wind up with gorgeous and very distinctive layers of lasagna a mile high! I just eyeballed the amount of squash for each layer after cooking it, and found there was quite a bit of liquid in the pan afterward, but that's fine (you don't want the liquid added to the recipe or it might be runny). Don't skimp on the fresh herbs, they absolutely make the dish. Excellent!

Rating: 4
Wonderful and very flavorful! This is a simple dish in which I had reservations making. My wife is a veg and I wanted to make the perfect dish for her. This was really flavorful and beautiful. Fresh is the key when it comes to the herbs. The only thing I did after simmering the squash was to drain it. Then I placed it into a cuisinart and pulsed it a couple of times to "smooth up" the squash. I find it a little too runny if its not drained. Its a must try!! Enjoy

Rating: 3
This was good, but would be even better with some modifications. If I make this again, I would roast the squash slices after tossing them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried sage. Roasting the squash will caramelize the sugars and give a deeper, richer flavor to the squash. I found the squash in this recipe to be a bit too bland, although I agree that the fresh herbs were excellent. I would also double the mushroom mixture and make it with an assortment of more intensely flavored mushrooms. I also added slices of black-forest ham (obviously not vegetarian) in between the layers, which complemented the flavors nicely. I used organic whole wheat dried lasagna, which I boiled before layering. This worked fine and the whole wheat taste and texture paired well with rustic/ autumnal qualities of the dish. Enjoy.
