Great combo. Love that you can make it a little bit ahead of time, so perfect for entertaining. Served with pork tenderloin, great combo.

Yummy! I added shallots to the fennel.

I have made this several times and found if you cook the fennel until it is crispy and brown it gives the dish an entirely different complex flavor with just a hint of fennel. I prefer the browned version to the non-browned.

Meh. I made this and put the striped bass with agrodolce sauce on top. The agrodolce sauce (DELICIOUS) completely overpowered the fennel and I wasn't able to taste the fennel at all.

These were yummy-licious. The fennel flavor in the mashed potatoes was a nice contrast to the creaminess. Will definitely make again. We didn't have half and half so we substituted a combination of whipping cream and whole milk.

Absolutely delicious. The fennel was subtle, yet present. Just lovely.

Absolutely delicious. (I'm a little curious as to why one reviewer would make this if she /he didn't like fennel????) The fennel taste is subtle and just enough to be interesting. Loved this recipe.

Made this to go with the red wine pot roast with porcini. Nice twist on standard mashed potatoes. Very good dish.

This is a good way to disguise fennel. I am not a huge fan of the anise flavor so I left out the fennel seeds, the mashed potatoes had a nice flavor. As other reviewers suggested I paired this with red-wine pot roast with porcini mushrooms for a wonderful meal.

I used plain yogurt instead of half and half (made them a little healthier and added some dimension to the flavor). These were amazing. Everyone loved them.

Absolutely great accompanying the red wine pot roast with porcini mushrooms. I've already made it twice. The first time I left it rather chunky, but the second time, I put the potatoes through a ricer to ensure smoothness. Otherwise, there's no need to make any changes.

The fennel really adds something interesting to the mashed potatoes, and it goes perfectly with the pot roast with porcini sauce. Yummy!
