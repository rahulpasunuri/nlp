i brought this to thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it (or my family is too nice). the only dissapointment was nasty, out of season tomatoes. i think this would be better in the summer. leftovers were yummy warmed or cold.

Tried it but wasn't too keen on it. A bit bland for my tastes, I'm afraid. I'm not a corn person (love it on the cob, however), although I've had other dishes incorporating corn and have liked them.

Well, it certainly is a pretty dish, but not much better than regular succotash. If you want to add more fat, skip the half & half, which I thought added nothing, and add another tbsp or 2 of butter.

This dish was a hit at Thanksgiving. Three folks asked for the recipe. It was super easy to make, and very colorful. It was a pretty and tasty side dish for everyone, and it was a great main dish for vegetarians. I made it with frozen edamame and frozen corn, and even the lima-bean haters thought it was great. Be sure to wait and add the chives and tomatoes right before serving, or the tomatoes will break apart and get mushy.

Easy to make, tastes great! What more could you want from a recipe?

Always a crowd pleaser! I must have made this a dozen times already.

Delicious - used fresh white corn, and edamame (altho very labor intensive). Next time I'll use baby limas. Added salt and lots of black pepper. Great summer BBQ dish.

Of all the dishes in this menu, my husband liked this one the best (and there were some real winners on the menu, too: gravy, rum pumpkin pie, etc.). I never would have expected something so basic to come out so good, but it was delicious!

Delicious, I make it every Thanksgiving. Use edamame and fresh corn.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but this was a very soggy, bland dash.

This was very good. I made this in advance but still add the green onions, tomatoes and cream. It turned out fine.

I have been making this dish every Thanksgiving since it premiered in the November 1996 issue, and it's been a favorite at our table every year.

This was a hit with my family and they are demanding frequent repetition.

I have made this recipe a number of times. It is a special treat that the whole family enjoys.

This is an excellent recipe (as is the entire menu). I selected b/c my husband LOVES lima beans--thought I wouldn't like it--and found it D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!
