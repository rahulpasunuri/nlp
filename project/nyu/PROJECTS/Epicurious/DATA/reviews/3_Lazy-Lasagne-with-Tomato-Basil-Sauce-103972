4 forks, but you must change the sauce recipe. First fry garlic, onion and 1/2 lb of minced beef. Add some chili flakes and most importantly some sugar to taste. Wonton skins provide a great low carb feature -- cook them in wide frying pan. Excellent!

Don't expect this recipe to be a lasagne replacement. Take it as it is--a quick and fabulous combination of ingredients that make a yummy and lovely dish. Feel free to make more or less layers as I think the amount of ricotta mixture yielded is way out of proportion to the tomatoe sauce. Finally, don't try to cook and dry the wonton skins faster than one or two at a time--the time saved with the recipe will be wasted prying apart wonton skins that are glued together!

I gave this two forks since I changed it. As is, it didn't seem too compelling. I did follow sauce directions (used San Marzanos for best results) and loved its simplicity. However, I was skeptical of won ton skins and opted for another (even easier) replacement ...no-boil lasagne sheets. And I added some mozzerella both between layers and on top of the lasagne. The results were a light, satisfying alternative to a heavy, labor intensive dish.

I rated this recipe low because the sauce (and the whole dish in general) was very bland. I served it to three people and all said it definately needed something. There are too many good lasagna recipes to try before this one.

I thought this was better than a traditional lasagne. Much lighter & tastier. I wasn't that crazy about the sauce, though. Otherwise, I would definitely make this again. As a matter of fact, I'm already receiving requests to do just that.

I made this for dinner last night. Easy, delicious, and very, very pretty. It would make a nice first course for a small dinner party with meat as the entree. It could definitely be made earlier, "parked", and then heated just before serving.

This was as attractive as was pictured, wonton skins were a little hard to handle as they stuck together easily. I added a little crushed red pepper to the sauce which gave it a little zing.
