Made this as quick side dish for pasta. Everyone raved!! Excellent and easy. Oh did not have pancetta, so I made my own bacon bits.

I make this salad about once a week, we love it. We substitute the pancetta that comes in a slab form instead of the sliced variety. I find it isn't as salty.

I liked the idea of this salad but the prosciutto and kalamata olives together make it way too salty. It needs something else added to cut the saltiness. Perhaps worth playing around with, but I think there are better quick salad recipes out there.

Easy, easy, easy. Put pancetta in microwave for 1 minute to get it crisp.

So simple and easy to do! Make sure to whisk the dressing well.
