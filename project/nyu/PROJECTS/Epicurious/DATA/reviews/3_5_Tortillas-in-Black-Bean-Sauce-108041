We love this recipe and put it in our regular rotation. It is quite similar to enfijoladas we have had on our travels in Oaxaca. I too cut back the anise by half, but my boyfriend likes the full amount (I'm really not an anise fan, but it is great in this recipe). I prefer cotija to the cheeses mentioned, though.

Delicious. (and one of the most affordable recipes I've made). I do think I'll use just a bit less anise next time. I really liked the flavor, but I think it could be a bit more subtle. Also, I made my own corn tortillas-which was easy, but time consuming and not all that much better than the good store bought variety, so I'll probably buy them next time.

Found this a great use of extra tortillas! From now on I will buy them just for this recipe. It combines many of my families favorite things into one outstanding dish. Served it with Steak with Red Chili Sauce and it was a wonderful meal. Love the anise!

dope stuff, I added some shredded lettuce to the toppings, just cut it up and squeezed some lime juice over the lettuce and let it soak in while I prepared the tortillas.

This is the ultimate in comfort food! I have made it twice and thoroghly enjoyed it both times. The sauce would be a great soup in and of itself, but the tortillas add great texture and flavor. It makes me want to go to Mexico!

Actually, I made these beans without pureeing them and served them with the Chicken, carrot and potato enchiladas from this May's issue. My husband really liked the addition of the anise. I used dried epazote which can be purchased at Mexican markets in San Diego. I left the seeds whole and could not tell when eating the beans. I also always add 4 - 6 dried bay leaves when I cook dried beans. I plan to try this recipe's use of the beans as well.

I thought this was tasty but it didn't wow me. The anise in the black beans was unusual and nice.

This dish IS the exact dish I had every morning while staying in the City of Oaxaca earlier this year, and I am so excited to be able to make it for myself. I have made this several times already, and it is fantastic! You can substitute cilantro sprigs for the epazote and although I made it without the aniseed the first time (because I didn't have any) and it was good, but once I made it with the aniseed I will never go without again! Extra onion and garlic doesn't hurt either. Before pureeing, I often reserve some of the beans to eat whole because they are great that way too!
