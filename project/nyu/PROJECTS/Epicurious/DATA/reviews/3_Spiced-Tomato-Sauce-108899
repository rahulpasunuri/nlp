I added quite a bit of extra cayenne pepper. This led to a pretty spiced and spicy sauce. It gave a nice kick to the phyllo dough appetizers that I made it to accompany - they were pretty bland and needed something to spice them up!

Delicious with the Morroccan Chicken rolls. Definitely neds to be heated or at room temperature to be a good dip.

I found this spicy enough but that's because I substituted dried red pepper flakes and tipped too many in! I served this alongside grilled chicken and the 'corn pancakes' recipe on this site.

I agree with the other reviewers that the spicy was missing. I would definitely spice it up more next time and cut the recipe in half for the quantity of phyllo rolls. We had way too much left over.

Delicious. But not exactly spicy....I'd increase the heat next time. Went beautifully with the chicken phyllo rolls. We loved it.

I made this to go with the Moroccan Chicken Phyllo Rolls. Very good with that dish, as it uses the same spices and extends the flavor with some others (although i didn't use cloves).

This smells wonderful. But, the taste just does not hit the mark. We found it better as a dip for tortilla chips than as a sauce over chicken.
