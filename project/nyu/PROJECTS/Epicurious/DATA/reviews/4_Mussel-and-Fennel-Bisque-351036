Made this as part of our Valentine's dinner ... we all really liked it (adults and children -- ages 6 and 4). It was delicious!

This soup is amazing. I made it for a party and I thought it was really exceptional. The flavours are rich and delicious and indulgent. You could make a healthier version by cutting down on the butter, using brown rice and subbing evaporated skim milk for the whipping cream. But it's absolutely awesome as is. YUM.

The recipe was perfect, if you do not have enough clam juice you can do 50-50 with water, it works as well (that's what I did). Easy to make and a sure hit if you have guests over.

Absolutely delicious. I bought some cheap frozen mussels (no fresh mussels available, and I was being cheap), which smelled disgusting, so I tossed them and substituted about 3/4 of a pound of frozen large shrimp, which I pureed with the rest of the soup. Unbelievably good.

Outstanding. I also chose not to do the fennel garnish because I wanted a velvety smooth bisque. I increased the pureed fennel cubes to about two cups, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

Wonderful as a first course or with additton of a salad and crusty bread makes a light supper.

Absolutely delicious! This was a big hit at my dinner party. One guest doesn't eat mussels but still enjoyed every bite of the bisque without the shellfish. I followed the recipe except for the sauteed fennel garnish which I don't think anyone missed. I will definitely make this again.

This was incredible, rich but simple. My only complaint was that it took a bit long, maybe over an hour to make as the recipe said the rice would take ~25 minutes to cook (which 1/4 c. of rice doesn't really need). Substituted seafood stock for clam juice and wasn't disappointed. Make sure to have bread on hand as you will definitely want to sop up ever last drop.

OMG! This soup is f-ing delicious!!! The only thing that I did differently was to saute and puree all of the fennel cubes, and only garnished with parsley. I had the leftovers over noodles as a meal, and licked my plate clean. An exquisite dish make with one of the last true seafood bargains. A+++

My husband and I really enjoyed this! I halved the recipe and it was perfect for two. I made the mistake of not blending veggie/broth mixture enough so it turned out grainy but, in the end, the flavor was not adversely effected. I loved the sauted bits of fennel on top. Served with German dark rye bread. --A very flavorful and elegant soup--

My husband loves mussels, so trying this was a must. Everyone loved it and it will definitely become a make again recipe in my home. I made it exactly as written. It needed a bit of fresh ground pepper and salt to taste, and a few of us felt that the sauteed fennel as garnish was a distraction from the wonderful creaminess of the bisque. Next time I will garnish with just the fennel fronds and parsley.
