This is pico de gallo, also called salsa fresca. This is not what most people in the States think of when they think of salsa. The salsa you find at Mexican restaurants and the like is usually a salsa roja, which has very similar ingredients, but is usually pureed and is often made by first roasting the vegetables both to bring out their flavors as well as to get them to the desired texture. Many people make it with canned tomatoes as well, which are also cooked, resulting in the kind of "mouth feel" one expects with this kind of a salsa. In short, the title of this recipe "Mexican Salsa" is very misleading and should really be changed, possibly to "Salsa Fresca" if not just calling it pico de gallo.

Easy and great flavor. Be sure and let it stand for a couple of hours.

This is the perfect mix of ingredients for tacos, grilled meat, etc. My chiles were a bit wimpy but the salsa was excellent.

It turned out well and is the first salsa I have made. I did not follow the ingredient amounts exactly and I received many compliments on it!
