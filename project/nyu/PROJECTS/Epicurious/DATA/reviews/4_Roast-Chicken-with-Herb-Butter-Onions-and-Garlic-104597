Wow...glad I brought in the herbs from the garden to over winter. Our roast chicken was moist and infused with flavor. The pan gravy tasted of onion and herbs and was delicious over roasted red potatoes. The onions and garlic turned out mild and sweet. This recipe is a new favorite.

I have just used this recipe to help me learn how to roast chicken for the first time. I chose this recipe over all the others in the cook books that I have because their first timer recipes were, well, too basic. This recipe helped me to understand the use of seasoning, mixing herbs and basting (I don't cook) and it was delicious. This will be my weekend 'go to' roast recipe!

Best roast chicken I've made! I didn't even do all the chicken prep instructions. Just filled the cavity with onions and celery. Salt and Peppered the bird and threw some onions in the roasting pan. By accident, my oven temp was 350 for the first 30 minutes. At the first 30 minutes, I salt and peppered 2 T butter and rubbed some on the chicken and tossed some with the onions & garlic in the pan. (Then noticed the temp should be 400 and changed that!), then basted as directed after another 30 minutes. I then followed the recipe for tenting the bird and making the gravy. It was the most tender, flavorful, moist chicken I have ever made and I roast a chicken at least twice a month. It's an awesome meal as you'll probably have left overs and the tools for fabulous stock. It's the meal that keeps on giving!

great flavors..I mixed EVOO and a little butter to keep the calories down, and really rubbed the skin hard with EVOO to make sure it was crisp & it turned out great...really moist too. I especially liked the sauce; but, I think the amt. of flour should be 1T maybe 1 1/2T so it thickens up. I used 1T of Wondra and it was still a little thin.

I've tried a lot of roasted chicken recipes but this one stands out. It is flavorful and moist and the gravy is delicious. The onions and garlic are amazing as well. The only change I made was serving the chicken on top of homemade croutons (an Ina Garten recipe) which really made it. We served it with the Autumn Farmer's Market salad and an apple galette which made for a perfect fall meal. I'm throwing out all the other roasted chicken recipes I have.

I made this last night and it was easy and turned out great. I don't have a meat thermometer so I just followed the directions exactly - 3 30 minute intervals - and it came out perfectly. The skin was crispy, the meat was perfect, and the gravy was awesome. Hard to mess this up.

Rating: 4
The only thing I'd change with this recipe is the direction to test the thigh at 180 and that's only because I test the breast instead. I've always inserted the meat thermometer in the portion where the pop-up normally goes (never use those, a meat thermometer is cheap enough and will serve you well) and take the bird out between 163-168. If tented and left to rest for 10-15 minutes, the bird will continue to cook and be at the exact right temperature for serving. Juicy, yummy roast chicken every time.

I've made this several times and am now trying different variations of this method just to mix things up a bit. Butter, dijon mustard, taragon, garlic, etc. It has always turned out extremely juicy and flavorful. With all that butter, how could it not be delicious? I'm not a chicken eater, but will take a taste to assess the flavor and recipe. This one is a keeper! My family loves it!

as we eat less and less red meat, lamb and ham just weren't going to work for Easter this year. I did this chicken recipe instead and it is the new Easter tradition at our house - it stayed juicy and flavorful even though I overcooked it, and the herbs added a nice spring flavor that was not overwhelming. Served with roast vegetables (fennel and shallots work really well), it was an Easter meal that even the die hard carnivores in our family were happy with.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. The onions were too much, I felt the need to add carrots which helped, and the cook/roast time was not sufficient. My chicken was slimy and raw. I made this for a date and he was polite enough to eat it. I was left embarrassed. In short, move on to another recipe, this one isn't any good. Not to mention it's incredibly unhealthy with almost an entire stick of butter rubbed on the chicken and veggies. There's better out there.

An easy and very tasty roast chicken. I made this exactly as written, and the simplicity of the herbs and aromatics here really enhance the flavor of the chicken. I did not find this dry at all--in fact, quite succulent. Will make again.

Made this last night...maybe it's my stupid oven, but no matter how hard I try I can't seem to keep a chicken from turning out dry. I might try this again but decrease the # of minutes in the oven each round to 25 instead of 30 to see if that helps.

Rating: 4
The BEST thing about this recipe by far is the gravy. So don't skimp on that! It is a lot of butter/fat, and that would make anything taste good, but the fresh herbs really add to it. Actually, the meat is better tasting on day 2 after it's sat in the refrigerator and had even more time to absorb the herb taste. Reheating the gravy and pouring over it. YUM! I followed the recipe as written. After cooking, turn it breast side down and let it stand 10 minutes or so so juices run into the breast and make it juicer.

Very good roast chicken recipe. I cut the recipe in half (butter and herbs) since I had a 3 lb bird (only 2 of us). I added sliced garlic under the skin with the butter as well as a few cloves with the veggies, around the bird. Also added a head of garlic with top sliced off, leeks, carrots, potatoes, and only one onion (given that I had other veggies). Added a leek and a quarter lemon to the cavity, along with the other herbs. The sauce never thickened for me but it was a nice addition anyway. We love roast chicken and I'll definitely make this one again, along with some other versions for a little variety.

This was delicious...even my 9 year old son has been begging me to make it again, and he doesn't like chicken! I used rosemary, sage and thyme and left out the fennel and parsley. I also used 4 fewer cloves of garlic, and added potatoes and french beans. I wouldn't recommend the beans though, next time I'll use carrots.

This is a great recipe. The changes I made was to the chicken was to use a whole stick of butter instead of leaving 1 tablespoon out, add garlic to the butter, and a lot more salt. For the pan sauce I made a roux with the leftover butter and used a tablespoon of flour which I cooked for two minutes before adding the drippings which I reduced for ten minutes. I think this made for a thicker and smoother sauce.

Awesome!! I followed the other users advice and threw in carrots and potatoes... oh my gosh!! I made the gravy pretty lumpy and that seemed to work out really well too. The only complaint my family gave was that I should have made a turkey so that there was more.

Wow! This dish is succulent, savory, juicy, and full of classic, delicious flavor. I would make this roast chicken again in a heartbeat. My only recommendation is to eat the whole chicken the night it is cooked. The huge amount of butter in the recipe hardens after refrigeration, and the chicken becomes quite butter-coated. But when hot, this chicken is WONDERFUL!

One reviewer wrote the sauce was to cry over. I agree, but I bet for different reasons. Tasteless. This recipe was way more work than necessary. I will try one more time, but it will be potatoes, carrots and maybe green beans all in one roasting pan. Deglaze the pan with the wine, add some broth and some cornstarch.

Rating: 3
This was very good. Cut back to 5 T. of butter and it didn't seem to lack juiciness or flavor. Omitted fennel seeds (didn't have any) but put in peeled and quartered potatoes at the same time as the garlic, brushing the seasoned butter on everything. Made the sauce, adding a little bit more cornstarch to thicken and it was really delicious on the chicken. With a 7 lb. chicken, it took exactly the time called for (the pop-up timer popped up within a minute of the oven timer!). It was a very attractive dish to serve.

Rating: 4
This recipe not only smells delicious however was even better the next day as left overs in a salad. I didn't have fennel seeds on hand so I skipped that. Also, I used a bit more flour than it had suggested in the gravy and drizzled some over a side of mashed potatoes. Great recipe - will definitely make it again :)

The chicken is very good (I got the biggest and it was 5 1//2 pounds). I roasted for the full 1 1/2 hours and it could have been done a little less. The onions and garlic were a little under done but good. I made a gravy from the sauce ingredients and it was wonderful.

Very good chicken recipe. Mine turned out looking exactly like the picture, which never happens to me. We had this for New Year's Eve dinner and everyone loved it. I had some reservations about using the fennel seeds, but they ended up a very nice addition. The only thing that didn't work out so well for me is that the garlic got really burnt. I think I will wait longer to put them in next time.

I used the herb butter recipe for roasting a chicken I needed for another recipe. It was so delicious.

This was succulent. We so love the good types of fat used like butter, olive oil so unlike one cook here, we just threw in some more to get the juices flowing. To make use of that juice, we tucked sweet potatoes and normal potatoes in thyme and oil around our bird (a chicken that was much smaller than the recipe calls for). With the wine sauce it was pure bliss.

this is the first time I have ever made a roasted chicken and it was wonderful! The gravy did get a little greasy but it may be because I didnt have any white wine.

As it was just for 2 of us, I used a 3.75lb chicken, half the herbed butter, roasted for 1 1/4 hrs (started at 400 but after 30 min increased to 425 as I was impatient and starving). I won't say it's bland, but it could have used more herbage. Possibly halve the butter but leave the herb amts. A little garlic in the butter would have been welcome, too. Onions/garlic didn't burn (slathered them in butter) but ended up soft and very tasty. I've been searching for a go-to roast chicken recipe and this one good, but I think I'll keep looking.

I dream about this chicken. When I hear the words "roast chicken" my mind goes immediately to this recipe and my mouth starts watering. Highlights include: the melty, perfectly pungent garlic cloves; the wondrous herb aroma; and the stuck-to-the-pan bits of chicken skin and fat. The gravy is thin and liquidy, but full of flavor. It will be years before I even try another recipe because I can't stand the thought of roasting a chicken that does not taste like this.

This is my favorite roast chicken recipe. I use about 1/2 the butter and chop up what ever fresh yummy herbs I have on hand. Usually I use thyme, tarragon or oregano with parsley. I also put a small onion or cut up lemon in the cavity along with some more of the herbs. I always roast it exactly 1 hour at 400 set on convection/roast. Delicious, beautiful, extremely flavorful and the kitchen smells out of this world!

I pretty much followed the recipe except I didn't use parsley or fennel seeds. I also added an orange, cut into smaller pieces and stuffed it in the cavity and around the chicken. It adds this lovely sweetness to the chicken. When it comes to the gravy, I added some of the juice of the roasted orange and it definitely kicked it up. Yummmmmmy!!

Comes out delicious! I made it following the recipe, then I made it again but substituted fresh tarragon for the rosemary and thyme and it was even tastier. Both times I used a 4.5 lb bird but still cooked it for 1.5 hours total and none of the meat was dry. 2 tips: You don't have to use quite as much butter as they say and it will still be delicious; put some cloves of garlic under the skin of the bird.

Rating: 4
So good. I did make a few modifications though...but just because I had to. Next time I'll try it as written. I had no fresh thyme, but I did have fresh sage so substituted that and added a little dried thyme. I also had a smaller bird - around 4.5 lbs. My oven cooks a little low though so it ended up taking almost as much time to get the thighs done. I did what some of the other reviewers did and chopped up some of the garlic and put it in the butter mixture. The other clove I cut the top off and roasted w/ the chicken. Baste, flip chicken, baste, turn onions....yum. The gravy though is the winner here. I had other vegetables in the bottom of my roasting pan...they didn't turn out great but did add a lot to the flavor of the sauce. The fond - OHHH! I used Viognier for the wine. I also added a little bit of garam masala and balsamic vinegar. Sounds strange, but it rounded it out well.

I did this as an emergency dish because I had almost all the ingredients, and it turned out very nice, despite using only a packet of chicken legs instead of a whole chicken. But the herbs were fresh from the garden, and the stock was home made duck stock from the remains of a previous meal. As suggested by one reviewer I roasted the garlic head whole and used it over toasts. With the legs roasting time the onions turn out just right.

This was an excellent chicken. My sauce would have never thickened per the recipe, but luckily one of my dinner guests was a Gravy Master. She had me mix 2 heaping spoonfuls of flour with about a 1/4 cup of water to get all of the flour lumps out. I then slowly added the flour mixture to the sauce as she whisked over medium heat. The sauce thickened up beautifully and tasted wonderful.

My husband professes to hate roasted chicken, but said this one was a winner and gave me permission to make it again (!). The chicken was great! Very moist and tender, and the herbs were awesome. My only caveat is that there didn't seem to be much point to the onions and the garlic, and both got a bit burnt. That in turn gave a burnt taste to the sauce - but otherwise the sauce was GREAT!

Instead of separating the cloves of garlic, I slicked the top off an entire head, let it roast for an hour (basting it w/ the butter/pan juices) and removed.... used the cloves as spread for warmed bread MMMMM... delicious! Oh and I threw in sage for good measure.

I'm in the minority who think the result was not worth the effort. My sauce did not thicken and was greasy to the point of being inedible. And, even if it weren't so greasy, the onions completely overwhelmed the herb flavor in the sauce. The chicken, however, was perhaps the juiciest I've ever made. Like others, I couldn't find a 7 lb chicken; I cooked a 5 1/2 lb chicken for 1 1/2 hours and it was only just barely done.

The prep for this took a but just because I used fresh herbs (thus had to mince them), but it was worth it! Very tasty! I altered the recipe a fair amount, but used the technique. In the herb butter, I put fresh rosemary, dried thyme, fresh garlic, sea salt, and fresh cracked pepper. I put sea salt, pepper, minced garlic, and minced rosemary (I minced too much for the butter!) in the cavity. But I made the sauce (really more of a gravy) just like the recipe stated, and it thickened up perfectly and was so good we were dipping our bread in it! So, play around with the herbs and spices--use your favorites. But don't skip the sauce.

This was so simple and everyone loved it. There were no 7 lb. chickens so I bought 2 3.5 pounders and left everything else the same. I threw some of the onions into the cavity of the chicken and then blended half the onion/garlic/juice mixture in a blender for a sauce/gray.

I've made this recipe several times, and keep getting asked to make it again. It's easy, in fact it was my first attempt at cooking a roast of any sort. When I first made it, I didn't have fennel seed, and I've never made it with fennel. Also, I don't usually bother with the broth or wine; there is more than enough herb butter to keep the bird moist, provided you occasionally dot it with drippings while cooking. I threw lots of garlic inside the bird as well. The onion/garlic/butter drippings are fantastic to use in mashed potatoes after the bird is cooked. Nothing better than mashing roasted garlic cloves into your spuds. Easy. Enjoy.

This was a wonderful chicken! I did find a 7 pounder, but only made about 2 tbsp herb butter for the chicken (about 1 tbsp under the skin) and the rest spread on the chicken and dotting the onion and garlic, which kept the chicken moist but not greasy. I stuffed some onion and lemon into the bird along with the herbs. I yanked the onion and garlic out of the pan with a slotted spoon after one hour. They was perfectly caramelized and roasted. I ended up mixing the onion & garlic into roasted red potatoes and served the whole thing with a side dish of brussels sprouts with bacon. The gravy was excellent. I used corn starch/water paste instead of flour and didn't add any extra herb butter. Whisked in two tbsp of sour cream at the end. Fabulous! I got many, many compliments on it! This is our official New Sunday Dinner.

The best part about this recipe is the gravy. Really flavorfull! my mother requested that I make this recipe for guests over the holidays. I roast veggies to go with it. Potatoes, carrotts, fennel bulb and extra onions. I make extra herb butter and dot the veggies with it and roast them in a seperate pan for one hour. I do not use canned chicken broth. When I put the chicken in the oven, I boil the giblets in 2 cups water with sliced onion and extra herbs (thyme and rosemary sometimes I throw a clove of garlic in and a few carrots, slat and pepper. I let it simmer while the chicken is cooking. I strain it and use the brothin the gravy.

This was the first time I made a whole roasted chicken, and it turned out great! Instead of roasting it at the same temp as the recipe calls for, I blasted it at 450 for 15 minutes to make the skin crispier (it worked, but beware of the smoke it produces). After 15 min at 450, it then only took 45 minutes more at 375. I added a half lemon as others suggested. The chicken turned out a bit greasy, but really delicious.

This was pretty good, but a little dry. I'd give it 2.5 forks. I put half a lemon inside the chicken - it was the only change I made to the recipe. I did not, however, make the sauce..perhaps that would've helped with the dryness and added to the flavor...

This recipe is great as a basic recipe to play with. It needed some adjustment in my book. The cooking time is off - my chicken took 2 hrs to roast. I would also increase the amount of herbs added to the butter, omit the fennel seed next time, and use less garlic. I agree with a previous reviewer that the onions were very very overdone. I also roast potatoes, carrots and parsnips alongside the chicken. The sauce did not thicken at all for me. Next time I will use more flour and add extra herbs to it, if I bother making it at all. However, this chicken was by far the moistest I have ever tasted and the flavour (if not the texture) of the roasted onion was incredible! I served it with balsamic aspargus and grilled oyster mushrooms (recipe on site) - the tart flavour of these veggies nicely balanced the richness of the chicken and roast veggies.

I wanted to use an organic chicken and couldn't find any 7lb-ers. That is a monster chicken. Like other reviewers I found the cooking time to be "way" underestimated. It took my 4lb chicken much longer to cook. I would also keep the onions and garlic out until the last 20 minutes or so next time. Still, the chicken was moist and flavorful. I don't cook meat often, and when I do I like it to be special, and I found this one very worthwhile.

Absolutely delicious chicken. I used a fryer, adding carrots and celery as a "rack" under the chicken, which added great flavor to the sauce. The sauce was outstanding, a real hit. I did note it took exactly 1 hour 30 minutes to cook, which was fine. The chicken was moist and totally delightful.

I found this to be a very savory recipe. It was a nice change from my more traditional roasted chix with sage bread stuffing. I'm not one to try new recipes out on company, so we had leftovers that made great sandwiches. After reading other reviews, I added a bit more flour to the sauce. I might roast at 350 instead of 400 next time, but otherwise, we really enjoyed it.

I was stunned at the positive reviews for this chicken! I thought the herbs, garlic and onions would add tons of flavor to the bird, but it seemed none of it transferred to the chicken.

This was absolutely the BEST chicken I have ever cooked--and I've cooked alot of chicken. It was juicy and SOOO tasty! I did have to add more flour to thicken the sauce to my liking, but it had wonderful flavor. Four forks plus!

This was delicious, elegant & pretty easy to prepare. I had to thicken the sauce with a little more flour but it was very tasty. A success with my dinner guests.

Incredible dish for X-mas dinner. What a hit! We used a capon and it worked fine. Especially good with sherry potatoes and cherry marsala cranberries... Excellent dish and very easy to make! Great for dinner parties.

This was my first time to make a roasted chicken. If I would have known how easy it was to make chicken this tender & juicy, I would have tried it a long time ago. This will become a staple recipe in our home. Next time, I think I'll make more & use leftovers for sandwiches, soups & salads throughout the week!

This recipe produced a restaurant-quality chicken from my own kitchen. I don't feel like I'm a great chef, but this one makes me look as good as it tastes! Absolutely perfect; don't skip the sauce!

This was so delicious (and simple) -- our house smelled like Thanksgiving even though it was the first of June. The chicken was moist and flavorful. Halfway through I did start to baste with warm chicken broth instead of butter -- I thought our arteries would appreciate that. Of course, I used a little less than 1/4 cup of cream instead of the butter to make the paste for the gravy, so my artery-preservation theory went right out the window (it was unbelievably good though!). Recommend making this one!

As a beginner cook, this was the first roasted chicken I ever made and it was delicious! I would recommend using half the amount of butter (it's very rich) and definitely use a meat thermometer. I basted the onions and garlic every so often to keep them from drying out in the oven.

This was a fantastic dish!!!! I made it for Mother's Day dinner and my family loved it. My Mom said it was restaraunt quality. I think I'll try it with a Turkey for Thanksgiving.!!!

The chicken was great, but for some reason the onions and garlic burned and end up filling the oven with smoke. Not quite that impressive for my guests, but still the chicken was so good! I used two 3 1/2 pound chickens and only about half the butter and skipped the sauce and still had a winner. Like another reviewer said, it is a little time consuming which isn't great when you are having guests, but everyone loved it.

I made this yesterday for Sunday dinner with family and they all thought it was the best roast chicken they ever tasted - mainly because of the herb flavor and the moistness. Really delicious. I had 8 people so I actually prepared two 3 1/2 pound chickens but I used the exact same measurements and just split it between the two chickens. It took at least two hours to roast the chickens though - I think it was closer to 2 1/2 actually. I can't believe this recipe uses a 7 pound chicken and gives an estimated roasting time of 1 1/2 hrs. Unless - my oven is really off . . .hmm, may have to check it out. Anyway - this recipe is easy, delicious and excellent for a low-stress dinner because you can prepare the other side dishes while the chicken finishes roasting.

I hate to put bad feedback on this when everyone loved it, however, 1 1/2 hours to cook a 7 1/2# bird was just not enough time. As a result, the chicken was undercooked, even though I let it go beyond the reccomended time. Perhaps this was due to some error on my part since others didn't seem to have this problem, but the gross out factor of undercooked chicken is fairly high so I thought I should warn others. ps: yes, i need to buy a meat thermometer!

One of the best recipes I've ever made using this website. Flavorful moist chicken and great gravy. Will become a family favorite. Used a smaller chicken (4+ lb) for 2 adults and 1 child.

This is quite a lovely recipe for roast chicken and the sauce is divine. I thickened it more than as described in the recipe. The browned onions and garlic add a lot of the overall flavour. I would definitely make this again.

I have never made or tasted chicken so moist as this. The only thing is that it requires a lot of attention - hard if you are entertaining. I would not hesitate to make this again. It was an immense hit!

I really enjoyed this chicken, but did not rate it because I did change the recipe quite a bit. Taking the cue from other reviewers that this dish was very delicious--if rich, and time-consuming to roast--I went ahead and made it with several modifications: I used a small chicken (2 1/2 - 3 pounds), just a tablespoon of butter, and roasted it at a higher temperature overall. To keep it moist, I added 3/4 cup chicken stock to the pan, and placed the chicken breast-side down, initially. (You don't get the crisp breast-skin this way, but it means that you do get moister white meat.) Also, a tip for spreading the butter around: if you loosen the skin around the "bum" area as well, you can push butter under the leg skin more easily. Done this way, the chicken was juicy and flavorful, and done in an hour and fifteen minutes.

We loved this recipe, even though it is what I would consider in the un-healthy category, but most tasty dishes are. I did use a butter ball chicken, which is suppose is cheating a little, as they taste pretty good by themselves. I added a cup of fresh lemon juice and served with lemon and rosemary infused new potatoes (broiled). Thumbs up!

It was good, very tasty and flavorful, but very rich. We made chicken noodle soup out of the leftover chicken and broth.

I had a dinner party for six, and the meal was a hit. I added red potatoes as suggested by another reviewer and served it with green beans and fresh bread. I suggest that you prepare the butter ahead of time.

Should have read the reviews before I made this. It is indeed a delicious recipe, however, my almost 7 lb. roasting chicken took two hours and some of the garlic turned hard. Next time I will not add onions and garlic until later as suggested by another reviewer. I did double the flour, (1 T)...sauce was thin, but that didn't detract from the finished product. I used fresh herbs and didn't find the flavor at all overwhelming.

This was the first chicken I've roasted and we LOVED it! The chicken was moist and flavorful and we added carrots and potatoes which were a great compliment. The only thing I was unclear of was whether to roast it covered or uncovered. We did it half and half and it took over 2 hours for a 6 lb bird!

Rating: 4
This produced a very flavorful, moist chicken. Only cooked a 4 pounder and it took 90 min. If cooking a bigger bird, adjust time accordingly. Didn't get all my onions and garlic cooked to the same doneness but they did add a nice touch. Made the "sauce" but no one ate it. I think the chicken is fine on its own.

I just made a turkey for Christmas last night using a recipe from this site very similar to this one (roast turkey with shallot gravy). Both are fantastic! I prefer a thicker gravy so added flour to thicken.

What a great recipe. I have made it three times now for different people and all have loved it.

Wonderful fall meal and the smell as the chicken is roasting is awesome. Added red potatoes with the onions and they were addictive after roasting in the sauce. I slowly added cornstarch/water mixture to the sauce as it simmered to make it more of a gravy which was fabulous. Made this twice in 1 week, once for my husband, once for my parents!

Makes really great chicken, though not for someone on a diet! This makes a really special chicken dinner, especially if you indulge in a taste or two of the skin. I had to use "Kitchen Bouquet" to get it a nice dark brown color, but that is just aesthetics. The herb butter should work well on any kind of poultry. Yummy stuff!

The chicken was delicious and tender, a big hit! I cooked it as a birthday meal for my mother and she loved it. I didn't like the sauce at all, however, it was too thin but despite that the recipe was incredible. I served the Parmesan Roasted Potatoes and Balsamic Vinegar Roasted Pears as side dishes as well and they were also a big hit.

Rating: 3
The chicken turned out extremely well and I really thought tthat the infusion of herb butter under the skin added marvelous flavor to the breasts. My only objection was that the sauce just didn't do it for me- not quite broth, not quite gravy, the kneaded herb butter just didn't thicken the sauce enough and ended up separating. Also, the herbs were just too strong in the sauce. The onions turned out to be little pieces of delicious melting heaven, and i had added white creamer potatoes, which roasted quite nicely along with the chicken. I would make this again, but perhaps adjust the sauce more to my liking.

i'm not a big chicken fan but this is the one and only chicken dish i'll probably ever make. i used an organic "roaster" chicken and it was so moist, tender, flavorful ... i couldn't believe it. the herb flavoring is simple but just right -- not overdone. i put a quartered lemon in the cavity with the herb sprigs. the cooking time was just about right, though i needed about 10-15 more minutes.

my boyfriend wont have anything to do with skin so i removed the skin and used a roasting bag... in the alteration i placed the garlic and onions in the cavity along with the herbs, perfumed the chicken wonderfully... ive made this many times now and definitely reccomend it to everyone

WOW! Best roasted chicken I've ever made. I've actually made this several times now. Just as a suggestion try adding carrots and potatos to the onion they came out beautifully.

I believe this recipe is a take off from a Turkey Recipe in Bon Appetit November 1998. Regardless of the bird, it tastes great! My only problem was that due to the high temperature, there was little juice in the roasting pan to make the gravy. I did get a lot from the chicken though! I used a 3 1/2 lb chicken and roasted for one hour. It came out perfectly!

Rating: 4
Without a doubt - the best roast chicken recipe you can make. Juicy, flavorful,well-seasoned and easy to make. I recommend using a good roasting chicken, as the depth of flavor is better (I've tried both roasters and fryers). This is also the start of terrific stock!!

Rating: 3
Everyone thought that the chicken was very tasty! I added a little chicken broth at the bottom of the roasting pan to keep the chicken moist. I will definitely make this again. One question - why would the recipe call for a 7 lb chicken to feed four people? I used a 3 1/2 lb chicken (and cut the recipe in half) and that fed four people perfectly!

I decided to try this in order to change from the dull way of roasting a chicken....the herbs did the trick. I grow fresh rosemary and Thyme so I used those and the meat was not dry but full of flavor and delicious. Now my family asks for this whenever we have a big dinner planned.

Yep!! Outstanding recipe !! Chicken was tender and had deep herb-roasted flavor. For me nothing is too rich, I doubled the butter mix, used 4 giant sweet onions, and about 40 cloves of garlic! Whoa !! The greatest ever. Impress your guests with this dish. Easy with exciting flavors !!

Really yummy and looked just like the picture. A great dish for company or family Sunday Night dinner. Will definitely make mashed potatoes next time--the gravy deserves them. Didn't have fennel, so substituted celery seeds. All other herbs from my flower beds; what fun! I did add enough water to cover the bottom of the pan after the first 30 minutes, and the onions still carmelized beautifully and my pan was easier to clean. Cooked the carcass in fresh water, plus the broth that drained from the chicken into the serving dish. Will use that today to make noodle soup!

This is the best roast chicken recipe, I'm making it a second time tonight. A kosher chicken makes a big difference with the flavor. Certainly try this one!

I made the chicken with fresh tarragon in the same quantity as the other fresh herbs instead of crushing fennel seeds (all of the called for herbs are growing in my garden). I added the garlic the last half hour and everything turned out perfectly. I made the potato galette and the orange dressing for the salad in the magazine and all these things were excellent as sides. Garlic mashed potatoes will be my potato side next time to go with the yummy sauce.

Delicious! The roasted garlic cloves just melted in your mouth - awesome. This was very easy to make and the chicken was extremely tender and flavorful. I had a 6.5 lb chix and I stuffed my with the herbs and stuffing. I also added some chix broth to the onions and garlic while roasting and basted everything with the broth/butter juices. Everyone enjoyed this very much.

We've already prepared this twice in the last month. The larger chicken is definitely preferable, though the smaller chicken still tasted exceptional. My husband got intrigued when he saw the recipe and it has become his project to prepare. He takes great pride in his achievement and declares it the best chicken he has ever had. I agree

Classic Sunday meal. This was very tasty. I will certainly cut down on the butter next time for it was a bit on the greasy side...especially in the sauce. What wonderful flavors! Next time I will add more onions and garlic. Those were delicious. Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Heavenly!

Delicious, juicy chicken. I used a 3.5 lb instead of a roasting chicken, and it turned out fine. I roasted it for almost two hours - maybe there is a problem with my oven? Forgot to pick up the chicken broth, and used brown gravy mix instead, and did not add the wine, but it was still delicious.

Ahhh!!! So Good. I used a regular 4 poundish chicken, and in the herbed butter, I used fresh rosemary, organo; dried parsley and thyme. I added baby carrots, and cherry tomatoes (towards the end). In addition, I only had beef broth on hand, so I used it instead of chicken broth. I served the meal with sticky white rice. The whole family loved it.

I actually screwed this up: I misread the recipe and saved only three Tbsp of butter. The rest I rubbed under the chicken skin (and then rubbed two Tbsp on the outside and over the onions). I didn't realize my mistake until after it was baking, so during the points in the recipe when it called for another application of butter I spritzed olive oil over the chicken instead (and used the last Tbsp of butter for the sauce). This turned out the most tender, juiciest chicken I've ever made. I think I'll continue to make this "mistake." Great stuff.

My friends raved about the chicken. It was absoluteky fabulous - and the smell while baking was wonderful. The next day we used the remainder for chicken soup....... This is the only way I will make chicken from now on
