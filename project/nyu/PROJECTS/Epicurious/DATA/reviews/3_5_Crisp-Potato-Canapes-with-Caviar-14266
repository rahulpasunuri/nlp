This went over big with my guests on New Year's Eve, including a couple of picky eaters who were wary of caviar. Used inexpensive American Whitefish caviar, and it was still excellent. The texture of the little potato base was great, and the potato taste didn't at all overwhelm the caviar. In fact, all the flavors complemented each other really well.

I had a weekend of back-to-back parties, and these were easy and a great hit at every party. By the second party, however, I cut out the work of making the cubes with indentations. Instead, I used smaller potatoes, peeled them into 1 1/2"-2" circles about a 1/4" thick. They worked perfectly fine as little hors d'oeuvre pieces on which to dab the sour cream, sprinkle the chives, and place the caviar.

Okay, so I overcooked the potatoes, which made them a little hard to shape (whups) but otherwise this was a super New Year's treat, with sevruga and a bottle of Dom Perignon. Had no problem keeping the boiled and shaped potatoes overnight in tupperware.

To ring in the New Year I prepared this delicious hors d'oeuvre as an accompaniment to the "Garlic Rosemary Marinated Lamb Chops" along with a fresh salad of Bibb lettuce, Asian pear-apple, blue cheese, and sugared pecan bits drizzled with a mild raspberry vinegarette. These tastey tidbits are a terrific introduction caviar.

I think is very good. Now as a professional Chef I know that the potatoes must be kept (if kept overnight peeled)in water and or milk inside a container that allows the liquid to cover the potatoes. This prevents the starch in the potato from dicompossing and turn the potatoe to a dark color.
