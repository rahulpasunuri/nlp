I really wanted waffles for breakfast but sadly found no eggs in my fridge. Luckily this recipe turned out great! I substituted the buttermilk for one cup organic yogurt (only had french vanilla at the time) and one cup skim organic milk. Whisked that together and used in place of the buttermilk. Crispy and yummy egg free waffles!

These waffles were tasty! I used sour milk (1T vinegar per cup of milk) and it was fine. I used strawberries instead of cherries and topped with plain, greek yogurt mixed with a little blue agave sweetener and vanilla extract. They were almost cheesecake-ish :) Great Sunday brunch!

THis was delicious. I was sceptical due to the no eggs, but it was fine. Crispy. Make the cheery sauce to go with it- delicious. Lefover cherry sauce was put over vanilla ice cream the next day-

This recipe just became my go-to waffle recipe. I didn't make the sauce, but the waffles themselves were excellent. I added blueberries since that's what I had on hand and they were wonderful.

I've never seen a waffle recipe without egg so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I really liked these and it was a great way to use up some leftover buttermilk in the fridge.

I only made the waffles, not the cherry sauce. For what they are - an egg-free waffle recipe - these waffles are excellent. There are better waffle recipes out there but if you can't use eggs due to allergies or just don't to have any eggs on hand on a Sunday morning, these are by the far the best you will get. Very, very close to real waffles. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used the Cooks Illustrated trick of squeezing a bit of lemon juice into normal milk and letting it sit for a bit.

O.k. so I only made the waffles but I can't wait to try it with the cherry sauce. The waffles were delicious (crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside) and were even better after the batter sat in the fridge overnight.

Excellent waffle recipe and delicious cherry sauce. I will make again and add a little more almond extract for s more pronounced taste. I skipped the whipped cream or yogurt topping- it was already rich enough.

I made this for guests at my B&B who don't eat eggs. Reading prior reviews I was somewhat concerned that the resulting waffle/pancake would be dense and chewy. While they were dense they were not chewy and my guests loved them. The point of the recipe IMHO is having an eggless yet edible waffle/pancake as an option for someone with an acute egg allergy.

I made this recipe for my family on Fathers Day and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it, and like the other ratings; if you're not crazy about the waffles you're sure to love the cherry almond sauce.

There are two kinds of waffles, as far as I know. One is the kind that uses beaten egg whites. To me this is a lighter waffle. The other kind doesn't use egg whites, or even eggs at all, and they make a dense chewy waffle. Me, I like the dense kind, so this recipe was absolutely perfect for me. If you like the lighter kind of waffle, you may not find it to your liking. But I'll make it again. And again! With the great sauce.

the waffle recipe here isn't right - i cook waffles all the time and these simply didn't rise or bake correctly. Sauce was delicious, though.

While the batter was quite thick, they were a good crunchy, not a brick-like crunch. As for the sauce, excellent, but adding a bit more almond extract would have made it outstanding! Filled us up for about 8 hours!

the cherry sauce is great!

I was surprised to see the average fork rating on this recipe. I made as written and thought both the waffles and the cherry sauce were out of this world. My kids loved them with whipped cream. To save calories my husband and I used plain yogurt and toasted sliced almonds. I thought this was a really nice change for a breakfast/brunch recipe. I have made this (3) times since the March edition of Bon Appetit was published.

I am only reviewing the cherry sauce. I used a different buttermilk waffle recipe after reading the reviews of this one. That said, the cherry sauce is amazing, and lightly sweetened whipped cream compliments it perfectly. I am not a waffle fan, but this sauce makes me want to make this recipe time and time again.

I've only made the waffles from this recipe as I prefer to eat them with simple strawberries and homemade whipped cream, but I thought they came out fine. An extra 30 sec-min in the waffle iron makes them crisp right up and I didn't find them excessively heavy....

I foolishly did not read the reviews before attempting these waffles, UGH! heavy, dense & texture of a brick. I whisked an egg into the last half of the batter making them a reasonable waffle. Did some one make a typo or error in the recipe? I would try it one more time with eggs from the top, we'll see, but as written NEVER!

I agree with the other reviews. These waffles were heavy and dense. Not at all what I think a waffle should be. Maybe if the batter was thinned with milk, but I would never make these again. There ar too many other, better recipes out there.

The waffle batter was very thick and the waffles came about heavier and less crispy than other waffles. But, they got a big thumbs up especially with the cherry sauce. A quick and easy breakfast!

I was also surprised not to see eggs listed in the ingredients. The waffles were tasty enough, but I prefer them a little crispier. The cherry sauce was good, and certainly quick to put together.

The sauce looks divine, but the waffle recipe looks altogether wrong. Who ever heard of waffles without eggs?

I was really excited to make these waffles, but was disappointed with the outcome. The texture of the waffles were chewy and thick/dense and not what I was expecting. Maybe it needed some baking soda or an egg to make it fluffier? After saying that I must say the cherry sauce is great with yogurt and the overall flavors were great.
