this is my go-to for amazing carne asada... i let it marinate overnight and add a little more garlic to taste but other than that - does not need much messing with. it does have a nice kick - lots of flavor! If you have trouble finding skirt steak - it is sometimes called flap meat.

Found the recipe in _Gourmet Today_, which called for marinating 30 minutes at room temperature. Very tasty meal with excellent leftovers. Made some substitutions, so am not rating the recipe. My substitutions: Flank steak-- more available than skirt steak but not quite as flavorful; 1/2 teaspoon stevia for the teaspoon of sugar; Chipotle Chile Pepper for Chili Powder; and Ras al Hanout (which contains allspice) for allspice. Friends have given me some wonderful spice blends, so I am trying to use them while they are still fresh instead of stocking up on every spice there is. I might have to break down and buy some allspice, though, because it is a very special spice, and I'll bet the steak would have been even better with allspice.

This was tasty and easy, a good recipe when you don't have a ton of marinating time. Skirt steak has so much flavor, the rub really helps it sparkle.

A favorite with my teenagers - I find I need to double or triple the recipe to have enough! Marinate in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. Also serve it with sauteed colored peppers and onions, guacamole, salsa, sour cream and tortillas. A definite keeper!

We've been making this recipe for 15 years in our home. It has become a Summer staple because it is so easy and tasty. We double the rub and use either skirt of flank. This recipe works on all levels - easy, quick weeknight dinner; perfect no stress vacation meal and fun Summer Dinner Party meal. Enjoy!

I also used flank steak and let it marinade for close to 2 hours. I served it with the grilled red/green slaw and a home-made corn/jalepeno/lime side dish. everyone loved it

Loved, loved, LOVED this recipe!! I used flank steak and let it marinate in the rub for about 2 hours. Served it with Avocado and Corn Salsa from this site and it was TO DIE FOR! Will definitely be making again!

i feel like i missed something. i followed the recipe exactly, other than quadrupling it. the steak itself was good because skirt steak is yummy all by itself, but the marinade/rub had very little flavor, other than a sort of chalky taste. i wonder what went wrong!

We loved this recipe. Served it along with the Mexican grilled corn recipe from this site, and they were wonderful together. Next time, I'll have some guacamole and grilled onions to serve with it. Great flavor. We'll definitely make this one again - it was so easy.

This was very easy to prepare. I used the recipe for fajitas and it was a lot faster than my other recipes that require marinating overnight and the flavor was great.

This was very tasty. I actually rubbed the marinade on two hours before we were ready to grill it and would definitely do that again. The only thing we would change is to cook it lower and slower. But really, this was very easy, very tasty - great even for a work night where you don't want to fuss around too much.

This was SO easy and SO good! A keeper! I used flank steak (a bit less fatty) and the tortillas are a must, really bring out the spices.

I just made this dish last night, and everyone loved it! My kids begged me to make it again tonight, but they ate it all. This dish has a Mexican flavor which kids tend to like but everyone, adults included, loved it. Advice: Be careful not to overcook the meat as it is a fairly thin cut of beef. I also grilled lots of veggies (onion, red and green peppers, mushrooms) to go along with it. Each person wrapped up their own sandwich. I also included cut up avacado and fresh tomato. It's a keeper!

Prepared for a crowd and placed in a platter with different compartments, so they could make their own fajitas. Had as accompaniments - sauteed onions and peppers, guacamole, salsa, sauteed mushrooms, tortillas. It looked festive and everyone enjoyed.

It was quick, easy, and delicious! I grilled some peppers and onions and threw them in tortillas with the sliced steak and avocado slices. Definitely will be making again.

Quick and easy and my husband requested I make it again. Yeah, easy marinade for steak. I changed the steak to New York.

Excellent! Used flank steak because skirt steak wasn't available. Replaced 1/2 of the chili powder with chipotle chili powder, and it added some heat and smoky notes. Served in flour tortillas with grilled onions, guacamole, and taco sauce, with beans & rice on the side. Husband is a bit picky, and he loved it!

This was my first time preparing a skirt steak, but I'll definitely make this again . I don't see this cut of meat often in my local markets, but when I do I'll snap it right up. Very flavorful, and the piece I got was quite tender. We are looking forward to having the leftovers in Fajitas!

This was so easy and it resulted in an excellent tasting skirt steak! I had the rub on for probably 2 hours. Served it with Latin beans and white rice. This will be a regular in our house. Will also try it on flank steak too.

MAde this tonite with a southwestern soukatash salad and there was nothing left! To die for!!!!

This is absolutely the best skirt steak recipe around. I've made it many times, and it's always a success. The allspice and cumin are wonderful. I generally serve it with avocados, roasted red peppers and sour cream so people can make their own quasi-fajitas.

Columbus finally has a Whole Foods Market so once again I can find skirt steak. To celebrate I went to Epicurious to look for a new recipe for a favorite cut of meat and as usual was not dissapointed. Nothing to change to this one, just needs some good fresh salsa,guacamole and refried beans to round a out a great meal that makes my husbands tummy happy! I also used some of the leftover marinade to make some great chicken for the next evening.

I made this recipe with rib eye steaks, replaced the sugar with nutrasweet, and broiled instead of grilled grilled the steak and it was delicious. I can't wait to try this rub/marinade with other steaks.

I almost didn't make this recipe because I am not a fan of hot and spicy food. However, this was so delicious and NOT hot at all. I will definitely make this recipe again and again because not only is it great tasting, but incredibly easy to make!

I used the rub on whole tri-tip and it was a hit at a party. One recipe per tri-tip (about 2#), put the rub on six hours ahead and refrigerated. As I was making a lot, I just used a processor instead of mashing the garlic.

GREAT flavor!! I used the marinade on beef loin boneless tri tip marinating it for about 1 hour - wonderful flavor. Do not GLOB the marinde on the meat because it becomes too salty and potent in spots. Definitely will be making this again

Great summer recipe. Grill some peppers and onions and you are all set. Also quick and easy. The only change we would make would be to add less cumin (and I love cumin); it overwhelmed the other spices.

Wonderful, a bit spicy. If you are to double, or as I do quadruple this recipe don't quadruple the black pepper or the garlic, add it in as you go. This is a simple recipe that can be made in the food processor. A must try.

My friends loved this steak. It's simply delicious and some even asked for seconds. (I served smaller portion than the usual serving) Definitely recommended for those who like their food a tad spicy. I imagine it'd taste even better if I'd put in all the ingredients. I'd left out the garlic and allspice. Great steak!
