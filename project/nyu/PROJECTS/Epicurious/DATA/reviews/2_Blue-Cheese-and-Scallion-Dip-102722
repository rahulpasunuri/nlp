My husband likes this, and I've served it several times to friends who enjoyed it. Very quick and easy to prepare. But no, it isn't spicy!

You need to add some Tabasco to this: it is too bland.

i may play with this to get a little more zip out of it. My 17 year old actually loved it, but others found it bland.
