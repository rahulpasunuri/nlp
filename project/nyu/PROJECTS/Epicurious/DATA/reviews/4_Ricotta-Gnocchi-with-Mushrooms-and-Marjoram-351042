Actually disappointing, but gave it 3 forks because I could have done things better. Really don't like marjoram - tasted like perfume to me - would omit in future. Dough is very soft and difficult to work with, would try refrigerating longer or even freezing a little. Liked the mushroom mixture and flavor of the gnocchi. Very labor intensive and messy, but I'll probably try it again with modifications.

Great gnocchi recipe, though I did add more flour (hard to quantify - maybe another quarter cup?). I ended up serving them with sauteed baby bella mushrooms and sage. Delicious!

This was a great quick dinner. My husband found the dish a little boring, but I thought it was great, very restauranty. I added a little cream to the sauce and used porcini salt (from the Spice House) to season after cooking. It probably would be a little more exciting with wild mushrooms.

Made this for family who are professional chefs. They were licking their plates! Very light and delicious. I followed recipe exactly as written. Will make again!

This was very light and easy to make. I did not like the appearance of the gnocchi after it was boiled so I fried it up in a little bit of butter to give it a crust. I changed up the sauce a little bit, so I am not rating it.

Tastes very good, but I agree with earlier reviews that the dough is too soft. I I'll make this again, but with another ricotta gnocchi recipe from this site that worked better for me: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Ricotta-Gnocchi-242001

The Gnocchi were perfection! I did add a bit more flour and let them sit in the refrigerator for several hours before I cooked them. In fact in all the years I've been trying to make Gnocchi, this is the best receipe I've found so far.The sauce---not such a hit. My husband found it lacking and unflavorful. Will make the Gnocchi but with a different sauce.

Used homemade whole milk fresh ricotta prepared with lime juice instead of lemon. Followed the gnocchi recipe exactly, mixing by hand. (My Parmesan cheese was the shredded kind, not the powdered kind.) Followed the sauce recipe using Italian brown mushrooms and substituting fresh basil for the marjoram. This recipe definitely is a keeper!

I made the dough in my food processor. It came out very sticky, so instead of going through the trouble of rolling out the dough and forming the gnocchi, I simply spooned them into the boiling water (1/2 tsp each). They looked more like dumplings but they were heavenly. I also added asparagus to the mushrooms and a bit of sage.

This is delicious!! I made the Gnocchi as directed with a variation on the sauce so I'm just reviewing the Gnocchi.

I love this recipe!!! I've used both the gnocchi and the sauce separately as well as together and all times, each element (and entire dish) was a hit. The ricotta gnocchi is decadent. It is helpful to freeze slightly first to help the gnocchi stick together when cooking. I have also tried the sauce as is (wonderful) and doctored it up with fresh sage and truffle oil (omitting the butter) at the end (added depth). Try the gnocchi with your own sauce and also try the sauce with your own recipe of potato gnocchi, which is also delicious!

I spent the afternoon with my two daughters making this recipe- we used store-bought lowfat ricotta, strained it and did end up having to use more flour than specified- but though the dough was fragile, did manage to make the lightest lovely gnocchi- they were not the most perfect looking but they rivaled the best in NYC - Sette Mezzo- Will definitely make them for company next time.

This is really good - DO NOT add more flour than instructed - if the dough is too sticky, add enough flour to the board when rolling out. These were very light and delicious.

Made this complete recipe as stated, even making my own ricota. Found this to be fun and thoroughly delicious. Had no trouble at all with the dough. It was easy to make and came out very light, almost melted in your mouth.

I made the sauce with porchini, oyster and shitake and forgot the Marjaram and it was amazing. Made the Gnocchi and although it was time consuming, it was well worth it. As I was only cooking for two, I froze half the gnocchi recipe...hopefully the will be as good when I make them again in a week or so..sure you can buy previously made gnocchi, but these are light and wonderful compared to heavy and too filling.

These were extraordinary. I made potato gnocchi once years ago and am still digesting them, so I approached this recipe with trepidation. But it was spectacular, light, creamy and with a good zip from the cheese. The gnocchi did need more flour than called for in the recipe. I used fresh ricotta from my deli and it did not need draining. Oh, and the sauce was so good it converted my son. He now loves mushrooms.

I made this and the previous reviewers are right - the sauce is awesome! I used dried marjoram and added it at the beginning with the liquid. I also used rehydrated dried mushrooms - about 4 oz. I also used store-bought ricotta. The previous reviewers are also right - this needs about twice as much flour as specified. Even then the dough is soft. With these changes I was able to make the dish from my pantry.

maybe i am missing something, used store bought cheese, but even with the chilling, was WAY TOO sticky to form anything but a messy glob. bought store bought gnocchi and used the sauce which WAS awesome. i followed the sauce exactly except for adding some fresh spinach with the mushrooms. with the store bought product the sauce was very good. wouldn't make the gnocchi again though..i have made potato versions before that were much easier and very tasty.

I made this for a weekend dinner and I started the ricotta on Christmas day, so the ricotta itself takes a few days. The gnocchi is good but did not wow me, it is definitely the soft kind of gnocchi I look for in the potato version. The sauce was good but didn't knock me out, though it is pretty straightforward to make. I skipped the second refrigeration step and just plunked them straight into the boiling water after the first chill. I believe trying with store bought ricotta for the gnocchi may cut down on some of the prep time. I will try that for the next time and save the homemade ricotta for a spread.

I made this last night for vegetarian guests. It was excellent, they loved it and we loved it and pretty easy to make, though somewhat time consuming with the refrigeration requirements for the gnocchi. Couple of tips:I would double the recipe though to feed four adults and a pre-teen next time. If you use store bought ricotta, skip the step where you put it in a strainer in the fridge - it already comes with the right consistency. Also, I found it requires a bit more flour than called for to keep it from being too sticky to roll. Otherwise, yummy. Well worth the relatively minor time hassle.

I used three kinds of mushrooms and the dish was delicious. My guests loved it. However, the dough is hard to mix by hand - the recipe should have suggested use of a mixer. Otherwise the dough is pretty trouble free.

this was a good dish, it did involve a fair amount of work though not really in making the dough.
