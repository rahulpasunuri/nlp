This is a fantastic recipe. I recommend marinating the short ribs over night. The suggested sauce was ok, but when I made it a second time I used a sriracha glaze and the dish got rave reviews. Sriracha glaze: 2 tbs Honey, 2 tbs Soy Sauce, 1 tbs ketchup, 1.5 tsp sriracha sauce, 0.5 tsp sesame seeds, .5 tsp brown sugar, a pinch of cumin and coriander powder

This delicious recipe translates beautifully to a pressure cooker, too! The ribs come out amazingly tender & tasty in no time. We simply brush the glaze on & pop them under the broiler when we're ready to eat. And served over garlic mashed potatoes or risotto? Ah, Heaven!

everyone from 16-96 yoa loved it. the sauce tastes odd alone but complements the beef. drained the meat; topped w. glaze and reheated for company so easy to make ahead of time.

SUPURB. I followed DC's advice and braised in the oven with the aromatics and cooled overnight. We had unexpected guests and not enough ribs so I cooked skinless chicken thighs in a dutch oven with same ingredients. Cooled, removed from bone and served with sauce. OMG. This is so good.

This dish is a showstopper. Stunning sauce. When you serve the dish, don't skimp on the sauce - ladle extra onto your guests dishes. i did change the cooking method -i have a small kitchen and needed the stovetop for other things. instead i set the oven to 275 and braised it for 3 hours in the oven, instead of on the stove top. (this actually helps the ribs keep their shape better that on the stovetop.) after braising, i let it sit in the liquid in the fridge overnight and then skimmed off fat and removed ribs from the cooking liquid the following day. in warming up the dish for dinner i removed bones and excess fat then sat the ribs in a baking dish, poured the cranberry-teryiaki sauce over the ribs and heated it so that the sauce would bake onto the rib. when ready to serve, i ladled extra sauce over each rib. Unbelievably tender. My guests absolutely raved.

This was very very good, sort of like a supercharged, multiflavored pot roast, although the chopping was a lot of work. I made entire quantity for Christmas dinner; received many compliments. Previous reviewers have the broth/glaze issue right: I chilled cooked (unglazed) ribs overnight, removed the fat the next day & removed all but a few cups of broth. Heated meat up to serve, glazing ribs using all the glaze, not just 1 cup. Also, used 1/2 short ribs on the bone, and half boneless, which gave me a bit more meat for my money, but kept the flavor from the bones.

This is quite tasty but a few comments: 1. It's not cheap (short ribs can be pricy). 2. Glazing at the end while the ribs are still in the stockpot doesn't really work. I waited to glaze until I removed the ribs at the end. 3. The key is really the glaze. It takes the ribs to a whole new flavor level.

Halved the recipe (more or less) and it turned out amazingly! Ended up cooking it way longer than 4hrs, but it was worth the wait! Paired the dish with wasabi mashed potatoes and garnished with chopped scallions...definitely a keeper.

Wonderful! I served this recipe for New Years Eve to a group of foodies. Everyone raved -- timing is a non-issue, so I enjoyed my own party. This is a definite keeper.

Made these for a New Years Eve party. Everyone loved them, meat was tender and wonderful. Followed recipe exactly, except it was a little confusing at the end as to when and how you were supposed to add the glaze. I prepared the ribs earlier in the day and kept approx. 2 cups of the stock with the ribs thinking that I wanted some sauce for over rice. While they were warm, I also removed as much of the fat from the ribs that I could. Some of the bones fell off, but I chose to leave them on the ones that were in- tact, so that they could be identified as ribs. Worked out great! Another note...DO NOT throw out the stock! It is so tasty and delicious. I skimmed off the fat, took out a few ribs for the meat and made soup. Another great meal!

FABULOUS! Very flavourful. The cranberry-teriyaki glaze was tasty but not too overpowering. I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted fennel bulb and lemongrass and I substituted dry sherry for sake. After braising 3 1/2 hours, I removed ribs from pot, dumped liquid and veggies, returned ribs to pot on med-low heat, and brushed with cranberry-teriyaki glaze just long enough to heat up the glaze.

This dish was fabulous! I served it on a snowy Monday evening and it was just what the doctor ordered. The cranberry teriyaki glaze is the perfect accompaniment. I served it with jasmine rice and the stir fried sesame asparagus (from this site).........YUMMY.

Perhaps jillianpie's disasterous results stem from using orange peel rather than orange zest. The recipe calls for orange zest. Orange zest means only the very thiniest scrapings off the surface of the orange skin. You must aviod the white part underneath which is the source of the bitterness. Zest shoud be completely orange in color - no white. I thought it fantastic.

This was fantastic. We had it for Christmas dinner. It was a little confusing about how to apply the glaze at the end. I drained most of the braising liquid and applied the glaze. Worked out great. I only made it for about 6 people, so there was a lot of funky math in getting the amounts down from 20 servings. Will definitely keep in the rotation. Ted

These ribs rock. They take time but what good short ribs don't? They had such flavor - layers of flavor and richness. I am making again this weekend for my in-laws. No worries about impressing them with this recipe.

I made these short ribs for Christmas this year and it was very good. I wanted to make it ahead of time so I followed the recipe but then cooked everything in the crockpot the day before, drained the fluid and took the meat off the bones. The next day I reheated and continued the recipe by glazing them. Good flavor, cranberry taste really came through and they literally fell apart, would definitely make again.
