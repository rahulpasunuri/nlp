There are a couple of things out of line with this recipe, if you want authentic Greek. Firstly, no respectable Greek would add Romaine lettuce to a Greek salad and begs the question&why? Secondly, anyone who has done the real Greek Tzatziki will tell you or should tell you that in order to obtain a tangy, creamy full bodied Tzatziki you need to do 2 very important steps before you go ahead and mix it all together. Step 1 the yogurt must be drained of excessive water. To do this, simply put the quantity of yogurt into a very fine sieve or cheese cloth and suspend it over a bowl to drain and catch the water.. It is by far better to do this in the fridge, overnight, but an hour or so will work pretty well in a pinch. Second, the same method should be applied to the cucumber; first thing is to peel it and then grate and salt it (who seeds a seedless cuke?). Put.the cuke in a sieve with a bit of salt and let it drain off the water, again the longer the better and when ready, squeeze the cuke of all its water with your bare hands. I suggest if you are planning ahead for the Tzatziki you can drain both yogurt and cuke at the same time. By doing this, your end result will be near perfect and not at all a watery Tzatziki, as was the complaint in a few postings here. By doing these 2 simple, yet important steps you will enjoy a Tzatziki that is truly beautiful. Oh yes, another thing. Keep in mind that this is an old traditional Greek recipe and I rather doubt the Greeks had processors back in the day&do not throw everything into a food processor, rather gently blend the ingredients with a large spoon in a bowl. IMHO. This entire recipe is a bit bogus with out said improvements. Enjoy&

This was very good! I bought all of the ingredients from Trader Joes. I used Persian cucumbers, strained non-fat yogurt, lamb tenderloin instead and added some Turkish BBQ seasonings to the lamb. Definitely will make again

What the sauce is missing is dill. My ex is Israeli and much of how this is made is correct. I rarely follow a receipie exactly, I make sure to tast as I go.

If you have ever been to Greece, and I mean not the ten-minute stop between flights, you will more than likely have tried a real kebab. This version is to "American", to make it better, use strained yogurt, Persian cucumbers, and skip the lettuce for the salad, no Greek salad has lettuce. Also, use lots of oregano and lemon on the lamb, salt at end of cooking, and some chopped onion and parsley, and finally, French fries are call vegetables when on a kebab in Greece, try it its good.

The lamb did need more seasoning, but was still geat! I used french grey salt. I did not make the salad, I went to PUBLIX grocery store and brought a ready made greek salad dressing (feta cheese, olive oil, peppers, and a ton of seasoning) GREAT BUY for only 5.00 dollars. My sauce turned out watery and bland. I will try again but drain the cucumbers the sauce is missing some type of seasoning that you would taste in any geek place.

This was pretty good. I added oregano to the lamb portion of the recipe, as previous reviews suggested, and I'm sure that was an improvement over the original recipe. The instruction to seed the seedless cucumber was just plain funny.

This is a great way to use up leftovers. I usually make it with the remainder of a roast leg of lamb and it's fantastic. The pita you use really makes a difference, IMO. Don't use the cardboard-like little pocket pitas you find in most groceries. Find the larger, pocketless Greek flatbreads sold in gourmet markets or delis. Makes a much better version.

Well, the lamb needed more than salt and pepper. I used an Italian seasoning (thyme, oregano, marjoram, rosemary, etc.) the second nite, in addition to broiling for only 4 minutes a side then frying with extra spices for a minute. The lamb tasted more like lamb (and not beef!). The sauce was good, but needs salt and pepper. The salad could have used a better olive, dark and greasy from andronicos would be better than the jar from trader joes. Pita bread. Now that's interesting. Pull it out of the oven and immediately make a small tear (with knife) where the cut will be made, then cut. If you just cut the bread in half, it will more than likely reseal itself alone the cut. Immediately open other sides of the bread or it will be difficult to open later. I did layers in the bread, lamb, salad, sauce, then lamb on top. When I go this on the left bank in Paris, they put in french fries also - really good! Note: use regular romaine lattice, not the hearts, too bitter (at least from trader joes).

I would give this dish a 3-plus if I could. Refreshing and delicious. I made a few changes. First, I used authentic Greek yogurt, which is much thicker than the usual. You can even get it in non-fat version and it is still the consistency of pudding (try Trader's Joe's for this yogurt). Second, I peeled and seeded the cukes and then salted and drained them for a few hours, squeezing out any remaining water. Chilling it overnight is critical. I even put a little fresh oregano in it -- YUM!

didn't have any yogurt on hand so just used sour cream which was ok as the sauce was a little runny due to that , but taste was fine. Am making this again with the yogurt, drained of liquid. And I could not find any lamb so substituted pork which I marinated in Greek dressing and grilled - it was delicious and will continue to sub the pork when necessary. Sliced the leftover pork cubes the next day and out onto the leftover Greeek salad and added more of the tsatsiki sauce - again very good.

Have not made this recipe, but to address a previous reviewer's comments about lack of flavor, it seems that the lamb is missing some oregano or thyme or both. My husband is of Greek ancestry and they put oregano in *everything* !

This was very yummy. I did change a few things though. For the tsatsiki I grated the cucumber, sprinkled it with some salt & let it drain for an hour. Also let the yogurt drain as well. I grilled the lamb & I added red onions & feta to the salad. A great summer meal & so easy.

The flavor was excellent yet is seems that it misses an ingredient that I have tasted at greek restaurants.

Very good and easy. However, I think the recipe provides too much salad and other fixings. If you start with good lamb you can really throw any "greek type salad" on top with some mint yogurt sauce. Quick too.

I haven't made this but I can tell you from a tzatziki expert, that's the wrong combo. Strain 2 cups of yogurt in a cheese cloth overnight, for the cucumber GRATE it and squeese out the excess water, then stir into strained yogurt the grated cucumber, 2 minced cloves of garlic and 1 tsp of red/white wine vinegar. Let flavours blend for 8 hrs. I strain the yogurt overnight and thn combine everything in the mroning before work and its great by the time i get home.

I wanted to try a different recipe for this than my usual, but unfortunately, I was not impressed.

I wanted to surprise my husband and make a Greek meal. I used this recipe along with another recipe I found for gyro meat. We both loved it, it was excellent! I made everything exactly as the recipe stated and won't change a thing next time either.

Excellent. I have made it with both yogurt and sour cream. I think the sour cream gives it smoother flavor. I also prefer a little more garlic.
