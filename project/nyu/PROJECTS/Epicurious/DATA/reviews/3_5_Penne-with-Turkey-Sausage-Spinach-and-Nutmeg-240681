I can't bring myself to eat whipping cream for supper so I omitted it and added 3 chopped tomatoes instead. Didn't have spinach so used frozen peas; didn't have parmesan so used gruyere; added hot pepper flakes and salt. A nice easy meal to throw together; would make again just because it's quite functional and easy.

Very, very good. My moody 13 year old stared at it for a full minutes in disgust (green stuff, you know), but finally ate it and sheepishly asked for seconds. I didn't have sausage, so just used 1 lb ground turkey. I added the red pepper flakes mentioned in other reviews and it was excellent! I would give it 3 1/2 forks overall, but you don't get that option here and would give it 4 for a midweek meal - especially for ease of production!

Halfway through I realized that this recipe was glorified hamburger helper (we made it sans spinach), but it was still yummy. The parmesan and the italian sausage added a really nice bite to it. I substituted regular milk for the cream and it still came out well. I wouldn't give this one 4 forks, but I'd still be very likely to make it again.

Didn't have turkey sausage so just used ground turkey and added red pepper flakes. Didn't have cream so used a jar of alfredo sauce. No other seasoning needed. We loved it. Even my picky eater ate it (without the pasta) Great way to sneak spinach into their diet!

An okay dish. Only used white ground turkey. Substituted rice pasta for the wheat pasta. Substituted yogurt for the cream. Used garlic, lemon juice, and pepper in addition to the nutmeg. I also used feta cheese. It had a nice twangy taste. Not bad for a dish featuring ground turkey.

Yum!! This makes a ton by the way. I only had 1lb of turkey sausage so I didn't put any ground turkey in and it was plenty of meat for us. The rest of the amounts I kept the same except for using 1/2 cup whole milk and 3/4 cup tomato sauce. (lactose intolerant in the house) My husband and I both really enjoyed this and except for destemming the spinach which always takes forever it's a pretty quick dish. Will certainly make this again!

I modified this recipe a bit based on previous reviews and the outcome was great. I omitted the ground turkey altogether, used non-fat milk instead of cream, and shallots instead of onions. I also added minced garlic to the onions. I drained most of the grease from the pan after the sausages were cooked, and it still had a great amount of flavor. I then added diced tomatoes and 2 tsp of crushed red pepper to the sauce, before adding the milk. Next time I would cut back on the nutmeg by a 1/4 tsp as it was a bit overpowering. I paired this sauce with whole wheat penne. With those modifications, this was a huge hit and I'll definitely make it again.

To be fair, I didn't have all the ingredients called for. To also be fair, no great meal is going to start with ground turkey - let's face facts. After reading several reviews, I substituted milk for cream. I didn't have any spinach either but, again, reality tells me that spinach isn't a deal breaker in any meal except maybe spinach salad. Followed the recipe and simply had to add garlic during the onion saute and then when simmering I added some chopped tomatoes. After tasting, it was so bland I had to do something - even it was mostly a visual punch. I started out looking for something to do with the package of ground turkey I had in the fridge. Lesson #1 don't make this again. Lesson #2: don't buy ground turkey unless you plan to make tacos.

Makes a pretty quick and healthy dish if you substitue the cream for milk and use whole wheat pasta. Also, I just used 93/7 ground turkey-no turkey sausage- and just added ground fennel and caraway seed to the pan, so as to not miss the sausage flavor.

On the surface, this sounds terribly interesting. In reality, it's more like "grown up hamburger helper." For what this delivers, it's simply too much work. Edible, for sure, but disappointing. Won't make again.

Made this with hot chicken sausage from Whole Foods because they were out of their turkey sausage. Also used Benedetto Cavalieri penne pasta that my daughter brought home from Bologna, which made all the difference. It was really delicious; my family is very eager for me to make it again.

Very yummy, kind of a new spin on a stroganoff. Easy and delicious. Would recommend to all.

We made this a lower fat dish by substituting milk for the whipping cream, and multi-grain spaghetti for the penne pasta. Also added canned tomatoes and cinnamon to the meat. I am always looking for something new to do with ground turkey and this recipe is now on my list! Easy to prepare and tasty!

I thought this recipe was pretty good. Although, to be fair I did not follow it exactly. We are not a big "cream" family so instead I added some marinara sauce. Also, I added cinnamon to the recipe as well, I think it supplements the nutmeg very well. The final result was tasty, but the flavor did not jump out at me. I would make this recipe again, but probably with a little less meat.

I deleted the turkey, added 2 minced cloves of garlic and 1/2 the amount of nutmeg. It was perfect and my husband loved it!

Wow! I made it almost exactly as listed, except I added cherry tomatoes. The flavors were excellent. Somehow, 6 servings turned into 3. We couldn't help ourselves. It's truly fast and easy. A cook from Hells Kitchen, NYC

We followed the recipe almost exactly. We used hot pork Italian sausage and no ground turkey. For me the tipping point was a small dash of garlic salt and some pepper and this dish was fantastic! Easy to make and surprisingly delicious!

This was a quick and easy recipe. I made it "almost" exactly as written. My family does not like creamy stuff so I just added a jar of my favorite marinara sauce (24 oz.) instead of the whipping cream. It turned out superb. I also used sweet sausages - the kids are not into spicy yet. Enjoy!

Come on...it's easy, good and quick! What could be better? I split the recipe in 1/2 and it was plenty for three children and one adult. I only used three sweet Italian sausages and skipped the additional ground turkey. Plus, I used whole wheat penne and replaced the whipping cream with half & half. We'll have it again, forsure!

I left out the sausage and added italian seasonings and it was very good. I think it would've been way too much meat with another lb. of sausage... Tasted even better the next day!

This was fairly easy to make, but had very little flavor. The sausage flavor is brought down by the sauce, so the spice is cut. I would add some grape tomatoes if I was going to make it again, but I don't expect to.

I didn't have turkey sausage so I just added basil, garlic salt, and italian seasonings and it was very good.

Used Louisiana hot sausages instead of Italian. Added a meaty, spicy flavor that was tempered well by the pasta, spinach and cheese. It tasted even better as leftovers the next night.

Previous reviewer said "no flavor". How can that be with spicy sausage, parmesan, and nutmeg?? I thought it was very tasty; great weeknight meal. Used a little less meat but we're big meat eaters so would have been ok with the full amount. Also used 1/2 heavy cream, 1/2 reduced fat milk.

I made this recipe over the weekend for a family birthday. The results were FABULOUS! Everyone loved it, super easy and delicious. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream. There weren't any left- overs for my husband and me because everyone wanted to take some home!

I made this last night. It was super easy (after working all day then making myself go to the gym after work, I NEED quick and easy!). It was and is DELICIOUS!!!! I could seriously eat this until I exploded and I'd be happy with the way my life ended. Next time I make it, I'm going to add some crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up a little, but either way, GREAT STUFF!!

Very good recipe! The nutmeg adds a nice twist to bump this up from a standard sausage and cream sauce. I was pleasantly surprised that it did make so much, as many pasta recipes make too little per serving. Didn't think it was too meaty, but it would be just fine with less. I added a generous splash or two of white wine, and the extra acidity helped to cut the cream nicely (poured it in near the end of browning the sausages). A great recipe for appreciative AND picky eaters alike!

Great recipe! Used shallots instead of onions. Decreased cream and substituted milk. Will definitely make again.

This actually could have been very good. I used chicken sausage, but it was terrible. Very strange taste. Normally I like chicken sausage, but this brand was awful. Could have really ruined the whole dish, but I ended up picking most if not all of it out. The rest of it was pretty decent. Definitely too meaty, as the other reviews said. I should have listened. Not sure if I will make it again.

Super good and super easy. The only thing you have to chop is an onion. As another reviewer suggested, you could definitely cut down on the meat. It is 2 pounds of meat for 1 pound of pasta, so it's very hearty. Also it makes a ton. Those would have to be 6 voracious people to make just 6 servings. That said we are happy to have lots of leftovers. One other note Cooking the turkey and sausage takes a bit longer than the recipe indicates. The meat gives off a lot of juice, and you want to cook that off before you add the cream.

Really great winter recipe, although turned out very 'meaty'. If made again I might use slightly less meat, perhaps 3/4 lb of turkey and sausages.

Writing a review isn't fair since I only used the concept of this recipe. Opting for gnocchi and no sausage, this was an adult version of "Mac 'N Cheese" As the other reviewer said, it's good comfort food. Kids will still like it, too. Mine - both under 8 - did!

made this for supper tonight. Great comfort food. Good dish for a cold night. I forgot to reserve the 1 1/2 cups of pasta water so I used chicken stock instead. I also used fat free half and half. Very rich dish.
