I LOVED this recipe. I used panko bread crumbs as well & was not disappointed. It came out great. Used Chilean sea bass & the result was terrific. Will make this again & again.

This recipe never disappoints. I use panko instead of bread crumbs and add some grated parmesan cheese to the crumb mixture. It also works well with salmon.

Loved this! Great flavors. I'm always looking for new ways for fish since we eat alot of it down here in SoFlo. I did substitute local grouper for the sea bass. I used about 1 3/4 lb for 4 people, cut the grouper into 2" (or so) thick slices. 2 other modifications: This only needs to bake for 20-25 minutes and I drizzled the vinaigrette over the fish too. Delicious!

I grew up in Hawaii, eating fish regularly so am really picky and so is my family. This was fantastic. My brother who usually just eats and grunts raised his eyebrows and said this is restaurant quality (whatever that means, he meant it as a compliment). 23 year old nephew was studying an hour or so after dinner and looked up saying "I keep thinking of that food!". The only thing I did differently was to double the vinaigrette as another reader suggested and drizzle some on top of the fish at the end.

Because sea bass is not only expensive but also on its way out of its existence on earth (due to over-fishing) I substituted Grouper instead which I would recommend, especially to those of you who think sea bass is a little on the rich side. I made this for a potluck and it was gone 3 minutes. The mustard is an "interesting" touch, I love it, but some may not be so keen. Definitely going to reappear in the future

This is THE most awesome recipe for seabass ever! I've made this a couple of times now and I always get rave reviews from company. Also, this is a really great recipe if you are having a dinner party for many people. Most of the work can be done ahead and all that is left is the plating of the food... A great first course is the leek, potato and scallop soup (also on this site) and for dessert flourless chocolate cake (from Trader Joe's) with port and or coffee.. yum. The only other thing I would note is that there is a definite difference between making this with fresh seabass versus frozen. I prefer the fresh even though it is expensive.. if i hadn't had the fresh first I probably would have been fine with the frozen but since I have, I'll pay the extra and use fresh....

I made this last night for dinner. While this dish was easy to prepare, and made a great presentation, I wasnt crazy about the taste. Maybe it was the mustard that I used, but I have just had better bread-crumb/fish dinners. Will not be making again.

I skip the leeks and potato part...but I LOVE the fish with the breadcrumbs and mustard (which I normally hate).It gives the fish an amazing flavor and texture and can be a very easy but tasty weeknight dinner.

This was outstanding! The marriage of flavors combined with a great cut of fish was perfect. The homemade breadcrumbs and vinegarette brought it together. A keeper for sure!

This was fantastic! I served it last night to a group of skeptics, some of whom apparently don't even like fish! (oops!) They all loved it, and I will definitely make it again and again. I will probably make double the amount of balsamic vinaigrette next time.

Made exactly as printed except drizzled balsamic vinaigrette on top of fish as well. I made this for a dinner party of 12 which included my uncle from San Francisco. He is a connessieur of fish and this brought tears to his eyes.

I thought this was pretty good. The rosemary was a bit overpowering in the breadcrumb mixture so I'd probably use less next time. I don't think the fish needs that much breadcrumb mixture on top since the flavors overall (the balsamic vinegar, mustard, rosemary, garlic, etc.) are very strong and can in some instances overpower the fish.

Fantastic flavor, but then, anything is good with fresh sea bass. Gorgeous presentation and quick preparation - you can have company over on a weeknight!

Have to say I wasn't crazy about the dish. It could have been because I had no Sea Bass and used another white fish instead. For this reason I will try to make it again. The mustard and breadcrumb mixture on the fish is delicious and can definitely be used on other fish recipes as well.

I usually don't make fish, but this turned out to be one great dish! Because my husband needs to watch his weight and cholesterol, I sauteed the scallions (no leeks around) in PAM. Also, I added a little water instead of the olive oil when making the bread crumb topping, and just gave the fillets a good spray of PAM before popping them into the oven. I used 2 tbsp of oil to 1 tbsp basalmic for the viagrette, and we found this dish was both healthy and delicious!!

Very good. Nice flavors and you could use any mild, flaky white fish. We all enjoyed it and the presentation will impress your guests.

Great recipe and a wonderful presentation when the fish, leeks and potatoes are stacked. Suggestions: I intensified the flavor by "enhancing" the mustard with a tsp of fresh rosemary, a pinch of salt, a couple of twists of fresh ground black pepper and a qurter tsp of sugar (cuts the acidity and enhances the flavor without noticeable sweetness). Also, I used dry vermouth instead of chicken stock to make a totally meatless dish and the flavor was terrific (thought of using fish stock but decided it might fight with the flavor of the bass). The vinaigrette was wonderful, but be sure to use "real" balsalmico di modena and not the supermarket stuff. jk new york

I made this for a dinner party on Saturday for eight people. It was a "for hire" party, so I didn't really get to taste the entire meal. From what little I sampled and the reviews I received, this was a hit. They loved it, but I did use extra fresh and wonderful sea bass. I will make this for my husband and myself soon.

Great, east recipe for a special meal. The bread crumb coating was simple but terrific. The balsamic topped it all off. Made with roasted garlic mashed pototoes instead and still great.

This recipe has become a staple of our dinner parties. The combination of the vinaigrette and Sea Bass is very interesting. I like the variation ideas in some of the other reviews and we will be trying these soon!

The dish was very good; I would reduce the amount of butter used to saute the leeks and reduce the amount of oil in the vinagrette, as I found it just a little heavy on the butter/oil. Otherwise, an excellent combination of flavors. The flavored breadcrumbs gave it a really nice "kick."

This has become one of my favorite recipes (both ease and taste). We recently made it and substited roasted potatos and red onions for the leeks and red potatos. My husband pairs this with a French white that perfectly compliments the flavors.

I agree with the previous reviewer. This was delicious and not that difficult to prepare. We had it on a week night. I reduced the recipe for two people with no problems. Definitely a must repeat.

Had I been able, I would have rated this dish as 3.75 forks! The first time, we made it without the potatoes, and served garlic mashed potatoes on the side. The second time, we made it according to the recipe. Both were scrumptious. This one was definitely worth the preparation time, and (because of the balsamic and mustard, I suppose)went surprisingly well with our favorite wine (California zinfandel).
