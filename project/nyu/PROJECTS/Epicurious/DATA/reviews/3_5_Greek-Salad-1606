My wife was not a big Greek salad fan, but we have had this salad 3 times this past week at her request. Used Paul Newman's Oil & Vinegar dressing. Prefect.

Very good, this recipe make a lot, so be prepared. I used only Romaine and made my own balsamic and olive oil dressing, but i reduced it to on half cup, it could be reduced even more though. Next time i will leave out the celery, i didn't think it fit the "greek" flavor. Also the onion could stand to be reduced a bit. But very good and very easy.

Great ingredients in this salad. I bought bottled oil and vinegar dressing and added the extra seasonings. I think next time, I'll make my own vinegrette with the extra seasonings that the recipe calls for.

Everyone loved this dish. My mom said she "could eat it every day." Even leftovers were tasty. Very easy to make, besides.

This is a great recipe! The dressing is so easy, because you can use a pre-made balsamic vinegarette. The dillweed really adds a great flavor. I used all iceberg lettuce, and it was very delicious.

Excellent. I added 1 clove of fresh garlic crushed in dressing then removed before serving, added lemon juice and salt while tossing, left out the lettuces and doubled the black olives and feta. Left the cucumber unpeeled and cut everything into bite size chunks. Among the best greek salad I have ever had. Also made my own dressing with 2/3 vinager and 1/3 canola oil and listed herbs.

I served this salad on a platter starting with the lettuce and ending with the feta. I didn't combine, just layered. It was very attractive. The salad dressing was very good only it had a little "after taste". I used Paul Newman's olive oil and vinegar dressing.

This is the best Greek Salad recipe I have ever come across. Even my children loved it. One large helping was not enough. I've made 6 times since the first time a month ago. It doesn't last. I used a red pepper for the bell pepper, & Italian Vinegar Dressing for the Vinegarette.

OK - but for Greek Salad lovers, here is the trick: crush 2 cloves of garlic into 1/3 cup oil and your seaonsing (I use fresh thyme). Let it infuse a few hours, then toss the greens in it. Be sure to salt your salad during the oil toss. MOST IMP! Then toss with your lemon and pepper and all the rest. Cannot fail - but must have garlic!

Salad was very easy to prepare and had a great taste. Made a nice side dish for the Sausage, Cheese, and Basil Lasagna found on this site. Used Ken's Greek Salad Dressing in place of the oil and vinegar but still added the additional spices.

This was a huge hit at the rehearsal dinner I threw. I didn't add the celery and I used whole greek olives. I put it all together except the lettuce the night before and added the lettuce immediately before the party. It really was fantastic.
