Come on, Man...you seed canned chipotes...while wearing rubber gloves? Why would you seed the chilies? Why would you wear rubber gloves? Did you really test this recipe? I think you're silly...

This salsa is fantastic! I disagree with the previous review that the charred tomatoes overpower the other flavors. Charring the tomatoes added an incredibly unique, almost smokey flavor that contrasted beautifully with the ripe mango flavor. Try this recipe with blue corn chips.

The charred tomatoes overpower and mask the other ingedients. The result is a stong taste rather than the delicate falvors from the other ingedients. In my opinion -- too heavy for halibut.
