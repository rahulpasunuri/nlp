Despite the negatives about the butter and oil, these are a nice splurge. I left them in the oven while the rest of the meal cooked and they were crispy and delicious. And yes; you have to turn the pan and toss them a bit per the directions. I thought the taste of butter is what made them so yummie. Portion control and frequency are always a good practice.

Cooked at 450º, the potatoes were done and VERY brown (too brown) after about 25-30 minutes. Next time I make these, I'll either lower the oven temp to 400º for the 45 minutes, or reduce the cooking time to about 30 minutes.

This is super easy, which I love. As with the other reviewers, I significantly reduced the amount of olive oil used - also did not use any butter. I simply drizzled a few tablespoons of oil over the potatoes and sprinkled with seasoned salt and cracked pepper. Yummy!

Great recipe! I kept the skins on and powdered them with garlic salt instead of seasoned salt. Amazing topped with melted cheese, sour cream, and bacon bits.

Very good. I would recommend using half the oil, butter and seasoned salt.

I made this for a Father's Day b-b-q and it was a huge hit! I doubled the amount of potatoes, but didn't double the butter & oil and it worked out great. Also kept the skins on as suggested by others. This recipe is a keeper!

As with many previous reviewers, I make a variation of this recipe, and so won't rate it here. I will say that you don't need nearly so much fat - I use olive oil spray, and a dry herb/spice rub. I usually line the baking sheets with heavy-duty foil, and turn them when half done. I prefer them to fries, actually. also, I leave the skins on!

I make these all the time. This recipe is a great starter. You can do just about anything with this recipe. I use only olive oil and sprinkle potatoes with oregano, basil, paprika and Romano cheese and, of course, salt and pepper. Also leave the skins on.

COOK FROM WICHITA, why give the recipe THREE-forks when you didn't follow it. You shouldn't have rated it at all like LITTLETON.

In case someone is thinking about doing these on the grill, it doesn't work that well. Made these last night, but tried to make them on the grill in an aluminum packet w/way less butter & oil. I won't rate them since I didn't follow the recipe. Will try this again, but follow the cooking directions.

I used less oil and butter and added a garlic/herb seasoning to the mixture.

Very easy and good. Everybody loves them. Leave the skins on and use convection oven @ 400.

Everybody loved these with hamburgers. Just tossed with a mix of salt, black & cayenne pepper and the flavor was awesome!

A nice change from french fries. My whole family enjoyed it. A little too much oil/butter - can cut down a bit. Otherwise, quite good and very easy to prepare.

Easy to prepare! Made these to accompany cheesburgers & got raves from dinner guests. Will definately make them again.

We make a similar version of these - only low fat. Instead of butter/oil, whip egg whites until frothy, add spices (we like cajun) and then toss with the potato wedges (cut thinner than the recipe calls for in order to still crisp without all the oil). Pour out onto a baking sheet or two coated with PAM. We've sprayed lightly with PAM or olive oil (via a mister) once during cooking in order to ensure browning. Very good, and you truly don't notice the difference.

This is a great side dish!! My whole family loves them. We eat them all the time.

Not exactly low cal, but easy and very good. Just be sure your oven rack is at least in the middle to ensure good browning. Every body enjoyed these. There is no question that I would make these again.

I halved the recipe. I thought it was OK. Next time, I am going to sprinkle some of the salt when taken out of the oven.

I make these all the time! Instead of season salt I use a little garlic powder, papper, rosemary and kosher salt. My kids just love them!

To the cook from Waterloo -- (or anyone else in the know): Is a baking stone the same thing as a pizza stone? Why don't you have to turn the potatoes if you use one? Thanks.

This is one of my staples. I use half russet potatoes, and half sweet potatoes. We think the sweet variety taste even better.

I used Cajun spice on my wedges. The best way to bake them is on a baking stone (you can get them from Pampered Chef). That way you don't have to turn them halfway through and they come out crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

I loved this. It was easy and fun.

I agree you don't need so much butter and oil, but shy of that these are simple and delicious. We always soak cut potatoes in cold water for at least ten minutes, dry thoroughly and proceed to bake them. This removes gobs of starch and keeps the insides from getting gluey. We use organic potatoes with skins left on. My family loves these.

Eh. So so. My potatoes burned by the halfway point, and turned rubbery. I could not taste the butter and oil, despite the exhorbitant amounts. I'll make another recipe in the future, one not so high in fat (or one WORTH the fat!!)

These potatoes get 4*s with revisions, 3*s as written. Use the olive oil, omit the butter, and leave on the skins. If you want, add 2 tablespoons of butter and reduce the oil that much. These are delicious.

Have been preparing similar spuds for years on the Weber (oven ok, too). Wedged potatoes with skins intact, overdose of chopped garlic, fresh lemon juice to taste, Montreal steak spice (available from Costco) and olive oil to coat. So simple and quite amazed at the requests I receive.

These were excellent! I halved the recipe for me and my husband(mistake)we could of eaten the full recipe they were so good.

These have only been greeted by rave reviews! I have tried these with paprika and seasoned salt for a very pretty look.

Excellent substitute for store fries. I served these with grilled crabcakes out on the deck. What a hit!

This recipe is also very delicious when you leave the skins on. Shortcut version: deep fry 'til they float, then drain well on paper towels, then toss with melted butter and seasoned salt. It will actually have less oil than baking it with oil. It also cooks a lot faster.

I was in a hurry and wanted to put potatoes in the oven with the entree. This filled the bill exactly. Thanks
