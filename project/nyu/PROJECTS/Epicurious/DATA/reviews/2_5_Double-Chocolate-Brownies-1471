No bad....¡¡¡¡NO GOOD!!!!. My own recipe is better. Brownies were just tasteless.

It turned out quite well. Make sure you don't overcook these brownies, for they cooked quite fast in my oven. They were a little time-consuming to make, but that's only because I'm twelve years old, and not used to cooking by myself. I didn't use any cream cheese, but the filling still turned out very tasty. Delicious!
