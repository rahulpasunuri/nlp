other than using italian sausage I followed recipe to a T. Needs more wine & 1 Tbsp. thyme is way too much!

This is always good! I make it even more "shortcut" and use canned white beans and leftover pork chops or pork loin. I also use turkey kielbasa and adjust measurements according to how much meat I have. The breadcrumb topping is delicious! This is even better the next day. (I know it's far from real cassoulet, but it works for me!)

This was wonderful and full of flavor!

Fantastic! Had friends in for dinner and it was a huge sucess. I took the advise of a previous review and used Italian Sausage instead of the kielbasa. Served with a greensalad and an assortment of breads. This is a keeper.

Very disappointed. I don't like kielbasa, so I substituted sweet italian sausage, but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It wasn't hard to make, but it was very time-consuming. I expected a lot of flavor, but unfortunately it was very bland. It's 'homey' and filling, but lackluster. When I reheated it the next day, I found it to be no better. I tried jazzing it up with white pepper, and even a few shakes of worcestershire sauce, but it's just blah. Definitely not worth the time it takes to make. Definitely won't make it again.

Cassoulet is always a labor of love, shortcut or not. Such a perfect meal on a cold night. Only change was to increase the oven temp to 375 for the last bake time and reduced the time to 20 minutes then finished it under the broiler for 5. Also added another can of diced tomato with juice.

I have made this every winter since it was first published! It is a wonderful dish to make when it is cold out, it makes the house warm and smell great! It is very satisfying and does make a whole lot. I don't understand how some people could say it was not worth the effort.....

I made this for a Super Bowl dinner, thinking it would be great because of the good reviews and ability to fix it ahead. A one-fork rating is for "just so-so", and that's just what I thought about it. Not one guest mentioned that it was good, so I don't think I was the only one with that opinion! Took quite a while to prepare (not much of a "shortcut"). Won't bother again!

This was the first time I have ever made cassoulet. The finished dish was absolutely delicious. I made it for a country French dinner party and served the cassoulet with a green salad followed by a rustic apple tart for dessert. The cassoulet is very hearty and will serve at least 10 people. Highly recommended!

We love this dish, and it has become our Christmas Eve dinner. We generally make it with half boneless chicken thighs and half pork, and we also substitute chicken sausage or italian sausage for the kielbasa. We generally freeze half for another cold winter night.

It does take a bit more time to prepare this dish than I expected. However, if you have the time on a lazy cold Sunday I would highly recommend making this dish. Great comfort food. Will definitely make this again.

Shortcut? Perhaps. I don't usually disagree with fellow reviewers but traditional cassoulet actually takes several days to prepare from start to finish if you confit your own duck legs, make your own sausages, and butcher your own meat as is typically done in rural France.

Rating: 1
Shortcut? You can certainly delete that word from the recipe. After all the preparation, the quanity was enough for two 2 quart casserole dishes, so I put half in the freezer. I may never thaw it out. This was at best just OK. Bottom line....a waste of time and effort.

A wonderful cold night supper dish! I had to make a few little changes to accommodate what I didn't have in my pantry. I used condensed tomato soup with tomato pieces instead of the tomato products in the recipe, and I didn't have any kielbasa on hand, so I just eliminated that. Browned the meat and put it in the crockpot, then sauteed all the veg lightly and added them. Tossed in dried beans and liquid, put the pot on Low and went to bed. The aroma was so fabulous the next morning that we ate the cassoulet for breakfast! I plan to make it for potlucks during the holiday season.

This dish is hearty, flavorful, somewhat healthy and perfect for a cold night at home with a good DVD. I'd eat it once a week!

Rating: 1
WHOA!!! Too heavy on the breadcrumb topping! ALSO... needed way more stock! I used beef stock, and that gave it more flavor, but overall, I did not like this "stew"...

A great dish for a cold night. It freezes well, too.

Yum. I halved the rcipe and had enough for 5 hungry eaters. I added a bay leaf and a sprig of sage as well, and I used fresh thyme(doubled the amount.) I also (as the previous review suggested) used the gourmet style garlic chicken sausage-great, and more subtle than kielbasa. The only thing I would change next time is to add more liquid, probably more stock. It only needs a salad and french bread.

Very tasty, everyone went back for seconds, and I still sent home leftovers in gladware--this recipe makes a *lot*! Used about double the chicken broth and a generous amount of wine and the consistency was perfect. I used half the amount of pork called for and made up the difference with chicken. I also ran out of dried thyme and substituted a fines herbes mix--yum!

Rating: 4
Fabulous! I added a couple of boneless, skinless chicken thighs after browning. Just great. This weekend we are going to make it again and watch Gigi, especially noting the part where Louis Jordan cancels a party because he cannot resist Maman's cassoulet.

Rating: 4
Absolutley wonderful! I substituted the pork for chicken (I don't eat pork) and added gourmet chicken sausage as previously recomended. Overall delicious, rich and looked beautiful and rustic! My guests loved it...I will be making this over many times in the future!

Always best when topped with duck Confit....

I've made this three times; this last time I did half lamb, half pork and used gourmet chicken & garlic sausage, all with excellent results. I used 1/2 C. tomato sauce instead of paste and 7 tsp. fresh thyme. One cautionary note: slightly undercook the beans; they should truly be "almost tender" otherwise they get very mushy during the second baking. I made this 2 days in advance and got terrific reviews from everyone. This is the perfect fall comfort food and great for a dinner party, as there's no last-minute fuss or mess. Great served with the following appetizers: Pissaladiere, blue cheese-pecan crackers; and pear, leek & gruyere turnovers.

Great comfort food, everyone wanted leftovers to take home which was no problem. I'm adding this one to my cookbook!

Very good, particularly the second day as leftovers. It does make a large quantity, so be sure and invite your friends over.

Every time we make this dish we get requests for the recipe, it has become a staple for parties. This dish can be frozen for a couple of weeks and tastes just like fresh when thawed out and heated up in the microwave.

I used leftover pork roast and canned beans so it was a quick process. I added canadian bacon and Kielbasa, potatoes, carrots,and pretty much follwed the rest of the recipe and it turned out wonderful, the whole family loved it

The more wine the better I say! I replaced some of the chicken stock with wine, and added some fine New Zealand lamb along with the pork. Being of the 'no tomato in cassoulet' school I left that out (the extra wine gives enough acidity to balance the richness), and put lots of fresh parsley in the topping, which gives extra depth there. A useful shortcut recipe, and not so coronary-inducing as the real thing.

Rating: 3
I like a deeper flavour, so I browned the onions till they were golden. Also the garlic (of which I used more). A useful tip from Mark Bittman's recipe in the NYT is to boil the beans with a couple of sprigs of thyme, half a head of garlic (not as overwhelming as it sounds!) and a piece of bacon. The cooking liquid can be saved and used instead of stock, as Bittman suggests.

Homey, rib-sticking, very tasty dish.

Instead of transfering ingredients to a bowl as they are browned/sauted, try using a crock pot. I assembled everything by noon and it had the afternoon for the flavours to blend. I also avoided some problems the other reviewers had regarding dryness and scorching. You'd also have to skip the topping or else transfer it back to a casserole and bake until crisp. Delicious either way.

Rating: 4
This is a GREAT!! recipe for a winter dinner party since all of the difficult work can be done ahead. I also found that it needed additional wine/broth before baking to keep it from being too dry. We served it with large salad, crusty sourdough bread and a good cabernet. Everyone loved it and asked for seconds.

Rating: 3
This dish was delicious! I only used 2 1/2 pounds of pork (otherwise the recipe wouldn't have fit in my 5 qt. baking dish) and I added 1 cup of wine before the baking time of one hour. I would suggest that additional liquid be added (wine or broth or both) before the final baking as it was a bit dry after it baked. Otherwise, it was fantastic!

Rating: 4
This must be the ultimate comfort food, but it is time and labor-intensive enough that we won't be having it often. I halved the recipe and it would serve 6 easily with a green salad and crusty bread. I did add some extra chicken broth during the cooking process when it looked a little dry. We loved this!

Rating: 3
Though I would rate this a 3, I think my partner might rate it higher: I got up this morning and found the casserole dish had been completely wiped out in the middle of the night! I'm freezing half, so we'll see how that works.

This receipe is easy to follow and is an excellent dish for a cold rainy southern day.

Make this dish a day in advance so the flavors meld together. Serve the next day for optimum gustatory enjoyment. A beaujolais or chilled Spaten accompany this dish fabulously. Don't forget the ruffage.

Be careful about burning this dish. Because the consistency is thick, you need to stir this fairly often.

This recipe wasn't hard to make just took a long time. I made it the day before I was planning on serving it. Turned out great! Wonderful fall/winter dish.

The recipe says it'll serve 8-10. We had 8 people for dinner and enough left over for my husband and I for two days! The dish is even tastier the second day.

It is a little bit of work, but is worth it. It is a delicious hearty winter meal. My husband is not a bean lover, so he rolled his eyes when I made this dish. To his suprise, he liked it! I will certainly make this one again.

My french grandmother would probably gasp at the idea of a "shortcut cassoulet," as her recipe involved preparing goose confit in addition to the sausage, pork, and beans. Her creation is delicious, but who has a week to confit a goose for a cassoulet? I prepared this dish to serve to the men (and boys) in the family as they were returning from a fishing trip. It was fabulous. It is more suitable as a hearty winter dish, but it was perfect for my cold and hungry fishermen this late spring! For guests, i would serve a salad of baby grrens, hot french bread, and lots of good red wine.

Although it was still a lot of work, it was great for a group of hungry skiers.
