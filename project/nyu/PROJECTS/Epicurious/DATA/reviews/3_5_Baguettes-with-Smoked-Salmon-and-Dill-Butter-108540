We found these difficult to eat. Everyone liked the way they tasted, but we ended up eating them open-faced. Perhaps the baguette I used was too big; there was just no way to bite into them. No one had seconds, and many went uneaten.

Great party hors d'oeuvre with champagne. Watercress unavailable, so used individual baby lettuce leaves. Really requires the best available ingredients.

The key to this recipe is use the finest ingredients, and plenty of them. Don't skimp on the dijon or the watercress. I've also used arugula. Make the butter ahead of time, and you can assemble these right before your guests arrive. Easy and delish!

WOW, this was great. So easy, and so delicious. They flew off the platter at my baby's baptism brunch.

These were easy and really tasty. I had the grocery store put the baguette in their bread slicer then spread the dill butter I'd made the day before on each round and put a piece of salmon on top. Fresh dill is a must - I used even more than was called for and used the rest for garnish. These flew off the tray - I wish I'd made more.
