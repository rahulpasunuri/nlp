I'm not sure whether this merits 3 or 4 forks - giving it 4 because it's such an intriguing technique. I used skin-on boneless chicken breasts and reduced the roasting time by 5 minutes. Very good! Chicken was very moist and flavorful.

This is so easy to make, and so delicious and moist. It's become one of my family's favorites. Yummy with just about any accompanying side dish. I throw in some garlic powder, too, but it's great as presented.

I didn't use the spices on this recipe but used the cooking technique for my chicken. The chicken was so moist and tasteful. I put butter and spices under the skin of the chicken and spices on top rubbed with oil. Also, after it cooked, I turned it over for the 6 minutes to cook the rib side. Used bacon fat in my iron skillet to crisp the skin and boy I'm glad I did. This recipe is differently a keeper. My chicken was larger than this recipe so I adjusted the cooking time.

my kids (ages 20 and 22) say I hit it out of the park with this one. I cooked it on the gas BBQ. I put the chicken on the direct heat for 10 minutes, then turned off the burner under the chicken. I kept the BBQ temp at 500. Moist and delicious. A definite keeper.

this chicken it the BOMB and super simple. i butterfly, rub it down, stick it in the fridge overnight, then cook it the next day. who has bricks in the city? I wrap a cast iron skillet with foil- perfect, heavy weight.

A terrific recipe. Nest time I might add some cayenne to the spice mix. I definitely would make it again. This summer-on the grill!

This was really terrific. The spice blend is awesome. I used a cast iron skillet and 2 bricks. I cooked the chicken with the bricks for 30 minutes and then removed the bricks, flipped the chicken skin-side up for about 6 minutes and that really crisped the skin. It did not smoke as much as I expected. Definitely a keeper -- very fast and easy.

For some reason my chicken did not crisp up, perhaps because I used 2 non-stick cookie sheets, but it was incredibly flavorful and super tasty. What an excellent spice blend. I will definitely make it again. I have an infrared grill, so I thought I'll try it there, may be with cornish game hens for individual servings. this recipe is absolutely delicious. My husband and 8 year old were licking their fingers!

We make this pretty often in our house, YUM!!!!!!! It's also great with bone-in thighs, but not as great with bone-in breasts because of the lower crispy spicy skin-to-meat ratio, LOL. The keys are: * the rub sitting at least 12 hours * preheating the pan/skillet & the other stuff you use to hold the chicken down * use a metal pan on bottom and a metal pan on top, weighted with a brick...the contact with the metal is what makes the skin crispy...I tried it using a stoneware plate held down by a brick but the skin didn't crisp up as nicely; you need the hot metal touching the chicken! You can also cover your stoneware plate with foil if you must before putting the brick on top...but use one you don't love because one of my plates cracked from this. * YES, it is 500 degrees for 1/2 an hour * You can also do it on the grill, just don't open the top while cooking! * DON'T TRY IT WITH BONELESS PIECES OF CHICKEN! They get reduced to hunks of charcoal at that heat.

To Kimcam....a former chef friend does this on the grill - puts the cast iron skillit and bricks to preheat on the grill and saves the mess in your oven

This was delicious, but I had some difficulties. The skin (the best part!) was sticking to the roasting pan, even though I gave it and the chicken a good coating of olive oil. I had to scrape up the skin and sort of put it back on the chicken for serving. It didn't look very good but it was tasty. Also, I'm not sure i would make it again because it made a huge mess in my oven.

When I covered the chicken with the spices, I was concerned that it may be over-the- top, and I wouldn't taste the chicken. I was wrong. This recipe yielded a moist, delicious chicken, beautifully browned, and wonderfully scented with the spices of Northern Africa. I served it with couscous flavored with garlic and a hint of curry, and a side of sauteed squash. This was very easy to make too. It's a keeper.

Even though I didn't let this chicken "marinate" for 12 hrs. (more like 2) it still came out great. I also had one smelly brick so I would urge anyone who plans to try this recipe to do a test run with their bricks beforehand. I had one good brick and had to use a heavy small pan as a substitute for the other. Nonetheless the chicken came out crispy and had a wonderful flavor from the spices. The cooking time at 500% was exactly right. I'll make this again with 2 good bricks.

This was Ok only. No problem with the recipe, but my brick stank up the kitchen horribly and our gas oven doesn't really get to 500F. So it took an hour and then all this liquid came out of the chicken and sogged everything. I would recommend the spices, but if you can't get your oven scorching roast it the normal way.

I think this is the best chicken dish I have ever made! I cooked it at 500 degrees and it was perfectly crisped and extremely flavorful.

I am in complete agreement with awaring! 500 degrees for the oven. I used skinned & defatted thighs. No bricks, so weighted with a cast iron skillet over foil. Let the chicken rest a bit before taking off the foil. The diners did not believe I had removed the skin. The seasoned crusty outer and tender inner chicken made us all very, very happy. It is also good for lunch, cold or room temperature.

Boo Hiss. Crispy, huh?

Just follow the recipe (yes, that means cook at 500 degrees), and you will get some fabulous chicken! My husband and I made it for Easter, and everyone raved about it. The flavors are very North African -- complex and delicious.

Well, it would require an hour's cooking if it were 350 degrees, so if it's only 30 minutes it must be at least 450. I'd try it tonight if it weren't for the 12-hour stand time!

I am intrigued by this recipie except for one thing; at what temperature are we supposed to bake the weighted chicken for 30 minutes. It can't be 500 degrees, can it? Or is that why it is called "High Heat"?
