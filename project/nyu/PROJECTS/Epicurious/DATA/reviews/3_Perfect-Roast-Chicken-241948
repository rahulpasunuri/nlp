Good roast chicken recipe. I made it with orange instead of lemon and used all olive oil instead of butter. I put some carrots on the bottom of the pan and roasted them - they came out great. Made rice as a side dish. Good Sunday afternoon meal.

I have made this recipe many times and it has always turned out nice and juicy. I'm too lazy to baste, so I don't. And I throw in a half head of garlic into the cavity. Aren't the reviews supposed to be your opinion of the results of making the recipe?

I disagree with any chicken recipe where the chicken is A) basted and B) cooked in an oven over 350... 15 minutes at 550, then an hour, hour and a half at 350 results in an amazingly golden and juicy chicken
