This recipe is just okay. I much prefer the recipe on Epicurious for Red Chile Sauce (Chile Colorado). I am generally altering recipes to tweek them. The recipe for Chile Colorado did not need thing, as the page is still blank from a lack of scribbles!

Great as is, but even better with a little boost. Try to add a little more heat, maybe chipotle or even habenero. The heat is great and the flavors are all the more pungent. A modified keeper for sure.

Here is my favorite recipe via red chili sauce: Braise a 4-5 lb shoulder roast for about 4+ hours in the sauce (do include garlic, cumin, oregano and salt). Shred the meat and continue to simmer in the sauce 30 min. longer. Use this meat with some queso cheese and cilantro to stuff poblano peppers (burn the skins off or pre-soften in a microwave, and do remove the seeds). For authentic rellenos, dust the stuffed peppers in flour, dip in egg and fry quickly in oil. I'll also take the leftover braising liquid and thicken with rue, adding salt and pepper to taste with a pinch of sugar and more cilantro for a great gravy over the top.

I must agree with the person from Belen, New Mexico.And for pete's sake use REAL garlic. Also on this site is a fabulous recipe for Red Chile Sauce (Chile Colorado)which I reviewed. My advise is to double or triple the sauce and portion into freezer bags.Great for last minute uh oh company has come a callin with little or no notice meals.For true gourmet Mexican food lovers use a couple of big Rib Eyes cubed. Soft tortillas, your chioce of condiments, and your in heaven!!!! Spent 25 plus years in Tucson, Az. so this ain't no bull.Adios Amigos...

Hello. I took this recepie and converted it to the authintic way of doing it. I was born and raised in Belen, NM 1941, Grew up on a farm growing NM chile. Raised by my grandparents on a 10 acre farm with chickens,pigs,cow and a horse. I tended 2 acres of of chile. NM # 9, Jalapeños and Habernos. Now Chile sause can be made in several ways. The authentic way is to roast the pods prior to boiling them. In a hot oven (we used a wood stove) :) on the middle shelf place all the pods you are going to use. roast 30 to 50 seconds on each side. remove from the heat and place in them to cool a bit. Remove stems and as many seeds as you can. Place into a large pot of boiling water and boil for 45 min to an hour. Remove pot from heat and set aside. In anoter large pot put 4 cups of cold water and the chile pods and once cool enough to hande by hand, start to crush the pods removing the meat of the pods and discarding the skin. Chile sause should not be made with skin on the pods. You get a bitter taste. Follow the recipe and continue if you like. If not contact me at robert_abeyta@yahoo.com or IM me any time from 10:00am EST I'll show you the way to make the best red mexican chile sause.

I grew up in New Mexico. This recipe is missing 2 key ingredients. To make red chile sauce, add cumin and oregano (1/2 -1 tsp each) and I would skip the dried garlic, just use fresh. I don't strain the blended red chile I just simmer it on the stove for several hours until soft. Traditional Carne Adovada is pork simmered all day in red chile sauce.

I had really high hopes for this recipe based on the other reviews, but I thought it was terrible. I even used hot New Mexico chiles, as we love spicy, but the dish was bland and lacked much of any flavor. Oh well.

As good as the Mexican food restaurants here in Phoenix, where we like it hot. I used the hot New Mexico dried chili, but only 2 oz. Instead of soaking and straining the chilies, discard of stem and break in half to rid of seeds, then grind in that second coffee/spice grinder you have. Now you don't have to soak, drain, puree or strain. This will be made repeatedly in my house!

One important step needs to be added to this recipe. You MUST strain the chile sauce after it is blended with giant sized tea strainer. Other wise your sauce will be filled to small bits of chile skin and any seeds that were inside the chiles.

I used a 4 pound pork roast and used the mixture as a filling for pork tamales. It was excellent and easy and I will make it again.

Authentic. Great. I did cook the pork and longer with the sauce the whole time and garnished with lime slices, cilantron, and scallions.
