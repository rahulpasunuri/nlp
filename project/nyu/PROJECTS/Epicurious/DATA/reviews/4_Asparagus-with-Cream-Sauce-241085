Tasted great; my picky husband devoured every last crumb and even scraped the leftover sauce out of the pan. The only difficulty we had was figuring out how to eat the concoction. We finally just folded the toasted bread with ham, asparagus, and cream sauce inside like a bizarre, somewhat messy sandwich. Not good for refined company but great for a quick dinner using minimal ingredients. I prepared and cooked this in under ten minutes.

My mother used to make a recipe like this 40 years ago! She used toast cubes and a white sauce atop cooked (frozen) asparagus. I still make it, but using fresh asparagus. It is simple and delicious comfort food!
