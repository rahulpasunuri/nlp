I'm making this again and I see there are no reviews. Well, I had it years ago at my sister-in-laws and I raved about how gourmet it tasted. She told me where to find it and I've been telling people about it ever since. I mixed it in the food processor. Great because after mixing, it made it into a manageable ball that I laid out onto plastic wrap, rolled into a log and threw it into the freezer to chill while I get the chicken and asparagus ready. It goes great with salmon, chicken, veggies, whatever. It is my go-to herb butter. Try it!
