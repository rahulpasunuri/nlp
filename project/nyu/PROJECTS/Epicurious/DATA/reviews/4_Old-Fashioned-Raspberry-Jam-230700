I wanted to try this recipe this weekend and was wondering if there is a way to make this jam seedless without too much difficulty?

I only used 3 cups of sugar, as recommended, but the damn stuff;s been boiling away for half an hour and failing the spoon test. Not that there's much of it left now. Any tips?

I give this recipe a high rating because it and all the comments lead me into some research. 4C sugar is way too much unless you wave the jam over your toast/biscuit, etc. That said the amount of sugar to use depends on how long & where you're going to keep the jam. If you want it to last a year, the minimum amount of sugar is 3 cups.http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/agri-foodindustry/foodlabelling/Labelling%20of%20Jams,%20Jellies%20and%20Marmalades.pdf Using less sugar is fine but the jam should be refridgerated and used as soon as possible. No sugar jam lasts about a month. That said...My ingredient list was: 1C blackberries 1C blueberries 3C raspberries juice of 1/2 lemon (approx 3T) 2C sugar (warmed) 1/2C honey The berries were crushed before they were put in the pan. After the sugar was added, I boiled for 10 min when the temp was 218F. It never made a thick set but was the consistency of jello. Jarred it & boiled for 10 min because I'm paranoid. It may not be a thick jam but it tastes really good. I'll let mine sit for a few weeks before opening a jar. 5C of berries yielded 5 1/2 8oz jelly jars. Next time I'll use 6C of berries. For anyone who wants to do research, the National Center for Home Food Preservation is very helpful.

I made this today. It was my first time making jam. It turned out great. I did use less sugar as advised and added some lemon juice because I like it tart. Very easy and delicious. Check out FoodieBecomesHer.com to see exactly how I did it.

I loved it! I'm glad I read the reviews first I would use a cup less of sugar then told. It got so many complement's and I give the recipe to everyone.

WAY WAY WAY too much sugar though the prep is good. In general I'd use between 1/4 - 1/2 of the suggested amount, 3/4 for sour fruits. I can't emphasize this enough. I used sour blackberries for one batch with the suggested amount of sugar and it was too sweet. Made another batch with half the suggested amount of sugar for raspberries and it was almost inedible because it was so sweet.

The keys are to use enough (but not too much) sugar; and to keep an eye on the spoon test. If your raspberries are of average ripeness, then a 1:1 ratio of berries to sugar is appropriate. If they're quite ripe, you might reserve 1/2-3/4 cup sugar and see whether you actually need it. It's not just a matter of sweetness; higher sugar content raises the boiling point and activates the pectin. If there's already a lot of sugar in your berries, you won't need as much either for taste or texture. In fact, it'll get hotter faster and could scorch. f you're a first-time "jammer," you can always slow down the gelling process by turning down the heat. Imagine corn syrup or honey rolling off a spoon - you know how, when the stream stops, it begins to come off in looong drops? That's what you're looking for. Lemon juice is a good idea (also has some pectin). @ A.Cook from Ohio: I've made no-pectin-added jam from strawberries (takes longer), blackberries, blueberries, and sour cherries. The strawberry jam was fine, but because it has to cook longer you trade that off with losing the body of the fruit. If that's not important to you, then try the stirred jam!

I love to cook but must admit I have never made jam before now! I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. No trouble getting it to gel - I was about 6 minutes. Also added a couple Tbsp of real lemon juice. That said, I was surprised at how overwhelmingly sweet this jam is. Again, I'm not an experienced jam-maker, but would definitely cut back on the sugar next time.

To everyone out there: Please, please pick up a copy of the Ball Blue Book (about $6 at WalMart) and read the basics on canning, especially related to elevation adjustments needed. You must add time to processing for increased elevation and you might be surprised at yours. Be informed to stay safe!

Yummy. Gel stage is 200-220* F!

This was by far the best result I've had in making jam. I used blackberries instead of raspberries -- absolutely perfect!

Having never made jam before I made the mistake of letting it boil (too long or too hard??) even though I followed the directions to the T. I had raspberry taffy. I was able to correct this the next day by reheating it and adding water. I was using it immediately so canning was not an issue.

Could any of you describe the consistency of this jam? I find it virtually impossible to get a firm (not sticky) gel without pectin. I have this book and like the concept but really am not convinced that the jam sans pectin or longer cooking time sets up very well.

This is really a wonderful recipe. The ease of prepartion is the best I've seen. I love this recipe.

Delicious! I added 1/2 a cup more fruit and the juice of 1/2 a lemon because we like tart jam in our household. The warmed sugar is the way to go and I'll use that for my other jam recipes from here on out. Fantastic flavor.

Would this work using strawberries? Strawberries are plentiful where I live and for me to buy enough raspberries for this recipe, it would cost me anywhere from $12.00 to $16.00.

This was good but can be even better with only 3 cups sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice. Process for 10 minutes.

would it work with less sugar

Yummy, but I think the recipe should state to crush the berries before measuring, otherwise it's too sweet (or at least it's too sweet for my tastes). Otherwise, pretty much idiot-proof!

WAY too much sugar. If you want to actually taste the fruit, cut down on the sugar. 1 cup was plenty for my taste.

I've always been intimidated by making jams but this was easy and perfect. I only had 2 cups of raspberry's so i adjusted the sugar accordingly and it made a perfect small jar of jam.

I followed the recipe's method precisely and it came out great! I did however use: 2 1/2 cups sugar, & 5 cups raspberries- superb taste and plenty sweet enough. Had it at a rolling boil for 5 minutes and it gelled/set up just fine. **I read elsewhere that the raspberrie's pectin is in the seeds, so I made sure to crush the seeds against the bottom of the pot as best I could with the potato masher.

This is my first attempt at ever making a raspberry jam, and it turned out delicious! I also used home-grown raspberries, and crushed them into the 4 cups. I boiled it for about 7 minutes and I don't think it has completely jelled. I may try boiling a bit longer.

I have been making jam for 40(!) years and this is absolutely the best Raspberry Jam I have ever made. It is fool proof. I pack the berries into my four cup measure, so I believe I am actually getting more in than the recipe intends. My yield is 6 half pint jars.

So what is the processing time? Is it hot water bath? Must one buy the book to know?

I've been making this recipe for years and it's consistently fabulous. As much as I don't advise messing with jam proportions, after I had been making this for a while, I started crushing the fruit BEFORE I measured it, which gives it a more intense raspberry flavor and makes it a little less sweet. It takes 5 to 6 cups of berries to make 4 cups of crushed berries. You may have to process it a couple of minutes longer before it gels, but it will gel! My name is Barbara and my friends nicknamed this "Babsberry Jam." FYI, Ms. Topp and Ms. Howard are also the authors of two other excellent books on small-batch home preserving, Put a Lid on It and More Put a Lid on It.

Very good. I added juice from one large lemon to 11 c raspberries and 10 c sugar and it turned out great. I agree with several others about cooking time taking longer. Mine took about 30-40 minutes.

I love this recipe for spring and summer get togethers! I've used blackberries, strawberries and raspberries and always get a great result. When I have guests, I serve it with assorted soft cheeses and crackers. It always gets great reviews.

Great & simple. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and got a great tasting product. I grow my own berries and they are very sweet.

Don't cook it too long or it will turn to rubber! Follow the recipe and don't listen to reviewers who say to cook it longer -- this ruined a whole batch for me!

You cannot beat the ease of preparation. However, it did turn out a little sweeter than I prefer, so I'd agree with another reviewer in adding lemon juice. For the batch of 4 cups I would add at least 2 tsp.

Awsome recipe. I did 20 cups of Raspberries to 20 cups of sugar and also added 1 cup of fesh lemon juice just to be sure. Boiled raspberries ofr a good 12 mins then added sugar and fruit and boiled for another 30 mins.

This is fantasic! This year was my first time making jam or jelly. Recipe was easy to follow and make. Followed the recipe, jam set up right away. Excellent flavor. We have had guests over and they love it -- they went home with some!

Heavenly flavor. I usually make strawberry jam with just sugar and berries and this was even better! Obviously you have to cook it longer than it says to but it is worth it. Also warming the sugar is not recommended- it forms a crust and is hard to get in the pot. I used fresh picked berries and the taste was fabulous. I will definitely make this again next year, but not warm the sugar (believe me it will dissolve just fine). I wish I had a lot more.

great!!! Just like Grandma's. I did have a tough time figuring out how long to process preserves once jars are filled and in water. Wish that was clearer.

I had never made jam before, but this was FANTASTIC. My mother helped me and said she'd had lots of problems getting jam to set by adjusting the sugar in recipes with pectin. We did this and the jam started to set within minutes of starting to cool. It was so easy and tastes delicious...Just like the fruit. We also tried raspberry strawberry and blackberry always with the same ratio. Perfect. No need to buy store jam again.
