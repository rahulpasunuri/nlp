Very good, pretty and easy. I had dough rolled out with marzipan and made plum sauce before dinner. After dinner, sliced plums and put tarts together and baked them and voila! Didn't know about "grated" plums, so just chopped small and it worked fine.

These are beautiful tarts! The puff pastry with the sliced almonds around the edges looks wonderful and the tarts taste great. (Epi needs a photo because they are beautiful!) I couldn't find plum jam, so I used the jam we had in the refrigerator (blackberry). Turned out great. I think peach preserves would be good, too.

In the interest of time, I just used a purchased plum butter and omitted the fresh plums. It turned out great. It was presto desert in 25 min with no effort and the leftovers make a great breakfast for the morning.

Yumm! I used pluots and divided into twelve servings.
