This was good not to sweet and easy to prepare. Very straightforward. I didn't have any coriander so left that out. I thought the lemon buttermilk sorbet was the perfect addition to this desert. Will make this again.

The crisp itself is pretty mundane - and pitting those cherries is a lot of work for the end result. BUT the ice cream is extraordinary. Tangfy and refreshing and smooth and so easy. I've already tried buttermilk as the basis of one with chocolate and orange juice, which was also great. Try this!

This review would be better if I had followed the recipe as it was published, but as a cook for a health food store, it was necessary for me to substitute maple syrup for the sugar, and soy shortening for the butter. We must have very small apricots here because 16 whole ones weighed in at only 1 1/2 pounds, but when cut and pitted they were equal in amount to the cherries. We really liked this crisp because: 1. it was not sickly sweet, 2. it was extremely easy to make, and, 3. our choice of granola contained sunflower and sesame seeds which added a nice crunch to the topping. We do not offer items such as sorbets, but the crisp was a hit with our customers.
