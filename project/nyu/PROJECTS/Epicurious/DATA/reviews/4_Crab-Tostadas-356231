Used recipe for as an appetizer for a party of 50. Doubled recipe. However, made homemade potato chips on my French mandoline to serve crab upon with the avocado. Very refreshing recipe. Perfect for summertime. Used for salad the next day. Great with the old-school 1973 recipe for Sangria. I don't suggest messing with the recipe.

Not the best way to use crab, not sure why everyone thought this was such a winner. My spouse liked it more than I did but she wasn't that impressed either.

I rarely give a 4 fork rating, but I must for this one! Amazing. I did make a few changes, however. I made guacamole instead of just avacados and I went with the cheaper claw meat. Other than that, no changes.

This is basically crabmeat mixed with pico de gallo. Good but not great - I don't get the rave reviews.

I made these exactly like the recipe and they were a big hit. I was nervous about the fact that you do not take the seeds out of the jalapeno pepper. The crab meat definitely has a kick so be careful if you don't like spicy. Here is the best part: I bought those Tostado brand "scoops" and filled each one with the crab mixture. Perfect for a party. It made plenty for a party of 10. I will definitely make it again and jumbo lump crab meat is the key

Maybe I just don't like crab served this way, but we really were not crazy about this. Not enough "mexican" and too much "crab" for my taste.

Absolutely brilliant - Served it at a summer party to rave reviews! Had a ton of requests for the recipe.

This was light and zesty. Perfect for a summer salad or appetizer if served in small portions. Keeps well, too, so can be made ahead of time.

Delicious! I did not want to pay for fresh crab so I used Mahi (grilled, marinated first in Sesame teriyaki). I added 2 minced fresh garlic cloves, 2 serrano chili's insead of jalapeno. My husband said, please, can we have this again soon!

This recipe was great! Pretty simple, and very zesty and summery goodness. I bought imitation crab meat because the only other kind was frozen and I didn't really want to deal with a block of frozen crab, but I don't think it tasted as good as it could have. I will make it again, but I plan to hunt down the good stuff before doing so.

I made these on Friday evening - however, I did make a few slight changes. 1. I went to buy lump crab and decided I did not want to spend $36 on just one ingredient. So I used 1/2 lb. imitation crab and lobster meat each. I put on a set of rubber gloves and broke up both packages into smaller pieces. (Next time I would like to add some grilled shrimp to see how that would compliment the dish). 2. I used shallots instead of red onions. 3. I added some spicy Cajun spice mixture to the final product. 4. I used the zest of only one of the limes not both, but I did use the juice from both limes.

I used the cheapie claw meat, and I added some chili powder and cumin to spice things up. This was SO good. Perfectly light and tasty for spring and summer. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is absolutely delicious, and incredibly simple to prepare. One of the best recipes I have run across on this entire website! I think it would make a fantastic appetizer on scooped chips as well.

This recipe tastes like summer! It's fresh and light - loved the lime zest! Made as directed with one exception - I used imitation crab flakes - rough chopped (due to the economy real crab was not an option!) So GOOOOOD!

Very quick, light, and super tasty. Great for an appetizer or light summer meal. Flavors work wonderfully together. I tried making tostadas myself for the first time per the recipe, and since I had some corn tortillas on hand, turned out wonderfully! So tasty!

Fantastic! everyone loved this recipe - I added a garlic clove and used about 4 jalapenos to give it a bit more flavor - and i thought that 1 lime + zest was plenty!

This is quick and delicious. I used a serrano chile instead of jalapeno because I had it on hand and it worked fine. Instead of prepared tortillas, I bought a package of fresh tortillas, quartered and fried them in canola oil. They held up for the couple of hours betweenn preparation and being passed during a school jazz band event. Also, I placed thinly sliced avocado on top with the cilantro garnish because it looked nicer. I agree that the lime is the key to the bright flavor.

I made this recipe for lunch and it was simple,quick and absolutely delicious. I love the flavor the lime juice added to it. I couldn't find any tostadas so I just bought the fresh corn tortillas and fried them in oil and it came out perfect. I will definitely make this dish again. Thanks so much for the recipe.
