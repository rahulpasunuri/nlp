I made this with asparagus and served it together with the soy/ginger lobster (Dinner under the Stars menu that this recipe appears in). Frankly, it didn't stand up to the lobster (which was great btw). Now maybe I haven't given it fair chance (might be better with green beans) but I would only possibly try it again with a milder main course (ie. a simple white fish or roast chicken) so that the citrus flavours come through. Hope that helps someone!

Excellent sauce! Could be used for asparagas.

This is a nice way to serve fresh green beans. I would probably cut back on the stock (I used vegetable) by about half, or allow it to cook down a bit more next time.

Pretty tasty. Be careful with the zest, it will burn quite quickly.

Did not boil the beans, worked very well. Made this with Pan-Seared Tuna with Ginger-Shitake Cream Sauce and Wasabi mashed potatoes. Delicious!

This went so well with teriyaki marinated flank steak-I did substitute faux butter(South Beach Diet restrictions) and couldnt tell the difference. Light and easy.

Really good. I used tangerine and lime because I didn't have the suggested fruit. I also omitted the butter. Great recipe.

Excellent! Also works great with broccoli.

I was excited to try this recipe as a change of pace. I love fresh green beans, but I must say, I was a bit disappointed. The favor was nothing special. This is the only recipe from Epicurious that I did not care for. Oh well, onward and upward!

This is a delicious. Light and tastey. Made the leftovers into a salad with cherry tomatoes and fennel drizzled with lemon juice and olive oil. Yum

This dish was easy to prepare- all the ingrediants were already in my kitchen. My dinner guests complimented the lightness and the hint of citrus with in the beans. Although, I don't think I used whole teaspoons of lemon/orange rind though. Will certainly make again!

Very good, very light and very fresh tasting. It is certainly a recipe I will make again. Next time, however, I would reduce the butter to 1 Tablespoon and the chicken stock to 1/8 cup (i.e. to reduce the liquid a bit).

A very quick treatment for greenbeans, I used frozen Haricots which I steamed in the microwave before tossing with the sauce. Delicious

Puzzled by the comments about too much garlic in the recipe; the ingredients are perfectly balanced and the garlic is ever-so-slightly there. I cook the beans ahead of time, drain them and then they can either be left at room temperature for a couple of hours or placed in fridge until ready for final steps. Delicious, light, lovely presentation - goes well with nearly all main courses!!

My new favorite way to make green beans. I served them with roasted salmon and a corn and rice dish. Perfect! My guests loved them as well.

My guests felt that the garlic pervaded the dish. I love garlic but the beans have too fragile a taste for the overwhelming taste that the garlic gives this dish. If you do make this, you may want to consider cutting down on the garlic.

Yum! What a wonderful way to prepare green beans. It's quick and easy and delicious. I prepared it as a side dish to go with vegetarian meatloaf and mashed potatoes and it was perfect!

This was very good, but I would probably not use so much orange zest next time, as I am not an "orange" kind of person and much prefer lemons. I will make it again - it was a nice change from the usual green beans. We served it with grilled leg of lamb and a wild rice pilaf, and it was a perfect meal!

This was good but did not bowl me over.

Great recipe for green beans. Lots of flavor for such a simple recipe.

Very tasty, very easy. We really enjoyed the citrus twist of this dish. It was a simple recipe that we could have during the week, yet elegant enough for company. We had it with grilled herb chicken breasts--delish!
