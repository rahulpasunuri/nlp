Definitely toast the pecans for better flavor - otherwise, a very easy, very delicious and quick summertime dinner salad! A keeper.

Easy and delicious recipe as is. The only thing I did differently was to toast the pecans first. Yum! Definately double the recipe, we all wanted more.

This recipe is so delicious and fast. I added some endive for a bit of extra cruch and used a gala apple, which added some nice tartness. I also, as another person suggested, used shallot instead of onion. It really adds to the tangyness of the dressing. A new summer favorite!

A wonderfully delicious salad that's perfect for warm weather days! It's easy to make and the zesty-but-sweet vinaigrette complements it beautifully! I was out of pecans and substituted them with dried cranberries as another reviewer did which gave it an interesting texture. I also put shallots in the vinaigrette in place of regular onions, which I think added to the "zestiness". I highly recommend doubling your recipe since this salad in one in which you'll want seconds! It also tastes like it would be good in a wrap sandwhich or pita pocket. Hmmm...I'll have to try that.

This is a really tasty salad. The dressing is perfect and the pecans and blue cheese make it sublime. I used Maytag Blue. One thing, though--be sure to use a high quality smoked turkey. One time I used Stater Brothers (Southern California) smoked turkey and it was inedible. Boar's Head smoked turkey is excellent. I've also used feta cheese which my kids prefer. Toasting the nuts makes it even better. I've made this salad so many times that it's regular fare at my house. Give it a try!

Looking for a tasty side salad, I decided to leave out the smoked turkey, and add dried cranberries in its place. It was a definite hit, and is now becoming one of my signature dishes.

Great salad! I used Gorgonzola instead of Blue Cheese to appeal to a wider variety of tastes for a potluck, and it was wonderful.

This is the kind of refreshing tasty salad I expect in upscale restaurants. I used Mesquite smoked sliced turkey from the deli.

If you love blue cheese (like I do) this recipe is for you. The blue cheese, apples, and pecans are all very wonderful and varied tastes for your mouth. I have made this salad multiple times and we love it each time. Its great for lunch or for dinner on a hot night. Try it! You'll like it.
