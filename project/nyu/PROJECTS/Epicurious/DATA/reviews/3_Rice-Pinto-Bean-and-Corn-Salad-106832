This recipe turned out great when I made my own salad dressing - the olive oil/red wine vinegar looked far too boring and not the least bit Mexican. Lime juice, oil, garlic, cumin and cayenne is what gave it a nice Mexican flavor - and tons of fresh cilantro.

I think all those people who rated this "bland" didn't let it set overnight before eating. I increased the green onions to one bunch, used less oil (about 1/2 cup), increased garlic to 3 cloves chopped, and used black beans. It was GREAT; took it to a potluck and was a definite success.

I made this salad for a party and it was a big hit! The only things I did differently were to use frozen (and thawed) corn and to add a little lime juice (half a lime for a double recipe of the salad) to zest up the flavor a bit.

Nice way to incorporate lots of fresh summer vegetables. Perfect for groups.

One of my favorite salads. You can make it ahead and it tastes better the next day. Simple, easy and quick: and perfect for taking on a picnic.

This salad is fantastic -- kids loved it too. I used fresh cracked pepper and lots of salt and it wasn't bland at all. And, it made a beautiful presentation.

This is a quick an easy dish that can go a long way (filler for burritos the next day for example). I agree-it is a little bland, but a nice dish to try different flavors with.

Easy, healthy, great for parties--it's a great dish. It is a little on the bland side, but so easy to adapt to other flavors and tastes: I used green beans instead of corn, next time I will add marinated mushrooms or roasted red peppers. It is great to top off w/ shredded cheese as well.

I made this for a crowd and it was a big hit. Tastes great with grilled meats.

I am with the blah-say-ers. Not having read the reviews I too thought to add extra green onions and lots of cilantro. It's like the dish that wouldn't budge from blah-ness. Totally disappointing to have a big bowl full of something so mediocre and so unfixable.

I made this for fourth of July weekend and it was excellent. I didn't find it bland at all. I substituted dried (cooked) cranberry beans for the pintos and red rice for the regular rice, which gave it a beautiful color and a bit more fiber and texture. Will definitely make again.

very good picnic and pot luck dish.

Blah, blah, blah! This dish was very bland. I served it with the chili-glazed shrimp with tomatillo sauce and it just didn't hold up next to that superb dish. I'm not sure that anything could fix this dish, and it is definitely not worth trying.

Easy to prepare - nice to use for a BBQ or Cook out instead of the standard potato salad or coleslaw.

I also thought this was really blah. I made it as a side dish for Red Snapper tacos (a recipe from Epicurious). I grilled the corn and the red pepper before adding them to the dish and I also added some cilantro and extra green onions, but it didn't help. I only used half of the oil, but it still had a greasy taste to it. Not at all the light, fresh-tasting side dish I had hoped.

I made this to go with the Chili-Rubbed Shrimp and Tomatillo Sauce and it was a good foil for the spiciness of the shrimp. Everyone loved it!

This salad needs lots of creative additions from its chef. I made the dressing and found it to be very bland so I added garlic, cayenne and some chili powder. It was inevitably tasty, after all the additions, but I was very disappointed in the recipe as written.

I made this to serve with the cherry cola ribs (same issue) and was very pleased with the outcome. I think not cooking the corn and just allowing it to steam with the rice added a nice, sort of sweet flavor to the dish. It was perfect for a dinner on a hot summer night in Phoenix. My husband and I both liked it and I will make it again.

Easy, colorful but bland. Recipe unclear about the corn. I think the corn should have been cooked first then addedto the rice. I did add cilantro & jalapeno pepper to give it some flavor but it was lacking something.

Very easy to prepare and very tasty! A great summer salad. Served it with the grilled chicken in mojo sauce (also in same Bon Appetit issue).
