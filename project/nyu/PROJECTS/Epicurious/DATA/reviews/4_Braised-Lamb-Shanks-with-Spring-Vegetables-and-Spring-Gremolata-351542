Excellent, easy, and beautiful! I made it for my family but I will definitely put it in the dinner party rotation since it can be made a day in advance. LOVE IT.

Such a delicious recipe. I used the whole bottle of wine instead of 2.5 cups. I deglazed the pan with a 1/2 cup of wine after browning the lamb because some of the flour was sticking to the bottom and then poured the remainder of the bottle in after sautéing the vegetables. I also braised everything in the oven at 300 degrees rather than on the stove top. The lamb was beautiful and positively falling apart. I did find, however, that 18 minutes of parboiling the potatoes was not enough time and they were somewhat undercooked.

Superb! Used dry vermouth as wine, and added a touch more towards the end. Perfect.

Great recipe. The gremolata is so fresh and lightens up the meal. I just did the shanks with an isreali couscous dish and hericot verts. Didn't puree the sauce - loved the added texture. Served for guests and they raved!

This is a fantastic recipe. It's not difficut to make & the end result is to die for. If you don't like mint with lamb (& who doesn't?) use Italian parsley. The lamb was succulent & very more-ish. Mmm mm !

Made recipe just as written and it came out fabulously. We got the key ingrediants from the farmers' market this morning, including the lamb shanks, and herbs from our garden. The Northeast Kingdom of Vermont is a hotbed of locavores and this recipe hit the jack pot.

YUM! Really tasty and not too time-consuming. Odd, but my husband and I both thought it tasted a lot like our fave roast beef recipe. Super-unctous, yet fresh with the gremolata. Did not puree sauce, it was melty enough. Also, had to add more broth and wine as it cooked down to prevent burning. Super tender and sure to please. Could be more unusual, but a a good tasty preview to spring.
