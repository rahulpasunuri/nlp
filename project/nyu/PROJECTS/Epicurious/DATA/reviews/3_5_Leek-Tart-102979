This is a fantastic recipe. Delicious and very french. I also used the whole leek as others did - seems such a waste. The green part is surprisingly tasty. The slab bacon is what makes it - find a good one. I might cut down on liquid next time, as I found it over filling my pie pan. Will definitely make again.

I substituted a handful of smoked gouda for the creme fraiche, because I was lazy. It was totally delicious but in such a rich way that I was literally comatose afterward with cholesterol. I will absolutely make this the right way some time, and my way as well.

I love leeks, but usually throw away the green parts - found this recipe that calls for them (I actually just used the entire leek). The green part tastes BETTER than the white part - soft with a little texture, mellow flavor and not as "oniony" as the white part. I cut the eggs down to 4, reduced the milk a little, and it came out perfectly. Also - can I emphasize how much better a homemade pie crust tastes than a pre-made one?! Great for brunch with fruit.

Delicious. FYI...the green part of the leek is excellent and very usable despite what American recipes say. Look to europe for inspiration on how to cook with vegetables.

I've made this tart several times -- it is one of my tried-and-true recipes. It is fantastic, and (even better) it accommodates substitutions beautifully. I *highly* recommend using the green parts of the leeks. Once cooked in the bacon grease, they soften and offer a contrasting texture to the tart. Throw in the white part of the leek, too, if you want -- but it'll cook down a bit. The bright green color and slight texture is part of what makes this tart amazing! Like any quiche-type food, as long as there is enough fat, it doesn't matter if you don't have the specified combination of whole milk and creme fraiche. This time, I only had cream (not even milk!) and 3/4 c. of this liquid was all that was needed. This would go great with a simple salad. Oh, and don't worry about pre-baking the crust. That step is absolute unnecessary if you're using a standard pie crust recipe.

Fairly quick and delicious! I used all of one very fat leek all the way up to the point where the leaves separate. Made a whole wheat pie crust, used the suggested 6 eggs, and instead of creme fraiche, used cultured sour cream. Rich, tasty and perfect with a salad. My husband and little boy ate every bite.

Delicious. I had to make substitutions, and still it was fantastic. I used turkey bacon (we don't eat red meat), the white and light parts of the leeks, light sour cream instead of the creme fraiche, and then I found that I was out of milk so used half and half instead. I only used 4 eggs and it was still nice and puffy and light. Served with a salad of butter lettuce and beets with a mustardy vinaigrette and it was like a perfect little bistro meal. Easy to make too.

I've made this dish twice now and loved it both times. The first time I cooked the leeks in bacon fat but didn't use any bacon. I also substituted light sour cream for the craime fraiche. Delicious.

I had some leftover leeks from my chicken soup and used them for this recipe. It was actually quite tasty!

Great recipe, great for guests, and wonderfully French. I agree with another cook though, I used the white and light green part of the leeks, I just can't bring myself to use the tough outer leaves like the French do. It is a little more tender and flavorful this way. I don't recommend substituting the slab bacon because this is what really makes it.

Quite good, and a good way to use the green tops of leeks. If you don't care for quiche, though, you won't care for this.

Delicious. I made this and several other tarts as part of a Mother's Day brunch and while they were all great, this was the hands down winner. I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche and the white and pale green part of 6 leeks.

Very Good. I made this and the wild mushroom tart for a party and they were both very delicious. I used a premade pie shell instead because of the convienience since I was making 4 tarts all together and the recipie turned out great.

I made this for company and everyone loved it. I do think there's a mistake in the recipe. It calls for the green part of the leek and I think it should be WHITE part!! I have never tried a recipe calling for the green part of the leek. The green part is very tough.
