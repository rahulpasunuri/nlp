This was very good and will make it again. I took the suggestion from others and added red pepper flakes (I like some zip), plus a little lime juice. Brined the chicken, rinse/dry & spooned oil mix over (recipe makes only a small quantity of oil), then let it sit for 5 minutes and grilled. Drizzled remaining oil mix over before serving. Salt was just right for me. Great flavor. Next time maybe add 1/4 tsp nam pla. Served with coconut rice and stir-fried broccoli. Yum!

I took great liberties with this recipe so maybe it's not fair to rate it 4 forks but it was great. I did not have tumeric but added chili flakes. I also added a generous amount of honey. After grilling we shredded the chicken up to use on a "Thai pizza" (with peanut sauce) but the chicken was so delicious on its own I will make it again to serve solo.

This dish is very tasty, albeit a bit oily. I followed through completely on the recipe one time and served it with noodles in peanut sauce and I thought it was too sweet for my taste. I would probably serve with rice or something less sweet next time.

I added brown sugar to the spiced oil mixture and marinated it for a couple hours. It turned out so amazing, it was juicy and had fabulous flavor!

This is a delicious dish. I just remove the chicken from marinade, pan-sear it and then add the left over suce to pan and cook it to make it safe to eat with the chicken, pour it over jasmine rice with sugar snap peas....soooo good!

My husband is a picky eater and he loved this dish. I did not have any peanut oil available and used olive oil. It was still great. Next time I make it I will be sure to try it with peanut oil.

This recipe is TASTELESS with a capital T. There is no flavor, no taste and no salt. It is definitely not worth wasting your time (as little as it might be) making this. I definitely will never make this again.

Instead of serving the reserved oil mixture on the side, I blended it with some rice wine vinegar, and poured it over green beans (steamed then run under cold water), sliced radishes and red onion.

This dish was delicious and easy. The oil kept the chicken moist and the mix of flavours (garlic, peanuts, ginger etc) was great. I was a little hestitant about serving the reserved oil wit the chicken, so I didn't but maybe next time I will, I just wasn't sure about pouring oil over the chick.

WONDERFUL! I made this last night. I did what others suggested and added some crushed pepper. I also marinated it overnight and I served it with the the coconut rice recipe. I will definately make it again.

Maybe I did something wrong... this recipe did not turn out well. I'm a fan of Thai food (we have several good restaurants in town) but this tasted strange and I wouldn't make it again.

I made this last night, doubling the recipe and found it to be very tasty and easy to pull together. You don't need to marinate it for hours to get a great flavored chicken. I also added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper to the oil mixture for a little zip. I served it with rice pilaf and roasted asparagus. Mmmm...I'd definitely make it again.

This recipe was easy & good. I added red pepper flakes to the marinade for a little zip. Served this w/roasted garlic couscous w/2 kinds of olives, roasted red bell peppers & fresh basil.

This receipe was very tasty. The chicken breasts were moist, flavorful, and exotic tasting. You can tell by the ingrediants that this would be good. This was also very easy to prepare. We served it with rice (with some of the excess dipping sauce poured on). My husband added a squeeze of lime to suit his taste and enjoyed it equally.

I made this tonight and it was great . I accompanied it with some thin spaghetti tossed with purchased ginger peanut sauce and stir fried broccoli. Very easy and tasty.
