Oops ... posted this on vinegar sauce review. Sorry! It is a coleslaw review ... Not your typical cole slaw, but an excellent addition to pulled pork. I used siracha instead of the different peppers, and it was really yummy. Not sure I would want it by itself, but with the pork it is GREAT!

I believe this recipe is intended to be made and served in concert with pulled pork and give it 4 forks because, as an "also ran" to the North Caroline Pulled Pork, it is perfect.

In the context of a topping for the North Carolina Pulled Pork sandwiches, this slaw is perfect. A coleslaw with a mayonnaise based dressing would not work, since the pork has plenty of fat to go around.

Boring and bad. Look for a better slaw recipe.
