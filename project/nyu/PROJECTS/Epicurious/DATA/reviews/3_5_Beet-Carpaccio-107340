I really like this dish. I've made it 2X now and both times......exceptional flavor! Definitely use as much or more onion than called for since they reduce a lot when caramelizing. I only used fresh beets and as an appetizer it is so delicious. Roasting beets does take longer but I think flavor and nutrients are preserved much better. Served with aged Parm, but also consider other cheeses like goat, feta, asiago, bedford, etc. Give this a shot. I think if you don't like beets you might be converted.

We all loved this dish. I was surprised how well the flavors of onions and beets went together. As noted by other readers - the onion marmelade was wonderful. I served only 4 small plates with the amount of onion. Next time I would double the onions. I used feta cheese on top instead of parmesan and I think it would have been even better with a couple of dabs of soft goat cheese.

Made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! Layered it in one large dish and it was gone in five minutes. The onions are fantastic and were great with the beets (I used fresh). Made the onions and beets the day before and just assembled and reheated. I thought the Parm was a nice touch, but not essential.

Beautiful dish, and delicious. I agree with the previous reviewer: the onion marmalade is wonderful!

The onion marmalade is amazing. I would happily use this as a condiment on everything possible. It is certainly the star of this dish.

LOVE this recipe! What a great idea for a new way to eat beets (which I love). I'll absolutely use the onion marmalade for other meals, especially sandwiches or with crackers and cheese. So delicious. I could even be fine with thicker sliced beets. It was well worth it to roast the fresh beets too - not that much extra work since you just throw it in the oven and forget about it for a while.

A very tasty way to prepare beets. I had a can of small beets and that's what I used. Still delicious, but I can't wait to try this again with fresh. The different elements of the recipe all come together into a wonderfully earthy and satisfying flavor. The onion marmalade is exceptional. I found this recipe wanting to use what was in my cupboards. I was out of white wine and balsamic, so I used Madeira and cider vinegar. Still out of this world, so my advice is don't be afraid to experiment a little with the marmalade.

This was okay. I love roasted beets, but the onion marmelade, while good, didn't really add to the beets. Normally I think there is almost nothing not improved by P-R, but the cheese seemed an odd addition. My roasted beets will continue to be plain, with butter.

I keep coming back to this recipe, usually served with roast duck and rice with pecans and orange zest. Enjoy!

This was a delicious side dish! The onion marmalade was fabulous. Very easy to make.

Guests who don't normally like beets (including my husband) thought this was a nice way to sneak them in. The onion marmalade was really what made this different than plain sliced beets. Drizzled olive oil and Sel de Guerande (really added punch).

This is quite good. I love freshly roasted beets -- as a child the only beets my mother served were out of a bottle or can, which are poor substitutes for fresh beets. The onion mixture smelled delicious while cooking and intrigued my daughter who had already turned up her nose to the news that beets were on the menu. The onions could be adapted to other dishes, like flank steak. I am not sure why the cook in San Francisco was so negative because this is not a hard dish to make and bland is simply an incorrect characterization of these beets. I recommend this recipe and intend to make it again.

This is great for a dinner party because you can make all of the components in advance. It makes for an impressive presentation and it tastes amazing. I think you could even serve this at room temperature. Even if you don't have an adjustable blade slicer I think you could pull this off--just make a few extra beets so you're not trying to slice every last ounce of beet with a knife.

Way too much time for a dish that is bland and underwhelming.

This dish was incredible. I made it as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. My husband begged (quite literally) for more the next day...
