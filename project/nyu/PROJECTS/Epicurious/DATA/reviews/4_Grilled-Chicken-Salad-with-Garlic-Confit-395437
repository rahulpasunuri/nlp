Delicious! It does take a tad bit more than 40 minutes total, as the garlic oil is supposed to cool completely after simmering for 20 minutes, but the extra wait time is worth it. We made homemade croutons with some of the extra garlic oil.

Wish you were able to rate on the halves - I would give this 3 1/2. Excellent and easy. I didn't use the parsley but made everything else per recipe. Simple but great flavors. Will try next with less oil and make half the dressing. Didn't need more than the 2 Tspns you initially add. The ingredients work well together. Always looking for a summer salad - adding it to the mix.
