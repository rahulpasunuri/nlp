As yet another spring snowstorm made its way through our mountain town, I was searching chicken thigh recipes and came across this one. I only had thighs and had not marinated overnight but this recipe tasted very good. I seasoned the thighs with salt and pepper, then sauted in olive oil. I removed the chicken, browned the garlic and fresh thyme, then added about 1 cup of red wine. After the wine reduced to about half, I added the broths and the chicken and reduced to simmer. I added the baby carrots about 45 minutes before the chicken was done. When the chicken was done, I removed and covered to keep warm, reduced the sauce and added the butter at the end. I was going to add mushrooms but forgot about them. I served with smashed red potatoes and fresh green beans. It was a great dinner for a snowy night. I will make again but don't know if I will marinate overnight...it had great flavor without it.

Hey Sassy from San Fran: Quit your condescending attidude, dude. Chef Hirigoyen of Fringale had to be following another recipe - I did this one to the letter and it came out bland and oily. I won't tweak it since there are other really great recipes out there.

Very good, even w/o overnight marinating and with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

There is nothing wrong with this recipe. Fringale is one of San Francisco's gems and chef Hirigoyen executes this dish with wonderful results. Give it another try and work on seasoning, girls.

What a disappointment! This dish looked great in the picture, but in reality it was bland and very oily. Most recipes from the magazine are a real hit in our house, but not this time. We followed the recipe to the T, and our result was nothing like what appeared on the pages of Bon Appetit!

Lacking flavor. The marinade did nothing for me.
