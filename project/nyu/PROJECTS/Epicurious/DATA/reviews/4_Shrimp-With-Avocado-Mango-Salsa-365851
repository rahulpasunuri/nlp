Very tasty. I actually used the Stonewall kitchen Mango Salsa and just added fresh lime, cilantro and avocado and it was delicious.

I made this recipe last night and I followed the directions pretty closely. I thought it was really good but the star of the show was the Avocado-Mango salsa, it was SUPERB! I liked the rest but my one minor complaint is that the shrimp was a little bland. I was thinking if I made it again I might add some butter and garlic or maybe marinade the shrimp in some way. In an effort to save some time, I cut up the Cilantro, Jalapeno, and the Onion the night before and combined them in a bowl. I thought this might have actually worked out a little better because the flavors had time to meld together. As we were eating we were already thinking of other uses for the Salsa. I will definitely make it again. I wasn't sure if I should use frozen or fresh spinach. I couldn't find fresh baby spinach so I just bought regular and it was better than I suspected. I think I would also use the entire Jalapeno next time but I like things a little spicy. To me this was really a one dish meal with the addition of the couscous. I don't think one pound of shrimp would have been enough for 4 people though. I made it for two and there was a little extra but for four I would up the shrimp, maybe to 1.5 pounds. The salsa was 6 forks for me. The sweetness of the mango, the creaminess of the avocado and the spice from the onion was just yummy. I just gave this recipe a four because the I would have liked a little more flavor out of the shrimp. Really glad I made it though.

Made it with jumbo shrimp (that's an oxymoron) that were frozen and they were cooked perfectly after 10 minutes on a 400 degree grill. I cooked the packets shrimp side down. Great recipe!

This is a fantastic dish - doesn't keep very well, but a crowd pleaser if you're cooking for a few people. Definitely my go-to summer recipe. Have made both on the grill outside and in the oven at 500 degrees. Definitely use uncooked shrimp - the pre-cooked shrimp tend to get a little dry, even with all the juices.

Very good and easy. A definite keeper for summer weeknights.

SO delicious! made this with some modifications and it instantly became a family favorite. i didn't want to bother with the foil so i simply pan-fried the shrimp in oil and with cilantro. not a fan of cous cous so i served it with rice instead. i ended up making a spinach side dish instead of cooking it with the shrimp. followed the rest of the recipe, except didn't seed the jalapeno. wasn't too spicy at all. would give it 5 forks if i could!

This is an absolute superb dish. I can't wait to make it again. Now for how I changed it. 1st I bought the spinach then forgot to add it. I love spinach but at this point if I use spinach next time it will be wilted and on the side. You don't need it. Secondly, I did not make it on the grill. I made the couscous and put in a casserole dish with shrimp and cilantro and cooked about 15 - 20 minutes @400 degrees in the oven just until the shrimp were cooked. Third, I've never used couscous before and this recipe is not clear on wether to add the 1/4 cup water to dry or cooked couscous so I Cooked the couscous as that package directed then did not add more water. Fourth, the avocado-mango salsa is orgasmic and should be increased by 50 to 100% of what this recipe calls for.

Really tasty dish. I used garlic prawns (ie already marinated in-store by my fishmonger) and it worked brilliantly. Needed longer than 10mins in a hot oven, I had it in for more like 20mins at 230C. Perfect for a warm summer's evening.

This is a keeper - so easy and minimal clean up. I did add more seasoning as suggested by other reviews. I also added a tilapia fillet to the packet. The fish was tender and delicious. The mango wasn't looking so good today, so I substituted pineapple tidbits. My 7 year old really liked the pineapple addition.

Great, and very easy to make. The mango salsa adds just the right amount of sweet. I baked this in a hot over at 455 degrees instead of the grill, and it turned out great. Looking forward to trying it on the grill!

My husband and I grilled the entire recipe in on of those large Reynolds foil bags because I had them in the pantry. Otherwise, no changes. It was fantastic - would definitely serve to company.

Great summer recipe! I added a minced clove of garlic and about a tablespoon of ginger to the shrimp mixture. I think it added a lot of flavor. Otherwise, I kept everything the same and it was wonderful. I will definitely make this again!!

This is a really easy recipe that packs a punch of flavor. I would have given it 4 forks but I added a bit of seasonings to the shrimp packets since the recipe seems a little too simple and I'm glad I did. It wouldn't be bad as is. No, but it does need a bit more than what is listed for it to really wow. I added a bit of cumin, coriander, and a dash of jerk seasoning to layer in some extra flavor. Also, you may need to add more water to the couscous. The type of couscous I use needs more water. Otherwise it kind of got toasty instead of steamed enough. Not a dish-ruiner though. It still tasted very good. I'm definitely going to keep this recipe around and use it as a base for other dishes. Also, I made this dish in the oven instead of a grill. I'd preheat to 450-500 and then bake in the foil for 10 minutes like the recipe says. Turned out fine. The salsa is really good on its own, no need to really change that at all.
