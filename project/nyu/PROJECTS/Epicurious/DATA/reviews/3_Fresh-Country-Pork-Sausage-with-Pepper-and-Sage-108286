Prepared and had for Sunday breakfast. I really enjoyed the flavor and the fact I knew what was in the pattie. The children aren't sausage people, but they enjoyed it. Good with biscuits.

I ground up 6 pounds of fairly lean pork, added 3 T of dried sage from our garden, 2 T of salt, 2 T of pepper, and 1 1/2 T of ground red pepper flakes. It turned out very tasty, and plenty 'sagey' with the spicy aftertaste lasting, not unpleasantly, for hours.

I won't rate this recipe because after reading it I would not make it for the following two reasons: not enough sage; not enough black pepper. My rule of thumb, for a true taste of sage farm sausage, is 1 tablespoon of sage per pound of ingrediants and 1 teaspoon of black pepper per pound. The rest is fine. I never really measureso precisely. It depends greatly on how freshh the sage is and the quality of it. But I must admit, I like a sagey sausage.
