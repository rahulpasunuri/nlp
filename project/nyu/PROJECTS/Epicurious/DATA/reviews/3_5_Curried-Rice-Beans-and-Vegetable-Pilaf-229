The only thing wrong with this recipe is the omission of salt. It's absolutely necessary to add it, ESPECIALLY if using unsalted broth or water as the liquid. It needs to be added before that last 25 minutes of cooking. You can also increase the curry powder and/or add other spices with it: whatever you typically use in your curries. If you prefer using brown rice, cook it separately from the veggies, and in plain broth or lightly salted water. It won't be a pilaf then, but still delicious.

This was really good. I made it with veggie broth, double curry powder, and spinach.

what's not to like? it's quick. it's easy. it's nutritious. it's sweet and spicy. I substituted the chicken stock with coconut milk and water, the chutney with something I had in the frig that spicy and sweet. I also added onions to the saute. friggin delicious. a keeper.

I made a little mistake while making this having misread the recipe, but I managed to correct it (I cooked the rice beforehand then realized that it was supposed to cook in the pan)... But it was quite tasty, a tad sweet though... I doubled the amount of vegetables and kidney beans to serve more people. I made it vegan too by using water instead of broth. Will definitely make it again.

Yum! We used cous cous with toasted pine-nuts instead of rice, and heaped the veggies on top of the cous cous with the juices and served as a vegetarian main course with naan. I also used white beans instead of kidney and kale for the greens.

This recipe is amazing, and it looks as good as it tastes. It goes perfectly with the chicken, red pepper and green bean stir fry. I will make this again and again!

My husband's favorite recipe from Epicurous. That's saying something because he knows food. It's also wonderful for kids. My 2 year old loves it despite the spinach. I usually serve this with Curried Turkey Burgers (recipe on this site). When I serve it alone, I offer whole wheat pita bred, cut in quarters on the side, or in halves to stuff. Either way, it's great either way. Further, I used raisins and instead of collard greens, frozen spinach. Also, I found chutney at the Dekalb Farmer's market (Atlanta) which I found far superior to Major Grey's. Sorry I don't remember the name, but it's an Indian brand in a big jar with an orange label. I highly recommend this recipe.

Bland, soggy, and too much effort. I can't imagine that using mango chutney would've made that big a difference (I had to improvise with chunks of fresh mango, a nob of ginger, and some brown sugar). Be sure to wring that spinach. Unfortunately, the recipe makes alot.

This turned out WAY better than I thought it would. I used veggie broth, fresh collards, a mix of white and brown basmati and added more sweet potato. I had to cook it a bit longer than suggested to make sure that the rice was tender. So tasty! The flavors and textures compliment each other beautifully.

A wonderful dish. I, as well, used spinach instead of collards. I used 1 1/2 cups rice with 3 cups of broth, and wouldn't do this again as I think it diluted out the wonderful flavors. I'd make it as written, doubling entire recipe if necessary. It is a gorgeous dish, very healthy, and my family loved it. Would be great with addition of shredded chicken.

Very good recipe! The changes I made were using spinach instead of the collard greens (as others already suggested) and used my own mango chutney (very easy to prepare too, 3 mangoes, a little garlic a little fresh ginger chopped fine, 3/4 cups b. sugar and cider vinegar, + 1/2 cup raisins all boiled together for 10 minutes. oh yes and of course some red pepper per taste.) My husband and I loved it, I think next time I will add more sweet potato.

My husband and I thought this was tasty. Not a keeper, but worth making once and interesting. Our grown kids didn't like it at all. It is a bit of a sludgy jumble of flavors that don't really add up to anything very special. On the other hand, they taste pretty good with dishes, such as the grilled jerk chicken, that have a lot of zip.

Really interesting flavors and a great healthy vegetarian dish. I used regular potatoes instead of yams, and golden raisins instead of currants, and I cooked fresh collards rather than frozen. Very yummy.

I've made this several times to go with grilled Maple Leaf duck. It's almost perfect. I cut back a little on the chutney and used fresh baby spinach. I love this dish.

Even my kids liked this one. We substituted spinach for the collards, and (frozen) soybeans for the kidney beans, which worked out fine. Next time I'll do it as written- very nice.

I loved this. And my husband who is not a fan of curry, liked it too. I substituted frozen spinach for the collard greens and increased the curry t0 1.5 tbs. I also used brown rice, cooked cooked it for 20 minutes before adding greens, beans, potatoes and currants, then cooked 25 minutes more. Healthy comfort food. A really excellent winter lunch.

This was delicious! However, I used brown rice instead of white - if you do this, remember brown takes almost twice as long to cook as white! This dish was also great the next day for lunch.

Not too shabby! I think the best part about this recipe is how little time it takes to get ready. I said I'd make it again mostly because it's quick, pretty tasty, and cheap. I'm pretty sure I can taste the mango chutney in here, as well... which is good, considering it cost $5.50 for a little jar (a little much for a student budget, but seemingly worth it ;)) Also, was pleased at how the time was 'just right'; neither the rice nor the sweet potatoes were overcooked. Great! Additions/omissions: Curry Powder (x 1.5) Cayenne (2 tsp) Currant (none -- I forgot!)

This is a perfect recipe. Easy, healthy and very flavorful. I took advice of previous reviews to up the spices. If found a hot curry at Whole Foods Market called Sambhar Curry. I used 1/2 tbl. Sambhar Curry and 1/2 tbl. Madras. Next time I will change the ratio to 3/4 Sambhar and 1/4 Madras to make it even kickier. Also I couldn't find frozen collard greens so I used fresh. I didn't cook it first and it was a little tough. I would use fresh again, only cook it first.

It was well, blah, but then again maybe that is what it is supposed to be. I deviated only in substituting the Collard greens with spinach. Good Indian recipes are hard to find and this is not one of them.

I liked this dish and it was easy to prepare, but next time I will add more curry powder, it wasn't spicy enough for my taste.

This is a wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe except I used a different brand of mango chutney (and it was 'hot') and it turned out delicious. A previous reviewer wrote "a perfect combination of spicy and sweet". How true!! We ate it as the main dish, and it was enough to fill us up. Also...its extremely easy to prepare. Try it : )

I have had so many requests for this easy recipe. Substitutions of ingredients on hand don't seem to affect the outcome. I used a pkg of frozen spinach instead of the collards and butternut squash cubes instead of the sweet potato.

I made this as a side dish for jerk chicken for a picnic lunch. Was surprised at the quantity it yielded - a LOT! But presumably this is supposed to be a main dish. Leftovers were swept up and I've had a request to bring to next BBQ we attend, so I guess it was a big success. Yummy too.

great recipe to play with. I used white beans for kidney & fresh spinach (added in the last 5 minutes) for greens. I was short curry powder so added tumeric, ginger, nutmeg & cumin. Also added arbol pepper sauce & red pepper flakes for heat

I didn't have curry powder so made a home made masala with 1 medium onion; 1t turmeric; 1t garam masala; 1t cumin; and 1T mango hot sauce- but I like it spicy. Very easy, fast and yummy. Tastes like a couscous with rice.

Definitely double the curry. I used fresh spinach, too and it worked great. Everyone raved and it is so good for you too!

I was surprised at how much this made, but will enjoy the left-overs for lunch. I mixed the quick masala from the Barbecue Bible by Steven Raichlen and used 1 1/2 Tbsp. I also used spinach instead of collards and served the chutney on the side and it is delicious combined. My family really liked it.

I use fresh collards whenever I can find them (right now growing in the garden), sauteeing them with the garlic. I also cook brown basmati rice separately, since it takes 45 minutes to cook. I do like it a bit spicier, adding more curry to taste, and serve the chutney on the side.

I used red and yellow peppers with different color kidney beans - wonderful colors! Mine needed a bit more zip, so next time I'd increase the spices and perhaps add some fresh mango or a spicy curry paste. This is feel-good, healthy, comfort food.

Delicious and easy to make. I used fresh collard greens instead of frozen, steaming them a bit prior to adding them to the other ingredients. Everyone liked this dish, even my father, who is strictly a meat and potatoes man (hates most veggies). A keeper.

I absolutely loved this! I also used fresh spinach. Used a can of mixed beans instead of just kidney. The different colours to this dish were great!

I absolutely love mango chutney, and this is one of the few recipes I've been able to find that is vegetarian. I increased the chutney to a 1/2 c., and used one bunch of fresh spinach instead of the frozen collards. It was very good. My girlfriend says it has just the right amount of sweetness. I found it went well with the morrocan style carrots. I have also replaced a portion of the long-grained rice with wild rice for additional texture, colour and nutrition.

I cut up chicken and fried it before I did the garlic and pepper. I used my hot curry, and it was very tasty. Needless to say, it made more servings. I added a 1/2 cup more rice and used 2 sweet potatoes, and increased the liquid and chutney by half

I made this substituting raisins for currants, spinach for collards, and since I couldn't find mango chutney (or *any* chutney, for that matter) I used mango juice and less water. It was delicious and the people who ate it were very impressed.

This was very good, however I didn't follow it exactly since I didn't have all the ingredients. I substituted some hot mango chutney, black eyed peas,yellow squash, zucchini, and peanuts for the Major Grey, kidney beans,sweet potato,collard greens and currents respectively. Also used brown rice instead of white. Maybe I have a new receipe ?

This is a wonderfully flavorful and very colorful dish! Substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth and it makes a beautiful vegetarian meal.
