Love this recipe. Super easy and you can dress it up by setting out all the fixins (as another reviewer said, feta, olives, cherry tomatoes, red onion). I did saute the garlic slightly to prevent the strong raw garlic after effects. Sauce was still my favorite part.

This is a really good basic recipe, you can add feta, olives, tomato, cucumber, raw onions, peppers, etc. I use light sour cream and dried dill for the sauce and it comes out nicely. I also use a thick flatbread to make it more filling. Again, a nice recipe that I will make many times in the future.

I really liked this recipe. I added another garlic clove and a couple Tablespoons of lemon juice to the chicken before cooking it. The sauce was outstanding. I served with a side of feta and some diced tomatoes. Also had a side salad. Easy, delicious and not heavy. And yes, the kids did eat it.

this recipe is great and easy to make. A friend suggested adding tomatoes and cucumbers as toppings and I always include them now. It's delicious!

Terrific; very much liked by the b.f. The fresh dill really makes this dish. The onions are fine so long as you saute them long enough.

This was good -- the sauce had a nice tang to it, and I appreciated the overall balanced texture. The combination of the onions, dill, and yogurt made for one of those dining experiences that continue to haunt you the next morning, despite brushing your teeth twice and using extra-minty mouthwash... I don't think I would make it again just because of its propensity to linger...like a houseguest overstaying their welcome.

This is a great, easy, and healthy dinner. When I made it tonight, both of my young children LOVED it, which makes me like it even more. Didn't have time to get to the onions, and it was still delicious in a whole wheat pita, with some cucumbers and yogurt sauce.

Great recipe! I used fat yogurt for the sauce. I added french fries & slices of tomato to the gyro as well to make it just like a 'loaded gyro' we make here in Crete. Wonderful! Greek food is the best!

This was quick, easy, and very good! I had leftover yogurt from another recipe to get rid of, and found this recipe to use. Taking other people's advice, I added cucumber to the sauce, as well as scallions since I had them on hand. It makes a lot of sauce, so I've used the leftovers as a dip with raw veggies! Easy and great--my husband loved it!

This has become a regular week night meal for us. My kids love it and the yogurt sauce is a great dip with veggies. Chicken can be boring, but this recipe creates moist and flavorful chicken!

Easy and healthy meal. I added half a chopped cucumber to the yogurt sauce and served with extra sliced cucumbers and tomatoes. Made a box of commerical couscous on the side and had a quick, complete meal in under an hour. I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious. I made this for dinner yesterday for my 2 kids and they gobbled it up. Instead of the yogurt-dill sauce, I served it with delicious tzatziki prepared by a local greek restaurant. with pitas, tomatos, cucumbers - a delicious dinner.

This was my first attempt at making anything Mediterranean and it turned out great. Such an easy recipe. I followed it to the T. 2 out of 3 of my kids ate it up, the other one I just added a little ranch dressing to help her out. I warmed the pitas in the toaster for a bit. It makes much more sauce than needed too. I will make this again just for the sake of variety. Tasty for sure.

Yummy!! I used Greek lowfat yogurt. Its nice and thick. I usually avoid garlic in recipes but in this case I made an exception. It is fabulous. I served it with chick peas seasoned only with oil and vinegar. I had some yogurt sauce left over so I used it the next night with plain broiled salmon. Again.....yummy!!

This dish was quick, healthy, and decent tasting - but I didn't think it was as amazing as a lot of the reviews suggest. I love gyros, but these were pretty bland compared to what I get at my local gyro place. I added cucumber and tomatoes and used greek yogurt to make the sauce. 2.5 forks

Very easy and quite good. I used some left over lamb. Worked perfectly. I also added some chopped cucumber and tomato with vinegar.

This dish was easy and delicious. It made a lot of food for two people, but we found a great way to use the leftover chicken. We browned some garlic with a tsp of red hot peppers, then added about 1/2 a cup of white wine and let it cook for the amount of time it took the pasta to boil, adding more white wine when necessary. A few minutes before the pasta was done we added the leftover chicken/onion mixture to the wine sauce to warm it up. Delicious!! My boyfriend liked it more than the gyros. Happy cooking!

I saw this recipe on the Travel Channel. Wow! It is so delicious. My mom and I made Falafals with it which were great. We put tzatiki in it too. mmmm. I would definitely make it again.

Added a tablespoon of non-fat sour cream and a good hit of cayenne pepper to the sauce...outstanding. Put it on heated flour tortillas. So quick and easy. I made it two nights in a row!

Used the recommendations of others (added finely diced cucumber to the sauce and sauted some garlic with the onions) - very easy, tasty and healthy. Perfect for summer.

I made this dish for myself one night and LoVeD it, when my Parents and little brother got home (who love food a lot more than I do) they asked me to make it for them... they enjoyed it so much! My very picky little brother told me it was his favorite meal ever! I probably put too much garlic in the dill sauce so be careful or maybe try roasting the garlic first to calm the flavor a little. Im making it tonight for my boyfriend and Im sure he'll love it just as much as my whole family did.

This is a very easy and tasty dish. Please don't call it gyros. The real gyros is cooked by putting the meat (or the chicken ) trough a large skewer vertical and cooking it on charcoals. There is a special equipment for this. In any case this recipe is tasty and worth making it especially the summer.

Rating: 3
This was excellent. I used fat free plain yogurt and mixed it with full-fat sour cream. Husband didn't know at first if he'd like the yogurt sauce, so I put it on the side. By the end of the meal he'd poured the whole thing on his gyro and was licking the bowl!

Very easy to make. A very tasty meal too. My teen scarfed it up.

Delicious and easy. For just a few ingredients, yogurt sauce is remarkably good! Prepared everything as is, but threw some sliced black olives and feta on top at the end. Served with a cucmber and tomato salad. Big hit with my husband - we'll definitely make again.

This dish is so wonderfully simple and delish. Followed with the suggestions of adding cucumbers. Yummy. Added a little white wine vinegar to the sauce because I didn't have enough lemon, with some paprika also, and good way to disperse the garlic into the sauce is to grind with the blind of your knife into the salt. Excellent dish and will definately make again. I can see myself making alot of this in the summer.

This was great! I served the gyros with some garlic and herb Athenos feta cheese. The perfect combo to compliment the garlic and herbs in the chicken. I warmed up the flat bread right on top of my gas stove, right on the element...just watch so they don't burn. Then they fold much easier and don't split apart. I could hardly hear anything my kids were saying on the way home from Kindergarten today, because my mind was focused on making another one of these for lunch! Leftovers were super!

I am not rating this recipe, since I haven't actually made it. I worked my way through college in a Greek restaurant and we made gyros very similar to this--the ingredients sound right so I'm sure it must taste similar (that would be--incredible). I still make these for my family and it's always a big hitl. The only thing I would add would be some good quality feta cheese and thinly sliced cucumbers and serve with Tabouli or a Greek pasta salad. Greek food is the best!!

This is terrific and so easy. I agree that full-fat yoghurt is the better choice.

I think fat yogurt is essential for the right flavour. And you don't have to strain it. Or even better: tzatziki.

Very good. For the sauce, I strain the yogurt to make it thicker and add seeded, diced cucumbers.

I didn't have any yogurt, so I didn't make the sauce. The chicken however is very good. I added some chopped garlic to the onions before adding back the chicken. I ate it with whole wheat pitas, cucumber, roasted garlic hummus and arugula. Yummy! So easy and will definitely make again.

I didn't use lowfat yogurt. I used fat yogurt.

This is very tasty, though we have been making a similar version for years. For something different, double the yogurt sauce recipe and marinate the chicken in half of it overnight. Skewer and grill the chicken (yes it's messy, but WOW is it good), then proceed as directed. Fantastic!

This was so good! Perfect recipe for a light, easy to make meal. I added some diced cucumbers to the yogurt sauce (tzatziki style) and a little lettuce and tomato to make it a complete meal in a pita! Will definitely make this again.

Pretty good but the yogurt sauce was bland. Altered by adding as follows with good results more equivalent to what I had in Greece: 2 T. fine grated onion 3 T. course grated cucumber 1/2 T. dried Mexican oregano

I was looking for a way to use some leftover lamb and tried this recipe. I added the oregano to the onions while they cooked and then added the leftover lamb just to heat and followed the rest of the recipe as is. We thought it was great and continue to make this for lunch with leftover lamb and chicken from a previous night's dinner.

I gave this recipe 4 forks because I am the kind of person that will only make EASY dishes - this is a winner! This one is easy and so delicious, it's a very simplified version of a classic Gyro but it's still very good. My husband and I finished the all the pitas and all the chicken :0)

Great, easy summer weekday supper. I add diced tomatoes and lettuce. If you pile the chicken, vegetables and sauce on top of the pita round and eat it with a knife and fork, it's much neater (and you get more sauce!).

This was very good for minimal effort. I added a little more garlic and also chopped tomatoes and cucumbers. Don't let the review of Carole from Napa stop you from making this--there's a world of difference between warm pita bread and hard pita bread! (I just heated mine up for about 15 seconds in the microwave.)

Very quick, easy, and healthy. I didn't have any dill so I added some chives and minced garlic. I also marinaded the chicken w/ some lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic for a few hours. Chopped tomatoes and lettuce rounded out an excellent meal.

The recipe didn't say how to warm the pita bread, so I put them in the oven at 200. They came out hard and crisp and couldn't wrap around the chicken. We at the chicken off the top of the round, and both agreed this wasn't very good. I even added cilantro (which we adore)but it didn't help. Sorry, just not my stuff!

I liked this - it's simple, quick, and tasty. Make sure you season the sauce with plenty of salt and pepper. I also served it with chopped tomatoes, and on the side had baby squashes sauteed in olive oil, fresh basil, and a little garlic. Nice combination :)

Yum, Yum, Yum. I mainly used this recipe for inspiration, since I changed it a bit. I didn't cook the onions, just sliced them up and added them raw at the end along with raw cucumber and tomato slices. I also added some garlic when sauteing the chicken. All in all, this is a great dish for summer.

VERY good, and so low-cal! I also added shredded lettuce, diced cucumbers and tomatoes, and a little lemon pepper - YUM!

Very... interesting! I was not as fond of these as my guy, but we both decided that considering how low-fat this meal is it tasted great! The chicken was good - I did not cook the onions through so they had a nice "powerful" flavor. The sauce was a bit strange at first but seemed to grow on me after the first gyro - I think that I'll try adding some sour cream next time to thicken up the dressing. All in all, in a time when we're trying to cut back on fatty food and such, this makes for a tasty (and interesting) meal!

I thought this was pretty good for a chicken gyros. I would make it again. I have to agree with Dayton OH and say that King Gyros in Bloomington is the best! I found the Trojan Horse very disappointing.

Rating: 0
My husband loved it and wolfed three gyros down in a matter of minutes! I thought it was okay, but not the greatest. Next time, I would add less dill to the sauce, because it is very strong-tasting. I would also consider adding more garlic. The best gyros I ever had was in Bloomington, IN, a place called King Gyros on S. Walnut St. This recipe isn't bad, though. Added note to cook in Indianpolis: I've been to the Trojan Horse in Bloomington, IN and thought it was okay, but still like King Gyros better. It's further away from downtown, but the portions are larger and prices cheaper. I dream about _their_ tzatziki sauce. ;D
