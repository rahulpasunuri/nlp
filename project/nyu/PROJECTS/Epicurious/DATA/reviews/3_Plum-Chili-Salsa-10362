Just didn't do it for me. Perhaps the plums were not tasty enough but was not distinctive.

Made this when we had an abundance of plums after picking 10+lbs off some nearby trees. It was great just on its own with chips. Will make it again.

I made this and served it as an appetizer, and the party went nuts. Nothing left of and kind - raves. With fresh plums from the yard. No need for chicken.

Not that impressed, but I think it's probably just a taste-bud preference.

I made this to go with the chicken and it was fabulous! I think next time I will double the recipe. It has such a fresh and unexpected flavor with the chicken. Wonderful!

I made this for the accompanying roasted chicken dish -- my guests raved! It is truly tasty and different, and very good with this chicken. Absolutely make this if you do the chicken.
