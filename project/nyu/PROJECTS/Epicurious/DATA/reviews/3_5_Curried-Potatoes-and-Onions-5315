This was really easy and quite good. I have three young kids and I think the flavor was perfect for them. I added about a tbls of curry powder and I thought it was perfect. I served it with naan.

Ooops..forgot to mention that I added some smoked paprika as well. That gave it nice depth.

I didn't rate this, as I made quite a few tweaks to the recipe. I agree with others, the spices can definitely be increased. I doubled them all, plus added an extra tsp of cumin on top of that. I added 2 tsps of curry and cinnamon, too. I also added two cloves of garlic and a quarter cup of orange juice. Also, the 1/3 cup of oil is too much. I used 1/4 cup of olive oil and it worked just fine. Overall, pretty good. Not attractive enough to make for company, but something nice to tuck into nonetheless.

I couldn't imagine how it would turn out, but it was surprisingly pleasant, although not nearly "curry" enough - so I added 2 TBS good curry powder and next time would add more + an extra onion and maybe a bit more drained diced tomatoes. Also didn't use Jelapeno peppers because I didn't have any - but may try some next time. Definitely worth experimenting on. And it looks nice.

This is an excellent recipe. I have made it numerous times and no matter how I error, it is very good and goes well with so many flavors.

If I make this again, I would definitely up the spices. The potatoes can definitely stand up to stronger flavors. It's nothing spectacular as is but if you play around with the spices, I can definitely see the potential. I made this as an additional side to dal. A good veggie meal.

Easy for a week night (I even tossed some chicken in with the onions to make it a one-pot meal). Nothing super spectacular, but enjoyed by all in the family to keep as a "what to cook when time is short" dinner

This is a really nice mixture of spices. I doubled the spices and added garlic and ginger and used kale instead of tomatoes. I usually hate kale but with these spices it came out really good--although not exactly low-fat with the 1/3 cup of oil. I wouldnt reduce the oil though b/c it would probably affect the flavor. Yum!

I used powdered mustard, powdered cumin and canned tomatoes. I also added a dash of garlic powder and some cayenne. You definitely need to cook it longer. It was really good.

As written, this recipe is a bit boring. With extra spices, the dish was much improved. Served it with orange saffron rice, and I agree that it would be tasty with some naan.

Good basic potato curry, needs a bit more flavor. Add a bit of cayenne to the spice mixture, and some garlic and ginger after the onions have cooked for a few minutes. Agree that the potatoes need about five minutes more cooking time than the recipe calls for.

What a delicious recipe! I increased the spices a bit, and used double the amount of seeded jalepenos to get more flavor with less heat. I also used canned diced tomatoes. Great tasting, easy to make, one pan, this is going to be a regular in my house.

This was a quick and easy curry. I didn't have cumin seeds. I used two times the amount of cumin powder to get a good flavor. I barely added any jalepeno's. I used bread fruit instead of potatoes. Soooo delicious. Where did I get bread fruit in NJ? It's a long story.

This recipe was OK. I cooked some chicken breasts in the oil after adding the spices, then added them back in at the end, and served this as a main course. Some people found this too spicy, though I found it mostly bland, except when you got a spicy bite with a jalapeño seed. If I were to make it again for the same people, I might leave out the seeds of the peppers and use more of other spices to get flavor. Also, the potatoes never seemed to get cooked enough, so I'd suggest cooking with a tight seal so that the steam can really cook them.

What a great combination! I used a can of diced tomatoes (too early for good fresh ones), unpeeled Yukon Golds and young Vidalias, & added a little sprinkle of Garam Masala at the end. Served it with both tamarind & mango chutneys. Per the comment below, the steam cooks the potatoes, so cover tight!

I've been making this recipe at least once a weeek for almost a year now. Over time I've found that it's evolved to fit my tastes... here's how I make it. I use 1 onion, 1 potato, and ground cumin instead of cumin seeds. I cover the pan tightly (it's the steam that cooks the potatoes) and let the potatoes cook for about 20 minutes. This way it makes just enough for two -- and it's absolutely delicious with the "extra" spices.

Sorry to be a downer, but I was disappointed with this dish. It was beautiful, but not as interesting as the ingredients would lead me to believe. Too much oil and just not that complex or mouth-watering.

I really liked it and would definitely make it again. I changed it by doubling the seasonings and not adding the tomatos. I also boiled the potatos first to soften them and cooked in the pan for 15 minutes with the onion mixture.

True, the potatoes needed more cooking, perhaps to be parboiled first? Although we liked this recipe and it was super-easy to make, we thought it was a little potato-heavy. Maybe some other veggies--peas or something light and simple would add to the flavor. Next time I think we'll try the sweet potato suggestion.

Easy to make, but the potatoes take longer than called for to cook.

This was a real surprise. I loved it! It tasted truly authentic. I have also made this using sweet potatoes and it was remarkable. It's one of my regulars now, especially with curries and country captain chicken.

This is my idea of an ideal dish--tastes great and easy to prepare. I served it with a tandoori style chicken but it would also complement non-Indian foods as well.

This is my family's absolutely favorite recipe from Epicurious. We have it once or twice a month and my husband asks why we don't double the recipe so there will be lots left over for days to follow!! We just use the recipe as is, and eat it with broiled fish or baked chicken or even just a green salad. Very tasty, never boring, and good healthy eating!!

This is a wonderful recipe. We served it alongside a savory meatloaf and it was quickly devoured by only three people. U added 1/4 teaspoon of fenugreek seed and a pinch of cayenne. Add more cayennew if you want a hotter variant.

I've made this recipe many times with an Indian chicken and coriander gravy recipe. My family loves both -- but it is usually the potatoes that are gone first.

I liked the dish but served it with a very spicy curried chicken - big mistake. It was overpowered. I cooked the potatoes a bit longer than the recipe recommended and it still turned out great. Great leter in the evening directly from the icebox.

Fabulous. I added exta jalepeno for more oomph and followed the tip for adding cauliflower with extra tomato. A nice, simple dish to round out an indian meal.

This dish has a great curry flavor. For a low-carb diet, you can easily replace potatoes with cauliflower -- we added more diced tomatoes so that the cauliflower could get tender. It turned out delicious.

I didn't have any fresh chilies, so I used 1 tsp. dried red pepper flakes tossed in with the other spices, it still turned out great! The potatoes did need to be cooked a little longer than the recipe suggested, but it was still a relatively quick dish to make.

Did not add the jalapeno or tomato, and used german butterball potatoes and black mustard seeds. Would recommend the onions be sliced, but NOT thinly--they just get very dark brown and mush together after all the cooking.

Even the kids liked this dish! Great flavors, easy to prepare, a definite winner.

This is a wonderful recipe-- the aroma just fills up the kitchen. I found myself 'tasting' the dish over and over again...I couldn't wait till meal-time! It's great served with Indian bread, such as naan.

This recipe proves how delicious and exciting potatoes can be! I have served this both as a vegetarian main course and as a side dish. I always have to cook the potatoes quite a bit longer than suggested in the recipe in order to make them tender. As a perky complement to the dish, serve a bit of mango chutney alongside.
