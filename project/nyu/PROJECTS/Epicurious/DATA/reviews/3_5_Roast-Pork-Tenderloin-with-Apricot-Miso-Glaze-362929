This is a staple at our house as a simple flavorful pork dish. Tenderloin stays nice and juicy, and does not take long to prep. Great mid-week meal.

Not that great, I thought the flavors didn't blend well, the orange zest predominated, followed by the miso.I thought it needed something and added 1-2 TB of white wine, which did help, but not really worth making again. It was easy, however, and the pork was tender.

Easily one of the most delicious pork dishes I have ever had...we were literally licking our plates clean!
