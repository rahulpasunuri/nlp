Great flavor especially for a recipe using such simple, inexpensive ingredients. I used feta. That is what I had on hand. I also used heavy cream instead of milk (also on hand). Even my partner who doesn't particularly like eggs enjoyed it. It is definitely better warm out of the oven but not bad at room temp.

This was "just OK". I halved the recipe, making it in an 8" skillet and adjusting the cooking times. I used ricotta salata. We thought it was too salty (maybe my cheese was saltier than the original?). Won't make again.

This was delicious. I added one more egg, more feta and some leftover chopped broccoli. Will definitely make it again.

Wonderful! Light! I added extra parsley, tomatoes, mushrooms (sauteed w/scallions) and lots of feta. Next time I will make with egg whites -- has anyone done that? Nice mid-week supper - super easy!

I used feta. Doubled the recipe and baked at 350 for 25-30 minutes. Raves from everyone. And leftovers were yummy when gently reheated. This recipe is a keeper and I anticipate trying many variations with ingredients.

Made this with a little heavy cream instead of milk and some feta that came with tomato and basil. It was a good consistancy and the taste was very good! I have already made it again.

A three plus. Excellent, very fast and easy yet different. I added some chopped mint and sauteed georgia onions and served it with a salad with some more ricotta salata (which I was trying to use up -- I tried the salad with the fennel and arugala, with a shallot lemon dressing). I will make this again.

We couldn't find ricotta salata, so we had to use feta. It was fantastic! I was cooking for our youth group retreat and even the kids loved it. I prepared everything the night before, combined it in the morning and threw it in the oven. Very easy. The only reason I don't give it a 4 is because you never know what might be better.

Green onions and scallions are the same thing.

I made this to serve in squares at room temperature. I used ricotta salata for the first time- very similar to feta. I did not find "green onion", used lots of scallions-what is green onion?. In the Spring I shall use chives from my garden. This would be delicious on a sandwich.

Very easy to prepare. I fried sliced russet potatoes with whole grain mustard, garlic and rosemary, and surrounded it by the egg mixture. Wonderful and very filling

Great. I used fat-free ricotta. The fresh onions and parsley really make this a treat. Add a salad and gatlic bread and this is a great Sunday lunch. Grab the Sunday paper and a Mimosa.

I USED FETTA CHEESE AND ADDED 3 CLOVES GARLIC. IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE AND HAS A WONDERFUL TASTE. IT'S JUST LIKE MY DAD USED TO MAKE YEARS AGO.

My family loved it! It was so simple and delicious. I used feta and would do so again.
