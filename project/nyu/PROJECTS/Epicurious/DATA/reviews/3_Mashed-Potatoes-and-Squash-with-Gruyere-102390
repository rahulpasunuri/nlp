I went exactly as the recipe said, but added a half a bunch of chives. It was delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.

The description of this dish sounded so good. But my guests and I were a bit disappointed. A bit bland, could have used more seasoning and cheese.

Delicious! Granted, I did not have any Gruyere on hand, so I had to use Parmesan. But this is an easy side dish I will definitely be making over again. Oh, also, I used acorn squash because that's what I had ;)

This is a wonderful side dish. It's easy to make and tastes delicious. I used fontina cheese instead of gruyere, and I used more than the called for 4 tblspns. I used about a 1/4 to 1/2 a cup total. The flavor was wonderful and several of my guests commented on how much they liked it. Also, you can make this the day before you need to serve it. I highly recommend this recipe, and I highly recommend using fontina cheese in it.

I used smoked gruyere cheese and lots of garlic and it had a wonderful, rich flavor. I like the idea of trying other cheeses as well, this is a great recipe for experimentation.

I have to agree that the gruyere did not seem to compliment the squash. I would try this again with another cheese, though. The color is a wonderful addition to an autumn/winter dinner. I should also note that despite my initial reaction to the squash/gruyere combo, my guests did eat up every bit of this (and I had doubled the recipe to feed twelve). I also added extra garlic (as I do w/most recipes).

Sounded like a good recipe but the squash overpowered the potatoes. I used very large garlic cloves but the flavor did not come through. I didn't think the gruyere complimented the squash it almost seemed bitter in contast.
