A unique take on a very healthy dessert or snack. Don't be afraid to try it! Be sure all of your ingredients are top quality, because they shine themselves in this dish. Also, take care that you use a rimmed baking sheet, because the plum juice leaves a wicked stain on the countertops!

I don't like honey so I didn't not use it and maybe that sweetness factor detracted from the taste. I also had Bosc and Bartlet pears so as suggested, I used them instead of plums. A fresh pear far exceeds what this recipe offered. Not very good and I won't make it again.

Made with plums and peaches. If you think about the time it takes for the flavor it gives, this recipe is a winner.

This recipe is so great-simple, fast, healthy. Baking plums really makes the flavor intense. It is worth getting organic plums. Took more than 15 minutes for the plums to be done in my case, FYI.

Made this with plums and nectarines. Healthy and satisfying but not great. However, also made this with pears and plums, served warm from the oven, topped w/one small scoop of Ben & Jerry's vanilla ice cream and drizzled with warm dulce de leche. One of the best desserts I have EVER had!

Very good, and simple as can be. Used pluots, nonfat yogurt, sliced toasted almonds. Delicious followup to Greek-Style Penne with Tomatoes and Dill. No need for parchment; foil worked fine.

I made this after a somewhat savory Asian dinner and it was the perfect way to finish the meal. Not too sweet but SOOOOOOOOO good. And so easy to make.

The secret is to use ripe plums and cook till the juices run off. This was a delicious and healthy desert!!

I got strange looks from the family when I told them this was desert, but there were no leftovers and there were even pleas for more!!! Very good!

I served this to guests for a healthy dessert at a dinner party. They all ate the whole thing, and my husband who thinks he doesn't like yogurt or plums loved it. I, however, thought it was good but not great.

I'm always looking for lower-calorie desserts and this was a hit! Didn't bother with the hazelnuts and actually used less sugar and honey than called for. Still sweet and so rich, it was like pie on the loose.
