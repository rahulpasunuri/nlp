Next time I would reduce the oil, and re-proportion the peppers and the rosemary.

I really liked this dish. Next time though I'll use regular bamboo skewers. Rosemary branches were a fun idea, but really didn't add much flavor. I served this on a bed of lettuce.

WOW! This recipe is simple to prepare and made a great impression on my guests. It is a great appetizer when you would like to spend time with your guests and less time in the kitchen!

I didn't realize I like scallops so much. I marinated them with the seasonings, lemon juice and olive oil while I prepared romemary mashed potatoes. At the end I deglazed the pan with white wine and added butter to thicken. Great!

I'm glad I read the reviews or I would have missed out on this keeper. I've tried using rosemary skewers before and had difficulty but they glide through the scallops. The rosemary is so nice and subtle that it wouldn't compete with any accompaniment. This will be my tried and true scallop standard. I wish we could post pictures - these are so beautiful.

Made this dish for my parents anniversary and they loved it! Have made the mango salsa on separate occasions as it is delicious.

I used lavender branches and leaves instead of rosemary, and cooked them on the gas grill. Garnished with lavender flowers and mango salsa. It was pretty and delicious!

I never would have thought rosemary with scallops. They were to die for. I put them on rosemary stems and used rosemary in the sauce. So easy and as always the scallops need to be fresh and never over cooked. Severed with angel hair pasta with a slight olive oil sauce.

To die for! I am favoring lately recipes that are easy in terms of prep-work, but have the sublime gourmet payoff. This one does it in spades. Next time I may add orange zest, there are many possiblities to the basic scallop on a rosemary skewer idea. I have never had a better dining experince with scallops than with this one.

A perfect weekday meal--easy, delicious and beautiful. I just used regular skewers, but I'm eager to try with the rosemary skewers. Also, I made with the mango salsa and potato salad. Both were delicious and beautiful accompaniments. Husband loved it all.

Excellent. I served it as an appetizer, over mixed greens. When the scallops were done, I deglazed, flambeed with cognac and added some 35% cream. Delicious.

I am learning to cook and was afraid to try seafood but this recipe was very simple and it came out great. Very tasty with the purple potato.

WOW! Great recipe. I only recommend that if you are using the fresh rosemary as scures-you don't need to add fresh rosemary to the recipe. I made the recipe both on the bamboo and rosemary branch and both were great especially served with the mango salsa recommended.

What a fabulous summer meal! I only made one major change--I GRILLED the scallops (mix the oil with the rosemary & spices in a shallow dish & roll the skewered scallops to coat). Grill about 2 minutes per side. The mango/cucumber salsa was so yummy with the sweet scallops & the mint in the potato salad was nice. I actually didn't mix the sugar snap peas into the salad, but served them on their own.

I served this over angel hair pasta that was tossed with a small amount of pesto,olive oil and fresh lemon juice. I changed the spice combination, as one of my dinner guests doesn't 'appreciate' spicy food. I combined fresh rosemary and hot paprika to coat the scallops. Although this was not an 'unpleasant' dish the majority of us found it too salty (the need to s & p before coating is unnecessary). I even added the white wine reduction sauce. I doubt I'll make it again.

Light and yummy flavor. Added 4oz white wine and lemon juice at end for a sauce.

Everyone loved the idea of using rosemary branches as skewers. I marinated the scallops for 1 hour in lime juice . This dish was a hit with our guests.

These were delicious and extremely easy to make. I made them exactly as the recipe stated. I served them over roasted asparagus spears. The olive oil with the spices turned into a delicious sauce that almost seemed to carmelize. Will make again. Fresh rosemary is a must in this.

Easy, tasty. Next time I will try the lemon juice and wine additions as suggested in a previous review. It needed something; perhaps a sauce.

A very good dish. I just sprinkled the seasoning on the scallops after they were about halfway done, let it cook for a while and then added about 4 oz. white wine and some lemon juice and then reduced it for a nice sauce!
