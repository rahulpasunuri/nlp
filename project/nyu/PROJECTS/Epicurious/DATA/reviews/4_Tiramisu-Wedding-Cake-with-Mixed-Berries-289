I made this cake for a friend's wedding this past weekend and experienced a couple of issues with it. First the positives-- the soaking liquid definitely gave a nice luscious flavor to the cake. Also having the almond extract was a nice addition to the background. I don't understand how some folks said they followed the recipe exactly and experienced no issues with it. The frosing was too thin to hold it's own so it was a big challenge decorating the cake with it. I ended up using the frosting called out for only for the filling and found a cream cheese frosting (with butter) for the exterior frosting. Also I didn't feel it was necessary to water down the filling then boing it down. I only used half the water with the Kahlúa, warmed up the liquid just to blend in the flavors. No need to boil down in my view. Also the egg whites deflated while mixing into the batter. This might have been operator error since no one else seemed to have problem with it. The cake tasted great, but it wasn't as fabulous and perfect as I hoped it would be.

I would love to try this recipe. Can someone send me the original frosting recipe as you said it was posted on the Bon Apetit magazine? I want to try a smaller version of this recipe, but since all seem to agree that the frosting was too runny, I would love to try the one that appeared on the magazine. Thank you!

I made ¼ of the recipe as a trial/taste test run for my twin's wedding. ¼ of the recipe filled a half sheet (1) pan perfectly. I used cake flour in place of all purpose (1 cup+ 2 T), but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. The cake cooked beautifully and evenly, but the frosting was runny. I'll probably use it for in between the layers, but use something more stiff on the outside for presentation's sake. Instead of a large layer cake, I've been asked to make mini layered cakes with this recipe, which went very well in the trial run. The bride and groom both loved the test run, but thought that the berries took too much attention away from the cake itself, so they will probably just be on the side, if any guests want them, not on or in the cake. The textures and flavors all went together very well. I will be changing a few things for their big day, but the cake is great.

The very best cake I have ever made!! I followed the directions exactly except used less than half the powdered sugar as other reviewers suggested and it turned out superb. I will absolutely make this cake again. The cake was very moist and dense and had such a wonderful flavor!

I can't believe that this recipe is from 1995 and I only just discovered it now! My mom and I have been recruited to make a wedding cake and they want one of the layers to be a tiramisu cake. So I did a test with 1/3 of the recipe (just the cake part) in a 12" cake pan and it was so good! I have never made a white cake so delicious. It tasted really good and had a nice crumb. Not too dense but not too springy. I loved it! for the syrup to brush/soak it with, I used some Bailey's Caramel and Disarono. I simmered them together in a small pot and then put a coffee filter filled with espresso grounds tied up in the pot and let the espresso infuse while the alcohol burned off. It reduced and was DIVINE! especially on this cake. I love it! I can't get over how good it was.

I made half the recipe for my father's 70th birthday bash (I used 2-9" springform pans). I wouldn't change anything but the frosting. Based on other's comments I reduced the proportions by two thirds. The amount was perfect and unlike others I had little problem with the consistancy, I had to add more cream to make it spreadable. Unfortunatey, I found the taste a little sour and I think I'll make it with Marscapone Cheese next time. Overall, it's a great recipe and as an added plus it travels very well.

I have made this cake one time before as 2 8inch cakes with four layers by cutting the cake recipe by 1/3(I know - baking no-no), syrup by 1/2 and frosting 1/4? - but the cake worked great and fantastic. Now I am making a cake for my friends wedding and have been doing some testing by making a cake for a post wedding reception. I made a 12 inch cake by 1/2ing the recipe (because we are using other recipes for other layer) and it fell in the middle. I freeked and made another (about 2 hours later) and it worked perfect. THe only change I made is cutting one egg white. That can't be the answer, is it? FYI - previous reviews suggesting x2 on the syrup and less on the powdered sugar in the frosting are right!! As for accuracy of tiramisu - use mascarpone (sometimes expensive - but can be made at home very easily).

I made half of the recipe last weekend to try it out for a wedding cake. I made an eight inch cake, then a six inch with the remaining batter. I assembled the small cake first, then tested it and was a bit disappointed. So I used more syrup on the larger cake and topped it with sliced strawberries. I didn't want the syrup to taste bitter, so I added a small amount of milk and sugar to taste. The other reviewers were right - this cake is MUCH better the second and third day. The flavors meld and the texture of the cake is wonderful after a couple of days in the fridge. For the icing, I did add some gelatin to the cream after whipping it, and started with half of the powdered sugar and added more to taste, as other reviewers suggested. I also didn't use the Marsala in the icing. It tasted very good, but I don't think it would hold up great at room temperature for any length of time. So if I do use this for the wedding cake, I think I'll use a white chocolate buttercream for the outside and use a cream cheese flavored filling. I'll also put some sliced strawberries in the layers. So, even though I was unsure about this cake after that first taste test, I was very happy with it in the end. My brother told me it was his favorite of any cake I've made, and I think I have to agree!

I made this for my wedding to serve 150 people. Everyone loved it and thought that it was a great, unique cake. I practiced the recipe a few times, including one where I put ground hazelnuts into the cake (my mom loved it but i thought it was better without). I continue to have requests for this cake and it will alway be one of my (and my husband's) favorites.

I have made this cake at least 5 times in the past few years for friend's weddings. I live at 6,500 ft, and bake my cakes at 325*F instead of 350*F, and for 10 minutes less. The cake is more like a pound cake, and less of a fluffy white cake. I agree that the frosting may be a bit runny, but I read a review a few years back that advised to reduce the powdered sugar in the recipe, and this works great in creating a stiffer frosting. (I ususally use half the recommended amount at first, then to taste.) Pull out some of the cream cheese mix after adding only a little powdered sugar for piping. I also beat the whipping cream to almost 'stiff' and fold it in. Beat this first and use the same mixer for the cream cheese. Use only clear vanilla or none at all for a white cake. Double the syrup, and use it generously, but be careful to not use too much near the outside edge of the cakes, as it may leak out of the frosting. Try poking the tops of the cakes with a fork before using the syrup. I have never used the suggested fruit or mint, but it sounds good.

An excellant wedding cake - BUT use the recipe from the original magazine for the icing - this one is WRONG and makes way too much and it is much too runny. People are still talking about this cake from all of the weddings that I have make it for in the past years.

The flavour of this cake was very good. Interesting blend of the almond, coffee and cream cheese. I served it with some strawberries and it enhanced the flavour even more. I wouldn't compare this with a traditional Tiramisu made with mascarpone; I think it is a completely different cake. The icing was delicious, though a bit runny. I was disappointed however with the texture of the cake. Like others, mine also sank in the middle,was gummy and had a large dome top which I trimmed. I would use cake flour next time. I would make more soaking syrup as I didn't have enough. This cake tasted better the day after and even after freezing it. I had lots of leftover icing which I layered in a bowl with the cake trimmings, sort of like a trifle, and froze it for dessert for another day. Yummy.

I made this for a groom's cake and wish I had used more suggestions from previous bakers on this one. Since I bake a lot of cakes, I altered this slightly from the start: Used sifted cake flour instead of regular. To increase the height of a pan to 3 in. without buying a new pan, I made a foil collar 3 inches high (long piece the circumferance of the pan folded to ht. of 3")and placed in on the inside of the cake pan, tacked in place on the outside with tape--this works great. The cakes rose beautifully but needed a longer baking time than indicated and careful testing for doneness. One cake fell in the center, but I placed the thinnest layer on the bottom of that cake and leveled it with additional frosting. Wish I had used less powdered sugar (as suggested) and only would have needed 5 lbs. vs. 7 lbs. (10 - 8 oz. pkgs of cream cheese vs 14) as my frosting was a little soft. I did whip cream before blending it with cream cheese mixture. Nonetheless, I made it a full day before and it was all the better for the fridge time. I have enough frosting left over to fill AND frost a 9 " cake, but the cake was yummy and everyone enjoyed it! Does anyone have the June 1989 Bon Appetit --there's a fabulous white chiffon cake that could be substituted here and no problems with gooey centers.

I first made this cake four years ago and thought it was delicious then - although I agree the icing is a bit temperamental. I made the cake again yesterday (I used 1/3 of the recipe for a 10" layer cake) and added unflavored gelatin to the icing to stabilize it (use 1 packet Knox dissolved in 1/4 boiling water). It worked beautifully and the taste and texture were not adversely affected. I still had lots of icing left over so I used it to frost cinnamon rolls. Terrific cake!

I recieved raves on this cake!!! I had no problems with the frosting with a few modification: I used a product called "Pastry Pride" in place of the whipping cream and used brandy extract in place of the marsala. The cake held up beautifully even in the warm weather(it was not in the sun though). More soaking syrup could have been used, maybe it should be 1 1/2 recipes. Although the syrup did taste bitter alone, it was a perfect balance in the cake! Try this cake.

I was reading the reviews, as I'm considering this for my Aug wedding. For the frosting, it seems to make sense to whip the cream first, and then fold it into the cream cheese mixture. Did anyone try that?

Made 1/3 recipe in 9" pans as previous cooks have done. Did not like the flavoring (tasted a bit bitter/burnt) and cakes did not rise much (made the recipe TWICE since I thought I did something wrong--definitely did not need the 3" high pans). Thought the cake did not have much flavor (like a previous reviewer wrote "floury" taste). Really disappointed after reading all the great reviews. I will not try this recipe again.

Help! I've made this twice without any changes to the cake recipe and everyone loved it!! Still asking for more! I used Ganache as the frosting and a mascarpone filling. The only issue I had is that the center of the cake fell both times while cooling, making 3 even slices difficult. What am I doing wrong? The first time I did 2 10" round pans and the second 1 12x12x3 square. Thanks!

After making this recipe for 160 guests at my brother's wedding, the requests to make it for other events have not stopped. While I'm very fond of this cake personally, it has earned it's place at the top of my recipe list because so many guests, with so many different tastes, love it. Easy recipe to use and improvise with. Can be prepared in advance and frozen without lessening the quality.

I made a half recipe of the cake and frosting and a full recipe of the syrup. I baked the cake in 10" and 6" pans. The cake turned out good and got a lot of compliments. My only complaint is with me for not baking the 10" cake longer. It was doughy in the center and wouldn't soak up the syrup. My suggestion would be to put tin foil on top while it's baking, because my cake was dark brown and even a little black in spots, but the center wasn't done. Otherwise everything else was fine. Also, I whipped the heavy cream and folded it in the frosting, which was still quite soft. It was a hot day when I made it.

Absolutely divine. Followed all the advice below regarding the frosting which really helped. THe frosting was a little tempermental (hence the 3 forks) but it still worked well with frequent chilling. Made this for a 60th birthday party with chocolate 60's and raspberries all over the cake and it was a huge hit. Minced chocolate between the layers adds a wonderful texture as well. Superb.

After making a 9" test cake with this recipe, a friend and I decided that this cake was a must-have for her fall wedding. This cake is easy to make by wedding cake standards, I had no trouble with the frosting. I just added the cream very slowly. More syrup would be good, but since not everyone likes a strong coffee flavor, I will leave it as is for the wedding.

I just did a 9" "trial" version of this cake for my upcoming wedding. It was delicious! A very dense & moist crumb to the cake--outstanding. I too had trouble with runny frosting, even though I added whip cream stabilizer to the cream before folding it into the cream cheese/sugar frosting base. Even after refrigeration, it was too runny to pipe a decent basketweave. So for my wedding, I'll probably go with a swiss meringue buttercream (Martha has a great one on her website), which is much easier to work with for decorations (and probably more "melt resistant" for my spring wedding than this stuff!). I'd add more soaking syrup to the cake layers. I used Ghiradelli dark chocolate from Trader Joe's (they sell it in chopped up bars) and it was excellent. I might use the cream cheese frosting for the inner layers--or try the filling everyone seems to like from "Everybody's Favorite Tiramisu". I wonder how this would taste with a mocha buttercream on the outside? I sprinkled the top with more of the chocolate. It looked great. I might make this the groom's cake!

My 4 forks are only for the cake part of this recipe-- it was the best white cake I've ever tasted and will now be my standard (it was best hot out of the oven). I learned to make tiramisu from a friend from Milan and I wanted this to taste as authentic as possible. That said, for soaking syrup I brewed 1 pot of espresso (1 c), seasoned to taste with cream and sugar and let it simmer in a saucepan till slightly thickened. For the frosting and filling I used the frosting from the "lemon cake with lemon curd and mascarpone" recipe, omitting the lemon and adding 1 t vanilla after cooking the eggs. I made 1/3 the cake recipe in a 9" springform for a single birthday cake and it was a hit.

I've made this cake twice. Once a full recipe for a 60th wedding anniversary and once a 1/2 recipe for a friend's bridal shower. Both time it got rave reviews. The instructions were easy to follow and the assembly was not difficult. I did however have a terrible time with the frosting. It came out very soupy the first time and no matter how I tried to modify it it was still sloppy. During the party it began to slide off of the cake. The second time I made it I altered the frosting & cut way back on the cream cheese. That seemed to help a lot. I'd be interested to know if anyone else experienced the same problem.

Incredible cake!! I was nervous after reading the reviews, but it turned out beautifully. I made it in 6", 8", and 10" pans using the full recipe. I got by with an 8-qt mixing bowl. On the frosting, I made it the night before and froze overnight, and the consistency was fine. I watched it closely as I was making it to make sure it didn't get too runny. I am sure I didn't use all the powdered sugar but I did use a little Marsala wine. I would use more soaking syrup next time. I used the filling from the Our Favorite Tiramisu using mascarpone cheese, for more authentic flavor. I decorated with sugared rose petals (brush w/egg white, sprinkle on sugar) and sugared grapes, and chocolate designs on waxed paper. I also used a triangular cake decorator to "groove" the sides of the cake since swirling frosting is not my thing! Nobody could believe I had made the cake. It was great to be able to make ahead--don't be afraid of this cake!! It is wonderful!

This was an excellent cake! I made it twice to test the recipe first before making it for my sister's baby shower. The first time, I followed some of the other reviewers and made less of the soaking syrup. The cake seemed a bit "floury" to me but still nice. The problem was with the frosting - there is no way that the frosting would hold up a wedding cake like the photograph depicts. I only made one layer. It had a more custard like consistency and was not stiff enough. With my second try, I used 1/2 unbleached flour and 1/2 cake flour and the cake came out much lighter. I also whipped my heavy cream first and added a bit more powdered sugar to try to make the frosting a bit stiff - it held its shape a little better. What you would need to do is refrigerate it to keep the shape. Overall, this cake was a hit each time and as one reviewer stated, it tastes even better after 2 or so days.

I never made a cake before--not even a Duncan Hines cake-in-a-box--but I'm an adequate cook. I saw this recipe and it looked great. I read a bit about making cakes and bought some cake-making gear and gave it a try. We were married in a beautiful cathedral, the service and music were great, yet almost everyone raved about the cake the most (except for the beauty of the bride). It was a fairly warm Baltimore spring day and the frosting began to weaken. We put the frosted cake in a freezer for 1.5 hours before the reception and the day was saved. Nice cake!

I made this cake for my July wedding and it was delicious. Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe as it's written and didn't make any changes other than in decorating (berries were served in a compote on the side while the cake was decorated with fresh white freesia). I baked the layers 3 days in advance, made the frosting 2 days in advance and assembled the cake a day before the wedding...the cakes remained very moist and the flavors did get better with time (I made a small sample cake to test out the recipe months before). This is an amazing recipe!

I originally three-quartered the recipe and used it for the 6" and 12" layers of my sister's wedding cake. I prefer to double the soaking syrup for a stronger flavor, and the cake does improve the 2nd and 3rd days. Beat the cream cheese sparingly, just until smooth and it should hold up fine. I halved the recipe for a 6" and 9" layer cake for my niece's baptism, and decorated with raspberries and miniature roses. Also, as mentioned by other reviewers,a third of the recipe makes a 9" cake. Even people who don't generally like cake have raved about this, and people who don't bake ask for the recipe.

We were looking for something different for our wedding cake, and this was it. We had someone else make it, but the results were wonderful. Everyone loved the cake. Unfortunately the cake was so moist that when we went to take it apart, (we still had part of the middle and the bottom left), it fell apart. Fortunately we had already taken the top off, so we still have that for our anniversary.

I was looking for something different - and this was it! I just made 1 9 inch cake (divided the recipe by 3) and got rave reviews.

The frosting was great (although I did not use the marsala).

This cake was yummy, but a little too much effort to make the end result worth it. My favorite part was the chocolate/cream cheese taste combo (I left the chocolate a little rough so there was a tiny satisfying crunch) but I couldn't taste the espresso at all. Next time I'll just make tiramisu.

I made this for my reception and it was fabulous. It keeps very well. I froze the cake a month before and then decorated at the last minute.

Fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries were put in the layers, and I sweetened/macerated some fresh blackberries for the side. I also used whipped cream stabilizer (as one reviewer suggested) but wasn't piping decorations, so used 1 tsp. per cup of whipping cream. I'll make it again.

I reduced this recipe by half and used regular springform pans. The cake was good but the frosting was delicious -- I will use it again to fill tarts and cover with berries. I wish I had read the reviews and caught the hint about the whipping cream stabilizer. Instead, I froze my prepared cake layers before assembly and that afforded me some stability. Since fresh berries are hard to get this time of year, I used fresh roses atop the cake. Beautiful!

This was the best cake I have ever made and I'm a cake decorator.If you want a 3inch tall cake in a nine inch pan, dividethe recipe by three.Trust me, I did it three times!! To make the icing firm, I added a tbsp of whipped cream stabilzer(find at a cake store)for every cup of cream,then whipped.I then folded it into the whipped cheese. I also omitted the marsala, I thought that would only make the icing more runny. The recipe calls to leave the icing at room temp for an hour, but I would refridgerate it a little so it is firm enough to coat the cake.The remaining icing firmed up nice in the fridge overnight.I made this cake for a shower and got requests to make it for future events.Problems will arise if you don't follow the recipe closely. Sift the flour before measuring!!Another reviewer complained about the cake not rising, this was a result of using baking soda instead of baking powder. Don't substitute any ingredients for others.This icing will not hold up in the sun, you must use a shortening based icing; the hydrogenated oils in the shortening will keep the icing stable. My family loved the icing!This cake can definately be made a couple days ahead. It is very moist and the longer you leave it, the more the flavours meld. Totally yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!

I haven't made this yet, but wan't to give some advice on the frosting. After reviewing some of the complaints and the ingredients in the recipe, I think maybe some people may have used low-fat or non-fat cream cheese. These contain a great deal of water and will not give the same results as full fat cream cheese. I learned this from a professional chef, and just thought I might pass this on for future bakers. Just as an aside I ordered via mail a 6" Tirimisu cake for Christmas dinner and it was almost $50! This I will try instead!

I have made the cake only, and assembled the layers with either a Mascarpone Cream filling with fruit, or with lemon mousse filling. It was divine! Every time I have served it professionally (I am a caterer) it was rated the best white cake ever. The layers also freeze very well, so it is great to have them on hand to serve with fruit & berries for a quick shortcake. BEST EVER!!!

I also thought the icing was too thin, next time I don't think I will add as much cream and sugar. My biggest problem was the coffee syrup. It was terribly runny and smelled like scorched coffee, what a waste of Kahlua. I think I might have not stirred it enough, any ideas on that? Anyway, I had a bottle of iced coffee syrup in the correct flavor, so that worked out okay. I do want to say that everyone was impressed with the fact that it was decorated with berries and served with the berries on the side. For additional color, I had set it on an acrylic cake plate over a wreath I made with protea, bird of paradise and gingers.

I gave this cake a 4 for taste, but I did have some difficulty with the frosting. Can someone give me advice. When I first made the frosting, it was the consistentcy of pastry cream.This worked fine for the filling, but it would not have been thick enought to pipe with a pastry tube.I filled the cakes and put a thin layer of frosting on outside to seal in crumbs. I refrigerated frosting and cake overnight. The next day I planned to finish frosting the outside and decorate. The reserved frosting was runny. I tried beating it more, tried adding more powdered sugar, etc. nothing worked. From the reviews I see some said they added more sugar and others said to use less. I thought maybe the cream should be beaten first before adding to the cream cheese powdered sugar mixture but did not find this in the recipe. Help! I loved the cake and want to do it again with decaorations.

After getting feedback from a prior reviewer of this recipe, it worked out wonderfully! I made this for my daughter's wedding and was concerned about the frosting not holding up (an outdoor event.) The advice I received was to be careful not to add too much powdered sugar, it will make the frosting thinner. I followed this carefully and found it makes a very big difference. The guests loved the cake and I have made smaller versions since. Everyone enjoys it!

I had friend make this for my Wedding Reception - delicious, although she used a lot more soaking liquid.

It was great, but don't leave it out for long, as it starts to slide!! One person actually got down on his knees and kow-towed to my friend, he loved it so much!!

To answer the review below....YES, this cake rises a bunch as long as your baking powder is fresh. (Go to your local bridal cake store for the cake tins that are 3 in. tall. If you don't have one, come to Austin, I'll take you to mine!!) If you really want to make this a special cake, don't use the frosting to spread in between layers. Use a mascarpone cheese / espresso / brandy mixture (omit the egg yolks) as a filling. Add in some cream cheese for stability. Combined with the brushing of the cake layers with the liquor....ooohhhhh man. Oh, and if you want your frosting to stand up to the sun in an outdoor wedding....DO NOT use this frosting. It will get soft quickly. I used a veg. shortning based cream cheese frosting that tasted great and held up in the hot Texas sun. This recipe will make a 12" layer cake and a 9" layer cake if you only want 2 tiers. One more thing....mix the batter in the biggest, baddest bowl you have. No less than a 12 quart bowl unless you want to end up like me and do all the measuring and mixing twice (a pain!!)

I made this cake for a friend's bridal shower. It was incredible - you wouldn't believe the response I got from the 50 guests. There was no cake left over. We made the layers two days ahead and froze them. Also, the frosting was a little runny, a pastry chef friend of mine suggested using less powdered sugar. I loved it!

This recipe is wonderful. I cut the recipe in half for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I would make it again and again and again.

I made this cake for my own small wedding, using the guidance below. I made a third of the recipe and got a gorgeous single-layer 12-inch cake which would easily feed 25 people. It was a huge success - I'm glad I finally chose this recipe of the many I looked at!

I saw this recipe featured on this website last spring and decided that it was going to be my wedding cake. The amounts were altered for an intimate party of 12 (my husband and I included.) The frosting held up quite nicely, even outside in the California sun. It was served with raspberries,blueberries,and strawberries and is still the most delicious dessert I have ever tasted! I have given out many copies of the recipe. Phenomenal!!!

Good as regular cake, not good as wedding cake: the cream cheese frosting is too soft. How can I make it more stiffer? It's very runny and yet we chill it all the time. Otherwise it's heavenly

I made this cake for my wedding and it turned out fabulous! I baked and sliced the cake layers 2 weeks ahead of time, wrapped each layer individually in plastic and foil, and froze it. I added a little more powdered sugar to the frosting to make it a little more substantial. I crystallized pansies and rose petals as decoration, because fancy frosting is not a talent I posess. I left out the fresh berries (had enough to think about.) Everyone raved about it. This is an excellent recipe!! Be careful, though...you'll be asked to make it again and again!

This is one of the best desserts I have ever tasted. I made it for my sisters bridal shower and everyone couldn't believe how beautiful it looked and tasted. I didn't use any fruit and it was still great. I put the heads of 2 fresh pink roses on the top for a garnish. It was my first big cake and well worth the effort. I am looking for an exucse to make it again.

I made this cake for a special birthday party and it was more than a hit. Even after eating quite a large dinner guests wolfed down large pieces of cake while raving and asking for the recipe. I cut the recipe in half as suggested by one of the reviews and it worked out great. I ommitted the berries and used Rum in addition to Khalua in the syrup. The only drawback was that the cream-cheese frosting has a tendency to melt in warm weather so that piped decorations end up drooping.

This summer I will be making this cake for another wedding, maybe two! I made it the first time in 1995 and enjoyed the experience even in the late July heat. I garnished with fresh mint from my garden.

I made this cake for my nieces bridal shower. It looked beautiful and tasted fantastic....everyone wanted to know what bakery had made it. I would definately recommend this cake for any special occasion.

I did try this recipe again and cut the quantity in half! It made 2-8-inch cakes with 3" sides and a 6-inch pan. IT WAS DELICIOUS! If you are going to make this for a special function-try this: Instead of serving with the fresh fruit,(since this is hard to take to the party) put a layer of fresh strawberries sliced in one of the layers and fresh blueberries in the other layer. That way you have the fruit but it is inside the cake!!

I made this recipe with two 9inch. Based on the pans used, I cut the entire recipe in thirds and the quantities worked out beautifully. So, I highly recommend this cake even if it's only for a smaller get together!
