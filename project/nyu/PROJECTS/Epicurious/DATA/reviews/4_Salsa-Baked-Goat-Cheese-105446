Who doesn't enjoy a big pot of melted cheese? The flavors in this dish aren't going to blow anyone away, but it always vanishes quickly at parties anyway. It's fast, easy, and cheap, and I imagine it's going to become one of my party staples.

Delicious, quick and easy! Because I made it for a Halloween party, I used dry roasted pepitas in place of the nuts, and it was fantastic. I made a large batch(10.5 oz goat cheese to 8oz cream cheese) for 6 people, and there wasn't any left over. And of those 6 people, 2 don't usually like goat cheese, but they loved this. I think I'll be making this for parties and potlucks often!

Made this last Friday for book club, and everyone loved it! I didn't have time to make the salsa to used fresh-store bought and it still turned out great. Will try the home-made salsa next time.

Let's see... epicurious tells me I added this to my recipe box in January 2007. I can guarantee I've made this for 70-80% of every social function I've been to since then. So simple (I just buy whatever salsa strikes my fancy) and everyone loves it. Everytime.

Rating: 4
I'd give this four forks just on taste alone, but when you consider how easy it is, it's a no-brainer. I use Frontera chipotle or guajillo salsa to save time. Every single time I serve it people rave about it like crazy. I'm always forwarding the recipe link to my friends after a party.

I brought this to a superbowl party last year and everyone raved. It's really yummy exactly as is. I think the salsa is terrific. And it's easy and travelled well. I, too, roasted all the veggies at once, removing as they were done.

I'm a HUGE Rick Bayless fan, and buy his bottled Frontera salsas at Whole Foods on a regular basis. I thought this was quite good - simple as can be too. I swear, though, that it called for pepitas, and I recall that I used more than the recipe called for.

I made this with the Roasted Jalapeno-Tomato Salsa and will try again with jarred salsa for those days when I don't have the time to make salsa. The pine nuts give this a delicious flavor.

I have made this many times and agree with the rave reviews. I served it with a new twist at a cocktail party recently. I topped thin sesame wafers with the cheese mixture, then a bit of hot pepper jelly on half the wafers and fig preserve on the other half. They disappeared in a flash.

This appetizer disappeared at my patio party. Everyone raved, wanted recipe, yadda yadda yadda...all true. Even people who professed to hate goat cheese loved it. Plus, super easy.

Rating: 3
Made as directed all in advance. Plated the cheese mixture in oven safe shallow pan and refrigerated. Prepared the salsa and refrigerated separately. Poured salsa over top - only used half - prior to baking. Extend the heating time another 5-10 min due to chilling. Served with tostada scoops. Delicious. Would not skip making the salsa - spicy and great flavour. Used the balance to go with burritos, would also be good alone as salsa dip for tortilla chips.

Won't rate this recipe because of three changes I made for various reasons of necessity, which all worked: used dry roasted pistachios in the cheese mixture, Fritos Scoops for dipping, and Archer Farms (Target brand) roasted chile salsa. Guests ate it all despite the fortyteen other dishes on the table.

Rating: 4
On a hot and humid day, I wondered what I was doing serving a heated recipe to nosh on before dinner but one bite convinced me that this was a true winner. Even without Rick's roasted salsa (I doctoered up some fresh store-bought salsa) it was fab. This disappeared in about 15 minutes and it couldn't be easier to make.

This was a very good appetizer that complimented a Mexican theme buffet for a party. I used walnuts instead of pinenuts because I had plenty in my pantry and pinenuts were outrageously priced at the store. I went ahead and made the salsa because of the rave reviews, but I wasn't thrilled with it. It was fine, but in response to the reviewer that felt this dish wouldn't be nearly as good without the salsa... I disagree. While I don't paritcularly love store-bought, jarred salsa either, but in a pinch, it would work equally as well. If you have a fabulous fresh salsa recipe that you enjoy making, go ahead and use it for this! I know I will next time.

Rating: 4
Delicious! My guests ate it up in no time. The salsa is fab on its own too.

Simple. Delicious. I doubled the recipe and substituted store-bought roasted red pepper salsa rather than making my own salsa and it was equallly good. I also added chopped cilantro to the cheese mixture and garnished the plate with fresh cilantro. They gobbled it up.

I made this for our monthly 'card-night' gathering. AWESOME!!! I made the salsa from scratch the night before and it was really easy and worth it. I questioned the salsa combining well with the cheese, but it really somehow went perfectly together. I did not change a thing. My guests could not stop eating it! This is a keeper.

This was a huge hit for our Mexican patio party. I love dishes you can prepare ahead of time, especially when you're hosting a party. I made the cheese disk earlier in the day, then at party time, spoon the salsa over the cheese and bake! I used a good purchased salsa with roasted jalapeno's. A huge time saver and tasted great!

What an easy and yummy appetizer! This was the hit of the party. I did use store bought salsa (chipotle), which made preparing this dish even easier.

Rating: 3
This is a very simple and extremely delicious appetizer. The salsa takes a little time because of the roasting, but is still pretty easy and so worth the effort. I don't think the dish would taste nearly as good with purchased salsa. The roasting of the veges in this salsa make it one of the best salsas I've ever tasted - rich and complex flavors. I'm looking forward to using it on grilled chicken and other fish. Doubled this recipe and took it to a party with 8 women - it was gone and everyone wanted the recipe!

Everyone LOVES this appetizer! The combo flavors is fantastic!! Always a major hit . . . I usually double the recipe because people can never get enough.

Whenever I make this I triple the cheese/pine nuts part of the recipe, put the extra two cheese disks in the freezer, and buy a couple of jars of Frontera's Roasted Poblano or Chipotle salsa to stick in the pantry. Then whenver I need a quick appetizer, I've got one on hand. It's best with the fresh salsa, but a really good jarred salsa is a great timesaver.

This was yummy! I enjoyed making the homemade salsa and how can you go wrong with anything that has cheese that you warm up as a dip! I served it with tortilla chips and sat on our patio with a margarita on a nice California spring evening. Perfecto!

This was wonderful! We really loved the roasty-toasty flavor of the salsa, and it was easier to make than I had feared- all the chopping done in the food processor. Didn't tell anyone it was goat cheese and they devoured it in no time! (A bunch of picky mid-western farmers.) The salsa is pretty spicy- so watch out- but deeelicious!

Rating: 4
Oh, oh, oh, was this EVER good...I thought my guests were going to start fighting over who got to finish this dip!! Fantastic recipe, the roasted jalapeno-tomato salsa is delicious, although I can see this recipe working with store-bought salsa too. The only thing I would do differently next time is to up the amount of salsa to 1.5 cups - towards the end, there was much more cheese than salsa left. Otherwise, incredible!

I have made this several times for parties. I double the recipe and it is always one of the first dishes emptied. I use herbed goat cheese and 2 cups of chipotle salsa which gives it a rich, smokey flavor.

I think this is my first 4-fork review! This was delicious and easy. Our guests couldn't get enough - we practically licked the dish clean at the end.

Thought this was just okay, but don't think I baked it long enough to get that creamy texture. So will give it another try, but will use a fresh salsa drained a bit. (Nn]ot cooked as the one referenced in the recipe.) I think the freshness would brighten the flavors a bit. That is not to say I did not like the salsa recipe. Loved it and will make that time and time again just to eat with chips.

This was a great tasting, fast, and easy dish! I definitely plan on making it again! We served it to a group of mainly 20-something men. At first they were a little wary of eating goat cheese, but once they tasted it, they couldn't get enough! It was a definite hit!

I thought this was very good. If you have the time, the Roasted Jalapeno-Tomato Salsa is easy and delicious! The only changes I made were to use a whole onion rather than half , and one jalapeno instead of 2 or 3.

Soooo good. The salsa is a must - the combination of goat cheese pine nuts and salsa is unbeatable. I served it with warm triangles of greek pita. The leftovers got brought out during dinner - absolutely addictive. In a pinch I could see doing it up with a quality store bought salsa.

Phenomenally good and easy. I use whatever Frontera salsa is in my cupboard and it's always delicious. For any reviewers who have not given this 4 forks, what salsa have you used? Rick Bayless' salsas are great and really make this what it is. I live only a few blocks from Frontera Grill/Topolobampo, and this dip is equal to what you would get there (except who makes their own chips at home?!?).

Everyone loved this so much they were scraping the dish! Served it as a starter for a Mexican-themed dinner, and served the leftover salsa with quesadillas and tomato-herb salad from this website. Finished off with the coffee ice-cream and chocolate sauce dessert. All my guests raved about the entire evening. The salsa was easier than I expected to make, and had a complex flavour you would NEVER get from store-bought salsa. I will make this again and again!

I have made this twice now for friends and I got rave reviews both times. It is easy to make ahead and requires only a few minutes to bake just prior to your guests arriving. I followed the recipes exactly with one exception - I do not add the water to the salsa. I used 3 jalapenos in one batch and it was really great. Used only 2 in the next batch. I prefer 3 but if you like a milder salsa, you better stick with using 2.

Rating: 3
Very easy and tasty using Frontera store bought salsa. I drained the salsa a bit, but was still a bit watery. I may try doubling the pinenuts next time as suggested by another reviewer and may increase the heat a bit as the cheese really mellowed out the taste. Used lime flavored tortilla chips to scoop up the salsa-cheese. Reipe could possibly use a little tinkering, but overall very good and quite easy if you use store bought salsa. I'm going to Rick Bayless' restaurant this summer and can't wait!

This one is a keeper...thanks to the reviewer who suggested to drain the salsa beforehand...I did just that, but saved the juices and added a bit back during the last five minutes in the oven. All my guests loved it...It was colorful and delicious. With the red and white it will make a great Chistmas dish and served with blue corn chips will make a great Fourth of July treat.

I'll try anything that rates 4 forks and this certainly deserves the rating. It is a huge bang for the minimal effort amount of effort it takes to make. A local B&B proprietress left withteh recipe and she is a great cook.There was none left -well maybe enough for a couple of chips the morning after.I too used the Fronetera Roasted Tomato Salsa. Next time I may try it with a Mango or Tomitillo Salsa. Really, you should try this recipe. I don't think you'll have regrets.

Luckily I doubled the goat cheese part of the recipe. This is soooo good. The salsa was also very good, even with winter store bought plum tomatoes. I am looking forward to making it with my own home grown plum tomatoes. The salsa was a little too hot for me until it was baked on the goat cheese - then it was perfect.

I made this with bottled salsa because I didn't have time to make homemade (kick me off if you want, the entire rest of the menu was from scratch). I wish that I had drained the salsa some first, as the final product was pretty watery. It tasted fabulous, however, and I would definitely make it again.

I just wanted to concur with Seattle. Sorry "chefs" but sometimes store bought salsa can be great, espcially if you buy the Rick Bayless brand. Sure, when tomatoes are in season and you have the time making homemade salsa is a grand idea, but in winter, I say buy bottled! No more snobbery! (I'm making this recipe this weekend for a Forty Niner Game Party, and using a bottle of salsa - it sounds great!)

I'm not rating as I haven't made it - but find it to be hitting my "possible" list for the Superbowl. Just wanted to comment to the 2 cooks who find the store-bought salsa thought horrible. You'll notice that quite a few of the reviewers purchased the Frontera salsa - which is a Rick Bayless product. And since he created and published this recipe to begin with, I do believe that in a pinch, using his product would suffice. Kudos to the cook from Ft. Worth for not allowing the "chef" snobs to poke fun.

Thanks for the suggestion of using store-bought salsa. Sometimes you are short on time and just don't have the time. Perhaps if others that responded weren't such cooking snobs with a wooden spoon up their back sides, they would understand that it's always nicer to be able to follow a recipe to the letter, but sometimes not possible. If you're both so good, get a show.

I was very optimistic about this because of all the great reviews, but I was somewhat disappointed in the dish. All in all, it tasted almost bland...it needed more flavor. I used plain goat cheese crumbles instead of the roll, but it molded fine with the cream cheese to make the dish. I also used store bought salsa. It was easy to make, and it wasn't bad, but it I just kept saying to myself "This is missing something".

Curious at the vast discrepency in ratings and having a jar of roasted tomato sauce from Frontera Grill on hand, I made this for friends. The other cook in the foursome said he would make it, my husband loved it and I (somewhat pickier) thought it was good, and given the ease of preparation, worth doing again. It would probably be better with homemade sauce, of course. But really fast if you're using a jar.
