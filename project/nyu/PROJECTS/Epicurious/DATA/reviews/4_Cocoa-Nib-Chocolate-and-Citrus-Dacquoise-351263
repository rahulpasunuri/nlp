This is really awesome, but it is a little complicated for me. I am sticking to this one http://www.gourmetrecipe.com/recipes/all-american-chocolate-cake.

This intimidating recipe is delicious and really not that difficult. I just had difficulty getting the glaze to cover the sides but when the cake is cut into slices you would never recognize a poor frosting job. I also used 1/2 cup of store bought red raspberry jam. Use it at room temp to make it easy to spread. This thin fruit layer added a nice surprise and next time I will add more. The mascarpone cream is good but very rich so next time I will not use it all. I also don't understand why it needs to be refrigerated for an hour because after 30 minutes it was firm enough to support the weigh t of the layers. By mistake I let the meringue bake for an extra 30 minutes at 300 degrees so I didn't let it sit in the oven overnight and they still were fine. Don't be intimidated by all the steps! The cake is good on the first day and also a few days later however the meringues lose their crispy texture and become more cake like on day two but still good. This fancy adult cake is being devoured by my boys and their friends so I would say it's a winner.

I was going to post pictures, but it seems Epicurious doesn't allow for that. If anyone would like to see photos of my process, check out this post on my little cooking blog: http://lindseysluscious.blogspot.com/2012/ 02/50-years-demands-very-special- birthday.html

I had this dessert prepared by a professional chef at a dinner party, and it was CRAZY DELICIOUS! I wondered if a mere mortal who didn't graduate from Hyde Park would be able to recreate it? As it turns out, you can! The steps aren't even all that difficult, but the whole affair takes roughly FOREVER! Of course, most of that is passive time, waiting for things to dry or cool or chill. Here are my tips: First, I would recommend using only 1/2 cup cocoa nibs, as more is overkill. Also, I found that flour- added baking spray on the parchment and baking tin made the meringues release without a problem. Make sure to let them dry thoroughly, or they will dissolve when they come into contact with the cream filling. I don't enjoy the orange-chocolate combo, so I used black raspberry jam and my friend the caterer used blackberry--both were super-delicious. I agree with the other reviewer who said that the worst part is getting the chocolate chiffon cake transferred, but waxed paper and two wide pancake turners really helped. Mine still cracked on one side, but it all gets squished together and glazed, so no one was the wiser. I also recommend making half again as much chocolate glaze as the recipe calls for, and splurge on a high-quality chocolate (I used Callebaut) which makes all the difference. And lastly, to cut the slices easily and perfectly, use a HOT serrated knife, reheated and wiped clean between each slice. This isn't the easiest dessert I've ever made, but it was certainly the BEST!

This cake is awesome. I got rave reviews as being one of my best cakes ever. Do not skip the cocoa nibs, they add a lot to the texture. I got mine @whole foods (6 oz for ~$8) and ground by hand using a zyliss rotary. I left out the orange, because I don't like it. I also stacked the choc cake and then put on cream layer, let that set for 15 mins then added top meringue.I will make this again.

Omg i have made this cake so many time i love it. I do say let the meringue be in the oven for better taste and dont chill or warm up the glaze once u have made it. Just let is sit out on the counter for a few hours and then put the cake together it makes much a difference. By the way use a 8 ounce contanier not a 14 i have done that and it tastes the smae its just alot.This cake is perfect for all types of ocations.

This is a DELICIOUS dessert, but a bit tricky. I struggled with the chocolate chiffon cake - after two failures, I opted for using basic chocolate layer cake. I also added 1 shot of Grand Marnier poured over the chocolate cake. I decorated with candied orange rind (which are a bit time consuming, but pretty easy if you have a candy thermometer). The cocoa nibs were hard to find - they taste like bitter chocolate. I think ground chocolate covered espresso beans could be a find substitute. I had to make 1 1/2 batches of the glaze to get it to cover well, but it looked gorgeous. The flavors and textures are rich and complex - a grown-up dessert that is a show stopper!

very rich, and delicious! the citrus is the perfect accent flavor to make the cake unique! the cocoa nibs added a fun crunch, and the mascarpone whipped cream is AMAZING!! the meringues were a bit soft, but that was probably because of moisture from the adjacent mascarpone whipped cream layers

this cake is amazing I doubled the cake part to make two layers of cake and I poured a shot of grand marnier on each layer. I have been asked to make this cake again. This is the second cake I have ever made and I found the recipe easy to follow and with a little help from youtube my meringues came out well.

Best cake I've ever eaten in my life, hands down. quite a bit of work, but well worth it.

Delicious ingredients, weird-to-impossible execution. My meringue stuck to the parchment paper and had to be thrown away. The cake was a goop of (delicious) cream, (delicious) chocolate, and (delicious) cake. Next time I'll make 2 layers of cake and forget the meringue.

Made this for my honey for Valentine's dinner at home tonight and despite all the work, it was worth the effort. He raved about it aloud was I was mentally patting myself on the back. The contrast of textures-- the creamy layers, the meringues and the chocolate cake and of tastes- sweet, bittersweet and fruity was intriguing. This dessert was quite time-consuming in terms of making all the different pieces, but the chill times in the recipe were longer than necessary (in Feb) so that was some consolation. It was tricky getting the cake layer onto the base layer w/o breaking it, but using 2 wide pancake turners and preparing the cake layer (w/marmelade) on a waxed paper base helped. Subbed Gran Marnier for Campari as I wasn't able to find anything smaller than a 750ml bottle of Campari after visiting 2 liquor stores. As others have said, this makes for a nice special occasion dessert.

This recipe was FANTASTIC. It was time consuming, but although it looks confusing, it is not difficult for someone with at least some experience. Don't try to make this cake if you have never made a cake before because the instructions are sometimes not very clear. Besides that, this cake was amazing! I made this for my mom's birthday, but left out the orange marmalade and orange segments because neither my mom nor I like chocolate and fruit together. I was not sure how good this would be, but I loved it!!!!! If you are undecided about making this, definitely do!!!!!

I made this twice. The first time it was a huge mess but was consumed within 30 minutes of setting it out at a party. The second time I built the layers into a springform pan. This was a marvelous idea and I highly recommend it. It had a much more appealing round shape. Flavorwise, this is a dark chocolate not so sweet cake. The citrus is a lovely surprise and doesn't taste overly orange-y if you follow the directions and use Campri as suggested. I will be making this again. My guests were very impressed.

This cake was really good and I would definitely make it again. The cutting was no big deal - wiping the knife between pieces was all that was required. The marmalade was delicious however I found it cooked the rind too much so I cut it off so it wasn't too chewy. The nibs were very interesting for texture but didn't really add a lot of flavour for the extra cost. However if I wasn't using I wouldn't replace with cocoa, I'd just leave it out. Initially I thought there wouldn't be enough glaze but there was plenty. It's meant to be a thin coating. It was cholatey and rich but not overwhelming. It was pretty and very company worthy. Yum!

I have mixed feelings about this one. I didn't think it was actually too difficult, just time-consuming with the various "wait 30 minutes" steps. None of the pieces were complicated. The overall cake was impressive looking (though messy) and super interesting, but the flavors just didn't quite work for me-- a little too bitter, especially the meringues, I think. However, some of my guests loved it, so it might be a matter of taste. Also-- one of the other reviewers mentioned doubling the glaze, so I did that, but I had tons left over, so I think you'd probably be fine with the recipe as is.

I made this cake twice, for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's absolutely delicious. I cut it with a serated knife for best results and to show off the beautiful layers. The coca nibs are a must. It adds just the right crunch to the meringues, but be sure to order the right thing. They are not chocolate covered. I ground them with my zylis and it was perfect. Only thing I would suggest is a bit more orange flavor with the addition of orange liquor perhaps over the chiffon cake.

In response to those who had trouble cutting it ~ I ran my knife under very hot water before every other slice. No problems at all. And, btw, don't skip the nibs! I didn't grind them completely (was using a pestle) and having little chunks of them in each bite was heavenly.

This dessert is over-the-top delicious! I skipped the marmalade (used a little apricot jam instead) and it was divine. Not at all hard to make, just takes many steps, including an overnight step. Elegant - worthy of New Year's Eve.

This did take two days to make -- the dacquiose and the marmalade on Saturday and assemble the cake the next day. But I brought it to my cooking/dinner group and they went crazy. It looked beautiful and tasted great. I substituted chocolate covered cocoa nibs for the plain cocoa nibs. Worked fine.

This was a very time consuming cake but well worth the experience. I do agree with other reviewers that the cocoa nib was a little extravagant and could probably be substituted with similar results. For those having trouble with the meringue: My meringue was misshapen and lumpy, but I could easily press it into the proper size and shape after it had dried overnight.

Haven't finished making this yet,but to save anyone else an extra trip to the store you definitely need double the amount of glaze if you want to cover the cake completely.I have only done the first assembly step and I can see there won't be enough.

While an impressive-sounding ("Cocoa nibs" gives it such an exotic ring) and beautiful looking cake, using some of the more delicate pastry techniques, I believe this is a misuse of the Cocoa Nib. "Cocoa nibs"--or "Cacao nibs"--are the raw, roughly ground version of the cacao bean. They are becoming a popular food in the "health food" category these days for many reasons, including their energy-boosting properties and their high antioxidant content (they are considered a "superfood"). They are also pretty expensive. They are best when their intense bitter taste and hard texture can be displayed and their health benefits used. Here, they are just filler to make the cake look original. Use cocoa powder and save yourself the trouble. The lack of a structured substance in this cake makes it a quandary for the cutting as well, as another reviewer has pointed out

while it took some advanced planning to make - it was well worth it - unable to find cocoa nibs but substituted cocoa powder - next time will look for the "nibs". Served for a family dinner and it was a definite hit. Note: served one day after making it but kept well for several days in the fridge and was enjoyed. Yes the blood orange marmalade was certainly an important part of the whole cake experience

The cake recipe was awful. The oil taste made the entire thing inedible. I threw it out. So much for making a birthday cake.

I made this cake after ordering Cocoa nibs on line. I ordered the wrong thing- I ended up with chocolate bars with cocoa nibs in them. I had a heck of a time cutting this cake, It's possible that the meringues were too dry and hard too cut because I ended up using cocoa powder instead of the nibs. I am looking for a few tips in cutting this cake. Oherwise it was delicious.

Forgot to mention I found cocoa nibs at Whole Foods in the homeopathic/nutritional supplements aisle (had to ask where to find it since it's not in the baking section). You can also mail order Valrohna nibs that are supposed to be better but that's a pain...

Where did others find cocoa nibs? My supermarket had never heard of them. Any ideas for a close substitute?

Felt like more than six hours to make, especially if you make the marmalade (which is more intensely orange tasting than the store bought); the marmalade isn't that obvious when you eat the cake though (probably no difference if you use regular oranges). This is one ugly cake, which you can probably get a sense of from the Bon Appetit photo (you can see my version on flickr by searching for "citrus dacquoise cream"). If I were to do it again, I'd see if I could get it into a rectangular bar shape instead so cutting would be easier. I'd also use a frosting spreading knife to flatten out the meringue as much as possible before cooking it (the bottom flaked away when I cooked mine so neither side was flat). I also needed twice as much glaze to smooth the cake and sides reasonably. It is great tasting and much lighter than it looks because of the dacquoise layers, and the citrus marmalade adds an interesting twist to it. As long as your guests don't care about looks, they'll be impressed.

I'm created the meringues last night, but they did not cook flat(even though I spread evenly in the pan). Did anyone have issues with this? I'm afraid my cake will be lopsided.

This takes six hours to make, and I used store-bought kumquat marmalade. It was worth all of the time, however. Even my kids were impressed. Next time I won't bother trying to get the glaze to cover the sides. It was the best cake I've ever made - and I've made plenty.

In response to A Cook 02/06/09, I would not substitute cocoa powder for the nibs. Cocoa nibs have cocoa butter. Cocoa powder would be too dry. I would try bittersweet chocolate pieces or chips.

For some reason, my four forks did not show up-- hope they do here. I also wanted to add that the recipe for the blood orange marmalade is not included with this recipe--you must look it up separately and right now, it is on the second page of recipes given when you search for blood orange marmalade.

Outrageous!! It takes some time, but can be made ahead. I did make the marmalade and it was fabulous. My cake shrank, also. You could probably reduce the size of the meringues to compensate. Mine served 14 easily, so you could still probably get 12 pieces with a smaller diameter. Everyone raved!!

Oops. In my previous review I forgot to say that I didn't use the marmalade and orange segments. Too many in my house don't want fruit in their chocolate!

This was excellent. Made cake 1 day ahead. The cake shrunk quite a bit after baking, so I piped meringue into 8-inch circles, but still had to trim them a little so they wouldn't be wider than the cake. For glaze used 4 oz bittersweet and 2 oz semisweet. Held together very well. Great for special occasions
