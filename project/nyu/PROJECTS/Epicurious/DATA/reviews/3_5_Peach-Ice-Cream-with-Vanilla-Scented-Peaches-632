Found this was a lovely recipe, but O cannot stress enough, you must start with very good peaches, isn't that the whole point.Luckily we have peach trees in my yard and my spouse is a peach snob.

I made this recipe several years ago and had forgotten about it. My husband, a real peach ice cream lover, didn't like it at all - it had no discernable flavor. Not realizing that I had made this before, I tried the recipe again....same results. I'm not a novice cook and feel that perhaps it might have something to do with the quality of peaches we get in Arizona. If you get *good* peaches, you might like it. I doubt that I'll give this another try.

This ice cream is amazing. My husband, who typically doesn't care for fruit ice creams, was blown away when he tried it. The texture is luscious and the flavors are subtle and elegant. The yield is just a bit more than my ice cream maker can handle, but I may have used a bit more fruit than was needed. I did use exceptionally tasty late-season peaches, which no doubt helped, but the base is a very good ice cream nonetheless. This is on my list next peach season.

Tastes like Mom's! I used 5 big ripe Washington State peaches -- at least 2 lbs. -- for the ice cream alone. I didn't need the lemon juice, and I pulled about a cup of the peaches out of the processor before I finished the puree. I added it back into the custard/peach mixture right before it all went into the ice cream maker, so I could have some chunks of peach in the final product. Didn't bother with the sauce.

very weird texture... tasted alright, though my little brother found it too vanilla-y and not peachy enough... may have been that the peaches weren't just right, but who knows. don't think i'll make it again... i liked the taste but the texture was just...strange.

Great tasting ice cream,I've made it twice. Making it is a little tedious, what with the peeling and then straining of the peaches. The second time I made it I skipped straining the custard as I had absolutely no lumps. To the "Cook from NY on 8/24" you're not supposed to boil the milk and peels, you have to brink it to a SIMMER, then turn the heat to the lowest possible point and barely simmer for the next 20 minutes. Cooking the custard also requires a low heat to prevent curdling. Stir frequently so that the bottom does not get brown. Making the wine syrup is a snap.

Not a big fan of the corn syrup and had a hard time keeping my custard from turning to scrambled eggs. I found a double boiler to help immensely. You really need tasty peaches for this and I think mine were just ok.

the ice crem tastes great, but making it was a problem from the beggining. when I boiled the peach skins and pits in cream and milk, the cream mixture unpleasantly curdeled and even blending didn't help much... it tasted great, but...

Like the cook from Brooklyn, I thought this ice cream was delicious but had a very weird and unpleasant texture. It coated the inside of my mouth with a grainy, buttery feel. Judging from all the comments, I must have done something wrong. I did use 2% milk instead of whole milk, but other people mentioned doing this without a problem. The Brooklyn cook mentioned not getting the mash cool enough, which does seem like a possibility because we did have to churn for a longer period of time than with other recipes we've made. I will try it again, because the flavor (before freezing)was wonderful.

I hesitate to add my "two cents worth" except that I may help someone else. I did not have the exact ingredients on hand but it still worked beautifully! I had only half and half, 2% milk and peaches that were were cooked into a syrup....my husband loved it and he grew up on a peach orchard! I didn't make the sauce, I used all the peaches in the ice cream...will definately make this again!

This is an incredible ice cream! It can be improved, You need to double it, because 8 servings just whets the appetite. Our family loved it.

Just made the ice cream, exactly according to the directions, and it was wonderful! Love the peachy taste in the custard itself as well as the chunks of pureed paches. Will make this again and again for the next few months.

Using the fresh peaches off my tree, 1 cup cream, 2 cups 1/2 & 1/2, 1 cup whole milk. It was excellent! We ate it before I could make the peaches to top it.

I added 1 tablespoon of coarsely chopped fresh ginger to the step with adding the peach pits & peels, then added another 1 tbsp pulverized candied ginger in the step when adding the peach puree. Yum! Great ginger-peach ice cream! Serve it with coconut tuiles.

Great flavor -- the vanilla bean is a nice touch -- but the texture didn't come out quite right (started turning into butter, leaving a nasty greasy feel in the mouth). I may have not cooled the mash enough, and perhaps it got overchurned as a result.

As my husband said when he tasted it, "It couldn't be better." We liked the fact that it wasn't vanilla ice cream with peaches in it, but had a real peach flavor throughout. The infusion of the skin and pits really brought out the peach essence.

I thought this recipe was good (my family loved it) however, it tasted a little "pasty" to me. I'm not sure if it was due to the corn syrup which I've never added to ice cream before. Also, make sure you use the sweetest peaches you can find. Mine were good - not great and I think that would make a big difference.

This ice cream is wonderful -- peachy, dreamy and perfect! And beautiful too! Instead of the sauce in the recipe, we just peeled, pitted and grilled some peaches, sprinkled them with a tiny bit of superfine sugar and spooned them over the ice cream. Nothing could have been better on a hot summer night!

Excellent! This is one of the best ice creams I've ever made.

the best peach ice cream i've ever had

I have been making this ice cream every summer since the recipe was published, I even bought a new ice cream maker just for it...it is excellent, if you use lemon juice to keep the peaches color overnight, keep in mind that it will make the ice cream sour, not bad...just different. I have also used mangoes instead of peaches.

Pretty good. Makes use of the abundance of peaches this time of year

We made this recipe with well-ripened nectarines. It turned out fabulous! I had heard from a local ice-cream maker that the corn syrup in ice cream helps to bring out a chewey texture. It sure worked. When we make this again, I will add just a tad more sugar.

This is the best Peach ice cream I have tasted. I made up the peach puree the night before and the lemon juice kept the color of the fruit perfectly.

Really excellent. For four eggs, had the quality and richness of ice creams with 8 or 10 eggs. We soaked the peaches in lemon juice overnight, and the effect was very sherbet-like in flavor.

This recipe is well worth the effort to make. I will definately make again. The ice cream alone is also very, very good!
