I found everything at Whole Foods. It was fun to try some new ingredients. I liked it a lot and would give it 3 forks but I gave it 4 because my 12 month old and 3 1/2 year old simply loved it. Granted, they aren't very picky, but still, I enjoyed watching them devour it. Now I need to find more recipes with these ingredients after spending a fortune since I could only buy big bags of arame, dulse flakes, and kombu.

I have been making this for years for myself and my cooking clients. I usually substitute shredded roasted chicken for the tofu. It's a favorite I keep coming back to.

My family loved this stew. I will add it to my top 10 rotation. Delicious, nutritious vegetarian meal that is perfect all on it's own or with a kale salad. I doubled the recipe so that everyone could take lunch to work the next day. I followed the recipe exactly as this was my first time making this meal. Someone mentioned they could not find Arame, Eden brand sells it at Whole Foods or on- line. You can find many ingredients that are not available at your local grocer on-line. I am a big fan of seaweed so any recipe that I can use seaweed is a keeper.

i very loosely followed this recipe: i soaked the arame in water and started making the quinoa. meanwhile i sauteed an onion in oil, then added garlic, sliced carrots and sliced white mushrooms. then i added sliced chicken breast instead of tofu and immediately poured in a combination of chicken stock and water (definitely used more broth than called for) and added a little soy sauce. when the chicken was almost done i took out some of the stock and mixed it with the miso and added it bit by bit to taste. i then added sugar snap peas, used pac choi instead of bok choy or cabbage, and rinsed and added the arame and quinoa. i didn't use the kombu or dulse, the extra miso and chicken stock made up for the missing flavors. it was very very good, fresh and clean tasting. i'd definitely make it again.

To khaskell from San Diego: I have never heard of arame or dulse flakes, and I lived in Japan. I don't know if dulse are similar to Bonito, but I like the suggestion of other reviewers to steep and strain Bonito as an addition. I suspect arame are like wakame. These are easy to find, and I always add them to my miso soups. Wakame are thin strips of seaweed. You reconstitute them in cold water, then add the strips and resulting "broth" to the soup before serving. I believe you use cold water so that they don't get bitter. I'm anxious to try this recipe.

Hello, I attempted to find the ingredients for this recipe at my local Japanese grocery store. Nobody knew what "arame" was and even the manager was called to help me. It was all a bit embarrasing.

I used this recipe as the basis of my stew, which turned out great. I left out the arame, kombu and dulse flakes, doubled just about everything else and added half a red bell pepper. I also used mini portobella mushrooms instead of shiitake and diced silken tofu in small cubes (in 12-ounce box) instead of firm tofu. Yum! Never would have occurred to me to add quinoa, which made this even more healthful.

I make this all the time. Easy, scrumptious and you feel virtous after.

This was a decent soup but not as flavorful as I had hoped. I will try again with the bonito flakes to see if this comes out better.

I did this recipe without the arame, tamari, or dulse flakes, and it was still fabulous. I did steep some bonito flakes in the soup, as previous reviewers did, and that was very good. I actually found the bonito flakes at a pet food store (cats like them too). Excellent stew for a cold day.

This is a absolutely delicious and a wonderfully nourishing meal. As suggested by "therooster from los gatos, ca", I simmering 1/2 cup of bonito flakes in the stew liquid (then strained these out) and used a dark barley miso to add richness.

apparently miso lasts almost forever if you keep it tightly wrapped in the fridge. it gets a little dry if you keep it a long time tho, and I don't know if it retains all its healthful properties

I'm posting this question in 3-4 different spots here on Epicurious hoping to find someone who knows. How long does Miso last (refrigerated, of course)

This has quickly become a staple for my wife and I. Easy and delicious.

I forgot to mention that I used reconstituted dried shiitake mushrooms in place of fresh, and I used the broth I cooked them in for the soup broth. Great addition.

This was really delicious. You do not need absolutely everything the recipe calls for (such as dulse flake). I had mostly everything and it came out superb. I also used a sweeter miso and it was fine. Warm and comforting for a cold winter night!

This is the first time I've cooked anything with these ingredients and I was surprised how easy it was to make and how delicious it was. Even my meat/potatoes loving husband went back for more. Would definately make this again exactly as it is.

Yum. Very healthy and delicious. I made the recipe with yellow miso, which I had on hand, and it was great. The varying textures and flavors are really interesting. Will definately make it again!

I love miso soup. When I'm sick I don't crave chicken noodle, I crave miso. This is a great way to turn miso soup into a meal and it's absolutely delicious. It's also really easy to make just like any miso soup is. MMMmmmm

This is an excellent variation for sprucing up miso soup. Before adding the miso, simmering 1/2 cup of bonito flakes in the stew liquid, and then straining it, adds a subtle richness. Also, by replacing the shiro soy miso with a dark barley or rice miso, you can use less of this more flavourful miso, cutting down on the salt intake and complementing this tofu dish with something other than another soy product. Also, dark miso is aged longer, adding medicinal qualities that aid in digestion and in alkalization of the blood.
