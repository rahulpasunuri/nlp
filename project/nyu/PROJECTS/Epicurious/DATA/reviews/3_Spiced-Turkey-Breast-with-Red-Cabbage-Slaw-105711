I used a whole turkey breast(with bone) and marinated overnight with triple the marinade. I cooked for 3 hours at 325 and it was incredibly moist and tasty. The slaw was a nice compliment. My kids loved the turkey, but not the slaw.

This recipe was just OK. Not as tasty as I would expect after marinating 24 hours. I used very little oil in the cabbage slaw - it doesn't need it (and neither do I!). I might try it with many more spices.

I just made the slaw.........but it was delicious! It's kind of like the German Rotkraut if you cook it all the way through. Would definately make it again.....it was so easy!

I followed the cooking instructions from the NC cook as I had a 4 1/2 lb. turkey breast to cook. It turned out just delicious, good and moist. I didn't have allspice, so I used equal parts of cinnamon, mace and ground clove. It smelled wonderful as it was roasting. I LOVE the slaw recipe, too.

This was very good but not 'a dish beyond compare.' (That IS what 4 forks is supposed to mean, folks!!) I grilled on my electric grill indoors, but even so evauluated for taste, not for 'ease of prep' give it A 3, not a 4. Definitly has potential ( turkey with allspice, who'da thunk it??) but needs the TINIEST bit of tweaking!!

I marinated a 4 1/2 pound turkey breast (doubled the marinade) for 4 hours in the fridge, then roasted the turkey with the marinade in the oven at 350 til it reached 170 (about 2 hours). It was amazingly moist & delicious - my husband raved about it! Loved the red cabbage as well - a great accompaniment.

Made this with Chicken instead of turket--delicious, especially the 2nd day! I should've made it further ahead of time. Very good though!
