I have never roasted a chicken before, and was short on time. My executive chef boyfriend seemed skeptical about my even attempting this, but I wanted to give him a night off, and I love to cook and try new things... So, I used this recipe as a basis; I rubbed the chicken with salt (I did NOT wait 24 hours) and butter, and proceeded with the roasting directions as set within. Another slight switch was that I added fresh garlic, rosemary and thyme to the butter that I basted the bird with throughout the roasting process. The outcome was superb, flavorful, juicy, and... perfect! My chef was freak-out impressed with every bite ;) You can see photos of the finished product on my Instagram @sarahgianetto =)

Truly amazing. I have made this recipe three times now, extremly juicy with crispy golden skin. A real classic that got great reviews with kids and adults alike. I prepare a white wine sauce with the pan drippings. The only variation I have applied is to extend the initial roasting time by 10 min or so.

I, too, don't understand the negative reviews. I'm an experienced cook and thought I knew how to make a great roast chicken...until I tried this. Moist and amazing. I think its key to start with an amazing bird though...not those skinny things from the supermarket...

I don't understand the negative reviews. I have tried for years to roast a good chicken and have found it very hard to do consistently. This version is extraordinary. And the leftovers are moist and equally good the next night--it does not dry out as so often happens. I found it an easy and fun dish to prep, the house smelled amazing while it cooked, and the taste was truly delicious.

I should have known better than to just rub salt on a chicken and leave it at that -- butter or no butter, tasted like wet chicken -- I normally make my own rub which I put under the skin -- Now I know better....

This was way too much work for a tasty outcome, too much butter and too much spatter in the oven. Just use a somewhat room temperature chicken with a little butter in the beginning and some fresh herbs, and bake for 50-55 min. at 425 and you will have a golden brown succulent chicken to remember.

I'm with @jkhandy on this one. The Thomas Keller method described in that post is the one I also use.

Mark Bittman's recipe for roast chicken is simpler and always delicious and perfect -- crispy brown skin and succulent meat. Oven 450. Place cast iron frying pan in oven 10 minutes, then add chicken, rubbed with butter or oil oil and salt and pepper, check at 40 minutes. Sometimes I leave it in another 10. Let sit 5 min or a while. Enjoy! A double yum.

I think a dry rub of rosemary would enhance the flavor. I cook this quit often with my counter top oven.

I made this just as the recipe was written soon after I received my magazine. I am sure that using a fresh Amish chicken helped, but OMG, this was absolutley delicious. Just be prepared for smoke. Keep an eye on that oven!

Why too much work here to roast a chicken. I've roasted several 4-5 pound chickens which always turn out with crispy skin and moist breast meat, and people love it. Simply bring the bird up to room temperature, preheat oven to 450, truss bird with twine, sprinkle liberally with kosher salt and place into the oven. 45-55 mins later its done. Use fresh thyme along with the salt if you wish, or any other fresh herbs. Simple.
