This is really good. I put in a little red pepper flake and some onions too, and followed the recommendations of the other commentators to put in the cabbage and the onions first before putting in the ginger/garlic/pepper. Super easy (except for shelling the chestnuts), and downright delicious.

This recipe is entirely too bland. I would add 2-3 times the amount of garlic and ginger, double the soy sauce, add the same amount of hot sesame oil to the amt specified for sesame oil and. Still it needs help. Add a cup of onions, scallions or a mixture of both, and add a final touch of toasted sesame seeds.

Yes, I burned the first batch of ginger & garlic. Next time will try changing the order. I liked the dish, especially the crunchy texture of the cabbage, but next time I would use more garlic and ginger -- it wasn't as vividly flavored as I had expected. Also, I halved the recipe, which should have made enough for 3-4 servings, but the quantity certainly wouldn't have stretched to 4.

I couldn't find any jarred chestnuts in the supermarket so I tried the ones in the shell, boiled and peeled. The chestnuts gave a nice buttery flavour which compliments the cabbage. Overall a good side dish, in small quantities.

I heated the peanut oil then added the cabbage. Stirred for a minute then added garlic, ginger, salt, sugar, soy and sesame oil. Cooked for another minute then added lightly salted cocktail peanuts (instead of chestnuts). Serve immediately. I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I got many requests for the recipe.

I cook a lot of asian food..especially veggies.this is my comment on theis recipe..1st) I wouldnt cook my garlic in smoking oil cause burning garlic would render it bitter.. 2nd) I would also add onions sliced not too thin..the rest seems ok..I usually cook the vegies and then add my onions,garlic, and ginger when it has just started to cook..
