I love skirt steak and cooking with red wine but this recipe was a disaster in my opinion. It was like pouring red wine over the steak. It wasn't inedible but I would have been mortified if I served this to a group without having tried it beforehand. I won't make it again and can't recommend it.

BBQ'd the steak. Made the sauce as noted, but did not have the fat drippings to add to the sauce. It still turned out amazing. I did substitute white sugar for brown & added a bit more worcestshire. Definitely will make again. Superb!

Very tasty... got good reaction here. Didn't have bay leaf, and cooked steak a little longer than recommended for medium doneness.

Really good way to cook skrit steak - turned out perfectly tender, but not chewy. I too added shallot & garlic paste to the sauce prior to adding the wine thyme etc - turned out great!

Tented steak with foil to keep warm after removing steak from skillet. Sauteed 2 cloves of minced garlic and a minced shallot in drippings, then followed the rest of the recipe. Such a simple, but very tasty sauce. My family loved it, and I loved such a tasty, easy weeknight main dish.

I made this dish twice. The first time I follow the recipe, the second time I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, some cream, and then gorgonzola cheese. Lots more calories, but yummy.

Great weeknight recipe. Other than the steak, the ingredients are always on hand. My kids love it too.

This was great! Super simple to prepare and cook. The equivilent of a steak meal in a restaurant!. I served it with the cabbage in horseradish and mustard sauce. Sublime!

Simple, delicious and very gormet! I prepared it by following the recipe exactly, and served the skirt steak on a bed of carmelized onions... FABULOUS!!!

This was a nice new variation for red meat, I really liked it. The only thing I did differently was to cut way back on the butter, I probably only used 1/2 tbsp. Yum! I will definitely make it again.

I think this is a nice idea for weeknight steak dinners, fast and easy with enjoyable results. Next time I'll probably thicken the sauce to make it more gravy-like. Flavors in sauce were great together. I used dried thyme and it was fine.

Have used this recipe for both ribeye and filet mignon with excellent results. It is, after all, the sauce that makes it different from hundreds of other sauteed steak recipes. Double the sauce if you like to dip lots of bread in it.

This was great...just make sure pan is hot enough...cooking time was no problem. They do become tough fast if overcooked. Cooked as instructed meat was perfect!

Good sauce, nice flavor. The cooking time was nowhere near adequate; the steaks were raw after 7 minutes. I had to take the steaks off everyone's plate and roast in the oven for about 5 minutes at 375 just to achieve rare. And the skirt steak is not the most tender of cuts. I think I might do this again with a more tender cut and longer cooking time.
