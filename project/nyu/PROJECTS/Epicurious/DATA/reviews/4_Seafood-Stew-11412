First a confession. Instead of lovely fresh seafood, I had a bag of frozen mixed seafood from Costco. It had mussels, calamari, shrimp, and scallops. That said, this was terrific! I separated the mussels from the rest of the seafood and treated everything else as the recipe says to treat the shrimp. Since I had so much seafood, I increased the garlic & herbs and the amount of broth I used. I used the requested one bottle of clam juice and then took the suggestion of vegetable broth, only I used chicken broth (it's what I had). It all worked so well. There was even a little left over, which I am enjoying now.

Great Stuff! I used gluten-free flour (Pamela's Baking Mix) and 15 shrimp (you could even add more), made my own Italian seasoning (just look it up) and substituted clams for mussels (I much prefer mussels). This was a fantastic meal. Will make it again.

This was great. I increased recipe and made a few changes. Used 1 lb shrimp and 1 lb cod (no mussels), 1 yellow pepper, 1 cup of vermouth, 1 quart of fish stock instead of clam juice. Used oregano & herbes de provence instead of Italian seasoning. Doubled other ingredients. Put toasted baguette slices with butter and rubbed with garlic in bottom of bowl before ladling in the stew. It made 6 good sized servings.

This is very good and very easy. You can prep the veggies & garlic, and seafood in advance then, throw it together when you are ready to eat. Easy weeknight meal with lots of flavors

Yum scrum....I had some cod and mussels kicking around and decided to whip this up. No need for clam broth, just tossed in some vegetable stock. As for the Italian herbs - dried rosemary and thyme were all I had on hand as well as the red pepper flakes. We loved it. Next time will serve with linguine and bread.

We were looking for something to do with a pound of haddock and another of sea scallops I'd bought on sale, and were thrilled to come up with this recipe. So simple and good, I don't know how I'd missed it before. We doubled it and tripled the herbs - - dried oregano and basil. Next time I'll serve with crusty bread.

This was very good. I didn't add mussels but added bay scallops instead. I also doubled everything (except the yellow pepper) to serve 4 generous servings. No need to cut up the cod into chunks...just add the whole filet and it can be easily broken up into chunks when it cooks. I also added a little Pernod at the end.

what a versatile and delicious recipe! after reading other reviews, i sauteed garlic and hot pepper at the beginning with two peppers (one yellow and one red), used a little extra olive oil to marinate the fish, and squeezed in lemon at the end. Served it over rice, but it would almost be better with crusty bread or thin spaghetti.

Whooo-boy, is this good! I did add fresh tyme, too, because I have so much in the garden, red pepper instead of yellow, ditto. Pretty dish too.

We loved this stew! I made the recipe exactly as given, and it was fabulous. I'll definitely be making this one again.

Really delicious and easy, but could use a bit more flavour enhancement. I might try adding the red pepper flakes a bit earlier as per another cook's comments, or maybe a shot of lemon juice at the end would add to the flavour. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe, only made a couple of changes added sea scallops and used Chunky crushed tomato, also added a small amount of white rice. Served with a simple salad and crusty bread my husband thought it was a special occasion.

I've rated this before, but after making it tonight for about the fifth or sixth time, I decided it needed to be upgraded to four forks. It's so versatile -- whatever fish is in season and looks freshest can be used. I've made with and without fresh crabmeat, and I definitely think crab meat adds a pleasing dimension to the recipe. I've started adding the red pepper flakes with the onion and bell pepper, as the oil releases the flavor of the peppers. I also simmer a bit longer before adding the fish so it's a thicker consistency. Really a restaurant-quality meal -- don't forget the best sourdough bread you can find, along with the best sauvignon blanc you can afford. You won't be sorry.

My husband and I loved this stew. Omitted onion (b/c of allergy) I doubled the garlic. Next time I won't cook the cod and shrimp for the same amt of time. I'll add cod cook for 3 minutes and then add the shrimp, our shirmp was a little over cooked. Serve with crusty french bread. The dish is impressive for how quick and easy it is. We will definately make again.

I doubled the recipe and found it to more of a soup than a stew. I followed advice of others and used cajun seasoning. The flavor is delicious. My only complaint is it is too soupy.

Rating: 3
This was amazingly good, quick and easy!! However, I did add more crushed red pepper and minced garlic just before serving to liven up the flavor. Several of my guests asked for this recipe.

This recipe is a wonderful jumping off point for variations. Decided to make it on the spur of the moment, so used ingredients on hand...frozen basa fillets, scallops & prawns, & canned baby clams. Followed the base as per the recipe, with the exception of using a full cup of white wine, & a mixture of herbs to make up the Italian Seasoning. Served garlic bread along side, & stirred a dollop of garlic butter into the stew before serving...added a nice mellowness to the dish!

I really didn't change anything about this recipe. My kids loved tapping on the mussels to make sure they were alive and that made it all the more fun for them to eat them when the dish was ready. I served this over rice, but think I will make angel hair pasta (from scratch, of course!) for the leftovers tonight. Even my seafood-hating husband loved this dish and ate every bite. Simple flavors that marry well with the seafood and bring out their natural flavors.

I have made this several times and even my 3 kids loved it. Instead of Mussels the clams (because of kids) is what we used and I used a whole cup of white wine - let it simmer down a few minutes before putting in 1 lb. shrimp - Awesome & Quick.

Delish!!! I added fresh crab but otherwise made the recipe as published. Wonderful depth of flavors, everything melded together wonderfully. Very easy to make and better than most restaurant ciopinos (sp?) that I've had -- and in the SF Bay Area, that's really saying something!

We loved this recipe. I also experimented and added clams and additional shrimp, etc. It is now our favorite dish!

I've made this recipe with my own variations several times and it is always outstanding. I cut the cod into larger pieces as I find 3/4" gets small when cooked and lost in the stew. I like larger shrimp (16-20 count per pound) as I find they don't get lost in the stew and have a wonderful texture. I add 30 fresh clams and 30 fresh mussles during the last five minutes of cooking. During the last two minutes of cooking I add a package of fresh Dungeness crab claws cut at the joints. I prefer the peppers cut into a larger dice than strips and I used red and yellow peppers which added a nice texture to the seafood. I served it with Italian and whole wheat breads to soak up the broth along with a green salad. I doubled the recipe which easily feeds 6 big eaters (with my additions). Sometimes, I avoid oil entirely and use seafood broth for sauting the veggies. Trader Joe's sells a carboard canister of seafood broth that works really well. The stew is wonderful the next day.

As other reviewers noted, the dish seemed to be "missing something" when I served it fresh (added a bag of mixed shellfish I had on hand, snapper instead of cod, lots of clams instead of mussels, and doubled recipe, served over brown rice). Wasn't sure what. It was wonderful, however, as leftovers. The flavors seemed to meld and the seafood taste was bold. Next time I would saute more fresh garlic with the initial ingredients, besides what marinates with the seafood.

An easy, delicious and impressive dish. I chopped up half a fennel together with the onion and added a splash of Grand Marnier and grated lemon peel to the stew for an extra kick. A real winner!

very good, easy and quick. But why make life harder on your self? Use one pot, saute garlic with onions, then add shrip and mussles at the very end. Also - I added the cod whole - it broke up nicely.

Rating: 4
I doubled or tripled most of the sauce ingredients and used 2 lbs butterflied prawns, 1/2 lb quartered sea scallops, 2 dozen mussels and 1/2 lb cracked crab claws. I also added more hot peppers and about 1/4 cup Pernod. It was killer, and I was very proud of myself. I served it with spaghetti or rice, garlic cheese biscuits and a caesar salad. 2 thumbs way up!!!

I love this stew! I made it during the week after work (after hitting the grocery story -- very quick and easy). I had it for dinner, AND I brought it into work for lunch the next two days. I couldn't get enough of it. My husband, on the other hand, isn't a fan of fish with a tomato-based sauce, so he passed on dinner. Well, Honey, next time fix your own bowl! Hands off mine!!! :) The only changes I made was to substitute canned chopped clams for the mussels. Plus, I added sea scallops. It was maw-velous!!

I used this recipe with about 2 c. of left over steamed mussels. It worked very well without the shrimp and cod although I would happily try it again with the recommended fish/shellfish. It was hearty and heated up well for a second day.

Wonderful! I substituted clams for the mussels, added 1/2 lbs. of bay scallops, and used only a small onion, but added a small fennel bulb. It was enough for four. My wife wants me to make it again when she hosts her ladies group.

Decided to make this when hwe heard about the approaching snowstorm. I'd never made a seafood stew before, but always wanted to. My husand was skeptical and was worried it would taste too "tomatoee"This went over big and we are having leftover stew tonight. We tripled the batch except only put in 2 tblsp tomato paste and only added 1 can of tomatoes. Put in Creole spices (didn't have cajun)and added some Orange Roughy with the Cod. Threw some white wine into the stew as well the wine from the steamed mussells and added sea scallops. Some great advice from other reviewers. Thanks!

Wow, this is good. I left out the mussels and spiced it up a little bit with some chili paste. I used the whole can of tomatoe paste, figuring the leftover would stink up the refriderator. The whole thing took less than an hour and was worth it for sure.

It's good, but you have to use homemade fish stock instead of the clam broth.

Rating: 2
This was an easy recipe to prepare. It seems like a great summer seafood blend with a potential for taste. We served it over white rice, Louisiana-style. My wife and I shared this over a bottle of white wine. Our general impression was that it was somewhat mild and lacking in flavor. Maybe the tomato was a bit too strong or maybe it just needed smoe more flavor/spice. We'll probably adjust the recipe if we make this again.

I like to cook! I didn't have any mussels, but I had half a pound of fish medley and a litle more than a cup of small cooked shrimp, so I tried this recipie. I t added the entire can of tomato paste and a cup of cooked rice. It was delicious! My hubby loved it; he had three helpings and asked if I would be sure to fix it again. I used a green pepper instead of a yellow one, and added some of it to a cole slaw, along with fresh green beans and french bread, we had a fantastic meal. This dish tastes like it came right out of a fancy New Orleans restaurant!

This is our family's favorite recipe! It is spicy, rich and versatile --- you can add whatever your favorite seafood is. We add oysters and clams sometimes, whatever looks fresh at the market that day. DELICIOUS!

Scrumptious, quick and easy, this makes a special meal with little effort. I did follow previous suggestions, such as adding 3 cups clam juice, some scallops and jalapeno pepper (I also used "fresh" scrod instead of frozen cod.) The result was so delicious! It made enough for three people plus some left over for lunch the next day. A great weekend supper but with weekday effort.

This was delicious but needed some help. I made a shrimp stock by toasting the shells in a little olive oil until real fragrant, then added a little white wine and water then straining. Also used 3 bottles of clam juice. Seasoning needed help so I added aromat (salt type seasoning) little Joe's cajun spice and alot of cayenne pepper. added cod,shrimp, scallops & mussels. We served over rice and it was real good, but better the next day. Will make again.

I followed this recipe as written with the exception of adding a tad more Italian seasoning (Emeril's)and found it to be very tasty. It could probably feed 3 instead of 2. We added cornbread muffins, green salad and a nice bottle of Beringer's chardonnay for an "at home" rainy, Saturday night. Very enjoyable and I will make it again.

I made this last night, added scallops and used clams instead of mussels, increased the clam broth to 2 cups, and used 5 Tbsp of tomato paste--all as suggested by other reviewers. It was wonderful!! Definitely a keeper and will become one of my "guest" recipes.

Rating: 4
Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added extra clam juice and bay scallops but next time I won't forget to add a jalapeno. I used red snapper rather than cod. Can't wait for the price of crab to come down so I can include some of our San Francisco dungeness the next time I make this. Four of the mussels I bought were defective so if you're planning on a certain number per serving, remember to buy a few extra.

In response to missyB, I've found that any recipe "needing something" can usually handle a light sprinkling of cajun seasoning, testing to see when you have it "right". Works well with fish dishes as well as soups and stews. Yes, I added some cajun seasoning and loved it!

This was an outstanding base. I doubled the recipe, but tripled the clam juice. Also added one diced jalapeno pepper, crab legs and mussels. This was outstanding. I think that you could get away with using the whole can of tomato paste as opposed to the one tablespoon.

If you let this sit overnight, I'm sure the flavors will gell and become more complex. Serving it directly after cooking leaves it needing "something," as my husband says. It is not bad, by any means, but it does leave something to be desired.

This was an outstanding success. My wife and I will be widely recommending this recipe to friends. I added bay scallops and was delighted with the dish:easy, aromatic, delicious.

We loved this recipe and it is relatively easy. I will be careful next time not to stir the stew much after adding the mussels (I also added clams) because it breaks up the cod too much. I doubled the recipe and I think it will be even better tomorrow. Be sure to have some fresh bread on hand. This recipe is a keeper.
