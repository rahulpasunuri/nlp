Crepe consistency comes out very well (I took the advice to add cooked rice). I also added 1/2 tsp of cumin seeds to the batter after fermentation and it adds good flavor. Cumin in the potatoes should also be increased for more kick. Final advice: serve dosas with the seam side down, so the crepe does not get soggy!

Making excellent Dosa comes with years of experience. It is a fine art perfected over years of practice. Of watching and eating and doing. Be patient. I am a novice but I have eaten lots of great dosa and this recipe works for me. Its not perfect. But this video from you tube gives you some of the finer points: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIsQDHcHWbo --- (search "dosa recipe" on You Tube). Also the charming comments about adding boiled rice and not mixing the rice with the lentils works for me. I love this recipe and the comments and the recipe has changed my life. Because now I can make dosa! I have used this recipe about three times already and I often use the whole lentil (with the black skin and all). Making dosa tomorrow and the rice and lentils are soaking. I always add about a teaspoon or two of fenugreek with the rice in the soak. Peace.

I make a lot of Indian food. I thought this dish was simply the best food I have made or eaten all year. The only thing I can see that I might have done differently than other people is I may have put more water in the crepe batter before I cooked it. I would give this 4 + stars. I made this dish a few months ago but do not remember if it was a crepe consistency but I believe it was a pancake type consistency. I served it with a mango pickle and a cilantro garlic oil.

This is a classic Indian dish. For grinding the dal and rice I use an Indian style grinder which does a much better job than the food procesor. I put in dried red chiles and the spice mixture called panch phoron which give the potatoes more flavor and kick. This recipe seems to have been toned down spice-wise. A small amount of lemon juice stirred into the potatoes helps to balance the flavor too. Sucess with this dish depends upon using fresh spices.

I actually followed the directions quite carefully with this one. Unfortunately the result was a less than flavourful glob of potato mash wrapped with pieces of a rice-lentil crepe, which stuck like crazy to the pan. Not worth the trouble.

Add 1 or two tablespoon of cooked rice to the rice when blending to get a good coneistency. Also do not mix the rice and lentil after blending , just pour it over one another and let it ferment. I have not tried the receipe but I know what I am saying.

Without a tablespoon of cooked rice added to the rice when belnding will affect the consistency of the dosa. One more after blending the lentil and rice separately dont not mis them together when fementing for 24hrs.
