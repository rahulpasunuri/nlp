Understanding that it was the vapor from the rum that made the flame, we were quick to light it after pouring the rum on. However, it barely flamed. We omitted the banana liqueur as the reviewers suggested, but maybe the liqueur helps the flame??

Quick, easy, and tasty. Took it a step further. Used dark spiced rum "Kilo Kai" and a little coconut rum too. Yummy. Don't judge me regarding more rum, it all burns off. Bananas came out a bit mushier than I liked, will try to use greener bananas to get better caramelization next time.

Super simple and tasty! I recommend making the plating of the ice cream part of the mise en place so that the final assembly is faster.

This is traditional Christmas eve fare in our family. The kids think it daring to have a little rum. I add just a little extra rum flavoring instead of banana liqueur. Dark rum is best.

It is not a wonderful recipe for me, but not a bad one either. I think that serving it with ice cream is a prerequisite. However, it is very easy to make and quick also.

We combined this recipe with another and used 2/3 cup brown sugar and 4 ounces of dark rum. Left the rest the same and it came out perfectly!

This is one of my favorite quick easy deserts. I have gotten rave reviews even from very sophisticated diners. I do not use the banana liquor as I feel it overpowers the dish,

For those who could not get the liquor to flambé, here's a little hint-it's the vapor that ignites, not the liquid. Let the mixture boil a little, then ignite. Remember, more vapor, bigger flame.

Good recipe. Flavors were really nice - the lemon and cinnamon play well off of one another. I omitted the banana liqueur. I could not get it to flambe for some reason. I just cooked it over heat a little longer to burn off the alcohol taste. Confused why it would not ignite.

I, too, could only find "99 Bananas" and who knows what I'm going to do with a huge bottle of banana liqueur. It tasted good, except I couldn't get all the alcohol to burn off. I think this needs a huge pan to spread out so that the flame can work it's magic. Before adding the alcohol it tasted delightful.

Very good, although a bit too much alcohol. Could be due to the only banana liquor in our neighborhood store being "99 bananas" (aka 99 proof banana liqueur). Next time, will probably decrease liquor a bit.
