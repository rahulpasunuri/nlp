This was really great - very lightly sweet and delicate. I was looking for a good way to use the lemon thyme from my garden and this was it. I'm not sure that I reduced the sauce long enough as it was very thin...next time I'll let it go a little longer. I'm saving the extra to stir in with fruit salad.

I made this for a Mothers Day brunch. I couldn't find a decent honeydew, or lemon thyme, so I used various berries, and regular thyme and lemon zest. It was delicious!! My guests all but licked the platter clean!

WOW! that is the only word for it! this was a great way to use melons and lemons, even my kids enjoyed it! a real party treat! the syrup was unbelieveable...but i have to admit, i did use a little extra sugar, as we all have a sweet tooth!
