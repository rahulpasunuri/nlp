An excellent rendition of mashed potatoes. The cilantro was especially nice. I used a combination of red, sweet and russet potatoes, which worked beautifully. However, I felt like that final OOMPH was missing from the dish. Next time I may add more salt or try whipping cream instead of half and half.

So yummy! I used a combination of poblanos and red bells. The color was as fantastic as the flavor. Next time I will make triple the pepper puree and freeze it for future use. I'm always on the lookout for a new twist on mashed potatoes as it has been one of my favorites since childhood. I must say that this twist shouts!

I used canned poblano chilies, fat free half and half, and reduced-fat butter. It was good.

This recipe confirms the idea that mashed potatoes are always a favorite. Definitely use a mix of sweet, red skin, and russett potatoes. I left the red skins on to add color as well. YUM.

Try using a mix of sweet, red skin, and russett potatoes; if you leave the skins on (at least the red ones), you will end up with a beautiful cantaloupe-colored side dish, accented lots of with red and green (from the peppers and cilantro). Looked so pretty (and tasted so good) next to "Seared Salmon with Tomatillo Coulis" (also on Epicurious).

excellent! the cream adds a wonderful "rich" texture...we've made these several times, and they're always a hit!

I made this last night on accident. It was fabulous. I did add some smoked Mozzerella chunks to it, that was a tasty addition. I left the chunks to melt whole, so every now and then you would bite into a glob of super-yummy cheese. Next time I'll refer to the recipe and see if it comes out as wonderful.

These mashed potatoes are yummy! The leftovers make great burritos with some Mexican cheese.
