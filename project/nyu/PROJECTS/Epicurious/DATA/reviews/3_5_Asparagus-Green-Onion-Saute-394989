We made as a side extra vegetables. Did not include the string beans. Will use beans next time but this was great without the beans.

I was looking for something different to do with my asparagus other than steam it. I found this and gave it a try. I think this is a fabulous start (which is why I gave 3 forks instead of 4) but lacked flavor the first time following the directions. The second time I made it, I cut both the asparagus and beans into 2-3" lengths then added about a dozen brussel sprouts. To cook them, I put them in my perfect steamer which also held them at a good temp until the scallions were done. Then, I sliced up some shiitake mushrooms and sautéed them with the scallions. When I added the veggies, the variety was very appealing and the little color from the mushrooms was nice too. I also added one table spoon of good virgin olive oil I usually use for bread appetizers while I mixed it all together. When the oil was paired with the mushrooms, it really added a lot of flavor that complimented everything. I think the only thing I will change next time is to add just a touch of fresh baked bacon in tiny strips! Now I have a pretty simple dish full of veggies that the entire crew loves! =)
