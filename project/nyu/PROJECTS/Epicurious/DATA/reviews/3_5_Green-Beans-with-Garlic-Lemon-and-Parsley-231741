Delicious and fresh! I halved the fat and thought they were still fantastic.

This recipe is so easy to make! I had bought a bunch of green beans from the farmers market. About 2lbs. I had no idea what to do with them and had bought them because they were so cheap! This took practically no time and tasted good the next day. It is so flavorful with the garlic and lemon!

surprisingly delicious!so refreshing and pretty. my guests loved it. i used wax beans as they were fresher than green in my market. i did add a squeeze of the lemon juice as well as the zest. i minced the parsley finely and probably added a bit more of the garlic. try it you'll be glad as it is so easy and so good.

Simple recipe, nothing to get in the way of fresh green beans. Most importantly, all the steps were quick. I was able to prepare early in afternoon while Turkey was in oven, then quickly sauteed the pieces before carving the bird.

This was light, refreshing, and so so good! The parsley looked like a lot but once it wilted, it took on a texture like finely grated parmesan. The garlic, parsley, and lemon combined perfectly. I was not sure how my 15 month old would like them, but she preferred these to her stuffed shells!!!

I can see myself making this one A LOT. Upped the garlic and paired with Porcini-Crusted Filet Mignon with Herb Butter (also found on this site). Excellent and easy!

We make this recipe all of the time, we've even reviewed it in the past. However, I didn't have any green beans, but I had broccoli, I steamed broccoli florets and the stem cut into medium size pieces (tough skin peeled). Then followed the instructions with olive oil, butter, garlic, used four cloves and the lemon zest. This would be wonderful with not only broccoli but cauliflower as well. Simple, versatile flavors with various veggies, great leftover as well. Love this recipe!

Very yummy. Very easy and could be done for a fancy party and no one would know. I used olive oil spray instead of the oil and it was still great.

This is a keeper, I make this all the time. What's really great is that the beans can be cooked/cooled early and all the prep work done well ahead of time, which is great for company. Like other reviewers, a lot of garlic is a must!

This recipe is fantastic! I used the lemon zest and juice, about three times the garlic, and topped the finished dish with crumbled sliced almonds. Everyone loved it. I plan to make this frequently.

This is a great way to prepare fresh green beans. I've made it 3 times in the past month. I successfully used lemon juice in place of the zest. The recommended amount of garlic is good, but I added a lot more and the beans were even better.

Used 1/2 the amounts of butter and olive oil, and the dish was still rich. I may have had less that 1.5 lbs, though -- didn't weigh the beans.

Very easy to make. The lemon provides a unique taste. Would make this again if I needed to fix a quick vegetable dish.

I was very pleased with these beans. It is very lemony, so beware if you are very sensitive. Also, when stirring in the garlic, do not have the heat up too high, you will burn the garlic right up.

the first time I made the recipe, I added the juice of 1/2 meyer lemon- it was perfect. The second time, I added the juice of the entire meyer lemon and it was too tangy for my husband.

Double the lemon zest, squeeze some lemon juice on toward the end, and add slivered almonds. Yum! (I didn't do parsley, as I didn't have any.) I made this with pork chops (baked 10-15 minutes at 350 w/rosemary, sage and thyme) stewed apples (just apples, a little water, and cinnamon) and simple mashed potatoes (yukon gold, skins on, add butter and cream, salt and pepper while mashing). Was a delightful, light and easy meal.

Excellent side dish. I used some savory while cooking the beans which adds a wonderful flavor to beans.

Good. Not spectacular, but good. Definitely add more lemon zest, as suggested by previous reviewers.

I took several of the suggestions below - more zest, less butter/oil and adding a squeeze of lemon juice - and the beans were great.

Good, pretty looking and very light tasting. I would use half the oil/butter next time.

Simple and fresh! Perfect for garden fresh green beans - I will add more zest next time.

Very tasty. A sqeezed a little lemon juice on the green beans toward the beginning of the saute. Simple and fresh tasting.

This is a family favorite! It reminds us of the garlic green beans we enjoy at Buca di Beppo. I always prepare exactly as written. Enjoy!

I would definately make this again. It was light and delicious. Not a heavy green bean recipe. Perfect for a lighter fare for a big holiday dinner.

Something is wrong with the tally on the website...I indicated that I would NOT make this again in my previous review. Initially the %age reflected that. THEN it moved it back to 100% would make this again--definitely not!

This was oaky...nothing to write home about. The method was very good--blanching the beans and then sauteeing, but I'll use a different mix to saute and season--this just wasn't special.

This was great. A little oily for my tast--I'll use less oil or butter next time, but will definitely make it again.

This was a great side to the Chicken Marsala recipe. I've made it twice. Very quick and easy. Since you reheat the beans with the other ingredients, you can make the beans ahead of time. I used extra garlic too! My guests loved it.

Made this tonight for friends and it was a hit! It was easy to make. I used frozen green beans. This is a keeper especially since I always have the ingredients.

Refreshing, delicious, light. The leftovers were excellent on a tossed salad with sherry vinaigrette.

Great! I used canned french style green beans. Added an extra clove of garlic, a tablespoon of lemon juice along with the zest, and crushed almonds. All loved it.

Delicious! I prefer to use extra garlic and slice it thinly instead of mincing it. Also added slivered almonds.
