It's so simple that you'll be tempted to add in more ingredients thinking that it'll enhance the flavour. Don't do it. Although I must admit I did add in some celery that was almost wilting in the fridge, and used veg stock cube instead. To save on time, I also cheated by microwaving the potatoes. However, in a span of 20 mins, a delicious soup was born!

I can't believe how few ingredients can come up wiht such a yummy soup. I prob added a touch more potatoes (bc i had to use the small ones) and i used slightly less broth bc i like thick soups (4 cups instead of 4.5). I actually used less thinking i could add cream if i needed to at the end but i just used salt and pepper instead. yum!

I rated this 4 forks for it's simplicity, and flavor, but I changed it quite a bit, out of necessity. I found myself with three beautiful leeks and three russet potatoes, but NO chicken broth. I punted, and used 2 cups of 1% milk with about 1-1.5 cups of water, adding water, with a bit of salt, and tasting until it was a flavor I liked, but not too milky. I started with about 4 cups of whites from the leeks, which I sauteed in 1 tbsp of butter and 1 tbsp of olive oil. I sauteed about 15-20 minutes, to reduce the leeks and concentrate the flavor. Meanwhile I boiled the 1" cubes of peeled potatoes about 18 minutes, until tender. Then I sauteed the potatoes with the leeks about 5 minutes. Then I took some of the warmed milk "broth" and added it along with some potato/leek mix, and blended. My consistency was fairly thick,by design. I baked slices of french bread in an oven heated to 350, then turned off, with the slices in it...no chance of over baking, but nice and crunchy 20 minutes later.I cooked some very lean bacon which I chopped and added once the soup was plated, so that vegetarians could enjoy the soup without a problem. I did add 1 tablespoon of butter after it was warmed up, for a bit more flavor. It's a 45 minute deelicious recipe.

This has become our household favourite I make it as the recipe reads sometimes changing the broth to a vegetable broth (I usually make my own broths) I don't puree it as my husband likes it with texture but it always has such a delicate flavour and so buttery. I try to use organic leeks and potatoes

As tempted as I was to add cream and more veg, and tinker with seasonings, I didn't. I'm so happy with that call. The soup is delicate and delicious. the only changes I made were to halve the recipe (2 leeks, 2 c. broth) and use a couple little white potatoes instead of russet. I used a stick blender in the pot and it smoothed right out. Like another reviewer, I also didn't need extra salt. I think simplicity is the whole point; if you want something chunky or creamy or really hearty and filling, make it. Just don't doctor up this recipe and call it the same thing. Lovely.

I have made several different leek and potato soup recipes and this was the best. Usually I throw in extras (celery, onion, carrot) but this time after reading the review about the simplicity I decided to keep it simple. I did use vegetable bouillon rather than chicken broth, and I didn't have russet potatoes so I used 5 small red potatoes. My leeks browned a little bit but that didn't seem to matter; the potatoes started sticking to the bottom of my pan so I added a tablespoon or so of olive oil. probably if I did it in a nonstick pan it wouldn't have needed that. Used a blender rather than a food processor (to blend while hot: fill only 1/3 full, take out the middle plastic piece in the lid & cover lightly with a paper towel to stop splatter. this prevents explosions :) The flavor is AMAZING. better than other recipes that call for cream. I didn't even add salt, though I think my bouillon was pretty salty. From now on I am a leek purist, no more onions and carrots.

A good soup base but needs some additional flavors to make it really great.

Variations of this soup can be found in country kitchens all over Europe, but it is most commonly classed as a French soup. Like all French cuisine, the simple list of ingredients IS deceptive. The taste comes from two things: 1) High quality, freshly picked (local) produce, and 2) a subtle cooking technique that many ppl have never learned to do well. Sweating veg can be merely cooking them, but a cook who is good at it can coax out a subtle and lovely sweetness. Not to say that adding other flavours is any less of a skill, it is just different. I admit to doing it all the time. I'm just saying that this particular recipe is meant to showcase very simple, subtle flavours, lovingly transformed by careful cooking into something delicately delicious. (smiles) When I was at cooking school, we had to evaluate each other's food at lunch. We all started with the same recipe & the same ingredients, but the truly GREAT soups came from those who had mastered the art of sweating vegetables. It was if they were not even using the same recipe. They gave the natural sugars in the veg time to change, ever so slowly, into something almost magical. That simple technique makes or breaks this recipe, too. The moral of the story is that this will taste dramatically different depending on the style of the cook and the quality of the veg. I'm not sure it would work at all with the kind of tasteless produce so often seen in larger food stores. Fresh, local produce that still tastes like real food will shine in this recipe. (Loves her CSA!) I removed a fork bcs a recipe that relies so heavily on these kinds of factors should say so.

I had a ton of leftover russet potatoes, so wanted to make a double batch. I only had 2 leeks, so made up the difference with the misc onions, shallots, celery that were in the veg drawer. I followed suggestions of adding salt during sweat, 2 cloves of garlic, herbs de provence and thyme. I also only had veg broth. Plenty of flavor for me!

Made according to recipe, but using white potatoes instead of russet--all I could find at the farmer's market--and salted the leeks as they cooked. Delicious! My guests had second helpings. Can't imagine skimping on the butter.

I had the benefit of reading some reviews before making this soup, so I modified the recipe slightly (hence the 3 fork rating). I simmered 6 cups of chicken stock with a ham bone (leftover from Christmas dinner), until it reduced to 4.5 cups. I proceeded with the recipe as instructed, simply adding some of the ham pieces at the very end. The end result was FANTASTIC! Both texture and flavor were on-point.

Rating: 4
This soup is fantastic! The texture is nice and creamy and the flavor is wonderful! The adjustments that I made: Used olive oil instead of butter, added another leek and also added a turkey polish kielbasa sausage along with the broth (I took the sausage out before blending and saved it for another day - I only wanted the flavor). My husband and children loved it! Will definitely make it again!

I have made this recipe many times now and all to rave reviews. The first time I made it with veggie stock for the benefit of a vegetarian dinner guest, and after making it both ways, I actually like it much better with the veggie stock. Chicken stock over powers the leeks. It can be bland, so consider the tips of others to jazz it up, but it is creamy and comforting without the heaviness of a cream soup.

Lovely texture. I thought it was a little bland. I think I will try a little garlic next time and one more leek.

The recipe looked a little bland, so I was surprised by all the rave reviews about how good this soup tasted. I decided to give a try, but I made several additions. I should have trusted my instincts...the soup still lacked flavor and reminded me of kindergarden paste. My boyfriend really liked it, which doesn't say much; but he's usually the one who likes spicy and more flavorful foods. This is what I changed: - Sprinkled a generous amount of kosher salt on the leeks as they were cooking. -Used 2 Trader Joe mesh bags of the little finger white potatoes instead of 2 russets. I cut them into 1/4's and left the skins on. -added 1 Tbs of roasted, minced garlic to leek-potato mixture. -Used chicken stock,vegetable stock and some heavy whipping cream instead of all chicken stock. -added white pepper, freshly ground black pepper, garlic powder, freshly chopped dill, and dried Italian parsley flakes to simmering broth. All that and it still had no Umph! -

Made as written, with the exception of a roughly chopped clove of garlic added two or three minutes before adding the stock. Fabulous!

This soup is a great fall warmer-upper. I had 4 leeks so used them all and added 2 cloves of garlic. I also used 4 small red potatoes and 4 small yukon gold plus 2 carrots instead of russets and finished off with half a teaspoon of finely chopped fresh marjoram. My husband and I nearly finished the whole pot full in one sitting, along with some crusy French bread. A new one for the rotation.

I've made this soup twice now and I love the flavor and texture. The recipe says not to let the vegetables brown, but I found that a little carmelization makes for a better, earthier flavor. I also blended in the pot with a hand blender, making clean-up and prep super easy.

Instead of butter, I used some rendered duck fat I had on reserve, and added some white wine to the leek saute. Tossed in a bouquet garni with the broth while it simmered, and it flavored the soup marvelously. Would make it again with those same additions!

Would I make this again? As is...no. But with changes....absolutely! Any recipe with no herbs and spices is not a recipe to be used as is. Rather, this is a good starter recipe. I diced an onion and minced 3 cloves of garlic. I sauteed them in butter with the leeks and added the chives too. I also added in some salt, pepper, and thyme (I didn't have fresh on hand. But dried worked fine too) and herbs de Provance." I only used 4 cups of chicken broth. Also, my chopper is too small to blend a soup and I have no immersion blender. After simmering, I mashed the soup with a masher and added about a half cup or so of light cream (although I'm sure I could have gotten away with half and half). There was great texture. Great flavors done this way. I will make it again...my way that is!

Wonderful and easy to make soup. Made it as is first time and second time added garlic to the leeks as well as 2 bay leaves. I think it improved it and used red potatoes instead of russet (I need to watch the carb counts).

Chose this one because I picked all of my leeks in my garden and had about 9 1/2 cups of chopped leeks. I'll have it for dinner and then freeze the rest. Definitely a great vehicle for flavored salt, I used several pinches of a truffle salt. Also, used my own chicken broth, so more salt was needed. Added several sprigs of fresh thyme and 2 garlic cloves and a small onion like earlier suggestions. Definitely looking forward to eating this all winter long.

This came together quickly and easily, and was positively delicious. I tweaked a little based on what I had on hand. Added a sprig of thyme and small bay leaf to the leeks throughout the cooking process, then removed. Also salted and peppered generously. Was delicious at this point. For kicks, I added a splash of skim milk and some blue cheese and elevated it to exceptional!

Simply put, this soup freaking rocks! I do make a few changes from other reviewer suggestions & have found THE PERFECT fall weather soup. Add 2 chopped carrots, lots of garlic & a shallot when sauteing leeks. When the soup is done, add lots of thyme (fresh or dried), LOTS of lemon juice and top with parmesan & another squeeze of lemon. Serve w/ crusty bread. I know that sounds like a lot of tweaking, but please, it is so good! This soup does *not* need cream of any sort. Must add a bit of broth when adding potatoes though, or they stick. My son gobbles this up like candy!

I would give this recipe 4 stars, but I just used it as a base for my own version. For that it's perfect! Here's what I did: made a stock from the dark green sections of the leeks (never did make sense to me why people throw the tops away), cheese rinds that have been sitting in my fridge for a while, and random bits and pieces of veggies (radish tops, carrot bits, etc). Used this plus one cube chicken bouillon for the stock, added fresh garlic, thyme, pepper, and a little olive oil to the chopped leeks when sauteeing. Served with a little dollop of creme fraiche and chopped basil. Perfect for the crazy snow we've been getting lately!

I recently prepared the Bourbon, Molasses, Pecan glazed ham (which is fabulous) and put water in the bottom of the roasting pan while it was cooking, garnering a ridiculously good broth.... I used this broth to prepare this soup and it was outstanding! Of course I followed previous reviewers suggestions and added thyme, bay, etc., less the salt, and added some leftover lentils I had laying around. I will definitely make this again!

Great soup, read all the tweaks and proceeded to adapt the recipe. Added two nice size shallots and two cloves chopped garlic to the leeks and added the chicken soup before I added the poatoes (abt 26 ou), Added a bay leaf, abt two tsp fresh thyme and lots of fresh grnd pepper and kosher salt. Used my emersion blender and added more stock as the extra potatoes made it quite thick . Delicious. Meant to add some sherry to the leeks and reduce it before adding the stock, but forgot. Maybe next time. Incidently, took a little out at the end and added a touch of lemon juice as suggested by a previous reviewer. Don't, as it changes the entire flavor and character of the soup.

This soup is delicious! After the vegetables were tender, I used a hand masher to coarsely mash the potatoes instead of pureeing them. I added 4 oz sharp cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup lowfat sour cream as well. I used 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp white pepper. Even the kids loved this.

I also added garlic and reduced about 1/2 cup of vermouth with the leeks before adding the potatoes. I also added some fresh thyme and some bay leaves while it was simmering.

Sorry, Dela-where, I should have thanked you for your terrific input. I was in the process of making it AGAIN, when I saw Debbie's comments and had to put my two cents in. I would kill for some sherry pepper sauce, but it's unattainable here in Oaxaca. Next time I'm up north . . .

Debbie, this is one of the best soups I've ever made. If you had used leeks, added a shallot or two, a bay leaf and a clove of garlic or two, even a small onion, then put it through the blender you would have loved it. Don't hate a receipe before you use the ingredients called for and BTW, read and use the other reviewers' ideas, they are often terrific. This always gets raves when I make it.

We LOVED this soup! It was thick, creamy, flavorful, and satisfying....and without any added cream, also very healthy! Per the other reviews, I did tweak the ingredients a little bit. Here's what I did: I added a medium chopped shallot to the garlic and leek, and sauteed everything about 10 minutes in 3 Tbsp butter AND a good splash of extra virgin olive oil. I peeled & diced 3 large russet potatoes, which probably weighed about 24oz total. And definitely add the potatoes to the pot with some broth to keep them from browning at the beginning...I also put in several healthy dashes of seasoned salt at that time. After about 10 minutes, as the recipe suggested, I then added 4.5 cups of veggie broth, a bay leaf, 1/2tsp dried thyme, about 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice, and plenty of ground pepper and kosher salt, and cooked everything at a simmer for about 40 minutes. When everything was nice and tender, I used my handy dandy immersion blender to puree everything right in the pot prior to serving. I took another reviewers suggestion and added about a tablespoon of sherry pepper sauce (great stuff!) to the soup with the chives prior to serving. My husband and I enjoyed it with thick slices of french bread that were topped with a mixture of shredded cheddar cheese, a spoonful of of mayo, salt, parsley, and dijon mustard, and grilled in the broiler for a few minutes. Delicious!

Delicious and simple. I substituted 2 cups of chicken broth with 2 cups of the low sodium version of chicken stock and it worked perfectly. To present the soup, I cooked a large fresh bay scallop in butter with a sea salt and set the scallop in the center of a shallow soup dish. I even amazed myself not to mention my guests. Thanks to the reviewers for inspiration. Chitown amateur

I hate to be the only one with not a nice thing to say about this, but I was not impressed. I did use 1 c. of white wine in place of the homemade broth I used, but in all I still used 5 c. of liquid, so it only should have enhanced the flavor of the soup. Instead, I didn't find the texture to be appetizing and the flavor wasn't wonderful, either.

This soup was great! I only used 2 tablespoons of butter (and next time I'm going to just use 1), added a minced shallot to the leeks at the begining, did add some broth when I added the potatoes so they wouldn't brown, added a bay leaf, and then right before I pureed the soup I added the juice from half a lemon. It was great! At the very end I added a splash of light cream, but it totally doesn't need it. With some minor tweaks to jazz it up ever so slightly, this recipe is awesome.

I followed the directions, added a sweet onion for more flavor. It is helpful to add a little broth when you first begin cooking the potatoes. The butter has been absorbed so the broth reduces the chance of scorching. I have made this soup 4 times in as many weeks. For a large family dinner, company brunch, dinner party and just my family. It gets rave reviews each time!!!!

I used red potatoes and left on most of the skins for color and nutrients. Followed the advice of other cooks and added fresh lemon juice, two large sliced cloves of garlic, and two green onions with the broth. Also, used 1/2 veggie broth and 1/2 chicken broth. Cut the butter and added a bit of broth to avoid burning the veggies. So easy and so good!

I have an update -- this soup was a ton better heated up the next night, with more lawry's salt added while it was simmering. it was a little thicker, maybe the potatoes aged a little or something, but it had a more full-bodied taste. So now I will make it again, and just put it in the fridge right away to eat later.

Beyond bland - I would make this again, but with a million improvements. I was ransacking my cabinets for anything that could give this some flavor. I ended up added thyme, Lawry's season salt, white wine, and lemon juice, and then garnishing it with some grated parmesan cheese. It was also much thinner than I thought it would be. I guess I was expecting a kind of leeky onion soup mixed with chunky mashed potatoes, but this was more like cream of bland leek. So on second thought, maybe I'll look for a similar recipe that's better instead of making this again.

I didn't think this was bland OR gooey. I did use mostly chicken broth and I did puree the whole thing (and yes, I did add a handful of really sharp cheddar). My family slurped it up and my dieting hubby was very glad--and surprised--that I didn't use cream. Will add to the rotation!

I made it exactly as listed here and just wasn't impressed. Not bad, pretty tasty, but lacking oomph.

I added some garlic powder and dried thyme since I was too lazy to mess with the fresh. I also reduced the amount of butter by half and added some Spanish olive oil. I reduced the amount of broth by a half cup and added a half cup of evaporated skim milk. Made it even richer and creamier without adding a single gram of fat! So there.

I've made this recipe several times. It's easy, fast, and tastes like it should be bad for you (very creamy and rich)

easy and good. has a great mellow flavor. i forgot the chives at the end but added some sauted brown mushrooms after it was pureed for some texture.

Delicious and easy! I added 2 large cloves of garlic as the broth was simmering. Very satisfying without inducing much guilt.

This recipe was excellent. I made a few variations: I used 4 leeks instead of 3 and cooked them in butter and two cloves of garlic. I also added an extra cup of cooked, cubed potatoes at the end to give it the "chunky" texture.

Yum! What a great comfort food. I added three cloves of garlic (chopped) when the potatoes went in. The second time I made this, I squeezed the juice of one lemon into the soup (brightens the flavors), and added about two tablespoons of fresh thyme leaves. Guests loved it. This is a keeper.

I have made this recipe so many times I can do it with my eyes closed. If I see nice leeks in the store, I automatically buy them. My kids love it. I went camping last weekend and all the kids loved it. My husband and I also enjoy it. Nice, easy, and tasty. I will try the variations suggested as well.

Delicious and easy recipe!! I took the advice of other cooks and added 3 scallions and 2 cloves of garlic to the boiling liquid. Tastes like a rich cream soup. I've already made 2 batches!

GREAT! This soup seems much more sinful than it is. Try adding some sliced garlic just after you add the stock and leave it in the when you puree. Perfect for a family dinner or a fancy dinner party.

I followed several of the other cooks' suggestions, adding two scallions and reducing the butter to two Tbsp. It was delicous, and the leftover soup went great with a curried chicken salad sandwich as my brown bag lunch at work the next day.

I added a chopped scallion during the boiling stage and it was terrific. This is a great soup. Very low fat. I also used a little less butter and poured some of the broth in while the leeks were softening. That lowered the fat even more and didn't sacrifice the taste. I will definitely be making this again.

I found the soup a little bland, so added three chicken bouillon cubes, and a good shake of garlic salt. Would now rate it 3

This delicious and satisfying soup was very easy to make. Because it is pureed, it has the consistency of a cream soup, but without the fat. A definite keeper.

I adapted this recipe for my vegetarian daughter and substituted vegetable broth for the chicken. The soup was perfect! She loved it and the flavors were wonderful. We have served this soup at various family functions and it has always been a hit. I also like the fact that it is quick and easy to prepare and is even more flavorful when reheated the next day.
