What a wonderful recipe for pork stew meat!! Completely new flavor profile. Savory, herby,deliciousness. Pitted olives are easy to pit. Whack them with a large knife flattened on your board. Pits are picked out in seconds!

Good in pressure cooker (PC)! Every time I've cooked with a PC, the dish turned out bland but not this time. Made this in 45 minutes. Browned meat and onions/garlic per recipe. Put all in PC. Cooked 10 min. Added olives Cooked 5 min. Added vegetables (I added baby carrots in addition to the beans). Cooked 3 min. Wala!

I definitely think this is worth making and would make again. I added capers, kalamata and another deli black olives. Thanks for all the reviews.

Might I add, I used a pork loin and cut it into small chunks, I also added thyme, oregano and rosemary.

This was a very good recipe that I had to alter slightly. I used a slow cooker and used kalamata olives and capers. Also, I added a small can of tomato paste to thicken it a little and served it over yellow (saffron) rice. The green beans I added about 1/2 hour before I served it. Then topped it with a little feta cheese. Yummy.

Very tasty and easily prepared. Used a lean pork cut and as keeping for later did not include the beans but cooked separately.

I'm really amazed to see that three years have past since I wrote my positive review for this recipe and nobody else has reviewed it since. This really is a good recipe (and good as is unlike many other recipes), try it out and you'll see!

Delicious and easy. Instead of spare ribs I used shoulder chops. I also added some red wine vinegar and about 2 tablespoons of capers which gave it an extra mediterranean twist. I served it with the Mustard and Spring Onion Mash which was a hearty combination. Definitely a keeper for me.

I loved this recipe! I used nicoise olives and fresh green beans and they worked out very well. I did use country style boneless ribs, and they were too fatty, so next time I will use a leaner cut of pork. But the meat was falling apart tender. I put the onion through the food processor and that seemed to give the dish a bit more texture. I ended up making this one night and serving it the next, and I could easily have defatted it. It still was totally yummy!

Overall: very aromatic and tasty. And I thank the last reviewer from Temple, Texas for his/her suggestions. I used 2+ lb. of pork loin chops (cut into chunks) and frozen green beans. The only other changes that I would suggest are: to add some fresh thyme near the end of cooking and to use pitted Kalamata olives (rather than California black olives; this will keep the Mediterranean flavor . . . I used Nicoise olives and the pits interfered with the experience).

I've been making this for a while now, and everybody in the family looks forward to it. I make a few very minor substitutions, though. I use pork loin "butterfly" chops instead of the spareribs, as most pork ribs are entirely too fatty so far as I'm concerned.I'm not a health nut. I just don't like any fat clinging to soup or stew meat. It just ruins the whole dish for me. Instead of the plum tomatoes, I use two cans of plain old sliced, stewed tomatoes, and I use frozen cut green beans that have been thawed beforehand instead of the fresh. Also, I use a can of plain old medium-sized black olives. Nothing fancy. Remember to rinse them well, or the stew will be briny. This dish is especially good as leftovers.

It sounds like an amazing recipe, but both my husband and I were left staring into the finished pot and saying, "It needs something else." I think that something else is potato. I have cubed two large peeled potatoes and added them to the leftovers. Hope that will give it a little more body, make it more stew-y and less soup-y. The flavors are tasty, but it's really not a stew without something to give it texture other than the pork chunks and the green beans. As the definition for the fork rating goes...Liked it, didn't love it.

I made this dish for guests and everyone loved it! The flavors are subtle but fresh. As a stew, it's not too heavy. Near the end of cooking, I added some mini-shells to thicken the sauce a bit. You could also add orzo.

Incredibly aromatic dish that provides a wonderful escape from the traditional stew.
