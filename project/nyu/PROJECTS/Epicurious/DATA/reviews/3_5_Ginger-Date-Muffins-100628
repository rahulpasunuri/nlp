I didn't have any ground ginger or molasses so I used crystalized ginger and dark corn syrup. Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly. They tasted fantastic, but were a little too greasy for my taste.I would have cut down on the butter and maybe not added quite so many dates. I'll try it again with a couple of tweaks.

I'm glad I read the reviews before making these. As I was making them, I kept wondering, "Where's the milk or juice?" I did everything the recipe said and the batter didn't look like muffin batter. I decided I didn't like the idea of the muffins not doming either. So I added another egg, and yogurt--about 1/3 of a cup. I also added about 1/4 cup buttermilk. I added the extra half teaspoon, as one person suggested, and I cut the brown sugar back to 4 tsp as another person said. I also added about 1/4 cup crystallized ginger. We didn't have any dates, but I added walnuts. I baked the muffins as the recipe said, and they were browned, but not done in the middle. So I would suggest if you live like I do above 5,000 ft, turn down the oven. They did dome and were pretty. They taste fine. But if you're going to make muffins, try the Giant Pumpkin Muffins with Molasses-Ginger Glaze (I don't use the glaze) recipe on this site. They're scrumptious!

As a ginger lover I have made these a few times. I don't like alot of sugar, so reduced sugar to 1 tablespoon and molasses to 4 tablesppons which was sufficient. Substituted 1/2 butter with yogurt and apple sauce, used wholemeal flour, and added 2 tablespoons ginger and a dash of cardamom. Loved them!! Definitely more of a dessert/cakey muffin but lovely.

These were lovely, even though i overbaked them a little by mistake. I used half whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup yogurt and 1/4 cup apple sauce to substitute for 1/2 a cup of the butter, and good probably have nixed it altogether. The result was not dry at all, and I felt that the ginger, molasses, and date flavours were a perfect balance of a combination I had never tasted before.

I soaked my dates in hot water, added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and used blackstrap molasses (I love molasses). These were fantastic!

I found these muffins absolutely brilliant with the following key amendments: 1 3/4 cups of medjool dates. These dates are exceedingly moist and flavoursome and far superior to ordinary dates. 1 teaspoon of baking powder instead of 1/2 teaspoon. 3 tablespoons of treacle+ 3 tablespoons of golden syrup or corn syrup Add dataes to flour, ginger, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Baking time may take longer than the recipe suggests depending on size of muffin, type of oven.

These muffins were much better than I'd expected. I thought the flavor was excellent, and really unique for a muffin. It kind of tasted like gingerbread. These border on being a dessert--I could see serving them warm with whipped cream or ice cream. I'll definitely make again. I made them exactly as written and didn't have any issue with the molassas flavor. FYI, the cooking time for me was more like 19 minutes.

This recipe may as well be named "molasses muffins", the ginger and the dates are overpowered. I can't see myself making these again.

I made these for the first time today and followed the recipe as written. Contrary to many of the other reviewers, I don't think that the molasses is overpowering. I used packed dates which I soaked in hot water while I was preparing the rest of the recipe. The soaking prevented the dates from drying out while baking. I had to leave the muffins in the oven for an extra 5 minutes and they came out nice and moist. I'll definately be making these again.

I went with all the molasses and found the muffins to be tasty, though very molasses-y. I might substitute a just a couple of the tablespoons with honey the next time to see if they are better that way. I used only 5oz of dates as I don't love dried fruit in my muffins. I actually liked the dates more than I though I would..I think they are much better than raisins and combined with the dried ginger it almost seems as though there is candied ginger in the mix. The best way to eat these muffins is warmed and buttered.

This molasses montrosity provided more amusement than nutriment, first because it was impossible to remove intact from the muffin tin (use paper liners!), and second because the molasses flavor was insanely overwhelming, even for an avowed molasses lover. I guess this is my lesson to heed previous reviews. ;) The results were indeed very moist and dense. I don't see how this turned out "cake-like". It's much too strong for me to eat an entire muffin whole (well, "at once", given that none of my muffins are whole), so I'm planning to use the crumbs as an ice cream topping. I substituted 2t of fresh grated ginger for the 1t ground ginger, which I lacked, and I'm wishing I'd just used chopped crystallized ginger as I'd considered. I couldn't taste the fresh ginger at all, which I guess isn't that surprising. If I get up the guts to experiment with this again, I'll definitely use honey or corn syrup to replace at least 4T of the molasses, and try increasing the ginger flavor.

So easy and absolutely delicious. More of a cake-like muffin. I used plump and succulent medjool dates instead of the run-of-the-mill variety. If you can, wait until the next day to savour - when all the flavours have had time to"marry".

Made these muffins using golden syrup which is more to our Australian taste than molasses and they were a huge hit at work. I was asked for the recipe and then told to go home and make some more.

Since I'm not a fan of dry muffins, this rich, moist delight was right up my alley! On my second attempt, I plan on using the amount of molasses called for. (I took the suggestion of substituting half honey. I could handle a stronger molasses flavor.) I was tempted to rate it a "four fork".

Being British, I must admit we're not really American Muffin connisseurs, but this went down very well at home! I didn't have any molasses so used golden syrup (corn syrup I think) and they were delicious.

This is an excellent recipe. I substituted honey for 1/2 of the molasses and even after this change the molasses taste was strong enough for my taste.
