Very delicious and a good variation to our normal grilled entrees. I had most items on hand, (TJs frozen shrimp, substituted regular broccoli as well as used candied ginger. I don't even know what fermented black beans are, so mashed up canned. Also, I don't own a wok, so used large saute pan.)

I am making this again for about the third time in a month, mostly because I can get Chinese broccoli at the farmer's market -- and because it is terrific! Served over sticky rice - yum. My husband loves it.

I'm glad I found this recipe since I tend to make the same sauce with stir fry, and was bored with it. I halved the recipe and used regular broccoli, which I microwaved beforehand, and instead of the jalapeno and garlic used Asian chili garlic paste. Served over brown rice. Quite tasty!

This is not a quick dish but well worth the extra effort. Very tasteful.

Excellent recipe that I've made several times. I make Chinese food regularly, so I have all the ingredients. Also made this recipe with (shredded) chicken in place of shrimp; this is also excellent. NOTE: gai lan leaves need to be torn into two pieces if leaves are large. Enjoy!

Simply delicious. Only substitution I made was black beans with garlic in place of fermented black beans. My husband was thrilled and made the comment: "This is better than a filet mignon, my usual special dish."

Very good rendition of a Chinese "home cooking" type dish. In response to the cook from Palatine Bridge, NY - broccoli rabe is not a true substitute for gai lan. Gai lan is much more subtly flavored and won't overpower the shrimp like broccoli rabe. This recipe also works well with other meats or seafood - chicken, squid, scallops, and/or pork would be my choice if I didn't have shrimp on hand.

Fortunately, my local farmer's market has two vendors who only sell Chinese vegetables, making it easy to follow the recipe exactly the first time. Since then, I prefer to quickly stir-fry baby bok choy instead of using gan lai (the flavors are similar). I set it aside, then stir it in before serving. This is fast enough to make for the family during the week, but special enough to serve to guests. We like it with rice.

I had to substitute to make this recipe. I used broccoli rabe and cooked black beans and a diferent kind of hot pepper.. Otherwise I did evertyhing else the recipe said to do. The ginger flavor really came through which I love. The broccoli rabe dominated the shrimp though. The shrimp was just a nice texture shrimpy part of the dish,it's flavor was very subtle. Good and healthy. I didn't find that the way I made this gave much sauce at all. I've never worked with fermented beans, possibly they would have given more liquid. Goin' for seconds!

I think I'll have to try this dish again. I substituted black bean sauce for the fermented black beans...but I'll have to try a different black bean sauce brand. Sometimes I go for the authentic brand at my local asian grocery instead of the familiar and this time it steered me wrong...all I can say is "funny" smell... PS This makes a lot of sauce.

This is a fantastic recipe that can be made in a hurry. I have no comments to improve - it works great as directed, and is flexible with simple substitutions if need be. My favourite item from the entire "Meal of Fortune" menu.

If you are new to stir-fry as I am, this is a great starter dish. The fermented black beans can be found in the Asian food aisle of any supermarket. I used regular broccoli to get started on this recipe quickly. We didn't wait to even finish this meal before my husband and I were already thinking up ways to make it again--using sliced beef, chicken, even steamed clams...adding snow peas instead of broccoli, and so on. The half jalapeno gave it just the right 'kick' without being over the top. The only measurement I would change is adding more cornstarch to thicken the gravy, it was a bit too thin for us otherwise. Will make this again and again, and next time will seek out the Chinese broccoli now that I know this one is a keeper.

To the cook on 1/26: It must be nice to NEVER have a cooking question yourself. Get a grip. Yes, I just used this space for a comment instead of reviewing the recipe - hope it didn't ruin your day.

I had some fermented black beans in the cabinet and have been looking for a recipe to use them. And I have now found it! I did use tofu in place of shrimp. Thought the dish would need more veggies than just the broccoli, but I was wrong. The simple combination of the tofu and green veggie with the black bean sauce was wonderful. Definitely will make again. Served over rice. Will do rice noodles next time.

I substituted black bean sauce with garlic for the fermented beans and used one chopped thai bird chile instead of the jalepeno. I think a little more black bean sauce and even more chile wouldn't be too spicy. Loved the Chinese broccoli.

This recipe was fantastic!! However, a word to the cook who was so upset by people treating this space as a forum: If that is one of the worst parts of your day, count yourself blessed! Chill out, have a glass of wine and relax!

This was excellent. I didn't have a jalepeno, so I used a bit of sambal olek chili sauce. The dish was excellent. Per another reviewer, I quickly stir fried the chinese broccoli in a bit of oil and garlic, with salt and pepper, put it in the platter, then added the cooked dish on top. Rice would be a good accompanyment, but we had steamed dumplings as an appetizer, and that was our starch Great dish!!

Wouldn't it be so much more interesting if people would stop treating reviews like forum entries and actually, um... I don't know, maybe try the recipes and review them? This is why I read reviews and it is annoying that people guess about and offer suggestions for recipes that they have not yet tried. Sorry about my forum-like rant, but I am consistently frustrated by this non-helpful practice.

It does look like a good recipe. Question - can you substitute black bean sauce for fermented black beans?

Looks like a good recipe. Gai Lan is quite tender and doesn't need to be blanched. I would chop it up. Give it a very quick stir fry over high heat. Reserve it and then add it back at the end when everything is cooked, thus eliminating a step and giving you a more crisp product.
