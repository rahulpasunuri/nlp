I was looking for a recipe to use my incredible fresh Dill and Leeks from the garden and this did not disappoint. I know others have mentioned that they added flavors, but for me, it's about the Dill and Leeks and if you have the best of those you definitely don't need to add anything else!

I agree with others that the flavor fell a little flat in the past. So, this time I added a bunch'a stuff and got rave reviews from the family: 4 cloves garlic (chopped), 1c fennel (diced) and 1 pint baby bella mushrooms (sliced) added in to the leeks for sautéing. 1t smoked paprika, 1t sweet paprika, 1T red pepper flakes and 1t celery salt added near the end of the sautéing. 1 small bag frozen peas and 2T fresh parsley (chopped) added after the noodles and leek sauce combined. This is a wonderful cold night comfort food dish. One of my favorites!

This was good, but needs something to add a little more flavor. When I make it again, I'm going to double the lemon juice and add some cayenne - not so much that it adds a lot of heat, but enough to add some depth of flavor. I may also increase the amount of cheese. It can be better, and is worth making a second time.

Used some albacore pieces I had in the freezer...poached the tuna in veggie stock, otherwise followed the recipe as written. Excellent! I agree with other reviewers that the mixture firms up when cooking, so definitely add the pasta water. I also served it with lemon wedges on the side so folks could brighten it up as needed.

I even burned the leeks, and it was still good. Used whole wheat rotini instead of noodles, and parmesean cheese, not gruyere. Also, no fresh dill so used dill seed (2 tsp). I grew up on tuna noodle casserole on Friday nights. This was really good.

It tastes good, but next time I make it I will try to add some more ooomph, like other people have said. It looks gorgeous at least.

This dish was fine. However, it wasn't markedly different from its predecessor. I basically followed the recipe as written. I added more cheese though as I thought its was over powered by the tuna. I would recommend adding extra lemon juice and dill. Everyone seemed to like it though.

Whatta ya know -- prepare the dish according to the recipe, and it's delicious! Comfort food defined, and really tasty. My only deviation was omitting the pasta water, as the mix was quite loose already. It did turn out pretty firm, probably some of the water wouldn't have hurt.

I agree with most other reviewers; not bad, but not 4 forks. Dont omit the pasta water; I did and it was drier than I would have liked. As for laully from Chico, CA saying the recipe did not call for salt and pepper, he or she is only half right. It calls for adding kosher salt to the leeks. Dont add too much, the chips are salty. I hate dill so I added fresh basil. I will add a whole cup of Gruyere next time and perhaps a splash of sherry when thickening the roux. It just needs a little more umph. Geneva tonno in olive oil is a must; look for cans imported from Italy; the yellow fin is the greatest.

Only three forks because although delicious and a very nice dish, it wasn't quite exceptional. It was incredibly comforting though, and even though it didn't contain velveeta and Campbell's cream-of (like the tuna casserole of my midwestern childhood), it wasn't so far off from that that I didn't recognize what I was eating. After reading the other reviews, I sauteed some thinly sliced celery with the leek. Also, my leeks didn't yield as much as I thought they would, so I added the white parts of some scallions to round it out. When those were cooking, before adding the flour, along with salt and pepper, I added some garlic powder, and a couple dashes of cayenne (not enough to taste, but to add a little depth of flavor). I added the tuna and the dill right to the cream sauce, and then tossed the hot pasta right in. I used more pasta than it called for to stretch it out a bit, and it was still very saucy and flavorful. I don't know that using the albacore packed in oil was actually necessary or that beneficial to the recipe. I would probably use a cheaper tuna next time. I also used a mix of cheddar and parmesan instead of gruyere, and it was great.

We've made this recipe twice exactly as directed and we love it! Maybe the Rustichella D'Abbruzzo pasta helps, as well as the Ortiz tuna in oil, but I can't understand all the negative reviews, especially from people who changed so many ingredients and steps! (Man, that's annoying. If you're going to change the recipe, don't take away from it's fork rating - that's just unfair to the writer.) We also used a very high quality gruyere (Beeler), and since the recipe only calls for 2.5 ounces, I can't imagine that the expense of it would send someone over the edge, as one reviewer noted. If you have some leftover, well lucky you! I kind of figured since the theme of the article was comfort casseroles upgraded, using high quality ingredients made sense, and it paid off. Next time I'm going to try to lighten up the recipe a bit, which shouldn't be too hard since it's really not too awfully heavy to begin with, but I'm on a diet so some baked kettle chips, tuna in water and replacing some of the pasta with artichokes might make this even less if an indulgence and more of a balanced everyday kind of meal.

My boys loved this recipe! I omitted the dill and it was delicious and easy to make.

Very good. Increased the quantities of butter, celery seed, lemon juice, dill, salt and pepper. Also used cave aged gruyere (and doubled the amount). Made a very tasty, kid friendly meal with plenty of leftovers.

I made this last night and everyone loved it. The only reason I don't give it 4 forks is that it isn't really a "wow" dish, but it was tasty, comforting, and totally hit the spot. Easy to make, too. Will definitely make again.

My husband and I liked this a lot better than the regular old can of soup recipe. I agree that upping the celery seeds and dill would be nice. Defintiely bake it uncovered. I used Trader Joe's salt and pepper chips on top and that was a nice touch.

It was alright. If I make it again, I will use regular swiss, since I couldn't taste a difference from the gruyere. I added some celery with the leeks, but I might use more next time or maybe some peas. The recipe didn't call for salt and pepper, but it definitely needs them.

This is a great update to a traditional, classic favorite. We will definitely make it again. The reason we gave it 3 of 4 stars is because the recipe is slightly under seasoned.

Hubby liked this, I did not. I thought this would somehow "elevate" the basic tuna casserole. Even with extra cheese, lemon juice and dill, it was still just basic tuna casserole. I won't be making this again.

When I got my March issue in the mail this recipe caught my attention. I purchased all the ingredients but hadn't made it. I went online and read the reviews and was I glad I did because I made all the seasoning adjustments and really was happy with the end results too. Because one can't find packages of noodles in 8oz size but mainly in 12-16 oz. I knew I would totally change the ratio of liquids and spices. For starters I had purchsed Tonnino Yellow Finn Tuna in 6.7 oz jars (no comparison to canned in oil) packaged washed and ready to use leeks from Trader Joes from France. I purchased .8 lb of gruyere cheese also. I buy lemons in bulk and squeeze a doz and put them in small plastic containers so that I have "fresh" squeezed whenever I need it on hand. I used 1 stick salted butter and not half a stick of unsalted to cook the leeks for longer than the suggested time. Used 1 tsp of celery seed. Added 1 cup of whole milk and 1 cup of half & half and about 2-3TBS.lemon juice. Used over 1/4-1/2 cup flour to thicken. When the consistency that I wanted, I used an immersion blender to make a thick sauce without any trace of leek pieces. Cooked the extra wide egg noodles for 8 minutes, drained and added the white sauce, gruyere cheese, dill, more salt and pepper and tasted and added about 1/4 tsp of dry thyme. Put the mixture in two Pyrex dishes... one 8X8 and one 7.5X5. Unlike the recipe, I crushed in my hands half a large bag of kettle chips and spread on both casseroles. I baked it at 375 like recipe but UNCOVERED for 25-30 minutes until chips browned and casserole was bubbling and brown on sides. Froze one casserole already and will eat the other cold/warm/reheated since it's delish.... I sure hope that this encourages someone to make this recipe and not pass on it.

After reading the poor reviews of this recipe that said it was bland and having purchased all the ingredients, I made a lot of adjustments and made it a very good recipe to make again. Since most noodles come in 12oz bags and not 8oz changed all amounts and seasonings too. For starters used 2 TONNINO Yellow Fin tuna in 6.7 oz jars. Nothing like canned tuna in oil. Cooked 2 pkgs leeks (imported from France at Trader Joe's washed and ready to use) quarted and cut into small pieces in 1 stick of salted butter. Added more kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, 3T juice of one fresh squeezed lemon, 1/2 cup of flour, 1 cup whole milk,1 cup 1/2 & 1/2,thickened mixture used wisk and then used an immersion blender to make a wonderful roux without the pieces of leek. Added entire piece (.7lb) of gruyere cheese grated, 1/4 cup fresh dill chopped, more salt and pepper and a little dry thyme since it's a lemon flavor. Cooked extra wide noodles 8 minutes and drained and added above. Used one 8"X8" Pyrex dish & one 7.5" X 5" Pyrex dish and filled both with mixture.(tasted great warm too) Added half a big bag of low salt kettle chips crushed by hand before baking and baked UNCOVERED for 25-30 minutes at 375 degrees until chips are brown and it's bubbling. One is already frozen and the other will be eaten cold or reheated. I think that you will enjoy this recipe with whatever you do to make it your own and to your taste. I love cooking and always change it up no matter where I get the recipe and improve it. I would only make this again the way that I have just written about.

I also expected more and found this bland. Couldn't really taste the dill and the potato chip topping was superfluous.

Rating: 2
For all the time and expense (gruyere) I think the old canned soup version is superior. Just too bland even tho I upped the dill and lemon juice. The difference may also be in far less salt than the canned version.

I was expecting something more from this recipe-fresh dill, good quality, gruyere, a good white sauce...what's not to like? But in the end, it just tasted like...tuna casserole. If you love tuna casserole, you will love this. But if you were hoping for something that tastes a little different, this just doesn't quite go there. Perhaps increasing the amount of lemon juice in the white sauce or increasing the amount of fresh dill (which was totally lost) would help.
