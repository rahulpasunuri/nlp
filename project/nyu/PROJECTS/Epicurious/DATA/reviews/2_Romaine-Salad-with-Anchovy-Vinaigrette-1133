I found the original recipe "flat" and rated it as such. It had potential, so I have played around with it a couple of times and came up with this: added 1 garlic, changed the anchovies to 3, added more Dijon mustard, decreased the olive oil to 3 T, added 2 T of fresh parmasan cheese and a good shaking of fresh grounded pepper and coarse salt. I topped the salad with chopped tomatoes and crutons for colour. I get bulk romaine lettuce from Costo so I tend to make this quite often.
