Wow - this was so yummy!! I will most definately be making this again! I think that the oil can be cut back by a quarter. I used one large pink lady apple, napa cabbage only and subbed cranberries for the sour cherries. Excellent.

Very easy to prepare in advance. The slaw was great after standing (refrigerated) overnight. I did wait until just before serving to toss in the pecans. I didn't read all the reviews, so maybe someone else has already said this: Sushi vinegar can be made at home with 5 Tbsp rice vinegar, 5 Tbsp sugar, and 2 tsp salt. Heat the mixture to dissolve the solids, then cool. Terrific, colorful, and so, so easy!

I had to make changes based on not having all the ingredients. I only had green cabbage and green apples. Instead of raisins, I chopped up dried apricots. Everything else was the same. It was fabulous!

My go-to slaw. Everyone loves it, there's no mayo to spoil so it's a great picnic or potluck choice, and I almost always have the ingredients on hand. Perfect!

I love this salad and all of my friends did too, I would definitely make it again! However I thought there was way too much oil in the original recipe so I modified it a bit. I used only 2 tablespoons of walnut oil instead of 1/4 cup (half of the recommended use) and then I complimented that with some specialty flavored vinegars: honey ginger balsamic and lemon vinegar. It was delish! I would highly recommend tweaking the dressing to reduce the fat content and increase the flavor, so yum!

This was wonderful, though I admit, I added more cayenne than called for, as I added it to the dressing; and I added a dash of Worcesteshire to the dressing as well. I included the spiced pecans, but don't think they did anything for the salad: it's the vinegar and spice, and sweetness from the apples, balanced with the cabbage, that works. And I was surprised how great it was the second day. Addictive.

Very good and even better the next day. I halved the recipe but not the dresssing. Only had red cabbage and dried cranberries so that's what I used. Next time would chopped the apples instead of slicing. The flavor is great - hard to stop eating. Definitely a keeper.

I served this with White Chicken Chili and Jalapeno Cheddar Cornbread, it was delicious. Great contrasts of flavors and textures. The red juices from the cabbage lightly covered the apples to make a very attractive dish!

My husband and I both loved this salad, which we served as an accompaniment to steaks. It has all the elements: sweet, sour, salty, spicy, crunchy. I would definitely make the pecans spicier than the recipe asks for, if you like any kind of kick at all. I used a Honeycrisp apple instead of Braeburn, and it was fantastic.

Wow! Easy, fast, and very pretty. Great for potlucks, guests, family dinners. Make as written, also great with small amount of shredded dark green kale in place of napa cabbage, and less dried fruit, about 1/4c. (Also, try cranberries in lieu of cherries).

Yum...I ate the leftovers for breakfast. I made ahead to marinate the flavors...won't do that next time as the cabbage wilted, but will definitely make again. The ladies asked for the recipe...that's always a good sign.

I've been increasing the health meter of the food without sacrificing the taste at our table. For this recipe, what I had on hand were just the red cabbage, Fuji apples, soy sauce absent Worcestershire sauce and Cholula sauce, absent cayenne and craisins absent tart cherries. I followed the rest of the recipes and my husband and I plus the other people who got a taste of it loved it!

Rating: 4
Very, very good. Made twice. Followed recipe the first time and second time substituted radicchio for the red cabbage and it was just as good. I plan on making again and sauteing apples in a small amount of butter over high heat to warm and brown quickly. I love cold salads with warm fruit or vegetables and the crisp brown apples on top would look pretty.

Loved this salad. Didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so substituted soy sauce instead. Left out the dried cherries as I thought this recipe was sweet enough to begin with. I also grated the apple instead of slicing. It was a hit!

Wow this was so good! I used all napa cabbage and skipped the red. My husband said don't lose this recipe it is perfect for fall. I did add about a tablespoon of honey to the dressing and it was perfect!

I really enjoyed this. It wasn't mind-blowing awesome, but a great go- to salad that is fairly quick and easy. I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: I added about a TSP of chili oil to my mostly 1/4 of olive oil. I couldn't find cherries, so I went with cranberries. It was a great salad, especially with the pecans. They are worth the extra effort. This would be a fantastic salad with a pork dish. Give it a shot. I will be making it again.

I went with all red cabbage and chopped up and threw in one entire jalapeno - for those of you that like some heat, it was a pefect compliment to this great recipie.

This has quickly become my go-to recipe for a winter mid-week dinner salad and a favorite of my husband's. Actually I started using it to get away from his other favorite, the old mayonnaise dressing Waldorf salad, that is so heavy and boring. I find that making a double or triple batch of the nuts every few weeks and storing the extra really makes this salad a snap to put together on a week night.

Delicious salad. Served it up and family commented, "this is not something I would normally like, but it's delicious!" I doubled the dressing recipe. Couldn't find dried cherries, so I used dried cranberries and walnuts with great results. I only wish the cabbage wouldn't turn the apples red as the salad marinates. I would recommend adding a few more candied spicy walnuts. The recipe for the spicy candied nuts is a great one in and of itself. Would be great for a special party snack.

Delicious and fast! I chopped everything small and uses candied pecans I already had on hand.

I had a huge head of Napa cabbage in my fridge from a CSA delivery. I typically eat the cabbage because I feel obligated to for health and so I'm not wasteful but I don't love it. I have to admit that I am surprised by how much I liked this salad! I had all the ingredients on hand except the cherries, so I substituted cranberries instead. I also used a different seasonal apple. I love that it's so quick and easy to make.

This was so tasty. My husband said it was one of the best dishes I had ever made. We will definitely make this again regularly!

This was good but not great. If I made it again I would cut the apples into 8ths before slicing, the pieces of apple were just too big. I gave the cabbages a rough chop after thinly slicing, in hindsight it would have been better to have chopped it more. It was a case of everything was too big for the fork. Chopped cabbage, smaller apple slices would have been easier to eat and get a bite of all the items combined. I also found the whole thing more tart than "perfect balance of sweet, savory...". The pecans could use more heat too. For me, this was fine but not good enough to make "the list".

Actually makes 8 side servings easily. Used cranberries and pink lady apples. Green cabbage instead of napa. Great use for a lot of cabbage. The pecans tasted great alone, but I feel like they got lost in the vinaigrette.

I made this pretty much as written except used dried cranberries as I could not find the dried cherries in Geneva. My husband loved it so much he took some to the office for this lunch the next day. Great winter salad!

We loved this recipe, but let me start by saying that I found this late in the day and didn't have time to shop, so I made several substitutions. Instead of pecans I used sliced almonds. Instead of Worcestershire sauce I used soy sauce. Instead of the other vinegars I used balsamic vinegar. Instead of Dijon mustard I used spicy brown mustard. And instead of dried cherries I used dried cranberries. Everything else was the same, and in spite of all the substitutions, it was great! An excellent marrying of flavors! I will definitely make this again - this time I'll try the given ingredients. :-)

I really loved this recipe. I had the same predicament as the reviewer below: I was given a big beautiful home-grown cabbage and didn't quite know what to do with it, only my cabbage was green. Being a not-so-big fan of cooked cabbage, I was looking for a bit of a different coleslaw recipe and this was perfect. I used green apple (to match my cabbage), substituted a little extra cider vinegar since I didn't have rice vinegar, and stirred in some plain yogurt to add some creaminess. Crisp and fresh and delicious! This goes perfect with summer barbeque!

This recipe is easy, fast to make and delicious. The pecans were a great touch. I substituted dried cranberries and balsamic vinegar as the dressing is similar to what I made before seeing this recipe.

There is not much in the way of ingredents so I thought to myself "how good could this be"?I'm not a big worceshestershire or coleslaw fan,yet I was stuck with a huge red cabbage in my fridge. I make it anyway. .OH MY GOSH!It merits a place in my "EXCELLENT" file.Thinking about putting it on my Chrstmas buffet table.

I liked this recipe and so did my family. I especially liked being able to make this salad in a hurry. Like everyone else, I substituted a few items. I replaced shredded carrots for the red cabbage and dried cranberries for the cherries. Also, I didn't bother to put lemon juice on my apples because I knew we'd eat it the minute I put it on the table. Lastly, I doubled the dressing because I knew I was going to make this salad again soon.

I made this salad as a side dish for a pig roast. It was fantastic. The tang of the cranberries really complimented the pork. I have made it since then and tried a rasberry/white balsamic dressing instead. I thought is was even better and so did my guests. This is defenitly a summer keeper!!

i wanted to use up some Napa so I tried this, but thought it was only "eh." Maybe a B.I thought the pecans were greasy (I usually carmelize nuts without an oil/butter), and the rest just wasn't amazing as the reviews had led me to believe. It definitely is pretty! Probably won't make again.

I made this for our gourmet dinner club recently and it received rave reviews. In fairness to the recipe, I made it exactly as specified and after tasting it, I would change nothing! I think that people that alter recipes before they even try them are missing the point of following a recipe. In all of their culinary arrogance, I think they should just write their own cookbooks!

I made this salad for a baby shower, and it was awesome, and I got requests for the recipe. Take care to get the pecans out of the butter right away, otherwise they become a bit too caramelized. You can use a soy butter instead, especially if you have a lot of vegans to feed. Totally delicious, make it!

loved it! paired with a thai chicken/rice entree. I did make some changes. skipped the red cabbage and added bib lettuce for texture/color. Added fresh mango and green apple instead pf braeburn. green is tangier. And i doubled the dressing quanity. Mixed all the goods together and chilled for 30 minutes before serving. That was key to blending the flavors. D-lish!

I made this for New Year's eve and paired it with Rack of Lamb. It was so different and everyone loved it. I did add a bit of the dressing, early, to just the cabbage so that it could marinate just a bit longer. I also sprinkled feta on top and substituted pomogranite seeds for the other. I will definitely make this again!

Made this for Christmas dinner and people were passing up the mashed potatoes and desserts to have third and fourth helpings of the salad! The only change I made was cutting down a little bit on the cayenne because of the kids. I love that it can be mostly made ahead and combined just before serving.
