Very nice -- crust was beautifully crunchy and the apple was just right. I didn't change anything but used just a pinch of cinnamon.

Loved this! I added butterscotch chips to my crumble mix and it was super yummy. See details and pics on my blog at ValerieLin.com

I par cooked the apples first until softened, drained them & put them in the dish, then added the crumble mixture & cooked for 25 mins instead of 55. Delicious!!

Made 2x-11 ramekins of crumble. Added orange zest,ginger to the crumble. Make your own vanilla bean ice cream. (recipe on this site)Soo much better.

Very tasty, but the topping was a little too oat-y for our family.

A big hit with my fussy family. I forgot to add the sugar to the apple mix, but it did not matter at all. In fact the tartness of the apples was lovely. My eight year old who has never liked crumble had three helpings!

Nice recipe, all my guests enjoyed it & many asked for second helpings! I tweaked the recipe as follows: .. Used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice & 2 fresh-squeezed orange juice .. Substituted 2 apples with peaches .. Added a half teaspoon of powered ginger.. -SB http://twiturm.com/subbeat

My husband and I used the topping over six apples, adding some additional cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. The topping wasn't as crumbly as we're used to--going on--but it came out delicious! It was definitely decadent--almost like an oat cookie. We took photos of the process and posted them. http://www.hitherandthither.net/2010/10/at-long-last.html I would definitely make this again!

Absolutely yummy! My husband felt like something sweet after our dinner & Im not the one to turn down a dessert. This receipt was quick & so easy that it was almost unbelievable. It was perfect for a cozy night. Plus its a receipt where chances are youd have all the ingredients at home. I used splenda brown sugar & whole grain flour. For the apples I used 4 very large granny smiths & 1 very large royal gala. It felt like 4 pounds, but next time Im either using more apples or less topping. It didnt feel like an even bite each time. But that is totally preference. And for the other reviews mentioning nutmeg & all spice, Im defiantly going to try that. It makes sense completely. Happy Baking!

Great recipe! The only comment is to reduce the baking time by about 10mins.

Great recipe for a quick, delicious dessert...guests love it--can kick it up a notch with creative ice cream flavors.

WOW!! It's unbelievable. It's the best I've ever had!! Based on the comments from the other chefs, here are the adjustments I made to the recipe: used only 1 stick of butter, added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of allspice. I made the full recipe for the crumble, but only ended up using 2 lbs of apples, and so I just sprinkled enough toppings to cover the apples, so I have lots of crumble left over in the fridge - ready for my next batch!! DELICIOUS!!

Great recipe despite my adding a 1/2 cup extra brown sugar by mistake.

This tasted so good on cool October days. I used about five small Granny Smith apples and a Stamen.

I made this recipe on the fly last night and it was a resounding success. This is very easy and quick to make. The only change I made was that I used Gala apples.

Very tasty. I halved the crumble topping, and only used a 1/2 stick of butter overall, and it was still good. I also added a little bit of ground cloves, allspice and nutmeg.

Loved it. I cut the apples up into smaller pieces (I like my crumbles chunky) and added a bit more cinnamon and it turned out great. It was definitely the best crumble recipe I have ever used.

I slice the apples into 8 per half and I add an extra 1/2tsp cinnamon as well as 1/2tsp nutmeg and ground cloves. I also use 200g butter. Easy, tasty and everyone loves it.

This is a simple and delicious recipe. I used fat free whip cream instead of ice cream and it was a complete hit with everyone in my family. They loved it. Will definitely make over and over again.

great recipe, tried it and got raving reviews. Try two cups of oats instead of the two and a half, works out to be great.

The crumble topping overwhelmed the fruit, both in taste and quantity. It was also too buttery for my liking. I'm going to look for another recipe that is healthier and tastes lighter.

Very very good basic crumble recipe. The tart granny smiths complement the sweet crumble perfectly. And if you like a lot of crumble in your crumble, this is the recipe for you.

The first time I made this dish it came out PERFECT, I made it yesterday and used dark brown sugar instead of golden brown and it made so much difference. It came out a lot more goopy. But with the right sugar the first time this dish was DELICIOUS! And pretty easy. Definitely worth making.

We have been making this crumble for a couple of years now. We love it and my children love putting it all together. I do add a bit more lemon juice and choose to use a variety of apples, though mostly Granny smith.

This recipe was too sweet for my husband and I. I would recommend reducing the amount of sugar in the crumble by half and no need to put any at all on the apples. Add extra lemon juice and a vanilla stick to the apples for extra flavor

I have been looking for a good basic apple crisp or apple crumble recipe for a while. This was superb and won very high praise from everyone who tasted it.

This was very good without being super sweet. The Granny Smith Apples added a nice tartness. Great, quick dessert recipe.

I thought this was fantastic. I added a handful of dried cranberries to the apple mix, and a handful of slivered almonds to the crumble blend. Very good. Not too tart at all - I used Gala apples. Next time I might add a little salt to the crumble blend - it seemed a bit bland. But all in all, delicious! I will definitely make it again.

This was a great recipe and it was quick and easy. I doubled the ingredients. I would suggest adding less butter when you are doubling the recipe. This is not the healthiest dessert but it is surely a good one.

I made this crumble last night and it ws delicious. I actually halved the recipe as I did not want leftovers. Next time I may try using a little less butter to cut down on the fat and calories.

This dish was easy and quick to make, and turned out to be delicious. One tip for other newbie bakers like myself: the "golden brown" sugar for which this recipe calls may be called "golden yellow" in the store. And be sure not to cheap out on the vanilla ice cream -- go for the good stuff.

everytime i make this recipe it goes so quickly - especially if it's still warm and toppings are still crisp! I love this recipe! I do cut down a little on the sugar sometimes (depending who i am making it for) but it makes me look like such a queen when i make it!

Delicious tart! It was very easy to make! I followed the original recipe, on top of that I added some almond flakes into the apple mixture, it turned out great! It is easy and delicious, I will make it again for new year.

One other thing I did was switch Five Alive juice for the lemon juice. It wasn't tart at all - had a nice citrusy taste to it.

Fabulous apple dessert! This is my new favorite for apple-picking season. I used Cinnamon Plus (made by the Pampered Chef) instead of plain cinnamon. It really added to the flavor. Cinnamon Plus has cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ground orange peel, cloves and ginger in it. My kids loved it and I'm planning on making it again as one of my desserts for Thanksgiving.

I substituted granny smith apples for fuji apples, maybe that's where the problem was, coz the filling turned out to be a watery mess. The topping was only so-so, didn't really like the oats. I have made better apple pies/crumbles and don't think i will be making this again.

Yummy. A bit tart so I will add less lemon juice next time.

I tried this recipe last weekend. We loved the crumble topping. It was very tasty and the recipe made lots, wich was great. However, the apple part was simply okay. It didn't have a any wow to it (wasn't very tart, weasn't very sweet). I have tasted other crumbles that have a much better filling. Next time I will try a different recipe for the filling but use this recipe for the great topping.

This is my favorite crumble recipe. Because I didn't have any lemon juice in the house, I used orange juice, as well as a mix of apples. None in my family detected the switch, and I feel it made the dish less tart. Once I mixed the butter too well, and it came out like a brick crust, so make sure to put the top in small "fingerfulls", not big teaspoonfuls.

My favorite bit in this recipe was the fabulous crumble topping! I agree with one of the previous reviewers in that I thought the apples tasted a bit too sour. Next time,I will cut back on the lemon juice or try other apple varieties. Other than that, the recipe was simple, and the results were great.

We cut the recipe in half and used just a couple of tablespoons of organic white sugar instead of brown - the recipe cooks up beautifully and is a real crowd pleaser. Easy on the cook and just great served up with vanilla ice cream.

We really liked this dessert overall, but the apples tasted very sour. Not pleasantly tart, but unpleasantly sour. Is that just the type of apple, or did I use too much lemon juice? If it's the lemon juice, can I omit this ingredient? Any advice is appreciated! I'd like to make this again, but w/o the sourness.

This is a delicious and easy crumble. The only thing I might add next time is a little nutmeg because I love the flavor in apple desserts. But it is great as is!

Very good crumble. I quartered my apples and baked the crumble for 40 min. in my convection oven. Turned out fabulous. I didn't change a thing...followed the recipe exactly.

This apple crisp was fabulous. I found the apples to be a little too firm after 55 min. of baking though, so I'm going to cut them into thinner slices next time. This dessert did not last past two nights. I even had to write a note to tell our family members that it was only for after dinner dessert, not to be eaten as a snack or meal substitute. It was great with either whipped cream or vanilla icecream, and it was much better eaten warm. I'm going to make it again this week.

Wonderful fall dessert! I opted to use an assortment of apples I had on hand - Golden Delicious, Winesap, Gala and MacIntosh. This recipe has a very generous amount of crumble topping. Great!
