I doubled the carrot and used fresh thyme when I prepared this. I also used 1/2 medium yellow onion instead of 1 spanish onion. Adding 6 tbsp of butter before heating the sauce for serving (I made it a few days ahead of time) gave it the most phenomenal silky texture and really boosted the flavor. This is now my favorite chunky tomato sauce. I didn't use SM tomatoes and the flavor was still out of this world.

I read the other reviews in advance and added red wine, italian seasoning and a bit of sugar. This made the difference with the flavor of the sauce.

We thought this sauce was sooo bland and acidic. Yes, I did use the San Marzano canned tomatoes. Followed the recipe to a T, originally. But then added a bit of butter and a few dashes sugar to try to smoothen out the flavor. It worked ok as an ingredient for Mario's osso bucco recipe, but I'd never use this as a pasta sauce on it's own. In fact, I wouldn't use it again for the osso bucco, simply because there's better basic tomato sauce recipes out there. I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but it just wasn't very good. I do not recommend it.

After reading the other comments in the prior reviews. Mario should have specified canned San Marzano DOP (yes, the DOP is very important). This change would have corrected almost all of the critcs.

I used San Marzano tomatoes (first time I've tried them; what a difference!) and added some fresh basil & parsley during the last 10-15 min of cooking. I left the sauce to cook a little longer than called for and still had to puree it a bit to get the right consistency. A good basic sauce with nice flavour, although I might add some red wine next time and maybe some red pepper flakes.

This recipe had me eating the sauce with a spoon. Very easy, very quick, very very wonderful. I added a generous sprinkle of red pepper flakes, a tblsp. of honey and a whole carrot instead of half. Fantastic! Make sure there's enough left over to serve with your meal after "tasting".

This is an excellent sauce, although I did change a few things . . . I added the suggested two tablespoons of unsalted butter - that was a *very* good idea, and definitely made the consistency much smoother. I also ended up running the sauce through a processor at the end of it all (before adding the butter), because I wanted a less chunky sauce for the type of pasta I was using - this still worked very well. Overall, the sauce was great - slightly zesty, slightly sweet, great aroma and texture.

This is a wonderful sauce. I took the advice of the reviewer from Miami, and added 2 Tbsps. butter to my sauce after it came off the heat. It DID make it more velvety! I also added a couple pinches of red pepper flakes early on (I doubled the recipe, thus the TWO good-sized pinches of pepper flakes) and a little dry white wine early on also. I added a couple pinches of sugar as well. The Miami reviewer was also right about something else: this is a BASIC sauce, to which can be added whatever you like. I love this recipe!

In regards to the previous reviews, especialy the gentleman in Nevada. When you get to the point where your sauce has thickened but it is still acidic, try adding unsalted butter, one tablespoon at a time until the sauce has a more rounded out flavor. I myself do not mind the acidity, especially in a dish like Osso Bucco but different palattes have different tastes, I find that the butter works and also gives the sauce a velvety texture. Remember this is just a basic sauce that with the addition of different seasoning (i.e. red pepper flakes make fra diavolo) came make many different sauces.

As an Italian woman who would rather have a good recipe for tomato sauce than a good man (the good man will follow the tomato sauce, my grandmother would tell us), I can tell you that the type of canned tomato you use will most definately affect the outcome of the sauce. Too many commercially known brands are very acidic, to the point that it's no wonder the man from Nevada added sugar. Though adding sugar is a long-standing Italian debate, it becomes personal preference depending on how you were raised. Here in North Carolina, the sauces available on pizza and in restaurants tends to lean towards the sweet and syrupy, not my taste at all. The needed addition of oregano tells me that our Nevada friend may have been comparing Mario's truly Italy inspired sauce to his Americanized cousin (baring little to no resemblence, I might add). Growing up, we had simple sauces, soft vegetables that melted into the pastas and little sweets except at breakfast time or after church. So this sauce would be perfect for me. And a basic tomato sauce is needed more for its addition to other dishes than one that necessarily is needed to stand alone. You wouldn't want the strong flavor of oregano to overpower another dish like Osso Buco for instance, where a good basic tomato sauce is key.

I feel guilty not concuring with the rest of the reviewers...did I do something wrong? I don't know - just seemed extremely acidic (so I added sugar) and kind of bland (threw in some crushed red pepper and hefty helping of oregano. It's passable, but I think there might be better out there.

This is now my base tomato sauce. Simple and versatile... perfect!

This is traditional italian tomato sauce. Very easy. If you can find San Marzano tomatoes which are much better than other canned standards (look in gourmet shops or yuppie markets) it's best- especially in the winter time.

I've made this recipe a number of times, having downloaded it from the foodtv.com website, each time to rave reviews. And oh, by the way, I'm a married man, whose wife is thrilled that I suddenly appear to be able to cook!!

This recipe was very easy and delicious! It makes for more of a zesty tomato sauce, and is a great compliment for baked pasta dishes. I added a little red wine and some crushed red pepper, and everyone loved it. Definitely a keeper.
