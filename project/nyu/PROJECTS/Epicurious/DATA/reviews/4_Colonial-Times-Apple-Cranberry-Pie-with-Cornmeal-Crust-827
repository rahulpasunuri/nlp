I made the crust twice and both times it was terrible. It was heavy and flavorless.

Yummm, this was so good. It looks great also. Everyone completely loved it. I did change it a little. Used mixture of nutmeg, ginger and little cinnamon instead of apple pie spice and extra cranberries instead of currants. Also cut sugar down to 1/2 cup. Cooked it a little longer also, waited until it really bubbled. The inside was spicy and tart and the berry juice soaked into the cornmeal crust in a really good way. Loved it!

I have made this pie since the magazine came to my house years ago. My family and friends rave about it. I don't always make the cornmeal crust - just a regular one and it tastes wonderful too.

This is a great recipe. I think I originally bought the Bon Appetit magazine (and then got a subscription) because this recipe was featured on the front cover(I was just a youngster then). This pie has always been a hit with friends and family. Sometimes I omit the currants, sometimes I add extra cranberries. I haven't made it the past few years since my husband has Celiac Disease, but I'm getting better at making gluten- free pie crusts, so I'm going to give it a try this Thanksgiving. Gluten-free crusts are a little more tedious to deal with since they are stickier and don't hold together well. We'll see how the leaves turn out. Also, I rarely use the buttermilk. Either I omit it or use a beaten egg for color. Still looks beautiful! Also, I usually make it with Granny Smith apples (can't find Pippins)

I usually (but not always) make this pie for Thanksgiving, and I recently used it to win the Faculty/Staff Pi Day Baking Contest at my school. Held on Pi Day, March 14th -- pi = 3.14... get it? I think people were surprised that a male teacher won. Rave reviews all around, especially the crust. It's not my family's favorite, because it's a little dense and they like my other lighter, flakier crust. But I love the cornmeal crust, and I love cutting out all the leaves for the top crust.

Thanks for all the tips- cutting down the sugar and using dried cranberries in place of currents. In addition, may I suggest the following. Recipe works very well in a 10" tart pan. Two cups fresh cranberries and two pounds apples were a good ratio. I used brown and demerara sugars (2/3 cup if you use 2 cups cranberries). And finally, added 2 tablespoons of brandy to the filling. Very pleased with the results and the pie ages well, tasted better the next day.

I love this pie, but I'm only giving it three forks because I've found that some people are strongly averse to it. I suppose it's too much of a deviation from the "all-American apple pie" ideal for some folks. Personally, I think the cornmeal crust is excellent. It adds a little gravity to the dish, and makes it more of what I imagine colonial "dessert" to be - a hearty extension of dinner. Every time I've made it, though, the crust has baked up way to thick for my liking. How thin have you guys been rolling it out? I roll and roll and roll and think it must possibly be thin enough...and then it bakes up all thick again.

This was very good, but too sweet. I cut the sugar in the filling by half, will cut back to 1/2 cup next time, and will also cut the sugar in the crust in half. not as over-the-top-great as i was expecting based on the other reviews, but very good, nice for a change of pace, and presents beautifully.

I make this every Thanksgiving. A terrific, classic pie. The unusual crust works well with other fillings (I sub butter- don't like Crisco-anything). I do find the filling to sweet so I reduce the sugar. Also, for more cranberry flavor I sub dried cranberries for the currants.

Rating: 4
I've already reviewed this but after making the pie each year I've made some more changes. I use less sugar than called for and like it better less sweet. Since I sub dried cranberries for the currants it could be too sweet with the listed sugar amount. Also, this year I used a mix of Braeburns and Granny Smiths. Very good.

This pie has become a Thanksgiving tradition at our house since 1993. I'm not a big fan of pie crust, but I love this one. It has so much more flavor than regular crust and it goes well with the apples and cranberries. It's delicious!

The hardest part about this recipe was waiting one hour for the pie to cool! I have never made a pie crust before and I didn't have any problems with this one. Other reviewers have said that the crust was difficult to work with. I left mine in the refrigerator for over an hour, this may be why it was so easy to work with. I used dried cranberries instead of currants as suggested to control sweetness. This worked like a charm. I had to use 10 Tbl of buttermilk to reach the right consistency for the crust. And the pie wasn't brown enough (though bubbling) after 45 - 35. I uncovered and baked 10 more minutes. Everyone raved about this pie! It's a winner!

I have made this every year since 1993. The do not use a bottom crust -- leaving more room for apples and cranberries. I also add a quarter cup of chopped pecans to the recipe. This pie is fabulous the second or third day, too.

This was a more sophisticated version of a pie that my family has always known as Pilgrim's Pie, as other reviewers have also said. This was delicious, and everyone that tried it loved it and loved how different the crunchy cornmeal crust was.

Loved the crust even though it was difficult to work with. Thought the overall pie (which I made exactly according to recipe, including the rum raisin ice cream) was merely okay. Perhaps it needs a day to mellow? We ate it while still slightly warm. Noticed that a lot of people at the table did not finish their serving and I received merely polite "The pie is good" responses. I probably will try a different recipe next time. Will keep the crust in mind.

This is a favorite at my Thanksgiving table, and at other times. It's always a crowd pleaser. I make it with a pate brisee crust instead of the cornmeal, and I use dried cranberries in place of the currants. The pie has a pretty presentation with the mix of colors, and it's delish!

Made this pie 11 yrs ago for a cousin's party. We are getting together this year for Thanksgiving and she still remembers the pie and begged me to make it again. It is AMAZING!!!

Both my husband and I dislike pie crust however, this one, we LOVE. The apple-cranberry combo is amazing! I used the crust for my pumpkin pie this year and it was fabulous.

Made this last thanksgiving and it was great. I added some extra cranberries because I wanted it to be tart - and it was. Goes really well with the cornmeal crust. I chose this recipe because I was scared to make a real crust and this seemed easier (which it was).

This is a fabulous apple pie. Usually I find them too sweet and bland. This one has texture and layers of flavor.It's also beautiful. I served it warm with rum raisin ice cream as suggested and it could'nt be better.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream. It has a very pretty presentation. I just wasn't sure about the grittiness of the crust.

I brought to a "pot luck" Thanksgiving dinner and it was a definite success! I admit the crowd I was with prefer tart pie fillings. We all thought the crust would be good with a rhubarb filling as well. The crust is a little sticky and difficult to mess with, keep it cold. The suggestion to cut out shapes and arrange over top helps combat this problem, as well as making a lovely presentation. The "grittiness" the cornmeal adds to the crust is wonderful. If you like a tart-ish filling, sturdy nutty pastry, definitely try this.

This pie is great. Particularly if you add a few dried cranberries with the currants.

Giving credit where it's due, my sister made this for Christmas the year it was published, and my kids have never asked for any other pie to be repeated more frequently! It's an annual family tradition now. Surprised to find it referenced under "pumpkin pies", but pleasantly reminded of what treat is in store...thanks little Sis!

This was delicious - and the crust made out of leaf cutouts was absolutely phenomenal. The cornmeal crust is hard to work with, particularly for the bottom crust (which required lots of patching), but it's worth it for the oohs and ahs we got when we served this.

In the middle of nasty Iraq war news all six of us here in London England had reasons to celebrate personal stuff. This absolutely scrummy recipe with its UK/US history was 'ace'. Only problem: there's a fair amount left over which insists on picked at...for breakfast!

We call this "Pilgrim Pie." It is definately different from your regular apple pie. People who appreciate hearty, whole grains seem to like the cornmeal crust and the rustic combination of flavors. Try it - dare to please or not please...

I have made this every Thanksgiving since it appeared in Bon Appetit and it is a favorite. The cornmeal crust is unusual and very tasty and everyone always loves the cranberries. I have always used a combination of cranberries and craisens, possibly helping with the sweetness other reviewers commented on.

One of the best pies for the holidays. The cornmeal crust is perfect.

I found the filling to be pasty--too much flour for my taste. I cut back on the sugar and it was still sweet. There are so many other good recipes that I prefer.

This is one of the best variety-fruit pies I've ever eaten. The first time I made this was for a 4th of July get-together. Star cut-outs were very festive. At that time, I couldn't find fresh cranberries, so I substituted Craisins (dried cranberries) and it was delicious! Definitely a "keeper"

I liked the crust quite a bit, but although I usually like my apple pie on the tart side, found the filling too tart. Next time I'd leave out the cranberries.

Great recipe for a rookie baker, like me. Think the ingredients work really well with the cornmeal crust. Pretty sweet, though. I may cut back some on the sugar next time.

With a few modifications, this pie has been part of our Thanksgiving table for several years now. It always comes out looking great, like a big pile of leafs, and tasting great. I've made it with only Pippins, but I have also used a variety of apples, Pippins, and/or Granny Smiths, Breaburns, Galas, and Fijis. The mixture gives the pie a complex flavor. And generally, I use only a quarter cup of sugar for the apples (my family and friends are not big on overly sweet apple pie). I taste a slice or two before filling the the pastry and adjust accordingly.

I've made this pie for the holidays every year since it came out in the 1993 edition - and love it every time! I've made is just as the recipe describes it, and its perfect! My family and guests always love this pie!

I have got to say that this is the ULTIMATE pie! I used half apple and half pear...yum! and used blueberries instead of cranberries. I'm sure both are great! I love the pie spice in the crust. I also added a little crumble on top made of butter, sugar and flour to add to the cut out leaves. WOW! A real crowd pleaser.

This pie has become one of my favorite recipes over the years. I have made it for several groups with very different tastes and the feedback is always the same -- people love it! The cornmeal crust, for me, is less intimidating than a traditional crust because it is not meant to be flaky, leaving less room for failure. I highly recommend this recipe.

This pie is tangy, but I love it that way. The crust was tasty, but a bit fussy.

Rating: 4
Excellent addition to any menu during the holiday season. I made a few changes, however, to accomodate some personal tasts. I added an additional 3/4 cup of light brown sugar to make the pie sweet and rich rather than slightly tart. I also substituted golden raisins for the currants, and I added a small package of chopped black walnuts which gave some "crunch," as well as additional richness and another flavor. The crust was great -- don't monkey with it, just follow the directions.

So happy to find this recipe again...after having to throw out all my magazines whilst moving! This is the most delicious apple pie I have ever had, and everyone who tried it raved about it. Thank you, Bon Appetit!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving last year w/ my [then] girlfriend's [now fiancee] family. I had to make 4 more for my family's Thanksgiving and 3 brunches. It is excellent. Note: 5 apples appear to be too much for a standard 9" pie dish. It mounds too high. Slice the apples thinner & "chop up" slightly for a denser pie.

Beautiful on the table and tavels well to "pot luck" dinner. I have found that it is best tto make sure the dough is a little stiffer than it comes out in the recipe. Watch the mount of liquids carefully. It is MUCH easier to cut out the leaves for the crust.
