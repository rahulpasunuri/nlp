This was my first try at stuffed grape leaves. I found this recipe rather bland and the rice a little crunchier than I traditionally like it. It may have been the organic type I purchased. I picked and cooked the leaves myself which worked out well. I would definitely make a variation of this recipe at a later date with more herbs/spices and a different rice.

this was a big hit with my guests and myself at dinner last night. followed the tip about the onions on the bottom of the pan, added a little extra water, but cooking time was accurate. this dish is nice for an alternative to a plain side dish. time consuming, but not difficult.

Vry good grape leaf recipe. Only thing is underestimated time to cook grape leaves and amount of liquid needed.

Tip: Layer the bottom of the pan with sliced onions then top with leaves. Onions prevent scorching, don't change the flavor and the onions taste great too. Also, double the amount of pine nuts. Nicely compliments grilled lamb chops!
