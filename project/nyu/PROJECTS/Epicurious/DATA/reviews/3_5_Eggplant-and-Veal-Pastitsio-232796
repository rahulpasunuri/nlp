This is delicious and I can tell you to save dirtying pots by using everything twice. I made the rue in a 4-6 qt pot while eggplant drained in colander in the sink. Put oil in lg baking dish, tossed in drained eggplant to bake. Measured milk into 2 cup pyrex and microwaved, added to rue, then added another cup milk. Put cheese in beaten eggs in large bowl. Added hot rue and whisk. Filled pot back up with water to cook pasta. When pasta done add to rue. When eggplant done, throw in meat (I used pd of ground sirloin.) toss and add pasta mix on top. Used a measuring cup, large bowl, colander, pot and baker dish. Not so bad for a casserole. Yum.

I also used ground beef instead of veal shanks. The sauce was creamy and good, but somehow the flavors of the dish as a whole were missing. Quite bland.

I actually made this a meatless meal. I used extra feta, extra penne noodles, extra garlic and added sun dried tomatoes. It was very good, but took a long time, and it did take lots of pots and pans. If I cook it again, I think I will add artichoke hearts also.

While this dish ULTIMATELY ended up in one pot, it was MANY pots, etc to make!!! I used ground veal/pork/beef instead of veal shank & everyone enjoyed.
