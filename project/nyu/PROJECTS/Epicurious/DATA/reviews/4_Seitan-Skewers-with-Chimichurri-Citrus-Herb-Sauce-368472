Very tasty all around. The citrus sauce was a bit thinner than I expected, but tasted great. Made some grilled asparagus (topped with citrus sauce) and Near East taboule as side dishes.

This is way more delicious than i expected. I cut the sauces in half and used 2 boxes seitan (1lb) and still had a lot extra of the drizzling sauce. I will absolutely make ths again. Very easy and nobody will care it's vegan.. Served with a lentil salad and potato salad.
