Soooo good! I halved the recipe,used an additional slice of bacon, but otherwise followed the given directions. Great compliment to the herb roasted turkey found on this website! It's even delicious cold because of of the rich flavor of the ingredients!

I thought I had already reviewed this recipe but came across it again and noticed I hadn't!! I have been making this since the recipe came out in 1995 along with the fabulous turkey with the sage and bacon under the skin. This recipe for stuffing is divine!!! I have never put any stuffing in my mouth that is this good. Cannot say enough good things about it. The mushrooms, leeks and bacon are heavenly with the sourdough bread. You cannot go wrong with this stuffing. Have made it every year since 1995!!!!

i've been making this since it first appeared in 1995, along with the turkey that uses the bacon and sage. This year my brother and sister-in-law are hosting Thanksgiving, as my niece just had her first child ..... I asked what i should bring ........ their answer? Your stuffing!! As well as the Crostini W/Mushrooms, Prosciutto and Blue Cheese, something me sister-in-law looks forward to each and every year.

I have made this stuffing the last several years and have been consistently happy with the result. Super easy. Always turns out. Bold flavors. Try it!

I have been making this stuffing since it came out in the Novemeber 1995 issue of Bon Appetit. Always a huge hit. One year I tried a different stuffing recipee and everyone was upset that I hadn't made this one! My vegetarian brother in law cheats on his diet once a year...with this stuffing.

Have made this recipe for thanksgiving several years in a row. It always turns out great. All of it gets eaten with no left overs. Have made it without the bacon and it still tastes great!

YUM! There were only two of us so I halved the recipe and it came out great. I didn't trim the crusts because we like the different textures of the bread. I also couldn't find leeks for some strange reason so subbed a mixture of green onions and sweet onion. I didn't want the extra salt from the bacon grease so sauteed the veggies in a little butter. I also omitted the added salt. This is a keeper and my new go-to dressing recipe!

Really easy with few ingredients. I used this to stuff the cider brined turkey on Epicurious. Ample sage and thyme make this recipe so delicious.

I have made this recipe many times over the years as I host Thanksgiving for my family and my husband's. This is always a hit! Like many other reviewers I like to try differenr recipes but this one has become a must make or everyone is disapoointed -they are polite, but always come back to this recipe as their favorite.

There is inly one problem with this recipe. I first made it in 1995 and have not been allowed to make any other recipe since. As a chef, 15 years making the same recipe can get a little boring but you DO have to keep the family happy! Just remember, if you try this recipe, you'll be making it for the rest of your life.

Made it years ago, still remembered by some guests today. Found again this year, and planning to make it. Agree with many comments about the way you mix it/spice choice bringing different flavours to the fore. I think that's one interesting element of Thanksgiving or a turkey dinner in general: stuffing may not be exactly as remembered, but seems to always be delicious!

Wonderful recipe. Smells like Christmas, and how my Dad used to make it with bacon, celery and sage. I didn't have any sourdough bread so I just used a whole loaf of white Wonder bread, cut into small cubes and toasted in the oven for 10 minutes (stirring once after 6 minutes). I've made it twice with success.

I have made this stuffing every year since it was first published. Very popular with all our guests!

This is by far my favorite stuffing recipe. I've been making it for years, over the years I've only made minor variations: 1/2 fresh herbs 1/2 dried. I use turkey stock and I use sourdough and a brown bread for color. This is wonderful as written as well. You won't go back to seasoned bread crumbs.

I went looking for a traditional stuffing recipe and stumbled upon this one. I used both pumpernickel and country french bread for color variation, button and portobella mushrooms, finely diced fresh herbs, and extra turkey stock. My guests were very pleased with the results, and my house smelled amazing! I will certainly make this one again next year!!

This was my second year to make this stuffing. Last year I took it to our office pot luck Thanksgiving lunch. Rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. I made it again the same year for a family Thanksgiving dinner - same result. This year I wasn't going to be at work for the Thanksgiving lunch but got so many requests to "please make it anyway" that I made a special trip in with a batch. Now I have to give all the new staff a copy of the recipe. This recipe has wonderful flavor and perfect texture every time. I don't think I'll get away with making any other stuffing from now on.

Very nice dressing recipe. Also can be a wonderful side dish when not serving turkey. Traditional but yet "not your mom's stuffing".

I've made this dressing the last 5 years for Thanksgiving. Everyone loves it!!! It's so chunky and has loads of flavor. I've also made the turkey with sage butter that goes with this dressing. They are both superb!

This recipe was fantastic! My first thanksgiving and there wasn't any stuffing left!

I make this with the bacon sage turkey recipe that originaly came in my paper copy of Bon Apetite. I get requests every year to make it again. The one year I did not cook my own I made it just because I missed it. The recipe changes a lot if you make it "chunky" or "smooth". The finer you dice your ingredients the mellower the flavor. Suit yourself.

Great! We have used this stuffing for the last two years at Thanksgiving and Christmas. I appreciate not having to dig stuffing out of a bird, and it's been a knockout for flavour. It does seem that each time I make it, a different flavour comes to the fore. Once it was bacon, once it was thyme, once it was chicken - it's all in the mix.

I have to say I was disappointed in this recipe, which surprised me because I adore bacon and mushrooms. There were too many 'moist' ingredients relative to the bread. Thus, it was "too wet" and had too intense a flavor, which did not marry well with the turkey. (If you are going to make this, I would double the quantity of bread). If you haven't tried the Chestnut Stuffing on this site, I would highly recommend it!

Very tasty, and comes together very nicely if you make it a day ahead.

Fantastic. This was a big hit at my Thanksgiving. I used sliced portabellas and oyster mushrooms, and it was divine. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. I loved it, and am going to go dig into my leftovers before it's gone!!

Pretty good! I think next time, though, I might cut down on the herbs, add more bacon and chop the mushrooms up smaller.

We love this stuffing! I have been making it every year since it was published. People who have tried it at my thanksgiving table have passed it on to their families. This can be a very herby dressing (depending on the quality of your spices)so make sure you taste as you go. Also, use a commercial grade sourdough bread. One year I made it with bread from a bakery known for its' sourdough and the stuffing came out very puckery. Enjoy!

This stuffing was delicious!! I doubled the herbs and made the entire dish the day ahead, then re-warmed in a low even prior to serving (added a little chicken broth before re-heating). All the family and our guests raved about it! And it was easy to prepare, as well! This is definitely a keeper.

I love this stuffing, but just made it for my family for the first time. It got rave reviews and several requests for the recipe. I think it just became a tradition! I add 1 1/2 cup of unsalted roasted pecans, and substitute fresh herbs for the dried. I find fresh sage gives folks less indigestion problems than dried sage. I use 3 T sage and 1 1/2 T thyme. It is an awesome stuffing!

Rating: 4
This was a really great recipe. I made it the day before and added the eggs just before I cooked it. I had to double the recipe so I ended up microwaving over half of the bacon and frying just enough to get the drippings. I also used onions instead of leeks, and finely chopped the mushrooms in the cuisinart - this way the kids coudn't pick them out. Very delicious!!

I've made this recipe for so many people who swear they don't like bread stuffing. They all come back for seconds! It's a new tradition at our home for the Holiday's.

We have made this dressing recipe for 4 years. Everyone demands this dish whether we host the dinner or not! The people who said it was dry, didn't follow the recipe correctly and the people who said it had no flavor--or too much flavor, well, I just can't figure out what they did wrong. Anyway, it seems that the majority of reviewers love this recipe as much as our family does.

I have made this recipe for Thanksgiving two years in a row and everyone loves it! I use a variety of mushrooms such as crimini, shiitake, and portabella. I also use low salt broth and bacon. This recipe is just delicious!

Had this for the family at Thanksgiving and everyone had 2nds. It was scrumptious. Prepared it a day ahead as suggested. It did need some more broth the next day but turned out moist and the flavors were well balanced.

Tried this for Thanksgiving. It came out dry and for some reason very salty. And we didn't even add any salt. Maybe it was the bacon.

I really liked this stuffing - it was different than the traditional stuffing usually served at my table. A nice change.

Rating: 1
I agree with the cook from Philadelphia - this was bland and DRY. The recipe didn't specify to bake covered or uncovered, but since it's supposed to get brown on top, I assumed uncovered. That was mistake #1. Second mistake was adding the eggs. I don't know what purpose they serve other than unwanted cholesterol, which we're getting enough of from the bacon.

I've been making this recipe since 1995. It's great because you can substitute the bacon for Italian sausage, chicken apple sausage (add oil when sauteing) and turkey bacon!!!

This recipe is the most flavorful and complementary stuffings that I have ever made. Turkey bacon, baked instead of frying, works very well. This is definitely gourmet. This stuffing was almost the main dish for Thanksgiving dinner.

There were 4 of us and we ate more than half of the stuffing. This recipe is a keeper. I also cut down on the added salt and it was delicious.

This was excellent. Easy to make and delicious. I accidently omitted the 1/4 cup of bacon dripping sas I did some of the prep work ahead of time. Due to reader reviews that recipe could be salty, I also left out 1 reaspoon of salt it calls for. Personally, I think the bacon drippings are the saltiness culprit. I sauted celery and leeks with olive oil and a 1 tablespoon of butter and it came out great. Lots of bacon flavor - but not too salty at all!!

As my our family has spread, I only have about 4 people for Thanksgiving. This recipe is so good, that even with a "serves 12", I still don't have any leftovers. I suggest if you are feeding a crowd, you might want to double this one... it's a keeper!

I completely agree with the comments about "Mom's" stuffing, my parents are British and SOOOOOOOO picky and said this was bar none the very best stuffing they had ever tasted, can't wait to make it for Xmas dinner!!!

This is a must try! There are never leftovers! If you are going to make a feast, the ROAST TURKEY WITH SAGE BUTTER recipe that was published with it is excellent and they make a great combination. I have made them every year since 1995 and am always asked to make them again. Do use LOW SALT broth!

This was a big hit at our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner. My Mother's stuffing is excellent but when there's a crowd you alway need extra. She couldn't believe that stuffing outside of a bird would be so good. Make sure you use low-salt broth and I would even say low-salt bacon. I didn't and it was almost too salty. Almost. There were no leftovers.

This was an excellant stuffing. We made it back in 1996 from a recipe given to us. We lost the recipe and have tried to make it from memory but it was never the same. Glad we found it again and it won't be lost again..

My mother is a great fan of bread stuffing but I have always found that bread stuffings don't have as much flavor as other types of stuffing. This recipe convinced me that bread stuffings can be very flavorful. It was also great that I could prepare it a day ahead for last minute stuffing.
