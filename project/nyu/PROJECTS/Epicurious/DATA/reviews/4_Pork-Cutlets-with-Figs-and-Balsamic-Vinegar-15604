Our grocery didn't have figs the day we made this so we used dates and it was delicious! We didn't use the parsley and it was fine without the garnish :) It made a lot of sauce which I feel most recipes always skimp on. So this was a perfect recipe!

I made this with pork tenderloin instead (searing it on the stove top) and then slicing it down. The sauce was delicious. I've made this twice now and both times it's been excellent.

This pork was "restaurant quality" as my husband will say when I make a dish that is worthy of a restaurant. (Note: not that many!). I used pork tenderloin from the supermarket. Cut it in half so I had 2 halves. Seared it on all sides about 20 minutes total. Put in meat thermometer to get it to 140 degrees and let it rest for 5 minutes. Absolutely delicious! Not too sweet, just right. This recipe is a keeper!

This is quite good. We had it with corn on the cob and grilled pineapple on the side. (thought that would be a disaster, but it worked.) I used 1/2 and 1/2, but next time I will try the cream. I also added about a tablespoon of blackberry jelly which was a good addition!

I don't understand what everyone is raving about here. This was okay, but not spectacular. I had to add honey to sweeten the sauce. Ignore the suggestions to soak dried figs in the chicken stock--they just absorb all the salty flavor and their sweetness and fig-ness is usurped by the stock.

Rating: 4
This recipe was SO. FREAKING. GOOD., especially considering how easy it is to make and how common the ingredients are. The figs and balsamic vinegar go marvelously together, and really create a smoky, complex flavor that complements the pork nicely. I only made one change: I couldn't find fresh figs, so I used dried. I soaked them in the chicken broth for a couple minutes, and just added them with the broth.

The sauce made my paper-dry pork edible. Delicious dish. Watch your pork--that's a tricky meat to cook just right.

I used cutlets, NOT tenderloin. Did not have issue with being over done. In fact I had to raise the temp of the oven to make sure they were done. Used dried figs soaked in the heated chicken broth. But otherwise followed exactly. The sauce is divine. Would definitely double it next time.

This was a delicious recipe. I was looking for a way to use figs and whipping cream and voila. I used thicker pork loin slices which required more cook time but no problem there. The sauce is incredible though. You could use it on other meats and on pastas. Husband wished I had cut the figs into smaller pieces but delightful.

This recipe is a-maz-ing! I doubled the fruit, using both figs and apples. To my surprise, I preferred the apples. Hubby however was all about the figs. Neither of us could get enough of that fabulous sauce. I used tenderloin cut into 4 segments, on a sharp angle, across the grain I cooked it to medium then set aside while I finished the sauce. I then added the meat back to the pan, and finished it to med-well. Served with roasted sweet potatoes and spaghetti squash - it was crazy good! Would also be excellent with pears, dried apricots, raisins, prunes, dried cranberries, etc.

oh my this is so delicious... i'm not a creamy sauce fan but this is the exception. i used a pork tenderloin and barly browned it, keep warm under foil and then put in a 200 degree oven just before adding it back in the sauce so it wasn't overcooked and dried out. used raspberry balsamic and alittle half and half to lighten. oh so so good. would be good with lamb or chicken and maybe pears or apples when figs aren't around.

The first time that I made this dish the pork was overcooked, but we still thought that it was absolutely incredible. We ate it with Near East brand long grain and wild rice, and the two things together made some kind of crazy magical alchemy. I would highly suggest the combination. The second time, I tried to substitute pears, but it didn't really work. Next time, if fresh figs aren't available, I'll use dried. There's something about the balsalmic and figs together that makes music in my mouth. The second time around I seared both sides of the pork and then set them aside. When the sauce was ready, I just threw the cutlets in there in order to re-warm them. They were a lot more tender and less dry this way. I think that you need to try this recipe. Now.

Loved the flavors but found the sauce a little on the sweet side.

I followed this recipe for the sauce - not the pork preparation. The pork part sounded too ready to dry out! I used thick and juicy pork loin cops that I pan seared, and then followed the rest of the recipe. Very YUMMY! Was a big hit at my dinner party! I served it alongside roasted green beans/mushrooms and cous cous (which was great to sop up the sauce)

My roommate made this for me and I practically licked the plate! Soooooo good. She topped it with a very light tasting blue or roquefort cheese and served with greenbeans. I've now added it to my recipe box! Make extra sauce!

I've made this dish several times, and each time it has been a big hit with friends. I suggest doubling the amount of sauce so there's plenty to go around. After all, that's the best part!

Add a T. of fresh chopped rosemary, it relaly makes it pop. I used half and half b/c I lacked cream, and it still came out with a nice consistency. Served with a nice Pinot Noir and rice pilaf. Great Dish!!!

This was a nice way to use fresh figs. I made extra sauce and served over egg noodles. That made it really seem like a stroganoff with figs substituted for mushrooms.

The sauce was good, the pork tasted like a shoe. I used tenderloin instead of cutlets, and the pork got WAY dried out. One of the reviewers below said to sear it for 4 - 5 minutes on each side, which is way too long. Next time I'll use the cutlets, or if I attempt the loin again, I'll keep it on for much less time. I also did not have figs (not in season at the moment) and used fuji apples instead. LOVED the combination, but then I'm a big pork chops and apple sauce kind of a girl, and this is a much more sophisticated version, but still call on the same combination of flavors. Can't wait to try it again.

I was a little hesitant to make this dish, I wasn't quite sure how well the ingredients would meld together; however, I made it because of the positive feedback it received. I was not disappointed. This is quite nice. My husband raved about it. I made it as directed with the exception of tenderloin (cut in medallions) instead of loin chops.

Rating: 4
This is VERY good. The combination of the sweet figs and the tart balsamic make for an amazing flavor combination. I was looking for something savory to do with fresh figs and this really fit the bill. Served with garlic mashed red potatoes and sauted spinach. Rave reviews from all including a picky teenager.

I made this dish for the first time when company was coming over. (Usually I reserve first time tries for the family) I had nothing short of RAVE REVIEWS. It was superb. I used a pork sirloin cut and pounded it like a schnitzel, the sauce was to die for. Absolutely superb! It's a 10!

What a great dish! I had some dried figs in the cabinet, so I heated the broth in the microwave to almost boiling and let the dried figs sit for an hour or so. To those cooks who didn't add cream, you missed something. The richness and nice feel of the cream was great against the leanness of the pork. I also dusted the cutlets with flour to create a bit of fond in the pan.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I made this once with the figs and loved it, but the next time I went to make it, I couldn't find fresh figs anywhere. So, I substituted sliced fresh apples in place of the figs and it was wonderful as well. The timing on cooking the pork shown the recipe was perfect. Will definitely make it again - with figs or apples!

I took lindaeee from CA tip and used a pork tenderloin instead of cutlets. However, I found I needed to cook the tenderloin about 20 min. and then made the sauce. It was great. As a suburban Phila. brat who only ate Fig Newtons, as opposed to my Italian-city bred husband who as a child stole figs from neighbors' trees, I was delighted with the sweet/tang of the combination of figs and balsamic vinegar. Will make for company next time.

This recipe was great. I tasted the sauce right before I would have added the cream and determined that cream was completely unneccessary. The sauce was excellent without it, and I think cream would have taken away from the taste. I did have more figs than the recipe called for and added more chicken broth so that I could reduce it more. That made for a much richer sauce.

Rating: 4
I didn't have the cream so I used 1/4 cup of non dairy creamer and it worked out just fine. Also added some corn starch to thicken it up a bit. Definitely suggest that you double the sauce.

Rating: 2
This sauce is really nice, but I don't think the recipe is well written. I made the pork before making the sauce and put it in an oven as descirbed but by the time the sauce was finished reducing, the pork was dry. And there is nothing worse than dry pork! If I made this again, I'd start the sauce first.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. I have made it many times using dried figs instead of fresh (adding them with the chicken broth instead of with the cream), and with fresh pears. Excellent both times. I have also made it with onions instead of shallots and it was also good. And I always make it with milk and/or half and half instead of heavy cream (depending on my mood, and what I have in the fridge), and it works well either way.

4 forks because I'm a beginner cook and manage to mangle most recipes. This was a breeze, delicious and very forgiving (I screwed up a couple of things). Great weeknight dish, and definitely double the sauce. Made it with basic polenta and sauteed spinach with shallots. Will try with tenderloin next time, like the previous reviewer.

I made this recipe with a pork tenderloin instead of cutlets and it was AWESOME. Sear the tenderloin 5 min./side in butter/oil, then add vinegar & cook a bit, then broth. Cover and cook on low 10-12 min. until done to your liking. Take the tenderloin out and keep warm while you finish the sauce. I didn't have any shallots but I thought it was just fine without them. I also used twice the amount of figs. Next time I will TRIPLE the sauce as it's so delicious and you can't have too much.

We have a huge fig tree in our yard, and we've been making this recipe for 3 years now. We love it everytime. We keep figs in our freezer so we can enjoy this recipe long after fig season is over. We double the amount of figs the recipe calls for.

I have a fig bush in my front yard so I thought I would try dishes with figs. Due to a miss communication (what a shock) I did not realize my main squeeze prefered figs in Newtons only. Being the good sport he is, he tried the dish. He ended up eating every fig on his plate and those I could not finish. The figs offer a sublte sweetness. Give it a try. I will be getting requests from him for this one. It is a definite "do over!"

I would love to review this recipe, but I have to ask a question before I actually make it. Is this a really sweet sauce? My husband has this problem with mixing sweet and savory-- I don't know why-- he is really missing out on some delicious dishes. Anyway, I wonder if this sauce is similar to a sauce made with jam or jelly b/c I KNOW he wouldn't like that. Please post a reply, if you have made the dish and can offer me a few words of encouragement. It looks so wonderful...I really want to make it. Thank you...

What a great recipe. Often I find sauces not worth the trouble, but this one is wonderful! I substituted onions for shallots, ripe peeled pear for figs, 1/2 and 1/2 for cream and added a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken it. I would suggest 90 sec/side for the cutlets stovetop because the sauce takes a full 15 min and they finish cooking in the oven. Mmmm we'll do it again!

I've made this twice now, once with pork cutlets and once with a large (3lb) center-cut loin roast. Both times got rave reviews. And very easy. For the roast, I first seared it in the roasting pan on all sides over very high heat, then roasted it at 350 on a rack. I took it out and then made the sauce using the pan drippings. Served with asparagus and mushroom risotto and sauteed spinach for a client dinner with rave reviews.

We are lucky enough to have our own Mission Fig tree that produces more figs than we can possibly eat! So, I am always on the lookout for fig receipes and this is a real keeper. Have served it several times for company and got rave reviews. I use a boneless pork loin chop instead of the cutlets.

Rating: 3
The balance of flavors in the sauce was excellent. Do not cook pork for any longer than 2 min/side - it'll finish in the oven, even at such a low temp. I found the sauce to be rather thin, so a cornstarch slurry isn't a bad idea. Even though it took 30 minutes to make, my boyfriend gobbled up his whole plate in less than 5 minutes.

This is a delicious dish. I used dried figs which I soaked for an hour in the cup of chicken broth called for in the recipe. I think it intensified the fig taste. Next time I think I'll puree the sauce with a stick blender. Very nice dish!

Fantastic! Certainly a meal to share with guests; my husband actually raved (a great departure from the usual nod). I used chicken breasts instead of pork; they continued to cook through after browning (in a 350 oven) while I made the sauce. This recipe goes on the 'entertaining list'.

I agree with the previous cook, this is definitely a dish that would be served at a first class restaurant.
