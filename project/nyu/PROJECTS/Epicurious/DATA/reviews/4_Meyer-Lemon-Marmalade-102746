I made this with limes(Bearss; I think Key Limes would work well, too)); absolutely marvelous, and as simple as it sounds; you do need a very sharp knife. I presume that the seeds in the recipe are to add pectin, but the seedless limes set up fine- I cooked it to 220 degrees.

My first time canning and my first marmalade -- an adventurous night! This appears to be a fool-proof recipe for bliss in a jar. Meyer lemons are equal to being showcased with nothing to hide behind. Some of the mix that I dripped has already gelled at room temperature, what I sampled tasted fantastic, and I just heard the final *pop!* from the canning lids in the kitchen. My only challenge: trying to get all of the seeds out. Every time I thought I was done, I discovered more. I finally left a saucer by the stove to collect them to save some work. In the last boiling stage, it may help to think of it as boiling the lemon off the zest. Once that happens, you're very nearly done. I look forward to giving these as gifts!

I plan to make this whenever I can find Meyer lemons - it is definitely on my list of staples. Costco had some in large packages at a reasonable price last week. I have been canning fruit preserves quite a bit in the past 2 years, but I have never tried a marmalade before. In fact I don't really like marmalade, but I adore this one. I've been eating it out of the jar ever since I made it and have it with some home made bread today. We served it with roasted chicken as a condiment (we tried basting the chicken with the marmalade while it roasted, but there wasn't enough flavor). Our guests loved the marmalade alongside the chicken and passed jar several times around the table. It would probably be very good as a glaze for salmon. I decided to dispense with using the seeds and used a low sugar pectin that I buy from Whole Foods. This pectin allowed me to reduce the sugar to my taste. The marmalade was slightly bitter, as expected. I'm inclined to try removing the outer peel with a vegetable peeler and then peel the lemon and discard the white stuff, but this might be more effort than it is worth ...

To all those commenting on the bitter nature of the recipe: Please try blanching and rinsing the sliced lemon peels three times (fresh cool water for each blanch) before continuing with the recipe. This should eliminate the bitterness while leaving the bright notes of the zest. Good luck!

My recipe also turned out really bitter. I have cooked 1/3 and now have more batches of soaked lemons sitting in my fridge. (Was planning on a big recipe for the holidays). Anyone have any thoughts about how to mitigate the bitter?

OK I tried it, don't double the recipe. It darkens and loses some brightness in the process. Likely because it's cooked longer. Still haven't tried the vanilla bean addition.

Rating: 4
Excellent, perfect blend of tangy and sweet. I'll try doubling the recipe next time though. It's a small enough batch I'm hoping that it will still work. Set perfectly. I'm also planning to try adding the vanilla bean.

I've made marmalade a few times now, always works great at these ratios. My only addition is Vanila Bean! Nothing wrong with a little extra love in anything, and the bean itself looks amazing in a pretty little jar of marmalade....

Yeah, this works. It is a low risk recipe. I had never made marmalade before and this was easy - time consuming but that's how it goes with preserves. I didn't use Meyers lemons because I had a plethora of the garden variety of lemon. I used the seeds and then tested if it was set using a chilled plate. It all worked out. If anything my marmalade is just a touch too gelatinous for my tastes, but it tastes great. I looked at loads of recipes on the web for lemon marmalade and this seemed the easiest and least fussy. And it tastes awesome (but how can you go wrong with lemons and sugar?).

I love marmalades and Meyer lemons are abundant around here, so I was really looking forward to making this. What a disappointment, as mine turned out really bitter - to the point where it leaves a horrible taste in my mouth after just a little taste. I followed the recipe exactly, except I took the seed bag out before cooking. Is this how its supposed to taste? Did I do something wrong? I guess I was expecting something sweeter.

truly wonderful flavor!

Whoa! This is delicious and easy! I didn't have Meyer lemons, just standard lemons. Did not use the seeds. Sliced the lemons on a mandolin and then cut the slices into quarters. Cooked the marmalade to 212 degrees as others suggested. It jelled beautifully. I might try it with limes next.

Mmmm, this is sooo good, I'm eating it out of the jar still warm. Ok, I know that this is bad because you're not supposed to change recipes for canning, but I made one very big change ONLY because I try not to cook using sugar. So, instead, I used some local orange blossom honey. I was a little afraid it wouldn't gel properly, but I almost feel like I let it cook a little too long and it gelled too much! But it's really delicious. I don't find the honey flavor overwhelms the delicate meyer lemon at all, but instead adds to the nice floral note. I made a half batch because I wasn't sure if the honey would work, and I used only 1 1/2 C water to compensate for the liquid in the honey and 1 1/2 C honey because it's usually sweeter than sugar, which I might reduce the honey just a little next time because it was a tad sweet. But still amazing! I'm curious to make lavender meyer lemon marmalade and ginger orange marmalade next time!

This was easy to make it it turned out great! I did not save or use the lemon seeds at all and it still jelled nicely!

Excellent recipe. I make it every year and it is foolproof. I also can it so we enjoy it all year. An earlier reviewer said it comes out amber and only 4 jars --- that means it is overcooked. It's still usable but the delicate taste is lost.

To Psandra: yes 4 cups of water is correct. Later when you add 4 cups of sugar you will have about 8 cups of mixture that you cook down to 4 cups.

I need help - do you add only 4 cups of water for lemons to sit in overnight? Then it said to boil down to 4 cups. Is this correct? thanks! Was confused because needed such a large pot.

Remove bag of seeds after simmering about 20 minutes, definately BEFORE adding sugar. A supurb marmalade. A great use for Mener lemons.

I've made this recipe each season for years, but have altered it quite a bit. My experience has been quite different than other reviewers! The lemon seeds are unnecessary; Meyer lemons have plenty of pectin. I use 1 3/4# lemons and 3 3/4 cups sugar as I like a more bitter marmalade. Reduce to 5 cups instead of 4, and after adding sugar boil just to 212 degrees. That's a more precise way to test for doneness (it will NOT test done by the saucer test). This results in a soft, not stiff, marmalade which I like. People that receive this as gifts alway love it!

We have a bounty of Meyer Lemons this year so I tried this and it worked great as instructed. The final stage timing can vary depending on many variables but I found the cold plate test a good guide.

Starting with 1-1/2 lb Meyer lemons, I made lemoncello with the peels and froze the rest. After straining the peels from the lemoncello, I used them and the thawed lemons to make this marmalade. I also substituted 1/2 c honey for 1/2 c sugar. The Meyer lemons, the hint of vodka from the lemoncello and the honey - EXCELLENT!

Wonderful straightfoward recipe for a perfect light fragrant marmalade. Delighted with this success, I then went on to make blood orange marmalde using the directions in this recipe. Color was sublime, but the taste was not quite so dramatic as my meyer lemon marmalade. Try it! Try both!

Rating: 4
This is a good marmalade to double or triple. To make it thicker I put less than double/triple water in. I also like a less sugary marmalade so I added the sugar (also less than double/triple) a cup or two at a time until it was the thickness I wanted. It takes longer to cook but it is worth it!

This is the first marmalade I've ever made and it is excellent. I gave a jar to a friend and she liked using it on chicken and meat. I like it on homemade biscuits :-P

I've had mixed luck at marmalades before, so I was happy when this recipe worked out for me. I left the pits tied in cheesecloth until it started to boil, then removed them. I used a bit less sugar than the recipe calls for (about 1/8 to 1/4 C less) and ended up with 4.75 half pint jars when it was all said and done.

This was my first attempt at making marmalade and it came out great! The only thing in the recipe that was not clear was when to remove the seeds from the mixture, so I took them out after 24 hours but before boiling down the water and lemons. The one snag I had was that marmalade didn't gel after 15 or 20 minutes, but after consulting the Joy of Cooking and following their advice to bring the mixture up to about 222 degrees that did the trick. I got also got only 5 half-pints of marmalade but will definitely make this again!

Fantastically delicious! Some neighbors brought a bunch of Meyer lemons to my New Year's Day party from their bountiful tree. Found this recipe here and decided to try it out. I was nervous at first as I got an odd smell coming from the pot when I started to cook it. I think it was the pith cooking down. I kept going and ended up with the most delicious marmalade I've ever tasted. I can't wait to glaze it on a ham with brown sugar and Dijon mustard! Or to slather it on chocolate chip scones. I've got a pot of Bearss limes in the kitchen right now and am going to try the recipe using them tomorrow.

What a super recipe. The only change I made was adding 1/4 C brandy and cooking the marmalade to 220 F. Because I was pretty thorough with getting rid of scum and foam, this marmalade turned out to be crystal clear. The pits works at jelling. Can't wait to make more.

My third time. 2 successes out of 3 attempts. The failure was mine: I did not think it was going to gel so I added more sugar and ended up with, well, meyer lemon hard candy, which went into a stunning Meyer lemon liqueur (just add vodka and keep guests under control if you want leftovers). I've done a lot of different things with these exquisite lemons, and marmalade is such a good way to use them!

This is a great recipe and quite easy too. I ended up having to boil it a bit longer after adding the sugar in order to get it to gel (maybe my heat wasn't "moderate" enough to begin with or the fact that I reduced the measure on the sugar a bit). It came out perfectly delicious! I am going to try this in a triple citrus marmelade with lemon, grapefruit and orange. Yum!

I thought this was very easy and turned out beautifully, just following the directions. The color is gorgeous! I did not preserve the marmalade, just put it in jars and refrigerated. I'll give most of it away as a gift to friends, so it does not need to keep a long time. The perfume of the Meyer lemons is almost floral, with a lightly sweet and mildly bitter flavor -- quite a nice change from ordinary jam. I'm excited to try it on fresh scones at breakfast tomorrow!

This was fun! I was worried that my little wedge shaped lemon slices would be too big and chunky in the finished product, but the pith mostly cooks down and off--it was fine. I cooked this to 220 using my instant read thermometer, and it has plenty of gel. Is there any way to get fewer of those tiny bubbles in the gel part of the marmalade? Experienced canners--am I stirring too much? This stuff is delish. I can't wait to get a loaf of peasant bread and some butter and go crazy.

Yes this is good, and worth the minimal effort. Stir frequently so that the rind doesn't carmellize and turn dark. If you use a candy thermomenter, cook to 225 degrees and pour into jars. It will gel.

Love this recipe. Made it exactly per the recipe, and it turned out just great...citrus tangy and sweet. Will be a perfect accompaniment to homemade biscuits or an English muffin. I ended up with 5 half pint jars (Weck variety) rather than the 6 suggested in the recipe, but I'm not complaining. It is delicious.

I used Meyer lemons from my tree, and the end result tasted delicious. The pits are evidently used for the pectin, which helps it to gel. I put the pits into a tied cheesecloth bag, but found that the pits came out of the open weave cheesecloth and wound up in with the lemons. The next time I made this recipe I put the pits into a large sized metal tea ball and it worked out perfectly. The other problem I had the first time was that the recipe wound up being a bit too thick. I also made this dish using Splendor instead of sugar (my husband is Diabetic), and I used a sugar-free jam pectic powder. My husband absolutely raved about how delicious it was! I've since made more for him. Good recipe!

OMG. I HATED making this. Not because of the recipe, but of my impatience. I had a lot of trouble in stage two getting the syrupy stuff up to temperature, even after 60 minutes on mod-low heat. I lowered the heat because I started to scorch, and I hung it up right there. I continued to jar, but now I have no idea if it is even going to gel. UGH to marmalade!

made for Christmas neighbor gifts - came out wonderfully - made 3 batches at once (typically not possible with jams)and it worked beautifully - just took longer on second stage - 60minutes not 15.

This was my first attempt at jam-making...what a success. The recipe was easy to follow although I did end up cooking longer at both stages. Be sure to add sugar slowly, otherwise it clumps and takes a long time and much stirring to smooth out. Next time I will stir more frequently to avoid any scorching.

I found the marmalade to be extremely bitter. I did purchase Meyer lemons. Perhaps the pith was too thick. The gel set up nicely though, but I cannot eat tolerate the bitterness. I wonder if the lemons I purchased were really Meyer.

If you like lemon marmalade in general, you'll enjoy this recipe. However, the Meyer lemons do taste distinctly different from standard supermarket lemons. I followed the Joy of Cooking guideline for forming a satisfactory jell - I cooked the mixture until it reached 8 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the boiling point of water in my locality. This took at least 75 minutes (not 15) and resulted in 4 (not 6) half-pint jars of orange-brown (not yellow) marmalade. Don't try to hurry the process by increasing the heat - the mixture may scorch on the bottom of the pan. As an aside, I observed that stirring the mixture caused the temperature to drop a few degrees; this might delay achievement of the jell stage as you approach the critical temperature.

I believe that the addition of the seeds assists with the "gel" through a utilization of the natural pectin contained in them.

Rating: 4
This recipe was easy to follow and the marmalade came out great. We made two batches and the second batch came out better because we used a candy thermometer to decide when to remove the marmalade from the stove. 220 degrees seemed to work best. Also, don't forget to remove the bag of seeds before adding the sugar! I don't know what the seeds are for, maybe flavoring? This marmalade makes an excellent and pretty gift. We used homegrown Meyer lemons! A novelty in our area!

This was a wonderfully delicious and simple recipe. I soaked the lemons for a day and a half because of time scheduling and followed the directions precisely. Boiling it to the gel point took longer than I anticipated, but the end product was well worth it, and so pretty! Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 3
Good recipe. Be careful to reduce to liquid down to the required amount. Failure to do so will result in a marmalade that does not set. Also, it is better to soak the lemons longer than 24 hrs. Turn the lemon peels over half way through the soaking time to evenly soak the peels. Definitely keep it covered when soaking peels.

This is a lovely recipe. With refined sugar it is a bright yellow, picture pretty. Using organic sugar, it is still great, but more of an amber color. Flavorful either way. Lazy cooks: After you have removed all the pits and saved them, instead of slicing the lemons, you can throw them in a Cuisinart with the metal blade and chop them fine. It still tastes great, just a slightly less classic look.
