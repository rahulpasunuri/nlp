left one, very key, thing out..with about 6 minutes left to go i pulled out meatloaf, put thin layer of tomato sauce and left over onions then patted a layer of panko flakes over entire loaf. put back into oven for 3 min and then under the broiler for the last 2-3 minutes and it made a delicious crunchy top!

SO GOOD and SO EASY! Followed recipe for the most part...changed a few things so i didnt have to go to the store! Instead of raw bell peppers i used fire roasted in the jar, 4 garlic cloves, and breadcrumbs instead of crackers and 1 whole carrot finely chopped. TURNED OUT FANTASTIC! Got thumbs up from everyone! will be a staple in my recipe book!

Recipe was tasty, but a bit greaser than my normally meat loaf.

This meatloaf is delicious. I used spicy breakfast sausage and it really added something to a dish that can sometimes be kind of "same ole, same ole." The recipe does make more than can fit in my 9x5 pan, so I made an additional loaf in a corningware dish. The husband has requested this meatloaf make it to our usual rotation. Don't mind if I do...

This recipe was good, but the chopped green peppers gave it a taste that threw me off a bit. I am used to tasting cooked green peppers only in Chinese food or on pizza. To taste them in meatloaf was a bit distracting.

This was surprisingly good. Very juicy. I used fresh Mediterranean pork sausages. Following the recipe's proportions resulted in a volume that didn't quite fit in a 9x5x3 pan, so you may want to consider something just slightly larger.

This is much like my "old family recipe" for meatloaf, with a few changes. I use 2 lbs extra lean (90%)ground beef, 1 lb roll of sausage, diced tomatoes instead of sauce, no eggs, basil instead of sage, and about 1 cup of oatmeal instead of crackers or bread. I make shape two small loaves in a 9 x 13 pan, serve one and freeze the other for a quick dinner another night. Okay, a lot of changes, but such a wonderful comfort food.

My husband LOVED this recipe. It is better than any meatloaf we have tasted.
