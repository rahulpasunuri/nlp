I looked for this recipe after having had a delicious Asian mignonette at Green Street Grill in Cambridge, MA. Theirs had soy sauce and sesame oil in it, so I added those ingredients and reduced the amount of rice wine vinegar called for here. My friends claim it was even better than the Green Street Grill's version!

A bit too strong as published, but becomes magical when a few slices of peeled cucumber are added, and all is gently minced in a mini-Cuisinart or equivalent. Cucumber cuts the vinegar and adds substance.

too vinegary

Disappointed. The flavors didn't work for me and it certainly sounded good. I tried it with grilled oysters. I will go back to a traditional migonette or lemon.

I had my family over for dinner. I made this wonderul recipe. The hardest part and most dangerous I add is chucking the oysters but every mounth full was well worth it. My brother asked me for the recipe and has made it for several friends. This is a 5 star winner!

We barbecued the oysters and they were incredible. As I did not have a lemon, I just added a dash of lemon juice. We used to always eat them raw, but was introduced to them not that long ago. Since then we have done them this way. Oysters are not cheap where I live, so they are definately a treat and it is not hard to find the excuse to indulge in these little beauties

OH MY GOD. Perfect - the fresh ginger adds a great, subtle flavor; I squeezed a little lemon juice into mignonette for added flavor. Made me feel like I finally made something extraordinary (in only a few minutes).

Incredible sauce. Our guests went crazy for this on their oysters! I'm not an oyster fan but have been converted with this sauce on them. YUM!

The sauce is light, interesting, and easy to prepare. It enhances the oysters' flavor rather than overwhelming it. I usually eat oysters with nothing more than lemon juice and a little black pepper,if that. This is the only sauce I have found that actually improves their taste.
