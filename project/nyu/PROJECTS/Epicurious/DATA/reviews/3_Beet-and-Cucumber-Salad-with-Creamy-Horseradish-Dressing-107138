I took another reviewer's word for it and omitted the cucumber (actually I marinated the cuc slices in clear vinegar and sugar and served with fresh dill separately). But, this still was as good recipe and the creamy horseradish dressing was good. The beets at my market were the size of radishes, so I used canned sliced beets instead, which worked fine, but, yes fresh would have been better. This was a nice side dish for an Oktoberfest themed dinner. Had it with bratwurst baked with kraut, apples, and onion, and of course spaetzle!

Our dinner club also featured a German theme. My husband says this was the best salad that I have ever made. I liked it but its not my all time favorite. I guess everyone likes different things! Thank goodness!

I thought the combination of beets and cucumber wasn't very good. I definitely think that you should always remove the watery heart of the cucumber; it hasn't got any taste and it makes the salad runny. Apart from that, the horseradish dressing went together well with the beets and gave them a nice pink colour. Next time I'll just leave out the cucumber.

I love all the ingredients -- beets, horseradish, watercress, cucumber,, but together this just didn't work. I made my own beets, bought the fancy English cucumber, -- followed the recipe to a t... served it at a dinner party and most of the guest plates were barely touched... I didn't care for it either. Just didn't work together and the cucumbers didn't work with the slices of beets.

First, let me confess: I used no-salt added canned beets. It was terrific. The color palette alone of this salad was a sight to behold. The combination of the vinegary watercress base with the creamy dressing was out of this world, not to mention surprisingly refreshing. I will definitely be making this salad again soon.

This makes a very nice presentation and has pretty color. I personally did not care for the dressing. I served the leftovers with a bleu cheese vinigarette and that was more tasty to me.

This was great. I love both beets and horseradish - this was a great combo. Served it as a starter, followed by a hearty beef and cabbage soup. Would also compliment goulash.

Our supper club also did a German dinner in October along with the roast por featured. We all enjoyed this recipe--however, I think I'd just open a can of sliced beets instead of roasting next time I make this recipe. There isn't much difference between roasted and canned beets (or boiled fresh beets). I loved the horseradish dressing.

I liked this salad but my family did not. I didn't use as much horseradish, trying to please my kids, and it was ho-hum.

I was disappointed with this recipe. This one sounded much better then the actual outcome. I also added more horseradish to the dressing. Just a so so salad.

Like the previous cook our gourmet group also prepared a German meal this month using this salad. I loved it!!!! As did everyone in our group. The beets were delicious and the cucumbers a perfect partner, we especially loved the watercress! The dressing was wonderful but we at least doubled the horseradish! There were 8 of us so that makes 16 thumbs up!

I am ashamed to admit that this recipe was my introduction to beets. My friend presented us with this salad as part of the German meal that was showcased in the 10/02 issue. It was just lovely. The greens, cukes and beets were a wonderful blend of different tastes and textures. The horseradish dressing was fabulous. I have since added it to our own rotation, and I am pleased that I now like beets! Oh, what I have been missing!
