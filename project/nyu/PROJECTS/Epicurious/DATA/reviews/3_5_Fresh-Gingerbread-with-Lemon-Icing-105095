I love this recipe, I make it for home, for friends, for work, it's simple, delicious, and oh the fragrance when you take it out of the oven!! You must make the lemon icing with it, it changes it from good to exceptional. Use more icing sugar & lemon than the recipe suggests.

Read other reviews before making and trebled ginger + doubled cinnamon also used honey instead of light corn syrup, healthier. Wonderful, moist and simple.

Brilliant recipe. Makes far more than I was expecting. It is very runny so don't be disconcerted. Used soy milk, I agree with others, treble the ginger and double the lemon icing. Absolute must with the lemon icing.

Used rice milk in place of milk, used honey in place of corn syrup, tripled the amount of ginger. Nice moist cake.

This cake was very moist and got great reviews. For me, it could have had a stronger ginger flavor. However, the lemon frosting overpowers the traditional gingerbread flavor I was looking for. I won't make it with the lemon icing again. I have made this cake twice and the second time I made a caramel cream cheese frosting. That time the cake got even better reviews.

Holy cow this is good. I've been requested again and again to make this by friends and family. A couple of tips: To avoid lumps in the batter it is best to sieve the flour over the liquid and whisk as you do it. I freeze my ginger root - it lasts a long time and is so easy to grate when it's frozen and tastes great. I also make double the icing. I would NOT go without the icing as the lemon brings out the ginger flavor beautifully. It is the compliment of flavours that makes this recipe so wonderful.

This recipes is incredibly easy to make and utterly delicious. It fills the house with an amazing aroma. I find a dusting of icing sugar will suffice rather than the lemon icing.

I brought this to a holiday party and the entire sheet pan was finished in short order, accompanied by rave reviews! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used the lemon curd recipe in place of the glaze. It was more work, but it turned out well. I think I will try it again with the glaze in the future.

Excellent. As other's have said, easy to make, with a moist texture, very tasty with the lemon icing being a great compliment. Also agree that it probably doesn't want to be overbaked. I did have a little trouble getting all the lumps out of the batter, the dry ingredients didn't want to incorporate, but even though some small lumps remained, it didn't suffer for it.

This was everything I envisioned gingerbread to be...moist, rich, delicious. The recipe was right about not overcooking it...I took it out before the time expired and it was awesome! We loved the texture. It's great winter comfort food and SO easy to make! I doubled the icing and added more lemon to tailor it to my needs.

Just not a good gingerbread. Very strongly flavored, very dark, almost bitter. Icing nothing special at all--just a conf. sugar/liquid mixture.

This was easy to make and truly delicious! I used a bit less molasses than the recipe called for, but taste and moisture were wonderful. I opted for a dusting of powdered sigar before serving (no lemon glaze). Looked pretty and tasted great. A big hit!

i've made this several times since i found this recipe a couple years ago. absolutely love it and won't be using any other. i had a christmas party at work and decided to make it into cupcakes. instead of the lemon icing, i made an eggnog buttercream icing that was absolutely perfect with this recipe. thanks so much to nigella for sharing her wonderful recipes with us!

Yummy! I added 1 tsp. cardamom. It worked just fine in a 13x9. I cut the squares smaller to fit the more shallow cake. They are great as bite-sized pieces to pack up for the holidays.

I'd love to know how the other reviewer made these as cupcakes--mine turned out hard, stuck to the papers, and inedible. Very disappointing, as the batter tasted delicious. If I try this again, I'm sticking to the recipe as written.

Seems a bit more pudding than bread. The flavor is nice though. Added candied ginger to amp up the spice.

I tend to try to make smaller recipes for my family, so I halved the recipe--everything but the ginger. I also added added 1/2 t. ground cardamom (1 teaspoon for a regular recipe), and used agave syrup in place of the corn syrup. I'd imagine golden syrup would also work. Because I halved the recipe, I used a loaf pan in place of the 8 x12 pan. I also used 100% whole white wheat in place of the white flour, and it turned out marvelously. (Freshly ground whole wheat is always best if you have a grain grinder.) For the glaze, I added a bit of ground ginger to the mix to cover up the cornstarch flavor of the powdered sugar, and went ahead and poured it on while the cake was still hot. One change I'm thinking about for next time is to reduce the brown sugar to 2-3 tablespoons, or the syrup/molasses to just 3/4 c. Otherwise, Delicious.

I made these as mini loaves to give as Holiday gifts and it turned out awesome. I used Maple Syrup opposed to Corn Syrup. For the frosting I doubled the recipe, used milk opposed to water and added 1/2 tsp lemon extract. It made 5 mini loaves and was well received by the recipients. No parchment needed. Just spray pans with Pam and the loaves slide right out.

Forgot to mention - I too used maple syrup in place of some of the corn syrup. We loved the dimension it gave.

This was absolutely luscious. I tripled the ginger and used lemon cream cheese frosting. It worked well as cupcakes. Coming straight out of the oven it was so-so, but after is aged for several hours it improved greatly. Rich, moist, and quite addicting.

I have made this cake dozens of times and it is very popular. I find the melting of the bicarbonate of soda very tiresome and so now I just add it to the dry ingredients. It needs careful mixing otherwise there are little white bits of flour that do not always melt with cooking. I think it is best just undercooked as it is very dense and rich. The icing is thin but gives just enough tart sweetness. More is just too sickly for our tastes.

This is a good gingerbread. I appreciate using actual fresh ginger. I cut down on the sweet stuff and topped the bread with lemon curd (from Gourmet - which is on this site) and whipped cream on the side. That change upped it to a four star... more in line for adult tastes. Homey, puckery and spicy. YUM!

i had made this by the book before and thought it was very good. this time i subbed half whole wheat flour and applesauce in place of half of the butter. i actually liked the resulting texture better this way. i added way more fresh ginger, about 2TBS. i also added walnuts and raisins which i soaked first in apple brandy to half of the batter. i made it in muffin tins. for the ones with raisins and walnuts, i made the icing this calls for replacing the lemon juice with more apple brandy and i put this on while the cakes were still hot. very delicious.

Believe it or not, this recipe comes from the "children's" section of Nigella Lawson's How to be a Domestic Goddess. I, however, served it at an adult family birthday party (which included my two toddlers) and it received rave reviews from everyone. I baked it in a 13x9" pan and it turned out fine. Next time, I would increase the amount of icing as I had to spread it quite thinly to make it cover the entire cake. (However, that isn't necessarily a downside when it's served after dinner: less is sometimes more.)

I tinkered with this a bit and get enough batter for 24 cupcakes (the old-fashioned regular-size, not jumbo cupcakes), which turn out moist & almost gooey every time. In place of the butter called for, I use 5 Tb butter & 1/4 cup + 1 Tb applesauce. I substitute barley malt or rice syrup for the corn syrup, use blackstrap molasses to boost the iron content, add 1/4 cup diced crystallized ginger, and substitute 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour for the same amount of unbleached flour. I bake at 325 for about 20 minutes, or until the center of each cake has risen and batter has set. PERFECTION.

The best gingerbread recipe on this site. I've tried them all. This stays moist for days. I would add more spices and I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup (nasty stuff) which made it lovely and less sweet. I just used a medium sized oval white ceramic dish and the size was fine - no parchment paper really necessary either.

I loved it, but I can see how it wouldn't suit a lot of tastes. Cakey and moist, I would almost say the texture's a better selling feature than the taste. Almost. 13x9 pan worked quite well. Maybe a little more cinnamon next time?

I'm an ex-pat Brit living in Connecticut and no longer have access to the 8x12x2 pans that are common in England. I haven't made this recipe yet as I'm waiting for my husband to bring me one back on one of his business trips! I have all of Nigella Lawson's cookbooks - some published in America, some in the UK. Why on earth do publishers/editors go to the trouble of converting all the ingredients, weights, measures etc, for US cooks, and then fail to convert the pan size to one that IS available here? For cooks who want to substitute a pan size, this can be done if you ensure that both pans have the same depth, then work out the area of each pan. If the area of each is within 8" of the other and the depth is the same, there shouldn't be a problem using either pan. For example, a 9x9x2 square pan (area 81 inches) can be substituted for an 11x7x2 rectangular pan (area 77 inches) as there is a difference in area of only 4 inches.

Delicious gingerbread. Very "British" flavor. Would be perfect for a English-style tea party. I put about a tablespoon of butter in the icing and a dash of vanilla. I also used a 13x9 pan and baked for about 40 minutes. I can't believe someone would give this one fork because they uses a too-small pan and it overflowed. If you use a small pan, don't use all the batter.

Having lived in England at one time, I had a 12X8 pan, but I like the muffin cup idea. I quadrupled the icing, and when the powdered sugar flavor still came through I added 4 tablespoons of butter to help it set up and mellow the lemon a bit. With that said...it is delicious. Makes the kitchen smell very cozy. I sent half of it with my husband and friends on their duck hunting trip, for a little snack in the blind.

12" x 8" dishes aren't North American standard so I thought I'd try it in a 12" x 7" dish with high sides. Disaster! I had a terrible mess in my oven! I won't be trying this one again!

This gingerbread recipe is so tasty. I wasn't sure that it would be a very season appropriate dish (I always think of gingerbread as a cold november day kind of treat), but I had fresh ginger and thought I'd give it a shot - so glad I did! I made cupcakes instead of a cake and they are so moist and delicious. Plus that lemon icing gives them a nice crispness that make them perfect for summer. I also added some lemon zest to the icing for color and flavor. Some other changes I made were: used half applesauce for the butter - which made it extra moist and light, used less b. sugar (cause the applesauce is sweet), and used about 3/4 cup whole wheat flour instead of all white. Absolutely delicious! Oh, I also added a splash of brandy to the icing - its barely noticable, but does add a touch of flavor (not that this great gingerbread needs it!).

Loved this! The cake is dense and moist but perfectly so! the lemon icing seemed too simple at first but went perfectly with the cake and people could not get enough of it! Use real lemon juice and if you're daring try some zest in there as well!

Delicious, fragrant and moist. I was a bit concerned at how wet the batter was, but turned out perfectly. The cake cuts beautifully into squares. It was gone in 30 seconds. I may try to bake it in a bundt pan next time to "fancy" it up for guests.
