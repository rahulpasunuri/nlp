I liked this recipe, but some adjustments on the second go was the real winner: I tossed the peach halves in lemon juice and brown sugar, grilled to just create the carmelized grill marks, spooned onto the pound cake, and topped with crema mexicana sweetened with brown sugar. Amazing.

I only made the peaches. Quite delicious, and perfect for a summer BBQ. Quality of peach and balsamic are key - Some of my peaches weren't quite ripe enough, which wasn't so great. I chose to blanch and peel the peaches, halve them, then grilled them after marinating. Topped off with vanilla ice cream - fantastic! The mint flavor is wonderful! All dinner guests enjoyed it.

I can never find pound cake so I always make it from scratch, which makes this recipe more work. However I do use frozen peaches (defrosted) because finding ripe ones in Wisconsin, even in summer, is a challenge. I don't mind the color of the basalmic peaches once I bite into them!

I prepared the recipe with vinegar from Modena, 12 years eged in oak barrels,(syroupy thick), also placed a scoop of sherbet on the peach cavity,and whipped cream on top with a mint leaf chifonade, It was to die for-

WOW! I made the peaches with the sauce and ice cream. Excellent!

Although this recipe was great - the taste was wonderful, however, the next time I make it I will also use white balsamic vinegar. The dark balsamic did not make the peaches very attractive.

I am reviewing the recipe for the marinated peaches only, I did not make the poundcake. The peaches were awesome. I followed the recipe eexactly, used fresh locally grown peaches and mint from my garden. Excellent, quick refreshing dessert to end a summer meal. Try it!

The warm grilled pound cake is a surprising and delightful addition to this fresh and easy summer dessert. It's simple to prepare the sauce and peaches and then set it aside before putting the cake on the BBQ at the end of the meal. I did not have fresh mint but it wasn't missed at all. I topped the pound cake with homemade vanilla ice cream, the peach mixture (I used white Balsamic Vinegar), fresh whipped cream and tossed some blueberries on the top for color and texture. Wonderful! I plan to prepare this dish for my guests this week too. I will keep this receipe and pass it on to guests who requested it!.
