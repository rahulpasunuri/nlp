My husband and I have cooked many different turkey recipes over the years, but decided to go with a more traditional flavor this year. The Herb- Roasted Turkey in the Nov 2012 issue of BA sounded perfect - and was! We did deviate from the recipe, but only by brining instead of salting (we made 'A Simple Brine' from the same mag issue). This was the best turkey we've had in years and will definitely make again. The turkey sandwiches from the leftovers were to die for! As a suggestion to the reviewer who had difficulty with the herb butter, a couple things might help: 1. pull the turkey out of the fridge for about an hour before buttering and roasting (add salt and pepper as soon as it comes out of the fridge and let it sit for that hour with the s&p), and 2. have the butter at room temp for a couple hours before spreading.

This sounded so good. I followed the recipe exactly, but this is what happened. After salting and peppering the bird inside and out, I then began spreading the soft herb butter on it. There goes the salt and pepper. The butter didn't spread evenly and was left in uneven globs. I did my best to smooth it out. Into the 450 degree oven it went for 30 minutes. Good thing I checked after about 20. The herbs were burned and the turkey breast was getting very brown. I think putting the herb butter under the skin, then salting and peppering would produce a better result and I will try that next time. This recipe has possibilities but the technique needs tweaking.

My family and I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was delicious! I will definitely make it again.
