Chere = chevre. Chere means dear (as in dear one). Chevre means goat.

I found this to be OK, not remarkable. Disclaimer: I used TJ's pre-cooked lentils.

This makes a wonderful summer side dish! Didn't have dill, so I skipped it. Still delicious! I let guests add their own crumbled goat cheese, some did some didn't but everyone raved!

Makes a great summer meal served with salad greens and a whole grain or couscous, and some simple sides such as olives, and pickled/roasted beets. Easy to make and amend to personal preferences. For the cheese, I added goat feta (chevretine) on top and it adds a briny, salty complement. Any feta would do nicely. All ingredients listed make for a balanced, pretty, yummy salad.

A classic. If you can't find (or afford) the French lentils de Puy, try this with Beluga (black) lentils - not so pricey, and available at TJ's. Nice nutty flavor, and they hold their shape well.

Great salad. I roasted my tomatoes, left out the cucumber and served it warm. Next time I think I'll include some black olives.

I owe this great recipe a review. I have used it over and over again and I like it even more every time I make it. I think I even dream of it in my sleep! As long as you use French green Lentils and have the ingredients for the "dressing" you will have a yummy dish. I have made it with and without dill and both ways are delicious. You should use least two or three of the vegetables, the parsley and goat cheese are a must. (I have used feta and it works well as a substitute) This salad also keeps well for few days, the garlic is the only thing that gets a little strong.

Delicious. It's even good without the cheese which I forgot to add the first time. I successfully used brown lentils from Umbria. As someone else noted, I did not add the additional red onion after the shallots in the vinaigrette.

I made this to serve with grilled salmon for Valentine's Day. It was a huge hit! My version was made with brown (Umbrian) lentils which was all I could find and although I had a red onion on hand, I decided against using it because I had already added a very large shallot to the dressing. I used a European "seedless" cucumber which was delicious and I didn't have to seed it. I also skipped the seeding of the tomatoes --yummy just the same. I ate leftovers today for lunch...excellent again! Note: if you are not a big goat cheese fan, just cut down on it a bit or try feta. Also, after eating this salad for two days, I really think that the fresh dill makes a big difference, so don't skip it.

I made this as written and thought the onion flavor overpowered a bit. I might decrease either the shallot or the red onion next time and add more tomato. Very good though.

I've never made Puy Lentils before and these are gorgeous! The dressing is lovely although I left out about half the oil, just personal preference. Also left out the dill as we didn't have any but added finely diced celery and scallions to the cukes, toms and red onion. Also cooked lentils in chicken broth as advised which made them much more flavorful and substituted Feta for goat cheese as suggested as we already had that in. All in all a fantastic dish can't wait to taste the leftovers tomorrow!

The dressing was good, but overall I thought this was just OK. The cheese is a little much, even for a goat cheese lover. A little more dressing and a little less cheese would improve things. I did not use the dill.

Really nice and unusual combination of flavors. I used diluted chicken broth to cook the lentils. I served it with herbes de Provence and mustard grilled chicken, so served it barely warm. It was wonderful, but for a warm salad I would omit the cucumber. It was great the next day as a cold leftover lunch salad. I used much less dill and think it was better with the more subtle amount.

Really great, even when you leave out the cheese.

I really hated this recipe. It was labor intensive and not very tasty. I like dill a lot, but found it overpowering in this dish. Also, there was too much cheese! Yuck!

Terrific salad. I had no cucumber so substituted a like amount of chopped red bell pepper and celery. I took Jan's suggestions (see review below) and added more of those ingredients. Also a dash of lemon juice. I think this salad would also be very good using black beans.

This was very good - served it as part of a buffet luncheon and everyone went back for seconds. I used a Greek feta instead of chevre. The dressing is very flavorful and the warm lentils soak up the flavor well.

This is a wonderful dish that is not very difficult to prepare. It is fresh, flavorful, and has a very nice texture. The lentils and cheese make it a good main-course dish. My modifications (to suit our tastes) were: feta cheese instead of goat cheese; addition of fresh lemon juice; and at least doubling the amount of red wine vinegar, onion, tomato, garlic, mustard, and cucumber.

This is a very good salad, however, as is often the case, you can cut the olive oil and cheese in half and it is still every bit as good. I've made it with and without dill - it's good both ways, just depends on what you like. When I made it the second time I sauted the shallots and garlic briefly. Again, just personal preference, but to me raw garlic and shallots are a bit overwhelming, even minced.

What a tasty salad! Very healthful too! Next time I might put less dill but more parsley for my taste.

This combination is very intriguing! I am not very fond of goat cheese, but it is perfect with the other ingredients in the salad. I made it for a party here in Finland and got rave reviews. I added some lemon juice at the end since the vinegar I had was too mild. I am wondering if it would work well with balsamic vinegar. In any case I will add this to my standard recipes for the summer, especially parties, since it travels well.

Colorful, great combination of tastes and textures, wonderful even without the chevre; my kids ate almost half before I had the chance to add the cheese!
