i first used this recipe to make all of my holiday cookies in 1995! I have used it every year since. I use the basic dough which is a snap to make, and roll out 2" logs to dip in dark chocolate, the raspberry squares, the orange cranberry oatmeal and many more. It is very forgiving and freezes beautifully. I make several batches of dough at Thanksgiving, freeze them and pull them out when I need to bake for company or gifts! If I don't make these cookies, my family and friends complain until I do!

I have been making cookies with this dough almost every year since the recipe was published. They are so good, and I get so many compliments that I haven't needed to try any other recipes. It can be made in advance and it freezes well. In addition to the cookie recipes listed here, the original article included Almond Butter Crisps, Spiced Icebox Butter Cookies and Apricot Stars (these are all in Epicurious). They are all made with the same dough, and one batch of dough makes 2 batches of the cookie recipes. I usually make 3 batches of dough, for 6 different cookies. The Apricot Stars are much too fiddly, but I make all the others, except for the Spritz Wreaths. Everyone has a different favorite.

These were really delicious, easy butter cookies to make. I used them for making spritz cookies with a cookie press. They came out as very delicate, buttery cookies. Everyone thought they were from a bakery...except they know me better than that!! Definitely would make again.

Excellent recipe for a very basic buttery rich dough w/lots of great variations. You can be very creative with this and put pretty much anything in, or on it, that you would for any other cookie.

I use this dough for Raspberry Hazelnut Triangles and they are absolutely wonderful. For those asking about cooking time and temperature, it depends on what you do with the dough. Check out the section at the top of the recipe that says "This recipe is used to make" and in each of those recipes you will find a cooking time and temperature.

this is my first time with this recipe, a number of years ago a friend of mine had done these for her holiday cookies. i always wanted to try them. i am still in the process of baking these but what i really appreciate is the creativity they brought out! I decided if you can do expresso and spice you can do teas! I made a green tea flavor with a sweetened matcha green tea and then a chai flavor with a powdered chai i had on hand. the chai are still baking - but the green tea was awsome. note - they didn't stay in a ball shape which i had hoped for. on the subject of texture, what i like about these is that they are like mexican wedding cookies in texture. adds great variety in holiday collection.

This is my favorite cookie recipe. I have baked it every Christmas (and in almost every month of the year. My family and I love the jelly bowl cookies: I make them with seedless raspberry jam. In addition to the variations from the magazine article, I also add mini chocolate chips for extra rich chocolate chip cookies. I recently served over 400 cookies made with two full batchs of the basic recipe at my business open house. Everyone who came into Paper Studio in Minocqua, Wisconsin enjoyed the cookies and wanted the recipe. I was thrilled that I was able to find it the the Epicurious site and did not have to re-type it. If you follow the directions from the original recipe, the cookies turn out perfectly every time!

Makes perfect butter cookies! I experimented baking the cookies straight after making the dough, and also freezing the dough overnight, and then baking cookies next day. Both options work well, altho not freezing the dough makes a slightly softer/less crispy cookie.

I made the mocha, jewel, spice and almond cookies for xmas 2006. The mocha ones looked pretty but tasted awful. The cookies were too dry and crumbly so I had to keep adding milk and they didn't taste as good. My mistake was in making the dough in advance and refrigerating it. The buttery mixture needs to be soft when it goes into the oven to get the biscuits tasting butery and soft.

I form dough into rolls (like ice box cookies), freeze, slice thin and bake. Then warm apricot, peach, or raspberry preserves in microwave and sandwich between cookies. My most requested cookie recipe

I'll keep this in my cookie recipe favorites. Very versitile. I made the mocha butter balls and also made a batch of this dough and added chopped dates and cardamom. The dates kept the cookies a bit more moist than the mocha cookies. Delicious.

Great! Wonderful for a cookie press if you reduce the flour slightly. Also great for pinwheel-type cookies. Look at recipe for meringues: chocolate walnut, for all those leftover egg whites. I did have to laugh at the reviewer before me, about it having too strong of a butter taste! These are nothing but pure butter. You can can add a bit of almond flavoring and stripe them with chocolate..yum!

Very tasty dough with a strong buttery flavor. By itself it's a little bland, but it was excellent in the Mocha Butter and Spiced Icebox versions. The dough is really easy to slice thin once it has chilled (I left mine in the fridge overnight and baked the next day).

This recipe is the best! I have been using it for ten years, and people love these cookies! I always roll the dough about 1/4 inch thick and bake them just until they are a teeny bit browned on the edge. I usually do a light basic confectionary sugar, milk and vanilla icing that I think adds to the cookie. These are buttery like a shortbread and not as sweet as a typical sugar cookie. Totally yummy!

I had been looking for an easy butter cookie recipe that I could keep in the fridge when I found this one. It is perfect. Easy, versatile and great tasting. I did make one modification--by mistake. I lost count on how many cups of flour I put in. I later figured out I was one cup short--but my cookies were not dry. Next time I counted carefully and only used 4 cups of flour, not 4 2/3. They were great. I have made the mocha balls and the jewel bowl version. I am eager to try some of the others. This is now a staple--any time of the year--at my house!

For years I've been searching for a sugar cookie recipe that produced cookies worthy of the time and effort spent decorating them. At last, I've found that it! Now I'm a pretty talentless cookie baker AND I cut the recipe not just in half but down to a quarter, and I still produced tender, delicious, buttery cookies. The dough mixed up in a snap, and I took it right from the Kitchenaid and rolled it out. True, they're a bit less sturdy than regular sugar cookies and I could see the dough being tricky to work with if your kitchen isn't as drafty and cold as mine is, but the delicious taste is well worth the careful handling.

LOOOOOOOOVE this basic recipe... I made the jelly thumbprints and also made christmas cut-outs from this dough. Excellent flavor - everyone loved them!

This is a great butter cookie recipe! I found that it's texture improved by freezing. Also, never mind being bothered with rolling it out. While it's still chilled it slices easily. I took a tip from my Mom and pressed the dough into an old aluminum foil box so that it had a nice square shape. Then when I sliced it, I could easily have squares or triangles. I used this as a base and then put raspberry or apricot preserves on top with chopped walnuts. Yummy, pretty, easy and got lots of compliments. I'll make this recipe again.

This is a wonderful tasting butter cookie recipe, but you cannot treat it like a regular rolled out sugar cookie dough. It is very soft and buttery, and does not hold up to lots of handling. I make thumbprints, the orange cranberry cookies, the chocolate coconut cookies, and a few cut out stars and simple shapes. They are always a huge hit. One thing I have found though, is that these recipes do not make nearly as many cookies as they claim. This full recipe probably only makes about five dozen cookies, and the half recipe variations make around three dozen. I would double the recipe if you are making multiple variations, otherwise you will have just a few of each one!

Rating: 4
If you're looking for a soft sugar cookie recipe, this isn't it. But if you want a rich, tender, short-bread-like butter cookie, this is a great recipe! I used it to roll out halloween cookies and they were very tasty! Needed to refrigerate dough for easier handling, but after that it wasn't too bad to work with. Yummy!

Rating: 3
I have been looking for a good basic recipe for seasonal cookie cutters, and loved working with this. I made the dough a day before and refidgerated, then left it out for two or three hours before using. I rolled it out to about 1/4 inch, cut the shapes and let kids decorate with Halloweeen themed sprinkles, then baked for 9 minutes in 375 oven. I have two disks frozen for later use, so hopefully that will work well too.

A delicious,tender cookie. I substituted lemon extract and added grated lime peel for a citrus cookie. I rolled in balls and then dusted with powerded sugar when cool. Wonderful! As for baking, bake at 350 degrees for 8-15 minutes depending on cookie size and shape. Makes lots! Chill the dough for a while for easy handling. Excellent butter cookie.

This dough makes great tasting cookies, but it was very difficult to handle! I halved the recipe, but added a little more egg than was called for because the dough was not combining and was much too dry. Well, I'm sure that due to this, the dough was very soft and even though I worked with small quantities at a time, I just about had to refrigerate the rolled dough after I cut each cookie! Otherwise the dough became too soft and was practically impossible to work with. I will use this recipe again, but only when I have the need for the whole recipe! Maybe that will help.

This is a wonderful cookie recipe. My two-year-old daughter loves them! I have started refrigerating the dough before rolling and cutting out shapes. It makes the dough easier to handle. They have a wonderful, flaky, buttery texture, without being too sweet.

This stuff is great. It makes a nice rich buttery cookie and is amazingly versatile. For the holidays, I added lots of fresh lemon juice and frosted with a lemon icing. I also made some with strawberry jam mixed into the dough and banana extract, then used strawberry icing. The last variety I tried were jam sandwich cookies. All of the above were top-notch!

These cookies are great! I usually add choc chips to the mixture but sometimes use nuts instead. I use 250 grams of butter and sometimes if I can't be bothered creaming the butter and sugar I just melt the butter and mix. I always roll into 2 - 3 logs and wrap in greaseproof paper to store in fridge. After slicing the logs into cookies, I bake at 160'C for approx 10 mins. This mixture lasts for weeks in the fridge.

I tried out the basic dough and it came out way too soft - can't even handle it (I even put it in the fridge!) Looking at all the other rave reviews, I can only conclude that my measurements must be wrong. Can someone please tell me the equivalent in weights (pounds, kilograms) for the flour and sugar ? I would really like to give this another try as my children love cookies.

I used this recipe as is to make sugar cookies, which I then iced, per the suggestion by a previous cook. They were tasty, but rather crumbly/dry -- more like a shortbread than a moist sugar cookie. But if you're looking for a shortbread, this would be a great recipe. Also, I thought there was way too much flour in the recipe -- I cut out almost a cup.

At Christmas, I divided the dough amongst my children and niece and nephew and put a variety of things before them: chocolate chips, kisses, colored sugars, sprinkles, cinnamon-sugar, etc. They had a great time inventing their own creations and they were delicious! (Especially the cinnamon-sugar sprinkled cookies.)

This recipe is absolutely incredible! I think you need to list all the variations here so people truly appreciate the flexibility of this recipe.

The most useful recipe(s) I have ever found in Gourmet! Thank you!

This is the best butter cookie dough! So versatile. I made the jelly bowl cookies, which were great, but the real hit was to make iced sugar cookies for my son's birthday at school. I iced them with the following icing in white, tinted the rest in blue and "monogramed" each child's initials on their cookie. The kids and teachers loved them. to do this, I rolled the dough the size of a walnut, pressed the dough with the palm of my hand to flatten into a circle. Bake 10-11 minutes to edges are slightly brown and cool. The icing recipe I used was to mix 2 c. powdered sugar, 2T. cream or 1/2 & 1/2, 1 t. vanilla with a mixer. This iced about 1/2 the dough made into cookies. This is our new favorite sugar cookie! Delicious!

Kids, teens and adults enjoyed these during the holidays. Great recipe for small kids to help. Make sure to supervise small children when making the thumb indentations. If the dough is pressed too firmly by the children, the jelly can seep through the bottom of the cookie when removing it from cookie sheet.

This is a basic butter cookie dough that tastes great and is easy to make. It is best to use a stand mixer. I make lintzer tarts. Cut dough into 2" rounds using a 2" round cookie cutter, half the rounds should have 1" hole in the middle. Bake. Cool. Then take Raspberry preserves with seeds. Spread ~1 Tbs. between two cookies. Sprinkle top with confectioners sugar. I have gotten sooo many compliments on this recipe. I have also made simple butter cookies decorated with sprinkles. I will never use another butter cookie recipe.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone raves about the cookies! They are gone in a flash. I do not understand how people have problems, it is very easy. I use good quality ingredients brought to room temperature. I divide the dough in 2 separate pieces, roll them up in tubes of waxed paper and leave it in the refrigerator at least overnight. To bake, I slice the dough off in rounds. They brown easily in the oven, so I check them often. After they are cool I lightly frost them with a fresh lemon juice/lemon zest/confectioner's sugar/yellow food coloring frosting. Place the frosting in a heavy quart plastic bag and make a very small hole in one corner by snipping off the corner with scissors. The frosting can be drizzled on the cookies in a pattern. If I hide them they are good for weeks.

I was hesitant to use this recipe after reading some of the reviews but went ahead anyhow...glad I did. I don't know why others had problems with it (measuring?) but they turned out great.

I was skeptical at first, but this dough is great. Made it in my Kitchen Aid K5 Pro mixer, which even though I added the flour a half cup at a time, seemed to overbeat it--had to take it out and knead it to mix in the last of the dough, and it was not sticky at all. Then I chilled it and made half of it into ball cookies around the Coconut-Date-Nut Balls from this site, dipping the tops of the balls into colored sugar--this became a fabulous cookie, very different, moist, and tasty. The other half I formed into logs, rolled in poppy seeds, then sliced into rounds and made "thumbprint" jam cookies with. Both were great. This dough is so buttery and light it is on a par with bakery cookies, if not better.

Wait! Wait! The whole point of this recipe is that you make the BASIC dough and then add stuff to it to make a very wide variety of cookies. Each basic batch makes two batches of cookies - and big batches at that. The Raspberry Hazelnut Triangles listed below is one of the subsequent recipes, there are a few others listed here too. I've made them all and they're excellent! So very easy too. Now part of my regular Xmas routine. I highly recommend it. And no need to be a professional chef - though this explanation could have been better explained here.
