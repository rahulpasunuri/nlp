I found this recipe in 1999 and it has been my favorite turkey ever since; tried a couple different once, none comes even close. I follow the recipe, just change the oven temp and cooking time(lower temp, longer cooking). Comes out perfect every time!

This stuffing is really good. I made it to accompany a large turkey breast (used basting sauce #1 and ommitted the fruit). The turkey was juicy and tasty, the stuffing really good. Would make it again.

Love this turkey! Didn't do the dressing, as Grandma's works great, but the turkey was out of this world! Perfect crispy skin, great flavor with out tons of work or crazy additions.

LOVE this stuffing. It works best, however, as stuffing and not dressing (e.g. cook inside the bird). The natural turkey juices keep it moist and mellow the flavors. I make this every year.

I have been making this turkey since 1999, and have regretted the few occasions when I tried something different. While I don't care for the stuffing, it's a matter of personal taste (too much meat for me), and not any fault of the recipe. I made the stuffing for my family two years in a row, and my brother raved about it. This turkey, however, comes out so moist and delicious that it puts turkey back in its place as STAR on the thanksgiving table, rather than butt of holiday jokes. Thank you Epicurious!

As a foreigner chef, the outcome of the recipe was totally unknown.. (never prepared a whole turkey before; not common in Italy). It's now two years that I give a party for my American and Italian friends: they find it irresistible!! the fact that the stuffing is so complicate, challenges our chef skills.. cook it outside the bird; the second busting is a MUST!!

I made this last year for Christmas, but I think I actually stuffed the bird - although it isn't explicit in the recipe. Is the stuffing better if cooked on the side? Thanks for your answers...

Yum. Everyone loved this one. The stuffing was really great and the turkey was perfect. I didn't really taste the fruit or the spices in the turkey, but it showed up nicely in the gravy. Didn't do the second basting per comments. Next time I will add the second basting just so the maple flavor blends in the gravy too.

I am now officially responsible for the turkey each year, thanks to this recipe!

I made the stuffing and it was just okay. I was a bit disappointed after reading such rave reviews. I think the stuffing has too many ingrediants. I'll stick with my basic "grandma" stuffing from here on out.

Don't know about the basting sauce but this has been our Thanksgiving dressing for years and my family won't let me make anything other kind. It does need a little more moisture if baked outside the turkey. Seems to me this was orignally a Bradley Ogden recipe.

Did not add the chicken to the stuffing (overkill)and didn't even miss it. Added 2 cups of broth to dressing, to dry without the extra cup. Everyone loved the dressing. I did brine my turkey for 24 hrs. Just did the #1 basting because it gives great flavor to the gravy. Did not do the second basting. Turkey was very moist and flavorful. The fruit gives it a great flavor.

Used 20+ lb. FROZEN turkey (defrosted) - rubbed vegetable oil/salt/pepper over turkey - covered with aluminum foil during cooking period - turned out to be the MOST moist, most FLAVORFUL turkey in 40 years! Yielded the BEST gravy EVER. The hazelnut dressing (WITHOUT the chicken) was a HIT, as well. The dressing works GREAT as a MAIN dish.

This made a very good main course. I checked other comments and adapted my cooking style. Small slits in the skin allowed the basting sauces to penetrate, but the fruit was the real winner. I doubled the hazelnuts and added more amaretto. Taste was subtle but the texture was great. Stuffing was definitely a hit! I would try this again without the basting sauces; too much work, too little reward.

The first basting sauce didn't seem to add anything to the taste of the turkey. The stuffing needed more hazelnuts .5 to 1 cup more.

I rated this recipe a "4" because of the stuffing. The basting sauces are largely unnecessary because they do not penetrate the tough skin of the turkey and they burned on the bottom of the roasting pan. This might work better for chicken where you might potentially eat the skin. I suggest increasing the hazelnuts to 2-3 cups. Though all guests loved the stuffing, nobody noticed that there were hazelnuts, so all agreed there needed to be MORE!

This stuffing recipe is phenomenal. Forget second helpings on the dessert, my guests were having second and third helpings on the stuffing! The amaretto flavor with the ham is terrific. I left out the hazelnuts and it was still great.

Delicious and fool-proof for a novice like me. I made this recipe twice this Christmas and both times impressed dinner guests with the moistness and flavour of the turkey. Reheats beautifully too.

This is the best turkey I ever made!! But i didnt add the bread and i also reduced the sauce with some white wine and i inject the turkey with more amaretto and the flavor is tasty and juicy.

After 30 years of cooking turkeys, this made up the best gravy I have ever fixed!! The night before I made fresh turkey stock with wings. In the stuffing, I deleted the chicken (overkill) and used cubes of rustic bread. Fabulous!! Next time I will skip the second basting sauce, it's not needed. I will certainly use this recipe again.

Definitely the best turkey I ever made! My family couldn't stop complimenting me! Make sure you soak the turkey in salt water first to get rid of the gamey taste! Stuffing also amazing!

Rating: 0
Just to echo a previous question: when and how do you stick the stuffing in the bird. Also do you chop up the pork sausages first or put it whole? And how did you all make the gravy? I'm a novice cook so please forgive my ignorance.

Best stuffing I've made!!! Everyone went crazy! worth the effort but really wasn't that difficult

Made the turkey and stuffing and my family absolutely raved about it. I used a turkey breast (bone in) instead of the "whole" turkey....it worked just fine. The meat was moist and had a very good taste. The stuffing was incredible!! If you are not very fond of nuts...as my family isn't leave them out....I will, next time. This ones a keeper!!

Absolutely incredible! Without a doubt, the best turkey I have ever eaten in my life. Flavorful, moist. I couldn't get enough... tons of compliments from the guests too! A must-make turkey. Another plus... the best gravy! The stuffing was time-consuming but very good nonetheless. Going to make it again for Christmas!

I didn't make the turkey, but the stuffing was wonderful! The instructions weren't very clear, but it was without a doubt the best stuffing I've ever had.

I made this dish for a holiday celebration and it was wonderful! It has become our new holiday tradition! It is somewhat time consuming, but well worth it.

The turkey came out great but all the fruit used to bast and stuff the turkey made the gravy much to sweet.

Rating: 3
Excellent! Very moist bird and great gravy due to those basting sauces. I added the rest of the butter when I sauteed the onion, celery, etc. As for "the rest of the vegetables" I assumed that that was a typo and just added the remaining ingredients. I poured about 1 1/2 cups of turkey stock over the stuffing since I used large chunks of homemade bread. As a result, stuffing was just right.

Rating: 3
Great flavor! The second basting sauce made a wonderful dark skinned bird. Stuffing was good, but a bit dry. How is the remaining butter in the stuffing used? The ingredients call for 1/2 cup, but the instructions only use 3 tsp to saute the chicken.

The turkey turned out wonderfully, moist and tender. However, the stuffing was a little too dry and probably didn't need the ham. overall very flavorful.

I'm sorry, but I didn't quite catch how and when to stuff the turkey with the dressing.Thank you
