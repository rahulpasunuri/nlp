For Deb Kane in Florida: This recipe is on the right track but falls short. Do a recipe search for "Turkey Saute With Fresh Cherry Sauce". Poach or bake your salmon and make that sauce instead. Saute the shallots in a little oil, Add the balsamic vinegar, 2 TBS. vegetable or chicken stock (instead of the water called for in the recipe)and some fresh thyme leaves. Then add the fresh cherries and Cherry All-Fruit. Simmer about a minute to soften cherries, remove from heat and swirl in a pat of butter. You'll love it, I assure you.

I hate to say that I wouldn't make this again,but I won't. The cherries were good with the salmon but...there are sooo many salmon recipes that are just as easy and are 4 forkers. Being the first to rate this recipe and only giving 2 forks,I'm kind of hoping that someone else will at least try it. I'd like to here their opinion.
