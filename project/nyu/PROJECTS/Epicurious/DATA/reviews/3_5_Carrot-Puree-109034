For a fat free version, I used almond milk and no butter. Tasted great!

I love carrot puree and this was an easy recipe to make. I use fat free half and half and instead of garlic I added dill. Not a drop remained for leftovers.

Really delicious! For a lower fat alternative, I used semi-skimmed milk instead of cream and it still had a lovely creamy texture

I roasted the carrots at 450 for 25 minutes in a tiny bit of olive oil, then pureed. Great flavor, go easy on the chicken broth, and I didn't use the garlic. Nice change from regular carrots, and nice to have a recipe for 2.

What does it need heavy cream for? I added a bit of Earth Balance Margarine (which is nice and buttery - you can try 2 tablespoons of butter), and the full flavor of the carrots comes right through. My friend brought over a handful of fresh arugula from his garden, and it was a nice touch.

I enjoy carrot puree very much so was anxious to try this recipe. I did pass on the garlic at the last minute and went by my usual dried dill. If you are not a garlic fan try this with dill. I also use fat free half and half instead of cream. I agree with the other reviews that you need to at least double the recipe.

I made this simply because it was quick, easy and I had the ingredients on hand, but it was really delicious, and my kids were actually begging for more!!! Agree with previous reviewer, this makes very little--I'll quadruple it next time...

I made this soup for Sunday dinner with a salad and hot rolls, and it was delicious. I will definitely make it again, but I would triple or even quadruple the ingredients if you want leftovers. I doubled the recipe here and it made 2 small servings. My other observation is that it was a little too salty, even using low sodium chicken broth and unsalted butter. I would cut the amount of salt in half next time. Also, to reduce the fat content, I used whole milk instead of cream and it was still very delicious. Simple and worth trying!

you can also try this one with sweet potatoes and/or winter squash.

I am not a lover of carrots, but I made this for Easter dinner and wound up having seconds! It is easy to make and everyone at the table loved it.

Great side dish. I've made it twice already and both crowds loved it. It's easy, fast and delicious.
