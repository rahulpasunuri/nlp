My mother has made this for years since we had it at a dinner party and she begged the recipe. I don't like tomatoes so I pick them out, but the onion is amazing and the bacon is soo good. The dressing is just a little tangy.

Very pleased with this recipe. Served it at a father's day gathering with a honey- ginger pork loin recipe found on this site. I used grape tomatoes and did not include the bacon, but I added cucumber (I doubled the recipe so I used 2 cucumbers, diced). Made it a day ahead and refrigerated. Everyone liked it.

After reading some of the other reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. I really enjoyed the dish. I did substitute grape tomatoes for the cherry and I used the fresh basil. I served it with grilled chicken and it complemented the meal nicely.

This is ok, not out of this world in my opinion, the bacon was a bit heavy for the salad. One suggestion for no-one who likes dinner to take more than 20 minutes is to microwave the onions - they still taste sweet and delicious.

after reading the other reviews, i assumed this would be a slam dunk. it's o.k. but i wpouldn't rave about it.

I was excited to find this recipe--it was late-getting-later and I wanted to throw something together for dinner. I made this salad and served it with marinated pan 'grilled' boneless/skinless chicken breast atop and my husband didn't even the miss the usual bread/pasta/rice carbs that usually attend our evening meals. Regular onions worked fine IMHO.

This was delicious! I used Maui sweet onions since I couldn't find Vidalia, and I used a handful of vegetarian bacon bits instead of bacon. I also shredded some romaine lettuce to act as a "filler". This was DELICIOUS! I served this with "Full o' Beans Chili".

Fabulous!! I halved the recipe and it served two with plenty of leftovers. I can't wait to make it again.

This is a tasty and simple recipe. Good for a picnic or outdoor meal (no eggs or mayonnaise). I work in an area where Vidalias are easy to come by, so I will be making this salad a lot for the next couple of weeks. Oh yes, I used half parsley and basil.
