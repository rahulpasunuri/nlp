Used comice pears of just the right ripeness and made extra caramel sauce. Six pears, could even have used seven, were just the right number for one standard size trifle bowl. Served twelve generously. The caramel cream is excellent! An all around great dessert, everyone loved it.

Surprised about some of these reviews. I have made this dessert 3 times and have been pleased with the results. If you use good pears (juicy & fresh)- take care in making the caramel and whipped cream and allow it to sit for a while... the flavors blend beautifully.

Sensational recipe...though I improved upon its flavor by drizzling brandy on the cake pieces before layering.

This just didn't cut it for me....it seems everything I've tried with pears ends up blah!

I wasn't sure how this combination of flavors would be but it is FANTASTIC!!! I made it for a dinner party and got rave reviews. In addition to toasted almonds on top I added toasted hazelnuts...delish. Also, when I cooled the pears and cut them up I soaked them in some Apple Schnapps. I will definitley make this again!

I made this recipe in a large triffle dish, instead of individual servings. I also substituted store bought caramel. It was a big hit at the party I attended. There was a table of several desserts, and this one went first. I will definately make this one again!

I thought this recipe was just to ordinary, especially with the amount of time it takes to make. I love caramel and the caramel sauce with this is not great. The pears taste like canned pears. Obviuosly alot of people disagree with my review but I will not be making again.

I've gotten such rave reviews when I've made this. It's a very impressive dish and a great alternative to a chocolate dessert for the wintertime. I imagine port-soaked pears would be nice as well. Haven't tried that, though.

This is a really nice, different dessert - that also looks very impressive. I've made it twice - the first time exactly as the recipe said. The second time I used a good jar of purchased caramel sauce, which actually tasted better and saved a ton of time. I also didn't add the caramel to the whipped cream - and used a little more between layers instead.

I have made this trifle many times to rave reviews. I even served it as part of a wedding dessert buffet - the bride and groom weren't the only ones beaming.

If you can get past your guilt on how fattening this recipe may be, you will surely enjoy serving this. At least my family had never tasted this combination. It is certainly something elegant. I went with a half cup less on the whipped cream because I would have had to buy another pint. Its fine. Don't throw away the pear syrup -- my husband actually poured it into a cup and drank it for breakfast, he loved it. I served this dish in a large glass bowl and scooped it into wide crystal glasses.

Perfect dessert, but I learned a little goes a long way. Serve small portions!

I made this with 1 tsp vanilla extract instead of a vanilla bean, canned pears and ladyfingers instead of sponge cake and it was delicious. My guests all gave it 4 forks. I would make it in one dish next time and divide into individual portions at the time of serving.

This recipe is great. We ended up making it with ladyfingers. If you do that you should actually let it sit overnight so that the cookies get soft. It was so much better when we ate it again the second day with the soft ladyfingers!

I do not have fresh pear in Indonesia. So, I substituted with canned pear from del monte. And, it tastes delicious. My family and friends love them.
