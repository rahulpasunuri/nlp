This was not what I expected as fried rice. I will not make this recipe again. I was disappointed. Find another option.

I pretty disappointed in this recipe. Way too many scallions and peas, not nearly enough shrimp. Mixture needs to be cooked for much longer than "2-3 minutes to be heated through." Rice was mushy.

Excellent fried rice recipe. I had around 4 cups of brown sushi rice so used that. I disagree with the other reviewers about the extra soy sauce being needed since I think the flavor would be too strong for shrmip. But it's a matter of taste and this is a great flexible base recipe to fine tune to personal taste.

I agree with the previous reviewer. It need more soy sauce.

Good recipe, needs a little more kick. Next time I would add more egg and soy sauce, otherwise it's a nice and easy to prep.

Very easy and very flavorful. I added pequin peppers to the liquid (6) and it had the zip needed. The recipe is very adaptable, I used fresh broccoli, red and yellow peppers and snow peas with garlic instead of the peas. Great flavor and so simple.

This was my first time ever making fried rice, so that probably has some to do with my review. The dish turned out pretty tasty. One thing I would change, however; would be to add more egg. I barely notcied the scrambled egg in the dish. I guess I"m used to the fried rice you get in chinese restaurants having lots of stuff. This is a recipe that needs a little more kick, but it was great. I think next time I'll change up the amounts of certain things, like the soy sauce and eggs. I also added some beef to go with the shrimp.

A good, fairly simple recipe for fried rice.

This was fantastic and easy! I substituted shelled soybeans for the peas... also left out the rice wine and doubled the soy sauce. Yum - and my husband loved it too!

Very good! I used onions instead of scallions and also added some water chestnuts for extra crunch!

This rice had a nice flavor to it. Very aromatic on account of the fresh ginger. I used Jasmine rice and that was a mistake! Even after letting it age in the fridge 2 days it was still too soft for this recipe. Next time I'll use a firmer grain.

I'm a huge lup chuong (chinese sausages) fan and am always looking for a recipe where I can use the sausages. I substituted the shrimp with a pound of lup chuong, so in all honestly I can't say I've tried the recipe as written, but it was sensational with the lup chuong. Lup chuong is a sweet, dense (already cooked) sausage, and I sliced it thinly. I left out the salt and added more soy sauce for flavor and I added the sausages in the beginning so they would have a chance to cook through a bit. Very tasty and easy to make. I would definitely make this again.

good recipe, very flexible and easy. I suggest doubling the broth and rice wine to 1/4 cup each. Omit the salt (since you use soy and soy=sodium). And, use the sesame oil for the stir-frying instead of in the mixture (lowers fat, doesn't affect the tast, in my opinion). I also added garlic.

We loved this. It was so easy. Instead of making the seasoning though I bought House of Tsang, Classic Stir Fry Sauce. Makes this dish even easier.

By far the tastiest fried rice that i have ever eaten! Better than any restaurant. A word of caution though, OMIT the salt in the seasoning sauce, or it will be way too salty! I used brown jasmine rice instead of white. Never use freshly cooked hot rice for this or the dish will turn out like a mushy mess...use cooled rice instead.

I've been making this for months. It's definitely one of the best things I've made from this site. ...and it's SO FLEXIBLE! You can pretty much use any vegetable! I've fallen into a pattern of onion, scallion and frozen corn, but anything works. My aunt even substitutes apple juice for the mirin.

I liked this recipe because it was easy and I could substitute ingredients according to what I had on hand. For instance, I used diced carrot/celery/mushroom/onion in place of scallion, used sherry in place of rice wine vinegar and the frozen baby shrimp instead of fresh. Didn't expect much with so many changes but it turned out great. Who knows what I'll throw in next time!

I would reduce the amount of scallions called for. The flavor was overpowering. The recipe was not worth the effort.

We love this dish! I do double the sauce and marinate about a pound of small firm tofu which I add after the rice. Also, mixed vegetables, or oriental frozen vegetables add a nice touch instead of the peas. This is definitely a keeper!

I've added this meal to our weekday repertoire. I use a half pound of frozen baby shrimp (defrosted and well-drained) and marinate a half pound small cubes of plain firm tofu in the seasoning liquid. I add the tofu after the rice. I skip the frozen peas but serve the shrimp fried rice with either broccoli, green beans or snow peas sauteed with garlic and mushrooms. The whole family enjoys it.

Great dish! Added 2cups of bean sprouts with the shallots(I thing all fried rices needs bean sprouts to add a crunchy flavor), also omitted the rice wine and added 2 tbs. more chicken broth. Turned out wonderful, even the kids liked it.

I made the eggs in a seperate skillet, omelet style, rolled the omelet and cut it into thin ribbons and added them after the sauce. Also I would increase soy in sauce to 2 to 3 Tbsp. Otherwise, this is a great main course dish
