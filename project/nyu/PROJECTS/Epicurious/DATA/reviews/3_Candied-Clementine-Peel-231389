Ugh!! In fairness, this is a standard method of candying citrus rind. However,when I tried it with clementines, the results were truly awful. The peels never made it to that translucent state that I've gotten with other citrus rinds. The pith (the thin layer of white) has a texture that's between mushy and slimy, and somehow thicker than before the candying process. A bit of the peel tastes OK if you can ignore the ghastly texture of the pith, but has an awful aftertaste. All in all, I wouldn't attempt this with clementines again. Grapefruit? Absolutely (though a total of 4 boil-and-drain steps before the syrup stage seems to be the usual recommendation). Buddha's Hand fruit, ditto but no preboiling required for that - just dice and candy.

made these to decorate my chocolate mousse for a christmas desert. Wonderful delicious. Can't wait to try this recipe with different kinds of citrus fruits!

Very good recipe. Can't keep these in the house.

This is a great method for candying citrus peel. I think that giving it two good boils and changing the water in between does a good job of getting any waxes and preservatives off of the peel. The long simmer in the simple syrup (I let mine go for about an hour and 20 minutes) made the peel tender and sweet, and great for munching as well as the chocolate tart recipe!

i haven't tried this recipe, but want to extend a caveat to other readers: be certain to use organic fruit when candying peel, since the skins of non-organic fruit are treated with toxic colorants, preservatives and pesticides.
