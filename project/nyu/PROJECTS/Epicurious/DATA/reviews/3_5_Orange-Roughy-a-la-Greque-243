I didn't have the feta, and found all of the other ingredients in some tapendae that I'd recently made, so just combined that with the plain yogurt and baked. I can't see the lemon working in there, not with the capers-too much, too strong. Otherwise, my version was great!

I gotta tell ya. Love this fast, easy and tasty recipe. We serve it over a bed of rice and arugula for a one dish meal. We use greek yogurt and drink with a buttery Chardonnay. mwah!

This was very disappointing. I made this as directed, but will not make it again. The toppings were overpowering. You could not taste the fish at all. Didn't even finish eating one piece of fish. What a waste of Orange Roughy!

This recipe is fabulous. I've been using low fat sour cream instead of yogurt. It's wonderful on any kind of fish, and I've been passing it along to my friends with kudos describing both my version and this version. I love it and make it frequently. Thank you so much for such a delicious recipe!

Kind of like a Greek salad on top of fish. Too much "stuff" overwhelmed the dish. No thank you!

This is a fish mainstay at our house. It's so quick and easy to make. It's delicious. We get rave reviews as if we spent much more time preparing. Sometimes I use olives instead of capers, but both are great!

Like the previous reviewer, I've never thought that fish and cheese go together, but I thought it was GREAT! It must be noted that I had no yogurt, so my version was a bit different. The cheese added some nice oil to the fish and the lemon and tomato all came together deliciously.

Cheese and fish is never a good combo. I thought this receipe was gonna be iffy, but my man wanted to make it. Sure enough gross! I felt pukey the rest of the night.

This sauce had great flavor! I made a couple of adjustments as I am going through chemo and can not eat raw fruits/veggies - used Greek yogurt for better consistency, eliminated the onion, used canned tomatoes and lemon juice. It was wonderful!

I tried this tonight and it was good. I did like it. However next time I would use it to uptick Talapia for home and save the Roughy for guests. Easy to make since I had all ingredients on hand. I'm not sure how many times I'll make it again but it was tasty.

I made this yesterday exactly as the recipe said and it was excellent! Extremely easy to make and sooooo good, the only thing I added was a little lemon juice to the cheese mixture, and some lemon wedges on the side of each plate. Awesome!

Rating: 4
Oh this was so good! Even my 2 year old liked it. I used olives instead of capers (I didn't have capers), they gave the dish just the right amount of salt. I think I am going to make this for my next dinner party.

This dish was excellent. I made double the sauce. I used a mis of fresh roma tomatos and a can of Muir Glen (the romas did not look that good the day I made this). I added a bit of garlic and fresh basil just to use it up. I had to cook the fish longer than called for, I think because there was so much sauce on top. I made some cheese tortalilli and it was an excellent meal.

We loved the topping to this fish, but felt that there was not quite enough of it. Next time I will double the topping and/or season the fish with spices as well. I think it would also be a wonderful topping to chicken.

Absolutely marvelous!! I did change a few ingredients though. Goat & low fat ricotta instead of the feta & yogurt. I also added basil and a dash of chili powder. Can't wait to make it again.

Definitely will make again. Amazing flavor while still being light and tasty. Think I'll try it with Tilapia next time, also a great fish but somewhat less expensive.

Our whole family love this one! The grated fresh lemon peel makes the dish so don't leave it out. The topping keeps the fish very moist and flavorful.

Really Really liked it! I am making it again tonight! I thought the Feta was the perfect choice of cheese. I also added fresh Basil Yum!

Rating: 4
I just made this, and think it was one of the top fish dishes I've gotten from this site. I substituted swordfish for the roughy, with delicious results. The steaky quality of the fish holds up well to the sauce. I used a bulgarian feta, which is mild, and added sundried tomatoes, orgeno and fresh basil. Would make again for week night or company in a heartbeat.

Really fansastic - made it just like the recipe, and it was perfect. Get the water out of the roughy first if you can.

Very good. Do use the herb feta thats out in the stores. I like to add fresh basil.

Rating: 3
This recipe proved both simple and delicious. It works equally well on Tilapia and Orange Roughy. In addition to regular feta, I have tried it with the reduced fat tomato basil feta cheese. The regular feta makes the sauce a bit creamier, but the reduced fat was also delicious. This is a must-try recipe.

Rating: 3
I'm a so-so fish fan, but found the orange roughy to be hearty and buttery, and an excellent choice for this topping. I think next time I will add more lemon, definitely more yogurt to have more "sauce". I used reduced fat feta, which was still good, but I think it reduced the creaminess..maybe will try regular next time. I had to leave out capers and onions as my husband hates them, but would love to try again with the onions at least. I baked as directed, but gave it about a minute under the broiler to "set" things a little.

Rating: 3
We really liked it! Great flavors. I did not have the yogurt so I sub'd lite sour cream. Will definitely go into the regular rotation.

Great, easy and tasty, I can't wait to try it on veal- scallopini style. I used all the hints, a bit less feta, a bit more yogurt and sun-dried tomato basil feta. My 5-year-old twins even loved it!

Rating: 3
I loved this recipe, but definitely agree about scaling down on the feta--it made it too salty, esp. with the capers. I've made this twice now and used roughy as well as tilapia--great on both but go light on the "sauce" if you use tilapia b/c its so thin.

This is a great, really tasty, quick fish preparation. I upped the yogurt to 3/4 of a cup and we loved it. Definitely a keeper

My husband and I tried this recipe and LOVED it! It was very easy, very fast to make and the flavors are just wonderful. We used sun-dried tomato and basil feta and it just added all that more flavor. Great summer recipe with a nice Chardonnay and a light salad.

Rating: 2
Made this awhile back and have not made it since. Will make again someday but definitely scale way back on the feta topping. I made it according to the recipe and it way overpowered the fish. Easy to make and would be great with just a small spoonful on top. Served with steamed asparagus.

Rating: 3
Instead of baking the fish, my husband grilled it in an open foil pouch, then added the feta, etc at the end. Also, I reduced the capers to an abosolute minimum (hate them!) and added chopped Kalmata olives in their stead. I was feeding my cousin and her husband; she's repeatedly asked for the recipe. TO THE COOK FROM RAMSTEIN. Have you considered that the feta you used may be stronger than domestic feta? When I was overseas (Germany, England) I though that Greek feta was much stronger - but leaps and bounds better!

To me, the feta flavor did not compliment the fish. To each their own.

My husband and I thought the feta completely overpowered the wonderfully mild flavor of the fish. I love every one of the ingredients so thought this was going to be a "sure thing". I'd recommend trying it anyway; I'm obviously in the minority.

I made this for my husband and I last night and it was one of the best fish dishes we have ever had. I thought the sauce would be overpowering, but it only complimented the fish. I will be serving this often and highly recommend.

I thought this dish was just so-so. I didn't hate it, but I don't think I would make it again. I do not like capers so I left them out. Maybe they are the magic ingredient.

This dish is EASY and FAST to make. Prep work was 10 minutes (chopping the onions and tomatoes, collecting the ingredients), and bake time was fast. I used tomato/basil feta, and for my effort, the results were delicious. For a quick, easy, and tasty meal, this is a winner.

This fish recipe is wonderful! I have made it 3 or 4 times so far and we love it. Matter of fact, my little sister is on vacation in Australia right this minute and is calling to have me read it over the phone to make it for her hosts... now that is a good recommendation!

This is a "wow"!!! It was excellent and very easy to make! I took the advice of the other cooks and used tomato basil feta and cooked it a bit longer. Can't wait to make it again!

Rating: 3
Very tasty entree. I tried it with red snapper and it came out quite good. The topping really keeps the fish moist. Just needed to cook it a little longer than the recipe called since it is a thicker fish fillet. If your looking for a low-fat recipe, this is one to keep. I also recommed using the flavored feta cheese and I added both dried organo & thyme for a little more flavor.

Rating: 3
We loved this - what a surprise! I was unsure of the combination of fish and feta, but the sauce by itself was delicious and with the fish even better. It was very colorful, tasty, and simple. I'm on a campaign to convince my husband to eat fish, and this certainly helped! I did add just a touch of dried oregano, and had to use sour cream, but will go back to yogurt in the future.

Rating: 3
Wonderful flavors! Substituted kalamata olives for the capers, but otherwise made exactly as recipe stated. The fish was moist and flavorful and no one would have guessed how quick and easy the preparation was. Will definitely make this again.

I notice that those who gave this recipe low marks made substantial changes to it. Sole or Flounder is not the same as Orange Roughy. Nor does the addition of outre ingredients necessarily improve the recipe. I made it as written, and it is great.

The sauce is wonderful...the fish is just to get it to your mouth. Our sauce turned out creamy and fresh and was quick to prepare. I used the tomato & basil feta as someone else suggested & substituted thinly sliced green onion for the red onion. I think the sauce would work equally well with chicken or as a spread on crostini for a Greek-style appetizer.

very good and EASY. I threw it all together, popped it in the fridge, and then put it in the oven when guest arrived - so easy. I left capers out (don't like them) and used basil and tomato feta

I loved this recipie because it had a lot of flavor, I usually don't eat a lot of fish because I don't think it has enough flavor or substance. This recipie had great flavor and I was full after two fillets.

i thought this recipe was ok but not ok enough to serve to company. i added some chinese mustard to the sauce to give it a little kick. my wife would rather have had the roughy thrown back into the ocean rather than eating it prepared this way. can't please everyone.

Being a novice cook, this was so easy and my guests loved it. I know a good sour yogurt an Indian friend suggested and it worked great. Rinse the capers! I added a few greek olives chopped finely and used shallots instead of onion. This was too easy to have been so good.

This is a great recipe that is quick enough to serve often, yet "fancy" enough to serve company. The only thing I changed was adding a bit of sour cream instead of the yogurt (I discovered I had sweetened and didn't think that would taste good. ). I will make it again...this time with the yogurt and maybe a flavored feta.

This was pretty good. I used fat-free yogurt because that's all that was available and sun-dried tomato/basil feta. I enjoyed this though I thought the feta was slightly overpowering the flavors of the other ingredients. My fiance is not a fish lover and he didn't care for this much.

We have tried this with different flavors of feta. This is a real keeper! I don't like capers so I leave them out. You don't need them with the southwestern feta anyway. Fast, easy and a GREAT taste!

How could this be white on white with lemon, capers, tomato? Maybe the first reviewer was rating something else?

Fabulous!!! I buy frozen orange roughy filets at Trader Joes, and when you make the sauce with prepackaged crumbled feta, this couldn't be easier (or more delicious). I substituted chopped green onions for the red onions; added 1 tablespoon chopped sun-dried tomatoes for one of the plum tomatoes; and replaced the lemon zest with 1 teaspoon of crushed garlic. Mmmmmmmmm.

I used lemon sole, but otherwise altered nothing. I found the uncooked sauce delicious in its saladlike state, but once cooked it was chalky and unappetizing--a little reminiscent of liquid antacid. I would not recommend serving this to company without trying it yourself. Definitely lacking in the eye-appeal dept., too: white on white.

I've made this recipe several times, and it just gets better. I, like another reviewer, left off the capers (I just don't like the little buggers) but took Epicurious' advice and used the flavored fetas. I highly recommend "southwestern" flavored feta cheese in this recipe if you can find it. It's flavorful and adds a little kick to the dish. Also, try it with different fishes...the topping is good on just about anything with fins.

I am a novice cook looking for a way to incorporate fish into my family's diet. This recipe was wonderful! Even though I forgot the onion and left off the capers, it was still excellent! I cooked it a little longer, about 15 minutes to make sure the fillets were well done.
