This was a great twist on the average pumpkin pie. The ginger and molasses really gave it more flavor and everyone loved it for Thanksgiving. Try using organic pumpkin instead of conventional. It has a much sweeter taste!

It was good, but not great. I was looking for something different. My boyfriend made the comment that it simply tasted like a thinner pumpkin pie.

I made this for Thanksgiving, in the hopes that it would be an improvement over traditional pumpkin pie, which I have never liked. This tart was great...not too difficult, and very flavorful. I used regular (dark) molasses, which gave it the extra kick the other reviewer may have felt was lacking. My crust's sides sank a bit during the initial baking, and so I didn't use all the filling. I'm happy to report that the filling is delicious on its own!

I was really disappointed with this tart. I made it for a friend's birthday and it was not a hit. It just didn't pack the punch we felt it should have. It sounded delicious...too bad.

This recipe is always a big hit - but I agree with the other reviewer - must be a typo regarding the baking time of the crust before adding custard- cut it back to 15 minutes and then add custard and bake for 45 and you have a winner!

Fabulous recipe... everyone loved it. My only complaint was the 2nd cooking time (45 minutes) was too long. Crust got a bit overdone.
