Made this with brandywine tomatoes, hawaiian sea salt, and a side of parsley basil and corn couscous. Awesome! The tomatoes make a sauce that is perfect with the fish and basil sauce!

I used salmon and it tasted great. It's very easy to do.

great with salmon too. i made extra of that sauce that went over the tomato, and no one complained. course, i was just eating by myself.

This fish dish was absolutly a breeze to put together. The Char cooked in 3 mins in the Salamander and tasted beautiful. If you want a fish that does not taste "fishy" then this is for you. Get the Char fresh. Better qualilty

Easy and elegant dish. As suggested, I added a bit off lemon juice to the basil sauce. Lots of flavor and great presentation.

This was good, but not great for us. The basil sauce seemed lacking in some way, despite using our own fresh basil.

Excellent. Flavors really work together. I added a little lemon juice to the sauce to lighten it. Sauce is enough for 2.

Perfect...simple...and delicious. This can be used with any type of fillet. I used haibut the first time and tonight, salmon.

This is a great dish - and incredibly simple and fast. I use cherry tomatoes, coarsely chopped. And, since char isn't available here, I use salmon. I also add lemon to the basil sauce; next time I might add some yogurt or cream to the sauce.

I got a thick piece so it was rare in the center. But mixture of everything together was amazing. Maybe next time I'll be a little more careful with the oil and not start a fire :-)

Great recipe and easy. This fish cooks quickly, so don't leave it in the broiler more than 8 minutes or it will be overcooked. I took it out a little earlier and served it rare in the middle. I would definitely make it again.
