This was the best turkey we have ever had! I actually used the preparation for a breast, adjusting the time by using a meat thermometer. It was meant to be an "extra" for Thanksgiving night sandwiches and leftovers for the weekend. My family devoured it--not a morsel left for anything after the sandwiches. All of us LOVED it--moist, juicy, tender, simple and perfect. The gravy was quite good too--I used it for the main meal. Very flavorful and simple. I am usually a failure at gravy , but this was delicious, a great consistency and easy.

I cooked my turkey on Tuesday night, before Thanksgiving at 450 degrees which made my turkey mahogany colored in about 40 minutes. I had to cover it with foil and turn down the heat to 350. When the probe registered 165 in both thighs, it was about about the time specified, almost 2 hours. The meat may have been cooked, but the meat was not juicy, the joints were red, and difficult to move. This happened to me last year also with the turkey with truffles from Gourmet. I'm going back to a slow oven method, about 325 degrees, for moist juicy turkey. Sadly, my similar comments from last year no longer appear on the recipe.

Good basic Turkey Recipe, gravy is a taste thing you may need to season accordingly and may be done without giblets if wanted, we made both batches, both very good. Happy Thanksgiving from the Poker Guys
