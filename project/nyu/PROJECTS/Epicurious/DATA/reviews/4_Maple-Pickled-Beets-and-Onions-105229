I'm not typically a fan of anise, but made these for a friend and was delightfully surprised by the subtle flavors. I'm gearing up to make more, so I figured I'd give it my vote of approval while I'm on the page -- these are well worth the time and effort.

I am a frequent epicurious-er but have never written a review before. This recipe is worth breaking the silence. I made it last fall on a whim and had friends fighting over spare jars of these beets. Am planning to repeat again this year, and will have to double or triple the recipe in hopes of averting World War III. Very delicious! I might try an experimental batch with parsnips thrown into the mix...

I thought the flavour was lovely, and quite complex, with the cider vinegar, maple syrup, ginger and anise. I was worried that the halved onions would fall apart, but they didn't; in fact the appearance of the finished product was very attractive.
