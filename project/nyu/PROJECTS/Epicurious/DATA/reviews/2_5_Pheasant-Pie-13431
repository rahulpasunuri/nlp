I followed the recipe to a T, and thought the results were delicious, as did everyone who at the pie. The recipe would definitely feed 8. We get wild pheasants (shot during a hunt, not farm-raised), and therefore it is generally "gamey" in flavor. The spices in the rub are a great foil to the natural flavor of the bird. However, I would probably only make the dish again for a very special occasion. They're not kidding about the length of time involved.

Far too cumbersome, unedited and silly (two days?) for uninteresting results. Should be deleted from the library.

Someone didn't proofread this recipe properly. There are two ingredients in the body of the recipe that are not listed in the ingredient list (turnips and garlic) so you don't know the quantities listed for either. I used 3large cloves of garlic and substituted 2 potatoes for the turnips as I discovered them when I was in the midst of cooking on Christmas Day! Overall, a great deal of time and effort is called for here that doesn't seem to properly translate into flavorful benefits . . . I'm glad I made this once so as to have experienced it but will NOT do so again.

Very good. It serves at least 8 people generously, not 6. It has a very distinct flavor of juniper berries, which goes well with the pheasant, but not all of my family liked it. Also, if you are not used to cooking game, you need better instructions concerning cleaning the bird, even if you bought it in a semi-clean state, as there can still be bird-shot in the meat.
