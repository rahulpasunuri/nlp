Sorry... I forgot to mention that I didn't really follow the veg cooking instructions. I used fresh onion and a mix of homegrown tomatoes since they needed to be used. I like to steam broccoli in the microwave, so I went with what I know.

We didn't have beans on had, but this turned out to be delicious anyway. The garlic flavor was wonderful. I decided to add some leftover chicken into the sauce and it was a hit with the whole family!

I agree with previous reviewer "riotbrrd" about many aspects; but I did enjoy the concept of this dish: using frozen vegetables to make a quick and healthful pasta dish. I found it a good launching point for improvisation, using whatever kind of frozen veg. and pasta that I had on hand. I particularly liked the use of the garlic/pepper oil as a toss-in at the end. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used some chopped sun-dried tomatoes and put them in with the onions to get the tomato flavor without the mush. If you're smart about it and don't blindly follow the directions, you can make this a great meal.

I agree with another reviewer on this one. There was nothing special about this recipe even after adding some of the suggestions (mushrooms and basil). I wont be making this one again

I altered the recipe and used white mushrooms, red peppers, aspaaragas, onion, and snap peas. I sauteed the mushrooms with the onions, then added the other vegetables (without boiling them),briefly sauteed them, and then cooked them covered for about 7 or 8 minutes. They came out very tender without boiling them. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it came out delicious.

easy, tasty and I also added mushrooms to the onios which made a lovely sauce that added to the pasta. Next time I will use more garlic

I don't understand the high ratings this recipe received. It has some serious problems: 1) Salt: it needs some. 2) Fishing the blanched veg out of the water took forever. 3) 5 minutes cooking turns cherry tomatoes to mush; 2 minutes would be better. 4) Cook garlic over high heat, as the recipe directs, and you have a very good chance of burning it. In addition, it quickly absorbed the olive oil and turned it into a nice solid pack of garlic - rendering the subsequent instruction to "toss with garlic oil" rather mystifying. What oil? 5) I suggest more cheese, less butter.

So simple and so unexpectedly flavorful. Even the kids ate it. I'll definitely use this one again.

This was pretty awesome. . . and easy. We only had about half of the broccoli called for and added shiitake mushrooms (sauteed with the onions). Delicious.

we made this sans red pepper flakes, and using fresh green beans and broccoli. it looked beautiful and was quite yummy. we will try adding some fresh basil next time.

Yummy. But I used all fresh veggies, not frozen and I only blanched the veggies and did not re-cook them with the butter.

Delicious and super easy! And my boyfriend loved it! I added a little more red pepper to spice it up some more. I added some of the cheese as directed and some later, to get a more even distribution. Definitely would make this again.

A very easy and light version of primavera. I would deinitely make this again on a busy night, maybe adding some carrots or red peppers for color.
