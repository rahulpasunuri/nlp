I made this with the following modifications after reading reviews: I made a half size pan using half the fruit but full recipe of custard ( I subbed fage nonfat greek yogurt for the creme fraiche, as I often do) and full recipe of topping. I toasted the pecans and I used whole wheat rather than AP flour, which increased the nutty flavor. i also left out the flour in the custard and in the fruit, and decreased the sugar in the fruit by a lot. We really liked the result; not fancy, but the custard added something nice and we liked it. It does not need ice cream on top, due to the custard.

I made this dessert shortly after the magazine it was in came out, and have made it for Thanksgiving ever since. I make it exactly the way the recipe says to, and have no issues with it. And I love that it's pear season around Thanksgiving. Anyway, a great dessert to offer a little something different besides pies for the holidays.

A very yummy dessert. Perfect for everyday or entertaining. Not a fine gourmet dish for entertaining, but very good! It would be more gourmet in appearance if plated, which I did not. I did heed the advice of earlier reviews and increased the topping; I doubled it and found it to be the perfect ratio. I also added a hint more lemon peel to the pear mixture. Some of my Bosc pears were not as ripe as the others, so in a pinch I used 2 Riviera pears to supplement. Rivieras are softer, so I don't recomend totally replacing the Bosc with those or any other softer pear or you will have mush, but a few in a pinch worked for me. Everyone in my discerning group of foodies liked this; I had requests for the recipe. It was not overly sugary nor overly pear-like.

This recipe is a crowd-pleaser, but I had to modify it a bit. I double the amount of pecans in the topping (1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup), and I increase the custard mixture by 50%. There should also be an alternative recipe for the creme fraiche. It is quite expensive in supermarkets but is relatively easy to make at home by mixing 2 TBS. buttermilk with 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and letting this sit in the refrigerator for 24-36 hours.

really delicious. I loved the custardy texture and flavor instead of just fruit. I left the lemon out of the filling and just used a little in the topping and it kept it from being too sweet. I might use a little less butter in the topping next time, it didn't really get crispy. I used apples and blackberries, as thats what I had.

I would rate this between 2 and 3 forks (that is, between "good" and "delicious"). I made it exactly as stated and thought it was a nice homey dessert. The custard filling did add a new twist to the standard fruit crisp recipe, but didn't immensely improve upon it. (I think I prefer custard in the context of fruit tarts, rather than integrated in crisps.) But it tasted good and was worth the try!

I've made this twice for my picky family, and everyone loved it. I did modify the recipe slightly the second time by making more custard and more crumbly topping, but mouths were watering over it both times regardless of the amounts. It's a perfect fall or winter dessert for those who want something other than chocolate.

I made this as is except lime juice and zest (I have a lime tree). It was delicious, everyone loved it, will make this again...

I am glad I didn't heed the negative reviews. This dessert is wonderful. I followed it pretty exactly and made it twice, once for Thanksgiving and once for New Years Eve. Elegant, wonderful and easy. Follow your instincts.

Sorry, I did not like this at all. The crispy topping had little flavor and the custard tasted like I had just put an egg ito the recipe for no reason. My company seemed to like it but the large amount of left overs are still sitting on my counter 4 days later and I have 2 teens that will eat anything.

Oh, yes and NO LEMON ZEST. To over powering for me.

This is a great recipe! I didn't have any creme fraiche, but sour cream worked just as well. I tried it once with Slenda but it didn't puff up as well. There really is no need for 3 different bowls. One bowl can be used if you start with the filling, then the custard and leave the topping for last. Rinse the bowl out between each preparation. I've substitued, apples when I ran out of pears and even tried it with a hint of ginger. I didn't have dried cherries so I used giant raisins. No peacans, so granola worked just fine. An excellent breakfast dish as well.

So very tasty!! I forgot to put the sugar (I only had regular) through the food processor but it was fine anyway. I loved the lemon flavor and the sourness of the cherries against the custard. The only thing I would change is to add a little flour to the topping to make it crispier. Yum!

I would make this again, but I think I would like to make some changes. First, to those who said it was bitter; perhaps when you made your zest, you ended up with too much pith (the white skin beneath the yellow) from your lemon. Second, I wonder what would happen if part of the creme fraiche was replaced with lemon curd, and the over-all lemon zest was reduced? Hmmmm.... I will let you know.

I was so surprised to see the luke warm reviews on this recipe. I've made it twice now and thought it was the best crisp I've ever had. I did make some alterations though. For one, I used apples instead of pears. I had to chop them fairly fine to cook through. I neglected to add any lemon too. I had to keep my eyes on it and cover it after a half hour though because it seemed to get too dark. The first time I used creme fraiche as directed. The second time I used a combination of marscapone and sour cream. Both equally good. What really made this stand out was the vanilla and the dried cherries. Excellent comfort food. Especially warm with vanilla bean ice cream. YUM!!!!

Next time I will double the custard.

Terrible. Bitter flavor even thought I followed the advice to cut the lemon down. The custard was bone dry after cooking for 55 min. as the recipe states. My husband and kids who devour crisps wouldn't even eat it. I had to throw it in the trash. I've never had an epicurious recipe turn out this bad.

Delicious. Tried the recipe with apples and most preferred the recipe with apples vs. pears.

I was expecting this to be more custard like based upon the name and the picture. While I thought it was good, wasn't much different than many other recipes for similar dishes.

The lemon flavor in this dish is too strong. We only ate about a third of it, and we are big dessert eaters. If I make it again I will significantly reduce the lemon zest.

Excellent. My wife said she would have been happy to be served this at any restaurant. I used firm - just ripe - comice pears which were super.

This was great! I used ripe d'Anjou pears and added a little extra cinnamon and vanilla for some added sweetness. Even my hubby (who usually does not eat dessert) loved this!

Too tart. Would not make this desert again.

This is a nice dessert. Easy to make, smells great and looks pretty. It didn't have enough of a pear flavor for my taste -- probably the pears I chose weren't quite ripe enough. I think next time I'll try using Bartlett pears (this is the variety used in the pear-cardamom pie recipe from the Nov 1998 Bon Appetit, which is a fabulous pie).
