Excellant! Made it as part of the Southwestern Christmas menu and it was a huge hit. Anytime we are asked to bring a side this is our go to dish! Very moist and super flavorful, I will eat leftovers straight out of the fridge!

The Cheddar-Butermilk Corn Bread is made in an 8x8 pan.

Could someone tell me what type of pan one should use for the corn bread? Loaf pan, or larger sheet pan (such as a lasagna pan)?

Made this for company & they asked for the recipe. I used leftover scratch cornbread and added 1 cup of chedder when assembling the recipe. I made sure the enchilada sauce had the most dried chiles (as compared to tomato sauce.) Good as a side or main dish.

I made this for a Southwestern- themed Christmas Eve dinner and all my guests enjoyed it. It is not too dry if made per the recipe; has sort of the texture of a (corn)bread pudding.

Great recipe. Was a hit at our christmas party. The only thing different I would do would be to use a Spicy Enchilada sauce. The Jack I used wasnt very hot and so the recipe was not as spicy as I expected. But great flavors. Will make it again many times.

It was great. Not dry, colorful and warm and spicy. A great mid winter or autumn dish to warm you from the inside out.

This recipe was fantastic. Unfortunately, this recipe takes a long time to make. You have to make cornbread first, then crumble and put into the "corn pudding". Everyone at the BBQ loved it. It's well worth the extra time if you have it...

I haven't made the recipe (I felt I had to review it at 3 froks so that I wouldn't further drop its score), but if you put the curser on the name of the Chedder Buttermilk Cornbread, it is the link to that recipe. The corn bread is a seperate recipe.

It's a bit time consuming to make but the results are worth it. Made it for Xmas eve dinner and got some rave reviews. It did come out a bit dry, so I will add more milk and eggs the next time I make it.

I am confused too. What corn bread. How did all you others make it ignoring the corn bread?

I want to make this recipe but I am confused...it says to cut corn bread into 1" cubes...what corn bread? and how much?

Served this last weekend as a side dish, it was truly to-die-for. Although many steps, it was easy to make and very tasty. Everyone had seconds. I did add a bit extra buttermilk, as it seemed a bit dry, and the dish turned out moist (but not soggy) and very rich.

I am a cook at the KAPPA SIGMA football fraternity at HOBART COLLEGE in NEW YORK. I came across this recipe and thought the guys would like it. Like it? I have to fix this dish with grilled chicken served with the roasted red pepper sauce that was grouped with this reipe in the book. Awesome ! Awesome!!Three times a month I am asked to cook this meal.

I made this dish last Christmas for our Christmas dinner and will be making it again this year! It is good as a side dish or could stand alone with a salad. I agree that it is even better the next day.

This was absolutely delicious - I didn't have the spicy Monterey Jack - so I just added some hot sauce - and WOW - was it amazing!!! The corn bread is REALLY easy to make and is delicious just one it's own or with a bowl of soup!

Great recipe for a party. Yes, I did add extra buttermilk, another 1/2 cup, extra enchilada sauce, another egg, and extra green onions. I think it needs to be made a day ahead for all the flavors to blend.

After you add the extra egg and buttermilk- this is just delicious. I'll be making it again and again.

This one's a keeper. After reading the reviews I went ahead and added an additional 1/2 c buttermilk and 1 egg, which I whisked together and then poured over the top of the pudding after it was already in the baking dish. It came out perfectly. This would be a great dish to serve for Thanksgiving or Christmas!

I made this recipe exactly as written. To begin with, the Buttermilk Cheddar Cornbread is the best cornbread I have ever tasted. The final dish is very good, but I agree it could use another egg and a little more milk. Again, this dish was really good and my husband raved, but it was pale compared with the cornbread itself, just out of the oven.

This was very good, but it needed more moisture IMO. Next time I make it I will add more buttermilk and possibly an additional egg. The flavors were wonderful, however, and my guests raved. Can use any cornbread recipe with this, as long as the quantity is the same.

I really liked this corn pudding. The flavor was great. I would maybe add a little more spice to it next time. I only made half the recipe for two plus leftovers and it was the perfect amount. I was worried because I thought the cornbread itself was a little bland, but the final product (the pudding) was very good!

This was really good! The only thing I might do differently next time is add a little more liquid (more buttermilk perhaps) so as to make it more "puddingly-like" and less dry. But overall, it was great!

This is the best corn pudding I've tried. It's very colorful and full of flavor. It was a huge hit at dinner with several guests going back for seconds!

This corn pudding is delicious. Wonderful flavors and textures. It is not too spicy...just right.

This was delicious! I will definitely make this again

Just like the recipe says, it's a crowd-pleaser. Different from the usual fall "corn" recipes (at least up here in New England). Nice twist, easy to make especially if you make the corn bread a few days ahead and freeze.
