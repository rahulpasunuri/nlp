Gobsmacking! Amazing! Didn't even think I like figs, a definite keeper and the company loved it too! Have made it half a dozen times to raving reviews.

This was awesome. We meant to have a few of these with a glass of red wine, then make dinner ... but these were so good that we ended up finishing them, and never got around to cooking supper!

I recommend doubling the amount of cheese/butter, and drizzling with honey instead of olive oil - terrific!

Four forks for the combination of great taste and incredible ease. How can something so yummy take so little time?

This was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly as it appeared. It was very easy. My cheese monger offers both sweet and aged gorgonzola. I decided to use the aged which is much saltier than the sweet. It is a nice balance with the sweet figs.

Three words - Over The Top! My husband and I gobbled up these tasty treats. I followed others advice. I brushed top side with olive oil, broiled that side, then turned over and completed recipe as described. I can't wait to make these for guests!

It takes a little bit of getting used to, but this recipe is incredibly addictive.

Two words - gobbled up!!! Literally gone in minutes.

Very good - Simple yet stylish. I've made this a couple of times and my guests have always enjoyed it. However, the toasted baguette slices can tend to be quite hard, so next time I will do as another reviewer suggested and lightly brush one side with olive oil prior to toasting to see if that helps.

I made about 25 crostini, and literally four people ate the whole plate in a matter of minutes. Definitely a crowd pleaser, and something different from the regular crostini.

Easy and delicious, assuming one likes both figs and a blue-veined cheese. Two of us polished off the 8 baguette slices. As well as an appetizer, this should make a good fruit and cheese savory for after dinner rather than a sweet dessert. Good anytime, we think, and has a certain amount of sophistication.

As Simon Cowell would say, "Good, not spectacular." I have other bread recipes that are better than this one, but I would make it again to change it things up a bit.

I have been making tons of different fresh fig recipes all weekend (salads, desserts, appetizers, etc.), and this one is the best. Serve it piping hot!!

So easy to make! The only thing I did differently from the recipe was brush the bread slices with olive oil first and then toast them on one side in the oven - it keeps the bread a little softer. Then, I topped the un-toasted side with the Gorgonzola & butter mix and then broiled as directed. Good stuff. And I agree, Pears ARE a good substitute.

I love this recipe. The only thing I do differently is omit the olive oil drizzle.

This was so easy and delicious! i could not find fresh figs at the market, so i used pears that i sauteed for a few minutes in olive oil and skipped drizzling oil over the final product. They were gone within minutes!

Such a great combination of flavors! Be sure to be generous with the gorgonzola spread; ours came out too dry because we didn't use enough.

Yummy...have made this twice. The first time I added a small thin piece of proscuitto to each. (Great, but I may have been gilding the lily...)The next time, I made it exactly as in recipe and it was terrific, fresh figs were so fresh.

For the crostini, I used Italian cheese bread, and I oiled it and grilled it on the BBQ. I also made the figs a bit more flavourful by putting them in the bowl that I used to mix the gorgonzola and butter, and tossed them in the olive oil in the bowl so that they picked up the bowl dregs and were finely coated in olive oil. My guests raved. One guest suggested that if figs were hard to come by, this would also be good with some sliced pears that had been sauteed lightly in olive oil to an al dente level. Good idea. I'll try it.

This is great when figs are in season. I also have used this recipe on a Boboli pizza shell instead of Crostini, and cut up in squares. It's a great way to save time!

Both easy & delicious. I used fresh dates instead of figs.

Maybe our figs weren't ripe enough, but this didn't come out well. The figs only contributed in appearance, not in flavor. The crostini also got a little greasy from the butter and the cheese. I wouldn't make this again.

Classy and delicious. This was a hit at my party! Will definitely serve again. The fresh figs and gorgonzola paired perfectly. HINT: use DOLCE gorgonzola for a sweeter taste than picante.

As noted in the recipe, the flavor combination was great!!

Quite delicious. Everyone loved it! Quite easy to prepare.

This is an easy, but very elegant and delicious appetizer. When I cannot find fresh figs (or they are too expensive) I have substituted dried figs or fig preserves (the dried are best). Everyone who has tried this has loved it!!!
