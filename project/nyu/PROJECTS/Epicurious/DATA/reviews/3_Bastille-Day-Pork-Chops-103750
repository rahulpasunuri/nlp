And dont forget that a Bastille Day feast deserves to be paired with a nice French-styled wine! To celebrate French Independence and the freedom to enjoy wines that you like, declare your Vindependence at www.Vindependence.com!

Worked pretty well with garlic. I plan to use some of the variations other people suggested.

Tried this once as is and it was just fine. Next time added onions, garlic and lime juice and blended the marinade in a food processer. It was much better. It had more of a Carribean,third world bend to it. I view this recipe as a starting point for perhaps more interesting variations.

This recipe was just okay. I used dried rosemary for the fresh and I grilled it indoors. It looks better on paper than on my plate. Wouldn't make it again.

This was suitable 'gourmet' fare for a family dinner with someone who won't eat what he can't spell and is on a severely restricted medical diet. I usually don't care for pork chops..at the very least it was better than suffering through another pork chops and applesauce routine.

These were fabulous, we grilled them for Bastille Day. We put a little (minced, from a jar) garlic and we think it made all the difference. Will definitely make again.

I love this one! it's one of my barbecue staples now. Sometimes I add garlic, sometimes not. It's important to use fresh herbs, regardless.

We found this dish to be very bland. There are much better pork chop recipes on epicurious. I will not be making this again.

I also added garlic (a must in our household), salt and pepper during the marinade process, and these chops turned out great. I used bone-in pork chops and the little bits of fat (as bad as that sounds) added so much flavor to the chops when grilled. Served it with Twice Baked Potatoes with Goat Cheese and Chives (also from Epicurious) and sauteed green beans. Delish! I'll definitely make this dish again.

Delicious. I used the double thick pork chops instead and cooked them medium high on my gas grill for 8 minutes a side. The only minor change I did was to rub them with fresh garlic before covering them with the herbs for marinating. I used pork loin chops.

I must admit, I was skeptical about this recipe since it required so few ingredients, but it surpassed my expectations! So tasty! Make sure to add Kosher salt in the marinade process. Excellent with parmesean and rosemary polenta!

excellent - i used fresh rosemary, thyme & oregano , and lots of fresh ground pepper. rubbed the chops with an unsalted garlic pepper blend prior to letting them marinate for 4 hours. cooked them in the broiler - 5 min on each side (the chops were about 1 inch thick) - became herb encrusted chops. way excellent. perfect dish for entertaining; excellent with a viognier & rosemary potatoes and wilted spinach with mushrooms sauteed in garlic, lemon & fresh tarragon.

This was GREAT... I made it with fresh oregano and rosemary, and used 3/4 inch boneless center-cut chops. I salted and peppered the chops liberally before rubbing with oil, and salted again just before grilling. Juicy, delectable, and simple to make.

I went out on a limb for a Bastille Day party and made this without having tasted it before. I multiplied the recipe by 8 (24 servings) for my party. I used thyme instead of rosemary since I had them fresh from my garden (they're so similar) - left the chops in the marinade for 4 hours until the party. My husband grilled them, and after tending to my guests' drinks I went to the buffet table to get one.. ALL GONE. I will certainly have to make this again, it would have been nice to taste it!!

This was marvelous, and so easy. I have a new weeknight staple. I did add one clove of garlic to the spice rub (I'm mad for garlic), but I think it would have been just as delicious without. With a fresh salad and crusty bread, this would be perfect for a summer dinner party.

This is a very good recipe. I love pork and I was trying to find another way to fix it and this is it. I recommend it to everyone.

I was looking for a new recipe to use for grilling center cut pork chops, when I found this one. I have been using this recipe for well over 25 years and it is STELLAR! My search is over.. I am sticking with TRIED AND TRUE! This is an easy and delicious recipe. Try serving your grilled chops with the Roasted Cauliflower with Garlic recipe found here (www.epicurious.com) and if you can find or make an Asaigo Cheese Foccia Bread, and fresh corn on the cob or a chopped greens salad and a simple viniagrette. VERY nice!

I didn't have enough rosemary, nor was it fresh enough. However, it still came off with a wonderful flavor. I know having fresh rosemary will make it even better. The best was eating one cold the next morning - tasty!

The 8-hour marinade is what makes this a delicious dish. I used 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary leaves (whole), and 1 teaspoon of dried marjoram instead of oregano. I used a stovetop grill pan, heated it at medium high for several minutes. I grilled 4 minutes, precisely - each side. The pork chops were lightly pink, tender and juicy. I plan to marinade with a 1/4 cup of dry white wine next time for additional flavor.

I tried this recipe recently while on vacation at a beach rental. I was looking for something that did not require a lot of ingredients, and this fit the bill. I added some crushed garlic to the herb mixture, and served it with the tomato and bread salad from the "Grilled Chicken with Tomato and Bread Salad", omitting the chicken of course. It was a big hit with my family and guests, and I will definitely try it again. The best part was being able to access my Epicurious recipe box while on the road!

This meal was refreshing for a hot July eve: quick, light, juicy and tasty. Careful: these thin slices of pork cook fast. Added a little more salt than required to bring out more flavor. Enjoyed the simplicity of the herbs, serving the pork with a romaine lettuce salad sprinkled with balsamic & olive oil, topped with parmesan and tomatoes. Would probably make a good winter dish by adding some garlic mashed potatoes.

It was tasty, but not exciting.

To the Cook from Ocean City: this is a French dish. July 14 is Bastille Day in France - it commemorates the storming of the Bastille by the mob at the onset of the French Revolution (The Bastille was Paris's version of the Tower of London, it held prisoners who were "too important" for ordinary jail.). The prisoners were set free. The governor and the mayor of Paris had their heads cut off. The king dithered. And the citizens picnicked on Bastille Day Pork Chops!

To the other reviewer, I don't think this is necessarily an "Italian" dish; Mediterranean, perhaps. I was clued into this recipe by my friend Ruth (an excellent cook) in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. As she was too shy to submit a review, I will. The chops are simply excellent. The only change I made was to rub all sides of the chops with a cut clove of garlic. Also, I grilled them indoors, not over charcoal. Do try this recipe.

Very good! Is this an Italian dish?
