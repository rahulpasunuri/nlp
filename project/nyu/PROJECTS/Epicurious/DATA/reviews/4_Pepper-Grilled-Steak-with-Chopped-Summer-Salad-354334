amazing! i used two tenderloins. the star here is definitely the salad! I used French Feta, made from sheep's milk, which is superior, i think, to Greek for this salad.

This salad is excellent. I have made it several times and always double or triple the salad portion of the recipe now. It has wonderful, bold flavors. It makes for a great summer dinner.

This was the best steak salad I've ever had! My husband even liked it and he's not a fan of salad! He likes his steak with potatoes lol. I used spinach instead of arugula because I couldn't find it in our store. I've already shared the recipe with my family I know they will all love it like we did! It's going to be a summer favorite!!

Instead of peppering the steak, I marinated and it was delicious with the salad. Super easy to make and a really pretty presentation.

This recipe was amazing!! I tried it on my father who is very picky. I used spinach rather than arugala and I left out the onions. I also had some toasted fresh french bread to go with the meal and it was perfection! I will be adding this to my list of wonderful recipes to repeat. The jalepeno did not make it spicy as you might think, only added to the flavor:)

I made this for dinner on Friday night and could not believe how easy and delicious it was. I used a "Chuck Iron Flank" steak and the flavor was just incredible. I am not a fan of arugula, so used baby romaine, and that worked just great! I never realized how much flavor your could get by rubbing garlic on a steak! Made me glad that we stayed in for dinner!

I just fixed this dish for my family, and it was a BIG HIT! Full of flavor, a great summer dish, and easy to boot. This one I'll serve to the inlaws.

Very tasty... I would recommend less than 1 hour for the steak to absorb the garlic rub, maybe only 30 minutes - it was very good but I found it a little too garlicky in the end (and I love garlic).

Just wait until the "A Cook From Philadelphia" (2 posts below) follows the recipe. He/she will be in for a good treat.

I made this last night for my man and his best friend. We all loved it. The steak was flavorful and the greek-inspired salad was a perfect, cool summertime complement. I'm keeping this recipe in my top 5 for summer--maybe all year!

There was so much flavor in this, it was hard to believe that it was healthy! I made this by searing the steak on the stove instead of grilling; only had time to let the steak sit about 20 minutes, but it was still delicious. Used mixed organic greens instead of arugula, and quickly sauteed some white onion (to take the bite off) since we didn't have red onion. Also used sriracha sauce instead of jalapeno chile. It was quick to prepare and came out great - I would definitely make this again.

I made several modifications to this recipe to reduce the overall cost, but overall thought the mix of flavors and ingredients was good. I substituted blue cheese for the feta and olives and made a vinaigrette that included worchestershire which was a great compliment to the steak.
