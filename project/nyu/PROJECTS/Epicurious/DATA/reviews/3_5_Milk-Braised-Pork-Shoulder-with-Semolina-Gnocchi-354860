One more thing... put this in the oven at 275 not 350 and cook it for 3 hours. Richier softer sauce, meat that is much more tender!

Only 3 forks because this recipe is poorly constructed... the basic recipe idea is an old Italian one and if you take out the overabundance of liquids works. Wholeheartedly concur with a previous cook: halve all liquids! Two cans of tomatoes would be far too overwhelming and would mask the full flavor of the pork. BTW I did not puree the toms. I used San marazano crushed. 1 14.5 oz can still gave my dish the robust flavor. I can't imagine what 2 would have done. I still used 2 cups wine because... well it's wine. I did 2/3 of the rue and like everyone else worked out that tomatoes go in first. then I poured the milk into the roux wisking thoroughly and brought it to a slow simmer. This way when I added it did not curdle. I did not halve the other ingredientts. also did not do this over the semoline gnocchi it just felt too over the top with all the eggs and butter. I made pasta from scratch and cut it into pappardella size strips. this was a rich creamy voluptuous dish. Perfect and a little goes a long way. BTW I did not blend all my vegetables together in a cuisinart... I chopped each one so they did not end up like a one flavor pulp. I used half of the meat sauce and froze the rest for another day.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, although I omitted celery because I didn't have it. The milk did curdle slightly, even though I added it after the tomato puree as others suggested. It didn't seem to make a difference after 2 hours in the oven. Overall there was too much sauce, it seemed pretty Americanized. Kind of reminded me of Indian butter chicken sauce without the spices. Also attempted the Gnocchi, which did not set properly. Would not make again.

The intro says you have to start this 2 days in advance which is not the case. You only need to start it 1 days in advance so don't pass this up if you want to serve it tomorrow. You still have time.

Deelicious! Add some bay leaves and a clove of garlic with the veggies. To avoid the curdling, add tomatoes first like everyone else. Make the roux and warm the milk up with it and then pour slowly into the pot. Lovely.

Okay. I have made this dish twice now, and the curdling of the milk is due only to a criminal misstep in the recipe. If you add the tomato puree first, then add the milk slowly, this is one of the most wonderful expressions of pork I've ever encountered, both on the plate and in the mouth.

This is an amazing recipe- perfect for fall. I serve as a first course with a big salad and it is worth rave reviews. Also perfect for entertaining since it can be made ahead. It freezes well and can be served over linguine as an easy and cost effective alternative to the gnocchi.

This is an outstanding dish that bursts with flavor. The sauce is heavenly. I, too, made a few minor modifications, using a whole bone in roast and reducing the amount of liquid. It is not difficult but requires advanced planning. It is worth the wait.

I had never tackled anything like this before (braised meat, never mind pork) but my poor Italian boyfriend was lamenting his team's early defeat in the World Cup and I thought "I better braise some pork". It was SO GOOD, and a bit time consuming but simple, he said he hadn't eaten his ghnocchi so slowly since his grandmother made. The pork shoulder was incredible!

I really love this dish--have made it several times. But like others I do make modifications. The first and the most commonsensical is the oven temp. Braises shouldn't cook at 350. They should be at 300, or 275 really. It means you need to cook the dish longer (add an hour), but it produces a more tender meat and a mellower sauce. The second is that I halve the liquid ingredients and the roux: two cups of milk, one cup of wine, one can of tomatoes, 1/4 cup of flour, 1/2 a stick of butter. The quantities in this dish simply drown and overwhelm the pork in my experience. Finally, I don't dice the meat. It isn't really a braise if you use diced meat (it's a stew). I season the bone-in pork shoulder whole (bones mean flavor and body), and put it in the braising medium whole, and cut it after it has finished cooling. This makes draining the cold hard fat MUCH easier, by the way. I don't cut down the cinnamon or the mirepoix; even when halving the liquid, I still find I have more than enough sauce to go around. That said, this is a really special dish that will please a lot of palates with its surprising and original flavors. I make a lot of braised pork dishes, and this may very well be my favorite.

Uber rich but worth a case of Tums! Reverse the addition of the tomato puree with the milk and you eliminate the curdling. AND add the milk SLOWLY! If you plan on eating the day of, start skimming the oil slicks off the top at about 1.5 hours into the braise; the fat should be rendered by then. I plated with pasta-isle gnocchi and sauteed baby carrots for texture.

This is a new favorite in my household. I consider the cinnamon to be the "secret ingredient." I actually used an extra 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and I love the way it brings out the natural sweetness of the tomatoes. I made just a few other minor changes: After browning the pancetta and sauteing the vegetables, I removed them from the pot and browned the pork in 3 batches with olive oil to get some nice browned bits. To make the pork extra tender, I cooked at 300 for an hour, then turned to 250 and cooked for about 2.5 hours longer. After the first hour, the sauce seemed too thin, so I removed the lid for the remainder of the cooking. Regarding the curdling: I used ultra pasteurized organic milk, and it curdled only a little bit. Maybe this is part of why my sauce was thin, but it looked and tasted great! For the gnocchi, I agree with the reviewer who said the mixture is way too thick to whisk after adding the semolina. I added only about 2 cups of semolina because it became difficult stir at all. The gnocchi tasted wonderful, but next time I will cook them in a hotter oven to get more browning. This is a great recipe, highly recommended.

I halved the recipe and still off the charts. Served it with a side of sauteed swiss chard finished with garlic/shallots/red pepper flakes.

I loved everything about this except the cinnamon. The dish is really fantastic, but I found the cinnamon off-putting, and had to add a fair amount of excess black pepper and hot red pepper flakes to mask it in my first batch. I omitted the cinnamon from my second batch and was thoroughly pleased with the results. I does come out a bit thick, but that was fine with me...it's a ragu after all. Have made it 3 times since!

I made a few modifications.I sauteed the pancetta, vegetables and pork separately and removed them from the saute pan. I reduced the 2 cups of wine in the same saute pan and then added only 2 cups of milk. Yes, it curdled. I added the tomato and the roux. I then pureed the mixture with an immersion blender-smooth sauce and very tasty indeed. Now, it is cooking in my oven for use at tomorrow's dinner party.

The flavor of this dish is excellent, but I had a few problems making it. When I first read the recipe I thought, "pouring milk into wine is definitely going to cause the wine to curdle." When I poured the milk into the wine, it definitely did what I expected. So the sauce is kind of offputting to look at, since the milk is curdled. It tastes fine, though. Also, my sauce didn't thicken. It was very watery. That's not really surprising considering the 12+ cups of liquid. I guess the roux is meant to thicken the sauce more or I was meant to reduce the sauce (though this definitely isn't mentioned in the directions). One more problem I had was that once I whisked the semolina into the milk, I'm told to whisk in the egg yolk, cheese, and butter. However, the mixture is so ridiculously thick at this point that whisking is impossible. The wires of my whisk just bent as I futilely tried to incorporate the egg yolks. Maybe a flat whisk would work better, but I ended up using a wooden spoon. By the time I got the useless whisk unglued from the semolina, the yolks were already starting to cook in the hot mixture. It was a mess. For a recipe this labor intensive, I felt the instructions were too vague. It did taste good, but I would not fuss with making it again.

Lovely, tender pork, but I was put off by the sauce. Too reminiscent of canned cream of tomato soup for me. I much prefer the Saucy Country-Style Oven Ribs from this site.

This recipe had good flavors, although I found the thickness of the sauce a little off-putting. It is also very time-consuming, though I think it would be fine to eat without letting it chill overnight. I follwed the recipe exactly, but made polenta squares, instead of semolina squares. The polenta was surprisingly good with the pork stew.

Fantastic recipe. It's a rich red sauce but a little different due to the pork, the cinnamon and maybe the roux. I accidentally bought a bone- in pork butt so used my slow cooker for 11 hours once the sauce was made. I finely chopped the veggies but didn't puree. I used crushed tomatos to avoid pureeing there too. You can definitely eat it the day it's made. We had it that day and the next and it was the same. A beautiful dish that's worth the time!

I really enjoyed this and will definitely make it again. As usual, I didn't read carefully enough before making so I didn't start early enough. I let the pork sit with the rub for about 8 hours. I served everything immediately when the pork was done (rather than 24 hours later). I still thought it was delicious. I will make this again and follow recipe exactly which I am assuming will enhance the flavors.

Very good. I used pork loin instead of shoulder and did not do step 1 (rub pork with salt/cinn and chill over night). I braised pork, then slow cooked in oven at 250 for 3 hours in cast iron pot with 2 cups milk. Let that cool overnight and then followed recipe from closely, using remaining 2 cups of milk per recipe. Flavor has hints of Cinncinnati (nutmeg and cinn) chili without the hot spices. Family of 5 really enjoyed it and told me to make it again.
