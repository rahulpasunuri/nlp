I haven't made this recipe, but I have made a similar one that includes much more filling and is quite delicious. Essentially, you stir fry onions, garlic, and peppers (mild green and jalapeno or anaheim). Toss in some cubed zucchini or summer squash - cook until soft. Add VERY well drained crushed tomatoes and a can or two of kidney or black beans. Season it all with a cumin, chili powder, and a bit of ground red pepper. Pour the whole mess into a oiled pyrex baking dish and sprinkle it generously with monterrey jack cheese. Mix up a packaged cornbread mix (I like arrowhead mills) and spoon it over the top of the filling - spreading to sides. Bake according to cornbread instructions until it is brown and toasty on top. Serve with sour cream and cilantro. Quite delicious. By the way, for those looking for a real "tamale", you only find those in the homeland, or in the kitchen of little Mexican grandma. This recipe is certainly not the real thing, but it is good.

This would have been good had it not baked up to be a wet,cold in the center mess.I was looking for exactly what the name said it was..and it wasn't.Don't waste the time making a 'fake'!

I found this recipe to be bland and boring. The sauce tasted horrible and the tamale did not taste like a tamale at all....

I added a small can of chopped green chiles and next time I'll add some sliced olives and reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup. I lined the baking dish with foil so the "pie" could be easily removed. I could not believe how easy and good this was.

If you are expecting the outcome to taste anything like an authentic tamale you will be disappointed.

Although this recipe sounds interesting, it is a far cry from the delicious Mexican tamales I tried in Mexico not long ago. My husband and I put some queso blanco, salsa, jalapeno peppers, cuitlacoche to make it tastier but it was still bland. I wont make it again because any recipe that needs to be altered this much is not worth it.

I made a few changes and it came out great!! I skipped the sugar (corn is already sweet) and I don't like my meal sweet. I added almost half a jar of hot salsa to the tomato mixture which gave the sauce an extra kick. I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. I also peeled two medium yellow potatoes, diced them, pan fried them in a pan with a little oil until they are cooked and added them into the corn mixture and baked it. My boyfriend loved this dish. I have made it twice and will make it again and again.

This was delicious and easy to make! I added jalapenos and substituted a vidalia onion for the green onions. I also added a little salsa to the tomato mixture for an extra kick.

Next time, I'm going to cut the sugar in half. Might even skip it. Will prbably add some jalepenos to the batter for some heat. I let the sauce cook down for about 20-25 mins--very thick and tasty.

This is a great recipe. I figured out the Weight Watcher Points and for a fourth of this recipe, it is 7 points. That is really good, and it is a very satisfying dish.

Easy to make, with great results. My boyfriend rarely gets excited about food (can you imagine!?) and he really liked this. I served it with a yummy bean salad.

I substituted masa harina for the corn meal because I had run out of regular corn meal, and that worked fine. Great corn flavor. The tomatoes lacked something, so I added ~ 1 cup of mole that I had leftover from another recipe. That made it great. Serve with a Caesar salad.
