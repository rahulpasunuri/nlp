This is a yummy stew, except there are a few too many dried plums (pitted prunes) for our family's taste.

This was good, not great. It ended up really soupy... added a lot of flour to make the sauce thicker.

Great flavor. We enjoyed the sweetness but changed a few things. Used two cups dried cherries and 2 cups dried plums and only added the brown sugar. Also, grocery stores in area didn't have lamb so I used beef cubes. Lastly, only cooked meat and broth for 20 minutes before adding vegetables. The beef was very tender. If I had cooked it as long as the recipe instructs to cook the lamb, the beef would have been over cooked. Will definitely make this again.

This was very good. I would reduce the sugar/fruit next time as it was a little sweet for my taste. Made it for the Book Club discussion of The Hunger Games in honor of Katniss and served with good breads (Peta) and cheeses (Prim). The girls in the book club loved it.

Made this for our book club discussion about the Hunger Games. Of course accompanied by interesting breads (Peta) and cheeses (Prim). Was very delicious stew but would reduce the sugar/fruit as it was a little sweet for my taste. The girls in the book club loved it tho.
