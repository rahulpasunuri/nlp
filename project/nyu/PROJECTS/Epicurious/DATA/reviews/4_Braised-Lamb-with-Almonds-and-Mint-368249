I cooked it for 1 hour total as the liquid evaporated quite quickly

Delicious. I added portobello mushrooms and served over gnocchi. Plenty of gravy.

Really enjoyed this for a winter meal---as suggested below, used boneless leg as there was no shoulder available. Served it on a deep platter, surrounded by mashed potatoes with horseradish and steamed green beans with lemon butter. The sauce is more like a rich gravy--we ate well!

Thank you Matthew from Boston for requesting this recipe from Dali (one of my all time favorite restaurants)! I hope you get a chance to read these reviews and try it yourself. I'd love to see how it comes out in your kitchen!! Can't wait to try it myself!

Wow-this was delicious. My whole family loved it. I made it in the slow cooker. I browned the lamb, cooked the onions, added the wine, spices and broth etc. in the insert on the cook top, then set the slow cooker for 2 hours on high and 7 hours on low. After that I added the carrot and set it back to high for 30 minutes before finishing with the herbs and garnish.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! The flavors were so well developed and yet it was a relatively simple dish to make. I used smoked paprika which added good depth. I served the lamb (and sauce!) over couscous, accompanied by a spinach salad with lemon/mint dressing. Everyone loved it!

I had never cooked lamb before but decided to try this recipe. The whole family, including the kids, LOVED it. I used a boneless leg of lamb on my butcher's recommendation, which turned out well, and served it over noodles. I suspect you could even do this one in a crock pot... ? I'll definitely be making this again!

I found this very easy to make. Extra peas is a good idea. Works well over noodles, but we like mashed potatoes the best. Excellent use of shoulder cuts.

This was truly amazing. Broth was velvety and delicious, lamb falls apart in your mouth. Added more peas because I like some extra green, but otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.

I saw this in this month's BA and thought "I have lamb". We bought a local whole lamb this year and I had a lot of the less prime cuts cut into stew, and used the bones to make stock. Anyway, made this last night, substituting only the chicken stock for lamb stock. My husband squirreled away the leftovers, labeled "lamb heaven". I think that says it all.
