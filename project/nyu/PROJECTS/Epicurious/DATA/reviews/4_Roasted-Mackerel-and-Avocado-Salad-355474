I make this with canned smoked mackerel filets and it works perfectly. Really great flavors.

Yummy. Mackerel goes perfectly with the avocado. Be careful with the Dijon--too much, and it over-powers the milder flavors, but with exactly a TBLS it gives it the right tang--a little less might do just as well. Great summer salad.

Really quite good. You could get away with less mackarel (this calls for a very healthy portion per person), and I added some extra avocado. Big hit at a dinner party!
