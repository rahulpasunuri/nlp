I like sun-dried tomatoes and risotto, both, so went ahead with this recipe using chicken broth and wine and Parmesan, etc. I added some asparagus. Probably won`t be making it again as it was just too salty and seemed to lack a certain depth or ingredient(s). But the main issue was the salt...it gave my tongue salt-burn.

This is a good basic recipe. Based on the comments, I reviewed the standard risotto rice to liquid ratio in my Italian cookbook and found that 3-3.5 to 1 is correct. I stuck with that and found the amount of liquid to be fine. If you are expecting it to have the texture of regular rice, you would need more liquid, I guess. I used oil packed tomatoes and replaced the soaking liquid with 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 cup broth. I the added wine to the pan as the first round of liquid. I also, steeped some saffron in the broth while it was simmering. These modifications probably helped a lot!

Not a bad risotto. I added asparagus and diced artichoke hearts. It adds more color to the dish and really completes the dish

Very tasty! Added the wine as others have suggested. Nice depth of flavor and texture. I served it with seared tuna and grilled zucchini. As with many risottos, this one tastes much more difficult than it is.

Very fast, easy and tasty. I used tomatoes packed in oil and vegetable broth with good effect.I've also made it with quinoa instead of rice and it was darn tasty.

This was very easy to make, tasty and fast. The recipe says not to use tomatoes packed in oil, but those were what I had and it works just fine.

Added a hunk of butter and feta to each serving and it was not bad. I have had more success in the past with a two-step method I picked up from Jamie Oliver's cookbooks, which tend to be tastier and more interesting flavor combinations than this one.

This is a very good, easy risotto recipe. Like a lot of the other reviewers, I had to use a lot more liquid than the recipe called for (an extra cup of broth and 1/2 cup of white wine) and it took significantly longer than 17 minutes to cook, but it was the end result was delicious and satisfying. I added a cup of sliced crimini mushrooms.

I made this recipe for the first time this week and it was simple and delicious. Although I did find that the risotto was too al dente with the recommended amount of liquid, I simply added about a cup more of water. The flavor was wonderful and the risotto texture was perfect. It was also a beautiful saffron color. If your risotto comes out brown, you may want to check on the quality of your sun-dried tomatoes. I will definitely be making this dish again!

This was alright. I followed the advice and added wine + broth. The dish has a lot of flavor but the appearance leaves something to be desired. The tomatoes color the whole thing brown. My husband exclaimed "it tastes good, but it looks like something pooped on my plate!". Hmm, not exactly what I was hoping for.

Rating: 3
Nice basic risotto recipe. It needs much more liquid as other reviewers have noted - I used dry white wine and a mixture of vegetable and chicken stock. I also doubled the tomatoes (well, I like them!) and used the ones bottled in oil rather than dried, using a little of the oil to cook the onion and garlic. Plus I always use loads of Parmesan!

This did not work for us and we had high hopes as we love sun dried tomatoes and risotto. Just a bland, mushy mess and we generally do risotto very well.

Really good recipe. We did doctor it like some reviewers mentioned. Instead of water we used 1/2 broth & 1/2 wine. At the end we also added 1T butter to add a little richness. Will definitely make again.

Ok, but not worth the trouble.

Great recipe! To make this dish creamier, add a lot more broth (about twice what it calls for). It's better if you use low-sodium broth, because the additional broth will add too much salt. When it says "moderate heat" make it moderate to the med-lo range...because otherwise the rice won't absorb as much broth before it evaporates.

The KEY to making this recipe work is to take out the water entirely and replace with 1/2 cup broth, 1/2 cup wine. Add the wine as the first liquid into the risotto. It adds a brightness and richness that are essential. Make sure that you don't overcook the risotto into a gruel. I really like mine al dente... with the slightest bite in the rice. With the addition of wine, this recipe becomes perfect... A favorite in my house!

This was delicious! I was a bit nervous as it was my first ever risotto, but it worked out fine, after I followed others' advice and added an extra 1.5-2 cups of broth , allowing it to soak up much more liquid than the recipe calls for. I also added a cup of parmesan, which worked well. I'll be trying this again!

It makes a great meal. Its also quite quick and easy. I added a lot more parmesan- about half a cup and it tasted even better. I would definitely make it again.

Really not that spectacular. Kind of bland. Added basil, but it was not really enough. Takes much longer and uses much more chicken stock than indicated in the recipe. Also, I suggest adding more parmesan.

Goes well with white wine. Try using marrow along withe the olive oil, not quite so healthy or vegetarian but delicious.

Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. It has a great flavor and a very creamy/buttery texture, just like risotto should. My one complaint was that the rice didn't quite plump as much as I had hoped. I'll try using more liquid next time to see if that does the trick!

This recipe is really tasty! I made it this past weekend for a group of 12 people and everyone loved it! The only changes I made was to increase the amount of liquid, which I did by adding 2 1/2 cups of white wine to the chicken broth the recipe already called for. This recipe is a keeper!

Love it. Wife and guests love it. Good place to start off, and can go nuts from there. Have reduced basil and added Sun Dried Tomatoes, Used Prociutto instead of Shrimp... whatever.

This risotto is excelent. I add some fresh tomatoes and I used more broth and time than the recommended and the results were GREAT! At the end I add a lot of basil and was very aromatic. Because my husband wanted to take part in the making we did a porcini risotto at the same time, and this combination was fantastic! Saludos desde San Francisco, Katy

I used vegetable broth and added just a little red wine to the stock as well. I also added fresh basil @ the end, good aromatic effect. As other reviewers commented, I used a lot more of the broth than the recipe calls for and the rice took at least 25 minutes to become "al dente".

Rating: 4
This is a very simple risotto to make and you don't need any special or hard-to-find ingredients. I'm not sure exactly how much chicken stock I ened up using, but it was definitely more than what was recommended. I would suggest having an extra can or carton of broth on hand, just in case you need it. My friends raved about this dish and demanded the recipe.

Rating: 2
Although this recipe tasted good, the technique needs work. I needed quite a bit more broth than the recipe called for to completely cook the rice. If you've never cooked risotto before, I would suggest doing a dry run before trying it on an important meal for timing purposes. Maybe draw from other recipes regarding the technique.

Rating: 4
This is the best! I added a pound of shrimp about 10 minutes before the rice was ready; I used cut up pieces and whole shrimps. This made it a main course, add some roasted asparagus and a couple of Trader Joe's crab cakes with lemon and tartar sauce and you've got a meal to rival any seafood restaurant.

Very easy to make though time-consuming (as all true risotto recipes are). I imagine making in the microwave would also be successful and less labor intensive. I thought it also looked beautiful - very reddish - great in comtination with veal chops and a green salad.

This was my first time making risotto and it was easier than I expected. I cooked it a few minutes more than recommended to make sure it was done and used about 1 1/2 cups extra chicken broth. I also added broccolini and some shredded gouda at the end and it turned out great!

Wow, this was soooo good!! I had only had risotto once in a restaurant, and I wasn't very impressed so I was hesitant to try this recipe. But I love rice and sun-dried tomatoes so I decided to give this a shot. I did make a few minor modifications based on the previous reviews-I sauteed the onion and garlic in a combination of sun-dried tomato oil and butter and added a splash (less than 1/4 cup) of cream at the end along with the parmesan cheese. I also used a bit more cheese and needed about one more cup of broth to reach the al dente stage of the risotto. It was fabulous. I was surprised at how favorful and tomato-y it was. I will definitely make this again and probably double the recipe. I am now a risotto fan. Thanks!!

I read the rave reviews of this dish and wondered how it could be *that* good. But it is! I made it verbatim...and did not see a need to add butter or half and half. This is truly wonderful and I plan to make it again and again with many dishes as an interesting and tantalizing side.

We made this recipe for a dinner for seven hungry college students, so we ended up doubling it and used about 6.5 cups of broth for the whole thing. Like other readers, we also used oil packed sundried tomatoes, and the results were still stunning. We used fresh summer squash (organic! small farm!), sliced into thin half moons, which added bit of interest to the risotto and made it taste sooo good. We also added a bit of butter to the onions.

I have to admit I make this almost weekly! I add a little wine in with the broth and add about a tablespoon of unsalted butter with the cheese. Absolutely divine!

This is my new favorite dish. It's like creamy tomato soup with rice in it. The suggestion to add a splash of half-and-half (or milk, for that matter) before the parmesan is a good one. The claim of 4 to 6 servings is definitely misleading; you might be able to serve six if it's a side dish, and four of the diners are small children. For hungry 20-somethings, it's more like two servings.

I was scared to burn the risotto (it was my first time), so I ended up stirring the dish for over an hour. Next time, I'll turn up the heat so it'll come out somewhat quicker. Delicious! My guests loved it, and it totally overwhelmed the main dish of the dinner.

I only had sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and those worked great. I still simmered them in water, chopped them and used the simmering sauce with the broth as called for. This recipe was fabulous....although it does not make very much so I will definitely at least double it next time.

A great diet recipe - tastes really creamy and sinful. It complemented a spicy/lemony chicken dish very well. I would say this recipe makes max 4 portions - we 4 stared glumly at the empty dish after serving it :)

This is an awesome recipe! I used 2 cups of veg broth and 1/2 cup of Chardonnay. I decreased the olive oil to 2 Tbsp, substituted Romano for the Parmesan, and was very generous with the chopped parsley which I mixed in. Served with marinated seafood chunks (tuna, sea bass, salmon & halibut), fresh asparagus and a green salad. We loved it! I'll be making this recipe again and again.
