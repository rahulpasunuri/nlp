I made this for a New Years Eve party last night. I didn't have enough basil for the marinade so I used half basil and half cilantro - other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I marinaded the shrimp for about 2 hours and then just grilled them. These were fantastic. I made the peanut sauce but I agree the shrimp by themselves were delicious. The sauce was good but I added a few things to it... vinegar, garlic and ginger... but the shrimp stood out on their own and the sauce was just a nice to have. A friend actually called me to the buffet table to tell me I HAD TO TRY THESE SHRIMP! :) There was a ton of food there but the shrimp got gobbled up. I will make this again. Easy and fast to make. YUM

The marinade is excellent! I made it without the peanut sauce because I didn't have time, but it was delicious alone. The sauce would be great but it doesn't need it.

Based on what I wound up putting on the table, I would give this 2 forks, but since I only made the sauce from the recipe and tossed buckwheat noodles with it, I'm giving it 3, since I think the sauce make a nice dipping sauce even though it made a rather mediocre noodle dressing. I followed the recipe precisely (about as precise as I ever do for a non-baking recipe, which is to say, I used all the same ingredients is approximately the right quantities, though I did not break out the measuring spoons). I added finely minced garlic and ginger since they weer present in the shrimp recipe but not jut the peanut sauce. Essentially, the sauce tastes like a jazzy sort of peanut butter. It was tasty but really needed a greater presence of something that wasn't peanut butter. I also disliked the foamy texture of it after running it in the food processor (perhaps the coconut milk contributed to this?). My boyfriend and I ate it, but we decided to toss the leftovers rather than try to brave it again another day.

I modified it slightly, added yet more garlic and ginger, my fish sauce is mild so more of that, too. I loved the flavor of the peanut sauce. Made some tofu the next day to dip it in!

i usually like to make a recipe more than once before rating it, but that was completely unnecessary with this fantastic dish! made the peanut sauce and the shrimp marinade the day before, so everything came together very easily. cooked excess marinade in a saucepan and spooned over chicken and rice the next day. i agree with previous reviewers that the shrimp is flavorful enough to stand on its own, but the peanut sauce adds a new depth of flavor that is not to be missed! also served the peanut sauce with the velveted chicken from this site (VELVET CHICKEN SATAYS WITH FRESH CILANTRO CHUTNEY). grilling doesn't get much better than this!!!!

Shrimp is great! For the peanut sauce, add 1 generous tablespoon apple cider vinegar or 2 tablespoons rice vinegar, and a HEFTY handful (about 3/4 - 1 cup, or half of a bunch of loose) of cilantro. Trust me, it's well worth your while!! We've had tons of compliments once we added those ingredients - GREAT dipping sauce for this recipe, as well as for any chicken stir-fry, or for kebabs of any variety. Great on rice alone, for that matter!

Made this the other night and it was great! I was in a rush so skipped the sauce and, due to a freak rainstorm, sauteed rather than grilled, but the flavors were wonderful. A hit.

I wasn't all that impressed with this dish. I did use cilantro instead of basil for the marinade, but it was the peanut sauce that made this a 2 fork instead of 3 rating (really, I'd give it a 2.5). I think I might follow some of the others and use the marinade of chicken. I'm up in the air as to whether or not I'd make it again.

This is my favorite shrimp recipe. They turned out so moist and flavorful they didn't even need any sauce. That being said, I made the peanut sauce on this recipe and wasn't too fond of it. It just seemed a bit bland, I added some extra sugar, fish sauce, ginger, and just whatever I had on hand to give it more kick. After I had frankensteined up this version the sauce got raves, I served it with the shrimp skewers and also with the shrimp summer rolls on this site.

I love peanut sauce,instead of the lime juice I used Kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass the result was a much more fragrant and sexy sauce if you will.

I used only part of the recipe... I made the peanut sauce and found it bland so I added fresh ginger and increased the lime juice. I also used pork tenderloin instead of shrimp which I served with a soba noodle salad with juilenne vegetables using the peanut sauce as the dressing!! YUM

This was excellent. Didn't even attempt the peanut sauce. Served on top of the coconut cilantro rice from this site. My guests raved over it!

I've made this wonderful recipe many times and it's always a big hit! The majority of reviewers are so right: any peanut sauce is totally unnecessary. These shrimp are perfection on their own. I usually toss a handful of fresh cilantro in the processor along with the rest of the marinade ingredients. And I've found that skewering the shrimp before marinating (2 to 3 hours tops) saves time. When those hungry guests arrive, you're ready to grill and enjoy!

Made this for a birthday luncheon, huge success. I didn't change a thing with the shrimp and marinade. Made a different peanut sauce based on previous reviews. Can't wait to make this again.

Excellent! After reading all of the reviews I decided to make both the shrimp and the peanut sauce as it was a new recipe for me. The shrimp is outstanding! I marinated it for 3+ hours and the flavor / texture was perfect. I used fresh basil and stuffed the measuring cup full as I wasn't sure. The peanut sauce was 50/50 - half of us liked it - the other half didn't and prefered the shrimp without it. Everyone asked for the recipe and i'll definitely make the shrimp again, and as for the peanut sauce - it's not the best and the shrimp really doesn't need it. A perfect meal for a hot/humid Wisconsin evening.

The peanut sauce was horrible. With a few adjustments I was able to fix it, but definately the poorest excuse for peanut sauce I have ever run across. I made the shrimp twice. The first time I marinated overnight (against my better instinct) as some other reviewers suggested. The shrimp were so mushy they were falling apart on the grill. Flavor was ok, but not good enough to overcome the texture. The next time I marinated them for 2 hours, and left 2 out of the marinade for a texture check. I next grilled them and this time the marinated ones were less mushy, but not as nice as the grilled unmarinated ones. The hickory chips added a nice smoked taste to the shrimp and in all honesty I liked the plain ones better then the marinated ones.First time I have ever been disappointed by a recipe from this site.

This makes a very tasty meal. I combined the peanut sauce with rice and the shrimp for a thai-style shrimp risotto, it was excellent. I used dried basil instead of fresh, which worked fine, but next time I'll use fresh. We loved it.

The peanut sauce for this recipe is excellent. It's just the right spicyness. All of my guests commented on how wonderful it was. I highly recommend. The shrimp part is great too. I used cilantro instead of basil. Very good!

This recipe is fantastic! If you skip the peanut sauce you're really making a big mistake! Be brave and use all the ingredients including the fish sauce...it can be found in any asian market. This recipe is very "Thai"...step out of the ordinary and into the extrodinary!!!!

This is perfect without the peanut sauce! If you can't grill it: put all the marinade and shrimp in a baking dish. Bake 4 minutes on each side at 350- serve over rice! *No Fresh Basil- use 3-4T dried.

This was a flavorful and easy shrimp dish. I ended up marinating overnight- which could have been good for the flavor. Also, very fresh basil helped for a strong flavor. A good blend of flavors- no one flavor overwhelming. I skewered them and cooked in the oven at 350 (4 minutes on each side. Based on time and recommendations from others, I skipped the peanut sauce. Although it looks like a good recipe that I will try, the shrimp really did not need a dipping sauce.

Great recipe! Easy to make and very delicious. This is the first time I've ever rated a recipe, but it was good! I used cilantro instead of basil. There was so much marinade leftover that I cooked up some chicken and added it to the sauce and ate that for a few more meals.

We made this as part of a dinnerparty. Very good and will make again. We enjoyed the peanut sauce with it, but enjoyed on its own wonderful. Go ahead and make!

Didn't make the peanut sauce either, but the shrimp were terrific. Made the recipe more Caribbean by omitting fish sauce and adding fresh thyme and allspice and serving with mango salsa and coconut rice and Mojitos. I have no doubt the shrimp would be excellent as the recipe is written and will try it that way, too. The marinade really clings to the shrimp and they look very appetizing when cooked with the flecks of fresh herbs.

The shrimp in this recipe is great, but I would have to agree with everyone else about the peanut sauce. It is not needed. I've made this dish a few times without the sauce and no one even noticed anything was missing.

Shrimp excellent, peanut sauce BAAAAD. Skip the chicken broth and soy; add 2-3 cloves chopped garlic and 2.5 tsp. brown sugar; double the coconut milk, fish sauce, and lime juice. In place of hot sauce, try 1/2 tsp red curry paste.

Didn't make the shrimp so can't comment but the peanut sauce, which I served with chicken sate was ghastly...really bland and unmemorable as others mentioned...should have listened. Amuch better recipe is the spicy peanut sauce that goes with the spring rolls on this site.

These shrimp were delicious. We prepared it exactly as the recipe is written except that we didn't use hickory smoke chips in the BBQ. Very good, highly recommended

One of my all-time favorite grilling recipes!! If you have access to pecan trees, try using broken and soaked branches on your coals instead of the hickory chips. They seem to add a slightly more "smoky" flavor to grilled food.

I loved the dish as is.The lime flavor is somewhat hidden in the marinade as written but thge marinade is well balanced and flavorful.We used applewood chips in place of hickory for the smoking.We also used medium shrimp. The marinade was more than enough for 20 oz. of shrimp.

While I would never make a major substitution and then give a bad review to a recipe, I'm delighted to report I substituted fresh cilantro in place of basil in the marinade and the results were very, very delicious and looked gorgeous, too. The recipe made enough marinade for a pound of shrimp and a package of chicken cutlets cut into long strips. I broiled the skewers in my oven and brushed the shrimp and chicken several times with the marinade during cooking. Even without the peanut sauce, the flavor is scrumptious, but with it, it's out of this world. I served plain steamed jasmine rice with it and the sauce trickled over the rice was sensational, too. I can't wait to follow a previous reviewers' suggestion of pouring the sauce over noodles. A word of caution: be very careful to NOT OVERCOOK the chicken as it'll dry out and toughen up.

Maybe I marinated the shrimp too long (half day). Although the flavor of the marinate was wonderful, we found it a little overpowering for the shrimp...and we both usually like really robust flavors. The peanut sauce was "okay." I tried it first just as the recipe was written...very boring. Tried doctoring from there, but never really achieved a wonderful result. There are much better (more authentic) peanut sauce recipes out there. I was expecting greater results from this recipe based on the rave reviews. Guess everyone's tastes are different though. :-)

A show-stopper! We had to substitute freshly-ground, all-natural peanut butter in the sauce, but it tasted great! We added more hot sauce (probably another 2 tsp!) which really helped. Delicious and dramatic on the BBQ.

OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!! We loved this! I would make it in a heartbeat. While I was making both the marinade and peanut sauce, I thought it would not taste good. "How could all of the others have liked this?" Even at the grill, I doubted. Alas, we were looking for more shrimp to eat. I also added cilantro and was pleased. I have saved the peanut sauce to try with asian noodles tomorrow.

This was very delicious and could easily be assembled ahead of time. I think it would be good as an appetizer. I left out the fish sauce and it was still wonderful!

I think the marinade is great- I turned it into a sauce by bringing it to the boil and then I added a slurry of arrowroot and chicken stock to make a really delicious green curry. I had substituted dried coconut milk powder with a mixture of stock and a splash of rice wine for coconut milk. The marinade shouldn't be reduced too much (for fear of compounding the salts) but it makes an exquisite sauce if you simply thicken it. We added a bit of hot chile and cilantro as well. We're looking for a better peanut sauce recipe though. This one is too "Stocky" and sweet for our tatstes. Use a good asian basil- this can be considered an asian "pesto" of sorts if you are drawn in that direction. Quite a good comination of flavors.

To quote my guests.......OH MY GOSH!!! This dish was a huge hit!!! I had several dinner guest coming and, giving consideration to the appetite of a "few good men", increased the shrimp to 1/3 pound per person, which was adequate. Took the suggestion of another write and added cilantro to the peanut sauce..it was great. Also used cilantro to the shrimp with about a 75/25 ratio basil/cilantro. Wonderful flavor. Served with fresh pineapple/mango/cantelope salad, basil flavored corn and corn bread. Awesome and easy. I'm thinking TAIL GATE PARTY with football season on the horizon.

I marinated both chicken and shrimp in this marinade. The chicken was green, but delicious and everyone loved the shrimp. The peanut sauce was a hit, too. I added a 1/3 cup chopped cilantro into it and could have been more generous with the lime or chili paste. Yummy!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I let the peanut sauce sit for about 3 hours, the flavor improved with time. The shrimp marinated for quite a long time too. Delicious! Would serve this to guests warm or room temp.

An excellent appetizer and very easy to make! I live in an apartment so I broiled the shrimp in the oven, and it was fantastic; a grill is not necessary. The coconut and basil gave the shrimp an out-of-the-ordinary taste, though I would add a teaspoon more lime juice.

The Coconut Lime Shrimp was a disappointment but the Peanut Sauce is definitely a keeper! I just didn't think the flavors were picked up by the shrimp at all. The Peanut Sauce had a good flavor; relatively light flavors so it would probably be best with lighter meats such as shrimp.

Yummy! My guests at a recent dinner party really liked this one .... I did find the original recipe for the peanut sauce a bit bland since I couldn't taste the coconut milk so I added some additional coconut milk (1/2 cup)and 4 TB of brown sugar. The sauce also tasted better after I let it sit for a few hours -- that seems to enhance the flavors.

What a disappointment! I am surprised this is so highly reviewed. The peanut sauce was so bland. A Taste of Thai makes a sauce mix I buy at the grocery store that I think is much better, and all you do is mix it with a can of coconut milk. The marinade was good, but, I didn't really think it was worth the effort.

Oh-my-gosh, this is soooo good! The shrimp alone were fantastic, so good that no one wanted to dip them at first and then, we did and WOW! Excellent! I used a pound of shrimp. We had some peanut sauce left over so the next night I cooked up some chinese dumplings and tossed them in the sauce - I added a bit of water (approx 1/4cup)and some extra chilies and that was amazing too. Definately a keeper!

I didn't have the fish sauce, so I used a little more soy sauce. It was delicious.
