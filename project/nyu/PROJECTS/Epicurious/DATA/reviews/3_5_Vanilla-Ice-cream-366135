Disclaimer: I do not like custard style ice cream and I feel this recipe is just that. I was concerned therefore I used only 4 yolks and it is still too custard- y for my taste. IF you do like that style, this is a great, easy recipe and the texture and vanilla accents are nice.

Made it last night, and it was excellent. Accidentally left out the vanilla extract, but it would've overpowered the ice cream had I left it in. Left it in the fridge overnight to soak up the flavour of the vanilla bean, and it worked out well. For heating: I heated the yolk-milk-cream-sugar mixture for 5 minutes, at 85 degrees Celcius. That turned it the right consistency, without having the eggs solidify.

I have made this twice (doubled each time) and it has been excellent. However, I think the trick is using only vanilla beans instead of extract, if you want the richest flavor. For a double batch, that's two 5 inch beans, vacuum packed, so they're still moist and juicy. I also don't strain it, and don't find that's been a problem. Nor do I find it too eggy - yes, it's obviously a classic custard style ice cream rather than the newer cream cheese style, but even the egg haters in my family love it.

Substituted Almond Milk for Milk to reduce dairy. Substituted Blue Agave Nectar 3/4 C for the sugar Added Caramel Extract and cinnamon. Also added 1 tsp guar gum to give it a more firm consistancy.

We have made this recipe twice in the last month and it is wonderfully creamy and rich. We have tahitian vanilla beans from a recent trip and we love the flavor. It does have an custard flavor and therefore you need to be careful to not over cook the eggs while heating.

We just made this for a Fourth of July party and it was delicious. The texture was creamy and it froze beautifully. Instead of using a vanilla bean, we substituted a half teaspoon of ground cinnamon. It was great with apple pie as well as with ancho chile brownies. We are making it again tonight to have with strawberries and basalmic fudge.

This was too eggy for my taste. This should be called frozen custard because it has far too much egg to be considered an ice cream.
