To be truthful, I didn't make this recipe as it is, but used the lemon cake recipe for another good treat. I made the cake batter as directed, but pour ~1 Tbls of batter over a fresh blackberry in the center of a DeMarle mini canape pan. I then sprinkled then with a lemon powdered sugar by putting lemon zest in a food processor with course sugar, pulsing until smooth. They were a huge hit!

Meh... I wasn't impressed. The cakes were good, but nothing special. I would suggest against using blackberries - the seeds were annoying.

I made the cakes in muffin tins, and somehow they collapsed in to make a sort of mini pie crust. It tasted great with the berries inside the cupcake instead of on the side as a sort of single-crust pie, but I wish I knew why the cakes didn't stay risen. Next time maybe more baking powder?

this is a great summer treat. i used a bundt and put raspberries along the bottom of it so they would bake into the cake and be on top when removed from the form. it was beautiful! once it was done, i poked holes in it and drizzled heavy cream over it. then topped it with lemon sugar (sugar mixed with finely grated lemon rind). people asked for seconds and thirds!

This was awesome. One thing that I added was for the berry sauce add a little bi of yogurt with the mixture of sugar and berries. Secondly, you dont have to make the bundts by scrath you can just go to Ralphs or something and buy icing-less lemon cakes. I also used Angel Cakes instead of lemon cakes and i came out GREAT!!! I love this dessert and just make your own little twist to it to make it yours!

I made these for a wedding shower and had many people asking for seconds. If you use 5 oz individual molds, you do get 6. The cake is light and the lemon makes them quite refreshing after a large meal.

I followed the directions exactly and although the cakes were tasty they made six flat pancakes and not 6 cakes. Also the taste of the cakes was good but not great

Delicious! I used a bundt pan so I doubled the recipe. Also doubled the lemon rind. will definitely make again.

These cakes are simply wonderful! Ignore other reviews apparently she had the wrong molds for the cakes. Makes 6 just like it says. Negative reviews are just horrible on great dishes like this one!

These were fabulous, very easy to make, delicious and beautiful. However, the quantities called for in the recipe did not make 6 cakes if you followed the directions and filled the molds two-thirds of the way. I doubled the recipe and came out with 8 cakes. Doubling did not adversely affect taste, texture or anything else, though! The recipe worked fine at high altitude as well.
