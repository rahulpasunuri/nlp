Very, very nice. While I may have slightly over-baked the tart (it was not glossy on top), the end result was fabulous. Not sweet, a bit chewy, and a show-stopper when brought to a dinner party. The crust is worth the effort and I will certainly make this tart again. We ate it over three days and it was really good from start to finish!

I love this recipe and come back to it every Autumn. It's even a good addition to the Thanksgiving feast selections. The end result is a rich and delish combination of two faves - - chocolate and pecans. What more can you ask for?

I may have left this in the oven a few minutes too long, but it is a very rich, brownie-like concoction. Nevertheless, it was very well received. I used my own standard pie-crust rather than the cream-cheese crust called for without any problems.

Nope, the recipe for the crust is just too complicated for mediocore results. I didn't find this special in any way.

Absolutely fantastic! This is a must for chocolate lovers! I added a handful of melted chocolate chips to the filling to make it even more chocolatey. This pie is very rich, so you can cut smaller pieces than the recipe says and serve more people. One problem--I made the amount of crust the recipe suggested for a 9 1/2 inch tart pan, but it wasn't enough crust to fill my pan! I'll make a bigger crust recipe next time.

This is great as long as you aren't expecting a pecan pie with a touch of chocolate (such as a Kentucky Derby Pie). This is rather a gooey-chocolated-tart-with-pecans. Which, mind you, ain't bad ... warm with ice-cream or whipped cream, it's a delight.

This is a wonderful alternative to the usual clawingly sweet pecan pies that leave a metallic taste in the mouth. It smelled like tempting chocolate brownies when I took it out of the oven, but exploded with a roasted pecan taste and somewhat crunchy texture when bitten into. Golden syrup was new to me, but it turned out to add a delicate touch to the robust nutty and mildly sweet flavor. Perhaps because I usually make my own crust, I did not find the recipe for this flaky crust to be too difficult or time-consuming.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner with the family. Even the picky kids loved it! But will not make the cream cheese pastry crust next time. Ridiculous amount of work for the same end result!

Mr. Weeber, perhaps you missed this explanation at the beginning of the recipe; "For people who find even my less sweet Pecan Pie too sweet, or who are hopeless chocolate lovers, this is the answer. Cocoa perfectly tempers the sweetness of the filling and adds a full chocolate flavor that goes so well with pecans." At any rate, if you don't like chocolate why are you making a chocolate pecan pie?

No. What I mean is, I don't like chocolate and this crummy recipe just wasn't sweet enough. You'd think the author could have mentioned these rather important points in the description. But noooo. Let us waste our time and money making utter slop.

This is quite delicious. i made it for a party and it was a great hit. Though when I make it again I will not both with the falky cream cheese pastry.....way way too much effort. I like making my own pastry but his was too time consuming and didn't tast all that different.
