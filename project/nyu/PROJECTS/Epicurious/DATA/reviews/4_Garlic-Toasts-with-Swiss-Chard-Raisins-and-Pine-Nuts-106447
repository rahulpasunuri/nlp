i've made this four times now...finally getting around to reviewing it. it is perfectly delicious. i've made the toasts, and i've made it as a vegetable side. it marries sweet and savory so well! yum! i add a bit of goat cheese right before serving.

This is a great appetizer, and very easy to make! Perfect if you're looking for something a bit different for a summer cookout appetizer. We played with the recipie a bit and added 4 cloves of garlic -- and a dash of balsamic vinegar at the end. (We'd probably add a bit more tomato next time!)
