I hate to go against the grain, but I didn't care for this dish at all. There are so many other, more flavorful and equally easy ways to make veal cutlets. I don't know why I found this to be so "flat"--I used all fresh and good ingredients and added mushrooms to the sauce as well as garlic to the spinach as recommended by others and served it all with a small side of spaghetti but it proved to be just "so-so". Sorry.

REally great. Easy and better than in a restaurant. Made me feel like Emeril! I used paprika forte (half the amt I would have used if I had the sweet paprika) which gave the sauce more bite.

Nice little recipe that's quick & easy too. My friends enjoyed it very much.

This is an excellent dish. The flavors meld beautifully. For an extra touch, I sauteed a few large mushroom slices and arranged them on top of the sauce. I think this would also work well with boneless chicken.

A nice, simple dish for an easy romantic dinner.

Excellent dish. I substituted 2% cream with a couple of tablespoons of sour cream. result was terrific, however quite rich. Perhaps needs some citrus to tame it. Will try next time.

This is a good recipe. The key is the low salt broth. It's definitely too salty without that key element. I also cooked the spinach in garlic butter which added a little more flavour to the dish.
