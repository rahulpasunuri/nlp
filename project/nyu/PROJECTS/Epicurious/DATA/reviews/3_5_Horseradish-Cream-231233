haven't made the recipe yet, but why does it call for tarragon or vinegar? Does anyone know?

TO "A Cook from Carbondale, CO" I made this the day before and it held up just fine and I think it tasted better the next day. I did use the prepared horseradish for ease. I also whipped the cream stiffer than soft peaks because I used the prepared stuff and it was going to sit overnight.

As other reviewers, I made with lite sour cream. I also used prepared horseradish, which saved me the grating step. I was in a hurry, it was delicious even with the shortcuts.

Has anyone made this ahead of time? How far in advance could you whip it up?

This was way too salty--in CA we have Harris Ranch horseradish that we like quite a lot more than this homemade version.

A great horseradish sauce... served it with prime rib, and got rave reviews. The heavy cream instead of sour cream made it light and fluffy. Very popular, even with those who don't typically like horseradish. The only downside is, if you like strong horseradish flavor (like me) it's a bit mellow.

This is the best horseradish sauce I have ever had. Served on Christmas, and have made several times since. For ease and calories, I substitute light sour cream for heavy cream and it's still great.

Delicious, used bottled horseradish instead without the vinegar and it was fine. Great with the Pepper crusted London Broil. I loved the consistency of it, light and fluffy.

This was an excellent sauce to use with the Pepper Crusted Steak with Horseradish Cream. It complimented the recipe very well. The only sub I made was to use 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 cup sour cream. It was delish!
