Guys--simmer down. This is part of a fall brunch buffet menu with 8 dishes. The rosé is to go with the duck confit hash etc. Don't pollute the fork system unless you've actually made the recipe.

Too Funny! This should not be a seaprate recipe. If it belongs to something else put it there as an option, not as a recipe! I am looking for a recipe to make english muffins from scratch so finding this on epicurious is such a huge joke!

This recipe is a joke, right??? There's nothing like the "famous" muffins, and I do salt them as well.

I just checked out the "new recipe design" for this recipe. The suggested wine pairing is American Rose. Did I get this right? For breakfast I'll have eggs, english muffins and VINO! Wow!

The nooks and crannies are the best thing about english muffins. You don't even get that with this recipe.

Craggy holes, little nibbles.. Come on - break out the toaster.

Stale toast...Ooh so tasty!

This deserves zero forks for the mere fact that it takes 45 minutes to fully execute a recipe that can be done in 90 seconds, and with the same result, with a toaster.

Does anyone have suggestions for adapting this recipe to high altitude?

Thank you Tempe AZ. I've sweating it out trying to figure out boiling water. What would I do without this site?

marykay2 - to boil water for your tea, check out Salted Water for Boiling on this site. Then just omit the salt and you are good to go. Also, you might want to reduce the quantity of water as 4 quarts made entirely too much for my husband and me. :)

Now, now, everyone. It's a different preparation for English muffins, and perfect for serving with the "cloud" baked eggs from the same meal in Gourmet. No need to be meanspirited.

I just found a solution to the problem when I split an English muffin and it falls apart. I can slice it up and follow the instructions and who would ever know! Now I just need to figure out how to boil water for my cup of tea.

This cheered up a boring day at work immensely. :) What a completely useless recipe. Bravo!

You call this a recipe??? I ditto the review by the cook from NH. I'd give it zero forks if that were an option.
