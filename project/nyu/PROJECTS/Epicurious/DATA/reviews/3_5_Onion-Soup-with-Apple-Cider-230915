I have made this twicw this week during Hurricane Sandy & the aftermath. First of all, it is simplicity itself easily made with what I had on hand and simmered loving on the stove which we were thankfully able to light with out power. My children RAVED over this soup! Thank you for saving dinner!

This may sound ridiculous because it's an onion soup, but I prefer this recipe with about half the onions called for. You still a great onion/cider flavor, but not huge spoonfuls of onion. Like some other reviewers I use beef stock for a richer broth. I make this on the weekend & serve with the ham, apple butter, cheddar sandwich that's part of the suggested meal for quick weeknight fall dinners.

This was a huge hit with the group I made it for. We were away on a long weekend during apple harvest time & it was great for lunch after a visit to an orchard (we ate it along with the ham, apple butter and cheddar sandwiches from the same issue). The perfect meal for a chilly day.

I made this as part of a Swedish family dinner, served with Swedish meatballs. My family really enjoyed it(from teens to grandparents) and it was quite different from the typical french onion soup. I did make some changes due to ingredient shortages. I used 4 apples instead of apple cider. This gave a nice apple flavor that wasn't overpowering and a great texture. I didn't use thyme because I didn't have any. The soup came out savory and satisfying. This will become a staple in my house.

Very tasty and well-received by our party guests. The apple flavor was apparent but not overbearing. I used vegetable stock to make this vegetarian friendly. Also, topped this with toasted bread and shredded beaufort d'alpage cheese for a "French Onion"-type experience (for those who ate cheese). Definitely recommended.

Very sweet but delicious! Easy to make as well...

The cider gives an unexpected flavor boost. I made this twice - once by the book and it was good. The second time was even better by using a little less cider and substituting beef broth for the chicken as it gives a deeper, richer color and stands up to the cider better. Enjoy!

The saving grace for this soup was serving it with tho open-faced ham sandwich featured in the same issue. The saltiness of the sandwich tempered the sweetness of the soup.

after reading other reviews i had lowered my expectations, but i'm pleasantly surprised at this easy & de-lish recipe. I added a couple pinches of redpepper flakes to add another level of flavor over the sweetness of the apple, which added a nice subtle bite.

It was good, but not spectacular. I grated a little parmesan cheese over each serving, and that made it a bit more interesting.

This was good, but a little sweet for our tastes.

It's good, not great. I was expecting a richer, more complex flavor more along the lines of a french onion soup so I was slightly disappointed.

I prepared this on a chilly fall evening, and it was just what the night needed. I also toasted pumpernickel bread to eat along with it.
