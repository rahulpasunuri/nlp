My review is based on several changes, which I do know is a no-no in review-land...but here they are: Removed skin from chicken thighs and drums. Used Trader Joe's Sesame Melba toast plus cornflakes plus panko crumbs. Marinated for a couple hours in yogurt, milk, hot sauce and garlic mixture - made quite moist. I rated two forks for 'good' - whick is correct, not as fabulous as the real thing but good enough to satisfy a fried chicken urge in a reasonably healthy way - I am feeling real good about removing the skin!)

The Melba toast didn't do it for me. I followed the recipe to a T and thought this was pretty blah. Kids weren't impressed, either. Leftovers got unappealingly soggy.

I took another reviewer's advice and soaked the chicken in buttermilk for about 45 minutes before baking. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs (what I had on hand) and it came out great. I broiled the chicken for the last 5 minutes. The chicken was moist and the crust was crunchy. Will definitely make again.

Dear "Cook from Washington", I believe, if you investigate that you will find that Pam Anderson was associated with Cooks Magazine for a long time. Do you like crow better than chicken?

what a hack! This recipe is stolen from Cooks magazine -and also published on the back of London brand of Melba toast -credited to Cooks Magazine. It might not be exactly the same -but it's very close.

A nice treat! I used a 5 oz. box of herb seasoned croutons instead of melba toast and ignored the other seasonings. I plan to try it with Ceasar croutons and others I may find. Used boneless thighs and boneless breasts cut into quarters. Delicious!

I made this for my husband who is more of a junk food eater. He likes fried chiken, but raved about this one!!! I served it with some French string green beans.

Easy, kid-friendly recipe for a busy weeknight. Dried breadcrumbs were handy and came out crunchy enough for us. Moist - you don't miss the chicken skin.

I have made this recipe twice and it has become a "fried chicken standard" in our home, without the "fried". Soak the chicken in buttermilk for an hour and take the time to prepare the melba toast (don't substitute bread crumbs) and you will be pleasantly surprised. Family loves it and very low cal.

I've made this a few times. I soak the chicken in buttermilk for at least 1 hour before coating it (like my mom's REAL fird chicken). I found it very inportant to have the melba toast crumbs in many different sizes. It gives it more of a crunchy fried texture.

We favor low-fat foods for our dinners, & my poor family (husband & 7 finicky children) was getting tired of grilled chicken breasts. They wanted fried, but I just wouldn't give in. I found this recipe, & decided to give it a try. I started with egg whites, & I added extra mustard (honey mustard), as well as garlic & onion powders. I substituted seasoned breadcrumbs for the melba toast (who buys that stuff?). I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which I left rounded, rather than flattening them. I cooked them at 450 degrees for 30 minutes exactly. When they came out of the oven, my husband pounced on them & cut off a corner for himself - despite the temperature, he pronounced them wonderful. I don't know, maybe my poor family has been deprived of fried food for too long, but everyone raved about them (I convinced the three year old that these were just huge chicken nuggets!). They were moist & tender, & very flavorful. My teenaged son said this was the best chicken I'd ever made. They made me promise to make it again. I'd like to find a crisper coating, though... maybe a rice cracker crumb?

I have been looking for a lower fat, healthier version of chicken nuggets for my kids, so I made this with boneless chicken breast pieces. It's not bad, but rather dry, even though I only cooked the chicken 10 minutes. I think I will use mayonnaise to coat the chicken instead of egg, as it keeps the chicken moister. I also used a combination of whole wheat bread crumbs and panko crumbs, which worked well. I used the tip from another reviewer and stuck it under the broiler for a minute to crisp. The coating was very nice.

Well, this wasn't horrible, but I think my husband's description nailed it on the head... Shake and Bake!!

This is the first time I've tried an "oven-fried" recipe - delicious!!! I soaked boneless chicken breasts in buttermilk, and used Japanese breadcrumbs instead of melba toast (broiled the last 3 mins for better color). The seasoning is just right, I didn't notice the mustard at all and my picky husband loved it!

I don't know what the first reviewer was talking about but it must have been user error. I have made this several times with excellent and delicious results. I have cooked it a little longer than the recipe calls for and put creole seasoning or garlic powder in it. I've even made it with boneless/skinless breasts. Don't miss out on this recipe!!!

I used a variation of this recipe with honey mustard pretzel sticks. It made the chicken sweet, so if you use that form then add some more salt. Otherwise it was really good
