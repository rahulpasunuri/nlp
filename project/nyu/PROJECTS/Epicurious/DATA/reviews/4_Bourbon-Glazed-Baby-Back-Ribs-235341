This is, hands down, my family's favourite rib recipe and one of their top 10 overall favourites. Being Canadian, I make this recipe with Maple Crown Royal, instead of bourbon. I was out of molasses so I substituted dark brown sugar. They are FANTASTIC! I love the fact that I don't have to marinate them overnight.

This recipe has freed me from ever having to follow a recipe for baby back ribs again. I did use a spice rub, sprinkled some apple cider vinegar on them because I forgot the pineapple juice, and refrigerated for a few hours. Baked at 325 for about an hour and a half and then broiled (low broil) for about 12 minutes, turning and basting every two minutes. I mixed and matched on the glaze recipe, but I think as long as there's something sweet, something savory, something fruity, and something spicy in it, it will work. I did boil it down but forgot about it on the stove, so it got really thick. I added some more bourbon (actually, JD) and some apricot jam to loosen it up. It was so good and so easy. Next time I'll try baking for longer at a lower temp, but they turned out fine the way I did it. I didn't use the foil packet, just put in a glass dish and covered with foil.

Excellent! Doubled sauce and simmered it. Marinated in Garlic and pineapple juice after rubbing it with a smoked spice rub. Baked at 275 for 1.5 hours then at 200 for about two hours after basting with some marinade. Grilled for half hour on medium low. Everyone loved it!

Fantastic. Made it many times - always a winner. For best results I highly recommend to bake it in a Reynolds Baking Plastic Bag, it keeps it so so moist, even if you bake it the night before. (Just follow the recommendation of the Reynolds manufacture on how to use the bag), I too bake it longer then an hour at 325 degrees. The following day, just follow the recipe and bast in the glory of the comments you will get and make copies of the recipe for people to take home.

I thought the sauce was really, really good. (In place of half the honey, I used ginger syrup, also added some grated ginger) But I didn't like the texture of the ribs steamed in the foil packet (I did 3 hrs at 275). Even after some time on the grill, I thought they were too mushy and not caramelized enough. I'll definitely repeat the sauce again, but will bake the ribs uncovered.

Rating: 4
I have made these at least 10 times - always asked for the recipe - two time winning recipe at rib "throwdown" with family and friends. Followed other reviewer's suggestion to reduce the sauce on the stove before basting ribs, makes the sauce sticker and less bourbony (made that word up!) and for those who find the pineapple juice a little bland - I always grate some garlic and ginger into the juice and let that stew for 30 min or so before pouring over ribs. I also cook them on much lower temp - 250 at most for 2 1/2 hours

Fantastic. Next time I'll add a bit more chili paste.

Terrific. Didn't have plum sauce so used fig preserves. Didn't have chili paste so used chili and garlic sauce. Yummy!! baked for 2 1/2 hours at 275 then broiled with glaze for a few minutes on each side. served with corn cakes and salad and full bodied spanish wine.

Rating: 4
Yum. So glad read the reviews; like many others, I went the crockpot low and slow route. Did 6 hours on low--also marinated for 12 hours beforehand as well. I only made half the amount of ribs, as there were just 4 of us. I omitted the mustard and plum sauce because I didn't have any, and the molasses by accident. The meat fell off the bone easily. To finish, I used foil and folded it up at edges, coated with non-stick spray, then put half of glaze (after boiling for a couple of minutes on stove) on it. Broiled on hi for 2 minutes, then poured rest of glaze on and broiled for 3 additional minutes. Came out just right! Oh, and I double the sauce when I made it, too. We thought it could be just a touch spicier, so I will add some red pepper flakes next time. Served it with corn on the cob, everyone raved :)

Fantastic. We made everything the day before so we just glazed the ribs on the BBQ the day of. Definitely would make again.

Rating: 3
i will make this again but need to make some changes. based on other reviews i baked for about 3 hours at 275. maybe the foil wasn't tight enough to keep all the steam in but the ribs were alittle dry. next time i'll cook them in a steamer with the pineapple juice and then grill with the glaze. the sauce is very interesting and great as a glaze. i couldn't find the jim beam so used applejack which worked just as well.

Excellent! Cooked at 275 for 3 hours.

Rating: 3
Followed the suggestion of other reviewers and baked for 2 hrs at 275 degrees. Finished under the broiler as the grill is out of gas... the glaze is runny at first, but as you brush on each successive coat, a nice thick/sticky glaze forms. This was very good and the meat fell off the bone... the only thing that stopped me from giving it 4 stars was that I felt it would be better if the ribs had a rub or something added to the pineapple juice to infuse flavor throughout the meat before they are glazed. However, I consider this recipe a keeper!

I do not write many reviews but this sauce deserves a thumbs up! Easily adjusted for your own taste buds (hotter or sweeter)mand works well with chicken if you are not a prok eater!

I followed the recipe and cooked the ribs at 350--found the final product to be a little dry. Next time, I will cook them at a lower temperature for a longer period. The sauce was delicious.

Fantastic recipe. . .much like Cyndy Pawlcyn's Mongolian marinade. The hot chili paste is essential. I baked them at 300 for 2 hours, and they were moist and flavorful. The grilling sauce is perfect...let them char just a bit and they are memorable.

Great ribs! Thanks to other reviewers I followed the suggestions to cook the ribs at 225 degrees for 4.5 hours. I also cooked the sauce on the stove to reduce the alcohol taste. Will definitely make again!

I thought this was very good, but not great. Perhaps my expectations were a little high. I would make it again. Use Jack Daniels instead of bourbon.

Absolutely out of this world delicious. Tonight we are doing an Epicurious dinner party featuring top rated recipes from the site. This recipe is amazing. We followed the directions to a t. And even put more sauce on the finished ribs. Wow - Wow - Wow!

Rating: 4
i'd give these 10 forks if i could - they were THAT amazing. i first made them for the 4th of july, halving the recipe since i don't care for ribs and wasn't planning on eating any. i just wanted to try one and it was AMAZING. i made them for my in-laws a few weeks later simply because i was craving more! there are a lot of ingredients, but i pretty much followed the recipe to a T and think it's worth the number of bottles. i'll certainly be making these again!

Rating: 4
I went with the 275 degrees/four hours rate and really didn't change the glaze much at all. Added some garlic powder I guess. And I used more pineapple juice for my single rack of ribs. But holy sticky ribs Batman! What a tasty, tasty dish. My fella asked if we could eat lentil soup ever day of the week except on when when we would each get a full rack of these ribs. Mmmm!

Rating: 4
I make these ribs every time I have a pool party and they get rave reviews. I marinate the ribs in the pineapple juice for about 24 hours before baking which makes them oh so wonderfully tender. I now print out several copies of the recipe every time I serve them as everyone asks for the recipe.

Rating: 4
These ribs are awesome! I've made them several times now with great success, and I've been known to really screw up ribs in the past. I've made them on the grill as the recipe says, but I've also done them completely in the oven (first to bake, then broiling while glazing to finish). I only had orange juice on hand, so I used that instead of pineapple juice. The sauce is awesome, if a little boozy. If you want to use the remaining sauce for dipping, You can take the edge off by heating it on the stove to burn the alcohol off.

Rating: 4
Like another reviewer, I added about 1/2 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and the glaze was absolutely perfect. I only wish I'd made twice as much! Instead of grilling, I finished the ribs under a hot broiler for about 4 minutes on each side. I'll definitely make these simple and delicious ribs again soon!

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe again and again when I entertain. People RAVE about this sauce. I couldn't find sambal oelek, but used siracha instead. And I always cook the sauce beforehand to tame the alcohol flavor slightly. Also, I put the ribs in a dutch oven, and cook them 3 hrs on 225.

Rating: 4
Yes, cooking at lower temp. longer. Did it all in the oven, and still fab.

Rating: 4
This is really really good. It's one of those dishes that lives in your memory, and asks you to make it again ;) I baked the ribs at 275 for 2 hours, as suggested by the other reviewers. The only suggestion I'd have is to make MORE ribs (same amount of sauce) because you aren't going to have left-overs for this one.

Rating: 3
The ribs were juicy & practically fell of the bone. I prefer a spicer sauce, so I will add more chili next time. Didn't find it too bourbony, but then I like my bourbon "neat" (plus we don't drink the cheap stuff, so that probably helped the flavor). I cooked the meat at 225 for 2 hrs & then finished it off on the grill for 8 mins max.

Rating: 4
Outstanding. Followed another suggestion and cooked ribs at 275 for 2 hours (instead of 350 for 1 hour). Used regular molasses and plum jelly, instead of plum sauce, because that's what I had on hand. These were easy, too.

Rating: 4
I tried eliminating some of the fat and went for "country style pork ribs" which left the tasty-ness out. But these were the Most gorgeous chops ever!So beautiful. I cut down on the bourbon and chili paste because two of my guests are sensitive to heat. I had to triple the sauce. Next time I will try regular ribs and try cooking slowly in a crockpot.

Rating: 3
3.5 Forks. Only reason I didn't give this 4 forks is because I had to modify the sauce just a little bit. I followed the recipe, cooked the sauce to burn out the raw alcohol taste, but found that it lacked acidity in the flavor balance - just a little apple cider vinegar did the trick. Also VERY BOURBON-Y. I loved this flavor component but for those who don't really love it I highly recommend cutting back on the bourbon.

Rating: 4
Absolutely FANTASTIC. Cooked the ribs in the pineapple juice for about 90+ minutes. I too simmered the glaze to cook off some of the alcohol. Had no light molasses, so I used Vermont maple syrup instead. Everything else the same. The meat was falling-off tender and the glaze so delicious I will try it next with (gasp! no!) baked tofu. Too many darn calories in the ribs, but my they are TASTY. Most tender ribs I've ever cooked.

Rating: 4
Tried this on Sunday - it was a hit! My husband, who isn't really a pork fan, ate almost a whole rack of these ribs. I did make a couple of changes, in keeping with other suggestions. I set the oven at 250 and baked the ribs for an hour and 40 minutes. I also marinated the ribs in pineapple juice for about 30 minutes before baking. I also doubled the recipe for the glaze and just kept slathering on the glaze during grilling and just before serving. Served with corn on the cob and steamed broccoli. Will definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
This recipe is a winner!!! I prepared it last summer and look forward to enjoying it again soon. I have made changes as well. I slow cook the ribs for 2 plus hours (225 degrees) and also use a rub (along with the pineapple juice) . The rub is a fabulous addition. (any rub with an asian twist will do)..

Rating: 4
I have made these two times in as many weeks, as my husband and I both find them delectable. I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers to cook them on low in a Crock-Pot for 6 hours, then toss them on the grill as the recipe directs. I also made double the sauce, so there's plenty to drizzle on when serving. Delicious!

Rating: 4
I made just as the recipe stated. What a time saver from my other rib recipes. My husband said these were the best ribs ever. SO SO TENDER! Fell right off the bone.

Rating: 4
I made this last night and it was DELISH. I did what everyone else said and cooked lower and slower at 300 for 3 hours. I think the only thing I would do different would be to reduce the sauce just a bit so it sticks more to the ribs. Served with white corn on the cob, baked fries and biscuits. For those who the pineapple juice burned, mine did too on one of the racks because it was too close to the direct heat.

Rating: 3
Being winter, I cooked the ribs in a Reynolds Hot Bag (heavy foil) for the first hour. Then cut off the top of the bag and continued cooking and basting using the "convection roast" selection on my oven. The ribs were terrific. I didn't love the bourbon flavor as much as I thought so I may cut it down a bit next time. But, my husband raved and raved as he ate. I'm not even sure I would even bother using the grill in the warm weather. I think this would be very, very messy and not sure it would add anything to this great recipe.

Rating: 4
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS RECIPE. If I had more forks to give to my review I would give more. Like other reviews I doubled the glaze with the exception of the hot chili paste. I also marinated the ribs for 1-2 hours in the pineapple juice prior to putting them into a 225 degree oven for 4 1/2 hours. I've always found that ribs that cook low and slow are the best. They did not fall apart as much as you would think after the longer cooking time (just broke in half which was perfect for the grill. I served 6 people and everyone insisted on my sharing the recipe with them.

This recipe was absolutely perfect. I also cooked them in the oven for two hours instead of the one hour, based on other folks' recommendation. Any longer than that and I think they would have fallen apart on the grill. The sauce was to die for...This will be a frequent recipe in our home!

Like Washington DC I also cooked the ribs longer and slower. I braised the ribs the day before. The finish braising looking gray and unappetizing, but a hot grill and sevral coats of glaze produced very attractive and tender ribs. Great super bowl appetizer.

Fabulous glaze. The meat, though, isn't tender enough. Instead of cooking one hour at 350, I cooked them for 4 (four) hours at 225. This results in meat that simply falls off the bone. (Which, admittedly, creates its own problems at the grill. I solved this by skipping the grill and instead broiling each side for 2 minutes on HI in the oven). Yummy!

This was a great recipe. I made it for guests last night and they positively raved about it. I followed other people's advice and cooked the ribs for 3 hrs instead of 1. Unfortunately the pineapple juice ended up burning. I tried again, for 1.5 hours, and they were perfect! Also, make sure to cook the bbq sauce if you are going to serve it on the side. The alcohol can be quite strong. Goes wonderfully with a mild risotto!

Rating: 4
My husband and I absolutely love this recipe. The only thing I do differently is I cut the ribs in 3 bone sections and sprinkle the them with salt and pepper and then stack them in my crockpot. Cook on low for 6 hours. Near fall off the bone tender. Instead of brushing the cooked ribs with the glaze (not enough flavor for me), I dip them just before they go on the grill. During the time they spend on the grill I will give them a quick dip in the glaze before turning them over. Yum!

Rating: 4
This is a great basic recipe with a few changes. The sauce had to be quadrupled for our taste, the recipe the way it is makes barely enough for one rack. I did reduce the sauce just a bit to thicken it also. We also upped the baking time. I was very excited to use the pineapple juice as a tenderizer, but my boyfriend put Sierra Nevada ale in two of the packets instead behind my back - and much to my dismay his were much, much more tender!! I forgave him as soon as I tasted the ribs! We made this for a group of friends and we had no leftovers!

We made these ribs last night and they were great!! The only change was that I cooked them in a 180 degree oven for 3 hours before grilling them. The meat was so tender it was falling off the bone.

I have made these twice and both times the ribs were amazingly good. I doubled the bourbon and substituted fresh orange juice for the pineapple juice (just a personal preference...didn't want to be stuck with a can of pineapple juice) and it came out better than ribs I've had in restaurants. Make sure the meat browns a little, it really brings out the flavor

Rating: 3
These were very good. I increased the bake-time (1.5 hours), as other reviewers suggested, and they came off the grill moist, tender and falling off the bone. I was testing out the recipe for a big BBQ we are having in a couple of weeks, and these will definitely be on the menu. By itself, the sauce is just so-so. But paired with the ribs, it's delicious. Recommend cooking it to burn off the alchohol before you serve it along-side the ribs.

This was a very easy recipe to do and it turned out fabulous! I made it for a 4th of July BBQ and everyone raved about it. I loved how it was sweet, but had a small bite to it. I will use this recipe when making baby back ribs from now on.

I have made this recipe 3 times now and everyone raves about it! After the first time though, I tripled the glaze because I found that there just wasn't enough for marinating & basting. The only thing I didn't triple was the chili paste. Also, I cooked the glaze for about 15 minutes on medium heat to cook away some of the alcohol taste because I serve some of the glaze on the side with the ribs. I took the advice of some of the reviewers and marinated the ribs before grilling in some of the glaze. Also, I slow cooked the ribs in the pineapple juice on the grill for about 2 1/2 - 3 hours. I also found that 1 hour was not enough. This is definately a keeper!

Rating: 3
I made this up following the recipe to a tee. Cooking the ribs in the pineapple juice made them incredibly tender. The sauce was different and good but not something I would serve to a group and not have a back up to offer. I enjoyed them but the kids weren't all that keen. I would make them again but I do have better rib recipes.

Great recipe! Very easy to do and comes o ut beautifully. I baked the ribs the night before then just put more foil around the outside and put them into the fridge (after cooling). Threw them onto the grill the next day. Everyone raved! Will definitely use again.

The pre-cook in foil with juice is terrific and would work well for any rib recipe. I cooked these in the foil and then opened the packets and poured the sauce on and allowed the ribs to marinate in the sauce prior to slow cooking for approx. 45 mins on the grill.I agree with others who recommend making more sauce as without extra these lacked a bit of pizazz. I had spicy mango salsa on hand and served this with them and this seemed to make up for the lack of extra bourbon sauce.

Fantastic! We've made them twice. The second for a large crowd and they were terrific! I oven cooked them and made the sauce the night before our party and then we finished them off on the grill that night. They take longer than 10 minutes on the grill so allow ample time and follow some of the others' recommendations! This is our new family favorite! Enjoy!

I'd say this is a 3 fork, but my guests raved, I even received a "this is the best rib I've ever tasted", so I'm giving it a 4.

Tasty glaze for the ribs - I thought he bourbon flavor would be too powerful, but it cooked down while on the grill. I altered the BBQ suggestion a bit and went with low-heat (gas grill) for 30-minutes. The ribs were still tender and delicious!

I have made this twice now and the ribs are to tender and flavorful. Both times went over big with company. The bonus is it is make ahead. I marinated the cooked ribs in the glaze for about 1 hour before grilling. I grilled them 1 1/2 hours before serving and kept them covered in a 200 degree oven until we were ready to serve. Make more glaze.

This recipe was outstanding. Instead of baking ribs in the oven, I did it in the BBQ over indirect heat. Kept the kitchen cool and got the same results. The glaze is delicious. My diehard husband who usually eats only slow-smoked ribs loved this recipe. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender.

Excellent and easy! I could not find chili paste so I used a bit of Thai chili sauce instead. Flavor was slightly sweet and spicy and the bake/grill method turned out very tender ribs with just the right amount of sear - even with only 10 minutes on the grill. Will definitely make again.
