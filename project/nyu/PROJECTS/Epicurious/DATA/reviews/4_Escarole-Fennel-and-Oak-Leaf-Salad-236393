This was an outstanding salad, and many people commented on it. My step-father, who calls salad 'rabbit food' ate a large serving and asked for more. I had no oakleaf or bibb lettuce. So I tried to stick with the smae contrasts of texture and some bitterness... I used escarole and grean leaf lettuces, plus endive for a little bittnerness, and then of course the fennel. The contrasts of soft and crisp, sweet and bitter, with a bight of brightenss from the apple is very good. I will definitely be making this again. This is a perfect salad to complement heartier Fall flavors.
