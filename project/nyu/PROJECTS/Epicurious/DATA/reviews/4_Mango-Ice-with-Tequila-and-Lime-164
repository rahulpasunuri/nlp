This is now a summer staple in my house. I've also expirimented with watermelon and rum and it was pretty good but not as good as the mango. Looks nice garnished with bright purple pansies.

Use frozen mango from trader joe's if you have one near you. So convenient and yummy.

We also made this for Cinco de Mayo. We used more mango than called for, which enhanced the mango flavor. Simple & delish!

Actually I didn't stir the frozen mixture once in awhile and it still turned out excellent! Highly recommend. It would be a perfect summer dessert. My husband made it for us for Cinco de Mayo, very, very good!

Simple preparation, delicious taste! I compared it to Haagen Daaz Mango Sorbet which I had on hand and preferred this for its tangier, slightly more tart taste. I garnished it with fresh raspberries and mint leaves.
