The best cake I have ever made! A simple recipe, delicate but rich flavor. Having the eggs, butter and sour cream at room temperature is essential for the perfect consistency.

Living in New York City, and occasionally craving the layer cakes of my rural Midwestern youth, I have been repeatedly disappointed by the city's cake bakeries. Believe me, I've tried them all. The cakes tend to be all about the icing-- way too much of it,and way too sweet. The cakes themselves are usually a dry after-thought. (The only place I can recommend without reservation is Good Enough to Eat, and its two locations are out-of-the-way for me.) After yet another disappointment (Crumbs) I decided I had no choice but to bake my own. After much study, I settled on this golden cake, based on other reviews and the high sour cream content for moistness. It was fabulous. If you can cream butter and sugar, you can make this. The day after I made it I had a piece for breakfast, lunch and dinner and loved every bite. I made only two layers (four involves too much frosting) and made a simple chocolate butter cream frosting, cutting the standard recipe in half (8 oz cream cheese was plenty) and reducing the powdered sugar. This allowed the rich, moist, eggy, golden cake shine, as well it should. Obviously, no cake this good, with this much saturated fat, would be considered a health food. But for an occasional splurge it was great.

I made only the cake and not the frosting, but this is a great-tasting cake that is surprisingly low in labor intensity--tastes better than the box mix, and only marginally more work. Everyone wins. I made two batches, one using regular sour cream and one using light sour cream, and found no discernible difference in the finished product. Finished the cake with vanilla buttercream frosting and strawberries.

Phenomenal! I had to "make" cake flour (German #405 all purpose flour - 2 tbsp flour + 2 tbsp cornstarch) as you can't get cake flour in Germany but the cake turned out delicious. Looking forward to making it with proper cake flour in the US at some point! BTW if anyone has a better recommendation for a substitution for cake flour I would love to hear it :)

best. yellow. cake. recipe. ever. I've made this recipe many times for my sons' birthdays and it always turns out perfectly. I've also made it for cupcakes. I can't comment on the frosting as I make with a buttercream, but the cake is excellent.

I made cupcakes with this recipe. I made them very late and left them to frost until the early morning (when I discovered they had dried out). I think the recipe is quite tasty, but do not delay - add frosting ASAP. I think I will try this one more time, but I will bake, frost, and serve this recipe in a matter of a few hours.

Made this cake for dad's birthday this year. It was a huge hit. However, since I was a little afraid of my layered cake abilities, I baked the cakes in two 13x9 inch pans and only stacked the two instead of cutting them in half for four. This did result in TONS of frosting being left over. But I plan on making this cake recipe into cupcakes and using the frosting for those. This recipe really didn't take long either, so for that - the fourth fork.

This has become my go-to cake recipe for birthdays. I don't use the frosting recipe, I just use a nice buttercream one that I love. I sometimes fill with lemon and sometimes raspberry depending who it's for, always super yummy. One thing that may sound silly/obvious--MEASURE your sour cream even if the container is SUPPOSED to have the right amount. First time I made it it was dry, and I realized that the sour cream container had less than it said it did. Next time I measured and it was waaaay better. Also make sure that cake flour is fresh, it's worth it!

This is the best golden cake I have ever made, and we loved the icing (and I don't usually like icing). It's tangy and not overly sweet, and you still get a chocolate fix. Great recipe!

The cake is by far one of the best golden cakes I've ever tasted but the frosting was just plain bizarre.

I had high hopes for this recipe. Unfortunately, it was just so-so - the cake itself was a tad dry and the frosting was just too tangy.

This turned out pretty well. Especially liked the frosting. Did not have cake flour, so I used ap instead. The crumb was somewhat dense. Still, it had excellent flavor and the presentation was great! Can't wait to try again with the proper flour.

I was really skeptical when I pulled the recipe for this cake based on reader reviews, especially since I am NOT known for my baking skills. I was SO PLEASANTLY surprised. This cake was not too diffcultto make and the result was unbelievable. People didn't believe that I hadn't bought it at a bakery. The cake was just sweet enough o compliment the delicious chocolatey frosting and moist enough to make it thoroughley enjoyable. This will be my GO TO cake recipe. AWESOME!

DO NOT make this cake in the 13X9" pan as stated in the options part of the recipe. Your oven will be a charred mess because there is more batter than can be handled in a rectanglar cake pan. Otherwise, the cake was delicious! I used whole milk plain kefir instead of sour cream for the batter for my lactose intolerant friends and loved the result.

this is a very rich, excellent yellow cake. I used european butter and the flavor was superb. I cut the layers in half and used the Brown Sugar buttercream between two and the chocolate frosting in the very middle and to top the cake. Do not refrigerate though! The heavy butter content will make it harden and become stiff, needs to stay at room temperature for a fluffy, soft tender cake. Very nice presentation and flavorful overall.

Excellant cake-good crumb. I used 3 c and 1 T all-purpose flour, and the cake was moist, with a great texture. I brushed the layers with a simple syrup/Armaretto for extra flavor. Frosting was easy to use. Serves quite a few.

The sour cream frosting had a pleasant tang to it and paired well with the sour cream in the yellow cake. I didn't use all of the frosting and probably had 1-2 cups left.

My cake turned out of the pans perfectly. I could have easily cut the layers to make it a 4 layer cake but was running short on time. I definitely recommend cutting them though because you need the frosting for moisture. I refrigerated the cake the night before which ended up making it dry. I don't think you would want to make this much more in advance due to the dryness. It's almost like a pound cake consistency. I used a chocolate buttercream frosting based on the other reviews on the sourcream frosting being to much for the cake.

The best yellow cake recipe I've ever found.

Ok, I followed this recipe to the letter, but it was a flop--quite literally. The icing was bitter, didn't harden and the weight of the icing caused a fault line in the middle of the cake, which was to by my husband's birthday cake. I'm contemplating freezing, chopping and chucking it into my icecream maker...that might be tasty.

The cake was very good...very moist and easy to make and put together..I did not use the sour cream frosting becasue I thought it might be too tart...I used a cocoa frosting instead and it was delicious with the cake.

The yellow cake was great. The frosting was a bit too tart. Next time, I'll make a ganache or buttercream frosting. Definitely, worth making again.

I MADE THIS CAKE TWICE NOW SINCE THE RECIPE WAS PUBLISHED AND THE CAKE WAS EXTREMELY WELL RECEIVED. THE CAKE WAS VERY MOIST AND HELD UP TO THE THINEST OF SLICES. I FOUND THE FROSTING A LITTER TO BITTER AND THE SECOND TIME REDUCED THE SOUR CREAM AND ADDED CONFECTIONERS SUGAR. THE CAKE DISPLAYS EXTREMELY WELL AND IS QUITE IMPRESSIVE. I WILL DEFINATELY MAKE AGAIN BUT WILL MORE THAN LIKELY CHANGE THE FROSTING TO EITHER BUTTERCREAM OF CHOCOLATE CREAM CHEESE.
