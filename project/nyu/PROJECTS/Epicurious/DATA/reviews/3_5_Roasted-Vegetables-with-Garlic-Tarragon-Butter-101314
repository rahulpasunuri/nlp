I AGREE YUMMM! WHAT A GREAT TWIST...JUST ADD TARRAGON. I MAKE THIS OFTEN AND USE A VARIETY OF VEGETABLES (WHATEVER IS IN SEASON IS THE WAY TO GO). ABSOLUTELY WORTH MAKING!!

I would totally make this dish again. I was one of the best side dishes I've ever prepared. I served it with Chicken Marsala for a dinner party with my girlfriends and they just loved it!

After trying this I'm even more convinced that tarragon is not destined to be a roasting herb. I'll stick with rosemary, as ordinary as it is.

Not bad, but nothing special... I think there are tastier ways to roast vegetables.

Everyone liked this recipe, but I wasn't as impressed with it considering the time it took to make. One thing to try is to add the radicchio about 2 minutes before you take the everything out of the oven so that it keeps its color and texture. This would have also tasted better grilled.

I would never have thought to add radicchio. This was a wonderful side dish to thanksgiving dinner.

Yum! Wonderful flavor and beautiful presentation. I prepared the veggies to accompany grilled porterhouse. Instead choosing zucchini or yellow squash, I added 2 of each. I also threw in an extra green bell pepper. Platter was garnished with lemon halved covered with stretch wraps.

This was a delicious dish and very easy to make. The guests i made it for all enjoyed it and I would definitely make it again. I did not change a thing and the time it took was right on.

Vegetables were tasty but I substituted fresh basil instead of the tarragon. Perhaps the tarragon would have been better. Will try again this time with the tarragon. I also substitued the butter, as I don't eat dairy I used soybean margarine.
