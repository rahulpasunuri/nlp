Use pancetta instead of bacon and you have a side beyond compare. It would also make a wonderful lunch with a good rye or italian bread...

This is a quick way to prepare a fresh vegetable that goes well with pork, smoked ham, or sausage. I simplified the preparation further by replacing the bacon with saved bacon fat. I sauteed the caraway seeds in the melted fat for about 2 minutes (until the seeds started to pop), added the cabbage and continued to cook according to the recipe. Just before serving I added some course salt and fresh ground pepper and left out the crumbs.

I wasn't that impressed with this cabbage recipe, I don't think I will make it again.

Well, aside from the previous blather....I actually DID make this. Yummy old-fashioned dish good with pork chops on a rainy day.
