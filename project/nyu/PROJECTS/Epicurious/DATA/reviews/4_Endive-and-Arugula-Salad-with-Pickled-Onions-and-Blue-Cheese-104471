Fantastic salad that keeps very well. We had it a few times through the week & loved it each time. I'm not a big cranberry fan so we swapped them for toasted pepitas.

This is a keeper! Since it's summertime, I used fresh Bing Cherries instead of dried cranberries and they were wonderful. Used the leftover onions on sandwiches the next day and they were also wonderful.

What a wonderful blend of flavors....and those pickled onions are too good. I made more to keep around for sandwiches.

I have made this salad on 3 occasions already and everytime the guests ask for the recipe. A real winner. It's easy to make ahead and throw together right before serving.

I made this recipe for a New Year's Eve buffet and this salad was a hit. My guests raved about the pickled onions.

Absolutely wonderful, and I thought I didn't like blue cheese! Was I ever wrong. Best salad ever!
