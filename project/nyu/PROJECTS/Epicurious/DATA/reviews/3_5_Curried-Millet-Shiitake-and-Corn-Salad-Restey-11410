I discovered Millet by reading an article on it. Then found this recipe and i'm hooked! I followed it to the tee....it was excellent!

I've made this twice, the first time with using red pepper as I didn't have mushrooms nor parsley. The peppers did the trick for color and flavor, and the dish went well with our breaded halibut and salad greens. I also used coconut oil, which I thought tasted fabulous. Second time I was really wowed by the savory of the shiitakes and the color of the parsley--planning to serve with salmon this time. I love the versatiliy of this dish!

Topped with pan-toasted raw cashews and sub'd chopped pea shoots for the parsley; also used royal trumpet mushrooms instead of shiitake. Wow-I was very surprised at how good this tasted. Def add cashews! They add a sweetness that complements the flavors nicely. I think you can cook up less millet (3/4 not the full cup) and have more flavor with same amt. soy mix. I would also try adding peas. Try coconut aminos for the soy. Far less sodium and great flavor, plus more vitamins. Nice vegan/veg dish. Ate it with sauteed pattypan sqash and a garden salad to complete the meal.

This is phenomenal! I really loved how wonderfully delicious this recipe is! I stuck with the recipe, I only added 1 jalapeno for an extra kick. Will definitely make this again!

It was so nice to be re-intoduced to Millet with recipe. I used to eat a lot more Millet years ago as a vegetarian. Even without variation the recipe was excellent but one could easily have great results improvising with it. Thanks!

This was a great way to enjoy millet and fresh corn. I put the millet in a rice cooker with a 3:1 ratio, and it came out perfect. The curry powder was an interesting touch. Make sure you salt this to taste.

I found that the 2:1 ratio of water to millet was too low... the millet came out a little underdone. Maybe I overfried it? I'll try a 2.5:1 ratio next time, or maybe pre-soaking. I used crimini instead of shiitake, and added tomato, fresh hot peppers, and a little drizzle of roasted sesame oil. I was wowed by the flavors, and will definitely experiment with this again. Thought about adding meat, but decided to keep it pure... will do so again.

I liked it. I switched the mushrooms from shitake (sp?) to crimini. I took out the corn because we have so much corn in the market place now, I wanted a break. I put snap peas in their place. I also doubled the seasoning because it was kinda blah as is. If you are an omnivore, try shrimp or chicken in the mix. I have sensitivies to wheat gluten so I used this as a template to play with.

Good recipe for millet. Am always trying to get my family to try new foods. My 5-yr-old asked me to make it again! Will double the mushrooms next time.

This was an easy to make, great dish and a wonderful introduction to millet. I'm sure it would work nicely with quinoa as well, not to mention rice. It might take a bit longer to cook, just make sure the millet is soft before you serve it. The flavors developed well over a few days and it made great leftovers. For something different, give it a try.
