A bit too much sausage taste (used andouille and okra as suggested here). I think I prefer the seafood type of gumbo but the duck was an interesting alternative. When frying the duck, do cover it; I was amazed how much grease flew around and I used a dutch oven to brown it.

Yum ! I added okras to this recipe to make it more gooey. Couldn't find Lousiana style andouille where I live so I put two types of sausages: 1 smoked and 1 I made with ground pork meat and spices (cayenne, thyme, pepper, garlic, oregano).

This is a great start - but to make it even better (the version I made was spectacular), add okra and herbs: thyme, bay leaves, oregano, a few dashes of different spices - paprika, fennel seeds... But essentially, the okra makes all the difference. And only use white rice. It might be heretical, but I started thinking this would be pretty good over couscous, too...

I've made this recipe 4 times; it is one of our favorite gumbos. I fry the duck pieces in a 16 qt stockpot to reduce the mess; a frying pan coats the kitchen evenly with grease. I recommend cooking the gumbo only about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, if you want recognizable duck pices. Otherwise the meat "melts" into the gumbo, though the taste is still fantastic. Use Andouille sausage if you can; reduce the cayenne a bit to allow for the spiced sausage. I like okra and thicker gumbo so I add 20 oz frzen okra. Finally, skip the brown rice and go for nice long grain white rice. Mmmm!

I am not a fan of okra, so this recipe caught my eye. Instead of using whole ducks, I used duck legs only and they worked very well. The gumbo was delicious. A definite keeper recipe that I will make for family or company again. Next time, though, I won't cook the sausage until the last thirty minutes or so to keep the sausage from shrinking and hardening.
