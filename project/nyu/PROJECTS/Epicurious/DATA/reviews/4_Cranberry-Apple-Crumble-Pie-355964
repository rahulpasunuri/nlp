Loved this pie and so did everyone else!! I like really tart pies and this one is my new favorite. I did make a few changes based on the reviews. I added an additional 1/4 C. white sugar, used 1/4 flour (in the filling) and used an 2 or 3 more apples (my pie plate is large). I precooked the filling a bit as I was worried after reading some of the reviews. I used the full amount of cranberries. I also used a mix of granny smith and gala apples.

Like many of the reviewers said, this is VERY tart and I'm not thrilled about adding more sugar. Epicurious has an apple/raspberry recipe that I like much better.

Delicious! I used 5 Cortland apples sliced very thin. Orange juice instead of lemon juice. Added 2T of sugar to fruit and sprinkled orange rind on top. Used store bought pie crust. Only used a few pats of butter on top of fruit covered and baked filling for 35 min. Added crumble mixture - only used 1/4 C butter and baked for 30 min. at 375. Came out perfect!

Everyone loves this pie and it was gone in no time. I did make a few changes per previous suggestions: 2T more sugar in the filling, as well as more cinnamon and slightly less cranberries (about 7 oz). Perfect for Thanksgiving.

This is a yummy pie. The crumble top gives it an extra layer of flavor and texture that you don't usually get from 2 crust pies. After reading the reviews I added extra apples, sugar & cinnamon and decreased the amount of cranberries slightly ... I'm glad I did. It was a delightful play off of sweet and tart, and it probably would have been too tart otherwise. I also, thanks to reviews, increased the baking time for the first round. It was a little messy to get out of the tin, and didn't hold it's shape very well, but it was delicious! Thanks for sharing, I'll definitely be making this again!

Great recipe use dehydrated cranberries instead it makes it not so tart. Use extra brown sugar for the crumble. super yummy!!!

It wasn't as easy as a simple apple pie, but it's a really nice change from a simple apple pie. As others have said, it's tart, so add more sugar if you don't like a tart pie. I agree with the reviewer who said that the filling should have cooked down more - maybe increase that phase of baking to 35 minutes, then once you put the crumble topping on, decrease that baking time, maybe down to 40 minutes instead of 45, otherwise the crumble topping will get too toasty. And definitely let it cool completely - I had a small taste when it was still warm and then when it was completely cool, and the cranberries seemed more tart when it was warm, interestingly enough. I'll make it again with those modifications.

Although this pie is tasty, it was a pain to make. Good thing I am an experienced baker! May I suggest that the filling get a lot more baking time before adding the (easily scorched) topping? I had to lower the oven heat and cover the pie with foil to simultaneously cook the apples and not burn the crumble or edges.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was good but not as great as I hoped. I upped the sugar to 2/3 cup and cut down slightly on the cranberries, and that was perfect. A lightly sweet pie with a nice tart bite. Main problems were that my apples stayed too crisp, and the crust lacked flavor. I made the crust with all butter, but it needed a bit more salt and some sugar, I thought.

I made this last night for a large Thanksgiving celebration with lots of desserts and this one was a huge hit. Changes: I made the crust with more shortning and less butter (very flakey), more apples (7) and less cranberries, more sugar 3/4 of a cup, more cinnamon 1.5 teaspons, and more crumble. It received rave reviews. I will definitely make this again.

I personally thought this pie was too tart, but I was in the minority, everyone else who tired it loved it. I would definitely make it again (possibly even in the next couple of days), but I'd either up the sugar or lower the amount of cranberries. The crumble is really tasty though--something about the pecans just set it off.

I wanted to try a new twist on apple pie to bring for thanksgiving dinner. I am glad I did a test run before making it for company. My family enjoyed the pie but thought it was TOO TART. I followed the recipe exactly. The crust and crumb topping were outstanding. I would make the pie again but use 1/2 of the cranberries!

I made this pie for thanksgiving las year and it got such rave reviews that I am making it again this year. I used a store bought frozen pie crust which makes it easier.

Because I just bought a Le Creuset 10-inch pie plate, I increased portions to adequately fill the pie. I did increase flour to ¼ cup and once cooled, it set up perfectly without much juicy run off and held shape nicely once cut and plated. (Served with vanilla ice cream) I was out of pecans and subbed walnuts. Added fresh orange zest to provide a small flavor twist. After baking, I sprinkled top with Sugar-in-the Raw for a sparkly finish. Everyone loved the crunchy topping. Pie dough was barely enough for my larger pie, so next time I will increase that by ¼ . It will bubble up and spill over, so line bottom of oven with foil. It smelled great while baking. Definitely will be making again.

People who generally don't eat much dessert had seconds on this pie. It is very delicious and not too sweet. It took me substantially more time to bake though, about 45-50 minutes for the first baking without the crumble and about 1 hour 5 minutes after the crumble. The top was not browning and the pecans were starting to get a little over-done so I covered the pie with foil for the last 15 minutes.

This is a terrific recipe! Consistently a crowd pleaser- especially with the crumble on top!

My family loved this pie. I added oats to the crumble and since I didn't have any pecans, substituted chopped almonds. Also, I added some mixed berries and reduced the amount of cranberries. I brushed the crust with milk to avoid burning.

This is an outstanding pie. The topping is nice and cruncy with the nuts added. I did make a couple of changes just to please my family's palate. I added 1/4 cup of maple syrup to the fruit filling and I also melted 2 tbsp's of the butter and stirred it in as well. I dotted the top of the filling with the remaining 2 tbsp's. I've made this twice since Thanksgiving, once without the pie crust to serve as a crumble. Delicious both ways.

I made this with winesap apples and an all-butter crust. Fabulous.

I agree with the comments in the previous reviews - use the lower range of the cooking times, put foil under to catch the drippings. I added extra pecans to the crumble. This is so easy and yummy, and I love recipes that I can make ahead of time. I made the crust and the crumble 2 days before Thanksgiving and stored them in the frig (the crust was in a disc-shaped ball, not rolled out). The pie was assembled and baked a day ahead. It is wonderful with vanilla ice cream.

The crust was a snap to make, as was the crumble, and the pecans really sent an already superb blend of fruits over the top. I made mine in the bottom oven of my stove (a drawer), and I found the temperatures perfect (I always set my timer for the earliest time given, and it was ready then).

Delicious! Nice crust - which is always a concern with these sorts of pies. Plus, perfectly balanced taste. Not sticky sweet, and not too tangy either. I didn't have a deep dish pie plate, but my ingredients fit into a regular one easily enough. 2 tips: 1. Put a piece of foil on a rack below in oven to catch any bubble over 2. Watch the time on the last step - it didn't need 40 min in my oven either, just like previous post said. Will be making this for Thanksgiving! Sure to be a big hit!

I made this pie a few weeks ago for a potluck, and it was so delicious that I'm making it again for Thanksgiving. I agree with the previous review that the Gala apples and cranberries create a perfect balance between sweet and tart. My only problem was that I checked the pie 40 minutes after reducing the oven's temperature and adding the crumble topping. It was already considerably more browned than it should have been. If I left it in for an hour, it would have been completely burnt. I'll keep a closer eye on the final stage of baking next time.

Really nice recipe. Turned out a good looking pie that had nice textures and tastes. I actually made a little extra of everything and did two shallow, rather than deep dish pies. Took it to a potluck and it was all gone.

The combination of gala apples and cranberries provide the perfect balance between sweet and tart! The pecan topping also adds a nice crunch to the soft gooey-ness of the filling. An absolutely scrumptious dessert for the fall setting!
