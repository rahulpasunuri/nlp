While these little cakes are very photogenic, they are indeed labor intensive. Also, only the very centers of the cake can be eaten because the bitterness of the rind seeps in. If anyone has a suggestion for this problem, I'd love to read it.

Found the cake to be rather dry and tasteless. The recipe was a lot of work, too. It's a nice idea and we'll try it again perhaps with a chiffon or a cool baked filling, such as a custard. May even try it with seafood. Did smell great in the oven!
