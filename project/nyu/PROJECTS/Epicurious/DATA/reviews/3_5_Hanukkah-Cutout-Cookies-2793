I received rave reviews when I serve these at my Hanukkah party. I didn't love them as much as everyone else did, but I will continue to make them. The lemon really separates this sugar cookie recipe from the rest.

The lemon junkies need to take their tart revolution elsewhere. This is a lovely basic sugar cookie with a hint of lemon. And as earlier noted, very easy to make.

Easy & quick, especially since it calls for things already in the kitchen. Lemon flavor is great. This was a great way to divert my kids cabin-fever during a long Thanksgiving weekend without adding too much "sweet" to an already dessert-laden holiday. Dough was easy for the kids to handle and roll.

In the words of my daughter and my niece (both five-year olds), they are 'wowsers'. We tried it out last Saturday, and it turned out great even without proper measuring spoons. The texture was ideal for cutout cookies. The icing though, got a thumbs down, no fault with the recipe, actually it was due to the confectioners sugar, which tasted terrible. My guess is that it had been kept in storage too long at the store, and it was hard as a brick. I'll stick to making it in my blender with regular white sugar, (more work but better flavor). I had mixed feelings about sugar cookies recipes, because of the totally different opinions, but this was a winner.

They were a hit at my office open house - made them in various shapes and colors - used almond extract instead of vanilla

I increased the lemon to achieve a stronger lemon flavor, but even then I found these cookies to be unimpressive. Crispy yet sedate. I wouldn't bother with them again.

I prepared these for my son's senior class to decorate. The dough was easy to work with, and I highly recommend the recipe to those making cutout cookies. The lemon flavor makes these very special. I baked them from 8-12 minutes,depending on the size of the cookie.

Delicious cookies - I used the Royal Icing recipe from Martha Stewart to decorate, but my 6 year old stepson loved them uniced!
