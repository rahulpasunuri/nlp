I added ~2oz of unsweetened chocolate we had hanging around, splash of vanilla, blob of sour cream. (1/3 cup maybe?) Used suggested 1 cup white, 1 cup brown sugar. Delish. Cooked 25 minutes. Ate warm and mushy in the center.

The first time I made these I mis- read the recipe and used 1 stick of butter instead of 1 cup. They were dry and dense. Because of the reviews I made them again for 2nd night Seder and followed the enhancements that 'Love to Cook for U' made. I also cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup each white and brown sugar. I finished it with a chocolate ganache (1/3 cup boiling heavy cream poured over 6 oz choc chips and 1 tbls butter). Nobody could believe that these were Passover brownies. It was delicious!! Moist, flavorful and everything that all the other reviews have raved about.

Everyone RAVED about the brownies. So moist and delicious. I ground matzo to make my own matzo cake meal. Sifted the matzo to make sure it was very fine before measuring. I used half white and half brown sugar, added 1t. vanilla, 1/2 cup good quality choc. chips and a large squirt of liquid chocolate syrup (definitely added to the moistness) Checked them after 20 minutes of baking. They were done perfectly in 7x10 inch glass pan. The only thing I would try next time is reducing the sugar.

Nothing decadent about these. I found them to be dry and rather tasteless. Joan Nathan has a great Passover brownioe made with almond meal. Google the recipe and bake a brownie that is good all year round.

I was having a crazy day, not really concentrating, and started to use matzo meal not cake meal- realized it just as i started to pour it in so stopped before too much went in. Then realized i forgot to put the chocolate bits in so added it after it was in the oven for 6 minutes - just poured them on top and sort of stirred. 25 minutes later took the brownies out of the oven and they are terrific! I did do the 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar - this is a real winner for my family! I made it in a spring form and plan on slicing into wedges and serving with whipped cream for a dairy dessert.

Followed the suggestions of 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar as well as adding chips and raisins. Super moist and rave reviews. I used special dark cocoa and so these were more "blackies" than brownies.

These are delicious! Dense, fudgey, goodness. I made a chocolate ganache frosting to top them off which just made them even more fabulous!

I just made these for tomorrow's seder. I was worried because despite the warning not to burn them, I did over cook them by a few minutes. There was even a crust around the edge (the recipe stated that there should be no crust). They were delicious, a bit cake-like (which I like) and every bit as yummy as any brownie you'd make the rest of the year. I also added some large dark chocooate chips to the mix and a few semi-sweet chips on top bc that's what I had on hand. They're great!

Rating: 4
I did half and half of the sugar, but I also added 2 squares of melted unsweetened chocolate for a stronger chocolate flavor. I also now add chocolate chips, plus 1/2 cup or more of white raisins. They are basically hidden in the brownie, but they make them so moist! I learned about this from a wonderful kosher caterer in Phoenix! I also freeze them and then when I unfreeze them, I put a chocolate icing on top! They are fabulous! No one can believe they are for Passover and everyone wants the recipe!

I made these in a hurry before reading the reviews. I also used half white - half brown sugar. I would have cut the sugar down, tho. A bit too sweet. But for Passover, these are great!

These brownies were amazing! I followed the other reviewer's advice to use 1 cup granulated and 1 cup brown sugar, which helped to make these thick and fudgy. Instead of walnuts I used 4 oz. unsweetened chocolate. My seder guests could not touch them because we were so full, but I brought them to work the next day and all my non-Jewish coworkers ate them up and had no idea they were kosher for Pesach.

Rating: 4
Divine! This recipe is very close to my regular brownie recipe (originally from Susan Mendelson of The Lazy Gourmet in Vancouver), so I knew it would be fab, and knew I could play with it a bit. I used half brown and half white sugar, 1 cup cocoa powder and 2 Tb. Medaglia d'Oro espresso powder (no need to dissolve in liquid). I beat the mixture with a stand mixer for several minutes after adding the eggs and BEFORE adding the matzoh meal. Then I stirred in a package of pareve chocolate chips instead of nuts. Lined 9X13 pan with parchment paper so they were easy to remove -- baked only 20 minutes and they were perfect. Made icing from 1 cup pareve margarine (I generally hate the stuff but it was a meat meal), 1 cup cocoa powder, 1 cup icing sugar (all kosher l'Pesach), 2 Tb espresso powder and a pinch of salt, whipped together in a food processor. Huge hit. I am now the official purveyor of brownies for future seders!

Excellent Passover brownies. Almost like brownies. I made them w/ my kids and they had fun doing it. I took the suggestions of others and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. Did't add walnuts.

Wonderful - thanks to reviewers for the tips-I also used half white and half brown sugar, and instant coffee powder, and I added a generous tablespoon of cognac and vanilla too. I lined the bottom of a round baking pan with baking paper, and turned the cake up-side down.After peeling off the paper I got a beautiful smooth surface on which I spread a sinful mixture of dark chocolate,butter,instant coffee powder, cognac and a dash of cinnamon - all melted and spread when cooled. a fantastic passover cake.

Yum. This may be the best Passover dessert of all time. I used strong, high-quality coffee and loved the flavor it added. I also used half white and half brown sugar, was generous with the cocoa powder, and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Make sure not to over-bake - they're delicious when still moist and gooey. Definitely a keeper.

YUM. This may be the best Passover dessert of all time. Used very strong, good coffee and loved the flavor it added. I was also generous with the cocoa powder, used 50/50 white and brown sugar, and added one teaspoon of vanilla. Don't forget the walnuts. This one's a keeper.

I really like these brownies, and agree that they'd be pretty good any time of the year. I don't normally cook brownies from scratch, but for a time when I can't go to my box of Duncan Hines, they are not much more time consuming to make and are certainly superior to a passover brownie mix. They just don't get that good crust that regular brownies do, they are more cake-like. I cooked them for just under 25 minutes, the center did not seem to be set when they were hot, but firmed up when it cooled. I probably would not go out of my way to bake these myself during the rest of the year (as opposed to a regular mix), but would not have any problem eating them if someone else wanted to do the work. Four forks since I'm grading on a curve for passover, three for the rest of the year!

Rating: 4
These are a 4 forker for Passover. I did add a handful of chocolate chips to the recipe as well. I did have to put the pan in the freezer for a little while after they cooled in order to cut them and get them out. Maybe next time a piece of foil on the bottom would be helpful.

Has anyone tried this recipe with less than 2 cups of sugar. I was thinking of cutting it to down 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

Wow -- these are good -- definitely don't taste like a "Passover" dessert! However, I did find them a little dry... so I tried just "Pesach-ifying" my favorite brownie recipe from "The Joy of Cooking." I subbed matzo cake meal for regular flour (the cannister says that 1 c. of flour is equivalent to 5/8 c. of cake meal), used half white and half brown sugar, added 1/4 t. instant espresso powder, upped the vanilla a little (for those who are strict about the food restrictions this wouldn't work as vanilla extract has grain alcohol -- a Passover no-no) and threw in a handful of chocolate chips. I couldn't tell the difference between these and regular brownies!

made these for a Passover Tea and every brownie vanished! Big hit! My substitutions:Sugar: 1/2 white & 1/2 brown. Butter: 1/2 whipped & 1/2 regular. Coffee: 1 tsp instant 4 oz.bittersweet choc chips (ran out of unsweetened cocoa powder)

I followed several reviewer's suggestions,and added the vanilla, one ounce of unsweetened chocolate, and did the white/brown sugar split. The brownies were extremely well received. They were by far the best Passover dessert I have made. Would not go so far as to say they are for all times of the year, but I will never look for another dessert for Passover.

These brownies were fantastic. I would definitely compare them to brownies I would make at other times during the year. My guests did not believe that they were Passover brownies. They also didn't believe that I made them from scratch. These brownies are a keeper and will become a staple Passover recipe year after year. I took others' suggestions and used one cup brown sugar and one cup white. I also didn't have any cake meal, only matzoh meal, so I ground the matzoh meal down as finely as I could and substituted. It was perfefct!

Rating: 4
MOST amazing passover brownies! Just a few changes, I agree with the others, 1 cup brown & 1 cup white sugar, no nuts, add 4 oz unsweetened chocolate. For additional decadence, drizzle melted white chocolate ( copied that from the other review) but also semi sweet choc on top in zigzag pattern-- made it look just as fabulous as it tastes!

Rating: 4
Yum Yum! I used one cup each brown and white sugar, 13/4 sticks butter instead of 2, added 2oz. unsweetened chocolate melted and no nuts. They were sooo... much richer and chocolatey. And to finish them off I drizzled white chocolate ( kosher for passover) for presentation. Definitely a keeper.

delicious brownie, had to do it again although passover is over. It is definitely one of the family favorites. I have added more walnuts, and substituted coffee with dark tea (because I dont like coffee). I serve it warm (its still quite soft and fudgy then) with vanilla ice cream

Rating: 3
These are pretty good as Passover brownies go, but I (unlike a few other reviewers) don't think they have anything on ordinary brownies as the recipe stands. I recommend mixing 4 oz. (or more!) finely chopped dark chocolate into the batter--it gives the brownies a deeper, richer, more authentically chocolate flavor that's difficult to get from cocoa powder alone. I'm making them again this afternoon, and plan to add chocolate chips to the recipe, which I expect to improve the brownies even more.

Rating: 4
Truly delicious. The tray of brownies was gone before I put out the other desserts. I am making them again tonight & will make them throughout the year. So good that they don't need frosting. Very chewy & moist. I used instant coffee, added water & then put in a pot & let it come to a boil.

These were by far the best passover brownies my family has ever had. If I did not know myself that they were made with matzoh cake meal rather than flour, I would not have guessed. As per other reviewers, I modified the recipe just a bit...1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar, added 1 tsp. of vanilla, and about half a cup of chocolate chips. They were moist and fudgy. Yummy! This recipe will be served at our Passover seders for many years to come!

Just quickly wanted to report that I made these tonight to be put in the freezer for seders...I also used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, added bit of vanilla and 1/8 tsp of ground coffee instead of the brewed coffee(no time to brew it). I made the Engel brownies from this site 2 nights ago and think these are superior. Not sure why they taste less "pesach-y" considering there's more cake meal, but the flavor and texture on these was far superior to Engel's. Will definitely make these again.

Great Passover recipe, though I wouldn't go so far as to toss my non-Passover brownie recipes! These were smooth, rich and chocolatey and went really well with the mixed fruit salad we served. I dusted the top with extra cocoa powder which dressed them up a bit since I didn't use nuts. I also followed several reviewers' advice and used 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar. I'll definitely add these to my Passover line-up in the future, especially since they were so easy to make.

I have made these brownies several times, and not only for Pesach. I have never had any of the problems that some others have had. They always come out fudgy and intensely chocolate, but not cloyingly sweet. I buy up matzah cake meal when Pesach is over and the supermarkets mark it way down. Then I have enough cake meal to make them throughout the year. They are everyone's favorite in my family (had a tough time convincing everyone that they were Pesadich the first seder I made them). I have thrown out all my other brownie recipes, and this is the only one I make now.

everyone enjoyed these very much. although they were a little denser than brownies made with flour we didn't feel like lead after eating. I used Williams Sonoma Pernogotti cocoa and they were as chocolatey as can be, instead of brewed coffee I used a scant 1/8 tsp of ground coffee and it added just the flavor needed. I will definitely make again for Passover- I'll use a flour brownie recipe the rest of the year.

I had the exact same problem as the person who commented on 4/14--butter seeped through to the top, and these were miserably dry once cooled. (I'm a pretty experienced baker, and I actually made these *twice* to figure out what might have gone wrong the first time through--same problems each time.) The flavor was not all chocolatey, either. A real disappointment. (Maybe we are willing to tolerate lesser recipes in our searches for Passover-friendly goodies?)

These are great! I used 1/2 cup vanilla sugar (i.e., sugar flavored with vanilla beans) and 1-1/2 cups light brown sugar. Also froze them after cooling and am keeping them in the fridge. They are very rich--delicious!

Incredible. Everyone at my seder loved them. I added a pareve ganache (semisweet chocolate chips melted in a little boiling water), but in all honesty, they didn't need it! I don't know what happened to the batch the previous reviewer made, but I will make these every year. Oh, a couple more things. If you have trouble finding matzo cake meal, you can make it by putting regular matzo meal in the food processor until it is very very fine. Also, to the reviewer who topped them with powdered sugar: powdered sugar is not, according to ashkenazic tradition, kosher for passover, because it contains cornstarch. You can approach the texture of powdered sugar by putting regular granulated sugar through the food processor (as you can see, I love my food processor!). Or you can follow sephardic tradition for passover, which permits corn, flax, beans, peas, rice, and yes, even baking soda.

This was an excellent brownie recipe and I would make this again...anytime of the year. I made it in a dark 9x9 pan so I reduced the temp to 325, but still baked them for the full time. I also forgot about the coffee until after they were in the oven. I don't know that I would add it next time as they were great just as they were.

WOW! No one believed they could possibly be for passover. There were 11 people, and not a crumb leftover. People wanted the recipe because they wanted to make the brownies themselves, not just to have a passover dessert. Like others, used 1c. brown & 1c. granulated. I also put in a splash of vanilla, and did not use walnuts. I took them out as soon it was dry on top, as I love fudgy brownies. Finding the the right "flour" took a couple of tries - but WELL worth it. I shouldn't have tried to so hard to find it - it was at the Safeway a mile from my house!

Awesome. This was very easy to make. Like the other reviewers, I used 1 c. brown and 1 c. white sugar. The kids were skeptical when they saw me putting in the coffee but they couldn't stop eating the brownies. I cut them into 1" squares because they are very rich. This recipe is a keeper!

It took a trip to several stores to find the right flour. These brownies are a far cry from some of the awful dry sponge cakes I've been served at Passover. The brownies' texture is different but they melt in the mouth and the chocolate flavour is deep and satisfying. A brownie for all occasions.

I was searching around this afternoon for a good chocolate recipe that will travel well to the Passover Seder I'm attending next week. I saw this recipe and thought I'd give it a "test run" before I make it for the seder. I bake quite a lot and was extremely happy with the results! You'd NEVER know that these brownies were Passover friendly -- they are rich, fudgy, and oh so chocolately.. Note: I used 1 1/2 cups of white granualted sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also used good quality dutch processed cocoa power. These were wonderful and I will definitely make a double batch for Passover!
