I'm giving this 4forks for the great inspiration. I did not use any dairy in mine so dbled the chicken broth and it did not come out as I'd hoped. That said it made a bloody great thick soup. Pureed half and bob's your uncle. It was fab!

We just won our second chili cookoff with this crowd pleaser. We tend to cut liquids in half and will use poblano as well as anaheim peppers. A truly excellent chili!

Excellent. Added 4 cloves of garlic when cooking onions and half a bunch of cilantro when adding chicken. Simmer for a minimum of 1hr and longer is better.

I make this for our office "family lunch" from time to time and it's always a huge hit. Definitely keep the sour cream and shredded cheese on the side - it's rich enough already, but nice to be able to kick it up if need be. Blending half the beans with an immersion blender really does a nice job of thickening it up without making it heavy. A total keeper!

This was delicious! We served this to a crowd of family over Christmas, and everyone seemed to like it. We'll definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe a few times for parties, but have never reviewed it. One of the reasons is that I have never really eaten it. I eat vegetarian most of the time, so I have passed it over, but have always gotten rave reviews and had people ask for the recipe. Anyway, we got a free range Heritage turkey for Thanksgiving, and I thought "What the heck?". I decided to try this recipe with turkey to use up some of the leftovers. I used homemade turkey stock that I just made yesterday from the carcass. Other than that, I followed the recipe closely. I used ancho chile powder and Tabasco as the hot sauce. This recipe is really rich. I did not add the cheese at the end; I just used it as a garnish on each individual serving, along with chopped green onions and cilantro. I don't think it needs the sour cream at all, but I'm not a huge sour cream fan. Anyway, I would highly recommend this. A bowl of this and a roll is a great and filling dinner. My husband and I will probably get four generous meals out of this. I thought it was a great way to use up leftover turkey.

Sensational... definitely a "go to" recipe in my fall and winter rotaion. Having made this many times... a couple of quick time savers... you don't need the fresh anaheim chilis. Buy smoked canned green chilis; my husband and I have never noticed a difference in flavor. I also try to do 2 cups whole milk and 2 cups half and half just so I don't feel so bad about the amount of fat going into the recipe. Again - no difference in flavor. This is a fabulous dish I have made many times for dinner guests and every time, the recipe is requested!

Very very good. Added one can puréed white beans. Will add more broth next time, because that really thickened things up. Delicious...and well received!

I am usually conservative with four-fork ratings, but this recipe was truly exceptional. Anaheim peppers were not available at my local market, so I used fire-roasted green chiles. The balance of flavors was perfect. Wish it had a bit more heat, which it probably would had I followed the recipe exactly. The recommendation to puree some of the beans was perfect for improving the consistency. A definite keeper!

Great recipe. I used thai chilis and made this particularly spicy. Also, I went with one c 1/2,1/2, one c whole milk, and then one c water to make a bit less rich. Used a tiny bit more flour at the end to thicken it a bit more as well. Oh, any meat will do, really. I used cheese and garlic sausage.

This is outstanding chili! I had a lot of leftover chicken from another recipe so I decided to use it with this recipe. I am so happy that I discovered it. Rich, flavorful and as spicy as you want it. A keeper.

Really good chili. I added some jalapenos and sambal olek for a little extra kick. My siblings couldn't stop wolfing this down. I did find the chili a little soupy so I added a little bit of flour to thicken the chili. Then again, I did use canned beans so I can't really complain when I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

Rating: 3
Tasty! Used 3oz Chipotle (chopped) instead of the peppers to give a warm and slightly smoky flavor, and 3 cans great northern beans (I like beans) instead of the dried, because I wanted to eat it today. I crushed about 1/2 can of the beans to thicken it a bit so that it was not soupy. Turned out awesome.

Rating: 0
Just a comment/suggestion---someone mentioned this soups wasn't as thick as they would have liked, heres a 'tip', just take an imersion hand stick blender & blend some of the beans & this will make the soup thicker. You can also smash them with a *potato masher*

Rating: 4
The whole family really liked this! I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and half milk for half the half and half. It came out perfectly. We cleaned up our garden today so I had a couple ears of corn that I tossed in too. It was a bit rich but very yummy! Oh- there is a mistake-the photo shown is NOT this recipe.

Came home from work looking for a quick chicken chili recipe. Short-cutted all over the place and this still was delicious. Looking forward to actually doing it right and having all the ingredients. But it serves as a great base.

Rating: 4
This is a very delicious, very adapable recipe. I've tried a few different variations on the chili each new time I've made it, and it just keeps improving. A few notes: you really don't have to be too specific about the beans; just about any will work. Personally, I love kidney beans, and they go just fine. Also, instead of anaheim chilies, which offer a nice peppery kind of taste, I use Thai chilies which are a bit sweeter for my fiance who likes peppers less than I do. A word of caution: a lot of other commenters are correct, it is fairly soupy, but that's really easy to remedy as well. Just mix a little extra flour up with some more chicken broth and pour in the mixture. It helps to let it simmer on the stove for a few hours to let it reduce and thicken up. Overall, this is fantastic and very simple to make your own. I've already turned it into a family favourite and lots of people have asked for the recipe.

Warning: this chili looks nothing like the photo. It's a very white and creamy chili. Great taste. Followed the recipe except for the following: I substituted half the half and half for milk, and did not mix in all the cheese and sour cream,but used them as a topping instead. I followed the advise of others and used a rotisserie chicken from the store. Cooking the onions in the butter a bit longer helps them dissolve and thicken the chili.

I would definitely make this again! I made this recipe for my soup exchange at work. I used Serrano Chili's and used Chinese Hot Oil for extra kick instead of the typical hot sauce. I also used ground turkey and low fat 1/2 and 1/2. Everyone loved it!

Rating: 2
I made this as written and it came out too soupy and there is not enough chili flavor, but plenty of heat. Tastes and looks more like a spicy cream of chicken soup than a chili to me. Next time I will follow others advice and cut the half and half to 1 1/2cups instead of 3, and possibly cut back on the chicken broth as well.

Rating: 4
I have played with this recipe and am going back to the original. the only "changes" are enhancements: home made chicken stock, extra roasted peppers for more green, and chunks of boneless chicken, (I never have left overs on a whole chicken). If you are counting calories, this may not be the one for you, or go ahead and change it as I have tried. We just don't put the cheese/sour cream stuff on top (really over kill,) unless you count my kids adding Fritos!

Rating: 4
This was a very rich, creamy chili - even with my replacing the half and half with evaporated milk. And preferring a 'whiter' chili - I replaced the red chili powder with oregano (borrowing from another recipe) and used garlic-chili sauce for the hot sauce. Was still too thick and 'creamy' to my liking so I added a half bottle of white wine (sauvingnon blanc) - this made it perfect.

Come on people! Has ANYONE made this recipe as printed? How can you give a four fork rating when you've changed the whole recipe!

Rating: 4
We made this recipe almost to the letter, but instead of all half and half we substituted skim milk for about half of it to lighten it up a little. Went a little lighter on the cheese too, just sprinkling some on top. It was still thick and creamy, it didn't seem to need the extra fat at all. The fresh cilantro is fantastic with it, and the whole recipe was well worth the prep time. Made it for two people and we had tons of leftovers, which froze great for quick weeknight dinners later.

This recipe works really well with Costco rotisserie chicken. I substituted cheddar for jack and homemade red (uncooked) tomato salsa for green, and it tasted great. I think I'll add the spices while I saute the onions next time. This chili isn't very spicy, but it's got good flavor.

Rating: 4
One great use for 2 leftover rotisserie chickens! I used canned Hatch chilies, just 2, they were spicy. skipped the hot pepper sauce and chili powder. Threw in some smoked paprika & chopped sun-dried toms. I substituted a can of pureed white beans for the half & half. Ditched the butter for olive oil. Rich & delish!

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe! I used only 6 Anaheim chilies, charred on the gas grill and one small can of diced fire roasted green chiles. Sauted diced green bell pepper with the onion. Reduced broth and half and half by one cup each for a thicker chili. Did not use hot pepper sauce. I was careful with the salt having used a Costco rotisserie chicken which I shredded. I also incorporated three links of herb/garlic chicken sausage halved and sliced in 1/4" thick pieces and some chopped, cooked bacon (about 2 tablespoons). Kept sour cream and grated cheese as sides along with fresh cilantro. For the cheese I substituted Trader Joe's Smokey Grated Cheese -- which oomplimented the underlying smoke in the chili.

Rating: 4
This is a delicious chili!!! I've made it multiple times with a few tweaks to the recipe: 1) omit hot sauce, 2) use only 2 cups 1/2 and 1/2; add 1 cup skim milk, and 3) add one can of white beans pureed with a little olive oil. To speed things up a bit, I buy a cooked whole chicken at the grocery store and shred the meat, rather than cooking the chicken myself. I use avocados, green onions, cilantro and sour cream for toppings. We rarely have any leftovers, but if we do, it freezes really well in portion-sized ziploc bags.

Rating: 3
This is a very good recipe. I used olive oil instead of the butter,left out the cheese, hot sauce and white pepper, and pulsed 3.5 cups of home cooked cannelini beans. I cooked the beans in chicken broth, drained the beans, then cooked the four half breasts and three thighs(skin removed) in the broth. The chicken is surrounded by the creamy beans and sauteed chiles, a thing of beauty. Worth repeating and playing with again!

Rating: 4
A family favorite. I used 4 cans of cannellini this time, drained. Not so much broth and half and half. About a cup shy on each. Also, put cheese on the table and let folks do their thing. Left over turkey is also dandy in this. Very adaptable recipe.

A good chili, but a few tweaks are necessary. Puree a cup of the beans--too soupy otherwise. I halved the green chilis and still found it too spicy for kids. Knock back the chili powder and hot sauce if you need it to be mild. Needs some color--add some diced red or green peppers near the end. Definitely needs some time for flavors to meld. Best to make ahead and let sit for half a day or more.

Wow. I recently made this chili for my childrens school for a chili cook-off. Although it did not take top honors, many people asked for the recipe from my children later once they found out who had made it. The chili was rich, with a great smooth and mild taste. It was not hot, but had a nice little kick from the spices. Personal note: I quadrupled this recipe, and it pretty much filled an entire 16- quart stockpot. I did add one extra roasted sweet (bell) pepper, and added 25% more half & half. Also doubled the amount of chicken. After I shredded the sixteen boneless & skinless chicken breasts I had cooked in advance I had almost 30 cups of shredded chicken. (One large, boneless and skinless breast cooked, seems to make about 2 cups of shredded chicken.) I offered the following toppings on the side: Cilantro, chopped green onions (scallions), sour cream, shredded monterey jack cheese, mild salsa.

As other reviews stated, folks were scooping the last bit of chili out of roaster. In fact I had never made chili before and with this recipe received more compliments than anyone else! I also added Smoked Paprika, and added Andouille Saugage & Shrimp for half of chicken. Likewise don't skimp - use all half & half!

I have made this twice. The first time I used canned white beans, canned green chilies (as I could not find the anaheims) and the meat from a rotisserie chicken. The second time I did find fresh anaheims, used non-fat half & half, dried beans, and non-fat sour cream. I cooked skinned & boned chicken breasts and thighs for the meat. Both versions were excellent.

Excellent. I did cut back on the half and half - I used two cups instead of three and subbed a cup of skim. I also used olive oil instead of the butter. I did not have Anaheims, so I roasted and seeded 6 jalapenos and half of one green bell pepper instead. The jalapenos added a nice kick.

I made this over the weekend for superbowl and it was a hit with adults and teenagers alike. It's not hard but time consuming if you soak your own beans etc. I agree with an earlier review that this looks nothing like the picture-they must have used black/red beans instead of white? I used some little navy beans from Whole Foods and they were great, but could easily sub in canned. I also served the sour cream on the side as my chili was a little soupy to begin with.

Each time I make this chili, everyone LOVES it and wants the recipe! One change to the recipe: I use the shredded Monteray Jack and sour cream as sides to add with the cilantro and scallions and do not add it to the chili as the recipe indicates. It is actually an unusually pale chili and looks nothing like the photo online (a mistake?) A hit with all lovers of Mexican cuisine!

This chili has changed the way we think of chicken and chili at our house. I've been making this for the past 3 years at our church's chili event, and everyone asks me weeks in advance if I've going to make "that fabulous chili" again! I've handed this recipe out countless times. It is almost addictive! As with many other cooks, I have exchanged the half and half with whole milk, use rinsed, canned white beans, and even some canned, diced green chilis when time was tight. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Just don't skimp on the side offerings: cilantro, sour cream, and green salsa...they really dress it up and finish the flavors perfectly. The short cuts won't matter...it is still magnificent and everyone will beg for this recipe!

Made this for my HOG friends (Harley Owners Group), who have discerning taste regarding chili. I didn't have Anaheim chillis so I used 1 tbsp. of chipotle sauce; served the salsa, sour cream & Jack cheese on the side. Made it one day ahead and rewarmed in slow cooker. Wow! Everyone loved it and went for seconds,scraping the bottom of the crock pot.

I've tried other white chili recipes but I really like the creaminess of this one. Like thompsonmc I used canned beans and also canned chilis, and I cut the butter and half-and-half just a bit. This was also a huge hit at our casual holiday party, and I will definitely be making it again since the guests scraped the crockpot clean and neither me nor my husband got a bite :)

Ummmmm, ummmmm good! Follow this recipe and you won't be disappointed. My minor changes were 1/2--1% milk and 1/2--half-n-half to cut some fat. I did substitute chipotle chili powder (only 1 tsp) for regular chili powder and that give it just a little more kick. I made this for my garden club Christmas party and they loved it. This one is a keeper. Be sure to put out the toppings--I used chopped cilantro, shredded Jack cheese, scallions and diced avocado. It was hearty and tasty!

This recipe was very good. My husband who doesn't like chicken chili loved this recipe. I only purchased 1/2 the chilies because I couldn't remember what the recipe called for. I also used 2 cups of 1% milk to replace some of the half and half. The recipe makes a lot of chili so it's good for leftovers.

I modified the recipe a bit: used 2 1/2 cans of cannellini beans (white kidney), used about 1/4 stick of butter added olive oil, used 2 cups 2% milk and 1 cup half & half, and used 2 large Pasilla chilis (which i was told are the same as poblanos) and 1 medium size non spicy green chili. I also added a can of corn and a can of Muir Glen diced tomatoes with chilis. These last two ingredients were added after i found that the chili looked quite white... needed some color. I ended up adding waaaay more salt, also more heat. Served with diced avocado and cilantro on top, with corn bread on the side. Yum! I especially enjoyed putting the corn bread right in the bowl. Overall, a great starting point of a recipe and one that you can modify to your own tastes. If i make this again, i will use less milk/half & half to keep it thicker.

I really wanted to like this but it was only okay in taste. I didn't like the texture of the chili at all. It was too watery as well. If the flavor was better I would attempt again with different beans and less liquid but I have better chili recipes than this already.

This was great. I lost some of the chilis by getting them a little too black, but I still had enough to scrape and get the flavor. The only changes I made were using low-fat or non-fat ingredients where I could do that. It still tasted rich and my guests did not know.

Wonderful dish! I will make this again soon. Roasting the peppers was totally worth the little bit of extra effort. For those who thought it was too much effort, you probably didnt cook the peppers enough. If they are truly charred, then the skins and seeds come right off, and it is a breeze. I made some substitutions based on what I had available in my kitchen and am very pleased with the result. I used leftover holiday turkey from my freezer, three cans of great northern beans, two big poblano peppers instead of the Anaheims. My biggest substitution happened because I found myself without milk, half and half, or cream (someone needs to go grocery shopping!), so in desperation, I used a single can of fat free, reduced sodium cream of chicken soup. Because I used the soup, there was less liquid in the recipe, which worked out just fine for a nice hearty chili, without needing to thicken it up by pureeing beans. I did not add salt and did not miss it, but this also could be due to the soup-substitution. Also, some of us in my household are trying to eat just slightly healthier and omitted the sour cream and cheese, and it was still delicious.

Excellent recipe and easy to modify. I too used 3 cans of white northern beans and will use canned chopped chilis the next time. Broiling the anaheim chilis was cumbersome and very messy! I think more chili powder and cumin is called for and I even threw in a couple of teaspoons of oregano. I also used a vietamese hot sauce which gave it a wonderful flavor.

I made this recipe for our chili cook-off and it won in the most surprising category. It was very very good. Things I differently: I added some garlic to the onions and used 4 cans of white beans. I also let it cool overnight in the fridge and then reheated it to serve it. I think that helped the flavors meld together. I plan on making it again soon, but will be experimenting to see if I can bring the fat content down by substituting olive oil for the butter, fat free or reduced fat half and half and light sour cream and cheese. I will also be adding twice the hot sauce or chili powder since the cheese and sour cream reduced the heat to where I could barely taste it. It was definitely very good though.

I made this for a New Year's Eve open house. It was wonderful. I left the cheese and sour cream as optional add ons. I added ten tablespoons of a GOYA product called Recaito, which added a nice cilantro note. I could not find Anaheim chilis, and ended up poaching the chicken with some dried new mexico chilis, and cooking dry white beans with the dried new mexico chilis as well. Most people felt it was better with the spicy green salsa I served on the side. I served it with sides of chopped cilantro, spicy green salsa, montery jack, and chopped red, green and orange bell peppers.

If you play with the recipe a bit it is a very good chili. I used garlic, southwestern packaged chicken, more spices, black and white beans, habanero hot sauce and it turned out very good. I would certainly make it again. I wasn't blown away but it is a solid dish.

This is an outstanding chili variation! Instead of 8 anaheim chilies, I roasted two large ones and removed the capsicum and seeds before chopping finely. I added fresh diced green bell peppers with the onions during the saute. For the chicken, I baked split chicken breasts with a Cholula dry rub seasoning before shredding. Once shredded/chopped, I mixed in more of the Cholula dry seasoning to the chopped chicken, before putting it in the pot. Finally, when the chili was stewing, I added a rinsed can of spicy diced tomatoes. The end result was wonderful!

Like previous reviewers, I used canned Northern and Cannellini beans rather than dried, canned, roasted chilis instead of making my own, a Mojo roasted chicken from the grocer and added mild, Italian sausage. I will definitely make this again!

Mmmm, I love this-- perfect for a chilly/chili :) day. Couple of modifications: canned beans (quicker), olive oil instead of butter, plain soy milk instead of half-and-half (wanted the dish to be non-dairy), and I used 2 dried red peppers instead of the fresh chiles (I don't like a lot of heat). The result was a real quick meal! Also I made sure to simmer for long enough until the dish became good and thick.

I used part whole milk and part half and half to lower the fat and added 1/2 cup hot salsa. I also cut the sour cream in half and ommited the cheese. It was still awesome!

I made this for superbowl. I had this once at a ski lodge as a dip and it was gooooood! I slightly undercooked the beans, maybe I would try canned next time. Really good flavor with the 1/2 & 1/2 and chicken broth. I didn't use any hot sauce but the chili powder and cumin gave it enough kick.

Very good flavor and will be making again. Perfect for my family who are not huge tomato fans yet this dish has a great chili flavor.

I am a soup lover and this is a good recipe! I cheated and hand shredded a store bought rotessire chicken and used canned great northern beans like the others cooks have suggested and it was good to the bone! Very hearty! Can't wait to make it again!

Followed others' suggestion to use evaporated skim milk instead of half-and-half. I also use a rotisserie chicken from the store and canned great northern beans to save time. I've made this several times now. It's a terrific twist on traditional chili recipes. I also now use a mix of Anaheim chilis and Poblanos for a little variety.

If my eyes don't deceive me the picture clearly shows a red bean beef chili!?! Recipe's okay.

Yum. The combination of the creamy texture and the bite of the chili is excellent. I didn't add any chicken, used veggie broth rather than chicken and added an extra green chili for more kick, but otherwise followed the recipe. Even my boyfriend, who can be counted on to protest when I try something new ("But I like the ooolllldd chili!"), really enjoyed it.

This is fabulous on the first day you make it. I did all the modifications mentioned in prev. reviews: adding minced garlic to onions, used fat free half and half, 3 cans of great northern white beans (drained) and rotisserie chicken. My guests were begging me to let them take some home w/them - heck no! This was tooo good!

This was definitely one of the best chicken chili recipes I've run across. I made lower fat by cutting back a bit on the oil, using evaporated skim milk for the half and half, and using reduced fat sour cream for the sour cream. I browned chix breast meat sliced thin as I didn't have any chicken meat already cooked and I think it added a nice depth to the soup base. Also added three cloves minced garlic to the onions as they were sauteeing. I used three cans of great northern beans and a 48 oz can of Swanson's chix broth for the recipe.

Canned beans made the recipe quick and easy. I loved the rich taste and fresh roasted chilies. The only drawback was the color, which was probably operator error. When the cream and the chili powder were combined, my chili looked pink!

Delicious. It smells so good when it's cooking...I couldn't wait to eat it.

Rating: 3
Nice recipe. I used canned beans instead of dried and it seemed to work fine. Instead of mixing in the cheese, I put some in the bottom of each bowl and spooned the chili on top. The salsa on top makes the recipe. Didn't use any sour cream. Plus, I used fat free half and half.

Rating: 3
I didn't give 4 forks as I felt the recipe needed tweaking to get it right or it would have been too soupy and the beans certainly needed to cook for longer. I also upped the heat considerably and added garlic when sauteing the onions. I agree with other reveiwers that cheese and sour cream needed to be on the side. It was thoroughly enjoyed by all and I will be making it often.

Love this recipe! To scale down the calories, I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2, reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat Monterey Jack cheese. The recipe did not suffer using lower fat ingredients.

I'm no gourmet, but I thought this chili was delicious, and my 12 guests were clamoring for more! I used 3 cans of white beans, dried Anaheim chilis (not easy to find!), forgot to put in the cheese, and served cilantro/SC on side. Honestly, I've never served anything so popular! Best prepared the day ahead, more flavor the next day. Yum!

I used ground turkey because it was on hand. I also substituted about 2 T Tierra mixed Chipotle chili powder instead of the fresh chilis. Plus about 2 T Tabasco and only 1 tsp ground cumin. I am puzzled by the red color in the photo. One would think it had tomatoes in it! But the taste was superb and it was an instant winner. Everyone loved it. I will try the shredded chicken next time, but don't be afraid to use browned ground turkey in its place. We served only eight people with one serving left. Don't know where 10-12 servings comes from.

Yum! This soup was really flavorful and the perfect amount of spicy. Next time I will definately use dried beans(I was impatient and used canned navy beans).

What a wonderful recipe! I used dried chilis for the first time and it was great. Would it be better if I used recipe chilis? I don't know. But this is a hit after a day of skiing.

I liked this dish but think it would be almost as good with canned green chiles and canned white beans, especially since the beans don't cook with any flavorings. I toasted the spices before I added them for a better flavor. I used vegetable stock and made part of the batch without chicken and part with, as it is easy to keep them separate for vegetarians.

Rating: 3
Great blend of flavors. I used whole milk instead of half and half and green chili powder I obtained in N.M. - gave it a nice creamy green color. Be careful not to handle the seeds when preping the peppers - your fingers will burn!

I commented on this recipe about a year ago (cook from St Louis who won a company chili cook-off) and had to improvise with the next round (with a great result.) 1.) I used BBQ rotisserie chicken pre-made from grocery store, yielded 4 cups 2.) My grocer only had 4 anaheim chilies left. I followed the roasting instructions for those four, then, I used a small can of chopped green chilies and about 5 canned chipotle chilies in adobo sauce. 3.) Trick with the sauce - onions + flour mixture requires a very even, very constant stirring. When adding the broth and half and half, when it says gradually - REALLY ADD SLOWLY, stir and stir it for the best consistency. 4.) I used 3 cans of beans - navy beans, white kidney beans, and black beans (looks nice with the green and red chilies in cream suace, very festive.) 5.) added dash of DeArbol chili powder 6.) Cilantro is a MUST It was 10 times better than last year. The chipotle added more flavor interest. This recipe is SO good on a cold, wintery night. Excellent for pot-lucks, get-togethers, that type of thing.

I took this chili to my friends birthday chili cook-off and got best in show. I followed everthing to the tee except for the chiken, I bought it already done in order to save some time. I did do packaged beans, not canned which came out great. Everyone loved it and thought it was the best chili. I would suggest anyone who abrehensive about making it to let them know that they won't be disappointed.

Rating: 4
I will agree with BlazinBob - I use a rotisserie chicken to save time and go with the BBQ variety when available. BBQ flavor compliments the other flavors very nicely. I used a combo of half and half and reduced fat milk. I've had many requests for this recipe after friends taste it!

Rating: 3
I wanted to add that the second time I made this I bought a "Lemon-Herb" rot. chicken from the store to save time and it didn't play nice with the half and half in the recipe. Apparently the lemon was too lemony. If you buy a pre-cooked rot. chicken, go for the "plain" or BBQ and shred the meat for a time saver.

I liked the dish, though traditional chili it isn't. BTW the picture displayed with the recipe is not the chili described, this was an RSVP recipe in Bon Apetit and there was no picture. I prepared it as described only I used 6 chilis instead of 8 and added some chipotle powder instead of hot sauce. I also added the powdered seasonings to the shredded chicken and stir fried it in a little butter before adding it to the pot to help bring out the flavor. I also deglazed the fry pan with a little stock before dumping the chicken in with the beans. The chili is plenty rich without adding the cheese and sour cream to the dish, I served those on the side. I think the beans needed to cook a little longer than described too. Salt to your taste, the two teaspoons described isn't near enough IMHO. Overall very rich and tastey, a nice twist to the red bean and ground beef chili we're used to and it got good reviews from the crowd.

Rating: 3
I made this for our annual chili cookoff and pupmkin carving. It was yummy and I'll definitely make it again. I used whole milk and added some frozen corn. Next time, I'll use more chilis and try using 2% milk since it got pretty thick with the whole milk after simmering a while.

This is the best white chili I've ever had, and it won best chili @ a chili cook-off. I made a few modifications...1 I shredded an entire roasted chicken and 2. I addes about 10 morsels of white chocolate chips, just to give a hint of sweetness, but you would never be able to guess chocolate is in the chili.

This is a late review, but the dish was delicious, first made for a "chilli night party" - 03.03.03 - It was a hit~ Have now done both ways, as listed, or using the substitute of ground turkey - either work, the turkey saves time. Look forward to making again. It does take time.

This is a great recipe! I cut down on the cream used so it wouldn't be too rich, froze the leftovers and it reheated very well. Give this one a try!

If you follow all the directions, this is, at best a 2 forks. However, if you taste the recipe and adjust seasonings (as you should) it becomes a great chili. This recipe was way under seasoned. Keep tasting and seasoning and this is a keeper. Otherwise...it isn't chili, it is a bland chicken and bean soup.

If it's any indication, I made this recipe for an office chili cookoff and won (out of 9 other chilis there.) The reason, I'm sure of, is that this recipe is a great deal different that your average ground-beef-and-kidney beans variety. Be warned - the soup is thin - not a thick n hearty type - which suited me fine but rocked the boat with the traditionalists in the bunch. Fabulous flavor - the poblano chilies were sublime.

Actually, I give this recipe 3.5 stars. It was SO good. I made it for a bday party and everyone LOVED it and asked for the recipe. I did use 1 c whole milk + 2 c half and half, just to reduce the fat a bit. Next time I will probably use all whole milk. It was kind of a pain to broil and peel and chop the chilis, but as I made it on a weekend and planned ahead, not too bad. I will definitely make this again. Very good and very different from traditional chili.

This is a great base chili. I made this with a few changes for a chili cook off to rave reviews!! It is now requested that I bring it - but am not allowed to enter as "unfair advantage" :) I used canned white beans to save time, shredded the meat from a rot. chicken from the grocery store and used pobalano peppers with some adobe sauce (canned, mexican food aisle)- just watch the amounts - mine was the spiciest, and almost too much for those who really like spicy foods. Really, really good, all together, with time to simmer, it took about 2 hours. Actual work time, very minimum. Good luck!!

This is very different yet very good chili. It would be a great alternative to serve along with a more traditional chili. I followed the recipe pretty closely (except I kept the cheese and sour cream on the side) and did not find it spicy at all, which for me is great since I'm not a fan of spicy foods. My husband though thought it needed more heat. I will absolutely make this again!!

I won a chili cookoff with minor alterations to this recipe. The biggest alteration was buying whole spices and roasting them myself and then grinding for the mix. I did not add the cheese into the mix and offered the cilantro and SC as garnishes.

This recipe is GREAT!!! I served it to very picky eaters on Super Bowl Sunday. They came back to visit last weekend and requested I make "that awesome chili again".

I made this for 7 adults, and very little is left. Did not add the cheese or sour cream, but rather put it on the table as a condiment along with green salsa and cilantro. Felt it would be better for everyone to determine richness/spiciness of chili themselves. Tasted wonderful. My husband did me a wonderful favor and grilled the chicken breasts prior to me shredding the chicken. Thank goodness there's enough left over for my husband and me to eat for SuperBowl!

In college I had eaten at a diner with the best white bean chili I have ever had. Ever since then I have searched for a recipe for that chili. This is it. I've already made it twice in two weeks. Tried it with jalepenos the second time, and wished I had stuck with Anaheim.

I made this on a week night with left over chicken, canned beans, store bought roasted red peppers and canned jalapenos. It was quite good and fast which was key. On a weekend I may try it with the dried beans and roast my own peppers. I would have liked more spice. I put in 3 jalapenos (I halved the recipe as well) and some hot sauce. The salsa verde I used had some spice but it still could have used more.

Extraordinary...all the group loved it & wanted the recipe. I made 2 changes - using whole milk instead of the 1/2 & 1/2 and using 2 cans of Great Northern white beans instead of soaking small white beans (time contraints). Very easy to make, and heated up a second and third time very well.
