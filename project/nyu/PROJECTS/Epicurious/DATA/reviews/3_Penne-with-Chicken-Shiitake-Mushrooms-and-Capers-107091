Family liked it, broth kids and adults. I made the changes with the amounts of wine and broth. Also with the rosemary, although i dont think that was needed. To thicken it up I used some heavy cream and goat cheese. Also added some broccoli.

excellent did take advice of others and cut the broth (used one can) and added a bit more wine. I did not have Penne pasta, but still wonderful with whole grain spagetti. Keeper!

Should have read reviewer comments before making this. I agree with all of them. Yes, it was some work but with only two of us in the house, it makes excellent left-overs. Next time I will more than double the rosemary and capers; reduce chicken broth to 1 3/4 cups and increase wine to 1 1/2 cups. Also used baby bella mushrooms -- 1 1/2 lbs is a lot but one Costco box was perfect. Considering we will have six meals from this one recipe, it was very economical -- less than $2 per serving.

These are the changes I made to the original recipe: doubled (or more) the rosemary, 1 2/3 cups chicken broth, 1 1/3 cups wine, extra garlic, extra capers, substituted 1 lb mild Italian sausage for chicken and criminis for shiitakes, and accidentally forgot the parsley It was mighty tasty (and, using criminis, much cheaper than buying 1 1/2 lbs of shiitake mushrooms), and very easy. I didn't find it bland or too much work, as other reviews described, but obviously the sausage is more flavorful than chicken. Still, mushrooms/garlic/Parmesan/rosemary is a killer combination, so I think I would have enjoyed this regardless. Next time, I would use less liquid because the pasta didn't absorb it all, and a little less than 1 tablespoon of capers. Other than that, this is a winner. Really do be sure to cook the onions and the mushrooms for long enough, and stir enough that they don't scorch. The recommended times in the recipe are pretty accurate. Getting the pasta involves cooking it 1-2 minutes less than recommended on the box before tossing it in with the sauce. Good Parmigiano Reggiano never hurts.

I was a bit wary to try this after the mixed reviews but I figured a chacun son gout and I was right! This was sooooo tasty. the capers are a nice touch and the rosemary (can't go wrong with rosemary). This dish was superb!

We really enjoyed this recipe and will definitely add it to our keeper file. The flavors were balanced and flavorful. It was extremely enjoyable and with a great California chardonnay it was an unbeatable combination. We added more garlic, less chicken broth, more white wine (make sure you use a good white wine), and some great tasting mushrooms, and you will create an exceptional dish!

This was a pretty good recipe. After reading the reviews, I made the following changes which I think helped a lot: I doubled the garlic, added sun- dried tomatoes, used marsala for the wine, used extra wine and a lot less broth, I added what looked right (about half the broth knowing I had doubled the wine.) totally forgot the part with the flour but, since I use less liquid, the sauce was fine.

I made this dish and followed the recipe exactly. I generously used salt and pepper. My family loved the pasta and thought the taste was exceptional. I will definitely make this one a kepper.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish so much. Since shitakes are on the pricey side, I used baby bellos which worked beautifully. I would use more wine, more capers and go w/ 1 cup of chicken broth. Other than that, it was great.

Rating: 2
Just so-so. To solve the excess liquid issue from previous reviews, I drained the pasta before it was al dente and added to the sauce. Turned up the heat, put the lid on and let the pasta finish cooking while absorbing some liquid. Still, the overall dish was bland considering the range of ingredients. Extra rosemary and red pepper flakes might help.

I really liked this dish even though I'm usually a fan of more robust flavors. I did add extra garlic and capers, as other suggested, and caramelized the onions on high heat. Plus I added more wine and less chicken broth. Very tasty with a glass of white wine. Make sure not to overcook the chicken when browning (leave it somewhat pink)or it will lose flavor and tenderness during the simmering.

I decided to make this recipe despite the mixt reviews. Well, I should have listened to the reviewers. This dish was okay in taste, but it took me a lot of time for a pasta dish. Really not worth the effort. I'll keep looking for better pasta recipes.

Overall, this dish was very flavorful. I substituted cream sherry for wine, pearl onions for the red onion, and I used a mixture of fresh shiitake, dried shiitake and button mushrooms. With the revisions, I would definitely make this recipe again.

End result tasted like a little like chicken marsala (probably because of all the mushrooms and wine). It was tasty but a lot of work for what the result was. Tried adding prosciutto as someone suggested, but it didn't make the flavor unique. Not sure what I did wrong if it was supposed to taste much better...

This dish was tasty, but I doubt I'll make it again. We enjoyed it, but there wasn't anything compelling us to add it to our "staple" dishes. I used shiitakes & creminis and used a cup of wine because I didn't have enough stock. It seemed very brothy - but again, tasty.

This was just excellent, and the leftovers were just as good reheated. Begin by brining the chicken, as always. I substituted dry sake for the wine, to keep the pseudo-japanese theme suggested by the shiitakes. I also grated asiago in place of the parmesan. Next time I'll try it with portobellos and porcinis instead of the shiitakes (as the other reviewer wrote, it's hard to find fresh ones worth eating), and substitute dry vermouth for the wine/sake. The more onion the merrier in this dish. I disagree with the other reviewers who found the recipe bland. Perhaps they were using a poor quality parmesan cheese, which will have a milder flavor than romano or the asiago I used. We added a touch of salt at the table, but otherwise enjoyed this as is.

Had some amazing truffle tortellini I used instead of the penne, so I left out the capers & used thyme instead of rosemary. Excellent, will definitely make again.

Fresh shitakes add a very distinctive and delicious flavour. I think a key in developing the flavour of this dish is the carmelization of the onions and the slow braising of the mushrooms. Don't skimp on the times - 10 minutes or longer for the onions and 15 minutes or longer for the mushrooms. I used canned chicken broth which was not low-salt. This was very yummy and different. Light too, I think, if you take it easy with the olive oil.

Was looking for a pasta recipe without tomatoes and pesto. Tried this but was very bland even with extra garlic and capers. I added procuitto pieces, 1 tsp. dried oregano, 1 tsp. dried thyme and a squeeze of lemon juice. Picked this baby right up and made it great!

I made this dish with baby portabella mushrooms instead of shiitakes (my supermarket didn't have them). It didn't seem like the amount of garlic and capers suggested in this recipe would be enough so I used a whole small head of garlic and a whole jar of capers and was glad I did!! My version may have come out a little thicker than it was supposed to because of the mushrooms but was soooooooooo delicious. Next time I will use shiitakes and just a little more chicken (cut into smaller pieces). My fiance & I enjoyed this dish more with every bite and will have leftovers tomorrow. Will definitely make again!

We thought it was excellent - in future would increase capers (50%) and eliminate excess flower more completely to slightly increase liquidty of sauce - chicken needs to be cut to "bite size" pieces

My family LOVES this recipe. It does need a lot of parmesan cheese to top it off. Feeds 5 adults with a lot leftover.

We really enjoyed this dish. Based on past reviews... added more garlic, some shallots and thin sliced red peppers to onions. I also used sherry, (and lots of it), with the mushrooms and in place of the wine. Slightly under cook, then add all to pot, and simmer. Lots of flavor, easy to make.

We enjoyed this dish very much, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. My S.O. thought it was excellent, but I was only a bit less enthusiastic. The flavors did blend well, but it was missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. I would use less mushrooms and more capers next time. Needed more chicken broth as well and also more garlic. The onions gave it a nice flavor. Parsely and cheese added a great blend and gave it more flavor. Use a quality parmesan or even an asiago cheese. Bread on the side is a must!

We weren't sure how dinner was going to be but the more we ate, the better it tasted. I guess it grew on us! My suggestions are to cut back on the amount of pasta and use lots of parmesan cheese.

Bland Bland Balnd. Very disappointing. I even doubled the garlic, added crushed red peppers. I wish I had logged on to Epicurious and read the reviews rather than just making it from Bon Appétit, I would have saved myself the effort.

I would give this a 2.5..... The recipe definitely needs more flavor. I agree that the capers are a must since they are the only flavor that stands out. For 2, I halved the recipe and used 6 oz. of pasta instead of 8 and it was plenty. I used a combination of shiitakes and crimini's since the shiitakes were $3.99 for a 3.2 oz package!! I found that dusting the chicken with flour made for VERY moist, tender chicken bites. Maybe add some pepper for color but be sure and keep the salt and pepper handy!! All in all the recipe is good and served well for a weeknight dinner.

This was awesome! Easy to make, and even someone who hates mushrooms loved it and ate every bite. This is one I'll make again and again.

For the amount of work and time that goes into this recipe, it has very little flavor. We followed the recipe as written, including the amount of capers (rinsed) and found it to be very bland. I won't be making this recipe again, anytime soon!

I have a similiar recipe that calls for sherry instead of wine- vastly improves the flavor, imho. I have played with the types of mushrooms, and favor a mixture. Also have added zuccini with good results. Variation: add 1/2 cup cream for a nice cream-sherry sauce.

Rating: 3
A bit more complicated than it needs to be. I'd leave out the flour and prefer just to glaze the onions not to brown them. As far as the capers are concerened, I happen to love them and they are pretty integral to the taste of the dish. For those that find them too salty, I suggest washing/soaking them them first.

I thought this dish was good, not great. I have another recipe with similar taste and not as much work. I won't repeat this one.

Rating: 3
This was very similar to one of my favorite recipies so I tried it and it came out great. I hate capers so I left them out and added more garlic. I used half shitake, half crimini mushrooms since the store was out of shitake. Next time I will play around with adding different veggies too.

Good basic recipe. The capers were a bit salty for my taste. I'll make again and reduce the amount of capers.
