I make this for guests a lot. It may not be very fancy but it appeals to a wide range of tastes. (Even my kids love it) It goes together fast and is easy to double or triple for a large crowd. Make sure to mix the noodles and sauce on the stove for at least five minutes to thicken up the sauce. It sticks nicely to the noodles.

Super easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and would use a little less butter next time, otherwise, no changes. The peppery arugula and sweet fig salad compliment this dish wonderfully. We opened a Pinot Gris to go with this. I thought it helped cut through the richness. Will definately make this again.

A little heavy with all the cream, butter and oil but very good. I would serve this to guests in a pinch because I had everything on hand but the basil. The first time I made it I used a roux to thicken it up a bit and have been doing that since. I also prefer chopped clams more than the baby clams called for.

I've made this dish several times - and it's always delicious. In fact, I'd lost the recipe, and had to come back to epicurious to find it. I'm surprised at all the hullaballoo this recipe caused! Everybody mellow out - have a glass of wine - Pinot Blanc was good with this dish!

We loved this dish. I added a TBL of white worcheshire, lemon juice w/zest and used chopped clams (1 can for 2 servings, 2 for 4 servings.) Liked it better than when I used the whole clams. A bottle of clam juice added the additional liquid. Simple & fast to make--good for summer.

This was an OK dish. I would have like more depth of flavor. I may make it again, because I like clams and anchovies....

OK so maybe it's not the most authentic dish. I too was skeptical about the canned clams, But I made this for some VERY picky eaters who always say not to make anything "weird"(sigh). They loved it! Great flavor. Comfort food that's what I would call it.

To the very negative reviewer from Tel Aviv: If you didn't care for the recipe, why don't you just say what you thought was problematic? What on earth does anyone have to gain by being so hateful? If you don't like America, I'd suggest that you consider all that you and your country gain from ours. Life is too short for your attitude. (Sorry, Epicurious, I know this isn't a political arena, but this really useful website doesn't need such criticism.)

i don't know if i did something very wrong in following this recipe, but it came out awful. maybe i had too high expectations for it after everyone's reviews. the baby clams (canned) were tasteless, looked like little alien insides swimming in cream, made too thin with the juices/wine, plus there were little bits of clam shells here and there. maybe i could spice it up with more garlic, etc, but it really wouldn't be worth it, since it's inherently tasteless anyway.

Gee, after reading all these reviews I guess things got pretty heated over this recipe. I wish the reviews that stirred everyone up were still available to read!!Anyway, I loved this recipe. It's very rich and it sure ain't low cal but it's worth it. Of course I added more garlic as I do to every recipe, but other than that I didn't change anything. I didn't use the lemon wedged but I can see where lemon juice might brighten it up a bit. I will make this again.

Its so ridiculous when people pick apart spelling and grammar in such a casual forum. So you strike a wrong key or aren't writing your review with a dictionary by your side...the point is communication, not turning out a polished essay. And obviously, the corrector's on this site know what the misspelled words were supposed to be, or else how could they correct it? It's petty and anal and very annoying. Care to correct this? I stuck in a few mistakes for your pleasure.

I am amazed. I check in here now and then as I have obtained some wonderful recipes, and even better ideas to improve such. Clams are not everyones favorite food item. Its that simple, lets move on.

Ok, well I made this recipe, but i used fresh chopped clams instead of canned, and you know everyone liked it, it was simple and quick, when you dont have time to go all out, this will do just fine, we would eat it again for sure, and geez why do people get to touchy. its just a recipe site, and for god sakes you dont have to cook any of it, no one is making you LOL!!!!

I loved this dish. All the ingredients are easy to keep on hand. I was very skeptical about the anchovies, but kept with the recipe and it turned out excellent. My husband loved it. Not a hugely fancy dish, but oh so good and easy to make! I definately will make it again.

It tasted mostly like anchovies and hot pepper flakes - not like clams. Good for non-clam lovers but not really worth making again. So many recipes, so little time....

Had some leftover anchovies from Easter's Caeser Salad, and capers laying around in frig., so this looked like a good fit despite the controversary re its origins. My wife is anchovy intolerant, mentally, and caper shy, but, because I was cooking, she kept her peace. As a matter of fact, she had seconds, but she may have been starving. The texture and flavors are really quite nice, and the meal was excellent. No problem making again. I used dried basil, just about half of the fresh requirement. Used a little grated parmesan at the table, but did not use the lemon wedges. Nice.

I loved this recipe. Sooooo. . . tasty! Easy to make and WOW!!! I'm cooking real Sicilian food for my Sicilian husband. He loved it. Muchas Gracias to the cook who dreamed this up. Please more recipes like this. Chiao.

Not a bad recipe, not great but not horrible either. (I probably shouldn't have rated it as I didn't follow it exactly and I know how that really gets certain people into a tizzy) I chose to use fresh clams and added red pepper flakes. Growing up on the Cape and always having cheap and easy access to fresh I can never bring myself to eat canned clams-something about the texture. They really change in the canning process and seem to get "mushy". Give me fresh ones any day! However if you have never had fresh you might not even know the difference!

I tried this dish; it was Ok to fairly Good! I tried it with fresh ingredients too; only slightly better this way, but when considering the extra time and work not much gain. I don't see that cook's review who was offering his recipe for clam sauce. I would like his recipe if he or someone has his address. Why was it removed?

This was such a simple recipe to make. Everyone I served it to thought I slaved over the stove. It's a definate keeper. I will make this one again.

As an earlier reviewer remarked, this is a handy recipe when you have nothing in the fridge. Used linguine instead of spaghettini, and added a touch of red pepper flakes. Nothing sophisticated, but it was a good weeknight dinner. P.S. - I don't understand why some people are freaking out over this recipe. It's obvious from the list of ingredients that the recipe doesn't pretend to be something sophisticated.

I tried this recipe (yes, I actually made this dish, so I can comment on it), and it was pretty tasty...although I didn't have fresh basil. It's a good stand-by recipe that you can make with pantry staples when you don't have fresh stuff in the fridge. I liked it, but I also realize it's not the most "show off to your guests" kind of dish. By the way, California(3/23) and NJ (3/24)should chill out. How about some civility?

This is delicious and so easy! I did use fresh clams and was so pleased witht he way the sauce came together at the end.

This receipe was fabulous!!! Hands down, the best clam sauce receipe I have ever made. This is restaurant quality for sure. Don't be afraid of the amount of anchovies, and don't taste as you go. It will appear too salty, but when finished it is just perfect. I didn't read any of the reviews before making this dish, and therefore wasn't tainted by the crosstalk. Try it, I am sure you will enjoy it.

This really is outstanding. Don't be concerned about the thin concistancy of the sauce. If you toss over med/high as the recipe dictates it is perfect.

This recipe was so delicious!! All of the ingredients were ritht there in the supermarket. No specialty stores needed. The flavors were great. And sooo easy too. Next time I will try it with the fig and arugula salad.

I prepared this for lunch, wouldn't change a thing. Big deal if the clams are canned, I have an entire pantry filled with "canned goods", which means I have access to seasonal foods year round.

This is about as authentic Sicilian as McDonald's Big Macs. Sicilians don't use cream ... EVER ... they don't have cows ... they use goats and sheep ... the milk of which almost always goes to make cheese. DUH!

Oops.....I said below that "we" liked this dish. I was wrong. My wife says she will divorce me if i make this again, but now I'm out of clams!

Oh Mama, that was great! I made it for my wife while she was out power walking. Earlier we had gone to my favorite grocery store to get a few ingredients (obviously it was earlier. Hard to mae it and then get the ingredients). The fresh basil was all wilted. So I went to the produce guy and he brought out the freshest basil for us. I couldn't believe how good it smelled. My wife said it looked like too many clams, but if it says 2 tons of clams in a recipe, I'm renting a truck. It was perfect. I made fresh, bread sticks to go with it. My grocery store has a section of deluxe salad greens and you can mix them altogether at the same price. We had white wine and Dean Martin singing, "If our lips should touch innamorata (sweetheart)." Fantastic, give it a try.

This was great for a quick, easy pasta dish. My husband inhaled it! I added some crushed red pepper for a little more zing.
