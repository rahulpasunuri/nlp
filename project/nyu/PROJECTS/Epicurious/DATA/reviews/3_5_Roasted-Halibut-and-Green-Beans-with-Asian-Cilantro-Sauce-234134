What a fabulous and easy dinner. Came together quickly and was delicious. I threw some cherry tomatoes onto the roasting pan which added some color and rounded out the flavors. Otherwise, no changes. Get a nice piece of fish and MAKE THIS FOR DINNER! It's now going in our regular rotation.

Love the sauce this makes. I did not have a fresh jalapeno so I used a spoonful from a jar of sliced jalapenos. This is good with any kind of fish, pork, chicken or even steak. Love this recipe!

Outstanding! The fishmonger had a beautiful, very fresh piece of cod so I made that sub. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Oh, no shiitakes either...forgot to pick them up at the store. Didn't miss them. The sauce is wonderful and light. Great for perking up a winter meal. The sauce will be very good on other meats.

Awesome flavorful recipe that comes together in a snap. Made it after coming home from the gym along with steamed purple potatoes. Only change was that I used tilapia straight from the freezer and cooked for 15 min.

AMAZING. I am not a fan of cilantro so i did not include it and simply sprinkled parsley on top. it was delicious! so fresh especially with the lemon and ginger.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Gotta like cilantro. The sauce is what makes this dish so tasty. Made it using 1/2 tsp sambal oelek (Asian garlic chile paste) and canola oil as that was what I had, and that was just enough spice for my taste...when the chile doesn't overpower the rest of the ingredients. Yum! It's in my recipe box; Great to know this sauce can be used to spice up just about any other protein meal.

It was good, not great. I would highly, I mean HIGHLY suggest cutting back on the Jalapeno. It's extremely overwhelming and doesn't allow the other flavors to come out. Besides that it was good.

This was oh-so simple and just outstanding. I omitted the mushrooms since I didn't have any, but otherwise followed to the letter. This is a new standard in our house!

I made this dish for dinner and it was amazing! I added 2 jalapenos and the juice of 2 lemons as well as garlic to the sauce. I kept everything else the same and it turned out great! I would definitely make this again!

Excellent! The halibut and green beans & mushrooms can stand on their own. Cilantro sauce is wonderful and can go with chicken or shrimp just as easily.

Rating: 4
Given how easy this is to prepare, in addition to being delicious, I have to give it 4 forks! I will be making this again and again. I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't make any changes. I don't think the sauce needs to be seasoned with salt - I think the salty flavor from the soy sauce is enough - but salt is always a matter of personal preference. I served this over plain couscous and there were no left-overs! Enjoy!

I made the recipe for guests, exactly as directed, using large oyster mushrooms sliced into long narrow strips tossed with haricot verts, and served with jasmine rice. Really a fantastic dish.

The sauce is delicious, and goes very well with the fish and vegetables. My girlfriend said she could eat this dish every day.

Since I love cilantro, this recipe caught my eye. The sauce was good even though I couldn't find safflower oil. I ended up using vegetable oil in its place. Also accidently added 2 Tbsp. of sesame oil instead of 2 tsp so it was a bit on the oily side. Since halibut was pretty pricey, used tilapia in its place. Irregardless thought this was a good recipe and would make again.

Rating: 4
this was a great, simple recipe. i decided to modify the recipe a bit and poach the fish instead of roasting in the open. i wasn't sure from the instructions if i should add the cilantro sauce before or after roasting, so i just drizzled it over the fish and veggies beforehand. wrapped everything in a nice foil pocket and baked for 12 minutes. perfection!

Fabulous . Used chili oil instead of jalapeno and brown beech mushrooms instead of shitake as my grocerer was out of them. Nice with rice and a glass of white wine. Sauce can be too heavy so I recommend putting the halibut and then put on side.

A very easy recipe and I made it on a weeknight. The sauce is really delicious!The beans and mushrooms baked up with a lot of flavor, too. I will save this one.

Excellent flavor in the sauce, and the fish and vegetables cooked nicely, although it took a few minutes longer than suggested. I had some extra and will save to try with some other meat. This was an easy dish and you could easily substitute/vary the roasted vegetables.

Wow! We made this as written, and found it very easy. And then when we tasted it....WOW!!! DELICIOUS!!! This is an awesome and easy recipe, and will be served at our table for company in the near future.

Delicious and straight-forward with a wonderful aroma ... I used fresh frozen wild halibut (Costco), a bag of haricots verts (Trader Joes) and generic mushrooms for the base. After tasting the sauce, I bumped up the sesame oil to 2 tablespoons, increased the lemon juice to that of one whole lemon and added several cloves of fresh elephant garlic (from a friend's garden, lucky me!), sea salt and 1 tablespoon sugar to balance. Served with white basmati rice. Definitely something for my recipe file and to share with friends who enjoy eating fish and cooking from scratch.

My husband declared, "I would pay money for this dish!" We loved everything about it and it was so easy to prepare. We couldn't get enough of the sauce-- we used up almost all of it for the fish and veggies. I prepared it as is but used regular vegetable oil since I didn't have safflower on hand. I also had to bake for about 12 minutes rather than the suggested time.

delicious! my boyfriend said this was the best dish that i'd ever made. served with beans and wasabi mashed potatoes also found on this website.

This dish failed to impress. I expected more punch from the sauce and more of an overall sesame flavor. Quick and easy, but disapointing.

Rating: 3
This comes close to being a perfect recipe: easy, quick, colorful and delicious! I do recommend parboiling the green beans ahead of time and increasing the cooking time -- the fish was not quite done at 8 minutes and the beans were still very crunchy. The sauce is out of this world and could be used for a lot of things. We mixed it into the brown rice that we served along with the fish. I plan to make extra batches next time and freeze them for use with other dishes.

Made this last night and it was a huge hit. I meant to add garlic but forgot, but can't say I missed it. Given how easy, quick and delicious it was, it will become a weeknight staple for us.

Made this last night with fresh halibut fillet. My husband couldn't stop praising me for the delish dinner. Good enough for company dinner. This is definitely a repeat.

We thought this dish was delicious also!! Did not use jalapeno and it was still very good. Only thing was I could not fit everything on (1) rimmed cooking sheet, it seemed like I had a lot of mushrooms & beans and couldn't fit the fish, so I used an extra pan to roast the fish. Did anyone else have this problem?

Loved it! Didn't have beans on hand, but roasted brussel sprouts, Asparagus would be great also. Delightful and easy.

I was worried that something so easy couldn't possibly be flavorful, but was pleasantly surprised. This was quite tasty. I did add fresh garlic to the sauce, but made it as written otherwise. I think this will go into the "what to do with fish" section of my recipe book.

The asian sauce on this was great...I got the thin green beans from Trader Joes, put them in the micro first for 1/1/2 minutes before adding next to the fish...they were not the least bit soggy...very good taste, we didn't have rice...used extra mushrooms as we love those as well.

Rating: 4
This is one of the best recipes out of a magazine I've ever made. I served this with quinoa but rice would work well too. I served this with chilled sake to drink. I think 1/2 to 2/3 of the cilantro sauce recipe would be adequate for 2 servings.

Rating: 4
Fantastic enough that we made it two nights in a row...though substituted cod the second night as we couldn't afford halibut for 7 people. It was much spicier the second night, I think because we pureed it much more and crushed the jalapeno seeds more. I'm going to try and mix theleftover sauce with coconut milk and some broth to make a Thai-like sauce for the leftover veggies and rice.

Rating: 3
So good! I added a couple cloves of garlic and doubled the recipe. I used red pepper flakes instead of Jalepeno (didn't have them on hand). I bought frozen halibut from Trader Joes, and is was more than acceptable. I brushed the fish with the sauce after putting the other mixture on the veggies and fish, and then put more on after. Very delicious. Served with brown rice. YUM!

Great recipe. Very different combination of flavors. I doubled recipe for four and it made ample sauce. I served it with mashed potatoes.

Excellent spring/summer dish. Easy, and following the advice of other readers, I parboiled the green beans first just until tender crisp. I then mixed the beans and mushrooms together and spread around the fish. By doing that and cooking the beans along with the fish they came out perfect. It took about 15 minutes for my halibut to cook. I did have two rather large pieces which fed 4 people. I have a gas oven, and it tends not to get as hot as an electric one so my cooking time is usually a little longer. I also doubled the amount of sauce I brushed the fish and vegetables with. Served this with lime/cilantro Japanese sticky rice. I preheated serving plates then placed the cilantro sauce in the middle, fish on top and drizzled a little over the fish, rice and vegetables. Our entire family loved this. Served this with a nice crisp sauvigon blanc.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful. I left out some of the indicated oil in the accompanying "sauce"- worked well- just more of a spread consistency. I also had to cook the fish a bit longer than indicated. Absolutely delightful meal!!!

This was wonderful. Changes: used long, red chili pepper (seeded) instead of jalapeno; mixture of "exotic" mushrooms and in greater quantity; had to bake for 12 minutes. Moist and flavorful -- beautiful on the plate. Easy to prepare basics earlier in day. Would not hesitate to make this when entertaining.

My husband and I were both very impressed with flavours. The sauce will be used for other seafood dishes as well.

Rating: 3
I thought the flavors in this dish were fantastic, especially the shiitakes. I did double the the oils and soy sauce that was drizzled on before baking (and I think I used more mushrooms) Also, the pureed sauce seemed to me more of a chutney so I heated it on the stove and added a little extra of the oils and lemon juice as well as a litlle milk (although white wine would have been better)to thin it out a bit. But, all in all great flavors and nice spice. I reccomend using a whole serrano for a little more spice. I served it with rice .

My boyfriend called this dish transcendent. I will definitely make it again. My fish market didn't have halibut so I substituted mahi mahi and it worked out well. The recipe instructions are unnecessarily confusing. This is actually quite a simple dish. Epicurious editors should go back and edit for clarity. The dish is phenomenal.

I haven't made this....was just reading recipes, but am amazed at the number of people who are at a loss as to what to do with the "sauce"...it usually goes over what you have cooked.

Delicious, healthy, easy and relatively short prep time (if have a food processor). Also, not much to clean up, so great for a weekday dinner! I would give this a 3.5 fork rating, it's just that there are some other fish recipes on Epicurious that taste even better and get a 4 fork rating from me.

omg, this made me post for the first time. Delicious & so easy! 3.5 stars. My husband & teens are not fans of fish but declared this dish worthy of making again. Used cod instead of halibut, portabellos & asparagus (what I had on hand). Beautiful presentation...made a circle of sauce placing fish in centre, draped asparagus on top w/portabellos & grape tomatoes beside. Served with jasmine rice & asian coleslaw. Sure to impress guests. My family was.

I froze the extra sauce, thawed it [in the frig overnight] and used it for another two servings of halibut for just the two of us. The sauce was as good as it was the first time I made it.

Great recipe; very interesting mix of flavors. Cooked fish/beans/mushroom mix a few minutes longer. The only thing that is a bit time consuming is the sauce prep; but can be done ahead of time. Served with Asian Cole Slaw from your website (Mar.1996); dinner was quite a hit with our guests--will definitely prepare this recipe again.

This was a wonderful dish; however, I would omit the vegetables and add steamed rice with black sesame seeds sprinkled on top for color along with your choice of vegetables to give a more balanced array of flavors.

The first five ingredients pureed comprise the sauce, which you've seasoned to taste and which the recipe later instructs you to divide between the plates.

Indeed, would you editors at Epicurious 'repair' this receipe and add exactly what to do with the first five ingredients in the list? I can guess, of course. But it would be nice for you to correct this obvious mistake. Also, what other fish could be used? Tilapia?

You can substitute parsley for cilantro. However, it will change the flavor substantially.

I would feel free to substitute canola for safflower. Both have similar scorch temps and both are relatively tasteless. In some asian recipes, I would not sub for peanut oil (except for allergies) because of its distinctive flavor.

Just a quick question, as I'll be preparing this recipe this weekend: would it be possible to substitute Canola oil for the Safflower oil? I generally keep only Canola and Extra Virgin olive oils in my kitchen.... Thanks

This was great and easy to make. I recommend making the sauce ahead of time. Great flavor...especially if you use nice fresh halibut. Like someone else said, the beans don't really soften up in the oven, they stay fairly crunchy - not in a bad way. I used oyster mushrooms and they were a perfect accompaniment to the dish. I will be making this again soon!

RE: the dark sesame oil...Is it "toasted" sesame oil, because that is usually dark and since it's toasted...well. This dish was excellent! Anyone got ideas for another type of fish for this recipe?

Rating: 2
This was disappointing. I found the sauce overpowered the fish and the beans never got beyond crunchy even after cooking it another 4 minutes. Would parboil them first if making it again. Sauce was good, but too much for halibut's delicate flavor.

In response to the question about sesame oil, yes, it's the dark kind. The safflower oil is serving as the cooking oil in this recipe, and the small amount of sesame oil is just for flavor.

Haddock works well with this dish, too. At first, I was worried that the sauce was too spicy. But once it's with the fish, the spiciness is subdued. Definitely going to make this again.

This was fabulous and easy, exactly as written (or with regular button mushrooms). The sauce is unusually spicy and flavorful - leftover sauce was delicious on potatoes and other vegetables. Enjoy!
