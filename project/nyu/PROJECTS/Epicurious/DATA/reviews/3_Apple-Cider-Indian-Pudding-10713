This is delicious. No, it doesn't look amazing, but tastes incredible. I couldn't stop nibbling, even after if had cooled down. I used the Trader Joe's Jumbo Raisin Medley and would recommend it.

Subsitute maple sugar for the brown sugar for an even better taste. After all, this was the sugar available at the time.

This recipe was a huge disappointment. It was disgusting in appearance and mediocre in flavor. I would never serve this to anyone. Deborah Chud

This is like sweet polenta and tastes (fresh out of the oven) like mock apple crisp, a good thing to my pallete. As it cools tho, it looks unappetisingly like congealed gravy, and loses much of its taste appeal as well. There are better choices, once is enough.

This was very good. I didn't use a double boiler, but cooked everything over direct heat. It turned out fine and was thickened in about 10 min.

This is a delicious, homey dessert that is perfect for the fall or winter. It has a taste that is similar to bread pudding, but with a smoother texture. The only modification that I made, was to use a tablespoon less butter. Next time I might even reduce the butter further, just to make it even healthier. Also, I didn't serve this with ice cream, as I didn't have any, but whipped cream instead. YUM!

This homey recipe is just wonderful. It is delicious and easy to make. I made it for my family for a rather decadent breakfast (with the vanilla ice cream) for Father's Day. Everyone loved it. Thanks Epicurious!

I could eat this for breakfast and dessert three times a day! Kids love it, and several guests I've entertained have asked for the recipe. This is a keeper, a pleaser for all palates!
