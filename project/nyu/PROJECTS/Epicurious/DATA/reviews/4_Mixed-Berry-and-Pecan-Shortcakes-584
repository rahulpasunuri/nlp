This review is for the shortcakes only, which I highly recommend. The pecans add a nice richness and nuttiness without being overpowering. Even made ahead of time, they were moist and delicious.

Did not follow the berry part... but the biscuits are very good! Mixed strawberries with sugar, lemon juice and mint, served with whipped cream instead of ice cream. Great June dessert.

Easy in the food processor and GREAT. When we didn't have buttermilk used regular milk with some yogurt mixed in, which came out wonderfully as well. A big hit-- I prefer with fresh whipped cream over ice cream, but great either way.

A nice change from traditional shortcakes! I used strawberries, blueberries & golden rasperries for color. I got rave reviews, even from the person that doesn't like pecans.

This recipe got rave reviews when I made it. It was also incredibly easy since the biscuits can be made ahead of time. I loved the added texture of the pecans. I did not have buttermilk so I substitued heavy cream and the results were very moist. I am throwing out my old recipe and replacing it with this one. Yummy!!!!!
