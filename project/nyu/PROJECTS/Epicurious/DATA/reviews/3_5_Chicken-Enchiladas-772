This recipe is awesome. I made these the suggested way, with the tortillas, but also made some stuffed into bell peppers and put enchilada sauce on top. just do the recipe as it says, cut off the tops and seed the peppers and bake them until slightly soft. THen fill with the filling and top with enchilada sauce. Cook until bubbly. They turned out soooo good! I served them with a side of spanish rice.

I've made this chicken enchilada recipe for years. It's always a big hit. So tasty and creamy. This is my after-Thanksgiving recipe I make every year with leftover turkey. I do find that it still tastes great even if you don't use the full 8oz of cream cheese. Sometimes I only use 4oz. I use enchilada sauce instead of salsa because it just seems wrong to make enchiladas any other way. :)

I served this recipe for friends with the following modifications- I roasted 3 diced zucchini (fresh from the CSA box!) and used roasted pasilla peppers instead of diced chilies. I split the filling in two to make vegetarian enchiladas and added roasted sweet potatoes to these. The rest I made as prescribed with rotisserie chicken from the freezer. SO GOOD. All of it is gone. This recipe is an absolute keeper. The addition of veggies kept it from being too rich, I think.

Served this for a large party and it was a hit with the adults.(It was too spicy for the children under 13 years old.) Super easy and fast to prepare ahead and then pop in the oven as cocktails start. Made the following modifications: 3 large chicken breasts which yielded about 3 cups of chicken (express poached in microwave with broth); 24 oz of Goya salsa verde instead of the picante; 8 oz of low-fat sour cream; Schmear of low-fat cream cheese on each tortilla (vs. stick); Mexican cheese vs. sharp cheddar; skipped the cilantro; and added hot sauce to taste. I would make it again for a crowd as above but I would skip the hot sauce. If making it for adults only, would keep the hot sauce but still skip the cilantro as verde sauce works fine without and many don't like lots of cilantro (though I love it). BTW DH liked it so much he wants to eat it on a regular basis.

After reading some other cook's comments I made a few modifications and the recipe turned out FANTASTIC! I doubled the chicken. (cooked in a crockpot w/ onion, garlic, diced tomatoes, chipotle powder and cumin) I spread a thin layer of cream cheese on each tortilla instead of using a small block.. I added 1 TBSP of Trader Joe's Jalapeno hot sauce to the mixture. Sprinkled some Mexican cheese ontop of the verde sauce - to add some color/taste. I had enough filling to make a 13x9 pan and 2 Round 9 inch cake pans (layered like lasagna!) Freezing the small ones, since we nearly demolished the 9x13 pan. This is truly a Chicken Suiza Enchilada and is now my MUST have recipe. I served it with sweet corn cake and we all went for seconds!!

I thought this recipe was terrible. WAY too much sour cream, cream cheese and cheese. I used a little extra chicken, maybe 2.5 cups and even used a little less sour cream - still way too much, unless you like just eating a rich sauce mouthful after mouthful. I thought it was gross in that sense, but the flavours were ok. So thus if you made it with less of the aforementioned ingredients, it would probably be alright.

I made this for new year's eve guests and everyone loved it. I agree with previous reviewers that there is way too much sour cream and cream cheese. I cut the sour cream in half and increased the chicken by an additional cup and they were still very creamy. Next time, I will leave out the cream cheese and add black beans. I used salsa verde and it was delicious!

I have made this recipe at least a dozen or so times and it has always been well reeived by guests and family alike. I tried it with fat free cream cheese and it didn't work at all because the cream cheese didn't melt. I tried it with half the amount of regular cream cheese and it was wonderful. I have even made it with a chile verde sauce which also was quite good.

This was very good, although I modified it to be lower in fat and calories. I used about 3/4 c light sour cream (any more really would have been too much). I also used about half the amt. of low fat cheddar and omitted the cream cheese altogether.

I made this recipes almost as written, but I did substitute regular enchilada sauce for the salsa. I also doubled the recipe, but only used enough sour cream and cream cheese for a single recipe. It was definitely rich, but not overpowering. I used good quality corn tortillas for most, but ran out and used some lower quality corn tortillas for the rest-I could taste the difference! I will make these again-they would be great for a potluck!

I have been making these for years but I use corn tortillas, roasted chicken, and a standard green enchilada sauce like Las Palmas. These changes make this recipe a keeper.

This recipe is the closest to my favorite that I lost during a move. I have adjusted it to our tastes by: using a combination of jalapeno-jack cheese with the cheddar. I also spread the cream cheese on the tortilla (great suggestion) and I save some of the sourcream mixture (1/2 cup) and spread it on the top with only 1/2 cup of picante. I do add the cheese after I remove the foil. Although we are Texas transplants after 20 years one becomes accustomed to good Tex-mex, so I agree with the woman who suggested using a good quality picante and fresh tortillas.

This recipe needs a little tweaking. Like others have suggested I will try enchilada sauce instead of salsa and perhaps cut down on the cheese too. I will definetely make this again as it was a tasty use of leftovers!

I customized this recipe which I think made it a 4 fork. Fist I used 1 medium chopped onion instead of green onion. I added more cumin to taste. I used Monterey Jack Cheese instead of sharp cheddar which is so much better in Mexican food. I also used my own homemade which tastes a lot better and easy to do. Find a good salsa recipe and use it. I love guacamole but with enchiladas, I like sliced avocados on top with a few sliced olives along with the cilantro after it comes out of the oven. Try it and see if you like it better.

I prepared this recipe 3 hours ahead of time with corn tortillas. I think the corn tortillas should be used for immediate baking, and flour if its going to sit for a bit. As other reviews, and to also tie in a family recipe, I mixed the cream cheese in with everything. Even with the cream cheese scaled back to 4oz and only 8oz Sour cream it's a little bland. The chicken I boiled in chicken broth with a packet of fajita seasoning added. Next time i'll use my corn mexi dip as a filler with the chicken. For sauce I used homemade red enchilada sauce for the top, and coated the bottom with some queso cheese sauce. This has potential....

Wish I had read the reviews to cut back the sour cream before I made the recipe. It was just too much with the cream cheese. I made 1/2 the enchiladas with salsa verde instead of picante salse, and liked it very well.

we loved these enchiladas. they're so different from a standard recipe. i thought the "sauce" could use a little something extra, so i added about 1/4c of whipping cream to the salsa (because there just wasn't enough fat in the recipe to begin with - ha ha). i made these for a party and they were a hit with everyone.

i don't know about three+ forks for this recipe. it was good, very good. not great. but it is enchiladas so for them it was really good. I think I would only give it 2 and a half forks but my husband and our guests raved about them and want them again. i made with other users suggestions, used a mexican premix cheese, bought a rotisserie premade chicken and shredded- used extra chicken to get less creamy consistency for filling, used less sour cream- start with a 1/2 cup and add more if needed after all ingredients are mixed. i bought a premade enchilada sauce and mixed it with a chipolte salsa - put some on bottom of pan instead of greasing it. used corn tortillas (flour does get soggy) i personally liked the cream cheese, i spread on tortillas before rolling. i also used low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream - no difference in taste or consistency. they were fast and easy and seemed to be a winner here. served with lettuce, sour cream, salsa and guac. and a side of mexican rice. i think a better enchilada sauce would make it even tastier.

I make this recipe whenever I need something easy and delicious to feed a crowd. It is easy to multiply, and satisfies many tastes. Leave out the chicken for a tasty vegetarian version. I use low-fat cream cheese and sour cream, and it does not affect the texture or taste. To enhance the flavor of the topping, I mix a small can of enchilada sauce with the picante. Whenever I make this, someone asks for the recipe.

This is a good recipe...but make sure to use high quality salsa and tortillas. I didn't have time to buy fresh flour tortillas and settled for store bought. They got kinda crispy on the bottom. The salsa I bought on accident was "Hot" instead of "Medium". I regretted the heat from the salsa. Very rich enchiladas. I will make them again with fresh tortillas and milder salsa.

Rating: 4
Like others, I modified this a bit. Used ~3 cups chicken and only a big dollop of sour cream. Added some chopped chipotles in adobo and a little salsa, and used enchilada sauce. This made 12 6-inch corn enchiladas. Used about 1/2 package of cream cheese. REALLY good. I think the cream cheese totally made it. My new favorite way to make enchiladas!

I thought it was yummy, however, my family didn't care for it due to the cream cheese. I have made chicken/spinach enchilada's with cream cheese and they rocked. I think spreading some cream cheese on the tortilla's instead of putting 1/8 slice may help.

Check out Emeri'ls recipe like all the others recommended. Also, I dipped the tortillas in hot corn oil, drained them well on paper towels and then coated each side with enchilada sauce before I filled them to soften them. Great recipe indead!

I really like this recipe for the make-ahead factor. Changed the recipe only slightly by adding black beans and a few tsp of Fajita or Taco seasoning to the stuffing mixture. As others suggested I omitted the cream cheese. Haven't tried it with corn tortillas yet but will the next time. Served it with Spanish Rice and Refried Beans.

Not an elegant or refined meal, but really good for a family or when you need to cook for another family.

After reading all the reviews and suggestions, I decided to try it by mixing and matching other people's suggestions as well as my own ideas. I sauteed a chopped yellow onion and garlic with the cumin. I cut back on sour cream to 8-oz and substituted ~2/3 6.5-oz pkg cilantro lime jalepeno spread cheese for cream cheese. I inadvertently purchased a 3-oz can of green chiles instead of 7-oz, so I used that. I substituted fajita seasoned chicken strips and increased to 3 cups (about 1 1/2 pkgs). I also substituted 4-cheese mexican blend and increased total to about 2 2/3 cups (2 cups in chicken mixture). I opted for corn tortillas, but could only find 6 inch ones, so I ended up layering to make an enchilada pie. I started with some enchilada sauce, then made an overlapping layer of 6 tortillas. Next was half the chicken mixture, a little enchilada sauce. Then repeat with remaining tortillas, chicken mixture, and remaining sauce (I only used about 20 oz sauce). I followed remaining directions as is. Yummy! I would definitely make this again.

Can't tell you how much we love these. The only changes I make are to replace the salsa with a can of Hatch's mild enchilada sauce (half under the enchiladas and the rest poured over the top) and to omit the cream cheese, which makes them to mushy in my opinion. I don't do a lot of repeat-meals and love to try new things, but this one I go back to over and over again for a reliable family meal. Not gourmet but would give it 3 1/2 forks if I could, simply because it's the perfect combo of delicious and easy crowd pleaser. Serve it with a tomato, avacado, cuke and thinly sliced red onion salad.

Love this dish -- have been making it for maybe five years now. We do it with the following changes -- use corn tortillas, substitute Monterey Jack for Cheddar cheese, omit cream cheese, and instead of using picante sauce, use the recipe for Simmered Tomatillo-Serrano Sauce from "Rick Bayless' Mexican Kitchen". If you can find diced nopales (cactus) in your grocery store, saute them and add them to the filling -- it adds a lemony flavor that is quite nice.

These were awful! I can't believe the majority of the people posted on this website would make them again.

I made these enchiladas and received great reviews. Don't know what the big deal is with using flour tortillas - I thought they were great! Some changes: I poured a little enchilada sauce down on the baking dish before laying down the enchiladas. I omitted the cream cheese and used jarred jalepenos instead of green chilies. I also used a Mexian blend of cheese instead of cheddar. This will definitely be my standard enchilada recipe - the cilantro really makes it delicious!

REALLY, TAKE MY ADVICE....Follow the other review suggestions to use CORN tortillas, not FLOUR. I didn't and they do come out with a weird consistency, too mushy---would have been much better with a firmer tortilla. The flavor was very good and they were easy. I did follow other reviewers suggestion to use much less cream cheese (I used very little on the tortilla) and to use enchilada sauce on top instead of salsa or picante sauce. I would definately make these again because they were tasty and easy----but NOT with flour tortillas!!!!

This was a tasty dish and is very good served with a side of lettuce and spanish rice. I will make it again but probably with some modifications. I don't think the cream cheese was necessary and I will probably cut back on the sour cream as the "glop" factor was a little much for me. This was the first time I made enchiladas and I found this to be a good basic recipe that gave me confidence to add my own flair next time. IE I may try enchilada sauce or corn tortillas or shredded chicken, etc.

Normally I agree with the majority on these recipes.... on this one, I have go with the minority, and against what I actually anticipated. This is one of the weirdest recipes I've ever made. The ingredients are all relatively authentic. I initially was looking for a chicken and cheese enchilada recipe with sour cream sauce. This encompassed all those ingredients, and because of the rave reviews, I was encouraged to make it. However, it came out as this sour cream, non-cheesy, soggy flop of an enchilada casserole type thing. Ugh!! I searched for corn tortillas, but because I live in Pittsburgh, I was forced to buy flour. They absorbed the liquid in this recipe and ended up being a quarter inch thick. I love leftovers, and this became more sickening each day. The end result of this recipe is dependent upon the quality of the canned enchilada sauce you use. The very fact that the sauce isn't homemade detracts from the recipe. However, the un-authenticity seals the deal on it's unappetizing-ness (is that a word?). I found that ultimately that you might as well as put all ingredients in a dish and mush it around and bake it. It simply didn't shine as a dish, as a meal, or as leftovers. In a word, yukky.

I had both flour & corn so I decided to end the tortilla debate for myself. Flour wasn't bad, but like someone else said, the texture of the flour w/ cream cheese was a little weird. I prefer corn - it's definitely more authentic. However... I made them ahead & the corn tortillas, which are more "fragile", came apart, as in ripped open, in the fridge. So I wouldn't recommend doing ahead w/ corn (and use the big ones). I also used enchilada sauce instead of salsa; & added some sliced jar jalapenos to the chicken mix - they definitely needed the extra sass. I thought they were pretty good, very easy, & I'd make em again, but they weren't just to die for.

I served this at a family event and everyone thought it was the best chicken enchiladas they had ever eaten.

I liked it - my dining companion loved it, The cream cheese added nice creaminess as sour cream disappears during baking. I, too, made substitutions (I usually do unless another reviewer warns against it!): enchilada and mole sauce instead of picante on top.

Forget the cream cheese.. its completely unecessary! I bought a pre cooked BBQ chicken from the store-- saves alot of fuss. I also added alot more red onion and bell peppers-- it is tastier.

This is the best chicken enchilada recipe I've ever found--I've made it several times and received raves. It does need a bit of tweaking though. It is overly creamy, so I reduce the sour cream and cream cheese amounts (I use half to three quarters of what is called for) and mix the cream cheese in with the other filling ingredients. I also prefer to use purchased enchilada sauce rather than picante sauce - picante gets watery when baked, and the enchilada sauce has great flavor. I will have to follow the other suggestions and add corn/black beans, etc. Wonderful!

I used this recipe as a base and took other suggestions that I saw here. It was fantastic! I created an enchilada sauce with cream of chicken soup, chicken broth, light sour cream and chopped green chilies and jalapenos. Then for the chicken mixture, I used shredded chicken, shredded monterey jack cheese, more of the same chile mixture and light sour cream. I spread light cream cheese on flour tortillas and put in the chicken mixture and then dabbed more cream cheese on top before rolling up. Once they were placed in the dish I poured sauce mixture over and added more monterey jack cheese, and cooked covered for 45 mins. Then I removed cover and added a colby/monterey jack mixture of shredded cheese on top for another 5 minutes until melted. Delish!

I've been making this, with a few changes, since it first appeared in the magazine years ago. After reading through all of the reviews associated with this recipe recently, I felt the need to contribute to the dialog. This dish is truly amazing -- good enough that my brother hopped on a plane to have me make them for his birthday. With just a few changes you'll have something truly remarkable come out of your oven. So here goes... I sauteed a diced yellow onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic in some olive oil, tossed it into my mixing bowl and then I use 4 oz. of the cream cheese, cubed, which I add next so that the onion/garlic mixture can help soften it a bit. Then, 8 oz. of sour cream, the green chilies, green onions, 1/3 cup of the cilantro, and a tablespoon of cumin. 3 cups of chicken, 2 cups of cheese [I used the 4 cheese mexican blend that you can find already grated, and asadero -- half and half]. Mix thoroughly. Used a 28 oz. can of green enchilada sauce; poured 1/2 cup in bottom of pan [15x10]; used 12 flour tortillas - 2 rows of 6, poured the rest of the enchilada sauce over the enchiladas, and 5 minutes before completion, sprinkled another 1 1/2 cups grated cheese over the top with a couple of tablespoons of finely chopped cilantro. No additional sour cream on top. They hold their shape beautifully, and reheat nicely. Give it a try -- you won't be sorry.

Best enchiladas ever! I made a few changes that really helped to make them taste perfect. I used diced jalepenos instead of the green chilies and used pepper jack instead of cheddar. I spread the cream cheese over the tortilla... (that way you don't get a big chunk when you take a bite.) I also made my own enchilada sauce made up of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup cream cheese to pour over it. It was great!

As a low-fat and healthy option, replace the cream cheese with avocado slices. It adds the perfect amount of creaminess to the recipe without the fat.

Originally from Texas, I tweaked a couple of things here but the basic framework of the recipe works excellent. First, I used an enchilada sauce packet -- I lined the glass pan with this sauce before placing the enchiladas in the pan. I also used a nice Emmental cheese instead of cheddar and a garlic-flavored cream cheese -- both worked great. Cheddar is not exactly the best for Tex Mex. I also added jalapeno slices (4 down the center) to each to give them a nice kick.

This is one of those hilarious pages with lots of bickering throughout the reviews -- scroll down if you like to read those! Honestly, people need to lighten up. We thought this recipe was excellent, but I did make a few key modifications. I used enchilada sauce and corn tortillas, and I heated each tortilla in a dry skillet and then dipped in enchilada sauce before filling. Since I did that, I blended the cream cheese into the filling -- and I did cut it by half. I also cut the sour cream to 1 cup, increased the chicken to a generous 3 cups of shredded meat (bought a roasted chicken at Safeway) and added some diced pickled jalepenos. Using small (6 in?) corn tortillas and a good scoop of filling in each, this made 10 enchiladas, which fit perfectly in my 9x13 pan (8 side by side and two end to end lengthwise). I put a little enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan first, then poured the rest (after dipping) over the enchiladas (I used one 28 oz can). I baked them uncovered for 40 minutes, then added the cheese and baked 5 minutes more. They didn't come out of the pan cleanly, but who cares? They tasted great and we will make these regularly.

Great recipe. I followed many previous reaer tips that may inspire you too. I love corn and black beans, so I add this to the filling mix. I used corn tortillas, think it gives more robust flavor. Also, I stacked my tortillas in a 9 X 13. I just kept layering tortillas and filling. I took knife and spread softened cream cheese on tortillas before stacking. I think easier than rolling, especially if using corn tortialls which are more brittle. Really good. My husband said probably best enchilada recipe I've made, and I've made many. Another quick tip -- don't want to cook a chicken, buy a rotisserie from the grocery store. I like using dark and white moeat -- again more flavor.

Very Good! I always get rave reviews when I make these. I use ground beef seasoned with taco seasoning instead of chicken and cover with enchilada sauce instead of salsa. Awesome!

Faublous recipe because it: tastes great and allows room for additions or deletions. I made a casserole instead of enchiladas (my "enchilada lasagna"). I skipped the cream cheese and used Queso Fresco only.

The filling was very gooey so I ended up not even using the cream cheese. Would be better with more chicken added, maybe some rice, beans, and/or veggies. Also prefer corn tortillas.

Relax, Salt Lake. Let's not get into a Mexican/Spanish "authenticity" debate, like we get into with certain Italian recipes. Besides, flour tortillas are easier to work with than corn. Make it, eat it, call it what you like. Or don't.

In a word: blech. This looked like a great recipe, and it was fun to make. However it was awful. The cilantro was overpowering and no other flavor survived. Drat.

I made a couple of alterations: 3 cups shredded chicken (not cubed), a mixture of cheddar & monterey jack cheese, and 2X more than called for. The only other change I would make next time is to use less cream cheese or maybe mix it into the filling instead of topping with it - it was just a bit too much for our taste. Otherwise, we thought this was tasty.

To the cook from Arlington, try the recipe on this site for the Great After-Thanksgiving Turkey Enchiladas. I've actually never had it with turkey, but rather chicken (I don't have enough turkey left over after Thanksgiving!) They are truly great, although I don't fry my tortilla shells as the recipe says, and I use low-fat sour cream. They do not taste low-fat this way, I just try to cut down where I can. Also, since I've never made them any other way, nobody knows the difference!

This reminds me of the "King Ranch" chicken casserole recipes so popular in the 70's and 80's. It was okay, but I prefer corn tortillas and the sauce made with green chile and tomatillos. The cheese should be asadero or jack.

Rating: 2
Anything made with these ingredients would be good but I have better enchilada recipes. My neighbor taught me to always boil the chicken for enchiladas and then shred and not chop the chicken. I agree with her that the shredded chicken is much better in this type of dish. I was skeptical on the boiling but it makes for wonderful chicken meat. I could eat food like this everynight. Very comforting.

Loved this recipe...fast,easy and great way to use up left over chicken. I increased cumin to 2 tsp and substituted pickled jalapeno peppers for chiles for extra kick!I mixed all ingredients together,put into tortilla,rolled then put salsa and shredded cheddar on top and baked...YUM!!!

I had to adapt the recipe for children who can't eat cow cheese or spicey food, so I used goat cheese- cheddar, and a mild soft spread-- and left out the chiles. I also cooked the chicken with a couple cloves of garlic for some more flavor. My family really loved it, and want it added to our regular dishes.

I thought this dish was lacking something. The filling was just too cheesy and bland. I felt like it was just a mouthful of sour cream and cheese. I added black beans and that helped. I think next time I would add a bunch more things - more chicken, rice, squash, tomatos, more spices. As shows, it is just kind of a blah recipe. Although everyone else seemed to love it, so who knows!

I used smoked chicken and whole wheat tortillas, fat free cream cheese and low fat sour cream. It was really flavorful. Also substituted all Monterey Jack cheese. My family loved it and I'll make it again. I sliced some black olives over the top of the melted cheese and it made a better presentation.

Followed this recipe as shown, with no cilantro however. My husband doesn't like it. I made this for guests last night and everyone LOVED it. The flavor was so terrific! The smell was awesome!

I didn't rate this cause I haven't tried it. I did read the reviews, and have decided to stick with a recipe I got off Emeril.com called "Jessie's Chicken Enchiladas. I don't like using store bought sauces, and this is so easy to make, and it has a flavor better than the best Mexican restaurants. I poach some c hicken breasts and shred. This recipe is out of this world.made with flour tortillas. With the ingredients in this recipe, the flour tortillas give the dish a creamy texture. I am curious to know how people like this one!

This tasted fantastic. I just ate the left overs for lunch today (for the second time. My seven year old daughter said these were the most delicious thing she has ever tasted!

I had this recipe written down in my recipe box and just made it for the first time as is without reading all the reviews. I thought it was absolutely fantastic, except I did end up cooking more chicken and adding it in. The sauce is delicious! Love the combination of the green chilis, sour cream and cream cheese. I did notice the cheddar seemed to completely diappear: will try Monterey Jack next time. I added in a half cup of black beans to each tortilla and this worked wonderfully. This recipe has officially become one of my staples! Loved it!

I did make some changes to the original recipe. Since I was using some left over corn tortillas (use corn for a more Tex-Mex flavor) bought earlier that week, they weren't so pliable & kept breaking when I rolled them up. So I mixed the cream cheese & some salsa w/the shredded chicken mixture & added some hotter chilies. I agree, w/a review from Dallas (originally from Houston myself) use Monterey Jack & corn tortillas. The tortillas I tore up like chip size & just added it all together in layers. Also added a little of the chicken broth that was made when I cooked the chicken, to give it a little moisture as it seemed a little dry. Turned out fine. Recipe is a keeper.

Excellent recipe, with some adjustments: corn, rather than flour, tortillas (any conisseur of Tex-Mex fare knows that enchiladas are made with corn tortillas!); less sour cream and more chicken; Monterey jack or pepper jack rather than cheddar (Jack complements chicken much better than cheddar does). Also, I stacked the tortillas rather than roll them to save time without compromising the flavor or the spirit of the dish. Served it to 24 guests for a holiday dinner, and it was a huge hit with everyone.

This was a wonderful dish! Would make it again without a doubt. I followed some of the suggestions given by other people: half the cream cheese, doubled the chicken & used red enchilada sauce. Turned out wonderful and my family loved them. Will use this recipe going forward and throw out my other enchilada recipes!

I took the advice of others and used less sour cream & cream cheese & more chicken. It was still pretty rich but my friends loved it. I used corn tortillas that I think were only 6 inches. I used the Emeril Enchilada sauce that another recipe on this site recommends, if you can't find it here go to food TV site. This worked out well. Had some leftover so froze 'em, we'll see how that turns out. Had only 4 oz can of chile's but recommend using the 7 ounces called for here. Summary = yummy!

After reading all the reviews, I made this with shredded poached chicken (added cilantro to the poaching liquid. I used extra chicken and 4oz more canned chilies. I cut the cream cheese into the filling. For the topping, I mixed medium chunky salsa with Sour Cream before topping with grated extra old cheddar and monterey jack. My husband enjoyed it but I wasn't thrilled, but I'd made so much there were leftovers. THEY WERE WONDERFUL! Although my 7 and 8 year old boys didn't care for it, I will definitely make this again as a "make ahead" dish to allow the flavours to meld. Thank you to all the reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I did make several modifications, based on previous reviews: used about 2/3 amount of cream cheese and 1/2 the amount of sour cream, increased the chicken to about 3 cups, used corn tortillas instead of flour and enchilada sauce instead of picante. I also added 1/2 jalapeno pepper. But, even with these changes, it was not great. Still too much cream cheese taste for me and not enough chicken. My husband thought the sauce overpowered the other ingredients, so maybe picante sauce would have been better, but it seems one would be better off looking for a recipe that tastes great without changing eveything. It's edible, just not outstanding.

To make this recipe spectacular, I use canned enchilada sauce (readily available in hot/med/or mild); salsa doesn't work. I also use regular sour cream & cream cheese, no light anything. I separate into 2 batches & freeze one, because it's a heavy dish. I also add chopped jalapenos. The original recipe is much too bland.

Thought this was "OK". I tested it before making it for a group of friends, and think it needs modifications. 1. The mixture only made enough 1/2 cups of filling for 7 enchiladas, not 8. would add more chicken. 2. Thought it was way too cheesy. Would double the chicken, and keep the same amount of the other ingredients, and use 1/2 of the cream cheese. 3. think that Cheddar is odd for mexican dishes. would use monteray jack. 4. my tortillas were really soggy. would strain some of the liquid out of the picante sauce before adding. All in all, good flavors for a week night, but not a wow recipe. Postive note, they re-heated for leftovers pretty well.

This has become one of my husband's favorite meals. I buy a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store and pick it while it's still warm. I also use less sour cream, and spread a THIN layer of spreadable cream cheese on top of rolled tortillas before adding enchilada sauce, and bake uncovered. Once the chicken is picked, this is a fast and easy weeknight meal. Friends have raved and asked for the recipe.

These enchiladas were simple and fast. Also, good for those who don't like a lot of spice. I made it with leftover turkey and it worked well. But, IMO, Chicken and Green Olive Enchiladas (recipe on Epicurious) is much better, although more time consuming. THEY are delicious!

Whoa! Let's get some perspective here, folks. I tried this tonight, and feel OBLIGATED to review it before others are similarly misled by the glowing reviews. This recipe produces a grossly HEAVY, cream cheese LADEN, chicken salad-like filling, rolled in white tortillas and covered with store-bought salsa. Ugh! 4 forks?!!? You gotta be kidding! If you are seeking an enchilada with some (any) southwestern / Mexican flavor or authenticity, look elsewhere! I am honestly perplexed by the positive reviews. This could potentially be palatable in very small quantities as an hors d'ouvre (similar to other cream cheese roll creations), but as "enchiladas" these are badly miscast.

I made this recipe for bunch of friends and everyone loved it! I used canned enchilada sauce instead of the salsa, but mostly dip the tortillas in before wrapping. Then I only spooned a little on top of the enchiladas for baking. I also forgot to cover, and I think it made it better - less goopy/soggy. I used 1/2 diced jalapenos and 1/2 diced green chiles - gave it a little more kick. I'd definitely recommend it, with the modifications I made!

I found this by looking for cream cheese recipes.Funny thing, I forgot to put it in the rollup, so I just smeared a few dabs on the top of the tortilla. It is my favorite enchilada recipe now. (I don't like the taste of enchilada sauce) It is as rich as it sounds. We were Very Impressed with the outcome. I only had a 4oz can of green chiles so I added a good 4ozs of roasted peppers in the jar. It added a little smokey flavor. I added most of a can of sliced black olives, the rest I saved for the top with some more chopped onions. I ad-libbed with the salsa also. It was fine with a combo of salsa, tomato sauce, and roasted peppers.Although, I did open a can of red chili sauce, I didn't like the "strongness" of it. I wanted a more subtle flavor. I Didn't use it. Flour tortillas are a little gummy, but they were good for not taking away the flavor of the filling. I will use corn too. All in all, it was 'pretty' as well as very tasty. I can't wait to make a large batch for a pot luck! I know it will be a hit!

This is a pretty good base recipe. I did alter a few things, and would change one more when making it again--substituing enchilada sauce for the picante. As it stands, the picante sauce isn't quite liquid enough, and far too spicy in contrast to the milder chicken and hearty cilantro flavors. What I changed at the get-go: Browned white onions, added green bell peppers (in place of chilis) to skillet, then added cilantro and green onions. Added the chicken breasts, so they all cooked together, and added a dash of sherry (although tequila would probably work, too). Once the chicken was browned, I diced it and added it all together to fatfree sour cream mixture. . . yummy!

Yum! This is now a staple, and a great way to use leftover roast chicken! I've become lazy and cube the chicken instead of tearing (much faster), and have made a few adjustments for less fat and a more delicate taste: corn tortillas instead of flour; omit the cream cheese; fat-free sour cream, monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar, green tomatillo sauce instead of salsa. I roasted, peeled and chopped a couple of jalapeo peppers for kick. Also, I microwave each tortilla for 10-12 seconds to make them soft and easy to roll up. Wonderful!

I would have given it three forks, but my husband just raved about this dish! I used garlic and lime salsa (by Pace I think) and it was spicy and terrific. I don't like food dripping in creamy sauces, so I only used about half of the sour cream and barely any cream cheese, so I think I'll just cut that out next time or use a little con queso in its place. I also tried to make this a lighter dish by using light everything - sour cream, cream cheese and no-fat cheese. Worked great. A tip though: let the dish stand for a few minutes when you take it out of the oven. Our tortillas were ripping when we dished them out of the pan.

We served these for a Mexican fiesta party we had. Everyone enjoyed it very much and I've already been asked for the recipe.

They were even good the next day as leftovers. Recommend highly!

I substituted monterey jack for the cheddar cheese, velveeta for the cream cheese and mixed some salsa with a small can of enchilada sauce.

Great week-night fare. I made my own "winter salsa" with whole canned tomatoes, cilantro, cumin, garlic, fresh chilis and onion to use in place of the picante and it was really good!

My favorite enchilada recipe! I make this dish all the time, served with refried black beans and a chile relleno casserole, for dinner parties. I changed the sauce by using a can of enchilada sauce combined with a can of crm of mushroom soup, pour over top and sprinkle cheddar/jack cheese over. I like the crm cheese, but you can definitely omit w/out losing taste. Delicious!

These were delicious!!! I made some modifications as suggested and would recommend the same. I used only one cup of reduced fat sour cream. I used pre-cooked Perdue chicken, which made the preparation so fast. I had no chilies or onions and my kids hate cilantro-so I made it without. I "buttered" each corn tortilla with the cream cheese and then added the filling. I also used one jar of enchilada sauce and one jar of salsa. When cooked, I added extra cheese on top-both jack and cheddar. Sooooo Good- I can't wait for leftovers.

With a few modifications, this has become one of our favorite dishes! I "butter" the tortillas (corn for me, flour for my husband) with light cream cheese. I use pepper Jack cheese and add 2 or 3 chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to the chicken mixture. Sometimes I add sliced black olives as well. Instead of picante, I use green enchilada sauce mixed with tomatillo salsa (Salsa Herdez is great!). My husband always comes home early when these are on the menu!

I used half the amount of cream cheese and less of the sour cream as well. I also grated some fresh monterey jack cheese over the top and it was delicious!

Perfect, easy, and fun. I will absolutely make this dish again!

I wasn't too excited about the "slices" of creme cheese, so I made a change that also expanded the recipe to serve 12 enchiladas. My alterations: Instead of the cup of cheddar in the mix or the "slices" of creme cheese, I mixed a can of cheddar cheese soup w/8 oz creme cheese with my mixer--then I added that to the rest of the filling. I probably added an extra 3/4 cup to 1 cup of turkey to the mixture and ended up w/ 12 enchiladas instead of 8. I then sprinkled grated cheese on the top of the enchiladas and finished off w/salsa. I used about 3 cups of salsa (home made mixed w/Mexican style tomatoes) to put on top. As you can see, I'm not very good at following recipes! Lona

Very good enchilada recipe. I only used 1/2 of the cream cheese amount in each enchilada, and used only 3/4 of the sour cream. They were plenty rich and creamy with the reduced amounts! I paired this up with the mexican cornbread pudding recipe and they made a great duo, but amount to a TON of food! Very yummy dish!

Very good and loved by my in-laws. Easy enough for inexperienced cooks, given they can follow directions. I was out of flour tortillas, so we used corn and just softened in hot oil before use.

I lost this recipe and have been searching for it for 2 years! It is the only enchilada recipe I have ever liked. Unlike the fat-conscious cooks, I went for full-up regular sour cream and cream cheese and loved it. So happy to have this one back in my recipe file!

I have found that a "SaladShooter" works very well when you have to shred large amounts of cheese. It takes all the work out of it!!! One of my BEST kitchen secrets!

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe. The best enchiladas I've ever had...with the following modifications: Lose the cream cheese, use a combination of low fat and fat free sour cream and cut down on the overall amount, use the Kraft Classic Melts cheese blend, and add some sauteed red peppers and onion to the filling. Also, if you're not a fan of cilantro, feel free to leave it out. Restaurant-worthy.

I've made this dish twice, and it turned out excellent both times! I used medium salsa instead of picante sauce, and also extra cheese. Yummy!

Rating: 4
Very good recipe. As we are trying to cut down on some fat, we elimated the cream cheese & cut the(light)sour cream to a 1/4 cup. Used monterey jack in the filling then used cheddar (lightly) at the last over the top. Used canned Las Palmas enchilada sauce, best thing to homemade rather than salsa.

Rating: 3
This was definitely a success for me; easy, not too time consuming and great flavor. I used as many non-fat options as possible, and it still tasted great. Next time I may try a different sauce on top (e.g. mild green taco sauce), and possibly some jalapeno jack cheese in lieu of a portion of the chedder.

Rating: 4
I think this is one of the most fabulous enchilada recipes I've tried (i've tried alot!!) I agree that the cream cheese withh sour cream can be a bit much. I halved the sour cream and kept the 8oz. cream cheese. The texture is supurb! Make your own enchilada sauce!!! I used tomatillo. Will repeat this many times with variations, Beans???

Rating: 4
One word: scrumptious! Absolutely the best enchiladas I've ever had and I lived in Arizona for 7 years. There is so much room for cooking these to your own preferences which makes them even better. I omitted the cream cheese strip which was a good idea I thought. I did use dried cilantro though and that was NOT a good idea. Use fresh cilantro for sure. And I added garlic powder and a little paprika in the chicken mix. Add a tablespoon of semi- sweet chocolate to the enchilada sauce (rather than the salsa) for an excellent flavour. Complements to the Chef!

Rich chicken breast strips, and *sparingly* used the cream cheese (but they still came out extremely RICH). I also used a 28-oz can of mild enchilada sauce -- 2/3 of it in the baking dish, and the rest spooned over the enchiladas as they were served. Next time, no cream cheese!

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe. I've made it twice for two different groups of people and it is always praised. This last time I had guests coming back for seconds and thirds. When I made the enchiladas this time, I used just a little sliver of cream cheese. I also made one batch with the salsa and one batch using cream of mushroom soup with fresh cilantro added to it and poured over the top. Everyone loved both.

Rating: 3
These were delicious and easy. I used a 20oz can of mild enchilada sauce instead of the salsa. I did us the cream cheese but only half as much. I cooked the chicken breast the night before, and assembled these over a cookie sheet to reduce the mess. These were wonderful and easy...A keeper!

I thought these were great! I'd give it 4 stars as far as chicken enchiladas go, but they are only chicken enchiladas. Thanks to the other reviewers I made the following changes: used ricotta instead of cream cheese, 20 oz enchilada sauce, 2 green onions, marinaded chicken in lime and garlic, 3 oz canned chiles. Will definitely make again!

A hit with my family, (husband & 3 teens). I happened to have some Ricotta on hand and after reading readers reviews decided to try it. A wonderful and lighter touch. I fried my corn tortillas and dipped into some canned medium enchilada sauce before filling and rolling.Will make this again!

I had a dinner party and these were a hit. They are easy and feed a lot of people. I marinated the chicken in fresh lime juice and cilantro..Both men and women loved them. I made sure they were low-fat by using fat-free cream cheese and low-fat sour cream..I also put just a touch of cream cheese in each enchilada.yummy with spanish rice too.

Tasty, and our teenage son liked it, too. The main difference I made was substituting browned ground beef with onions and garlic in half of the enchiladas, chicken in the other half. Both were very good. I used a mixture of enchilada sauce and salsa over the top. We liked the heat the enchilada sauce added. Based on other readers' comments, I used ricotta in some, a little low fat cream cheese in others. We liked both. The secret is probably to use a light touch with either.

Rating: 3
My family and I really like this recipe, although I must admit that I have altered it a bit. It's a great starter recipe. I prefer to mix 8 oz. of ricotta cheese in the filling instead of the cream cheese. I also added some chili powder and cooked the chicken with some garlic and lime juice. I use a Mexican blend of shredded cheeses in place of the cheddar. Also, I just use one 16 oz. jar of medium picante sauce. My family calls it Mexican lasagne.

The filling was fine, but the sauce....NO way. Try this adaptation next time: For the chicken FILLING, make as directed but use only 1 C. sour cream (lite is fine) and add 1/2 can mushroom soup. For the SAUCE, use another 1 C. lite sour cream (using up a 16 oz. container), 1 small can green chilis-undrained, and 1/2 can mushroom soup. Tastes more like restaurant style "Enchiladas Suiza" and much less fattening.

I make this dish for my hot lunch menu quite often. The bosses husband constantly asks "are the enchiladas on the menu this week?" They are very versatile I have made them with and without the cream cheese, with dark meat, with white meat, and with a combination.

This has more or less been my standard recipe for over ten years! You should make the following adjustments: cut drastically or omit the cream cheese altogether, and use 2 cans enchilada sauce instead of picante. I also use chopped fresh chiles instead of canned.

The cream cheese was a bit too much. I left it out the second time I made this. Also tried a 'white' sauce 1/4 c. butter, 1/4 c. flour, 1 c. chicken broth (boil togethor) add 1 c. sour cream and your favorite hot ingredient (sliced jalapenos in my case), pour over enchiladas and bake as usual. A bit of monterey jack cheese is good on top too.

This recipe was tasty but my husband and I found that we did not like the Cream Cheese in this recipe. It was unecessary since it already had sour cream. I would make it again but without the heavy thick tasting cream cheese.

The filling was wonderful -- cream cheese and all...However, I used a sliver of cream cheese instead of 1/8 package per enchilada. I think that might have been a bit heavy. The "big" thing I wish I'd done differently was to use enchilada sauce instead of picante sauce. The picante sauce separated, letting the water all go to the bottom of the dish. When the enchiladas came out of the oven, the bottoms were horribly soggy and inedible. I thought twice about it at the grocery and if I'd used the enchilada sauce, they would have been wonderful. My hubby loved it anyway...

I guess I am in the minority on this one, but I made this for my family and not one of us like it at all! Two problems: the taste of the canned chiles was overpowering, and the cream cheese was an addition that really didn't go well with the other flavors. It also made the dish too rich and heavy. MAYBE I would try it again, using fresh chiles, as someone else already suggested, and omitting the cream cheese. But considering that this cost me nearly $20.00 to make, (chicken, canned chiles, 2 jars picante sauce, cheddar cheese, pint of sour cream, 1/2 lb cream cheese), I can say I probably won't be making this again.

For some reason this dish just didn't hit the spot with me. Even though I used low fat sour cream and low fat cream cheese, it was richer than I like my enchiladas to be.

Delicious as long as you can live with yourself in the morning. Rich and flavorful. Would probably add more salsa next time so the edges (and part of the tops) don't get dry.

Flavorful, easy, and a twist on the typical chicken enchilada recipe. I used non-fat sour cream and reduced fat cheddar and would have used non-fat cream cheese but had light in the frig. I also doubled the green onions and chicken, used additional cilantro, and used medium picante vs mild.
