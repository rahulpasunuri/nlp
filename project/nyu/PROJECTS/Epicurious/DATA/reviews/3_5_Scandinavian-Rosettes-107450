In my experience, the main reason why the batter fails to stick to the iron is that the iron wasn't held in the hot oil enough to get so hot that the batter starts to cook when the iron touches it. Towards the end, I use a little desert dish with straight sides to hold the batter so it will still have enough depth. Also, the Joy of Cooking suggests chilling the batter in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. I'm not sure what the chilling does, but this allows any little bubbles to come to the surface so they won't produce anomalies when you dip the iron in.

I want to mail some rosettes to my family who live in other states. (My mom always made them.) How can I do this or should I forget trying? DottieH

Crispy, and good when dipped in granulated sugar.

I just finished making 5 dozen rosettes. Several "keys" to making them - keep the temp. near 400 degrees, your iron hot, and have a paper towel to tap the hot iron on to get even more excess oil off before dipping into the batter. It is difficult to use more then 75% of the batter - the reason, the batter gets hot from the excess oil and stops adhering to the iron. Our BC recipe is for half the batter - if using that one with 1/2 cup flour, double it - otherwise you will have lots of hot oil and not enough rosettes. Use a bowl that is fairly narrow because a wide one makes the batter spread out to much and you won't even get to the 75% mark. Now for your iron. Most come with two prongs - before starting, take a dremel or hack saw and cut one off, it just gets in your way and I can never imagine trying to make two at once. (to be honest, I tried and what a mess!!!) As for letting them fry without the iron, they spread out and aren't near as nice. To remove them, have a ""LONG"" handled fork to hold them against the iron, tip them over and get a bit more oil off. The key is patience!!!! Once you get the temp correct and a rythme going, 20 dozen is a piece of cake. If you plan to make more with the same oil, strain it to get the fall off pieces or they get black and stick to the underside of the ones you are making.

These will save longer if stored in a cardboard shoebox lined with tissue paper. An airtight container holds in the moisture and makes them less crisp. Dust lightly with confectioner's sugar when cool, then again just before serving. A Silpat is not necessary - paper towels will do.

I made this recipe last night. I have made Rosettes many times but it has been years. I always used a Betty Crocker recipe.Unlike other reviewers I have always dipped the HOT iron into the batter (up 3/4 up sides) then into 370-380 degree oil. They are not meant to fall off the iron into the oil. After 20-40 seconds (depending on oil temp) you lift the iron out and use a fork to gently ease them off the iron and onto paper towels to drain. The difference in ingredients from BC is the vanilla. I also added 1/4 tsp. of cardamon which I saw in another recipe.

These were very good. It's important to make sure the iron stays hot, or the batter will not adhere to it. Also, make sure both sides are nice and brown, or they won't be crispy. They really are best the day they are made.

I agree, the rosettes fall off the iron after a few seconds of cooking and you can move onto the next one. Although this only works if you don't batter the iron all the way up (the batter curls over the iron when cooked) or you'll have to pry them off with a fork.

I just made rosettes last night, with a different recipe that's pretty similar. I'm wondering about the use of the silpat listed on the special equipment list? My experience with making rosettes is that they don't stick to the iron at all, but cook right off the iron. Then they float rather than sink, so there is no risk of shattering on the bottom. Maybe if the batter really did stick to the iron it might shatter if you dropped the iron, but who would drop the iron in the hot oil anyway? I appreciate the details about how long to hold the iron in the batter, and not to overmix the batter, as my recipe didn't talk about this. I don't know everyone else's experiences making rosettes, but they are definitely a once-a-year treat, as getting everything exactly right is much more complex than the recipe indicates. Everyone goes crazy for these though, so if you want to get a star, go for it!
