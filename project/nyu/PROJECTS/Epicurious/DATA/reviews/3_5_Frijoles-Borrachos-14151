We really loved these beans! Like other reviewers, I used the whole bottle of dark beer. I also used 1 and a half cans of Rotel instead of salsa. A+!

Okay...pretty bland, didn't like the texture. Not recommended for the amount of work.

I needed these for a party same-day, so I skipped the first part of the recipe and bought two large cans of prepared pinto beans rinsed and drained. I sauteed the chopped onions with the bacon and added the epizote in with the beans and beer, etc. I got raves from everyone and requests for the recipe. I think these are destined to become a family favorite.

I don't even like beans but needed something to serve and these were recommended in the magazine overview with the camerones adobado. For some reason they are amazing - maybe it's the beer? Whatever it is, they are delish...

Great beans! Really easy to make. I didn't have epazote, so I left it out - no one was the wiser. I took another reviewer's advice and added a full bottle of dark beer. I'm making them again today as a matter of fact.

Rarely do I rate a recipe four forks, but this bean recipe was darn near perfect. I added one bottle of Negro Modelo dark beer and 3 large chopped, fresh jalapenos. I used 2 cups 4th Anniversary salsa from Central Market (which is made fresh daily) because I prefer it to most salsas. Also added chopped cilantro. All guests thoroughly enjoyed.

For a New Mexican to find a new and interesting way to cook beans is something. I really liked this recipe. The main change I made was adding a full bottle of good beer (something dark and full like a bock or ale) instead of a measly 1/2 cup. This recipe will definitely keep me growing epazote in my herb garden.

Delicious. Tasted like the beans I've eaten in restaurants. I think it need some chopped cilantro added at the very end, just before serving. Yum!
