My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. We didn't have fresh ginger so we substituted with 1/2 tsp dried ginger powder. We also had garlic scapes from our garden so we chopped on up finely in place of minced garlic--adds more color to the meat. We then just put the meat sticks in the freezer wrapped in tin foil and a secure plastic bag for 1/2 hr instead of 2 hrs in the fridge (didn't have time to wait). Cooked them on the outdoor grill at 250-300 degrees for about 7-10 min rotating the sticks a few times. Great with rice and Waldorf salad if one has extra apples. If you've ever eaten street food in South Korea you know there are lot of meats-on-sticks options. This recipe has an authentic flavor and texture found at those street food stands and it's fun to eat!

The recipe should read 2lbs of ground turkey, just to clarify. The flavors are very good, I didn't really like the texture, I think I would use oatmeal in place of the bread crumbs next time to give it more texture. Would definately make patties or meatballs out of it next time. Could bake/broil the meatballs in the oven. Kind of a putsy recipe, but I will make it again.

I made a couple of small adjustments. First I replaced the apple with crushed pine-apple, and then made them into small burgers that I paired with hawiian sweet rolls

My very finicky 6 year old liked it... and it's relatively healthy.

I really did not care for this recipe...at all.
