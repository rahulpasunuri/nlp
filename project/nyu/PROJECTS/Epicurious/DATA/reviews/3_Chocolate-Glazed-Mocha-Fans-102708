These were nice and chocolatey though the glaze stayed really soft at room temperature. We got chocolate all over our fingers while we devoured the cookies!

I've made these for the last three years and everyone loves them. They are very easy to make.

I thought these were OK. I don't think I'll be making them again.

For every dinner party, I include one chocolate dessert for my chocolate lover friends. They loved it, the 4-forks are because of their raves. I will use semisweet chocolate next time as I prefer the flavor. I recommended Chocolate-Glazed Mocha Fans to a friend for her Christmas Eve dinner party.

Dark chocolate lovers will find this just delightful. For people who prefer a lighter, milk chocolate flavor it will not appeal. It is tricky to work with, however. The shortbread is delicate, it must be cut when slightly cooled but still warm. Then cool completely before draping the ganache as the fans can break easily. Holding the wide end of the fan gently "paint" the ganache on the sides of the "point" and then artistically on the top. I then heat a piece of white chocolate in a plastic baggie, cut a snip off the corner and drizzle some stripes across the dark ganache for accent. Rich, unusual texture, lovely presentation.

I have made this recipe twice, and receive rave reviews both times. Several people asked me for the recipe. I will definitely make this again. These cookies are very rich but not too sweet. To make it easy, I use chocolate chips for the glaze.

Deep, dark, rich chocolate flavor. These are not for the faint of heart! The delicate texture of these shortbread-type cookies made for a melt-in-the mouth experience. They disappeared quickly from the cookie tin!

My husband who loves all things chocolate said that this recipe is definitely a keeper.
