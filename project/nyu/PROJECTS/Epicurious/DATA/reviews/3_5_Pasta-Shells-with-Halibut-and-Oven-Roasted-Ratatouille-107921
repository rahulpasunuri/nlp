IT would be nice if the author of this recipe had named the ingredients for herbs de provence. Ingredients: 1 tablespoon thyme, 1 tablespoon chervil, 1 tablespoon rosemary, 1 tablespoon summer savory, 1 teaspoon lavender, 1 teaspoon tarragon, 1 teaspoon marjoram, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, 1/2 teaspoon mint, 2 powdered or chopped bay leaves. A simpler bouquet can be made with a mixture of savory, rosemary, fennel, basil, thyme, and lavender. Lavender is an essential ingredient of herbes de provence, while thyme usually dominates the taste of the herb mixture.

I had really hoped to love this. I made it just as directed and found it pretty dull. Instead of ratatouille, it was a bowl full of over-roasted vegetables, with nothing holding them together. Next time I'll make Patricia Well's red pepper and eggplant sauce.

This was so delicious and a fav with my husband. Only complaint that the chopping made it take about 1.5 hrs start to finish. I used Ronzoni Healthy Harvest Rotini whole wheat pasta with Omega 3s, which tasted good. I also used pollock instead of halibut. So wonderful, melty and savory. Definitely make again.

This is a favorite. I use whole wheat penne or farfalle instead of shells. Goes really well with the ratatouille. And I don't mix everything together at the end. I serve the fish whole and the rest as side dishes. very easy and very flavorful.

This is one of my favorite recipes because it's reliable and really flavorful. Everyone, even kids, likes it. I actually skip the pasta and just serve it the Ratatouille with the fish. I dislike zucchini, so I usually add a yellow pepper and skip zucchini.

Don't forget to use this recipe idea with leftover ratatouille. Very good! Can top with fresh chopped herbs and/or toasted pine nuts. If you plump some currants and add them, you get a nice sweet addition, and I also added halved pitted calamata olives.

Made with cod. In my search for tasty low fat meals, this one is a new favorite. Can use less oil than is called for because tomatoes give off juice in the roasting process.

I only made the ratatouille part of this recipe and I thought it was so easy and really tasty. I added a little red onion slices. It's a quick and easy side dish, I roasted it for a lot longer than the given time, about 1 hour. It's great cold too!

Wonderful and easy dish. If you can't find the recommended herbs, a blend of Italian seasonings will do the trick.

This was a simple, tasty, healthy weeknight meal. It was flavorful, and I enjoyed the roasted ratatouille so much I may make it independently some time. Now I will admit I did not find the herbes de Provence (and I did swing by a specialty store here in San Francisco), so I improvised and used some oregano and ground fennel. I thought it was lovely regardless. Don't be put off.
