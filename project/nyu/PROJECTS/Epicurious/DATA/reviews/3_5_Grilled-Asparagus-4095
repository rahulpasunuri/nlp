Great for appetizers, especially as main course is grilling. After grilling, sprinkle some seasame seeds to enhance.

This is the only way my family will eat asparagus...wonderful! Sprinkle well with pepper (especially) and salt.

A very simple and delicious way to prepare asparagus. Use the top rack of your BBQ and watch carefully. I usually brush with a bit of melted butter to finish.

I agree, a good quality, fruity olive oil greatly improves the taste. After drizzling the olive oil on the asparagus I also add some chopped garlic before grilling. This is one of our favorite ways to eat asparagus!

This recipe can be inproved upon by using a fruity olive oil instead of the spray. Also, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice after grilling adds to the dish.
