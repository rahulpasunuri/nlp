I followed the recipe exactly except that I used high quality canned chicken. It was delicious. When I take my lunch to work I am going to put this salad in romaine leaves and wrap them up. (I really liked the currants.)

This salad was quick and easy to make and is delightfully refreshing. Perfect for summer! I used the juice of 1/2 of an orange, used dried cranberries instead of currants, used only a teaspoon of dried dill, and used leftover roasted chicken from a camping trip! I think I'll use more oj next time for more tang.

This dish didn't suit my palate at all. The combination of red wine vinegar and orange juice with couscous cooked in chicken broth just plain seemed like bad chemistry. It didn't taste bad but it didn't sit well with me. I won't make it again.

I liked this recipe. I didn't have enough oj from my orange for the exact amount. That might be whyit wasn't so overpowering. Dill scares me, a little of it goes a long way. This came out perfect.

This recipe was great! We are going through a heat wave now and I wanted a quick light recipe to use some left over smoked turkey. I didn't have any red wine vinegar and substituted sherry vinegar instead. I used a little less freshly squeezed Valencia orange juice than is called for, and used dry dill. I mixed this all up ahead of time and left it to chill for a few hours before dinner. Next time plan to try Israel couscous for fun.

We're having a heatwave in the South of France right now and this "cool" salad was just the right thing to serve to my guests. As couscous is a staple of the Mediterranean diet, I am quite familiar with it and prepared it a little differently than suggested, using cold chicken broth and in a 1:1 ratio. As I didn't have an dried currants, I too, substituted craisins (which I bring back from the States as they don't exist here...yet!) I also didn't have any fresh dill so I used it frozen and it came out just fine. All in all, a great dish I'd recommend.

Excellent summertime lunch! Light in flavor, low in fat (29% by my count) and very filling. The orange flavor is a bit strong but I liked it - my oranges weren't particularly sweet so it worked well. I substituted 2 ozs. canned tuna meat per person for the chicken, since I don't eat any meat, which worked amazingly (and surprisingly!) well, and added some minced fresh chili peppers for zing. Will definitely be making again, and frequently!

I loved this recipe. I've made it a few times now and I usually don't put in so much of the grated orange peel. I also used dried cranberries and it was wonderful.

I made this on a whim, and wasn't impressed the oj totally overpowered the dish and the salad tasted more like dessert, but next time I'll sub the oj and giv it another try!!!

My husband and I love this recipe. It's simple to make and refreshing, with a slight sweetness to it. I don't bother squeezing fresh orange juice, but use store bought instead. I also substitute dried cranberries for the dried currants and use whole wheat couscous to make it an even healthier dish. It's a great way to use up your leftover roast chicken.

I thought this was very good. I had to do a lot of substituting, as my main goals were to use leftover roasted chicken and not have to go the grocery store for ingredients! Couscous was tomato basil flavored and still worked well. Did not have currents or green onions. Use chopped shallots and dried apricots instead. Also, I added the dressing to the chicken, instead of vice versa. This way I could control the amount of the dressing, which was very intense w/the vinegar, but once added to dish, mellowed out and complimented everything very well. Also used dried dill. Very easy to assemble. Will make again for sure.

This is fabulous for a luncheon. I did however make some adjustments. I made the recipe X 3 and held back 1/3 cup of the red wine vinegar. I added about 4 tbsp honey. I also did not put all the sauce in the cous cous it seemed it would make it too loose. I used the rest to marniate the cooked chicken in before I added to cous cous. I used orange flavored dried cranberries instead of currants. Will certainly make a again

i found the orange taste totally overwhelming in this dish. The rest of it is fresh and delicious: dill, currents, etc. Might try replacing some of the OJ with vegetable broth or chicken broth to make it more savory than fruity.

We really love this recipe! It's perfect for a lite summer lunch. I used the large Isreali couscous, and added extra oj.

I just didn't like it. My husband thought it was ok, next time I'd use more chicken and less nivegar. But I don't think there will be a next time.

This salad is great. It's very light, has intriguing flavors and has a pretty presentation when served on a bed of red leaf lettuce. Next time I will add roasted pine nuts for crunch and nutty flavor.

Love this recipe! It's so simple and is a wonderfully light and tasty summer salad. I too used Crassins and wouldn't make it any other way.

I served this recipe to our Bunco club last Friday and got rave reviews. In doubling the recipe, I would add more chicken, currants (I used Craisins dried cranberries), and green onions, or alternatively cook less couscous. I found that the doubled recipe served about 12 as the principal dish in a buffet setting.

Wonderful and light. I used dried cranberries because that is what I had - delightful. I used lots of fresh dill from my gardent. I suspect this would also be good with basil. I will try that when basil is in season and let you know.

This is a great, tasty recipe. Even those in your circle of friends who claim not to like cous-cous will have a difficult time resisting this dish. This is moist, full of flavor, and totally satisfying.

Delicious summer salad. I used lemon juice instead of orange; dried cranberries instead of currants and a whole bunch of dill and was very happy with the results. I plan to make this for our office's summer picnic next week and I predict that it will be a big hit!

This is a very good side dish. The orange juice- olive oil dressing brings a lot of flavor to the usually bland couscous. I didn't have fresh dill and used just a small amount of dried -- also used diced apricot
