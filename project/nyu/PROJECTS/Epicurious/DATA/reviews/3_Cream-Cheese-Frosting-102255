I appreciate the simplicity of this frosting and the fact that you can adjust the amount of ingredients and add the sugar to taste.

absolutely love this frosting. not too sweet, love the lack of additional flavorings, it seems to add tang to the frosting.

There is a serious error with this recipe. It is missing a bit of vanilla and zest of lemon. My friend is a chef, and he added these. Once he included the flavoring the frosting tasted correct.

This frosting was so simple to make and so delicious!! I used it on a dark chocolate cake and was a big hit at my son's birthday party. It comes out very creamy and smooth and is easy to spread on the cake.
