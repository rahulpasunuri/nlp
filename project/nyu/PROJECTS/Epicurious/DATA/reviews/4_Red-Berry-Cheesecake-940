I made this for a birthday dinner along with a traditional family cheesecake. WOW! We all loved it. It's light and delicious. Truly a world-class dessert. A few changes: I halved the sugar for the main part of the cheesecake. I did not reduce the sugar for the sour creme part. Delicious! I also substituted blueberries for strawberries. Blueberries and raspberries make for a wonderful combination. LOVE this recipe and will make it again and again. This is a new family classic.

This cheesecake was very easy to make. I actually added some berries to the mixer after I folded the egg whites into the cream cheese. I also added some lemon juice to the sour cream mixture. The cake came out great. The only issue I ran into was that I had to cook my cake about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for. will make again, and try other creative "stir ins" but a really great basic recipe.

I am NOT a dessert maker but as I was tasked with bringing a dessert for our Family Xmas dinner. This was a real winner and easy-peasy! I particularly enjoyed how light tasting it was. I decorated the top with concentric rows of raspberries only and it looked lovely.

it was loved (and yes, request for the recipe followed). I made a gingersnap crust (same proportions but with gingersnaps and some ground ginger and crystallized ginger if you have some on hand) and also added lime to the mix, about 1 1/2 tsp zest and the juice of 1 lime. I also added the yolks to the batter because I didn't want to waste them and it also was great, gave it a nice color. very good stuff. I love the whipped egg whites.

I made this the first time for Christmas 1995 (the year it came out in the Dec. edition). The very best cheesecake. So easy. Simple and FABULOUS. Try it--you won't be disappointed!!!

This is by far the best cheesecake recipe that I've ever made/had. It's creamy, sweet and delicious. If you're not a fan of berries--improvise! Pour chocolate ganache over it, or swirl dulce de leche in the sour cream top...anyway you decide to top it, you won't be disappointed!

A wonderful, light and creamy cheesecake. I have made it several times with rave reviews each time. Wonderful with a berrysauce or fresh berries.

This makes the best cheesecake in the world. It is incredibly light, and slightly tart with the sour cream. I think it is perfect with berries, rather than a berry sauce. I love it tremendously.

I was disappointed with this recipe for two reasons. When made a day in advance, the crust had softened to the point of being too soggy for my taste. Second, while the light texture of the filling was appealing, I felt its taste needed to be sparked up with a berry sauce, and not just unadorned fresh berries. I will try another recipe next time.

Delectable! After pouring in half the batter, I sprinkled 1 cup berries on top, then finished with the rest of the batter. After baking and refrigerating, I garnished with more raspberries. I really like the texture that folding the egg whites in created. This cake is not too sweet and just the right consistency.

This turned out very wet and mushy, but I do not believe it was a fault in the recipe: I have recently read that cream cheese in the US contains different preservatives and stabilisers from that sold in the UK - considering I even added some cornflour to the recipe and still it was wet makes me sure it is the ingredients to blame! The flavour was good tho' - not too sweet - and the leftovers did not have to languish long in the fridge!

Fabulous recipe! I added about 1/4 cup of cherry pastry filling to batter. I also marbled some of the filing in the sour cream topping. It was great! I made another one for my family reunion..had several complements! I'll make it again when my in-laws give me my springform pan back.
