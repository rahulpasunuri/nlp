The salad was delicious for dinner, but even better with a poached egg on top for breakfast!

I was looking for a colorful salad for Mother's Day dinner for my vegetarian children to enjoy and tried this. Wow! The flavors and colors were great! Everyone loved the way the tart rhubarb melded with the oranges and beets and the tangy feta. I couldn't find watercress and just used mixed baby herb salad package but made everything else as written.

This was an interesting salad. I love beets so they were a lovely addition. The rhubarb was tart and blanching it for 2 minutes in sugar water didn't do a whole lot. I could do without them next time. Also, if you peel the oranges and take the orange out of its membrane, that is quite labor intensive. It took the longest out of all the steps. The vinaigrette was good with fresh orange juice & shallots. You can substitute any greens, which we did. Nothing too hardy but any spring green would be nice. I think rhubarb is best used in desserts and not for salads.

I served this for Easter. I added several cups of baby greens to the watercress. Rather than individual plates, I served salad in a large salad bowl. It was delicious. I agree that the rhubarb was overwhelmed by the other flavors. Next time, I'll skip it.

A unique idea of adding rhubarb to a salad and boiling it in sugar water does make it edible. However the rhubarb was overwhelmed with the strong flavors from the feta, beets and oranges. Next time I would omit the beets and feta and simply make it a rhubarb and orange salad. The dressing was wonderful.

I was really excited about this, but found for the amount of time involved, it muddled too many flavors. Also Kind of ended up feeling like a fruit salad.

This salad is absolutely delicious! In Austria you can't get watercress, so I used arugula instead, which tasted just as good. The tartness of the rhubarb perfectly balances the sweetness of the beets and the oranges. Used only apple vinegar rather than vinegar+lemon juice, because I'm not a fan of sour flavors.
