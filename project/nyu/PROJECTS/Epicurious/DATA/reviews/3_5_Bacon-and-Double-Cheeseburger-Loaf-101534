I don't like relish or bacon. I don't like onions or mayo on my burgers. I only I tried this recipe because I knew my family would like it, but... I though it was really good! The only change I made was to use 2 pounds of beef instead of 1.5

i didn't use the onion or the relish and it tasted really good. my brother doesn't like relish, and we had no onions because this was the 2 meat loaf that we made.

I really loved this recipe. I made a few substitutions: First, I used 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground beef, which I think made it more moist. I ditched the bacon altogether and, honestly, I did it because I was too lazy to add the additional step of frying up bacon. It was fine with out the bacon, it just tastes like a cheeseburger instead of a bacon-cheeseburger (big deal). I have to admit, using the relish took a lot for me because I don't consider myself much of a relish fan, however, I was glad I added it and really thought it balanced out the dish. All in all an extremely easy, tasty recipe.

This was just ok although I was expecting more based on the review. After the first bite I wasn't sure but it kind of grew on us the more we ate it. I didn't have any relish (because I don't like it) and as per other reviews I chopped up the bacon and put it in the meat which I think was the better choice. Perhaps I used the wrong size pan? I used a square pan and it was quite thin, maybe a loaf pan would have been better. I also took earlier advice and put bread slices underneath, however, there was no grease to soak up and the bread stuck to the meat in a pretty unappetizing way. Maybe I'll try it again with the loaf pan, minus the bread and hope for better results.

Let me start off by saying that I am not a meatloaf person. This recipe, however, was incredible! Thank you to everyone who contributed your thoughts. I sauteed the onions, cooked the bacon until crumbly and put it on top during the last 5 minutes. The only reason I didn't mix the bacon into the meatloaf is because I don't eat pork (at least I could still scrape off the bacon bits!). I also used BBQ sauce to turn this into a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger Meatloaf...fabulous! Everyone loved it.

This was very tasty and moist. Not dry at all. The only thing I did was I chopped up the bacon into little pieces and mixed it up in the meatloaf.

This was delicious! I substituted turkey bacon and added it to the meatloaf instead of on top as suggested. I also sauteed the onions for a couple of minutes after cooking the bacon. I had no white bread so I used whole grain bread crumbs, made fresh. I used 2 1/4 lbs. pork, veal & beef mix (didn't feel like portioning out the package) and put the full cup of cheese in the meatloaf and still added some on top. I might cut back on the meat as the extra made it slightly dry. All in all, it was delicious. I will definitely make this a staple on our house menu.

I have always liked meatloaf but this is THE BEST meatloaf I have ever had! I have made it twice. So easy and delicious! The first time without the relish and last night with it. It gave it an interesting hint of flavor. Next time I am going to try crumbled blue cheese in the meatloaf rather than cheddar. I have two get-togethers with friends in the near future and will serve this at both functions.

I said to my husband, "There's no need to ever make any other kind of meatloaf again, right?" and he said, "Definitely not!" This is great stuff!!! I added American cheese to the center of each meatloaf to make it a triple cheeseburger!

I made this last night & the kids liked it. I did cut out the relish & some of the onion as mentioned below, I also used the beef/pork/lamb mixture. Next time I'll saute the onion before adding as it was a bit crunchy. Not at all greasy.

Used two teaspoons of mustard (the regular wet stuff) and no onions, and I used four slices of regular white bread for crumbs (it soaked up the grease more), and it was great! I would definetly make it again, even my 3 year old loved it!

I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork. I mix the bacon in the meat mixture and omit the relish because my family does not like. You can spice it up. I have made both ways. My family likes, it is easy and economical.

I've made this once and found it VERY greasy, but i asked my grandmother and she said to try putting bread slices on the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease. I'm going to try this tonight along with using BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. Hopefully the results will be better - but the recipe is worth a try if you like meatloaf!

We think this is yummy. I make it as a loaf instead of spreading it in the pan. I also crumble about 8 pieces of bacon into the loaf. The room to play with the ingredients is endless.

NOT a low-fat/carb dish. Omit the Bacon - its superfluous (sp?). I made it with ground Lamb and it was great. Perfect comfort food, though a bit heavy. The meatloaf mixture itself was great I thought - especially adding the ketchup on top - saves you from adding any later!

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe to the letter, but was a bit disappointed in the result. Using the lean beef made the dish a little dry, and I think I would have added the bacon (chopped, fully fried) right into the beef mixture, rather than on-top.

This was a hit with my meat craving family. "Best meat loaf I ever made" I did substitute sweet pepper jelly (home made) for the relish and also added the jelly with the ketchup over the top. Delicious!!

First od all, the title of this dish does not do it justice. This is meat loaf would serve to company! I used 3/4 buffalo meat to 1/4 ground round. I used Ray Scott's Southern Style Chow Chow in place of the relish and used Atkins ketchup (which is more like a fabulous chili sauce) in place of the catsup. This is a keeper!

This meatloaf was delicious. On a quest for the perfect meatloaf and this one's really close. I actually saw the egg still on the counter as I put the pan into the oven, but it was still great. My only substitution, in addition to forgetting the egg, was to use corn relish I had on hand instead of pickle relish. Really really good meatloaf!

I have been making the classic Paul Prudhomme Cajun meatloaf for years, but it's a bit too spicy for my kids (ages 3 and 7) and my parents. So I decided to try this one. I think the taste is okay -- a little bland, but like I said, I'm used to spicier meatloaf. And I think it's too onion-y. Next time I will do as someone suggested and saute the onions first, plus I plan to add more spice without going over the top.

I love this recipe! I serve it to family and friends, everyone raves. Tonight I did not have bread crumbs so I substituted crushed potato chips and used bar-b-q sauce instead of ketchup.

This is a very good meatloaf. I've made it with ground beef and with a mixture of ground beef and pork. I prefer the mixture. It's very greasy and I drained it twice during cooking so it wouldn't be swimming in grease when it was done. It's different and worth trying.

This was a great meatloaf. My boyfriend and a friend that we had over for dinner both loved it. The only modification I made was I added ketchup in the mix as well as putting it on top.

I made this recipe, with a few alterations, for my husband last night and he loved it. Today we had it in a meatloaf sandwich which was also a big hit. Having read the reviews before making it, I decided to follow several reviewers suggestions. I elimiated the bacon slices and substituted 100% real crumbled bacon pieces. This significantly decreased the amount of fat and also eliminated the dirty skillet! My husband does not like onions so I only used 1/4 of an onion. I eliminated the mayo, dry mustard and relish. I substituted 2 tsp dijon mustard and 2 tsp worchestershire sauce and also increased the eggs to 2 and added a full cup of cheese to the meat mixture. I will definitely make this delicious meatloaf again soon.

We really enjoyed this recipe! The second time around was even better: I omitted the relish, dry mustard, and the mayo and used 1-2 tbl of Dijon mustard and a dash of worchestershire instead. I used more cheese (X-sharp cheddar of course) because I inadvertently added the entire amount to the mix then needed more for the top. Will repeat that move again next time.

This should be renamed GUYS I KNOW WHAT'S IN YOUR FRIG. There is no way you can screw this up. Ketchup, nah, use that barbeque sauce. You know you have stale bread so whip out that food processor your last girlfriend got you. And who among us doesn't have 2-3 open jars of different relishes and mustards? And remember onions and ground beef are the two most important of the four food groups. A diffent cheese every time and you could eat it seven days a week and still claim a balanced diet. Oh yeah I forgot, It was pretty darn good!

Yum yum yum. This was really good, even my six year old liked it and he hates everything. I used meatloaf mix (ground beef, veal, and pork) and it turned out great....although how can you go wrong with bacon and cheese? I didn't add the relish and didn't miss it. I will definitely make this again!

We like this dish very much and make it alot now. My kids love it, and its very good on sandwiches, if you have any left over! We use a little garlic salt in the uncooked meat and add a little ketsup in the mixture as well as on top, and lots of cheese and onions inside. Its great with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and corn.

My husband and I love this meatloaf, but you must mix it as lightly as possible for a good texture. It also helps to drain accumulated grease from pan once or twice during baking. We sometimes use ground turkey and 1/2 the bacon to lower the fat and calorie content. It's good that way too!

This is a great meatloaf. I used ground turkey, and a combination of cheeses. The meatloaf smelled great while cooking, and my family loved it. One child picked off the cheese and bacon (even though he loves both), and I didn't think either added tremendously to the flavor. Will definitely make this again.

This was possibly the moistest meatloaf I have ever made. I accidently added 1 cup of cheese and it turned out delicious. (Still use 1/2 cup for the top). Also I used turkey bacon -- 4 cooked slices on the top & 1 uncooked slice cut up in the loaf added moistness, onion powder (since we are not big fans of onions), regular pickle relish and 1 tsp. dry mustard & 1 tsp. French's mustard. I am making it again tonight....I would definately recommend this dish.

I have two teen agers at home. Needless to say, one of their favorite foods is the cheeseburger. I added salad as a side dish. They though the meatloaf was great as long as I did not call it a meatloaf. Thank you for this recipe. It will be used at our home very often.

Normally I would not have made this recipe, but my husband made me make it. He was eagerly anticipating this meal. However, neither he nor I enjoyed it. I thought that there was just too much stuff in this meatloaf which made the texture too wet and mushy. Not to mention the grease. I must have poured off 1/2 cup! I didn't enjoy the flavor either; the ingredients just didn't meld. I would have rather had a REAL bacon cheeseburger!
