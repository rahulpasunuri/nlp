My dad is a Parker House roll fanatic (something about having tasted the 'originals') and he LOVES these rolls. Whenever I'm feeling like I need to spoil my old dad, I whip out a batch of these rolls. Normally I prefer a nice crusty roll, but these are a great excuse to eat a lot of honey butter and lick my fingers, so I can sacrifice my snooty 'Euro-Artisinal-Crusty-Roll' tendenceis to sacrifice myself on the altar of good old American sweet dinner rolls every once in a while...

I made these rollls a couple of weeks ago. I doulbed the recipe and made 40 rolls that fit in a half sheet pan (5x8). I changed some of the directions. I added the shortening,sugar, and salt to the milk to dissolve the shortening easier.(Mama Dip's way) After proofing, I shaped them into balls and let them proof in my warm bedroom loosely covered. If you place in the refrig. that will retard the dough. They came out big and fluffy. The leftovers we toasted lightly and ate w/ butter and honey.

These were substantially below the "okay" level...I have a 3 hour bun recipe that I been making for two decades that I thought I'd compare these to...and possibly change my Christmas dinner rolls. NOT A CHANCE. Firstly, these buns need to be 1 1/2 times because they don't fill the pan. Secondly, the refrigerator method goes against any yeast recipe I've known. I preheated my oven to 100 degrees and let them rise for 2 1/2 hours and they still didn't get above the top of the pan. I added fresh grated parmesan cheese to the top which was nice - but these are far from superior buns - they are "flat", a no show stopper and I will not make them again....this is one foodie who's gone back to her old standbye

Usually yeast productrs and i don't work well together. LOL. I was nervous trying this recipe for the first time. To my utter suprise and delight, the dough rose and was perfec as far asI could tell. The only frustration for me after that was cutting the pieces for the rolls to thge proper dimensions. After trial and numerous errors, success. They are currently restin g in the fridge in the buttered pan awaqitng their time in the oven to turn out as I forsee as light, fluffy and flaky. Just like this cook. LOL. Will let you know how it went after they come out of the oven. Duane

Delicious! This was my first attempt at making homemade rolls and I was a bit daunted by the seemingly complicated cutting and folding instructions. It was much easier to do than it seemed and even the uneven pieces turned into beautiful rolls. I'll definitely be pulling this one back out at Christmas.

These were OK. I would make these for a fast evening dinner but not for anything too fancy. Defiantly not your grandmothers rolls!

I made these for the first time on Thanksgiving. The only problem I had was that the pan must have been too big - the cut and folded rolls did not fill it up. No real harm, though, and they turned out well. The Maldon was a big hit.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were scrumptious!! Many compliments. The Maldon sea salt flakes were a really nice touch, BTW.

Just a little tip, turn the oven light on in the oven and let the dough rise there...no drafts! Also, I always use butter in place of shortening. And, the last time I made these rolls, I added just a couple drops of yellow food coloring to the yeast mixture--they don't look quite as anemic.

These rolls came out perfect for me on Thanksgiving. I found the recipe in the print version of the magazine and they looked like just the kind of rolls for a special meal. They are soft and buttery with just the right amount of salt and sweet. I was a little skeptical that they did not need to be proofed in the baking tray but they worked out great!

I've made these rolls 3x since it first appeared in Bon Apetit a couple of weeks ago. Each time, the family devours them with mmms and ahhhs. Went beautifully with a spiral ham last night and we used leftovers for ham biscuits this morning. The cut, butter, fold, repeat is somewhat silly and I look forward to trying Vancouver's suggestion next time. I'll also allow them to rise outside of the fridge. Thanks for the suggestions!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they stole the show: light, yeasty, buttery, warm, irresistible. It's wonderful to bake such a humble and classically American roll and have it turn out to be sublime. I made them almost exactly as directed: cutting, buttering and rolling each one separately took very little time and gave them a terrific form, suggestive of a little snail. I had the pan in the fridge for about 4 hours and on the counter for another 20 minutes or so before I baked them, and they rose very nicely. The sprinkle of Maldon salt on the top was perfect. The only change I made was to leave them in for a couple of minutes longer while I raised the oven temp for the next dish, and that gave the tops a little more color.

I loved these rolls. They are slightly crusty on the outside and incredibly flaky on the inside. I followed A Cook from Vancouver's suggestion and let them rise on the counter instead of the refrigerator. They came out quite small anyway, but very cute and delicious. I didn't put a lot of effort into cutting the dough in equally-sized rectangles. The rolls came out perfect anyway, in various sizes. It makes them look more rustic and homemade. I'm making them for my guests on Thanksgiving.

Easy to make and great workable dough.

These rolls were excellent, but there were a few glitches with the recipe. First, the directions on cutting these was just silly and instead I would just roll half the dough out, brush half with melted butter then fold over. I would then take the long roll and place in the baking dish, again brushing it with butter then covering in salt. With two rolls in the pan I would then cut them into slices so that when they come out of the oven they will tear apart nicely. Second, the recipe has you put them in the fridge for 30 minutes, which caused them not to rise at all so they were small little buns, I would rise them on the counter for about 30 minutes until doubled in size. Other than they refrigerator rising and the funny cutting these buns were delicious and I can't wait to make them again.
