Raw onions, though delicious, leave us both with unpleasant aftereffects. Here's a quick and easy way to improve upon the flavor while eliminating all those problems.

I thought I was slicing onions thinly, but when I went to serve them with the fish, I wish they'd been even thinner. Otherwise, this is a good recipe, but I thought they were too salty - I would cut back to 1-2 tsp next time.

Quick and dirty, super easy, wonderfully delicious. Had them with the pork pibil and they helped balance that dish. And they last and last, I use them all the time on sandwiches and salads.

A wonderful foil for puerco pibil or carnitas. Very cooling, with a bit of bite. Saves well in the fridge...I tasted one before I threw it out about two months after making it, and it still tasted fine.

I made this recipe to go with the Yucatecan Grilled Mahi-Mahi and didn't start the day before. After about 1 hour of marinating we tried them and although good - MUCH better the next day.

This was great with the Cochinita pibil pork. I used 3 tsp. allspice powder since I didn't have whole Allspice. I sliced the onions about 1/4" thick; thinner would've def been better. The leftovers have been great on ham sandwiches and tuna melts. They don't need to chill overnight.
