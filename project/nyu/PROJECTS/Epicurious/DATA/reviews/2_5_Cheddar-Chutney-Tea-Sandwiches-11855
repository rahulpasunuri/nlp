I had these at a tea house and I wish they had given me a whole plate of them. Now I just need to figure out where and which Major Grey chutney to buy.

I like Major Grey's chutney and hated these. I threw away the cheddar/chutney mix at 11pm the night before my daughter's tea party.

These sandwiches are really good and I've made them several times for small parties. I don't know why they aren't more highly rated here. I do reduce the chutney by about 1/4, and I also add a pinch of ground tumeric and 1/2 t of ground coriander for more flavor.

The cheddar is WAY too heavy for the chutney. Perhaps a lighter cheese would be better but there are other recipes out there and I don't feel like tweaking this one.

A much simpler thing to do is to put a slice of good sharp cheddar and a dollup of major grey's chutney together on good bread (or a biscuit!). It is a winning combination when done simply.

The combination of flavors tasted good, but the filling was much to soppy to use as a sandwich filling. I ended up serving it as an open-faced sandwich. Although it was tasty, I wouldn't make it again.

I was looking for a different sandwich recipe to prepare for lunches to take to work and decided to try this one. Thought it was so-so at best and kind of strange at worst. Would not make it again--although the cheddar chutney toasts on this website look good, so might try them instead. As far as tea sandwiches go, I hosted a bridal shower this summer and prepared a lot of better ones from this site than this

I made these for a bridal shower, and the guests raved about these! I used unsalted butter on the edges rather than the mayo.

I omitted the coriander and the mayonnaise and spread the mixture on toasted crumpet quarters. Yummy!

To my taste this combination of flavors did not work at all. My guests hardly touched these. (There is a chicken tea sandwich with smoked almonds recipe on this site that is just delicious!).

Fantastic. Instead of coating with mayo and dipping in cilantro, I sprinkled cilantro on top of cheddar/chutney mix before closing sandwiches, and served with cilantro scattered on top to identify them. I will add more chutney next time. Definitely try this one--the most popular at a shower/tea, and great on its own as a lunchtime sandwich!

I used this recipe for a open house tea party. It was one of the outstanding tea sandwichs. I made the filling the nite before and made sandwichs morning of. i used a sweet black Russian Rye with raisins as the bread. I made a second time and used a different chutney and it was NOT as good.

I made this for a wedding shower also. However, I cut down the sour cream a little bit and upped the cream cheese a bit, and served it with crackers instead of between bread. Not that it didn't make good sandwiches, but we had four different types already on the menu and wanted something different.

I thought this was delicious, although I see how it might be an acquired taste. I made a bunch of these for a wedding shower, and everyone gobbled them up and wanted the recipe.

This recipe turned out to be a disappointment... I used mango chutney with the cheddar and sour cream -- it was a strange combination that I wouldn't advise repeating. After an initial taste, I decided not to serve this to my guests. Perhaps another reader found a more appealing blend of ingredients.
