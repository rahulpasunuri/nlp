the moistest chicken ever. My husband thought the flavor was great, I would probably add more garlic next time. I used panko as I did not have the bread.

I did the REALLY lazy version, and it was still amazing. (No rating since I made so many changes.) Boneless skinless breasts (no pan searing), packaged breadcrumbs, sundried tomato spread plus some olive oil, garlic powder instead of fresh. I also added a touch of red pepper flakes, dried basil, and dried oregano. With the shortcuts I just mixed by hand until it had a pasty texture (awesome because I hate washing my food processor). I spread the mixture on about a centimeter thick and baked in a pyrex dish at 375 for about 30 minutes. No burning problem, no need for foil, and it was DELISH. Served with leek/butternut squash risotto. Will also saute some greens next time, too.

I didn't read the reviews BEFORE I made this. It was interesting to read them after the fact, especially "A Cook" who used also gluten-free (GF) bread crumbs. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I didn't brown them in the pan first. I used GF bread crumbs, because that's all I can use. I didn't use the full amount of sun-dried tomatoes, but instead added some tomato sauce to give it extra moisture. I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes. I'd absolutely decrease the time and the temperature, as I see now that other people did as well. Also, the addition of parmesan cheese and parsley sounds great. I'd definitely make it again. My family loved it as it was, but I'll still make the changes.

I use boneless chicken breasts for this recipe and just reduce the cooking time. I also use gluten free bread and it is much better than with regular bread crumbs. Gluten free bread is a little harder so when you put it in the food processor with the other ingredients - it retains a larger "crumb" if you will. The result is awesome. This dish is really easy to make and easily adaptable to individual likes/disklikes.

Delicious and simple. Would back off a bit on the amount of bread crumbs, and add parmesan cheese and a bit of parsley for color. Made it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, maybe the with skin on wold make it a bit juicier. Served w/ brown rice and steamed zucchini.

Really good. Really easy too. Used Ian's whole wheat breadcrumbs and it was good. Served it with Arugula Salad with Lemon Parmesan Dressing and Shaved Brussels Sprout and Shallot Saute (both on Epicurious as well). Really good - the 7 and 2 year old nephews liked the breadcrumb mixture also!

Hubby enjoyed it - I increase the amount of tomatoes and oil and cooked for 25mins.

This is great but I added 1/2c grated parmesan and a little more tomato. We love this on bone-in chicken breasts with skin removed. Parsley is a nice addition as it adds color.

Love this recipe! 2 cups of bread crumbs are a bit much. A little more than a cup is enough.

Very subtle flavors...I was expecting, and hoping for, more oomph. A little too bland for us. I followed the recipe exactly.

Rating: 3
This is quite good. I did use Ian's bread crumbs (italian herbed) and it worked pretty well. I also did use the breasts with skins and bones. The only thing is I'd split the breasts next time (in half) for better cooking time. It was quite yummy. I made it with orzo with green onions and cheese and that was a good side dish.

Rating: 3
this was delicious! And very quick and easy to make. I browned the chicken in a cast iron skillet and put it in the oven in the same pan. I listened the reviews on here and lowered the oven temp to 350. I checked after 20 minutes and it was almost done. I left it in for 5 more minutes and the chicken was perfect! I think I could have gone up to 375 to brown the breadcrumbs a bit more, but the broiler worked just as well. I put some chopped up zucchini and squash right in the pan with the chicken, it was delicious. Will definitely make this recipe again!

I enjoyed this recipe, but my husband asked that I not make it again. You really have to be a sun-dried tomato lover to love this one. The chicken came out moist, and the stuffing was a wonderful crispy texture. the flavor, though, was all about the sun-dried tomatoes.

I made this tonight for my parents. It was the first dinner I've cooked for them since I moved away from home. Browning the skin in the sun-dried tomato oil gave it a great flavor. I did find that the tomatoes were starting to burn when I took the chicken from the oven, so I will probably tent the baking sheet with foil next time. I served the chicken with simple roasted asparagus, bread, and a fresh pineapple upside-down cake. Everything turned out so well and I will most certainly make this dish again. :)

I made this about a month ago. I used the bone in breast as recommended in the recipe, as the bones add more flavor. I removed the skin before browning. I didn't have sundried tomatoes in oil, so I just used regular sundried tomates I buy in bulk. They are soft and moist and I minced them then added EVOO in with the bread crumbs,garlic and some pepper until crumbs held together, but weren't greasy. I also lowered the oven temperature to 350 and still found you had to watch for burning and tent with foil last half of baking or so. Checked after 25 minutes and put in for another 5, depends on size/thickness of breast. Also used stainless ovenproof skillet to brown breasts, topped with crumbs, put in oven right in skillet. Works great, less cleanup. I use this method for alot of different smaller cuts of meat, pork loins, small roasts. Hubby loved it, lots of flavor, meat very moist. Am making again tonight and serving with roasted fennel with pinenuts and brown rice.

Everyone loved this recipe. I removed the skin so i didn't have to brown and it was just fine. I added more tomatoes and also 1/2 c. parmesan. Really great and easy/quick.

As simple as this is, came out wonderfully! I used boneless, skinless breasts and added a bit of parmesan cheese. I suggest using foil over the top so as not to burn the garlic crust. -Will become one of my staples.

This would have been great, but with the sunflower oil in the tomatoes I suppose, the crust burned a bit before I noticed. The spinach, basil, ricotta dish makes for a good accompaniment all the same.

I "clip" recipes and this one has been on file awaiting trial since it was published in Bon Appetit in 2/2000. My husband and our guest remarked on the moisture of the chicken and the delicious flavor added by the crust. I prepared the recipe exactly as written. RE: dryness and flavor: - I think that it is important to understand that commercially prepared dried breadcrumbs cannot be substituted for the fresh French bread crumbs called for without totally changing the character and outcome of the recipe. The moisture of the rough, fresh crumbs combined with the 2 tablespoons of olive oil drained from the tomatoes will adhere very well to the surface of the chicken when it is pressed into place. Be sure to adequately season the chicken with salt and freshly ground pepper, as directed. Also, it is important to note that a bone in chicken breast maintains moisture better and has better flavor than a boneless one&and the presentation is more attractive. The only reason that I did not give the recipe 4 stars is that there was an issue with the particles of sun-dried tomatoes on the surface of the crust becoming very dark (bordering on burnt) in contrast to the bread crumbs before the chicken was fully cooked. When I noticed that this was happening, I placed a sheet of foil loosely over the chicken and that seemed to do the trick. Next time I will watch carefully and add the foil shield earlier (or perhaps reduce the temperature to 350° after 15 minutes.

WOW! This was so good! I flattened skinless/boneless breasts and then dipped them into an egg/milk combo before coating them with the breadcrumb mixture. I used less fresh breadcrumbs then specified to make the mixture rich and flavorful. Just for fun, I also coated and cooked a portabello mushroom in the same manner. Yummy!

great recipe! I used cornflakes instead of breadcrumbs and roasted the garlic to bring out more of that flavor...family loves this recipe!

Rating: 3
Really tasty and so easy! I'm a beginner and found this very easy to make. Plus, it got rave reviews from my fella. I substituted boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 8 oz each). I only used two and did not use all of the breadcrumb mix (though I used most of it). I used a small glass baking dish and put the oil from the pan in the bottom along with a bit more oil from the sundrieed tomatoes. I cut the baking time down to about 25 minutes and it was perfect.

This chicken received rave reviews when I served it with fresh summer vegetables. I used skinless breast and altered the recipe a bit. I cut a pocket in each breast and put 1 tablespoon of tomato/bread mixture in the pocket. I also dredged each breast lightly in flour before sauting it. As other cooks have suggested, I put pan drippings and remaining oil in the bottom of the dish; and used the smallest baking dish possible.

I would make this recipe again, it was great. I made the mistake of trying to make it on a student budget the first time 'sans' blender so it didnt really work but the second time with a blender it was great.

Very good. I, too, used boneless breasts (with the skin on) and shortened the cooking time accordingly. Had enough breadcrumb mixture left over for 3 - 4 more breasts.

I made this dish last night for some new friends that I was hoping to impress - and it came out GREAT! I read the other reviews and paid attention to how dry the crust mixture turned out. I cooked the breasts in about 4 tbsp of the sun dried tomato oil and in addition to adding the oil to the mixture as directed, I also added the leftover juices/oil from the pan I cooked the chicken in. This made the mixture very moist and it came out as kind of a stuffing consistency and was wonderful! My husband says this is a keeper for sure! It is VERY important not to overcook the chicken. I did skinless, boneless breasts and the 'crust' kept them moist and tender. I also 'made' the bread crumbs myself from fresh french bread, which I think made a difference. Our guests raved and insisted I send them the recipe - delicious!

I used boneless, skinless breasts and pounded them slightly. I put them in a glass baking dish just barely big enough to fit them in and pressed the breadcrumb mixturte all the way to the edges. It came out moist and delicious.

I used Progresso breadcrumbs instead of the French bread--maybe that was part of the problem, but this dish was SO dry and without very much taste.

This is an easy recipe which is elegant enough for company. Instead of using bone-in breasts we prefer to use boneless thighs. The dish can be made ahead of time which is a bonus.

Rating: 3
Very good recipe which allows for some minor modifications and creativity. I would like to add that the cook from 1/5 likely thinks Chef Boyardee is representative of Italian cooking. True Italy Italian cooking is far different than what is found in the US. The larger emigrant sending areas to the US -- Sicily being one -- cook much differently than in Northern Italy. I grew up in South Philly and have traveled extensively in Italy. Not the same cuisine. One is not necessarily better than the other -- just different. People get so hung up with following (what they believe) to be ultimate cooking rules. Live a little!

Rating: 3
To the cook on 1/5, I can't imagine anyone not liking sun-dried tomatoes. As with anything dried, the flavors intensify. As to whether sun-dried tomatoes are considered true Italian fare, I couldn't say. But I don't see that this recipe bills itself as authentic Italian and, as a previous review said, who cares?

Rating: 3
I'm not a very experienced cook, so I have been looking for new and interesting ideas to make for dinner. My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish. I followed the recipe for the breadcrumbs, but used a little something from mom. I used skinless, boneless chicken breast, then "marinade" them in a milk and egg mixture (1 1/2 cup milk wih 1 egg) with a light seasoning. I think this added a touch of moisture to the chicken, and also helped bind lots of the crust. Half way through cooking, I drizzled a bit of the mixture over the chicken to keep moist. No complants in this house!! Lots of flavour! Will make again!

Only so-so. The crust was quite tasty, but the chicken tasteless, even with heavy seasoning of salt and pepper. The crust flavors just don't penetrate the chicken.

I have made this dish a couple of times and I think it's quick, easy and very flavorful - I use boneless, skinless breasts. To the cook who dissed it because she doesn't think sun-dried tomatoes are "authentically" Italian - who cares? They're still yummy, a lot of people like them, and not everything has to be 100% authentic to taste good.

My husband and I really liked this dish. I did not cut down on the breadcrumbs, but added a little fresh basil to the mixture which boosted the flavor a bit. This was simple, quick, and very tasty for a weeknight dinner.

This recipie sounds better than it is. The dish was so so. I don't think I'd make it again. I did take the advice of others who recommended to reduce the amount of breadcrumbs by half. Overall it was just sort of blah.

A very simple yet tasty recipe. Agree with others to reduce breadcrumbs to half...has more flavor. I also used large boneless and skinless chicken breasts, browning it quickly and then putting in a 350F oven for 25 minutes. an angel in Toronto

In my opinion, this was just okay. I wouldn't make it again. Also, I think sun-dried tomatoes are simply an over-rated trend-something food gurus have convinced us are so rustically Italian. I know a lot of Italian people because I live in a largely Italian ethnic place, and none that I know of use sun- dried tomatoes. I don't know why I made this.

I was so excited about this recipe. It sounded so good on paper. First of all, I used bread crumbs from a can. If you use bread crumbs from the grocery store be sure to cut the quantity in half at least. And I think I over processed the topping it because the sundried tomatoes were all but ground up. Could not taste the garlic because there were too many bread crumbs. Get the picture? The frying part made such a mess. And I could not taste the sundried tomato oil flavor. Plus chicken breasts I bought from Costco were just enormous. None of my guests could finish theirs. I really want to like this recipe. It seems like such a winner, so I'll learn from this time and try it again.

This is a great recipe! Although I create a lot of "crusts" for chicken, roasts, etc., this is not a combination I've ever come up with. It's simple,quick, and inexpensive. Best of all, my husband the chicken-hater even liked it(once I convinced him that the pieces of tomato weren't raisins).

An interesting twist on breaded chicken. The tomatoes give it a unique flavor, but I agree with the other reviewer who thought that it didn't have an overbearing sun-dried tomato taste. I too used dried bread crumbs and boneless skinless breasts with a very satisfactory result.

(For those of you who are trying to organize your recipe files against the magazine, this recipe came out in the February 2000 issue!) I love this recipe - very easy yet can be elegant. Visually appealing when paired with the bright green of the spinach. I also prefer to use boneless skinless thighs, move flavour without the fat.

Excellent recipe. I don't normally care for sun-dried tomatoes, but combined with the garlic crust, this was great. My boyfriend loved it too.

I, too, used boneless, skinless breasts. They browned up nicely in the sun-dried tomato oil. I am glad there is a photo with this recipe, as I thought my preparation wasn't the prettiest thing...but it looks just like the photo. My husband really liked this, and only wished that there were some type of sauce to compliment it. It was very yummy, extremely flavorful, and a nice change of pace. I used a Calphalon saute' pan to brown the breasts, and then put the same pan in the oven after adding the crust. One fewer dish to wash!

Great recipe for inspiration. I used boneless, skinless,pounded turkey breast and added a little Zinfedel wine while sauteing meat. I added calumetta olives to bread mixture plus asiago cheese. Reduce baking time by half and don't add salt to bread mixture as olives and cheese will give it enough. My husband loved it and exclaimed-i bet I'll never see this again. He says that about all new recipes he likes. I'm always experimenting and trying something new. Don't worry he will have it again but it may not be exactly the same!!!
