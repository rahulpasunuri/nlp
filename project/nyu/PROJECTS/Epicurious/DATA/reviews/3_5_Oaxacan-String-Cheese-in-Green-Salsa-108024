Having just come from Oaxaca and dined at La Olla (the inspiration for this recipe) several times, I think I see what the problem is here for the reviewers who complain of "messiness." My friends, this is not meant to be served as a "dip" -- any more than mole negro would be! At La Olla, it is served as a main course, to be eaten at the table with knife and fork (and spoon!). It can be served as an appetizer, but definitely not as a dip. And by the way, La Olla adds nopales to their salsa verde -- simply saute them, with or before the onion, for about 10-20 minutes.

I think I figured out why everyone else found this so messy. Oaxacan string cheese and the alternate cheese suggestions all melt too readily, not holding their shape in the hot salsa. I used queso panela, another mild Mexican cheese. It softens gently, but holds its shape on the hot pan, and in the salsa. A truly delicious first course. We fold a piece of cheese with some of the surrounding salsa into a hot tortilla, and eat it like a soft taco.

Amazingly tasty, but hugely messy. Also, it's really difficult to keep at the right consistancy. The minute it's melty enough to eat, it starts to glob up so it's hard to handle. This was delicious and made a TON of dip, but I probably won't make it again.

I was going to make this for a party but it was so messy to eat that I changed my mind. Didn't want to be cleaning dried green cheese off my rugs. My husband loved it so would make it again for him.

This was a pretty good and easy dish to make.....just VERY messy to eat! People had a hard time getting the cheese out.......maybe serving a small ramekin full of the sauce and cheese and pass along side chips or tortillas would be a little easier!
