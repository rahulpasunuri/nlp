Really loved this soup! I had fresh herbs lying around, so I added parsley, basil, cilantro and mint leaves before pureeing.

Cookinggal77's husband here. Just made this incredible soup for the first time to share with my Monday night run group. It's a hot one today and I think a cold serving will be a real hit. Now I just need to give the group a heads-up that someone might want to bring some protein to the post run feast :-)

Loved the flavors! We ate it hot the first day and cold a few days later and it was great both ways. In the hot version, i was not sure the coriander was the right spice. I loved it in the cold one though! also easy to make.

This is a great base soup, change up the herbs and spices for whatever your craving. The cream is not necessary. I didn't bother seeding or skinning the veggies, instead I put the soup through a sieve after pureeing. Served at a dinner party, it was a hit.

This is an outstanding and EASY soup, especially when vine-ripened tomatoes are in abundance. I do peel the peppers before blending for more tomato flavor and less charcoal taste-it's very easy once peppers have cooled in the pan juices. Try making a large batch and freezing for serving in winter. Also, straining through a sieve and serving hot gives this otherwise chunky soup an elegant quality for a special winter dinner.

Excellent flavor, color and texture when served cold. Similar to gazpacho but slightly more savory. I would definitely skin the peppers before blending next time. I also thought the cream was unneccessary.

This soup is unique. I was expecting it to be more 'soupy' but it's more of a hearty chowder. I might add a little more tomato to the soup since the peppers seem to dominate the flavor.

This recipe did not go over well with my family. The flavors were just too asoteric. In addition, I used red peppers that had been grilled over charcoal and I think that give the soup a charred flavor.

delicious, easy-to-make soup! a great make-ahead summer meal. i tripled the ingredients (and also increased broiling time until veggies were tender) then served this for company--everyone loved it!

I modified this recipie slightly- instead of mint, I used fresh basil. I used a variety of fresh local organic tomatoes. I also added more garlic and served the soup hot. That being said, it was delicious and a great way to show off great summer tomatoes. If you are thinking of wine pairings- the flavor is pretty delicate so think non-oaky whites or nice dry french rose.

I would make this once a season, it's something to look forward to, but once is enough, it's unique.
