this is delicious. rich and fudgy, i made only minor changes. had to substitute bittersweet chocolate for the unsweetened chocolate and thus reduced the sugar in the filling by 3 tablespoons. i also added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the crust. this is easy to make although time consuming. i am not sure i will make it again because although it was delicious I am not sure it was very distinctive. the crust and the brownie blended together and it was not so much a brownie tart as much as a really good brownie.

Definitely a crowd pleaser! I made this for a Mother's Day dinner and received many compliments. I followed the suggestions made by another reviewer (substituted 1 ounce of bittersweet chocolate and 3 tablespoons of brown sugar). Like others have commented, the major downside to the recipe is the amount of time it takes because of the freezing/cooling/waiting. I settled for a chilled crust rather than a frozen crust prior to pouring in the filling, but it didn't seem to subtract from the dessert at all.

I had a copy of a recipe with the same title that I had cut out of Bon Appetit, heaven alone knows how long ago. Unfortunately, I missed the instructions for the glaze so I went onto this site to get that part. I wonder who borrowed from whom! My recipe for the crust uses 1/4 cup sugar, 8 T of butter and does not call for either pre-chilling or pre-baking. The filling is the same but is poured onto an unbaked crust. The total baking time of 25 minutes is definitely too short but 40 is way too long. I used the walnuts that were called for but there was no menion of the white chocolate drizzle, whipped cream or fruit sauces. Interesting. Can't rate the taste yet, but I did get an uneven, cracked top.

I was in a hurry the last time I made this and changed quite a few things for time's sake. I made a crust using half a cake mix, an egg, and a couple of tbs of melted butter, pressed it into the bottom of a 9x13" pan, poured the brownie batter in, and baked the entire thing. I cut it into squares to serve, sifted powdered sugar over the top, and recieved at least as good remarks about it as before. Cooking it at the same time as the crust cut down on a lot of prep time, as did using the cheat-crust and eliminating the sauce. A very good recipe, easy to change to suit the situation.

I brought this to dinner party last night and it received rave reviews. If I were rating on taste alone I would give it 4 forks. However, when you toss in preparation it is bumped to a 3; not because it is difficult, because it is really easy, but because you are always waiting for one step to finish before you can move on. I think next time I would eliminate freezing and/or cooling the crust. I used suggestions in other reviews about the crust not being sweet enough and used 3 tbsp brown sugar and bittersweet chocolate and the crust tasted great. It tasted great, but it came out more like cookie batter. I used the back of a spoon and spread it into the tart pan, which worked out fine. I did like the fact that it was basically a dressed up brownie that you can take to a party - it looks more difficult than it is.

This was good - maybe even very good - but I wouldn't make it again, at least not without changes. The filling was nice, and I topped it with a ganache (replaced butter and oil with heavy cream). It was very pretty, and I took it to a party where it was greatly enjoyed. I added 10 min to baking time and it was still nowhere near "moist crumbs" - so I took it out anyway and it was perfect. The crust is not worth it though. Way too many useless steps, for a result that is neither crispy, crunchy, flakey, or flavorful. I would replace it with a pastry crust if I make this again.

I made this for a large party and everyone loved it!! It was extremely easy to make. I acutally cut the butter by a tablespoon and the chocolate in the crust and it was perfect!!!

Love this recipe. Have made it with a hazelnut cookie crust (liked it better than the original). Have also use semolina flour in brownie, gave it a nutty flavor. I prefer to glaze it with a caramel glaze than the bitter chocolate glaze. A hit with all ages

It was quite time consuming considering the final result. I didn't like the "crust" at all...I thought it was greasy & flavorless. The middle was quite good. My top, however, rose unevenly & fell apart when I cut into it. My co-workers (who probably aren't as fussy as I am) loved it! I wouldn't make this again...I just don't think that it was worth the effort.

This was a very easy dessert to make. Most of the time was spent waiting for things to cool down before going to the next step. I used Scharfenberger chocolate and the results were wonderful. This is a very rich dessert. Agree with underbaking the tart. I baked for 35 minutes instead of 40.

This tart looked great and was very rich and fudgy. As a fan of milk chocolate I found it (espec the glaze) to be too bitter so probably will not make it again.

I'm usually not to adept at the decorating part, but the glaze was easy to apply. The tart looked fantastic! Highly recommend this one.

THis is excellent. The first time I made it, I overbaked it, and it came out rather dry. Now I try to underbake it a little- it comes out a little fudgey that way. My youngest daughter, who professes not to like chocolate, has had several pieces. None of them like nuts, but ate them happily in this tart. I also substituted margarine for the butter, and water for the milk, and it came out fine.

Very rich and chocolatey. (Baked it for thirty minutes only). I was worried when I saw there was only two tablespoons of sugar in the cookie crust, but the brownie part certainly adds the sweetness the crust is lacking. I made the tart to take to a New Years party, and everyone seemed to enjoy it very much. The white chocolate made the dessert look great.

Very good. I've made this several times and it is not too hard.

I thought that this was very easy to make and it turned out so well. Everyone loved it! I didn't put the glaze on the top, and I served it with whipped cream on the side. If I had more time I would have done the glaze, for appearances only. It was wonderfully rich even without it!

Outstanding! Got numerous requests for the recipe-- NOT your ordinary brownie. A "keeper".

I was prepared to be unimpressed by this but was very supprised by how good it turned out. Take your pick but nuts are a must.

i would make it again even though i did not think it was as special as other reviewers. I thought the crust was rather bland & needed sweetening. also i will leave out nuts next time.

Very rich but I have to agree it is delicious. I made this for my boss as a fathers day treat and it was a huge hit. He is a chocoholic and really loves his desserts. He said it was the best brownie he ever had! Yippee!! I also took the advise of less baking time and I agree it was perfect with 30-35 minutes instead of 40 minutes.

This was outstanding. I followed the recipe but left out the pecans and it was delicious. This can be made one day ahead and is fine and looks beautiful. Everyone from my teenagers to the adults loved it.

I made this Tart last night and it was GREAT ! though next time I will bake it slightly less time than was asked for . Also I think it would just as nice with some powdered sugar sprinkled on top instead of the glaze . ( just an idea )

I am sure that chocolate lovers will make ths dish several times, and it´s great to bring to a party and share it with loved ones,and you won´t look like a cow because of eating it alone...however, the trick to melting white chocolate is to put it over a saucepan of hot(BE CAREFUL IT DOESN´T BOIL)water, as it scorches easily, and remove fron heat inmediately after it´s melted.

A first-rate recipe; I've made it twice recently to take to friends for a dish to share. The only problem I've had is having the white chocolate melt smoothly.

I made this for a work party and everyone enjoyed it. The only problem was melting the white chocolate, a bit tricky.

This is increadable. I took it at a small gathering where everyone else brought a dessert. Mine was kept by the host, everyone else went home with they're own leftovers. Didn't try the whipped cream or the sauces. I'm sure they would be awsome with it too.

MADE THIS FOR A PARTY THAT I CATERED AND THE RESULTS AND RESPONSE WHERE ALL WONDERFUL. THE PRESENTATION WAS ALSO BEAUTIFUL. NOT TOO DIFFICULT. WILL DEFINATELY MAKE AGAIN.
