This is a nice start but shines with creative tweaking. For my first batch, I tossed chopped caramelized onions into the batter and then sprinkled smoked salt on top once out of the oven. I also made a chili-spiked honey mustard sauce for dipping. Can imagine putting anything from roasted garlic to sweated leeks to shredded root veggies into the batter before baking. If you're using a pastry bag and it has a star shaped tip, it makes for a nice presentation to dispence the batter up and down about 2 inches from top to bottom and about 3-4 inches across, with each row touching.

Very good, light and airy, sort of like making cream puffs. I used a golden belgian ale and tried to same time and effort with my cookie press (as another reviewer suggested). They didn't turn out pretty. People were reluctant to try them because of their looks, but once tasted, they were devoured. I will definitely make again, but try to work on the appearance, the pastry bag may be the way to go! Would probably even be able to just use a tablespoon. Doubled the recipe and made over three cookie sheets full, all gone with 8 people.

Soooo good. Perfect for a cold, rainy day. Recipe makes about 20 sticks though, as others have noticed.

A good basic recipe. Tasted wonderful right out of the oven. I doubled the recipe used Gruyere with a "Doggie Style Classic Pale Ale" from Flying Dog. I think it played a nice supporting role making the dough a good consistency without taking the focus away from the Gruyere flavor. I also bypassed the pastry bag and placed round teaspoon fulls of the dough on the tray instead.

Quick and easy and very yummy. I doubled the recipe, and maybe got 40 puffs-I was in a hurry and did them with a spoon instead of a pastry bag. Substituted Dubliner Cheese for Stilton as that's what I had in the house-the beer was a great addition.

Amazingly easy and really delicious! I had more Stilton than I could eat (my husband hates it) and this was the perfect way to use it up. Didn't make 40 though, more like 20.

I made these with normal beer and an ordinary blue cheese - and they were very tasty. I didn't get 40 out of the recipe though! Next time I would double the recipe (I made the full recipe, and between 2 people we ate 3/4s of them as an appetiser!!). The mix took on a sort of odd looking blue colour, but once they were cooked they looked just like the picture.

these little treats vanished immediately..wish I had made a double batch. Instead of a pastry bag, I used a cookie press with an open nozzle..I squiggled the dough onto the parchment and sprinkled 1/2 of the recipe with kosher salt. In addition, I made them about 1 1/2 inches long..and had a Honey Mustard Dippiing Sauce. It was a hit !! Next time I will sprinkle all with coarse kosher salt. And I plan to make the Bacon/Stilton/Scallion Puffs as well.

These were nothing more than cheese straws you could buy. While easy, not worth the time or money.

Very eggy, Ale disrupt the genuine stilton flavor, try to make it like regular puff dough with water.

Easy and delicious. I did not use a pastry bag; I scooped out about a tablespoon onto the parchment. Needed a little extra baking time.
