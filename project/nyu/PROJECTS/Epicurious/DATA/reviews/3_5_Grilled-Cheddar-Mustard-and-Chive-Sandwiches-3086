Really good! A nice change from basic grilled cheese. I always grill sandwiches in a pan on the stove. Instead of butter I just spray some olive oil on the bread, which works great.

These sandwiches are DELICIOUS! I cooked them like regular grilled cheese on the stovetop and it worked out very well.
