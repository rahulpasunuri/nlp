Hi I invented this dish, as far as I know and I am so glad that so many people have tried it and even better that so many liked it. Thank you all for your kind words. A technical note here, the clam juice was added by the good folks at Bon Apatite. originally it was the salmon that makes it's own juice by sweating out. Enjoy!

Very easy - also didn't bother with the clam juice (used chicken stock) but also added sliced fennel bulb to the onions and garlic - served with a side salad of shaved fennel, marinated artichokes, hearts of palm, and mixed greens with a lemon juice/champagne vinegar vinagrette.

Yeah, I really dug this! Contrary to other reviewers I didn't find it too sweet, and I'm particularly sensitive to overly sweet things since only on extremely rare occasions do we ever eat refined sugar or processed food.

I have a sweet tooth but found the onion topping too sweet & the salmon lack lustre

Yummy! A new and different preparation for salmon!! The sweetness is wonderful with the other flavors, especially the anise. (And I'm not usually a fan of sweet with savory dishes.) I substituted chicken broth for the clam juice. A tip for anyone who doesn't care for the skin. Cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil (do not oil) and place the salmon skin down. When finished baking, slide a spatula between the salmon and skin. The skin will stick to the foil, and the added bonus is easy clean up!

Simple and delicious! I made 1/2 recipe and substituted Vege stock for the clam juice (could be bothered to by a whole bottle for 1/8 cup), and it turned out fine. It was a bit on the sweet side, however. Next time I will use yellow onions, as they might make the dish slightly less sweet. The salmon would also be great without the onion (and even easier).

This ended up being a bit too sweet for me. Maybe it was the lavendar in the herbs, not sure. The fish came out perfectly though, and it was simple. I think that for those who like thinks a bit on the sweet side this would be a wonderful dish. I just found it a little unexciting.

I substituted shallots for the red onion, and Ouzo for the Pernod - because that's what I had on hand. The finished dish was very good, and preparation very easy. I'll make this again.

This is a winner. There are so many flavors to appreciate in this dish. The herbs, the garlic, the anise in the pernod. Even the onions provide a subtle sweetness when browned that infuses this dish.......not to mention the fish. For openers I had served the asparagus soup. My guests were very impressed.

I don't know what y'all eat in Bensalem, Pennslavania, but this recipe was TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!! When I came across it, I thought it would be a recipe that was going to be a real hit-or-miss. The extreme of the above 2 reviews gave me real food for thought. On a gamble I tried it... and I am delighted I took the risk! As a result of the reviews, I was also VERY LAVISH with both the Pernod and the herbes. Don't ask how much ;) I also replaced the 'herbes de Provence' with rosemary instead. WOW! It felt as though my husband and I had orgasms.... in the mouth!! ;) I also selected this recipe as it was so simple, so healthy, so convenient, and just a regular Monday evening's dinner with my husband and I on a diet! And it tastes DIVINE! This sets a new standard for recipes at epicurious.com and Bon Appétit! Mark Weatherbe, you're my hero! Merci pour ce petit trésor!

Very tasty. I ran out of Pernod (only had 4 tablespoons), so want to try it again with the full 6 tablespoons. The herbes de provence add a nice lavendar flavor to the meal.

This was "just ok". The herbes provided the only real flavor in the recipe - not that I wanted it to be strong of the Pernod. A better use of the Pernod is in the Chicken Athena recipe - which is fantastic!
