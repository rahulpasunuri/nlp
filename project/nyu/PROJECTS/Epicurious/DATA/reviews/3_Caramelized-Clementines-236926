Really tasty and not at all hard to make, especially if you prepare a few hours before and forget about it. I tried to use the full recipe on a half sized baking sheet, which kept the shards to think to really crunch properly later. Very nice flavor though, and a great way to enjoy a nice light sweetness after a meal.

I've made this twice now and it was a big hit both times. Very refreshing and a nice change from chocolate - not that there's anything wrong with chocolate!

Elegant looking. Healthful at t he end of a dinner party, however nothing exciting. Perhaps I did not get the top glaze right - I used rum, and pomegranate juice w/craisens as I could not get pomegranate seeds locally. The taste was great in a pinch. The carmelized shards looked great too
