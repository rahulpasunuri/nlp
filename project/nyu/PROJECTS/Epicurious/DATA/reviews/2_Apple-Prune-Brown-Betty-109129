This was pretty good, but I'll have to try it again. Next time I won't toast the breadcrumbs for so long, they got too dark, and I'll use butter. I couldn't believe all I had was margarine on hand when I went to look for butter! It was kind of dry, not very juicy, the cream helped.

I used golden rasins instead of prunes (whatever is in the pantry) and it was a nice, easy desert. The crumbs were an excellent taste and texture.
