A good easy frittata - nothing special, but worth making again.

I made this for father's day brunch and it was delicious. Make sure you get a dry serrano -- there were two different varieties at the store and the deli guy steered me toward the dryer of the two. I skipped the parsley as I always end up with too much in my refrigerator, it wasn't missed at all. And I added an egg because 5 seemed a little low. 6 worked well. There is garlic in the ingredients but not in the recipe; don't forget to saute it along with the onions.

This is a great brunch dish because you can prepare it the night before. I added 8 eggs instead of the 5 based on other frittatas I've made and next time will increase to 10. Guests loved it.

I've never made a frittata before and found this recipe very easy to make. In fact, much easier than making an omelete. I added mushrooms (sauted with the onions) which I thought was a nice addition. The ingredients call for garlic, however, the directions do not include garlic. I didn't use garlic and thought that it tasted great. Next time, I will try adding the garlic with the onions.

Instead of ham, I used hard salami. Quite tasty!

This recipe was delicious. I wish I could find Serrano or jabugo in Columbus, Ohio. I made this recipe with prosciutto and it turned out ok. But I am sure that this recipe made with Spanish ham would be much better. Serrano o jabugo hams are delicious!!!
