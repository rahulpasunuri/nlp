I like mine much more simple, so I only use tomatoes, 1weak old ciabatta bread, cucumber, oil, vinegar, garlic and salt. I usually eat it in the summer with roasted chicken. Lovely.

Very refreshing! I used cherry tomatoes instead. I omitted the peppers. I added a bit of aged balsamic vinegar. Tasted great!

Wonderful summer recipe! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I omitted the thyme. I broiled my red pepper, cooled it in a ziplock bag, then peeled the skin off. I agree that the pepperoni isn't necessary, and I think a little more cheese would be good. Will definitely make this again and again!

delish! i also omitted the fresh thyme and turkey pepperoni and added a few slices of fried pancetta.

I made this exactly as described and used heirloom tomatoes. One word of warning, it makes considerably more than 4 servings - more like 8-10! I served with some steaks for a dinner party and it was definitely a hit - provided an alternative to heavier dishes. I will make it again, however I might cut back on the thyme a little and I'm not sure that the turkey pepperoni really added much.
