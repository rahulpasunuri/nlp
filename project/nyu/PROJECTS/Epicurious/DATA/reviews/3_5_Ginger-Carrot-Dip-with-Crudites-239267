terrific!! I used 1/2 the mayo and it was fine.

I thought this recipe tasted great! Like other reviewers I think it tastes very much like the dressing you get on salads at Japanese restaurants. In fact, I'll probably only use this as a dressing, not a dip. I might add more scallions next time & not purée as long for a more rustic texture.

this dip reminded me of the dressing that comes on salads at Japanese restaurants. i love that stuff, and always wish i could eat it by the spoonful. this flavorful dip was basically just that! super good and easy.

This was so delicious! However, dipping vegies into vegie dip was not satisfying enough. I would serve this with bread pieces next time. Perhaps cheesy bread?

I'm glad that I didn't believe the negative comments about this dip. It is great. I made it for Easter and everyone loved it. The only thing I did different was to use a food processor instead of blender. The texture was perfect and all that ginger really woke up our taste buds.

I'd also give it a 2 forks rating. The taste is excellent but the texture is a little too runny. Water content from the carrots keeps seeping out into the mix and gives it a not-so-great appearance and consistency. I've tried adding mayo, evn cream cheese to thicken the base but to no avail. I'll eat it and it still tastes very nice but I wouldn't make it for company...

maybe it was my carrots, but I did not think this had much flavor. The kids would not touch it. No compulsive dipping here.

Used this recipe for an event this past weekend hosted in my home. It was a nice change from the usual creamy dips and the guests liked the ginger flavor a lot. I had all the ingredients on hand except that my rice vinegar was not seasoned so I added a couple of small cloves of garlic loved the enhancement, not overpowering. Can't wait to serve it again. Very simple and quick to make. Enjoy
