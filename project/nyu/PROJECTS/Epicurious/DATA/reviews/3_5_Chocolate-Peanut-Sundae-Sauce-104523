Well let me tell you, this sauce is excellent. As a true lover of both peanut butter and chocolate, it was most definitely to die for. Even my crazy mother in law, who is this huge health freak and constantly dieting, had three bowls of ice cream! Make it is all i have to say to all you cooks! I'm on my way to make some more RIGHT now!!! hahahha
