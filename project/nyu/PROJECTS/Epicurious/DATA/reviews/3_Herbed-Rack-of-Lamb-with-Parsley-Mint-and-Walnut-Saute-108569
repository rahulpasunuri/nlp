First and foremost...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THE PARSLEY MINT AND WALNUT SAUCE. I halved the parsley and it still tasted just like parsley...yuck!! (that is why 3 forks, lamb by itself 5 forks!) The lamb in the recipe is incredible!!! I foloowed the recipe, but instead of frying and baking the lamb I grilled it. 5 minutes over hot coals and then indirect for another 10-15 mins and you have a cnnot miss med-med rare rack of lamb. I have made several times and get raves each time!! It is a simple recipe and worth adding to your box!!!
