A really good, refreshing dessert or just snack. I thought the bright orange flavor really came through. I must admit, I used full fat yogurt because that's all I had but I will probably try it again with nonfat because a nonfat dessert is something a girl always looks for! (I didn't make the sauce but I didn't think it was missing anything)

Surprisingly rich tasting though no fat. Excellent way to use up left-over yogurt and Thanksgiving cranberry sauce.

I didn't make this recipe but was just clicking through the panna cotta recipes looking for a good one. I have lived in many countries and tried many kinds of yoghurts. Some plain yoghurts can be watery, some firm, some sour, some awfully sweet. Your success will obviously depend on which yoghurt you use. I think that the best yoghurt to use should be a somewhat firm, non sour one which resembles cream for best results. Good Luck if you decide to try this.

Blehck... Rubbery, sour, and bitter (misjudged my orange rind content), and to top it off, the cranberries were too much tartness. Will try the real panna cotta in the future.

This was nothing like the "real" thing. It was sour and didn't have the wonderful consistency of the cooked variety.

This is delicious. I make it the night before to serve for breakfast in the summer.

Made this for a dinner party (one of the guests is lactose-intolerant)...it is very light and refreshing...plan on making it again tonight.

I used this light and tasty dessert to end a rather heavy Italian dinner, and it was a great contrast. Even my pastry chef friend loved it. It's not the real thing, but it definitely holds its own. Don't skip the sauce--at least not the first time you try it.
