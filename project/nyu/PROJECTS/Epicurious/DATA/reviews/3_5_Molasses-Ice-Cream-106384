not bad, a little too sweet for me. next time i'll cut the sugar a little. i added some minced and ground ginger with the molasses; very good.

Absolutely delicious and creamy, and easy to boot. The lone negative reviewer must not like molasses...

Very simple with excellant results. Very rich flavor. I topped with sliced bananas, pecans and whipped cream. just that something suprising and different to end a great meal!

We've made four ice creams in two weeks and this is a definite keeper -- tied for first place with lemon buttermilk sorbet from this site (though made with lime not lemon). It is scrumptious with molasses sugar cookies and both an elegant and homey dessert. If you like molasses, you'll love this.

Can't believe how gourmet this tastes with only 4 ingredients! If you like molasses cookies, you'll love this. I'll make it over and over again. Also try using maple syrup (not "real" as it's too thin) and adding toasted or candied walnuts after it's blended.

Gross. Tastes like eating a bowl of molasses flavored cream cheese. Yuck.
