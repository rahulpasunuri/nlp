Wow, what a pleasant surprise! This recipe was very good. I have never made (or wanted to make) a dish that included anchovy's. No one knew they were in this dish. It is salty and high in flavor, so make sure you pair it appropriately. DON'T NOT MAKE THIS BECAUSE OF THE ANCHOVY'S!!!

Excellent--we don't like anchovies so we left them out. This makes a very impressive first course.

This was a wonderful recipe! It was very flavorful. We added onion to the tomato mixture and used a mixture of Munster and Feta cheese to give it a different taste. We were in a hurry, so we put the peppers in the microwave for 3 or 4 minutes first, then cooked it in the oven for 20 min. or so.
