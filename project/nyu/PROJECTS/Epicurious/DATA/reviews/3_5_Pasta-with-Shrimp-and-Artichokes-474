Used canned artichoke hearts & added some sundried tomatoes, but other than that, followed exactly. An excellent dinner party dish. Did the sauce the day before so had time with guests. Served with Greek Italian Chopped Salad on this site and got raves for both. The seasonings are perfect.

Made this exactly as the recipe states. It was wonderful - not a morsel left over. We'll make this one again, for sure

delicious and versatile dish. I've used both marinated and unmarinated artichoke hearts to good effect. A great go-to recipe after a long day.

Great basic recipe that can be altered in a million ways. This was the second time I made this dish, but this time I didn't really adhere to the recipe. I didn't have stewed tomoatoes but used a 28oz can of plum tom's instead. And instead of using so much Parm for saltiness, I added some chicken stock and cooking wine. Good Stuff!

My fiance had a similar dish last night at an Italian restaurant and asked me to make something like it. I followed the recipe very closely except that I used a jar of Trader Joe's artichokes and a touch more lemon. I also mistakenly added the 1/2 cup of cheese to the dish before I served it which suited my salt loving tastes just fine. Next time I'll add a bit more basil, a touch of thyme, and I think I'll use a penne instead. I'd give this recipe a 3.5 if I could b/c I reserve 4's for the absolute best.

My sister and I had fun with this ... instead of the tomatoes and oregano, we used feta cheese and kalamata olives, and the marinated artichokes. Also, used large, uncooked shrimp which, even when cut into three's, provided good-sized flavorful pieces. Great with linguini. Definitely a hit!

This was easy and tasty but I made a significant substitution -- I used marinated artichokes because I didn't have frozen or even canned ones. They definitely added a strong flavor but it was very good - I will make it this way again. Might even add sliced black olives next time.

This was really simple to make and it tasted delicious. The sauce is quite thick, but once you add the pasta and mix everything together, it's a good amount to cover the pasta. I added a little olive oil at the end after I put in the pasta so that it wouldn't be too dry. Overall, great dish. I would definitely do this again.

This was very good, even though I didn't have the basil. The time spent cooking the frozen artichokes infused their essence into the sauce nicely. I thought it could benefit from a touch of sun-dried tomatoes, as I was out of fresh, and I like the layering of tastes that comes from different types of tomato. I did add a little extra olive oil to carry the flavors. Easy, fresh tasting, definitely will make it again. Next time I'll add some fresh fennel with the onion and garlic, I can see that really working too.

Wonderful easy supper. I made a few changes based upon the season and the previous reviews. I halved the recipe and used one 14.5 can plain diced tomatoes instead of the stewed and fresh tomatoes (it is February) and used canned instead of frozen artichokes. We've decided to add a can of artichoke hearts to our staples so we can make this recipe anytime.

This is good recipe, although a little cutting back on the onion improves it. With all do regard to taraevans of Columbus OH, Please don't rate a recipe 4 forks when you have made something completely different. It distorts the ratings. Your recipe sounds wonderful, but you did more than substitute.

Simple and delicious. This is a great pasta recipe because it is one of the few that is not tomato based (not really) and not cream based, yet the sauce is saucy and the pasta is not dry at all. I made this just as it says only adding more garlic and more pepper flakes. Will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe, however I did tweak it a bit. First, instead of artichokes, I used capers (since I had them on hand). I also increased the amount of red pepper flakes to a full teaspoon for more heat. I also didn't use the can of stewed tomatoes at all and just diced 4 small plum tomatoes and used them. I did this because I didn't want a tomato sauce - I just wanted a light, flavorful coating for my spaghetti noodles that would compliment the shrimp. I added a little extra olive oil to my "sauce" and instead of cooking the shrimp in the sauce, I sauted them in a seperate pan with a little olive oil, garlic powder, and fresh ground salt and pepper. I finished by tossing the "sauce", shrimp and pasta all together to heat through, then grated some fresh Asiago cheese on top. It was excellent and had just the right amount of tang and heat. I'll definetly make this again for an easy and quick dinner.

I made this last night for dinner. It was great. Following some of the other reviewers, I used Italian Stewed Tomatoes, upped the amount of garlic and spices, used bottled atichokes packed in water, and increased the amount of artichokes by half, and used canned diced tomatoes, drainned and used large prawns - it was fantastic. This is a real keeper.

Excellent dish for a quick dinner. I added some extra spice and altered a few ingredients and it came out fabulous. Highly recommend.

This is a good, basic recipe. The sauce was rather bland, so I added more basil and some red wine to give it more flavor. I used the frozen artichokes which didn't seem to add much flavor.

This was a fantastic dish! I used Wheat fettucine to add some different and hearty texture. This is also good the next day.

this is a really delicious dish that's easy, light, and inexpensive to make. i used more garlic just because i love garlic. i also added shallots, a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme, and frozen peas just because i had them on hand. i'll probably experiment more with this in the future, perhaps by adding more seafood like calamari, mussels, clams, lobster meat, etc. i think it's a sin to use cheese on a seafood dish so i left it out, but my boyfriend loaded it on and loved every bite!

Needed a quick dinner recipe and this worked brilliantly! Used canned artichoke hearts that were quartered (plus i cut the quarters in half). Also used frozen homemade tomato sauce and just augmented it with a small can of diced tomatoes (for the chunky component) and adjusted seasonings. My husband and I loved it... total winner!

YES!!! This dish is such an interesting alternative to "Red Italian" pastas. It was a big hit with us. We are doing a bit of low-carb, so we used half spaghetti squash and half the amount of spaghetti; and it was wonderful. The frozen artichokes are great in this dish, and the shimps make a good low-calorie protein.

First time to try this dish - we were bored and looking for something interesting.. this was definitely it! Like other reviewers, we used tinned artichokes, but that was the only change. This is something we would be pleased to serve our friends!

I added extra garlic and used chicken this time. Also only used 1 tomato because that was all I had! I gave this 3 forks because it is good and so easy to fix! For an extra easy version of this I buy Near East brand angel hair spicy tomato pasta mix and follow their recipe for artichoke chicken sauce. But homeade is always better!

Excellent. Did increase the basil to 1/2 cup and garlic. Served with linguine. Everyone loved it and said the recipe was a keeper.

Very tasty, I'm eating the leftovers for lunch right now and my co-workers are asking me what smells so good. I doubled the garlic (I used a garlic press)and I used canned artichokes (drained) and I added them during the last 10 minutes. I used the full amount of tomatoes and I didn't find that it turned into a 'tomato' dish. It was great.

Rating: 3
Delicious and easy/quick dinner. Good flavors; but would probably add more basil next time. Instead of adding another can of tomatoes (I didn't want to overpower the dish with a tomato flavor), I reserved some of the pasta water to loosen up the sauce a bit.

I will add this to my list of "Regulars" I'm going to try it with chicken or maybe even as a topping to Salmon.

This is a great recipe. Unlike some others, I would not change the recipe. I used canned artichokes (non-marinated) instead of frozen. Other than that, I made the recipe verbatim. (Canned artichokes need less cooking than frozen so I added them at 15 minutes rather than 30). I won't disagree with the four fork ratings.. its just a resrve the four forks for the top end cream of the crop. I would distinctly not add the second can of tomatoes as some have suggested. The tomatoes are an accent flavor to the predominate flavor of shrimp and artichoke. It is not a tomato sauce with shrimp and artichoke. Basil is a predominate flavor in this dish... do try to use fresh basic rather than dried. Jim

My husband rated this recipe as "great"! I too added 2x the garlic and used Italian stewed tomatos. The only change I would make it to add more juice. It was a tad bit dry. I think I would add white winn, or get a second can of the stewed tomatos and just use the juice. We will be making this one for a long time to come!!!!

nice flavors, but do not use small shrimp. i think that the sauce would have been really good without the shrimp, actually. and i think it calls for too much pasta.

Absolutely wonderful!! My husband and I made this together last night and we will definitely make it for company. It was so good we took some to the neighbors to try - along with a copy of the recipe.

I have made this many times for guests and always get rave reviews! I use more garlic (at least double what the recipe calls for), add another can of tomatoes, and use Chinese Chili Paste instead of the red peppers. Three of my friends have asked for the recipe and have been happy serving it for guests. It's great to make ahead the day before (except for the shrimp). This helps to marinade the flavors, and is very quick at dinner time.

Another winner! Used this recipe for dinner last week. I used the Italian Stewed tomatoes as reccomended by one reviewer and added freshly grated parmesan cheese when serving. My husband prefers pasta other than spaghetti, so I used small shells. Great!

This recipe is good, but lacks flavor. I did triple the garlic as one reader suggested. Next time I might add some wine to try and coax out some of the flavor of the ingredients.

Fantastic. This was so easy to prepare and it really impressed a friend who used to think her cooking was unparalled! I tripled the garlic and added red wine and a little balsamic which helped a lot. I'd order this in a restaurant...my test of quality when cooking at home!

This is delicious and SIMPLE. I made it for a group of so-so fish eaters and they loved it! Make sure you use stewed, not diced tomatoes. I also used italian flavored which added a little more zip.
