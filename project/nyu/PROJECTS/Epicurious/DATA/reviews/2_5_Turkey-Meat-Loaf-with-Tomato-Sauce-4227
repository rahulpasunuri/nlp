I had to make the gluten and dairy free version of this recipe since we have food allergies in my house. So i replaced the eggs with flax seed eggs and omitted the cottage cheese. I thought it was very good, very easy but it did fall apart a little, which could have been due to the missing cottage cheese.

I applied the Cook from Westchester's suggestions, and the recipe turned out great. Very tasty, very moist, and it hung together just fine. In fact, it didn't even need the tomato sauce poured over it. Next time, I might try less than 1/2 cup cheese, so it's a little healthier.

With a few minor tweaks, this recipe is fabulous. First, a whole jar of tomato sauce is far too much... the second time I made it, I added only 1/2 to 1 cup of sauce. Instead of 3 eggs, I only added one, and instead of cottage cheese (which made it too soupy) I used 1/2 cup grated cheese. I also threw in a TB of worcestershire, and a TB of dijon mustard. It was excellent with those adjustments!

I substituted ground chicken for the turkey, and I wasn't too impressed with the results. It really didn't have such a great taste, and i didn't like how it looked.

It was good, but a little too moist. The meatloaf had too loose of a consistency. It was better the 2nd day as leftovers.

It was all okay until the rice got thrown in. I think that pushed the texture envelope a little too far.
