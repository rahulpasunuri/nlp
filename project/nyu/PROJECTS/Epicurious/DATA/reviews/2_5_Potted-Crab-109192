This was just not a terrific recipe. I think a spicy tomato aspic loaded with crab is a better idea.

I have made Potted Crab for the last 3 St. Patrick's Day dinners at my house. Always a crowd pleaser. It's important to use the best/freshest ingredients but worth the time and effort and expense. Very under rated here.

Way too "crab" tasting - we had to add horseradish and some dressing to give it more depth. Was embarassed when presenting it to company.

Bothe the potted crab and the soda bread froze beautifully. Original: 3/14/04 This is very good. Except for shelling the king crab, it is easy to prepare. It makes a huge amount (for two people) and is very rich. But it goes a long way, which is good as crab is very expensive here. I filled two one-cup ramekins and froze one for the future. It is delicious on the Irish brown bread from the same Irish menu in the March Gourmet.
