This recipe is the bomb! It's awesome (and I'm not even that crazy about corn - hubby is). I got the milk from the cobs and then boiled the cobs for a couple of minutes in the hot water before boiling the corn. Scraped the cobs again in the water and discarded them. Followed recipe as indicated otherwise. Immersion blender much easier than regular blender. Omitted the chives (because of hubby). Will make again, and again, and again! May even try roasted and skinned chopped poblano peppers. This recipes could easily be transformed into an awesome corn soup.

This was easily the BEST creamed corn I have ever eaten! I used milk instead of cream and didn't loose any of the taste. I also served it with the Fried Green Tomato "BLT" recipe and WOW!!! You must must try these two beauties together! (...but only if corn is in season)

It turned out SO delicious!! Used the corn on cobs left over from July 4th dinner. Instead of heavy cream I used a mix of 1/2 & 1/2, plain yogurt, and sour cream. Will make it again. Does anyone know if it freezes well? Might as well make some for the winter while the corn is fresh and plentiful in August! :-)

I followed the recipe exactly and loved it! I normally don't like corn, but this was delicious. Creamy with a nice sweetness to it. Perfect for a summer bbq!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and ended up with something more like corn chowder than creamed corn. The dish tastes great - it's just got way too much liquid. I used fresh-from-the-fields corn so maybe it has more liquid? I'm thinking about adding bacon and serving it as chowder.

This was delicious. I used whole milk rather than cream, which was just right. This would also be a great addition to other dishes. I used the leftovers in a southwestern style layered casserole, which turned out perfectly.

This is the first time I've made creamed corn and I loved this recipe! Very, very easy, and you can definitely personalize it by pureeing as much (or as little) as you want. Next time I'll try it with milk to make it a bit healthier, but the cream was pretty luxurious tasting!

I skipped the puree step and thought that the recipe was just fine. It was creamy but the corn was still slightly crunchy, just the way I like it. I think that the most crucial part of this recipe is to get good, fresh corn.

I used skim milk in place of the cream, and it was still very creamy and satisfying.
