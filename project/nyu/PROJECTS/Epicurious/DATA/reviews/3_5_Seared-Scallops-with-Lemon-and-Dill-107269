Outstanding -- and incredibly easy and fast! I will absolutely make this again. It would be a great meal for entertaining because it comes together SO quickly. I didn't have any white wine, so used chicken stock. Served it with cous cous (the toasted pine nuts make all the difference) -- I stirred some of the sauce into the cous cous before serving. I put a layer of arugula between the couscous and scallops, and the earthy flavor was a great match with the pine nuts, sauce, the whole thing. YUM.

I am not a big fan of dill, except in soups, baked chicken, and oven roasted potatoes. So I thought I'd try something new! This recipe turned out wonderful, and very flavorful! I used onion, for lack of shallots, added chopped mushrooms, and added a bit of homemade chicken stock. simmered for a bit to reduce. Awesome! I would make it again. I used the Trader Joes Japanese Scallops...very good flavor. I paired this with steamed broccoli.

Fairly simple and tasted great. I used a Sauv. Blanc for the wine and dinner. Paired it as suggested with green bean, but used quinoa in place of couscous.

Way too much dill flavor No one liked it at all.

For health reasons, my wife cannot eat anything cooked in better or fat, so I substituted chicken stock, white wine and a few chanterelles. I browned the scallops in a seasoned cast iron pan. The result was excellent. 4 forks!

I made this recipe exactly as written and really loved it. I am a big fan of shallots, but I was a bit dubious of the pairing of them with dill (not my favorite). But I knew when my husband said it smelled like a restaurant upon entering our kitchen that this was going to be good. And it was. Unique, but it worked. We served it over plain cous-cous to enjoy more of the yummy sauce. A definite keeper and a unique way to prepare scallops.

Have made this dish numerous times - each time better than the other. Key ingredient - the scallops - use Stonington Scallops and you can't go wrong.

My sauce turned out a little dark and heavy. Next time will try making the sauce in a separate pan with garlic and more lemon. Definitely worth the attempt.

The reviews seem to run the gamut, from yuck to great. We liked it and will be happy eat it another day. Served it with pecan cous-cous and some lovely fresh asparagus. I did cut down on the butter in the sauce by just a bit.

I have made this dish several time to rave reviews. I find that the acidity is off set by the richness of the real butter and the white wine adds a touch of elegance to the dish. The fresh dill and lemon are a must. Easy and absolutely yummy!!

I added some cream to the sauce to take the edge off the acidity a little. It was fantastic. I served it with scallops and sea bass.

This is an amazing dish! It is so easy and tastes so gourmet! I would definetly add some garlic to it though.

Made this one night on the spur of the moment since I had all the ingredients on hand and my spouse loved it and asked me to make it again. Made it the following week and it is still one of his favorites.

My husband bought some scallops & black tiger prawns to make for Valentine's Dinner and I gave him this recipe to use based on the simple ingredients and rave reviews. We didn't have all the ingredients on hand so we used mirin (sweet rice wine) instead of white wine, scallions instead of shallots, dried dill and lemon concentrate. The outcome was this slightly sweet sauce, but still really delicious. Made a wonderful dinner that we'd make again!

When I made this my roommate asked me to marry him and make him scallops every day. :o) Absolutely delicious, tart and savory. So easy to make yet tastes so gourmet.

Yummy and easy. The market was out of shallots, so I used onion and garlic instead. Would make again and serve with steamed zucchini.

This was an easy recipe that has great flavor. It was quick to make, which is always a plus. It makes lots of extra sause, so serve with some warm crusty bread.

Please note I'm giving 4 forks to the revised recipe, which I took from other cooks; that is, I substituted garlic + onion for the shallots and green onions for the dill. Served with a Greek salad. Really wonderful!

I did not have any dill so I substitued a tablespoon of chives. This dish was so easy and delicious. It made a great presentation with some lemon and chives for garnish. I would proudly serve it to visiting dignitaries

I forgot to pick up dill but used garlic instead. It was by far one of the best recipes I've found on this site.. or any site for that matter. It was incredibly delicious. The scallops were wonderful served on top of a bed of couscous and a small side of fresh green beans with rosemary. YUM!

Very easy to make and great flavor. My husband even wanted me to make it for a dinner party we were having the next night. So simply you can make it evenafter working a long day.

I didn't really care for this combination of flavors, would try something different with scallops next time.

This is excellent. I live 25 miles from the grocery tore, so I'd bought the scallops and some shrimp too before I searched for a recipe for them. So I ended up substituting some minced sweet onion and garlic for the shallots, and added the shrimp to the mix; I also used dried dill, not a problem. Served it with pine nut couscous and a baby greens, black grape and gorgonzola salad. I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

I made this recipe as part of a Italian Christmas Eve Dinner even though it was not a traditional Italian recipe. My family just loved the scallops and so did I. It is quick and easy and the sauce is just the very best. Definitely a keeper!

I thought this dish was okay but not spectacular. Normally I would not make it again however my boyfriend absolutely loved it and definitely wants me to make it again-one of his favourites. He normally doesn't comment and just eats everything. I found it too bland and not enough sauce. Also an expensive dish to make.

This was good but not great. There are other similar scallop recipes that seem to taste superior to this.

I had never had sauteed scallops before. These were absolutely delightful and the sauce was a perfect accompaniment to the green beans I served with it. Would make a perfect meal for company.

I made this recipe without butter and served it over angelhair pasta. Delicious and good for you!

My husband loved this meal and rated it 4 forks, however I did not care much for the dill with scallops, therefore we split the difference and gave it 3 forks. I did not use a non-stick pan but it deglazed nicely with the wine. Also, I used 1 tsp. dried dill instead of fresh. At my DH's request I will be making this again.

Excellent. I used lime juice and rind because I had no lemon, and the lime was very good. Ain't shallots wonderful!! Couscous with this is great; I used a chicken soup base with rosemary to prepare the couscous.

Rating: 2
The shallots need to be cooked way more than just a minute - next time I'd cook them until they brown a bit (and certainly would sub for onions if I didn't have shallots). I'll also consider adding fresh garlic next time. But...how can you go wrong with fresh scallops? (I also added a handful of shrimp!)

We enjoyed the dish very much. The presentation of the scallops with the couscous is very attractive. Our wine of choice was a sauvignon blanc which complimented the meal quite nicely.

I didn't have much luck with this recipe. The dill-lemon combination didn't do much to enhance the flavor of the scallops, in my opinion. I think there are some better scallop recipes on this site.

We love this dish. I cook the scallops longer than the recipe says, but it is an easy and quick recipe.

So simple of a recipe and great to do after a work day. We enjoyed it very much. Couscous was also a great compliment.

This was a mundane recipe and did nothing to compliment the scallops. I can't explain the rave reviews because this is a really bland and basic recipe. I also had friends that made it and said the same. It's not even worth the price of the ingredients...

Very good. If doubling the recipe, cook the scallops in two batches and on high heat. You want the outsides well seared. Try serving it with the Zuchinni and Bell Pepper Confetti (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=14400). The sauce really complements the vegetables.

This dish is lovely for a cozy dinner for two or the highlight of a dinner party for a crowd. The sauce is equally delicious on seared fish or sauted shrimp!

Wonderful, wonderful recipe! Quick and easy to prepare, bursting with flavour. The sauce is very tasty, but subtle, and a great complement for the delicate scallops. A real treat and sure to become a frequent favourite either as an entree or appetizer course. One of the best scallop dishes I have ever made or been served anywhere!

This was an absolutely amazing recipe... one that I will repeat time and time again. So easy and simple, yet appears very elegant and is full of taste. I would not only make this on a weeknight for my husband and I, but I would have no problems serving this to guests for a special occasion!!
