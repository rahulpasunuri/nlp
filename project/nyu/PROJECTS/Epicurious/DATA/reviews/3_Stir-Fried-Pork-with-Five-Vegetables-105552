Bland, flavouring has no punch. Thicker richer sauce is needed.

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. I was attracted to it by a previous review that noted how versatile it was, making it a good dish to clean out your fridge with. Given what I had on hand I made the following adjustments. I about doubled the ratio of meat to veggie as I had a whole tenderloin I needed to get cooked, and only so many veggies. For the veggies I used carrots, green beans, red pepper and cauliflower. I also added in some yellow onions with the garlic. I doubled the crushed red pepper to give it more flavor and I don't think it needed quite that much. It's quite tasty. Definitely a strong orange flavor, but it's a good flavor assuming one likes oranges.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night and it was good! I did not have crookneck squash so I substituted zucchini instead. I also took the advice of A Cook from Victoria and I doubled the amount of dried crushed red pepper. The next time I make it however I will follow the suggestions of others and double the sauce - there simply wasn't enough as is. I would also add lots more ginger and I will try adding a little kosher salt at the end.

So good! Love the orange flavor. And the shredded carrots give a really nice texture to the dish.

We liked it a lot - tastes like it could have come from a Chinese restaurant - but I know what's in it! Simple, but yummy.

Very fresh, very attractive, VERY orangey! Be warned: this has an overpowering orange flavor. Not exactly my cup of tea.

Not caring for citrus-flavored dishes, I skipped the orange peel and just used the juice. (Worked fine) It's one of those flexible recipes that you can put in whatever you have and it comes out great. I had asparagus, not squash, and used leftover pork (from the slow-cooked Hoison recipe) and it was very nice.

really good, I used to make this years ago and lost it and am glad to have it back. I use double the dried red chilis and double the sauce and used squash (nice touch) bok choy celery yellor pepper califlower. It is the sauce that makes this use any veggie I did not use the pork I had chinese bar b qued pork on the side

This is very tasty and healthy! I highly recommend using fresh orange juice (you have the oranges anyway for the peel), it really gives this a lot of flavor and freshness. Also, add some kosher salt when it is all in the pan together, it helps bring out the sweetness of the orange juice and honey. I also added a zucchini, so this was just chock-full of vegetables. Next time, I think I'll add some cashews!

Nice recipe but I felt I had to spice it up a bit, so I added some ginger, garlic and soy sauce to the orange mixture. I used a butternut squash instead of the crookneck, which gave it a sweet and creamy touch. I also started preparing the vegetables by stir-frying some sliced red onion. Make sure the pork is sufficiently browned so as to ensure a crunchy bite.

I thought this dish was colorful, tasty and very easy to prepare! This was my first experience with ginger, and I think I will use a little less next time. My dinner guests (who prefer eating healthy dishes) loved it and both asked for the recipe! I had no brown rice on hand, so used white rice, which I think made the dish less interesting.

Great melding of flavors. Pre-cooking the vegetables really helps to keep them all at a perfect degree of crispness. The brown rice adds a nice touch. After adding the liquid, I still felt it needed more. I added a little white wine. Really good.

I'm sure this is a healthy recipe but it was a little short on flavor inspite of the great sounding sauce ingredients. IF I made this again I would make more sauce and add more red pepper flakes.
