i was hoping that roasting would do to broccoli what it does to asparagus but was disappointed. this came out ok--the hubby loved it-- but i found it a bit boring. i wanted to do something different with broccoli but will keep looking.

Yummy! I used a small crown of broccoli and doubled the garlic (I LOVE garlic). Used just a tiny bit of olive oil plus S&P and roasted it in a large cast iron skillet for 10 minutes then added the garlic/red pepper mixture. Roasted for 5 more minutes (make sure you shake the pan occasionally) then showered a bit a good parmesan cheese over. Really good!

Incredible how just a few ingredients sometimes makes the best dishes. This was incredibly good. Total cooking time was a couple minutes too long for my personal preference, so shave a couple minutes off the total roasting time if you like your broccoli a bit on the crunchier side. Loved the flavor!

A great way to cook broccoli that frees up the range for the main dish! Love the caramelization that happens while keeping a crunch. 15 minutes was plenty of time. may up the pepper and garlic next time for more flavor.

Very good. I added a bit of lemon to the mix. I also had much less than 1 lb, so I only did 15 min. Very good and easy. And healthy.

So flavorful! I added fingerling potatoes, onions, parsnips and larger garlic slices to the roasting pan, and upped the amount of red pepper. This was a fantastic side companion for my first attempt at Roast Chicken (just also reviewed). You can see photos of the finished products on my Instagram @sarahgianetto =)

Love this. I often add cauliflower, baby bella mushrooms and a generous sprinkle of garlic powder, then pop it in the oven for 20 mins. So good with steamed rice.

I rated this "exceptional" not for complexity but for a delicious, easy, new (to me) way to prepare broccoli. I incorporated another reviewer's suggestion and tossed everything together at the get-go (and also added some matchstick red bell pepper I had laying around)and roasted at 400 degrees convection. 3 of us ate it all. I can easily see subbing other veggies. I also like another reviewer's idea of adding chickpeas - I'll try that another time!

H-m-m I must be missing something. I thought this was okay -- nothing great - I would make it again, but it won't replace steaming broccoli with some garlic and then served with drizzle of olive oil and sea salt.

This is my favorite way to do Broccoli ! I turn on my convection oven to 400' then all ingredients into a bowl and toss with my hands. Then onto a cookie sheet and roast for 25 min. Just Delish ! Sometimes I add Culiflower, Mushrooms, Big Chopped Pieces of Onions, Red Pepper and Green Beans then just add a little more oil. Then when done (the edges of the veggies are a tinge brown) I salt and pepper a little. Sometimes this alone is dinner :) So Good and So Non Fattening :) We have this almost every night and the whole family is losing that "Extra Poundage" we all hate... Hahahaha... I'm not kidding :)

Great! Super duper easy, and roasting rather than steaming or microwaving really does give it a nice crunchy texture. Still a fairly normal broccoli recipe and not gonna taste magical or anything, but it's a good straightforward easy broccoli recipe.

I live in Thailand and don't have an oven except for a toaster oven outside on the balcony. WHOOOAAAA this recipe was splendid. I used roasted and skinned red pepper with garlic(diced). Made enough to feed the entire galaxy and my husband and I inhaled the whole sheebang. Delicious.

This item is a hit at Black Bottle. Everyone raves about it. I knew there was a little trick to this dish so I'm glad I found the actual recipe.It turned out great except I think I need to space the broccoli out a little more next time so it dry roasts a little better. So good!

Outstanding! I'm a finance and engineering guy who has trouble cooking a frozen pizza. However, after selecting this recipe based on (1) Minimal ingredients; (2) Minimal and quick, easy steps; and (3) Minimal cost, this turned out GREAT! Everyone loved it, including my Italian wife and 8 year old daughter. Strongly recommended.

I feel less like i'm reviewing this recipe and more like i'm reviewing roasted broccoli. It's awesome and i can't believe i never prepared it this way until recently. As far as this recipe goes, can you really even call a recipe? I'm pretty sure they just added the red pepper to feel better about calling this a recipe. it's really unnecessary. And for the other reviewers who seem to be confused by it or had a problem with it: Seriously? just mix everything together and put it in the oven until it's cooked

Nothing in the fridge tonight except 3 bags of broccoli I'd been avoiding. This turned out super tasty; definitely more than the sum of its parts. Great quick alternative to steamed broccoli. I cooked at 425 for 15 minutes total.

Rating: 1
Didn't really turn out well. The oil/garlic/red pepper mixture couldn't be 'drizzled,' since it had only 1/2 tablespoon of oil. Maybe blending it would help, as others mention. Even after roasting, the broccoli didn't have much taste.

Meh. I don't know if I did this wrong or what, but it tasted like normal broccoli to me. Next time I'll make sure to put more olive oil in the pepper/garlic sauce!

I toss in a couple of handfuls of garbanzo beans for some protein. The kids eat this up and ask for more! I roast at 425ºF because my oven runs pretty hot.

Great side dish. Easy to prepare too. A 450 degree oven is a little hot, but makes for a nice crispy bite ... just make sure to toss a few times during roasting.

Rating: 4
I throw the garlic, oil and red pepper in my mini-blender and then toss it with the broccoli before I put it in the oven the first time - roasting and then tossing and then roasting seems totally unnecessary. I think 450* is a little too hot and the time is a little long, depending on the broccoli and which oven I am using. But either way - definitely four stars.

Had it with New Year's dinner of pork & sauerkraut 1/1/2010. Was looking for something simple and tasty to make with broccoli and this was it! Everyone loved it! Followed the advice from some reviewers and sliced the garlic instead of crushing it. Will definitely make again.

Excellent. The only way I've gotten my husband to eat broccoli and say that it was good. My kids (5, 4, 1) also loved it. Super easy, not greasy at all as a previous reviewer mentioned, and crowd-pleasing. Can't go wrong!

Rating: 4
Yummy! This was really good! I skipped the red pepper and added some sea salt and black pepper. It didn't need as long to cook as the recipe said, but I had read the reviews ahead of time and was watching to make sure it didn't get overdone.

This is so easy and so delicious. I make it quite often for a side dish when we're eating asian meats/rice/noodles. I slice the garlic rather than mincing because then it comes out nicer and not as burnt. My boyfriend used to hate broccoli before this recipe came along. Highly recommend!

I made this exactly as described. My broccoli wasn't cooked, it was tough. Plus, it was swimming in oil. It tasted just awful. Down the disposal for this one. If there is a next time, I will parboil the broccoli and then roast it in a small bit of olive oil and kosher salt. This recipe was not for us!

This is ok but not terribly different than saute/stir fry treatment w/garlic - would highly recommend trying Rachel Ray's indian-spiced cauliflower - curry/coriander seasoning - roast in oven as well.

This recipe was absolutely outstanding. I did reduce the cooking time substantially as advised by others, and the broccoli was cooked perfectly. Also, I ate at the Black Bottle restaurant recently - one of the best meals I've ever had.

I've always felt my oven was not as hot as the thermometer reads. I cooked the broccoli exactly as the recipe suggested and it came out perfect!. I buy large bags of broccoli flourets at Costco (cheap) and this could have consumed the whole bag.

Great! Neither my husband nor I are really broccoli fans. It's not bad but it just doesn't have any character to it. This recipe makes it something else though. The roasting brings out a slightly nutty flavor that plays so well with the roasted garlic (who doesn't love roasted garlic?) and the kick from the red pepper. I found that with my oven I did not have to roast the broccoli for the entire recommended times. Instead of the initial 15 minutes, I roasted for 10 which was more than sufficient. For the second bout, I roasted the mix for 5 minutes. Take your oven's heating capabilities into consideration when making this dish. No one wants desiccated broccoli.

This was a great variation from all the tried and true steamed, sauteed, etc. preparations. I want to like broccoli, and in spirit I do, but I find the variations in ways to prepare it to be limiting -- it always tastes pretty much like broccoli. This was a change, and we enjoyed it very much.

This recipe was so easy to prepare and so tasty. I liked it much better than steamed broccoli -- which I always wanted to cover up with cheese sauce. We all agreed that we needed to make more the next time we prepared it. We could have all eaten more! (It shrinks a little when it cooks.)

This was super easy to make and yes, addictive! I felt it was pretty well cooked after the first 15 minutes. I only roasted it about 4 minutes more, not 8. The second time I made it I sprinkled it with grated parmesan cheese. If possible, it was even better!
