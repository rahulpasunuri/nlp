Yes, the flavours are light, and fresh mozzarella is a must, but my husband and I really love this dish. I actually double the farro and this salad easily transforms into a light late-winter/early-spring supper, with leftovers for lunch the following day. I think it's absolutely delicious, if a bit of a quiet/restrained palette. We actually agree that it's going to feature in some kind of upcoming spring dinner for guests; I could see this followed by roasted vegetables in a meyer lemon beurre blanc or a pasta primavera with lemon and snipped chive blossoms.

Had this last night as part of a dinner club - we all loved it. Light and refreshing for a warm summer day. Could definitely see turning this into a great lunch.

Switched out the farro for fresh toasted pepitas with salt sprinkled on top. The crunch and flavor blended nicely with the salad. Also halved some cherry tomatoes and placed around the edge of the serving platter for extra color and flavor. Nice salad for griiled meats.

It was just okay. Not even sure if I will make a variation of this next time. it was a pain to find farro and i was expecting so much more based on the note with the recipe.

I was not impressed. It was so so but my guests raved over it.

I was ecstatic to try this salad with my family for Easter ... especially with the farro, which I had never worked with before. It was certainly edible, but nothing special. VERY mild. Fresh mozzarella (in "balls," packed in water) is KEY for texture and taste (I was forced to use just a plain block of mass-produced mozz because I forgot the fresh at home). I added more zest and juice to the dressing because it seemed quite oily ... all in all, the flavors are fresh and clean, but nothing great, really. Just cucumber, lettuce, some cheese, and a grain that doesn't carry much flavor, topped with o/o and lemon. Needs to be made more interesting by spicing it up.
