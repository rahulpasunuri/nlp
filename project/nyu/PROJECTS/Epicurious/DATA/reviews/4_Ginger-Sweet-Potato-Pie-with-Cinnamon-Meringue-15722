I've made this several times and it's always a hit! I use fresh ginger instead of granulated and always grind my own spices ( I think freshly ground spices have a more potent and fresher flavor). The cinnamon meringue is impressive. Not a crumb ever left over.

I made this twice. Delicious and pretty but a bit sweet and not "Gingery" enough for me. Second time around I substituted ground ginger for nutmeg and cloves (1 tsp) and reduced the sugar to a 1/4 cup. Ditto for the meringue, more cinnamon less sugar (3/4 cup). I also took another reviewers advice and made a gingersnap crust. Good call. I also used this recipe with Chipotles in Adobo less sugar and no meringue or ginger. Chili lovers only.

This is the first pie I have ever baked and I followed the directions meticulously. It was absolutely perfect. As a matter of fact, it was devoured within a few minutes. I roasted and glazed pecans with cinnamon and used them as garnish around the edge of the pie. The leftover cinnamon glazed pecans were also devoured in minutes.

This pie is fabulous, and one of my all-time favorite. I found it to have exceptional flavor, and the combination of cinnamon meringue and ginger sweet potato filling was outstanding.

I just made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was delicious. I actually made two pies, one with a gingersnap crust instead of the usual pie crust. The gingersnap crust really takes it up another notch! Yum!

I made this the year it was in the magazine and I now make it every year! It is a family favorite. The ginger is a delightful surprise and the cinnamon meringue is beautiful and tasty.

This pie was an abysmal failure...taste wise. After a time commitment of at least three hours, I expected a delicious dessert! The result was a flat crust, bland filling and overwhelming cinnamon meringue. Although the meringue itself is a visual showstopper, the two teaspoons of cinnamon simply overwhelm it. It may be saved by reducing the cinnamon to one teaspoon, or simply leaving it out altogether. The sweet potato pie filling lacks punch. With only 1/2 teapoon of seasoning adding to it and a 1/3 cup of sugar, the filling lacks any flavour at all. The chopped up crystallized ginger, which seems like a very interesting addition, wasn't even noticeable in texture or flavour. Although the texture is much lighter and pleasing than a pumpkin pie, it offers nothing else of value. And the pastry dough recipe is a complete failure...in flavour and texture. Although the recipe works just fine -- and for those who found it too wet, I would imagine that you added too much water, two tablespoons is sufficient -- the end result is deplorable. I make my own pastry for my other pies and it is light and flaky and delicious. This crust barely resembled the cheap imitations that you can find in a supermarket. I was thoroughly disappointed with this pie. It was not a cheap pie to make and, based on Gourmet's good name, I expected much more. Overall? The recipe was easy to follow, the instructions were clear and the end result was precise if you followed the steps. The ingredients were not hard to find, in fact, you can find the crystallized ginger at the Bulk Barn. The visual end result was pleasing, as the meringue stacked up high above the filling and definitely produced a "wow" affect at the table. However, the most important aspect of the entire operation is that the food taste good and this, while now foul tasting, was not even close to what I would call "yummy".

Simply fabulous. To accomodate a dietary restriction, I replaced the pastry crust with one made from gluten-free ginger snaps. It was a perfect extra -- and that is not always the case when you're removing gluten from recipes. This is a great pie. It looks spectacular and tastes even better.

This beautiful pie took the place of my traditional pumpkin pie. Made this with the Maple Creme Flan and used the left over egg whites from the flan for the incredible topping on this pie. This pie is great for those who want a fantastic looking and tasting pie without all the whip creams fat and calories.

I'll add my praise to this recipe. Marvelous! The ultimate in a sophisticated sweet potato pie. I "cheated" and used a frozen pastry crust, but followed the recipe exactly on everything else. My parents who are sweet potato pie fanatics, said that it was the best by far they'd ever tasted. A new staple on my Thanksgiving (and probably other special occasions too!) table. One caution, however - VERY time consuming pie to make. Be sure you leave ample.

This pie is a showstopper - it is gorgeous and most people, who have not had Sweet Potato Pie are just blown away by it. The Cinammon Meringue just makes the pie perfect! A new holiday tradition at my home!

I never LOVED Sweet Potato Pie until I tried this recipe. The cinnamon and ginger are perfect compliments to brighten up the flavor of the pie.

Very good pie. We had three at Thanksgiving, and this was the winner out of some strong contenders. Stunning appearance, and a slighly different taste on a familiar theme made it a winner.

This is really an elegant dessert for the discrim-inating gourmet. It is very easy to make and can be assured to please each and every time. One must be careful to be exact with the ginger, as I once over-did it and it had an after taste. Besides the taste being tantalizing, the appearance is beautiful.

I really enjoyed the flavors, but I felt the cinnamon meringue was overpowering. I really love sweet potato pie and the ginger really added to it. I reduced the cinnamon content in the meringue by half and I think the flavors now compliment each other more

Excellent and easy to make! I've made for two separate dinner parties and it was THE dish of the evening.
