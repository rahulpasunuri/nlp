Putting a little olive oil in the turkey helped moisten the burger a bit - will definitely do that going forward making turkey burgers. (Also added some herbs.) I used a bakery whole grain bread - obviously you can use your preference here. I also added some balsamic vinegar to the mushroom mixture. I put the mushrooms on top of the burger and put the greens on the side as a salad but will probably put it on the burger next time. Oh, and we grilled the burgers while the mushrooms cooked inside. I thought this was just great for a weeknight dinner and will definitely make it again.

Made this recipe for my boyfriend and I, put it over a really thick slice of sourdough and added a lot of fresh herbs into my turkey burger, used oyster, cremini, and shitake mushrooms with lots of extra garlic... served it with some roasted, thick cut sweet potato wedges. Very nice for a quick dinner.

To me, two forks means "I'm don't regret making it but I won't make it again", and that's just how I felt about these burgers. No regrets, but no repeats either.

Amazing. All of the flavors compliment each other perfectly. I added some extra garlic and white wine vinegar but other than that stuck to the recipe. Definitely adding this to the recipe book.

Very good. I did, however, use large barbecue buns by spooning the mushrooms onto the patty. Slurpy and very tasty.

Made this simple dish with some added ingrediants and steps. Mixed turkey meat with a little blue cheese and grilled instead of frying. Mushrooms were excellent as was the simple arugula salade.

My husband barely wants to eat any kind of burger that isn't red meat and he LOVED these! Perfect weeknight dinner.

I made this for my boyfriend and we both loved it! I read the previous reviews expressing that the turkey was less flavorful, so I added 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp worcestershire sauce to the ground turkey; next time I'm also going to add some rosemary and oregano. The turkey was flavorful and the mushrooms/shallots were amazing! I used 2 large cloves of garlic since I love garlic. My boyfriend took the drippings from the pan and soaked them up with the bread. I chose a coarse multi-grain loaf of bread from a bakery. Finally, I just made a simple spinach salad with store-bought dressing from the fridge to save time.

My husband and I love this dish. Nothing that blows your socks of but simple, clean, flavorful taste. One of our favorite weekday dinners.

Rather plain. Good, but not interesting. An open faced cheese burger with mushroom does not really require a recipe I guess.

I cooked it tonight and it was delicious! I used swiss instead of gruyere and plan on seasoning the turkey meat next time. This is a great, quick and convenient weekday recipe!

We liked this recipe; the mushroom mixture has a very good flavor. We used whole wheat hamburger buns and would do that again. Next time I would like to mix some herbs into the turkey mixture just to give it a little more flavor.

The combination of flavors is fabulous together.

We've made this several times around our house for ourselves and for guests. It's an easy and excellent recipe. My only alterations are to use Swiss instead of Gruyere, and spinach instead of arugula, more because of their constant presence in my fridge than a taste preference. Also, I generally serve it is a whole sandwich with both buns.

My husband and I loved this dish! The only thing we changed was cutting the amount of mushrooms in half, but not the garlic or shallots. It was just the perfect amount to cover the bread! We didn't have any trouble with it being too oily though! yum!

Skipped the bread (carb thing) and served the GRILLED turkey burger (with melted Havarti since I couldn't find sliced Gruyere [lazy]) atop the arugula salad, and topped the burger with the mushroom mixture. DANG that was good!! Definitely a weeknight keeper!

My boyfriend and I really like this recipe. I did change a few things about it though. I'm not a big fan of open-faced sandwiches so I made it once using two slices of toasted bread and another using buns. I think I'll use buns from now on. The second time I made this I skipped the salad dressing and just used the greens because it didn't seem to make a big difference either way. My boyfriend didn't want the greens on it, so I guess it's more of a personal preference. Also, I found it to be a bit too greasy with all the added olive oil, so I cut out the step where you add the oil to the uncooked meat. I couldn't seem to find the cheese the recipe called for at the grocery store, so I just use swiss. It's really a great, easy recipe though, especially for week nights!

This was very good - easy and an attractive presentation. Could be used for a quick supper with friends. I served with roasted sliced sweet potatoes.
