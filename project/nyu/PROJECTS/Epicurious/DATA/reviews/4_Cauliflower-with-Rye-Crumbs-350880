Butter is not vegan. This should be under 'vegetarian'.

Want to try this! Do you cut this top to bottom in chunks with a serving knife & fork? Presents beautifully but don't want to confuse my guests.

Loved it. Cut back a bit on the butter. My husband said it reminded him of a favorite childhood recipe. Will make again many times.

This was a hit with Christmas dinner. I didn't have time to make rye bread crumbs, used purchased, all good and everyone loved this. Thanks.
