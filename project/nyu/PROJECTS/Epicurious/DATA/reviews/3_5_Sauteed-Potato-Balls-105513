I'd like to try this but I'm really new at cooking and I'm not really sure how to get them to come out as balls......

This is a lovely, very basic recipe. It goes wonderfully with more complex flavors, and can be played with to suit anyone's tastes.

I did them exactly as the recipe says and they came out perfectly. I sauteed them with butter, minced onion, nutmeg and little parsley at the end. Excellent.

my recipe ended up quite different. I couldn't really get the potatoes to come out like "balls" with the melon baller so we just cubed them. We parboiled with a chicken boullion cube and then sauteed with butter, garlic, salt and pepper. It turned out really, really good. It was our side with tri-tip.

This recipe was quite bland the first time I made it so on the second try I parboiled the potatoes in chicken broth and herbs de provence and rolled the potatoes in parmesan cheese after sauteeing. Much better! Good with beef tenderloin.
