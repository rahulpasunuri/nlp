This is a keeper - it's already in my recipe box. Easy to make and you only need one pot. Love that. It tastes wonderful. I served it to friends, who loved it. I think it's my new favorite black bean dip.

Love this recipe. Make it exactly as they say. It is healthy and really good with the smoky chipotle!

I used jarred roasted red pepper rather than a green pepper and added more lime juice to give the dip a citrusy edge. I toasted and ground cumin and coriander seeds for the spices, and added 1/2 tsp. toasted and ground oregano. Served with sour cream and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes, on oven-baked chips made from yellow corn tortillas. The tomato was the finishing touch. Excellent combo.

Followed "A Cook from Evanston, IL" recipe with one exception - I used only one chipotle pepper...coward that I am. I let the dip mellow overnight and it was tasty and spicy but not overwhelmingly spicy. Next time I probably will go for the second chipotle. Thanks Evanston, IL.

This was a huge hit at the BBQ we just attended. I left out the bacon to make it vegetarian- friendly, so I used roasted red and yellow bell peppers for the smoky flavor and sauteed the onion in olive oil. Following other reviews, I used 2 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. chile powder, 2 tsp. oregano, and added about 4 cloves of garlic. I also used 2 large chipotles and 3 tsp. of the adobo sauce. It was very spicy and delicious. I only used about 1/4 c. of the bean liquid from the can, because it was very salty, so I added 1/4 c. of water to the portion pureed in the food processor. I also added about 1 Tbsp. of fresh lime juice at the very end, and skipped the sour cream.

This is my favorite dip recipe but it wasn't as popular with others at my party. I think you have to be a bean dip fan (I am)and, if you are, this is the best! I made it exactly as instructed and it was perfect. I ate all of the leftover myself...happily!

I've made this dip about 8 to 10 times; it's one of my favorites. I use as much bacon as I can fit in the pan (~1/2 pkg.), and use ~4x as much (or more) cumin, oregano and chipotle chiles. Yummm!!!

Loved this recipe. I will be using it often.

After reading the previous reviews I made some adjustments to make sure it wasn't too bland. I made these changes to the original recipe: 3 oz Embasa brand chipotle chiles, 1 med red bell pepper, 5 turkey bacon slices, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp dried oregano (all else stayed the same).

This recipe is so verstile and a must for entertaining with a South of the Border menu. I have made it according to the recipe with great results and also with omitting the bacon for my vegetarian friends. Reheat the leftovers the next day with great flavor. I might suggest freezing the remaing chipolte peppers individually on a cookie sheet as the recipe calls for the one teaspoon. Place them in the freezer in a zip lock bag. They retain the great flavor when thawed.

Excellent! I omitted the bacon and it was still tasty, smoky with just enough spice -- a keeper.

This will become one of my staple dip recipes. Very, very good.

This is a good base recipe - I have been making this particular recipe for the last 2 years. The key is 2x - 3x the chipotle peppers with extra adobo. Also keep in mind - when you are doing the final salt adn peppering - go heavyier than normal. Cold foods spices do not translate on the tongue like spices in food serverd hot. To really make this pop you are going to have to make it a little salty and spicy... and then before you serve it check the spice levels again. But I do agree - if you skimp on the salt and peppers - this will be insipid.

I too made this for a huge Cinco de Mayo party I threw. I planned for the party for ages... you'd think I'd have the brains to read the reviews for this recipe before serving to guests! The last few reviews are spot-on. The dip's bland and boring and is seriously in need of a good dose of garlic to perk it up. The rest of the party food was a roaring success, but I guess you can't win 'em all!

I don't think the bacon did much for this dip other than to make it slightly greasy and add fat & calories. Not something I would repeat... there was lots left over when I served this at my Cinco De Mayo bbq.

I have to agree with Nadia. I made this to take to a pot luck, and out of all the appetizers at the party, mine was the only one left over! It was bland even after I tried to jazz it up by adding garlic, using extra spices, and more adobo.

Boring! No better than something you'd get out of a jar at the supermarket. This lacked flavor, spice and the ooopmph I look for when preparing homemade condiments. If it doesn't taste great, why go to the bother?

Everyone loved this recipe. I think it's the bacon that gives it a different taste. I used low-fat sourcream and no one noticed. It went well with the tortilla chips that are scoops. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent bean dip but it REALLY needs the extra chipotle chilies! I used 3teaspoons instead of 1 and I still think it could have used more. Season with LOTS of salt and pepper and I also used about a Tablespoon of taco seasoning along with the other spices. This is good but certainly needs the extras to make it fantastic!

I made this to bring over to a get-together, and my friends lapped it up; however, I found it kind of boring. I followed the recipe exactly and I think it needed more spice, and something extra...maybe another kind of pepper, more spices, garlic...definitely needed to be a more well-rounded flavour. Its a decent bean dip as they go, but no better than something you'd buy at the supermarket. If you're looking to make your own dip, skip this recipe or be prepared to doctor it. The smoky chipotle flavour was not enough to save it for me.

This is a great dip for a party. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I added a little extra bacon, and garnished with scallions instead of cilantro. I also added a chopped jalepeno and more chipotle chiles for extra spice although the recipie is spicy as is. Will make again.

Excellent. I left out the bacon. Very simple to make and everyone loved it at our party. One chipotle was the perfect heat for a mild/medium spice party group.

I just served this at an outdoor party and everyone loved it I made no changes other than adding 3 tsp chipotle rather than 1 - for a little extra spice. Loved the fact that it can be made ahead and still tastes great!

Fast and easy. I made it vegetarian by omitting the bacon and adding a couple of extra teaspoons of adobo sauce. I also skipped the sour cream and stirred in some finely chopped green pepper just before serving, for texture.

This is one of my favorite i've been making it for 2 years now, for those of you who want more heat substitute chipotle chiles for chopped green chiles (canned) great flavor more heat

I liked this, but felt it really needed much more spice. I added more chipotles, a few tablespoons of the adobo, and more cumin and oregano. Perhaps a sprinkling of minced red onion atop the sour cream next time, too. Served surrounded by tortilla chips.

This dip was great! I served it at pre-Superbowl party last week and made two versions. I doubled both of them. The first was to the letter except I added more chipotle pepper. The second one was to skip the bacon and sour cream and substitute red beans for the black beans and use cilantro instead of oregano. For those of you who do WW the second one only has 1 point for 1/2 a cup! I served both with toasted pita chips and baked blue corn chips.

Very good. I recommend adding a bit more chipotle for some added spiciness.

This was a party pleaser. The bacon and chipotle really add to the bean flavor. I served it luke warm rather than cool and added a little extra bacon and chipotle. My family loves it! Thumbs up.

This dip is good, but Cooking Light's Tex Mex Black Bean Dip is better and easier. This is good with more spice and served with pita chips.

This was okay. Nothing special. It was good served with fajitas, but really tastes like plain black beans. The added ingredients do not change the taste enough for the trouble.

I took this to a small gathering of friends and got some nice comments. I too believe that it would be better warm, although I served it cold. I made it with turkey bacon, which was good, but I suspect that regular pork bacon would be fabulous. A slight warning on this recipe- the beans may impact folks later on if they eat a lot of this!

Rating: 3
This was very good and transports well if you need to bring something to a party. The only thing I did different, was before mixing the pureed mix to the whole beans, I took a potato masher and mashed the remaining beans a little, which I thought made the consistency better.

My guests loved the dip. I am a vegetarian so I omitted the bacon. The recipe was still excellent and very easy to make. I put the whole mixture in the food processor and hit the pulse button a few times. I used the leftovers in quesadillas the next night for dinner.

I thought this was fabulous and wonderfully versatile too. We liked it warm with chips and in tortillas. Next time I want to try it as a variation on the Santa Fe Pizza (in the same issue).

Very easy to make. I could not find the chipotle chiles so I used some green chiles and it worked fine. I put 2 cups of the bean mixture in the processor because we wanted it a bit more pureed.

This dish was tasty, easy to fix, healthy and versitle. We ate it as chip dip (but we liked it warmed), then we wrapped it up in some four shells for a burrito, and we put some over a tequilla chicken. It was great however we ate it.

This dish was easy, and surprisingly flavorful. The bacon and chipolte add an unexpected dimension to the beans. A definite improvement over plain ol' bean dip.
