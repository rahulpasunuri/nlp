My 11 and 13 year old sons and my husband (who doesn't eat legumes usually) lap it up...sprinkled with parmesan cheese and a little olive oil. I serve it every couple of weeks with a Caprese salad and french bread. As others recommended, I chop the onion in the cuisinart and return it to the soup instead of discarding it...we love onions and it adds a lot of flavor.

looking for the lentils in this soup!

Reviewers keep talking about keeping the mint, but there is none in the ingredient list, also, as the last reviewer points out, there are no lentils in the ingredient list!

There are no lentils on the ingredient list!!! Perhaps Someone from Epicurious should correct this.

Read previous reviews... added 2 cloves, kept the onion. I also added a little sherry - very tasty. Will definitely make again - so easy!!!

It's a nice, simple recipe. Nevertheless, not to be toooo persnickity, shouldn't "lentils" be included in the ingredient list? :)

I've made this twice so far. The first time, I followed the recepe as written and I liked it. The only change I would recommend is to add the garlic MUCH earlier or saute it first. Adding it raw at the end was a little tough on my digestive system. The second time, I cut up the onion and instead of using 2 cloves I put in 1/2 tsp of ground cloves. (You might want to start with a 1/4 and build up.) EXCELLENT! I would recommend this for the folks who added cayenne as a way to give it some kick but still keep with the original intent of the soup. On day 2, to thin the soup down, I added a small can of crushed tomatos. It went very well with the hyped up clove taste.

I made this soup almost exactly as written. I did add about another 2 cups of broth as mine seemed to be too dry during cooking. I did not have fresh thyme so I used a few pinches of dry and it had a nice thyme flavor. I was hesitant to use thyme as it did not sound very good to me but I must admit that it made the soup, in my opinion. I drizzled some plain yogurt on top of each bowl and topped with chopped mint and it was wonderful. A nice simple soup recipe.

A nice, simple soup. Great for a cold winter's day. It went over very well with a somewhat picky crowd.

i like lentil soup thick, so i added 6 cups stock instead of 8 - added finely chopped carrot and celery during last 10 min simmer - 4 tbsp beurre insteada 2 - 1/2 tsp thyme insteada 1 tsp. could have still been thicker i think. will try again with more veggies/spices.

I have to admit - this lentil soup beats mine hands down! Super quick and easy to make, very healthy, and absolutely delicious. For the record, I chopped up the onion, used two cloves and two bay leaves, and I added a bit of cayenne for a little extra kick, but no other changes and I don't think it needs any. The cloves are a divine touch, as is the butter. The mint is a must, do not skip. All in all, a fabulous recipe, and one I will make again and again - it is replacing my own lentil soup recipe, and I have obviously been partial to it, as it is the lentil soup I grew up with!

This is a very kid-friendly dish. I use extra chicken bouillon -- "Better Than Boullion" product is great. I agree about using less water. My family (including 3 small boys) thought it was a great cold evening meal.

I made it with http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/105762 Vegetable Stock. Excellent!

After reading the other reviews, I decided to roast the vegetables (tomatoes, garlic, onion, and carrot) before adding them to the lentil and simmering broth/water. After a few hours, I then pureed it and added salt, a bit of cayenne, more thyme, and nutmeg. It tasted good, and was very filling. But the next day. . .The soup was fabulous! It took overnight in the fridge to really bring out the taste of the roasted vegetables and the seasonings. I think that if the soup were made directly as written, the recipe would be quite bland.

as others have said, this recipe is a good starting point. without the tweaks it's good but nothing remarkable. i usually add small amounts of cumin, coriander, chili flakes, and use 2 rather than just 1 clove. and depending on what's on the shelf or in the fridge, i'll add spinach, tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, celery, etc. i also add lemon juice at the end and maybe a splash of balsamic vinegar. do go easy on the salt at the beginning because the stock can make it overly salty -- i usually don't use 8 cups stock, more like 5-6 cups stock and 2-3 of water.

Like the other reviewers I made this exactly as described with a couple exceptions, I used 2 bay leaves, vegetable stock, some cumin - about a tsp., a little spinach and lemon juice. I served it with garlic crostini - everyone loved it; it was the perfect one dish winter meal. It was also extremely simple.

As many others have said, this is a great recipe to start from. I made it for the second time today, and added chopped carrots about 15 minutes into the initial simmer time, and then chopped spinach near the end. After it was finished cooking I stirred in some lemon juice (a little more than 1/4 cup), which is a really nice way to mellow out the otherwise overwhelming thyme flavor.

This is a good thick basic soup. It is simple and delicious. My wife and kids hate it. My oldest boy sorta liked it. Next time I will add a bit of ham or something. (They still won't eat it though)

I agree with another reviewer that this is a good base recipe, but it improves with some tweaking. I used my slow cooker and let the basic recipe go for about 4 hours. Then I added sliced carrots and celery, cubed potatoes, chopped spinach (you could used escarole or other greens), chopped tomatoes and 3 cloves of garlic. Tasted for seasoning periodically and added a healthy splash of red wine. Very easy, nutritious, and frugal.

Delicious and easy - but a little too thick.

Delicious! Instead of throwing away the onion after simmering it with the lentils, I chopped it up, sauteed it with a couple of hot dogs (didn't have any ham or other meats on hand) and added it to the soup along with a cut up russett potato. I also put the entire garlic clove in the oven and roasted it before I added it to the soup. I used low salt chicken broth. The end result was a very flavorful, wonderfully smelling, and very tasty soup. I will definitely make this again and pair it up with some homemade cornbread. Yum!

To the cook from Rancho Mirage: If you peel and quarter a potato (any potato) and throw it into a salty soup, the potatoes will absorb the excess salt. Just leave them in to simmer for 15-20 minutes, take them out, taste, and reseason.

I thought that this was a great, basic lentil soup recipe. I would really want to give this 3 and a half forks, because it deserves more than a 3, but not quite a 4. I added carrots, since I had them at home. I think that celery would be nice to add also. I did not have fresh thyme on hand, so I did not have that in my soup. I added some old bay for a little kick as well as whatever spice in my pantry struck me at the time! I think that the butter made a huge difference in the flavor. My husband loved this, although he still thinks that his mother's recipe is better! (I must admit that I disagree!)

I thoughtlessly put salt in before tasting and BIG MISTAKE. Forgot that I had put 8 (eventually 10) c. of chicken broth so it had enought salt. Extended it by adding water and thickening with flour which salvaged it. Still very yummy. Good idea to brown the onion before cooking.

This recipe was really tasty. It did take a bit longer to simmer than what was indicated on the instructions. The end result was fantastic! My husband, who "tolerates" lentil soup, ate 2 large bowls. I will make this time and again.

Great winter soup! Didn't have the wine or the parsley and it still turned out great. I added a pinch of red chili powder to add a little bit of spice.

this is a wonderful base recipe!!! i seared the onion on the grill before sticking in the clove, and threw a bay leaf on with the clove. To heat things up, i added a bit of curry and chili powder and after simmering, added silken tofu and blended 1/2 the soup, then added fresh spinach. It was very satisfying, and helped me clean out my fridge a bit!!!!

This soup was fragrant and delicious. Very simple and wholesome. I increased the thyme a little, and the mint is a must. I may try it with vegetable broth next time to make it more "vegetarian..."

If you like lentils, this is a very basic recipe that is simple and quick.
