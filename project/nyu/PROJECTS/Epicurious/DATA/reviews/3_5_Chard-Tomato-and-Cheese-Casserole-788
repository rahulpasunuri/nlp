To everyone who had this dish end up soggy-you need to really squeeze the liquid out of the chard. Don't blame a recipe if you don't your way around a kitchen. This is fantastic dish. I used just under the called for 3 cups of broth and mine came out perfect, not wet at all. You also really need to give it 15 minutes at least to bake uncovered and to brown on top. I only used about 3 lbs of chard and sprinkled the top with grated parm. It was fantastic and a huge hit.

I am pretty sure this recipe would be terrible as-is. Seems like it would be a soggy mess. I added a layer of dry red lentils and dry couscous to the bottom of the pan (about a cup of each, I think) and it came out perfect. Really delicious.

This is a great recipe. If you add some oven roasted potatoes, it is a wonderful main dish.

I first made this dish for a friend who is vegetarian and gluten intolerant. Mindful of what others had written about the dish needing some kind of grain base to soak up all the excess moisture from cooking, I used two cups of dry quinoa (four cups cooked), the Andean high protein grain, and used it as the base layer of the casserole with excellent results. Quinoa has a wonderful springy/crunchy texture and comes in a red and white variety at my local food co-op. Using red quinoa and red swiss chard and some of the spicier cheese choices, it makes a very colorful casserole that reheats wonderfully. I now make this in quantity and freeze.

Add some pre-cooked pasta such as fusili to this dish before baking for a more substantial main dish that the whole family will enjoy (even little kids). This also has the huge advantage of absorbing any extra liquid from the veggies - I don't even bother squeezing out the chard, since the pasta does the work for me. This recipe - with a few modifications - is a summer regular with us, as we get loads of chard in our organic veggie delivery box. One change I recommend is to use a different cheese - Monterey Jack is just too bland for my liking, so I use red Leicester, cheddar, manchego or something else like that.

what a bummer. i made this dish as a main course for "lunch club" at work and i was embarrassed. someone came into the kitchen and said it smelled like pizza - which was exactly the point. the recipe turned out like vegetarian pizza topping without the crust. it should go over noodles or cous cous or carbs of some sort. by itself it's tasty, but something's definitely missing. i used half chard and half spinach. the whole mass boiled down to nothing (definitely not enough for 8-10 people! i can eat a bunch of spinach easily, myself) so i had to cook and add another bunch of spinach at the last minute. i used 1/2 monterey jack and 1/2 cheddar. the whole thing turned into a cheesy, tomatoey mess. perfect pizza topping, not a main course.

I'm glad I read the reviews first. If you don't really squeeze the liquid out of the chard ater cooking it (and the veggies, too) you will end up with a huge mess like werb from Portland, OR . Get rid of all that 'juice' and you will enjoy the dish much more!

I made this dish for an office potluck and everyone loved it. They loved it so much they were dissapointed I took the leftovers home. I did alter the recipe just a bit, instead of just jack cheese, I added some cheddar for a little more flavor. The second time around I added a little basil, and used mozarella on the top. There is also more chard than the recipe calls for and less bell peppers. This dish is far tastier than I thought it would be.

Didn't like this one. To be called a casserole, I think it needs something to hold it together, i.e. eggs & breadcrumbs, a sauce? To me it just seemed like overcooked vegetables with chewy cheese globs.

It was good! I was loaded up on mustard greens in my fridge, so instead of going out and buying chard, I used those. I thought the casserole was a bit bland, but it could have been my subsitution. Also, I used red, orange, and yellow bell peppers instead of just red. This casserole was especially delicious the next day: leftovers wrapped in tortillas with spicy salsa! Next time I'll add green chilies to the casserole to give it a kick.

i didn't think this was quite as labor-intensive as other reviewers (maybe because i am vegetarian, and more used to chopping veggies?) thought it was quite good, and my bfriend (a meateater) enjoyed it to. but, despite draining chard, there was liquid leftover. make sure to dry the chard really well! otherwise, a very good recipe.

Delicious. I made this recipe with 1/2 fresh chard and 1/2 fresh spinach. For the cheese, I combined four different cheeses --using up what was in the fridge. Asiago, cheddar, jarlsburg, and "Greek Hard Cheese" -- four cheeses with strong flavors made it extra tasty.

Take your chopped chard, spinach, whatever, spread it on a kitchen towel, roll the towel up from the long edge, and twist hard. Yes, the green washes out of the towel.

This was fabulous and great rave reviews from my guests! It was really easy to make and was well worth the time it took to chop and prepare. I used half chard and half spinach, half the amount of cheese called for and shallots in the place of onions. It is important to remove as much moisture as possible. I did this by sqeezing the sauteed vegetable mixture in paper towels several times before adding the cheese, as well as lighlty pressing the tomatoes in a layer of paper towels. The dish was still very moist. Next time I'll try a variation with a layer of sliced yukon gold potatoes and serve this as my main entree for a vegetarian meal.

I've made this recipe several times now, and we've enjoyed it each time! Great flavors! Definitely take the time to dry the chard. The recipe also works well with a mixture of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses.

Seemed like a lot of effort for what it was.

I was surprised this dish was as good as it was. I did cut the amount of cheese down slightly as suggested by other reviewers. I also spun the vegetables after cooking to get rid of excess water but still found it a bit watery at the end so next time will try the salt method suggested by another reviewer. Despite that, the flavors were great and a nice change.

This really was worth all the effort. I used a salad spinner (they DO still come in handy!) to dry ALL of the vegetables as much as possible, but I found that adding a tad bit of salt to the vegetables and letting them drain on kitchen for about a half an hour towls worked wonders. Kale is a wonderful PARTIAL substitution.

My husband and I loved this. I used mozzarella and pepperjack cheeses because that's all I had, and it worked wonderfully.

This was greasy and awful - a waste of good chard and peppers! It would be better to skip the cheese and stir-fry the rest of the ingreds.

This dish was all that the previous reviewers claimed. The only downside was that it was quite labor intensive, lots of chopping and it took forever to get the chard washed, dried and chopped. However, the results were worth the effort!

Yum! I had low expectations for this, but am always looking for another way to add veggies to the menu, so I gave it a shot and it was delicious. The amount of chard seemed overwhelming until I made it and realized how much it cooked down. As other reviewers have pointed out, make sure to press out additional water, or dish will be swimming in it. Never thought I'd say this, but I would cut down on the amount of cheese. I think this would be great with spinach also.

I made this any it was wonderful! Very different and flavourful. All my family loved it. I did press out the chad really well and it was perfect.

The blend of flavors in this recipe is wonderful. Ours did turn out a little watery...we figured it was because we used a smaller, deeper dish than recommended in the recipe, but now reading the other reviews i wonder if it's a recipe flaw. Even so, it's a recipe worth keeping.

This was wonderful! I used 3 bunches of chard instead of 2, and substituted shallots for the onions for a slightly sweeter result.

Very tasty, attractive vegetarian dish, but if you use kale as a sub, be careful not to strain TOO much water or it gets a little tough. Vegetable mix would turn into an incredible fritatta.

I would agree with adding more chard, subtracting more water. It just didn't hold together well.

Drain/press liquid out of the onions and peppers as well as the chard! Otherwise, it was wonderful - very flavorful, and surprisingly easy to make.

This is very tasty. When I make it again, I will make sure I press all the liquid out of the red pepper/onion mixture as well as the chard, because I ended up with too much liquid in my pan.

Absolutely delicious. I substitute kale for some of the chard sometimes.

You need 3 bundles of chard. Make sure after draining cooked chard in collander that you squeeze out extra water. Fantastic: have received many compliments from every potluck I take it to

I make this from what I grow in my garden and LOVE it. I've made it several times this summer. I did find that it was a little better after adding 1 clove of minced garlic and 1 T balsamic vinegar to the chard mixture before cooking. YUMMY!

This was a great (easy) recipe. The flavor was just great, the dish had wonderful color and the texture was wonderful for a meatless main dish. I'd definitely recommend it.

I added penne pasta before baking and it was delicious. Definitely a good casserole for a cold winter night.

A great dish, easy, quick, great for dinner parties. I had to double the chard however, as the 2 bunches were definitely not enough.

Really a delicious use of late summer vegetables from the garden. Everyone loved, even those who "don't like" chard. Seed the tomatoes before you slice them.

This is an absolutely wonderful summer recipe. We used fresh swiss chard from our garden. The recipe really doesn't serve as many people as it claims; the tomatoes cook down quite a bit. This recipe was a big hit.
