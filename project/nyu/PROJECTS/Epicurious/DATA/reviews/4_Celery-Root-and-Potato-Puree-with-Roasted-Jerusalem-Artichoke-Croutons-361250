Very easy and tasty. I used Yukon gold and left out the thyme (since I didn't have any fresh in the house). I also reserved the creamy broth after draining to make the mash a bit more creamy, rather than adding more butter. The sunchokes were a pleasant burst of flavor. I served this alongside flank steak.

The celery root is kind of expensive, but it's so good that we have made this recipe several times. You can actually extend the recipe with extra potatoes, and it doesn't loose the celery root flavor. We skip the croutons, and just make the puree.

Really lovely mash - and the artichokes were delicious. They made the dish. This is now in my list of favorites!

This is a fantastic alternative to mashed potatoes. The celery root adds an interesting sweet element and the chunkier texture is perfect for sopping up Thanksgiving gravy! I had to put this away immediately after I made it so I didn't eat the whole batch!

Beautifully fall-seasonal with both celeriac and Jerusalem artichokes: perfect for Thanksgiving. (Peeling both takes time!) I used white peppercorns. Next time: I will use more thyme/green for color-- maybe chopped chives too-and add some milk or cream to the smashed mash. Leftovers will make nice sauteed potato cakes!

Delicious. I wasn't able to find jerusalem artichokes this time of year; however, the puree was excellent without them. It was a great base for stuffed chicken breasts.

Delicious! Loved the mild celery flavor and light texture of the puree. Served with an orange-honey glazed roast chicken and some stewed red kale for a fantastic fall supper. Only thing I'd change: would roast more sunchokes next time. We ate almost all of them and didn't have any leftovers to top the remaining puree.

Ooh, I love this!!! Let it be known that I am a huge celeriac and jerusalem artichoke fan. This is delicious, and I can't wait to make it again. Such a good way to highlight sunchokes. The mash is great. I don't ever make mashed potatoes alone but the celery root adds great depth. I served this with the roast chicken with parsnips, golden beets and jerusalem artichokes (though instead used fennel for them) with beer pan juices- together they were superb!
