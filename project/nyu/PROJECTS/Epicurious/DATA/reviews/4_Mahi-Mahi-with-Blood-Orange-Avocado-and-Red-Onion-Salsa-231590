Yes to this recipe! It is great tasting, light yet full of flavor and it's quick to make! Wouldn't change one thing about it :-) I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company.

Double easily. Used a regular navel orange 4x3oz fillets and followed the rest exactly. Might chop things up more next time. Lots of juice (nicely soaked up by quinoa) but that juice, mixed with smaller pieces, might make more of a sauce than a salsa? could be tasty. Great flavors and super easy to make.

As Mahi-Mahi is harder to find where I live, I tried this with Snapper instead. It was excellent! Highly recommended.

My husband and I absolutely loved this fresh & healthy recipe! I used what I had on-hand: 1 small can of drained mandarin oranges instead of blood orange, lemon juice instead of lime, and added fresh cilantro. I also marinated fish in lemon juice with chopped garlic for 15 minutes. I've tried this with mahi-mahi & halibut. I like it best with the halibut. Will make this dish all spring & summer long!

Bought blood oranges and except for juicing (to pair with vodka:) didn't know what to do with them. This was perfect-only I used swordfish and also added cilantro. Tastes like summer!

Very tasty- even for my fiance- a fish hater! I added cilantro as others suggested and marinated the fish in garlic in lime juice for 12-15 minutes. Served it with cilantro rice and chips with the leftover salsa.

So good and so fast! Flavorful, citrusy goodness. It's a forgiving recipe that can be thrown together to your taste, so all you need to remember is the ingredient list. I made this with green jalapeno and added some extra avocado. I also marinaded the fish in fresh garlic while I made the salsa, as other reviews mentioned. The first time I made this, I put it on top of couscous drizzled with lime . The next time I made it, I made fish tacos... warmed spinach tortillas, topped with shredded spinach, lime juice, the mahi mahi, and salsa. These tacos rock and they are super healthy! How can you go wrong?

I just made this meal for my boy friend and another mutual friend and they were very impressed. Changes I made to the recipe include; substituting the Mahi-mahi with Ahi tuna steaks (because the store was out of Mahi-Mahi) and it was absolutely delicious. This was my first time cooking fish and I couldn't believe how easy and tasty it was. I also used grapefruit instead of the oranges because they weren't quite in season and I took the advice of others and added a touch of cilantro to the salsa. I am realy pleased with this recipe and i definitely encourage anyone to try it. It's virtually fool proof! I also recommend this recipe with a white wine like a Pinot Grigio.

This was a very quick and easy dinner. The salsa is fantastic and you can sub out the limes for any type of citrus. Marinating in citrus and garlic for 15 minutes was a great suggestion.

This recipe was amazing! I'm new to cooking fish and this was so simple, so tasty and so healthy. I left out the pepper in the salsa and even still it bursted with flavor! Cannot wait to make this again. YUM!

I made this for my 5 year old son and I for a weeknight at home - we both loved it! It was tasty, had a clean, subtle zing with the jalapeno and was simple to make. I am a huge lime fan and probably used 2 tbsp instead of 2 tsp - it was delicious. I served with sliced cucumbers drizzled with white vinegar and fresh parsley and a simple couscous. Couldn't have been easier...

I made this dish for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he's still raving about it a month later! I marinated the fish in fresh lime juice, per the suggestions of some other users, and added grapefruit to the salsa. I served it with sauteed corn and cilantro rice. Colorful and delicious!

p.s. (last review is mine) I sliced each orange segment in thirds. Felt that made for a nice jucier salsa and more managable bite sizes.

Loved this recipe. Like others suggested I marinated the fish in lime juice and garlic and added cilantro to the salsa -- all great ideas. However my husband felt like there were too many strong flavors competing w/ each other, so I might tone it down next time. Overall a nice healthful dish that I will certainly make again. Used cod instead of mahi mahi since the latter was not so fresh at my grocery store today.

This recipe turned out great! In place of the blood orange, we used a ripe ruby red grapefruit we had on hand. Also, took the advice of others and marinated the fish in lime juice and crushed garlic, and added cilantro to the salsa. Instead of cooking indoors, we grilled the fish on the barbeque. For a heartier meal, try cubing the fish and serving it in a corn tortilla. Either way, the recipe was light, easy, and very flavorful!

This is so nice since I love mahi-mahi and live on a citrus & avocado grove. I too soaked fish in lime juice with garlic for 15 minutes. I added chopped chives to salsa for color. Served fish on warmed plates on a bed of shredded cabbage.

Marinaded the Mahi-Mahi in the juice of a lime and 1 clove of crushed garlic for 15 minutes before cooking. Husband really liked the relish. I'll certainly make this dish again.

It was really easy, fast and refreshing. Im making it again tonight. Couldn't find Mahi Mahi at this time at the market so I just used another white fish. I also took another reviewers advice and marinated it before had, I used some mango/ orange juice, salt/pepper, and fresh lime for the marinate and it came out amazing! I definately recommend this, even if you're not crazy about fish.

This was extremely easy and quick to make, and very light and healthy tasting (I made sauteed spinach to accompany). The presentation on the plate was also very nice. I modified the ingredients a tad because I was a little concerned that the navel orange available wouldn't be quite sweet enough to achieve the sweet and spicy effect of the salsa. I added a little bit of mango, which I think was a good move. I also added a bit of lime juice in addition to the olive oil to the saute pan, which I think gave the flesh of the fish some extra flavor. I'll definitely continue to make this one!

This was a complete hit with my dinner guests. My boyfriend was still raving about it this morning. I followed another reviewer's advice and marinated the fillets for a couple hours beforehand in salt, pepper and lime, which gave the fish an incredibly complex flavor. I couldn't get enough mahi-mahi, so used turbot (first time eating this fish), which was GREAT!

This was a fine summertime dish! We ate it cold for lunch, but I'd like to try it hot off the grill. We added cilantro to the salsa for color but otherwise made it as recommended. Will make again.

This was a great summertime dinner! Couldn't find the red jalepenos either, but used a habenero and small green jalepeno. Quite a kick, but still sweet and smooth. My husband is a total food snob, and he totally inhaled this....

Rating: 3
i had to use wreck grouper instead of mahi-mahi (for some reason, new york city had a dearth of this fish in supermarkets--even dean & deluca was lacking!), so i think that undermined the contrast between the fish flavor and the tangy-sweet of the salsa. LOVED the salsa--i'd recommend 2 blood oranges instead of one; and since it was such a hit, maybe just double the entire salsa quantity overall.

Rating: 4
I loved this dish! It had great flavor and I did not feel guilty after eating it. I could not find a blood or Cara Cara orange so I used a navel which worked fine. I also could not find a red jalapeno so I just used a green. I am having the leftovers for lunch today today in a wrap.

This fish dish was very good. I get annoyed at reviewers who say they substituted one ingredient for another and the proceed to give the recipe a poor review. I love mahi-mahi and was all prepared to make it when I discovered that I forgot to buy the avocado. I went ahead and made it anyway. The salsa was really great and probably would have been outstandingly better with it. Anyway, the entire dish still was delish! I did have leftover salsa and put it in my dinner salad. What a difference it made!

so good!! i didn't have red onion, so i used a little bit of heirloom tomato and cilantro. also, i had some frozen mahi mahi filets from whole foods, which defrosted fantastically and all they needed was the olive oil, salt and pepper to make them taste as good (well, almost as good) as fresh filets. i served it with coconut-mango sticky basmati rice.

One of the best, freshest recipes I've made in a long time. I substituted nectarines for the oranges and added some chopped mint. We also marinated the fish in some orange juice, chopped garlic, mint, and a little olive oil. Perfect for a summer dinner party with some coconut rice, grilled veggies and lots of mojitos!

This dish was outstanding, although I had fresh-caught mahi, so that abviously helped. Blood oranges were not in season, so on a whim, I substituted a fuyu persimmon. The sweet-spicy flavor of the persimmon turned out to be a great compliment to the other salsa ingredients. I will certainly make this again.

This dish was AMAZING!!!! It was so easy to make and tasted better than we imagined. I added 1 teaspoon of cuban hot sauce and some fresh cilantro to the salsa to give it a little extra kick and omitted any salt on the fish. We bought frozen filets from Whole Foods (they flash freeze it so it's fresh fish) and it worked out perfectly! So perfectly that we're having friends over for dinner on Sunday and making it again!

This was delicious and very easy! I marinated the fish in some mango marinade before sautéing, and it added just a bit of extra flavor. I also mixed a little hot sauce in the salsa instead of using jalapeños, and it worked out well for a milder "kick". I served this with some coconut pineapple brown rice, and the meal was a big hit. Great recipe with plenty of potential for modification; I think I'll add some mango to the salsa next time for a different flavor. Recommended!

delicious! husband thought it was too orange-y, but i thought it was perfect. be careful to watch the mahi mahi, however, as it cooks quickly and can easily be overdone. left out the jalapeno and used hot sauce instead - still tastes delicious without having to deal with seeding and cutting the jalapeno. yum!

Good, but a little bland. It might be better if it were marinated in lime juice and/or orange juice, and if it were tossed in some of the salsa just before serving.

If you love fish that doensn't have a strong "fishy" taste to it, try this one. The Mahi Mahi was excellent and the salsa was a great compliment. I couldn't find either the cara cara or the blood oranges so I used just a regular orange instead. I will definitely make this one again and again.

I thought this was a good, fresh dish (although almost anything with avacado is good to me!)It was simple and fresh, I did have to use a regular orange, though.Although it would be better as a spring or summer dish, we would classify it as a "do-over."
