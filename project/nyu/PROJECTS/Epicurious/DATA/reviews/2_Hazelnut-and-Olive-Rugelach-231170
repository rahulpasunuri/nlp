I followed the directions in the first batch and these were very dry and didn't brown. I baked them at 350 (the recipe wasn't completely clear about that). I brushed on an egg wash to the second batch. These were better, but for the amount of work these are, I don't think they're worth it. Also, if they're cut the way the recipe says, they're much smaller than the picture would lead you to believe.

If you're not in a hurry, forget the parchment paper - should the dough get too soft, just pop the rugelach (at whatever stage) in the fridge for a few minutes. I bumped up the amount of the olives and the hazelnuts for a little more flavor and crunch. This is a delicious hors d'oeuvre for any occasion.

Very nice and unusual finger food. The pastry wasn't nearly the problem to roll out the I had thought. I used a floured tea towel under the dough and a floured rolling pin without anything between it and the dough itself. Would try it again with other fillings, perhaps sundried tomato pesto, black olive tapenade something with capers...
