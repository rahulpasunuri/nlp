I make this pound cake every year to use in the White Chocolate and Apricot Trifle recipe from Epicurious many years ago. It is a delicious pound cake and can be the base for many desserts. Sometimes I add a couple of teaspoons of almond extract.

I made this cake yesterday. It is okay. I found it to be a little too greasy for my taste. It is certainly NOT the best pound cake I've ever tasted. I have a recipe that I have used for 25 years that puts it to shame. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it about a 5. Decent, but not great.

I took the advice and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and eliminated 1 egg. May be that was the problem but it was boring and bland.REALLY bland and dense.

Fantastic recipe. Dense and moist. I made it on a whim and didn't have heavy cream or vanilla, so I warmed a cup of vanilla bean ice cream. Stunning flavor and richness overall. Easy to make, but definitely time consuming. Prep time was a solid hour of nonstop mixing. Clear your schedule; it will be worth it.

Fantastic. Made 5 for a bake sale during our Nursery festival in Forst Hill, LA. Sliced one for sample and sold by slices. Everyone loved it and next year will make more. Elvis fans bought. I enjoyed making the cake and did not mind sifting the flour, have 2 sou chefs in training, (grandbabies) they sift and measure and a good way to teach fractions. putting in cold oven, made 2 to bake at one time.

Before making this recipe, please understand the reason why it is called a "Pound cake" is because each ingredient put into the cake is a "pound" (flour, eggs, sugar, etc.). Dont be too shocked with the amount of sugar you see! Pound cake is suppose to be rich and sweet and dense-like. ;)

This cake is awesome. It is now my go to vanilla cake. Use vanilla bean paste and Wow!! The flavor and texture of the cake makes it a winner. Throw a piece on the grill top it with vanilla ice cream and OMG!! Heaven on a plate!!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but alas i was let down. The cake is very light and eggy, not like a pound cake at all, and the butter flavor of a traditional cake was missed....i did like the cake maybe for something else, but this recipe fails as pound cake....PS i did reduce the sugar to 2 cups as well and the sweetness was fine...

I have been testing pound cake recipes for over a year. For our family, this is a winner! The texture is moist and tender. The flavor is outstanding. We did not think it to be too sweet (but that is subjective). The only change I made is that I used vanilla sugar rather than plain granulated. I made my own vanilla sugar by blending, 1 cup of sugar with 2 vanilla beans and then mixing that with the remaining 1 lb. bag. My husband and son said that the cake tasted like vanilla ice cream. =)

loved the cake,the texture is awesome,and yes it did look like the pic above.I did make a few changes based on all the reviews,first,i halved the recipe coz i was trying it for the first time,second i added only 1cup of sugar(instead of 1-1/2c),the sweetnes was just right,not too overbearing.third i added only 3 eggs.The best thing about this cake is its texture.

Rating: 1
I can't understand all the raving reviews about this recipe. I give this cake 1 fork because it tasted good... but just for about two bites. Then it becomes too much.I should have known better when it asked for 3 cups flour AND 3 cups sugar. Way too sweet and rich! Also, difficult to get out of the mold so probably needs different instructions for preparing the pan. Doesn't freeze well either: strangely enough, the crust retains its crispiness, but the cake becomes almost pudding-like. I can imagine this recipe would really be loved by kids though.

This is perfect cake as it is, and I made it over 5 times including a twist. If you love green tea flavor, you can add green tea powder (I usually add 1-2Ts) in this cake and it comes out amazingly.

I made this pound cake tonight and I didn't have a bundt pan or a tube pan so I used 2 square 8 inch pans and although the top of the cakes got brown VERY quickly the cake was still out-of-this-world amazing. I can't stop eating it and neither can my roommates! We ate it with some ice cream and milk and it was amazing. Will definitely make again! P.S. by chance I didn't have more than a cup of cake flour on hand so I used all-purpose and it came out perfectly fine! I also subbed heavy cream for milk mixed with butter (I read online that it's a substitute)

Absolutely awesome pound cake. i've been searching for a decent pound cake for some time now and this is the best so far. the crumb is perfect. It is lacking in flavor. so i most definitely will be changing that up. I followed the suggested adjustments as others have and it came out ok. i personally like the flavor of sour cream coming out of my cakes so i partially subbed some in mine. Another thing i have done was make them in cupcake form. came out beautifully.

First of all let me say the cake was good...light, tasty, but definitely too sweet even though I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup per suggestions. But, it is NOT a pound cake...a real pound cake is just that...a pound of butter...flour, sugar and the balance is waaayyyy off here. The cream and cake flour give you a lovely crumb but this is a very eggy cake with none of the buttery flavor you get from a true pound cake recipe.

Yummm. A family favorite, and so easy. Keeps forever if well wrapped. Sometimes I fold in 4 oz bittersweet chocolate (plus dutch cocoa powder for extra intense chocolate flavor) into half the batter to make a marble poundcake.

Great pound cake recipe. I have made this recipe many times and I too cut back the sugar by 1/2 cup. The only other variation from the recipe I do is that I use sugar instead of flour after I butter the cake pan. That adds a little subtle texture to the exterior of the cake.

I made this today. Best pound cake ever! I did however cut back the sugar to 2 cups, added 1 tsp of almond flavoring as well and only used 6 eggs. I sifted 4 times the flour. The results one heck of a delicious pound cake. As my nephew said as he swallowed his 3td slice, " this is so delicious auntie, when will you be baking another". A note, it is important to take.the time and make sure you cream well the butter and eggs before adding the eggs. Your patience will be rewarded. Oh almost forgot, also added 1/2 tsp orange zest. Enjoy you won't regret it. The fun in baking is trying a recipe and make it your own or not

I found that it took more like an hour and 25 minuted almost 1 and 30. I was dissapointed because the toothpick came out dry and upon cutting into the cake it was somewhat undercooked. Was this because I used a bundt cake pan? Or possibly because the oven was cold to start?

I Made this cake for New Year's Eve and it was so delicious. I like to lick the spoon after mixing and the batter was amazing. My husband and friends loved it.

Just an addition to my FYI. If you want to see the recipe on Martha Stewart, go to her website, or just google Maple Pound Cake. It's the same recipe, and as I said before it is baked at 300 degrees in a cold oven but for 1 hour and 45 minutes (this would eliminate cake getting too dark on top, I would think). Comes out perfect. This time I combined lemon juice, lemon rind, a little butter and about a cup of powdered sugar. Poked holes with a fork and pour this over the hot cake. Yummmmmmmmmmmmy!

Just an FYI for this recipe. I have made it many times and it always comes out perfect. I think it's the best pound cake recipe I've ever made and I've made many. The FYI is that I first saw this recipe on Martha Stewart show. The recipe there differs in that it calls for 6 eggs, does not say to sift cake flour 3 times, and bakes at 300 degrees for 1 to 1 1/4 hours. It does call for a cold oven.

My mother was in town and this is her first Epicurious recipe attempt. It came out excellent!! She made the recipe exactly as is and it came out perfectly moist with great form and texture.

I made this cake today, I followed the directions to a Tee!!! I also followed what some of the other reviewers said and cut back on the sugar, I would have anyway it was way too much for me, I used 2and 1/4 cup of sugar, I also cut down on the eggs by 1 egg. The battered was creamy and smooth after I beat the #@%$ out of it as stated again by other reviewers. It was so delicious I wanted to eat the whole thing by myself (lol I didn't) I did make some coconut buttercream frosting and frost the middle and added fresh raspberries and strawberries. My husband and his parents, grandparent and sister all had seconds, heck I had seconds. this is my go to pound cake from now on it was moist and light. My husband wanted to know when I would be making it again. It was delicious by it self but with the addition of the frosting and berries my goodness!!!! LOVED IT!!!!!! I will have to add an additional 45 minutes to my workout regime tomorrow but well worth it. To all that is having trouble with it burning after about 20 mins I noticed mine was beatifully brown, I simply cover the top with aluminum foil Viola! problem solved.

After searching for a cake to make this weekend, I came across this one and decided to give this a go due to great reviews. I followed the instructions very well. It took me about an hour to make- I made my own baking flour, sifted and mixed using a handheld mixer. The mixture turned out very nice and creamy. I did butter the pan a lot and put in the cake for 350F. I checked at 40 minutes and the top was almost burned and cracked. One half turned out much higher than the other.. I did not preheat the oven as the instructions said not to. The top edges were burned as well. It came out of the pan easily and I cut off the burned edges and had a slice to try it. It tasted VERY sweet. I had to drink a glass of water right after that. I would serve this with BLACK coffee or tea. It did make me feel like I gained 10 pounds as the cake is very fattening. Due to that I give it an OK rating. It tastes boring eating it alone but adding anything sweet to it would just be an over kill for me. I wanted to see how the recipe actually is but I would suggest to cut back on the sugar, and take away one egg. Check the cake after half an hour.. it bakes a lot faster. I gave some to my husband to try and he was OK with it.I am not sure if I will make it again. I will sleep on it and try a little piece tomorrow to see if the texture and taste changed over night. It is not the best in my opinion.

This is the best pound cake I've ever made! I have made this cake probably 20 times since it came out on Gourmet. I get requests to make this cake all the time. It is rich, moist, and delicious. It tastes even better the next day, and if you put a slice in the toaster oven it creates a little bit of a caramelized crust on top... Yum! Highly recommended!

Unbelievable! The best pound cake in the history of mankind. I make it exactly as the recipe dictates and it turns out PERFECT. I like it sweet, so there's no way I would reduce the sugar. To "A Cook from Hendersonville, NC" who is having trouble with the top of her cake burning: Is it possible that your oven is set to "pre-heat" when you put the cake in the cold oven? Usually, when an oven's pre-heat function is in use, the top AND bottom elements are on, which would mean you're broiling the top of your cake. I believe the creator of this recipe intended for only the bottom element to be on. I do not know if you can turn that function off on your oven, but if not... perhaps bake the cake in a pre-heated oven or cover the top of your cake until the correct temperature is reached (and the top element turns off)...? I am not sure what else you could try, but maybe someone else has a suggestion or a different experience to share... Good luck. :)

I have made this cake several times. It reminds me of the consistency of a commercial pound cake but that is where the similarities end. The eggs and vanilla give this cake an honest homemade taste, it travels well, keeps for several days at room temperature, gets better with age, goes with fruit, heck the same qualities we should be looking for in a spouse or good friend. This is the ultimate pound cake.

I only thought I had the perfect pound cake recipe. I made this exactly by the directions ignoring the many references to "too much sugar." I was more intrigued with it being Elvis' favorite and wanted it exactly as it was created. This was beautiful and delicious! It was very moist, dense and filling. Up to this point the Ricotta pound cake recipe was my favorite but this is now #1 in my book!

Holy Nuts! I just made this and it is by faaaaaar the best pound cake I have ever had. It is SO LIGHT!!! Its the absolute opposite of your normal dense brick-like pound cake. Its amazing. As other comments suggested, I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 3, which is neccessary ( its almost too sweet with 2 1/2 cups (almost)), I coated the pan with sugar (great touch) and I whipped the (*)*& out of it. However, I used regular all-purpose flour (no cake flour at home) and it came out great anyway. I used salted butter to add the salty vs. sweet element that I like so much in my desserts and it added the slightest edge to the cake which I loved. Not salty at all, but it cuts the sweetness ever so slightly. This is officially a new go-to recipe!!!

I as well found it a little too sweet and will cut the sugar next time. Like Ava from San Sebastian, I drizzled a little spirits on top, bourbon in this case. I also cut the cup of cream with 1/4 to 1/3 bourbon. I do not have any electric mixer so I beat this thing by hand, which is a good way to work off some of its calories. The batter never seemed so satiny as stated but the texture of the cake doesn't seem to suffer. Difficult to get out of the pan, will use more butter next time. Delicous, but too sweet.

Though it isn't dense as a traditional pound cake, the fluffiness is a delightful change. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of subbing 1/2 tsp of almond extract for some of the vanilla. Thanks to the cooks who emphasized the heavy greasing of the pan- a definite must. And to those who suggested dusting the pan with sugar, which did add the scrumptious sugary crunch promised. Though the sifting and beating was tedious, it paid off with the most beautiful & shimmery batter I have ever seen. This recipe is a definite keeper, even for 'regular' cakes or even cupcakes for a very special occasion. Worth the full 4 forks indeed.

I've made this recipe 3 times and it comes out perfect each time. I use a "vintage" Kitchen-Aid 3C. When I am beating the final mix, I wait til the batter looks creamy and satiny. I substitute turbinado sugar for the refined that the recipe calls for, and it still bakes perfectly. The cake is a little darker in color than the photo. When I cream the eggs and sugar together... they never entirely incorporate due to the graininess of the sugar, but by the end... everything is smooth. I use two heavy loaf pans and bake for 1 hr 15min. Using a Kitchen-Aid probably helps to make it fool proof. No sweet streak, no falling batter here.

tried this recipe last weekend. it wasn't bad... it was moist enough, and had a lighter texture than your traditional pound cake, but i found it too sweet! i should have followed the suggestion of some to cut down on the sugar! i did use one less egg. and mine cooked in under 1 hour using 2 loaf pans. will definitely try it again next time with half a cup less sugar!

After reading the reviews about this being rather sweet, I used a 1/2 cup less sugar & it was perfect. Used a loaf pan & had extra- next time I will divide it equally between two pans.

This is my favourite pound cake recipe so far. I made 1/2 the recipe using 3 X- large eggs and baked it in a classic loaf pan and it turned out quite light and delicious. I didn't invert the cake in the end so I ended up with a bit of a dome top - but I like a crispy top on my cake so I left it as is. The only thing I might change in the recipe is the amount of sugar - next time I think I could reduce it by 1/8 to 1/4 cup less. Should have listened to previous reviewers!

Love this recipe--it is always a crowd pleaser. Two important notes: 1) 6 eggs instead of 7, as it can be a bit too eggy otherwise. 2) Cake flour is a must and makes a big difference. This recipe can also be halved and used to make a pound cake loaf in a loaf pan.

This is a good pound cake, though I can't agree that it is "the best pound cake we have ever tasted". I enjoyed making it, my end result was a bit dry which was puzzling...used my convection oven and wonder if that was an issue. I probably won't make it again, though this time was fun and the end result is pretty good--there are just better-tasting caloric splurges out there, even in other pound cake recipes.

I agree with all 4 forkers - simply the best pound cake and so easy to make. I will never buy one again. My 7 yr old helped with every step. The only time consuming thing about it is sifting the flour 3 times, but it is obviously worth it. I also used a handheld mixer but will pull out the standing one next time.

Really tasty, but I think I could have broken a window with the finished product. Followed the directions to the letter, but I had to guzzle down milk at every bite just to swallow; very dense and heavy. Everyone I served it too said it was fantastic, though, so maybe it's just me.

I have tried a few different recipes for pound cake before and I think I finally found a keeper. I had some extra strawberries in the fridge and was actually looking for another recipe when I stumbled on this. It was fabulous. The texture was just right, not too dense, not too light. It was perfectly golden in my Nordicware Bundt and the smell was heavenly. I think it would work well for a trifle also. I ended up pulling it out at about 55 minutes I think. Oh, and I tried it warm and it was heavenly!

While I had the same problem as fcast2721 with the top over-browning in a bundt pan, I also used a lamb cake mold for Easter and that one did fine. Even with the over-cooked top (due, apparently to a quirk with my Viking stove that I wasn't aware of) it was wonderful. I made the recipe as is but can see how mixing it up with extracts would be a nice option. This is fabulous with some strawberries and whipped cream. I've made several cakes from scratch and rarely do I find one that I will make again - this is right up there in my top 2 or 3 cakes that I am sure to make and share over and over again.

I made this recipe twice this weekend, once preheating the oven and once in a cold oven as the recipe suggests. The top of the cake browned a lot in the preheated oven. When I put the cake in a cold oven I had a different problem because my broil and bake elements go on to heat the oven quickly --I have a Viking. This burned the top before I could lower the Temp. Any suggestions on how to work around this? Loved the taste and texture.

WOW! This is an amazing pound cake. I sifted through many many recipes until deciding on this one and it's a hit! Very moist and the color is beautiful too. The extra sifting of the flour is well worth it so don't let that scare you away. I added 2 Tbsp of Sonoma Vanilla Almond simple syrup and cut the sugar called for in the recipe in half. When it was slightly cooled but still a warm I drizzled the syrup straight over the cake. Absolutely to die for!

I wasn't thrilled with sifting the cake flour three times, but the result was worth the effort. It was the best pound cake I've ever made.

Oh--I served it with berries, lemon curd, and whipped cream.

This cake is SO awesome! WOW! I took some of it to my pound cake loving grandmother and she asked that I please bring her more of it on my next visit. This cake was pretty much gone by day 2 in my house. The only thing I did different was instead of 2 teaspoons of vanilla, I did 1 of vanilla and the other half butter extract and half lemon extract. I also made a light icing for it. Great, great! YUM! I will be making this one on a regular basis. Thank you, thank you very much, Elvis!

I made this for the first time several years ago. I followed the recipe precisely but for 1 digression. I laced the baked cake with a drizzle of Bacardi Rum and a splash of Amoretto Di Saronna (almond liqueur). I left the the cake to cool in an open oven in the antique tin Italian Rococo "bundt-style" pan. The alcohol evaporates but leaves a gloriously romantic old world scent to this passionately delicious indulgence. Everyone LOVED it. I keep copies of the recipe on 3x5 cards because everyone asks for it. I've baked it for friends on Nantucket Island and family in Mayorca and the response is always the same...sheer ecstasy. Serve with chilled bubbly mineral water with a wedge of lime and a mint leaf. Unforgettable...

I've been making this recipe for years. My grandmother shared it with me and now I make it. To make it even more decadent, I make a cream cheese icing and for Christmas, sprinkle w/red and green sprinkles. Also, in the summer when I make it I do the icing and fill the center (from using bundt pan) w/fresh strawberries. I did this for my mom's birthday and everyone was in awww!!

I have made this cake more times than I can count (including today!) and I love it, but every once and awhile, it does not rise evenly for me. There might be a little volcano of batter thay seems to sputter from somewhere near the middle. I wonder if this is related to the "sweet streak" someone noted, and it seems related to the batter consistancy being uneven if I pour the batter ( the recipe suggests spooning). I also note the crust is sometimes sweeter and crunchier than others. I always butter and flour a nonstick bundt pan, some darker than others. Any thoughts about why this occurs?

My favorite and I get many requests to make it again. To the cook that asked about overbeating, yes, you do beat the heck out of this cake (thank God for my KitchenAid) but I believe that is to beat some volume into the eggs. Since you are using a low protein cake flour, it doesn't toughen it. Also, be sure and spray the heck out of your pan as this one really has a tendency to stick. I try not to use too ornate of a pan as they stick the worse. Sprayed with Pam, then butter Crisco and sprinked with fine bakers sugar and it gave it a nice crunchy coating.

This is the best pound cake recipe I have found to date. I even overbaked it a bit and it was still wonderful. I ate this plain, as did my family. They all forgot about adding the healthy fruit on top that I had prepared to eat with it!

This pound cake is phenomenal. Dense and moist, the perfect pound cake.

Someone help me please, I'm confused...aren't you supposed to not over-beat a cake batter once you've added the flour, given that it would lead to the release of flour's gluten, thus making the final product heavy???

I made this for my sister's birthday party and I am not kidding, people were FIGHTING to get seconds! It is truly amazing. The trick is not to think about how many calories must be in every crumb of it and just enjoy it, even as you listen to the sound of your arteries slamming shut. It is worth it.

I thought this was very good--dense and moist. It wasn't as sweet as I'd expected, so it is a good platform for other things (if I was serving alone, I might consider increasing the sugar). It is very easy to make--a good cake to have in your recipe box. It took longer to bake than indicated--I think a total of 1 hour, 25 minutes. Also, my tube pan has a removable bottom, so I lined it with foil--good thing because it leaked.

I made this for the first time in a rose shaped mold as I was visiting people whose last name is Rose. It was a tremendous success at a post- 4th family get- together. I covered it with whipped cream as there were a few flaws in releasing the cake from the mold and nobody noticed, but everyone loved the cake and the whipped cream. I'll make this again.

I've made this recipe about a dozen times exactly as written. Yesterday though, I left out one egg, reduced the sugar by about 1/4 c., added 1 t. baking powder, added about 1 T. lemon zest and brushed it with a lemon juice-sugar syrup when it was still hot. Divine! One less egg seemed to make it less "springy" in texture. Cooked it at 340 and it was done in 55 minutes. This cake is so much better than regular, dry, heavy, poundcake.

very moist cake and has a great flavor and the perfect crumb.Traditional pound cake has a larger crumb but this is finer and lighter. Next time I will cut back on the sugar since it was too sweet for my taste. 3 cups of sugar is alot but the cake is wonderful with the addition of the heavy cream. Can't wait to make it again

This is the best pound cake I've ever eaten. Period. I've baked many and I've purchased many, but this is the best. I did add extra vanilla, but other than that, I followed the recipe as it's written. I used this cake as the base for a strawberry short cake, and it worked wonderfully.

I added some fresh berries over the top of it when I served it -- really complemented them well. Highly recommend!

This cake is wonderful! I have been making it for years and my family loves it. I make it exactly like the recipe says and it comes out perfect all the time. Sometimes I add a little more butter. Maybe a fourth to a half of a stick more. I also mess around with different flavorings. Lately, I have been using vanilla, orange and lemon extracts. Sometimes I'll add butter flavoring and it is absolutely heavenly with any flavor. One thing I have been doing different is using Crisco to grease the pan. Butter makes the crust of the cake too dark. You will love this cake and your family will, too.

Looking for the quintessential pound cake? Look no further, this is the one. I followed the recipe exactly and oh what a wonderful result. Yes, it's a bit time consuming though not particularly difficult. My Kitchen Aid standing mixer freed my hands so most of the clean up was done when the cake went into the oven. I can't wait for summer strawberries. This cake with luscious berries & a dollop of fresh cream -- what's not to love.

What a delicious cake. I made this cake on yesterday and shared it with friends and there isn't a crumb remaining. There are several other Elvis Presley's Favorite Pound Cake recipes and some do not call for salt. Therefore I was reluctant to use the 3/4 teaspoons of salt and opted for a smaller amount. Use the recommended amount. The cake was a little sweet but was moist, had an excellent texture, is rich and the crust is wonderful just as other bakers have stated. I also used 1/4 teaspoon of almond along with the vanilla. This is a must keep recipe and I am difficult to please when it comes to pound cakes. Check your cake after 45 minutes because the 1-1/4 hours was too long. Cake was a little dark but taste did not suffer.

This cake is delicious and one of my family's favorites. It's good with berries and whipped cream, but great just sliced and eaten dry - that's how I like it best, with a cup of tea or coffee. It's moist, dense, rich, and sweet, and it does take quite a while to beat, but with a Kitchen Aid that's not a problem. Like other people have said, it's even better the next day.

Made this again as it is my favorite pound cake but decided to butter and sugar the bundt pan first. Had a little batter left over so I buttered and sugared a couple of little ramikins also. When the ramikins were done, I went to invert them and nothing happened. I had to dig them out of the dish!! Worried that the same fate was going to befall my bundt pan, I waited nervously as I was taking it with me that night. Luckly it was a non-stick bundt pan that I had sprayed well with Pam, then buttered, then dusted with fine bakers sugar. It came out very nice and the sugar left a nice mildly crunchy coating. Moral: if you want Elvis to leave the building, you can't spray the pan too much!!

My grandmother (Nanny) got this recipe out of a newspaper years ago and use to make this for us on special occacasions. I remember thinking this was her signature cake. I would ask for it all the time but she said it was too expensive to make. I wish she were still here with us today and I'd make it for her anytime she wanted it. This is the ultimate pound cake recipe. I always make this for special occasions (Thanksgiving, Christmas, birthdays) and it's always a hit. I also make a cream cheese icing to make it extra decadent. Then fill the middle with fresh strawberries. It's absolutely beautiful.

I made this cake for company and followed the directions exactly. It was delicious. Just the right texture, and I didn't get the egginess like others reported. I used baker's joy for the pan, and it came out beautifully. Next time I will try the sugar dusting and butter in the pan for a more crunchy crust. Nothing will ever be as good as my Georgia-born grandmother's secret family recipe, but this is the second best I have ever tasted.

Just made this. The name alone was worth the effort, anything Elvis is okay by me, and yes, he was a good kisser but I digress. :) Had my two little grand daughters over today to celebrate both of their birthdays and after reading this, I decided to make it for their dual birthday cake. It made a big batch, and was very silky as stated. I did the one slightly beaten egg at a time and did not have in my house cream, so, I used Pets evapo milk and crossed my fingers, expecting it to be devoid somehow. My baking time was a bit off cause the little dolls got here too soon but managed to send it home with mommy and daddy and the girls to eat in a few hours when they do get home. I just hope it actually set up as mine here was a bit gooey inside. I'd made two smaller ones for us to be able to enjoy here. Simply wonderful in flavor, not too eggy like others stated, very sweet as one said it wasn't. Don't have a bundt or tube pan so used what I did have. Will I make it again, there is no reason not to. Oh, also I did the suggestion of vanilla, almond and butter extracts, great flavor.

I agree about the egginess: baked it last night and found it unappetizingly eggy, but this morning,it's delicious, and exactly what I want from a poundcake: moist, rich, but not heavy. Will use again, but definitely ake the day before serving.

This is an EXCELLENT cake!!! I am not usually successful with my baking attempts, but this came out perfectly! I followed the instructions exactly until I came to the part about the pan. I don't have a bundt pan nor a tube pan without a removable bottom, so I split the batter in half and used two bread pans. The two cakes came out perfectly and I let them cook for one hour. Granted, this isn't as dense a pound cake as I'm used to eating, but I like this texture even better. I'm making a blueberry sauce to go with it and will serve it at a party tonight.

I've made this cake about a dozen times - always foolproof.

It was amazing!!

I'm completely disappointed and confused. Mine came out to taste like cornbread! Anybody know what I could have done wrong? I'm sure it's me. Only thing I can think of is that the store ran out of cake flour and the bakery dept suggested I use "organic pastry flour" which looked more white/tan in color. Do you think that was it? Could I have just used all-purpose flour instead and sifted 3 times? I love pound cake and made this for Valentine's yesterday and it was a total flop! Feedback appreciated. Thnaks!

My family loved this poundcake! It was a winner with everyone that has eaten it. At first it was eggy (eww), but by the next day, the eggyness had disappeared. The texture is fine and uniform. It was moist and flavorful. It freezes well. I am at high altitude 5280, and the only things I changed were weighing the flour (124 grams per cup), not letting the eggs sit out as long, a little almond extract in with the vanilla, and baking the recipe in 2 loaf pans (for about 45 minutes). In my opinion, baking it in a tube pan would have made the tops burn before the cake was done, or I would have had to use foil to stop the over browning. At 45 minutes it was golden and gorgeous. I also recommend using a piece of parchment paper for the bottom to assure a nice release. I used a name brand cake release product, and the outside edge didn't get as crusty as if I would have used shortening/butter and flour. So, use the shortening and the flour!!! It really deserves 3.5 forks. This would be a beautiful pound cake to make zuccotto. MMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm!

I first made this cake when the recipe appeared in the mag. My fam and thought it was fabulous! I made 3 this past Christmas, and they were excellent...such a pretty sight under a glass cake dome. If the texture was not right, or there was a "sweet streak" then obviously someone did not follow the recipe to the 9's. Mine have all been fine textured and dense, not at all eggy. Just as pound cake should be...perfect!

Rating: 2
Pound cakes are supposed to be dense and buttery, however I found this one to be a bit eggy. I made it twice, the second time with only 6 eggs which helped with the too eggy texture. The undercooked streak that a previous reviewer mentioned is often called a "sweet streak" the cake actually falls a little bit to produce this. Many people love the sweet streak. I think that the classic cream cheese and sour cream pound cakes found in most southern cookbooks are far superior to this recipe.

Rating: 4
Without a doubt, this is the very best pound cake ever. Elvis was discriminating....It's great plain, with french vanilla ice cream and homemade hot fudge sauce...but, the very best is with strawberries and freshly whipped cream. It's an absolutely wonderful recipe...enjoy it!

I followed this recipe exactly. It turned out well. I disagree that this is the best poundcake ever, because I expect a poundcake to be moist, rich, and somewhat heavy. This cake is too fluffy and light for that. However, I think this cake is a fluffy and delicious cake with a beautiful aroma. It has a slight egginess in both its texture and flavor. It's a cake worth making if one does not try to compare it to the classic poundcake. I should mention that I used one of the bundt pans without a hole that NordicWare makes for Williams-Sonoma (the sunflower pan, to be specific). I did have a slight stripe that looked a bit uncooked, but when we ate the cake, it was fine.

WOULD NEVER MAKE THIS CAKE AGAIN! DON'T WASTE YOUR INGREDIENTS! This pound cake most likely led to his demise... The instructions were followed perfectly. The room temperture butter and eggs were beaten for five minutes. Cake flour was sifted 3 times- not overbeaten. The Cake was very Heavy and no one in the house would eat it. There is no rising agent in the cake; I should have known better If this was Elvis' favorite pound cake. He had never had good pound cake in his life.

Unfortunately, they still sunk - but delicious anyway. Maybe next time I'll shave chocolate instead.

Loved the cake; except for the sifting, quite simple with a stand mixer. I did find buttering and flouring the bundt pan a bit of a nuisance and used "bakers secret" the second time and the outer crust is lighter and not crunchy. I also used 340 degrees in my convection oven instead of 350 the second time, as the top was a little dark, and quite cracked the first time.

This pound cake is awesome! I first found this recipe in 1973, in a bundt cake pan that I had purchased and they called it "Jackie O's" Pound Cake. The crust tastes like butter cookies and you can use any extract you like. I personally like it with two teaspoons of vanilla, a teaspoon of lemon and a teaspoon of orange. Everyone asks for the recipe. I simply love it!

It is really, really is good, even plain, all by itself, no adornments. It's so good, it's hard not to eat sliver after sliver. It's better than cooks illustrated pound cake, but when I made this cake the 2nd time, I borrowed the CI technique of slowly adding the lightly beaten eggs from a measuring cup, and that improved the texture even more. This recipe goes in my permanent collection.

This is the best pound cake recipe I've made, and people always ask for the recipe. The outside crust is crispy and super tasty.

My sister usually buys a cake at an expensive bakery where she gets a pound cake with chocolate frosting...her favorite. She requested this same combination as her birthday cake, so I used this recipe. I filled 9" cake pans half-full of batter and baked for 35 - 40 minutes in a 350 degree pre-heated oven. I then used the Chocolate Buttercream and Ganache recipes from "The Well-Decorated Cake" on this site to frost the layers. My sister said that this cake was even better than the one from the bakery! Made according to the directions, this cake develops a nicely carmelized crust and a soft, moist pound cake center. Quite simply the best pound cake recipe I've ever made!

I made this cake the night before a dinner party and served it the next evening with raspberries, blackberries, strawberries and whipped cream.

I really think this deserves 3 1/2 forks.I didn't have a tube pan so divided into two 1.5 liter loaf pans. The frothy batter overflowed terribly in the oven. The flavor was wonderful and the consistency more cake-like than a traditional pound cake. We served with a lemon curd and the extra sweetness of the cake was fine. Next time I'd make sure the pan (or pans) I used had ample headroom for significant expansion. I also followed suggestions of other reviewers and used 50% more vanilla.

Fantastic. Most pound cakes are so dense that they give me hiccups and make me crave milk. This one is a lot more delicate, elegant and fine-crumbed. It also has a bit more sugar than I'm used to, but a thin slice goes a long way - and the extra sugar creates an incredible, caramelized crust.

All the sifting and beating made this cake's texture light, smooth, and fluffy (not dense and buttery, which I happen to prefer). The crunchy crust was delicious, and the cake is especially lovely served with fruit (sliced persimmons were great with it). It's a large cake and a crowd-pleaser, but not my favorite pound cake. Considering that Elvis used Coca-Cola as a salad dressing, the King's endorsement does little to recommend it.[I followed the recipe to the letter, no variations.]

I made this cake last weekend and wanted to note that I had a bit of a problem in the baking. I followed all instructions to the letter, with the exception of using almond extract instead of vanilla, and using a bundt cake pan instead of a tube pan. I put the cake in the cold oven with the rack in the center, started the oven and within 10 minutes smelled the cake scorching. I moved the rack down one level....and then 10 minutes later one more level....the cake was completely done in 60 minutes. The top was darker than I would have liked, but still came out fine. It was well received, but you've got to remember, it's still a pound cake. It was dense, and moist, and I liked the slight almond flavor, but it's still a bit dull on it's own.....I'm not sure I would go through all of that sifting and beating again for a cake that I think should be covered in something. Maybe I'm just high maintenance!

Since pound cake was such a 50's/60's staple, those of us who grew up then view the perfect pound cake as the one their moms made. This is a very dense cake. My mom's was much lighter. I liked the cake very much, but I can't rave about it. Those served it seemed to enjoy it.

i've made this twice now. the first time using half anf half and whole milk (mostly milk) instead of heavy cream. Using these dairy products turns the cake into a sponge cake ... not too bad especially with the crunchy crust. 2nd time around i had the heavy cream and wow...a yummy pound cake i got. I'll make this again and next time try it with almond extract instead. And this one is going to put my christmas trifle over the top for sure this year!!!

This is an addendum to my earlier review. When I made this cake today, I only had 1/4 c. of cream. I made up the difference with fat-free half&half. The result is a very light, almost sponge-cake-like, texture. I'm wondering whether the cooks whose cakes weren't dense had substituted something else for the cream?

If Elvis made this cake a regular part of his diet it is no wonder he keeled over at, what, 43? I made this cake for my co-workers as a mid-morning snack, and they devoured it in 20 minutes (there are about 30 of us). All loved it, even after I recounted the list of ingredients. No surprise, they all had salads for lunch. Personally, I think the cake needs more vanilla. Still, the cake is quite good, as long as the slice is kept small and it's accompanied by a cup of coffee or tea (both unsweetened!). It would be terrific with some fresh fruit, as well (and if you're looking to knock someone off, add some whipped cream on top of the fruit).

Super duper good! No wonder it was Elvis' favorite! It was a very dense and rich cake - and was gone in 2 days! I was unsure about baking a cake in a cold oven first, but I followed the instructions. It turned out great!

Good pound cake but maybe a touch too sweet for my taste. Perhaps less sugar would sharpen the butter flavour. I will continue on my quest for finding the best pound cake, but this one's on the short list.

Even my husband liked this cake and he is not much of a cake/dessert person. Since I was serving it with raspberries, I replaced the vanilla with 1 teaspoon lemon extract and lemon zest which provided a nice light lemon flavor. I followed all other directions exactly and the cake had a wonderful texture. It was baked perfectly in my oven at hour. A great family or company recipe.

Really killer pound cake! Used Elvis's Favorite for the Grilled Poundcake with Balsamic Peaches recipe from this site. Outstanding!

I have made this cake three times in ten days. The first time it was under done (in an hour) so I kept upping the cooking time. Second try (75 minutes), slightly underdone but better. This last time, I forgot it in the oven and it baked 100 minutes. Came out fine. Each version of the cake got eaten immediately so apparently, even underdone, it is still delicious. Though baking time is long (I think 90 min. in my oven would be perfect), the prep time is only about 25 minutes. Great cake.

Despite misgivings about overbeating the eggs and especially the flour, I took the other reviews to heart. Boy am I glad I trust the folks out there! We waited until the cake was barely cool to the touch to take that first bite. Smooth, but dense. Firm and tasty. The crust is just yummy. Not the least bit greasy like some other pound cake recipes I've tried. I may cut down the sugar by about 1/2 cup next time - personal preference only. May try almond extract instead of vanilla. Definite keeper!

As long as you follow the directions and cream the mixtures as directed this will be a wonderful dessert. We made this at my school and it was great!. Just remember it takes about 3 hours from start to finish

Made this for a party and it was a big hit. The crust comes out wonderfully caramelized and slightly crunchy while the inside is dense and smooth. I substituted 1 teaspoon of almond extract for the vanilla the second time for variation that I prefer. will definitely make again.

The first time I served this with raspberries and blackberries, mashing the berries with a little sugar. The berry juice soaked into the cake - it was devine! I froze the remainder of the cake and served it a couple of weeks later with fresh peaches. Again, delicious, rich, moist and dense. Follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed!

This was really really good. Everyone said that it was the best pound cake they'd ever tasted. So goood. The cake wasn't light or airy at all; it was VERY rich and dense.

The texture of this cake compared with what is considered the very best pound cake-Entimens. However, the flavor left something to bed desired. I changed the vanilla to lemon in the second attempt and that was beyond compare

This cake was delicious and worth every calorie. Be sure to follow the directions exactly with respect to sifting and mixing.

Delicious! Great instructions make this wonderful light pound cake easy to make. I baked it in a generously buttered and floured shiny 10-inch tube pan (without removable bottom) and it came out perfect. I highly recommend this recipe for a beginner or an experieneced home baker. An A+ recipe that I will make often.

Hmmm. I'm puzzled by the reviewer who found this cake to be too light and airy. I made it following the recipe exactly, and it was moist, dense, and so buttery that my husband and i couldn't stop cutting little slivers off until it was nothing but a pleasant memory. I really love this cake and will make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it did come out the way it was supposed to I guess, but it certainly wasn't close to the best pound cake I've ever tasted. I like a pound cake to be heavy, dense, rich and delicious. This was light and airy -- no surprise since the flour needed a triple sifting -- which is not at all what I like in a pound cake. I salvaged it by topping it with the Chocolate Mocha Sauce from the Dulce de Leche pie recipe on this web site. It made a HUGE difference and my guests loved it. But I won't make this again, and will continue to search for a recipe for a true heavy pound cake.

Followed the recipe exactly, down to starting with a cold oven. It turned out perfectly! A co-worker-who is quite the cake aficionado-proclaimed this to be the best pound cake she ever tasted!

Excellent recipe. I didn't have cake flour therefore I used for each cup of cake flour 7/8 cup of regular white flour and worked out perfect.

Excellent cake, moist and delicious. My only mistake, was I preheated the oven so the eventual bottom was very dark.
