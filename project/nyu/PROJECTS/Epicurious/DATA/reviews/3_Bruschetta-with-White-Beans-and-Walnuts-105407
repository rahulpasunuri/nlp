This is a great dip to bring to dinner parties! Simple, delicious, and quite the hit with guests.

An excellent accompaniment for a stew, soup or salad. As you can confirm by reading the other reviews, the trickiest part is getting the amount of garlic right: too little and it's bland too much is overpowering. Since garlic varies, start by adding less than called for and GRADUALLY add SMALL amounts.

Simple and delicious. I will roast the garlic next time. It was a bit overpowering raw.
