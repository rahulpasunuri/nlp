This sauce was alright on the steak but I found that it overpowered the mushrooms. Chinese five-spice powder has a distinctive somewhat clove/allspice like flavor and it wasn't our favorite with the mushrooms. Think I'll try a different recipe for future shitake purchases.

We thought this was a good recipe but not close to a WOW! I served it with a baked potato and it would have been a better dinner if I had served it with something to match the cuisine.

We enjoy this, but use slightly less 5 Spice.

This dish was good as written, but the Chinese 5 Spice powder was a bit overwhelming. The second time I made it, without the Chinese 5 Spice powder, the reviews from family and guests were fantastic.

Awesome! I used portobellos and added zucchini - this was really tasty.

I subbed eggplant for the mushrooms and bok choy and it was wonderful! Leftovers made great sandwiches on sourdough bread with fresh tomato slices.

very good - We love hoisin with lamb so I used lamb shoulder chops rather than steak, and threw a couple of thick slices of red onion on the grill also. Easy and quick to put together.
