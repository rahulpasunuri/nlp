These were pretty good. They were very quick and easy to make, but a little on the bland side. I might add fresh pico and/or guacamole next time for an extra kick.

LIKE A LAZY EGGS BENEDICT. This is one of those "the sum is greater than the parts" dishes. Maybe 4 stars is over doing it a bit...but this is REALLY good for almost no work. I didn't even butter the toast....put in toaster and topped with sunny side up egg...the top cooks under the cheese when you pop it under the broiler. Great quick light supper with a bowl of soup....or easy brunch dish. I really liked these. Served with sliced tomatoes on the side. So good. Is going to be my regular easy comfort food supper.

Made with poached eggs on english muffins...Mexican eggs benedict? Put the avocado slices under the eggs, cause they just slide off the tops. Still, I think it would be easier to be sure everything is hot enough if you use fried eggs. Quick and easy breakfast if you're looking for a way to use up that ripe avocado.

Quick, easy, packed with flavor and overall interesting. I added Canadian bacon. Thinly sliced tomatoes would also be a good addition.

Not beyond compare, but better than delicious. Fork system doesn't work for this. Works well with poached eggs, too. Partially poach ahead of time, keep in cold water, drain, top with cheese, run under broiler, put on toast. Can serve these to a mob.
