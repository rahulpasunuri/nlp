Excellent preparation for salmon. Simple, easy, and delicious! My husband says it's the best salmon he's ever had, and my dog likes that I don't set off the smoke alarm in our apartment. :)

I made this recipe twice. The first time I used farm raised salmon from Costco and the second time I used wild Atlantic salmon from Whole Foods. Let me tell you that it makes a huge difference what kind of salmon you use. Only wild. This is the easiest and most delicious mid-week dinner ever. Serve with rice pilav and an easy salad. Bon appetit!

Really fantastic. It's a weeknight and my boyfriend is out of town, so I made this with one piece of fish but kept the same quantity of oil and really layered it on; so worth it. With some steamed asparagus and arugula tossed in a lemon-dijon dressing, the meal was delicious and totally healthy. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious and will absolutely be my go-to method of preparing salmon. It just doesn't get any easier, and with minimal clean-up. Perfect recipe.

Made this with a friend the other day. Not only was it beyond easy, but it was divine! It was much better than I thought, I alot more flavorful too. And it reminds me how every piece of salmon should be slowroasted. It makes a world of difference. Enjoy! Just make sure to get quality fish.

This was so easy and so delicious! It tasted like something I would get in a restaurant. I think this is my new favorite recipe.

Delicious. I am not usually a great salmon fan, but this recipe came out perfectly - the fish was so moist and buttery in texture, it was perfect. The thyme & lemon zest gave the salmon just enough flavor. Did not taste the least bit "fishy." Would definitely make this again - so easy!

this is a delicious, simple recipe. i made it as written, and the flavor is of lemon-herb oil. i thought my 3 kids (ages 7-4) wouldn't eat it, but surprised me by gobbling it up.

Forgot to mention in previous review--used an almost two pound salmon, skin removed. Did not cut into smaller fillets. Just baked nice and slow for about 22 minutes.

An extra fork for being soooo easy. Yum!

Made this tonight. Excellent! Didn't use any olive oil because salmon is already so rich and upped the amount of thyme. Husband and I loved the creamy texture and smooth taste. We'll be making this one again.

I used one large (1.5 pound) fillet for this recipe. I followed the directions exactly (except using a large piece rather than small ones) and cooked the filet for 25 minutes. It tasted fabulous and the texture was fine. I would definitely make this again.

Really quick, easy, healthy, and delicious. The lemon zest adds a nice kick that is a bit different than the typical lemon juice from a wedge.

Tender and delicious cooked this way. Use only fresh herbs and best olive oil to get the full effect of this one. Did add some lemon thyme and used Meyer lemons.

There's no other way to say this...the lovely wild salmon I always buy was just gross cooked this way. We ended up putting the filets back in the oven at a higher temp and cooking them as usual. I agree with the last reviewer, there is absolutely no texture when they're slow-baked like this.

Sorry to disagree with so many. I consider myself a very experienced cook, but this recipe disappointed me. The Salmon came out almost mushy. It as cooked, yes, but too soft for me. The flavor was ok but the texture was far too soft for me. If you want an extremely moist, tasty fish, this is for you. I prefer a bit of texture.

The lemon and thyme weren't anything extraordinary but the slow cooking at a lower temp resulted in an amazing dinner. The salmon filets were tender and flavorful without any of the fishiness salmon gets if it is even slightly overcooked. Even the thin ends of the filets were still moist and tender. I will never cook salmon another way again. It was even more moist and tender than when I make salmon en papillote.

Delicious! Served it at a dinner party with a side of Chickpea and Charred-Tomato Farfalle Pasta, and all of my guests loved it! I will definitely make this again! I did make the following changes to amp up the flavor: 1. Added 1 Tbls melted butter to the olive oil, lemon zest, thyme mixture. 2. Used 2 Tbls. thyme. 3.Added 1 clove of garlic (minced) to the olive oil, butter, lemon zest and thyme mixture. 4. Cooked for almost 20 minutes because my salmon had some pretty thick sections

I have just moved out into my first house and started finally cooking and for never really cooking it is an easy recipe to follow and delicious!! Excellent recipe i decided to add some cut up green peppers and cooked those and added to the oven portion and came out very well!

I doubled the thyme mixture quantities and added some minced garlic based on other reviews. To be honest I couldn't really imagine how such a simple recipe could be so delicious, and was blown away by how the first bite fell apart in my mouth. Super yummy! Have already shared with family and will definitely make this for guests.

Excellent, easy, healthy. I'm learning to love fish, well non-sushi fish (I realize it usually works the other way around!) and I really enjoyed this meal!

This is an amazing salmon recipe. I made two additions: added a fresh, finely chopped garlic clove and 1 T butter to the olive oil/thyme mixture. YUM. Have made it several times with rave reviews.

Great go-to salmon recipe. Flavor good, texture good, color good. Tested it on myself, would be proud to serve this to guests.

Excellent way to cook salmon in general (low heat). Makes it easy to achieve nice pink opaque center without drying the fish out. I added some minced garlic.

Very good, omitted salt (on a low sodium regiment) and didn't miss it all! Served with a side salad and found that 1 piece wasn't quite enough fish for 1 person without anything else on the plate--like a starch. I ate 1.5 pieces and had the remainder the next day at lunch--just as delicious!

4 Forks with a suggestion from previous review/minor change to the original. Coated salmon in generous coating of mixture as advised and added Panko as well. Broiled under high for the last few minutes to crisp the panko and it turned out amazing! So tender and flakey, highly reccommended method of cooking salmon

I added breadcrumbs to the top and it really made a difference

Easy, simple and good. Had with a greek salad for dinner which was the perfect compliment to citrus and herb flavors in this dish. Only 3 forks as written since we found ourselves wishing there was more of the lemon-thyme topping, but that's easily fixed.
