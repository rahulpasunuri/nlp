I loved this recipe. I am always looking for ways to pair my desire to eat healthily with my husband's desire to eat things like pizza and wings. This was perfect. The tapenade really added just the right about of savoriness to make this an instant favorite.

Delicious...I make these pizzas over and over again. Getting ready to have them Superbowl weekend!

There are only two in our household. We will get three meals out of this recipe. We have found that we prefer it reheated the next day. This gives all of the herbs and the tapenade some time to marinate together.

Excellent recipe with a good, if strong, flavor balance. The eggplant made it taste quite meaty too. What a satisfying meal!

This was a very easy and delicious meal. However, I forgot to add the tapenade which was a shame since it needed that kick.

I substituted boboli for the crust and grilled it on the top side before putting on the toppings. Great vegetarian pizza. I made 1/3 the recipe for the two of us and we had half left over. Great flavor! I served this with a simple salad.
