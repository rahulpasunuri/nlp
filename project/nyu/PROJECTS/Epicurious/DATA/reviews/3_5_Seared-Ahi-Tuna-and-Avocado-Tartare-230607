I forgot the lime juice, but it was still very, very good. I agree with some of the others -- that the tuna didn't need to be seared at all. Nonetheless, I seared the tuna as directed, and still had a raw center. One thing I will say though - the author of the recipe says it's "uncomplicated", and it isn't really, but it does take some time since prep work is involved. You can't just throw this together in 10 minutes.

Pretty good. I added some sesame seeds and served it on some rice crackers. Quick and easy to make.

I made this recipe exactly as written. First, the cooking time on the tuna is WAY off. I seared my tuna about half the time recommended - a nice thick piece - and it was still almost overcooked. Also, the cilantro and lime are both overwhelming to the dish. I couldn't taste the tuna at all. If I end up making this again, I'll cut both lime and cilantro in half, if not less.

I changed this recipe quite a bit so I'm not rating it. But, I found my version delectable. I lightly seared the ahi tuna steaks, less than 30 seconds per side. Would have been better if I just left it raw though. I would say that if you want to sear the tuna, only do it for 5-10 seconds per side. I mixed 1 garlic clove, dried cilantro, dried oregano, about 1 tablespoon of lime juice, all the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and 5 peppadew peppers; mixed it in with the avocado. Finally mixed it in with the tuna. The avocado was fantastic; tuna would have been better raw as I said before. I served it with a bit of brown rice flavored with vegetable broth, lime juice, ciantro, and oregano.

This was an easy and excellent recipe for tuna tartare. I did use sesame oil, instead of olive. Family loved it!

Made exactly as written -- it was just okay for me. Would probably have been better if the tuna was completely raw. There are better uses for sushi grade tuna.

wait wait wait!!!! This had WAY too much lime...the acidity of the lime cooked the tuna right away so you have beige tuna...I always use raw for a Tartare as that is what tartare is and I ruined a 25 dollar piece of tuna because it literally was inedible with all the lime. I cannot believe that no one else reviewing said this. I just got back from 21 and had their tartar and it was pink and beautiful..this is what inspired me to make it for new years eve...I had to throw it out ....this was just horrible...Also I would double at the very least the amount of tuna and use a little less cilantro though that wasn't the issue...it just doesnt work...I am in awe of all the great reviews...I do like the idea of sesame oil but I was out of that...Seriously though...a quarter of the lime would have been enough. Similar recipes put a tablespoon of lime...ingredients are fine but just totally wrong proportions...

This was really good and very easy to make. I used sesame seed oil instead of olive. I only briefly seared the tuna (30 seconds per side) and I used 3 small serrano peppers. I also added some toasted sesame seed oil and sesame seeds. Goes really well on bread. Had corn as a side and a spinach salad.

I made some changes and I loved it! First, I didn't sear the tuna, I just chopped it up raw. Then I added chopped tomatoes (just the meat without the seeds) and corn. It ended up being more of a ceviche/salsa but it was wonderful! Even people in my family who don't eat fish came back for more!

This is very good but next time less cilantro and more tuna. I lightly seared so it was close to raw but we bought premium grade ahi. It's hard to stop eating. I used a whole jalapeno and the result was not spicy at all.

Very nice and quite easy. Seared the tuna quickly,leaving very pink and colorful inside. Used dash of black sesame oil for the sear and as a finish. Topped with kosher salt, toasted black sesame seeds and dash of Japanese soup seasoning, (seaweed,sesame and egg)

Great! I didn't have a serrano, so used a little bit of chipotle in adobo sauce. Ate with good corn tortillas - a wonderful, light, healthy meal.

I also, as a previous reviewer, seared this in sesame oil (very lightly -- about 30 secs on a 1.5" steak), and I also replaced the olive oil with sesame in the mix. I used only 1/2 jalepeno because the one I had was VERY picante! I sprinkled Hawaiian black sea salt on top for a beautiful contrast. I forgot the oregano. Will try next time.

This is amazing. I eat it like tuna salad with some bread. Add more peepers or use habs if you like things spicy.

This dish is really good. My family gobbles it up and now requests it for every party. I serve it with endive instead of crackers. Its healthier and it looks nice.

I doubled the recipe because I wanted to serve it as a light supper on a bed of greens. I used sushi-grade tuna, chopped in larger chunks and just barely seared the outside. I also used less onion to keep it from being overpowering but doubled the jalapeno because you can barely taste the spice. Be sure to use firm avocados or the dish will get mushy. Also using fresh ingredients really made it tasty. Next time, I'll make it as a dip for a party and see how it tastes that way.

I made a variation on this recipe for a light dinner. I seared the salted and peppered tuna lightly in some minced ginger and sesame oil. Then I diced it (in bigger chunks than the recipe calls for) and mixed it with 1/2 a mango, an avacado, the red onion, and lemon juice (I did not have a lime). I did not have any fresh peppers, so I added about a teaspoon or so of cayenne pepper. Served on a bed of greens, this was a very tasty and satisfying dinner. If you are serving the tuna in bigger chunks like this it is important not to overcook it as it will become flaky.

I'm not much for anything raw, but my girlfriend is a sushi fiend and really gobbles this recipe up. I've made it twice. Next time I might double the pepper or add cayenne, because it's not very spicy as is. It's better after sitting in the fridge than it is right away.

Come on people! give me a freakin´ break. SEARED TUNA TARTARE? I thought tartare is raw! What the hell´s next? Broiled carpaccio? Poached sushi? Due to lack of gastronomic culture, you guys have to copy, change, remodel everything. Just stick to your meat loafs and sloppy johns, or whatever that is called...

Very flavorful. Fresh summer dish. We added ripe diced fresh mangos which helped seal the flavors together. We didn't care for the oregano or chiles though. The lime is a must!

Absolutely delicious and impressive. I have to double the recipe (at least). Don't over cook the tuna -- 90 seconds searing per side does the job.

This is great. I have made this several times for my girlfriend, and it makes just a really nice, cool meal. I have added a bit of cayenne pepper and a little bit of minced garlic to the mix, and I guess I don't measure all that precisely. I can't recall if the recipe calls for cilantro, but I sometimes add a bit of that in as well with some tomatoes. Really tasty.

This tartare was a hit when I served it at a dinner party - everyone raved about it. I served it aside round tortilla chips as the recipe suggests. Be careful when mixing the ingredients as it can easily turn into a mushy looking mess. Tastes great the next day when properly refrigerated.

Delicious. Next time, I'm going to sear the tuna for only half of the recommended time though. This dish was tasty, but tasted even better the second day: make it a day ahead.

I made this dish as an appetizer for our Easter dinner. It was very well received by all our guests. The piece of tuna that I bought was quite thick, so the searing only really affected the outside, and left the center essentially raw. I also used very high quality spices (Penzey's).

i felt this dish was a bit flavorless. my thoughts are it might be in part to the fact that the tuna is seared. i have had other similar dishes where the tuna is just diced raw and they have been much better. the searing , in my mind, does not allow for the tuna to absorb all the flavors that are mixed together. in fact, the searing keeps them out. i might try again with raw tuna but have other recipes that are much more flavorful.

This was amazing. Two of us polished off the whole recipe (made as an ap) and skipped dinner.

Just made this for a party - to rave reviews. Watch the onion, mine was strong so I only put in about 1/2. Great make ahead party dish.

I seared the tuna so that it was rare inside and topped it with the avocado salsa. I added some chopped tomato, but otherwise prepared it as it was written. It was delicious! Will definitely prepare again.
