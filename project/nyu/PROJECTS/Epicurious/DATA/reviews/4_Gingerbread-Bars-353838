I followed the recipe exactly, but still the bars came out too dry. They were also not quite spicy enough for my taste. If I did this recipe again, I would double the spices and use less flour or bake for less than 22 mins. I placed them in a ziplock bag with a slice of apple overnight. We'll see if that moistened them up a bit when I get home from work....

Great recipe that comes together in a pinch! I doubled all the spices and reduced baking time to 18 minutes in a 13x9 pan as per other reviewers. Came out super flavorful and chewy! My new go-to holiday cookie/bar/cake/brownie.

Bake these like brownies rather than like a cake to avoid their drying out.

Delicious. A little cakier than I was expecting, but that was a pleasant surprise. I love gingerbread, and these little babies live up to all expectations. I substituted the ground cloves for ground black pepper (because I didn't have ground cloves) and that added an extra spicy kick. I also added apple slices (because I had an apple), but I might make them without the apple next time. It's nice, but the full-out ginger flavor is better. Definitely cut these bars into small squares - they are quite rich, and then you can have four or five without feeling like too much of a glutton.

I just made these for the first time. What an easy and delicious recipe! I've always been intimidated by gingerbread. This recipe couldn't be easier. I baked it in round cake pans and cut it into wedges for serving. It looks great and is super flavorful and moist. I was a little heavy- handed with the ginger, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely make it again closer to the holidays.

Gingerbread brownies! Used 9.5 X 13.5-inch pan and baked for 22 minutes. Amped up spices; no powdered ginger but added maybe 1/2 cup of very moist candied ginger from King Arthur Flour Co. Wonderful chewy texture. Sprinkled sugar but no flour on top (sounded too weird). I thought they'd need a frosting, but they are great as is.

These are good bars but not truly great in my opinion. I took the advice of previous reviewers and doubled the spices, which these definitely need. Similar to a previous reviewer, I found these dry even though I cut the cooking time down. I also found the batter very hard to spread in the pan - it was quite sticky. These need a little something on top - I'll throw some chopped candied ginger on next time.

Let me start by saying the flavor of these are delicious and I love the ease of them...but I made them twice, followed the recipe to a T and both times they were dry.(and I am a skilled baker) The second time I even dropped the time by 5 minutes. So I will try one more time, since most reviews said they used a 13 x 9, to make a moist chewy cookie. Even dry every last one was eaten.

This was wonderful and everybody loved it! I baked it in gingerbread men molds and then made them into ice cream sandwiches, decorating the top to make it look like a gingerbread man. Very Christmas-y, very cute, and very yummy!

I followed someone else's recommendation and doubled the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Instead of doubling the ginger I added some candied ginger and freshly grated ginger. And I used full flavor molasses so I cut the amount in half. Everyone at the holiday party raved about them!

Yummy and easy. I doubled the spices (I always do for gingerbread) and I didn't have dark brown sugar on-hand so I used light. Used 9x13 pan and still was done after 22 min.

Yum yum. I made these for Christmas cookies, using a 9x13" pan. They are so delicious that everyone wants the recipe. Perfect amount of spices. I mixed in my Kitchen Aide, no problem!

Really yummy!! I used these to simulate the Starbucks Cranberry Bliss Bars, since the ones in Canada are much more Gingerbread-y than the copy cat recipes I've found online - such a great recipe! Saves me about $50 over the holiday season buying them at 2 bucks a pop from Starbucks!

These gingerbread bars were excellent. I served them with home-made lemon-buttermilk ice cream, and they were the PERFECT compliment. Everybody loved them, and even the daintier eaters in the group G.O.B.B.L.E.D. them up.

Awesome, super easy. I don't have a mixer, so I just stirred by hand, and everything came out fine. I also used a 13x9 pan since that's the closest I had. Chewy, sweet...satisfying in a very small yummy portion.

These were delicious and so easy to make. I didn't change one thing from recipe...I thought it was perfect as is!

Everyone loved these! I made them with spelt flour, added 1 additional tsp. dried ginger, and made them into ice cream sandwiches. Easy to make, too.

These were delicious! I tasted the batter and found them not quite ginger-y enough, so I added 2 teaspoons of freshly grated ginger. They looked exactly like blondies - cracked on the top and slightly in from the edges of the pan. I am wheat and dairy intolerant so I also made a few substitutions to fit my diet (see these on The Mini Canteen Blog), but it was such a success I still gave it four forks.
