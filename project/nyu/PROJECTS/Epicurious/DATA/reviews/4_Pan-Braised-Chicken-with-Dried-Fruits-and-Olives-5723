It was very good, but it lacked a little flavor. I would add more olives and perhaps a tiny bit of cayenne would also help cut/accent the sweetness.

Fantastic. I used chili-encrusted dried mangoes from Trader's Joe's because I had some left over in pantry, and it was superb. Other fruit might be just as good.

Delicious! I used prunes, cherries and mangoes. Next time I'll double the broth and wine. Served this with barley.

Very easy to make, and very good! Prepared for a dinner party with one guest who is gluten-free, and she loved it and asked for the recipe.

wow, this was superb. The sauce was great on its own, but a bit sweet for my taste, so added a little bit of lemon zest and a bit of olive brine juice towards the end, which balanced it out perfectly. Definitely a keeper.

The Washington Post recently reprinted this recipe, incorporating the suggestions from the reviewers. The result was...well...WONDERFU L! Try it for yourself and see! http://projects.washi ngtonpost.com/recipes /2008/04/09/pan- braised-chicken- dried-fruits-and- olives/

I've made this dish several times for company and it's always a hit. It's easy to prepare, smells wonderful and the flavors are instense without being overpowering. I've used dried cranberries, apricots, peaches, apples, prunes...any kind of fruit works. I do recommend pounding the chicken into cutlets ahead of time since it allows them to really take in the flavor and become even more tender.

Very interesting, delicious. I used dried cherries and prunes along with large green olives stuffed with almonds. As another reviewer suggested, I cut the chicken into large cubes and removed it from the pan before reducing the sauce. Then, leaving the sauce on a low simmer while we ate our soup resulted in a nicely thickened, flavorful sauce. I will likely increase the cumin a bit next time. Great, easy recipe

Better than any other Marabella recipe. Followed it exactly using dried apricots, plums, pears, apples & golden raisins. Used good stock and Sauvignon Blanc for the white wine (so fruity - great choice). Served over brown rice studded w/almonds. Quadrupled for 12 people. Everyone wanted the recipe.

I made this dish last night for myself and 3 of my girlfriends for movie night. I doubled the entire recipe and then used some of the other reviews tips: used an extra clove of garlic, used a mix of golden raisins, dates, apricots and prunes and added a teaspoon of flour to thicken the sauce a bit. My girlfriends loved it and all asked me to email them this recipe and they don't really like to cook which is why I always bring the main dish! I love this website!

The sauce is great! Here are some ideas for making recipe better: Use 3 garlic cloves. Use mixture of dried apples, apricots, cranberries, figs, prunes and plums. Double wine and broth. Once you've added fruit, wine and liquids, pop in a 375 degree F oven for 15 minutes or so -- chicken will cook more evenly. OR, use pork instead. The dried fruit (especially prunes) seems more appropriate with pork chops or cutlets. Try this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/105363. Make your sauce in separate pan, add pork at last minute and plate.

while not as good as a stewed tagine, it satisfied my craving for north african flavors on a weeknight. very quick, which is always helpful. i added a minced shallot, would have added a touch more garlic and a combo of cumin, coriander, fennel, maybe a bit of cardamom to get more complex flavor. IMO, prunes, apricots and figs really are essential dried fruits for this recipe.

Just made it for the first time, and it's a keeper. I left out the olives because we didn't have any (one of those dinners where I was casting about for something to make with ingredients on hand) and used dried pears, cherries and golden raisins. Added a bay leaf after consulting the original recipe in Silver Palate, and pre-soaked the dried fruit in the chicken broth. Served with roasted golden potatoes and steamed broccoli with lemon zest. yum.

This is delicious, fast and easy. Next time I would add more liquid because it wasn't quite saucy enough for me after reducing but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. I used a combination of dried apricots, cherries and prunes and made sure the chicken was well seasoned (as in, I didn't measure). Served with lemon scallion whole wheat couscous, steamed carrots tossed with butter and parsley and a bottle of Syrah. Wonderful...

This was really tasty. I did have to added some flour to the sauce to get it to thicken but otherwise just doubled the recipe. Would absolutly make again.

This is great as a left-over, cut up into chunks and served over pasta.

I love this dish-- its great for either a weeknight dinner or for company. I altered the recipe a little bit-- I tossed the chicken breast (in pieces just larger then bite size) in the salt, pepper and cumin and then sauteed them til browned and almost cooked through then removed them from the pan and continued with the recipe. I added them back in towards the end ensuring the they were not over-cooked. I also more then doubled the amount of olives and added extra cumin and garlic. I used apricots and prunes. I also kept adding wine as it cooked in order to ensure the fruit was cooked beyond tender. This is one of my favorites.

Delicious BUT....boneless chicken breasts being what they are--relatively tasteless--I'm wondering if anyone has tried it with thighs, breasts bone-in, etc.?

Tasty, tender chicken. The sauce is really flavorful, and I was surprised how well the dried fruits and olives went together, even though I normally despise olives. I tripled the recipe in a large skillet and had no problems.

Wow - great flavor & aroma! My husband made this for a casual evening dinner yet we felt pretty gourmet after a bite or two. We made it again last night for friends who also raved and asked for the recipe. Use any mixed fruits - we used a pre-mixed blend from Sunmaid the first time, then last night used prunes and figs. Both fantastic choices, I don't think it matters which fruits you use. We also used cheap, supermarket brand green olives with pimentos the first time and they worked just as well as fancy stone-cracked which we used last night.

This dish was fantastic! I made it for a Passover dinner. I had a 1/2 an hour to whip something up after work and before the seder. This dish was so easy and quick that I was done in about 25 mins. I quadrupled the recipe, pounded the chicken breasts thinner so that they would cook faster and used prunes and apricots for the fruits. I got raves from all my guests!

Pretty good, but not great. I used dried cranberries, dates, and golden raisins. I also used orange juice instead of the broth, which may have been a bad idea; it made the olives stand out a bit too much. Next time I'll try it as written. The cumin went really nicely with the fruits. My husband like this a lot better than I did; he would have given it 3 forks.

I doubled the recipe and made this with a mix of dried apricots, prunes, figs, and pears. It was absolutely delicious, my husband and I finished all of it in one sitting. Garlic and olive oil couscous and plain boiled carrots were perfect accompaniments. The sauce is rich and sweet and savory, I would definitely make for company.

This was the first recipe I ever made from epicurious.com, and remains one of my favorites. It's easy (I had never really cooked a 'real' meal before when I made it), fast, and delicious to almost everyone. The mixed fruits and cumin mix give it a wonderful taste. Very satisfying!

Very nice dish for a week night meal. I used dried plums and apricots. I also used whole cuminseeds to give a bit more flavour. I am not sure the olives are necessary, but I guess they do give flavour to the sauce.

This was very tasty. Using a mix of fruits is key -- applies, cranberries and apricots worked for me. I also used a well flavored stock and really reduced it to concentrate the flavor of the sauce.

This was easy and delicious and quick for a week night meal. As in the Chix Marbella recipe, I used dried plums and currants for the fruit. I have another chix recipe that uses toasted almonds in it and I can definitely see adding them to this recipe also for a nice crunch. I served with garlic&olive oil couscous and Italian carrots for a yummy meal.

Used dried mixed berries (cherries, blueberries, strawberries) and very flavorful whole black greek olives - turned out surprisingly well (I wasn't sure of this taste combination). Served it over rice with the extra juices.

Even with the low salt broth, this dish was just a bit too salty. It could have been me, but it was not enjoyed by my family either. I would consider leaving the olives out, but that's not much fun, is it?

Made this last night using dried apricots and cranberries. Used a non-stick pan, so 1Tbsp of oil was plenty, could use even less next time. Tasted very good, looking forward to the leftovers tonight.

This was wonderful. I used dried cherries, plums, cranberries, and apricots. Also cut cooking time of chicken to about 5 mins and the chicken was very moist. My husband was raving about the great flavor and how moist the chicken was!

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. I used prunes, apricots and a few sultanas. The couscous and carrots were a pleasant accompaniment. I would make this again for a dinner party.
