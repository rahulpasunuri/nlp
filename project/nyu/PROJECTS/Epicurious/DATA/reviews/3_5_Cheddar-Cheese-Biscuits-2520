Very quick and easy. Everyone loved them. I used a small juice glass to cut the biscuits and ended up with about twice as many. The uncooked biscuits froze beautifully and cooked up nicely with just an additional minute or so bake time. I plan to make a bunch and keep them in the freezer for quick fresh biscuits without all the weird preservatives of store bought. P.S. Don't skip the pepper. It adds a great twist.

I do like the taste of these but DO NOT take one responders advice and add an egg to the buttermilk. Too moist! I did this and although the taste is still good they became drop instead of rolled biscuits. I also used 1 cup white whole wheat pastry flour. I'm a southerner (4th gen. cajun)and the idea of putting ANY kind of seed on top of a biscuit sounds silly. So I didn't put any part of the topping on either. The parchment idea is a good one.

Having spent some time in the south and having made a ton of biscuits over the years this is a solid recipe. Two minor suggestions and one additive. Freeze the butter and cheese prior to using. Shred the butter into the dry ingredients verses slicing. The additive: whisk in one egg into the buttermilk. Both the the frozen shredded butter and cheese and the egg make for a lighter biscuit. As you knee the dough fold it back and forth...it will create feathery flaky layers (Hungry Jack) biscuits.

I'm from the south, where biscuits are serious business. And I have never been very successful in making them. These are great, and I have yet to screw them up! In fact, several other friends from the south have asked me to make them again, or for the recipe! I used cayenne and gruyere, which is a delicious combo. Good tip on the parchment paper from previous commenters.

Excellent biscuits, used sesame seeds instead of poppy seeds. Tender and tasty with some soup. Reheat well in a toaster oven.

Oh additionally I used white pepper which as a more pronounced taste. So, my biscuit is a bit more pepper-y in flavor which I like.

I guess I was expecting a bit more from this but it just seemed like any ordinary biscuit. I used the extra-sharp cheddar cheese and even put in a bit more than required but I didn't get a very pronounced cheddar taste. As other suggested I backed on parchament paper and there was no burning, cooked to perfection. I actually cooked it for 14 minutes and then turned off the over and let it cook for another 4 minutes. I plan on freezing a few individually so I can enjoy at a later point in time. I would make this again but it doesn't strike me as anything special. I did omit the glaze and poppy seeds. And next time I have a biscuit I'll enjoy with butter.

This one has been praised at numerous gatherings. I often use jalapeno cheese and skip the poppy seeds.

I halved this recipe for 6 medium-sized biscuits. The recipe was good, but I've definitely made better biscuits from this site (try the cream drop biscuits!).

Excellent biscuits. They were beautiful golden brown with a lovely fluffy texture. Next time, I'll add more cheese and cut the pepper a bit.

Awesome! This recipe is foolproof. I added cumin to the mix and sprinkled on top -- very versatile indeed. Definitely my favourite cheese scone/biscuit on the site.

These were delicious!! I used sharp white cheddar cheese and followed the directions exactly, except that mine were done after only 15 minutes. Rose up really nicely in the oven, and the whole house smelled good. Both my kids loved them as well (added bonus!) A definite keeper!!

Delicious! I made these with pre-shredded sharp cheddar, and they turned out fine. I did have a slight problem with the biscuits sticking to my cookie sheet, so I would probably recommend parchment paper, grease, or a Silpat.

These biscuits are always a big hit, and people beg for the recipe. I like to mix up the cheese component by using mixes that include Emethaler, Gruyere, Bleu, Parmesan, and a bit of other seasoning such as sage, paprika, or nutmeg. Experiment, it's wonderful!

These are great! My guests loved them. They are very easy to make. I used a food processor, parchment paper to avoid burning, and did not use the poppy seeds. I made them 2 days ahead and froze them once they cooled. To reheat, I wrapped them in foil and placed them in a preheated oven (350 degrees) for 15 to 20 minutes.

These biscuits were quite yummy. And quick to make in the food processor. I didn't have extra sharp cheddar on hand, so I used medium cheddar, and they were still delicious, with a great texture.

Wonderful and quick-to-make biscuits. I halved the recipe and made 6 medium-sized biscuits. I used a sharp Vermont cheddar. I didn't roll out the biscuits, but instead easily formed them into smooth rounds. I didn't use the egg wash or poppy seeds. I'll make these again.

I get requests from the family several times a year for these. They are great and easy to get together. Just do not roll them out too thin.

Excellent, versitile dish. First time, I tossed in some chopped up Jalepeno...very spicy, nice kick. Second time, I did no cheese, for regular biscuits, which got many compliments. Freezes well, too, and can be baked partially thawed (though, they don't get as big). I needed to add alot of flour at the end, so instead I didn't knead, and just floured my hands and pressed them into shape, which worked great.

A very quick and easy recipe, they went very well with chilli.

This is a very easy to follow recipe. I served the biscuits with the recipe for spicy vegetarian chili. Although it sounds like a weird combination, it tastes great.

Big hit at an impromptu dinner party. I didn't have enough cheese so I used 1 C. Cheddar and 1/4 C. parmesan. Also skipped the egg wash and brushed the top with cream before baking. I also found they needed a couple extra minutes in the oven.

These biscuits are great! I made a few modifications - added 1 Tbl. fresh dill (or 1 tsp. dried would work) to dry ingredients. I added cheese to food processor and processed for a few turns, rather than mixing in by hand. I whisked in 1 or 2 Tbl. Dijon mustard to the buttermilk before mixing with dry ingredients. I replaced poppy seeds with a few sprinkles of extra dill on top after egg wash. I host a large brunch and baked a few batches of these ahead of time and froze them. Defrost overnight in frig and reheat 5 to 10 minutes on baking sheet. Everyone raved about them. They made great brunch sandwiches with baked ham - no need for mustard! Definitely will make again. In fact, I keep a batch in my freezer, so I can just reheat one in the microwave when I want one.

Light, easy, cheesy. DELISH! Used salted butter and omitted the 1/2 tsp salt. Cut them in half and made breakfast sandwiches with a fried egg and bacon. My husband was in heaven.

These couldn't have been easier or simpler. Nice and flaky, great cheesy flavor. I served with the Chicken Thyme Corn Soup, and a simple salad. An excellent addition!

Nice, golden brown biscuits. Nice texture. Made them as stated but without egg wash on top. Drizzled a little melted butter on top instead. This is a good recipe.

These are really tasty. I was in a hurry and forgot to do the glaze w/ poppy seeds, but they turned out great anyway. I did have to cook them a little longer than recommended (5-10 minutes) to get them good and brown.

I have made this recipe many times, both with and without the cheese. They are always terrific. I make them for breakfast omitting the cheese and poppy seeds. They are the best and easiest biscuits I have made.

I made these biscuits as the bread for mini ham sandwiches at a cocktail party. I added a little cayenne pepper but was pressed for time and didn't prepare the egg wash/poppy seed topping. It didn't matter because they were still great. Several people commented that they were incredible!

Very easy -- forgot the pepper and they were still good -- I think red pepper or cayenne would be good as well.

Delicious. Don't skimp on the cheese, and use good sharp cheddar. I added a minced shallot and served these with Lobster Newburg (recipe from this site). Perfect combination!

I served these very yummy biscuits straight from the oven with a fall vegetable pureed soup. A delicious Sunday lunch.
