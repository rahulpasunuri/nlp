I have been looking for a good recipe that I can count on, and make again and again...I think I have found it with this one. I used fresh picked blackberries and followed the recipe completely to see just how it turned out. The topping didn't ever really "brown" but still tasted fine. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The berry juices and cream were delicious. I made it ahead and then warmed it up before serving. Such an easy recipe. I think I will try cinnamon next time, just a touch.

Easy and delicious! I cut the sugar by half and it seemed fine. Will definitely make again.

Used peaches and plums, reducing it to serve only 2. Delicious. Note, however, that the top says it makes 8 servings, but recipe uses only 6 ramekins, i.e. 6 servings.

so quick and easy...why didn't I think of this before? With just two of us home now, I put the extra topping in a jar in the fridge for later. I did add a touch of cinnamon 'cause it's fallish.
