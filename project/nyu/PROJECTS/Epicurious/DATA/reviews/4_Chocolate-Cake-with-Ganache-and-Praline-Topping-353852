A sure winner. easy too. Double the recipe and make it two layers with ganache in the middle. Looks impressive. Not too sweet. The chocolate cake is moist- just about perfect. Your company will swoon

I was so disappointed with this recipe after reading all of the great reviews. I followed the recipe precisely. I made it for my mom's birthday, and it looked great. However, when I went to cut into it, the cake crumbled apart and I had to serve everyone a pile of crumbs. That being said, the crumbs in themselves tasted great!

We had this for dessert tonight and everyone loved it. I thought it was slightly heavy on the ganache so I will reduce the amount a bit next time, but it was still delicious. The praline topping was perfect and the cake itself was wonderfully light and moist and almost fluffy.

I make this cake without the praline and everyone who tastes it, loves it.

This is moist, beautiful , and delicious. It is one of the best chocolate cake recipes ever and really pretty too. Easy to make.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. I followed the directions exactly. The chocolate cake did not rise very much; it turned out to be a very thin cake. However, the cake itself was very moist and delicious. The topping was really good and the recipe gave the right amount. My husband really liked it. He had three slices!

It was okay, but I wasn't thrilled with this. The biggest problem for me and the others who ate it last night was that it was too sweet. The flavor of the cake itself was a little pallid, too. The idea of the praline topping is interesting, though; I might try a similar idea with a different chocolate cake recipe (one with sour cream and a little coffee to deepen the flavor) and perhaps a less-sweet cream cheese frosting as a layer under the praline.

My wife made this cake this weekend and it was awesome. She followed the directions perfectly, said it was easy, and got great results. The praline set up beautifully and there wasn't too much of it. This one will stay in our repertoire.

This is the first cake I've made in a very long time (poor baking skills and serial dieter). It was very easy and incredibly delicious. Praline was just the right amount and goes great with the ganache frosting. For me, it would be chocolate overkill without the praline.

OUTSTANDING!!!Everyone loved this at our annual 4th of July BBQ. It is a "keeper" for sure. I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious and picture perfect, too! Not too much praline topping either.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I made it once as a cake and then tried it as cupcakes (got about 14 out of the batch) and it was just as good either way!! Totally disagree about cutting back on the praline topping as well. I have a bad habit of 'tweeking' recipes as I make them and I didn't change a THING with this one and it was easy, breezy, FAB-U-LOUS!

Everyone I served this cake to raved about it. The only change I made was using cake flour instead of all purpose flour per the directions for substitution on the cake flour box. It is a wonderful cake and fairly easy to make.

The cake was fabulous. I disagree about cutting back the praline topping. I thought it was perfect and presents very well. The only problem I had was the cake did not rise that much both times I made it??? So I just made it a double layer cake!

Absolutely delicious! It was gone in a matter of days. I accidentally used at 10" pan, although the cake was a little thin, it was still moist. The ganache and praline are to die for.

The cake is fabulous. Great chocolate flavor, very tender, not too sweet and easy breezy to make. The ganache is also very tasty. My only reservation is the praline topping. It didn't come out as described in the recipe. Since it was my first time making it, I'm assuming full responsibility (actually, I'm blaming the humid weather). The praline topping was runny and never really set. In fact, it dripped over the sides of the cake, so the entire cake was coated in the praline topping. The texture of the praline topping was a little gritty. Everyone who ate the cake absolutely loved it, however, so I am definitely going to make it again. I'll try making less of the topping as suggested by another reviewer. See how that goes. Or, I may skip it completely, and just sprinkle toasted pecans over the ganache. No question that would be delicious.

I agree with the previous poster. The cake was excellent, but a little heavy on the praline topping. I'll make half the next time (and there will be a next time!)

Excellent dessert. My only future change would be to make only half the praline topping, but include all the toasted pecans.

This cake is easy to make and is delicious! The ganache with the praline topping is a great combo!

Margie made this for our winetasting group. It was too die for! We all had seconds (and we'd already had a great dinner!) I'm saving it to my recipe box now.
