Bloody waste of time.

I haven't tried the recipe, but it sounds like the saturation of the bread cube needs to be played with and tested. I would imagine a light coat would do the trick. With any new and exotic recipe I always make an effort in "taste testing" it first before the occassion. :)

Your recipes sound more like a flop as opposed to a "splash".

We followed the recipe exactly but it did not work for us. The bread cubes that were soaked in the bottle of pure lemon extract, never did light! With a lot of effort we got one bread cube to produce an extremely weak flame for a few seconds. None of the other bread cubes would go aflame, even with direct application of a lighted match! (The bread simply burnt to an unappealing black char.) The idea sounded fantastic, but unfortunately didn't work - at least for us. What a waste of lemon extract. Our lovely summer fruit was wonderful anyway but had nothing to do with this disappointing recipe.
