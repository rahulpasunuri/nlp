This might just be my new favorite way to prepare eggplant. Except for using canned tomatoes, I followed the recipe precisely. Next time I'll use my slowcooker to prepare the peas ahead of time. Apart from their long cooking time, this comes together fairly quickly. I'll definitely be making this a lot this fall!

The split pea puree is wonderful and could serve as a base for lots of yummy toppings. The eggplant is good but not outstanding. I made it as written but next time will get creative with the eggplant.

Very good. Used canned tomatoes and added white wine with them because I love the flavor when that cooks down. Didn't need the vinegar.

I got rave notices from my family for this recipe. It takes time, but it is really good! You can save time by using canned diced tomatoes (no salt). Frankly, I'm finding tomatoes in the produce section lacking in flavor these days, so I may have gained on the trade.

This was really, really good. Unusual but comfy and warming, and if you swap agave nectar for the honey it's vegan. Protip: the split peas are done when they blorp and spit so vigorously that they fly out of the pot and hit you in the eye, even though you have the burner on the lowest setting.

Excellent recipe. Vegetarian comfort food. We didn't have split peas, and we made it with green lentils...delicious

Really worth the effort. Made both the puree and the compote on a Friday afterwork. The puree was delicious on its own. I served the compote with the puree and it was a great single bowl meal. When making the compote I used frozen chopped basil and left out the capers but otherwise followed the recipe. Since there are only two of us we had plenty of leftovers but everything was so good we didn't mind at all. Served the compote over baked polenta one day for a little variety. Would definately make both parts again either individually or as a complete meal.

This was pretty good for a vegetarian dish or as part of a multi-course meal. I used a pressure cooker to cut the time down on the cooking of the split peas and then used a hand mixer to puree once they were soft and had absorbed most the water. I didn't really get the honey flavor. I used Ichiban eggplants from our garden that have a great flavor that when browned may not have picked up the honey flavor later. Whole peeled tomatoes worked just as well for another time saving tip. May try to figure a way to incorporate meat for my husband the next time around.

The pea puree tastes good, reminds me of pea soup. Having known I would not have added any balsamic. Took so long to make!

UTTERLY LUXURIOUS!!! Although, it may be unnecessary to comment on this, as, I'm not sure I can say anything that has not already been said. HOWEVER, I feel I must put in my two-cents worth; I prepared this recipe exactly as written, except (I know, here it comes, right?) except I did have to substitute a leek for the onion in the puree, a shallot for one of the onions in the compote, also green split peas for yellow. Only because that's all I had in the pantry. WOW! So delicious, the combination is pure genius and the flavor and texture unbelievably satisfying and comforting. Ate as a main course for myself last night, and lunch today (even better) . . . just a bit left for tonight's snack. Will definitely make again and again, maybe next time pairing w/a beautiful Halibut filet! Bon Appetit!!!

I made the eggplant compote part of this dish and thought it was excellent. The 1 tsp of honey really shines through, surprisingly. Visit http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com for pics and details.

Absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it. Both the puree and the eggplant were full of flavor. I always worry when I use eggplant that it will be bitter, but the process this recipe taught me removed all bitter flavor. I was tempted to add more honey than the recipe called for, because I like my recipes on the sweet side, but I could really taste that 1 tsp of honey in the final product! My only complaint is how long it took to prepare.

Wow! Great flavor in both elements. We ended up with about 8 cups of purée and 3 cups of compote - which means the two of us will be enjoying leftovers for a few days. I'll serve this next time we have guests over.

I've only made the fava part of this dish, but I absolutely love it. Highly recommended with capers, kalamata olives, and a drizzle of olive oil on top.

This is a fabulous dish! I didn't use split peas - I had Scandanavian yellow peas, so I had to cook it much longer than the recipe called for (my bad). I used 2 cups of vegetable broth, and added about 2.5 cups of extra water to accommodate the larger peas. The puree had a very strong smell while it was cooking, and I wondered if the whole peas were going to ruin the recipe. Well, I'm glad I stuck it out! The flavors mellowed nicely, especially when the lemon juice and olive oil (and a pinch of cayenne) was added. Then I pureed it with a hand mixer. I doubled the eggplant in the compote because another reviewer mentioned that there wasn't enough, and I love eggplant and am not so fond of tomatoes. I will make this again, but will use split peas to cut the cooking time.

I almost didn't make this dish based upon its less then stellar numbers. I glanced at the comments to see what was wrong with it. Someone gave it 1 fork because they didn't like how it read & everyone else provided useful advice. Glad I tried it to use the onion, garlic, tomato & eggplant from our CSA! 1 Tablespoon of Vinaigre de banyuls instead of Balsamic & this was a dish the entire family could enjoy (including the kids!)

This made an excellent vegetarian entree--just need to add a side veggie or a salad. 8 ounces of eggplant is really a very small amount. I halved the pea puree and more than doubled the eggplant amount, although used approximately the same amount of other eggplant ingredients. It was enough for 4 people. Added some chicken broth to the pea puree and a touch of tabasco sauce. Served it slightly warm--otherwise the pea puree was too stiff. The eggplant is very similar to caponata.

I only made the eggplant part - started too late to do the split peas. It was delicious, not at all like any eggplant dishes I had eaten before, and very much worth the effort (I had never peeled a tomato before). Looking forward to trying the whole thing soon.

Lovely--so much better than I'd expected, and a huge hit with my guests. The only change I made was to use vegetable stock instead of water when cooking the split peas. I was certain it was going to be bland, and it turned out to be complex and delicious!

Why so few forks? We loved this- and it was really quite easy to make!! I used water (not broth, as one reviewer recommended) and only one Tablespoon of balsamic- Two would have been overwelming (and I LOVE balsamic vinegar!). Enjoy!!

I've never rated a recipe before but feel I must now put my forks in. This is absolutely delicious, subtle, sophisticated. We served it as a fairly robust first course, followed by light second course of grilled haddock and salad leaves from our garden. All incredibly fresh. I was half expecting the Michelin man to arrive with rosettes before we finished. The only variance from the recipe was purely by mistake - I bought split green peas instead of yellow and I suspect it was a visual improvement. Of course I'd make it again - in fact I already have!

This was a pleasant dish, but next time I will cut down on the vinegar. My children loved the mild, creamy fava.

Thank you jennifer39 - the champagne vinegar is definitely more suitable than balsamic. Excellent dish. Used veg. broth for puree instead of water.

To the Cook from Kansas: How vain can you be to think that your opinion from reading a recipe, not actually making it, is worth posting on this site? I am not quite so vain and made this recipe this afternoon. It was super. The split pea base was brilliant, and I hope to find ways to use that in other recipes. Very hearty without the starch. And the eggplant compote was superb. I'm always on the lookout for eggplant recipes with some sophistication (eggplant can be so rustic!), and this recipe is one of them. I used the basil, balsamic suggestion. My only recommendation is that cooks taste the eggplant before adding the vinegar at the end. Mine was subtly complex, and in retrospect I would have chosen an acid to bring that out, rather than add the stronger balsamic flavor. Maybe champagne vinegar or sherry vinegar. And if you buy young, sweet eggplant, no need for the salt-and-drain routine. Enjoy!

I'm puzzled as to why someone would rate a recipe they've not made, if only to ruin it for others.

I haven't made it yet either, but it sounds terrific. I've saved it to my recipe box and plan to make it soon - will report back when I do!

This is to the cook and all cooks who give a poor review without even trying it. Why give it a poor review if you haven't even tasted it? If you made it and then said it's too much trouble, OK. But who cares if you think it's too much trouble if you don't even bother trying it. We can see for ourselves if it's a bother.
