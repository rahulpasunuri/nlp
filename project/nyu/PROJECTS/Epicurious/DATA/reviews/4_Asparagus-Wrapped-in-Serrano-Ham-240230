This was an excellent dish that require little cooking and preparation. I used prosciutto and made a couple changes to the recipe. The result was very good. Boyfriend and I each had 6 asparagus stalks and plenty of salad coz they were very tasty. I used balsamic vinegar instead of the sherry vinegar since I didn't have sherry vinegar handy. I also only used green asparagus. I skipped Frisee and almonds for simplicity sake. I agree with one of the previous reviews - don't skip the grapes! i was skeptical but bought grapes for the dish anyway and grapes added a hint of sweetness to the salad which was very refreshing.

I decided to make this recipe about an hour before a party started. It ended up being the most visually appealing and delicious appetizer at the party. And it was very easy to make too.

Great recipe, simple and very elegant presentation. The vineagrette is light, didn't take away from the asparagus, and I used pancetta instead of serrano. Lovely dish, people thought I spent hours-- it took minutes to prepare.

This has become an instant family favorite. Don't skip the sliced grapes, they add a nice balance to the vinigrette. I prefer to use prosciutto.

I haven't made this recipe, but unless you have very young and thin white asparagus, it needs to be treated differently than the green asparagus. You need to peel it, and it should cook until very tender, not crisp. If it's crisp it will be too tough and bitter. Cook the white asparagus much longer than the green, unless it's very thin.

This recipe is not Italian. It is Spanish. Serrano ham is Spanish. Definitely a superior ham.

Wonderful flavors, beautiful presentation,very easy to do. Can't wait for native asparagus to make it again. Used only green asparagus and skipped theegrapes cause it seemed like a little too much. Also put a little Dijon in the dressing.

Very good appetizer. The stores didn't have white asparagus or serrano ham. I used the green asparagus and proscuitto. Beautiful presentation and they were tasty. Easy simple healthy I will definitely make this again.

Prosciutto is always best to ham . . . regardless of type. I disagree about peeling white asparagus. If fresh, you don't need to; if old, you do. If the bottoms are woody, peel it. Fortunately I can always get very thin, fresh white asparagus. Also get young, very thin green asparagus. This is a fantastic dish to serve as a salad or in a buffet.

For those not familiar with white asparagus, it needs to be peeled (with a vegetable peeler). This very important step is not mentioned in the recipe.

I was a little skeptical but had an excess of grapes, greens, and asparagus to use up. The salad was delicious, beautiful, and a hit at the party. I used prosciutto.

I made this and had to substitute the sherry vinegar for red wine vinegar (I hate substituting anything the first time I try a recipe)because I couldn't find sherry vinegar at the last minute. This salad impressed both on presentation and taste - it was great. Will absolutely make this again and try it with sherry vinegar next time although I'm not sure how it could get any better.

I made this but substituted balsamic vinegar. Got my serrano from Latienda.com... just wonderful.
