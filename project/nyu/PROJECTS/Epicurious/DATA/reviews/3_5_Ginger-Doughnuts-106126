This is an excellent, classy doughnut. I generally love making doughnuts and have my own way of making them (using safflower oil instead of vegetable oil and shortening, using a larger doughnut cutter), so I'm rating the dough and the sugar topping. This was very crunchy and contrastingly soft and light in the inside and I agree that it reminds me of a buttermilk doughnut. The little specs of crystallized ginger are brilliant. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe, and I will have to try the vegetable oil/shortening combination. I wish the few doughnut places in this area would make doughnuts with this taste and texture.

On crystallized ginger: you could make it yourself, or buy it at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods for $4 for 12 oz; either is cheaper than the highway robbery of supermarket ginger (and the quality is much better). On the doughnuts: I just made these yesterday, on an 80+ degree day, so the dough really didn't want to roll out - so I made doughnut holes. Also, they didn't stay completely round, which is either my ineptitude, the recipe, or the weather. However, they were really quite good; my friends loved them and ate almost all of them. Today they're almost as crisp as they were yesterday, after being sealed in a plastic bag overnight. They're really good with vanilla ice cream.

This was my first time making doughnuts. My family loves the taste of ginger, so I thought these would be perfect...and they were very well received! I would definitely make them again. We had them with other brunch items and mimosas...which was kinda sweet. I think that they would be better on their own, with coffee...but the taste and texture is wonderful and very easy to prepare.

These were very good tasting. I made them as directed except that I used powdered sugar to coat them instead of granulated. It resulted in some to most of it being gummy on the doughnut. I tried waiting until they had drained well and cooled off to coat them, but that didn't fix the problem. I was meticulous about my oil temperature, so I'm not sure why this happened. I mean, Dunkin'Doughnuts has powdered sugar doughnuts that aren't gummy, so I know it's possible. Anybody have any ideas??? I'd make them again using granulated sugar or maybe a glaze...they tasted good and my kids loved them, too. The doughnuts themselves didn't taste greasy and they were done all the way.

I love this recipe, the texture is very similar to old fashioned, or buttermilk donuts; crunchy on the outside and cakey texture inside, the chewy ginger bits give it that tropical touch. I purchased the candied ginger at an Asian food store, very inexpensive.

Just a note to anybody who might have run into the prohibitive cost of the crystalized ginger-- many grocery stores now have bulk sections and you can find the ginger in with the dried fruit-- it is expensive per pound but you can buy just as much as you need.

Reasons I don't recommend this recipe; 1. costs more to make than to buy a doughnut at the bakery .50cents (the carmelized ginger alone $10 a bottle) 2. messy 3. most of them were left over. Pretty picture but soo not worth my time.

Wonderful! I used my bread machine to do all the mixing, then chilled the dough right in the bread pan. I used my food processor to chop the ginger. Very easy. Made as listed and it was fantastic. I did get the oil too hot so the first few were doughy in the middle. Otherwise, perfect and not too tough to make.

Made these for Christmas morning and they were a hit. Ate them while opening presents. Cut down on the ginger because was concerned the kids wouldn't like it. Next time will add all of it and maybe more. Made the batter the day before and fried them up in the morning. Very easy.
