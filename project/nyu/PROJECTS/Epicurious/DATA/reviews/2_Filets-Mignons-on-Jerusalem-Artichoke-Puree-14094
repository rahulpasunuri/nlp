just wanted to point out: the recipe refers to the puree as a "sauce" - it isn't supposed to be the consistency of a mash.

This review is solely for the puree. I added a garlic clove to the simmering sunchokes and did not add the horseradish. I agree with the previous review that it would have been way too much liquid. I enjoyed the simplicity of the dish and served it topped with roasted king trumpet mushrooms.

I wanted to try Jerusalem artichokes since I have never had them before. I didn't follow the directions exactly because with that amount of liquid it would turn them to a puddle. I'm glad I didn't. I added only enough to make them the consistency of a mash. I'm not sure if the horseradish worked with the flavor of the artichokes. I think next time I will try the recipe for them sauted. I'm still not sure if I like Jerusalem artichokes or not. They have a flavor like nothing else.

Disappointing.
