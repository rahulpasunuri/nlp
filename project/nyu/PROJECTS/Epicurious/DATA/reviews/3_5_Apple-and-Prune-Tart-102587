This was truly outstanding! I made it exactly according to the recipe and it turned out just like the image. I can whole heartedly recommend this to everyone.

Scrumptious! I used fresh prunes. The walnuts really make the recipe. Great for prune and apple season (VERY inexpensive!)

Moisture level does need to be increased - may i suggest the following. Add more liquid to the prunes (or as I used - calafornian dates) + sprinkle calvados and spiced rum just before you place pie in oven. Add a little more during the cooking process. Pecans instaed of walnuts is also a very good option especially when you cook it for the second time as a flavour change.

Excellent recipe! Very easy, doesn't take much time and is beautiful. I am a real prune fan, so I liked it, but my husband, who doesn't really like prunes also thought it was great.
