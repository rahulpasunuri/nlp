This is the easiest, most unusual tasting rice I've made in a long, long time. I didn't have cinnamon sticks on hand so I used a pinch of ground to great effect. I put it all in the rice cooker, turned it on, and forgot about it, adding the scallion greens afterward as instructed. It was a huge hit at the dinner table and I will make it again and again.

3 forks because it's only rice, but I thought this was delicious. I doubled the mustard seed as suggested and used 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon because apparently I threw out my cinnamon sticks. Perfect! I served it with Cornish Hens with Sweet Vermouth Garlic Glaze (famed for playful reviews and suggestions). And peas from the freezer, because it's March 1st and my little market had nothing...

Loved it. Made it with the shrimp recipe for guests a few times and everyone always raved. I live overseas and had to substitute the basmati for brown rice and it still tastes great to us.

very good rice. the cinnamon was great and the raisons were not too sweet at all (i used dark raisons because that's what i had on hand). i served it with the shrimp and peppers in spicy tomato sauce, which was delicious and went well with the rice.

Yuck! I made it exactly as written. Horrible. Then I tried to "doctor" it up by adding more mustard seeds (as another reviewer suggested), some toasted pecans, more salt for flavor...it still tasted bland, boring, and just plain weird. MANY better recipes on this site.

Awesome! I could eat this everyday for the rest of my life. I used brown Basmati rice and doubled the mustard seeds as another poster had suggested. I was dubious about this recipe but now I can't wait to make it again!

I served this rice with Tandoori Chicken. Maybe this recipe just isn't to my taste, but personally, I would have preferred plain boiled basmati rice. I objected to the sweet raisin flavor combined with the scallion taste. It was really bland and cloying -- not the way I like rice. Next time I'll try one of the other rice recipes with more spices.

Delicious! I left the raisins out but other than that followed the recipe. I made it last night and my boyfriend wants me to make it again tonight! I served it with a vegetarian curry and mattir panir (recipes not from this site).

Great flavor and perfect accompaniment for the Shrimp & Peppers in Spicy Tomato Sauce. As a reviewer suggested I used half low-sodium chicken broth with the water. If I were to change anything it would be to reduce the size of the cinnamon stick a little. It is amazing how much the cinnamon flavor comes through.

This is quick, easy and delicious. I made this to go with a traditional Indian chicken curry, and it was a great substitute for my usual and much more time-consuming rice recipe. I will definately be making this again. I substituted a can of chicken broth plus enough water to equal the amount called for in the recipe, and cut the salt to a scant half teaspoon. In fact, you could probably totally leave out the salt. A great side dish for the time pressed cook.

This is a very tasty rice dish. I used 2 cups of chicken broth to one cup of rice - left other proportions the same. Microwave for approx 15 - 20 min (depending on your microwave) -Let rest -- Perfect rice everytime.

This was fantastic. It was also very easy and very quick, perfect as a side for an impressive mid-week meal.

Okay kids. Seriously kickass rice here. I made it to go with the pork tenderloin medallions and pears with port mustard sauce also on this site. I get jacked when I can use cinnamon in savory dishes, and its inclusion here is inspired. I rarely give four stars for anything, but this one was right up my alley. If you don't like cinnamon in savory dishes (unadventurous), mustard (mom's boy/girl), or good taste (enlarged adenoids), take a pass on this. Otherwise, get in there. Only downside was getting the wine right with the pork dish I served alongside this. There were alot of flavors going on and my little California chardonnay never had a chance. My changes? DOUBLE the mustard seeds. That's it. E-mail me if you have a better wine choice... Oh yeah, mangoes in lime juice with a little honey for dessert. God I love food.

Delicious! Much more special than plain rice. I was surprised how much the cinnamon came through. I prepared this recipe slightly differently; I popped the mustard seeds in 1 1/2 T. hot oil, and then sauteed the rice until pale gold, before adding the rest of the ingredients -- butter or ghee would be fine too. (P.S. I used a 2 qt. saute pan because everything else was occupied; no problem).

This is an interesting rice recipe; a nice change of pace from plain rice.
