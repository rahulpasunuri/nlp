Very tasty. I followed the other reviewers' suggestions who deep-fried it in my Fry-Baby, and it came out great at 350 in 6 minutes. I used a baby zucchini I had to try it out (and the Fry-Baby can easily take two of those); I would therein only suggest that one goes for thicker slices. Pass on the garlic, of course, unless you want to deep-fry gsrlic cloves for the fun of it and don't do sweets in your deep fryer. Believe every warning about paper-toweling the strips dry. With thucker slices, i might give it an additional two minutes next time; it needs the thickness and time to retain both crispness and form. Dunno about scattering Parmy in the bottom of my deep fryer...

I was nervous to try this after reading some of the reviews but it came out better than expected. I have some notes to pass on: 1) All the salt is necessary to remove the moisture from the zucchini. If it tastes too salty for you, I would rinse off the zucchini after draining and dry really well before frying. 2) The amount of oil will have to increase if you use a larger pan. 7-8" is really small. I measured my pans and the one that was this size is the skillet I usually use to fry 1-2 eggs. I used 1/2 cup oil (I was frying 2 zucchini) but think I would use this much even for a single one. I don't think 1/4 cup is enough to adequately submerge the strips. They don't have to be completely covered by the oil, but you only want the top surface poking out a bit so that you get all surfaces in the oil by turning once. 3) The garlic adds tons of flavor and helps you figure out when the oil is hot enough. If you don't use garlic, I would wait to add the zucchini until you see the first whiff of smoke from the oil. My oil was smoking a little. 4) Don't crowd the pan or the temperature of the oil will drop and you will not get that nice crispy texture. Mine were done in about 4 minutes, fried individually (not together in a cake as some people complained) and didn't get soggy even 15-20 minutes out of the pan. This is my new go-to preparation for left over squash, which I always seem to have in the summer time.

greasy and soggy.. some were okay right out of the fryer, but they were mush by the time all the batches were done.

I thought these were very tasty. I used 1 1/2 Tablespoons of flour and 1 heaping tablespoon of parmesan cheese. I deep fried them for 6 minutes. I also served them with garlic aioli. I just used 1/2 cup of mayo, 1 clove of minced garlic, 2 T of milk, the juice of 1 lemon and some pepper. Everyone loved it!

I too experienced the same as the Miami cook. They were greasy and soggy, and not at all appetizing. Maybe the oil wasn't hot enough, but there was certainly enough of it. My hopes were dashed after squeezing the zucchini, though, because they turned to mush before I even started. Very disappointing.

Terrible

Very tasty and my husband and I were equally dividing the extra. };-D I didn't use the garlic because I deep fried them after shaking them in flour and parmesan.They became a little mushy after sitting for a few minutes but could be that they didn't drain enough of the water. All and all they were yummy and will be made again!

So simple but so delicious! I thought it would be better to just deep fry these in a pot. Looking at the other reviews, I didn't waste time fooling around with one zucchini! This is the perfect alternative to french fries. They are light, crispy and very satisfying. The next time I make these I am going to try them with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese as someone else mentioned.

I kinda messed up a little but that didn't take away from the flavor much. I loved this and wanted to jump right back in the kitchen and make more!

To Miami cook: maybe try higher heat, too. It sounds like your strings weren't browning at all before they soaked up the oil.

Rating: 0
to the cook from Miami: I think you used too little oil, so that the upper parts of the zucchini that aren't frying in the oil are steaming, turning the flour coating into a sticky starch that is causing the strings to clump- rather than fry up crisp and separate. Try it again with the correct amount of oil.

I'm so disappointed that we didn't have such great results! I used the julienne tool mentioned in another review, did the salting and squeezing, followed the recipe except actually used less oil than called for, but our result was more like small greasy zucchini pancakes, all clumped up, unappetizing and not too tasty either. Maybe the zucchini were too small? Seemed average size to me.

These were delicious, even though I would do certain things differently next time. I used 2 zucchini to make 2 servings, but I fried all of it in one 10" skillet, so I could not turn the strips properly. Next time I would fry it in 2 batches so it would brown more evenly. Also I would cut back on the salt by about 1/2.

Before eating, toss with some parmesan cheese! You'll love it!

This is a super simple and always delicious starter or snack. Serve with lemon wedges for a little extra zing.

This is delicious. We ate them for hors d'oeuvres as they were so good right out of the pan.

This is so good! I'd used 2 zucchini for the 2 of us and after dinner ,before I washed the pan, I julienned another and made seconds for us! I have a handy little gadget that looks like a potato peeler but makes julienne strips so the recipe was even easier..for the second batch I didn't even bother salting and draining!
