I substituted fresh bluberries for the raisins with geat results. Also suggest putting a little less water in the bain marie so you get a crunchy top. Will definitely repeat next time we have day old croissant!

Thank you so much for this recipe. There is a little cafe next door to where I work that makes the same thing, everyone raves about it. They wouldn't give me the recipe, so I was delighted when I found it on your website. I add crushed pecan nuts on the top and baked. A real winner

I make this recipe every 4-6 weeks. It is so delicious and easy! Sometimes I like to subsitute chopped dried apricots for the raisins for a little surprise. I always serve it with the bourbon sauce on this website. Yum!

I made this for Christmas and replaced the raisins with chocolate chips. I did not use the water bath and don't think it was necessary to use. It was fabulous!
