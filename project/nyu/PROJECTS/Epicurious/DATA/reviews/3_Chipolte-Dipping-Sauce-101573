Boring. Too much oil and not enough zest. I was looking for a spicy dipping sauce for steak. I had to had hot sauce and the recipe made way too much for a family of 5.

I was rushed to make a dip for a potluck Mexican gathering and misread the instructions. For the three canned chilies I use THREE CANS of chilies in adobo sauce. Many people asked for the recipe. They loved it.

Outstanding! Made sauce to go with Southwestern Chicken Egg Rolls and it was a perfect accompaniment. Instead of wearing gloves, I put the chilis in a mini food processor and never had to touch the chilis once. My husband and I thought 3 chilis was perfect. Only drawback is having to drip in the first 1/2 cup of oil -- it takes a lot of patience so don't try this if you are in a hurry. Also, the word "chipotle" is spelled wrong so the recipe was difficult to find in a search.

This dip is so good it won me first place in a contest to create the best Super Bowl Sunday finger foods. I paired it with the ever popular mini-stuffed red potatoes (also supplied by the great www.epicurious.com)for the winning combination. One word of caution though, pay close attention to the chipolle seeds and wear the gloves as recommended. Enjoy!

This goes well as a dipping sauce for beef fondue or to use with grilled tri-tip. I started out with 2 chiles and my family thought it was hot enough.
