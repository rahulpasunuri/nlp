Not very inspiring. The flavours were alright, but nothing really popped. Not worth making again.

I could only find the Chat Masala at a specialty store, but it was well worth the hunt! I did double the dressing recipe, and you might want to too. I could only find frizee in one of the mixed bags of salads, and settled for that as the greens, and it worked out wonderfully! I added a kabob of grilled lime and honey marinated scallops and shrimp. As a condiment choice, I had chopped fresh mango, pineapple, and some macadamia nuts. It was wonderful!
