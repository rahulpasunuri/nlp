Quite good, but a little dry.

Delicious! Made these with my 6 year old. We can't eat any sugar or milk, so baking gets interesting... but we subbed extra dried fruit for sweetness, 2 eggs and a bit of soymilk for liquid, and about 2T. softened coconut oil. We also added 3 T. flaxseed meal and subbed sunflower seeds for the almonds. Delicious!! Surprisingly, not too dense, dry or flat (without the sugar things are never the same but these were fine!!)

I wouldn't say that theses scones changed my life, but I don't think scones generally have that effect. Among all the scones I have made, these were the best. I followed the recipe exactly, and I used dried cherries, apricots, and golden raisons. It was a great combo! I highly recommend these.

The cardamom in these is delicious. I only had dried currants on hand, so I used 1/2 cup of those. Not the best match for the spices so I will try it again with other fruit & berries like the recipe states. Also, at high altitude, which I forgot about, a little extra flour would be good and 20 minutes was perfect...25 would have burned and dehydrated them :)

These are awesome. I really appreciate the added health benefits, but they taste great too. For an added boost, I sub half the flour for whole wheat and instead of brown sugar on top, I sprinkle ground flaxseed. I once accidentally used all the buttermilk in the dough instead of reserving some for brushing, and I found them to be the best batch yet. So I would suggest perhaps adding a tablespoon or two of extra buttermilk for added moisture. Although the dough was quite sticky, they held together much better.

Delicious! Everyone enjoyed it! Especially due to all the dried berries in the scones. It was easy to make and gave the house a wonderful aroma. I made vegan chocolate coconut bars as well ( http://www.ranker.com/list/chocolate-chunk-coconut-bars/vegan-recipes ) and two dishes complemented each other nicely.

Yum! They were moist and nice. We used dried stawberries, cranberries, and golden raisins. Didn't have honey crunch wheat germ, so just added a little honey to the buttermilk mixture. We were skimpy on the brown sugar and I still found it a tad too sweet.

A crowd pleaser! I followed others' advice and added a bit of dried apricot. Also like others, I didn't have any cardamom so I've been using cinnamon instead -- it seems to work fine. They look pretty and smell and taste great! I made them for Mother's Day brunch.

I made this exactly as printed, it's a new favorite. Yummy nutty flavor with specks of fruit, a hint of brown sugar but not too much. I have a conventional oven, I thought they were just right at 23 minutes.

Very easy to make and nice flavor. I cooked it in a convection oven at 400 and found 25 mins was a little too long

I LOVED this recipe. It's really tasty and easy to make. I didn't use cardamom because it's really expensive, so I used a little cinnamon instead. I added dried cherries, Craisins, and dried apricots along with the chopped almonds. Also, since I live in a high altitude I added 1/4 cup extra flour and reduced the baking time to 20 minutes and the scones came out perfectly.
