Easy and delicious. I made this in the oven and it turned out perfectly. Beautiful flavor. I saved the bones and skin to make a stock and it was a great base for a nice meat and veggie stew.

Added about 2 tsp of smoked paprika . . . it was great! Will definitely try again.

My mother and I enjoyed this delicious dish at our informal Christmas dinner, along with grilled asparagus. I altered the recipe slightly, substituting chipotle powder for the cayenne and lemon juice for the orange juice. The wings and legs were very flavorful and moist. The breast meat was less flavorful (though not bland, by any means) and a smidge dry (though admittedly, we might have overcooked the hens a bit). I would definitely make this again.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I needed to cook some cornish hens I had. The oven had gone kaput, so I was scrambling for something to do on the grill. It was a hit. Good with the sweet and spicy, and just very attractive. Saved the day!

I thought that this had the potential to be just OK, so I added a little cocoa powder, some chipotle powder and a splash of lime. Didn't have any pepitas. It was still just OK. The lime was necessary to cut the sweetness of the honey, but, even as a modified mole, it didn't work. Oh, well.

Follwed recipe to the letter and found it was good but not great. I have had better recipes for cornish hen. My husband and our dinner guests liked it well enough, but it wasn't a "hit." I have a few other tried and true recipes for cornish hens which I will stick with.

I made this using the "beer butt" method and it was incredible. I used one of those skinny power drink cans (drained of the original contents) and filled it with beer, orange juice, garlic and ginger. Put the hen over the can and grilled for 1 1/4 hours. Basted the sauce over the hen halfway through cooking and basted with additional butter. Served with wasabi grilled asparagus. Delicious!

This was delicious!! I marinated some boneless and skinless thighs and breast overnight. I also saved some of the sauce to warm up and use a dipping sauce.

Excellent! It was so easy to make and my family loved it.

I've used this recipe on dark meat chicken parts, not hens, yet, but I absolutely love it--the only change I made was to substitute chipotle chile powder for the cayenne, as we prefer its smoky flavor. Really simple, really tasty. I rescued the remaining marinade, boiled it, added a dash more chipotle powder, and a tablespoon each of ketchup and additional orange juice to make a really good sauce--this is the best fast BBQ poultry I know of.

This was a wonderful recipe, I made the marinade, and have used it on a small hen and let it sit over night and it was delicious. I have made this recipe several times.

This is a wonderful alternative to grilling chicken. I've prepared this recipe many times over the summer and found it easy and delicious.
