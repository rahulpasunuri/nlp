You do not even want to know how long I had to cook these carrots after they were supposedly "done"! These took waaay more effort than they should have and the end result definitely did not justify the means.

I have made these quite a few times and haven't been disappointed yet! My only recommendation would be saute the carrots longer than recommended, they are that much better!!!

Made for easter dinner. Used apple cider for more zing. We had with a ham glazed with cherry-almond sauce, so I figured the fruity-sweet combination would work well. Adding the scallions gave the whole dish a totally new taste. It was still good, but I would have preferred adding chopped parsley or maybe even a touch of mint with this to keep the fruitiness for this meal, however the scallions were good too, just not for a fruity meal. Wasnt exactly what I expected but I WILL make it again trying different variations.

As others suggested, I increased the cooking time to reduce the glaze; doubled the honey; and used apple cider instead. Served with pork and it was excellent!

I didn't care for these carrots at all. They were not very flavorful and were pretty ordinary.

The recipe calls for 1 cup of apple juice. It took a lot longer than the 15 minutes to reduce it to a glaze and I actually drained some off so that it would be ready with the other dishes. I would suggest cutting it down to 3/4 Cup. I served it with Cider-Basted Turkey with Roasted Apple Gravy (Check this recipe out).

Very tasty and very easy. Sweet, with a touch of apple and not much carrot flavor. It will take a bit longer than the recipe suggests. A great way to get kids to eat their veggies.

I really like this side. Nothing glamorous -- just fast, simple and tasty. I add about a tablespoon of honey, instead of a teaspoon, which helps make the glaze thicker and the honey flavor stronger.

I made these for Easter dinner and they received rave reviews. I steamed the carrots the night before, then made the glaze shortly before serving. I doubled the recipe and allowed about 25 minutes for the glaze to reduce but should have allowed more time. The flavor was delicious but it was a little more liquidy than I had hoped. I also substituted cider for the apple juice, which gave it a stronger flavor. Even the finicky vegetable eaters enjoyed them! Very easy, colorful and great to make for a crowd.

Pretty decent carrot recipe, although I did have to extend the cooking fairly significantly to obtain a "glaze" It did have a very good flavor, though.

I mormally don't care for cooked carrots, but enjoyed these. All side dishes should be this easy! The carmelization took a little longer than stated, but I will make this again (especially because the ingedients are always on hand). Served with roast chicken.

This was nothing special.

Was a delightful change and a hit for my family who would rather do without vegetables!

I do not know if we will make this recipe again. Looking at just the ingredients it sounds wonderful, but the flavor was not as strong as I would have liked it and my sauce never became a glaze. It remained liquid much to my dismay. I was out of green onions (as my husband used them up in omelets earlier *growl growl*), but I don't think the onions would have saved the dish. I enjoyed the aroma the dish gave off, but it just didn't tickle the taste-buds. I also think that if I do make this recipe again, I will boil the carrots first to soften them. Even though I sauteed them longer than instructed, I feel the carrots were still too crunchy. I think I would have been better off just leaving the carrots in the butter and forgetting the honey, apple juice, etc.

This recipe makes the carrots rather sweet, which is a nice compliment for some meat dishes. We doubled the recipe and it took 30-45 minutes to reduce.

Delicious side dish. Everyone loved it - served it with stuffed cornish hens. They were very sweet and the green onion added a nice offset to the sweetness. I had some fresh apple cider on hand that I used in place of the apple juice - what a treat. From start to finish - 10 minutes. Wonderful.

It was rather bland and it took forever to cook down to a glaze.

I have made this disk about 40 times now and it just gets better and better. I have used just sliced carrots as well and always steam them before I coat them with the apple glaze. I have had dinner guests call me days after a meal with this dish still on their mind and want the recipe. I love it because it is easy, quick, and very tasty.

i don't enjoy carrots much, but loved this dish. the carrots wonderfully absorb the apple juice. i wouldn't add extra honey, unless you wanted it extra sweet...for me, the sweetness of the carrot and apple was just right. i've never been inclined to make carrots, but this i would again!

This recipe has earned a permanent place in our family cook book. Next time I will increase the honey to make the glaze a little sweeter. I will also try tis recepe with orange juice. I cooked this dish in a wok.

I used Maple Syrup instead of honey. I also tried chopped mint leaves instead of the scallions. Either way, this was the best carrot dish I have ever had!

This is a great, easy side dish - never any leftovers

This is a great side dish. The scallion tops really set this off.

This recipe has a really good flavor. The carrots pick up flavor from the apple juice. If you decide to double the recipe, do not double the liquid, it's not needed and double liquid takes "forever" to reduce.
