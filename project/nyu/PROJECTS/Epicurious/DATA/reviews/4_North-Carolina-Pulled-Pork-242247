I have made several pulled pork recipes- this one is king! The spicy sauce and coleslaw are necessary elements to a great pulled pork sando!! Have a friend from Memphis, and he loves it when I make this recipe!

The vinegar sauce ruined the pork...way too tangy. The spice rub is delicious.

This is a wonderful recipe, great for a crowd. I also didn't have a grill. I bought two 3 pound pork shoulders, doubled the rub, marinated with the rub overnight and then cooked the meat in a dutch oven for three hours at 350 degrees. The meat was perfect. I was very skeptical about the sauce, it doesn't taste good on its own - very vinegary. But on the meat it is perfect! I made a different cole slaw (creamy cilantro coleslaw, found on epicurious), sweet potato fries and it was a great meal!

This is the definitive n.c. pulled pork recipe. I owned a restaurant at an airport that serviced charlotte n.c. and all of the caroline visitors LOVED my pulled pork and the vinegar sauce based on this recipe. It really is the best!

The pork tasted great with or without the barbeque sauce. Because I baked mine in the oven, I poured some liquid smoke (hickory flavored) on it just prior to baking. Delicious.

This is a keeper! Got rave reviews from all guests, and had very little leftover even though we started with a lot of meat. Don't skip the coleslaw or the vinegar sauce - even though the meat is great on its own, the accompaniments really make it sing.

So...I simplify this. I put it in the crockpot after I put the rub on it. I pour the mop right on top of it and slow cook it over night. Put foil down underneath it or something because it may spill out some if your crock pot is jammed. Then you just take out the pork in the morning and pull it apart. I try to cut the fat off it a little before I pull it. I put the BBQ sauce on the side and I make the coleslaw. It's awesome. :)

This recipe was fantastic! I made a double recipe of the pork (10 lbs) since we were feeding about 20 people and it was the perfect amount-- there was none leftover. The single amount of the vinegar sauce and coleslaw was needed-- it makes a lot. The vinegar sauce was the perfect spiciness, and the coleslaw (I used red cabbage since that's all I could find) added the perfect crunch to the sandwiches. I will definitely make these again-- minimal effort, just a little patience, and it's so delicious!

We followed the recipe to a tee, and it was perfect. Truly exceptional pork. The cider vinegar is so good. We served it without buns but with corn bread pudding, black eyed peas and collard greens. Best meal ever. We now know why they call it "soul food."

So yummy. I smoked the meat for 2-3 hours on a gas grill, then threw it in the slow cooker for another 3-4 hours, before pulling off the meat and mixing it with the vinegar sauce. DELICIOUS.

I didn't have the smoking capability, so I made this in the oven, but I used the rub and the vinegar sauce (to which I added a little mustard and whiskey), and it was delicious! I cut the meat in four pieces, browned them, then stuck them in a covered braising dish in a 350 degree oven. I was afraid four hours wouldn't be enough time, but when I checked on it after three hours, it was falling apart and delicious. Put it in a crockpot with the vinegar sauce to serve. There was a lot of fat leftover in the bottom of the baking dish, which I'll probably save and use for potatoes or something (I tossed a bit of it back into the shredded pork for more flavor).

Marinated the meat as per the recipe with the substitution of grated onion in place of the onion powder. Then, since I live in an apt and haven't regular access to a grill, placed the meat in a crockpot and cooked on low for several hours Delicious seasonings!.

I made this for the Rose Bowl tailgate and now will do the same for the Super Bowl. I, too, did this in the oven and transferred to the slow cooker to "hold" and serve. I put about a 1/2 t. liquid smoke in the bottom of the covered roaster with about 1/2 cup of water and had the meat sitting up out of the juice (used a turkey rack). It was very good and went fast! Also, used chibatta rolls as they hold up better than hamburger buns. Maybe not traditional, and, this is CA.

We make this for our annual street BBQ, 4 pulled porks, start BBQ'ing at 7 am on 2 charcoal BBQ's. Serve it with wheat tortillas and a fruit/avocado salsa. It is my favourite taste of all time!!!!!

AMAZING!! I made this in the oven and made sure to baste the meat every 15 minutes to keep it moist. The vinegar sauce is a MUST! I added a ton more sugar and would probably not use so much cider vinegar..it seemed a bit tangy. I put the rub on the meat the night before. The next day I put it in a pot with a lid and let it cook in the oven on 350 for about 3-4 hours. I then took it out pulled the pork and put the meat and vinegar sauce together in a bowl. I then wrapped up the meat in foil and put on the grill to cook the vinegar sauce in it. (I didn't originally cook it on the grill because I didn't have time to watch the coals to make sure it stayed hot.) I put the hot meat on a bun and it was AMAZING! My husband who is a HUGE fan of pulled pork sandwiches gave it a 10+ I highly recommend this. Next time I'm going to get WAY more meat. There was more fat then expected.

this was a bit time consuming but excellent and certainly worth the time. Slaw and vinegar sauce were excellent additions.

I cooked mine in the oven as I did not have the required smoke box. I marinaded it over night and cooked it in my cast iron pot for 6 hrs which was plenty and the meat fell apart beautifully. Loved the flavour of the meat but honestly did not love it on a sandwich which kinda dissapointed me. We used the left overs for tacos the next day with a hor home made salsa, light sour cream. lots of shredded lettuce and some grated cheese, heavenly! Will try a more barbques flavoured recipe for the sandwichs next time but all in all wa s a wonderful recipe.

AMAZING!!! My husband and I quadrupled the recipe and made 18 pounds of this for the 4th of July party. Yep, that's a lot of pork. Followed the recipe exactly. It was gone by the end of the day. Most everyone had three sandwiches, because they couldn't stop eating it. One person even ate five in one sitting (We call him Kobayashi now.) Absolutely worth the time involved.

I used this rub to make smoked spare ribs on the 4th of July, with the matching vinegar sauce that i basted it with. It was AMAZING. Not too peppery, although there was a lot of pepper, and not too sweet, which I hate. Absolutely GREAT, I will for sure make it again!

Hands down the best Pork recipe I have ever used and tasted. Try adding more red pepper flakes or your own mix of pepper flakes to kick the sauce up a notch.

Very, very good. The kids and my husband love this. I used my own rub from a rib recipe, did the 24 hour marinade, then seared it and baked it (covered) in a 325 degree oven for 1/2 hour per pound. The vinegar sauce is the best I've tasted. It's great reheated, very forgiving, and perfect for those busy nights when everyone is going in different directions!

Excellent! Cooked on my gas grill for about 6 hours.... actually added some chicken breasts too. Marinated both for about 24 hours with the rub. Didn't know what "hot paprika" was so I added a bit of cayenne. Very, very good!

Fabulous. I made it in my slow cooker also - started on high for 45 minutes, then low for the rest of the day. My kids loved it. Don't skip the vinegar sauce, it is wonderful. Can't wait to try on the grill when I have a weekend free.

This is OUTSTANDING! I let the rub marinate for two days because I got busy and couldn't get back to it. The charcoals went dead after 3 hours, couldn't get 'em started again, so I covered the roast with foil and finished it in a 250 oven for another three hours or so. I only used half of a butt roast. This literally melted in the mouth. I didn't shred it, but sliced it and splashed it with the vinegar sauce. The sauce is a must. An excellent counter-balance to the rich meat. I could NOT stop eating this! Every time I passed through the kitchen I had to slice off another piece, douse it with some sauce and suck it down. Wonderful deep, hickory-smoked flavor. This'll knock your socks off. YUM, YUM, YUM!

Yes, it takes a bit of time, and prep, but you'll think you've died and gone to heaven! As a transplanted Kentuckian with a Tenneesean former pit-master brother-in-law, I'm a pretty good judge of "'cue". The vinegar sauce is great and is a MUST, but I prefer a creamy sweeter slaw instead of a vinegar-based one. In fact, if you can find Marzetti's brand "The Original Slaw Dressing" with a recipe from 1896, you WILL be in heaven. So, FIRE UP THOSE GRILLS!!

I used this recipe as a base for a 13lb bone-in pork shoulder I smoked on my Traeger grill: Doubled the amounts; Rub sat for 24 hours; Smoked at 225 - at 13 hours the internal temp was 160; Bumped smoker to 250 and internal temp hit 190 3 hours later (on smoker for 16 hours total) Served with coleslaw - delightful

Having lived in North Carolina for almost 10 years, this is the best "do-it-yourself" recipe I've found... if you like NC style BBQ, you'll LOVE this!

Great recipe. I followed it pretty much as is but just made half a batch of the Vinegar Sauce. Everyone loved it and I'll certainly make it again.

This was a great recipe. The vinegar sauce really makes it - a nice tangy taste with the sweetness of the pork. The slaw with this recipe is not worth making; I would look for a better slaw recipe or seriously dress this one up.

Wow! This is the best bbq I've ever had and it's so easy to make. Didn't change a thing in the recipe and will make it again as soon as possible.

This is a great recipe. I didn't grill it, but made it in my slow-cooker. I applied the rub the night before and got it out and put it on the cooker in the morning before work. After it was cooked, while I was pulling the meat apart, I reduced the juices that had accumulated in the cooker on the stove and then added that to the vinegar sauce. It was fantastic. My husband had three helpings! Would definitely make it again this way. It tasted great and was super easy.

This is a great recipe. This can be done in a oven. Brine the shoulder overight in 4 gallons of water mixed with 2 cups of salt and two cups of sugar. Stick that rascal in a 375 degree oven for 5 hours then turn the heat down to to 350 for the last two hours. Yes Hell!

This recipe is a stone-cold crowd pleaser. We've been making similar Eastern NC BBQ for years, and this recipe gets the flavor right in a form that doesn't take a lifetime to learn. It's easy to cook the pork on the grill, and overdone really isn't a problem if the skin is removed. Need more? Just grill a couple shoulders in advance, pull them apart as specified, and freeze the pulled pig without saucing. I guarantee your guests will love this Q.

In my copy of the Barbecue Bible the pages this recipe is on are dark and nasty from all the times I've mixed rub and sauce over them. This recipe is a good balance between Eastern and Western NC style bbq and fans of both will like it.

Although this is great, I've got a suggestion. I live in eastern NC and grew up doing "pig pickings". Try using the whole hog. It's best to use about a 120 to 180 lb hog so you get the right mix of fat. At the end, chop it all up, with "some" of the fat. Chop into about 1 inch pieces, mixing all the different cuts together. Use 1/2 to 1 gallon of vinegar with red pepper, salt, and black pepper heated together. Cook about 6 1/2 hours on cooker large enough to hold the whole hog. (Meat side down) Flip and cook about 1 1/2 hours on the skin side to brown the skin. Be sure to cut up a small amount of the skin with the meat. Cooking temperature about 300F on a large pig cooker due to distance from the fire. Only green oak coals will do!

Always a crowd pleaser, my friends and family always know it's summertime when I make this. I make this in my kettle smoker instead of the grill and it turns pink and just falls off the bone.
