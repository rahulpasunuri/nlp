Just made this with the last of my tomatoes from the garden :-( Great pie, though. My husband says it's the best tomato pie he's had (and we live in the south). I used Vegenaise instead of mayo and it was fine. I reckon you could use sour cream, though i haven't tried it. As for the folks having trouble with the dough/saran wrap situation -- just forget the saran wrap. (i hate to see plastic used when it's not necessary.) I always do my biscuits and pie doughs with a floured flour-sack-type kitchen towel. never fails! also make sure your butter is COLD, and chill the dough for a spell before rolling out, as it tends to warm a bit when you mix it, especially if you use your hands to cut in the butter.

So good. I roasted the slices of tomato and then drained them well and had no trouble with too much liquid. Loved the crust- definitely recommend saran wrap for rolling it out. This was a fantastic use of the tomatoes and herbs from the garden!

LOVED this pie! I loved the lemon mayo combined with the sharpness of the cheese and sweetness of the corn. YUM! Couple changes I made: I used prepared biscuit dough (like the kind that comes in the tin roll) did not use saran wrap because that was just a headache. i just put a bit of flour down and rolled it out. I didn't bother to puree the corn.I also sliced the tomatoes (did no peel) and put them under the broiler until they started to get charred. Then I just drained off the extra liquid, patted them with a towel a little bit and that seemed to work because I did not have the "liquidy" issue I read in other posts.

I made this last night with a few changes. I used 1/2 c whole wheat flour, skipped the mayonnaise, didn't bother peeling the tomatoes, didn't puree the corn, and I drained the tomatoes. It was liquidy still, but delicious. Look at my pictures of the recipe and my changes here! http://beeeats.blogspot.com/2011/08/corn-and-tomato-pie.html

Delicious! Some suggestions: I would recommend the following timesavers: don't bother peeling the tomatoes, and don't bother processing the corn. I would start with the base of tomato, corn, cheese, and mayonnaise mixture and experiment: next time I will try adding some ortega chiles and hot sauce! The pie was a little watery despite draining the tomatoes and the corn, but I don't think it detracted from the flavor. Next time I would press on the tomatoes a little more. The crust is a little hard to work with. It has a different texture than a pie crust -- you can't roll it out with light strokes, you really have to lean on it. And, since my saran wrap is only about 12" wide, it was hard to keep it between the layers. Suggestions, anyone? Having said this, the crust was delicious, butter and "biscuity".

My good friend has been RAVING about this recipe for years, so I finally made it this weekend. It's a lot of work, with the draining of the tomatoes and the making of the pie crust, etc. It was good, and a good way to use the yummy product. But with the cheese and pie crust and mayo, it's a lot of unnecessary calories and fat. My favorite, (and my family's favorite) TO DIE FOR corn and tomatoe reicpe is the Tomato, Corn and Scallion salad from Gourmet, and available on this site.

I have made this twice in three days. The first time,I drained the corn and tomatoes and used half whole wheat flour, as well as scallions instead of chives. I did press on the tomatoes a little to get rid of some more juice, and my bottom crust was not soggy at all. The second time, I had no corn or sharp cheddar, so I used semolina bread crumbs for the corn (only used about 3/4 cup, and you could easily do rice). Also used a mix of goat cheese and mild cheddar, since mild cheddar alone is not a good substitute for sharp. Again, delicious, and no soggy crust. I prefer the original corn and sharp cheddar version, but I think the secret to a non- gooey crust is to use some whole wheat flour and to press down on the tomatoes as they drain. You don't have to waste the juice--just drink it. Oh, and you don't have to have beefsteak tomatoes-- used a mix of heirloom red and yellow (don't know the names), as well as some green zebra. The key is to get the most flavorful tomatoes you can find. If your tomatoes aren't delicious when you taste them, don't make this recipe.

Since tomotoes and corn are again in season and my homegrown basil and chives are gorgeous - I again started obsessing over this recipe. I think I have finally got it figured out - the bulk of the moisture was coming from the corn, not the tomatoes. I drained the processed corn well, and had a beautifully textured and delicious pie. And have made it twice in as many weeks.

Loved this receipe so much I made it two days in a row last week. Delish! I strained the tomato and added some tapioca to the corn mixture and still had a very wet pie. I drained it off after the first piece was cut and it wound up being fine. This receipe is definitely a keeper!

Thanks for all the very helpful reviews. I too made this again as soon as we finished the first! I started with a good 2 lbs. tomatoes from a local farmers market and after removing their skins chopped them roughly, removed tough parts and some seeds, and drained in a colander for 1/2 hour. This really helped the sogginess issue. I didn't process the corn, just scraped it off the husk. I also changed the amounts of some ingredients: mayonnaise down to 1/4 cup, cheddar down to 4 oz (1 cup) and herbs up to a generous 1/4 cup, using mostly chives with some basil, rosemary, thyme and tarragon. Next time I'll get all the ingredients ready ahead of time and get off my feet for a while before continuing!

We loved this pie, a lovely end of summer dish which I served for a light dinner, accompanied by a green salad and dessert. I followed the recipe exactly. The bottom crust was not soggy and stood up well to the slightly juicy filling. The only drawback to this recipe is that it is relatively labor intensive. Still, I will make it again, and try to do more advance prep to streamline putting it together.

This was much better than I was anticipating. The seasonal produce really shines and the biscuit crust is a nice change. Mayo was great but you could likely get away with less or none at all, especially if you're working with good quality produce. Not sure if the soggy bottom is avoidable on this one. I don't like to deseed tomatoes since there's so much flavor there; but I did deseed for this recipe and there was still a lot of wet in this pie. Maybe Julia wouldn't approve of this soggy bottom but I do--it's too delicious not to. Looking forward to making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and really loved the forward corn flavor. Unfortunately my bottom crust was soggy. Next time, maybe sprinkle dry bread crumbs on the bottom before baking? Blind bake?

This was a perfect summer meal -- it tasted straight from the farm. I followed the directions pretty much to a T, except that I used scallions in place of chives (didn't have 'em) and doubled the basil. To avoid a soggy crust, I drained the tomatoes and the corn. I served this with a simple spinach salad (with sliced grapes, almonds and a raspberry vinaigrette) and a bottle of vihno verde. Lovely! Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

I love this dish - the way I make it. (The identical recipe was published in 2003 and I've made it several times every summer for the last few years.) Biggest change: put all the biscuit on top, like a cobbler. A bottom biscuit crust is bound to be soggy. For me, 3 ears of corn is more than 1 1/2 cups, but 3 ears is the right amount. I also skip the multi-layering: I put a layer of sliced tomatoes, all the corn and mayo, then another layer of tomatoes and then the biscuits. I leave out the cheese - if the corn and tomatoes are good it just gets in the way. Today I was out of chives and fresh basil and I substituted minced onion and dried basil and it was still great. I think I'll use onion every time: it was just strong enough.

Except for the addition of the corn, this recipe is nearly identical to the Savory Tomato Pie I have made for years from Lee Bailey's "Tomatoes." I couldn't really taste the corn in this recipe; would try it again with more corn and less cheese or just go back to my original recipe. I lightly salt the tomato slices and let them drain on a rack for about half an hour to remove some of the moisture. This is especially important for leftovers, as the bottom crust can get soggy upon standing.

I really like the biscuit crust. I think it went well with the sweet filling. I didn't follow instructions to a tee. Instead I diced the tomatoes and mixed it in with the corn. I drained both in a sieve and then mixed in onion and the mayo/lemon dressing before adding it to the crust. Overall, I would definitely make this again - probably for a picnic.

Served the pie for brunch today, with a bit of a sour cream side. I will definitely make this again but add more corn. I am a novice at crust, but this was easy to make and very tasty.

So, I'd call this good but I think it could be improved. The biscuit crust was really quite good, and I like the idea of using biscuit as crust. We found that it got very wet inside - maybe from the tomatoes? We were thinking that if we made this again we'd cut the tomatoes in smaller pieces (rather than slices) and salt and drain them for 10 minutes or so before adding. It seemed like there was a too much cheese, as well. I'd play around with it, maybe going down to 5 ounces from 7, and maybe experiment with different cheeses. My mouth felt like it would like pepper jack cheese in the mix, so that might be worth a try. In all, I think this was good, but perhaps a few minor tweaks would make it excellent.

Made this tonight as a side dish for dinner. It was very tasty and easy to make. I did have to make a couple of changes. I used spinach and green onion instead of the basil and chives because that's what we had on hand. The only problem with the recipe was the dough stuck to the plastic wrap when rolled out. Rolled it out on a well floured surface instead and it came out fine. The biscuit crust was the best part!
