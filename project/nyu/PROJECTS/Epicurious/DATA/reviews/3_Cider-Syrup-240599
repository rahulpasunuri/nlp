This is absolutely delicious on baked french toast (the time for making the syrup matches the baking time for the french toast, and so both are easily served together). It does require monitoring to avoid the issue experienced by a prior reviewer. After bringing to a boil, I gradually reduced the heat as the syrup reduced, eventually ending on low at the end of the cooking time. I did make sure I maintained the boil for the whole time.

This makes a delicious, tangy syrup!

I started this boiling, expecting to have 25 minutes to prepare other food. It burned to a thick black glaze within ten minutes.
