This sounded intriguing and my curiosity was rewarded. The crab-fennel combination was wonderful--light, bright, and fresh. Like a few others, I didn't bother with the structured composition.

Had amaranth leaves from the farmers' market and thought this looked interesting. I made it without the crab, since many reviewers suggested it overwhelmed the crab. We did not like the combination of flavors. Also seemed like too much salt for the amount of fennel and lettuce.

I hate to be the naysayer when other clearly liked this recipe, but this is a waste of good crab. The dressing is too tart, the salad ingredients don't come together, and the crab got lost in the strong fennel.

This is a great salad. I've made it several times, served it to different groups, and almost everyone loved it. I like to put the crab under the greens and fennel for a tasty little "surprise."

We liked this very much, except I would not only shave the fennel but also cut it smaller next time, so that it fit in the mold better

Great salad - have made it twice already. Loved the texture of the fennel - used a very thin slicer, so it looked and very elegant. I also enjoyed the crab in the dressing - the entire experience was unusual and appetizing. The best part is that although it is a light salad, it is very satisfying.

We love this salad--it's light, easy and an unusual and refreshing combination of flavors. The plating isn't worth the fuss: just toss the crab with the greens and put a peppermill on the table!

An unusual combination of flavors that work, but are not stellar. The fennel dressing is good, very crisp and distinctive flavors, but they nearly overpower the delicate, sweet crab. Now and then a bite is a "wow" but most often the flavors just didn't balance.
