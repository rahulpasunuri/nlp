To A Cook From Boston. I haven't tried this recipe and probably won't because of the reviews. I just wanted to know what you have against Canadians, eh?

Infuriating - thats my opinion of all the opinions. I'm from Ct. and have eaten my fair share of The Ultimate Burgers. What the reviewers seem to forget is the fact that Louis' has been doing this longer than all of you johnny-come- lately's. In 1898, there was no pre- mix seasoning, "over-the-top" anything! Lassen's was the first and still is the best. Simplicity and perfection - Period.

Highly misleading title. This is a 'simple basic' hamburger, not an ultimate. Ultimate is all about crazy over the top greatness that knocks your socks off because you've never had anything so good. This just tastes like the most basic of burgers - salted meat.

If you want a burger that tastes like a burger here is a recipe for you. Mix-in seasoning has become so standard that a lot of people never taste the real thing. How great to see internal temperatures! I worked as a professional cook for many years and have learned the hard way not to trust firmness as a measure of doneness. Use enough salt and make your own ketchup and you will be miles ahead of most of what is available in the best burger joints.

I really didn't need a recipie to tell me to salt and pepper the outside of the hamburger.

Really disappointing. I liked the sauce though and would perhaps make a variation of it again. Not enough heat. Meat had little flavor...more of a meatloafy thing than a burger. :(

It wasn't bad, it just wasn't the best burger I've tasted. The best burger (in my opinion) I've tasted came from Hamburger Hamlet. This was a simple burger. I agree on not handling the meat too much as it toughens the patty. Whatever happened to mom's Ultimate Burger? Remember with the chopped onions and green peppers inside?

Yep, ditto the previous reviewer. It's nice enough, if what you want is unadulterated ground beef. (And I know plenty of people who do) Be sure to use the best meat you can find, because all the flavor will be coming from the meat. I think I wanted just a little something extra, though.

Good, but, still looking for something better.
