We loved this recipe. Having made it a few times, we would recommend boneless rib-eye steaks instead of sirloin steaks - more flavorful and tender. We also suggest testing for preferred doneness after 4 minutes per side. Because the sauce is so tasty, we didn't reduce the sauce ingredient amounts when we made 2 or 3 steaks. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested using less mustard.

Easy to make and very tasty, especially when the grill is buried in snow. Used 2" sirloins and made the recipe as printed. I wish people who make wholesale changes would not rate the recipes. If you used venison, thyme, red wine and no garlic, you did not make this recipe.

A very good and super simple Au Poive recipe! I used tenderloin, but I'm sure it would be delicious with any tender steak.

Rating: 2
I'm somewhere between 2 and 3 forks. The mustard overwhelmed this recipe. We used less than the 2 tablespoons per side and it was still too much. Also, more peppercorns needed to be au poivre. The dijon cream sauce was good but was lost with the mustardy steaks.

made this last night with filet mignon's. it was great. used onions with sugar, no shallots. i also used redwine instead of brandy. i cut back on the mustard too. would make for guests any time.

I don't know what I did wrong but this was pretty bland. I did use heavy cream instead of whipping cream and it never thickened. But the taste was pretty boring. I won't try this again.

this was awesome. i substituted white onion and sugar as other commenters because i forgot to buy shallots, and used bourbon instead of brandy, and added a splash of balsamic vinegar just because. has anyone figured out the best way to mash the peppercorns just right? i find that they are too fine if you use a pepper mill, but my rolling pin method left quite a few whole peppercorns.

I really loved this but I made a few changes...I used venison as that is what I had taken out. I didn't have shallots so used red onion and didn't have brandy so used red wine. I also added thyme and a couple handfuls of quartered mushrooms. I skipped the garlic but would add it next time.

Pretty darn good as is... 2 minutes for "thickned sauce" is not what I would call thick... more like 10 mins for me.. Hint....go easy on salting the beef and think low salt beef broth!

Wanted to make something mouth watering, and scrumptiously delicious for our company last night ... I nervously prepared this recipe for the 1st time -- it was beyond delicious! EVERYONE loved it! Prepared as instructed, except we grilled the steaks. Our friends left with the recipe! A must have recipe for everyone's recipe box! Bon Appetit!

delightful! so quick and easy. used minced onion with a bit of sugar as I didn't have shallot. worked fine, but would recommend the subtlty of shallot.

Rating: 3
as a reformed vegetarian, this was my first time attempting a proper steak au poivre. it all worked out fabulously, i added a dash of sugar to the sauce since i used a regular onion and it lacked the sweetness of shallot. other than that, parfait...

Very delicious and easy...we had no brandy so we used a good bourbon...what a GREAT way to do steaks! A fantastic variation from the same old steaks on the grill....

Great dish, quick to make...I added a pint of baby bella mushrooms in with the onions, and it was fabulous!!!!

This recipe was great!!! I accompanied it with basmati rice and a side of avocados and the steak turned out so delicious i didnt even pour the sauce on top of it and instead I used it for the rice. I am a big steak lover and this recipe is simply great. It´s also very easy to make because the ingredients are already in your fridge, and its very quick. WILL MAKE AGAIN.

This is an outstanding recipe! Very flavorful. Make sure to use a good cut of meat. Enjoy, we did!

I have made Steak Poivre a few times using the recipe from the Surreal Gourmet on the Food Network website. It calls for green peppercorns and Cognac which is flamed. I find it to be more authentic than this one.

I first had a similar recipe in Paris about 5 years ago and loved it. When I saw this recipe, I just had to try it. My husband and I are in love with it! In the future, I'd reduce the amount of mustard but it will definitely be served to guests.

Rating: 3
I reduced the amount of mustard for each side of the steaks and it came out great. The only thing I would do differently is decrease the amount of Brandy or let it reduce over heat a little longer. It seemed a bit strong but altogether it was lovely.

Rating: 2
The cream sauce is delicious! I use it everywhere I want a nice sauce. However I thought the steak was just awful. Adding mustard to the sides was overkill. I made the same thing later by grilling the steaks plain and pouring the sauce over and it was wonderful.

All of the 4-fork reviews made me think that this would be a show-stopper. Like a car stopping a hound-dog, it stops something alright: think ROADKILL. Two perfectly good sirloins WASTED. If I wanted to smother something in mustard, I would eat some inedible Chicken Mcnuggets. NASTY!!

Rating: 4
Interesting combination. I have made it several times and always get the same comments from our guests YUM!!!!. A handful of mushrooms goes well.

Rating: 4
Fabulous, simple, flavorful. I added sautéed mushrooms, substituted whisky for the brandy (had none) and used slightly less mustard. Served with lentils and sautéed fennel and carrots (the sweetness of the vegetables balanced the pepper/mustard spiciness. Use a good cut of meat. Marvelous.

I have made several versions of this recipe, both at home and on the job and this one ranks as one of the best. I made this last night with bone-in pork loin chops, also called Iowa chops, and was very pleased. The only other changes I made were to cut back a bit on the pepper to please my wife and I used canned vegetable broth for a lighter sauce.

This was the best steak recipe I have ever tried. I have eaten at Loch Ober and Grill 23 in Boston in the past 2 weeks and they can't touch this! The sauce is not too rich but ever so tasty. I will definitely make this again- particularly if I want to impress someone. *USE SIRLOIN*. I went to DEWARS in Boston and bought prime ( I think that's the name of the grade that is tops ). THIS IS AMAZING!!!!

I think I should have used a teflon pan. I felt that 2tbs. mustard on each side of steak was way too much. No way will that sauce thicken in 2 minutes-more like 15 as other cooks said. The sauce was very strong tasting...salty I guess. Just didn't care for it.

Oh wow!! This was fantastic! I used filet mignon (what the heck, it was our anniversary!) and same as the previous reviewer, didn't have brandy, so I used sweet vermouth (thanks for the substitution tip!). Will definitely make this again!

An excellent Sauce. Didn't have brandy so used sweet vermouth. It took a much longer than 2 minutes to thicken the sauce with my stove, so stay with it until it is good and thick.

This recipe is VERY easy to make and works with Tuna steaks as well. I used tenderloin, extra sauce and extra pepper in the sauce and it was delicious. The reduction took about 15 minutes -- much longer than the recipe stated, but the outcome was excellent.

Rating: 3
I would make this again, however, I would make the following changes: USE LOW SODIUM BEEF BROTH!!!! After I added the shallots and garlic, I added just the cognac and then ignited it. ( I forgot what that's called) Then just after the flame subsided, I added the broth, cream, and dijon. Finally, instead of reducing the sauce too much, I added fresh spinach to the sauce and simmered/wilted down the spinach and served it over the steak. It was delicious!

really good, and really easy to prepare

This is an extremely easy, fool proof recipe and absolutely delicious. Try a good Australian Shiraz with it. We prefer to grill the steaks, however you will need extra pepper in the sauce. For those that find the sauce salty, try a low sodium canned broth (or make your own - its much better). After adding the shallots and garlic to the skillet, add just the brandy and then set it a flame (will reduce the brandy taste but add a carmelization to the shallots/garlic). Then follow the recipe as described.

great sauce! I added 1/2 cup red wine to deglaze the pan, then added cognac & broth. Used only 1 T Dijon, as I didn't want it to overpower other flavors. My family loved it.

Wow, this steak is great! As others said, deglaze the pan with the brandy BEFORE adding the garlic and onions. I also added mushrooms at the very end of the sauce. It's just a great recipe!!!!

This recipe is standard steak au poivre with mustard added.It needs more cream as you want more sauce.How about the reviewers that were surprized that adding cream and mustard changed the meat flavor. Makes me wonder why they want recipes, when all they need is the BBQ.

I've read the reviews noting that the brandy flavor can be overpowering. When I made this, I was out of brandy, and substituted sherry. I thought the flavors were very weel balanced. I've passed the recipe on to about 6 friends -- I'll make it again!

I made this for a charity catered dinner and received rave reviews! I did alter the recipe - I deglazed the pan with a good red wine (instead of the beef broth), and didn't use the cream or brandy. I also added sliced mushrooms and 1 tsp fresh Thyme to the sauce, and then helped it thicken with 2 Tablespoons of butter (during the 'boiling'). WOW RESULTS!! WILL MAKE IT AGAIN!

I think the sauce was far too heavy, and overpowered the flavor of the steaks. I wouldn't make this again if you paid me.

Steak au Patooie!! What is this cloying cream sauce doing on a steak? Most of the ingredients for this recipe( except for the beef broth, mustard and garlic) are in a great sauce for cooking morels. But for steak, forget it. We really enjoyed the other au poivre reciipe listed here, with balsamic vinegar. That was surprisingly good.

Rating: 3
This is a delicious way to prepare sirloin steak. I used too salty a beef boullion and it was still good. Mushrooms would be a nice addition. We deglazed the pan with the brandy and while neither my husband, nor I could taste it, our 12 year old daughter could. I will either reduce it or omit it the next time, depending on the age group.

Wonderful! I also added mushrooms to dress up the sauce. We really enjoyed this and will definitely make again. Served with baked potatoes, steamed green beans and a salad of arugula, red onion, lemon juice and olive oil with shaved parm.

A great recipe and easy to make. I enjoy the blend of the ingredients. The only thing that I added was mushrooms, as I enjoy them weith steak. I would certainly serve this recipe again.

Rating: 4
As far as the "strong brandy taste" and for the " scrape up the peppercorns" etc. for sticking. I suggest to all to DEGLAZE the pan with the brandy. It will evaporate alot of the strong alcohol-taste and it will help to clean the surface for the sauce end to the recipe. I will personally tweak it a little more, next time I make this dish. I like it!

Rating: 3
Try this recipe, it is so easy!! I halved it and followed it exactly, except cooked 7 minutes each side for medium. Make sure to thoroughly scrape the pan when adding the shallots/garlic and liquid ingredients - even with oil in the pan, I had mustard and pepper stick. Also, keep reducing to lose the strong brandy taste. I made potato pancakes to go along with this - my husband was in heaven!

Rating: 2
This was so-so. I halved the recipe and came out with a really strong brandy taste, so I had to add a lot more cream and broth to it, and it was still very strong to taste. Once I tried it with the steak it was better, but this is not a sauce that I would serve as a gravy, it's more like a steak sauce. I'll try it again, the steaks themselves with the mustard and pepper were very good.

Rating: 0
A delicious recipe. I served this over a plate of grilled onions and the sauce was a perfect compliment to the spicy steak. Next time I will double the cream for a little thicker sauce.

Exquisite and down right good eating! Superior and simple sauce - excellent with beef (be sure to scrape all those tasty browned bits!). The sauce is also good with pork chops. I use 3 cloves of garlic and double the cream with extremely satisfying results!
