Made this as an appetizer for a dinner party and got rave reviews. Very refreshing, clean flavors, and very easy to make. I only used one serrano but would use two next time. I also served it with blue tortilla chips for added crunch and saltiness. It was enough for 8 smallish appetizer servings. Highly recommend!

Really liked this... made a few changes. Used sea scallops which were fresh and cut them into little pieces, used 1 cup of lime juice and 1/3 of orange juice and only one chile. People loved it!

Excellent Ceviche!! Will make again for sure. Used 1/2 c orange juice and omitted coconut. Only used one serrano so just flavorful spice. Used Sea Scallops instead of Bay and cut them into smaller pieces. Everyone raved.

This recipe is delicious. The bulk of the time is in preparation. Here are a couple of notes. I left out the coconut. Didn't have it in the house and don't use it that often. I substituted some pineapple, which was in season. I originally wanted to use mango, but couldn't find any. The pineapple is great, but also adds some acidity, so my vote would be for mango in the future. I substituted blood orange juice for plain orange juice, which adds a bit of tart, sweet flavor. It's certainly not essential, just a variation. The two chilies are not too hot if they're de-seeded. You could raise the heat a bit by leaving some or all of the seeds in. I was lucky enough to get local bay scallops from the Florida Gulf which were fresh and absolutely delicious. Even though they were small, I cut them in half. The bulk of the time for this dish is in the preparation. Lots of dicing and chopping, but nothing challenging. I marinated them for two hours and they were spot on. We also had them the next day for lunch, although by that time the pineapple's sweetness was pretty much gone.

I made this as written, with one addition, a splash of coconut milk. I was reminiscent of poisson cru, a favorite dish in French Polynesia.

PS - added cubed ripe avocado right before service - wonderful addition to flavours/textures! Had no coconut, but didn't seem to be a problem.

PS - I added cubed ripe avocado just before serving - outsanding. No coconut - didn't miss it.

Yummy and easy. Does involve a fair bit of mincing, chopping, but not complicated. I served it in glasses on a plate with lightly salted taco chips around and everyone devoured it! I used less OJ and it was very tangy and nice. My son has already made it again and a friend asked for the recipe. I used large scallops and texture was devine, but I will try it with firm white fish as it was expensive to make with scallops.

My boyfriend and I ran across this recipe, and neither of us had even heard of ceviche before, but we thought we'd try it out. We like all of the ingredients and thought they'd be good together. Maybe it's supposed to be extremely acidic, and obviously there is a lot of acidic juice plus tomatoes so that is somewhat expected, but it was too much for our tastes. The ceviche had sat for about 10 hours in the fridge- maybe that was too long for us. We ended up draining the juice, rinsing it with water, and adding honey and sweetened coconut flakes to balance out the extreme acidity. I know we followed the recipe, with the exception of using about 1/2 c fresh OJ and 1/2 c store bought OJ, but I don't think that would make that much of a difference. Regarding spice, I know we both have a decent tolerance to spice, but we couldn't even taste the serranos, so it might be better with some of the seeds. So that was our experience- we're not giving up on ceviche, but this one was too acidic.

Made this last night for a dinner party. I added 2 coarsley cubed fresh mangos to the mix and served the ceviche in martini glasses, starting with a layer of fresh cubed avocado. Delicious appetizer and spectacular bright presentation. Also, I thinly sliced the red onion for folks to remove easily per taste.

Made this for Mothers Day and everyone loved it. I omitted the coconut and forgot the OJ but still turned out great. I used two Serrano chilies and could have added more - I had no comments about it being spicy. I also used 1/2 lb of sea scallops, 1/2 lb shrimp and two medium lobster tails for a little variety. Also, cut the onion, Serrano and cilantro up VERY finely.

Pretty straightforward ceviche recipe, but very flavorful. One of my guests was not a coconut fan, so I omitted that and it was still tasty. I made a smaller batch without peppers for the children and heat adverse... after tasting both, this really needs the peppers to set it off. A great make ahead appetizer.

I made this and it was a huge hit with my guests. The only changes I made were that I skipped the orange juice and went heavier with the lemon and lime juice, and I also added some fresh, cubed pineapple. The sweetness of the pineapple perfectly balanced the hotness of the chiles.
