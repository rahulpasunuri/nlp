I've made this cake many times. It comes out great each time. It tastes good and it looks professional. I have substituted nectarines with blueberries. Great!

Agree this a great easy recipe that can be made as is or adapted with other fruit/berry/nut combos. I used plums/almonds but made the following modifications: Used 1cup AP flour + 1/2 cup whole wheat, 3/4 cup sugar in cake (plenty sweet enough especially with the topping), had no almond extract so used kirschwasser as suggested by another reviewer, and used a 10in springform pan (cooked for 40min). It was fabulous and I will be making it again and again and trying out other fruits as they come in to season

P.S to previous review. I've made this ahead and frozen it. I've used it as a dessert or a coffee cake for brunch.

This is a delicious and easy recipe. Don't skimp on plums. I used a spring form pan which was much easier and used 1 tsp of almond extract instead of 1/2. I have made this many times to rave reviews.

this is my go-to simple dessert for light fare entertaining & potlucks. i always add tons more cinnamon b/c i like it and i recently experimented with crystal sugar (in lieu of regular sugar) & a little chunky salt on top as well--delish! i have used plums, plumots (plum/apricot hybrid) and pears. they are all lovely! if you keep it tightly covered, it stays moist. i've never added cream or ice cream & people love it!

The finished result was delicious, however I think there was some mistake with the recipe, because the batter was about as dry as dough, and I had to add a cup of milk to make it more of a cake batter.

Very easy and delicious. The plum crop was not the best this year so I soaked the plums in amaretto for sweetness beforehand and it was a great addition. I also didn't use the salt since I didn't have any. I'm going to try it again with pears as some reviewers recommend.

Wow... this recipe is fantastic. Super easy and delicious. I couldnt find plums and substituted with peeled pears (3) and it turned out fantastic. Highly recommended!!!

I have been searching for this recipe for months- when it first came out I made it at least a dozen times it was so good. I kept buying plums so I could make it again but couldn't find the recipe. BTW Trader Joe's has the ground almonds which saves a step if you're lucky enough to have one near you.

Loved this, as did my guests. Made exactly as detailed. Used spring form pan as recommended - no need to flip. Will make again today with blueberries and stick in freezer for mid- winter treat.

Amazing. I made two for a big Fourth of July dinner and got rave reviews from a foodie crowd. I'd like to try it again with raspberries. Don't be alarmed that the batter seems stiff and hard to spread in the pan; juice from the fruit keeps the cake beautifully moist.

Made this into vegan almond cherry buckle to use up some fresh cherries. Followed the recipe but altered it by subbing in the cherries as well as margarine and Ener-G brand egg replacer for the butter and eggs, respectively. Very quick and easy to put together and it came out delicious.

An excellent Fall dessert. I made it as my contribution to a "dessert of the month" club and it was enjoyed with rave reviews. It is also very good the next morning with a cup of tea!

One of my favorites - easy and delicious! I have used with plums, nectarines and also pears (depending on season). I think it is best a little under cooked (ie 2-5 minutes or so), to remain moist. Guests at 3 different functions have asked me for the recipe...

Like everyone else, I loved this recipe. This only took about 15 minutes to prepare & turned out moist and flavorful. I used pears instead of plums (because they're in season) and it turned out great. I served it warm with vanilla icecream sprinkled with cinnamon, which everyone oohed & awed about. Super easy & beautiful!

This is a truly beautiful and delicious dessert, unless the bottom falls out of your springform pan like mine did the second I took it out of the oven! Luckily it was still edible, even though I was very sad to see such a pretty presentation ruined. My only complaint is the amount of butter in this recipe; my boyfriend didn't seem to mind, but I couldn't bear the overwhelming grease. I will definitely try using less butter next time, especially if I expect the cake to last a few days because the buttery taste gets more intense when the cake is refrigerated. Otherwise a great base for all different kinds of fruit (thanks to the almonds). Worth a second try in a new pan!

I used prune plums for this so it took the whole amount asked for in the recipe. It was delicious but it didn't look like the picture. The buckle rose up and swallowed the plums. Anyway I had some left over plums that I halved, poached in red wine and the placed on the top in the pattern shown. I served it with the five herb ice cream also on this site. They were a delicious combination.

I just made this for a little work get together and they asked me where I purchased it! Looks beautiful. It was the talk of the day. Used peaches not plums...and a little wheat flour with the white...

Made it twice. Agree with the reviewer that you only need four plums. Served with whipped cream. Good, not to die for, so many recipes, no reason to make one that's not incredible. Only one person out of the 10 or so I served it to asked for the recipe.

Excellent! I had quite small plums, so I just halved them and put the halves on the batter.

Rating: 4
this is a remarkable recipe--tastes fabulous and the recipe itself is spot on. i would point out only one thing wrt the actual recipe: you will NOT need to use EIGHT plums (unless you are talking about the really tiny sugar/prune plums). I never use more than 4 plums for this cake. (And just to note: one time I was out of Almond extract...and then to my dismay I discovered I was out of Amaretto (an acceptable substitute), too....so I used kirschwasser/cherry brandy instead and it worked to give a very nice cherry undertone to the flavors). I have made it several times to rave reviews. I will make it over and over again.

I've made it three or four times already. It's easy, delicious, and unique. It travels well, too.

This is a REAL winner. My mother made it on our last trip home and we could not stop eating it. She made it with walnuts and peaches, but followed everything else. I'm going to try it with plums to see if it is just as good! I've emailed this to my sister.....

Delicious summer dessert. I added an accompaniment of plums, sugar, cinnamon , plum brandy and amaretto because I had extra plums, but I'm sure it would have been just as good without.

Made it with peanuts instead of almonds. Everyone wanted more fruit so I served with berries or nectaries and cream over cake. Wonderful.

Made this with fresh figs and it looked and tasted great. The cake portion can be done in the food processor -- grind almonds, add sugar, butter, eggs, dry ingredients last -- couldn't be easier. A winner! Want to try it again with pears.

This was really delicious. Made the recipe exactly as written, but it would probably be equally good with any type of fruit.

I've made this twice, once with plums and once with peaches. It's a wonderful recipe. We had it for desert with ice cream, and had the leftovers for coffe cake the next morning. Everyone loved it.

This has become my favorit recipe for a fruit tart..Being from Denmark this tast so much like marcipan. A very favorit treat there. I am going to try it with peaches too. Very, very good.

Agree with San Angelo comments. Very pleasant morning or afternoon coffee cake. Texture and taste were best the next day.

I served this at a recent cookout and it was a big hit. It is also very pretty. I used large plums, so it took less, probably only three.

This cake was absolutely wonderful - I used 4 large plums - next time I would use more plums (as the recipe calls for) and slice them thinner. I plan to try making this cake with drained canned pitted sour cherries when fresh plums are not in season.

Great morning/coffe cake, even better the next day after flavors have combined. Going to make it again tonight with a combination or blueberries and peaches.

This was truly easy to make. The presentation is beautiful, and the reactions of my guests were fantastic! It was a huge hit. Most had seconds and even thirds. I would gladly make this again. I bet it would also be good with apricots, because they mimic the sweet-tartness in plums.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Used pluots, instead of plums, since I had never baked with this fruit. Turned out great. The cake layer with the ground almonds really distinguishes this recipe from others. Also used a 9" springform pan, which made it easier to remove. Would definitely make again!!

Forgot to mention in my review below: I had some pre-ground almonds (from Trader Joe's) and using those made preparation of this recipe really easy!

Rating: 4
Wow, fabulous! Very tasty cake layer...for the fruit I used blueberries (plums at the local fruit stand not very nice). Also used a 10 inch cake pan w/ 2 inch sides 'cause it's what I had; my oven is a bit slow so it worked perfectly. Only other substitution was 3 small eggs for the 2 large ones. We ate the cake warm with vanilla ice cream; next time I bake it I'll use freshly whipped cream....yum!

Loved, loved, loved it. So easy and very delicious. I didn't need as many plums as the recipe called for. I probably used about half the amount. No more could even fit. I did not inviert it like the recipe called. I could tell the one in the picture was not inverted. It came out looking just like the picture. Added vanilla ice cream and it was the hit of the party.

My favorite cake-- hands down. I'm normally a chocolate type, but from the perspectives of taste and presentation this cake is a stunner. I haven't served it to kids, but the adult response was close to worship.

I made this using apricots and gooseberries instead of the fruit suggested and it worked very well. Next time, however, no matter what fruit I use, I will layer the fruit (half the batter, half the fruit, rest of batter, rest of fruit). It a recipe to use over and over.
