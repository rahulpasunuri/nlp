I did not care for this. It was all the same texture, looked like mush and the cream turned me off. I did like the salsa verde and thought it brought the only sharp flavor to an otherwise bland dish.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times. First time I made the salsa verde, but, after that, bought the sauce and then followed the rest of the recipe. Sometimes I sautee onions and layer them, and sometimes I add some canned jalapeno peppers. I make this for 20 young people, and they love all the cheese and cream. It is a bit rich for us. It is delicious though.

My mom made this for a dinner party of 12 people and it was delicious. I'm saving this one for future use! I think jack cheese would be a great substitute for the mozzarella as well.

Addendum to previous review: Loved it when first made it, but after freezing it for a while, the tortillas seemed to turn to mush. I believe it was a complaint of a previous reviewer. Thus, this may not be a good dish to freeze for too long. The texture deteriorates.

Great casserole I can't imagine why some called it dry. Perhaps they did not use the broth when making the sauce. Used monterey jack rather than mozzarella and I used about half of the cream. Delicious.

Really good and pretty easy. I don't think it needs the cream. A little heavy. May use queso or Jack next time.

Delicious dish, though I admit I made quite a few modifications... I had a green bell pepper I needed to use so I sliced it, along with a yellow onion, and cooked them along with the tomatillos and garlic in the broth. I substituted a poblano pepper and a fresh jalapeno for the serrano chile as that was what I had on hand. Next time I'll add another jalapeno as it wasn't spicy enough for my taste. I blistered the tortillas over an open flame on the stove before layering and, as suggested by other reviewers, used Queso Fresco in place of the mozzarella. I liked the flavor of the cheese but it didn't get melty as mozzarella would have. I may try a combination of both next time. I layered as directed in the recipe but then added a final, extra layer of tortilla, mozzarella and sauce. In place of the whipping cream I loosened some sour cream with a bit of milk. I served it with some of the loosened sour cream drizzled over the top and a garnish of extra cilantro and green onion. It came out a tiny bit dry so next time I may cover with foil and then just brown the top under the broiler.

Great recipe! I have made it several times with the tomatillos from my garden. It was great with no substitutions, and any modifications I have made have also been tasty. Last week I used queso fresco instead of mozzarella and more tomatillos than called for (leaving some in chunks) and we liked it better.

First time using tomatillos and am not a big fan of cilantro, but other reviews convinced me to try it. Loved it, and will soon make another batch of the great salsa. Didn't have enough green onions on hand, so used half red onions - turned out fine. Used two serranos chiles with seeds, as suggested by others - nice hotness. Also, jack cheese instead of mozzarella - was fine. As mentioned in reviews, not that attractive looking on top. I added a sprinkling of cotija cheese, which added a little saltiness, but could probably make more attractive with more jack cheese on top, sprinkling of cilantro. Great next day from refrigerator. A little dry, but could just add some more of salsa.

I live in San Diego with great mexican food, and the idea of Mozarella cheese in an enchilada dish seemed strange. So I used queso fresco as someone else suggested. The taste was good but is was not the right kind of cheese for this dish-- it is a type of farmers cheese and didn't melt into the dish. Next time I will try either the mozzarella or a mix of jack and cheddar (or I will ask at the taco shops what kind of cheese they use for their enchiladas!) Initially the tomatillo sauce was a little bland. I added some lemon juice, red wine vinegar, and sugar (along with salt) to give it a little tanginess. The heat from one large serrano chile w/seeds was fine for average taste buds. I forget the cream altogether and the dish was still very good. It is great make ahead dish. I added guacamole and chips, mexican rice and Caesar salad and had an easy make ahead meal for company.

We just made tonight with jarred tomatillo salsa from Trader Joe's. It was awesome! We did try to find tomatillos but they are out of season now....went to like 5-6 stores in the city. Anyways, this could not have been easier. I agree, you can reduce or probably eliminate the cream. Not needed.

I wish I'd found this recipe earlier! This is so wonderful...made it exactly as written, other than cutting the heavy cream by about 2/3. I don't think the recipe needs the cream at all.What an easy way to make enchiladas. The tomatillo sauce is to die for. This will be a regular in our house.

Rating: 4
I thought this was a wonderful enchilada recipe...much better than any others I've had. It was flavorful, and simple to make. I made no changes other than to use grated mozzarella instead of strips. I will definitely be making this again. However, I do need a larger food processor because I had to split up the cooked tomatillo/broth mixture in two batches to blend. Also, I might add one more serrano if they are smaller sized. Lastly, this was excellent to serve the next morning to my house guests--we reheated, and added a fried egg on top! This one is a keeper.

Just made this tonight and it was delish! I took the advice of others. I added three serrano peppers and one jalapeno. Only kept the seeds of one serrano. Used leeks because I had them on hand and some leftover roasted chicken from NYE. From one of the reviews, I had a corn, black bean and tomato salad on the side which fit nicely. My partner went back for seconds and wanted thirds. My only constraint was time. It's not a weeknight meal unless you have everything on hand and/or get off work earlier than 6. Adding this to my favorites.

Rating: 3
delicious enchiladas. have made them several times, and have dealt with the cream differently than others who substituted half and half. i used the heavy cream (!) but only used half the amount that was called for. it was wonderfully rich, with only half the calories. sometimes i make extra salsa, to serve with chips on another day. the salsa is to die for.

Rating: 4
This recipe is outstanding! It is easy, delicious pure 'comfort food.' I followed the advice of others on here and used the real Mexican cheese, 'Queso Fresca,' from Oaxaca.. if you can find it. Makes all the difference in the world. I also added about a tablespoon of finely diced Jalapeno pepper (without the seeds or ribs) to the sauce. I did NOT use the whipping cream! (Too much fat and not necessary.) I substituted 1/4 cup of whole milk, which I had on hand, and drizzled it over the top. Lastly, I poured ALL the remaining tomatillo sauce over the top of the dish, rather than keeping any to serve later. I think it added to the moistness of the casserole.

These were really good, especially the tomatillo-cilantro sauce. I used half and half instead of cream and oaxaca cheese instead of mozz. I also used three serrano chilis and one jalapeno. They came together quickly and my house smelled so good!

Really good stuff. I'm always messing around with recipes based on reviews and my own style. I lightly toasted the corn tortillas in a non-stick pan. I added a 1/2 cup leftover white wine and a bay leaf to the chicken broth. I used 3 serranos and that give it a kick. I also subbed queso fresco cheese for the mozzarella. I added a layer of sauteed mushrooms over the 1st layer queso. Last but not least I used half & half in place of the whipping cream. Will go into my recipe file for sure.

I made this tonight for my sweetheart and I using a chicken left-over from making Roast Chicken with Pan Gravy earlier this week. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 2 Serrano peppers and 1 jalapeno to kick up the heat, and half-and-half to cut the fat. I also used a whole head of garlic since I love garlic and it was only a bit more than 10 cloves. Finally, I used queso fresco instead of mozzarella, after all, I do live in Dallas. :) We baked it for 25 min. and let sit for 10. It was very good, but I felt like it needed something more to take it to 4 forks. The avocado/tomato/corn salad mentioned by another reviewer would probably do the trick, and I'm going to try that with left-overs.

Made this for dinner. Tomatillo sauce was easy, and excellent, but will add one more chile next time- needed a bit more heat. The cream was really rich- too rich for me, and I will leave it out next time. Made with really good mozerrella, but it was lacking- next time will mix cheeses-jack with some pepper jack, or cheddar. The tomatillo sauce was very good though- that I will make again and play around with recipe next time!It holds promise!

I also used bottled salsa verde (Herdez brand) to prepare these: After sautéing the peppers and garlic, I added 2 bottles of salsa and a cup of chicken broth and reduced it for a while to a thicker consistency. I toasted the tortillas before layering as another reviewer suggested, used jack cheese (mozzarella in enchiladas?!) and instead of whipping cream, I covered the dish with fresh Mexican crema. Delicious, especially the next day. I served with a simple tomato/ fresh corn/ black bean/ onion/ avocado salad with cilantro that was perfect accompaniment because of the freshness.

I made this for my husband and kids last night. I think the kids found the cilantro a little heavy but my husband absolutely loved it!! I made just a few substitutions: I used green tomatoes from the garden instead of tomatillos (which aren't available in England), cooked chicken breasts with a little garlic powder and cumin, used low fat cheddar instead of mozz and dollops of greek yoghurt instead of whipping cream (to cut down on the fat). Finally, I sprinkled some sliced black olives on the top. My husband is devastated that we can't make this again until next summer's green tomatoes become available!

Great recipe!! Made this for a crowd and it was a huge hit! Wasn't sure how much the tortillas should be overlapping, so I just layed them out and tore some to cover the surface in a single layer and this was perfect.

Made the casserole tonight for dinner as a test for 4th of July (I've been looking for a new casserole to serve a big crowd). This one is a winner! My country grocery didn't have fresh tomatillos so I used canned, the sauce was still delicious. Do you think fresh would make a huge difference? 'Cause it sure was easy just cutting up the ones out of the can! I had read another recipe in Cook's Country that suggested heating the tortillas in a dry nonstick pan before baking, you heat until slightly bubbled and browned, to add more tortilla taste. Having never made this before, I assume that added more flavor. My husband said "very tasty" about three times! Used two serranos and next time will had a jalapeno for more heat. Mixed sour cream and whipping cream together for the topping. Used a rotisserie chicken, which made it even easier. Overall, we loved this dish and my friends will be getting it for the next holiday. I served it tonight with another epi recipe, brown rice with broccolini.

This is absolutely delicious. I printed the recipe and my husband wrote "A+" on it after dinner. I used two sereno chilies and added cumin to the sauce. I added Monterey Jack with the Mozzarella. I cooked one large chicken breast in chicken broth while I was making the sauce vs. buying a roasted chicken. I made less of it and baked in sqaure glass pan. It is worth the effort to make the sauce from scratch. I am adding this to my recipe box and will make it a few times a year.

Very easy. Very good. I didn't even know what a tomatillo was a few hours ago, but this was simple to prepare, very tasty and I would certainly make it again. My daughter and I keep going back to the dish and eating more. Like so many people suggested I used half mozzarella, half pepper jack and two chilies. I have never before reviewed anything, but I rely so much on the reviews when I am choosing recipes, I thought I'd join in.

Really delicious, and our guests thought so too! I LOVED the idea to buy the cooked chicken rather than cooking it myself - that's what will prompt me to make this again and again. To make it even quicker, I cheated and used salsa verde from a jar, and bought shredded cheese (used jack and it was fantastic). Also used light cream instead of whipping cream and it was great, granted I don't know what it would have been like otherwise, but it was great.

This recipe was great but the true star was the tomatillo-cilantro sauce! I made two trays for a large crowd, half of whom were eleven and under. As a result I used only one pepper and there was virtually no spice. If making again for adults only I think I might use a total of two and a half to really heat things up. The beauty was the ability to make a head. The night before I made the sauce and allowed to cool. I then put in fridge and prepared the chicken and cheese, stored in zip lock baggies in fridge. Right before cooking I assembled both trays in a flash than cooked. Everyone really seemed to love it....and there were no left overs..the only true test!

Wow, the salsa verde part was AWESOME, but the final dish wasn't spectacular. I'll definitely make the salsa again and again. To be fair, I tried to cut calories and only used about 4 Tbsp of table cream to thin light sour cream. Perhaps it'd be better with a little extra body from the cream.

Delicious+! 2 cosmos = I forgot the cream, and it was still great. I used 1/2 shredded mozzarella and 1/2 jullienned Monterey Jack. Nice texture combination.

Overall, I did like the layering concept as a major time-saver. Based on the other reviews, I wanted to bump the flavor up, so I substituted 1/2 cup of mozzerella with Cotija, a mexican hard cheese with a sharp flavor.

My boyfriend and I love it! We took the tip on using the canned tomatillos and it saved us a lot of time.

Ok...

We loved this dish! Three forks is good for me! I made the tomatillo sauce yesterday and put dish together this evening. Make sure you add enough salt to your tomatillo sauce, it's just bland and not too tasty unless seasoned right. We love cilantro, so I doubled cilantro. I used the cream, but will probably leave out next time, it just made the meal very, very rich. Some reviewers commented on dullness of color. Just save some more chopped cilantro to sprinkle on top, that will perk up that dull color. Served with salad. Perfect.

I did make a few modifications: I doubled the required cilantro, added a touch more broth as a result, used both mozzarella cut into strips and thinly sliced, along with some grated Manchego, and finally, used two serrano chiles...we like things spicy, and served it with a wonderful dry Cava and Tempranillo...perfect dinner party.

This was very good and pretty easy. If you're a stickler for following the recipe, read no further. I used canned tomatillos (it's essentially a casserole, c'mon, be lazy!), 2 jalapenos, and substituted Pepper Jack for the mozzarella. I also sprinkled crumbled cotija cheese and chili powder on the top. I don't think that it would have been as flavorful without the substitutions.....

I found this to be quick and easy and sooo delicious. I would make his again - especially for a party crowd or to bring to a potluck.

My six year daughter and I had fun layering the ingredients together then watching it bake to a cheesy & bubbling finish in the oven. The tomatilla sauce is excellent and might be a even better with an extra chili or two. I'd definitely make this again.

My usually reliable store did not have any tomatillos the day I was making this so I ended up bying a couple of jars of a tomatillo salsa. It was awesome (I realize that this is not following recipe).

Loved the sauce - with the addition of a home grown habernero pepper - but thought making it was a bit too time consuming. Leftovers were delicious.

Making the recipe as directed was relatively fast and tasty, but I expected more spice in an enchilada recipe. Next time I'll add more peppers and try the cojita or some pepperjack.

Definately not worth the time - there are much better tasting enchilada recipes out there. My kids also commented on how green it was.

there is no flavor element here. chicken, tortillas, mozzarella cheese, cream - all bland. green onions and cilantro lose a lot of their flavor kick when cooked. Maybe it would sell in the midwest, but in San Diego - sorry, no go.

Unbelievably good! My first time cooking with tomatillos and it was just phenomenal. Easy to do mostly ahead of time. I made the sauce, cut up the cheese and chicken all earlier in the day. It took 5 minutes to assemble and we were eating in another half hour. You have to try this!!

This recipe is amazing! The only problem is it took me a while to husk & wash the tomatillos and chopping everything took awhile. It also cost me about $25-30 to buy all the ingredients. It was 8 servings though and it tasted awesome so I guess it was worth it. If anybody has any suggestions for making this quicker... I'm interested.

Tried this on a whim with left over chicken, but usually make SOFT FRIED TORTILLAS WITH TOMATILLO SALSA AND CHICKEN (also on this site) and much prefer the chalupas (soft fried tortillas) to this dish. Something was missing in this one, but rather than play with it I'll make the other tastier recipe.

I made this really simple by mixing about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of chicken broth with a large jar of Trader Joe's tomatillo salsa, then reduced it for about 20 minutes. I also used half pepper jack cheese. It was fantastic! The color of the salsa changed, but it wasn't horrifying.

I made this last night for the in-laws. We were excited because the sauce looked gorgeous and smelled delicious when making it. We were all disappointed by the look of the dish after cooking. I expected the color of the green to change with the heat, but it was really unappealing to the eye without anything else going on. Perhaps I will try to add some tomatoes or something. Even regular salsa on the side didn't keep everyone from talking about the nasty color. My oldest said it looked like he was eating boogers. Goes to show how important appearance is to a dish. We did really enjoy the flavor, I may keep playing with it.

This is one of my new favorites. My boyfriend and I made this together while sipping margaritas and had a fun fiesta night. We noted that next time, we'll add another chile for more heat and we'll make 1/2 MORE sauce to use for leftovers. Our variations included some cheddar cheese for color and we served it with a dollop of sour cream. Perfect for parties!

I used canned tomatillos instead of fresh. This recipe is easy to make and so delicious. I'll definitely make it again!

This dish was fantastic!!! It pleased very picky eaters (my dad learned what a tomatillo was). I will definitly be making this dish plenty more times. (I'm also on Weight Watchers - and this fit right in - about 10 points for a healthy serving)
