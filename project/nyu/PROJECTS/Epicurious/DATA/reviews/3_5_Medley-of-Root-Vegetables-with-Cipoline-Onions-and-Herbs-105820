I make this every year for Thanksgiving and it is always a hit. I do take major liberties with the vegetables, however, usually cooking beets, carrots, fennel and red onion wedges (less peeling than with cipollini onions). I serve it at room temp so I can reserve my two ovens for the other dishes.

i really wanted to love this recipe, but it turned out to be just mediocre for the amount of work it takes. the veggies cooked at different rates, making it hard to determine when to call it done. i'd stick with simply roasting my favorite root veggies with olive oil and herbs next time.

This is an excellent recipe. I used the suggested combination of vegetables and herbs but also added small purple and red potatoes. I did not use the sauce, which seemed unnecessary. I had some difficulty with the vegetables cooking differentially (the parsnips and turnips took longer than the carrots, onions and potatoes.) These kept very well and reheated well too.

This will be the third year we have made this dish for Thanksgiving dinner; even those who claim to dislike vegetables seem to like it. I can never find rutabagas, so I substitute brussels sprouts. I also add a red onion in addition to the cipollines.

Roast veggies have always been a favorite of mine and now of my husband and friends. This is a first I've ever had that had beets in them. This is the recipe that I go to all of the time now, not just at Thanksgiving. If you want to make a meal special, add this for the vegetable course. It is that great.

This is a great roasted vegetable recipe...and very easy. I've made it several times for dinner parties and have received rave reviews. Most recently, I roasted the veggies early in the day then reheated them in a warm oven before serving. It worked perfectly.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving--lots of requests for the recipe.

A terrific winter dish, and very easy, though I found I needed 2 9 x 13 baking pans to fit all the vegetables in. Using fresh herbs is crucial. I used the broth from cooking wild rice, instead of chicken broth.

I didn't care for this dish. The beets were good, but the turnips were bitter and the rest was kind of bland.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone enjoyed it; there is a nice balance of the more bitter and more sweet root vegetables. I liked it much better warm than at room temperature though.

I couldn't find rutabagas so I left them out but it was still a delicious recipe and not too difficult to prepare. It was enjoyable at room temperature or warm though I found I needed to add a little more oil and vinegar just before serving (probably because I made it the day before and needed to reheat it). Definitely a recipe I'll keep and make again!

It would only be a vegetarian dish if you substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth. :O)

This recipe is wonderful. A great vegetarian dish and one that would be great for a person dieting.
