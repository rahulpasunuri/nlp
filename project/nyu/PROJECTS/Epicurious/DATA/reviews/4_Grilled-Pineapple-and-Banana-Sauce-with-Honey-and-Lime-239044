So, so, so good. And easy, too! I served it over Haagen Dasz Vanilla Bean ice cream. My barbecue guests loved it, even the kids! Can't wait to make it again.

Delicious! I added a little light rum to it which gave it a little spark. Make sure to let the fruit sit in the sauce for a while as they seem to give up more juice that way. We also served it over dulce du leche ice cream and it was delicious!

I have made this again and again. It's so simple and so good! I've made it on the stove top as well as the grill. Topped with coconut ice cream that is made locally and it's DELICIOUS!!

We made this exactly as the recipe called and we all thought it was excellent. Will make again! We did add a scoop of ice cream on top, which was a wonderful addition.

I love this! It has a great balance of sweet & tart thanks to the addition of lime. Rave reviews when served with dulce de leche ice cream,toasted coconut and macadamias. I've also had success roasting the pineapple in the oven (375 for 1+ hours, basting with pineapple juice and brown sugar).
