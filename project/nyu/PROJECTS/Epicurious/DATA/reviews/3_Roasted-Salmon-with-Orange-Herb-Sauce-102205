this was a good recipe. i lightly heated the orange sauce and poured some of it over the fish 1/2 way thru the cooking. served with steamed brocolli and spanish rice. Good (but not great) and easy to put together.

Just so so. Kinda like going to prom with your cousin...Nothing to rave over but better than staying home. I liked that it was rather healthy but as others have stated, the orange juice did add a twang that seemed to be a tad bossy with the delicate nature of the dill, green onion, and lemon. I did love the roasted onion touch on top. Would recommend doing twice as many as they shrink up and had the best flavor of all. Made more sause and heated it until thick and poured it over steamed broccoli crowns as well. Boyfriend said he would eat it again and he is picky. So while I would not recommend this for a party or other affair, for a light dinner when you are trying to watch calaories, this will be fine.

My guests loved this dish, including the sauce. I will make it again, but make up my own sauce -- this one lacked subtlety. The fish with its caramelized oranges and red onions was divine, however!

What a horrible recipe! I'd give it 0 forks, only that's not an option, so it gets one. The recipe can probably be made well, but as written, it's pronanly not going to happen. The salmon takes MUCH longer than the given time, unless you like rare, cold salmon in the center. And by the time the salmon is cooked to medium, the onions and orange have gone well beyond carmelized and have delved deeply into burnt. Oh, the sauce it much too watery and bright, too. No character at all. About as subtle as a brick to the head. Not only would I not make it again, Its pretty much put me off working with salmon filets ever again. I'll stick with steaks.

the sauce was indeed to liquidy. I disliked the recipe and would not make it ever again.

After reading the reviews, which were so so, I had selected another recipe for my salmon. However, when my husband volunteered to go to the grocery store for me, I accidentally read the ingredients for this dish! What a wonderful mistake I made. Everyone loved the entree. The only thing I did differently was to warm the sauce slightly in order to infuse the flavors.

Have made this recipe several times. Adding some sauce to the fish before cooking is a good idea, as is heating the sauce at the end. What would really make a big difference is thickening the sauce a bit before serving. Also, I'm not convinced that the onion adds much to the recipe as the orange really provides the dominant flavor.

it was nice, but not memorable not a huge ammount of flavour in the sauce.

We thought this was a very good recipe but not our favorite. I was surprised by the raves of the many previous reviewers. As suggested, I did add some sauce to the fish before cooking and heated the sauce before serving but it still lacked some of the defined flavor we like. Maybe the chili's suggested by another reader would add that zip.

I served this to four people last evening. They all liked it very much. I have found that if I read all the reviews you people have posted, that the dish is much improved. I thank all of you.

Absolutely stupendous! I didn't make any major changes - I had to use dried dill instead of fresh and also used a 3 lb. skin-on fillet. Made this for a Sunday family dinner. Everybody raved about it, even Grandpa, who's never happy with anything... My Mom, who is a terrific cook herself, declared that it was the best dinner she'd ever eaten... Enough said, I think! Cooking time for the larger fillet was about 25-30 min. for just the fish - it came out very moist and tender. Definately worth trying!

I followed the other readers recommendations on heating the sauce and adding the chilis. It was quite delicious. Although, the cooking time on the salmon was about 15 minutes. I had a problem with roasting the oranges & onions...they because very dry (I thought I added enough oil). My husband loved this dish (more then I did) and ate all the leftovers and practically licked his plate. The sauce makes it! I served with Garlic, Dill & Rosemary roasted new potatoes...they took the same amount of time as the whole fish process so that times very well. We also had lemon & paremsan asparagus. It was quite nice.

I made this recipe with a 3 1/2 pound (skin on) fillet of salmon for Christmas dinner for eight, so I obviously had to adjust my cooking time a little. The oranges and onions really kept the fish fragrant and moist, and the sauce--which I prepared the day ahead of time, boiling the juices with a little sugar and cornstarch before adding the herbs and chilling it overnight--was very light, pleasant but not overpowering. I removed the fish from the pan in two sections with a giant spatula, and pieced it back together on the serving tray before garnishing the seam with sliced oranges and pouring the now-room-temp sauce over. An impressive and extremeley easy main dish for a crowd!

The market was out of dill, so I used basil, and as one of the other reviews suggested, I prepared the sauce hot with a little cornstarch to thicken it. The result was delicious, though I should have added the basil at the last minute so the color was preserved. I served it with asparagus and roasted red potatoes. My wife returned from her soccer meeting to a fabulous meal, and a nice glass of Chardonnay. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this dish twice now. The flavors go well together and the presentation is pleasing. A nice change of pace from other salmon recipes I've tried. The second time I made this, I added some cornstarch to the sauce and heated it before spooning over the salmon. Much better! I have had to increase the cooking time of the salmon both times I made it. The oranges and onions blocked the heat to most of the fish. Has anyone else had this problem?

What a simple and elegant main dish! The ease of making this was just that... Easy! I had never cooked salmon before and this was a hit at my dinner party. Served with FetaMint Rice, Broccoli with Lemon Almond Butter and Winter Green Salad. A must to make again!!! Leftovers... few... but good!

I've made this dish several times now and both my husband and I enjoy it. It's easy, healthy and fairly quick. I like it just the way it is, but I may have to try it with the addition of the chilies.

This was my first foray into cooking salmon and I'll cook both the fish and the dish again. Trying to come up with a 'special' meal for 9 people is always hard, but this salmon, complimented by a mango and citrus salad, new potatoes, and broccoli and lemon was fab. I wish I'd read the reviews before cooking it though, I would have added the garlic and the chillie for a bit more zing.

I like sauces that have some substance -- this one was runny and made the fish cold. Not the best use of fresh salmon. I'd rather have something subtle so that the salmon is the star attraction.

I made this twice, the second time I added 8 Whole Pequin chiles and a touch of garlic on top of the onions before roasting, the combo of sweet and hot was great!!! Just remember to remove the chiles before adding the Salmon, as the chiles are HOT!!!
