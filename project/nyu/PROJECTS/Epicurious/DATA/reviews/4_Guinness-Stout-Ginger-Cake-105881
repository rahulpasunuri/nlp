After reading all the reviews I used a Bundt pan well coated with Baker's Joy. Had a little stickage but nothing awful. The cake was delicious-not too sweet, really moist and gingery. I made a confectioners sugar, butter and stout glaze which provided a little extra sweetness. I would make this again even if it isn't St. Patrick's Day.

Made as is. Didn't experience any of the problems listed. I even open the oven door with NO dire results :-) I did make ginger frosting to go with it. Very yummy: cream cheese; unsalted butter; moscovado sugar; powdered ginger, cloves & cinnamon; vanilla and crystallized ginger.

For those who are still struggling with this recipe, the correct pan size is 9x13, with about a 40-45min bake time. The flavour of this cake is excellent - I typically find recipes too sweet, and I automatically reduce the amount of sugar called for, but this recipe needs the full measure of molasses and sugar to balance the stout. Also, because the batter is thin, pieces (of crystallized ginger, in my case) will sink to the bottom. Not the worst thing, just something to keep in mind.

Again, I should have read the reviews for this one. I made it once with no problems. I made it a second time today and doubled it, and attempted to make some in mini loaves. Typically, the ratio is 1 big loaf for 3 mini loaves. This is sooo not the case for this recipe. I have an entire loaf on the jellyroll pan that supported the miniloaves from the spill over. Additionally, the big loaf this time jumped shipped. I don't know what I did differently from the last time, but just a word of warning. It tastes delicious, I just wish more of it ended up in the pan. Btw, the advice to not open the oven or it will fall is quite on the money; I couldn't avoid it this time, but the loaf is sad and sunkin...

I made sure I made this in two loaf pans and I still had some batter leap to it's death. Next time I think I would try a bundt pan. The cake itself is very light and fluffy and extremely tasty, especially with the suggested glaze of beer/confectioners sugar/butter that someone else tried. I did not open the over door and still, both cakes sunk in the middle pretty severely. So overall, they look like hell but they taste great. Worth a try

The comment that 'since the cake is made with oil, it'll last a few days....' no, no, no- it's too darned good to last that long. I made it last night and brought it to work and by the end of the day, the last square inch was offered and happily accepted by one of the receptionists. Everybody seemed to like it, a lot. *Note, the only change made was using safflower oil to grease the nonstick pan along with the parchment paper so that the one co-worker who doesn't like butter could also enjoy the cake immensely. The other frequent comment was that the color of the cake was beautiful.

Magnificent. Simple. Make exactly as prescribed. Moist texture. Deep flavors. Doesn't need a thing added to it. Hard to find a dessert with more bang for the buck relative to the time it takes to make. Great ending to meals with strong flavors.

I rarely comment on recipes, but I just want to say that this is better than the Cooks Illustrated version, and usually you can trust those. Theirs is good, but you seriously will be licking the batter out of the pan here.

Very easy to make... in two laof pans. I can't imagine the disaster had I used only one pan. The cake/bread was very moist even after several days. I heavily dusted with powdered sugar because I felt it was really in need of a sweet component. Next time I will use a lemon glaze. Everyone at work loved it for St. Patrick's Day.

This was really great! So flavorful, moist and it smells wonderful. I didn't have problems with the guinness/molasses boiling over but I do think the batter would have overflowed from just one pan (like other reviewers mentioned). I used an 8.5 in. loaf pan and an 8 in. square baking pan and this was perfect for the amount of batter. The 8 in. square was done in about 30 minutes and the loaf in about 40 minutes. This is a winner! (especially since you get to finish the guinness while it's baking :) )

Very Good! Only thing I added was some grated orange peel and I did use the suggestion for the glaze with irish whiskey. Cake is moist and full flavored.

I love this cake! Stays fresh for at least a week, IF it lasts that long. I make 1 1/2 times the recipe for a 9" x 13" pan and it's perfect for a good sized group. Didn't have cardamom on hand so I substituted allspice. Iced it with a light cream cheese frosting which complemented the spice flavoring.

This is remarkable. Rich, moist, almost like chocolate! Just be sure you use Guinness and not another stout. It wasn't nearly as good with a different stout.

Rating: 4
Love it. Easy, quick, and delicious. Used only 1/4 cup white sugar, no cardamom (didn't have any), double the cinnamon, and 2 tsp of baking powder and a full tbsp of baking soda because I was using flat beer. Turned out perfect, except the stupid silicone bundt I used wouldn't release the cake, so I got two halves instead.

This is really really good. I love ginger, but not always gingerbread (it can be so dry!) and this was a hugely delightful surprise. I made 1 1/2 recipes and used two 9x5 pans and each loaf was perfect in one hour of baking. I lightly coated the baked loaves with a glaze of 2 T melted butter, 2 C powdered sugar, and 2 T stout. It hardens to lovely crackly sweet crust and looks bakery-perfect!

Love ginger - Nice cake. Love Guinness - nearly drank it, but cake it was... Took the advice of other reviewers and used two loaf pans. No problems. Perfect. Glazed one cake and decorated with candied glace pear. Froze second. Defrosted, smeared with mild lemon cream cheese icing and rolled in crushed nuts (almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts) and a little demerera sugar. Delicious. Not a crumb left of either cake. On both occasions friends asked where I got such a lovely cake (!)

I first made this cake several years ago and had the same problems others mentioned. I used a loaf pan, the batter overflowed onto the oven floor and it was an overall disaster. For some insane reason I decided to try it again, and after perusing the reviews, decided to use a much larger pan. I used a full-size bundt pan, and this time, I had no problems with overflow. I adjusted the baking time to 55 minutes instead of 1 hour to compensate, but that may have still been a bit too long. However, the cake was still very moist. All in all, it worked out much better this time! I glazed it with the lemon glaze from another stout cake recipe on this site, and that seemed to complement it really well.

If you like dark, spicy, moist but light ginger bread, this is it! I made the recipe as is (with dark molasses), and baked it in one 9x5 and 2 3x5 loaf pans. They turned out beautifully! The small ones were done in about 25 minutes and the large one in about 35.

I modified this recipe to solve the following problems: stove boil over, oven spill over, and sticking to the pan. I reduced the quantity of molasses and guiness by 1/4 cup each, reduced the oil to 2/3 cup, and reduced the baking soda and baking powder to 1 tsp each. I poured the batter into a 9x5 silicone loaf pan (no greasing needed) until it was slightly more than half full, then poured the remainder into a well-greased mini loaf pan. I baked the 9x5 silicone pan for exactly 45 minutes and the mini loaf pan for 28 minutes. Both loaves were perfect. Reducing the liquid to solid ratio prevents the sugars from sinking to the bottom of the pan and burning; reducing the leavening agents prevents the bread from rising too high too quickly, and the extra pan is necessary because this recipe makes too much batter for one pan. This is an outstanding gingerbread if you make these changes. It's not too sweet, very moist, and perfectly spiced.

This is my second time making this cake. The first time I followed the recipie to the letter. It turned out pretty well. This time I changed it a bit. For a lighter, fluffier cake here's what I did: 3/4c molasses and 1&1/4 c Guinness Stout I also added 1/6 c more flour, and 1 tsp of salt. Its light and yummy! Not greasy at all. The top also gets a tasy crust on it. I also baked the cake as cupcakes this time for only 1/2 an hour. Still, don't fill the pan too much! Now I'm going to make a glaze with icing sugar and irish whisky!

What a dense cake! The batter was definitely more than enough for a 9x5 pan, so be careful. And don't skimp on the ginger and cardamom. For presentation purposes, I sprinkled it with confectioner's suger.

I haven't actually tasted this cake. Why? Because I have been too busy scraping the burning batter off of the bottom of my oven, opening windows (even though it's only about 40-degrees outside) and turning on fans all over the house. I made this recipe EXACTLY as written, including using the recommended sized pan. How ironic that the instructions tell you not to open the oven door until the very end of the baking period because the cake will fall. In the case of this recipe, that would be a GOOD thing. In any event, you really must open the oven door anyway in order to scrape the smoldering batter from the racks and floor of the oven or you will set off every fire alarm in a 10-block radius. What is wrong with these celebrated and greatly lauded chefs that they can't be bothered to do their homework when adapting recipes for the home cook? If you can't get it right -- don't publish!

I discovered this cake in January when I was looking for a good dessert that didn't require any dairy. It's now a favorite cold-weather dessert. I modified it by using 1/2 c oil and 1/4 c applesauce. I also use a bit more ginger and use 1/2 c wheat flour with 1-1/2 c all-purpose flour. This time I'm going to try topping it with the fall fruit compote (Gourmet 11/99) I found on this site.

This is the best gingerbread cake I've ever had. It's dark, moist, exceptionally spicy and even better the next day. I made it in a bundt pan and it fit perfectly.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Although I have to agree, the cake did stick in the bundt pan - perhaps I'll try confectioner's sugar as recommended in another review. I am glad I used my large 10-15 cup bundt and not the loaf pan as the recipe recommended or I would have had quite the mess in my oven. Like another reviewer mentioned, be wary of the pot on the stove! I almost had to scrub candied beer off my ceramic stove top... I caught it just before it boiled over. I've made a few ginger cakes and this one wins hands down. DH loved it "Cake made with Guiness what's not to like?" and it was a hit with company as well so much so that as it was baking the party stayed firmly entrenched in the kitchen even though there were fireworks outside.

Still loving this recipe 6 years later, but want to mix it up a little. Can anyone recommend a topping or great flavored whipped cream to go with it?

How annoyed am I. The cake is excellent . . . great flavor and I will definitely make it again. But I knew that when I put it into my 9x5 loaf pan it was going to overflow. I should have left some out. Sure enough, it was overflowing quite a bit. Lucky I guessed right and placed the loaf pan atop a cookie sheet in the oven. But you'd think they would have figured out this issue with the recipe before publishing it. Be careful!

Rating: 0
Am I missing something from the most recent recipe variation? The cake turned out far too moist and left an oily feeling in the mouth, despite extra time in the oven. And it wasn't very spicy, despite fresh spices, potent ginger etc. The batter was extremely liquidy and while baking it overflowed the loaf pan... quite a letdown.

Rating: 3
This cake was great! I made it for a potluck and got good reviews. I did what one other reviewer mentioned and made 1.5 times the recipe. I made a 10 cup bundt cake for the party and then a very small cake with the leftover batter for me and my boyfriend to try. It was especially yummy warm out of the oven.

I would also caution people to compare this recipe and comments to those of the Epicurious recipe called "Guinness Stout Ginger Cake", which is the same recipe from the same restaurant but with a few key differences. I followed the directions for the other recipe, which has half the sugar, and loved it. I used a 10-cup bundt pan and made 1 1/2 times the quantity specified...it rose above the top but did not spill, and I was able to cut the top (bottom of cake)off clean without losing any design. I used all powdered spices and light brown sugar, which is what I had available, and no fresh ginger. I used the Pam spray that said "for baking...with flour", as it had a picture of a bundt cake on it. I soaked the pan with this Pam, and it popped out with not a crumb left behind when I reversed the pan immediately after cutting the bottom flat. It also had a nice, crusty brown surface without any white marks people seem to have when they actually flour the pan. It baked in 50 minutes, but my oven runs hot. I would reiterate what others have said about using a large pot for the stout and molasses...as soon as you put the baking soda in, it foams up to at least three times the height of the liquid. The other recipe calls for 1/2 TABLESPOON instead of 1/2 TEASPOON baking soda that this one specifies in the beer/molasses combination, I might try this one next time with half the sugar. Nonetheless a dark, spicy, rich recipe that I would make again. I don't feel it needs any icing, I served with whipped cream and felt it was a perfect complement.

Made this for our "Mystery Ingredient" Dinner, stout being the mystery ingredient. Very moist and flavorful. I prepared it in a standard bundt pan. If I make this again, I will make it in a different type of pan as this tended to stick.

I was looking for a light but moist gingerbread with a lot of flavor and not too much sugar. This is one PERFECT - very moist, sweet but not cloyingly so, dark and spicy. I made 1.5 times the batter, as one reviewer suggested, which gave me one 10-cup bundt cake and a 8x5 loaf. I also used Guinness Extra Stout, and didn't add the fresh grated ginger, but I think it would have made the cake even yummier. I also used half molasses and half Golden Syrup 'cause I bought blackstrap molasses, which are too bitter and not sweet enough. A couple suggestions, though: I used superfine sugar, which resulted in a very even crumb and absolutely no sticking problems. I think that with such a liquid batter, regular granulated sugar tends to sink and caramelize at the bottom of the pans, a problem I've experienced with other liquid batters. You can always whiz your granulated sugar in a spice grinder to get the same effect. Also, keep an eye on the beer/molasses when it's on the stove, and DO use a large POT for it! I used a not-so-large pot and looked away for five seconds, then spent half an hour scrubbing candied beer off my stovetop and starting all over again. But the results were WELL worth the trouble.

This fabulous gingerbread will become a St. Patrick's Day tradition! I made this for an appetizer party before our traditional St. Patrick's Day pub crawl, and it was very well received. Made this recipe exactly as-is, and baked in a 12-cup Bundt pan, per other reviewers' recommendations. It didn't want to come out of the pan (which was obviously not prepared well enough). The next time, I may try making it in two loaf pans (parchment lined this time!), or possibly a 9x13. Don't make this if you don't like ginger!

I've made this cake a few times, it is part of my permanent collection. Definitely better the next day. IMPORTANT: The amount of batter this recipe makes WILL NOT all fit into a small (6 cup) bundt pan. Even not using all the batter in the small pan, it does indeed overflow and end up on the bottom of the oven. Two loaf pans or a regular 10"/12 cup bundt pan is better -- 1-1/2 times ingredients of this recipe for the 10" pan if you want a tall cake. Keep the cake from sticking in the pan by brushing the pan with a paste of equal amounts cocoa powder and melted butter, or flour and melted butter. This cake has a very strong/complex flavor. As somebody else said -- not for wimps.

Great flavor, but moist to the point of just plain oily. It got eaten without complaint, however.

This is delicious. HOWEVER, make it in TWO loaf pans, not one as the recipe suggests. More than half of it ended up on the oven floor. The finished loaf would not come out of the pan in the conventional sense, so I tore it outwith my hands. It looked bad, tasted delicious.

DANGER WILL ROBINSON!! DANGER! In researching a repeat baking of this superb cake for my birthday/Christmas Eve dinner, there are notable differences between this recipe and the Gramercy Tavern gingerbread of Feb. 2000. This recipe omitted 1&1/2 teaspoons baking powder with the flour (oops!) and this recipe cuts the sugars to 1/2 cup each (a good change) so beware but make this cake!

Wonderful recipe! The unique name caught my eye. I'm a big fan of Young's Double Chocolate Stout so I tried that instead of the Guiness. Great flavor. If you don't have cardamom (or can't find it in the local grocery) don't worry, not necessary.

Have other cooks noticed that this is nearly identical to the Gramercy Tavern Gingerbread on this site, except that this version has only HALF as much sugar? Both are from the same person. Any comments? In any case, this is delicious, but then I don't think there's such a thing as bad gingerbread. Get the pint bottle of stout so you can drink the other half of it while you cook.

I decided to make this dessert to go with our St. Patrick's Day Dinner. I was asked to buy the draught, not stout and used that. I thought this recipe was wonderful and so did the guests, it was fabulous with fresh whipped cream and coffee. One guest did not enjoy it much (I don't always agree with her anyway). Great recipe to add to your collection.

Decided to try this cake after a visitor left almost a half gallon(!) jug of excellent microbrew stout. Love the deep rich spiciness and moistness! Warning for other baking neophytes...a non-stick pan w/butter still sticks!! Didn't hurt the flavor a bit tho!

Made this as finale to St Patrick's Day meal, and it was a great success - and I rarely eat cake, let alone bake one. But this has a charmingly old-fashioned spicy taste and satisfying texture, and not too sweet, either. Followed recipe exactly, using Bundt pan and served with whipped cream. Leftovers are perfect about 4 pm with tea. Try it!

I modified it slightly by cutting the fresh ginger in half and uping the spices, but its a wonderful all purpose cake. Baked in a rectangular pan, it makes a great snack cake; baked in rounds and iced with a light honey cream cheese frosting its raised to new heights. I recommend trying it if you like a good, dark, spicy gingerbread.

This was a very disappointing recipe--I'd expected more with all of the great reviews, but it was a very mild cake that was almost unidentifiable as gingerbread. Definitely needed more spice--a great deal more ginger, perhaps more freshly grated ginger root. The molasses-stout mixture smelled and tasted wonderful before it went into the batter, but was somewhat lost in the finished product. Won't make this one again.

Very interesting. I ended up using Murphy's Stout (because we like it better than Guinness). The cake was very dense, and very spicy. I think I'd make it again on request, but it's not my favorite ginger cake recipe-- that one is the Triple Ginger Cake from Yankee Magazine from a few years back.
