I took it out after 4 hours from the freezer and swirl 4tbsp of chunky peanut butter in place of the unsalted peanuts then freeze overnight. I let it sit on the counter for 5 minutes before serving. I made it in a 9"springfoam pan with a digestive crust. Put some whipped cream on each slices, drizzle with chocolate sauce, sprnkled with chopped peanuts. Nice presentation and yummy.

I used salted peanuts (didn't have unsalted) and omitted the salt in the recipe. Also, I didn't temper the eggs (I never do although I should know better). That takes the prep time down to about 10 minutes. Delicious with chocolate syrup or hot fudge.

I found this to be extremely bland - not really worth the effort to make. It really needed something to jazz it up. Maybe the caramel sauce mentioned by the reviewer below would have helped.

Great do-ahead dessert! My husband's favorite fruit is the banana, so I'm always on the lookout for ways to prepare it (not easy). This recipe also includes another of his favorite foods - the peanut. Served with a warm caramel sauce, it's consistently get's rave reviews at dinner parties.
