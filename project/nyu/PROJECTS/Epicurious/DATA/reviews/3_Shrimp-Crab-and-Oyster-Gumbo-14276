Absolutely a huge disappointment--what a waste of good shellfish. I love to cook, and rarely mis-judge a recipe. If the recipe looks blah to you, it is! But if bland is what you're looking for, maybe this just wasn't the right recipe choice for me.

This dish was OK, but with just a few additions it becomes outstanding. Try adding gumbo file' during mid cooking and at serving. It'll lend real CREOLE (not cajun) flavor. Gumbo is an African word meaning okra. Gumbo is not a Cajun dish, and neither is the rice cooking method given with this recipe.

Now THIS is a recipe for gumbo, not like the others that I've seen posted. A 45 minute roux, now you're talking. None of that 3 minute or 8 minute crap, that's just burnt flour. And a real stock, not a can of broth. So refreshing!

I have to agree with the crabby person in Boston...because, I rely quite a bit on the reviews, as to determine whether or not I will make the recipe. It is so annoying when cooks do not make the dish, and then give it a rating....ggggrrr!

Good for you, Pamela! This is a site for people who enjoy food: to experiment, and even speculate. There's room for everyone's voice in the choir, so relax, crabby, or you may end up in somebody's Jambalaya!

For the cranky person who did not like people posting without trying. Please try to be nicer. If the owner of the webpage wanted to take the time to notify these people I am sure they will. Try and learn to just ignore those who needed to comment...that is what makes this such a great country....FREEDOM!

To you folks that said you'll definitely try the recipe, and have given it a number of forks.... Do you understand that the forks are used to rate the recipe AFTER you've made it? You can't rate it if you haven't made it - the forks aren't to rate how good the recipe sounds. By rating it before trying it, you skew the results. Please contribute your rating, but not until you've made it. I know it's fun to see your posting on-line, but can you please do it the way you're supposed to? Yes, I'm a little cranky today, after reading all the bogus ratings here....

I made this gumbo (with a few alterations) for a superbowl party and got RAVE reviews from everyone. I substituted frozen crawfish for the crab legs, tossing the heads into the stock pot with the shrimp shells, clam juice, boullion cube water, peppercorns and bay leaves - simmered one hour and strained. Made the roux in skillet with vegetable oil until dark brown. In stock pot, sauted sausage and removed, then sauted onion, celery, green pepper, garlic and okra. Add seasonings (lots), sliced sausage, broth, and roux by the spoonfuls - simmer. Finally, included the shrimp, crawfish tails, and a pound of crab meat. Wow.

I have made this several times, and it is an easy and satisfying meal. It is worth the trouble to make the Cajun Rice as an accompaniment. I often add several tablespoons of cajun seasoning to the broth to spice it up. There is enough broth to add additional seafood if you like.

There are no doubts I will make this gumbo. I will make it for CHRISTMAS since I will have a large amount of people here. GAIL from HESSMER,LA.
