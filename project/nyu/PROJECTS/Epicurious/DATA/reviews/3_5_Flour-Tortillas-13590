I usually make tortillas with mix that requires you to only add water, but I ran out and used this recipe with organic flour. I substituted the shortening (authentic tortillas use Mexican lard) with olive oil and per suggestion, added a teaspoon of baking powder. I didn't bother letting the mix get cold before adding the warm water, but after rolling them into balls I let them warm and rise a little in covered bowl near a hot oven. I used a tortilla flattener and voila! --great homemade tortillas. Served with flank fajitas and fresh tomatillo salsa. Nice.

LOVE this recipe... i took the note and added 1tsp baking powder, and i also used canola oil instead of shortening (b/c i didn't have it, LOL), so what i did to make up for that was chill the flour/oil/baking powder mixture for 20-30 min. that seemed to make up for the cutting-in-the- fat flakiness. i am totally making these again today... OH, one more thing: i tried the larger, 10" tortillas, and must agree w/ those who said it's easier to make the smaller, 7" tortillas.

These were pretty good. I also added 1 tsp baking soda. My kids had a great time rolling the dough and helping.

I really liked this recipe... I had a request from a friend to try and make them... He said these turned out as good as his mom's (who lives in southern Texas). I did try some with the vegetable shortening and some with butter... The shortening ones were much better. I did add half a tsp of baking powder and an extra half tsp. of salt. Highly recommend!

After researching various tortilla recipes, I decided on this one based its many good reviews. They felt wonderful when they were rolled out -- moist and thin -- but when they cooked they totally flaked apart and were impossible to roll! So disappointing! They tasted more like very thin bread then tortillas.

Easy and fun. The results are so much more tender than store-bought! I use this now instead of purchashing tortillas.

I just made this, but with some changes that turned out really well. I used self-rising flour, 4 tablespoons of olive oil and 10 tablespoons of water - just enough water to form a loose dough. I combined by hand, kneeded for a minute, formed balls, let rest and rolled out very thin. What resulted were flaky and soft tortillas that held together nicely. Next time I'll try corn oil, but olive oil was nice if the strong flavor doesn't put you off.

I don't use shortening (too unhealthy) so instead sub 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup canola oil, turn out great for me, although I can see where some would prefer the extra softness you'd get from shortening. To get more or less perfect circle shapes, press an upside-down plate over the dough you've just rolled out and trim or just pull away the excess dough from the plate covering your tortilla. At first I was using a large plate to get bigger tortillas but then discovered a couple benefits from making smaller, 7-inch diameter tortillas: 1. less chance of messing them up when transferring to the grill and 2. I can freeze unused small ones in a plastic bag and then later for a snack pop them into my toaster as easily as a slice of bread--they come out crisp and hot and I can break them into chips for dipping in guacamole or salsa--a cheap and healthy alternative to store-bought salty fried tortilla chips!

These are great! I used butter instead of shortning and added a tsp. of baking powder as suggested and they turned out lovely. We used half a batch for fish tacos at lunch and froze the rest, only to take them out again for dinner, (pulled pork tacos made from a leftover pork roast). Yumm!

I give this four forks because of its potential to be amazing. I added more butter, added baking powder (as suggested below), rolled out fewer, and cooked them on lower heat for a bit longer. Chewy. But that's the way I like 'em. This is a very money-saving recipe!

This is a very easy recipe and the tortillas turned out really well. I divided the dough into 12 equal pieces and let them sit in a covered bowl for 30 minutes. The dough was very pliable and easy to roll out. I too used a fork to prick the tortillas as they cooked and I also added a little more salt. Very tasty burritos!

Very easy to make and tastie also. Definitely something I would make over and over. I put a tespoon of baking powder in the recipe makes them very soft. thank you for you hepl.

I make these at least once every two weeks. I have always substituted butter for the shortening, though I suppose lard would be a more authentic substitution. I also use 2 teaspoons of salt instead of one. My husband just prefers a saltier tortilla. I now scoff at the store bought varieties.

good tortillas, easy and definitely better than store-bought, unless you live in texas of course and can get fresh ones. i too substituted butter for about 1/2 of the shortening. Definitely recommend trying these!

I'm never buying tortillas again. These are so easy, they take less time to make than it would take me to get to the grocery store and back. I used butter instead of shortening and it works fine, plus I like the flavor better. A little bit more water and butter makes them decadent and easier to roll out, and they brown a little bit nicer with the touch of extra butter.

I've never really liked the flour tortillas you buy in the supermarket because they taste chemically to me and now there's no reason to buy them anymore. These are super easy to make and taste so much better. I have kept the dough overnight in the fridge and they turned out just fine so you can make the dough ahead if you like.

These tortillas were quick, easy, and inexpensive. I used butter instead of the vegetable shortening, and it worked perfectly. I found that pricking the tortillas with a fork prior to frying kept them from puffing up too much.

Outstanding! Great for the cook who wants to try something a little different. Next time, I will increase the recipe 1-1/2 times. The extra will give me just a little bit more to "tuck" under.

I liked this recipe alot, but found the tortillas rolled thinner if only allowed to sit for 15 minutes. I also let them sit for a few minutes after being rolled out, which prevented them from shrinking back a little.
