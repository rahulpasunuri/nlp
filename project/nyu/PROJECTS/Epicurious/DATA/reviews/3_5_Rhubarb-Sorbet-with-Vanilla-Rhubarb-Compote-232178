This was incredibly delicious! I made the sorbet according to the recipe, but I did add 2 drops of red food coloring. I took another reviewer's suggestion and substituted vanilla bean for vanilla flavoring. This is the first time I've ever made sorbet and it was wonderful!!

This isn't a review but a question: What if you just make the compote? Will that taste good? Or does it need the sorbet? Thanks!

Too sweet, gummy consistency. Compote kind of pointless. After reading reviews, I too wonder if I may have cooked the rhubarb too long (evaporation=gummy consistency?). Also wonder if brand of ice cream maker makes a difference....

Was underwhelmed with this recipe despite my huge love for rhubarb. Obsessed with the idea of a rhubarb sorbet, I tried the other recipe on this site and was much happier with the outcome. The pectin in the rhubarb makes both sorbet recipes creamy in consistency (aided by corn syrup in both). However, this recipe came out too thick - like putty. The addition of water in the other recipe makes it light, while not losing the creamy smooth taste.

I've made this sorbet twice and love it. It was better the second time - I think the rhubarb was just better. The compote was not needed.

This was very simple and had good flavor. I didn't serve it with the compote and I don't think that it needed it. Next time I'll try serving it with fresh strawberries.

To those who are not making the compote, you are missing the part of this dessert that takes it over the top. I used a few drops of food coloring in the sorbet and saved the reddest part of the rhubarb for the compote with seeds from 1/3 of a vanilla bean instead of the vanilla extract. The slices in the compote have an amazing taste/texture. Everyone loved it.

I'd give it 4 Forks but I didn't make the compote! Who needs it when the sorbet is so lovely on it's own! I was worried about it being a creepy greenish color but it actually turned out to be a lovely pale pink and had a wonderful texture to it!I'm so thankful to find another rhubarb recipe. There's SO much of it in the garden!

I didn't have enough rhubarb to make the compote, however the sorbet turned out wonderfully. Surprisingly, it is very CREAMY in consistency. And several days later, it has not become grainy or crystalline in the freezer. I will make this again. I served it with sliced strawberries and dairy free hot fudge (Dove brand, jarred). Scrumptious vegan dessert, and a great way to use fabulous fruit in-season.

Awesome, though I did adjust the proportions and ingredients a bit to make it vegan. I used: 1 1/2 cups organic (non-bone-char) sugar, and 1 Tbsp brown rice syrup. I also added 1 Tbsp Grand Marnier as citrus helps bring out the depth of rhubarb. The second time I made the compote, I used 1 tsp high-quality Turkish rose water in place of the vanilla -- also brought out nuances in the rhubarb and married perfectly with the hints of orange from the Grand Marnier. Yay for Spring!

I made this at the end on rhubarb season and now I can't wait until next spring!(I never thought I'd say that coming from New England!) It even kept well in the freezer.

Have already made this twice. Based on previous reviews, used the redder end for the sorbet and greener end for compote. Also based on reviews, used more rhubarb than recommended, so as to make less sweet. I think the second time, I used far too much rhubarb, and wasn't sweet enuf! Anyway, very nice way to use up the garden abundance. I always freeze in my freezer overnight, as never comes out firm enuf from ice cream maker. Found that the addition of corn syrup seemed to give a creamer consistency than my usual sorbets, and so will add some now to other recipes.

PHENOMENAL! For Rhubarb lovers, of course. The sorbet stands quite well on it's own, the compote adds a thrill. I thought the vanilla was a bit overpowering but I use the mexican variety. The color was wonderful, rich. Prep took both time and attention but according to my guests, this dessert truly rewarded the effort.

I just finished making the sorbet and it is fantastic -- the flavor is very pronounced and the color, gorgeous! I used a tad more rhubarb (1 stalk more) as I didn't have enough for the compote and kept the sugar the same which made it really tart. As to the user who commented on the color -- most of that color comes out in the maceration and the steeping phase, so if it isn't pink enough give it more time to ooze. Planning on serving with fresh strawberries and raspberries... if I can wait until tonight!

Each spring I make a rhubarb dish for my husband -- he likes his straight -- without strawberries. We both loved this recipe. Unlike someother reviewers we found both the sorbet and the suace to be not too sweet -- just right. Also, I did have to put the finished sorbet in the freezer for a few hours after it came out of the ice cream maker, but that is to be expected of sorbet.

I found this to be an excellent sorbet. Several comments: 1.) Despite using the red ends of the rhubarb, I was not able to produce the brilliant color depicted in the magazine. I may try a touch of food coloring next time. 2.) The compote is excellent, although the sorbet will stand alone if desired. 3.) In reponse to the previous reviewer, there are other rhubarb sorbet recipes calling for water (several on this website), but I found I preferred this method. The rhubarb contains enough moisture to produce a creamy sorbet, although I might agree that this was a tad on the sweet side. Enjoy

Sadly, this did not work for me at all. Is there something missing from the recipe? Water? Perhaps I cooked it too long... My puree turned out rather sticky instead of creamy and would not firm up in the ice cream maker. I salvaged it by incorporating 2 cups of crushed ice. Result not bad but much too sweet. The vanilla rhubarb sauce turned out well.

Yummy with great smooth texture - very ice cream-like. Not too tart or sweet either. Rather than chilling in water bath, I just put the puree in the fridge and processed it in ice-cream maker the next day. Served with strawberries and mango instead of compote.
