This is an excellent way to jazz up simple white rice. It takes no special culinary skill and is a nice change from the ordinary.

Ick! I have no idea why the other cooks liked this recipe. It was gross--the flavors did not work together and the mint turned black, making the whole thing look awful. Never again.

Very very good - I made this as an accompaniment to broiledlamb chops, and the mint complemented the lamb perfectly. One thing I think I did wrong - I used basmati rice and although I followed the recipe exactly, it came out kind of sticky and clumped together (though it still tasted good!). That's the only reason I give it 2 forks - anyone know why the rice didn't come out fluffy?

An very refreshing, tasty recipe that is also healthy. Very little fat, and with the addition of the recommended oil in the cooking water, its even healthier than the traditional rice with butter. I served it to company that included a couple who strictly watch their fats, and found even those unconcerned with fats asking for the recipe.

Very good side dish with fish. Good looking and a fine aroma.
