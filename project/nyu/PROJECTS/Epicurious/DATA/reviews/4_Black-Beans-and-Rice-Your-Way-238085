Unfortunately I didn't have all the accompaniments (avocado, salsa) and I substituted sunflower seeds for pumpkin seeds. Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe. I served tomatos alongside. It was tasty, but I can't say exceptional. It was incredibly simple to make and I appreciate the high iron content of the beans and seeds (even though sweet potato does inhibit absorption) which I need, so I'll probably be making it again during school-nights, making the beans in advance on the weekend. On this occasion we had been out all day and were hungry so I really appreciated this as a quick recipe (my husband is not a fan of beans so he didn't have any, but he did love the sweet potato).

We didn't have dried black beans but I cooked everything else according to the recipe. It was a hit and I'm pretty certain this is going to become a new week night favorite. What a great combo!

Delicious and unusual mix of flavors. Roasted sweet potatoes are excellent (I used cajun spices to add some kick and roasted at 400 degrees). Avocados and pepitas add smooth texture and crunch. Rice is optional in my book.

This meal is so easy, yet extremely tasty and filling. I used canned black beans rather than those in the recipe. I used tomatillo salsa, avocado, and Fage nonfat yogurt (rather than sour cream--tastes the same to me!). Love the fresh lime squeeze over the top!

I love this recipe, though it took a few times to get it right. When I followed the instructions exactly the first time around, the beans ended up overcooked and mushy, which was a disappointment. Since then, I've just watched the beans closely and gone with my instincts and the result has been much better. I also add in a fair amount of extra soy sauce and balsamic vinegar to punch up the flavor. The caramelized sweet-potato cubes and salty/crunchy pumpkin seeds are such a great addition - they elevate the beans into the kind of dish you could easily serve for company. I served them alongside the chile-crusted tuna tacos on this site, and got raves all around.

What a delicious treat! As others suggested I changed orange juice for lemon juice, increased the chilli powder slightly, used rice wine vinegar and used green onions instead of red. I also added some medium-firm tofu when the rice was still hot. I have the feeling this will become a favourite dish in our house!

I really enjoyed the meal. I took the advice of others on the beans and cut the water down to 6 cups and that was good. I cooked them the day before and then refrigerated them. The next day they still had plenty of liquid. I added 1 Tablespoon each of the soy and balsamic but think a little more would have been good. I also took the advice of others and added some cumin, chili powder and garlic salt to the sweet potatoes and turned the oven down to 425. They were very good. I alsomade some jerk chicken which provided a great flavor with the beans and rice. Good recipe!

This was a great dish! I made it last minute, so I used canned black beans (organic, no salt). I sauteed some onion and fresh, sweet red pepper and then added the beans as well as about a 1/4 TBSP of cumin. The soy and vinegar were great additions. I garnished with sliced scallion and avocado with lime and cilantroit was delicious and satisfying, and I will definitely make this again!

Good combo of flavors. Agree with others that the black beans are liquidy. I cut down by 1 cup and they were still swimming.

This recipe was great. The additions, including avocado, cilantro, and raw onion were a must. Of course I also used some hot sauce, Cholula to be exact. My only gripe is that 450 F is too high for the sweet potatoes, in my opinion. I think you're better off at 400 F to avoid burning them. Mine were badly burnt-looking at 450 F for 40 minutes, but it may depend in part on the pan you use (They tasted fine, but looked a little burnt). I should have known better, because I routinely make sweet potato oven fries at 400 F.

I am reluctant vegetarian cook. My wife will not consume red meat....but I was raised in my Father's fancy retail meat market in Seattle and after most vegetarian meals I am psychologically still hungry. THIS RECIPE WAS AN EXCEPTION. FULLY SATISFYING. I used the suggestion to dust the sweet potatos with Cumin....one of my favorite spices and second only to black pepper in spice sales worldwide. My wife prefers Brown Rice but it never cooked up satisfactorily for us until I discovered "Yoga Organic Long Grain Brown Rice" at Walmart, of all places. This organic brown rice still takes 40-60 minutes in my rice cooker but finishes similar to white rice; not gummy and heavy like every other brand of brown rice I have tried. Also, I used pre-roasted and salted Pepitas, which we keep handy for snacks, which I toasted for just a couple minutes in a biscuit pan co- habiting the oven with the sweet potatos. I had 'em; so I used 'em. This menu has a great combination of flavors. JBS

This was amazing. I mixed the cilantro with the avocado and lime juice; I hate raw onion so left those out. Otherwise I left this as is. I would eat the sweet potatoes or the pepitas by themselves they were so good. But united...this was GREAT. Enjoy.

This was delicious. There is a fair amount of active cooking time because of the variety of ingredients, so plan accordingly. The beans can be watery, so next time I'm reducing the liquids. Eliminating any of the components of this dish make it uninteresting, but the full combination: magnificent!

I prepared this exactly as written. As a main vegetarian course it was extremely uninteresting. I would recommend doing something, anything, to jazz it up, as suggested by the other reviewers.

Loved this, the combiation was awesome, toasted pepitos rock! Served it as a side to a spice rubbed roasted chicken. I did not have time to start with dry beans so I used two cans of black beans, rinsed and simmered with the other ingredients. They were great. I also tossed cinnamon, cumin and cayenne in with the potatoes. I will be adding this to my regular list.

I loved this recipe. The sweet potatoes were a welcome touch. I also served it with Mexican Sour Cream. It is an easy and delicious meatless meal!

Really nice and healthy. After a while the sherry taste got a little old/wierd though. Nice with lime crema (lime zest and juice with sour creme or creme fraiche). Also enjoyed the other toppings. In my opinion, the beans needed a little more heat and the sweet potatos benefitted from cumin, garlic powder, and chili powder before baking for some zing. Toasted the pumpkins seeds dry - oil seemed unneccessary - they are so yummy! Also, found it is nearly as good without the white rice (empty calories - but gotta love it!).

Delicious. This food writer really knows how to cook great vegetarian food!

This was so good. I always thought I didn't like sweet potatoes until I learned you can eat them cubed and roasted and not swimming under a layer of marshmallows. We ended up with a ton of leftovers. One night we transformed them into black bean and rice burritos which was just as good as served in a bowl with toppings. Very versatile and very delicious!

This was very good...I made the beans as indicated from scratch, but I would cut the water a bit next time. Used store-bought pepitas and certainly didn't need anywhere near a cup, and I made brown rice with chicken broth since I'm not a vegetarian. Served with chopped red onion, green salsa and a dollop of sour cream, which I recommend. I'm a big sweet potato fan anyway so I loved that addition!

A delicious change of pace from the standard bean seasonings. This will be a new staple.

Has all the makings of a great recipe -- hard to ruin, can drop or add an ingredient w/out fear of failure and is very healthful. I used canned beans,including their liquid (heresy, I know), and added frozen corn to the beans at the end for texture. Loved the roasted sweet potatoes; excellent addition, but far prefered brown rice, as it stood up better to the flavors and textures. Would make a great pot luck dish too.
