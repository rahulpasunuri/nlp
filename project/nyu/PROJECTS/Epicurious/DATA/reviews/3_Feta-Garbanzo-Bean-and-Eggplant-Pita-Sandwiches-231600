I tweak the basic recipe by adding some chopped drained tomatoes, decreasing the lemon juice by about half (because the tomatoes are a little acidic), and using 4 teaspoons ras al-hanout (Moroccan spice blend) instead of the cumin. The ras al-hanout really makes a huge difference. Excellent vegetarian entree, though I could also see adding some chicken or lamb, too.

We absolutely loved this recipe and what a great way to use garden eggplant! Little hesitant because of bland reviews, but cumin, mint and feta were wonderful -- nice generous dash of salt & pepper at same time as adding beans made it perfect. Best part was how quick and easy it was for after-work supper.

Good recipe, although i thought it needed more spice...added extra cumin, cayenne, and some chili powder. Used bell pepper since i had no eggplant, and ate it over rice. It was great!

This recipe was bland. I'm surprised at the reviews--some think it's delicious and some think it's bland. I'm on the latter camp. If I do make this again, I will add garlic.

Love this recipe, although I usually leave out the pita and just serve it as a side dish. I rarely make the same thing twice... even when I like the recipe, but in this case when I am trying to think of a tasty eggplant dish that is quick and easy, I've come back to this one time and again. I like it the next day too as leftovers, once the flavors have had more time to mix. For me its a keeper.

The variety of responses to this one is interesting. I figured that each ingredient would be critical so... I roasted my somewhat aged cumin before grinding and adding it and was generous with the lemon and cheese. I have never warmed to mint in savory foods so I added a generous helping of minced Italian parsley. I also used garlic infused olive oil. Excellent, easy and I get to use my overly generous garden bounty of eggplant!

I had to re-read the recipe to make sure I hadn't missed anything. This was very, very bland. The mint was fine, a nice touch. But all the other flavors were lost in the mushy eggplant/onion mixture. Would not make this again

This was absolutely delicious! So easy and flavorful. Will definitely put this into the weekday dinner rotation.

Nice, mediterranian-Middle eastern flavors, and easy to make and pretty healthy too (I used just 1 Tbl of garlic-flavored olive oil). The mint was quite suitable to these flavors and I don't know what all the fuss was about - try it before you decide you don't like it! Mint is the perfect complement to these flavors. Anyway, maybe next time I would add a little more feta, as I do like feta and found it not as dominant as I would have liked.

I've made this recipe several times, and it's one of my favorites. (It works particularly well for a crowd.) The flavors blend much better than I would have supposed upon first reading the recipe. I acually prefer to make this without the mint, and I find that it's more likely to appeal to everyone at the table that way.

Bland... I didnt' have the energy to perk it up- Wouldn't make again.

I'm giving this two forks for taste, because it was pretty good, but the mint was a bit odd. The third fork is for prep. This dish went literally from groceries in bag to people eating in thirty minutes flat. It was incredibly easy and quick to make, and though I didn't love it, my guests liked it a lot.

This is a great recipe- very easy to make, delicious, and healthy. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was superb (I have made it a few times now). I am not usually crazy about fresh mint, but I loved it in this.

A nice vegetarian change. I didn't have garbanzo beans, so I used vine ripe tomatoes for the moisture. Served for dinner with couscous, and a nonfat plain yogurt dipping sauce borrowed from another recipe (with non-fat mayo, basil, garlic, roasted red peppers and cumin) - let everybody assemble their own pita pockets, and the family was full and happy.

Very easy (30 minutes or less - and that included eating). I substituted chinese eggplants and I am also not a mint fan so I added a bit of dried marjoram instead. Next time, I will use fresh oregano to see how that works. Best part is it reheats really nice so its great to take to school for lunch the next day!

this recipe is awesome- it's a shame to substitute the mint because it adds to the middle eastern flare of the food. I made it and my friends loved it!

Great recipe, I used parsley and baby spinach, not the mint. Also added granulated garlic salt to liquid mix. Placed in baby pitas, makes a great appetizer.

Excellent & quick. Not a fan of mint, so replaced it with arugula.

I used black-eyed peas and spinach instead of chickpeas and mint, so I don't know if I'm qualified to comment, but it's what was on hand. Deeelicious! I'm going to pack a sandwich for my lunch right now...

Simple supper from the cupboard. (OK, we needed eggplant and mint. It was a quick stop.) Perfect. Fast, hot food. Perfect. Healthful (used 1T oil). Perfect. Enjoy ...
