I don't think of roast beef as "steak".

Did anyone ever actually use this recipe - either as is or with modifications? For anyone who did, what did you think of it?

To all of you who've actually wasted time debating this stupid topic, here is the encyclopedia's definition of a Philly cheesesteak. Let me summarize for you: There is no right answer. "Philadelphia cheese steak, aka Philly cheese steak or simply cheesesteak (so named due to its origin in Philadelphia) is a sandwich often meeting the following criteria: It is made with a submarine or Hoagie roll (an oblong, typically 6" or 12" piece of latitudinally-sliced French or Italian bread). It contains a thinly-sliced, grilled piece of steak; American, provolone, or Swiss cheese, or cheese spread such as Cheez Whiz; and possibly other ingredients including grilled onions, green peppers, mushrooms, and/or pizza sauce (a Pizza Steak). The inventor of the cheesesteak was Philadelphian Pat Olivieri who combined chopped-up steak with a little onion and put it in a bun. He began selling the new confections at his hot dog stand. They became so popular he opened up his own cheesesteak restaurant in 1930. Much debate can be had in Philadelphia over what makes a Philadelphia cheese steak unique. Some believe it is the roll while others believe how fine the meat is chopped. Still others believe it is the cooking method. Philly cheesesteaks can be found throughout the U.S. and Canada at various sandwich restaurants, some of which specialize in or serve only cheesesteaks. Pat's Steaks and Geno's Steaks, both in South Philadelphia on the same street, are widely considered the best places to get a cheesesteak anywhere, though many Philadelphians develop a loyalty to a local neighborhood steak shop."

First, this looks like a nice steak sandwich, not a Philly Cheesesteak, but it doesn't claim to be. Second, Tony Luke's has the best sandwiches in Philly. The Roasted Pork Italian with broccoli rabe, sharp provolone and roasted peppers is alone worth a trip to the city. Third, Pat's or Geno's Cheesesteaks are only edible at 3 in the morning after a night of liquor overindulgence. Otherwise, yuck.

What I made tonight were especially excellent sandwiches, even though they were definitely NOT PHILLY Cheesesteak Sandwiches. Used extra onion and regular cold meat type sliced fat-free smoked turkey breast instead of roast beef. Since the cold meat is quite salty, I only used about 1/2 the amount (by weight) that was required. Also subbed baguette bread for the Italian. Used provolone cheese, as cheddar just would not have been right. YUM, YUM, YUM.

Well - I'm from Iowa so I don't know a "real" cheesesteak from an imposter! I did like this for a quick and reasonably healthy dinner. Turkey worked well in place of beef and I think you can skimp a bit on the butter.

This was one of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time. The fact that it is not a greasy "Philly" steak makes it even better. I went a little light on the butter, and heated the roll before broiling. You can have your whiz or whatever other garbage you put on your sandiches up there in Philadelphia - I like this one!

I'm from Philadelphia and have never had a cheesesteak with cheese whiz! This is a yupped up cheesesteak, definitely not a Philadelphia cheese steak. I agree that if you're in town, Tony Lukes is the place to go. Stay away from Pat's and Geno's unless you enjoy the tourist traps. Eat it and enjoy it if you've never had a cheesesteak, but for the real thing come to Philadelphia!

The sandwich was ok. Ridiculous argument going on here, by the way. First, the recipe does not claim to be for a "Philadelphia" cheesesteak. Second, the "Philadelphia" sandwich was ostensibly created in the 1930s and Cheez Whiz was not invented until the 1950s. Some other cheese must have been "original." I would put my money on provolone, but why the heck not use whatever cheese you like?

I'd make it again, but it needs some heat like tabasco or horseradish. I'm originally from southern California and I love chilis and hot stuff in my food. Not worth eating if there's not some zip to it. I think the Philly people are funny. Who cares if the recipe is different from what they say makes a "Philly Cheesesteak sandwich"? You eat them the way you like them and I'll eat them the way I like them. Free country still right?

If Boston Baked beans had to be done one way and one way only? Why would we be here? Looks like an interesting recipe. (Beans for what it is worth have been Boston Baked before Boston was even on the map).

i don't blame philly natives for being so defensive of their sandwich. they're not food snobs. they just grew up with their sandwiches being prepared a certain way, and that's home to them. who wouldn't say that mom's home cooking is the best the way natives say that their city's way of preparing a cheesesteak is "it"? i'll tell ya, nowhere else have i found hot dogs or italian beef like in the city i grew up in, chicago!

As printed, I give a 2, as I changed to my personal likes, I give a 3. Dear "bilfoy", this recipe simply states cheeseteak sandwich, not Philly cheesesteak, so please get over the ownership of "your sandwich". There is no snob like a food snob. I don't care for mushrooms, and don't know why all the talk about cheese whiz, it's not even listed on the ingredients. I used provolone and shaved beef and paper thin onion slices (because I don't like the texture of onions, but I do like the flavor). I think many times experienced cooks use recipes as a guideline based on their own preferences. So unless your name is part of the recipe itself, don't be so sensitive and critically offended, and even then just get over it already.

I agree with the last reviewer from Philadelphia. I grew up in Bethlehem which is about an hour north of the city and Cheez Whiz was hardly ever used where we were. Personally, I think its gross but everyone still knows thats how they do in Philly. Along with all of the other cheeses listed. In the suburbs you don't really see it but it does exist!

Hey Mass. - just because you never had a cheesteak with Whiz doesn't mean it's not the way we do it down here. There are actually different options (provolone for one) - but whiz is the original. Thankfully, here in Philly we do provide for a range of cheese choices. I believe this discussion was about what is traditional, and cheese whiz IS. Even folks who prefer not to eat it are aware of that. As for your claim of "born and raised in Philly" - uh huh. Which suburb?

Yes, I would make it again BUT -- Philly Cheesesteaks are usually made with Provolone but you can used any sliced cheese, definitely NOT Cheez Wiz. Those who talk Cheez Wiz are somewhat brain dead -- I have NEVER had a Philly Cheese Steak made with that stuff. I wouldn't use it for any thing. I was born and raised in Philly even though I now live in Massachusetts. Cheese Steaks were a staple in our household.

To Vancouver -- I concur with South Philly - Geno's is awful, I'm not a fan of Pat's but it's ok. I would also add Jim's Steaks on 4th and South as my personal favorite. And the cheez wiz IS traditional... but of course not the only option. Provolone or american are also common here in Philly.

For the best Philadelphia cheesesteak try Tony Luke's at Front & Oregon in South Philadelphia - good meat, rolls, cheese (no wiz). You won't be disappointed. Forget Pat's and Geno's. They're tourist traps. Oh, the recipe - it's ok for a sandwich, but not a real Philadephia cheesesteak if that's what you're after. And, honestly, why would you want anything else? ;)

It looks like we have a lot of food snobs here. "That's not a cheesesteak?" Come on, now! Who says there must be one kind? It's like saying "that's not a hamburger" just because it has mushrooms and Swiss on it instead of just lettuce, tomato and onion. Variety is the spice of life! And American cheese or cheesewhiz?? YUCK!!! I didn't even like that garbage when I was a kid.

Note that this recipe is not labeled as being a "Philly" cheesesteak. Having said that, I ordered a cheesesteak when I first moved to DC from the Philly suburbs 12 years ago. What I got was an actual steak, covered with gruyere on an open-face slice of bread. What the !!!! To the person from Vancouver, a lot of people still consider the original Pat's on Passyunk in South Philly to be the best -- although I'm sure you'll get plenty of differing opinions. Also, lots of times, you can great cheesesteaks (and hoagies and water ice) from local Mom and Pop places.

Gourmet seems to have gone off the deep end (and never visited Philadelphia). This is not a cheesesteak. Beyond the comments below on the meat, I point out you would never use cheddar on a cheesesteak. Provolone, american or cheesewiz, but never cheddar. It's an insult really

As a person born & raised in Phila, I'm sorry to admit that the "cheese steak" never rang my bell -- (and I actually like crusty scrapple.) I thought this sounded like an improvement over "cheese whiz." Now that I am over 50, I'm willing to give it another try. Will be in Phila (now resident of Canada) over Thanksgiving. What's the best place for the definitive cheese steak?

I'd rather see it made with steakums.Unless of course you used some nice sirloin tips but then it wouldn't even be a cheesesteak.

I have to agree with a couple of the other reviews. This tastes nothing like a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. I don't know what makes the difference, but I've tried them in just about every state from NJ west to CO and nobody seems to have it right.

It is impossible to rate a cheesesteak or steak 'n cheese sandwich. There are so many variations. I like mine with SHAVED rare roast beef chopped up on the grill with extra mushrooms and american cheese melted right on the grill with the steak. This is good, but I prefer ordering my favorite from our friend's restaurant in town, that of which I described above.

You've got to be kidding!!!! This is not a cheesesteak! This is a poor imitation! Onions should be 1 inch cubes, cooked in oil, not butter. Beef should be raw Chip Steak, cooked in oil, pulled apart while cooking. Has to be on an Amoroso roll topped with either American Cheese or Cheezewhiz. I'm so tired of people screwing up our sandwich!

My sister-in-law from Philadelphia gets rare roast beef shaved. Otherwise, the pieces are too thick and globby and unpleasant to chew. Try it again with this variation and you might like the recipe better.

This a great hot roast beef sandwich, but it's just not a cheesesteak. I've been eating Philly-style cheesesteaks for many years and this is just not the same thing. Try substituting thinly sliced (raw) beef and sauteeing in a pan while pulling apart as much as possible using either 2 spatulas or forks, then following the rest of the recipe, which is not half bad.
