This has become my go-to pie recipe. Even people who aren't "dessert people" flip for this pie. Can't wait to make it for Thanksgiving (or any other occasion that comes along).

I loved the crust - LOVED it. The pie was pretty darn good, however mine needed a bit more sweetness - perhaps a sweeter apple would resolve this? I think next time I will use a combination of Granny Smiths and Honey Crisp apples.

This pie was so tart it was practically inedible without a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream. Way too tart, and I like tart pies like strawberry rhubarb. Won't make again.

I am not a baker, and I hate making pies. However, I will make this one any day of the week! The crust is a breeze to make, and the pie is fabulous. I am not in charge of making this pie every Thanksgiving. Terrific.

Not too runny/watery (my #1 fruit pie affliction!). My husband came back from eastern Washington State with 10 pounds of hand-picked Golden Delicious apples that were going uneaten--more of an eating apple than a pie apple, but they were great in this recipe. I used two Trader Joe's products: turbinado sugar (I used a 1/2 cup, because my apples were sweet and not tart), and "Dried Pitted Tart Montmorency Cherries". You will MOUND the filling into the pie, and need to be careful not to tear your top crust. Baked in a convection oven at 375 degrees for 1h 15 min (my oven auto- corrects 400 degree to 375), and the color was perfect (not too dark). The filling will cook down by 1/2, leaving a towering "muffin-like" top crust. The apples and cherries have a distinct flavor; the pie filling looks "normal" and appetizing, and not as pink as I was expecting. My family always eats pie slight warmed with half-and half, often for breakfast; this pie was great this way. A keeper.

PS to previous: I always use Pillsbury Ready Made Pie Crust. Good pie crust just doesn't seem to be in my skill set.

This is my go-to dessert. More than one guest has said, "This is the best pie I've had in a long time"...or "...ever." Even those who aren't normally dessert eaters eat the whole piece. Perfect balance of sweet/tart, and I love that it has cardamom in it.

Read the reviews, made it for Thanksgiving without a trial run...I stuck to the recipe exactly (which is hard for me to do) and this pie was amazing!! Wouldn't change a thing.

This was probably the best pie I have ever tried. I served it for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. I will be making another tomorrow. Yummy.

Addendum to last review... I am not in love with the crush recipe for this... I think I will try out some others. It seems a bit tasteless and too crumbly. Crumbly may be due to my imperfect technique, but tasteless... maybe i didn't add enough salt. Also, I was embarrased to admit that I left out the cornstarch on my first try (by accident), so I made the entire pie twice. But I'm here to tell you that it's really not bad at all without any cornstarch whatsoever. It was quite delicious both ways.

This is the first apple pie that I have really loved... Wonderful recipe. I am not an experienced pie-maker and was afraid to over-handle the crust... The crust was so flaky that it was a bit too crumbly when I was trying to cut it---maybe I could have handled it a bit more. But wow, it was fantastic.

Great pie! I used honey instead of sugar and it was delicious! Have made it several times now.

This is the best apple pie I have ever made. I have made it several times now, and the cherries add that extra something that makes it seem special. I use a Pillsbury ready made pie crust and substitute a crumb topping for the top crust. It's the family favorite!

The filling for this pie was outstanding! (I can't review the crust, as I used one from Trader Joe's.) I had to hunt all over town to get the dried tart cherries, as most of the stores were out of stock, but it wound up being worth it. I wasn't sure what kind of cherry preserves to use, but I wound up going with Hero black cherry. (who knew there were so many choices?) My pie-hound husband thought that this was one of the best I have ever made.

The pie is delicious and unusual -- the cardamon adds an intersting dimension. I might try a different crust -- this one seemed a bit heavy.

I made this again yesterday for a dinner party. Excellent! Of course I had to tweak it a bit. I used only 1/2 c. sugar plus the preserves. This amount of sugar is perfect, especially if you serve the pie with ice cream. I also cooked the sugar, spice, and apple mixture in the microwave to prevent the gap between crust and fruit. I microwaved the mixture on high in 3 minute intervals, just until the apples were starting to turn translucent and the juices were glossy. This took about 11 minutes in my microwave. I used a different pie crust recipe, a basic crust with butter and shortening. I covered the crust with foil, but missed one edge that got too brown. Oh well, it was still a delicious pie.

Excellent twist on apple pie. Tasted best when fully cooled.

This was the first pie I've ever made. It was fantastic.... the flavors of the cardamom, apples and cherry preserves contrast beautifully. This pie recipe goes well beyond delicious. As other reviewers have noted, do pile the filling way up to the top, and remember to cover the crust with foil 15 minutes into baking to avoid over browning it.

It's really a great pie. The crust is EXCELLENT, and the apples/dried cherries are a great combo. I didn't like the idea of all that cornstarch (I don't know why - it just seems like cheating, or using fillers or something), so I used half the recommended dosage. Use Plugra or one of them European butters - it makes a difference.

The BEST apple pie I have ever made or eaten. I have made this many, many times since it first appeared in l997. My family and friends wouldn't think of letting me use any other recipe! A superb recipe.

Oh boy this was delicious. I used the Joy of Cooking deluxe butter crust which is great. The pie was oozing butter, so I might cut down the butter in the brown sugar mixture next time. But it was a huge hit for Christmas, great flavor and so pretty!

This is a terrific pie. I served it at a dinner party and several people requested the recipe. It would be an excellent addition at the Thanksgiving table.

Fabulous recipe, fabulous flaky melt-in-your-mouth crust. My guests raved! I didn't bother peeling the apples. The apples piled up so high (just used the 3 lbs. called for) that the top crust wasn't quite big enough to meet the bottom crust and seal. I just draped the crust over the top and left it alone. It was gorgeous! I did follow the advice to protect it with foil about halfway through the baking time.

This pie was absolutely fantastic!!! I used Granny Smith apples and it was a wonderful contribution to a pre-holiday dinner. I will definitely make this again and again.

I also added the juice of half a lemon to the sliced apples. The pie was delicious, it satisfied our fall palate in the same way that rhubarb pie does in the summer. I will definitely be making this one again.

Wow, this was great! It wasn't too sweet. The crust was easy and beautiful. I couldn't find dried cherries alone so I substituted combined dried cherries and golden raisins. Plan to make again next week for Thanksgiving.

I loved this pie...making it again for a christmas eve get together....truly awesome...I couldn't find dried cherries so I used frozen ones that I drained well.

The pie was good, but a bit over-rated, certainly not the best I have ever had. Cover pie entirely with foil after cooking 25 min.

WOW! What a wonderful recipe!! Everyone loved this apple pie. I did do a few things differently, though. I soaked the apples in lemon juice right after I peeled them. I also added some apple pie spice. You definitely need to fill the pie to the brim. It will sink if you don't! This recipe is a keeper!!

This was a great recipe. Most of the kudos have to go to the crust which came out fantastically and the spices.

This was the first real pie I've ever made, and the best I've ever eaten. I've had apple pies before, but this was incredible! I did neglect the "place pie on baking sheet" part, so it was a little messy in the oven, but otherwise was easy to make and delicious. Rave reviews from friends and family! (And tons better than the one my mother-in-law made the following week!)

I have been making this pie every fall since I found it in Bon Appetit in 1997. It is excellent. The crust is delicious, and the filling pleases everyone--not just apple pie lovers. Be sure to fill the pie right to the brim; it will sink a bit during baking.

This is a great pie - I made for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I did cover with foil during baking to prevent it from browning too much. Also make sure you use tart dried cherries, some are much sweeter than others. This is great served warm with vanilla ice cream.

This pie was very good. However, I definitely agree with Reviewers No. 1 and 2 that you must either cover the pie with foil half way through, or partially cook the apples beforehand.

This pie made an excellent dessert for our Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved it! You may want to cover the pie with foil 15 minutes into baking so it doesn't brown too fast.

I made this pie last year for Thanksgiving, and I plan to make it again this year. I did a dry run last weekend. I changed just one thing in this recipe: I sauted the apples, sugar, spices, preserves, and cherries in butter before filling the pie crust. This method solves the problem of the gap between the crust and the apple filling. However, while cooking the apples long enough to slightly soften, the sugar started to caramelize. I liked the flavor, but I didn't like how dark the filling ended up. For the real deal this week, I will cook the apples for few minutes, and then add the sugar and preserves and cook for a few. Total cooking time <10 minutes. Then I plan to spread them on a sheet pan to cool, and that's when I will sprinkle them with the spices and add the cherries. I also plan to cut the sugar to 2/3 cup. I'll let you know how this version turns out!

I must have missed something. I have baked so many pies in my life but thought that this was rather boring and somewhat bland. I was nervous about serving it. I sent it to my husbands work. My husband and his friends liked it.

I made this pie over the weekend, and it was fantastic! As one of the other reviewers commented, it is just the perfect harmony of sweet and tart. I made leaves using the dough scraps and "scattered" them over the top; the result was photo-worthy and would be great for fall entertaining. You definitely need to cover the pie with foil about half way through, though, to keep it from getting too dark.

This is the best apple pie I have either made or tasted. It is relatively easy to make (even if your relatives are a little slow).

I have gotten rave reviews for this pie. People have said they will never be able to eat store-bought pies ever again. The tart cherries balance the sweetness just perfectly.
