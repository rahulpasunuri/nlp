I thought, this is much to simple to be good. I was wrong. This was delicious. You can play with the spices depending on your mood! I confess I made it for myself, but I know that there are a lot of busy people out there who would love to "pull it off" for little effort. This is definitely the recipe for that. Try it! I did use fresh steelhead instead of salmon, but I am sure this would work with almost any dense oily fish.

This is excellent and easy - appropriate for quick weeknight meal or company. I've used different flavored salts to vary. This has become a standard go-to method for salmon.

Definitely will make this again. Used chopped fresh tarragon and creme fraiche that was spreadable. Although the creme fraiche melted and did make a bit of a "sauce", it still tasted rich. I agree with the other reviewer that the wild salmon taste was enhanced with this recipe. My husband raved. This is a very simple recipe that turns out to be quite elegant. Will make for a dinner party since it is so easy!

why WOULDN'T it taste good? These are terrific and expensive ingredients, so it's not surprising that this is a great recipe. We have used it for company and for weeknight dinners (when we were ready to spring for the $20/lb that wild salmon costs in this area). Make it with something that soaks up the sauce; potatoes, risotto and cous cous have all worked well with it. If you can find lemon creme fraiche, that's a great addition.

This is a wonderful recipe that is great for simple fabulous entertaining. I have made it twice, and I used different brands of creme fraiche. I do believe there is a difference in the brands. One was thicker and held quite well over the salmon, one was more runny and had a creamier consistency in the finished product. I preferred the thicker creme fraiche, but both were yummy. I used fresh dill over the salmon before I "frosted" it with the creme fraiche. And I also think that salting the salmon before adding the creme fraiche made the finished product a bit more runny, next time I am going to just salt the dish at the end before tossing it in the overn.

This is a very simple, delicious way to prepare salmon. The creme fraiche, surprisingly adds to the moisture and flavor. Who knew? I added several herbs: thyme, rosemary, chives (whatever I had growing outside) and it tasted fabulous. Without the flavor of the herbs it may have been bland.

The creme fraiche actually surprised me in that I thought it brought more to the dish than I had expected. That said, even with dill and lemon, this was a fairly straightforward dish without much wow factor.

I have made this twice now and everyone raved about it. The nice part of covering with creme fraiche is the salmon stays very moist. Both times I covered 1/2 the fillet with fresh dill. In the future I will try it on a cedar plank.

This was very tasty, but I didn't think the crème fraîche imparted any extra flavor. The salmon (wild king) was very moist and full of flavor. I expected, perhaps incorrectly, that the crème fraîche would give the salmon a tang, but no, just delicious salmon flavor. Hard to complain about that.

Disappointing after all the rave reviews. The creme fraiche ran off the salmon onto the pan, although some was left on the fish.

this was delicious! i wasn't sure what to expect, but it was so flavorful. the salmon was so moist too, and the creme fraiche melted into a luscious sauce.

Made this last night with wild coho salmon -- it was easy and delicious. Even my husband, who never looks happy when told we are having fish, thought it was very good. I didn't have dill, but I put lots of salt, pepper and lemon zest under the creme fraiche. Obviously, the fish quality is important; farm raised salmon wouldn't have enough taste, I'd guess.

I made this last night and can't stop thinking about how good it was. What a brilliant way to cook salmon, it came out super moist and had a wonderful buttery richness to it. Two things. One, you have to love the flavor of salmon to appreciate this dish. There isn't anything (heavy citrus, ginger, miso, etc) in the recipe to mask the natural flavor of the fish, which is what I found so appealing. Second, use good salmon. We sprung for fresh copper river sockeye and it was worth it. We figure it's only available fresh for about a month so we have to take advantage. My 2 yr old couldn't get enough, he kept saying "more fishy." Will be making this again very soon.

Very easy, pretty good, but a little bland, even with the dill and lemon zest.

To jspecht: It's so easy to make your own crème fraîche. Add about 2 tbsp. buttermilk to about a cup of heavy cream, and let it stand for several hours (at least 8, or up to 24) at room temperature. Once it thickens, stir well and refrigerate. Use within 10 days or so.

This recipe was a cinch to prepare. It was good, but didn't have the "wow" factor that I reserve 4 forks for. Definitely a good go-to weeknight meal.

Yummy and Quick! I used S&P, Tons of fresh dill and the zest of 1 lemon, and pressed into filet. I then massaged the Sour Cream on top of the filet over the seasonings (they don't seem to have Creme Fraiche readily available in the St. Louis Metro!....grrrr) Turned out fantastic! Easy weekday recipe...now if I could just get fresh salmon off the boat in the midwest.....

So easy. I used farm raised Scottish salmon. They were a bit thick so it took longer to cook, but was delicious. put a little creme fraiche to the side as well. Add a salad. Done.

My husband and I made this with some fresh Copper River salmon last night. Instead of roasting in the oven we put it on the grill. The simplicity of the ingredients brought out the buttery richness of the salmon.....amazing!
