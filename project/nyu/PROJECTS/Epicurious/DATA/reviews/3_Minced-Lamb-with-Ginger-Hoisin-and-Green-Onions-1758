I loved this recipe but I used pork instead of lamb. Next time I will double it - this would not fill up 4 people. It isn't very saucy but that doesn't mean it's not good.

Definitely on the more 'solid' side, which is fine if filling lettuce leaves as the recipe intends. However, I wanted it over rice as a main dish and found a need to add additional liquid. I prefer most of my food on the drier side, but even for me it was, as madk from melbourne said, 'very gluggy'. I served it with some leftover dry-fried green beans.

Good flavours but very gluggy. If I made this again, I would definitely skip the corn starch.

We liked the lamb alot. I think it needed more hoisin though. After tasting it I decided to put in the full small sized bottle of hoisin. This gave it excellent flavor. Served with stir fried green beans and cilantro rice intstead of lettuce leaves. Delicious.

I agree with Brooklyn, I have also been making this recipe monthly since it came out in April of 94. My family including two kids love it! It is so easy to make, the only changes I ever make is if we feel like having with a spicy edge, adding some dried chilies.

This became one of our favorites from the first time we tasted it, back in 1994, and still makes it to our table every month or two, ten years later.

I actually liked this recipe, though I agree that it doesn't benefit much from all the corn starch. It's a nice, slightly sweet, change to the usual that my young son loves with rice. Will be a part of our regular routine (though I will undoubtedly find shortcuts for all the mincing).

A rather unpleasant tasting dish, which none of my family enjoyed. Would be considerably improved, IMHO, by the addition of: 1 tbs Dark Soy Sauce 1 tbs Light Soy Sauce 1 tbs Rice Wine (or substitute dry sherry) 1 tsp minced red chilli Forget about thickening the sauce, and just stir fry the cooked rice in with the minced lamb and sauce.
