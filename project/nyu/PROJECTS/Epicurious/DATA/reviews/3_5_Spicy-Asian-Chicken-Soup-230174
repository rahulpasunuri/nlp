Fantastic/easy! Did put my own spin on it to save time & add dimension... -1 whole roast chix, shredded from bone -6 scallions, some green tops included -1 cup shredded carrots (1/2 bag prepared) -2 bunches bean threads -increased chix stock to 64 oz -increased soy sauce to 1/3 cup -added 1 tablespoon fish sauce -increased fresh lime juice slightly -used Shiitake mushrooms -cut red pepper into matchsticks sauted the scallions & carrots in 2 tablespoons butter, then set aside in bowl with red pepper & scallions, tossed so flavors combined made the broth as indicated, simmered 10 min.& turn off, added bean threads & steeped for additional 10 min. added chix & vegtables...gave it a good stir & let cool slightly then added the cilantro (I just tore the leaves from stems & added) Dinner is served!

This was very good, but I did it as an udon stir fry rather than a soup. I boiled udon noodles in water. At the same time I combined all the ingredients except the broth in a wok, and cooked the mushrooms and snow peas in that wok for about 4 minutes (no oil). At the end I drained the noodles and mixed them with the rest of the ingredients. Delicious, low-cal stir fry..

This smelled wonderful while cooking. But, even with the brown sugar, it somehow came out tasting bitter to me. I'm guessing that it was the lime and/or the cilantro. I may try to tweak the recipe but, as written, I wouldn't make it again.

The broth in this recipe is delicious. To rinish the soup, I made these changes: put the peppers in and let them cook for 5 mins before adding the mushies and chicken I also added chinese cabbage at this time. Then added the peas with the chicken and mushies. This way the veg gets properly cooked. I also used chicken thighs instead of breasts 'cause they have so much more flavour.

Great recipe! Hubby & son loved it (meeting approval for Asian at home is very challenging!) I used left over grilled chicken & 1 cup tofu. Didn't have fresh ginger on hand and used 2 dashes dried ginger and still turned out great. Cooked Udon noodles separately, add to serving bowls, then pour soup over. Garnished with green onions. Try to use shittake mushrooms! They have amazing medicinal healing properties with over 80 nutrients that are good for your heart, immune system, and are one of the highest sources of the antioxidant L-ergothioneine - 40x that of wheat germ!

This was excellent. I cooked the shitakes a while on their own first, as have found them too spongy in past recipes.

This soup is easy to make and full of flavours. I would try less ginger next time as I felt it was overpowering with the rest of spices. Not sure if I'll try cornstarch again because some pieces were slimy. Nevertheless, I will try this again real soon!

I loved this soup! The amount of spice is just right and it's a snap to make. I added carrots and left out the mushrooms. I'll make this again and again!

The broth has fantastic flavor. I loved the way the chicken turned out with the cornstarch. I added bok choy and carrots to the broth and before spooning out the soup I put beansprouts in the bottom of the bowl for extra crunchiness! Delish!

Excellent soup! I modified by adding a splash of rice wine vinegar, extra chicken broth, green onions and rice noodles. Delish!

This soup is exceptional -- one of my favorites! I love how the cornstarch makes the chicken so tender! This is easy to make, healthy, has a great spicy flavor and is very filling. I love it and make it often!

Quick, easy, and delicious, with a really nice depth of flavor. I omitted the cornstarch, and it was still great. I also added a full teaspoon of chili garlic sauce (instead of 1/4 tsp) and a generous squirt of Sriracha for more spiciness.

Really easy, delicious, and worked well as is, or with variations. I added a few Asian dumplings and some vermicelli and doubled the amount of chili sauce. Problem is, now we will fight over the leftovers!!

Made this last night to use up some stock and veggies. Nice and spicy and light! I used regular mushrooms, added a bit of corn and skipped the cornstarch. Also added garlic with the ginger. Maybe not as good as hot and sour soup at a Chinese restaurant (then, again, I did skip the cornstarch) but very good.

I added 2 cloves of garlic sliced with the ginger and simmer the broth for about 15 minutes to develop the flavor. I then scooped out the slices as I did not want to bite into ginger or garlic. I added about 1 tbl of chili sauce. I added about 1 cup of cooked asian noodles and I did not have snow peas and substituted baby spinach instead. I used cooked chicken from a roasted chicken and omitted the cornstarch altogether. It was delicious and light. loved it instead of an ordinary chicken soup

I also used less cornstarch especially when I added the noodles since the noodles would thicken the soup as well. And I didn't add the cornstarch by coating the chicken since I cooked my chicken while making the broth, so instead I dissolved it in a little bit of water and then added it to the soup.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe! The flavors were light and fresh and everyone in my family enjoyed the soup and I've made it multiple times now. However I did not have chicken broth on hand so I made my own by boiling together two chicken quarters, some peppercorn, cloves, garlic, the ginger from the recipe, and half an onion. I boiled the soup until the chicken was cooked through and then let it simmer for a few minutes. Afterwards, I removed everything except for the ginger slices.

I think this is definitely a recipe that invites experimentation. I omitted the corn starch because I don't like the slimy texture it sometimes gives soup. I didn't have brown sugar so I used Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce. I also used a tablespoon of chili paste as someone else suggested. That stuff already has garlic paste in it, so if you use it you probably don't need any additional garlic! I am a fan of neither mushrooms nor peas, so I put in some bok choy and bamboo shoots. The red pepper I bought at the store wasn't any good, so I just omitted the red pepper altogether. I ladled it into bowls over noodles and topped with green onions. Delicious!

I modified the soup by adding a little red curry paste instead of chili peppers.

This was good, not great. Very little depth of flavor, despite using good quality soy sauce, adding a head of bok choy & 3 cups of thnly sliced button mushrooms, , plus the red bell pepper, sugar snap peas & scallion tops.

I really enjoyed this soup! I amp'd up the chili sauce, to a tablespoon, I added garlic in the broth right away and I garnished with green onions.

This is one of my favorites! I whip this up when I'm craving something that will clear my nose! The ginger is wonderful.

I was craving a brothy asian soup and this really hit the mark. I had some bok choy on hand which I added but didn't have any mushrooms and it was still very good. I also added some whole wheat spaghetini noodles which made it a little more filling. I will definitely make this again when the spicy soup craving hits.

There is only one ingredient I added to the soup to increase its already-delightful flavor: a few drops of sesame oil, the dark, toasted variety you find near the soy sauces in the grocery aisle. I used chicken stock in the carton and a high-quality, low-sodium soy sauce, for less over-all sodium. This soup's fabulous. Whenever I get a head cold, I love to stop at my local chinese restaurant and pick up hot-and-sour soup, but to make it myself--have you ever seen the ingredient list?! (^_^) This is a super substitute, and it uses everyday grocery items, not tiger lily buds, and other such things I'd have to really go out of my way to find. I julienned the red pepper, but didn't sliver the chicken. If I had to do it over again, I would sliver the chicken as well. Even so, the cornstarch-rubbed chicken turns velvety in the soup. I have put several small cartons of this in the freezer for when I come down with a head-cold next...almost can't wait to try it out!

Wonderfully easy and with lots of flavor. Loved the scent. I added more than a teaspoon of hot sauce and rice noodles to make it more filling, and didn't use mushrooms (I'm not a particular fan of mushrooms). I plan on adding more chicken next time and at the end adding chopped fresh chiles.

I ended up substituting lemon juice for lime juice because of what I had on hand. Also, substituted cooked chicken for raw for the same reason. I added a fair amount of hot sauce to perk up the flavor. I probably will make again as it is quite quick and pretty good, but I would kick up the spices some more.

This soup was very good... I changed the recipe by adding another 8oz of stock and a few more splashes of soy.. I also did a mix of mushrooms instead of just white ro shiitake..

While its flavour isn't particularly complex, it's a good, easy healthy and quite tasty meal for a weekday night. I added rice at the start to make it more substantial, as well as a dried chili pepper to up the spice.
