I've also made this every year since it was published in 1991. Sometimes I mold it, but often just use it like regular cranberry sauce by adding a little extra liquid. I've also used both Ruby and Tawny port and it works well either way. I've never noticed a strong port flavor like some of the others have mentioned, just a lovely melding of the flavors of cranberry, lemon and port. One year, as a joke, I used an empty, clean tin can as the mold, so it looked like the real thing!

I made this the year it was published and Thanksgiving wouldn't be the same without it. It's easy, fresh, and delicious. It tastes great the next day on turkey sandwiches.

I've made homemade cranberry sauce a number of times and this is by far the best one I've tried yet. I was worried about the port taste being too strong so I only used a half cup and didn't make up the difference with any other liquid. I put it in the blender after letting it cook down for a half hour or so, and it set up just perfectly and had a beautiful consistency. The port taste was not terribly noticeable.....all I noticed was how good the sauce was. I'm putting this one in my recipe box and will definitely make it again.

This beats canned cranberry jelly any day. I made it with 1/4 cup port and 3/4 cup water because others had said the port flavor was too strong. My husband can't stand whole cranberries, so I used my Vitamix to blend it smooth and put it in a decorative mold pan. Had a little trouble unmolding it, but after I placed it in warm water for a few minutes, it came out beautifully. Will definitely make this again. I'm never buying canned cranberry jelly again!

I thought I'd lost it. I had it printed out and have been using it for the last 4 years (I refuse to buy canned stuff now), and it had gotten lost in the moving. I'm so glad to find it again!

This is so delicious and well loved by my guests and family. We have made this a traditional dish for the holidays.I have been using this recipe since it was first printed by Gourmet. Thank you Gourmet and Happy Holidays

Sooooo easy to make and really great flavor! The port and the lemon juice together really makes this dish come alive. This one is a keeper and will be made again for special occasions and holidays for the next few years. Only thing possibly negative about this dish is...it's a bit expensive if you are using a good Tawny Port. Try Lindemans Macquarie Tawny Port. It will do the trick!

Easy and delicious! I would make this and eat it even if it weren't Thanksgiving! I have passed the recipe along to friends who have loved it also.

Couldn't have been easier to make! And delicous too! I refrigerated mine overnight which seemed to dull the strong port flavor just a bit. This will definetly be an added staple to future Thanksgivings.

I ran the mixture through a food mill and it came out very smooth and pretty from the mold.

This sauce had a very strong port taste. I like port but my husband does not so next time I'll probably use 1/4 port, 3/4 water.

I, too, make this every year at the request of my relatives. They even called to get the recipe this year since they'll be out of town for Thanksgiving.

Delightful! People wonder what is in this sauce/jelly that makes it different. The consistency is just right too.

I've been making this recipe since I first saw it in Gourmet in 1991. It is absolutely the best cranberry concoction to accompany turkey.
