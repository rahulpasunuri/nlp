Followed others' advice to double the sauce. I doubled the spinach too. Served it with roasted cauliflower, roasted broccoli with garlic and red pepper, and marinated tomatoes teruel (chopped up and served like bruschetta with warm Italian bread).

We agree with previous reviews - doubling the sauce, tripling the spinach, and cooking the salmon only 3 minutes per side. The only change we've made is that we use 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil when we saute the salmon. A real keeper!!

Delicious and very elegant! Got rave reviews from my guests. I tripled the spinach and doubled the sauce per the suggestions of other reviewers. The sauce was perfect but we could have used more spinach. I will make this again and again!

Love this recipe. I had a lot left over because I tripled it, so tonight I added some bread crumbs and a little mayo to the salmon, added the leftover sauce, and sauteed up some salmon cakes. YUM!

Exceptional flavors. Great base recipe. However, thank goodness I read other reviews to double the spinach. That was BARELY enough. I added an entire bag for 2 servings, and we both agreed we could have had twice that amount. Also, I would leave out 1/2 the butter. In the end it was a bit greasy. Next time I'll try that, and adding low-fat or fat free whipping cream. Served with mashed potatoes for a very filling, and very heavy meal.

Fast, easy, delicious. I made a weeknight version of the sauce with milk rather than the whipping cream and it was still very good. Agree with the extra spinach comments.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous dish! Incredibly easy, richly flavorful, impressive presentation - it doesn't get much better than this. I'll attempt to consolidate the advice of previous reviewers, as well as my own discoveries in making this dish several times myself. 1) Like almost every reviewer before me suggests, at LEAST double if not triple the spinach. Those who cook with fresh spinach know that it cooks down dramatically. I used a 9-oz bag for just two of us, and we ate every bite. 2) Double the sauce. Keep the amounts of the sauce ingredients consistent - don't just double the liquid, but double also the tarragon, shallots, etc. 3) Use fresh tarragon. Dried tarragon has a completely different flavor - not nearly as rich or pleasing. 4) Be careful not to overcook the salmon. The recipe says 4 min. per side on med-high - I prefer 2 to 3 min. per side on high, depending on the thickness. This gives you a nice crispy surface, while leaving the interior melt-in-your-mouth tender. Remember that it will cook a bit more on its own after removing from the pan - plus, you'll be heating it up once more in the sauce at the end - so it's better to slightly undercook than overcook. 5) It will take longer than 3 minutes for the sauce to thicken - it took mine 5 to 6. 6) The wine matters! Use a decent dry white wine with some body to it. I used a good, oaky Napa chardonnay. Remember the old adage - never cook with a wine you wouldn't drink! By increasing the spinach enough, you really don't need to serve another vegetable. Add a carb of your choice - I've tried mashed potatoes, orzo, and brown rice. We preferred the brown rice, pouring some of the sauce over it, which produced an incredible earthy blend of flavors along with the pleasing al-dente bite of the rice. Serve with the remainder of your nice oaky chardonnay, and you've got a dish that will impress even the most discriminating dinner-party guests!

I made this last night for another couple and everyone loved it. I made extra sauce and spinach as everyone suggested. The sauce was rich so I did not really need that much but the guys asked for extra sauce. It was so simple I will definitely make it again for a week night or even a special meal for guests. Perfection!

Rating: 4
The number of positive reviews and the simplicity of this dish really caught my attention and did not disapoint! I doubled the spinach and sauce and forgot to buy shallots so used some carmalized onion and minced garlic in it's place. I loved the way all the items were cooked in one pot and the drippings from the salmon really added a nice richness to the sauce. Served it with smashed potatoes (the extra cream from the recipe came in handy for those).

Made this last night for my daughter and her boyfriend. It was quite a hit! Simple, easy and delicious. Only thing I did differently was to cook the fish in a 375 degree oven instead of pan frying it and use chopped garlic instead of shallots. I did double the spinach and the sauce as others suggested. This is definitely a repeater!

What a delight! I'm not usually a big fan of tarragon, but I definitely enjoyed this recipe! I took the advice of other posters and doubled the sauce and spinach portions. I like to cook 'fast gourmet' style, so, rather than cook accompaniments, my choice would be to double the portion size as well. So, that would mean quadruple the sauce and spinach, and double the salmon, if you're cooking for two. Serve with a crusty baguette and it's a meal that's simple, elegant and delicious. Iwill make this in the future, and I will probably experiment with other herbs, even though the tarragon was very nice in this.

I thought this was great. I used 1/2 half & half and 1/2 nonfat milk for the sauce and let it sit a few minutes after it boiled to get a good consistency. Also, I used Wild Salmon, yum!! Both my husband and I thought this recipe was definitely worth keeping.

I liked this, but probably won't make it again. I used about 6 oz. of spinach and it wasn't nearly enough, so I just added it to the sauce (which I doubled). I substituted half and half for the cream, and used dried tarragon. I don't think it affected the taste.

So simple, so elegant. The sauce DOES take longer to thicken, especcially when doubled as suggested by other readers. For perfectly-cooked fish fillets, use the Canadian formula - 10- minutes per-inch of thickness, (1/2-inch thick fish should be cooked a total of 5- minutes), over meduim- high heat.

Wonderful! I tried it tonight and husband and kids loved it. I added more seasoning as in two cloves of garlic in with the shallots and a dash of white pepper.

This was somewhere between a 2 and a 3 fork recipe. The flavor mix of the tarragon and shallots was the highlight, but the sauce never thickened properly -- was really liquidy.

This was sooooo good! I followed the recipe except for doubling the spinach and the sauce - which was definitely necessary, as it still wasn't too much even doubled. It tasted like something you would spend $30 on at a fancy restaurant - and was so quick to make/prepare. I was hesitant to use the tarragon, because I don't like the licorice-like flavor, but I did it, and altogether it was a really nice contribution, and very subtle. I couldn't find baby spinach, so I used regular spinach instead and it was great. Based on earlier reviews, I shortened the searing time, to two minutes per side, and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again - it will be great for company since it's sure to impress...

My husband really enjoyed it, I thought it was okay . I improvised and used a bit of fennel seed instead of tarragon - mistake - too strong. I also had arugula instead of spinach and added mushrooms. I will make again but nooo tarragon.

This was good....but....a little bland for my taste. I think salmon needs a strong tangy sauce and while the white wine/cream sauce was good, I just felt like something was missing from the dish. This might be because I used a chardonnay but I think it still would have been too mild even with a drier wine. The wilted spinach was a really nice base though--I used regular spinach since baby was a little pricey. I got a big bag full and I wished I gotten 2 --- that stuff really reduces!

This dish was fabulous. It was so easy and quick to make. The sauce was great. The spinach was nicely done and the whole dish went very well together.

I would just be sure to judge the power of your stove when deciding how long to cook it.

This recipe is a keeper. Delicious. Not too difficult to prepare. The store didn't have any fresh tarragon today, so I used dried tarragon leaves. It was still very good. Used six oz. of spinach for two people. Made more sauce than called for. Had enough left over to save and serve another night. The only trouble I had was getting the cork out of the bottle of wine. It would not budge, and my corkscrew even broke off into it! This was easily a recipe any great restaurant would be proud to serve.

Excellent dish, very tasty and simple; hard to go wrong with fresh herbs, shallots, wine and cream! I have modified it since, when I didn't have the shallots, wine, and tarragon, and stumbled on something remarkably delicious. I used chopped garlic instead of shallots, sauted mushrooms for the tarragon, and here's the weird part, but it really made the recipe: instead of white wine, I used 1/3 c fresh coffee and 1/2 c kahlua, to deglaze the pan after sauteeing the mushrooms. My husband really loved it, and has asked for it many times since. I call it "Salmon with Spinach Romanov" (for the "white russian" ingredients).

I made this dish per the instructions on Jan 11, 2005 and it is without a doubt the best recipe I've stolen from this site. All I can say to the people who said they didn't like this dish is either they didn't follow the instructions, didn't use fresh ingrediants or just don't like a great salmon dish. I'm a single guy and this will now and forever be the first dinner I cook for my dates and my guess is I won't be single long. P.S. As all the other reviewers say, increase the amount of the sauce and the spinach.

I served this to guests last night. Very professional presentation I served it with mashed potatoes, which is perhaps why it was so rich. Next time, I would serve it with somthing lighter, for sure.

I must admit when I read the recipe I was skeptical but I read the reviews and decided to give it a try - I am very glad I did! I only had two small shallots so I added 4 cloves of garlic (I used most of it in the spinach). I followed prior advice and made more sauce. I used some dried dill to season the salmon and used dried tarragon in the sauce. I used half and half because I did not have heavy cream. With all these changes, the recipe is still a winner. I used about 7 oz. of spinach and should have used the whole 10 oz. bag - it was that good! This will become my "company's coming" dinner!

This was a really tasty and easy dish to make. I would definitely make it again for company. I had never cooked w/tarragon before and we really liked it. I didn't know it had such a nice lemony flavor. Also, I think I may have made this dish w/arugula instead of spinach. I am not that familiar w/arugula or spinach and recently started a service where I get a box of organic produce delivered to me every week. I thought what I had was spinach so that's why I chose this recipe, but when I tasted one of the leaves before cooking, I realized it was quite spicy (so probably arugula). In any case, suffice to say, I think you can substitute arugula w/no problem. Now I only hope it is just as good when I make it w/spinach. Oh, and I did follow previous reviewers' recommendations. I made double the sauce and used about four times the spinach (or, in my case, arugula).

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! DOUBLE THE SAUCE!! The first time I made this it was just ok because I didn't double the sauce and there was not much of it. The 2nd time I used fresh tarragon which also may have made a difference. Both times I used a lot of spinach and next time I think I am even going to use more. Also the 2nd time added mushrooms which worked quite well, and used whipping cream instead of half and half like the first time and I think that was another improvement. I think this is now my favorite salmon dish and I make it all kinds of ways. Haven't tried the maple cedar planked yet, however sounds most intriguing. This spinach one is excellent with wild rice pilaf. The sauce is heavenly on the rice too, so make a double batch for sure. 5 fork restaurant quality and a beautiful presentation! My boyfriend licked his plate. Salmon is now his favorite fish.

Easy to prepare and a taste sensation! Add more spinach and cream, especially if your fillets are 7oz or more. Tip: after the spinach has been divided on the plates, you can keep it warm by placing them in your oven (150 degrees) while the cream reduces. I prepared it a little different; I chopped the shallots small and found it more attractive on the plate. Also, I served this dish with angel hair pasta instead of the squash and it was delicious! I'll definitely serve this dish again.

The only change I would make would be to increase the amount of baby spinach...I used 4 ounces and it wilted away to almost nothing. I used an Australian chardonnay. Try to find FRESH tarragon...the flavor was amazing and the bright green was a nice constrast to the dark green of the spinach. I served it with asparagus poached in the same chardonnay until crisp-tender.

I've tried this recipe twice now, the first time it was just ok. I tried it the second time (thinking I did something wrong) and it still turned out just ok. I love all the ingredients, but oh well...

This dish reminded me of a special time on the Isle of Arran, Scotland. We rented a house, & had access to excellent salmon. Made up this recipe, based mainly on fact there weren't very many cooking pots in the house! Put baby spinach in a pan, add chopped shallot (1 or 2), chopped mushrooms if desired, 2 salmon fillets; then dust with salt, pepper & tarragon if desired; add a chopped scallion and/or 1 small diced tomato if you wish; then pour in a little white wine and cream (now I use the fat-free half & half), and some bits of butter, cut up. Cook gently for 15-20 minutes. Easy, forgiving and wonderful.

Loved this dish--it couldn't be easier. The tarragon is the key to the wonderful flavor. Served it with brown rice for a simple, quick, lovely meal.

Best salmon dish ever!! We're not crazy about tarragonin this house, so I did omit that from the recipe...but it wasn't missed a bit!! Everyone at the dinner party begged for the recipe!

This was incredibly delicious and frankly, I was shocked. I'm not even a huge fan of spinach and I LOVED it. I added mushrooms as suggested and also used creme fraiche instead of cream. I baked some mash potatoes with chevre and we licked our plates. Just stunning.

added crimini mushrooms to pan to saute just before adding the spinach. Delicous. Guests used italian bread to soak up the extra cream sauce.

This was the most delicios salmon dish I have had in ages. The only change I made was to saute some chanterelle mushroom sto add as I love mushrooms. I would positively make this again during the week or for company.

This recipe is fantastic! It takes no time at all but it's as good as something that would take three times as long! I've made it several times alreay, and my boyfriend (who doesn't like wine sauces) loves it. I add a little more shallot, since they taste so great.

I made this for just a small gathering of friends. Because it was informal and the recipe appeared simple, I thought the food would not get in the way of conversation. Boy, was I wrong. My guests loved it!

This recipe easy to prepare and was absolutely delicious. There's no need to add or change anything. I served it with wild rice which my guest said went well with the salmon.
