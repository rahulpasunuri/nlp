Really liked this. It is excellent just as it is. Also excellent with a little fish sauce added to the dressing.

This salad is so darn easy to make and tastes just like a Thai summer roll - contemplating rolling salad INTO spring roll wrappers next time I make it. Yum!

I loved this recipe!! I used it at a cocktail party. If you can take a little heat,instead of red pepper flakes i tried a little jalapeno pepper. If you can handlr it.
