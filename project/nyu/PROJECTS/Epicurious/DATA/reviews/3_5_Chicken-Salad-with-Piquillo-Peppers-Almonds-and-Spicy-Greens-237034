Fairly tasty. I'm not sure the chicken was worth the effort, though. I might make the same salad with store-bought rotisserie chicken next time. Also, I'm not sure the basil really added anything. This may call for a different herb. I'm curious what you all thought about the piquillos because I used a roasted red pepper instead. I wonder if a roasted poblano or Anaheim pepper would make a good substitute.

I did not go through the time consuming, roasted chicken. Took four breasts and seasoned with the smoked paprika, S&P. Cooked the breasts bout 8 mins in olive oil. Sliced and set atop the salad. Used manchego as well. With these changes, it is a KEEPER and guests thought so as well

I had high hopes for this recipe, but my family was disapointed with it. We won't make it again.

I was pretty lazy so I just picked up a rotisserie chicken from the store and used some Caesar dressing I had in the fridge instead of making the dressing here. Oh my my - this was great! I never thought I would actually eat those spicy/bitter salad greens with such gusto. My husband did, too. This is a keeper!

Excellent! Used roasted red peppers because I could not find piquillo peppers. I had no drippings, so I added juices from the roasted red peppers, and used good EVOO. It's simple, definitely a keeper.

I have only recently discovered piquillo peppers - they are worth locating - rich, sweet, smokey. I will be on the lookout for more recipes featuring piquillos!

We made this salad a few days after the chicken, and it was great. My husband said it was the best salad he's ever had (and we've both worked as cooks). The almonds, green onions, and basil each add something special. Definitely making this again.
