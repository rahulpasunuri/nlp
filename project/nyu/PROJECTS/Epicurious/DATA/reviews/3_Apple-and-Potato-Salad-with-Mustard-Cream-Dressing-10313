I made this for 4th of July weekend...It was FANTASTIC! The only reason I am not giving it 4 forks is because I made some changes. Like some of the others below, I subbed low-fat buttermilk for heavy cream. I increased the amount of mustard, lemon and pepper. In addition, I used more scallions than called for and added crumbled crispy appledwood bacon. Everyone thought it was delicious ...even my finicky non-potato salad eating husband liked it. Definite keeper!

I've made this dish a few times now, and it always seems to hit the spot, but only after some substantial modifications. I love the combination of the vegetables and apple, but the dressing definitely needs to be punched up a bit to compete with the heavy cream- I double to triple the mustard, lemon juice, salt, sugar and pepper and once it sits overnight it's heaven! Also, to liven up the color, instead of using parsley I leave the skins on my Gala apples and add extra celery and green onions. Looks good and tastes great too!

I've tried this recipe twice and both attempts have been unsuccessful. First, who writes a potato salad to serve only 4 people? Potato salad is for potlucks and bbqs, not for a small dinner. Something must be getting lost in having to quadruple this recipe because the flavor is blah. The apples pretty much carry all the flavor.

This was tasty enough but was wholly unappetizing looking. I minced up some red pepper (radishes might have worked too), and sprinkled generously with pepper - and still had to put it in a bright coloured bowl to make it look good. I might try paprika next time.

Unique taste, lighter than most potato salads. I used Gala apples for more crunch and low-fat buttermilk instead of cream (double the mustard and lemon juice to compensate). I recommend making it at least a day ahead to let the flavors meld.

A great recipe. Can substitute low-fat buttermilk for some of the heavy cream to cut the fat. Add more mustard and lemon juice to carry the flavor.

I made this salad last weekend for a party I was supposed to go to (and ended up not going to), so I have been munching on it all week-I love it! I've been making potato salad for a long time, and was looking for a different and unusual recipe to try. to the person who thought the dressing was too runny-try letting it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving. I too thought that it would end up too runny, but after sitting for a while it ended up being perfect! Will definitely make again!

To Lisa: No! No! No! Don't use flour to thicken the dressing!!!! The reason it was too runny was that it wasn't whisked long enough. Whisking will create a creamy, thick dressing.

Very different and delicious. I doubled, almost tripled the recipe and it was the hit of a buffet. I used a bit more lemon juice, extra on the apples while I waited for the potatos to cool. All my neighbors want this recipe!

I haven't made it yet, but plan to do so this weekend. I will probably substitute cilantro for parsley, which I invariably do. Will give you my thoughts later. When can I give you an actual rating after today?

At first, I was a bit apprehensive about this dish. I first prepared the dressing and I tasted it as I always do and found it too salty. But, when mixed with the apples & potatoes it worked like magic. My only problem with the dish is that my dressing was a bit "runny". I will try again next time with a small dab of flour to thicken the dressing.
