Point of clarification for those mocking the removal of gelatin to make this recipe vegetarian: The majority of (US/European) vegetarians are ovo-lacto vegetarians, meaning the removal of gelatin is sufficient to make this recipe vegetarian-friendly. Butter, cream cheese, and egg do not make this dish non-vegetarian, they make it non-vegan.

Well if I would have followed the directions I would probably b giving this four forks instead of three but unfortunately I took it upon myself to look at Cook's Illustrated best recipes NY style cheesecake recipe which of course is totally different from this b/c of the gelatin. So in case you were wondering do not bake this at 500 for 10 minutes and then decrease to 200 for the rest. your cheesecake will get overcooked. Also, I will not be using a water bath because the bath leaked into my cake. So on my third try, yep third try, I actually made it right and it came out perfectly! I used an 8 inch springform and didn't have enough time to cool it properly but it was still creamy and delicious!! Oh and as far as the dulce I am enamored with the process of using sweetened condensed milk that has been boiled in a large pot for an hour and a half. Great recipe, for those who actually follow directions;)

I recently made this for a pre-holiday party--everyone loved this--had great things to say about it. I, on the other, hand didn't think it was a rave. It's good, but not knock my socks off good. I'll make it again because it certainly was a people pleaser.

I've made this recipe twice now and it's delicious! I use a regular graham cracker crust. The first time I made homemade dulce de leche, and the second, used store bought (Nestle brand) and couldn't tell the difference. Also baked in the water bath the first time, not the second, and couldn't tell the difference either. Neither one had any cracks. The second time I doubled the recipe and it fit nicely into a 9x13 pan. I used a food processor to mix the cheesecake in, which resulted in a very smooth mixture. This is probably a key to not getting any lumps, like some of the other reviews mention. This is a keeper in my recipe box!

I made these for a wine tasting party last night and was worried about the mixed reviews, but they were a huge hit and the group was all a bunch of food industry people. I used ground up honey Teddy Grahams for the crust. Believe it or not, the grocery store I went to in the major metropolitan area of Chicago did not have digestive biscuits and only enormous six pack size boxes of graham crackers. So Teddy Grahams it was. The crust turned out great. I also used the dulce de leche sauce recipe from Epicurious and made sure to boil it down a little extra thick. The ingredients for the cheesecake filling didn't mix well in my stand mixer with the paddle attachment. I ended up running the batter through a seive to smooth out the lumps of cream cheese. The filling turned out perfect and smooth when it baked. I skipped the chocolate topping because I didn't have enough time and also I put the cheesecake almost immediately into the freezer after baking. It turned out perfectly and I was able to cut it into squares after only one hour. The recipe was very sweet, but to me, full of dulce de leche flavor.

Not worth the effort. The crust was boring. I followed the recipe and only kept the squares in the fridge for 30 minutes after adding the chocolate and they were way too soggy. Much better the next day but still would not make again. My kids wouldn't even eat them.

I made these for my friends on New Year's Eve. The choclate glaze was kind of weird and popped off when I cut into it, but it tasted good, as did the cheesecake. You definitely need good quality dulce de leche for this recipe (I bought mine in Argentina, but you can find "authentic" kinds in ethnic markets). I didn;t do the foil, will do that next time. Also, the geltain did create white flecks in the cheesecake.

I love Dulce de Leche, so I tried these in spite of a couple of so-so reviews--because there were so many raves. Unfortunately, while I think these were a good cheesecake cookie, and my husband really liked them, they didn't really capture the dulce de leche flavor. So kind of a waste of dulce de leche! Better to use it to make sandwich cookies from the digestive biscuits--which I did with the leftovers of both. I did like the crust from the wheatmeal crackers, not quite as sweet as graham crackers.

It's worth looking for digestives in Asian or Middle- Eastern stores. If you must use graham crackers, add a pinch of salt and some wheat germ.

This was much easier than I expected. It turned out perfect and has such a delicious taste, but it is sweet so you probably won't like it if you dont have a sweet tooth. I used McVities Digestive Biscuits I found at Whole Foods for the crust. I also made my own dulce de leche from whipping cream, brown sugar and sweetened condensed milk based off of the dulce de leche sauce recipe on this site. I also had to throw the cake into the fridge almost immediately after cooking, but it still turned out perfect with no cracks. My co-workers inhaled the bite sized pieces when I brought them in for a holiday treat. I'm glad I thought to save little at home for me!

To be honest I changed the wheatmeal crackers for regular chocolate animal biscuits. It was a hit and super easy to make.

So tasty - my boyfriend thinks it's one of the best things I've ever baked, and I bake A LOT. I used regular graham crackers for the crust and 2% milk for the custard, because that's what I had on hand. So good. Also, in graham cracker crusts I typically add 1-2 T. of rolled oats, which I did for this recipe as well. It gives it a tasty flavor.

Fantastic! Used the dulce de leche sauce recipe from Bon Appetit and the flavor was wonderful. Cooked about an hour.

These were incredible! I really don't understand why they are not getting four forks every time! I made them for a party and brought them. People could not stop talking about them. I used a good quality dulce de leche (from Central Market) and good quality chocolate. Maybe that is the secret.

I also made the crust ahead of time, pressed it into the pan, didn't bake it and set it in the fridge for 3 hours before placing the rest of the cheescake on it. Turned out excellent, had a sort of Heath bar texture and taste. I also let it cool almost completely so it would not have a big crack down the center. I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk simmer in water for 3 hours instead of the dulce de leche. I also doubled the recipe and made it in one pan for a thicker cake. Only took an hour to bake. Water bath cooked it perfectly. Would highly recommend.

I loved it. I couldn't find dulce de leche in the stores so I made my own. I used graham crackers for the crust and made it in a spingform pan instead of an 8 X 8 baking pan. I made it for school and everyone loved it!!!

I made these for a neighborhood get together and they went over very well. Great for a party--they're easy to make, most everyone loves cheesecake, and bars are easier to deal with than slices of cheesecake. Unfortunately, the dulce de leche flavor wasn't really strong but it made them more interesting than a plain cheesecake bar. I left the gelatin out because I don't like the texture it imparts and the bars set up just fine.

We made these squares for Christmas again this year and again they were a big hit. We find the sweetness of the chocolate topping perfectly balanced by the (Carr's) wheat-cracker crust and the not too sweet dulce de leche cheesecake filling.

What a fabulous recipe - and I don't even like cheesecake! We had a Mexican theme for Christmas Eve with our family and they went over fabulously. Everybody raved about them. Lots of requests for the recipe. I only used half the gelatin and left the cheesecake in the oven for many hours as it cooled (to prevent cracking).

I found this reicpe to be just ok. Beautiful when displayed and fairly tasty but not a repeat. Be sure to really beat the dulce de leche into the cheese mixture. Recipe says to gently mix but this leaves gelatin lumps in the final product.

I made these squares last year for our family Christmas dinner and, I have to say, they were the biggest hit by far. Not one square remained!!! My sister-in-law (in Florida) asked me to make them again this year. I couldn't find l.y's Gourmet Dec. issue so I was relieved to find the recipe on-line. It is safe to say this will be a part of our Christmas dinners for years to come. note: we're a Mexican-American family and 'dulce de leche', or, 'leche quemada(Cajeta)', was always a treat for us. This gave us a chance to introduce it to the next generation.

I have not made this recipe yet but wanted to respond to the reviewers who cannot use regular gelatin. Most health food stores and kosher groceries/delis carry Eims (sp?) Kosher Gel. This is a vegetable based gelatin and works the same as regular gelatin. I have used this often as a substitute and have been very happy with the results.

I did not make this recipe but I wanted to clarify something: A few reviewers didn't seem to know what wheatmeal crackers were (digestives)... they are not the same as wholemeal or whole wheat crackers. They resemble more graham crackers with a light sweet flavor rahter than salty taste. If you cannot find digestive crackers in your area, graham crackers are a good substitute (as others have used here).

I made these for a friend's party. They were consumed quickly and lots of people asked for the recipe. They also looked beautiful.

This was excellent. The creamy, beguiling flavor of the South American caramel sauce was enhanced by a very subtle tang from cream cheese. Not sure if somebody else already mentioned this, but you'll need 12 crackers if you're using Carr's. And, I didn't use a double boiler to make the glaze, I melted it over very, very low heat directly on the stovetop.

This dessert was a huge disappointment. I love cheesecake and I love dulce de leche but the combination was awful. There was no clear dulce de leche flavor, just a sickening sweetness. The gelatin made it gummy; I ditched the recipe.

I made this recipe for a rather large dinner party and it was phenomenal. Everybody loved the dessert and said it was by far the best of the evening. It even got a rave review from a former food critic that was at the party. This is a great dessert, especially when you are looking for something different and a little unexpected.

Would like to give it a 2.5 forks as it was very good and made great finger dessert for a large party. Would agree with other reviewers that the flavor was not as intense as I would have expected. The controversy over the gelatin is interesting. It likely isn't necessary if you are not interested in clean firm cuts for the 1 inch squares and certainly may detract a little from the flavor. I used the dulce de leche sauce recipe from this site (accompanies the mascarpone cheesecake w candied pecan) and it was easy and great. Because I was making it for a large party I doubled the recipe and made it in a 12 1/4 x 9 x 1" jelly roll pan - it didn't quite hold all of the filling and next time I would use a little less crust as this became a little soggy and the flavor overpowered the cheesecake-would also stick to graham crackers, I found the Carr's whole wheat crackers, but I think the flavor of regular old graham would be a better match

Used fruit pectin as a substitute for gelatin, and used all organic ingredients. Also used the Dulce de Leche recipe from Bon Appetit January 2003. The results were divine and of course a hit at the party I took them to.

Leaving out the gelatin does make the recipe vegetarian. Vegetarians do not eat gelatin since it is made from bones, hooves, and animal skins. They do eat dairy products and eggs. I think you might be thinking of vegans, who don't eat any animal products (including gelatin, dairy, etc.).

This is a good recipe- as it looks impressive and is not hard to make. I will use it for my upcoming Valentine's Day party. And leaving out gelatin to keep this vegetarian? Then leave out the eggs, butter, and cream cheese too!

Made this for New Years Eve. Delicious! I made it in a larger round pan as my 8x8 was out on loan, so the icing ended up being thicker and the cake was thinner, but everyone loved it, and one thing I cannot do is bake. Great!

Why not add gelatin? Is Cream Cheese and egg your idea of a vegetarian dish?

I thought this was a great recipe. I used graham crackers for the crust instead of the wheat crackers. I couldn't find jarred dulce de leche, so I made it myself (4c milk, 2c sugar, 1tsp baking soda and 1tsp vanilla, cooked for 1 1/4 hours). I agree with other reviewers that the squares did not have a pronounced cheesecake flavor (I think that could be achieved by adding more cream cheese), but I thought they were decadent and rich. I brought them to a party and they were the favorite. Even non-cheesecake eaters loved them, even though that's no surprise.

Thought wheat biscuits made crust too salty and dulce de leche flavor was not very pronounced. Kind of bland without a good cheesecake taste.

Delicious. I used graham crackers instead of digestive biscuits, which I couldn't find. I did not use the gelatin (I wanted to keep it vegetarian, and other reviewers felt it was unnecessary), and I also did not add the chocolate layer. The dessert was so sweet and rich that the chocolate just seemed like it would be overkill.

Rating: 2
I used the gelatin and didn't have the issues the previous two reviewers had. However, I was disapointed that the the flavor didn't have more pizazz. Sort of boring really. I think this recipe has potential though ... just need to add more flavor to the filling. Regardless, 20 guests gobbled up 3/4 of the pan.

Rating: 1
Awful. The gelatin made the filling so thick and gluey; total waste of good jar of dulce de leche. Also, gelatin must be heated in order for it to dissolve properly, otherwise it ropes and leaves ugly little gelatin balls in your product. Will try agin without gelatin for a lighter result.

Rating: 3
Very nice, though I'm not sure what the gelatin added, as the cheesecake layer was very firm. I'd definitely leave it out next time.
