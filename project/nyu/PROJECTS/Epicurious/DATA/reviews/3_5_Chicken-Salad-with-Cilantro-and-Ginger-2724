This was excellent. I did make some changes based on what items were in my cabinet- I replaced chili oil with chili flakes, rice vinegar with white wine vinegar and shredded romaine with mixed greens. I omitted the almonds, added orange slices & other salad fixins and used low sodium soy sauce. I did not like the taste of the marinade when used as a salad dressing & preferred the salad "dry" with just the juices from the chicken & vegetables for flavoring. I found the dressing to otherwise be crazy salty & overpowering. Next time I'll just halve the recipe and use it purely as a marinade.

Re the last review: Essentially, the recipe DOES tell you to reserve part of the marinade - it says to use 1/4 C to marinate the chicken, leaving about a 1/4 C to put on the salad later.

I was concerned that the recipe did not say to save part of the marinade to use as the dressing. You should never eat something that was exposed to raw chicken. This makes way too much for just a marinade. It was delicious, however, and benefitted from adding a bit of sugar to take the edge off the intensity. I liked the suggestion of using mandarin oranges rather than tomatoes.

Mine came out too oily! Definitely needs some citrus to balance out the flavors.

the almonds are key! I used a little over a pound and more chicken than salad. I threw in mandarin oranges as someone else here suggest. I loved the balance of flavors.

Sesame seeds, nuts, & cilantro added just the right mix to spruce up the romaine. Made just the salad part without chicken to accompany Filipino Adobo Chicken on this site.

Doubled this for a girls get together and had just enough. Omitted tomatoes and added Asian cucumbers. Cooked chicken and toasted nuts the night before. Easy and good.

Wonderful! I loved it!

I substituted cucumber for the tomato, and used a rice vinegar (vinegar, sugar, salt and sesame oil) dressing for the greens. It came out really well and made for a wonderful light summer meal.

We loved this--very light summer fare. I was out of tomatoes and did not miss them--they seem out of place in this salad. Also, as a main dish salad it really served only 2 of us. I used two boneless chicken breasts so it may not have been a full pound, and we omitted the tomatoes, but it served 2 of us very comfortably. We will have this one often!

Definitely too salty. I would also add the mandarin oranges to the dish. I would make it again but cut down on the oils in the dressing. It could be lighter and maybe you could add some Lemon on lime?

Great light summer meal. Skipped the almonds but tossed in a small can of mandarin oranges. One of my favorite salads. I frequently make this without the chicken as a side dish.

I would make this again! It was a hit. I did end making the chicken the night before and dripped some of the vegetable oil and chili oil over the chicken. I seasoned my wooden bowl with the vegetable and chili oils. I also chopped up the red onions and tomato's instead of slicing them.

This was good, but not great. The sesame seeds and almonds gave it a nice crunchiness, and I'll make it again using rice stick noodles, too. Also, I'll definately go with the crushed, bottled ginger. Finally, I didn't drain enough of marinade before I cooked the chicken, and so there was too much salty marinade flavor and not enough chicken flavour.

Both my husband and I love this dish and we have it two or three times a month. I often omit the chicken and serve it as a side salad for company and it always gets rave reviews. I recommend using bottled crushed ginger. That makes the already-easy recipe super easy and we can't tell the difference in taste.

Quick Easy and lite, the dressing is a great base for other dishes

I'M NOT MUCH OF A SALT LOVER, SO IF YOU'RE NOT TOO, YOU MAY WANT TO USE LOW-SALT SOY SAUCE. IT WAS A BIT TOO SALTY FOR MY TASTE. 4 FORKS FOR EASE AND FOR QUICK PREPARATION.

i made this salad for a party and it was a hit! i would cut down on the sesame oil, though. it's easy and fast to prepare. the dressing is so tangy and the salad flavorful.
