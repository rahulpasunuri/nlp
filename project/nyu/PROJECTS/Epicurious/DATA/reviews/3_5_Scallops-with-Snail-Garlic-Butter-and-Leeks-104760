The scallops were delicious however I took into consideration what people said about the leeks. I left them out and instead made potato and celery root puree with truffle oil. It turned out great!

These were VERY tasty! I think next time, I'll definitely add mushrooms and eliminate the leeks.

Try putting the snails in mushrooms along with the garlic butter mixture. Indeed, I am not sure wht the leeks add.

I made this recipe a week ago and my husband is still talking about it! He even went out and bought more scallops today. The recipe was very easy and delicious! I put about 4-5 scallops on each of 2 large scallop shells, and that worked well.

Easy - & delicious. Deserved 4 forks because of the simplicity. I also nestled thickly sliced mushrooms among the scallops. Do not forget crusty bread to sop up the buttery juices. To further save time, would not necessarily have to puree the ingredients for the snail butter. Second time I made this (during the week) I sauted the garlic in the butter & added the chopped snails & parsley.
