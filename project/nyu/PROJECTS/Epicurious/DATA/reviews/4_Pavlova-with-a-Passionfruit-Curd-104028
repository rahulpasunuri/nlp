Since passionfruit is so expensive and hard to find, in my area, I buy the puree from "Perfect Purees" based in Napa. It comes frozen, and has no seeds, but it is truly JUST passionfruit--it's great!!! I do make the curd, but I don't use it straight, I whip cream and fold them in together, creating a much lighter texture. I also made a coulis with raspberry and passionfruit juice for some color and a little extra tang! I love this recipe!!

I tried this recipe after enjoying pavlova on a trip to Australia. It is terrific and everyone I have made it for loves it. Instead of passionfruit, I top it with berries. Plus I add about a teaspoon of sugar to the heavy cream.

I love making and serving pavlova and this version is fantastic. I left the passion fruit seeds in since it's such a pain to separate them, and it didn't change a thing, except appearance. I'm always looking for passionfruit recipes since we grow them, and this is a repeat.

The first time I had palova was in Australia, and this is an authentic recipe. I cook it about 50 minutes and top with kiwi, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries or whatever berries are in season.

I made the merigue according to this recipe. Really easy! Instead of the passionfruit curd I used whipped sweetened Creme Faiche, blueberries and Kiwi. Delicious! Will definitely make again!

I only tried the passion fruit curd part of this recipe, but I found that between the egg and the butter the curd turned out too heavy - not light and tangy like I expected - I'll be trying one of the other recipes on this site next time - but the combination of meringue and passion fruit is a winner for sure!
