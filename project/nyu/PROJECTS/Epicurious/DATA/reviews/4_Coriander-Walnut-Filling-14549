As noted, this is great with the beef. Some people may not like the cumin, but it really is good, and not your typical "wellington" taste. I've also used it (and am going to do it again) with Salmon in puff pastry. Almost better than the beef!

THIS FILLING WAS INCREDIBLE WITH THE TENDERLOIN OF BEEF, AS INTENDED. IT WOULD ALSO COMPLEMENT PORK PERFECTLY. DELICIOUS!
