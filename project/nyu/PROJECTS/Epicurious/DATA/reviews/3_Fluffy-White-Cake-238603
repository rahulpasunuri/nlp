I made this recipe exactly as the directions described per a birthday request. It was a delicious cake that tasted like a top notch bakery made it. The only reason I don't give it 4 forks is that how exceptional can a white cake be? This is as good as it gets.

This cake was awesome... one of the best white cake recipes. The cake was moist and taste great. Texture was fabulous... if you got a different texture you probably over mixed...

HORRIBLY DRY and bland. GROSS. Don't make it. Martha Stewart makes a way better white cake.

The taste was bland, and the texture was a little too springy. I found the egg whites gave this cake too much of an eggy taste like french toast. Overall, I think this cake is okay, but certainly not worth the effort.

I made this cake in preparation for a wedding. I used one batch for a 12 inch square cake pan. It cooked evenly, however, was too dry.

I found the cake itself slightly dry compared to other white cakes I've made however it was still very good. The curd was perfect! Simply amazing, and the buttercream! WOW! This is my new buttercream recipe! It was SO easy to work with. I've never been great at decorating but this icing just made things so easy. It was so smooth and tasted great.

I made this cake for the fun of it last Sunday. I made the whole recipe 1 time, and used two 8 inch square pans to bake for 50 minutes. I made four layers, and used lemon curd and raspberries to fill the layers, and the buttercream to frost it. I took it to work on Monday, and everyone loved it...it was SO yummy, the entire department was commenting on how good it was. I had extra scraps of the cake left over and covered them with sliced peaches and extra lemon curd for a little dessert at home. There was still a little cake left on Thursday (five days after I made it) and it wasn`t dry at all. Maybe try just making the recipe as is, without changing anything, instead of decreasing it. Be really careful when adding the egg whites, they make the cake nice and fluffly and moist, but if you over mix the batter it will just be dense instead. I wouldn`t make this for my wedding though, I followed all the directions but the end product was still not very professional looking (hey I`m a scientist not a pasrty artist!) but SUPER YUMMY!

I halved this recipe as a trial run for my first attempt at a wedding cake. IT was easy enough to prepare. However, I frosted it the next day, and cut it the day after that (times according to the recommendations on this whole cake assembly) and it was simply too dry. I will probably use this recipe, but I will brush the cut layers with syrup before assembling, like a genoise. The recommended fillings alone aren't enough to moisten the cake.
