I really wanted to like this simple sauce for chicken; I have dozens of ripe Eureka lemons from my tree (though the snails devoured my basil plant in 2 days), screaming to be used in fresh and inventive ways. Unfortunately, this sauce was just too, well, lemony. I did not like it as is, tried adding more chicken broth, some wine, but it was just too tart. Will find some other clever way to take advantage of all my beautiful, home grown lemons, but won't try this again.

So easy and delicious with few modifications! I sprinkled chicken with panko bread crumbs before cooking. I browned the chicken on both sides, then removed from pan. Added 1 Tbsp of flour and 1 Tbsp. butter to sauce. Used 3/4 c. broth and 1/4 c. white wine. Then I returned chicken to the pan to finish cooking while the sauce thickened. My family of 5 loved it with brown rice and spinach salad.

When I followed the recipe, the "sauce" turned out more like a soup...but it was a good soup. Roux works to thicken. I've also made different variations, adding tomatoes, capers, spinach - all w/ great success. I also really like serving it over Trader Joe's Lemon Pepper pasta.

very enjoyable but missing something. next time i will try adding roux, wine and capers. Hubby loved it over pasta. I used the frozen chicken tenders I buy in Costco. always on hand and easy to thaw. It was not the slightest bit dry.

Made this again tonight, when I thought I had everything, but it turns out I have no lemons! I used half an orange instead. As I added it I thought it wasn't going to work, but it still turned out really nice. No thickener used, just a little butter to finish the sauce at the end. Served it over penne which sort of worked.

Awesome,awesome dish. I enjoyed mine with pan roasted tomatoes and served it over fettuccine. I was worried the sauce might come out too sour, but it was perfect paired with the chicken and actually made an excellent topping for the fettuccine as well. Great stuff; I'd def. prepare this again.

I have made this many times when I'm in an absolute hurry to cook and my imagination otherwise fails me. Every time I'm finished I think, never again! It's too meh. But then I find myself in a pinch again and here I am reviewing this recipe while I eat this dish for the umpteenth time. This time, though, I added cream along with the broth, and a little flour like the other reviewers suggested. Nothing moves a recipe up from mediocre quite like cream (or butter). I'll be making this again with my fat and calorie laden modifications.

wish I had read the reviews before trying this. Overall a good recipe but I will make the changes recommended by some other reviewers next time. It was great to use end-of-season basil from my garden.

Great weeknight dish! I used white wine in place of half the chicken broth and added some roux.

A strong dish. I thickened it with a roux and we really enjoyed it, but I might add some dry vermouth or white wine next time to give it a bit more balance.

I liked the flavor of the chicken. Served it on top of pasta...and spooned the sauce over it. I didn't thicken the mixture. Very easy and fast.

This turned out really well, with some roux added to thicken, and some white wine to add fragrance and flavor. I also cut up the chicken to small pieces, and put back the chicken to cook with the sauce.

very good, very strong lemon flavor though. as recommended i thickened with a roux and added more chicken broth to reduce the strength of the lemon. fantastic over rice with a fresh green bean salad.

Why does the chicken need to be tented when it is only removed from the pan for 30 seconds???

This is good for a healthy weeknight dish. Used spray instead of olive oil to really reduce the fat content. I served over white rice and, like others, added the chicken back in at the end. Also would recommend doubling the sauce if serving over rice or noodles. Light and with plenty of flavor but not anything too impressive.

have tried this, great with egg noodles and thicken with a bit of cornstarch Instead of flour

Sauce didn't really thicken up very well...otherwise it was decent. The lemon was kind of overwhelming, but that might have been due to my own screwup.

This recipe wasn't bad. The flavors were good I liked all the flavors but the "sauce" I would hardly call sauce. I imagine sauce as thick and this was just liquid, which is good for keeping the chicken moist but just weak in thickness. My husband somewhat enjoyed it as well

This was excellent served over rice . I also used a splash of gin to deglaze the pan before making the 'gravy'with the roux modification. Nicely lemony and the basil worked well to offset the bitterness.

I used much less basil and half white wine and half chicken broth. I had to thicken it with roux. It made for a decent and quick weeknight meal.

Increase amount of sauce, I used 3 sliced chicken breasts and had just enough sauce. Definately thicken sauce with roux. fresh basil

Lovely lemony flavours. Added 2 teaspoons chopped capers about half way through the reducing stage - yum. Reduced fat content by only using about 1 tablespoon olive oil. Can highly recommend for a quick, healthy, tasty meal.

I am on a strict low fat diet after a bout with pancreatitis. This is one of my favorite dishes from an italian restaurant near my home. Problem is that I need to be able to monitor the fat, so now I can have this meal and know the contents. LOVE IT!!!

Easy, light, and very tasty! If served over linguine (like I did), you have to make double the amount of sauce. I also add the chicken back into it at the end.

Rating: 3
I followed the other chefs suggestions. The recepie would have been too bland if I didn't. Had to add 1 tbs. of flour to sauce to thicken it up. Otherwise an aromatic dish that is tasty if the chicken is added back to the sauce for finishing.

Despite some initial hesitation after reading a few negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by this easy, tasty and relatively healthy recipe. I did, however, make the following changes. I sliced the chicken into strips for a quicker cook time, added a good amount of white wine to the sauce as well as some chili flakes, and finally, used better than bullion instead of broth with a little bit of water. I also returned the chicken to the sauce at the end to cook it all the way through. I served it with couscous and green beans...a very good weeknight recipe!

I made this dish for a few friends I had over, served over a bed of linguine. I also made a roux, and added some leftover chardonnay, which made the sauce more tasty. A great dish for spring and summer evenings - not heavy at all. Loved it!

Rating: 3
I found this extremely tasty and refreshing! I changed it a little by chopping the chicken before browning and then returning it to the pan in the stock to finish cooking. I also used half stock, half white wine. I served with cous cous cooked in chicken stock with the left over basil & lemon peel thrown in for flavour & decoration. Some greens on the side and it was a surprise hit!

SOOOOO flavorful, I could smell it all over the house. You know when something's so full of flavor that you can feel it on the back of your tongue, it almost makes your jaw tense up? It also froze and reheated well. But I think it could have used more sauce.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe except I doubled it for 4 breasts AND ... when chicken was done I added 1/2 C. dry white wine to loosen up the crispy bits in the pan. Then added lemon / garlic ... Let that boil a bit, then put in 3/4 C chicken stock. I had made a roux (soft butter mixed with flour for those who don't yet know) and added a little bit at a time until it reached desired consistency. Threw in the basil and served it up with lemon / spinach couscous and some steamed broccoli. It was zingy and delicious, my kids (10 & 8) enjoyed it too. I think that it does need something more ... capers, mushrooms, shallots??? ... something. What's nice is you can play with it a bit to make it "yours". Have fun!

Absolutely awful! No flavor, even using your tips. Used all fresh ingredients and wished I had saved them for a better dish.

Sublime. Fast, simple, and delicious. I just threw the ingredients in a food processor, poured over the chicken, and baked until done. I bet the sauce would go well with fish, too.

I made this chicken for company and it received rave reviews. The key is to use only fresh ingredients, not dried basil or artifical lemon juice. I added some sliced lemons around the edges to make it look even nicer.

While this recipe was quick and easy, I thought the sauce came out too tart and sour. I followed the recipe to the letter. Maybe some cream or butter could have rounded out the rough edges, but there won't be a next time.

This chicken was great. I didn't have any chicken broth so I used a can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with a little white wine. The chicken was moist and tender and there was plenty of sauce. Very quick and simple... I'll make this again.

Fantastic. As others say, thicken the sauce a bit with corn starch or flour. The sauce won't look good in the pan (clumps of garlic and all...) and for a second you think you've failed, but then you pour it over the food and it is out of this world!!!

This will be a standard recipe in our house. It was so fast and easy and amazingly tasty. I too took someone's advice and thickened the sauce a bit. I served it with Jasmine long grain rice which was fragrant and complimented the sauce wonderfully.

Hubby and I thought this was quite nice. I added a bit more garlic and lemon rind. My sauce didn't really thicken but nevermind. I threw some long-stem brocolli in while it was boiling away - the sauce was perfect for it.

I agree with the previous reviewer -- I served this over rice and there wasn't enough sauce.

This dish is simple and delicious. I added some corn starch to thicken the sauce up and it was great. Adding mushrooms also gives the dish more flavour. I highly recommend using fresh basil.

My fiance and I really enjoy this dish. We used mostly fresh ingredients, which I think helps in a recipe like this one. I thought that the lemon sauce added a nice touch, as chicken breast (in my opinion) tends to be dry. We didn't use fresh garlic, though, and I'm wondering if that would have made a difference for the better. All in all, a fine meal.

Make more sauce. I used half the chicken (2 breasts) but the full sauce recipe. It was just enough when served over pasta or rice.

We really liked this recipe. OK, so I breaded the chicken first, then sauteed it til brown and added it back to the sauce to finish cooking. I also used some roasted garlic cloves left over from some other wonderful recipe. Other than that "I followed the recipe"!

After following this recipe to the letter, the sauce was inedibly lemony and sour. Had to throw ridiculous amounts of butter and cream at it in order to be able to eat it all! Not sure what went wrong, but I don't want to try this again anytime soon.

I understand why they call for unsalted broth in this recipe. I love all the ingredients called for in this recipe. I even added in a splash of wine. It looked fantastic but I did not enjoy the flavor at all and found it really salty. I can't say I'll be making this dish any time soon. There is another recipe on this site called Lemon-rubbed chicken legs with garlic & rosemary. It is excellent. It can easily be made with chicken breasts if that's what you're looking for.

I expected a lot more from this dish after reading all of the reviews. I think basil, lemon and garlic all have strong flavors and that none of them really came through in the sauce. I also think the chicken definitely needed some kind of bread crumbs on it before sauteing as someone suggested.

Very Tasty and simple to make. Loved it blanched some asparagus in the sauce while it was reducing about 3-5 min worked great asparagus had just a hint of lemon in it.:o)

a yummy, simple, fast dish. I wish I'd read the messages about doubling the sauce. That's good advice, as the recipe yields precious little. I recommend paring this with some pasta and a light (raw or steamed) vegetable.

Just a suggestion to make it a even tastier. If you put some plain bread crumbs on the chicken before you cook it, a nice little touch will be added to the entire flavor of the dish.
