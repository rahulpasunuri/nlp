This is a great sauce. I doubled one batch and made one single batch because I wanted 1 quart for a large do-it-yourself sundae party. The first batch I used the cream from the refrigerator, and it seized up when I added it. It took a lot of stirring to make it smooth. The second batch, I heated the cream first, and it stirred in very smoothly and easily. I also added vanilla, butter and salt as previously suggested.

Great, easy sauce to make. I added a tablespoon of butter at the end just to make it even tastier.

I made this to go with the Caramel-Banana Bread Pudding recipe from this site. The sauce was great! It also took longer than 8-9 min (maybe closer to 15) but otherwise pretty much went as the recipe says. Also, my caramel also "seized" when I poured in the cream, to the point that I initially thought I would have to throw it out and start over but after ab out 3-4 min of stirring over low heat I had a lovely, smooth and very tasty sauce. I have been eating the leftovers on ice cream and it reheats very well. Will definitely make again!

This is a great basic caramel recipe- pretty foolproof. If you don't have a pastry brush to wash down the sides of the pot, just don't stir the caramel at all while it is cooking. It shouldn't crystalize if you leave it alone. I doubled the recipe and it came out fine. I also added a pinch of sea salt, some vanilla extract and some vanilla cognac I had on hand. The salt really brings up the flavor. It is still cooling, so I'm not sure what the room temperature consistency will be, but from how it looks now it will be fairly thick. Yum!

I made this yesterday to drizzle over a milk chocolate cheesecake I was taking to a dinner party. I followed the suggestions of others and added 2 tbsp. of butter and 1 tsp vanilla after removing from heat. The sauce was absolutely wonderful! Got rave reviews from everyone. Very easy to make. It did take about 15 minutes for the sugar mixture to turn deep amber. And, just a note - if this is your first attempt at caramel sauce, when you start adding the cream, the sugar mixture "siezes". That's normal. Keep pouring and stirring, and the sauce will blend together.

Weee Hoooo! Success! My last attempt at caramel was a dismal failure at best. This was quick, easy and required not even one fire truck.

good and very easy. without the butter, it does make a richer, less creamy sauce. i'd stop cooking before a "deep" amber as well - and be careful, it browns very quickly once it starts.

GREAT recipe. By far the best I've tried (and I've tried a few). I agree with the other reviewers that it takes longer than 10 minutes to reach a "deep amber color" - for me it was about 14 minutes. I followed the suggestion given by stipendous and added a little butter, vanilla and sea salt at the end. DE-LICIOUS!

This caramel sauce is delicious and foolproof. I freeze it(it never gets so firm you cannot spoon it out )reheat the amount I want and use it over ice cream,apple pie etc. I use it in every recipe that calls for caramel sauce. a big spoonful tastes good too!

Very subtle and creamy. I added a bit of vanilla extract at the end too. Having it over cheesecake! Easy to make too.

I adjusted the recipe to make it dairy-free by using Silk nondairy (soy) creamer in place of the whipping cream and it worked fine. Also, after removing the mixture from the heat, I stirred in 2 Tbsp. non-dairy margarine, 1 tsp. vanilla, and a pinch of sea salt. The results were great. Delicious vegan caramel sauce! Anyone looking to avoid lactose/dairy or wanting to eat more animal-friendly should try it this way! YUM.

Yum. Caramel has always been one of those recipes that I just can't get right, but this recipe broke my curse. It's really tasty and easy. I had to let the mixture boil about 13 minutes before it got to the right color. good luck!

Very good. I'd say you should go for a medium amber color rather than deep as mine continued to darken as I stirred in the cream.

This was the best caramel sauce I've ever had and my family agreed. We poured it over brownies and ice cream and it was divine. The little that was left refrigerated well and didn't get grainy. Holds up beautifully when reheating in the microwave. As other reviewers stated, it definitely takes more than 10 minutes to come up to a deep amber color.

Maybe I messed something up, but it wasn't what I wanted at all. It's more of a very rich - not creamy - dulche de leche caramel that would be good with cinnamon that than a creamy caramel that would be good with chocolate.

This sauce is YUMMY!! I had made a brownie with a macroon crust and the whole thing was really hard, so I made this sauce and poured it over the whole pan of macroon brownies, and wa~LA! mouthgasms all around

Great Results. I changed this a little by reducing the cream 1/4 C and then making up the difference with 1/4 C Bailey's Irish Cream. I added the baileys first to cook out some of the alcohol and then added the cream. It was delicious! I served it over Chocolate Bread pudding, which was a little to sweet, but it would be great over ice cream or cake!

I made this last night with great results. I'm not quite sure i cooked the sugar syrup long enough, but it still had a wonderful caramel flavour and perfect texture. Next time I'll chance cooking it longer for an even deeper flavour.

Simple, simple, simple and yummy, yummy, yummy. Had to boil for about 12 minutes and then three or four minutes on low and it was done. Great recipe and a keeper.

...and THIS is why I love Epicurious!! After disastrous results trying a Emeril recipe, I came here for a caramel recipe. Easy, delicious, definitely a recipe to keep handy! One note: it took longer than 10 minutes to get a dark amber...and watch it carefully!!

wow this tasted amazing... however I used golden blossom honey instead of corn syrup. i use the sauce as an ice cream sunday topping. it also keeps well in the fridge. i reheated it in the microwave 2 days later and it was still perfect.
