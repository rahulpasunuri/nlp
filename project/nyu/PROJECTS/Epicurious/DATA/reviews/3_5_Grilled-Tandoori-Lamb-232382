This recipe was wonderful. I didn't have enough cardamom pods so I used tsp ground cardamom. I also used only 1/2 tsp red pepper to make the dish less spicy for my kids. I used the rub on lamb chops and let them sit at room temp for about an hour before grilling. I served them with chopped cilantro sprinkled on top. Very delicious!

This is a great marinade. I used coriander instead of fennel because hubby does not like fennel. I had a beautiful boneless leg of lamb tied to perfection. I inserted garlic slivers and rubbed the marianade all over. Let it sit for two hours or so in room temperature. Bake 350 15 minutes per lb. Full of flavor, super easy to make. A keeper! Served with mint raita.

Works great for lamb kebabs that you can grill outdoors or under the broiler.

My husband and I just loved this dish! He said it was the best lamb he ever had - and that is high praise coming from a Brit. This will become an Easter dinner staple for us.

I used the seasoning on a lamb loin and put it in the oven at 400 for about 15 minutes and it was perfect. There is a great recipe for naan bread that goes great with it!!

we thought the cardamom was overwhelming, will cut that down in half for the next batch. We don't own a spice mill, so we ground it up in a mortar w/ pestle, maybe that didn't get it quite so fine. We had it on grilled salmon and that worked fine.

Absolutely delicious and goes perfectly with the grilled vegetables and mint raita. The chat masala is a good substitute (I find the garam too strong), and lamb chops instead of the leg, was also perfect and easy to BBQ. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was delicious! We have several great Indian restaurants in the area, one just a couple of miles from our home, and we love the cuisine - this is as good as anything we've had out.

This recipe is terrific. Of course, it does help if you actually use the ingredients called for instead of using unsuitable substitutes. As for the reviewer who gave it two forks - you should not demote a recipe to two forks because of your own cooking/grilling inexperience or error. The same goes for other reviewers who make ridiculous ingredient substitutions and then cannot understand why the recipe was unsavory.

The lamb immediately caught fire when I placed it on the grill, which caught me a bit off guard. (I realized later that perhaps I should not put meat fat-side down on a hot grill, as oil tends to burn...) After 25 minutes on the grill, the meat thermometer read about 125, but once I started carving it, I realized it was far too raw to serve, so (with guests at the table) I popped it in the oven to cook for another 10-15 minutes. In the future, I think I will use the spice mixture on smaller, more manageable pieces of lamb, since all in all, the flavours were good....

Certainly could make with lamb chops - just rub the spice mixture on, let stand and then grill. Not surprised that "it tasted funny" when replacing cardamom with wintergreen and other spices - my personal opinion is that wintergreen is only to be used externally for sports injuries - if you are concerned about the cost of cardamom, try and Indian store - it is not expensive and tastes wonderful - especially ground in coffee

Do you think this could be made with lamb chops instead? Would the method change any? I cook for one usually so I don't see myself doing a butterflied leg of lamb. Also, just a request; could you type in lower case, not all caps - it's jarring to read. Thanks :o)

I MADE THIS RECIPE USING LAMB CHOPS. I DID NOT USE CARDAMOM BECAUSE IT'S SO RARELY CALLED FOR IN RECIPES AND COSTS $11.00! I GOT A SUBSTITUION OFF THE NET WHICH SAID FRESH GROUND NUTMEG COMBINED WITH WINTERGREEN WOULD DO THE TRICK. I USED FRESH MINT INSTEAD OF EVERGREEN BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE SAUCE THAT GOES WITH THIS DISH AND THE VEGIES. THIS RECIPE WAS PART OF AND "ENTERTAINING" MENU. SO THE COMPANION TO IT IS "GRILLED VEGETABLES WITH MINT RAITA". THE RECIPE RECOMMENDS SERVING THE SAUCE ALONG SIDE THE LAMB AND THE VEGIES. WHEN I MADE THE SAUCE AND TASTED IT, IT TASTED A LITTLE WIERD SO I MADE A BACK-UP SAUCE JUST IN CASE. BUT WHEN EATEN WITH THE LAMB AND VEGIES, IT WAS GREAT AND COMPLIMENTED BOTH WONDERFULLY. (DON'T FORGET TO SALT IT) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU LOOK UP THE VEGIE RECIPE AND MAKE BOTH TOGETHER. THIS WAS REALLY VERY, VERY GOOD, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE INDIAN FOOD.
