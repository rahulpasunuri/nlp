This is SO good and so easy. I used white wine, half & half, and chives because that's what I had on hand. It was outstanding and will be a regular on the menu.

I've made this several times both for guests and just for myself 'cuz it's sooo easy. The sauce (equally simple) really makes a difference, but having it without works well, too. I've made the sauce using the clam juice and also substituting with chicken broth, and honestly I liked it with chicken broth better. It's a little "milder". This was the first recipe I ever made from Epicurious 10 years ago!

Known as "Special Salmon" at our home, this is the recipe that all of our friends hint at when they hear my husband is cooking for a large group. Every single person who has tried it (from 1 year old and up) loves it!

My family loved this dish!!! They made a request that I serve this more often! I liked it because not only did it taste great, it was so easy to prepare.

Absolutly delicious! Made it today for the second time and now this will be my go to recipe for salmon. First time I didn't have the cream sauce and it was exceptional, this time I made the sauce and WOW that really kicked it up a notch! If you havn't tried it do so, you won't be dissapointed.

This is absolutely delicious and has definitely become my new favorite way to enjoy salmon! I think I may cut back just a bit on the butter in the future, as I feel that the salmon becomes a bit greasy for my taste. Other than that a perfect recipe!

This was a staight forward recipe. It was easy, quick and tasty. I followed the suggestions, from other reviewers, using white wine instead of clam juice. I also sauted a chopped shallot in the pan, then added the wine and cream when making the sauce. The end result was very nice.

I made this for my Girlfriend and her best friend for lunch today, it was absolutly the best salmon I have ever had! Quick easy and delicious....I recommend this for anyone who likes salmon, especially those who have only had it with (yawn) lemon dill sauce.

Fabulous flavor, nice to have something new up my sleeve - I'll be making this again and again. Didn't have clam sauce (imagine that!) so used a splash of white wine with the cream to make the sauce and it was great.

Easy to make and very good. Used white wine instead of clam juice. Placed salmon on bed of arugula and served with beet greens (sauteed in olive oil with garlic) and a yellow beet.

I've made this recipe a couple times. Once with the sugar seasoning, once without. Both were great. I also sauteed the green onions in browned butter then added the clam juice and cream. Delicious!

Surprisingly good for how simple it is to prepare. I think I will saute some shallots to add the next time I make this.

This is incredibly simple and quick to prepare. After making it several times, I substitute light brown sugar for regular sugar. This is a keeper!

I made just the salmon (I actually used steelhead trout, but they are nearly identical), not the sauce--it was super good on its own. I also left out the garlic powder, as I don't keep that around, and sauteed in a mixture of olive oil and butter. the butter and sugar turn into a thin layer of caramel, almost. Very good, very fast and easy. There are only a few ways I've found to prepare salmon that I like and this is one of them. The sweetness cuts the richness of the fish.

This salmon was awesome!!! I prepared the cream sauce but in the end I would have to say don't even bother with it because the rub itself its amazing. The balance between the sweet taste of the sugar and the salt was perfect. This is a keeper for sure.

Everyone at dinner liked this a lot, including my 9-yr-old. Myself, I thought it could use some improvement. The rub was a bit salty (and I used a little less salt than the recipe called for). And I didn't think the cream sauce added anything. Next time, I won't bother making the sauce and I'll experiment with the rub -- less salt, maybe brown sugar, herbs...

This was fantastic! I am watching my carbs, so used Splendil to replace sugar. It was great.

Found some wonderful wild salmon at the market so gave this a try. It is simple to prepare and was enjoyed by all. The amount of sauce seemed excessive though.

I've made this dish twice. I'm amazed at how wonderful it is and easy too!

Have made several times, for the "I don't like seafood" Husaband, and He loves it. He likes it better with the skin taken off prior to cooking (Ack! That's the best part, to me!). Have also used this with tuna steaks.

A fun, easy and delicious recipe to add to our "salmon collection". It uses ingredients we always have on hand ----- a great "quickie" for unexpected guests. I've already passed it on.

The dish tasted OK, but it didn't taste like salmon. The rub completely overwhelmed the fish.

Super, super good! With or without the sauce, the rub is great!

This was simple to prepare and very good. I made extra sugar-spice mix to coat the salmon which gave a better coating. I used chicken broth because it was all I had but clam juice would have probably been even better.

Delicious as easy to make, have made it a few times already... I did substitue the clam juice with some organic tomato soup, made a nice thick tomato cream sauce that complimented the salmon. I definitely recommend this recipe!

My family love the salmon. I used the chicken broth instead of clam juice. My son said he would eat that again so it was a big hit in our house.

So easy to prepare and so delicious! We had a salmon fillet with skin and it worked perfectly fine. Served with Rosemary Lemon Orzo Pilaf, and Tomato, Caper, Olive & Blue Cheese Salad (both from this site) along with Katie Brown's Herb & Onion Focaccia. Made it back on 2 July for family out east and they loved it! KIMBER

Fab-U-Lous!!My sister made this dish and we loved it! She is allergic to clam juice, so she made it with chicken broth. Still great. We have made this several times.
