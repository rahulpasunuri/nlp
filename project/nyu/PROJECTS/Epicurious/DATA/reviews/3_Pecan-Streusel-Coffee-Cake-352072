I love this cake but the recipe has some omissions in it. First it doesn't tell you how much greek yogurt to use and second it doesn't tell you when to put the milk into the recipe. This could be why there are negative reviews of this cake. I used 8 ounces of greek yogurt and 1/2 c. of milk and it work great. I added both of these ingredients at the end of the recipe. I also used a tube pan and cooked it for 40 minutes. The cake was very moist and delicious.

This was good but not great. What kept it from being great was that it was somewhat dry. I agree with one of the other reviewers that it also needed more spice in it. With so many recipes in the world to try, this was is not even worth tinkering with in my opinion.

Baked in a Bundt pan for 45 mins, but probably could have taken out even earlier as it was a bit on the overbaked side. Added banana extract and will try adding real banana's in the middle next time also. Delicious and not overly sweet.

I baked this a little longer than the estimated time, about 55-60 minutes. I also added more butter and greek yogurt, came out perfectly moist. with this recipe I've noticed you can pretty much eyeball the amounts of sugar and yogurt, as the original recipe is sweet, but not sweet enough for my liking. this coffee cake is excellent. I have it for breakfast alongside my coffee, fruit and an egg. I hope you all enjoy it as well!

I have made this twice and it's been a huge hit! I used a combo of whole milk/half&half instead of yogurt and it was very moist. Also baked in 9 inch cake pan per other review. I think this one's a keeper...

This cake was not worth the effort. Really dry despite the yogurt. I certainly wouldn't make it again.

I made this in a bundt pan and put chopped apples with the streusel in the middle of the batter. It was delicious.

I don't see why people hated this so much. I used a 9 inch round cake pan, it cooked for the exact time it said, no sinking, and came out great. The streusel part was probably my favorite, could have eaten the whole bowl before I put it in the cake! I had to drain my yogurt, and did it overnight, but it only really needs about an hour and a bit to get all the excess water out.

Not bad but not great. I agree with other reviewers that the flavor was a bit bland. However, the texture was nice. I think it needs a combination of more spices. More nutmeg? Cardamom? More nuts?? Something...I might make it again but fiddle with it.

I made mini loaves out of the recipe instead of 1 cake and they turned out good.

I agree with the other reviewer. All ingredients should have led to a spectacular coffee cake. I baked it 7 additional minutes and still it sunk in the middle and did not get done. I won't make this again.

Yes, it was moist and I liked the texture of the cake, but I was dissapointed in the flavor. Sunk a little in the center which spoils the presentation. Much much better cakes out there. Would not make again.

Great cake that's very moist. I'll probably add some cinnamon to the cake next time. It was slightly bland if you got a piece without the crunchy streusel. I will for sure make it again though!

This is a delicious cake. The most difficult part is finding a 9X9X2 inch pan....I used an 8 inch which made it too thick to cut nicely. Will make it again when I have the proper pan.
