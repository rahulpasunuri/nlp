Incredibly good! My mouth is watering thinking about making these again. The only question in my mind (and I noticed some other reviewers alluded to this), I would try these next time without the prosciutto. The 2 strong flavors that really come through are the smoked Gouda and the caramelized onions. I will make some with and without and compare.

I have been making this recipe for years. It is wonderful. I serve mine beside a dish of marmalade thinned with a little water. It is the perfect accompaniment. Not so strong it covers up the flavors, but definitely the prefect companion.

31/2 forks really. I made exactly according to recipe, and they were delicious. Next time I will double the onions...could eat them by themselves. Easy to make, too! Served with creme fraiche, guacamole, and salsa.

Soo good. Everyone at my party loved them. I prepped ahead of time and refrigerated until 15 minutes before everyone arrived then cooked on top of stove and placed in warm oven to keep warm and finish melting the cheese. Omitted prosciutto and butter in both steps. Another reviewer said to use crema mixed with some adobo sauce and I think I'll try that next time.

I should also mention, I have never made it with the prosciutto and it holds up amazingly without it.

I have made this for several parties with rave reviews, though it has evolved over time. I used a parrano cheese, and then a friend took that and added a drizzle of crema that she added some adobo sauce from a can of chipotle chiles, as well as a little bit of chipotle chile pureed in. Not a lot, but it gives it an awesome extra zing. This has been eaten up quickly at every party, and it's easy to make too!

Add thin slices of pear for an additional flavor combo! I make this all the time for parties and it's such a big HIT!

Very good. Use more onions, don't use more prosciutto than what the recipe calls for (too salty), and as a dip option (besides guac, salsa or spruced up sour cream), consider a honey BBQ sauce. You'll be happy.

This is my new "go to" appetizer recipe. It's great because you can make it an hour or so in advance and then just pop the quesadillas in the oven to rewarm. My guests RAVED... they were so delicious I was eating the leftovers totally cold. Will make these over and over!

Always a huge hit at any party. I have given this recipe out to so many people and I am always requested to bring it to a party. I usually make more caramelized onions and have made them ahead of time and heated them up in a 350 degree oven.

I'd been holding onto this recipe for over ten years and never bothered to try it until this holiday season. Boy, was I an idiot. Made it Xmas eve, and hubby and I were so blown away had to do a repeat performance for New Years. One note: there's enough fat on these that they really don't need to be pan-fried. We baked 'em for a bit longer than the recipe, flipping half way through to ensure crispiness. Can't wait to spring these on guests.

The flavors were great. I used reduced fat smoked gouda and it was still delicious. Oven a great way to keep them warm. Which is good - because they taste better hot.

Add one more rave review for this recipe. We're having a Superbowl party this weekend, so I tried this recipe out on my family. They loved it! I did leave out the prosciutto as we've got some vegetarians coming, but I can't imagine how it could taste any better than it did. Mmmmmm -- delicious.

I've made these more time than I can count for cocktail parties. I serve with a warm black bean salsa (just equal parts of canned black beans and salsa, heated). Always a hit. I carmalize onions and mix with cheese the night before, assemble and quickly fry and hour or so before party and then heat in oven as people arrive.

Thanks for all the great suggestions! Made these as one of many finger foods for a holiday open house. They were a huge hit. Made a second version minus the proscuitto adding in red pepper and mushrooms for the vegetarians in the group. Use a combination of smoked Gouda and a Chipotle Gouda which added a nice bit of spiciness. Loved that these could be made in advance and baked when ready. Will definitely be making these many more times.

I've made this dish many times and love it. However, I find it hard when/if i cook it for a dinner party because i need to be in the kitchen right up until i serve them. Has anyone made this in advance (an hour or so) and then reheated when the guests come, all at once? Ideas? suggestions? Thanks.

Delicious; a definate keeper. One tip - since I find oven-cooking dries out the tortillas, I cook them in non-stick pan lightly coated with oil.

These were terrific. I used regular vinegar, what was on hand, and they were very tasty.I also used sharp cheddar (again,on hand)instead of smoked gouda.I'm sure the gouda would have been even better! Guests LOVED this app!easy, easy easy! Prepped ahead of time.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I couldn't wait to try it. We had a summer cocktail party and I finished these up on the grill. . .unfortunately I didn't receive the "raves" everyone noted. They tasted good, but I don't think they set anyone's world on fire. Maybe their tastebuds were dulled from the previous course of hot wings and tequila. . . Oh, well. I'll try again!

Rating: 4
I make this appetizer all the time, and everyone raves. I never use prosciutto, and always use an extra vidalia onion. Twenty-five minutes to caramelize is exactly right. This is a good make-ahead dish. You can put it in the oven when the first guests arrive.

Rating: 3
I had some friends over last night for a little happy hour, and I made these quesadillas along with quacamole and homemade margaritas. There was not a single quesadilla left...they were really delicious. I skipped the frying pan part and just popped them in the oven for about 12 minutes or so. Any smoked cheese would probably be good -- maybe next time I'll throw in some smoked cheddar too. Don't skip the prosciutto. The saltiness is really tasty!!

Rating: 3
I found that if you use vidalia onions and a good beer, the onions don't need sugar or vinegar or butter even. This recipe lends itself to shortcuts that are just as good as the original recipe - use the pre-sliced gouda and small flour tortillas about the same size, so putting it all together is very simple. My friends asked for the recipe over and over!

I did enjoy this recipe, especially for it's flavors and ease. The only thing I did not like, and I'm sure only a matter of preference, was the sweet taste of the onions.

Perfect finger-pickins for football parties and easily adaptable for other fillings.

On my second round, I made everything up assembly line, skipped the pan fry step, butter brushed the tortillas and put them straight under the broiler. Saved alot of time and they were still wonderful. The caramelized onions are the clincher here. Had some leftover chopped applewood smoked bacon, and used that. Big, big hit. Highly recommend this for appetizers or quick snack. Also had guests using cheese fondue over these (ro-tel tomato/chile mix)gave it a little kick.

Amazing! Such a simple combination but the flavors were perfect together. I actually didn't even use the brown sugar and vinegar--just carmalized the onions in butter--but it was fantastic still.

This is without a doubt some of the best food I've ever tasted. We don't eat meat so I omitted the prosciutto. I used 2 large sweet onions instead of one onion which the recipe calls for.

This is a fabulous recipe! I used regular gouda and sliced shallots (but not nearly enough shallots!) The flavor is wonderful.

Sooo good, and easy to make. The smoked gouda, prosciutto and caramelized onions all complemented one another perfectly. Before using chicken or flavored tortillas or making any other substitutions as others have suggested, I highly recommend trying it as advertised first. Either that or make two batches. This recipe has a distinct, smoked flavor -- don't knock it before you try it. Also, pay attention and let the onions cool as directed. I didn't make time for this and the filling came out of the oven too hot to enjoy at first. And use lots of cheese!

Rating: 4
The best appetizer I have ever made. My family always elects me to make the appetizer at gathering now and I have to make this one. I found it is easier and quicker to assemble when you use a cheese plane and layer thin slices of gouda. I also have the deli shave the prosciutto and put pieces of deli tissue between them so that they do not become a stuck together lump. I can easily put them on top of the slices of gouda and it is so much faster. They are wonderful.

I love these quesadillas. I'm a big fan of caramelized onions, so I used 5 onions for 4 quesdadillas using the extra large tortillas. The onions cook down so much. I also brush both tortillas with a light coating of a smokey BBQ sauce. Gives it a tang--that was a good tip. I brush a very light coating of butter on the quesadilla, broil carefully, flip over, do the same to the other side, and they're done! They're also delicious cold, if they last that long.

Rating: 3
Pretty good, although the caramelized onions tasted a little sweet for me. Next time, I might try omitting the white wine vinegar or reduce the amount of brown sugar. Also, I made a double batch of these, so I was intimidated by the amount of cheese I'd have to use (3 cups!). I grated the Gouda on one of those new foot-long zesters that looks like a ruler with a handle attached -- piece of cake. Made my job much easier.

This dish was an absolute hit - both as a starter course and an an entree with a salad. I made the onions ahead of time and let them set, covered, at room temperature and used crisp bacon rather than proscuitto. They don't need any sour cream, salsa, or other trimmings - delicious on their own!! I may try minced grilled chicken with the gouda and onions next. Very adaptable!

Well, here's another review. We all loved these. I made them with mozzarella since someone was worried that they didn't like the smoked gouda and they were still great. I made lots of onions and used balsamic which sweetened them up a bit. I even made the onions a day in advance. I served them with just a bit of diced tomatoes on the plate to add some color but they didn't really need it for the taste. They're on the menu again for this weekend...with gouda. Enjoy!

Great recipe but I agree that you could use more onions. They disappeared quickly at our party and several people asked for the recipe.

We're from the Land of Enchantment (New Mexico) and this was blah for us. The smoked gouda is a must, and New Mexico (hot) green chile would be a welcome addition. Crispy smoked bacon would be better instead of prosciutto. Prosciutto doesn't have much flavor. Next time I will add fresh cilantro.

This recipe is a 10! I make these all the time when I have people over. 3 wonderful flavors really come out in this recipe. I would suggest that you double the amount of onions you use because they they tend to shrink when you make them.

I decided to make this dish when I saw all the reviews on it, and I was happy I did! Great flavor- the smokiness of the Gouda cheese matched perfectly with the sweetness of the onions. Very, very good.

You don't really need another review of this recipe, but, what the heck -- here is my variation. I skip the prociutto and substitute barbecue sauce which adds to the smoky flavor. I have been making this for years and it is always a favorite at cocktail parties (at which I serve many more formal appetizers!).

Our local supermarket did not have smoked gouda, so I used regular gouda - it was still very good, but I'd like to try the smoked version. I found the recipe to be a little more time consuming than some have described, but still not too bad. Gouda is a very soft cheese to grate, so you might want to freeze it for a short time to harden it a bit for easier grating. Will definitely make it again for a party or watching a ball game.

These quesadillas were unbelievable. Made them for appetizer for a fiesta bash. Doubled the recipe and they were devoured. Everybody loved them. This is definitely a keeper!

Everyone loved these quesadillas. It was a very easy recipe and I made double what the recipe called for and thought I should have made more. I made lots of carmelized onions since they were eaten before I even used them for the quesadillas. I took the advice from another review and made them ahead of time and heated them up when I got to the party.

I too made this for a Super Bowl party and it was a big hit. They were gone as soon as I put the plate down. And so easy to make!

I made this for Superbowl Sunday and got rave reviews from adults and kids alike. It was very easy to make and not too time consuming. This will definitely be one of my often served appetizers.

I have made this several times with rave reviews from all (adults and kids too!). At my Christmas party this past year, guests ate them off the cookie sheet before the final oven heating step. At a Super Bowl party over the weekend, I made these (per the request of the party hostess) making a "kids version" substituting the gouda for american cheese, minus the onions. The kids perferred the "adult version" these are so great. What I love about this recipe is that you can make/prepare all the components ahead several days and then just assemble prior to eating. By the way, I brought these to the Super Bowl party, on a foil cookie sheet after the pan browning step. We just popped them in the oven when we were ready for them.

This recipe is terrific as it is. But my wife and I also enjoy it (minus the tortillas) baked on regular pizza dough. We make various individual-sized (and topped) pizzas and this combination of toppings makes a very delicious little (or big!) pizza. Like the other reviewers have said, there is never enough of this one -- we end up fighting over who gets the last piece!

We love these quesadillas, but prefer to substitute other cheeses for the smoked gouda. We also cook our quesadillas in a frying pan with no oil instead of the oven. I have trouble getting the onions into the quesadillas as they often get eaten as soon as they are made. I've used the onions in pastas, too.

Excellent-Everyone loves it and requests the recipe every time I make it. I can barely put the plate down before it is emptied. Easy,too.

Very good and very easy. I felt strange serving it without a sauce but I couldn't think of anything that wouldn't overwhelm the great flavor of the dish. Any suggestions?

Served as a main dish minus the prosciutto with a vegetable salad and there was nothing leftover! Subtle sweet cheese taste, different and excellent.

Tried on the inlaws and everyone loved it. The overall vote was MUST use the prosciutto!

My guests and family loved it. They couldn't stop eating them and were almost too full for dinner. It makes a great appetizer or a light lunch.

DELICIOUS! I skipped the prosciutto for vegetarian friends and didn't miss a thing. I also used tomato and spinach tortillas for added color and flavor.

The only problem with this recipe is that no matter how many you make, there are never enough!

To store: wax or foil wrap, in tupperware. They travel really well. I served them at room temp at a picnic and they were legendary. Try the prosciutto next time. trust me.

I made this as one of the appetizers for Christmas this past year and everyone loved it!! I actually had to go back and make more! Thanks!!

I made this dish as an appetizer for a Mexican meal for guests and now whenever they visit they request them. The combination of flavors is unusual and truly mouth-watering. I left out the Prosciutto because it just didn't seem right to me and they certainly did not seem to be lacking anything! Tip - make more than you think you'll need they go like hotcakes.
