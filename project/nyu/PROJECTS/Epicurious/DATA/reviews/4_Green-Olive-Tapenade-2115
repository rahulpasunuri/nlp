I made this on the spur of the moment, so I didn't have capers. I subbed a small amount of pickled jalapeno and left out the cayenne. Lick the spoon good. The lemon really makes the difference in giving it a bright, clean taste.

This tapenade is delicious. I used black olives instead of greem but it didn't matter - it was great. I grilled nan bread on the BBQ, topped it with the tapenade, chopped tomatoes and grated asiago cheese. Served this as an appetizer to rave reviews.

I've made this recipe many times and always get raves. I use the green olives marinated in garlic from Whole Foods olive bar and eliminate the added garlic. I don't notice any anchovy aftertaste. I puree it because I find it annoying to try spreading chunky substances on toasted bread. I like the smooth texture.

Good basic recipe - I used Spanish Manzilla olives and subbed 1T anchovy paste for the anchovy fillets. I also added Italian parsley and smoked paprika to offset the saltiness.

Made with half black olives. Loved it! If you like Tapenade, you'll love this. Easy! Did notice a little too strong of anchovy after taste. I think I will try with half the anchovies next time. Still, very good!

I LOVED this recipe! My kids even ate it. It was very similar to a tapenade that I spent 8 bucks on (for a very small jar) at a gourmet shop. I did, however, mix green and black olives and chopped the olives finely instead of pureeing. It's just a texture thing for me. I couldn't stop eating it! Yummmm.

I've probably made this Tapenade a hundred times. It's so easy and it can be made far ahead. I love anchovies, but even people who claim to hate them gobble this up.

Excellent recipe, however I did not puree the ingredients. I processed them until they were finely chopped. I think it looks more appealing that way rather than a green paste

This tapenade is a hit with my friends and husband. The friend, a green olive lover, can't stand capers, nor anchovies, but she made the recipe and shared it with her co-workers who love it. Mix it before serving as the anchovie taste floats to the top.

Was good but would do a black olive version next time. Has an after taste from the anchovies that might not be noticed if a second and third course followed.
