I made this for the holidays - recommend making it the day before, let it cool and then have your butcher slice it the next day and put it back in all the juices and reheat for dinner. Two family members that refuse to eat brisket loved this. It's sweet, so if you don't like sweet meat your out of luck, but it's juicy and amazing.

This brisket tasted like it had been cooked in prunes. It sounded pretty bad but I trusted the other reviewers. Stupidly, I thought, maybe it would taste like something different. No, it tasted like prune-flavored meat. It might as well have been marinated in Dr. Pepper.

Yummy! I used black cherry juice in place of wine since I don't drink.

This was very good and frankly, the first success I've had with a brisket. Found I didn't have a lot of liquid left for sauce which ended up being rather thick, though tasty. More like a compote. Would thin it out in the future.

Aaaah-mazing. I made this for Rosh Hashanah last year, and it was extraordinary AND easy. When my mother-in-law came into the kitchen before dinner, she told me that my father-in-law doesn't eat brisket. He had seconds.

oh I forgot to mention... if you are reheating your brisket after refrigerating it (sliced and draped with sauce), just reheat it for 10 minutes or until warm, at 350. The recipe says 30 minutes at 350, and that is just a recipe for drying out you meat.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. I'm a chef, and made this for a catered passover dinner. It was good but not excellent. Though it was tender, it wasn't juicy and flavorful. First if i made it again, I would cook it at a lower temp for a longer period, like how they cook brisket low and slow in texas. 250 degrees for 4+ hours or until fork tender. Next, I would NOT increase the liquid as many reviewers seemed to suggest. You don't want to poach the meat, braising liquids should just go 1/4 to 1/2 way up the meat. Lastly, I would not remove all the fat from the top of the meat, leave about 1/4-1/8 inch on there because the fat imparts flavor. Once the meat is done and has been cooled, you can cut that top fat layer off if you like. The sauce was jut ok, not excellent, but i have a pretty hight standard since I'm being paid to prepare this for my clients.

Most delicious beef brisket, I've ever made or tasted.Use recipe with no changes. Only regret is disgarding cooked prunes.

I made this two years ago and it was a HUGE it. There were no left overs and the kids talked about it for a year. I made it again last year and doubled the recipe. Still no left overs. Going for triple this year. Look no further. This recipe is outstanding.

Amazing dinner. As reviewers before my said it was a bit dry, i too modified the recipe, doubling the canned whole tomatoes and tripling or quadrupling the wine. The wine and tomatoe added so much flavor in the finished product. I made the day before and then heated on Christmas day. Everyone loved it.

I made this about a year ago for 70 people at a sadder dinner my church was having. It was interesting for me to come up with a traditional menu but I didn't have to be kosher. This recipe was the biggest hit ( no left overs) and I loved it because I made it ahead and then just had to reheat. Not only was it easy but it freed me up at the last minute for other things. Don't be put off by the time it takes to make. You can spread some of the chores out ( chop your veggies ahead) and then just pop everything into a pot and do something else. I don't really think that you have to puree the sauce. By the time you've cooked it is pretty much mush. I think doing it ahead is actually best. This is the sort of dish that gets better if allowed to sit and your meat cuts better if its cool. I came back to this recipe for another large group I will be serving soon. I may go with a different cut of meat to keep costs down but anything that needs braising will work. I remember when brisket was a cheap cut.

This is the best brisket recipe ever! I pureed the veggies and some prunes right in the pan! A bit more thyme and a touch more balsamic at the end was need but otherwise perfect! I agree with other reviewers tht this should be made a few days early, and sliced with sauce around it to really get the flavor. Delicious!!

Very, very good. I made it with dried figs instead of prunes, since that's what I had on hand, and it was lovely. Perfect balance of sweet/savoury. Also cooked it at 275 for 4.5 hours. Great dish.

This is really 3.5 forks. It's a decent amount of work up front but the end product really is delicious (and it makes a ton of food.) Definitely gets better with age, glad I took the suggestion to make it the night before - the juices definitely soaked in with time, making the final product more delicious! Next time I will either add more salt or heed other reviewers' advice to add chicken/beef stock and it will be four forks!

Absolutely delicious. I doubled the ingredients for the gravy. Other than that I followed the recipe.

I also found it good but dry -- and I cooked it in an oven bag that keeps all the moisture in. I would almost double the liquid ingredients. In addition, it was much better the next day.

This is easy and delicious - and has become our favorite brisket recipe. My husband wasn't crazy about the gravy and I think it would have been better without the additional balsamic vinegar. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't want to buy a large container of prune juice so substituted a 2.5 oz. container of Gerber organic prunes and a little water. We'll definitely have this again!

I added a bit more liquid, but may have been since the foil was a little loose the sauce was a touch on the dry side. The key to making this is to let it cool after cooking slicing it and adding it back to the sauce, then slowly reheat it all in the oven, yes, a little time consuming but well worth it. Also I added the zest of an orange to brighten the flavor a bit I also think a little clove and slight touch of cinnamon would also elevate the sauce a bit.

Super deliciuos. I made a mistake and added red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, then added a little more balsamic, it still tasted amazing. I used an immersion blender to chop half of onions/prunes/garlic/carrot mixture, and kept half intact. I thinly sliced the brisket and put it back into the sauce - it received raved reviews, even from several little children.

I made this for Passover seder and it was absolutely delicious. Not too sweet, nice balance of flavors. I doubled the recipe for 8 lbs of brisket but added extra thyme. There wasn't really enough liquid left at the end to make a good sauce, so I added some additional beef broth. Everyone raved - no one could believe it was made with wine and prune juice!

This was wonderful, I made it for Christmas dinner and will definately make it again. I even screwed it up a bit and had to wing it at the end (long story) and it still turned out amazing. The flavors of the onions, carrots, garlic and prunes were robust and rich, and complemented the brisket to perfection.I used an immersion blender as others recommended, worked out great with some of the veggies pureed and some whole. Overall, took a long time to make, though not difficult, and completely worth it. Yum!!!

Excellent. Great make ahead dish. Rich and wonderful. I reheated the briset, then sliced it and poured the sauce around it. Served it with challah, creamed spinach, and roasted russet and sweet potatoes. Joining weight watchers tomorrow!

The whole family loved it, and my 4- year old son even told me, "Daddy, I LOVE the meat." I don't believe he's ever said that about meat before. Incredibly tender, and the prunes really add to the dish. By the way, we used Cabernet instead of Merlot and it was just fine.

I made this roast for the weekend. I used a french roast (sometimes called a brick roast or delmonico roast). Everyone said that it was delicious and was melt in your mouth soft. It was easy to prepare and I would definitely make it again.

Great brisket! I actually made enough for a 12 person Seder and began about 3 days prior. Consequently, I wasnt able to host Sedar (got sick!) but packaged dinner up the following day for family and friends. They loved it! And still I had leftovers to freeze. Equally excellent when reheated - brisket was tender and juicy.

I'm not the biggest brisket fan, but for brisket, this was a good recipe. A bit time consuming. I'm not sure why we needed to add the last drop of balsamic vinegar and prune juice at the end...did it really add anything?

I did not know brisket could taste this good! great recipe! I just poured the pureed vegetables and sauce over the meat directly, rubbing it in between the slices. Less time and was still amazing!

I'm no brisket expert but this was the best recipe I've come across. Looks like more fuss than it really is. After cooking, refrigerate. When ready to slice, the unneeded fat lifts right out in chunks.

This was a very time consuming receipe, and fo r that reason I don't think I would make it often. It is delicious. The prunes turn nice and jammy. I only had one large pan that i can use stove top to oven, and that worked. the meat did shrink a lot. I was not exact with my wine and prune juice measurements, but seemed fine. I used my immersian blender, that I tented with foil, and that seemed easier then using a food processor.

Served this at a seder for 18 people. (I made two briskets, about 50 % more, and served a second entrée; I had leftovers.) It was delicious, and not hard to make. There is a LOT of juice and accompanying vegetables, so be sure to serve something else that is good with the juice. I made the potato, carrot and zucchini kugel, from this website, and the combo was great.

Hands down the best and most moist brisket yet...My guest ranged from 7 to 65 and they all loved it. Definitely make the night before.

Best brisket I've ever made because of the richness of the sauce and the tenderness of the meat. I followed the recipe though used a much bigger brisket (6 1/2#) but still kept the same proportion of balance of ingredients. Consequently I cooked 4 1/2 hours making sure the center of brisket was tender by inserting a metal pin like recipe suggested. I trimmed as much fat as I could before browning so sauce was not fatty at all. The flavor was excellent and the meat was extremely tender. I would definitely make again, even with the extra prep required.

"Wow" is all I can say- this was such a wonderful brisket! The flavors were incredible and the meat was so tender. I streamlined the recipe a bit. I pan-seared the brisket, loaded everything into the roasting pan, cooked for 3.5 hours and let it sit for about an hour at room temp. I re-warmed it for about 20 minutes in the oven, then sliced it and just spooned the wonderful mixture of sauce that was in the pan over the sliced meat as I served it. I don't think the extra steps of pureeing some of the sauce is necessary. It also keeps the clean-up to one roasting pan. Definitely a keeper!

This is the best brisket recipe that I have made in a long time. Very labor intensive but fabulous. I added about 1 Tbs of Tabasco sauce to the diced tomatoes and used 2 cans but only used the liquid from one can. I cooked the garlic cloves for an hour prior to adding to the brisket. Added much more thyme with the "twigs" which you remove easily at the end. I also removed all 16 whole garlic cloves after the cooling of the dish so that the garlic doesn't overwhelm the dish. In addition, I used a 15 year old Balsamic vinegar to give more flavor. It was cooked perfectly in my convection oven after 3.5 hours. This will become a recipe that I use for other holidays and not just Passover. I prepped all the veggies ahead with a mandolin instead of my food processor. Also used a blender and the not processor for the cup of vegetables and the sauce minus the prunes at the end which makes for an easier clean up. This brisket is going to be a huge hit with my guests for Seder this year.

This recipe highlights some of my personal favorite flavors. The only thing that I changed was to add the Squid to the sauce last so that I could control it's cooking time. Calamari is so sensitive and takes little time to cook. I did this so that it wouldn't become tough.

I followed this recipe exactly and my dinner guests were astounded at how tender the brisket was. I did not trim any fat from the brisket and it added to its tenderness. Next time I may use slightly less onions but this recipe is superb!
