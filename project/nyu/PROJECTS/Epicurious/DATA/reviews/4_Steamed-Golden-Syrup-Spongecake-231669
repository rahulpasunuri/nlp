Absolutely and unequivocally delicious! It's a beautiful combination of comfort food and complete decadence. I made this exactly as written with the exception of using gluten free flour (plus 1 tsp baking powder per 3/4 cup flour). It did not rise as much as I had expected, but it is possible that the GF flour was the issue (it sometimes is). Nevertheless, the texture was amazing (very tender and moist without being mushy), and the addition of cream and Lyle's Golden Syrup allow one to customize it to one's own preference. I will absolutely make this again (particularly as my husband has already started pestering me for another one).

I made this with white whole wheat flour (with extra salt and a little baking soda added) to substitute for the self-rising flour, and a stick of SmartBalance 50/50 butter blend to substitute for the butter; I used a fraction of the cream to drizzle, as well, and served with chopped mango along with the syrup. I must say the recipe is extremely adaptable! It tasted lovely - not too sweet, and astonishingly moist and flavorful. Really, it was out of the ordinary but pleasing to all.

Three words came out of our mouths when we tried this - Oh my God! My husband and I made this for Thanksgiving dessert, and it had completely "disappeared" within an hour of serving. That is surprising in our house because we don't enjoy sweet foods nearly as much as we enjoy our savory ones. This was by far the perfect dessert for us, and will be a part of our favorite recipe collection from here on out.

Having just returned from a holiday in England and enjoying this dessert in a pub in Warwickshire, I have to say that this is exactly what we enjoyed at the Racehorse in Warwickshire. Hubby was delighted that we were able to duplicate this delicious dessert at home!

Really wonderful flavor! Golden syrup is definitely food of the gods. It's simple to make and have ready for the end of a dinner party. Serving with a bit of creme anglaise or classic Bird's custard mix finishes things off very nicely.

Ambrosia! The essence of British comfort food! The whole world should try it at least once. I've eaten French, Italian, Chinese, Thai, Indian, et alia! Treacle pud rocks!!
