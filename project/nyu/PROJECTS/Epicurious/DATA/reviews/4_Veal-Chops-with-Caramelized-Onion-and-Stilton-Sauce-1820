Exceptional dish. Even my husband, who does not like veal, loved it. I also used gorgonzola because that's what I had in my freezer, and frozen gorgonzola is easy to crumble or cut into tiny cubes. The onions only took 10 minutes to caramelize.

We had this last night; I prepared it exactly according to the recipe and it was fantastic! I especially like the sauce - the currants, onions and stilton make a wonderful combination. The caramelized onion mixture can be made 1-2 hours ahead - makes it easier to put on at dinner time.

Loved the sauce! I halved it for 2; used Stella Gorgonzola instead of Stilton and it was lovely; very mellow. I did not have no salt beef broth - made mine from Minor's Beef Base (available BJ's Warehouse Club)and used little salt in the rest of the recipe. My chops were about 2" thick and took forever to cook stovetop; will grill next time. Used about 1/3 each sherry vinegar, good Balsamic vinegar and Sherry to make 2 TbS. Used a little of it in the currant/onion mix to soften the dried currants. Definitely would NOT omit currants. Since it was just me and my husband we had pkg'd butter noodles with the chops, but I think a nice polenta would go well with this. It took me a long time to get this to the table - probably because the chops took so long. With better planning, I'd try this for company.

When I made this, I decided not to add the currants and then forgot to do the step with the sherry vinegar and butter and it was still delicious! Will definitely make again but omit the currants. Also, I used Maytag blue because that was what I had. Next time I"ll try the Stilton.

Sauce is wonderful! Hubby didn't like the craisins I used for the fruit. I did, but I think one can omit the fruit. We grilled the chops over mesquite then topped them with the sauce. I used a large Vidalia onion. It needs to be large, as one other reviewer pointed out.

I have prepared this dish twice and will definitely do so again. I have not used Gorgonzola, but have used blue cheese instead (French or Danish or a combination). I think Gorgonzola might well overpower, especially if too much is sprinkled over the top, rather than incorporated into the sauce. I used veal demiglas in place of the beef broth (1 tsp Williams Sonoma veal demi glace to 1 c water). Other that the broth and the cheese, I followed the recipe. I would suggest not putting too much crumbled cheese over the sauce-chop, and let people add more if they desire. I found the veal flavor to come through very nicely. It is a very, very good dish. My only sides were steamed asparagus and a tossed salad. A Pinot Gris or Cote de Rhone pairs nicely.

Can't wait to make it again

I loved this dish. The sauce has a nice smooth cheese flavor that is not overwhelming and mixes nicely with the sherry. I followed the recipie exactly except that I used actual sherry instead of sherry vinegar. Highly recommended.

Wow, what a way to wreck a good and very pricey piece of meat. This sauce, while good on its own, totally overwhelmed the veal. The sauce would be good on mashed potatoes or possibly asparagus I think. I actually think the veal would have been better just served with crumbled bleu cheese, figs and carmelized onions. And, I would DEFINITELY NOT saute the meat. That's just a cruel treatment to something that has to be reasonably cooked through. I say 1 fork here in the actual definition of just so-so. It is not inedible, but I will NEVER make it again, nor any other sauce like this for a meat (I've tried several, and they always overwhelm good meat). And, lest this be construed as poor execution, I went to culinary school, so I promise I did it right :)

Served at a dinner party of 12 w/ Chimney Rock cabernet. Delicious and easy to prepare for a group. Side dishes were broccoli rabe (the bitter flavor was a good contrast to the rich veal/cheese) & polenta (the mild flavor was a good foil for meat).

Have been making this recipe for some time but usually substitute beef steak. Usually just mix all the onions together. Sometimes don't bother puree-ing it in batches - but its better that way. I cut down on the butter and cheese too. Just scrumptious!

Excellent. Used Danish Blue and 1 in. chops. Would serve to guests is I could afford the veal.

I usually find the blandness of veal chops not worth the price. They were on sale, so I tossed them in the basket and found this recipe. Wow! I used Gorgonzola and was afraid the taste would be too powerful. It was perfect. Next veal sale, I'l do an encore.

The absolute best veal chop recipe I have ever made. I used 2" chops pan-grilled for about 8 minutes per side. The sauce is superb exactly as is.

one more thing, I used white wine vinegar instead of sherry wine since I didnt have it on hand- really an easy dish to make!

Rating: 4
Would I make this again?? Absolutely- it is by far the best veal chop recipe I have tried, and really this tastes like a professional chef (ahem, not tooting my horn here) made this. I only had gorgonzola so I used that instead of stilton. I also halved the recipe since it was only me and my husband, had plenty of sauce though for each chop and even some left over. Will be on my monthly rotation!

I broiled the veal chops, but the sauce was perfect.

Very good. Didn't have sherry wine vinegar so I used a mix of balsamic and sherry. My wife didn't like working with the chop so I may try cutlets or beef.

This is a wonderful dish - very elegant. I wouldn't change a thing.

Very company worthy. Sauce is special albeit a little rich. Used less vinegar (balsamic instead) and a little. Served it with fine french beans panfried in a bit of bacon drippings and some boiled new potatoes. Lovely!

My husband and I have made this entree on many occasions, including this New Year's Eve and for several wine tastings. Each time, it has been a success, and I find that you learn more about how to perfect the recipe each time it is made. I do have to say that the sauce is very rich, so keep that in mind when choosing your side dishes. We served it with the stuffed zucchini (from this website-excellent!) and a four cheese risotto. The risotto was good by itself but was a little too strong to pair with this dish, as there was blue cheese in the risotto, also. So, if someone did not like blue cheese, they were in trouble! I would instead just do a simple parmesan risotto or some garlic mashers. A good zinfandel or complex cabernet pairs nicely and stands up to the rich sauce! Enjoy!

I really loved this recipe. I used gorgonzola; saga blue would've been better (creamier). I also used dried cranberries instead of currants. Very elegant and easy.

Fabulous! Definitely company worthy. I made this for 2 but suggest doubling the onions. Great recipe just as written.I didn't have unsalted beef broth on hand so I used bouillion which is typically salty. I just didn't add additional salt - it was great. I served it with a Butternut Squash Risotto recipe from this site.

This made for a very impressive meal and very rich for my gourmet group! You can make the sauce ahead of time so you can spend time with your guests. I served it with extra thick 1 1/2 in. grilled veal chops and I used extra large onions. Definitely do this again!

This was a great quick mid-week supper! I omitted the currents and used red wine instead of vinegar. I would make for guests too! THe secret is to get great chops from your butcher!

Chops were excellent. Would definitely make again. We used 1 inch chops and can't imagine having used 1/2 inch chops given the richness of the sauce as a result of the stilton. Served with a BIG cab and risotto. A great meal for a special night!

Loved this. I used Mayan sweet onions, eliminated the dried currants and added the juices from the standing veal chops to the final sauce.

Nice dish but wouldn't make it again... the sauce is excellent but it overwhelmed the flavor of the veal. Also the overall flavor of the dish is fairly sweet -- so make sure you or your guests like that before serving!

This meal is a real showstopper! I used it for my Christmas meal as the fifth course of a six course meal and everyone cleaned their plates!! Best served with a Hearty Red Zin

Outstanding! Easy to make and presentation great for company dish. Better with 1" thick chops and increase cooking time by a few minutes. Make sure onions are jumbo or you won't have enough to top chops. Can substitute chopped raisins for currants if you can't find.
