You just have to be extra carefull, if there is air in the dough, it will burst when fryed. Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Serve with doce de leite (dulce de leche).

Should have heed advise of the other reviewers. Both my hands got burned from the hot oil that splattered when one of the churros burst. I was very careful but still i got hurt. Please take this recipe down before more people get hurt trying it.

This recipe also caused burn injuries to myself and a friend as we were making it. PLEASE TAKE IT DOWN! It is very dangerous, and messy, if something goes wrong, and we do not want others to have to go through what we did.

I had the same problem as the previous reviewer, one of the churros bursted and spattered hot oil all over me and the kitchen. I ended up in hospital, luckily with only superficial burns. Anyway the churros that caused the problem had split in half and was completely hollow inside. Seems that air expanded and caused bursting, but why I don't know. Any scientific mind out there would care to elaborate????

I don't know what happened, but I followed the directions and one of the churros burst while it was frying and shot hot oil out all over the kitchen and onto my hands, arms, and face. On the bright side, they did taste good.

I did not have a churrera, so I did not use one. I simply cut the tip of a Ziploc bag. The first few I made were too gooey inside, so cut a smaller hole in the other side of the bag. The outside was really delicious and crispy. I tossed them with cinnimon sugar.

This is a great recipe! The churros come out very crispy on the outside and a dream of softness on the inside. You can use a pastry bag to make this, although you run the risk of burning your hands. Wrap the bag in a thick towel and secure, and make sure to serve these immediately. Enjoy!
