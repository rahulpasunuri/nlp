This is the second year I made these. Last year I omitted the almonds and they were just okay. This year (again omitting the almonds) I used 4oz. Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate bar + 2oz Trader Joe dark chocolate baking bar (says about 56% cocoa). Chopped the chocolate into nib sized pieces rather than finely chopped. This gave it a much needed bite, and yielded a nice sweet/bitter flavor. Only got 48 cookies out of this. I got many rave reviews for this version. This was definitely much better and will use this version again for a nut-free receipe.

Excellent cookie for adults - I followed the recipe, but did a 50/50 semi/bitter sweet chocolate split. The hardest part was chopping up the chocolate. One thing: I don't think the cookies need as much powdered sugar on them as pictured...they're excellent without nearly as much, and not nearly as messy.

These are the perfect chocolate addition to my Christmas cookie baking assortment. However, I was only able to get 3 dozen cookies from the recipe. Roll the edges of the cookies in the confectioners sugar when coating.

Perfection!! These cookies couldn't have turned out any better. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. They have a cake-like consistency that just melts in your mouth. The combination of cocoa powder and bittersweet chocolate give them a good balance of flavor that isn't too sweet. And the almonds add some texture as well as a nice crunch. Overall, a well-rounded cookie that will satisfy any chocolate lovers' cravings. Absolutely delicious!!

We loved these! They have a very European flavor and texture; deep chocolate and mildly sweet, a little dry and crumbly, and a little crisp. I think this may be why some don't appear to care for them. If you don't like true shortbread cookies, old-fashioned crispy cookies, or require a sugar overload, you probably won't like these. If you're a cookie maniac, you're going to love them!

Seriously, these are amazing. I used regular unsweetened cocoa powder with no issues. Also used 70% Lindt chocolate bars. Annoyed to have to chop the nuts by hand, but it's a small price to pay for such an incredible cookie. My new favorite. And I won't wait around for Christmas to make them again.

Some of the negative reviews almost stopped me from making these, but I soldiered on and am SO glad I did! They're fabulous and dark, deep chocolatey. My cocoa wasn't Dutch-process, but it doesn't seem to have harmed these delicious cookies.

not your typical cocolate cookie--a dry powdery bittersweet/almost salty treat. very crumbly, and interesting, but not for everyone.

Just made these cookies, skipping the sugar-coating step (have children in the house) and using cacao nibs in place of nuts and chocolate bits. Delicious. The cookies are delicate and well-balanced, not too sweet or intense, and the nibs add a bit of much-needed texture.

These taste exactly how they sound, "bittersweet chocolate cookies." Not sure why the reviews have been so/so, because my cookies turned out great. I substituted the almonds with pecans because it was what I had on hand, but the pecans worked well with the recipe. Next time I make these I think I will add a teaspoon of grated orange zest... nothing better than a dark chocolate/orange combo. Note: I made these smaller and thicker than what the recipe called for, and had to double my cooking time.

These cookies were disapointing. I used good chocolate and organic cocoa. I thought they were dry and not terribly flavorful. I made 5 different cookies for Christmas this year and these were duds. I followed the recipe, so I'm not sure what I'm missing.

Like some reviewers, my cookies didn't crack nor did they spread much. I'm wondering if the recipe actually calls for baking soda, not powder. I'd try that next time.

Easy but very good. Hazlenut and chocolate are always a good combination. I don't that I'd substitute other nuts in this one, though I did once add a few drops of orange oil for a very subtle citrus note, and that was quite good, too. I make them every year now with the rest of the Christmas cookies.

This is an extraordinarily easy cookie to make with delicious results. Perfect for something small and chocolate after a big meal. Beautiful to serve, goes well with an appropriate red wine. I had expected these to be crisp, but realized my error was interpreting the epicurious.com description of "crunchy" incorrectly. These cookies have a more cake-like texture. The crunch must refer to the addition of nuts. Finally, I don't know why the nuts can't be chopped in a food processor. I did it and they were fine. Enjoy!

This was fantastic - light, bitter, chocolatey and not too sweet, which I like. I made the following changes: (1) Used whole wheat cake flour (2) did not make an effort to get the chocolate pieces too fine (3) used 72% cacao semi-sweet chocolate (4) cooked for 15 minutes. None of that was based on strategy - just what I had in the house/cooking speed of my oven. My wife, who doesn't usually like cookies, thought these were great and my 3 year old son (who helped) liked them better than his usual favorite double chocolate cookie.

I adore this recipe, and so does everyone who eats them. I chop up a little extra chocolate and use hazelnuts.

First time making these & they are truly some of the best cookies I've ever had! And they are easy! Perfect for chocolate lovers & non-chocolate lovers alike as the flavor is subtle; very similar taste as the chocolate souffle' recipe from Gourmet that can be found on this site. I used a high-end cocoa powder, a few more bittersweet chips than the receipe called for, and omitted the nuts. These are also excellent with red wine.

Tasty, but nothing special. A little too "one note" for my taste, the flavor lacked complexity.

Wow, these cookies are amazing! I love to bake, and these are truly some of the best I have ever had. I didn't have unsweetened cocoa so I used a sweetened version, and cut the sugar amount in half. Another slight alteration: I was inspired, having recently tasted some salty Spanish chocolate, by the combination of chocolate with something salty. I added a bit of extra salt (about 1tsp) to this recipe, and the result was subtle but undeniable and delicious. My family members noticed it and were pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended!!

Great recipe. simple, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The great thing is they are not too sweet! I omitted the nuts (kids), and used a small dark chocolate bar and some mini chocolate chips. Its what I had on hand. I dipped the the cookie tops only, in the powdered suger after baking. Didn't even need that, but pretty.

I am a retired pastry chef . I did not think these cookies were not chocolate enough. They would have been better with an addition of some melted good quality chocolate in addition to the cocoa and the chopped chocolate. Coating with the powdered sugar prior to baking was a waste of time as the sugar simply melted. I did like the hazelnut addition. In the future I will use a favorite recipe of Maida Heatters and add the chocolate "chips" and hazelnuts. They are called Chocolate Aggies and are located in her Book of great Cookies. They have a great chocolate taste and have long been a favorite. Diane

Perfect for our chocolate and nut loving house. We skip the icing sugar entirely -- too messy, too sweet. Besides we don't want anything to cloak the intense chocolate flavour. We double the quantity of hazelnuts and toast them first (350°F for 12-15 min). We use an excellent grade of bittersweet chocolate, cutting it as fine as fine can be so that its flavour spreads evenly through the dough. After shaping the cookies, I bake a dozen up right away, and freeze the rest between sheets of wax paper. Whenever we have an ache for chocolate I pull out 6 and bake them in our toaster oven.

This cookie rocks! I think it's all in the chocolate. I used a good quality bittersweet chocolate and I could not stop eating them. I'm planning to make them for xmas give-aways. I recommend sifting the powdered sugar and toasting the hazelnuts. Definitely making these for years to come.

All I can say about these cookies is..yummmmmmm. I made these for my cookie gift baskets for Chirstmas '04, everyone I gave the baskets to requested the recipe after eating only one.

Used Bernard Callebaut chocolate, regular Baker's bittersweet chocolate and skipped the nuts (due to allergies in the family) and baked 3 minutes, turned cookie sheet and baked 3 minutes more. Decadent cookies! I think the key is not to over bake to ensure the cookie is soft and moist - take out just as they start to crack around the edges. You definitely require a glass of milk with this rich cookie!

Every year I bake at least one type of chocolate cookie for Christmas. This one is the best I have ever tried and will be on the list next year.

I make cookies all the time. A friend is leaving for graduate school and said, "The only thing I want before Ileave is a big basket of your homemade cookies." I thought I would try some new recipes to spice the basket up and chose several that have 4 forks, since I wanted tried and true. Long story short, I was definately disappointed in this recipe. Maybe it was me. Mine were pretty small, and tasted rather dry. I did bake them for ten minutes rather than eight since the tops didn't look "cracked". I am jealous that mine were not delicious like everyone else who made comments.

I'm in chocolate heaven! These are so tasty!! Easy too. To previous comment - there is no need to dirty a food processor, just quickly chop the chocolate. I might try adding a touch of Grand Marnier next time for a truly grown-up cookie!

This is sort of a brownie in cookie form. It's very tasty, but I'm not sure it's worth the trouble of chopping the hazelnuts by hand, dirtying the food processor for the chocolate, and coating twice in confectioners' sugar. I used 70% cocoa bittersweet chocolate, and it was slightly too bitter. A regular dark chocolate would have worked better. I would also reduce the salt by a bit. I don't like for chocolate desserts to be too salty. The recipe yielded three dozen cookies for me, and I stuck pretty closely to the recommended size. Overall, a good cookie, but not out of this world as I had hoped. The molasses crinkles in this same issue (December 2004) were much tastier and easier to make.

These were amazing and very easy. I also used chocolate chips and 1/4 cup extra of the hazelnuts. I also made the cookies much larger so I only got around 24 of them. I had to increase the baking time to 15 minutes because of the larger size. I will definitely make these again. Yum!

Real hit at family christmas gathering. Will become part of my cookie tradition. Nice and light. Easy to make.

These are absolutely DIVINE. I was totally flabbergasted with them. They are very light but rich. Shortbread-like in their texture. I used semisweet chocolate with over 60% cocoa and I am sure that made a huge difference. This is sure to become a standard in my repetoire.

These cookies have a wonderful chocolate flavor,and followed the suggestion of others and used semi-sweet chips instead of chunks of bittersweet. I did not coat them in the powdered sugar before baking and only after they were cooled. The flavor was still great with less sugar. The size of a "scant" tablespoon made very small cookies, thus I increased the size which resulted in fewer cookies per batch.

These cookies remind me of the chewy chocolate cookies available at The American Cookie Company. Very rich flavor although the first batch turned out a wee bit dry. I will definitely make again.

These cookies are the perfect combination of very tasty and not very difficult to make (even for a cookie-baking novice). I used semisweet mini chocolate chips because I'm lazy, but I followed the recipe exactly otherwise. The dough became very stiff after adding all the dry ingredients. So much so that I had to knead in the chips and nuts with my hands. Stirring was an impossibility at that point. I also made large cookies, so I got about 32 out of the recipe (as opposed to 5 dozen as the recipe states). I would definitely make these again, as they are easy and guaranteed crowd (and cook) pleasers.

A delicious chocolate cookie. The favor becomes more intense just as you are finishing the cookie, so you just have to have another! The only change I made was to use semi-sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet.
