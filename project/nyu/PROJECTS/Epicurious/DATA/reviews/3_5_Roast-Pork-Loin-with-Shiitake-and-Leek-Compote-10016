One of the best pork dishes I've ever made!! The pork was succulent and the flavor simple but multidimensional.

This recipe has become a favorite. It's really delicious & so easy to prepare. I use a blend of mushrooms, including shitakes, to keep the cost down. I also use white whine instead of red, because that's usually what we have on hand. It improves the appearance of the dish as well. Red wine makes the sauce pink!

This was a great, quick & easy, crowd-pleasing recipe. I used dried shitakes and they worked fine, and I also added some regular button mushrooms. It couldn't be easier, but was impressive just the same.

This was so good! I ended up having to use shallots and baby bellas. I also made a 2 1/2 lb roast and pretty much doubled the mushrooms, wine and broth, which was a good size for 4 people. I also added a little garlic. My new favorite pork recipe!

This dish was excellent. I prepared exactly, except that I added 3 small chopped garlic cloves to the mushrooms and leeks. Yummy! Aslo, I only cook my pork to 150. Turned out perfect. I had to boil the mushrooms and leeks on the stove after I removed the pork to reduce the liquid.

This turned out MUCH better than my husband and I were expecting! Followed everything exactly and really enjoyed it! The textures and flavors, in my opinion, suit this as a hearty winter dish...will definitely make again!

This was excellent, I made half with Shitake mushrooms and half with chanterelle's. The chanterelle's added some great flavor. I also added a clove of garlic to the leeks when I sauteed the leeks. It was really good, be sure to not overcook the pork, I would check it at 35 minutes.

Absolutely delicious and very flavorful. I accidentally used a little more butter than called for, but it wasn't heavy. Pork turned out moist, but I baked for less than half hour. I can't wait to make this for guests and show off!

This is delicious. I used pork chops, substituted field mushrooms, and added diced green apples because that's what I had in the kitchen. Definitely a winter dish. But WOW we loved it!!

A super simple and impressive recipe. The flavors meld well. I have made this several times with great success. Serve with crusty bread and a nice salad and you're set.

My guests seemed to enjoy, but I found it lacking in flavor. There are better pork recipes out there (see Chipotle Marmalade tenderloin)

This recipe was awesome! Everyone commented how great it was. I added a tad more butter to the sauce and three cloves of garlic, and voila! Instant perfection. A definate repeat!

This is my favorite pork loin recipe. I often use regular mushrooms instead of shitakes, they work just as well sliced. I always use shallots (about 6-7) instead of the leeks, just my personal preference. The slow cooking always results in wonderfully tender meat. I use at least twice the amount of liquid called for (about half covering the pork) and often substitute mushroom broth for the beef broth. The meat reduces a lot during cooking. I find that 2-3 pork loins weighing 2-2.5 pounds makes enough for 4.

This was awfully good! I agree that 1 lb. of pork isn't enough. We used 3 lbs., so by the time it was cooked, the leeks had disappeared except for their flavor. We used half shitakes and half common mushrooms. Easy and elegant!

Although this dish was very easy to make and not very labor intensive, the end result was a disappointment. I found the flavors to be too bland (although I added plenty of salt). Also, cooking the mushrooms with the wine until the sauce reduced took forever and in the end the mushrooms were wine-soaked and soggy. I won't be making this recipe again.

Very tasty. One thing to note - recipe calls for 1 pund of meat and says that it serves four. Not true - use 2 pounds of pork to feed four.

An outstanding dish. So simple to prepare.

Ditto what everyone else said. I made it with the shitake mushrooms, which was costly but really good. I'm sure other (cheaper) mushrooms would work just as well. I will certainly make this again.

This is excellent. Since shiitake mushrooms are $9.99 per pound in our area, I used half crimini and half shiitake. It was outstanding. I agree, it is easy to make and can't wait to serve it to our friends. They'll think I worked all day preparing it as it's bursting with flavor.

This is a wonderful recipe - but I have also made it with a larger pork loin roast and have cooked it for a longer period at 350 degrees and it turns out just as good (and serves more people). I have also occasionally used a mix of different kinds of mushrooms.

Yum! The pork had great flavor. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was not only tasty but very easy to make. Perfect for a Sunday dinner. Every store seemed to be out of shiitake mushrooms when I went to make this, so I was forced to omit them. The dish was still excellent and I look forward to trying with the mushrooms as well!

I had bought a pork loin on sale at the store and needed a new way to make it -- this was a delicious new treat!

This dish was done for me this weekend by my sister. I am not a lover of pork, but this dish was so wonderful, that I came here to get the recipe. She served the pork and compote over twice baked mashed potatoes seasoned with gouda and parmesan cheese, garlic, sour cream, milk and butter. Definitely a dinner party recipe, and so easy to fix.
