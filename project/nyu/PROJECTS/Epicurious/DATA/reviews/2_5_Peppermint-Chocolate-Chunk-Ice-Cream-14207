For Cusinart ice cream makers, double this recipe and do not add the chocolate chunks during the last few minutes of rotation--do as the recipe suggests which is to fold in after ice cream is made. I tossed in at the end and nearly broke the motor of the machine. This style of machine cannot handle churning chunks when the ice cream thickens. I give this 2 forks with room for improvement. I'm definitely trying this again. The consistency and peppermint flavor is appealing. I used all red/white mints, so I omitted the food coloring. Besides, the green/white mints are spearmint, and I did not want to mix the mint flavors. Ice cream is a nice pink color. Second, I added some simple syrup with the peppermint extract because it just wasn't as sweet as I expected. Maybe I should add more candy instead? Third, this is an interesting way to make ice cream--cream, milk and cornstarch. I'm used to the custard-style, but this did churn into something very smooth and tasty. I want to keep experimenting with this one.

This was a good base to start from. I added more extract to get the flavor I wanted. If you want your chocolate to be suspended throughout the ice cream, rather than fall to the bottom. Melt the chocolate and add it to the ice cream at the very end of the freezing process. You may not be able to control the size of the chunck but it will be througout the ice cream.

This was good although if I make it again I'll cut down on the amount of chopped peppermints in the chocolate (or crush them quite a bit more to add just the touch of flavor). They tended to be a little overpowering and got stuck in your teeth. I didn't have green or clear mints and made it only using red so I didn't add the food coloring as suggested as it was already a nice shade of deep pink and adding green food coloring wouldn't have resulted in the best color!
