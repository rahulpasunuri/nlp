In the long, hot months of summer in Texas I make ice cream every other week. This is one of my favourites. Several of my friends request it for dessert when invited over for dinner - I can't think of higher praise than that. It is a little time consuming (cajeta) but no more so than any other "special" ice cream.

This was so fun to make and so delicious. Thanks so much to the authors for this great gelato! It is unforgettable. I took some picture of my creation and the process at my blog at [www.theplynx.com].

This sounded so good to me. I don't have an ice cream maker so I couldn't make it. Instead I found some banana fosters ice cream and topped it with cashews. It was so easty and the flavor combination is amazing. The salty nuts with the sweet carmal and banana flavor is great. So I look forward to hearing what people who can actually make it say about it. Wish I could try it.

I came upon this book at Borders and it is the best!! Have been searching for gelato recipes for ages with no success. Finally! This was the first recipe I tried and it is delicious-- The cajeta is extremely time-consuming and tedious to make. But the result was so worth it, I have 2 more quarts of goat milk waiting in the fridge. This time I'm rotating my kids in shifts during the stirring process. Sadly, my husband just got a high cholesterol report from the Dr. so I guess I have to explore the sorbetto chapters of the book!

'The base' is a different recipe. Click on the words 'the base' at the top of the recipe and you will be led to the what you are lookinf for. I can see why you would be confused.

re: ptcruiser70663 - The base is a custard made from cream, sugar and eggs. Click on the link that says 'plain base' and it will give you the recipe. Then you're adding everything else to that base.

I don't understand these instructions. What does "add half the base" mean? If the bananas, sugar, etc., are part of the base, how do you add half of them to them?

I know eating ice cream will make us gain weight. But then again, probably with moderation and lots of exercises, I think desserts like this will be okay, once in a while :) I like the almost sugar substitute in this recipe which makes it more healthy than the commercially made ice cream.
