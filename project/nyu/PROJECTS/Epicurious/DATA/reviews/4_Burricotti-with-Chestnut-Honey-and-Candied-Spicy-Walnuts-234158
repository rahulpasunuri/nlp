This recipe is a masterpiece: all five basic flavors in one small bite. I made my own ricotta (easy, google it) as I did not have burricotti. Be sure to shred the radicchio after it cools from saute-ing, it is difficult to bite through.

Why has no one else tried this? It's fantastic! I'm guessing it's becuase Burricotti is hard to find? I used Burrata (which is a mozzarella skin filled with un-set mozzarella, instead of ricotta) instead and it worked just fine. This could work as either an appetizer or a dessert, take your pick.
