I make this all the time; I am asked for the recipe almost every single time. This is a real crowd pleaser, ideal for a buffet or to accompany anything BBQed. Don't skimp on the mint, it is really what makes this dish.

This is really a 3-fork dish, but, considering how quick and easy it is, it deserves a 4. I've made this several times, so here's my alterations: Make quinoa in a rice cooker! It turns out perfect, and is so much easier. Add orange bell pepper, grape tomatoes, feta, increase corn to 5-6 ears. Double the dressing, but stay with about 1TB honey, and go half butter/half olive oil for the fat. And I use all zest, all juice from the lemons. I also use a stick blender to emulsify the dressing before adding to quinoa. -Sometimes I also add cilantro, just because I love it.

I've made this twice now and I just love it! It's light and very fresh tasting. The only change I think I'm going to make next time is to cut the honey down just a bit as I'd like it a little less sweet.

I cut this in half, and threw in some feta like other reviews suggested. I was worried about the mint (I'm not a big fan), but I liked it. I didn't do the fancy-pants way of cooking/steaming the quinoa either. Still really good!

I loved this dish and thought the fresh mint gave it a really nice, light taste. I would add fresh diced red pepper for color since it was a bit on the bland-looking side without some extra color. I'll hold on to this recipe for sure, it works both cold or hot and is quick, easy and fresh.

Easy, fast, would work with veggies other than corn as well. Followed recipe as written and loved it. With grilled lamb chops the mint really pulls it all together.

Very good. I halved the recipe, but other than that followed the directions exactly, and it came out great. This was the first time I made quinoa, and I will definitely make this recipe again.

Made this exactly as written (ok, I'll admit I used a can of corn instead of fresh)and really loved it. I have been making the quinoa with black beans, corn and cilantro recipe from this site for years and love it, but just wanted a change. I will be making this again for sure.

This has become a staple both for serving at home and to bring to barbecues, etc. I substitute diced red pepper for the corn and sugar for the honey (dietary restrictions) and use chives for the scallions since they are going nuts in the garden. Have used olive oil for the butter as well and it turned out great. Yum!

Very fresh tasting. Thought it should have had a bit less honey in it. Used frozen corn and that seemed to work just fine.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. I only needed one large lemon to get to 1 tbsp of zest. My guests commented on the "freshness" of the dish. So, if possible I would try to use all fresh ingredients (corn, mint, scallions).

I made this recipe as written except I used a rice cooker for the quinoa and added crumbled feta per our reviewers' suggestion. It was delicious! I have no problem with the butter -- it blended perfectly with the other ingredients and when tossed with and absorbed by the hot quinoa was nothing like a salad dressing.

Hearty & fresh. Grill corn for added flavor. yum! I'm serving with grilled pork loin, basted with apricot jam.

This was the first time I have enjoyed quinoa, and I've given it quite a few chances to taste good. Used chives rather than scallions since they were growing with the mint in my garden, and took the advice of the reviewers who recommended a crumbling of feta. This was exceptional. Served it as a vegetarian main with sauteed kale and yellow squash on the side.

Wonderful side dish, fresh and delicious with local corn! All my guests loved it!

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed this recipe as did my dinner guests. I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: I grilled the corn, then removed from the cobb. I substituted fresh cilantro for the mint. I added an extra 1/2C raw red onion. I cooked the quinoa as I would rice, meaning 1 C quinoa to 2 C plain water. The end result was light and easy...nothing to add or subtract further. My daughter in law liked eating it with sour cream.

Rating: 3
Excellent side dish and great for the summer. Steaming it did result in a very fluffy quinoa. I also used olive oil instead of butter, just because I was afraid the butter might solidify before I got the quinoa into it. Could have used more mint too. Will make again, maybe with some minced red onion in the mix next time.

Rating: 4
Loved this recipe! I did add more dressing and also some yellow and red roasted peppers just for color as I felt it needed some. Next time will try olive oil rather than butter, and basil rather than mint. My daughter kept saying it was fabulous and that she could just keeping eating and eating it. It really is a lovely recipe just as written and it makes a huge amount, perfect for a gathering.

Rating: 4
I love this light fresh summery salad. I've prepared it both by boiling the quinoa in water in a ratio of 2 parts water to one part quinoa, and by steaming the grain. Steaming is way better, creating a light fluffy texture, allowing the nuttiness of the quinoa to come through, and setting off the tangy sweetness of the dressing. I used basil instead of mint both times. Delicious.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe pretty close to the way it was written, with the exception of the corn. Fresh corn wasn't available so I had to substitute frozen corn. The dish was simple and delicious. I would definitely try it with olive oil too as others suggested, but the butter does add a nice taste. Of course olive oil is healthier. I know some used cilantro. The mint was delicious........

I'll make this again, but next time use 5 ears corn / 1.5 cups quinoa, and maybe some more scallions. Simple, fresh, and makes enough for a crowd.

fabulous summer salad, I doubled the dressing, there wasn't enough and it was fabulous. I also added crumbled feta cheese at the end for a little extra protein. Served with simple sauteed prawn skewers for a complete dinner. yum! extra bonus: it lasted in the fridge for 4-5 days.

This has some good points to it -- steaming the quinoa makes it taste really good, and adding corn is always a plus. Really, there's just too much lemon in this - and I went light on the zest and the juice. I succeeded in cutting the overwhelming lemon taste with some white wine vinegar. Would make the steamed quinoa part again but dress it very differently.

Delicious. I used lime zest and juice instead of lemon (I have a tree) and it was just yummy. Kept going back for more.

My guests went back for seconds and thirds this was so good. I used white corn and roasted it. This is going to become one of my go-to dishes.

This is a wonderful recipe because it can be customized with whatever you have on hand -- I threw in lots of chopped roasted eggplant and onions, and also added lots of chopped fresh tomatoes and red pepper. I lost the butter, added olive oil, and substituted cilantro for mint. The lemon zest and chopped scallions are key. I mounded it on plates and generously crumbled French goat's milk feta on top. My vegetarian boyfriend fell out. It was one of the most delicious whole-meal salads I've ever made.

This was a really easy recipe. Followed some previous reviewers suggestions by sauting the frozen corn in butter, subbing olive oil for butter and using equal parts lemon juice and butter. It was a side to the Grilled pork chops with Mango Mojo and it paired nicely.

Yummy. I agree with other reviewers that cilantro is nice instead of mint, and boiling the quinoa instead of steaming it is fine.

Rating: 3
I loved this dish. The flavors are very subtle. I did not add anything, and given how delicate the flavors are, I don't think I would. It seems like adding cheese would overpower things. My sieve wasn't big enough for the steaming part, so I just drained the water and put the quinoa back in the pot with a towel over the top and put the lid on and let it stand for half an hour or so with no heat on the burner. Unfortunately, all of my guests loved it too so I have no leftovers! My first time making quinoa - I will definitely make it again. Maybe tonight.

Made the recipe just as instructed and I generally like mint, but I didn't care for it in this dish. I will make it again using a different herb -- I'm thinking cilantro or parsley.

This was my first go at making quinoa and I must say it was a hit! I added more lemon zest and a touch more lemon juice. The dish is great as a light lunch on it's own, but I paired it with steak.

This is a favorite at our place. I make it about once a month (frozen corn) and always add extra lemon zest. Good feta cheese and sweet grape tomatoes make it even better. And there's something about this dish that makes me feel great after I eat it!

I'm not sure what happened to my previous review but it seems to have ended up in cyberspace. Hopefully, I'm not duplicating it. I made this and used cilantro instaed of mint as I ewas having scallops with it and did not think the mint would suit scallops. Next time I have lamb chops I will make it again using the mint. This was a very tasty dish. I sauted the corn in butter before adding it to the quinoa. I thought this brought out the sweetness of the corn, as I was using frozen corn.

This was great. I used red quinoa and since I was having scallops I used cilantro instead of mint. I will make it again using mint when I have a mint-friendly main dish, like lamb.

We used the water we cooked the corn in for cooking the quinoa. Next time we do this for a group I would cook the quinoa ahead and then steam and dress it right before serving.

This is an excellent quinoa recipe. I've made it four times now in the last 3 weeks (woohoo for fresh corn) and made it a couple times with half red quinoa and half buff quinoa for a different appearance. There was little difference in the taste, if any. This is an excellent, flavorful, light, healthy, gluten free recipe to have on hand for summertime. Oh, I actually have always used half basil, half mint, because I wasn't able to let my mint grow enough to get the yield I needed.

Rating: 3
A very good dish - easy to make! 1) There is no need to steam the Qunioa - unless you have extra time on your hands. 2) I used fresh spring onions, minced, from the farmer's market -- yum! 3) I added Fennel fronds - but I think you can even add dill. 4) Next time I will try mincing a hot pepper and tossing it in - I think this dish would kick up to the next level!

With the exception of omitting the mint (don't care for it in food) and using limes in place of the lemon, I followed the recipe as written. I wasn't sure about the dressing since I usually don't like sweet sauces but this was really good! It was slightly sweet without being too sweet. The next day I added halved cherry tomatoes to the leftovers for more color and it made a pretty presentation.

Really enjoyed this recipe, the mint was delicious with the fresh corn. I suspect this dish is only as good as your corn though, so best save this one for the summer months. We added some parsley and extra lemon juice and also substituted agave nectar for the honey.

i used limes instead of lemons, added a bit of balsamic vinegar, red onion, cucumber, garbanzo beans and fresh jalapeños. you could probably add just about anything to the salad using the basic recipe. such goodness!

This dish is a hit with everyone who's tried it, except maybe my stepson who only raves about meat or dessert. I tend to halve the quinoa so that there is more of everything else for maximum flavor. Doubling the vinaigrette would probably also do the trick. We also use olive oil instead of butter. I rinse the quinoa using paper coffee filters in a colander so I don't lose any of it down the drain.

Rating: 3
This was very good, but requires alot more dressing than called for. I would make about a cup and a third of lemon vinagrette for this amount, with something closer to a 1:1 ratio of lemon juice to oil. I also prefer olive oil to the butter. A perfect gluten free substitute for cous-cous.

This was delicious both the day of and as leftovers the next day. Like others, I added chopped tomatoes and crumbled feta; I also used olive oil instead of butter and probably doubled the chopped mint. I'd like to try this with a Mexican twist, perhaps with black beans, cumin, and fresh cilantro instead of mint.

I thought this recipe was fantastic as-is- no need to add or substitute anything. The butter and the honey added such an interesting, mild sweetness. Loved it. My only issue is that between all the straining and rinsing, I ended up losing about 1/4 of the quinoa along the way (in the sink, etc.) DId this happen to anyone else? Any advice?

For me this recipe needed something to contrast with the mildness of the quinoa and the sweetness of the corn. Remove the mint; add chopped onion fried golden in olive oil; add a little of the oil; and then some crumbled feta.

Quinoa is not a love/hate kind of thing - it's more an I-can-take-it-or-leave-it kind of food. That being said, this recipe was one of the best quinoa recipes I've tasted but the dish was still met with a decided lack of enthusiasm. It was best when it was really fresh (still warm) but I served it at room temperature and it was pretty unexciting. I've given quinoa a few chances but I think that's it for me.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! I didn't have the mint, but it still turned out great, so fresh and delicious! Also, if you don't have fresh corn, frozen works just as well. This will definitely become a staple for our family.

Sorry, no offense (really!), but I hate to admit I didn't care for this. I forgot that I meant to sub EVOO for the butter (not really sure if it would have mattered), and the mint threw me off, and maybe the honey, too, I'm not sure. I love quinoa, too, so maybe I'll try this again with some modifications. If using fresh sweet corn, it really doesn't require cooking, which is great!

Rating: 3
I would cut down on the honey next time, or leave it out. The fresh corn has a lot of sweetness so the dish ended up too sweet. Otherwise it was great, and very easy to cook. I never knew what to do with quinoa before, so it's nice to have this recipe which should be easy to modify with different vegetables.

I just discovered quinoa (the superfood!) and I am psyched that it can be so tasty! I didn't have all the ingredients, so I used frozen corn and bottled lemon juice. I also threw a few basil leaves in for fun, which made no apparent difference. It's quite good, even without the fresh ingredients!

Great recipe! Very fresh local corn raw off the cob is delicious in this- what a great idea. The added texture and sweetness was very appealing. Like many others I used olive oil in place of butter. I also used lime juice in place of lemon and added diced cukes and halved cherry tomatoes...oh yeah, more mint as well.Well received and definately recommended!

This dish was so good. So incredibly flavorful and very light. Excellent side dish that can be enjoyed hot or cold.

This dish is light,subtle,and perfect for health conscience eaters.

It was my first time making quinoa, but definitely not my last! Contrary to other reviewers I didn't see what was so difficult/time intensive about the cooking method. I actually halved the amount of quinoa that I made which worked fine. Like others used olive oil. I used less oil and a bit more lemon juice. Also tweaked the recipe as I'm not a huge mint fan, used corn fresh off the cob - definitely no cooking needed, scallions, sun dried tomatoes, rinsed/drained kidney beans and fresh basil. Delicious! Lots of room for changing up the recipe to fit your mood.

Loved this! Because of a no dairy/salt diet I followed the suggestion to substitute olive oil instead of butter and left out the salt. Using basil instead of mint added enough umph to make up for the lack of salt. Still delicious! I happaned to make another lettuce/mango/avocado/heirloom tomato salade as well and found that mixing the two on my plate was heavenly!

I've made this recipe twice, once for family and once for friends, to rave reviews. Spices need tweaking to balance mint and lemon, and I thought the butter worked well, as long as you view this as more a grain dish than a salad. It makes a very light, refreshing side dish, and leftovers are great for breakfast. And this recipe taught me a better way to prepare quinoa.

A little bit sweet, nice and light, refreshing dish during the summer heat. Great w/ grilled chicken or lamb. I didn't steam the quinoa per the recipe, but it still came out great - TONS of compliments. Next time I'll try frozen corn since cutting the corn off the cob was kind of a pain for a non-cook like me.

Grilled the corn, and used half the butter. Ordinarily I'd agree with some of the other reviewers about butter sounding odd here, but I've always thought of quinoa as having a starch-like quality, so the butter didn't hit me as so weird. This was really, REALLY good! Next time I'll add a little garlic as well.

Did not cook the corn, as suggested. Used olive oil instead of butter and probably not as much. We tend to have limes on hand, so used juice of 4 limes and some bottled lemon peel; added some Sambal Oleck, for a little kick. Delicious!

Didn't use the butter--just didn't seem right on a salad. Had to double the lemon and truthfully, coulda used more. Tonight the leftovers reappear with shrimp, salmon, brined olives, and more lemon for a seafood salad. The steaming method is a winner giving the grains a much nicer texture.

This recipe was delicious. It would make a great side dish, or would do well as a light main. My husband and I had it as a main course last night -- I halved the recipe and it was perfect for the two of us. I thought it required an additional pat of butter in the mix and then a splash of my best olive oil on top once I dished it out. I added halved grape tomatoes -- about a cup full and when I make this again, I will add some more. Chopped cucumbers would be a good addition too. I will definitely make this again!

Quinoa has a light,almost fluffy texture and a slightly nutty flavor. It's also has more protein than other grains making it a nutritional prize. Despite that, it's really yummy - much better than couscous I'm looking forward to trying this recipe.

Are scallions the same as spring onions? I can't wait to try this recipe as I just 'discovered' quinoa last week! I planned to make cous cous salad only to find I didn't have any cous cous! So I used a pack of quinoa that had been in the cupboard for ages 'cos I didn't quite know what to do with it. I cooked for 10 mins then let stand for 10 mins to absorb all the water, as per instuctions on pack then added roasted peppers & pine nuts, coriander & a splash of balsamic dressing. It was delicious but rather stodgy so I'm keen to try the steaming method.
