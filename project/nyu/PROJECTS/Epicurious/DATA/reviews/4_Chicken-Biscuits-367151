This is definitely a big, bad breakfast, but tasty nonetheless. For JHawke, surely that is a picture of Rita Hayworth on Beth's site -- definitely a bombshell.

I only made the biscuits and they were delicious. I will use this recipe for all my biscuits in the future. Very quick and easy to assemble.

Made this for dinner last night and my husband is already begging me to make it again! I thought it might be too much with the fried chicken/biscuits/sausage gravy but it was just simply sublime!

I just made the biscuits so I won't rate the recipe. The biscuits taste strongly of baking powder. If I use this recipe again I will cut it down, maybe in half. It is a very soft dough so I made drop biscuits, which was fine.

Beth: Buttermilk is acidic and breaks down the meat fibers. It works great with fish too, but don't marinate fish too long as it will get mushy and break down too fast. In any event, marinating in buttermilk also creates a more moist and flavorful chicken as well as makes the flour/breading stick better during cooking. PS: if that is your picture when you were younger you were/are a bombshell!

This was really tasty. But I would like to know the science to soaking the chicken in buttermilk.
