My family loves this recipe for Thanksgiving. I've made it twice before - the first time the custard didn't set, but the second time it did. My problem is with the crust - I'm using the correct amount of butter, but I always seem to have trouble getting the crust to stick to the sides of the tart pan, any ideas?

I wish I knew what happened, but I had the same result as another baker- the tart never set, tasted good albeit very sweet. I reviewed everything I did and could not determine my error but it wasn't pretty. It was too much work to try it again.

Wow! I just made this dessert for Easter and it was great. Simple, too. I substituted 1/2 cups of ground almonds for the graham crackers and listened to the suggestion of brushing semisweet chocolate on the crust before pouring the curd in. The combination of lemon and chocolate was okay but next time I will try brushing the crust with white chocolate instead. Maybe it doesn't even need that! Very simple and delicious.

It tasted good but wasn't spectacular. There was a lot of work for a no-bake tart, and I let it chill for 4 hours but it was a complete mess when it was time to serve. I should have added the envelope of gelatin instead of just a tsp. This tart could have been disasterous to my dinner party but I just laughed and brought out the camera (what a mess). I put the whipped cream in a pasty bag with a star tip-- really pretty presentation though there was SLOP underneath.

This was delicious- I made it for the book club on a warm summer evening and everyone raved about it. I did not coat the sides of the tart pan with the crumbs-only the bottom of the pan- and it turned out great.

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and was a hit. I thought the whipped cream to be an essential part - providing a good balance to the tartness of the lemon. I didn't have any trouble with the egg cooking when making the custard - I was careful to keep whisking and took it off the heat just when I saw the first bubbles forming. I will be making this often over the summer - a real treat.

I didn't make the whipped cream, just put a squirt of the canned stuff on top. This is very tasty and easy but it looks impressive. My eggs started to cook a bit, so I had to pick out some white bits. Not sure how to prevent that.

I would give this four forks, but I messed up while making the custard... I didn't read the instructions before I started, and heated the sugar/lemon juice before adding the eggs. Needless to say, the eggs started cooking (duh!), and I ended up w/ custard w/ bits of egg in it. I ended up straining the custard mixture to get the egg bits out, and it turned out to be very tasty - there was just less of it than I would have liked... Also made an almond crust substituting the graham crackers w/ 1 and 1/4 cup crushed almonds - very tasty. I also added lemon zest and a hint of ginger to the whipped cream, which saved the dessert, as it gave it more of a lemony flavor than it otherwise would've had due to the lack of filling...

Liked the lemon curd; hated the whipped cream. It's too much; it distracts you from the lemon, and it's *very* heavy. That might be because I'm temporarily in London, and used English double cream, since heavy cream doesn't seem to be a term over here. Next time, I'll make it without the whipped cream, with or without meringue. Like other cooks, I used more lemon zest and lemon juice, and the filling was surprisingly easy and good. But I still feel sick from all that whipped cream.

Well, this one gets 4 forks for being so easy AND so good. Made it with meyer lemons so I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and used 5 oz of lemon juice! Came out very tasty and you gotta love that cream on top!! I think I might try to use this recipe but maybe change things slightly and make an orange curd....

Absolutely Fabulous! I made the dessert as written with the addition of a smear of melted bittersweet chocolate over the crust. The combo of the lemon with a hint of chocolate was devine. I also used only one cup of cream for topping, it was plenty. We never use cream and why buy a pint just for this recipe? Easy and foolproof.

Very easy, if you like lemon curd you will love this. Crust has nice butterscotch flavor which contrasts nicely with the tartness of the filling. I will make again for causual get togethers or as part of dessert buffet for those who don't like chocolate??

I'd never made a tart before, so chose this one as my first. Incredible! It was easy to do (although it took more like seven minutes instead of five for the filling to thicken in my case), came out beautifully, and tasted delicious! A keeper!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. I'm asked to make this for nearly every gathering we attend. I did make a couple of modifications, however. Slightly less sugar, a bit more lemon juice (we like the tart lemon flavor), and the most important thing of all - USE MEYER LEMONS IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY FIND THEM!!! They really make all the difference in the world!!

I made a mistake with this recipe and it still was terrific! (Used all 10 Tbsp of the butter in the crust--yikes!) The filling was delicious and even my kids who don't normally go for lemon desserts enjoyed it. A nice change if you usually make lemon meringue pie.

I have made this desert for many occations. Have always got rave reviews. Be sure to make it a day ahead to allow for it to gell and settle. First time I served it is was very runny, but tasty just the same. Easy to make. Yummy to eat.

I am so glad I found this recipe! It is relatively simple and quick to make, and the results are just wonderful!!! A keeper!!!

MMMM!!!!!!! I think everybody should make this and all review it and give it four forks. There should even be a rarely used five-fork category that could be awarded to this dessert. Refreshing, delicious, piquant, smooth... The lemon filling had just the right consistency, & the graham cracker crust was the perfect compliment. My only problem was getting the whipping cream to peak, since it was very hot and humid the day I made this recipe. Next time I make it, I ertainly make sure there are good conditions for it. But it didn't matter anyway; everybody raved!!! This is definitely my new favorite dessert for company. Cheers to Sara Hainsworth for sharing!
