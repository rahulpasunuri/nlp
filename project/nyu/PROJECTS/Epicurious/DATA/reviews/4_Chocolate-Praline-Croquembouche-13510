I have made this every Christmas for about 10 years. It was from my mom's old magazine that she accidently threw the mag out this past year. I am so happy to have found it online. The caramel can be a little tricky to work with sometimes but other than that the recipe is pretty easy just time consuming.

I just noticed that epicurious made a goof and did not include the necessary recipe for the praline powder: Melt 1/2 c. sugar in a heavy saucepan and cook until deep golden. Add 1/2 c. blanched almonds. Pour into small greased baking pan, cool, break into chunks, process into fine powder. May store in airtight container, chilled for up to 2 days.

My guests really thought this was a delicious dessert. Perfect for those parties where you want to have lots of things for people to snack on. The only hard part was the assembly because it had to be done that day. I certainly didn't get 55 mounds out of the pastry recipe. More like 35. I only dipped the bottom of the puffs into the caramel to control the sweetness but still managed to get the structure to hold together.
