I forgot to mention that I didn't make the tortillas. I bought sopes at my local Mexican grocery store.

For anyone who loves huitlacoche this is recipe is a delicious and easy way to highlight it. Huitlacoche isn't for everyone, but its warm mushroomy flavor should be on your menu if you are going for haute Mexican cuisine.

The huitlacoche was revolting! A couple of bites in, everything that had touched it was thrown in the trash. My husband and I both had to get mints to get rid of the aftertaste. Blagh!

For a simpler recipe, I bought medium sized corn tortillas. I omitted the chile, lard and used a can of corn instead of corn fungus. Kind of bland, but the salsa and (cheddar) cheese spiced it up.
