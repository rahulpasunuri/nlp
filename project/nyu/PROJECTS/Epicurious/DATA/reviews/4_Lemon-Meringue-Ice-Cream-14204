My extended family LOVES this ice cream. They beg me to make it. It does require a lot of cooking technique, so be sure to have all ingredients ready to go and all utensils required at hand. That said, you can roll right through this in less than 20 minutes and then chill until it's time to freeze it. The light, bright lemony flavor is a fabulous finish to a summer meal! Try it and LOVE it!

A friend made this for my birthday and used meyer lemons. The tart tangy lemon contrasted with the ultra-sweet meringue, crunchy (which I sprinkled on top, as I ate this a few days after she made it) was simply AMAZING. If I could do backflips, I would. Yum...

If you are looking for a fresh lemony fresh flavor in an ice cream this is the best! We are fortunate enough to have our own lemon tree so we make this on a regular basis, have it with lemon pound cake or just on its own for a little sweet tart treat. Its smooth and creamy, just the way ice cream should be. Enjoy

Awesome ice cream! I don't care for meringue so I just made the lemon ice cream - wow, was it creamy and smooth. Loved the flavor; yes it had a little bit of tartness (and I used organic lemons, which are a bit sweeter than conventional), but adding more sugar could fix that. But I wouldn't change it any other way - delicious! A note about the previous comment about not adding the zest because of the texture - you're supposed to pour the custard through a sieve before chilling; this removes all the zest.

This was a perfect dessert after a substantial spring brunch; I served berries on the side, and people raved. That said, I changed the recipe a bit. Since one out of the two previous reviews was negative, I reduced the lemon juice a bit, worrying that the flavor would be too tart. Instead of 2/3 cup, I used 1/2 cup plus one T. I also didn't want to add grated zest because I thought the graininess would detract from the smoothness that I wanted. Instead of the zest I added 1 1/4 t natural lemon extract. Since I loved the resulting flavor, the original amount of juice might have been just fine. My way, the flavor was strong, tart, not puckery, and yet with plenty of sweetness--like the flavor of a perfect lemon meringue pie filling. For the texture reason, I left out the meringue bits. I will definitely make this again. Flavor and texture are best when the ice cream sits out for a while and is softened.

Nice texture, but way too lemony. the meringue didn't really add much either. I could tell my guests weren't too thrilled with it. Won't be making again.

This is my favorite ice cream recipe. The ice cream is ultra-creamy, and the lemon flavor is perfect - not too intense, not too sour. Everyone who has sampled it has been impressed with the crunchy bits of meringue. This recipe is ideal for lazy summer days.
