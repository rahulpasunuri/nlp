This was the best pork dish I have made to date. I left out the tarragon and parsely. I used 2.5 lbs of pork tenderloin. My only complaint is that we needed more of the excellent sauce! Next time I will double the sauce...Served with egg noodles.

I made this recipe last night and would like to share a few suggestions regarding amending the ingredients... I substituted low fat sour cream for the heavy whipping cream and I added sauteed mushrooms and some fresh tarragon. I increased the white wine to a 1/2 cup and decreased the Dijon significantly, only adding a heaping tablespoon. The result: DELICIOUS and much less fat than the original recipe. It is an elegant dish. I served it with mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus.

This was a great recipe. I too reduced the amount of mustard to a little over 1/8 cup. Also, I didn't have white wine, so I used 1/6 cup white balsalmic vinegar and 1/6 cup water. Of course that was pretty tangy so I threw in 1 teaspoon of sugar.

Good, quick weeknight meal using only a few "cupboard" ingredients. Used a bit more wine, a bit less mustard (added a bit at a time to taste) and shallots as had no green onions. Served over rice with veg.

great recipe...easy enough for mid-week. I used vodka instead of wine and served with pasta/spinach/ mushrooms for a full meal.

I've made this several times- great recipe! Very easy weeknight meal, but looks like it took a lot of time. I use at least the amount of mustard called for - I usually just add enough until I decide the sauce has a good taste. My husband loves this and even my picky 8-year old really liked this

I cut back on the amount of dijon as recommended by others and thought it was rather bland. I think it would be better with more dijon but not worth all the extra calories from the whipping cream. I wonder if there's a way to lighten this up a bit?

I'm making this again - it was so good. If you try this recipe read other reviews first for advice and changes. (Would never put 1/4 cup Dijon mustard in) - as some reviewers failed to do - made as written and then didn't like the result. (Maybe tasting before adding might have been prudent) I also took the advice of a reviewer and I leave tenderloins whole.

I made this exactly as listed and did not like it one bit, such that I just ate rice and green beans for dinner. I tried starting with just 1 tbsp mustard, as suggested, and that was pretty bad. Adding more just made it worse, and seasoning with salt/pepper didn't help either. I actually didn't like the pork by itself, either, so I wouldn't recommend this one at ALL.

My family loves it! We serve it with a side dish of wild rice and mixed vegetables and there's never any leftover. We have discovered it's great with or without the heavy whipping cream in the sauce--although don't leave out the whipping cream if you don't like tangy sauces. I increased the wine a bit, and decreased the dijon mustard when leaving out the whipping cream.

A perfect recipe. This was the most tender pork I have ever made, and the recipe was simple to do. A great company dish.

Oh Yum! This was wonderful. The sauce would be wonderful on almost anything. The recipe as is turned out perfect and was so easy to prepare.

YUMMY! It was good because it was simple. The cream gave it a wonderful mouth feel and the wine and green onions gave it a nice flavor (make sure you use wine you enjoy drinking!). I added all of the green onions at the begining of the sauce and returned the pork to the sauce at the end to coat the medallions before serving. Be sure not to over cook the pork and don't use the brands (like Hormel) that are injected with solutions to make them moist or you will be disapointed with this recipe.

Excellent...quick and easy and elegant.

OH MY YUM! good with chicken or pork and I've done it with both. I don't bother with separating the onions and such, because it is a great fast weeknight special dinner. I like it with a rice pilaf with raisins and nuts that is a good counterpart to the dijon.

Very good recipe. We chose to keep the tenderloin whole to ensure that it didn't overcook as can sometimes happen with smaller pieces such as medallions. Cooked appox. 12 min. and let rest an addl. ten minutes. Would definitely cook again, even for company.

Outstanding with the following changes: Increase white wine to 2/3 cup (I use dry vermouth), decrease dijon to 1 tablespoon or even a bit less. 1/4 cup dijon is way too much for a lot of people's taste. Serve with brown or white rice and put the sauce on that too. Excellent.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe word for word, and served with garlic butter rice and salad. Everyone really enjoyed it.

One word to describe this dish- AWFUL!. I tried it with pork, dijon mustard, a dry and wonderful chardonnay for ingredients and it stunk. SO, I thought let's try it with chicken as previously indicated by other reviewers and it was just as bad, bad, bad. I didn't mind spending the money on the chicken and making the mistake, I did mind the extra money for the pork fillets which would have been better on the grill without the sauce. MAY I suggest, make the sauce first, before you consider making the dish. If the sauce passes your palate, do the dish. If not, search again.

I made this dish with boneless chicken breasts and it was very good! I cut back on the butter and didn't separate the scallions. My husband loved it. Served with rice (for sauce) and broccoli. Simple and delicious, took me no time to make.

I've made this dish too many times to count. It's always a hit. Easy enough for a weekday meal and fancy enough for a special occasion. Last time I used this recipe, I simply sauteed pork loin chops (without flouring) and poured the sauce over the chops. Made easy even easier. Always make with plain white rice to soak up all the delicious sauce.

great week night meal....!!! The sauce is so easy.....and the flavor is yummy!!! We made it without flouring the pork (high carb) and still loved it! You could even serve this to guests and make the plate look pretty and impressive! We will do this again and again....try it with chicken or fish...I bet it would be good.

Recipe is great, have made it several times and got great reviews. I did cut down significantly on the mustard in the sauce. While it goes very well with the pork the sauce with full mustard tends to overpower the side dishes.

Rating: 3
While this was tasty, when I make it again, I will substitute chicken for the pork. It makes a fabulous (and easy to make) sauce but we just felt that it would be a much better compliment to chicken than pork.

This was very good. Served it over loin of pork and freshly steamed broccoli. I did add a little bit of honey and tarragon to the sauce -- just to cut down on the dijon mustard. DELICIOUS!

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. I didn't really care for the mustard sauce. I've come across much better pork tenderloin recipes.

Hats off to the folks who prepare this on a weekday night!! It was very quick for the prep work. The actual cooking time was also relatively fast (+/- 20 minutes), but it was active cooking that had to be closely watched the whole way through. But overall, the recipe results were good and I might make it again someday.

This was an easy, excellent recipes. No leftovers here!!! I served it with steamed asparagus. The sauce from the pork was excellent on the asparagus as well.

My medallions were thicker than normal even after pounding so I browned them after dredging in flour w/salt & Pepper. I mixed all the other ingredients plus garlic powder in a pan and cooked until well mixed. (I also substituted low fat 1/2 & 1/2 for whipping cream). I put the meat in a glass baking dish that had been sprayed w/pam and then covered w/the liquid mixture. I covered tightly w/foil and baked for 1 hour at 350. It was tender, tasty and moist. Served with buttered noodles that we also spooned the liquid from the meat over rounded out a meal to remember. I will definitely make this again.

USE A TOUCH OF HOT SAUCE AND A TEASPOON OF SALT. THIS WILL SPICE UP THE RECIPE.
