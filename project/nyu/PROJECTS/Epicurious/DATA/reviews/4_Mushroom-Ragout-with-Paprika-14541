Very quick and easy! Made this because I had mushrooms that needed to be used - shitaki, oyster, and white mushrooms. Followed the recipe exactly except for substituting regular onion for shallots. Very delicious! I will absolutely make this again and will experiment with other mushrooms. What a nice surprise!

I make this at least a couple of times, every year, to handle the overload of mushrooms that my husband and I gather. It's really wonderful, although I've experimented with the recipe, just a bit, by sauteeing the wild mushrooms (we use Chanterelle, Lobster and Fried Chicken mushrooms)separately, then adding to the mix just before adding the sour cream and parsley, as I believe that it keeps the integrity of the wild mushrooms, which we like to be able to identify and taste. I also believe that the recipe benefits by sitting overnight in the fridge. Wonderful served with white or wild rice!

I make this for Christmas every year and the mushroom lovers in the family are crazy about it. The cognac, fresh parsley, broth cream and sour cream combine to create a great, rich sauce

OH Yes!!! DEFINITE do-over! Its very much like a veggie stroganoff but it went well with the steaks we grilled that night. My local "push-n-shove" has a trio pack of wild mushrooms and I bought white and baby portabellos to mix into the dish. I left everything in large pieces and didn't really cook the mushrooms through - just until they started looking done since I figured the sauce would cook them down more. Hot Paprika and 15-20 minutes later, my husband was feverishly nodding his head in approval. I used the leftovers in an omelete in the morning. I could see this over a bed of noodles, fresh crisp salad, crusty bread and a nice glass of wine.

Really, really tasty and easy - I actually found it better without the sour cream, and I also finely diced some sirloin steak I had in the fridge, threw that in, and voila - total comfort food.

Delicious and easy. I used plain button mushrooms and a simple brandy. I also left out the heavy cream. Still very good! I made a simple risotto with Parmesan and parsley on the side and scrambled eggs for a vegetarian meal.

I've been making this recipe since I bought the magazine on the news stand in December of 1997 (for 40 pesos!). This is always easy, always a hit with guests, who sometimes mention it years later. I had to look it up in epicurious because I lost that magazine in my last move... and I'm ready to make it yet again!

I made this and substituted veal stock for the chicken broth. This made it much more flavorful and able to stand up to pork medallions. (Beef stock would work too). It was a big hit with my mushroom loving dinner guests!

Blah. I left out the cognac, maybe it would have been better with it in. The recipe was good but not worth the money and effort for the outcome.

made this dish two years ago and my friends are still talking about it. I lost the issue that I found it in, now I can make it again

Just prepared this for the first time with sauteed pork medallions. Very tasty. The reduction step was tricky, as the mushrooms gave up their liquid and started becoming overcooked. My guests loved it.
