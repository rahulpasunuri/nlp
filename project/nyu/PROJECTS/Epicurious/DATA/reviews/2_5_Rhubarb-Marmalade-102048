Very good. I used half of the sugar and it was still too sweet, for me. I didn't process it, will just keep it in the fridge and use it up. I think the rhubarb ginger jam on this site is a little better.

This is a nice tart marmalade. I sealed the 8 oz. jars and processed them for 10 minutes, as I will be selling this at our Church Bazaar this Fall. I agree with the cook from MN as far as the "jello" recipe goes ... it's good and flavorful, plus it's quick.

I tried this one to compare with my mom's recipe. Her's is a bit sweeter- 4c. rhubarb, 2c. sugar, 1 3oz box strawberry jello. Let cut rhubarb and sugar set a couple of hours (floats in its own juice), cook until tender, add jello, pour into jars and refridgerate. Great with bread and butter!

Having rhubarb in the garden forces me to use many different recipies. This one is good though I have made some adaptations. I use equal amount of rhubarb and sugar. 4 cups each. The rind of one orange - not the juice. Rind of 2 lemons with juice. I haven't yet put them up for the winter, but just keeping it the refrigerator. Freinds have enjoyed it.
