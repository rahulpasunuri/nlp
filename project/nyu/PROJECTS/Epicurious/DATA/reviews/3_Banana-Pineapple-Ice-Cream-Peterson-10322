This ice cream is so delicious and fresh! I had over-ripe bananas and over-ripe fresh pineapple a few days after Easter Brunch and was craving ice cream. I doubled the recipe without realizing that not everything would fit into my ice cream maker. I used 1.5 cups of fresh pineapple chunks, which I crushed with 2 whole bananas (and I kept the pineapple juices). I then doubled the amounts of heavy cream, evaporated milk and SKIM milk. I added 1/2 cup of fresh key lime juice as I didn't have lemons. I poured everything into the machine and realized I forgot the sugar. At that point I didn't have any left over room, so only used 1/2 cup of sugar (1/4 what I should have). The ice cream was sensational. It was not overly sweet because of the decreased sugar, and the fresh lime juice gave it such a refreshing flavor. It was also not that heavy since I used skim milk instead of whole milk. Obviously, I changed this recipe quite a bit to accommodate my pantry, but the end result was amazing. My husband and I were eating it straight out of the ice cream maker for about 10 min until we decided to finally freeze the stuff. I definitely recommend this recipe to everyone!

This was very good. I served it with Pineapple Upside-Downcake for a brunch. I suggest chilling the mixture in the refrigerator overnight before using the ice cream freezer.
