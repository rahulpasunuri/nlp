I really like horseradish mashed potatoes but this recipe was horrible. The potatoes looked grey since there was no butter or milk added. There is another recipe for these from Gourmet that is much better.

This was nice and different. But I think I still prefer more traditional mashed potatoes.

I added some grain mustard (just a little bit!) to up the spice factor. It went well with the horseradish. This dish is a great accompaniment to steak!

I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT ALTERINATIVE TO REGULAR MASH POTATOES !!! I'VE ALWAYS USED CREAM & BUTTER BUT THIS WAS VERY UNIQUE :-)

Very disappointed. Didn't enjoy these at all. Not bad - just not good! Lacked flavor (surprisingly). Also lacked the creaminess of "traditional" mashed potatoes. I used russets, skin on (my preference), which might have made some difference - but certainly not 3 forks' difference. Will try a different recipe next time.

These were very easy and very delicious. Followed recipe and it came out wonderfully. Didn't miss the butter or cream. The horseradish added a nice zing but was not overpowering. My picky eater children loved them. Made the potatoes with pork roast and a nice salad. Very easy dinner.

these are equally delicious when prepared with sweet potatoes. i made them for easter dinner and everyone was hippity-hoppity about them.
