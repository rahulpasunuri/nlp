The Salt content absolutely cannot be right - I had premium pork loin chops - way too salty - could not finish half the chop. Is the salt content correct? I followed recipe exactly.

Terrific brine. I brined overnight and went very easy on the rub. The flavor was perfect. However, grilling to 155 degrees was catastrophic. I would grill to 140 and then let it rest up to 155. Served for New Years Day dinner with collard greens with red onions and bacon (delish) and Hoppin John risotto. Even overcooked, the whole meal was a smashing success with my family (5 and 10 year old kids and hubby).

This recipe is absolute perfection. I served this at a Passover potluck (our in-laws call it "shlep-a-pot".) It got RAVE reviews...and it's so easy.

I'll start by saying that I made several deviations from the recipe. First, I didn't have cider so I subbed apple cider vinegar and reduced the salt by 1/3. Then I accidentally brined several hours longer than called for. Finally, I broiled the chops for about 40 minutes and then threw them in the oven at 375 for the remainder of the time. My initial reaction was that they were overcooked and salty. That said, my hubby and I were both gnawing on the bones at the end and he is still trying to convince me that these chops are a healthy alternative to bacon...I'll definitely try this again by reducing the salt, brine time, and grilling them.
