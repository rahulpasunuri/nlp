Didn't expect much, but had some Swiss chard that needed to be used up. This soup turned out beautifully. Would never have thought the combination of cumin and dill would work so harmoniously, but they did. The only slight change I made was to add 2 or 3 T of fresh lemon juice. A little acid goes a long way in brightening the flavours. Very good soup.

Added celery, turnip, and potato, and sauteed the swiss chard stems with the onion, carrot and celery.

Great base for a soup - I added chicken curry sausage and twice the amount of chard that the recipe called for. It was very good, but it still seemed to miss something . . . I'll experiment a bit more on the next round.

I used this recipe as a starting point and kept the lentils, barley, carrots, onion, garlic, broth, but then went in a slightly different direction. Inspired by the cumin, I added curry and turmeric and some fresh ginger root. Other changes: cooked with coconut oil, omitted the dill, added crushed red chili flakes and used kale instead of chard. The results were AMAZING! Everyone went back for seconds and still wanted more. This is definitely a new favorite for the winter!

i love the recipe and have made it a few times, adding chili flakes for a bit of a kick. it can be a little more on the stew than soup side, especially after the first few servings in which case i serve it over rice.

Follow up from previous review, I think it would also be really good with some sausage or chicken in it :)

I love this soup! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using dried dill because I didn't have any fresh. It freezes and reheats well, so make extra for a rainy day! I really liked the swiss chard flavor, so I'll probably add a little bit more next time. I will also probably add some chopped fresh tomatoes to up the nutrition level as I'm convinced canned vegetables have no nutritional value.

This was awesome. I really don't usually review recipes but this was so good I have to. I was worried that this might not have enough flavor so I added 1 extra sm garlic glove and an extra 1/2 t of cumin. I also followed others' advice and added a generous sprinkle of red pepper flakes. It was soooo good. I didn't even add the salt and pepper at the end b/c it really didn't need it. I also used kale b/c that was what I had on hand.

A great vegetarian recipe with a few modifications. Add leeks. Double the canned tomatoes and throw in a few fresh roma tomatoes. Add more garlic. Increase the barley and add a mix of lentils. Increase the swiss chard and the dill. Also throw in some tarragon . . . . A pretty forgiving recipe, and pretty dog gone good . . . .

I've been making this for several years ('05); it's such a healthy soup but I can't quite put my finger on what it is that I'm not crazy about. I've been adding celery and pureed garbanzos and usually use spinach not chard. Have used Kale once. Today I added some lemon juice from 1/2 a lemon which may be too much. I used 1 or 2 TBLS tomato paste instead of diced tomatoes. Also, some red pepper flakes and curry powder and NO dill or carrot. I used 1 cup lentils, 1/2 red, 1/2 green.

A fresh and hearty soup that makes it into our dinner menu rotation. Substituted pearled farro and 2 tsp dried dill because that is what I had on hand; used only 7 cups of water/veggie broth for a stew-like consistency. Added a dash of hot sauce at the end based on previous recs. Serve with a crusty bread or cornbread. A colorful delicious soup!

I followed the recipe pretty exactly, but chose to pressure cook the whole thing. I Added the veggies, the broth, the barley and lentils (I chose not to use the tomatoes and replaced it with 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to maintain acidity) and pressure cooked for 20 minutes. Once cool, I added the chard and I was done!

I absolutely loved this recipe, but I changed it a little bit. I added Ras El Hanout to the Cumin, 1/2 sweet red pepper, celery, and a small diced white potato to the veggies, and 1 Tablespoon of Tabasco sauce to the soup. Would suggest to anyone making this to try adding a little acid (like the Tabasco) to the finished soup--I think lemon juice would work, too.

Flavorful soup! I made only a few changes so I could use up some veggies I had in my fridge. I used 3 cups of leeks instead of 1 1/2 onion. Also, I added mushrooms to the onions and carrots and finished them off with 1/2 cup of vermouth before adding the garlic. Even added chopped beet greens to the chard. Came out lovely! Will definitely use again!!

Rating: 3
I used 8 cups of vegetable broth (2 @ 1 QT containers) & 2 cups water & it still had good flavor. The liquid cooked down to give it more of a stew like consistancy, so you could easily use more than 10 cups of broth if you want it more like a soup. Very hearty & delicious!

The variety of textures and flavors make this soup a meal itself. I have a garden with lots of fresh chard and dill, so I'll definitely be making more of this! The ground cumin is not overpowering and provides a nice balance to the earthy taste of the chard. The hint of dill gives it a nice finish.

This soup is hearty and delicious. The fresh dill is a key flavor element -- don't skip it. I am always looking for ways to incorporate greens such as chard and kale into my family's diet, and this soup is a huge hit with my husband. I'll be making it again!

This is a wonderfully flavorful soup. I did what the reviewer before me did (what a coincidence) and used beef stock and omitted the dill. Also, I didn't have canned tomatoes so I chopped up 2 ripe tomatoes and used them instead. What wonderful flavors! his is definitely a keeper!

First off, let me say that I hate people who post a rave review to a recipe they have altered beyond recognition. That said, I did use beef broth instead of chicken,because that was what was in the house, and omitted the dill. I think the soup that I ended up with is pretty much as was intended and it was fabulous. Probably the best soup of its kind I've ever made. A keeper!

My very picky family loves this soup. It doesnt sound like there is much in it, but it is actually quite hearty. My mom who is stubborn about her greens likes it. Don't feel guilty about having some buttered and toasted bread with all the veggies

Rating: 4
Very yummy and great on a rainy day. Increases in quantity I made: I put in 2 cups of onions, 4 cloves garlic, 13 cups of chicken broth (mix between regular and low salt), 2-14 oz diced fire-roasted tomatoes instead of the 1 can, and 1 cup of dried lentils. I also used 2 tsp of dried dill instead of fresh. The rest I kept the same. I cooked it a little longer so the lentils were softer. My 2 year old even ate it! :) With these increases, you can get a good 10 main course servings out of it. I also serve it with bread.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe. I followed it pretty closely but made two changes. I increased the amount of cumin to about 3 1/2 teaspoons or so, and I eliminated the dill (it just didn't sound right to me, for this soup) and instead added about 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper when I put in the lentils.

Rating: 4
Very hearty, healthy, and delicious. Doubled the tomatoes and used diced fire-roasted tomatoes as suggested. Skipped the dill since didn't have any on hand and add a little more garlic along with some low-fat turkey kielbasa for a one-pot meal. I was a little skeptical about the amount of cumin, but I thought it added a really great flavor. Didn't even need to add any salt or pepper. Next time I'll add a splash of red-wine vinegar at the end to brighten the flavors.

Very good and easy to make. I've made this several times. I use extra onions, tomatoes, garlic, and lentils, and increase the broth to 12 cups. Tried both fresh dill and dried dill and found about 2 teaspoons dried worked better than fresh. I freeze a bunch and reheat, which makes the swiss chard lose something, but it's still good. Delicious with white cheddar and a whole wheat roll on the side.

Delish! Made this exactly by the recipe, but with a little extra garlic and tomatoes (I think organic diced tomatoes make soup so much tastier). Used swiss chard and dill from the garden. I bought parmesan to use as a topping and sourdough bread for dipping, but after I had one taste from the pot, I forewent both and gobbled down two full bowls! Very satisfying.

Looking for ultra-low-fat, but still delicious recipes, I stumbled across this one. I love barley so it looked like a winner for sure. I increased the onion/carrots to 2 cups, and doubled the tomatoes, also added some celery while sauteeing the veggies. I made it with chicken broth but veggie broth would be good also. Definitely a winner! I wound up using a mix of red (much smaller) and green lentils and found that they really seemed to disappear among the barley which was a bit surprising. Next time around I'll use a higher proportion of green lentils.

british husband disliked this....said it was "too runny".....I cooked it because we received chard,dill and carrots in our organic veggie box this week, so it seemed the perfect time to try it! The soup itself tastes lots like chard, which can be a good or bad thing depending if you like it or not!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup which I made for the first time tonight. Used shallots instead of onions and didn't have dill on hand.

I was stunned at how good this soup turned out! However, I should note I made a few additions/substitutions. I added diced green pepper and celery to the sauteed onions and carrots for something closer to a classic mirepoix. For seasoning I lowered the amount of cumin to 2 teaspoons and replaced the dill with 2 teaspoons of smoked paprika and 1/2 teaspoon of smoked black pepper. I used a mixture of red chard and beet greens so that the greens would be a bit more tender and added one diced fresh tomato to the canned tomato. The changes in seasoning and a longer simmer time (I used purple barley and it required twice the amount of time stated in the recipe) made for a remarkably deep, rich flavor. This soup would do well in any 4 star restaurant.

I cut this recipe in half, but kept the same amount of canned tomatoes. I also added a pinch of chili flakes with the cumin. Really comforting soup.

Perfect with crusty bread for dipping

Wow! This was some of the best soup I've made in a while. I loved the dill/cumin combo flavor. What a great way to use that big bunch of swiss chard I got from my locally grown food buying club. It does need thinning at the end, but the recipe suggests it. It made six hefty entree sized portions.

Wonderful soup! Like many other readers, I, too, thought it would be a boring soup. It was great!

This makes such a substantial, delicious stew/soup! I watched the swiss chard at the farmers market all summer, hoping the crop would hold out so I could make this soup when it got a little cooler. Incredibly delicious, but a little too much for a humid summer day. I've been making this for the last 3 autumns, and it's become one of those fall meals my husband and I really look forward to with the changing of the seasons.

Delish with the following changes. As previously recommended, I used 6c. veggie broth and doubled the tomatoes. Instead of swiss chard (unavailable in any quality in January in NE)- Used 1 large bag of frozen chopped spinach which was v. easy. Also added some sauteed mushrooms in 1/2 T butter to which I added 1 tsp cumin and a splash of marsala to deglace pan. Rave reviews. Very filling. Stew-like because of the decreased broth content. Leftovers (hooray!) for tomorrow.

If I feel like eating barley I'd make this again but I would follow some other suggestions, such as doubling the tomatoes & halving the broth (actually I would add about 6-7 cups broth if I added more tomatoes). The tomatoes seemed to have the most flavor. For whatever reason mine turned out pretty bland, maybe due to old cumin or the fact I used collard greens instead of chard (none available). My boyfriend added Bragg's (like a soy sauce) and he liked it much better than I did. To be fair, I'd recommend giving it a try since so many others seem to love it ... I think black-eyed peas instead of lentils would have much more flavor.

This soup has become one of my family's all time favorites. I have made it four times in the past two months and it's so good every time. The cumin is essential in this soup.

This soup was great - nice and thick for the winter months. I fooled around with the spices - lessened the cumin, didn't have any dill, and instead used some paprika and oregano. I was worried that the vegetable stock would make it too salty, so at the stage where you add lentils I threw in a diced white potato and a diced sweet potato, which gave the soup a bit of a sweet flavor! Also, with just the 10 c. of stock combined with the additional potatoes, the soup was very thick -- so if you want a hearty soup, this is it!

I made a couple of minor changes -- doubled the tomatoes, halved the broth -- but WOW, what flavor! The cumin gives it a wonderful background warmth, and the chard nicely balances out the sweetness of the carrots. I used French green lentils because I think they have more flavor and hold their shape better than the brown ones. What really surprised me about this soup is how gorgeous it is (the picture here doesn't do it justice), with the orange carrots, red tomatoes, and green chard, it's like autumn in a bowl. A little parmesan cheese on top was a nice finishing touch.

Have made this soup twice to rave reviews. Very easy to prepare. For a nutrient boost, I substituted kale in place of the swiss chard. As I'm not a fan of dill, I simply omitted it.

Except for subbing spinach for the chard, simply because the store didn't have it, I followed this exactly as written. It's OK, but not great. No flavor seems to stand out, but the sum of the parts is no greater than the parts themselves. Everyone ate it, but no one raved. I love soup with barley, but I'll look for better ones in the future.

Delicious and healthy. The combination of flavors is excellent; very subtle and smooth. My lentils were still a little hard after cooking for 30 minutes, but it still tasted great!

This soup was amazing! I only added some fresh chopped parsley in the bowls, and served with warm crusty bread. Next time I will use more dill, it was overshadowed a bit by the cumin.

This was a great soup! I followed the recipe exactly - including the cumin and dill - and I wouldn't make any changes.

Delicious! Definitely better the next day after it had some time to meld flavors. I also couldn't bring myself to use the dill, so I used oregano and thyme instead. I think that gave it some great flavor. I also think this would be great if you used spinach in place of the chard. But a winner for sure.

This is a great winter soup recipe, and really easy to throw together. I didn't have enough swiss chard, so I added spinach. Didn't have enough cumin, so I ground up some coriander an cumin seeds and added that, along with a little tumeric. I really liked way the flavors popped out with each spoonful. This is a keeper.

I really like this soup, and it's very simple. I doubled the garlic, skipped the dill and used a can of organic tomatoes with green chilies. It makes WAY MORE than 6 main course servings - more like 10. It's going to take me forever to eat it all (4 large yogurt tubs, FULL!). I might have to give some away :( Don't skip the cumin, unless you don't want to smell like it all day like I do....(I shouldn't have left my laundry out).

I made this soup today and think it's terrific. The only change I'll make next time is to use less tomato so it'll have a more balanced flavor. Also not being a fan of dill, I used chopped fresh basil. This soup qualifies as a warming, comfort food that's chock full of veggies.

I read all the reviews AFTER I made this soup and with the exception of one other I can't understand what the fuss is all about. I did not like this recipe at all - maybe it's the cumin. I found it without taste - boring. I love barley, lentils, even swiss chard. I probably won't try to fix this one - just move on. There are lots of good soups out there.

Wonderful flavor! I thought that the cumin would overpower, but was suprised! Very hearty,great with bread for dipping.

A healthy soup that's high on flavor. My grocery store didn't have swiss chard, so I substituted spinach and it was excellent- especially good on a snowy evening in Buffalo!

Love this soup. Used rappini instead of swiss chard and fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Loved it. Will definitely make this often.

Very good - even the children ate it. Do chop up the stems of the chard. They cook like celery and can be put in earlier with the vegetables. They add a nice color to the soup too. Nice and hearty soup.

Everyone I shared this dish with want more. Will definitely make again. Wonderful for cold Winter lunch or dinner. Serve with garlic bread.

Very tasty. I would recommend having the extra stock on hand as it does thicken. I just added a little more water and it was fine.

This was really good. I used leeks instead of onions. The only thing I wouldn't do next time is use dill... it seemed distracting.

My whole family loved this ! My 6 year old asked for seconds ! I used the baby green lentils (available in whole food markets), and substituted baby spinach for chard as my market did not have any. I also added 1/4 tsp. Chipotle tabasco to underscore the smokey flavor of the cumin.

Made this the other day and let it sit in the fridge overnight, as I usually treat my soups, and it was really tasty the next day. My Hubby loved it despite the swiss chard. I will definitelymake this one again,

Great change of pace from my usual lentil soup which calls for ham bones or hocks.I added more barley and lentils than called for as I like a thick stew-like soup.I also used rainbow chard as that was what was available but can't see that it would change the flavor. I did leave out the dill as the cumin taste was sufficient for us. This is a definite keeper.

Excellent. Wonderful flavor and nice, hearty texture. The only change I made was to add a stalk of chopped celery to the onion/carrots. Will definitely make this again.

Very good. Substituted dried thyme for cumin (spouse does not like cumin)-- also added a bay leaf (pulled it out before adding the chopped greens), and some chopped red pepper in with the onion and carrots. Yummy. Will make again for sure.

I used escarole instead of swiss chard. Everyone loved this soup. Very hardy but essentially fat free and good for you. Great flavors. I thought the cumin gave it a great flavor.

This was excellent! I rarely have 2nds of anything, but this was really good. I did add some chicken to keep my husband happy and as I am allergic to onions, subsituted celery. He loved it...alot!!! Really one of the best soups I have made. The swiss chard is an interesting addition. It makes a large pot full, so great for another night or to share with others.

This soup sounds great, but I can't stand the taste of cumin! Does anyone have a suggestion for a substitute for it?

Rating: 4
This soup is easy to make, healthy, and really delicious -- the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts. I added more garlic and cumin, and found that a little squeeze of fresh lemon juice at serving time brightened the flavors -- but the soup is really good w/out it, too. Next time, I may chop my canned tomatoes a little more, as I would have preferred more and smaller pieces throughout the soup. Get some crusty bread with this one, and maybe a good cheese, too.

my husband and i loved this recipe. it was very unusual but great. used extra garlic and finely diced all my vegetables (except the chard) so it had a nice, thick consistency. Froze my leftovers. will definitely be eaten on a cold winter evening.

This soup is a little less than 4 Points per serving, under the Weight Watcher proram, and only extra 2 points if you're on the core plan. So enjoy!

Excellent! Made it just the way it called out in the recipe, although I was tempted to add more tomatoes. Letting it sit in the fridge overnight to let the flavors marinate. Expect it will be better tomorrow!

Excellant, hardy and easy. I increased the cumin as well as the garlic. I am a cilantro lover, so I added fresh chopped cilantro in place of dill. This is a husband pleaser.

Well, I haven't made it yet but am excited to try it. All my favorite ingredients. To the cook from Hong Kong, can you get spinach? That's a pretty similar green, but you don't get the stalks. And I would recommend "big" not baby spinach.

i'm going to try this recipe, and i'll substitute torn fresh spinach for the swiss chard. i've done it before for other recipes, and it works fine.

This soup is great and easy to make. I also used bok choy as we had it on hand. I might try spinach next time. I was hesitant about using cumin and dill (substituted 2 tsp dried for the fresh) in the same soup but they are subtle, and really enhance the flavor.

I have already made this soup 3 times. It is wonderful. I haven't been able to find swiss chard so I have been substituting with baby bok choy and it is is wonderful and very healthy. Freezes well.
