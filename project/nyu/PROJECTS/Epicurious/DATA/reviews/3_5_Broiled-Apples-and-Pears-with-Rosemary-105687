I used regular Olive Oil, not EVO, so it had a less intrusive flavor. I served with a wedge of really good blue cheese - it was the perfect mix on a watercracker. A great way to simply sample the seasons finest fruit!

You shouldn't cook extra virgin olive oil at this temperature (it will release toxins). Otherwise, delicious!

The evoo did add an odd taste. My guests liked it but I would pass. If I make it again I'm going to try it with a neutral vegetable oil and use it sparingly.

this did not turn out well for me. Bosc pears are not in season here so i used another type and maybe thats why but all and all there are no flavor and the evoo was very strange on the fruit. I brought it to a brunch and we had to through it out.

This makes a lot of servings! It says the recipe makes 12 servings. I think it would serve more like 15. You can cut the recipe back. I served with teriyaki pork. What a fab combination!

Excellent with Butternut Squash Lasagne or Broccoli Cheddar Soup. Incredibly easy to prepare and a nice surprise flavor-wise.

Excellent combo of tasty flavors. Perfect for a winter appetizer or dessert or companion to a main dish, perhaps one with cheese as an ingredient. Took about 15 minutes to do, start to finish.

Very good and easy. My husband even liked it and he's not into savory fruit. I'm making it again tonight with pork.

This recipe reminds me of how they serve meat in France. It was sooo good. I used granny smith apples and I don't even know what kind of pears they were but I served them over slices of a tri-top roast with garlic mashed potatoes and it was excellent!

Incredible!

The apples got kind of foamy during the cooking but were fine once they cooled. They held their shape well. I served them at room temp. Some guests liked them and some didn't.
