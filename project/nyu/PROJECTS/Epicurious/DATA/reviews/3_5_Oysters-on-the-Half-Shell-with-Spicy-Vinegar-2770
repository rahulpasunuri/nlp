This is the only vinegar we ever make to go with fresh shucked oysters! It is a hit every single time, and I always receive requests for the recipe. But I always say 'It's a secret!'

So good. Made two different toppings for the oysters and once people tried this one, the other got left behind. Delicious.

I haven't actually made this yet but just a question...Does the garlic overpower the taste of the oyster? Or should you strain the dressing before putting it on?

The spicy vinegar is great with Mussels as well. A staple in our house.
