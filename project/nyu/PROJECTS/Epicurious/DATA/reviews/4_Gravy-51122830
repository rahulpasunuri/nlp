With a slight tweak or two, easily the best gravy I've ever had. Everyone *loved* it, and I'll only make this gravy for turkey, probably forever. I like a gravy with some meaty texture, so I sauteed the turkey giblets in butter, then threw them in the blender with the meat from the roasted neck and a cup of stock. Also, you can save a step if you want to add wine, and just deglaze the roasting pan with it instead of reducing it separately. So delicious, and if you make the stock and roux ahead of time, it's nice and easy to pull together after the bird is done.

This gravy was AMAZING! I had never made turkey stock from scratch before, but it makes a huge difference in the taste of the gravy. I deglazed the pan with white wine and added it all in the gravy. I made it all in advance. This will be my go-to gravy recipe from now on.
