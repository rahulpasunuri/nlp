Wonderful recipe - we were lucky enough to find Valencia rice at our local asian grocery store and we did pop a few more shellfish on top, but there was more than enough to feed 6 people. We used actual paella spice, which added a smoky paprika as well and next time would use boneless skinless thighs instead of the breasts. Reminded us of being in Valencia....

A comment, not a review, since I haven't made the recipe. But really, how do you have a recipe that supposedly serves 6 but only calls for 4 shrimp, 4 clams and 4 mussels. Are people meant to arm wrestle for the seafood??
