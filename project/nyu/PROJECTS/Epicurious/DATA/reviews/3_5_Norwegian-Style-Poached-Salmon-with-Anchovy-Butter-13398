Excellent, can do poaching liquid ahead, anchovy butter also. Used center cut salmon fillets not steaks. Save onions to add to side (I used steamed broccoli) or another green vegetable. Only cook to 120-125 degrees, it keeps cooking after removing from hot liquid. Use sauce/sauté pan salmon just fits into and cover with liquid. We only needed 2 cups to cover fillets so saved rest and will freeze. May try with shrimp or another protein.

If you don't like sauerkraut, you probably won't like this, but if you do... yum! Double (or triple) all the spices, cut back just a bit on the sugar, use more anchovies, and def. eat the onions.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was my first time "poaching", I had doubts as it was cooking, but it turned great. Next time I will use more anchovies, just because I love anchovies.

Great dish. Absolute repeat. Could use a shorter cooking time.

For a totally inexperienced cook, this worked out great! I didn't even know what poached meant (had to look it up), but I made this recipe for my Norwegian dad on father's day and he loved it. One thing I would recommend is saving the onions (after straining the liquid) and serving them on the side. They were sweet, flavorful and delicious. Also, the Norwegian spinach soup on this website complements the meal well. That was our appetizer.

Used two fairly large tail sections. Had no white vinegar so I used white wine vinegar. Poached for about 6 minutes with truly spectacular results.

Fantastic recipe! Try it with a nice crisp vidal to complement the salmon. I can never find enough recipes with anchovies in it and it works well with the salmon which easily picks up more pungent tastes. One of the best poached salmon recipes I've tried.

yum. love that anchovy butter and poached salmon. it was nice and mushy the way i like my food. Turns out looking a little gray, but add some green food dye and it brightens right up.

I thought that the poaching liquid was a little dull and added little. However, this morning it struck me that I forgot to add the 1/4 cup of sugar! I used the anchovy caper butter sauce for salmon from another recipe on this site, and the sauce made the dish. My dinner guest gave this 3 forks, but I'm not convinced the sugar omission made that big a difference.

Very tasty. I used the butter recipe from the Salmon with Caper-Anchovy Butter on this site which is similar, but has some interesting ingredients. I also used cilantro instead of parsly because that's what I had on hand. ( I know I hate it to when folks change lots of things and rate the recipe ) The salmon itself came out very well. I'd make it again this way.

During one of my speed tests while in culinary school, I was required to find any salmon recipe as long as it was poached. The night before the test, I crammed the internet for the easiest recipe hoping that a miracle will happen and the chef instructors will like it. And guess what? I got an A! I added some capers on it though and a little anchovie oil just to get it kickin!

I wanted to do something other than grill salmon again. I love grilled salmon and do very well, but variety is the spice of life, so...I searched the file and found this recipe for a poached dish. Great, and I always have anchovies in the cupboard so I set to it, only to find I was out of anchovies! What to do? Substitute, of course! Really, I have rarely followed a recipe to the letter. I opened a can of "hot and spicy" sardines and mashed one up with unsweetened butter, a bit of parsley and a bit of thyme. The rest of the sardines made a nice snack with water crackers during preparation. The meal worked great, served with boiled new red potatoes and a tomato salad. The sauce was very tasty with a little picante hint. Next time I'll use anchovies but don't expect it to be better, just different!

My salmon-loving spouse rated this one of the two or three best salmon recipes in a whole bushel of them that we rotate. Atlantic salmon gave a special delicacy to the finished result.

I prepared this delecious dish on 10/22/99 for me and my son. We both enjoyed it very much. We eat a lot of salmon but never have enjoyed it as much as we did cooked this way. I pay particular attention to removal of all liver from the fish prior to preparation, this preserves the delicate flavor and removes some of the oils. The poaching per this recipe removed more of the oils and left a good flavor enhanced with the anchove butter. Thank for this recipe
