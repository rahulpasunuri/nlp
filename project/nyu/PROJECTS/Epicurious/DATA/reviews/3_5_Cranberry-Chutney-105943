This is the best cranberry side dish! My family doesn't care for regular cranberry sauce - and neither do I! - so this is a great find. It's wonderful on turkey sandwiches, on bread - and of course, on the Stilton Tart!

I love this in sandwiches with turkey, with roast chicken, with pork tenderloin, I've even given it as hostess gifts as so many have requested and raved...

This is the best cranberry relish we have tried... My wife has been making this for years, and it is a unanimous favorite!

Did not care for this at all.

This is one of my very favorite relishes for the holidays - easy and scrumptious. It keeps well and makes an excellent condiment for sandwiches. An all around winner.

This has replaced craberry sauce in our house! The best! Also, makes a unique filling for pastries.

This was a very good accompaniment to the Stilton Tart. I found the flavor and level of tartness a compliment to the aggressive blue cheese.

I found this chutney to be a delightful topping for the Stilton Tart. The sweet and tart flavors play well against the richness of the custard and sharpness of the Stilton. The sparkling color of the berries look great atop the pale tart.

Didn't love this as written. Made it again without the garlic (and we love garlic) -- I added 1/2 cup of sugar, some allspice, cinnamon, and a dash of cloves. Great and was a huge hit when it was reworked.

way too much vinegar taste. if you choose to make this recipe use only 1 Tablespoon vinegar and then TASTE to see if you and your family need more.

This chutney is wonderful. I used it to serve over a brie wheel baked in puff pastry.Our guests were enjoying it.

This was great!! I've only had the sugary kinds of cranberry sauces before, and decided to make something different this year for an early Thanksgiving potluck. I added a bit more garlic and red pepper flakes, and it went very well with the turkey. In fact, I think I'll make it again tomorrow to put in sandwiches for the next week. I'm never eating plain cranberry sauce again, if I can help it.

Very good and very easy. However, this recipe did not make 2 cups as indicated. I was making it to give as a little Chistmas gift to co-workers and came up short when it was time to package it. I added some ground walnuts to stretch it a bit. I also switched to a smaller gift container. I think the walnuts improved the texture and I will continue to add them. The beautiful deep color of the chutney was great in the clear glass mugs I used. Also, it took longer than 10-12 minutes for all the cranberies to "pop."

Really enjoyed this recipe. I do not have access to fresh or frozen cranberries, so made it with dried cranberries.Taste was great, but would like some feedback on how this would compare with fresh cranberries. Is it like cooking with sultanas when grapes are called for?

Excellent. Also used with the Stilton Tart -- great combo. Could cut recipe down, about by half, if only using with the tart. But the leftovers are tasty as a condiment.

This was excellent. The other recipe on this site for Cranberry Chutney (Gourmet, November 2000) is nearly identical and since it has more reviews, I'm writing my review there.

Made it to accompnay the Silton Tart and was great! Used the leftovers for the turkey dinner instead of cranberry sauce!
