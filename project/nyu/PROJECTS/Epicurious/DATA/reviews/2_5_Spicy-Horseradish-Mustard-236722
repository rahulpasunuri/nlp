I wish I had read the reviews before making this. I think the taste is great, but the consistency is definitely not like mustard more like a sauce. I will try again with more mustard as I think it has great potential.

This mustard wasn't good. I made it twice after thinking I screwed it up the first time because it was so horribly overwhelming. Even after sitting for 3 weeks, it's still so strong and I barely added any horseradish or garlic. Don't waste your time and money.

This recipe does not work. Neither the way it is written or the way it has been reviewed and changed. Forget it. Truly! I wasted so much money on the ingredients all for nothing. I would go with a hot and spicy mustard recipe...not this one.

Does anyone know if this recipe was corrected. The reviews confused me, and some are two years old.

I haven't made this yet but plan on doing so this week so it can be ready for Christmas. I found another site which said homemade mustard should keep (in well sterilized jars) for about 3 months. If giving as gifts it might be nice to put a "use by" label on it.

if not for the clear typo in the recipe, this gets 4 forks. i deleted the water altogether and stuck with 1 1/2 c. dry mustard with this last batch. i used brown mustard seeds and it is awesome! i've given it as gifts, used it with an antipasto platter and it was a hit. i never plan to purchase dijon mustards (any variety) again since i can make my own that is so delicious and fresh. my advice - MAKE THIS!!!

i agree with the reviewer from pocatello that there clealy is a typo here. i used 1 1/2 cups of dry mustard and had a thick, gravy-like consistency in the end. i will decrease the water next time and add more mustard seeds to thicken it further. the amount of horseradish may be a bit much for many people, especially when considering giving it as a gift so i will cut back on that and try a few different variations. i only gave it 2 forks because of the typo (which really shouldn't happen!) - the taste with the added dry mustard was really 3 forks. i plan to keep a few jars on hand for gifts "on the fly". one question - does anyone know how long this will keep? i'm thinking 1 year but the recipe doesn't say. (another key piece of info missing!)there will be a lot less store- bought mustard in my grocery cart from now on. fyi - quality spices in bulk for much less than at the grocery can be found at www.thespicehouse. com

Okay, I hate people who mess with recipes; but having read the reviews, I decided something was clearly wrong with this one. After a web search I found a recipe for German mustard with similar vinegar, water, dry mustard proportions to this one. The only difference between recipes was the reduction of the water/vinegar by half by boiling with the spices, onion and garlic contained in that recipe. I boiled the garlic with the vinegar and water and Eureka! I had the correct consistency 48 hours later. The flavor of this horseradish mustard is great, and I expect it will be well received when I give it as a gift. It would be great if the recipe's author would tell us whether the answer is more mustard, or reduction of liquid -- or whatever.

This recipe has a typo. I used 1 1/2 c dry mustard and it turned out great.

Mine is runny too. Very disappointing.

I too ended up with viniagrette. I can't imagine what would thicken it enough to qualify as mustard.

Is there something wrong with this recipe? I tried it and ended up with vinaigrette instead of mustard. What makes it thicken?
