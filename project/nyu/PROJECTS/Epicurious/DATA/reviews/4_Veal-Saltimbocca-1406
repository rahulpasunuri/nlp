Fantastic recipe... so easy and delicious beyond your wildest imagination! My only tip would be to pay close attention to the 2-3 minutes per side of browning. I cooked a little longer than that and wished I hadn't. Will definitely make again for a special occasion because of the WOW factor!

Can't imagine not using veal for this recipe. Ugh! My husband and I felt we were eating fine restaurant food. Didn't have any sage, but it was fine without it. Only addition I made was to add thinly sliced provolone. Served with fresh spinach sautéed with a little minced garlic. Additionally, made cavatappi pasta and sprinkled a small amount of grated hard cheese.

Yes you can do this with chicken pounded to 1/4". Always use Fresh Sage leaves and to balance the sauce add 1/2 cup heavy cream and simmer 'til it thickens. That way it will truly be delicious !

To save money, you can swap out veal for turkey medallions. check out http://feastonthecheap.wordpress.com

REALLY good, with a few changes. Here are mine: substituted turkey breast cutlets for the veal - just as tasty, and 1/3 the price; took the advice of the poster who used chopped fresh sage and garlic, and added Provolone cheese to the rolls. Spouse said this was a keeper, except for the sauce - WAY too much butter. I don't know how to fix that - any ideas?

This canbe a really great recipe if a few changes are made. I mashed 3 cloves of garlic into a paste and spread that on one side of the veal. I then added fresh sage leaves over the garlic. I placed the procuitto on top and secured it with toothpicks. I omitted the flour. I didn't fold the veal. More of the meat gets browned this way and the cooking time less than a minute per side when cooked in olive oil. This is such a quick, easy dish to make. With only a few ingredients, I would NOT use dried sage or skip using garlic.

So simple, but so delicious! The only thing we added was steamed spinach. I can't wait to fix it again.

I'm a bit against eating veal but since I couldn't find a recipe for chicken saltimbocca, I had no other choice. This recipe was very simple-- short prep time and short cooking time. There were very few ingredients so the flavor was uncomplicated, nothing that tasted over-powering. I only had a slight problem with the sauce because the dry wine that I chose was too bitter and had to think of something to balance it. I ended up putting in a bit of brown sugar and just a slight bit of rosemary and thought it worked well.

Gruyere is also a nice cheese and adds a different flavor. WAY too much butter though. 3-4 tbs makes enough sauce for two servings and doesn't get greasy.

This is a wonderful dish that I make over and over. Add a slice of Provolone or Mozzarella for added flavor. I also use chicken instead of veal. It's great!

This recipe was so easy and fantastic. I also added the mozzerella cheese and used snipped fresh sage. The flavors were wonderful. Highly recommended for company as you can do most of the prep work ahead of time.

SO delicious! A staple at an old Itaklian resteraunt in San Antonio - they always serve it over fresh cooked spinach - wonderful mix of flavors - definately special enough for company!

Easy and delicious! Highly recommended!!! I used Herbs de Provence instead of sage, and added Fontina cheese with the prosciutto.

Unbelievably delicious. I added mozzerella, both inside and on top and I used only 4 Tbsp butter for sauce. Otherwise followed exactly. Perfect.

This was really good. I miniaturized the saltimbocca rolls for a cocktail party. I made the rolls about bit-size, made them ahead, and placed them in a baking dish topped with the sauce. When I was ready to serve, I tossed the whole thing in the oven just to heat through. It was a huge hit. It is elegant and something different.

"Salt"imbocca is right! The proscuitto was really salty and so was the sauce. Too much for me. My husband on the other hand raved about it.

This was absolutely wonderful - my husband ate the leftovers two days in a row after the night I made it. I did do a little improvising, however. I used snipped fresh sage rather than dried and also added some thawed frozen spinach and mozzarella cheese to the veal before I folded it over. I added the rest of the spinach as well as minced garlic to the pan drippings and served this on the side. An easy, delicious dish - my husbands wants to know when I'll make it again!

I used marsala wine instead of white wine and it turned out terrific. I used the advise of another reviewer and only pinched the ends together, great presentation. will definately make again.

This is a wonderful dish! My guests at The Inn at Merridun in Union, SC Loved it. Be sure to use a good wine one that you would drink.
