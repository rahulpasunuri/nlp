I had to review this recipe. It is GREAT!!! My husband and I love it. It is easy and has such a unique flavor. We have mashed potatoes with it which is so good with the sauce. I have only changed one thing. One day after deciding,on the spur of the moment, to have it for dinner I was unable to marinate the chops overnight. I sprayed them with olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper and let them sit for a few hours in the fridge. They were delicious! In fact, we thought they were better than when marinaded. I plan on having this many more times in the future.

Delicious and very easy, though it takes a while to reduce the brine and especially the accompanying barbeque sauce. I used 1.5-inch chops and cooked them for 20 minutes. I had plenty of time to kill while the barbeque sauce was cooking down.

I pulled this recipe when it first appeared in Bon Appetit, and it has be THE summer pork chop recipe ever since. I have even done chicken breasts with the same ingredients (don't marinate as long as the pork) and they were just as great. The sauce is very spicy but our guests always love it!

Simply fabulous. The brine really complemented the pork and kept them moist and flavourful. I made Steve Raichlen's Barbecue sauce to go with it and served it with some roasted sweet potatoes dressed with a little olive oil and lime juice. Sublime meal.

Very easy marinade! I made as suggested, except with only 2 cups of water boiling. Added 2 cups of ice water to cool faster. Marinated for 4 hours. Cooked indirect on the Weber for 5 minutes / side... Super pork chops! Don't need any sauce (although I used some Stubb's Original, one of the best in the supermarket on the side). You won't be disappointed.

I can't count how many times I have made this...we love it. Works well with chicken too. The sauce is the key...I double or triple it and freeze portions for quicker meals later. Served for Easter (much more fun than ham) with April, 2003 Gratin of potatoes with tarragon and cheddar.

The marinade was great---brining the chops helped keep them moist and the thyme was a wonderful compliment. After I'd finished the barbecue sauce (and tasted it) I almost hated to apply it to the chops. Nobody was crazy about the barbecue sauce; it did have a smoky flavor, but otherwise was fairly bland. I'd do the marinade again, but not the barbecue sauce.

This brine keeps the pork tender and juicy, and I got raves at a party. I used another BBQ sauce recipe, as this one didn't appeal to me. The marinade is mild, yet flavorful.

This dish was fantastic. The pork was so tender and flavorful. I also made a black-eyed pea risotto to accompany it, which tasted extra good with some of the barbecue sauce. My company couldn't stop raving! Definitely a keeper!

I can't cook worth beans, but this meal turned out beautifully. All my dinner guests loved it and cleaned up every ounce of meat available. A definite keeper.

This recipe had so many good comments I was excited to try it. But my family did not like it at all. The pork chops were way too sweet. I will never make this again.

This recipe was fabulous! I took the suggestion of another cook and added 1/4 cup of vinegar to the marinade - also I didn't have any brown sugar on hand, so I substituted 1/4 cup of molasses with 3/4 cup of granulated sugar and it was wonderful. The day of the party I was too busy to make the barbeque sauce and was hoping for the best without it - everyone still raved about the taste of the marinated pork chops - I had marinated them about 28 hours. I can hardly wait to try this recipe on chicken - I think it would be great also. Even if you don't make the sauce, be SURE to make the marinade - you will love it!

My boyfriend who loves pork and barbeque raved about this dish. I also served it to friends who were equally impressed. The second time I made it, I did add 1/4 c. vinegar to the brine in order to tenderize the pork and this improved it. I also used raisins instead of dates and more garlic and onion. We loved the results. Great for company.

It was very tasty. However, I found the bbq sauce to be more like a sweet/tangy salsa. I enjoyed it very much.

A recipe that can be enjoyed equally as an outdoor event, or a more formal dinner setting. The combination of sweet and spicy was excellent. A nice spicy Austalian Shiraz was a perfect pairing.

This is a great recipe. It can be prepared ahead of time and the pork is moist and flavorful.

This is one of those recipes the household cook can prepare at home to make a restaurant caliber impression. This is a marinade with barbecue sauce recipe which produces tender chops with a complex and aromatic flavor. . .yet it's surprisingly easy. Serve this at your next barbecue and it will dress things up a notch.

I was never really enthusiastic about "North Carolina barbecue" but this recipe completely changed my mind. It's different from anything I've ever made and has been a big hit with family and friends. The dates in the barbecue sauce are truly unique.
