I made it exactly as written. Everyone loved it. I think it's going to be a Thanksgiving staple in our house!

Very good, however I mashed the potatoes instead of levaving as cubes (I like the texture better this way). I also added about 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar.

My family and I loved this recipe. I made it the traditional way the first time and have made it with gluten free rice bread twice (due to a family memeber w/ Celiacs). While the gluten free version is not AS good, I will continue to use both versions of this recipe as much as possible. I loved the comb. of flavors, esp. the way the french bread held on to the orange flavor. I also doubled the mushrooms and it was perfect!

I served this with roast goose with pomegranate sauce-- a perfect foil. Yes, I made a change. Instead of doubling the mushrooms as advised in a previous review, I reconstituted a half supermarket package of porcini in water, then chopped them and used the soaking water instead of the chicken broth. I also used dried thyme-- it has better staying power than fresh when baked. As a plus, it's not too bad for a non- medicated diabetic.

This will be come a Thankgiving staple at my house. It's the perfect combination of crunchy and soft and has excellent flavor. Next time I'll double the amount of mushrooms.

We made this and the apple sausage stuffing which was excellent. The sweetpotato stuffing however was bland and needs some tweaking.
