great tasting and easy to make. I added 1 tablespoon of chili pepper sauce from Trader Joes's because the original recipe lacked a bit of flavor. Good quality sharp cheddar melded very nicely with the chili pepper sauce kick.

Blech!!! The cumin totally ruined this soup (and I love cumin). Overpowered not only any hope of tasting the nice cheddar cheese but the broccoli too, and that's sayin' somethin'... Sad waste of good ingredients.

Wonderful soup! I made it with an Idaho potato because thats all I had so the cooking time was a little longer. Added 8oz of cheese and left out the Cumin. Will be making it again soon.

Delicious. This recipe replaces another broccoli cheddar soup I've had in my collection. I only tweaked it a bit: used nearly a pound of broccoli, 4 cloves of garlic, and half milk & half cream. That said, I suspect this recipe is fairly flexible and could take any number of individual touches.

This soup was a hit with the whole family. I've made it twice now, and everyone loves it. I will definitely make it again and may try some of the variations others recommend (though I must say the soup is quite good as is).

My roommates and I really enjoyed this robust soup. I added diced jalapenos (pickled) when I added the cheese and half and half (rather than cream). I also added chopped zucchini to up the vegetable quotient, and then also added a large can of cannellini (white) beans towards the end too to give it more protein. I put in less than 6 oz of cheddar to lower the fat. Would definitely make it again when I want a hearty soup.

This is the best new soup recipe I've tried in a long while. I added much more garlic (as that's what I like), left out the cumin (I didn't want any similarity to Mexican or Chili) and used half & half and 8 oz of cheese. Next time I will use more broccoli and add a small bit of smoked cheddar.

Followed the recipe except used whole milk instead of heavy cream. I also by accident blended all the soup along with some of the broccoli florets. I was very surprised at how delicious the soup was. I used a very sharp cheddar (cloth bound cheddar) which gave the soup a great flavor. I will make this soup again.

This was great - I will definitely make it again. My husband was not too excited to hear that we were having "broccoli soup", and even he loved it. I made it pretty much as directed, though I left out the flour, as some reviewers said it wasn't necessary. Next time, I will put it in because I would have preferred it just a touch thicker. It was delicious, though!

This was an easy, delicious soup to accompany the crab-stuffed mushrooms we had ready to go. Like others, I used 1% milk instead of cream - and I left it chunky since I don't have a food processor. It was absolutely yummy and it will be a recipe I have on standby for the future!

This Chowder is FABULOUS! There is no need for the cream. Leave it out and save yourself some fat! Only other difference I did was use 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. I also made a double patch. It was a great way to use a large head of broccoli from my garden!

This was quite good. I took others' recommendation and added a Serrano pepper as well to the soup. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I think that the next time I make it I will cut out a bit of the fat by using milk instead of heavy cream.

This was very good, but I, like some others, ultimately felt there was something missing. It might be better with a little bacon, as one reviewer had suggested. Also, I pureed the soup with about half of the broccoli florets, saving the other half to add at the end whole. I thought this gave the soup a nicer broccoli flavor.

This is solidly good, but next time, I would add a "kick" similar to what other reviewers recommend. Chipotle, red pepper, or green chilis would be great. Maybe even fresh basil, or white wine... it needs something to cross the threshold to "fantastic" for me. As a reviewer recommended, this was enhanced by crumbled bacon, added before serving.

This was wonderful. Didn't have heavy cream on hand and had to substitute with a little bit of skim milk and a corn starch slurry. Also used some mild cheddar and muenster in place of the sharp cheddar prescribed in recipe. Excellent result served with fresh bread. Yum.

I cooked 4 ounces of bacon, used some of the drippings instead of butter, and added the bacon just before serving. I also used evaporated skim milk instead of cream to save on additional fat (having already used bacon). This was an immediate family favorite and will show up on rotation during broccoli season.

This is so tasty and colorful! I'm not a fan of very rich soups so I upped the potato and garlic a bit, subbed olive oil for the butter, cut the cheese in half, and added a splash of buttermilk (try starting out with a couple of tablespoons and add more to taste) instead of cream. Simple and satisfying.

Rating: 4
Really simple and really yummy. I ended up having to make a second batch of this because everyone loved it so much! I ran out of red bell pepper for my second batch, but I thought it was just as good as the first. I didn't bother pureeing the soup - I thought it was fine with a bit of texture to it. (I did chop the vegetables as finely as I could) I also threw in some frozen spinach and corn which I thought made nice additions. I used chicken broth instead of the broccoli water, as others had suggested also. Lastly, I threw in a good amount of crushed red pepper to add some heat to the soup. Deeeelicious (I'm happily eating some leftovers as I type this)

hi...just made this. yum. if you like broccoli cheddar, this is a good one. I accidentally threw almost all of the broccoli water out, so I used about 1/2 chicken broth...was fine. also doubled the garlic and the mustard powder and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream cuz i was too lazy to go to the store :) whole family loved it...it's in the mix for regular recipes.

Super good- tastes so decadent and cheesy, excellent with a hunk of bread on a cold night. I replaced the whipped cream with an equal amount of pureed silken tofu (certainly didn't notice any tofu flavor). This tastes too rich for me to have regularly, but as a special comfort food, it's tops.

Excellent recipe as is, even better with some minor changes! I made it the first time as is, and it was very good.

I sub 6-7oz tofu for the cream and butter. Turned out great. Same creamy texture, with less fat!

I made this the way I make many cream-of-vegetable type soups: omit the cream and puree in a block of soft tofu instead. I have nothing against cream, I just like to up the protein in vegetable-based soups, and the tofu mimics cream so well that there's no need to double up. I did increase the butter a little for flavor and mouthfeel. My kids were sure they weren't going to like it, but they all ate it happily. This is a nice version of cream of broccoli soup -- dry mustard gives it some depth and zing. I'll be putting it in my regular rotation.

This recipe is a keeper. I've made it many times and the result has always garnered rave review from friends. I always use extra-sharp white cheddar and half and half instead of cream. I also add more potatoes and broccoli than the recipe calls for. No real need to peel the potatoes if you scrub then well. This soup reheats nicely for lunch in the microwave.

This soup is pretty good, but I felt the red pepper flavor kind of overwhelmed the soup a little, If I made it again I would probably half the red pepper and make up the difference with jalapeno or chipotle peppers. I served it with a dollop of sour cream and a splash of hot sauce on top.

I used a very small potato and no flour, and just doubled the broccoli (possibly tripled... I wasn't measuring) to make up the density. Then I used light cream (have also used whole milk to good results) and no butter, and it's STILL awesome. Add some "smokey chipotle" tabasco, and you don't miss the fat.

Reading the variations to the recipe suggested so far was really helpful. I doubled the recipe, used roasted red pepper, substituted vegetable broth for the broccoli water, and substituted beer mixed with half-and-half for the cream. Topped it off with croutons. Everyone in the family went for third helpings. This would be a great recipe for a party.

Rating: 3
Made this for the third time tonight. Defrosted 7 oz. of broccoli florets and added them at the same time as the potato (increased the potato to about 12 oz. of russet). Increased the spices proportionately. Subbed low salt, fat-free chicken broth for the broccoli cooking water, and 2% milk for the heavy cream. Even though I thickened it at the end with a combo of flour and milk, it remained a bit liquid. But my family loved it, esp. because of no heavy cream. (Also, I did not blenderize anything, as we like to see the veggies in our soup.)

Rating: 4
Great recipe! My roommates loved it. I used roasted red peppers from the jar. Pepper jack with the cheddar. And instead of tabasco (which was recommended) some sriracha which is hot chili sauce. And added a little more salt and pepper to my bowl. My roommate, on top of that, put tapatio in her bowl. That was yummy, too. It just depends on ones preference for spicy.

to the cook from Toronto..When I make a veggie soup, it's all vegie.No meat.Fresh vegies,and right seasoning is all you need.especially if it is pureed.I dropped a fork, because flavour was adjusted with meat.For me vegie is vegie.At the end i would add 35% cream, but if you are calorie conscience, then add 2% concentrated milk.Works and tastes great, with no mea culpa.

I made this recipe with chicken broth, as others did, and just put all the broccoli in together and blended the veggies together before adding the cheese. I love a pureed soup, and this freezes well--put in the cheese when you defrost. A gem of a recipe!

One reason to use the water is to preserve the nutrients from the broccoli. Plus it is already there--no extra cost. I have not tried it with the broth since I absolutely love this soup, using cauliflower instead of potatoes.

Does anyone know why the recipe calls for using reserved cooking water instead of chicken broth? Could the purpose simply be to make this suitable for vegetarians? I'm wondering if anyone has made the soup with the water one time and the stock at another time, and what the results were. I noticed many people substituted stock right from the get-go, but I'd like to find out if someone has made both versions, what the differences were, and which was preferred. Thank you!

I modify most recipes to accomodate my cholesterol challenged husband. I used jarred roasted red pepppers, steamed the broccoli for 3 minutes, and instead of the water, added 3 cups of veggie broth. To avoid the fat in the cream, I drained and rinsed a can of white kidney beans and finely pureed them in the blender before adding them to thicken the soup. I added the broccoli and pureed the whole thing with my new immersion blender. Added tabasco at the end, and it was the ultimate lowfat, high fiber alternative. Everyone loved it!

This soup is amazing! I've been looking for a good chowder and this is it. I made two changes to reduce the carbohydrates: cauliflower instead of potato and no flour. The consistency was fine without the flour since the veggies were pureed. The only problem I had was with the cheese--I think I added it too fast and it clumped a little bit. I am going to make another batch tonight, adding the cheese in smaller bits and melting well between each addition.

After finally buying myself a stick blender, I went searching for a good pureed/creamed soup recipe and settled on this one. YUM! I used a little more broccoli, a little less onion, condensed milk and only 1/2 tsp of cumin (could still taste a hint of it in the soup. I also used chicken stock instead of the vegetable water and a few shaikes of tabasco as has been suggested. This is a very flavorful soup. Someone mentioned the addition of shrimp ... I could definitely see that, but I'm thinking 2 or 3 seared scallops added to each bowl at serving time would be really good. This soup is wonderful just as it is ... but it could easily be used as a sauce of chicken, shrimp or scallops and white rice.

Made this again with the Cook from Ogden, Utah in mind. Completely forgot to toast & grind the cumin, but did use half & half. Also did the flowerets as he suggested & perfect. HOWEVER, my son bought me a soup blender when I mentioned wanting one. He bought the best he could find on the internet & the darn thing is still in it's box. He sent me a restaurant quality blender that is twice the height of my soup pot. I would literally have to stand on a footstool to use it! We have a good laugh every time the subject comes up. I used my hand potato masher to partially puree. Bottom line, I prefer the soup with low fat milk instead of half & half. Still great!

I made this in a big hurry at the last minute and it came out very well. I didn't have exactly the right ingredients, so I improvised. The recipe was very forgiving and flexible. I used five small red potatoes, half a bell pepper, additional garlic and regular old yellow mustard. I also added tabasco and used chicken broth instead of boiling water. I steamed the broccoli (retains nutrients much better) and did the stems and florets together. I did not have any milk or cream on hand, so I just omitted it. I used extra cumin, garlic powder and high quality cheddar. Overall the soup was a hit. I'm sure the cream makes for a much richer soup, but I was perfectly happy without the extra fat. Next time I will puree a larger portion, just leaving a few chunks of vegetables.

I thought this was great, but I made some changes based on other reviews. I used chicken stock as the liquid, cut the cumin in half, and doubled the potato.

I made this soup on a cold day. It warmed everyone up and they loved the taste. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and didn't have dry mustard so I skipped it. Also, as a time saver I skipped the whole process of blanching the broccoli. I just cooked it with all the other veggies and pulled it out when it was finished cooking to be added at the end. This is a new soup staple for my family.

You won't find any much better than this one. Just a couple of suggestions - (1) Use more potato, (2) Use a really good quality of cheddar, and (3) Feel free to use a 10 oz. pkg. of frozen broccoli florets. Just steam them until them separate, quick cool, and chop. After that, use as this recipe suggests.

I thought this was just so-so, but was overruled by my family which loved it. I made two changes to the recipe.

Second, I used chicken broth instead of water.

My husband and I loved this chowder. Unlike a few reviewers, we didn't find it thin at all. It was quite creamy and thick. I did use evaporated milk instead of cream, and I used some red hot pepper, ground, in it, just two shakes of the container. The cumin was not overpowering. In fact, we couldn't taste it at all. I will definitely make again, maybe at Thanksgiving. If you want it with less calories and fat, change it, but don't complain because the original recipe is loaded with calories and fat. Just do your own thing with it, although, from some of the reviews, what some have made is definitely not the same recipe and shouldn't be rated as if it were.

A very healthy and easy soup with a few changes. Saute garlic, onion and red pepper in soup pot in some olive oil, then add the broccoli and potatos to the pan. Cover everything with either vegie or chicken broth. Use slightly more mustard, lots more cumin and pepper; skip the cream and cheese. Cook til potatos are tender, add a drained can (or frozen bag) of corn, then a can of creamed corn to thicken it a bit. Serve with crusty whole-grain bread. This is a staple for my family!

What a joke. Often, the best recipes here are the ones that can be modified for personal taste. But there isn't a single reviewer here that followed the recipe. No cumin, I can understand, because some folks are sensitive to it. But then they add cilantro as a garnish? Does anyone understand the connection between cumin and cilantro? And to accidentally puree the whole soup? Is anyone paying attention here? Someone added bay shrimp? Hellooo! Earth to Epies! (just joking) This recipe intrigued me. As usual, made it as designed once. Wonderful. Then added (by suggestion) tabasco in the next batch. More wonderful. Ok, heck. Added bay shrimp in the next. Ok, ok. It's the perfect modifiable ODD chowder recipe. You can do almost anything with this idea. The basic idea is perfect. You go, all you Epies! Modify away! It's odd, but it's perfectly odd. The basic idea is wonderful! Recomendation - Don't make this until you have read all of the reviews. There are a lot of good cooks here. Get a feel for what they are doing. The recipe is darn good.

This was a tasty one! I didn't follow the recipe EXACTLY, so I guess it's not fair to rate it. I left out the cumin, since it's my least favourite spice--smells like B.O. I replaced it with a little cayenne pepper and a little cilantro as garnish. I also added some cauliflower as was suggested by someone. It's good! I recommend pureeing (?) a little more than suggested. Next time I'll experiment with a different kind of cheese. I also didn't use the broccoli water and replaced it with chicken stock and didn't add salt until the end. I'll bet it's pretty good exactly as the recipe calls for too. Did anyone consider adding jalapenos?

Rating: 3
Make this recipe! Okay, don't make this recipe exactly unless you like cumin soup. If you avoid some of the bone headed directions, you'll produce a noteworthy dish. First, use no more than 1/2 tsp WHOLE cumin, toasted and ground. Don't waste another pot boiling broccoli. Just pour boiling water from a kettle over the florets 3 min. prior to adding, then drain and dump. Using at least 2 cups good chicken stock in place of water seriously improves the soup (be sure to adjust salt accordingly). Also, half and half works brilliantly if you don't want heavy cream. And finally, if you don't own a hand blender, it's time. There's really no reason ever to remove hot soup to a blender. None of this really alters the heart of the recipe, but it makes it a one pot affair with balanced flavor. Serve it with a pecan, shaved parmesan, and blood orange green salad and you have an awesome one-hour dinner.

I simplified & did not parboil the flowerets. I used more broccoli & peeled the stems. I used 3 Tblsp flour because I used low fat milk instead of cream. Sauted everything then added 3 cups water. I pulled out the flowerets about half way through, used a potato masher in the pot to partially puree & added the flowerets at the end. I thought the consistency was perfect, not too thick & not to thin. My only complaint is that there was not enough. Great soup, will make again & may try cauliflower.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe to cook for a crowd. It was a hit. Perfect for autumn, though the consistency was thinner than I'd expected. Perhaps a little more flour or longer simmering?

Yummy! I used 3 oz cheddar and 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano. I also increased the garlic to 3 cloves. We definitely would make this again!

This was great. I made a few changes to make it lighter and healther: used nonfat milk and 2 tbps lowfat sour cream instead of heavy cream- used a spoonful of stone ground mustard since I didn't have dry on hand, added 1/2 tsp of tumeric for color and zip. Rave reviews!

A very good recipe. You can easily cook the broccoli in the soup, added after blending but before the cheese and cream, which prevents the nutrients from being lost. Added 3 cups veggie stock instead of broccoli water and half-fat creme fraiche instead of cream.

The cook from Bellingham is right; this soup does taste just like a baked potato! I doubled the recipe for a potluck at work, but after I tasted it I loved it so much that I kept it for myself instead! Chopping all the vegetables was very time consuming (maybe just because I doubled the recipe) but well worth it.

MMMMM. This soup was delicious comfort food. It is easy to make, and perfect for a cold weather meal. It is a little rich, according to my husband, who thought it tasted like a baked potato with everything (minus the bacon). To me, that was a good thing, and I loved it.

Very tasty! Definitely measure the cheese by weight, not volume. I grated three loose cups of cheese (I was making a double batch), and the soup was definitely a little thin. I just added more cheese.

I made this over the weekend after seeing the recipe on Epicurious and then in the new Gourmet cookbook. This soup is SO GOOD. I substituted chicken stock for 1/2 the broccoli water, but I don't think it made much difference because the soup was so flavorful. My husband, who has little tolerance for any meal not consisting of a Big Meat entree, ate two big bowls of this and was happy for the rest of the night. I ate three and kept trying to somehow make room for more...

Rating: 4
Oh, this was SO good! Since we were using left-over broccoli, we followed the suggestion of others and used 3 cups chicken broth in lieu of the broccoli water; it helped give it more substance. Also, to make it more "low carb," we used a small turnip and a couple small "white creamer" potatoes (basically a 1/4 pound each). We stuck with the heavy cream per the recipe, again to keep the carbs low. Also, we pureed all the chunks, not just half. The texture was perfect. We planned this as a side dish, but wound up having seconds on the soup and all-but-ignoring the main event. A hearty but elegant dish!

Excellent. I used frozen broccoli florets, added a carrot and put all the veggies in the food processor. Very easy. Can be made ahead up to the point of adding the cheese/cream/florets.Once the stock had cooled I purreed the entire amount,It gave it great color. I also used potato water and chicken broth in place of the broccoli water. I also used half and half 1/2 c and 1/4 milk in place of the cream.

This is a nice cold winter night meal. I skipped the blanching part and just steamed the florets lightly in the micro for about 2 min 30 sec. Then I followed the saute directions as written, but instead of the broccoli water, I used three cups of organic chicken broth, and used f/f half and half instead of cream. I pureed the whole pot with my stick blender, and added the cheese at the end. I don't think I used a full six ounces of cheese, but it was still really, really good. I used additional cheese and oyster crackers to garnish at the end. Even my picky kids ate it and my son hates EVERYTHING!! Nice with a mixed green salad and popovers fresh from the oven.

this was easy and good. i added corn and orange, yellow, and red bell peppers that i roasted first. i skipped the cream and butter, which was really not necessary, to make it a very low fat soup. i added different cheeses that i had on hand, such as monterray jack and brie, and cut that way back too to cut fat and calories. tastes great!

Really, really good. If you know a cheese lover, make this! I made a few changes; I left out the potato (low-carb diet), used broth in place of 2 Cups of water, left out the salt, and used 8 ounces of cheese. Having left out the potato, I was worried the soup would be too thin, but it was fine. As another reviewer said, the broccoli stayed bright and beautiful, and was not mushy at all.

Yum! Forget about all that pre-boiling. I throw it all in the food procesor and then into the pot with all lid until tender. I also added white wine and chipolte pepper as well as tons more garlic.

Since I like to simplify recipes, I nuked 6 oz. frozen chopped broccoli until done and then added it to the pot just before adding the cream and cheese. Added a bit more cumin, 1 tsp. chopped green chili pepper, increased the black pepper to 1/2 tsp., and also replaced the broccoli water with low sodium chicken broth. Added no salt ever. Made a boo-boo and used 1/2 c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. 2% milk. Probably, since I used too much milk, I had to use extra cheese to make it taste nice and cheesy. Used 8 oz. Kraft Extra Sharp Cheddar cheese. Did not use a blender at all: at the very end I thickened it a bit with 1 Tbs. flour mixed with a small amount of water. This recipe is WONDERFUL, but you must love cheese!!! I will make this over and over, just as I made it this first time. DO TRY IT!

This was all in all a very good chowder, however next time I will reduce the onion. I thought it overwhelmed the broccoli quite a bit. Cumin works well with this... don't skip it!

I have made this recipe at least ten times and my family always loves it. I omit the red pepper as it is not my husands favorite but otherwise follow the recipe to a tee. Everyone who has ever had it loves it. Do not be afraid of the cumin as it is stands up beautifully to the strong brocolli flavour. This soup also tastes even better the next day.

Suprisingly good. I didn't have an mustard so I ommitted that, and I was too lazy to grind the cumin so it went in whole, but other than that I followed the recipe verbatim. I didn't substitute broth for the broccoli water, and it turned out fine. I found that the water, when cooked with the rest of the veggies, became like a broth anyways. I will definitely make this again.

Very nice soup. My girlfriend and I made a batch for our weekly "naked dinner" and it turned out great. I put in extra potatos to thicken it up to reduce the risk of spilling the hot soup, and used vegetable stock rather than the broccoli water. There is no need to blanche the broccoli florets beforehand if you use stock: just toss them into the hot soup 2 or three minutes before serving.

This was exactly what I was looking for in a Broccoli Cheese soup. Made to recipe, this is not your typical puree'd 'stand up to a spoon' resteraunt style fare. If you're expecting that, as I think some of the reviewers were, it might not be for you. But if you take your time and cook in layers as suggested, you'll end up with a delicious BrocChed with a bit of a unique flavor thanks to the cumin and red peppers. It presents well due to the red pepper and the intact veggie's. I made it to spec except for 8oz of cheader instead of 6oz and the addition of some cualiflower florets. I might try a broth instead of water next time. And, I'll cut my potato a bit smaller.

This is a good and easy cheddar-broccoli recipe. I had no peppers, so ommitted and added an extra potato. Used more broccoli, and sauteed all in butter, then boiled in water as i couldn't be bothered wth the ice-stage. Added a sprinkle of cayenne to compensate for lack of pepper, and used whole wheat flour. All in all, very good starting point. Next time I might add chicken breast and garden-herbs.

I've made this soup twice now. The second time I just chopped all the veggies (except the broccoli florets) very finely in the food processor and went from there. I didn't have to puree the soup and it was nice and thick with a uniform look and a good chowder consistency, probably from the chopped potatoes. I even had to thin it with some more broccoli water and cream. The first time I made it I used an immersion blender for just a second and didn't like the look of some small and some larger pieces of the veggies, especially the red pepper. I also used a can of low salt chicken broth and the rest broccoli water. Cut salt, mustard and cumin in half. Probably used closer to 2 cups of cheese. My family was very happy with the result.

This soup was so wonderful. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I though about omitting the cumin because my boyfriend doesn't like it, but I love cumin. I left it in, and he asked me what was in the soup. I just said: "Is it good? yes, then don't worry about it." It did turn out a little thin, I could have reduced the amount of water since it did produce more than 6 bowls.

Very nice; however, I just don't see how cumin (and I reduced the amount to about half) belongs with broccoli and cheese soup. I will omit this and reduce the mustard as well. I also wouldn't bother the the extra mess and hassle of pureeing the soup... it's fine as is. I only put in just under half a cup of cream and that was plenty rich. But I did use about 2 cups of cheese, 2 garlic cloves and replaced the water with chicken stock. Quite a bit of prep involved but colourful and hearty results... veggie soup that eats like a meal!

Whole family enjoyed this chowder, even non-brocoli eating 4 year old! I used the new fat-free half and half (Land O Lakes brand) to replace the heavy cream. It tasted fine with all the spices and saved us a few fat grams. I did add some chicken broth and didn't bother to cook the florets separately. Just threw them in the soup during the last few minutes of cooking. As good as this was, it was fabulous the next day for lunch.

This is delicious, cumin and all. I doubled the recipe (a husband and two growing boys with sophisticated palates) and used 2 parts half 'n' half to 1 part skim milk. It was still very rich. Since the soup was cooked ahead of time and kept warm, I also withheld the broccoli and added it to the bowls before ladling in the soup. There's enough left for the Thermoses tomorrow. Follow the recipe (use the broccoli water) and the soup is sublime.

I thought this soup was fantastic (made it for the first time in January)! I have some suggestions for the disappointed reviewers: (1) cut vegetables in small pieces (you can even overdo it!) (2) Really salt the water when you cook the broccoli (3) Add the salt in the recipe when instructed to do so; waiting till the end is not the same, and (4) don't shortcut any of the steps/stages of cooking the various ingredients; its the "layering" that imparts flavors, and (5) cook the broccoli in a small amount of water, and use some sort of vegetable broth as the base for the soup (I happened to have potato broth on hand from making mashed potatoes); this too will give you more flavor. Lastly, a word to NJ, OK, so it wasn't your favorite, but you couldn't even serve it for dinner?! I mean, I think you might be exaggerating a bit? I try to remember that none of us is perfect and neither are recipes; that way I enjoy cooking more. Nobody likes a grumpy cook!

I was also disappointed after all the raves. Soup was thin in both texture and taste, but I know it could be greatly improved with some vegetable boullion and more potatoes. The broth just doesn't have enough flavor, even with the cheese.

Aw, gee, what a bummer! Cannot understand the raves. Caught my eye because I love broccoli cheese soup, and had all ingredients on hand. Followed the recipe to a "T", except for adding a carrot for extra veggies and using 1/2&1/2; also used immersion blender before cream, cheese, & florets. The cumin I feared would be overwhelming disappeared, but so did all flavor altogether! Tasted 4 times; very, very bland. How to rescue? Was supposed to be tonight's supper; now I'm scrambling to play catch-up. Needs something with a jolt of intense flavor...crumbled bacon? Freshly grated cheese? Hot sauce? Sigh. Win some, lose some -- mebbe it'll be better by tonight.

Really good soup. Changed just a few things to make it a bit easier - didn't use ice water to stop cooking broccoli (just took them out of water after about 2 minutes), used immersion blender to blend mixture (just a bit, though) before putting cream and cheese, followed by broccoli florets. Made enough for full serving one night, next night only had about 3/4 bowl for each of us. I would suggest adding just a bit more potato, broccoli, liquid to make sure you've got 4 full bowls!

This is an easy and delicious chowder. I prepared it as directed except that I made it ahead of time.

A soup perhaps with a personality crisis: "chowder" evokes New England, while the cumin/pepper/cheese combo to me seems southwestern.

This soup was superb! Reserving the boiled florets at the start prevents the broccoli from being mushy. It was refreshing not to have to resort to standard chicken broth as a base. The red peppers add a nice twist. My new favorite. It reminds of Sunday afternoons and Packers football games when I was a kid.
