I agree with everyone who says too much salt. I thought it was because people were using table salt instead of coarse salt. Because if you substitute table for coarse you need to cut the amount in half. But even with coarse salt, it is way too much. I would cut it in half for coarse and 1/4 for table.

This was awesome! I was only doing 3 steaks, so I halved the recipe. I used about 3/4 tablespoon salt with the half recipe and it was perfect. Using all the salt called for would have been WAY too much. I also didn't have cloves, so left those out and added smoked paprika. It was delicious! I also only used about 1/4 of the rub on the steaks or I think it would have been too strong. But now I'm going to try the rest on chicken! I only give the recipe three stars because of the wacky salt.

I prepared the spice rub and marinated the steaks, then cut them into cubes and grilled them as shish kebbos with fresh veggies. Served with jasmine rice and the veggies instead of the salsa, and it was fantastic! The meat was incredibly tender, sweet and flavorful.

I have made this resipe several times, everytime with raves from my guests. It is my go to steak marinade recipe now. I actually add olive oil (instead of corn oil) and marinate the steaks overnight. I have not made the salsa yet, but think I will try for my next dinner party!

We enjoyed this reipe. Based on reviews, i cut back on the salt and wish I hadn't because the rub was not 'balanced'. It was too heavy of the other spices. The vegetable salsa was good but fairly time consuming for the result.

I've used this spice rub several times for friends and fanily. Everyone raves about it. I've used it on all types of steaks and chicken. With chicken breasts, I'll make a little extra and use it for Quesadillas the next day.

Loved this recipe. We've made it twice. Both times it was a hit. I cut back on the salt in the rub. My very picky stepmother said that it was the best steak she had ever had!

Delicious. A great way to make steak for a change of pace. The salsa, though completely unecessary for the tastey steak, added a yummy complexity to my veggy side dish (grilled zuchinni & cherry tomatoes) when I mixed it in. Next time, I'll do that before bringing the vegetables to the table.

Gotta agree with Joel from Montgomery on this one. Against my better judgement, I tried the recipe. Not exactly a ruined dinner, but not great, either. My husband made a suggestion for the rub, however, that sounds interesting. It would probably be fantastic on ribs or maybe even brisket.

This recipe was way too strong and overpowering. It ruined a bunch of ribeyes I served to my family. I mad e it under the electric broiler, and maybe that made the difference. It was like eating ribeyes with beef jerky seasoning. TOO MUCH EVERYTHING--salt, pepper, flavor. Fortunately, there's no MSG in it. Smells great. Coriander is interesting, but VERY disappointing recipe overall.

Great flavors, but WAYYY too salty. Probably could be 1-2 tsp. instead of 1/3 of a cup!

Great RUB ... I skipped the salsa and it was still delish.

Knock down drag out flavor-your guests will beg for the recipe. Mince the garlic and throw it in the mixture & substitute 1/4 cup chili powder with 1/8 cup chili powder and 1/8 cup paprika. I dredged the steaks in the the spice mixture & only marinated mine for 2-hours. Everyone is asking me (especially my very particular father-n-law "the grill meister") for the recipe - don't give it up! Easy and spectacular flavor.

Out of this world steak - but better if you leave the cloves out.

Wonderful!! I was only able to marinate the steaks for two hours but they came out great anyway. Next time will try paprika in place of red chili. The bbq sauce made from the rub left the meat with really nice texture.

If you are a true epicurean at heart and do not mind some additional prep time this recipe is worth ever bit of the effort. Your tasts buds will come alive and your cooking status will rise to new heights with your guests.....Use very thick Rib-eyes and use the rub at least 24hrs in advance. And I thought I was a steak expert!
