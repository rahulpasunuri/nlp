We found it to be too salty as the recipe is written. We will give this recipe another try without the second addition of salt. Also patted a mix of minced fresh sage, rosemary and thyme onto the steaks along with the first coating of salt. We will also try letting it sit in the fridge for longer than 3 hours.

Whenever I try a new recipe, I make it exactly the way the recipe says and then I change it the next time I make if necessary. That being said, this dish was so salty it almost made the perfectly wonderful ribeye I bought inedible. All I tasted was the salt. Way too much. Next time I'll follow my instincts and reduce the salt a lot

Only had a 1 lb steak (1.5" thick) and regular salt, so reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp total for first rub, 1/4 tsp total for second rub. Didn't measure the fresh ground pepper. Cooked on a charcoal grill as directed. Delicious and not too salty. Next time I'd try aging it more than 3 hours (I age salted chicken, uncovered in fridge for up to 3 days--fantastic!). Next time, I might also try using Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of the 2nd salt rub & pepper.

Anyone dumb enough to put this much salt on a perfectly good piece of meat will probably not live to finish it!

mitch69... the general cooking instructions are superb, however, depending on the diet you're used to, people have a wide range of tolerance/intolerance of salt. If you know that you rarely, if ever salt anything, you need to use your own discretion. As someone who never eats chips, fries, or uses salt in any amount over very minute quantities when cooking, salt on a ribeye sounds disgusting, but I know that and would forego the salt.

To David from Yuma - if you salt long enough before cooking, the water that is drawn out by the salt is reabsorbed into the meat -- sort of like brining a turkey. I do it with beef tenderloin (let it sit overnight) and the results are spectacular.

Never, Never apply salt to good beef hours before cooking. The salt starts drawing moisture out of the meat, which is undersirable. Salt should be applied shortly before cooking.

Seriously - people need a recipe for Salt and peper on a steak - and then mess it up?

>>did you use regular iodized salt? That's not a lot of salt for 2 bone-in rib eyes. These are some big and expensive steaks. I like the prime rib at Costco good price --- they will cut them for you too. I don't use anything other than sea salt and I prefer the coarse red kind. Sea salt has a lower sodium content than regular salt and is much tastier! You should try it. Just use your instinct and use less salt next time and make sure you have the best prime rib and sea salt and freshly cracked pepper.

Still the best (only) way to properly prepare a good steak.

I have to disagree with mitch69 from Virginia. This steak was, simply put, simply delicious!! It was absolutely the best steak we have ever grilled at home, and the best we have eaten in a very long time. We're using the leftovers for the Grilled Steak Salad with Green Beans and Blue Cheese (from this site) - another favorite in our house . We'll definitely be making this Salt-and-Pepper Rib Eye again and again.

The best steak I've ever had!! Follow the recipe exactly.

I had the steak at a friend's house. They used thinner steak without adjusting the salt. It was a little salty but really tasty. I will adjust the salt if you're using less than 1 1/2" steak. The flash aging of the steak in the refrigerator is a MUST also. Follow the recipe EXACTLY will reward you with the best steak you ever had...

Should be renamed "How to Destroy a Rib Eye" It was so salty it was almost inedible. Who writes these things. I don't believe he/she has ever cooked a steak in their life. I think they must use a compilation of Google articles. mutters to self - "Must learn to trust my own instincts"
