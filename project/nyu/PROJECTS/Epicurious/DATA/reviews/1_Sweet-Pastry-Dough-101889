What a wonderful sweet pastry dough! I've used this for a basic cheescake crust, and just combined it with the unbaked fruit pie filling for a scrumptious peach and blackberry dessert. I used two recipies of the fruit filling - the bottom layer blackberry, topped with peach. Served with brown sugar whipped cream, and garnished with additional berries and fresh mint, it's both lovely and delicious. If properly chilled, this dough isn't too difficult to handle, and I didn't find it too short, as the previous reviewer did. Using it in a springform pan, rather than a regular pie pan, gave me the option of first rolling, and then patting into place, with excellent results.

I found this pastry very short.
