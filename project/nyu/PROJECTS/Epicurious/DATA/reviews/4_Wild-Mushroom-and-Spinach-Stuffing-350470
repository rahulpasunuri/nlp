I've made this for the last few holiday get-togethers and it's always a hit. This year, I tried to make it a little healthier and it tasted better than the original recipe. I halved the butter at each step and added olive oil to cook. I used a day-old roasted garlic loaf which really elevated the flavor. I also rehydrated 4 oz of dried mushrooms and used the broth for more wild mushroom flavor. Reducing the bread is a must - I used about 10 cups and still needed an extra cup of broth in the final step. Next year I will try only 4 tablespoons butter total (plus greasing the dish).

A very yummy stuffing recipe - this is our new standard for thanksgiving. I made this vegetarian by substituting veggie stock for chicken stock. Like other reviewers I used only 6 cups of bread. I can't imagine using more than that. Everyone enjoyed the combination of mushrooms and spinach.

This is one of my favorite stuffing recipes. I made it this Thanksgiving with just a small tweak by replacing half of the chopped onions with chopped leeks and I used brioche bread instead of pain rustique.

We are non-meat eaters and this was really good. Be careful on cutting back the bread too much if you read other reviews, or adjust broth. Also, I did not use the spinach due to an allergy, and it was still good.

I have made this recipe for a few years and it is always a hit! This year, I couldn't find fresh wild mushrooms, but I reconstituted dried porcini, shitake, and chopped them up with baby bellas. It still had a great flavor. I used some of the broth from the reconstituted mushrooms instead of veggie broth for extra mushroom flavor. I halved the recipe for a small gathering and kept the measurements consistent except I only uses 4.5 cups of bread cubes. Reducing the bread content is a must, and I still needed more than 1 cup of broth. I crave this stuffing every Thanksgiving!

this is the second time I've made this and it is fabulous. On this Thanksgiving I used shitake, chanterelles and baby bellas. Agree with others it's a little too much bread so I cut back by about 1 1/2 cups. It is so light and fluffy, not something that sticks in your stomach!

I made this with a fig bread and it was incredible. Next time, I think I'll add some pecans, almonds, or walnuts for some added crunch. Really, really yummy!

Everyone at Thanksgiving hated this recipe. It was so not worth it because the Chanterelle were so expensive and I had to double the amount for the recipe. I made it with Ciabatta and everyone hated the hard texture.

We used this recipe as a stuffing for our turkey. In that scenario, 12 cups of bread cubes worked well. We accompanied the turkey and this stuffing recipe with the gravy from the Roast Turkey with Herb Butter and Caramelized Onion-Balsamic Gravy. It was outstanding!

Made this for Thanksgiving in the slow cooker b/c there wasn't enough room in the oven. Very good receipe, followed to a tee minus the last part (was not cooked in the oven). Would make again!

I have made this two years in a row for thanksgiving. This year I made 1 1/2 of the recipe since I had a large group -- I used the entire 18 cups of bread suggested and used heaping cups for the veggies. Baked in two large casserole dishes switching positions in the oven half through. I did moisten with some additional broth (I used veggie) after putting in the pans before baking. Multiple people commented that it was the best stuffing they every had.

Based on prior reviews, I doubled all the ingredients except the bread and refrigerated it overnight. I checked the moisture after bringing it to room temp and added a little more stock. It was delicious! I'll be making this again soon

It was an okay recipe. Feel like it needed a little less bread. No complexity in flavor or texture. It seemed to be the one dish people weren't so crazy about at Thanksgiving. They just found it okay.

Made this for Thanksgiving & it was delicious but as other reviewers noted, do not use 12 cups of bread. I used 8 cups but would probably start with 6 next time. Other than using 1/2 the bread & only using about 1/2 the butter, I followed the recipe exactly [using criminis & shitakes]. The flavors & spices were perfect. I will definitely make this for every Thanksgiving from now on.

Made this for Thanksgiving last night with oyster, shiitake, and portobella mushrooms. The stuffing came out moist and very flavorful. The only drawback is that it's a bit bready.

So I didn't have everything required for this recipe in my kitchen when I went to make this, but I went ahead and did this recipe minus the assorted mushrooms (only used portobello) and left out the celery. It was amazing and, considering I typically do not like stuffing, I was definitely impressed.

I just made this stuffing as a trial run for thanksgiving dinner and halved the recipe. I followed the recipe almost to a T, just used veggie stock instead of chicken stock and gluten-free bread. Let's just say I'll definitely be making this for t-day. Really really nice recipe, and so much easier than ones I've made previously! Next time I think I'll increase the amount of herbs, but that's about the only change I'd make. so good!

I halved the recipe and served it with a roast turkey breast. I used olive oil instead of butter since I keep a kosher kitchen and vegetable broth since that is what I had around. It was great and is definitely going onto the Thanksgiving menu.

Sometimes it's nice just to have stuffing for dinner as the evenings get colder. This recipe was a perfect fit. It was pretty simple to make and my husband (a non-spinach person) thought it was delicious too. This will certainly make it into the menu rotation!

This is amazing. The dressing is moist, flavorful and a crowd pleaser. The photo with the recipe is hideous and looks nothing like the final result I received. It paired very nicely with the Roast Turkey with Corn Bread Stuffing and Giblet Gravy recipe (I just substituted this dressing instead of the corn bread one). I was leery of the spinach and wasn't sure if I was going to add it, but I am so glad I did and would probably add a little more next time. I used mostly chanterelles and while it seemed like a lot of butter, once I let it cook down, it was worth it and they really added to the overall taste and moisture of the dish. However, I think it would be fine to cut the butter back a little if you like. I followed other reviewers' advice and used only one pound of ciabatta for almost a double recipe. I cut the bread into very small cubes (think game dice), used vegetable stock but otherwise followed the recipe as is. I received so many compliments and plan on using it as my holiday dressing from now on. Enjoy!

My review could be a carbon copy of avivaleah's. This is a delicious stuffing or whatever you wish to call it and made a hit at my Thanksgiving table.

Rating: 4
I made this exactly as written except I left out the spinach (just didn't think the texture of spinach would enhance a dressing). I used the turkey broth in the same article to moisten it, and used all shiitake mushrooms as that was all I could get fresh. Raves all around and although I pride myself on finding new sides every year this will be a keeper to go back to!

I am French, living in France and I was in charge of the stuffing and the turkey for the Thanksgiving dinner my American friend organized last evening. As a Frenchman, I am accustomed to stuffing being cooked inside the bird and usually we use 90% meat and 10% bread, eggs and herbs! But it was a Thanksgiving dinner and I decided to try this "curieuse recette americaine!" Nevertheless I have reduced the amount of bread to 8 cups. "Un délice!" It was a great challenge because every year "mon amie américaine" prepare her Madeleine de proust recipe (a recipe that reminds her of her childhood) and she loved my stuffing. I chose this recipe to pair it with the Roast Heritage Turkey with Bacon-Herb and Cider Gravy. Vive lAmérique!

Delish, though I agree that this should not be called stuffing since it isn't actually cooked inside the bird. I found that all at the T-giving table kept calling it a casserole until they tasted it and realized that it was "stuffing" . Rave reviews upon tasting, but I agree that the amount of bread should be reduced + cubed smaller than 1". Nice option for those vegetarians at the table if you use a homemade veg. stock. and cook as recommended in a casserole dish.

With a little tweaking this recipe is almost perfect. All the flavor components are good the measurements just need to be adjusted. I had never used chanterelles before but am in love with them after prepping a pound for the stuffing. I made the recipe for Thanksgiving EXACTLY as written and found that the bread was overwhelming the other ingredients. To spend so much on gourmet mushrooms and then hide them between chunks of bread doesn't work for me. I took the leftovers (about half the original amount) and added my own improvements: one onion, chopped, 2 lbs. white mushrooms, chopped, 8 oz. porcini mushrooms, chopped, 3 cups porcini soaking liquid whisked with 2 eggs, fresh thyme and tarragon. I cooked the onions and mushrooms until soft, added the liquid/eggs and herbs and then mixed in the original stuffing. Baked at 375 F for about 40 minutes. The remade leftovers were out of this world, the whole family agreed. So next year I will halve the bread and chop it smaller, double the mushroom mixture (using white mushrooms and porcini for flavor in addition to a pound of chanterelle), use porcini soaking liquid (strained in coffee filter!!) along with some broth and put in about 4 times as much baby spinach (since it cooks down so greatly). These are just our personal tastes but I feel my second attempt resulted in a much more uniform dish with better flavor.

Everyone loved this stuffing! I made this as a side dish casserole and made it exactly as written. I used ciabatta bread and didn't have a problem with the amount specified. I used a mix of cremini and shitake mushrooms. I did add a little chicken broth over the top of the casserole when it came out of the oven just to give it a little extra moisture, but it probably wasn't necessary.

In response to the "what would you stuff with this" question -- I make a stuffed filet of sole for my Thanksgiving main dish since I don't eat meat, and this sounds like it might be a nice alternative to the crabmeat-herb stuffing I normally use. Though it does seem like it would be perfectly nice on its own. Just a thought. :)

I made this for our Thanksgiving and all 10 guests loved it - did cut down the bread quantity while I was putting it together,left out approx. 2 - 3 cups as it was overhelming the other ingredients...but other than that it was very good.

I made this as a tester for Thanksgiving and I will definitely make it for the big day. The flavors in the fresh herbs are just right and I loved the mushroom. They made a unusual touch to the traditional American stuffing recipe. Next time I will use a little less bread, although the ciabatta tastes great, there was too much bread and it took over the mushroom/spinach flavor. I will use 1 cup less next time.

What would you stuff with this? Being a southerner, we would call this "dressing" if it is a side dish.
