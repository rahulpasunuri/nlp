If you love gingerbread, it doesn't get any better then this!

If you love ginger and moisture and savory sweetness I give this my highest recommendation, It is unspeakably delicious. High quality canola oil mixed half:half w/butter works. Just watch oven time. Middle sinks every time so misleads about cooking time.

I have been making this cake for 15 years. It is crazy delicious, don't change the recipe, use the prunes, they add moisture, and stewing them with the armagnac and ginger makes the kitchen smell delicious. It becomes even more moist days after it's baked.

I have made this twice now, and I love this cake, but both times, the cocoa was scorched by the time the cake was done. Next time, I will try flouring the pan instead. Any other ideas?

Truly takes gingerbread to another level. Suitable for serving at a formal dinner party. Outstanding with espresso or black coffee. Absolutely worth the effort.

Outstanding! Very pronounced ginger flavor, which I love. Do add the armagnac or cognac - it adds a wonderful aroma and flavor. Texture is moist and dense. I used a 9" rather than 10" springform pan, with no problems.

I first made this cake in 1994 when it appeared in Gourmet - I love this cake. Ignore the other reviews that make changes to the recipe. The prunes are fab and the shortening is what keeps the cake sooo moist. I always think it funny when people take the liberty to change the recipe and then complain about the results!

I've made this cake so many times I've lost count. Has become a classic at our house. Was an overwhelming success when served to European guests while living abroad. Freezes beautifully - can just cut the slices you need. Do use the creme fraiche and don't use whipped cream instead.

This cake is very tasty and easy to make. Used brandy instead of armagnac because that is what I had in the cupboard. All the ginger really snaps up the taste. Only problem is cooking time. Cooked this for 10 minutes less than called for, in an oven that tends to be cool, and it was overdone on the top and sides. If I bake it again, would cook for only 1 hour.

Very good, but didn't think the prunes were necessary. I used butter instead of shortening. Shortening may make the cake a bit moister though. 1 hour 20 was a bit long - cake dried out a bit. Otherwise not bad!

If you love dark, moist, well-flavored gingerbread do not let the prunes scare you away. I have been searching for a recipe that would remain moist and improve with age. This is it! Reminds me of some treacle tart I had at a Cafe in Bath overlooking the Avon! Great texture.
