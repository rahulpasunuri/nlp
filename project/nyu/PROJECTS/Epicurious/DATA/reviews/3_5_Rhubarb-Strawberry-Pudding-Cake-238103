Delicious! I brought this to a picnic and it was a contrast to the many gooey sweet desserts.

This recipe has become a staple of my kitchen. I make it every year. I up the fruit content slightly, but mostly stick to the recipe. It is delicious.

Loved it! Easy and tasty. The rhubarb sauce is a bit tart and the cake sweet, which is a nice combo.

I liked this the first time, but was even better the 2nd time around. I doubled the strawberries and cut the milk by 25%. Once in the pan, I cut the compote into the batter, much like a marble cake.

My kids loved it but nothing special as far as I'm concerned. The cake appeared cooked but was raw in the middle, and the fruit (I doubled the strawberries as it didn't seem like it would even cover the bottom of the pan) cooked into mush. A crumble or biscuit topping would be easier and better, I'm thinking!

Since I changed some things, I feel it would be unfair to rate this recipe. I already had about 2 cups of stewed rhubarb and added 2 cups of sliced strawberries. I used 2/3 cup of flour, and 1/3 cup of cornmeal, 1/4 cup of egg substitute (instead of the egg), 1/2 cup of 1% milk, 1/3 cup of sugar, and just used 1/4 of melted butter. Since the cake seemed to be browning too quickly, I turned down the temp. to 350 degrees. The cake was wonderful. The cornmeal adds a great texture, and the ratio of fruit to cake was just right. I hope this helps a cook who needs to cut down on the saturated fat.

OK, so this was alright. Just as it says, no hassle mix and bake. I choose this recipe because it was quick and I was pressed for time, and I had everything on hand to bake it. I prepared it as written and it was moist and tasty. I would encourage you to double the fruit as I found it wasn't really enough. I didn't have the problem as others did with the fruit bubbling over, but if it's doubled it surely will. This recipe is great if you want something quick and need to satisfy a little sweet craving. I'd like to try it with other fruit.

Wow- this is so good! An excellent use of strawberries and rhubarb. I used frozen rhubarb and fresh strawberries and it turned out perfectly.

Great quick summer dessert. We don't like things too sweet, so I used half the sugar, white whole wheat flour, subbed 1/3 corn meal for flour as suggested, and added at least half again more fruit. Perfect sweet-tart cake to go with a scoop of ice cream. Very pretty out of the oven, too.

This is a tasty cake that would be delicious with vanilla ice cream (or vanilla pudding, which I had on hand instead of ice cream). I was nervous that the rhubarb would be tart and/or crunchy so I simmered them in the sugar glaze liquid for 15 minutes till they seemed soft and had had time to soak in the sweet liquid. I probably doubled the strawberries (why not, right?!) and then threw it all in. The cake definitely bubbled over so put it on a jelly roll to catch the drip and then let it cool on a rack while it sinks back down. Otherwise, this is an easy dessert to make when you have rhubarb (2 cups was about 3 stalks cut up like you'd cut celery). Serve warm with ice cream!

This is a perfect recipe. I have made this 3 times. Once I used blueberries, raspberries and blackberries instead of the strawberry/rhubarb and it was great then as well. I highly recommend it!

Rating: 4
Super easy and very good! Reduced the sugar to 1/4 C to the rhubarb and 1/3 C to the batter. May reduce the sugar even more next time. Pop it in the oven as you serve your main dish and then pour whipping cream over the steaming result!

Rating: 4
Quick and easy but impressively good. The only thing I changed the second time through was to replace 1/3 C of the flour with 1/3 C cornmeal. We all liked the texture better. I actually made this 3 nights in a row it was so good.

Rating: 3
Just delicious, especially considering the ease of preparation. It was inhaled at my daughter's graduation party and the only recipe requested - and by many! I might cut down on the sugar just a tad next time, as I like my fruit a bit more on the tart side.

Rating: 4
This is a lovely dessert. I can't say that the result is very "puddingy" but it's wonderfully moist and the cake is very tender. I made it with rhubarb only (3 cups raw) although didn't add quite as much sugar to the rhubarb mix as called for -- I like my rhubarb a bit tart. But for those who want a sweet dessert, the full amount of sugar would be fine. Well enjoyed!

Rating: 3
Pudding or not I loved it enough to have a little second helping just for another taste. I didn't have rhubarb so I used about half & half blueberries and strawberries and because I was using sweeter fruit, I used 1/4 c sugar. I was busy while I was throwing it together and forgot the sugar in the batter, except for a sprinkling of raw sugar over the top, and with vanilla ice cream, it was perfect. Next time I'll probably throw a few spoonfuls of sugar into the batter. I wouldn't say it's the best dessert I've ever had, but I loved it and it was so quick to throw together that I'll definitely be making it again - with whatever seasonal fruit I have.

I loved this recipe... The cake is so tender and it was very quick to put together. I added chopped, fresh mint to the fruit which made it even better!

I used gluten-free baking flour (with a little less than 1 tsp of xanthan gum) and cherries instead of strawberries. The cake came out beautifully, though perhaps more pudding-y than I had expected. This does not seem to me like a breakfast dish, unless you have a strong sweet tooth.

Excellent! Just follow the directions and it'll turn out great. Only thing I did different was used 1% milk, as that was all I had, but it still came out terrific. Was even good the next day. A keeper!

Lovely, homey, rustic and simple dessert; a perfect ending to a casual meal. We had one of those moments when everyone took the first bite at the same time, followed by total silence at the table, followed by lots of "mmm", "this is good" and "this is really good". We served it with a dollop of unsweetened thickened whipping cream on the top, which does cut the sweetness. Lovely balance of sweet buttery cake and sweet tart fruit. Be sure and let it cool a good 30 minutes before serving, so it is warm, not hot, and the fruit filling will firm up.

This is fabulous, one of my favorite desserts to make, to eat, to bring to a party. You can mix up the berry/rhubarb proportions if necessary, I also used frozen blueberries in lieu of half of the strawberries to great success. Easy, delicious pudding filling with a nice soft vanilla cake all in one!

Very easy and very good. Can use frozen fruit and it turns out great. Watch out - it bubbles over when you bake it.

This is pretty tasty and very easy, a nice alternative to crisps or pies if you have some fruit, but not an abundance. I made it with white nectarines-- sliced one very thin and cooked it with the syrup, cut another into 1 inch dice and left it raw. The contrast between the two was nice. I also and increased the butter and the milk to 2/3 cup, which results in a very tender and moist (but not soggy!) crumb. To those who are thinking of reducing the sugar: I cut the sugar in the cake in half and even with my sweet nectarines, the cake wasn't nearly sweet enough (for reference, I like my fruit desserts on the tart side). Has anyone tried this with an extra egg?

Delicious and really easy. I made it with 3 cups of rhubarb and no strawberries. I thought it had just the right amount of fruit. The cake had a very good texture and flavour.

I took some of the advice in the other reviews and increased the fruit by 50% and used a bit of brown sugar for some of the regular sugar. It tasted even better the next day.

So very delicious! And easy besides. I skipped the strawberries and just went with 15 oz of rhubarb - I am emphatically against this mania of adding strawberries to rhubarb dishes. The rhubarb is so fantastically lovely on its own, why spoil it by adding something else? Other than that, I made it exactly as shown here. Twice. In one weekend. Served it with vanilla ice cream and everybody wanted seconds.

I thought this tasted more like muffins or pancakes than a dessert. It wasn't horrible, it was edible, but I won't make it again. It was easy though, and if you want a coffee cake this would work fine.

This is one of my favorite recipes - I have made it many many times. I think the recipe is perfect as written - a moist vanilla-y cake with hints of tangy fruit. I love it. I probably cook it slightly less than the recipe calls for (20-25 minutes) and I usually use a couple more ounces of rhubarb (more like 12 ounces).

Rating: 4
Excellent! However, I doubled both the rhubarb and the strawberries. The best part is that I grew the rhubarb myself!

Strawberries & rhubarb are back in season! I thought this was nice and homey, a bit like a crumble. Much better at room temperature. Also used equal amounts of rhubarb & strawberries.

I was disappointed with the outcome of this dessert. Found it heavy and rather boring overall. I have fond memories of rhubarb cakes as a child in Canada, but this one didn't measure up.

Rating: 4
Always a winner here in France, even if made with other fruits, less fruit mix, more fruit mix...whatever, it always works! I usually cook the rhubarb a little longer than mentioned, and cut it in a small dice. And I am of the extra fruit mix camp, because we just can't get enough of this dessert!

Rating: 4
It's strange that many reviewers found they needed more fruit, and others less. I found there was too much fruit to batter, but we all thought it was absolutely divine! I only had 1/2 the strawberries suggested, so cooked a diced granny smith with the rhubarb, worked a treat. Also used half brown sugar for a deeper flavour.

Rating: 4
Yummy and easy. Made this for a bbq, served it with vanilla bean ice cream and everyone loved it. As others had done, I used an extra cup of strawberries. (If you do this, put something under the baking dish to catch any overflow and save yourself the clean up.) Next time I'll replace some of the sugar with brown sugar. And now that strawberry season is over and it's blueberry and peach season, I'll be trying this with different fruits...can't wait!

After reading all the reviews, I decided to make my own changes. I substituted blueberries for the rhubarb and increased the strawberries. No streaking of fruit on the top, only raw sugar mixed with some cinnamon! Great!!!

Rating: 2
disappointing. Contrary to what most other reviewers thought, I actually found there was too much fruit and not enough cake. I used all strawberries, but the same total weight, so perhaps that was my problem. It looked nothing like the picture though, pink all through, but not exactly like a pudding cake either. If I were to make it again, I might try upping the batter and folding in the strawberries....but more likely I will look for another strawberry cake recipe.

I easily made this pudding cake vegan with the appropriate substitutions, and it came out beautifully. I have since made it three times, to rave reviews. I used less sugar than called for and didn't reserve anything for a glaze - just put it all underneath.

I made the rhubarb-strawberry version a few times this spring. Now that my peach tree is going nuts, I substituted peaches and raspberries with everything else stayting the same--it was wonderful. Now that I think of it, maybe I will use almond extract in place of the vanilla next time. Personally, I like the higher cake-to-fruit ratio.

Heeding other reviewers, I added lots of extra pudding items but left the dry ones the same. 1/2 cup water instead of 1/4 in the sauce; 3 cups of rhubarb, not 2; 1 1/2 cups of blueberries, frozen and thawed and hency juicy, in place of strawberries; 2/3 cup milk and 2/3 cup butter in batter; and it was delish but not soggy this way, really a pudding cake. Made as originally written, though, it would indeed be a cake with the pudding as only an afterthought. Obviously, this is best warm.

Rating: 4
This recipe was very easy and was very popular with my guests. I used extra strawberries as I had them on hand, but did not otherwise alter the recipe. I agree with the suggestion of an earlier reviewer that this would be delicious with other fruit such as peaches. My cake was fairly cakelike however, not very much pudding.

Quick, easy and delicious. I will definitely make this again soon.

This is more like a cobbler, but with a too high cake to fruit ratio (as mentioned in a lot of the other reviews). The cake needs cinammon or sugar on top....something to make it interesting! It gets one fork, because it was palatable warm...not too confident about leftovers!

Rating: 4
This is as easy as it is tasty. I used about 3-4 cups of rhubarb, 2 cups of strawberries & doubled the cornstarch and water but leaving everything else the same as other reviewers suggested. It turns out wonderful. Haven't had any leftover with this dessert yet.

This was yummy, and easy. I doubled the amount of strawberries and took the advice of others to cut the rhubarb in small pieces. I didn't have an 8" square pan, but a 7x11 worked fine. At 25 minutes, it was golden brown but very pudding like in the middle. It would be good even cooked a bit more, I think.

Absolutely delicious. It does certainly remind me of puddings that my grandmother made. I am a real strawberry fan, and upped the amount of strawberries to 2 cups.

Not exactly pudding soft, but delicious nonetheless. I suppose if you bake it for less than 30 min it would come out softer. However, for me, it was better well baked because it formed this delicious crust on top. yumm

This is a simple but delicious cake. Agree with the previous poster that rhubarb should be cut into very smal pieces. A really wonderful and simple spring dessert.

Rating: 3
Easy and tasty. Cake is light yet buttery--a welcome contrast to the fruit. To avoid stringiness in rhubarb, slice into very small pieces. Tastes best fresh; cake gets a little rubbery the next day (although with the butter content, storing it in the refrigerator contributed to the denser second-day texture).

Oh my goodness! This was a hit for Mother's Day. Only thing different I would do next time is add cinnamon to the dry ingredients. Also would serve it warm from the oven with vanilla ice cream. DELICIOUS!

Made as written. This is incredibly easy to throw together, and I loved it. The only change I would make is to bake slightly longer. Despite the tester coming out clean, I didn't care for the pudding texture of the finished cake. I'll leave it till the cake is nice and firm next time, more like a cobbler. I'm unsure whether I'd add more fruit, as many reviewers have suggested. It might increase the soggyness (but the flavor of the fruit was wonderful!)

Rating: 2
While I love the tartness of strawberry and rhubarb, I had forgotten that rhubarb is unpleasantly stringy, and so to me the texture of the filling really detracted from this recipe. If you're not bothered by that, you'll probably really like this.

This recipe was quick and easy to prepare and came out fabulous. :) I, like others, increased the fruit portion, but didn't increase the sugar. I will definitely make this one again

This was very good and got rave reviews at a potluck last night. I doubled the recipe for 13 X 9 glass baking dish. I also used frozen rhubarb, and about 3 cups strawberries for the double recipe. I did not have any trouble with the "drizzling" of fruit on top of the batter. Was good served warm with vanilla ice cream. Leftovers were claimed by the guests for breakfast the next day.

I used twice as much fruit (did NOT increase sugar, did increase cornstarch by 1/2 t) and skipped the cook the rhubarb for 3 min (I already mixed the fruit with it!). It came out beautifully! It will be made again, possibly with other fruit...peaches, apples, blackberries....

Used about 50% more rhubarb and strawberry than listed. A delicious cake and much easier than a strawberry-rhubarb pie or cobbler (and, in some ways, tastier!). Very much like the Blueberry Pudding Cake recipe also listed on this site.

Rating: 3
This is more cake than pudding. The cake is buttery, moist and delicious. I doubled the fruit (adjusting the syrup) and there was still a much larger proportion of cake than fruit. It was lovely and addictive but I was looking for something to feature the fruit more. This is not something I would ordinarily make again, though I could see using the cake recipe for an upside down cake with other fruit.

Made this for Easter and it was a huge hit. Easy, lucious and stayed moist, so it could have been made the day before. Followed recipe exactly and it was fool proof.

This was the first cake I have made from scratch. It was very easy to make. I love the fruit filling, I will probably even use that part of it in other cake recipees as a filling. I thought the cake would look more like a regular cake, but the consistency was more of a cross between a yellow cake, and a pound cake. Everyone at work loved it as a breakfast pastry, it was super moist and very tasty!

This was almost as easy as making pancakes and both my husband and daughter loved it. It really works as a homey, simple American-style dessert. It worked fine as written and my only change would be to add a bit more fruit (and perhaps sugar without increasing the water) because my daughter kept digging around for the delicious fruity parts.

Yummy, homey dessert. Next time I'll use more rhubarb, though; say 3 cups (with a little more sugar). I also had no problem with the drizzled filling. In fact, I thought it made for a nice look. My husband raved!

Made this as directed and it turned out great. I had no problem with the drizzled filling making for glueiness.

This recipe is similar to the blueberry pudding cake on this site - both are lovely, very tender with a beautiful crumb - but I'm not sure it's a good idea to drizzle some of the fruit filling on top of the cake. While the top was nice and golden, the areas with the filling on top were still a bit gluey, so it had to be cooked longer than necessary. I wouldn't put filling on top in future. I served it with a side scoop of creme fraiche.
