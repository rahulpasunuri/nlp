I first made this recipe years ago and learned a valuble lesson...double the veggies 'cause they're so good! I had a friend over for dinner and made this dish. She said, "Wow! This is good enough for company!" I said, "What do you think YOU are?" :- )

I love the flavor of this dish. When serving it to a friend for dinner one time, she said,"This is so good, you could serve it to company!" I said, "I just did." Over the years, I've made this dish at least a dozen times and each time, I like it even better.

I think that fresh terragon and small young zuchinis are key.

I made this dish with all fresh ingredients from the farmers market. I used yellow zucchini rather than green ones because the yellow ones are never bitter and have a sweeter taste. I also used finely chopped roasted red peppers to give it a smoky flavor. I cant see why some people thought that this recipe was dull, but I thought it was great when I made it (and Im not a health food nut) and I ate the leftovers cold on a bead of spinach.

Generally tasty, but the vegetables needed something else to make the dish sing. Something saucier maybe???

This recipe tasted healthy, but didn't really thrill me. I think shredding the veggies is unappetizing. The recipe definitely lacked something major. I don't even think I want to eat the leftovers.

This was quick, delicious, and healthy; and it looked really appetizing, too, with all the bright colors. All around, a great dish - I will definitely make it again!

This dish was w-a-y better than I expected. The vegetables still had some crispness to them and the flavors blended beautifully. I've made it several times and always with excellent results. It's become a favorite of mine--and my guests.
