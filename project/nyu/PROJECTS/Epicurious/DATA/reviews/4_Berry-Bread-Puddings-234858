Oh, this was so good. Almost like serving cake, berries, AND custard all in one dessert. I used a soft, sweet portuguese loaf and slightly less sugar to compensate. Mine was an all-raspberry version, and I was worried that the cinnamon would be overpowering, so instead of a full teaspoon I used a quarter teaspoon each of cinnamon, ginger, and slightly less nutmeg. It gave the finished dessert a heady, full-flavoured aroma without being "spiced". Excellent served with unsweetened whipped cream.

Loved this! Made it with a variety of blueberries, currents, blackberries and strawberries and the challah (thanks for the reccommendations!). I don't even really like bread puddings and it was delicious! Bringing to friends this weekend.

Easy and delicious. I divided the recipe by four so I could make just enough for two servings; however, it actually filled three ramekins. I baked for about 40 minutes, and it was done, but could have used another five minutes to fully set. Inverted and served with a scoop of ice cream. Fresh raspberry bread puddings with ice cream = perfect!

I have used similar recipes and this one is one of the best I have used. For Sunday brunch, I cut the recipe in half and cut down a bit on sugar and bake in a 13 x 9 baking dish. I have tried it with different berries and also apples and it always comes out yummy!

I loved this recipe was a hit for the dinner I was invited to. Everyone went crazy. I served it with real whipped cream and fresh strawberries. And on the side a bit of real maple syrup. was FABULOUS!

I used Panettone for the bread and blackberries and strawberries for the fruit. I made one large pudding in a 9x13" glass pan. Scrumptious. It did take about 55 minutes to bake. Easy to make and definitely a keeper.

I don't usually like bread pudding, but this was very nice. Used frozen mixed berries from Costco, and it worked well, after thawing berries first.

This is my new favourite summer dessert. I discovered it when I was defrosting my freezer and had frozen berries and too much frozen bread on hand. It was incredibly easy!! My only minor complaint is that I have a hard time making it look really appealing.

Really not that good. I love bread pudding, and we're always up for trying something new - but the berry/pudding combo just wasn't good. If you want bread pudding, keep looking - there are better recipes out there.

Wonderful and easy to make as written

I baked this in a large glass baking dish instead of the individual ramekins, and lowered the heat to 350 with no bain marie. It turned out well, but had to bake for ~30 minutes longer than the recipe called for. Very yummy served with maple syrup.

Very easy to make, and the result was moist and delicious. Will definitely make this again. Try challah (egg bread) for an extra-soft texture.

This was very easy to make. I used a combination of strawberries, blackberries and raspberries. I had to cook it quite a bit longer (maybe due to high altitude) but it turned out perfect.
