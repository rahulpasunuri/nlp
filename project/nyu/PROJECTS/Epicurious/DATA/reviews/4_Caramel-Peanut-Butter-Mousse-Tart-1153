I was very dissapointed by this recipe. It's only redeaming quality is the peanut butter mousse itself. Don't waste your time/money/energy combining it with the crust and DON'T waste your time with the "caramel" topping. It's only a brown sugar sauce. If you do make this, either buy REAL caramel, not topping, or make your own REAL caramel sauce - it's so easy, easier, I believe, then the "caramel" this recipe calls for. So, after my embarassment when I served this tart, I made the peanut butter filling again, paired it with a milk chocolate mousse and REAL caramel sauce in a parfait - very good.

This could well be the most unhealthy dessert I've ever made, but it is amazing! Definitely use a candy thermometer -- I just estimated with my caramel and I think I didn't get it hot enough because it was a little runny.

I made this along with other desserts for a Superbowl party. Beautiful presentation and absolutely delicious. I put the white chocolate curls all over the top rather than around it. A little time consuming but well worth the effort.

Amazing! I bake quite a bit, but I really felt like a professional serving this one. It looks so elegant and neat and every component is just unbelievably good. Don't assume that desserts with peanut butter are for kids! This was one of several desserts I prepared, and this definitely came off as one of the most sophisticated.

Absolutely delicious. Definitely one of the best desserts I've ever made. I didn't change a thing - made it exactly as stated in the recipe. The crust stayed nice and crunchy, even a few days later. A small piece goes a long way though. Very rich, but good!!

One of the best desserts I have tried. I had rave reviews on my version. I added a milk chocolate filling and used less peanut butter in the cream cheese filling. For my taste, I did not want to much peanut butter so I experimented and was very happy with the results. Also, the caramel topping is the best I have ever tasted. A good brand of peanuts is a must.

This was a big hit.I think it will join the white chocolate-coconut almond tart from a 1991 Bon Appetit as one of those easy things I make to wow people with decadence-rather than challenge them with sublety.I substituted a cookie tart crust,made with peanut butter cookies, brown sugar and butter,and spread a layer of chocolate ganache over the crust. In retrospect I would use milk chocolate or 1/2 milk,1/2 semisweet for the ganache as the bittersweet isolated from the other flavors a little.I piped the peanut filling in concentric circles of rosettes and then piped the caramel between the rows. I used leftover caramel and ganache for plating the slices-and served them with rosettes of whipped cream sweetened with brown sugar.The peanut filling tastes too cheesey and not sweet enough when first made, but mellows with refrigeration. The caramel recipe is the best I've ever tasted.
