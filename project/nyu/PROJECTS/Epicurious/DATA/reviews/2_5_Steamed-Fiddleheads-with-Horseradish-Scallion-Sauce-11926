I turned this into a pasta dish, by cooking some shrimp in a pan and adding the sauce and cooked fiddleheads at the end to heat. Served over spaghetti noodles with some grated parmesan. My husband loved it!

I love fiddleheads and forage for them in sprint. Check out: A fiddlehead fancy at: http://dailyprandium.wordpress.com/2008/04/21/a-fiddlehead-fancy/

i am one of the rare species of humans that lives for fiddlehead season - much to my husband's dismay (he's nto a fan). i'm always looking for new fiddlehead recipes and this is one i wont try again. the sauce is terribly overpowering and has no place with such a delicatly flavored green. if you want to have great fiddle heads, blanch them then sautee with a chopped clove of garlic. a touch or red pepper or black pepper, and voila! great as a side or with pasta.

I finally got to try this recipe (found the fiddleheads at Trader Joe's!). I loved it but my client did feel the sauce was a little strong. To clear up the confusion about fiddleheads being toxic when lightly cooked: IT DEPENDS ON THE FERN. What is most often seen in the markets is the young frond of the ostrich fern - these can actually be eaten RAW. However, the "Interrupted fern" (Osmundea claytonia) is sometimes sold or gathered as fiddleheads. This is from Sam Thayer, Author of The Forager Newsletter, "Thousands of people collect and eat these ferns every year despite the fact that they are mildly toxic. Undoubtedly this misunderstanding is what accounts for most of the sickness associated with eating fiddleheads. The problem is that these ferns are only mildly toxic, and their bitter taste (which I find detestable) is apparently not repulsive to everyone. It is entirely possible to nibble only one or two raw, or to throw a handful of the chopped-up stalks into split-pea soup, and not feel sick. However, the consumption of a large serving ... or just a moderate serving when raw, can result in nausea, dizziness, lethargy, and headache. Do not eat them."

This recipe was an absolute horror. The cooking time was inadequate, the sauce was like repulsive-hello? Can we use every condiment we have in the refrigerator in one sauce, please? Fiddleheads have a very delicate flavor which was not well served by being doused in mayo AND yogurt.

Love fiddleheads, love the sauce. The recipe is great. I serve the sauce as a dipping sauce with many dishes

The sauce was good, but I find that it overpowers the fiddleheads a little. The sauce was also good with spinach. Like another reviewer, I used only 1/4 c. of mayo for 3/4c. of yogurt.

Excellent with steamed broccoli. I cut the mayo to 1/4 cup and increased the yogurt to 3/4 cup - yummy.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I was glad for the heads-up from the previous reviewer with regard to the cooking time, and I microwaved the fiddleheads for about 3 minutes in a closed container and then sauteed them in butter for about 5 minutes more. The sauce was a perfect foil for the delicate fiddleheads.

For those who are unaware, as the author of this recipe obviously was, undercooked fiddleheads can cause food poisoning. Me and my dinner guests can all atest to that. This recipe calls for a completely inadequate 5 minutes of steaming, the health department suggests nothing less than 10 minutes of boiling for fresh-picked fiddleheads. Besides, they were way too hard and crunchy when only lightly cooked. Otherwise it may have been a nice recipe!

I realized after I made this that I DON'T like fiddleheads. They taste like dirt. BUT, the horseradish scallion sauce was excellent! I left out the scallions and used a tarragon dijon mustard in it. Once I added a little wasabi powder because my horseradish was not too hot. So far I've made the sauce twice and it goes great as a dipping sauce for artichokes! Very yummy dipping sauce!

I liked the sauce better when I doubled the scallions, added wilted spinach, and had it over linguine with a bit of parm.

From the local gourmet grocery, the seldom available spring greens required multiple washings to rid them of the gritty sand. They have a very green taste and benefit greatly from hot peppers and garlic. I suspect they are best picked from your own wooded backyard.
