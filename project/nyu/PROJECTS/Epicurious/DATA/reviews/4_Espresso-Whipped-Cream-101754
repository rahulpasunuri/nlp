Yum, this whipped cream is delicious! I am using it with the bittersweet molten chocolate cakes also from this site.

How could something so easy be such a big hit? I initially made it for Christmas to go with the flourless chocolate cake. Everyone was slathering it on all the dessert, scraping it up for the coffee, eating it plain. I have to make it for New Year's Day for a larger party, so I guess I better quadruple the recipe or I'll be in trouble!

yum! i didn't bother with the powdered espresso. i just made super- super-strong coffee (in a french press) with espresso beans, and added 2 tablespoons to the cream, along with sugar & vanilla. served this with Bittersweet Chocolate Souffle and de-seeded rasberry sauce. mmmmmm.

Our culinary group found the ICED ALMOND LATTE(Drink Section) which this Espresso Whipped Cream accompanied to be FABULOUS... and worth the effort that it requires. Of the ingredients required, the Instant Espresso Powder was the most difficult to find, despite the fact that Tetley (fine print) makes one in a 2 oz. size under the brand Medaglia D'Oro. The more common instant "crystal form" (versus powder) would NOT work well. The drink is so rich that it could be a dessert (especially if you use shaved ice)! THIS recipe for the whipping cream could be adapted to other uses, as it is special in its own right! Suggestion: The "cold brew" method of brewing the latte is probably the best, since the regular hot brew method in the recipe has to be done twice to produce the amount needed.
