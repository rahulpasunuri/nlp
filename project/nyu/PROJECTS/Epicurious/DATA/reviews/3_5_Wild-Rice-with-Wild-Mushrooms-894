Fabulous. Used a mix of dried mushrooms and extra thyme. It was delicious. I did the first 2 steps a day ahead, and that made it fit well into the timing of the meal. Served it on Thanksgiving and everyone enjoyed it.

I used half the rice, double the veggies, sage instead of thyme and added a couple handfuls of baby spinach at the end. Once I served it with crispy skinned ocean trout and once withe pan- fried snapper. Great mix of textures and flavours.

What a tasty side dish--and healthy with the whole grains and veggies! The only thing I'd do different next time is to use broth rather than water for the rice.

It was ok - but honestly not my thing. I love mushrooms but this had a good earthy flavor yet needed kick. I would suggest sage (as I saw others added). I made this with the honey (lavender) duck and everyone ate plenty but... I will be trying something different next Christmas!

Great with the cornish game hens and cranberry thyme sauce.

I enjoyed this recipe, I made it as instructed. But it needed just a little something extra, the previous reviewer recommendations of dried cherries sounded perfect, but I didn't have any on hand. So I sprinkled on a topping of feta cheese and that did the trick.

I love this recipe! The flavors are hearty and fulfilling. I make it at least once a month because it freezes so well. But I always make an extra big batch because the leftovers are so great for quick, healthy work lunches. I just throw a large handful of steamed vegetables on top, maybe mix in some leftover pork tenderloin or chicken breast from the night before... voila!

Delicious as is. No real need to doctor up, although I did add fresh mushrooms in addition to the dried porcinis. The rice went brilliantly with my duck breasts with a pomegranate--chile sauce. Given the bold falvors of that dish, I wouldn't want my wild rice side to compete, but to meld. I'll be making this often.

This is a good recipe but needs more flavor - butter, garlic, salt, pepper......

Yum. This rice is delicious. I added a little fresh sage with the rice and broth.

Wonderful flavors; I added a bit more garlic and carrot, and I used a wild rice mix. Really good.

Well that was good! It does take a lot of time on the stove so this won't make it into the "60 Minute Gourmet", but a very nice wintery dish. We paired this with Duck A L'orange (from this site), which turned out to be a stroke of brilliance. The two were made for each other.

Rice isn't usually my choice of starch but this recipe has made a believer out of me. We threw some shiitakes in with the button mushrooms and used a good, blended wild rice mix. Excellent.

Yum! I made a couple of changes for personal preferance, but this was so-o good. I used white and wild rice combined. And for color and a little tartness added some dried cranberries at the end. Perfect with my prime rib Christas eve. But believe me, I will not wait for Christmas to do this many times more!

This is the best wild rice recipe I've found. It is a staple in our house and pairs nicely with all sorts of meats.

I enjoyed it as did my guests, but the amount of work/time it took was not really worth it, especially for a small side dish. The flavor was good but too subtle.

If you love wild rice you'll love this recipe. Using a combination of dried mushrooms & fresh mushrooms added to the texture of this dish, I will def. make it again.

I have never been crazy about a rice dish that calls for wild rice unrelieved by white or brown rice and this dish was no exception. I didn't find the flavour to be particularly remarkable and I won't make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly adding a few handfuls of dried, chopped cherries as recommended. My guests and husband loved it and everyone wanted more.

Rating: 3
I don't often make wild rice so I was not accoustomed to the LONG cooking time. Mine took more than the 45 min. in the inital phase to "almost" become tender. I also added a bit more chicken stock in the last phase because the rice wasn't quite done when the porcini liquid was absorbed. I didn't have marjoram, but used oregano instead. The husband liked very much!

Dried Shitake mushrooms were just as good. You can make it ahead and stirfry it warm or microwave it - it will survive either. The dried cherries suggested by another reviewer added a lovely sweet-sour contrast to the earthy flavors. Just take care what you serve it with because of the dark brown color - next to a red meat it would be quite drab. The leftovers are great too.

Hardly served 6 since they were literally fighting over who got to scrape the bowl at Christmas dinner! However, made a few changes: in the shopping madness couldn't find dried mushrooms, so skipped that whole step. Instead cooked the wild rice in the chicken broth. Skipped the carrot. Just seemed yuck. But took the advice of others and added dried cherries. YUM! I think that was the thing that did it... Now everyone's asking for the recipe.

Prepared as written, this is time consuming. So! I did it MY way! Soaked the mushrooms & then cooked the rice in the drained liquid & chicken stock until done. Sauted the onion, carrots & garlic & button mushrooms in the butter while the rice was cooking. Added the thyme & sage--not fond of marjoram--and salt & pepper to my taste. Combined all when rice was done along with a handful of dried cherries, placed in oven proof container, cooled & froze. For 1 month. Took out day before needed to thaw. Baked in oven covered for 30-40 minutes until heated through. :) I can see slivered almonds, craisins, and even dried apricots added. Very good! Serves 8 nicely. "My way" comes from 40 years of cooking wild rice in Northern Minnesota.

This dish is essential for my Thanksgiving dinner and has been since 1995. It's earthy and delicious and my guests always love it. I make in advance the morning of, up to adding the wild rice to the pan with the crimini mushrooms. Then, 10 mins or so before serving, reheat with the mushroom liquid and finish. Secret is not to overcook the rice. I've also added other dried mushrooms, e.g. chanterelles, with success. I would add that any recipe must be corrected for seasoning before pronouncing it bland... If I could give it 5 forks, I would.

This was ok - end product was a little bland. I followed the recipe closely and I found something missing. This recipe is too time consuming for such an unimpressive result. If I make this again, I'll definitely change it to achieve a more flavorful dish.

I'd definitely make this again, but saute chopped apple with the mushrooms and add dried cherries to heat the whole dish. This variation came from a Wolfgang Puck recipe, and it makes the salad spectacular.

This made a great side dish to Roasted Salmon and Beef Wellington for a dinner party. Wonderful Rustic flavor and similar in consistency of risotto.

Rating: 1
This recipe was a little disappointing. It was just ok but a little bland, even if I used portobello instead of button mushrooms. I would have given it two forks if it hadn't been so expensive. When I decide to splurge on porcini mushrooms, I expect something a little more impressive. Next time, I'll just cook my usual mushroom risoto.

This rice was very good, a nice side dish that doesn't overpower the main entry. I served it with pork tenderloin with chipotle-marmalade sauce and veggies. It was wonderful to have almost everything ready ahead of time. I found the rice took more like 55 minutes to be tender enough. This will be regular in our home. The only change I made was to add shallots in place of the onions.

A wonderful Thanksgiving side dish with an earthy flavor.

An outstanding dish--goes beautifully with my son-in-law's wonderful smoked turkey for Thanksgiving. It's relatively easy to prepare, especially since much of the work can be done a day ahead & refrigerated. I would add to season generously with salt & pepper.

This is a good standby if you're in a pinch for a side dish that has a little something going on.

Wonderful earthy flavor that paired well with the tenderloin/shallot/port recipe. The dried mushrooms were a little more expensive than I expected, but their flavor made all the difference.

Very, very good. Definately a keeper. A little time consuming, but maybe because I kept having to refer back to the recipe... Next time I would probably leave the porcini a little bigger - the rice seemed to overwhelm the mushrooms. Cooked everything for about 5 min. after combining. Worth trying - a festive and elegant rice dish.

Very good rice dish. A lot less time consuming the second time around. I cut the recipe i half (there were only two of us..) and it worked out fine. Combined the wild rice with white, and it was great. Don't cook for 10 mintes a the end as recommended..it is fine after about 3-4 min.

Excellent rice dish. Made it with duck with blackberries, also on this web site. A fantastic combination. Used shitake, portobello and porcinni mushrooms. Made it for a dinner party and one person who is not a mushroom eater, enjoyed it thoroughly. Made rice a day ahead of time and it worked out great.

I love this recipe. I used a cup of white rice and 1/4 cup of wild rice. Porcini mushrooms were a little pricey for me, so I opted to use paddy straw mushrooms which tasted great. I did use crimini mushrooms, though. Lastly, I let the dish simmer in a bit of white wine for some added flavor.

Four forks according to everyone but me. I am not a mushroom lover, but all the relatives (25 or so) at Thanksgiving loved it. Also used leftover rice and leftover turkey for a casserole several days later.

My guests raved about this dish. I changed the recipe and split the rice ingredient in half and added basmati rice in equal proportion to the wild rice. The dish goes well with both fish and chicken.

You'd be hard-pressed to find a better wild rice recipe. To make this a vegan dish, canned vegetable broth works just fine. If you can find them, use the Crimini mushrooms. They see to have more flavor than white button mushrooms

Served this with a beef tenderloin infused with shallots and butter and a salad of romaine, red onions, pears and Gorgonzola -- it was a great success and a lovely complement to the beef, flavorful and not overly rich.

Wild Rice with Wild Mushrooms is an excellent dish. We had no porcini, so adapted using button mushrooms and vegetable broth. We served it with lamb chops and asparagus, but it could accompany almost any meat dish or be part of a vegetarian menu.
