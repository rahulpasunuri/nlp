This was not only super easy, but shrimp were fantastic! Light, crunchy, delicate breading and super moist (if you don't over cook it!) I am making mini versions for Super Bowl and VERY excited about it! I couldn't find Crystals hot sauce, but I did find another popular Louisiana hot sauce that was amazing on it! It is a MUST. Do not use Tabasco, not the same. I made my own remoulade which I love and put extra on the sandwich so it was nice and moist! LOVE this sandwich!

I was not impressed with the batter. Maybe my cornmeal was old. I will have to try this again either with new cornmeal or another batter.

Made these last night...AWESOME! I was in New Orleans last week and ate at least a dozen poboys. Mayo was only served on the meat ones, not the seafood one's. But Crystal's hot sauce was pretty much the only hot sauce offered. I can't get it here in OKC, so I brought home a couple big bottles...LOVE IT! Will definately make these many more times! Reminder of a great vacation.

Haven't yet tried this, but I must comment....Tabasco is the only hot sauce to use if you want traditional Po' Boys.

No. 1- MOST IMPORTANT USE GULF SHRIMP- the best in the world, safe and delicious! Plus make sure the oil temperature is just right. Also important, use mayo, not remoulade sauce for a REAL poboy. Ketchup is also traditional for most folks. Put the shrimp, then the lettuce, then the tomato, then the pickles. Toast the cut bread on the grill just a bit. Pop open an Abita beer and enjoy! Repeat as often as possible.

Excellent sandwich! The shrimp by itself is excellent and I usually don't care for fried shrimp. This is a keeper!

This was my first attempt at making po'boys. I've eaten my share over the years,and wanted to try them at home. I am amazed over this recipe!!! I made it for a family party,and received compliments from everyone. The crust is super light and crispy;the seasoning blend perfect! I was more than happy with this recipe and will make it over and over!! Also I did try a homemade remoulade sauce as suggested from the epicurious website.
