A very nice and easy but tasty and not-boring weeknight meal; everyone liked it. Only thing I did different was to also add 1/3 c. chopped carrots, and run the celery/carrot/onion mixture through the mini-cuis. Next time I will also run the corn bread stuffing for the coating through the mini-cuis ... it (Pepperidge Farm)was a bit too chunky for the crust.

The only way to dress up these drab burgers is to cover them in a savory sauce. The cranberry didn't do it for us-yuck! We used lots of horseradish mustard and chipolte mayo.

I used ground chicken, but I skipped the stuffing crumbs. I also added 1 tsp fresh thyme and 1/2 cups snipped spinach to the chicken mixture. I didn't have the bottled chili sauce, so I used 1/4 cup Pace chipotle salsa. I served the chicken burgers with a slice of cheddar cheese on toasted rosemary garlic bread. Turned out GREAT!

Great burgers. I used turky, I didn't find them too dry. I made them as cheese burgers. They were great with the sauce. I will make them again.

I used ground turkey as suggested. I knew this might result in a drier burger so I added ground pork as well (2:1 ratio of turkey to pork). I found the recipe OK, but my kids didn't like it much. My girlfriend, however, is a big fan of stuffing etc. and said she'd like the meal again sometime. So, I guess it's a matter of taste.

I prefer making this recipe with ground turkey. The chicken was too moist to work with. I also found that you don't need to coat the patties in crumbs afterwards when using the turkey. The key to the sauce is extra cranberry sauce!! Its like Thanksgiving on a bun.

I'm not a picky eater and I liked the burgers. My lady friend is quite finicky and she liked them: what more can I say.

The burgers can be dry if you aren't careful, but they are a GREAT alternative to the normal burger and IMHO taste better than turkey burgers.
