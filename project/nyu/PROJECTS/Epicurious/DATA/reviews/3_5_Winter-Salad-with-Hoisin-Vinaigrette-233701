This salad is wonderful! As suggested, I added julienned red bell pepper, grated carrots and snow peas. The dressing was delicious. (I did use a little less oil, and seasoned rice vinegar.)

Excellent salad for an Asian menu.

Found the dressing a little sweet, so added a TBSP of soy sauce. Also added a little more colour to the salad with julienned carrots and red pepper - will definitely repeat.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I added snow peas and toasted walnuts; I also used sesame chili oil instead of regular toasted sesame oil. It worked out very well, as everyone returned for a second serving.

Easy and flavorful! The dressing looks very thick when complete, so toss well and enjoy!

Excellent salad! I brought it to a potluck supper and it was a huge hit.
