I also would recommend not cooking this the full time indicated one the recipe. I removed mine when the center was still somewhat loose and the edges more firm and slightly pulled from the sides of the pan. It was very gooey and delicious!

Best pudding cake I have ever eaten! I have always made pudding cakes in a pinch for a dessert or just to fulfill a craving. This one is by far the best. I think the difference is this recipe uses butter instead of oil. I used the full amount of the cocoa in the cake and 1/3 cup in the hot water mix. I also cut my sugar in the cake by about 1/4 cup and used brown rice syrup as a sweetener instead of the brown sugar. Makes for a richer chocolate taste without too much sweet. Not a super fancy dessert but could be dressed up to be more impressive with good quality cocoa or whipped cream.

Wonderfully gooey, this cake isn't a show-stopping dinner party finish, but it is a perfect comfort food dessert for a gathering of friends - such as the group of college students who devoured it recently, offering praise all the while. It would have been even better if I'd had a higher quality chocolate on hand, and should definitely be served with ice cream.

I haven't made this yet, but I think this same recipe was a favorite that Mom used to make. It's not a pretty looking dessert, but good, good, good. Very simple to make and the pudding at the bottom is warm, gooey, and wonderful.We just called it Chocolate Pudding Cake- it's not really a brownie texture. I suppose you could try to fancy it up with different chocolate, but actually, Hersey's cocoa powder does the trick. OMG. I want some right now!!!:)

The first time I made the recipe, there wasn't much of a pudding layer, but this time around, it was definitely pudding-y and saucy. I think the trick lies in taking it out of the over while it is still a little underbaked (edges are puffed, but center still jiggles slightly. If you wait until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, it would have been overdone), and perhaps also the size of the pan used. For those of you who like ooey-gooey textured desserts, this is it!

Oh, please! This is about as chocolate-y as a Necco wafer. The idea's great, and mercifully easy to prepare - but save it for the kids. Hardcore chocoholics, keep moving: this ain't the one.

Delicious, homey, inexpensive and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9X13 pan. The perfect comfort food.

This dish is excellent for REAL chocolate lovers. The type who appreciate the raw flavour of chocolate, and not the wimps that think milkduds are the pinnacle of dessert. This recipe can be easily overcooked, so be careful. I find that if you take it out JUST before you'd take out a normal cake(batter doesn't stick), then it will finish cooking after, and leave the cake and pudding ampley moist. I also add extra cocoa and serve with an underwhipped cream flavoured with fresh vanilla bean or coconut. Divine.

This is a very simple recipe to make, and I really enjoyed the pudding rendered while baking. Next time, however, I'm following Ottowa's suggestion of adding bittersweet chocolate to the butter to obtain a richer chocolate flavor in the cake itself.

We just had this tonight after dinner and it was great. The cake was moist, the sauce was more than enough. My 15 month old daughter helped me by doing some of the mixing, sooo easy to make. Served it with vanilla icecream, will make it again and again.

thanks ottawa! excellent and sensible idea for adding chocolate to melted butter. i used hershey's cocoa, and approx 4 oz of el rey. cake turned out moist and pretty intense. cooked for 35 minutes at high altitude (glass pan) and probably could have done a few minutes less. ice cream a must, whipped cream was way too weak.

This recipe can be improved by adding 4 oz of chopped,good quality bittersweet chocolate to the 6 tbsp of butter and melting them together before adding to the batter. Bake until the centre is no longer raw although it will still be quite gooey. Delicious with just about any flavour of ice cream.

This was the easiest recipe to make ever..it was a big hit at an outdoor party where my guests and i had the cajun baked shrimp and just the contrast from the seafood to the hot chocolatey dessert was amazing...i would definitely make it again!!

How can you tell when this cake is done? i took it out of the oven after 35 minutes because it had pulled away from the sides. When i cut into the cake it was completely raw in the middle. i have never made a pudding cake before, is there a trick?

If I could give this less than one fork, I would. As others hve suggested, serve it ice cream because it is dry dry dry. I made two cakes and cooked the second for only 1/2 hour. Still no pudding. If you want pudding cake, this is definitely NOT it.

I grew up in PA and first had chocolate pudding cake at Hoss's Steak House in State College, PA. This is a common central PA dessert. I have been searching for a recipe for years. This recipe is as close as I have ever found! Wonderful! Not as dense or fudgy as a brownie...truthfully, I've never heard it called brownie, just chocolate pudding cake. It has a light sweet chocolate flavor, but the texture is what makes it: cake and pudding together. Wonderful! I now live in NY and made it for a friend who is a very good cook/caterer. She was a bit skeptical when it came out of the oven...it doesn't exactly look pretty. But one taste (with Breyer's vanilla ice cream!) and she was sold! Thanks Epicurious!

Very easy and yummy dessert! Reminds me of a cake my mother made when I was little. I left out nuts and served with vanilla ice cream. Great!

Made it just as is - simple and delicious. The sauce really is more like a pudding than hot fudge, and it's yummy. This is so easy, I will definitely make it again!

The brownie was good not great. I was expecting more of a fugdy taste and texture to the cake. It was very easy to make but I'm not sure if I will make it again since there are so many better brownie recipes out there.

This recipe is excellent: fast, easy, and great to eat!! Serving this cake warm and over ice cream, makes this dessert even more appetizing.

This was really easy and delicious. I made mine lowfat by substituting applesauce for the butter, and I don't think anyone missed the fat! I also increased the recipe by 50% to fill a 9-inch springform (because that's all I had) and used hazelnuts instead of walnuts, and it was still delicious. Definitely recommend serving a la mode, though, makes a big difference!

This is the same dessert my mother used to make when I was a child. (she used evaporated milk instead of whole milk). So glad to find the recipe again. It is delicious!

This cake is delicious. This cake can easily over cook. If your oven cooks fast, check the cake after 30 min. The cake still tastes great, but the pudding gets too thick if it's over coooked.

Fabulous and surprisingly simple to make desert that will satiate any brownie lover. The chocolate sauce that the brownie cooks in is ingenious. It is heavenly when served warm from the oven and I get compliments every time I make it!
