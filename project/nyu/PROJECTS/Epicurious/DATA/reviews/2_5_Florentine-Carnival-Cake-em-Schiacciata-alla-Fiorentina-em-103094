As a chef who really cut her teeth in Florentine restaurants I have to say NO, NO, NO, NO, NO to this recipe. Certainly it is a nice little cake recipe but it bears little resemlance to the Schiacciata I know. If you're looking for an authentic schiacciata recipe this isn't it.

This was ok. I bake bread all of the time and I'd rather have bread than this. Alot of work for not much return. It's alot like the bread for Marti Gras. I did like the idea of orange zest and will use that in my own bread once in awhile.

One word. Yummy! I had some egg yolks leftover from another recipe, so I decided to try this. Do not be put off by the eight hours of rising time. I mixed this up at 10.30 pm, and let it rise overnight in the oven with the light on. I baked it first thing in the morning, and we had it for a breakfast treat. Wonderful! I did add a pinch or two more cinnamon than the recipe called for, but that was simply because I love cinnamon (and so does my family), and like things quite spicy. It came out perfectly. Will defenetly make again!
