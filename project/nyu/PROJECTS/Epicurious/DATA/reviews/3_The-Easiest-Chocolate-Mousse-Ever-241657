Also if you double the recipe, blend it in 2 portions so it has enough space in the blender to gain the volume ( about 1.5 times)

Great and easy recipe! The mousse is very smooth. Key is to put blender on high speed (eg. "purée" ) for 3 minute before adding the eggs and another 3-4 min at high speed after adding the egg. This gives it the extra volume that it needs. Also I melt the chocolate in the milk mixture first and it turns out fine. And I put it into fridge as soon as I finish blending and pour into small cups so it won't deflat. Overnight refrigeration definitely sets it better but I think 2-3 hrs should be ok as well( so you can make it when u get to your friends dinner party and it would be ready by dinner ends)

Excellent and sooo easy! Lightened it up using fat free half and half and light butter, and used Baileys in place of the espresso.

When I made this, it was delicious, and I had no troubles with using the blender for this recipe, and it set just fine as well. This truly was the easiest mousse ever!

Did recipe as it directed. It took nearly 2.5 hours to set but it was excellent! I wondered if it had something to do with the eggs, the milk (used 2%) or the espresso? Loved how rich and flavorful and quick and easy this was!

I was very disappointed in the way this turned out. I melted the chocolate ahead of time in a double boiler to avoid any issues with the chocolate killing my blender. Followed the directions exactly but doubled it. After adding the eggs in and whipping it for what seemed like ages, my mousse looked like nothing more than chocolate soup. After more than 24 hours of refrigeration, its consistency would hardly pass for pudding. It tastes just fine, but due to it being so runny, it isn't likely to get eaten. In the future, I'll opt for traditional mousse, even if it does take some extra effort.

I made this for a dinner party. Quick and easy. I used Ghirardeli 72% dark chocolate. It was light and smooth, but very rich in chocolate flavor. Topped it with grated chocolate and chopped candied orange peel. Yum!

If you are using a blender, do NOT put the chocolate in first, followed by the scalded milk. It creates a chocolate clog that might break your blender. I recommend milk first and stream in the chocolate while blending. Or skip the blender and use an immersion blender assuggested before (that was my back up after I transferred the mess to a bowl). Very tasty and since I wanted to serve that day, I let it set up in espresso cups. I added a touch of cinnamon and topped with cinnamon whipped cream. Delicious. 4 forks if it hadn't injured my blender. FYI, I think scalding the milk is important for the end texture.

Okay, it's more of a pot de creme than a mousee -- heavier and thicker, but honestly, who cares?! It's easy as sin and delicious! I added some chili powder to mine to give it more complexity, and served it chilled (it was in the fridge for hours) in individual espresso cups. Perfect dessert to serve at my fancy NYE party. I will be using this one, and tinkering with it, for years to come.

Did in one pot with the immersion blender. So easy and yummy.

This mousse tastes incredible. Difficult to believe the minimal effort that went into it. The consistency was really thick and luscious, but only after overnight refrigeration. Also, if you keep it at room temperature for sometime, it starts to become a bit runny. Although, trust me.. it would disappear long before that can happen!

Should it be placed in the fridge or in the freezer?

The mousse never sat up like it should have. It was a fairly runny consistency.

this was acceptable for the minimal amount of effort. I wouldn't make it for company, but good if you need a chocolate fix. Chilling overnight gave it a more mousse-like texture.

You can put the egg in boiling water for about 1-2 minutes and that should reduce the risk of samonilla even further. I believe it's usually the white that is more susceptible to samonilla rather than the yolk.

can you use egg substitute and reduce risk of samonilla or would that not work?

Not quite like traditional mousse but pretty good anyway! and very easy. It's more like a very rich pudding. Perhaps blending the egg longer would fluff it up a little more (I only did so for about a minute). I'll definitely make again when I get that chocolate craving :)
