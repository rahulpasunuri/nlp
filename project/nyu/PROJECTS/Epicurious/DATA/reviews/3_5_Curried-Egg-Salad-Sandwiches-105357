This is goofy good! Didn't have currants, so substituted dried cranberries, and added a finely chopped Serrano pepper for a little kick. Goofy good!

I have been making this recipe since the August 2001 issue of Bon Apetit,I even have that original issue! The only change I make is I half the mayo and substitute ranch dressing, rave reviews eveytime!

I used all the ingredients except the cucumbers but did not precisely measure any. I did chop raisins instead of currants, and used lite mayo. Very delicious! Ive made it several times and brought it to a picnic where a bunch of friends asked for the recipe.

Very tasty! I used milk instead of more mayo to thin it out a bit.

I've made curried egg salad before but the other recipe I have does not call for currants. I used raisins (soaked them in hot water for a minute before using)instead of the currants and the sweetness is a perfect combination with the curry. I also think the cilantro was important and would not omit it.

This recipe is exactly what my egg salad needed...i added a bit of chicken for extra protein and topped it off with broccoli sprouts and...PERFECT! I just had the best egg salad sandwich!

This was great. I didn't have several ingredients and substituted a little red onion for green onion, omitted cilantro, and used craisins instead of currants and fat-free mayo. I will be making this again.

Very simple and delicious recipe for everyday cooking! A very good twist to egg salad. I had it with a Guinness beer, and it was a very good combination!

I didn't even have the cilantro and this was awesome! Not a huge mayo fan so I used 1/4 c. mayo and 1/4 c. plain yogurt. Tasty.

Very yummy way to use up Easter eggs, or just when you have a hankering for egg salad sandwiches.

Really yummy. Love the currants (although raisins did just as good) they add the perfect balance of sweetness. I cut the mayo in half and added low fat yogurt instead, which worked out great.

This was a big hit for a baby shower. I simplified the recipe, leaving out everything except the cucumber. I used sweet curry and served on mini croissants. Delicious.

This is a creative and simple version of egg salad. My husband, who does not like egg salad, loved it.

Okay, so I'm going to be one of those annoying cooks who didn't like the recipe but didn't follow it 100%...I used grated onion instead of green onion, no cucumber and used vegan mayo but other than that, followed the recipe. Others liked it (made it in the form of tea sandwiches for a baby shower), but I didn't think it was very special. The recipe sounds like it would be delicious, so perhaps it was just an off day for me (or perhaps next time I should skip the vegan mayo!).

I LOVE this dish! I've made it three times and everyone raves. I substituted Craisins for currants as they're easier to find, and they add a nice hint of sweetness. The last time I used fat-free mayo, and nothing was lost in the taste. Try it!

Yummy!! I just whipped this up for lunch for myself and I totally loved it. What a great combination. I used Patak's curry paste, which in Canada, you can find anywhere, but I had trouble finding it here in Reno, NV. Went to a specialty shop and got it there. Great recipe and great flavors!

We were served these at a shower as finger sandwiches. OMG, they were so delicious I wanted to eat 10 of them! (But I had to be lady-like and just eat 2)

This is wonderful. I made it for a light, casual, backyard dinner last night. Served with a big fruit salad and lots of roasted vegeatbles off the grill. Everyone was very happy. I added more onion and more cilantro. Very highly recommended.

Another excellent recipe from Epicurious. Thought the flavors blended together nicely. I didn't add quite all the cilantro but the next time I will.

Wonderful combination of flavors. An inventive and sophisticated twist on a classic lunch. Next time I would add some chopped jalapenos for spice (if I could find them here...)

I really like egg salad and this one is a nice change. To make it easier to eat as a "take to work lunch" I roll it into flour tortillas, or stuff it into pita bread.

We liked this one a lot - but I have to admit I was not crazy about the cilantro, although I normally like it in other things. I would omit that next time although my fiance said it grew on him as he ate the sandwich.

An elegant and super tasty version of an otherwise ordinary comfort food. You gotta try this!

mmmm! I used this recipe for this morning's breakfast and it turned out great!! I prefer without onions so I tried it that way and it worked very well! Just with eggs, curry powder, and mayonaise, easy peasy!! I also used brown wheat rolls instead of white bread. I assue it will certainly go well with baguette too! Choose your own kind of bread and enjoy!

A friend and I tried this recipe for a baby shower and it went over with great results. I decided to try it with chicken and discovered it makes WONDERFUL chicken salad. I purchased a rotisserie chicken and chopped the chicken coarsely. Added all ingredients as stated except curry powder and cucumbers. I substituted 2 t curry rather than amount in the published recipe. My husband and I ate the chicken salad on whole wheat pita without the cucumber and it was delicious!!! This is definitely a keeper recipe.

I like classic egg salad, but this is a great change. It's delicious, definitely something to have again.

This is a fantastic egg salad. The cilantro, onion, currants and curry accent the eggs to perfection. The spiciness of the curry powder, and the sweetness of the currents are a wonderful balance. The only change I made was using whole grain high fiber bread instead of white bread, and it was flavorful and fabulous.

This is a lovely twist on an old classic. The currants and slices of cucumber really make it shine.

Quite Tasty. I was not familiar with curry and egg flavors together, so I was anxious to try this for my new husband..who really enjoys them both. I served it with my first ever loaf of homemade white bread, toasted. I used English Cucumber,too. We both agreed the sandwiches would not be as good without the cucumber. Before I make this recipe again, I am going to try the other Curried Egg Salad Recipe that is listed here from Gourmet's March 1991 magazine. I can't wait to see which variation we prefer.

Just as I felt like eating egg salad, I came across this marvelous recipe. I think it would be perfect for a high tea. Don't forget to add the cucumbers for a really tasty sandwich. I used very crisp English cucumbers and golden raisens Exotic and yummy!
