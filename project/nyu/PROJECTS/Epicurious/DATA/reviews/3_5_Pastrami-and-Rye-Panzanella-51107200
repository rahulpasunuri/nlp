We loved this and will be making it again! A clever and tasty twist on one of Italy's best and most beloved salads. Light and fresh--even with Pastrami included! Brilliant, easy dressing.

I sliced the onions paper thin & did the whole rinse, soak thing 3X's, but still found the onion flavor slightly overpowering (& we LIKE onion). Since onion flavor & intensity can vary quit a bit, next time I'll taste test the onion before deciding how much to add. My big gripe here is the amount of pastrami. A 1/4 lb? For 4 servings?? Not for this cookie. Can't say exactly how much more I added, but it sure was more than a 1/4 lb. Without the additional pastrami it was just a nice Italian bread salad made with rye. Oh ... & I added slightly more dressing as well. Doubled the dressing "recipe" but didn't use quite all of it. Just my not always so humble openguin. :)

fusionfoodie, the scraped garlic with salt paste, plus the oil and vinegar make the dressing.

There is no such thing as authentic wagyu or kobe beef in this country. Google it. Save your money. You would think that epicurious would know this.

Have not yet made this recipe but plan to try it with both lamb pastrami and salmon pastrami.

Well, wagyu is beyond my means, but pastrami is lovely anytime.
