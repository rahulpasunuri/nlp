These were fantastic. Everyone loved them, especially the kids. I doubled the crab, altho it was expensive, and broke apart the crab chunks just a bit before putting into the batter. I used peanut oil.

ratio of cornmeal to crab is too great. You cant even tell that there is crab in there. Too bland. Unfortunate.

Sister in law made these as appetizers for Thanksgiving. Needless to say, EVERYONE enjoyed them....even the 18 month old. Because of the cajun roots, extra crabmeat was added. Absolutely DELICIOUS and instantly gobbled up! VERY EASY!
