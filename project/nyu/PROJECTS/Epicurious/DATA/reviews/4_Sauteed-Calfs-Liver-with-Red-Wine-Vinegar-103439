The sauce is yummy. I will double it next time. I added a tb of butter to it in the end. Followed the advice and cooked the liver about 1/2 of the time stated. Did not have parsley and it's still awesome.

OMG is RIGHT - this was DELICIOUS!!! I made it today and absolutely LOVED it, practically licked the plate clean! Thankfully, I read the reviews posted, so I only cooked it for 3 minutes TOTAL, so it was PERFECT!! Served it with rice, which was perfect for the juices left over! :)

OMG - This was awesome! The key was not to overcook it. A minute and a half at the MOST on each side. Totally tender and delicious!!

loved this "twist" on a traditional meal. the vinegar made this dish!! my husband could not stop going on and on about how good it was and thank god i made enough liver because i would not have had any of it because he ate it all!!! served it with baked potato on the side and onions and bacon...delish...thanks again epicurious for fabulous meal idea!!!

Excellent dish. No other liver recipes here live up to this one! The vinegar cuts the richness of the liver perfectly. I added in sage as I like how it pairs with the other ingreds. Note, 3 min per side is way overdone- 1.5 min per side on med-high works perfectly for me every time.

This was very good, but perhaps a little overcooked at 3 minutes per side. It may also be wise to add a little additional butter after the liver is removed for sauteing the garlic. I will certainly make this again.

I am Tuscan and this is indeed a traditional Tuscan dish. I think 3 minutes per side results in overcooked liver,however.Cannellini beans cooked with sage would alo be a delicious sside dish. To start,a hearty bowl of cabbage soup.Round it out with a dessert of lemon sorbetto with some cold vodka poured over.
