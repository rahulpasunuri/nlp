This is an amazing stuffing recipe. I use dried cranberries instead of raisins and that makes it exceptionally good. This year I had some vegetarian guests so I put vegetable broth instead of chicken stock on the stuffing in a small pan for them and given that none of it was left over I think it is tasty no matter what kind of broth you use. This is the third year I've made this dish and it never fails.

This recipe was amazing! I made it without the red onion, celery or pepper due to my wife's dietary preferences. I was worried that this might detract too much from the flavoring, but it was still GREAT!! I will definitely be making this again.

This is the most AMAZING stuffing recipe I've ever had. My mom started the tradition making it every Thanksgiving and Christmas for the past 5 years. Now, I have my own home and have been making it for my family! I even treat them every couple of months because I just can't wait til the holidays to eat it again! :)

This is the best recipe for stuffing. I have always disliked stuffing and it was always the dish I would pass over. I went on a mission to find a great stffing recipe and I found it!!! Every year for the last 5 years I have made this stuffing and every person who has it agrees, it is AMAZING! Enjoy

I have made this stuffing for 3 Thanksgivings and am about to make it again this year. I use vegetable stock instead of chicken to make it veg-friendly, and I omit the red pepper, which has always felt kind of out of place to me. Otherwise, I leave everything as is. It is the best and I will never try another stuffing recipe again. Everyone loves this one!

I made this without the bell peppers and used parmigiano reggiano and it was an instant hit. Eveybody asked for the recipe and it has been a staple for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Its easy to prepare and the flavors are wonderful.

We made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was delish! I omitted the bell peppers because I don't like them. Before cooking, definitely add some chicken broth to add moisture, otherwise it gets quite dry.

After reading the other reviews of this stuffing I felt I had to try it this Thanksgiving. It was not difficult as some suggested or any more time consuming than other stuffing recipes. I did not add the pine nuts even though I wanted to because one of my guests hates them. We all felt that this recipes was just ho hum and my guests and I were disappointed. I will go back to my mother's classic sage and thyme stuffing next year,

I made this stuffing for 16 people and EVERYONE loved it! I'm not a fan of raisins, though, so I used dried cranberries instead and it was top notch. I think I've found my stuffing recipe for the years to come.

I made this because of the good reviews and it was a LOT of work. I think the prep took me about 1 hour but it tasted very good and was popular with everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner. It's not the best stuffing recipe I've ever made but it's a good mix of ingredients.

Rating: 3
What a lovely take on the traditional stuffing. Nice change from heavy sausage and cornbread. I increased the amount of parmesan because I had an extra 3/4 cup, so I just threw it in. Don't do this. The amount in the recipe would have been perfect. Do not omit the raisins. I considered it but changed my mind based on other reviews. They are important, even if you don't adore raisins.

I served this stuffing recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. Our company went for seconds and then warmed over for a late night snack. It was a great alternative to the heavy meat stuffings.

I served this on Thanksgiving. This was my first time making stuffing from scratch, and it is a lot of work; I am glad I cubed and baked the bread early. I didn't bother removing the crusts - that seemed an unnecessary step. I wasn't at all sure that these flavors worked together as I mixed it and I made some dubious remarks to my guests as I served it, but everyone raved and returned for seconds (and thirds!). My father is an avowed cheese hater, though I have this theory it is more in principle than practice, so I didn't disclose this ingredient. He said it was the best stuffing he has ever had! I particularly liked the savory/sweet combination. I served it with Alton Brown's wonderful brined turkey and the excellent brown sugar and pecan mashed sweet potatoes found on this site. I will definately use this recipe again, but I will be sure to provide ample time for all that cutting and cubing!

I really loved this ...it was worth the work which I did the day before.

Rating: 4
As other reviewers have said, this recipe is not for the faint of heart: it's a lot of work for stuffing. It's well worth it - the best stuffing I've ever had! I baked two loaves of bread, one sourdough and the other rosemary ciabatta. Cutting off the crusts would have taken forever and wasted tons of bread, so I left them on and the recipe was just fine. I added dried blueberries, currants and golden raisins. The sweetness is ESSENTIAL. Do not skip this step! Overall, a lot of work, but fantastic!

Rating: 2
This was good, but did not stand up to the cornbread stuffing I also made. After reading the reviews about how this stuffing was too italian, I omitted the red peppers and basil (we had red peppers in the other stuffing) which was a good decision. The parmesan added great flavor as did the pine nuts and raisins. I needed a lot of broth to soften. For a traditional stuffing this is a good pick. I would add fennel or leeks next time.

Rating: 3
This is time consuming but delicious. It makes a ton of stuffing even though I cut the recipe by 25%. Used cut up Ecce Panis Ciabatta rolls for the base and golden raisins. Those were my only changes except to add a bit more broth as others had said. Great blend of flavors.

I followed the recipe (except I did leave the crusts on the bread and it was fine)and thought it was very tasty. It is a bit time intensive, but I actually made it 2 days before and kept it refrigerated until Thanksgiving day and took it out about 30 minutes before putting it in the oven. I poured the chicken broth over it at the last minute before baking and it turned out really well. Yummm.

Making this stuffing is quite a project, but it is very good and since I believe stuffing is the most important dish of Thanksgiving, it was worth it. I omitted the red pepper and cut down on the garlic to make it a little more traditional. Next time I'll cut the bread pieces smaller, but that's the only thing I'll do differently.

This was delightful--ours didn't taste like pizza at all. Definitely would make it again

This stuffing is incredible! Even my husband, who is notoriously picky and usually doesn't like soggy stuffing, loves this recipe. I have to admit, at first I was very skeptical of this combination of ingredients, and it seemed like there was too much onion. I also thought the red peppers and Parmesan would overwhelm the stuffing and seem "off" for Thanksgiving, but I was proven wrong. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used only 2 eggs instead of four and I used 1 loaf of country sourdough and 1 loaf of country white. Wonderful color, texture, and flavor. The fresh herbs really enhance the flavor of this stuffing, and I disagree with the other reviewers who thought it was too "Italian" for Thanksgiving fare. It was perfect. I also didn't think the labor required for this stuffing was too much, as some other reviewers noted. It was no more labor intensive than the traditional stuffing that my family makes every year. This is a new Thanksgiving staple for me!

Excellent. I used black currants instead of raisins since they are a bit smaller and less likely to overwhelm.

This was great. The taste of all the ingredients went very well together. The pine nuts and the raisins "plump" and get soft, and add so much flavor to this recipe. I have been making this for 3 years.

As usual, this stuffing was the best-loved dish of the meal. Used frozen blueberries since I forgot to buy raisins, which made the stuffing an odd color but tasted great. If reheating the stuffing, dot with plenty of butter.

This is a fantastic change from your typical stuffing recipes! I have made this for the past couple of Thanksgivings, as well as dinner parties. It is always a big hit! However, I also needed to use more chicken broth than the recipe states. All in all, great stuffing recipe! Thanks!

We made this stuffing again for grilled leg of lamb. This is the best stuffing we've ever made, and it is a great winter, colorful side dish with turkey, pork or lamb. It got rave reviews at both our Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner parties. I do make this dish up a day in advance to allow for the flavors to meld, then reheat at 300 deg. Before putting in the oven the next day (uncovered in order to form a tasty crust!), I add a little of the chicken stock to moisten. Also, we purchased two 7-1/2 oz. bags of unseasoned, dry bread cubes rather than make from scratch and soaked the cubes in the chicken broth to moisten. My husband and I are both garlic lovers so we were more than generous with the garlic. We never use fresh Parmesan anymore, instead we grate Asiago cheese which has a "nuttier" flavor and is not as "salty" as regular Parmesan. You would think that the raisins wouldn't work well, but don't leave them out - the taste combination is unbelievable! This recipe is definitely a keeper, and it makes lots!

I was disappointed in this recipe after reading all the great reviews. I've never been a "stuffing person", but I thought maybe it was because I'd never really had a good one.

It was kind of a production, but well worth it. It made a TON of stuffing - if you're making it as a side dish, you could halve the recipe easily and still serve 8 comfortably, especially if there is a bounty of other dishes (we served it at Thanksgiving - we had a ton of food). I made it as the recipe directed and it was delicious. Will definitely keep in mind for another big dinner.

This is truly delicious! I could not stop eating it for days! I ate it with turkey sandwiches and even mixed it into scrambled eggs! Although-I actually liked it better in in the following days. Probably because I at first made it too dry.(Do not hesitate to make in advance if your oven is too full.) BE SURE TO ADD PLENTY OF BROTH- it should feel heavier than light. I also thought the oregano overpowered the fresh basil; might (but might not) lessen amount next time. I agree also: though the combination of raisins, pineuts, etc., sounds weird, and I closed my eyes when I put them in, the combination was perfect. I like the ideas of adding other fruits--may try! Also, the top does get dry. Use cover if needed. Mmmm...how long till next Thanksgiving?

No one at my thanksgiving liked this dish (just family). They said it reminded them of pizza... so just doesn't go with turkey. I agree with the their feedback. Followed recipe exactly. In addition, thought oregano was very strong, and pine nuts and raisin couldn't stand out from the herbs and parmesan.

I personally can't stand stuffing, but as my husband was making a traditional Thanksgiving meal, I had to find something that sounded yummier than the usual salty yucky stuffing I've had at so many other dinners. Voila! This is it. You wouldn't believe the rave reviews I got for it. I used one pepper instead of two, and one loaf of sourdough and one crusty french baguette (keeping the crusts, which make for a yummy texture). I'm not a raisin fan, so I substituted dried cherries instead and it was terrific. My gourmet chef husband loved it and everyone asked for some to take home. Will definitely make again.

I agree completely with the reviewer below. This is a good stuffing but it does not work with the typical Thanksgiving fare. The flavors are overwhelming and clash with just about everything else you might serve...unless your Thanksgiving table has a Lasagna on it! Save this recipe for another event.

Definitely a keeper! Since it takes a bit of time to prepare, I made it a day ahead and heated it up for Thanksgiving. Toss in extra handfuls of Parmesan, the cheese makes the dish! And don't leave out the raisins... it sounds weird, but they work!

This is a nice tasty stuffing, but frankly it doesn't go with the T-giving meal. Waaay too Italian/Mediterranean tasting for my liking. It reminded me of many pasta dishes of that style. It is easy to make, and relatively simple, but it just totally clashed with the other parts of the meal. I like it enough to eat it (and thank goodness I only made a half recipe!) but I wouldn't make it again as part of the holiday regulars.

Wanted to do something a little different this year and this dish caught my eye! Also, with house-guests from Italy staying with us for Thanksgiving, the Mediterrean twist proved irresistible!

I selected, prepared, and took this stuffing to our November herb unit meeting because it calls for several herbs and offers an interesting alternative. It is excellent and was very well received. A number of discriminating gardener/cooks asked for the recipe. It is easy (not to say, quick) to prepare as described in the recipe. The large volume involved requires large cooking pans, as indicated. I prepared it the day before I served it.

Awesome recipe! I added 2 Diced Fuji Apples since I like apples in my stuffing and it worked fine.

This was excellent, well liked by all guests, and is making great leftovers. A particular attraction is its appearance, with bright colors. I used currants rather than raisins; I find the small currants more subtle in the blending of flavors and textures. Speaking of texture, next time I would use more pinenuts and toast them farther along; a little bit of crunch would have been welcome. The recipe makes a large amount. I cooked the excess in a separate dish, but even for a stuffing-loving crowd, there was too much.

AMAZING! I made it today for the first time today and my guests are downstairs raving about it -- very nice Italian but light flavor. If you bake this outside the turkey I would recommend using a bit more chicken broth. This will be a hit with your Thanksgiving dinner.

I've been making a similar stuffing from a Nov. 1992 Sunset Magazine recipe. The following additions are outstanding: add 4 jars of drained marinated artichokes that are quartered, about 1 1/2 cups sliced mushrooms and 8 minced garlic cloves (sauteed with the onions and celery) . Really good. The pine nuts and raisins seem like a great addition - I'll try that this year. I'm going to skip the bell pepper though.

I made this stuffing last year for our first Thanksgiving after we were married. My family is still talking about how wonderful it was. I think it was the greatest success of the night.

This was the hit of last Thanksgiving dinner. In fact, the only people that were at our house last year and won't be there this year have already called for the recipe.

The photograph of this recipe in last November's thanksgiving issue was mouthwatering, and I followed it almost exactly. It is a hit for everyone, very rustic, yet unforgettable.

The peppers and onions and celery add such a fantastic look to this colourful delight. Everyone begs for the recipe each time its made.

The color -- provided by the red peppers and fresh rosemary and basil -- make this stuffing look scrumptuous. I left out the pine nuts because my company doesn't like nuts.
