This soup is to die for! I added some fresh corn and a few extra potatoes to beef it up a bit. I also too the advice from one of the other reviews and instead of cooking the spinach in the soup, I line the soup bowl with it before heating up the soup - perfect! I made the pesto without the pine nuts (allergic) and it was the best part - it absolutely makes the soup! I had people all over my office wondering aloud what smelled so good. Definitely will become part of my preferred rotation!

Really not great. We found it bland but maybe it was the jarred pesto I used? Also, I read in some of the reviews that the veggies they used were fresh from the garden and I don't have the luxury.

This is such a delicious and satisfying soup! The pesto makes a huge difference. I used this recipe as a guide to use up some things that were on hand (hope this is helpful to others). I made the following changes: used four cups of organic low sodium vegetable broth w/2 cups sodium-free chicken boullion, doubled the red skinned potatoes (and skinned them before putting them in), added 4 garlic cloves (2 minced and 2 thinly sliced), used 1 can of light red kidney beans, added two large bay leaves, and used store bought pesto (which worked just fine).

Tasty and wholesome feeling... may add a jalapeño next time. Be sure to peel the potatoes and tomatoes.

Very easy recipe. Both my kids loved it and they're not automatically going to eat a lot of vegees. But in this recipe, they blend together nicely and taste really delicious. I agree that the pesto really makes the soup. I had extras in my freezer, so that made it really simple. I also added a few touches (making it more substantial but less healthy, heh heh) -- I started with salt pork instead of olive oil, and I added two extra cups of beef broth. (Some of my vegees were a little large so I needed more stock.) Other than these changes, I stayed true to recipe.

Wonderful clean out the frig soup and great way to use bounty of late summer veges. Pesto is a MUST and really what makes this soup shine. Added kernels from 1 ear fresh corn, extra tomatoes and cannellini, 2 cloves garlic, bay leaf, some basil, black pepper & red pepper flakes, yellow and green zucchini. The potato & c. beans really thickened the soup nicely. Followed other reviewer's note to add the spinach straight to the bowl (brilliant call) instead of the pot. Served with crusty bread lightly brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic, thrown under the broiler. Great dinner just as nights are turning cooler. This one is a keeper!

fabulous soup. this is a great starting point for a vegetable soup. i reduced the olive oil to 2 T, increased the carrots, used half water and half broth (veg. would work well here too) and measured the spinach by hanfuls (2 handfuls although 3 would be good too). added a sprig of oregano, 2 bay leafs and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. I know, I know not the same recipe but the foundation of this recipe is what is so important, it's really easy to make it your own.

By itself, this is a nice, light and healthy soup, but adding a tablespoon of pesto gives it an incredible depth of flavor. I used one can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, left out the green beans, and used yellow squash instead of zucchini. I also put a bed of chopped spinach leaves on the bottom of each individual soup bowl and then pour the hot soup over it. The result is tender, cooked spinach, and allows me to freeze the ramaining soup without worrying about slimy, overcooked spinach later on.

Great tasting soup!! Made a few variations to original recipe. Added to original recipe: + 2 cups stock + 28 oz tomatoes + 2 tbsp fresh basil + 1 tbsp parsley + 1 cup small pasta (I used tiny tube pasta) + rind of parmasean cheese to flavor soup + 1 extra can of beans + 2 extra potatoes I finished the soup with pesto and romano cheese. It was delicious!! Please note that with the additions, the soup yielded about 10 servings.

Wow - this is a great recipe! I did alter a little: added 1/2 t. red pepper flakes, 12 oz. bulk chicken Italian sausage, substituted 14 oz. canned diced tomatoes with liquid for fresh tomatoes, and substituted 1/2 c. orzo for potatoes. My family loved it, even the zucchini haters. The pesto is a must!

My new favorite minestrone recipe! The pesto makes it taste so so good. Followed the recipe to a T except had to substitute a can of diced tomatoes for fresh. Will make again.

Delicious, the pesto is a must. Top with a generous sprinkling of toasted pine nuts and some parmesan to make it really good.

I altered this recipe by adding prosciutto. I also swapped kidney beans for garbanzo beans. It tasted incredible. If you choose to add prosciutto, you will need to alter prep in several ways. It's very easy.

This recipe was great! I substituted a large can of diced tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes, and cooked macaroni for the potatos. Best of all, it took only an hour to make. The pesto is a must unless you add your own seasonings. It was bland without it.

Delicious and simple to make... I used canned San Marzano tomatoes because of the tomato scare going on (plus I love them) and subbed tiny pasta for potatoes because of personal preference. This recipe makes a lot of soup--probably 10 servings.

This is the recipe I go back to again and again, and send to sick friends. Sometimes, I just put chopped basil leaves on top just before serving to cut down on the calories. One of my favorite soups.

The addition of pesto really makes this soup. Always use homemade - it's such a snap to make, why would you bother to get the store-bought stuff?

This recipe is really fantastic, even for 3-year olds.I added pasta, canned tomatoes. Loved it!

Very good without the pesto, EXCELLENT with the pesto. I couldn't believe the flavor! As the other reviewer did, if you have a parmesan rind, throw it in there.

Rating: 4
Very good for how fast it comes together. I would give it 3.5 forks if I could - the pesto is really what makes the dish great, and without it the soup is good but not spectacular. Using good tomatoes is key, I think, if I didn't have excellent in-season 'maters I would probably use canned.

this is a great minestrone. I just wish I had payed more attention to the cooking time...my veggies were too soft. I added more broth, a parmesan rind and left out the potatoes. Loved it

Forgot to add-- I made fresh pesto and I think that really makes the soup. If you do that, it is very flavorful. My husband liked the soup without the pesto just as well though (since we used veggies from the garden)

This soup is so easy to make and the broth is out of this world (and I used a packaged chicken base). The cooking time was too short-- my green beans weren't fully cooked, and will add small pasta next time and omit the potatoes for personal preference. This soup is delicious, and I am already craving more of it. Best veggie soup I have ever had!

This was a good soup. I did add salt and pepper, garlic, and like earlier reviewers suggested, parmesan rind and tiny pasta. I also simmered for much longer than suggested and simply added bought pesto to the soup during cooking rather than at the end. The end result was pretty good. I think this will freeze well for quick lunches later on. One note, this is a hardy meatless soup to sneek on your meat loving family members.

This minestrone is very simple to make and very delicious. I did add garlic and a but more broth and tomato. The touch os pesto adds an incredible basil taste to this delicious coup.

Very flavorful! Don't omit the pesto whatever you do. The amount of zucchini was a bit excessive. Definitely a one-dish meal but not exactly "summery".

I don't know what it is about this recipe that makes it taste so special, but this is a four-forker for me. I've made it several times now, and it is now one of my stock soup recipes. I use a variety of beans, depending on what I have on hand. I also just use lots of basil, preferably fresh, but dried if fresh is not available, rather than go to the trouble of making the pesto.

I made this for a group of friends and served it with some fresh ciabatta bread, and they absolutely loved it. I added some fresh garlic to give it a little extra punch, and also some tiny pasta. I stirred a big spoonful of pesto into the soup in the pot, as well as topping each bowl with some. Believe me, it was bursting with flavor. The combination of all the textures and flavors was great.

This is easy and taste great. Great crowd pleaser on a cold day even though it's named "summer".

After reading the other reviews, I sauteed garlic with the onion to add another flavor dimension (it IS Italian, after all)and added a Parmesan rind to simmer with the soup. I also added some very small dried pasta to make it a true minestrone and give it more texture, and stirred some pesto into the soup before dishing it up and topping with additional pesto. The results were amazing. I served it to a group with a crusty loaf of ciabatta, and they all begged for seconds. Definitely a keeper.

This soup is wonderful and simple-- I'd eat it weekly in the summer. I add potato chunks and a small pasta to complete it.

Absolutely Fabulous, I added 3 Tbsp Pesto while simmering and replaced 1/2 the chicken stock with Beef and added 1/4 cup fresh parmesan while simmering. Fabulous, its a keeper!

I did everything this recipe called for, but I also added browned stew meat diced small, and browned or grilled Italian sausage, chunked into the soup. I also added the pesto throughout all the soup instead of the dollop on top. All of this added more flavor. I also doubled the recipe and froze containers for the winter.

I think key to a great minestrone is adding a rind of parmesan cheese when simmering the soup. It adds a whole new layer of taste to the soup!

As the two previous contributors noted the soup without the pesto is bland, I picked up on this before I even began to make it just by reading the recipe. However it is important to note always with "one pot" meals, its the nice long simmering time that realy counts and brings out the full body of the dish. I personaly adore soups of any kind and minestrone happens to be a personal favorite. All soups depend on a good stock no matter what, so I would recomend replacing the chicken broth with a nice healthy beef stock,or perhaps even ox-tails. Remember this is also a soup that is complemented even further by the garnish, the fresher the cheese the better and dont forget a pinch of hot sauce, or red pepper.

Without the pesto, the soup was rather bland. Once the pesto was added, it was delicious. My 12 year old daughter ate almost the entire batch. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was good but not great. It seems to lack a bit of flavor. Maybe next time I would double the pesto or add some red pepper flakes.
