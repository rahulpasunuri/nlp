While I liked this recipe, I don't know why they instruct you to reduce it to 4 cups! You would end up with a chicken demi glace (which is fine if that is what you were going for). I used my own instincts and just reduced the soup just to where I liked it - then seasoned with salt. I ended up with about 12 cups of soup. Soup is a nice dark color and when chilled, sets up like jello.
