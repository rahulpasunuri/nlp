I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe! This will be my 4th Thanksgiving making it. It's my absolute go to cranberry recipe. If you have not made this.... DO! Well balanced flavors, great texture, and bouquet. Further more it makes well ahead, but it is quick enough to do same day.

Added a lot of depth and flavor to the chocolate mousse. It was be excellent just as a jam on bread.

I made this with frozen raspberries instead of the cranberries, and it was delicious. I served it with chocolate pudding.

I made this dessert Christmas Day. It was so good. I did cut the oranges smaller. I used canned whole cranberries because cranberries are out of season here. They worked great. I used coolwhip instead of whipping cream. It came out perfect.

I doubled the liquid portions as several other reviewers had suggested and it was just delicious. A huge hit.

I was a little apprehensive about leaving the skin on the orange, but I was not disappointed! The slight bitterness of the orange peel combined with the sweetness of the suger and the tartness of the cranberry was amazing! Easy to make and very good!

The liquid portion of this dish tastes amazing. I just doubled the cranberry and liquid part, and added it to the orange. The only other thing I would reccomend is to cut the oranges small.
