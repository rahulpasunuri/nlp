As they said before almonds are for ajoblanco, but they also use it as a topping for the "porra antequerana" (similar to the salmorejo but with green pepper).

Wow, A Cook from Washington. They don't "try to claim it is different from gazpacho;" it just is. It is based on the traditional Spanish recipe: salmorejo, but with the addition of almonds, as the Madrid cook noted. Personally, I really enjoyed the tweak and this will be my new go-to salmorejo recipe. I'm totally ok with mixing my metaphors.

FYI, salmorejo is made with day old French bread, about 3 - 4 ounces. Tomotoes should be scalded and peeled, coarsely chopped and put in blender with 2 garlic cloves, 4 is overkill unless they are miniscule cloves. NO ALMONDS. Almonds are for ajo blanco not salmorejo, you are mixing your metaphors here.

Love, love, loved this soup! So refreshing on a summer evening. As other reviewers mentioned, I preferred the prosciutto to the egg as a topping. I found the garlic to be a bit harsh/overpowering at first, but within a few hours it had mellowed. Next time I might use roasted garlic or saute the garlic prior to blending.

We've made this twice and loved it. I pulsed the bread, garlic and almonds in a blender and then added coarsely chopped tomatoes without the squeezing to get the juice the recipe called for and it turned out great. We prefer it at room temperature and can take or leave the garnish. Others that have sampled it loved it also. The garlic really gives it a twang.

this is a 21/2 forks in my opinion. It's easier than other cold soups, but I prefer roasting the tomatos first. It was overall good. I actually enjoyed more without the toppings and a little warmed up a couple days after sitting in the fridge.

The article tries to claim that this is different than a gazpacho - it is, there are almonds, but you can't taste the difference. Definitely a good recipe though, especially if you like those creamy type gazpachos. the prosciutto was a really nice addition - which I would use on any other gazpacho - but the egg was kinda gross. the yolk especially added a weird texture. It also makes a lot - a full blender full - so as a side dish, this is easily 2 meals.

This was very good. I skipped the egg part but the rest was tasty. I let it sit in the fridge a couple of days and it was even better. I would make again. So easy.
