This is the first time that I have been really happy with a veal chop recipe. I had very small thin veal chops so I browned them and then let them roast in the oven for 15 minutes, which turned out to be just perfect. The meat was tender and the flavor was wonderful. The tomatoes and shallots plus the polenta - to which I added grated fontina cheese - made this a complete and delicious meal.

I was surprised how delicious this recipe turned out. I did not puree veggies as some suggested as I did not want to hassle with the food processor, I also only used chicken both. The sauce was great! I served with roasted red potatoes & asparagus. My chops was thinner as they were from Stew Leonards so they only took about 10 minutes in the oven. All in all a great meal & would def. make again.

My husband was licking the bone - I'm not a veal eater, but made this for his birthday and he never looked up from the plate. Thanks to previous review, I put the tomato/shallot roasted mix in the cuisinart (along with a few garlic cloves I roasted with them). I served that puree on the bottom of the veal in lieu of the polenta. The jus was great - I did strain it (before adding olives and chicken broth) as I didn't want burnt garlic bits in the sauce. A great and very versatile recipe. I used the jus on on some roasted turkey and that was great too.

I made this on Sunday for guests, but with a few changes. First, my butcher is insane and cut the veal chops 3.5/4 inches thick. They were beautiful. So that meant I cooked them longer, probably closer to an hour. I did roast the veggies beforehand, and I actually pureed them in the food processor after the were done. I added this puree to the wine (after the wine reduced) along with the broth, and let that simmer and reduce for a while before adding the butter. My hubby does not like olives, so I didn't add them. I served this with saffron risotto and everyone loved it!

The dish over all was delicious but the shallots were still crunchy even after additional cooking. I may try this again but cook the vegetables in the sauce to soften them more. I would have like the sauce a bit thicker too. I served this dish with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. The plate looked great with the combination of colors.

This is a great recipe, which can be made even more simply. Since we are not big meat eaters in our family, I usually make 2 thin veal chops, and the full amount of tomatoes. To make this simpler, I pit and add the olives to the tomatoes before roasting. Then I don't bother with the wine/broth part, and just serve the roasted chops on a platter with the roasted tomatoes at one end. It's also quite flexible, and tastes very nice with chunks of red onion substituted for the shallots.

Great recipe. Have used it for company several times and it always gets great reviews.

Rating: 4
The preparation is simple, but the flavors are anything but pedestrian. Without overpowering the flavor of the pricey cut (justifiably so), the olive jus serves as the perfect accoutrement. Meanwhile, the vegetables compliment the chop beautifully. I prepared simple roasted potatoes (garlic & rosemary) alongside the veal as the flavor profiles are so similar. There is no doubt in my mind that this delicious recipe will be requested repeatedly in the coming months, and I will certainly oblige.

Delicious! I made this for my boyfriend and I to see if we liked it- we loved it! The only thing I did different was to the soft polenta recipe. Instead of water I used garlic and herb broth and added some shaved parm at the end. It was great! Enjoy!

This is my signature dish prepared for dinner guests or special occasions for just me and my wife. I've probably made it 20 or 30 times. I'm not a big polenta fan so I substitute garlic mashed potatoes, risotto or gnocchi. I also add a few spears of steamed or grilled asparagus as a garnish. I have always received raves from my guests.

This was extremely good. I probably used more fresh herbs (and therefore oil) to coat the chops than was called for but otherwise I stuck to the recipe. Since I didn't have cornmeal, I served it over risotto. This was also very good.

This is one recipe that exceeded all expectations. The tomatoes, shallots and olives blended beautifully! Make it again? You bet!

While I do like the recipe, it is just Veal Provencale with the tomatoes and shallots roasted instead of sauted and added to the reduction.

My first time making veal and I now understand what all of the fuss is about! The husband decided that this dish (served with the polenta) was better than the food we get at the best resturant in town:)

I made this recipe last night, and the veal was fantastic! Having read the other reviews, I cut down on the salt a bit and did not miss what I left out a bit. I agree with the other reviewers who said they could do without the tomato/shallot side dish. It was OK, but not great. A single roasted tomato or some very fresh greenbeans would have made a much tastier and more attractive (not to mention even easier to make) accompaniment.

This has to be the best veal chop recipe I have ever made! Make the soft polenta adding chicken broth instead of water and some grated parm reggiano cheese with a tblsp.or two of butter. Total food euphoria!

Top Notch! Definately splurge on thick, well-marbled pieces of veal. It's worth the extra cost. My husband was v. impressed.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe to impress. Flavors are incredible, top restaurant quality. Do cook the roasted shallots and tomatoes - they add a lot to the dish. I did cut way back on the seasonings as I thought 3 tbl of rosemary too much. Used 1 tbl fresh rosemary, 2 tbl of fresh thyme, 1/2 tsp salt.

This is a wonderful dish! It's not difficult to make yet it looks like something you'd get at a restaurant. The flavors are complex and the look of it is devine. You get lots of bang for your buck with this one.

Fabulous! Easy! Was looking for a recipe that was a little different for some veal chops, this is it. I had all the ingredients on hand, Marcella's soft polenta is a must. I love complete meal recipes like this.

Abolutely the best dinner party dish I've ever made. Easy to prep ahead so you're not so busy at the last minute. It's important to get really good thick veal chops from a butcher. Don't bother with this dish if you can only get chops from a grocery store.

I made this last night for my family to test it out for a dinner party. Very good recipe - different. I think it was too salty though and I only used 1/2 the amount of salt the recipe called for. I will use less next time. Also I will roast whole cherry tomatoes instead. As a matter of fact I'll probably just throw them in the same roasting pan with the veal. Forget the shallots. I Served with mashed potatoes and salad.Definitely a keeper with a few changes.

Excellant "occasion" dish. Do cut down a bit on the salt, but otherwise perfect. Potatoe (or substitute:parsnips, celery root, ect) combo also a great accompniment.

Made this for Valentine's dinner. Marinated night before and served w/polenta. Butter should be added slowly and stirred continuously so jus doesn't separate. Excellent!

Absolutely delicious and it couldn't be any simpler! The polenta is a must. Everyone liked it so much there was nothing left over.

Don't be overwhelmed by the long recipe. Fast, easy and so tasty. Veal is just so tender and juicy, it doesn't compare to any other meat. Keep the flavors simple and enjoy with a great glass of wine. Soft polenta a must.

Made this dish last night - only complaint was that it was too salty for our tastes. I will make this again but, since we consume very little added salt, will reduce this ingredient. Remember the olives & Chicken broth (unless homemade stock) add salt as well. I served with sweet potatoes mashed and then pan-"fried" to create a crust... Added additional contrast to the presentation of the dish.

Rating: 3
While I agree that this is quite a delicious and relatively easy recipe, I also agree with the previous reviewer that the roasted tomatoes add nothing. They not only get mushy when roasted, but the skins do separate. Next time I will try marinated sun-dried tomatoes, which will also save a step.

Made this dish last night. The veal chops were delicious and I am going to do them again. I strained the sauce and reduced it to a beautiful consistency. However, would not do the tomatoes and shallots again, there was no flavor to this dish. I used Roma tomatoes - arn't they the same as Plum tomatoes? I scraped the loose tomatoe skins out of the dish, added tyme and frozen peas, thus salvaging it to serve to my 8 guests.

I made this dish on Valentien's Day. It was very tasty and easy to prepare. The roaster tomatoes and shallots are perfect with fish too. We really enjoyed this recipe. I used thick rib chops, so the oven time was a bit longer that indicated.

Excellent flavor - I substituted dried herbs for the fresh and wedges of white onions for the shallots.

This was yummy. I would recommend using only fresh thyme and rosemary. I happened to have both on hand, otherwise I would have substituted dried thyme and the results probably would have suffered. I did not have any white wine so used some white vermouth and water, you could use all chicken broth I would think since the sauce is very olivey. I only had 3 chops so I cut the ingredients down somewhat but used the full amount of olives. Very yummy. Served with potatoes and parsnip mash and patty pan squash on the side. Easy to make a very nice presentation with the roasted tomatoes and the sauce. Great recipe for veal which is otherwise quite bland. Very good.

Excellent. Delectable. Just cut the salt down to 1 teaspoon, and use sea salt if you can. I also used Kalamata olives covered with spicy red pepper flakes, which added a nice touch of flavour. A keeper.

The reviews given this dish are absolutely correct. I used veal stock instead of chicken stock to make the sauce. Simply outstanding, and not all that difficult to prepare. Likely to become one of my signature dishes.

Got raves when I prepared this for four people. Make extra sauce. Two of us thought the salt content should be less and two thought it was fine. The olives add quite a bit of salty taste. I did not fix the roasted vegetable with it. I will fix again but use less salt and unsalted broth.

Rating: 4
This recipe is wonderful. However, in the future I will skip the roasted vegetables since they are not cooked with the veal or the reduction for the veal chops. The sauce with the veal chop is wonderful and went well with a steamed vegetable (we used asparagus) and oven roasted potatoes.

Simple and fantastic, the kitchen actually stayed clean! Watch the saltiness of the sauce - it was a bit strong.

I've made this a number of times for guests - it gets raves. Relatively simple if prep is done beforehand. For non-meat eaters, I substituted chicen breasts; once I used salmon steaks, which went beautifully with the sauce flavors. If you are not into polenta, try pureed cauliflower instead (a low carbohydrate substitute).

I made the entire Jan. 99 menu including the veal chops for a birthday dinner on Saturday. We had the suggested wines with it and it was such a memorable dinner! We decided it would be a hundred dollars a plate at a lovely restaurant. Delicious! The Antinori Chianti was perfect with the veal chops and it's gorgeous sauce.

This is a great recipe. It made me feel like a gourmet cook. I did not have rosemary and only used the thyme. I used garlic instead of shallots. Everyone raved how delicious it was. I will be one of my very special recipes.

I liked this recipe so much, I've made it several times. When modifying the dish for two, I halved the rub ingredients and reduction sauce ingredients. Once to experiment, I used my own frozen homemade pesto instead of the rosemary, and used veal stock (Jan. issue?) instead of chicken broth--a very tasty variation. Asparagus spears always make an attractive and tasty accompanyment.

This recipe is great!! The chops came out tender and delicious. The flavors were savory and well-balanced. Veal chops are an extravagance, but certainly worth it.
