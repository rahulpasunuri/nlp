Delicious! Dense and fudgy, like a flourless chocolate cake only a bit lighter from the hazelnuts and the tanginess from the reduced port. Wasn't crazy about how the chopeed hazelnuts looked when pressed to the sides of the cake, but the alternating hazelnuts on top made it look great, and the birthday girl was very happy. I did end up baking the cake 15 minutes extra to get it to the point it needed to be at, and the icing was too soft to make "waves" - but it was all so delicious those are minor issues.

Oh, one thing I forgot to say. This cake breaks easily. Be sure the platter you turn it out on to is the one you want to serve it on. Mine started breaking off in chunks. I rescued it by supporting if from the sides w/ flexible plastic and then poured the choc icing over it. Once it sat in the fridge the choc icing got hard and held the cake together. Whew! I think since I doubled it I shouldn't have used such a deep pan...more shallow pan next time.

Super Decadent and Super EASY! I used top ingredients (Guittard choc, organic butter, etc.) and got outstanding results. Cake was so dense the b-day girl had to really work at cutting the first slice! Hand- painted whole chestnuts with gold glaze and decorated cake. It was a hit! I doubled the recipe to serve a mid-size b-day gathering. One note: I bought the expensive port...don't waste your money since you're just reducing it anyway. Get the inexpensive stuff...I will next time. I got thank you emails about this cake for days afterwards!

This is one of the best and most delicious "cakes" I've ever made. Yes, it is time-consuming but worth every minute when you receive the raves from dinner guests! It's a very impressive dessert and when you get right down to it, is not that difficult to make! I have not only made it several times myself but many of my guests have requested the recipe and made it as well. Definitely worth the effort!

WOW, I can't believe the ratings. I made this back when the issue first came out and it has been one of our favorite special desserts. I still have the issue. The glaze alone is the very best ever. Looking today for the glaze only, I went online to see if it was there and noticed the "would not make again" comments. Definitely worth making! And always a delicious show stopper.

Has anyone made this cake? Does anyone else have a hazelnut cake recipe? I am looking for a Chocolate Chip hazelnut cake recipe. I purchased the cake at Swiss pastry in Philadelphia, Pa. I just cannot duplicate it. My e-mail address is verizon.net

Good, but there are better chocolate hazelnut cake recipes.

I am checking on the ingredients. There is no flour in the recipe. Is anything missing?
