Lessened the soy, as other reviewers suggested and I think it was the right thing to do, as could still taste soy and was seasoned sufficiently. HOWEVER, I didn't care for the recipe overall because the meat ends up with sort of a raw red wine flavor that I didnt care for even though I used a good wine that I like to drink. I realize I'm alone in my opinion but thought I would mention it.

Will definitely make again, but with half the soy sauce (I should have read the reviews first because this was too salty even with low sodium soy sauce.) The flavor is great otherwise.

This worked out great. I brought to a large gathering with a lot of varying tastes. I followed previous reviewers suggestings and used less soy sauce.

This was a very simple recipe with great flavor. As suggested thanks to other reviewers, I used 2/3 cup red wine and 1/3 cup soy sauce. I highly recommend this ratio even if using low sodium soy sauce. I acknowledge being a bit of a salt-a- holic and this was plenty salty for me. Even if tempted, definitely hold off salting the steak until you've tried it with the sauce. I also substituted cilantro for the parsley, as that's what I had in the fridge. Enjoy!

Incorporated some of the previous reviewer's suggestions (halved the soy sauce and simmered the marinade to use as sauce for the steak), and this was fantastic! Definitely a keeper.

Made Flank Steak for the first time ever using this recipe and it came out great! However, there were some changes to the recipe that were absolutely NECESSARY. I used 1/3 cup of light soy sauce instead of 2/3 of regular, and also ended up adding a bit more wine. I used a full cup of red wine, and after making the steaks, threw the leftover marinade on the pan and simmered it for a bit to make a sauce for the steaks. If you use a small amount of light/sodium-free soy sauce, it comes out great!

I'm not going to rate this since I made so many changes, but I'd give my version about 2.5 forks. I used the alternative marinade as a jumping-off point, added extra garlic (always), ~1 tsp. spicey mustard, 2 dashes Worcestershire, 1/4 c. allegro marinade, fresh oregano, some lime... You get the idea. My main comment: this is a lot of meat! Granted, my house eats a good proportion of vegetarian entrees, but we've had it for 3 days now and still have about half a flank steak left. PS - The left-overs make excellent tacos or chili. :)

Tasty and simple, but the soy sauce is a bit strong. I think 2/3 wine to 1/3 soy sauce would be better.

Substituted balsamic vinegar for red wine with excellent results. Marinated overnight. Even cooked to medium (I prefer medium rare to rare) this was great.

A tasty recipe, but tone down the soy sauce or use lite. I added 2 oz. of lime juice for more tenderizing. Marinated for 45 minutes and it turned out just right. Will use this recipe again.

Very tasty. Only a little bit salty. Maybe that could be fixed with less soy sauce or low sodium shoyu

This is the first time I've prepared flank steak and I didn't know what to expect. I had red wine and soy sauce but no fresh garlic or parsley. I used light soy and garlic powder. In addition I added the juice and slices from 1/2 of a lime and marinated it for about 3 hrs. Broiled as directed in the recipe. It was very good. I served it with mashed potatoes, sauted mushrooms and a green salad. It was a good meal.

I have to say it was a bit disapointing to me. I did add about 3 tbs of olive oil, but the soy sauce flavor was so strong, i couldn't even taste the garlic. It was too salty for me and for my guests. Also, from past experience, 30 minutes to marinate a flank steak is definetely not long enough.

This was amazing. I used this recipe plus 3 Tb Olive Oil and marinated steak tips (3 1/2 lbs) overnight. A definite crowd pleaser.

Quick and easy. The tast is wonderful. I kept some of the marinade and put it on the meat when we were grilling it outside. I will make this again.

Simple, delicious, and easy to prepare! I skipped the parsley because I didn't have any on hand - still turned out well. I had never prepared flank steak before and this recipe helped build my confidence.
