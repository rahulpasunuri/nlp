AMAZING!!!! When I made the caramel the first time, I waited for a nice amber color before adding the cream.... it ended up tasting a bit burnt. So, I remade it waiting until the sugar just began to change color and it was perfect!! Highly recommend this recipe! As I made this for 2, instead of making large sheets of puff pastry, I cut out thin squares, baked them and then stacked them into little towers. Absolutely beautiful and delicious!!!!

I made this for my dad whose`s not crazy about bananas or caramel and he loved it. The only thing I did differently was I sauteed the bananas in brown sugar. I felt the raw bananas wouldn't taste as well.

Really delicious. My only advice would be to, if possible, make the puff pastry the day you plan on serving the dish - I made mine the day before and it wasn't as easy to work with. Other than that, it's very simple and a great dessert.

This was interesting. As I made it I was thinking no way never again. When I put it together and I tasted it it was good, I think the recipe itself was not the problem I think I personally could take or leave the marscapone cheese. I never had it before, It tasted like unsalted cream cheese or butter, at any rate, al together it was real good and company loved it. think next time I might add chocolate instead of caramel, and try that.

Very good and extremely easy to make. It would also look nice if you drizzle melted chocolate on top.

Wow!!! Delicious. I am not a huge fan of bananas but I loved it anyway. Easy to make. Next time I may try using a different type of fruit.
