I also used Craisans instead of Cherries. I doubled the recipe, and used a star cookie cutter for the puff pastry base. I had way too much filling left over, however. So, I used the scraps and left over filling for a family fun dessert.

We made these for a Channukah party and they vanished in no time flat. Everyone loved them. Super easy, elegant and tasty. A winner!

To simplify, I cut the sheet of puff pastry into 6 equal pieces. This made each tarlet slightly larger which looked more substantial on a dessert plate.

Easy, quick way to turn my leftover puff pastry from New Year's into a lovely tea-time treat. Any jam and dried fruit will do nicely - I used Lulu's Fig & Cherry Balsamic, and Craisins.
