GREAT recipe, but you MUST use tart pie cherries. Don't even bother if you don't have them. Bings just do not have the flavor and intensity necessary. I did make one change. When I strained the cherries I used all the sweetened juice. Just added water to make the 1 1/2 cup liquid total and heated that and mixed with the cocoa. I then decreased the brown sugar to one cup. I wasn't about to throw all that extra cherry flavor away. Served it with whipped cream, and it was truly decadent!

Delicious! Although it looks overly rich and dense, the final product is "fluffy" and just right in terms of richness of flavors. Will definitely make again.

For those who added Kirsch, how much did you use? I'm surprised how strong Kirsch can be.

This recipe turned out really well despite my modifications. I only had 1/3 of a cup of white sugar to mix with the cherries so the juice produced was slightly less than 1/2 a cup. Additionally, the only cherries I had were farmer's market sweet black cherries- I actually tried this recipe for the sole purpose of finishing up my fruit before it went bad- and as far as I can tell there was no damage done to the overall scrumptiousness of the dessert. While the cherry flavor in the chocolate cake is on the subtle side I found that the chunks of fruit were plentiful enough when chopped up that the cake still tasted deliciously of cherries. My end product was very moist, chocolaty and fruity- I couldn't imagine a better use for leftover cherries. I recommend serving the cake warm with vanilla ice cream:)

Im European so Im familiar with cooking with sour cherries, and I like to try out new recipes. Have to admit though, as the cake was baking I was hesitant. It looked like it is going to be dry. Once baked it did not smell glorious or nothing, it just looked sad and not promising. But once it cooled in the fridge I tasted it and it tasted like heaven. I utilized some of the others recommendations and cut cherries in pieces. Also did not have any kirsch but had sour cherry syrup, yummy! We dont eat white sugar, so I used splenda. Instead of chocolate chips I added cherry chips and followed the recipe from there on. It did not disappoint. The cake is awesome! I will take them to work but I think I'll put some cherry frosting on them just so they look better. Not that they need it but just for visual. WARNING: You have to use sour cherries, otherwise it will NOT DELIVER. Sour cherries are the key. Bon Appetite!

This is an excellent way to use cherries from the farmers market and has become one of my all time favorite recipes. The bars are wonderfully chewy and dense. Totally delicious and I love that they are good for a few days!

WOW-this was amazing. I only had 2 cups of cherries and it turned out just fine. Also added a splash of kirsch to the juices = yummy. It was DEFINITELY better on the second and third days, so I would advise to make it at least a day before you plan to serve it (if you can wait that long before cutting into it!).

Well, I made many modifications and this turned out pretty swell surprisingly enough. First off, I halved the recipe since I only had a smaller square pan. I reduced the butter and sugar by about 30% (I don't like my cake very sweet or oily). Lastly, I hate cleaning more bowls than necessary so I just dumped the cocoa mixture in with the flour, then added the butter/sugar/egg mixture to it. I baked it for about 30 mins and it turned out moist and delicious. Next time I will chop the cherries into smaller pieces so they are more evenly distributed.

Me and my family loved this cake and I will definitely make it again. I did make a few adjustments. I cut down the granulated sugar to 1/2 cups and brown sugar to 1 cup. Of course, we like deserts less sweet so this depends on taste. The biggest difference was definitely the cherry liqour. I added a tablespoon of cherry liqour to the 1/2 cup of reserved cherry juice and that has really enchanced the flavor.

Even though I had to substitute some of the ingredients (ie. couldn't find sour cherries and used bing instead; only had Dutch-process so had to use that one), this recipe turned out great! It was not overly sweet, but very rich and chocolatey. I can imagine how much better it would be if I could use sour cherries. I would definitely make it again.

I'm a chocoholic so, when I pulled this cake from the oven and saw that it was dark and moist -- like a devil's food cake, I thought I would be in heaven. But the cake just didn't work for me. It seemed like something a young inexperienced baker would make. It was moist to the point of seeming undercooked and the cherry flavor was lacking. I put half the cake in the fridge and left the other half out, and tried both every day for three days. I did not think it improved at all with age. I did, though, prefer the refrigerated cake to room temp. I'm very glad that I did not make this for company!

Just made these for some friends who will be stopping by tonight after dinner. They haven't had any yet, so they can't rate them, but I've eaten enough to say that I like them a lot! They've been in my refrigerator for two days, and although the cherry flavor isn't very pronounced (next time I'll add some kirsch to the batter before baking) they have a great chocolate/fudge flavor and are quite addictive! Will definitely make again...

This cake was a BIG hit when I brought it in to the office. People had difficulty leaving the room without going back to the pan for one more nibble. I used half tart cherries and half sweet cherries. I also substituted 1 cup of maple syrup for 1 cup of brown sugar. I will definately make this one again!

As previous reviewers have stated, this cake gets better with age. The longer baking time is a must too . . . about 15 minutes more does it.

I thought this was terrific. In light of the reviews, I made several changes: doubled the amount of cherries and soaked them in kirsch. I then added about 1/3 more of the soaking liquid than called for. Let it sit in the fridge for a few days before serving. Very fudgy and decadent.

This was awesome. I absolutely loved everything about it, except maybe how much work it was, but at least it was worth it. I used fresh cherries and they worked a treat. Would store it in the fridge though. Highly recommended.

Although my husband liked this, I found the flavor lacking. I like the idea, but I think a better result would come from simply topping a chocolate cake with a cherry compote or sauce and a little whipped cream.

The cake ALONE is nice but not great BUT top it with lightly sugared strawberries and some cream and it is GREAT. Nothing like dense chocolate and berries!

The cake was good, but nothing I'd make again. It didn't have a cherry flavor, even after several days. Perhaps this was because I used fresh bing cherries instead of the sour ones called for.

Followed the recipe as directed and ended up with a beautiful moist cake. I tasted a tiny bite the first day and was not impressed. Just so- so. The second day it was much better and the third day it was chocolatey and the flavor of the cherries had developed wonderfully. Definatley a keeper if you like sour cherries and chocolate. Plan ahead and make a few days ahead though. I thought ice cream overpowered this cake. I think next time I will serve with a dollop of fresh whipped cream.

I made from sour cherries I just picked. Made no substitutions but I did make only half the recipe and baked as cupcakes, which took 17 minutes. The "something extra" I did in serving was to top a cupcake with a spoonful of home made sour cherry preserves (sour cherries cooked in very heavey syrup and allowed to stand several hours). This does give a chocolate covered cherry sensation. Why cupcakes? Makes portion control easier and easy to stick in freezer and pull out servings as I wish. Half the recipe made 18 cupcakes, which have 160 calories each, a reasonable dessert serving. Do the math. The suggested serving size would be three times the calories.

1. Definitely longer baking time. 2. Definitely fridge if summer. 3. Needs something else--I think the kirsch is a great idea.

Just brilliant - texture and flavour! The cake melts in your mouth and disappears almost immediately! With this cake, I managed to suprise family gathering again, even though my surrounding is pretty spoiled by my cakes. I can only agree - it is worth to try adding cherry liquer or Kirschwasser.

I brought this cake to a barbecue recently, where it was very well received. I made it a day ahead but, but judging from the piece I brought home with me, it definitely needs three days to achieve peak chocolatey-cherry goodness. I used a generous pound of frozen home grown sour cherries and accompanied by a scoop of good French vanilla ice cream, I thought the balance of flavours was just about perfect. I had to increase the baking time stated in the recipe to nearly an hour, which is unusual given my oven tends to run hot. Did anyone else observe this?

Best chocolate cake recipe I've made in years! Good anytime, but best after 3-4 days in the refrigerator -- becomes fudgy and dense. Great flavor. Next time I may serve it with creme fraiche or lightly sweetened sour cream.

I thought this recipe was just so-so. In fact the people at our 4th of July party ate the costco cake before mine. There are many other recipes I would bake before I would do this one again.

I made this cake for the 4th of July and it was AWESOME! I served it with a scoop of ice cream and it was delicious. I would definately make this again. HOWEVER, I would STRONGLY urge you to store this cake in the refrigerator! It will NOT keep at room temperature, especially in the summer months. I placed the remaining cake in a Rubbermaid (airtight) container and left it sit in my kitchen counter. Within a day-and-a-half after making the cake, white mold appeared on the top. (Good thing I hadn't put the powdered sugar on the top before hand else I would have never known :-P )

I loved it! I used fresh bing cherries, only used 1/4 cup sugar, but added 1/2 cup Pimm's (cherry liquor) which ended up being the "cherry juice" that was called for in the original recipe. I would not serve it the same day it was made though, I ate a piece once it cooled & it was only so-so, but the next day - WOW! Served with fresh whipped cream, this is going to be a favorite during cherry season.

Made this over the weekend and liked it a lot. Very moist/dense cake with subtle chocolate-cherry flavor that becomes enhanced over time. It subtleness and simplicity of appearance is what appealed to me as well as my guests. Who wants just another boxed cake with with generic too sweet frosting? Would dfintely make this again.

Made this for a special luncheon, and I was disappointed. Yes, it was moist, but that was about the only thing going for it. It was like it couldn't decide whether to be a cake or a brownie. Needed "something" like a frosting to be really called a cake. I used fresh cherries (hand-pitted), and halved them for more cherry taste, but still not too impressed with the cherries. Had it over a 3-day period. Yes, it did improve with age, but still not a "wow" recipe. Wouldn't make it again, rather just do a boxed cake and throw some cherries in and frost it. Pretty plain.

I have a very similar recipe that's a lot easier...and probably tastes about the same. It's just a chocolate cake mix, 1 egg, 1 tsp. almond extract, and a can of cherry pie filling. Can either bake in a 9 x 13 or jelly roll pan, depending on what you like best. Always gets raves, and is so simple.

The cake is nice and moist but nothing special. I was hoping for two very distinct flavors. The chocolate was great but there was only a hint of cherry. I was hoping for something like a chocolate covered cherry and this wasn't. Yes, it is a good cake, but not worth the effort or the expense of the frozen cherries. There, my two cents!

Served this with home made ice cream with fresh cherries and chunks of chocolate in it.... the children think I am brilliant and my guy thinks I invented this.... please don't anyone tell 'em I found it on line.... Our guest think I am something when it comes to "original" recipes.

I made could't find sour cherries so I used canned bing cherries. Also, I ran out of mini-chips so I used chocolate chunks. Everyone raved aout the wonderful texture and flavor. I will certainly make this again and again. Barbara from Stratford, CT
